1p45px1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CafelatRobot/comments/1p45px1/give_us_your_best_shot/,Give us your best shot,"As a Robot owner for the past three months I have become mildly obsessed with getting the best possible shot, and I love the fact that there are so many variables.

Reddit has all sorts of useful advice on this topic, and there are contributors who clearly have been doing it a long time that I have learned a lot from – thank you!

However, shot properties are often hidden in the middle of threads or then debated to the point where I become uncertain they are a good pattern to learn from.

With imitation being the sincerest form of flattery, I wonder if people could be persuaded to simply share how they make their best shot. It would be great to see what sort of variety there is out there if nothing else.

To make responses easy to compare I thought the format below might work, with drafting notes in \[\]. I’ve tried to strike a balance between enough detail and not making the list too onerous, hopefully its about right! 

**Country of contributor:** \[Optional, helps identify the coffee and I’m curious to see if there are any geographical differences.\]

**Type of roast:** \[e.g. Medium dark, dark etc\]

**Name of coffee:** \[Optional, but may help people to try new coffee, particularly in a particular country\]

**Weight of coffee:** \[grams, if measured\]

**Weight of hot water into basket:** \[grams, if measured\]

**Preinfusion time:** \[if any, in seconds\]

**Remaining shot time:** \[in seconds \]

**Pressure:** \[bar, during the first half of the shot, I appreciate that pressure can dip during the later part\]

**Weight of espresso out:** \[grams, if measured\]

**Level of happiness in shot:** \[from 0 – 10, where  0 is not at all happy, 10 indicates that you have found your perfect shot and 5 is happy enough but still actively looking to improve\]

**Notes:** \[anything useful to note that doesn’t fit into the above\]

**Comments Welcome:** \[Yes/No – some people like me are happy to take comments to see how to improve, some may be happier just sharing what they do.\]

 I’m going to reply to my own post with mine, although (as you’ll see) I’m not done yet! I’m looking forward to seeing what people say. Thank you in advance for sharing!

We used to sit together in our shared classes and she was pretty cool, like the coolest. But then she met new friends from her country, so she left me alone and sat next to them. I did the same out of pity in Italian class, which I regret because I really want to talk to her like we used to.

We stopped talking and only said hi rarely, but we always looked at each other and she always kept stealing glances at me when she thought I wasn’t looking, which I did too. Once she played with her hair and turned her face to look at me while I was sitting behind her.

My grades last year were dropping in the classes I shared with her because I couldn’t focus when she was around. On Instagram, I often liked her stories, but she only liked my story from when I was in Paris.

Fast forward to summer holiday, I went to Rome in Italy and posted about it, and she went to Milan at the same time. She added me to her close friends story and I added her too. She only liked my stories from Italy in the close friends story.

Now the second year has started and it’s the same. We always steal glances and I keep yearning for her or the chance to talk to her. I did ask her out to grab coffee once in the first year, but she said she had plans with her family. I’m always the one texting. I get it if she’s straight and doesn’t want me, but why is she looking at me like this.

1p45nq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1p45nq6/fn_goblingate/,[FN] GoblinGate,"The boys stood in front of the gate. The taller one, David, had his hands in his pockets and he was sucking his teeth audibly. The shorter one, who had a hormone disorder that hung around his gut, was called Calvin.

“We’re just gonna open it yea?” David said, removing his hands from his pockets and blowing into them. Even though it was a balmy 70 degree day. 

""What are you scared ya wanker?” Calvin responded in a rough cockney accent he had been trying out in spite of it’s overwhelmingly negative reception.

“Little bit.” David said and shivered “are you not?”

“Little bit.” Calvin conceded “but I’m not a pussy. Neither of us are.”

“Yea I know.  I don’t think we need to do this because of how much I know we aren’t pussies.” David was bouncing back and forth like a boxer, or runner at a crosswalk. 

Not all runners bounced back and forth, generally just the ones showing off. “Are we gonna do it?”

“Yea. I don’t think we have a choice. I’m not sure what I’m scared of though.” Calvin looked at the gate which was, by all means, a very scary gate. It was alas, it *was* just a gate. So why did Calvin feel so scared? “I mean it’s cause the boys that went missing, yea?” 

“Yea.” David responded. 

Three boys had gone missing from this property and no one quite knew what the cause had been. No one even had any good guesses. 

“It’s not like we’re gonna open it up and get sucked inside.” Calvin chuckled nervously, secretly terrified of exactly that happening. “That’s ridiculous, this isn’t a story.” 

“Yea.” David responded. David had a voice that was deeper than his years. It reminded some of his teachers of a cartoon character. They presumed he was a bit slow, because his speech was. David was not slow, but he saw no reason to correct people. David thought the world was a lot easier to live in when people thought you were dumb. “What if it does though?”

“Then we fucking deal with it.” Calvin hissed, about to piss his pants with anticipation. 

They both walked closer to the gate. They shuffled and anxiously gesticulated. Then they each tried to buy time hoping the other boy would be the one that opened the gate first. Eventually they looked at each other and then they each put a hand on one side. 

They pushed, and the gate swung open. They Boys were promptly sucked inside.



“*MORE BOYS! MORE BOYS!”* echoed a gobliny voice and whilst loud metal clanged. 

The boys looked up and saw a gobliny looking creature with armor that looked a lot like it was made out of pots and pans. In it’s hand it held a wooden spoon and a saucepot, which affirmed to the boys that the armor was likely made out of pots and pans as well. The creature looked at the boys with wide dumb eyes.

“What are you?” asked Calvin, sporting lightly pissed in pants. 

“Goblin.” Said the goblin. 

“What do you want?” asked David, sporting heavily pissed in pants. 

The amount of piss in the pants did not directly correlate with the fear the boys felt. Rather, it had to do with the fact that David: drank a gallon of water each day, and Calvin: subsisted primarily off of energy drinks, iced coffee, and the liquid pools that formed in the cheese divots of pizza. His hormone problem was very real, but he helped his gut along to reach its current girth. 

“Well. I ate all the other boys.” Said the goblin flirtatiously while it ran its long fingernail in a circle on the bottom of it’s sauce pan. “Do you have any.. other ideas?”

The boys, who had never been flirted with, and likely did not truly understand what this goblin was probably implying, looked at each other and shrugged. 

“Don’t want to be eaten.” Posited Calvin.

“Definitely not.” David agreed.

“Are you like a devil? Can we beat you in a game?” Calvin asked the goblin. 

The goblin thought about this. “That’s new, but I’d like to eat you anyways I think.” Then the goblin thought back on her favorite book. In this book the hero had his pretty golden ring stolen by a gross fleshy boy, and then he chased him to a mountain. In the end the hero dies by falling into a volcano. It was a very sad and very long story. The hero wasn’t in the story enough, at least not in the opinion of the goblin, but she agreed she was no literary critic. “Maybe a game.” The goblin lamented, acting quite heroically.

“And if we win you won’t eat us?” Asked David.

“Sure sure, I probably won’t eat you.” The goblin shrugged. 

The boys looked at each other, wet pantedly, and Calvin chimed in “I think I speak for both of us when I say that we would really appreciate a promise” 

“A pinky promise if possible.” David jumped in, thinking perhaps the pinky promise also had more meaning to a goblin the way it did for him.

“No pinky.” The goblin sneered, crossing its long fingers behind its back and holding up its four fingered hand. The goblin did of course have a pinky, it was missing its ring fingers on each hand. This meant the goblin could never be married in christian church. Although she was not particularly interested in a christian marriage, this fact still upset her. “I promise though, I no eat you if you win.” The goblin loosed the sweetest smile of which she was capable. 

Given the circumstances the boys thought this was a pretty good deal and agreed. Although they did so with their eyebrows raised the way David's dad always did when he agreed to one of the boys' plans. *I agree but I’m watching you* the look proclaimed*.* The boys weren't doing it correctly, but the goblin got the point. 

“What game then, tasty boys?” The goblin asked.

“What are we good at?” Calvin asked David.

“Nothing really.” David shrugged back.

“I’m good at Call of Duty” Calvin told the room. 

“I don’t have that.” The goblin chimed in. 

“I can dance a bit.” David declared. 

“Let me see.” The goblin said. 

Not knowing what else to do David obliged by moving his legs around then humping the air a bit. It was an okay dance all things considered. It was an especially good dance for a gangly teen who wasn’t actually born with rhythm. He had found some along the way, and he did what he could with it. 

“I like that. We’ll put a pin in that.” The goblin said.

“Do you have any weed?” Calvin raised an eyebrow.

“Yea we’re very good at smoking weed.” agreed David.

“Numba one dope boyz.” Calvin shouted in his bad cockney accent.

“Yea but… you guys are kids. I’m an immortal being, I’ve been lit of THIS shit for years.” The goblin said. “It wouldn’t be fair.”

Calvin took his shirt off “Bring it bitch.”

David removed his shirt and agreed “What he said.”

The goblin, who was feeling a bit pervy, was wondering if she could ethically do anything with these boys (other than of course eating them). She decided she was a bit excited by the boys removing their shirts, and decided to just run with things. “Okay, but no funny business.” The goblin said, blushing and feeling stupid. 

The goblin went to the other room and grabbed her big old goblin bong. It had been her grandmother's and it held deep sentimental value to her. Then she grabbed a few nugs of her hybrid strain and thought ‘*no that’s boring’* then she grabbed two other strains before just bringing out the whole box of goodies. 

“What the helllllll….” Calvin trailed off, seeing the large box of goodies. 

“We might be in trouble.” David agreed.

The goblin had a person suit that she had made out of boy skin. She had worn this suit to try to go to a dispensary. It was an easily seen through disguise and the goblin had instead figured out how to buy drugs online and have them sent to her in the mail. She had continued eating the boys, because boys kept showing up. She preferred raviolis in better circumstances. 

They had begun passing around grandma's bong and the goblin was lost in thought. 

“I think we oughtta” Calvin pointed his head in no direction in particular with what he considered to be the universal *let's skedaddle* gesture. 

“Where?” David mouthed. David had already looked around and there was no gate, just piles of items and an inordinate amount of pots and pans. “Plus I think she’s just lonely.” David mouthed with some effort. 

Calvin could not read lips. He understood ‘*where?’* got the point and nodded along with the next thing, brushing it off as David forgetting he couldn’t read lips. David forgot things like that a lot according to Calvin's diary. He got the bong and took a toke. It was rather good. “It’s nice” He coughed.

“Thanks.” The goblin said, and she realized it had been quite some time since she had received a compliment. She teared up a bit and said “You know what boys, I think I fucked up.”

“Whats that?” David asked stonedly.

“Yeah” The goblin took another large rip from her grandmothers bong. “I think I fucked it up. I got so mad! I was mad at everyone! I was so alone I thought I was right all the time. FUCKKKKK… I hurt some people too.” 

“We all hurt people.” David thought aloud.

“Amen.” Calvin agreed. Calvin wasn’t religious, but he thought it was the type of thing T-pain might say. Calvin respected T-Pain a great deal. 

“I’m too far gone now! I can’t fix it!” The goblin burst out.

“Yea.” David agreed. “You can’t go back, but you can make better decisions now. The other week I was at school and I took Ron's pants out of his locker because I had pooped in mine a little. I didn’t know how to tell anyone. Ron said they were his favorite pair and that he thought someone had stole them. They were at home in my laundry though. I haven’t brought them back to school yet and he’s really sad about it. I think about it a lot. I was gonna just try to slide them into his locker, but I think now…” David sighed  “Maybe I’ll just tell him what happened.”

“I do shit like that too.” Calvin nodded sagely.

“I guess I can start by letting you boys go. That’s a good way to be a little better.” The goblin was feeling quite stoned now, and she was almost certain she wouldn’t regret this decision.

“Can we stay and smoke for a little longer?” Calvin asked. “I’m not sure I’m ready to face the world yet.”

The goblin started to cry, her voice cracked in a loud whisper as she told the boys “You can stay as long as you like.”

WTF. 

Few days ago, she showed an account in the red, (but has more than 32k in investments 🙄pic#2) and she's accepting money from people cause she wanted a Starbucks right NOW and didn't have any cash for it and wanted people to ask her husband to send some cash her way... like a fucking teenager princess crying over something she doesn't NEED. She's asking for charity for things she doesn't need when others are really struggling.
 I don't care if it's only 20$, Starbucks isn't a NECESSITY. You don't have cash for it, make yourself a coffee at home like every body. 

She's such a fucking diva and people are falling into her ""I'm broke"" traps even when she says she's putting all her money in investment and her husband pays everything they need.  She says she doesn't have cash problems. 

Why the fuck would you go cry about wanting a Starbucks or gifts for your kids when you can easily pay for all that yourself? 

Some families are really struggling to put food on the table and she's playing the poor victim but at the same time she admits having not financial problems lol.

1p45l9x,https://i.redd.it/btlz1j4osv2g1.jpeg,The myths of Rhodesia (and benifits of African colonialism),"A common talking point amongst people on the fanatic right Is how Africans are “incapable of governing  themselves“ and the White scale progress of nations like Rhodesia (that only lasted 14 years) but is this true? Looking at the metrics 

Between Rhodesia and post Rhodesia Zimbabwe in the 90s, here’s what most metrics say was better for the average Zimbabwean. 

**early post-Rhodesia Zimbabwe (early Mugabe era, 1980–mid-1990s) vs Rhodesia (pre-1980), focusing on living conditions for the majority Black population:**

**1. Political Rights**

* **Rhodesia:** Almost no Black people could vote; white minority dominated government.
* **Early Zimbabwe:** Universal suffrage; Black majority could vote and participate in politics. **Winner:** Early Zimbabwe

In detail cause: this was because of Rhodesia had a system with **“white seats” and “black seats”**, but the way it worked was **heavily weighted in favor of** Whites (≈5% of the population) had a **fixed number of seats** in parliament. Blacks (≈95%) technically had seats too, but to qualify to vote for them, you had to meet **strict property, income, and education requirements**. Most Black people could **not** meet these requirements. In practice, this **excluded nearly all the Black majority**.

2. **Education** 

**• Rhodesia**: Segregated schools; whites had top-tier schools, Blacks had overcrowded, underfunded schools. 

**• Early Zimbabwe**: Massive expansion of schools; literacy jumped from \~62% → \~80–85%.  
**Winner: Early Zimbabwe**

**3. Healthcare**

* **Rhodesia:** Segregated and unequal; rural Black areas underserved.
* **Early Zimbabwe:** Rural clinics expanded; life expectancy rose from \~59 → \~61/62. **Winner:** Early Zimbabwe

**4. Economic Inclusion**

* **Rhodesia:** Whites controlled most skilled jobs, credit, and prime land; Black people weee  mostly laborers.
* **Early Zimbabwe:** Blacks gained access to jobs, universities, civil service, and credit opportunities. **Winner:** Early Zimbabwe

**5. Land & Agriculture**

* **Rhodesia:** 70% of best farmland reserved for \~250,000 whites; Blacks confined to poor “Tribal Trust Lands.”
* **Early Zimbabwe:** Early land resettlement programs began; Black farmers gained land for subsistence and some commercial farming. **Winner:** Early Zimbabwe

**6. International Standing & Economy**

* **Rhodesia:** Sanctioned, isolated, military-focused, war-torn.
* **Early Zimbabwe:** International recognition, aid, loans, and investment; relative peace and stability. **Winner:** Early Zimbabwe

**Bottom Line**

For the **Black majority**:

* Rhodesia looked “economically strong” **only for whites**.
* Early post-independence Zimbabwe gave **millions of Black Zimbabweans better political rights, education, healthcare, land access, and hope**.
* So early Mugabe-era Zimbabwe was **far better for the majority than Rhodesia ever was**.

some common rebuttals: 

1. but Zimbabwe became poor after? (Congo, embargo’s) yes but that was later and that was mostly due to the Congo war and the trade embargos aswell as the history of land reform which unfortunately under Rhodesia people are not trained to use the equipment even though the society was highly illiterate it’s a completely different skill. 
2. what about today? GPN HDI wise it’s pretty much the same as it was during Rhodesia but now it’s more accessible for everybody and things aren’t racially skilled and the average Zimbabwe isn’t making extra nothing anymore. Don’t get me wrong. That is so bad but development doesn’t happen overnight

There’s a shockumentary called African Addidio and basically reaffirm the uncivilised Africans narrative needing to be saved by Europeans and or westerners, obviously perhaps the most acclaimed critic ever Robert Ebert called it deeply racist and it has been confirmed countless times about how the film conveys it phrases message to editing and by leaving out very important context. What’s even crazier is that the idea that said in its opening line “The purpose of this film is only to bid farewell to the old Africa that is dying and entrust to history the documentation of its agony.” After colonialism. 

But as with the case was Zimbabwe most if not all African countries have done better post colonialism then during it in fact colonialism brought little to Africa as a whole. To give 5 countries as an example. 

**Kenya**

* *Colonial period:* Education mostly for elites, literacy <20%, railways mainly for exports (tea, coffee), life expectancy \~40.
* *Post-independence:* Literacy \~81% today, life expectancy \~66 years, expanded hospitals, roads, and schools; poverty still \~36%.

*Nigeria* 

* *Colonial period:* Limited education for locals, focus on resource extraction, life expectancy \~40–45.
* *Post-independence:* Literacy \~62% today, life expectancy \~55–60, more hospitals and infrastructure, though inequality remains high.

**Botswana**

* *Colonial period:* Sparse education, low literacy (\~10–15%), life expectancy \~40, minimal infrastructure.
* *Post-independence:* Literacy \~88%, life expectancy \~69, strong economic growth from diamonds, expanded healthcare and roads, poverty \~20%.

**Tanzania (Tanganyika/Tanzania after 1964 merger)**

* *Colonial period:* Limited education, railways mainly for exports (copper, sisal), life expectancy \~40–45, few hospitals.
* *Post-independence:* Literacy rose dramatically (adult literacy \~77%), life expectancy \~66, expanded schools, hospitals, and rural infrastructure. Poverty remains (\~26%), but most social indicators improved.

Heck even Congo 

**Colonial period (Belgian Congo):**

* Belgian rule was extremely extractive and authoritarian.
* Education for the native population was minimal; literacy was very low.
* Healthcare access was poor, and infrastructure mainly served **mineral extraction and colonial interests**, not the Congolese population.
* Life expectancy \~38–40 years.

**Post-independence (DRC):**

* Initial improvements in literacy and health occurred, but political instability (Mobutu’s dictatorship, civil wars), corruption, and conflict **severely limited long-term development**.
* Life expectancy rose to \~61 years, literacy \~77%, but poverty remains widespread (\~73%), with major regional disparities.

Even just using common sense if Europe truly built so much infrastructure, and created such a high literacy rate, and created so much peace. Then why is there no infrastructure today in most of these places that the European supposed to be built? Why are there so many uneducated people? When Wide scale urbanisation happens it is very rare for it to completely turned back even under the worst situations these aren’t ancient ruins. 

Certain people like to portray the issues of the world on “vibes”. Things such as philosophy, inheritanct differences, culture or whatever boogie Man they can conjure. They’ll make it seem like it’s some kind of wide scale ideological battle where in reality it’s religious Corporal greed and the institutions that people serve that is causing a lot of of our issues and the simple answer is just the regulation of wealth.

All my life, I have swung between either getting so obsessed with something I do or being a chronic procrastinator. Growing up, I was always told I am the smart one because I always got good grades, and I had a great memory. I was called the overconfident one by school teachers because they believed that if I tried a little more, I could do so well, but I was just too lazy to try, and so did my parents. In reality, I never was able to sit with my textbooks, I would doze off in minutes. I would lose marks just because of silly errors, like copying the wrong number from the question paper or reading the question wrong. I got away with the exams only because I was super attentive in class and proactive with my projects, and that was enough. 

But the strange thing is I have never been able to stick with learning anything consistently. My parents tried to make me learn everything from music to languages to tennis, and the list goes on. I still am not sure if that was a concentration or discipline issue, but my parents didn't notice it because I spent most of my time alone doing my own thing without creating trouble and being the good child and getting good grades anyway. I have always felt like an imposter when my parents or teachers talk highly of me, while I really didn't do the work but still somehow managed to do so well. My brain and my ideas have always felt disorganised and I want the best in everything I do. I try to put too much into the same thing. Let's say I am doing a artwork, I want to add everything and it ends up being clumpsy. I mismatch and create outfits from two different sets. My ideas or the way I talk are never linear and head on but so branched. 

When I went to university, I was so confident and proactive that I could walk up to people and ask for any opportunity I could take. I joined a lab, and that was the first time I felt challenged by my own self. I was miscalculating/understanding simple things or logic and making errors, sometimes too lazy to learn things properly as well while I was still doing well with the academics. Later on, this work ethic started infecting me. I got a prestigious internship opportunity, but I learned nothing from it. I was too busy handling my own introspective thoughts, low self-esteem and overthinking in my head while I was sent abroad to learn something. Again, I got my master's with full funding, but during this time as well, my mental state was messed up, and I spent the whole time with brain fog, overthinking that I didn't quite learn anything from the two other internships I did.

The pattern is that I get too excited about the opportunity, but by a week's time, I would be very bored and half ass it and drain in my thoughts and procrastinate. In the second year of my master's, I got depressed, mostly because I was living alone abroad, and I developed a tendency of perfecting to overcompensate my slackness and ended up with anxiety. I had to take therapy to stop being suicidal. Though I got a 3.9 in the first year, because of my thesis, I couldn't get a distinction, and it shattered my self-esteem completely. It was my dream to do a PhD, but now I just developed a phobia towards academia and loneliness.

Now I work as a barista in a cafe to pay my bills because I feel like a failure to go home. But the part that really hurt me is that I am too bad as a barista. Same thing, not able to concentrate, zoning out, memory issues, making simple silly mistakes, and making my manager mad that she yelled at me and then apologized for it. Two people who started with me finished their training while I still suck at it. People assume that I am smart, that I studied at a great university and stumble at me being so stupid at basic things really hurts my self-esteem. 

If I do so well academically, extroverted, and street smart, why am I so stupid at basic intelligence? When a person suddenly asks me to calculate a simple math, I completely zone out. Similarly, I go blank during card or memory games. When a person instructs something and I start doing something else, the memory of that instruction slips away, though I have attentively listened to it. People, including my mom, sometimes think I deliberately do it, but I really forget, just like that. If you would ask me what I had for dinner last night, I would blank out. I can't focus on what I am doing when someone is talking to me. Similarly I am read or write while listening to music.

I get a good sleep of 8-9 hrs. I eat healthy with every meal with balanced macros. I am working 30 h a week, so that checks physical activity as well, and my blood tests came fine too (haemoglobin on the verge). I feel too sluggish when I don't have coffee but when I take I feel so anxious and get palpatations. So I drink it only when I absolutely have to.

I am tired of feeling sorry for myself. I want to get better. I want to get out of my head. I am so stressed out right now because I am applying for job and phd simultatenously while also doing a physical job. Everything feels to tiring and I don't get time for myself, but I have no option but to get through it.

The countries are DRC, Chile, Jordan, Mozambique, Vietnam, Namibia, Norway, Gabon

It would have a population of 280 million people and an area of 5.8 million sqr kilometers. The main bottle neck here is cobalt which only to very populated countries have, DRC and indonesia Uranium and potash/potassium were also a problem which made me have to add namibia and jordan. if it wasnt for those 4 resources I could cut the population by almost half and the area by 3/5ths. This country would also have to cut a bit on oil consmption. like half the EU average, but since its is a lithium and cobalt powerhouse i dont think its that much of a problem.

Do you think we can go smaller?

1p45hab,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1p45hab/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

Bouquet: Most traditional. Opens too sweet; strange sweet plasticy laundry detergent, but gets better. Powdery floral, clean musk. Solid and easy to wear.



Matcha: Least favorite. Screechy, cardboard like 'gourmand'. Smells like many rice, cereal, popcorn etc. gourmand of the past years. Smell is just ok, feels cheap. Not as milky or green, and not as good as the Margiela Matcha.



Latte: Most surprising and favorite. Leans wayyyy heavier into the lavender/aromatic side than expected. Faint milky coffee smoke/steam, but more like a sweet take on TF Beau de Jour/men's cologne, than a gourmand.



Santal: Everyone says it's Valaya, but its less clean, way sweeter; more like a bad dupe or flanker of it. Love the opening (citrus + sweet), but the drydown goes wrong on my skin. Has good moments, but most disappointing one.



Also, didn't mention it in any of the reviews, but these are not strong performers. Hard to judge off 1 wear, but none felt all that long lasting or as strong as many previous Kayali.",1,1763848553.0,newfragrances,0,1.0,False

I’ve got a couple close friends, but as an introvert, I tend to keep my social circle small and spend my evenings and weekends hanging out at home. 

When my friends and I do plan things, I do my best to bring fun and laughter where ever we go. 

Unfortunately, I am the single one of the group. So, often times my friends get busy with work and spending time with their partners/kids.

This is why I’m hoping to find a new group of friends (preferably single) to hang with; so I can keep having fun and not isolate myself at home. 

Things I enjoy - Video games, grabbing coffee, watching tv shows/movies, grabbing food and drinks, traveling, working out (considering LA Fitness), going on walks, shopping, and game nights (trivia/humor games). 

Along with being an introvert, I’m also kind of a nerd/geek. Essentially, if you enjoy any 90s tv/movies, we’ll probably get along. While I don’t always go, if you’re someone that likes to hit up Twin Cities Con, I’m sure we’ll find something in common. 

Anyways, if your friend group has room for one more, please feel free to send me a dm. All I ask, is that you have a bio with your age listed, as I’m looking for friends in their late 20s-mid 30s; and to please send more than just, “Hey, how are you?”.

LAUREN'S POV

I knew today would fall apart but hearing it from my daughter made it worse.

“Mommy, do you think Daddy forgot again?”

That question hit me harder than I thought it would. I looked up from the sink, where I’d been rinsing off Elena’s cereal bowl. Her voice was soft, like she already knew the answer but wanted to hear something else. Anything else.

I dried my hands on the dish towel and walked into the living room. There she was, sitting on the edge of the couch in her pink dress, the same one she’d picked out two weeks ago just for today. Her legs dangled above the floor, her shiny black shoes tapping gently against the couch.

“No, baby,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “Daddy’s just… running a little late, that’s all. He said he’d be here before five, remember?”

She looked up at the wall clock. It was already quarter past six.

“He said that last year too,” she mumbled, eyes drifting toward the window. “And he never came.”

I swallowed the lump forming in my throat. She remembered. I didn’t have the heart to lie to her, but I also didn’t want to crush whatever little hope she was holding on to.

“Elena,” I crouched down beside her, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. “I know he missed last year, but he promised he’d make it up this time. Maybe something came up at work. Grown-up stuff can be really… complicated sometimes.”

She didn’t answer. Just kept staring out the window like she was waiting for a miracle to pull into the driveway.

I stood up and rubbed my palms down my jeans, trying to stay calm. Inside, I was burning. Not just from today but from everything. Every missed birthday. Every forgotten school event. Every night Elena asked me where he was and I had to pretend like I knew.

I reached for my phone and dialed Ethan's number but he wasn't picking up.

The clock struck 6:30pm and I already knew Ethan would come home late. Elena's face was already pale and she looked tired from sitting at the exact position for so long. There was no need for her to keep on waiting for her father who couldn't keep his promise.

“Rosa,” I called out.

The maid poked her head from the hallway.

""Yes ma'am.""

""Can you help Elena change into her nightwear, please?”

Elena’s face dropped, but she didn’t fight it. She just slid off the couch and followed Rosa upstairs quietly, dragging her feet as she went.

I sat down, staring at the empty doorway. The silence in the house felt heavier than usual. I picked up my phone and checked the time again. 6:47 PM. Still no text. No call. Nothing.

I sent him a quick message: “Ethan, where are you? Elena waited all day. You promised.”

Still no response.

The hours passed slowly. I sat on the couch, scrolling through the same old photos on my phone, the ones where we actually looked like a family. Back when Ethan used to smile for real. Back when he used to come home early. Back when he looked at me like I was more than just… background noise.

At 8:20 PM, Rosa came back downstairs.

“She’s asleep, ma’am. Didn’t touch her glass of milk.”

I nodded. “Thanks, Rosa. You can go rest.”

I climbed the stairs slowly, peeking into Elena’s room. She was curled up in bed, still in her dress. I was sure she refused to take them off. Her arms wrapped around that old teddy bear Ethan gave her when she was a baby one of the few things he actually showed up for.

I walked over and gently pulled the blanket over her. She didn’t even stir.

“Happy birthday, baby,” I whispered, kissing her forehead. “I’m so sorry.”

Back downstairs, I waited. The clock ticked past 9, then 10, then 11. I didn’t even realize how late it was until the numbers turned to 12:00.

I almost didn’t hear the front door click open.

I shot up, my heart racing. It was him.

Ethan stepped inside like nothing had happened. Coat in one hand, phone in the other. He didn’t even look surprised to see me still awake.

“Where the hell have you been?” I said, voice high but shaking. I can't remember the last time I raised my voice at him but right now I didn't care how high my voice was.

He blinked. “I told you, I had a lot going on at the company lately.""

“Don’t.” I held up my hand. “Don’t you dare say that again.”

He sighed, like I was the one being unreasonable. “Lauren, I had a long day, alright? I’m tired, and I really don’t want to do this right now.”

“No. You don’t get to walk in here and act like nothing happened. Your daughter sat in that living room all dressed up, waiting for you. She kept staring at the clock like you were going to burst through that door with balloons and hugs. And you never came.”

Something flickered across his face maybe guilt, maybe just discomfort. But I saw it. I knew that look. He forgot. Again. Just like last year.

“She told you every morning for the last two weeks that today was her birthday. She counted down on the fridge calendar. She talked about it nonstop.”

“I was busy, Lauren.”

“Busy with what? That you couldn't pick my call or reply to my messages? You run your own business Ethan. You set your schedule. You could’ve made time if you wanted to. One day. One damn day for your daughter.”

He looked away, jaw tight. “I’m not doing this.”

He turned to walk past me, but I reached out and grabbed his arm and he quickly turned. There was a faint scent of something sweet and unfamiliar — not his and definitely not mine. That’s when I saw it.

A faint pink lip stain on the collar of his white shirt.

Lipstick.

I stared at it. The world around me dimmed for a second, the silence roaring in my eyes.

 “Who is she?” I asked, barely above a whisper.

CHAPTER 002
LAUREN'S POV

“Who is she, Ethan?” I asked again, louder this time, my voice shaking.

Ethan’s eyes darted to the side like he was thinking of what to say. “What are you talking about?” he said finally, blinking like I’d just accused him of something crazy.

I pointed at his collar. “The lipstick. It’s not mine, Ethan. So again, who is she?”

He looked down slowly, like he was just noticing it for the first time. There it was. That soft pink smudge stood out against his white shirt like a slap to my face.

“Oh,” he said, brushing at it. “That? It’s nothing. One of the girls at the office… she tripped or something and bumped into me. Maybe it got there then.”

I stared at him. “She tripped? Onto your collar?”

He shrugged like it wasn’t a big deal. “It was just a stupid accident, Lauren. Don’t start making something out of nothing.”

“Don’t talk to me like I’m stupid,” I snapped.

He sighed like he was already tired of the conversation. “Here we go again. You always do this. You always jump to the worst conclusion. You blow everything out of proportion.”

I blinked, stunned. “So now it’s my fault?”

He stepped past me and dropped his coat on the couch. “I don’t have the energy for this right now.”

I followed him. “No, you don’t get to walk away and pretend this isn’t happening. Our daughter waited the whole day for you. I waited. And you show up late, smelling like a woman's perfume and with lipstick on your shirt, and I’m supposed to just swallow it?”

He turned sharply. “Jesus, Lauren, it was nothing. You’re so dramatic. You always have to make everything a scene.”

“Because you keep giving me scenes!” My voice cracked. “You forgot her birthday again, Ethan. How many times does that make it? Two? Three?”

He rubbed his hands down his face and looked up at the ceiling. “I said I was busy.”

“No, you said you’d be here,” I said quietly. “And you weren’t. Again.”

He didn’t answer that.

I felt something inside me fall a little lower. It was always like this — me begging for scraps of honesty while he acted like I was imagining things.

I looked at him. I mean, really looked at him. Same face I used to love since college. Same brown eyes that once looked at me like I was his whole world. But now… it was like there was a wall between us. One I couldn’t break through no matter how hard I tried.

He started walking toward the stairs.

“Where are you going?” I asked.

“I’m taking a shower,” he said, not even looking back.

""Won't you have dinner?""

""I’m not hungry,” he replied coldly.

I watched him disappear up the stairs, my whole body feeling heavy. I stood in the middle of the living room with my arms crossed, trying not to cry. Maybe he was telling the truth. Maybe I was just overthinking it. It could’ve been just an accident, like he said. Ethan wouldn’t cheat on me… right? We’ve been through too much together. He wouldn’t hurt me like that.

Then my phone pinged.

I reached for it slowly, not expecting much. Probably an email or some discount code.

But it wasn’t.

It was a message from Tessa my best friend.

Tess💗: “Lauren… I wasn’t sure if I should send this, but I think you need to see it.”

She added a link.

My stomach turned. Tessa wouldn’t send me gossip. Not unless it was serious. My fingers hovered over the message.

I tapped the link.

The browser started loading. My heart pounded so loud I could barely hear anything else. I paced the living room while I waited, rubbing my fingers against my forehead.

The screen lit up slowly. First the headline.

“Prominent Businessman Spotted Getting Cozy With Mystery Woman at Rooftop Lounge”

I blinked.

My hands started to shake. I scrolled down, my breath catching in my throat.

The page was still loading the image.

Part of it came into view the back of a man in a suit. He was leaning in close to a woman with long dark hair, her lips almost touching his cheek. The rest was blurry.

I stared. My brain started screaming at me to stop. But I couldn’t. I needed to know.

Suddenly, a message from Tessa popped up again.

Tess💗: “Lauren… I think it’s Ethan. I’m so sorry.”

I sat down hard on the couch. My legs couldn’t hold me anymore. My heart was pounding in my chest like it was trying to break free.

Please, God, don’t let it be him, I whispered inside my head.

The image was still loading, slowly getting clearer. I could make out more of the man’s jaw now. The angle of his chin. The curve of his ear.

I knew that face. I knew it like the back of my hand.

It was Ethan.

My heart dropped. It felt like someone had reached into my chest and squeezed it until it cracked. I covered my mouth with both hands. Tears spilled down my cheeks before I even realized I was crying. The kind of crying that just… happens. Quiet. Shocked. Crushed.

The article said it was taken just a few hours ago. Tonight.

The smudge on his collar wasn’t just some stupid accident but it came from the mysterious woman whose face hadn’t been clearly captured.

I leaned forward, elbows on my knees, phone still glowing in my hands.

How could he? How could he do this to Elena? To me? After everything? After the sacrifices I made for him to build that company that made him who he is now.

Then I heard a soft, small sound. Like a whisper.

“Mommy?”

I froze and looked up. Elena was standing on the stairs, hugging her teddy bear, eyes wide with worry.

“Mommy… why are you crying?”

CHAPTER 003
LAUREN’S POV

I wiped my cheeks fast and tried to smile. I didn’t want Elena to worry.

“Just something in Mommy’s eye,” I said softly.

She didn’t look convinced, but she nodded and came down slowly, hugging her teddy bear tight. She climbed onto the couch beside me and leaned her little head on my shoulder. I held her close, breathing in her soft baby shampoo scent, trying to hold myself together.

“Did Daddy come home already?” she whispered.

I swallowed the lump in my throat. “Yeah… he’s upstairs. He didn't want to wake you when he came in."" I lied.

Ethan didn't even attempt to go into her room and at least check on her.

She didn’t say anything after that. Just sat there quietly until her eyes started to droop again. I carried her to her room and tucked her in gently.

I kissed her forehead and whispered, “I love you more than anything, baby.”

When she was finally asleep, I went into the master bedroom. Ours. Well, used to be ours.

The bed still looked neat, untouched — Ethan hadn’t slept in it for weeks now. He said he needed space. Said work was too stressful, and he didn’t want to keep me up when he came in late.

I sat down on the edge of the bed, staring at the floor. My chest felt tight, and the remaining tears I’d held back because of Elena's presence came rushing in like a storm.

I curled up, pulled the blanket around me, and let it out. Silent, broken sobs that hurt deep in my ribs. The kind that no one hears. The kind that makes you feel completely alone.

I cried until the pillow was wet. I must’ve fallen asleep sometime after three or four. The sky was already starting to brighten when I finally closed my eyes.

When I opened them again, the room was filled with soft daylight. My head felt heavy. My eyes were swollen. I reached for my phone to check the time. It was past 10.

I sat up slowly, brushed my hair back, and went downstairs.

The house was quiet.

“Mrs. Lauren,” Rosa said gently from the kitchen. “I took Elena to school. You were sleeping so deeply, I didn’t want to wake you.”

I nodded. “Thank you, Rosa.”

She gave me a small smile and kept wiping down the counter. I walked into the living room and saw her tidying up. That’s when she noticed something on the coffee table.

“Oh,” she said, picking it up. “This looks like Mr. Ethan’s.”

I looked closer. It was his silver USB drive — the one he always kept on his keychain. He used it for work. Always said it had important files on it.

Rosa frowned. “He must’ve dropped it.”

Right then, her phone buzzed. She answered quickly, nodding as she spoke in Spanish. Then she turned to me. “That was Mr. Ethan. He asked if we had seen the USB. I told him yes.”

“And?”

“He said I should drop it off at the office and leave it at the front desk.”

I stayed quiet for a second. He had to call the maid instead of his wife — I was used to it by now. It wasn’t like it was anything new. ‘I’ll take it,’ I said.

Rosa looked surprised. “Are you sure?”

I nodded. “Yeah. I’ll go.”

She didn’t ask any questions. Just handed it to me and said, “Be careful, Mrs. Lauren.”

I went upstairs, got dressed slowly in jeans, blouse, nothing fancy. Just enough to look presentable. My hands shook a little as I brushed my hair.

I drove to Ethan’s office. My fingers gripped the steering wheel too tight the whole time. I kept thinking about that photo from last night. That soft pink lipstick. The way he had lied and made me feel crazy for asking.

When I walked through the glass doors of the building, and got to the CEO level the front desk secretary looked up and froze for a second. She clearly recognized me. Her smile was tight and nervous.

“Mrs. Black,” she said. “Uh… Mr. Black is in a meeting right now.”

I tilted my head. “Is that so?”

“Yes, he’s...he’s not available at the moment. And he asked not to be interrupted. But I take your message, if you like. And inform him when he's done.""

Her voice was polite, but the look in her eyes wasn’t. It was like she was trying to warn me. Like she knew something and didn’t want me to go any further.

But I didn’t stop. I didn’t even answer her. I walked past her and opened the door to Ethan’s office.

And there he was sitting on the couch, relaxed, smiling. Sitting right next to him, too close, was a woman I didn’t recognize at first.

She was laughing softly, her hand resting on his arm like it belonged there. Like it had been there a hundred times before.

My heart dropped.

He didn’t even hear me come in at first. He looked up when the woman paused mid-laugh and glanced toward the door.

When our eyes met, something in his face shifted — not guilt, not shame. Just surprise. Like I’d interrupted something slightly inconvenient.

But it was the woman who held my focus.

Her face. Her eyes. The way she tilted her head when she smiled — something about it felt familiar.

And then it hit me.

College.

Ethan's ex-girlfriend Sofia Crane. The popular girl Ethan used to be crazy about. The one he always chased until she left him high and dry. Back then, she had everything — beauty, money, connections.

I remember hoping she’d stay gone. After she broke up with him and made him the talk of the school then. That she’d never come back into his life. And now here she was.

Sitting next to my husband in such an intimate position.

Everything inside me turned cold. My hands clenched the USB so tight I thought I’d snap it in two.

CHAPTER 004
LAUREN’S POV

Ethan looked up, his smile dropping fast. He frowned, like he was annoyed. Like I was the one doing something wrong.

“What are you doing here, Lauren?” he asked, standing up slowly. He didn’t even look surprised to see me. No smile, no warmth, just those cold, annoyed brown eyes.

I held up the USB, my hands trembling. “You left this,” I said, forcing the words out of my mouth.

“I told Rosa to bring it,” he said sharply. “Not you. You shouldn't have bothered coming.""

That was the first thing he said. Not thank you. Not are you okay? Not even a quick lie to pretend he cared about my feelings. No, he was mad that I came instead of the maid.

I blinked, staring at him. “That’s what you’re upset about?”

He said nothing. Just stood there, his jaw tight.

Before I could say another word, the lady sitting beside him spoke.

“Ethan… who is she?”

Her voice was smooth, soft, almost mocking. I turned to look at her. She crossed her legs slowly, like she was in no rush. Her nails were painted a pale pink, and the way she looked at me made my skin crawl.

Ethan didn’t answer right away. I turned to him, heart pounding in my chest, waiting for him to speak. But he just opened his mouth, then closed it again.

So I answered for him.

“I’m his wife,” I said quietly. I held up my left hand and showed her the ring.

But then I looked down at Ethan’s hand. It was bare. No ring. No sign he’d ever worn one to work.

My chest felt like it cracked open. That moment hit me so hard, I almost forgot to breathe.

“Oh,” the woman said, blinking at me. “You didn’t mention a wife last night when I asked you.”

Last night.

Those two words echoed in my head. Then it clicked, she was the same woman from the photo. The lipstick. The lie. The intern at the company he said not to worry about. It was her. He was with her.

My throat burned.

Ethan must’ve seen it in my face, the way I finally put it all together. That’s when he quickly stepped in.

“Yes, I’m married,” he said, like it was suddenly important now. “This is Lauren. My wife. Lauren, this is Sofia...an old friend from college.”

Sofia.

I already knew. But hearing the name out loud still made my stomach twist.

Sofia turned back to me, and for a few seconds, she just looked. Up and down. Her eyes sharp. Her mouth curled into the smallest smirk as her eyes dragged over my outfit, my hair, my body. She wasn't even subtle about it.

Then she laughed. Just a little.

“Wow! I honestly can’t believe it,” she said, almost like she was talking to herself. “Ethan… really? This is who you ended up with?”

I felt the burn in my face. ""Excuse me?” I said, my voice tight.

She kept smiling like I wasn’t even worth being mad at.

“I mean, no offense,” she said with a shrug, even though offense was clearly the point. "" She's not what I expected. Did you stop caring about appearances completely? She's... so plain. And you’ve gained a lot of weight, haven’t you? You could’ve at least dressed up properly before coming here.”

I froze.

I turned to Ethan. Waiting. Begging silently for him to say something. To tell her to shut her mouth. To defend me, just once.

But he didn’t.

No ""Don't talk to her like that.""

Instead, his face… his face said everything. He was embarrassed of me.

The same man who used to kiss my stretch marks and say they were proof I brought our daughter into the world… now looked like he didn’t even want to be seen beside me.

I looked down at my outfit.

Jeans, blouse, nothing fancy but clean, neat, decent. I wasn’t trying to impress anyone. I came here to drop off his stupid USB, not walk a red carpet.

And no...I wasn’t skinny like I used to be in college. I had a child. I had a life. And I was tired. But I wasn’t ugly. I wasn’t nothing.

I looked up at Ethan again. “You’re really going to let her talk to me like that?”

He didn’t answer.

I felt my knees go weak, but I stayed standing. I wouldn’t cry in front of her. I wouldn’t give her that.

My mind started spinning, pulling me back to college. Back to when it all started.

I was just the quiet transfer student on scholarship. Ethan and Sofia were the golden couple back then. Everyone knew them. They were rich, good-looking, and popular.

Until his family lost their money. And she dropped him like he was trash. I still remember how bad he took it. The whispers in the hallway. The pity. The gossip.

I had liked Ethan then quietly from afar. I never expected him to notice me but one day, he did. He asked me out. Took me for coffee. Talked to me like I mattered. I thought… maybe he was different.

Now here we were.

Full circle.

Sofia was back, sitting in his office like she never left. Like I never existed.

And yeah, maybe I had gained a little weight. But I had also grown a life inside me. Carried our daughter, stayed up through fevers and nightmares, and ran a home while he “worked late.”

Ethan used to say he liked me this way. He used to tell me I didn’t need to lose a pound. “You’re perfect the way you are,” he’d say. “Don’t stress yourself.”

So why was he quiet now?

Why did he look like he agreed with everything Sophia just said?

I held onto my pride and tried to keep my voice from shaking.

“Why are you even here?” I asked, my voice steady. “Why are you sitting this close to my husband? Acting like you belong here?”

She smiled again, but this time, it wasn’t playful. It was cold.

“I have every right to be close to Ethan,” she said simply.

Then she leaned back against the couch like she was on a talk show.

“And,” she added, dragging the word out slowly, “I’m pregnant.”

The room spun.

My legs felt like jelly.

I blinked at her. “What?”

 “I’m expecting Lauren,” she said, placing a hand on her flat stomach. The smirk on her face turned smug. ""Ethan’s baby.”

CHAPTER 005
LAUREN’S POV

Pregnant.

That word rang in my ears over and over again like a siren. My brain heard it, but my heart… my heart refused to believe it.

I turned slowly, like my whole body had forgotten how to move. My eyes landed on Ethan. He wasn’t looking at me. He was staring at the floor like a boy caught stealing. My lips parted, and my voice came out so weak, I barely recognized it.

“Ethan… is it true?”

I prayed – God, I actually prayed in that second that he would look up and say no. That Sofia was just playing a sick joke. That it was a lie. That he didn’t do this to me. To us. To our daughter.

But he didn’t even lift his head. He didn’t say a single word. His jaw clenched, his eyes flicked to the side like a coward, and in that second… I knew. He didn’t have to say anything. His silence hit harder than a slap.

It was true.

She wasn’t lying. Sofia was actually pregnant with his child. And I...his wife was standing there like a fool. Like a leftover.

Something inside me cracked. I could feel it. It started small, like a pinch in my chest, then it spread like fire across my whole body. My stomach twisted. My throat tightened. My legs felt weak. I didn’t cry. I didn’t scream. I just… broke quietly.

In a daze, I turned around and walked out of his office. I didn’t say goodbye. I didn’t wait for an explanation. I didn’t even look back.

Each step felt like dragging cement. My heels tapped against the marble floor, too loud in the silence. The hallway spun a little, but I didn’t slow down. I needed to get out. I needed to breathe.

“Ma’am?” Ethan’s secretary stood up as I passed by. Her face looked worried. She probably saw everything. I could see it in her eyes. Pity.

“Are you alright?”

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. My voice had gone missing. I kept walking, fast, like maybe if I moved fast enough, none of this would be real.

I reached the elevator and pressed the button with a shaking hand. But after a second, I stepped away. I couldn’t just stand there. I couldn’t be still. I felt like I was going to explode.

Without thinking, I turned and pushed open the stairwell door. One step. Then another. I gripped the railing like it was the only thing holding me up.

Down. Down. Just keep going down.

I burst through the exit door and into the sunlight. The bright light hit me like a slap. I blinked hard, trying to adjust, but the world kept spinning. I reached into my bag for my car keys. My hands were shaking so much I dropped them.

“No, no, no…” I whispered to myself as I knelt down and picked them up.

I stood there for a second. My car was just a few steps away, but I couldn’t move. My chest was too tight. My breathing too shallow. My body frozen.

I couldn’t drive. I couldn’t even stand up straight. So I walked.

I didn’t know where I was going. I just turned and walked away from the building. Away from Ethan. Away from the woman carrying his child. Away from the life I thought I had.

People passed me on the street. Cars honked. I didn’t see their faces. Didn’t hear their voices. Everything was muffled and distant.

I kept walking.

Her voice kept echoing in my head. “I’m pregnant.”

And him… the man who swore he’d love me forever. The man I gave up my whole career for, picking up extra shifts so he could build the company he dreamed of – Black Enterprise. The same man who kissed my belly when I was pregnant with Elena and whispered, “You’re my home.” He said nothing. Not even I’m sorry. Not even a lie to hold onto.

Just silence.

My feet hurt. My heels rubbed raw against my skin. My blouse clung to my back with sweat. But I didn’t stop.

I couldn’t.

Because if I stopped, I’d have to think. And if I thought, I’d have to feel. And if I felt… I’d fall apart.

I reached a corner and leaned against a lamppost. My hand gripped the cold metal, trying to stay upright.

The world tilted.

My knees buckled a little. I blinked fast. Everything was spinning. My heart pounded in my ears. My stomach turned. I swallowed hard, but it didn’t help.

Then everything went black.

I don’t remember falling. Just that my body gave up. Gave in. But I didn’t hit the ground.

Someone caught me. Strong arms wrapped around me, lifting me gently.

“It’s okay. I’ve got you. You’re alright.”

The voice was deep.

My head rested against a chest. I could feel the warmth through his shirt. I wanted to ask who he was. I wanted to see his face.

But I couldn’t open my eyes. I was so tired.

“Stay with me,” he said softly.

I tried to speak, but my lips wouldn’t move. Everything felt heavy. My arms. My legs. Even my tears were stuck.

He carried me. I didn’t know where. I didn’t care.

I let myself go.

 All I remember is the way he held me – like I still mattered. Like I wasn’t just someone left behind.

CHAPTER 006
LAUREN'S POV

Beep. Beep. Beep.

That was the first sound I heard as I slowly began to regain consciousness. For a moment, I didn’t recognize it. I didn’t recognize anything. My mind was foggy, floating somewhere between confusion and panic. I had no idea where I was, and my body felt heavy, like it had been dipped in cement.

As my eyelids fluttered open, a flood of bright white light stung my eyes. I winced and turned my face to the side instinctively. That’s when the smell hit me — antiseptic, sharp and sterile, mixed with a faint trace of something metallic. The beeping beside me became more consistent now, matching the rhythm of my unsteady heart.

Then it hit me.

I was in a hospital.

The moment that realization clicked, I sat up quickly — but instantly regretted it. A sharp, splitting pain surged through my head, forcing a gasp from my lips. My hands flew to my temples as I leaned forward, trying to ride out the wave of pain. It felt like my skull was being cracked open from the inside out.

I stayed like that for a few long seconds, eyes squeezed shut, until the ache began to ease. Finally, I allowed myself to breathe. When I opened my eyes again, the lights didn’t sting as badly, and my vision — though still slightly blurry — was beginning to return to normal.

Everything around me was white or light gray. The ceiling tiles, the sheets, even the walls. The monitor beside me blinked slowly, keeping time with the beeping I now recognized as a heart monitor. I looked down at myself — IV needle taped to my arm, hospital gown loosely draped over my body. My mouth felt dry, like I’d been sleeping for days.

Where… What happened?

I searched my brain, trying to piece the last few hours together. Then, the door creaked open, and a nurse in light blue scrubs stepped into the room. She looked down at her chart before glancing up at me.

“Lauren? Lauren Black?” she asked gently, as if unsure whether I was even conscious.

I stared at her for a second, disoriented.

“…Yes,” I answered, my voice rasping. It didn’t even sound like me. “Why am I here?” I added, barely above a whisper.

The nurse walked closer, checking the monitor beside me. “You passed out due to an extremely high level of stress. According to the doctors, the stress triggered something in your brain — causing you to collapse. You’re lucky someone found you when they did.”

Her words hung in the air for a moment. Then, like a dam breaking, everything rushed back into my mind.

I was walking. That much I remembered. The sidewalk beneath my feet, the weight of the day pressing heavily on my shoulders. Then — dizziness. My steps faltered, and I leaned against something maybe? And just before the world faded out, someone caught me.

A man.

Yes, there was definitely someone there. I could still feel the strength of his arms lifting me, holding me like I weighed nothing. But his face… it was a blur. The sun had been so bright behind him, it washed out his features completely. I couldn’t tell if he was young or old, familiar or a stranger.

So… he brought me here?

I scanned the room again, this time more carefully. No one was sitting in the visitor’s chair. There were no personal items, no half-drunk coffee cups or jackets on the backrest. No sign that anyone had been here waiting for me.

“I was brought here by someone, right?” I asked cautiously, turning to the nurse.

She nodded. “Yes, you were.”

A sense of relief rushed through me. I hadn’t imagined it. I wasn’t going crazy. Lately, the world around me had felt like it was tilting sideways, like nothing made sense anymore. At least this one thing was real.

“And where is he now?” I asked.

The nurse looked at me with a curious tilt of her head. “He brought you in, waited while you were checked in, paid your hospital bill… and then left.”

“Wait — he paid for me?” I blinked, trying to process that.

She nodded again. “Everything. And he didn’t leave a name, at least not with us.”

I stared at her, stunned. “He didn’t tell you who he was?”

“I assumed you would tell us, ma’am,” she said softly, her tone not unkind.

Great, so this person brings me here, pays for my hospital bill, and runs off without even leaving a note of who he is?

Despite what he did that is still very rude, at least he should have waited for me to wake up so I could pay him back, I thought to myself

I looked down at my hand and noticed the clear tube connected to the back of it, snaking up to the drip bag hanging beside the bed.

“You said I passed out because of stress… so is this really necessary?” I asked, lifting my hand slightly and gesturing toward the IV.

“Yes, ma’am. They’re painkillers — for the headaches,” the nurse replied calmly as she noted something on the clipboard she held.

I stared at the drip again, watching the slow rhythm of each drop falling. It felt surreal, lying here hooked up to fluids like I was made of glass and barely holding together. But maybe I was.

The nurse looked up again. “Since you don’t know the good Samaritan who brought you in, is there anyone we can call for you? A loved one… a family member?”

My eyes instinctively scanned the room. That’s when I saw my purse sitting on the couch near the window.

“Yes, I do. Can you please help me with my purse?” I asked, trying to sit up straighter.

She nodded and crossed the room, gently picking it up and handing it to me. I held it in my lap and slowly unzipped it, my fingers fumbling as if the simple motion required great effort. I pulled out my phone, the screen lighting up instantly as I unlocked it and scrolled to my contact list.

My finger hovered over one name — Ethan.

I was about to press it when everything from earlier came rushing back like a slap to the face.

The office.

The silence.

The betrayal.

Not only had he dismissed me, pushed me away like I was nothing, but he had also cheated. He had chosen another woman. And not just that — he had gotten her pregnant.

A sour taste rose in the back of my throat as my grip on the phone tightened. Did he not feel even a flicker of shame? Did he think I wouldn’t find out? What exactly was I supposed to tell Elena? That her father had moved on with someone else and made her a sibling overnight?

My jaw clenched as I stared at his name glowing on the screen.

“Excuse me, ma’am,” the nurse said gently, breaking through my thoughts. Her voice brought me back to the present.

I blinked, realizing my hand was still hovering over the call button. A soft sigh escaped me. As much as I didn’t want to call him, he still needed to know I was in the hospital.

He still had the right to know, didn’t he?

I pressed the call button. The phone rang once… twice…

No answer.

I cleared my throat and tried again, forcing down the tight feeling in my chest.

It rang longer this time. Still, the same outcome.

No answer.

I didn’t want to give him the satisfaction of chasing him down, but I dialed a third time anyway. In my mind, I was practically begging him to pick up.

Still nothing.

Each unanswered call felt like another wound, deeper than the last.

 Why wasn’t he answering? I didn’t have to guess. He was probably with her — Sofia Crane. Of course, he wouldn’t answer. He was too busy playing house with the woman who shattered mine.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **LSU vs. Western Kentucky: Senior Night Shenanigans and Why the Tigers Will Wipe the Floor with the Hilltoppers**

The LSU Tigers, fresh off a victory that kept their bowl hopes alive, host the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers in what might be the most unassuming Senior Night in college football history. Let’s break this down with the precision of a SEC officiating crew and the humor of a student section chanting “WE ARE *NOT* AFRAID OF THE CLOWN!”

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why LSU’s Favoritism Feels Like a Math Test

LSU is a **-3500** favorite on the moneyline, which translates to a 97.2% implied probability of winning. For context, that’s the same odds as a student pulling an all-nighter and still acing a final. The spread is **-23.5**, a number so large it makes you wonder if the bookmakers accidentally included the score from LSU’s 2015 game against WKU (48-20) as a *minimum* baseline. The total is set at **51.5 points**, which is generous given LSU’s offense has scored more than 25 points in a game about as often as a vegan finds ethical chocolate.

Western Kentucky, meanwhile, is a **+13.0** underdog, which is the sportsbook’s way of saying, “We’re not sure how to price this, but definitely don’t bet on these guys.” Yet, the Hilltoppers enter with an 8-2 record and a passing attack that’s as reliable as a coffee shop in the morning. Quarterback Rodney Tisdale Jr., who took over midseason after Maverick McIvor’s injury, has 21 touchdowns and 8 interceptions. That’s a TD-to-INT ratio that would make a rookie NFL QB blush—*if* he weren’t already a dual-threat savant.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Seniors, and the Ghost of Garrett Nussmeier

LSU’s star quarterback, Garrett Nussmeier, is out for his final home game, which is as bittersweet as a graduation speech delivered during a hurricane. Backup Michael Van Buren has filled in admirably, but the Tigers’ offense remains as explosive as a wet firecracker. Their run game, however, has shown flashes of life, with Harlem Berry and Caden Durham combining for 3.2 yards per carry. That’s not elite, but it’s enough to keep WKU’s defense up at night, whispering, “Is this a *run*? Is this a *trick play*? Is this my ex texting me?”

Or to be money-savvy?,"*******!!!!!****This is obviously on an assumption that you have work that in theory allows you to put some money away. I don't mean this to judge anyone's earnings or anything like that.

....my issue is, I never, in my life knew how to save money, but it was never a problem I ""had"", coz i never earned enough anyway. HOWEVER, for the last good 6-7 years I *should* be in a position to put away some money after each payday.

And yet.

I am just so shit with it. I've been tracking my spending- not consistently, what a shocker 🙄- and so much of my money is sort of wasted on food, coz I have no energy to cook (nor space to food prep once a week), or coffees in coffee shops coz I just like sitting there? Or just some emotional purchases.

My friend's mom, whom I've known my whole life literally so she's almost like a family asked me last year whether I have a certain amount of money put away - I'm an immigrant in the UK, so everyone's, not only hers, assumption is that by now i should have enough to buy myself a house if not in the UK (via mortgage ofc), then back home.

But I have almost no savings and a debt on my credit card. I just, for the life of me, do not know how people save! And some of my immigrant friends have like 2 houses here, one back home, etc. I feel like such a loser.

Yes, I have always lived on a single income coz I seem to be incapable of finding a partner, and, yes, for a long time I was helping my parents pay their mortgage (until I found out they've been spending my money on, well, not mortgage...we had an argument and I stopped sending them money and you know what? They're still ok), but still I feel like I should be able to be better at this....

....money seems like yet another thing that is too difficult for me to have a good grasp on.

1p456ks,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p456ks,Iniciante fazendo experimentos: meus resultados,"História: Entrei no hobby há menos de um mês com o objetivo de achar um café que me agradasse mais. Nunca gostei muito de café e quase sempre tomei café solúvel com leite e adoçante. Um belo dia tomei um drip que recebi da minha empresa e achei ótimo, mas não lembro qual era, então recentemente (como estava sem nada pra fazer) resolver investir no hobby do café pra tentar sentir o prazer ao tomar café novamente, mas agora de forma definitiva. 

Cafés: 3 corações Portinari, 3 corações Dark roast. 3 corações minas, 3 corações tradicional, Pimpinela Gourmet, coffee++ geisha, Orfeu clássico, L'or mogiana, kit Bixo. 

Método: em todos fiz bloom de 20-30ml aguardando até 25s e depois completei até 100-110ml que é a instrução que tem na caixa do drip. Nos outros já moídos fiz exatamente o mesmo utilizando o v60 e escaldando o filtro antes de passar o café. Provei primeiro metade e depois a outra metade pra não ficar muito frio, no final provei todos em temperatura quente pra morno. A água foi despejada na faixa dos 95ºC. 

Meu gosto: o mais difícil nessa etapa inicial e dado o meu histórico de nunca ter realmente apreciado um bom café é achar o que me agrada. Ao errar os preparos reparei que a acidez do café não me agrada e também super extração complica porque nem com açúcar o café fica agradável. 

Resultados: é muito complicado fazer um teste imenso desse e sem o conhecimento apropriado dar notas a tantos exemplares, então separei em categorias:
- ácidos demais: 3 corações minas e Portinari de cara já achei com gosto de perfume e não me agradaram. 
- gosto de queimado: 3 corações tradicional parecia o carvão. 3 corações dark roast tem bastante gosto de queimado, mas não foi péssimo. 
- não fede e nem cheira: aqui temos alguns exemplos onde consegui tomar sem problema, mas que não foram exatamente agradáveis. Orfeu, L'or e Bixo Ameaça.
- intragáveis: descobri rápido ao cheirar o café um aroma de fruta estragada que pra mim foi impossível de amenizar mesmo com açúcar. Aqui estão Coffee++ geisha (apesar de mais fraco), Bixo Faria e Bixo Cereja sendo o mais forte. 
- finalmente os que me agradaram: apesar de mais forte, o Bixo Noir foi agradável, o Bixo Caramelo achei bem equilibrado junto ao Bixo Belinha que também achei bem ok, além de uma grande surpresa que foi o Pimpinela Gourmet que pelo preço considero o rei do custo benefício. Mas de longe o melhor de todos foi o Bixo Pudim. Uma doçura muito agradável e foi uma das raras ocasiões onde eu realmente adorei um café preto, coisa que jamais aconteceu. 

Queria saber a opinião de vocês e se alguém tem o gosto parecido para me indicar mais cafés no estilo que citei, pois o Bixo é bem caro pra ficar tomando no dia a dia. Provavelmente pelo custo benefício eu irei tomar no dia a dia o Pimpinela. 

Agora com um norte melhor planejo investir em um moedor e aprimorar ainda mais minha experiência e continuar minha busca.

Namely, a repository of text, interviews, art, and breakdowns of relevant intertextual information.

Recently, I finished The Stranger, the novel Meursault came from, and it truly struck me just how 1-to-1 the behaviors of Limbus' and the original novel's versions of him act.  His mannerisms, his breadth of knowledge, even his relationships it seems, the few times I remember them being mentioned.

I wanted to read through all of his conversations again in order to better compare, but I couldn't find anything well-kept enough to be useful.  If I could, I have a hunch that a lot of the odd ways the novel Meursault is misunderstood by others would be apparent in Limbus'.  

For instance, Meursault is very taciturn in both stories, but the novel's protagonist does have feelings and desires.  They're all mundane pleasures but they're understandable ones: coffee, cigarettes, swimming, even company with someone that loves him.  That last one especially shocked me, he was engaged to be married just days before he killed a man.  I'm genuinely curious whether they're going to keep that detail in Limbus, because if anyone'll be angered by and misunderstand its nature it'll be Heathcliff.

I'm just curious if anyone knows of a resource like that, or whether anyone else here's read The Stranger.",3,1763847981.0,limbuscompany,0,1.0,False

Dan and Amy Part 36

“You owe me reclaiming sex,”

They walk in the house. “So what was your take away from tonight?” Dan asks pulling Amy in close. 

“It was spontaneous, passionate, unbelievably erotic and a touch raunchy. I do have a question though. When was the first time that I made the hair on the back of your neck stand up?”

Dan laughs a little nervously. “Okay you got to understand, I already was intrigued by you, the night you came out here to see the baby animals and have hamburgers and brownie sundaes looking too cute for your own good. You know the picture on my desk of you feeding the baby calf? That was the moment. “
Amy smiled at the thought of the moment. “You were pretty rough with Susan tonight. Why weren’t you that way with me?”

“Do you really want to know!”

“Yes. I think I do.”

“Alexa play Elvin Bishop’s greatest hit. Shall we dance my lady?”

The first line of the song, ‘I must’ve been through a million girls.’ Amy looked at him obviously not impressed. 

“Just wait for the chorus.” Dan says smiling. 

‘Then I fooled around and fell in love’ 

Realization flashed across Amy’s face. “You were gentle because you loved me.”

“Honestly more like infatuated with you. Now I love you.” He spins her around and glides across the kitchen.  Amy pulls close till the song comes to the end. 

Amy smiles, takes Dan’s hand and leads him into the bedroom. They stop in the middle of the room. Amy takes off Dan’s sport coat and sets it aside. Then unbuttons his shirt, slowly. Giving him a kiss after every button. The shoes and socks are kicked aside. Standing there only in his slacks, Amy takes a step back and removes her baby doll dress. She then goes back to Dan and starts to remove the last piece of clothing, his slacks. His cock is standing at full attention when she releases it. She releases a low “mmmm” as she takes her first taste. The trousers are on the floor as Dan steps out of them and Amy leads him to middle of the bed and places him on his back. She joins him and they begin to make out. 

“You are best kisser.” Amy whispers. Dan starts to respond but Amy stops him. She is now laying in his chest, kissing him slow and deep. She slides down kissing his neck and chest. His manhood slides right into her folds. She whimpers as she takes him deep inside her. She rises up and looks Dan straight in the eyes. 

“ You were the ultimate Daddy tonight. You romanced two women tonight and didn’t miss a beat. Calm, masculine and in control of every second.” Dan held his hands up and they locked fingers. “It was incredible watching you please another woman. Knowing it was actually me you wanted.”

Amy begins grind her hips into him.  “Susan tasted so sweet, she was so sexy and really doesn’t know it.” She can feel her orgasm start to grow. “The poor girl had your number and never worked up the courage to call. Her loss is my gain.” She is just at the edge when Dan speaks.”

“You own my heart Baby Girl.”

Those words cause Amy to orgasm, she falls to his chest.  Dan just pulls the sheet over them and holds her tight. They stay like this till sleep overtakes them both. 

XOXOXOXO

The alarm goes off at 6:00 and the routine begins. First they have to untangle themselves from the sheets and each other. 

“Thank you for everything last night Daddy. It was all wonderful.” Amy says with a smile as she slips on one of Dan’s shirts. 

“Only for you Amy.” Dan says. He gives her a kiss and heads to the kitchen to make coffee. 

Amy starts to make the bed and it dawns on her. Her man just called her Amy. Not dear, not sweet heart or Baby Girl. Amy and no one else was around. She storms out of the bedroom and into the kitchen.

“What the hell is the deal with calling me Amy in there!”

Dan turns around and gives her a look that stops here cold. The veins in his neck are popping out. He is doing his deep breathing. She knows he is trying not to blow. 

“I’m sorry Daddy. I didn’t mean to….” She just goes and sits on a chair and waits. This is a storm she wants no part of. This part of him scares her a little. She waits. 

The coffee is brewed and he brings 2 cups of coffee to the table and sits down. He looks Amy dead in the eyes.

“We did a very bad thing to a beautiful lady last night. It was nothing illegal, and she willingly participated but we were wrong. It was all orchestrated, but we should have stopped. As soon as   I figured out she lied to us about being a call girl. We had a woman that needed friends and not whatever we were last night.” Dan takes a long sip of coffee and thinks. Amy realizes he is right and is numb. 

“Susan willingly participated and physically it was phenomenal but I ignored an emotional clue and I feel like a jerk. I’m not that kind of person anymore. I hope.” 

“You’re not.  I feel so guilty. How come you noticed and I didn't.”

“You weren’t the problem. I was. I think she felt like a Mom and didn’t want to be just a mom. She felt our connection and was just along for the ride.”

“So do we cancel tonight?”

“No we have her out her and let her see the unsexy normal side of us. The boring people we are.”

“I will call and check on her after we shower. So are you better?”

Dan smiles. “Yes I am.”

“So can I tease you and fly off the handle like a crazy woman?”

“Could I really stop you?”

“No! What the hell is this calling me Amy? You never call me Amy unless you’re being professional! Then you call us boring! We are anything but boring. I have no time to be bored with you coping a feel every chance you get.”

Dan can’t help himself and starts to laugh. “So what can I do to make it up to you AMY?”

Amy takes his hand. “Shower time DANIEL. I want my hair washed.”

“Can I wash my favorite other  parts too?” 

“You better!”

They laughed and headed to the bathroom. Knowing they need to do better. 

XOXOXOXO 

After they shower, Amy calls Susan. 

“Good morning! How’s Susan this morning?”

“Incredibly satisfied. Not to mention quite sore!” They both laugh. 

“So just double checking you’re coming out here after work for Tuesday night tacos. Nothing fancy. It’s very casual. You get here we will ride around on the side by side, have a margarita and eat. You can just sleep here because we don’t want you driving.”

“That sounds like fun. I’ll let you know when I leave.”

“Susan just so you know. We have no expectations. We are just having a friend out for supper. Anything else is up to you.” 

“Amy, am I supposed to read between the lines here?”

“There are no lines to read between. If you want to we can, if not, there will be great food, drink and conversation. As Dan said, once you find out how boring we are you might have second thoughts.”

Susan laughs out loud. “I can’t imagine you two being boring!”

XOXOXOXO 

The work day flies by for Amy. Only two days left in this week. Gone for a long weekend, then Monday and Tuesday in the office before vacation. Meetings to squeeze in and to reschedule. Zoom calls to be on and packing. Twice. For a wedding and a cruise to Alaska. 

Dan is in and out of the office all day. For business and pleasure. He has to be very careful not to make some of the calls from the office. He never imagined pulling of a surprise proposal would take so much work. 

He calls his partner in crime, Tamera. 

“Good morning Tam how are you?” Dan asks. 

“I think everything is under control. Thank my lucky stars this isn’t the first time these people have done this.”

“Great! Just remember it was your friends who had to cancel due to a health issue.”

“Dan, you don’t have to pay for our trip. Larry and I are just thrilled you asked us to help pull this off.”

“Tam you guys are earning every penny! I could never pull this off alone.  Thank you.”

XOXOXOXO

4:00 rolls around and Dan and Amy are sneaking away.  They stop by and get a few groceries before heading home.

“You get all your work done you wanted today?” Dan asks Amy. 

“Actually was really productive. Another couple of good days we will be ready to leave. How about you?”

“On the phone all day. Between negotiating one deal, closing another and long term planning. I only had a two martini lunch.”

Amy looked at him strangely. “Is that an 80’s reference for a 90’s baby?”

“Yes it is. Take my word for it was funny.”

They grab the groceries and head for home. Shortly after they get on the road, Wyatt calls. 

“Hey Wyatt, Amy and I are on the way home. What’s up?”

“The sale of my business hit a snag with the lawyers today. Going to delay us at least a couple of weeks, it might even sink the deal.”

“You got work booked?” 

“Booked solid. I’m just supposed to start working for you in a couple of weeks.”

“We can make it work on our end. Just keep working and making money. We will figure something out. Even if I have to threaten to buy you out to put the screws to those guys. We are going to be gone most of the next two weeks, then we will figure it out for sure.”

“I’ll keep you in the loop Dad. Talk to you later Amy.”

“Okay Daddy, did you just basically buy a construction company?” Amy asks. 

“Not yet. I want Wyatt in house but a few weeks isn’t going to matter. Besides that if I owned the company I would get my pool and outdoor space sooner!”

Amy rolls her eyes at him. “I mention one time that it would be fun to have a pool to go skinny dipping in and now we are going to have an entertainment space.”

“Like watching you go skinny dipping is going to be entertaining!”

They laugh at the silliness of it and talk the rest of the way home. 

Dan has things to do around the farm so they can be gone over the weekend.  Amy starts supper. She gets a text from Susan that she is 15 minutes away. Amy puts on one of her cute golf skirts on, a tank top and tennis shoes. She looks in the mirror and thought, ‘this is to cute to be boring.’

She goes out and Dan is using the side by side. So goes and gets her Jeep TJ out of the shop. She drove it here the first time she came out and it never left. Susan pulls up, just as Amy was coming around front. Susan gets out of her car and stares. She is wearing a cheerleader skirt, T-shirt and berkinstocks.  

“Get in girl! We got shit to screw up or whatever the guys say.”

They both are laughing as Susan hops in. “I’ve never rode in a Jeep like this!” They take a spin past Dan and head down the laneway to go cruising the back roads. 

“It’s called going topless!”

“Your lying!”

“Google it!”

“I’m not going to Google, going topless in a Jeep! They both laugh. 

They cruise around singing to the radio and laughing. 

“Who’s Jeep is it.” Susan asks. 

“It’s mine. I drove it out here for our first date and never left. Dan has like 6 more in the shop.”

“What do you mean, you never left?”

“You know what that man does in bed. Would you leave?”

“Never!”

They pull back onto the laneway and head towards Dan. They stop and talk for a few minutes. 

“Good idea to get this out and run it around a little. How’s Susan doing?”

“I’m living the dream Daddy! Just got done going topless.” All three laugh. 

“Dinner in 45 minutes.” Amy says as they wave goodbye and head to the house. 

They get in the house and Amy gets ice water for both of them. “We do need to talk about last night. We are sorry we didn’t stop things when Dan figured out you weren’t a high dollar call girl. We are afraid you felt like a mom who didn’t deserve to have fun.”

Susan sighs. “Okay you guys did nothing wrong and everything was fantastic.  I made up the call girl thing to add to the role play aspect of it. Like I had a past.  I’m not going to lie though before we started. I did kinda feel like the ugly duckling, but you guys were so great I forgot about it.”

“Dan will be relieved to here that.”

“I actually can’t wait to go out like that again, but this time we need to wear stockings and slutty lingerie!”

“Now that sounds like fun!”

“Since I’m making requests, I have a fantasy that I want to try tonight.”

“I’m sure we would be game to try most anything.”

So Susan whispers it in Amy’s ear and her eyes grow wide. “That will blow Daddy’s mind.”Amy says with a delighted smile. “Actually I would like to do that to you with or without him!”

“Now, what are we going to do for Daddy since he was so great last night. To thank him.”

“That is easy. The double blow job about caused him to almost blow early.”

“Sounds like Daddy is getting a great appetizer tonight!” Susan says with a wicked smile. 

Amy laughs out loud. “Your sex jokes are as bad as ours!”

Soon Dan comes in. Amy gives him a kiss and sends him to the shower. Dan finishes showering and walks into the bedroom with just a towel on. Susan does a cat call whistle so he does a strong man pose. Amy walks up and kisses him slow and deep. 

“We are going to make this a night you will remember forever.” He gets placed in the center of the bed. One beautiful woman on each side. The towel is tented due to his erection. Susan unwraps the towel and starts the blow job. Slowly kissing up and down his erection.  

Amy whispered in Dan’s ear. “Susan wanted to know what we could do to thank you for the incredible sex last night. I told her a double blow job will blow your mind. Isn’t she beautiful Daddy.”

Amy moves around to between Dan’s legs. Susan is worshiping is cock occasionally taking it into her throat. Amy slides up and knows what will set Dan off. She takes each testicle one at a time into her mouth. Holding it there, then will take both which causes Dan to unleash a river of cuss words. Her finger then finds his star fish and slides right in. Then starts to message his prostate.  Dan moans.

“Oh Fuck, son of a bitch!” 

Dan explodes down Susan’s throat as his whole body orgasms.

 Amy smiles with satisfaction, her man laying there, completely satisfied. She then goes up and kisses Dan.  “Time to go eat Daddy, you’re going to need all your strength later.”

It started with me having the flu, and then a stomach bug (diarrhea), and then the nausea hit me. (Which later found out was post viral gastroparesis). 

I was bed ridden for one week with HORRIBLE nausea. I couldn’t do anything. At this time I was taking gravol which did nothing. When I finally rallied enough to go to the doctor they put me on PPIs and a nausea med. I still had bad nausea but at this point I could then got out of bed. 

Eating was very difficult at first. I felt hungry but always felt so nauseous and eating would often make me feel more nauseous. Once I found out what foods worked for me, I would force myself to eat and in very small portions and often. 

I started doing a lot of research about how to eat, and what foods to avoid and I followed this very strictly. I only ate lean meats, mostly turkey, no butter, only used a little bit of olive oil. Lots of papaya and melon. Eggs. Kefir. No chocolate, coffee, fatty anything. I also only ate easily digestible fruits and veg - baked! 

I started taking slippery elm every day, as well as DGL licorice root, drank lots of coconut water and camomile tea. 

My experience lasted 2 months until I was finally off all meds. First I went off the PPIs, and then the second nausea med I had been put on. 

I felt that other than getting tests done, my doctor didn’t help guide me on how to get better. I asked for a dietitian referral near the beginning and she said no, let’s just wait to get some tests back. 

I was terrified of experiencing that hell for a year, and I’m glad I managed it as well as I could have. 

Sending lots of love and compassion to anyone experiencing it. ",3,1763847842.0,Gastroparesis,1,1.0,False

I also find I have difficulty recognizing noises. I was at the store the other day and anyone who spoke to me got a blank stare. I wear hearing aids, moderate-severe loss at my last hearing check. 

With my family I can usually understand and they will sign if I'm just not hearing what they say or if my aids are out. But it takes so much effort to understand strangers, and usually I find they're in a hurry. The barista at the coffee shop spoke slowly enough in close proximity I did ok.

My loss has progressed over the past 5 years from mild to moderate-severe, and it's across all frequencies, almost a straight line. I don't have any family with hearing loss and it kind of hit me out of nowhere. I have no idea how to be deaf in the world - a support group has been helping some. 

But I found myself wondering as I tried uncomfortably to navigate the world of the grocery store...at what point do you find it advantageous to sort of switch worlds and navigate as deaf or hoh, rather than in the hearing culture you always inhabited? (Obviously my experience will not match everyone's here.) I'm in ASL 3 so by no means fluent, but I'm starting to find deaf resources more and more helpful. I use Nagish to understand on the phone. I'm considering asking people to write back and forth with me rather than continuing to try to understand speech.

I'm just so tired of feeling stuck between worlds. I'm starting to wonder if I could learn to thrive with deafness if I quit trying so dang hard to hear. If you made this transition, what did you do, when, how, and was there a tipping point?",3,1763847828.0,deaf,0,1.0,False

My wife and I were living with her parents and grandmother back when we got married and shortly after recovery from drug addiction. My wife's grandma and I were always the first ones up and would make coffee. She was paticular... 2 table spoons per 6 cups on the pot. She had a tablespoon in the coffee, it was always there. Her and I would always drink our coffee and read the news and bullshit. We bonded heavily. I spent a lot of mornings with her talking history, life, politics, family and everything. She was an amazing grumpy old lady haha.

We moved in and out over the years but I've always held to those standards. Some years back grandma moved to Las Vegas to live with my wifes aunt. She gave me a coffee cup we used to ""fight"" over and the coveted table spoon. An old beat up plastic one from the 80s at least haha. I have been using both ever since. I literally haven't made coffee without that tablespoon in years. 

Christmas morning 2024 we got the news that Grandma had passed. She was 99 years old. Heart wrenching experience 0/10. I had pretty much quit caffeine last year. But, when I wanted it, my trusty scoop and fought over cup were there.

This morning my wife made coffee. I had some for a change and didn't pay much attention. Day goes on, lots of chores etc. Kids are painting and crafting and want lunch. I go to heat up the lunch and notice a metal tablespoon with coffee on it. Hmmm. That's odd, why didn't she use our scoop. I know we don't drink as much and have tried a couple lately but still seems weird. So I start looking. I can't find it. Something clicked and I got nervous. I went and got my wife and asked her and she blew it off. Then got nervous. We looked everywhere and she broke down. She thinks she had it in a bag we were trying and accidentally threw it away. She feels terrible and it's breaking her heart. 

I can't explain it well but I had a breakdown. I was very confused, I had to leave the room. I went into the other room and kind of spaced out and couldn't focus. I spaced out staring at a filing cabinet/metal drawers for a few. Then I noticed I was rocking and rubbing the corner of the cabinet. My mind is still having a hard time processing. My wife feels terrible and is very upset with herself. It was her grandma and she also had always used that scoop.

I'm not sure why this affected me so much, but it did. I didn't realize until it was gone how much of a prized possession that was. I am not a material guy, it's the little things that are important to me. I feel like I lost a little piece of history today.

Would anyone want to join a D&D private club that you have to pay monthly dues for?,"This is long and rambling for a reason.  
TL;DR: anyone want to join a private club that exists in a commercial space requiring monthly dues.  
Why I'm thinking of doing it this way:  
Recently, I've been given a chance to open a business or something in a small little spot in St. Louis Hills, that is both known for it's neat architecture and notorious for the people that previously owned and operated it. The place has been shuttered since the late oughts and frankly it's an eyesore.  
However, the space is pretty small. I was considering opening a record store there, but its only blocks away from The Record Exchange which pretty much has every record ever available...so then I switched to maybe a small snack shack with tapas and wine or something (I do have a culinary degree), but I know for a fact the neighbors would never let a liquor license exist in this space ever again.  
I'm definitely NOT a coffee shop person, I like my coffee black and real. So I ruled that out.  
Finally I settled on gaming. But, I want to drink good beer while I'm gaming. I talked to the new owners and they suggested that I probably could get a ""C"" license that is specifically setup for private clubs.  
So here's what a ""C"" License does:

* You **do NOT sell alcohol**
* Members **may bring their own alcohol and consume it**
* You’re legally covered
* You don’t have to run a bar, manage inventory, or hire bartenders

But you STILL must:

* Apply through the Missouri ATC
* Apply through the St. Louis City Excise Division
* Meet local zoning requirements
* Ensure 21+ compliance
* Have membership and private-club structure documented

Zero pressure, all warmth. They’ve since globe-trotted away, and now here I am, realizing I miss having a human pillow with emotional intelligence.

I’m moderately athletic, extroverted, and apparently give off “calm forest wizard” energy. People tell me I’m easy to talk to, probably because I genuinely love those conversations that hang around in your brain for days like an unbothered cat on a windowsill.

What I’m looking for:
A cuddle buddy. A snuggle homie. A professional-grade human burrito.
Someone who enjoys affectionate, comforting closeness that’s not about sex. Think: movies, deep chats, mutual decompression, head-on-chest moments, and that silent “wow, existing is kinda nice” feeling. I’m also open to more intimate cuddles or connection within boundaries, but I’m not looking to go past that.

We’d meet in public first, coffee, a chill walk, something that won’t make either of us feel like we’re auditioning for a Netflix true-crime episode.

At first you prepare yourself, expecting the same welcome you’ve gotten from the rest of your homeland, only for him to offer you some of his meal. A foreign dish consisting of a sort of meat in a sort of patty-esc shape, placed between 2 pieces of bread.*

*""Hello, Brave Tarnished. Do not fret, I am not an enemy, nor am I native to your home. You could call me a scholar, of sorts... Perhaps a Researcher?” He takes a bite out of the strange sandwich-like dish he’s prepared himself. “Maybe… the details matter naught, in the end…” Enoch brushes the crumbs of bread off his hand and stretches it outward towards you.*

*With a handshake, you introduce yourself. Noticing the tone of circumspection in your voice, he places his hand over his heart. “The Erdtree and your precious Elden Ring are not my interest, if that is what you’re chary of. I am an Avalāriem Knight belonging to the Order of Avalār. I am here to study the Blights in this land, along with assisting this land’s denizens with their troubles.” His voice gets softer, lower, almost like it’s not meant for you. “There is already so much malice in the world, we are not here to add to it…”*

*The sounds of crickets and crackling fire start to fill the empty air, before he finishes his meal. He reaches over, offering you an item wrapped in a delicate cloth. The shape of the gift almost resembling a hook. “I understand that here in the Lands of Gold, you Tarnished are able to use these ‘Furled Fingers’ made of a substance called ‘Corpse Wax’.”*

*Attached to the cloth’s binding is a piece of parchment reading “****Avalar****” in elegant writing. “I also understand that by focusing on a word, it can help you call out to even the strongest of warriors.” Enoch leans closer to you, placing a hand on your shoulder. “If you are ever in need, please do not hesitate to call upon me, friend. I, Enoch Koh, Avalāriem Aegis and Knight of the Order of Avalār, shall be by your side at a moment's notice. Be it for your travels, or battles, my Essence will heed your call.”*

# Konichiwassup, Brave Tarnished

I am an RL713 who can switch between aggressive and supportive combat. Utilizing Erdtree Heal, Warming Stones, Minor Erdtree, Uplifting Aromatics, and a Crimsonburst Dried Tear; I can keep both the Host of Fingers and myself alive to the best of both of our abilities. Combining this with Starlight Shards and Lulling Branches, I ensure that I will stay in the Host’s world for as long as they may need me.

I also do much more than just helping people with Bosses. I heavily enjoy exploring the Open World and Dungeons, seeing things I haven’t before. I’ve played this game a lot and I often find myself going the same routes as I always do, helping people out gives me a chance to see more of this game that I normally would have missed. I also help improvement with PvP and PvE, however I do not claim to be good at any of these things. My primary goal is to be an immersive and fun experience in a game where everything wants to kill you.

# Exploration

I will often stick to the Host, as an NPC would, following and assisting in any combat. When I am accompanying new Tarnished, I will often *alert* my Host by calling out to them. An environmentally aware Host can then follow me to various *Key Items* such as *Golden Seeds*, *Perfume Bottles*, *Scadu Fragments*, and many more. The Host can also inform me of anything they are looking for and I can lead them to it once we are in the area. The DLC is my second home, I spend more time vibing there more than anything, sticking mainly to Rauh and  Belurat/Enir-Ilim. Thanks to this, **I have every** ***Scadu Fragment*** **in the DLC marked on my map**.

# Improvement at Player vs Player?

I can spar with you for as long as you need, I even have an Un-Upgraded Loadout so there is less risk of you dying during live exercises. If you want to get better in certain aspects, I can do that as well. Need to get better against *Invaders*? Summon me as an *Adversary* for various types of *Invaders* you’d run across, in a *Non-Toxic Environment*. Want to get better at being an *Invader*? I can summon you as an *Adversary* and you can get a feel for what’s right for you.

# Improvement at Player vs Environment?

I have a **RL713** character with **+0 Equipment** that I’ve almost beaten the *Base Game* and *DLC* on. Here you can *Explore*, *Fight Roaming Bosses*, or *Vibe with Me*. As a *Cooperator*, you won’t have to worry about losing your *Runes* or *Invaders*, since the RL and Upgrades are so different. Have a friend who wants to get better or just be an *Adversary*? That’s fine too, the more the merrier. ***Toxic Players Will Be Blocked***.

# Communication?

Direct Messages are perfectly ok with me, however I do not do VoIP. Much like most of the Ashes in-game, I don’t typically speak. This is because I’m typically in a party or otherwise unable to use my headset, however I will *rarely* make an exception. ***I do not accept random Friend Requests on a whim***.

# Too Long, Didn’t Read

I Am RL713, Good @ Game, Can Carry, Will Help/Chill/Duel

I am typically online after 2PM CT. Feel free to reply/DM me prior and I will answer ASAP

I got fat. I weighed more than I care to admit before I met my husband. We became good friends, gym partners, we fell in love, and were married.

I lost so much weight before the wedding. I was strength training, calorie counting, and kept protein goals. I was absolutely killing it. I was stronger than ever and close to the lowest weight I have ever been as an adult. More than 50 pounds below my high weight, and dropping. I was never going back to how I was before. Just before the wedding, things came to a bit of a stand-still. I knew I would gain a little weight on our honeymoon, as it was more than two weeks in another country, and I didn't want to worry about the numbers. I wasn't able to get back on track for weight loss after that, but I didn't gain much weight.

Then came the injury. I had a SNAP tear in my labrum, and it extended to my bicep. I went from strength training and a very physical job (heavy lifting and 15-22k steps per day in 12 hour shifts, four times a week) to basically being a stay at home wife. I study, as I have gone back to college, I cook and clean some, and I go to my physical therapy appointments. It has been about five weeks since my surgery, so I still can't do nearly as much as I would like to. I'm not even sure if I'm supposed to be holding a coffee cup with this hand yet.

I'm 5'2"", I hardly leave the house, and I have expanded. I knew that I was gaining weight, and I stopped being comfortable not wearing a jacket to cover up. I didn't realize, until I saw these photos, how bad it had gotten.

I have got to do something, because I can no longer stand the skin that I live in. Back to calorie counting, I suppose. I have always had such a hard time getting on the wagon, but staying on has always been easier for me than starting.",2,1763847371.0,loseit,1,0.75,False

Some of the other techs complained when management asked us to leave the closer spaces for lab personnel. Never made much sense to me. We did most of the physical work, while half their day was spent behind a desk. But I didn’t complain. I’d taken enough orders in my life to know when something wasn’t worth arguing about.

Besides, I knew what the outside was like. I’d spent years in the union—no warm desks, no fresh coffee waiting for you in the morning.

Compared to that, clocking into an air-conditioned space—seventy degrees all year round—still felt like getting away with something.

I held my badge to the reader. It flashed green. In the reflection, I caught the small worn photo on the front: a fresh twenty-eight-year-old me, smiling like an idiot. They must’ve reprinted this badge a hundred times, and every damn time they use the same picture. Doesn’t even look like me anymore.

I scoffed at it and headed inside.

The long hallway flickered awake as the motion sensors caught me. The quiet broke under the echo of my squeaking boots, mixing with a woman’s voice. Up ahead, by the main elevators, a wall-mounted screen played the same ad it had played for months: grainy stock footage of a happy family overlaid with a soft, soothing narrator.

“*Your family can rest easy this holiday knowing Wexler Corp is with you. With our advanced testing technology, we can predict early infection signs and preventive measures. Get your diagnostics today*…”

I rolled my eyes and mouthed the last line along with her. “Helping you find the best version of yourself.”

The ding of the elevator doors was my cue. I stepped inside and descended toward the lower level.

As I passed below the first floor, a noise drifted up—something like a commotion. The elevator slowed. Stopped. On the other side of the doors, someone was speaking, frantic and muffled.

They slid open, and Eddie—night-shift tech—stood there looking like hell. His hair clung to his forehead; he was breathing hard, like he’d sprinted the whole corridor.  This was especially jarring considering how quiet he usually is.

I hit him with the obvious: “What the hell is going on?”

He stammered, “Don and I… we were in the suite… we saw the— the lights, you know? Room pressures were going crazy! The alarms, they’re going off everywhere!”

I held my hands up and stepped out, scanning the hallway. Don stood at the far end, phone to his ear.

“Okay,” I said, “Fucking relax, man. Room-pressure alarms come in all the time. This is normal.”

Eddie squeezed his eyes shut, pressing his fingers to his temple. “No, not just that. The building alarm system never displayed it. It— it must’ve been offline since yesterday, and no one noticed! We went in to work on something and then—”

His eyes shot past me.

“ARE THEY ANSWERING?” he shouted down the hall.

Don lowered the phone and shook his head. “Fuck. Nothing.”

I turned back to Eddie. “Okay, everybody stop. Who are you trying to call? Because if this were any other day, we’d be the people they call to fix it.”

Eddie grabbed my arm, his hand tight on the fabric.

“Daniel,” he said, voice low and shaking. “The freezers have been down. There’s water on the floor.”

The words hit me like a gut punch. My stomach dropped. My mind raced, flipping through emergency protocols I’d never actually expected to need.

I turned to Don. “KEEP TRYING! If they don’t answer, get out of here and block the entrance!”

Don nodded and rushed off.

I faced Eddie again. “Get your shit. We’re going up.”





The elevator numbers rose as my mind raced faster.

1st floor, 2nd floor…

“Okay, so there’s water on the floor,” I muttered. “Could be a leak from the pipes…”

Eddie cut in. “No, man, it ain’t a pipe leak—”

I snapped, “Shhh! Just shut up for a second. Let me think.”

Training after training flicked through my head—nothing sticking. I was an idiot for skipping through half those CBT modules.

5th floor, 6th floor…

“Fuck, man,” Eddie said, voice trembling. “I got my daughter’s birthday tomorrow.” He lowered his head. “You’re already thinking what we’ve all been thinking.”

I didn’t respond.

“DING.” The elevator chimed. 8th floor.

I stared into the crack between the doors—wanting to leave, wishing this was just another rough day.

They slid open. A barrage of alarms and flashing red lights met us. The power on this floor was out; only the red strobes on the ceiling gave us enough light to see.

We moved fast toward the airlock.

“So the backup power failed too?” I asked.

“Never switched to backup,” he said through heavy breaths. “Don’t know why. It’s like this whole floor was never set up right when they built the place.”

We reached the airlock. I scanned my badge and looked through the glass into the lab. A sheen hung in the air, like a light fog.

We grabbed the positive-pressure suits on the wall, skipping half the gowning protocol.

As I pulled the air hose from the wall, I wondered what kind of severance package—if any—we’d get. It was clearly an engineering failure upstream, but they’d still find a way to blame us.

I hooked the compressed air line to my waist and felt the suit inflate. Eddie did the same. We disconnected and stepped through the airlock.

The thick entrance door slid aside, opening into quiet, foggy chaos.

“The dry ice tanks are leaking,” Eddie said over the comm. “That’s why we can’t see shit.”

“That’s the least of my concerns,” I said.

My boot hit the wet floor. I followed the puddle through the fog to the freezer entrance. The heavy, gasketed door sat open. Water flowed from it like a slow bleed.

“Why the fuck is this open? What were you guys doing in here?” I asked, stunned.

“We weren’t anywhere near this thing, man! We just came in to read the room flows!”

I stepped into the walk-in—shelves of vials lining both walls. On the floor, beneath the fog, lay the truth.

I backed out slowly. There was nothing more to see. I shut the door and pulled the latch until it thudded shut.

Eddie watched me like a child waiting to be told the verdict.

“You’re not going to that party tomorrow, Eddie,” I said softly. “Neither of us are going anywhere.”

His eyes widened. “You’re fucking with me. Daniel… what did you see?”

The words left me hollow. “Broken vials on the floor. A whole shelf. They’re mixing with the water.”

“Jesus Christ!” he said, stumbling back. I grabbed his arm before he slipped.

“Stop. Listen to me. You’re safe, okay? You’re wearing a suit. Positive pressure. Nothing gets in.”

He nodded rapidly, holding his breath.

“Breathe, man. You can breathe.” He gasped, tears forming inside his hood.

I knew I’d just given hope to a dead man.

It had been about an hour. We sat on the floor of the airlock across from each other, still in our suits. Eddie stared at the ceiling. I stared at him, picturing his daughter, his wife. He was my age when I first started at Wexler. Probably making decent pay too. I hoped he took the max on his life insurance.

Don still hadn’t checked in. Last we heard, he’d made it to the main gate and was talking to senior officials. They were “aware of the situation.”

“So what do you think caused it?” Eddie asked. “Someone broke something and got scared to tell anyone?”

“No. There was a CO₂ tank in the corner of the freezer. Top was blown off. That’s the fog. It exploded.”

“No way! Who the fuck would leave a tank in there?”

“We use them for general checks. You take one in, refill lines if needed, then head out. Simple. Do it every month.”

Eddie hesitated. “So… did you leave one in there?”

I chuckled darkly. “Yeah, Ed. Guess I did. Really fucking stupid mistake for a senior tech, right?”

“Bro… fuck, man. They’re gonna tear you apart for that. And the CDC’s definitely getting involved.”

“Oh, no doubt. They have every reason to let me go. Guess I just wasn’t thinking.” I swallowed hard.

My walkie lit up.

I grabbed it. “Don, what’ve you got?”

A woman’s voice answered instead. “Hello Mr. Marin. How is everyone feeling up there?”

Eddie and I exchanged a glance.

“Oh, just peachy,” I said. “We’re taking a little extended break. How’re you guys down there?”

Silence.

“Who is that?” Eddie whispered.

“Probably some big wig,” I muttered.

The voice returned. “We’re sending up an SHR representative to take vitals and ask some questions. Please stay put.”

“10-4.”

Eddie frowned. “An HR person?”

I snorted. “No. S.H.R. Synthetic Human Replacement.”

Eddie looked stunned. “Holy shit. I’ve never seen one in real life.”

“Nothin’ special,” I said. “Job stealers. She’s gonna want us to take these suits off.”

“No, man,” he said quickly. “That’s dangerous—”

“We’re in the airlock. You already stepped in here without a suit earlier. It doesn’t matter.”

“I just don’t think it’s safe. We’re dealing with airborne Delta Variant. What if spores got in?”

“Then there’s nothing we can do. We were at risk the second we got here.”

He slammed his fist on the floor. “FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!” His last hit landed limp. Tears filled his eyes. “What am I supposed to tell my family? They’re not even gonna let us out of here. Eveline is gonna be so pissed.”

The elevator doors opened. Through the glass we saw her—synthetic woman, all white jumpsuit, shaved head, skin too perfect. She carried a small bag.

She knelt in front of the glass.

“Hello, Mr. Marin and Mr. Martinez,” her muffled voice said. “I’m going to breach the airlock now. Please stay where you are.”

The doors hissed open. She stepped inside.

Eddie jumped in quick. “What’re you gonna do with us? Are we fucked?”

“Please stay calm, Mr. Martinez. I need you to remove your suits so I can run tests.”

“But are we going to be stuck up here? When will they let us see our family?”

“I can’t answer that right now. I just need your cooperation.”

Defeated, Eddie leaned back. I began removing my suit as it deflated.

She cleaned my arm with a cold pad, her blue eyes empty as the syringe slid into my arm.

“So what’s happening out there?” I asked. “News crews? Hazmat teams?”

“We’ve deployed other SHR units around the perimeter. No human is allowed in at this time.”

Eddie cut in. “What about Don? The night tech?”

“He’s quarantined on the property. I believe he’s undergoing the same tests as we speak.”

She drew Eddie’s blood next and placed both vials into a small machine. The display faced away from us.

A long analog beep sounded. She checked the results, then silently began packing up.

Eddie’s voice cracked. “Hey—what does it say?”

She ignored his request. 

“Thank you for your cooperation.  Place stay put until further instruction.”

“WHAT DOES IT SAY?” he shouted as she walked out.

I should’ve felt something. Fear. Rage. Something. I envied Ed’s panic—it meant he still had something to lose.

I was furious with myself. Furious that my mistake could take a father from his family. Maybe two, counting Don. If I had a gun, I’d hand it to Ed and tell him to shoot me twice.

I replayed it again and again. How could I do something so stupid? I tried convincing myself it wasn’t me—but I was the only one who worked on that freezer. Seven years. SME. Subject Matter Expert.

Doesn’t mean shit now.

“Screw it,” Eddie said. “I’m going out.”

“No. We could be contagious.”

“To who? The robots?” He pushed out of the airlock. “I just want to look out the window.”

He wasn’t wrong, so I followed.

I met him at the 8th floor window. We looked down. The whole parking lot was filled with trucks and white tents. Synthetics moved equipment back and forth. Beyond the gate, emergency lights pulsed in red and blue.

“Holy shit,” Eddie whispered. “We’re never getting out of here.”

A low rumble shook the building. Something slid across the roof. A massive white tarp slowly lowered over the top of the window frame and met the bottom, blotting out the morning light. The hallway went dim.

“They’re tarping the building,” I said.

Eddie turned and ripped a sanitizer dispenser off the wall, hurling it down the hallway.  A voice echoed amongst the destruction.  The TV ad.

“*Helping you become the best version of—*”

 He punched the TV screen beside the elevator, shattering it mid-ad.

Glass spider-webbed under his fist.

I spoke softly. “I’m so sorry, Ed. This is all my fault.”

He wiped his face.  His head hung below his shoulders and his fist still pressed into the glass.  “It’s okay. Shit happens, man. And it’s not all your fault. If the right precautions were in place, this never would’ve happened. You’d think a billion-dollar company could keep up with preventive maintenance.”

He let out a defeated laugh.

“I got a pack of cigarettes in my desk drawer in the lower level.  What do you say we go smoke em?” I suggest.

Ed nods in approval.  “That sounds great.”





My feet rest on the desk in front of me.  The back of my chair adjusted as far as it can lean.

Eddie was playing music out loud on some old computer speakers and blowing smoke towards the ceiling.

The room filled with a relaxing haze.

“Oh…wait.  I gotta perfect one.”  He said as he made a few clicks on the keyboard.  The current music stopped as the song “The End of the World” by Skeeter Davis started in its place.  

Ed leaned back slowly and took another long drag.

I looked his way as we shared a laugh.

“Oh yeah. This is perfect.” I added.

He exhaled and looked towards me in thought.

“Shoot.” I said.

“Who you got wondering where you are right now?”

“Hah. Nobody, man.  I’m a lone soul.”

“You mean no one at all, brothers, sisters, girlfriend?

“Nope.  Kids live with their mother in Colorado.  They hate my guts anyways.”

“Oh shit. I didn’t know you had kids.”

“Yeah, they’re teenagers now.  Mom made them hate me.  Convinced them I was cheating on her.”

“Well, were you?”

“Shit no, man. No.  It was an excuse.  Built up this whole story in her head.  She was looking for a way out.”

“Damn.  I didn’t know.”

“What about you though?  Tell me about your daughter.”

Eddie took a deep inhale. “Man, where do I start? She’s amazing.  Beautiful.  Got her mothers eyes.  She’s what keeps me going every day.  No matter how hard my day is, I know when I get back home, she’ll be fresh out of bed and running to me with a hug.  The whole world just melts away, man.”

“That’s beautiful, Ed.”

He nods silently.  “She gonna be four tomorrow.  I got this Barbie bicycle sitting in the garage.  She’s been asking for it for a year now.” 

Tears fall from his cheeks.  “I really wanted to see her face when I opened that garage door.”

I adjust and lean my elbows over my knees.  The room fills with silence and regrets.

The song comes to a close.

“How long do you think it’ll be?” Eddie asks quietly.

“How long till what?”

“Till we start getting sick.”

I check the watch on my wrist.  “Been about five hours.   Probably mid day.  It’ll come on fast.”

Eddie feels his forehead with his hand and the sniffs deeply.  

“Yeah, I ain’t feel nothing yet.”

We can still feel the rumbling of trucks and helicopters from above.  I wonder what they’re asking over the walkies right about now.  Left it upstairs.  Didn’t see how I'd have much use for it now.

“You know how many hours I’ve given to this company? How many things I missed out on?”

“Tell me about it.”

“If I could take it back, I would get back every time I was supposed to show up.” His eyes look like they’re playing out memories from a past that could have been. 

“I would have fought.” I say.

“I would have fought harder to learn about the new person my wife was becoming.  I would have fought for my kids.  I would have…just fucking tried.  Ya know? 

My words settle like dust on all the surfaces of the room. 

The dimly lit desk lamps flicker.  Now the sounds of commotion receding.  Trucks leaving.  Synth radio communications go quiet.  It's just us.  

A thought crawls into my mind.  

“Wanna go check out some daylight before its over?”

“Walk out?” Ed asks.

“Yeah why not?  Worst they can do is shoot us.” 

He breaks contemplation with a nod of approval.

The halls leading to the entrance are too quiet.  No hum of the circuits.  They’re shutting down power.

We come to the long tarp draped over the doors.  Ed searches his pocket, pulling out a utility knife.  I hold the main door open as he cuts away at the thick tarp.  Daylight breaks through the slit.  Cool fresh air washes across our faces.  It smells so good.  We take turns squeezing through.

I know it was only yesterday since I’ve been hit with sunlight, but for some reason it feels like it's been years.

Outside, to our surprise, we find the parking lot empty.  Half built white tents sit empty.  Some on the ground.  We scan the horizon.  No trucks in sight.  They left in a hurry.

There’s a low hum carried on the wind.  I look up.  High in the empty sky, I spot a single black jet.  It’s moving directly over us.

Both of us, fixed on the jet when I speak, “I know I already said it.  But I’m sorry again, Ed.”

He lights up another cigarette and takes a drag before responding.  

“Don’t worry about it man.”

Their other reasons for why it's not compatible honestly sound really stupid. Examples include noticing that avoidant #1 was anxious when my name popped up on his phone, and the feeling never going away (he refused to tell me anything else), and avoidant #2 said that he was hurt when I said it was gross that he spit on the ground, and the sexual spark went away for him after that, and he didn't like that I was trying to avoid restaurants for a while as I learned to cope with and manage a diabetes diagnosis at 31. Those are especially stupid reasons to end things with someone. We could each get our own food and eat together over a candlelit dinner, or I could get coffee or small snacks, and I even said I would go to the restaurants with him and just get a drink or something small until my bloodwork was better, and that wasn't enough for him, either. These people are impossible. And they make up dumbass excuses for what could have been worked out all because of their fears of intimacy and conflict. 

Neither of them tried to talk anything out with me. I was the one to try to have any kind of conversation. They were both lazy and emotionally unintelligent people. 

I'm autistic, and even I know that love takes consistency and little bits of effort from BOTH people. 

I think some people go through struggle and it gets messy and confusing and they each respond in different ways. To remain in the relationship, both people have to have the mindset that the struggles are the issue, not the partner. Unfortunately, in my recent experiences, when struggle hit/the honeymoon phase was over, I got dumped. I have not found a person who both initially liked me and wanted to continue to grow with me. 

And I think we all deserve better than that.

The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip.

I’m tired. Not the kind of tired that a good night’s sleep can remedy, but a deep, soul-wrenching fatigue that has taken root in my bones and refuses to let go. I sit at my battered, cluttered desk, feeling a complex mixture of disappointment and a strange, stubborn sense of pride. My eyes feel heavy and sting with fatigue, and an ache spreads painfully through my chest, yet an unwavering determination and stubborn willpower urge me to keep going despite the overwhelming exhaustion.



**A Thanksgiving of Small Miracles**



Thanksgiving Day 2024. I opened my Amazon dashboard expecting nothing, bracing for silence. Instead, I saw a number so small it felt like a prank: $2.50. That was my royalty payment for *The Headache*, a short story I’d tossed into the void. $2.50, not even enough for a cup of coffee. I stared at that figure and something in me cracked open. I laughed, then wiped my eyes. Because in that measly $2.50, I saw proof that someone out there actually read my [work](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Gabriel-Lucatero/author/B00DCFTZ0Q?ref=ap_rdr&isDramIntegrated=true&shoppingPortalEnabled=true&ccs_id=b44ce984-38c2-4689-8719-cce06218471f). They didn’t just scroll past the cover; they paid for it, opened it, and lived in a world I created. For a writer running on fumes, it was a quiet miracle, a moment of validation that felt larger than all the zeros I’d hoped for.



That afternoon, I poured myself a cup of instant coffee and sipped it like champagne, feeling rich in conviction if not dollars. That tiny royalty told me my stories mattered. It was a bridge between my solitary struggle and a reader’s imagination, whispering, ""Keep going."" In a year of things falling apart, that $2.50 became the seed of something new; my own scrappy, survival-driven consistency. I was writing to feel alive, to remind myself I wasn’t invisible. That little payment became a promise: if I showed up day after day, maybe I could claw my way out of the dark. In fact, I wrote a whole blog post called [A Writer’s Thanksgiving](https://gabriellucatero.com/a-writers-thanksgiving/) to celebrate that humble victory.



**When Heartbreak Became Routine**



Consistency didn’t storm in like a drill sergeant, though. It quietly crept in after my heart was shattered. In August 2024, I found out the woman I loved had been cheating on me for most of our [relationship](https://medium.com/@gabriellucaterowriter/the-day-i-stopped-swallowing-shit-e708fc3c31ad#:~:text=I%20found%20out%20she%20had,She). When I confronted her, she refused to let go, dangling talk of “our future” while using our shared finances to keep me tethered. She even threatened to cut off my phone line (my business number) if I left. It was a desperate grab for control.



That day, I stopped swallowing shit. I told her to go ahead. I was done being controlled by guilt. It took months to sever every tie, but when I finally did, I was wrecked and hollow inside. In that emptiness, consistency slipped in to fill the void. I poured every drop of hurt onto the page. I even published raw essays about reclaiming my voice. I wasn’t seeking revenge; I was trying to survive. Turning heartbreak into prose was the only way I could make sense of what happened. Each morning, I woke up to an empty bed and an urge to reach for someone who wasn’t there, and instead, I wrote. A rant, a rough paragraph, whatever kept the ghosts at bay.



I couldn’t trust love or my own judgment anymore, but I found I could trust the act of writing. The page became the one place I didn’t have to apologize for feeling broken. Consistency was never the plan; it was a lifeline. A routine born from ruin. I wrote each day because if I stopped, the grief would swallow me. Day by day, writing became as automatic as breathing, my proof that I was still here, still *me*, despite everything.



**Work, Words, and Community**



Life goes on. I keep working in insurance by day and write by night, posting on Medium, my website, and even on Substack. I also joined a book club and went back to the Rotary Club to stay connected beyond my desk. Often, I’d come home drained from a volunteer project and still crack my laptop at midnight to write. My friends are getting married and having kids, while I am celebrating a $2.50 royalty. On bad nights, a voice in my head sneers, *“No one’s reading this, cabrón. What’s the point?”* But I hold onto that one reader, and it keeps me going. I write in the shadows, earning trust one post at a time. I’m even experimenting with AI, turning some of my prose into eerie short videos.



**The Choice and the Proof of Life**



By autumn 2025, I reached a creative milestone: I published a short story titled [The Choice](https://www.amazon.com/Choice-Novelette-Gabriel-Lucatero-ebook/dp/B00XZA58C2?ref_=ast_author_dp_rw&th=1&psc=1&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.TxPzOANnhJEgE2asBvJY60yO1igR3_ioePSHpUstWmYkJu_3rymgTH60AwAfSggV7OF3MuBkz0NJrpLrIJVKpTNQMr3igsCubZjX1hmVbxU.MKrkGMsnKvaQk5Bjw5Hxy2GNeBbAiALokdZUfumGJyc&dib_tag=AUTHOR)*,* which I had written ten years earlier*.* It’s about a man stuck between a dead-end job and his dream of being a writer, until a woman named Ana appears one night with an ultimatum: **“You can’t live halfway forever.”**Writing that story was like holding up a mirror to my own life. Through Ana’s words, I was really talking to myself: **you can’t have comfort and greatness at the same time.**



When I typed the last line of *The Choice*, I felt empty and exposed. It was more confession than fiction. Writing it didn’t give me a rush; it gave me clarity, reminding me of a lesson I keep forgetting: **you don’t need to know how the story ends; you just need the courage to keep writing it**. I’d been so fixated on whether all my effort would ever “pay off,” whether I’d find success or love, that I lost sight of why I write at all. I didn’t start writing to win or get rich; I did it to say something true before I go, to leave even a small mark on the world.



And maybe, deep down, I write to prove to myself that I *exist*. Every story, every late-night post, every video, they’re proof of life, each quietly saying I was here and made something out of pain. I didn’t stick with daily writing because it was trendy. I held on because after everything, writing was the one thing that never left me. It’s the place I can lay down my truth and not have it ignored. Now, at the end of 2025, I’m still broke and still single, still waking up before dawn to write and staying up late to do it again. Consistency is no magic cure. But it gave me a rope to hold onto when everything else was falling apart. It’s proof that after everything, I refuse to disappear.



Tonight, the house is quiet. No one’s here but me and this blinking cursor. I realize I’ve built a mess, a beautiful, honest mess. I stayed consistent because I had no other choice. I whisper a *gracias* to whoever’s reading (and to that stranger who paid $2.50 for my book). There’s no grand epiphany, just a quiet understanding: *This is enough*—the writing, the struggle, the hope that refuses to die. Tomorrow I’ll get up and do it all again. I’ll write my way through the dark, prove I’m still here.

I have always disliked NuLu for a multitude of reasons (mainly the parking) but I had to go to revelry for something in august and happened to park in front of this place, so I went in. It opened in September 2024 but I had never heard of it! The atmosphere is gorgeous and quiet (perfect for working/school), the employees are so kind, and they carry lots of locally owned items (food,gifting,alcohol,etc.). The pricing is about the same as every other coffee shop (about 5.50 for a large specialty iced latte is as expensive as it gets there) and they have punch cards (every 10th drink is free!). It’s a bodega/coffee/gift shop concept but it doesn’t feel overcrowded with things at all. The teddy graham latte is so unbelievably good.

We don't give birthday and Christmas presents to one another anymore because we need to start eliminating things rather than collecting more.  So we give gifts to the kids and grandkids, of course.  And to the teachers, mail carriers, nail techs, etc.  

But I'll tell you what's even more fun.  When I go shopping at the Christmas season I buy whatever giftcards the stores offer and give them to the clerk who's checking me out.  I do it the last week before Christmas when it's really hectic and they're really frazzled.  'Cause who of us could even *have* holiday without the folks who sell us groceries and last minute gifts and wrapping, etc.?  All our loved ones are happy to get our gifts but these folks aren't *expecting* to get a gift.  It blows their minds and picks up their spirits and is an entirely different kind of giving.   It even excites the other clerks nearby who see it happening.  You won't believe how much they'll enjoy it and how much you'll enjoy seeing -- very immediately -- how much pleasure you're providing

One year a clerk followed me out of the store with a bouquet of flowers.  Another year I was waiting in a long s-l-o-w line at Starbucks and getting agitated when the woman ahead of me paid for my coffee too.  So I can attest as both a giver and receiver how special the unexpected is.

Things are tight this year.  if you can't afford a $25 gift certificate how about one of your handmade cards and perhaps a $5 Starbucks card or even a piece of chocolate Ghirardelli makes those nice flat ones you and slide in an envelope?  I promise you if you try it, these will be the presents you will most look forward to giving every year.  And if you can't, I hope someone pays for your coffee.  I wish I could!

My recent tightening was this past Monday the 17th. 

Yesterday I was having breakfast (my teeth have been feeling not bad since the past tightening, nothing major) I felt a tinge when I bit into something, but nothing out of the ordinary, it happens. Well I go to drink water and swish it around my teeth as I always do to help remove coffee and food residue, when I feel the most insane surge of pain in that one tooth. It moved from the top down to the root and I could feel the pain vibrate in my jaw. I’ve noticed it’s really only one tooth, one of the front bottom ones. At first I thought it was a canine and thought that makes sense as they’re moving those to close my premolar gaps right now. 

But the pain persists. Every time I swish water over that tooth or inhale sharp air, it vibrates down into the root. It’s so painful. Yet when food touches it, nothing. 

I’ve sort of found some similar experiences on the internet but not a lot on it. It seems that the conclusion is that it’s moving a lot and part of the root might be exposed from the moving? 

Just wondering if anyone else has had this happen. It’s making me nauseous and hoping it’s completely normal. I want to call my ortho but they’re closed for the weekend.

1p44mk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/asexualdating/comments/1p44mk6/24_f4m_europeaustriaitaly_looking_for_a_romantic/,24 F4M Europe/Austria/Italy looking for a romantic partner,"Hey! I am a 24 year old woman, I am still questioning whether I am ""actually"" asexual (perhaps rather grey or demi?) I do feel sexual attraction occasionally, and I enjoy intercourse once in a while if there is a strong romantic and intellectual bond, but overall my libido is very, very low. I love to cuddle up and to sleep with a partner, though. I am looking for a (potentially lifelong) monogamous romantic partner (aged 24-30), with whom I can build a common future, including marriage and kids down the line (no rush). I currently live in Austria, but am not Austrian :) I am open to long distance as long as you live in Europe and close to an airport.

I prefer to not share my picture on here, but I am 175 cm (I would like to have a partner who is at least as tall as me, if not taller), conventionally attractive, dark blonde, blue eyes, normal weight, no tattoos or piercings. I got my MA degree in the social sciences field in June, and would love to connect with someone who is also interested in social sciences and humanities. I currently have a flexible, remote, freelance job, but it is not my dream career at all - I am still thinking about what I would like for my future career to look like. It is important for me that my partner is ambitious - to have a desire to improve himself from a mental health pov, but also career-wise. It is not important that you already have a clear vision, but rather that you are willing to put in the work and put yourself ""out there"".

In the past months, after graduation, I went through some changes. I quit drinking and consuming drugs, and would like to have a partner who either is sober too, or has a rare and unproblematic relationship with alcohol or weed (hard drugs are a no-go). I try to have a regular sleeping schedule, and cannot imagine to be together with someone who has an irregular sleeping rhythm. I suffer occasionally of more or less bad depressive episodes, and generally am prone to anxiety, so it is important for me to be with a partner who doesn't have problematic anxiety, or is able to handle it very well, to offer me stability and tranquillity from this point of view. I am against pornography, so if you actively support or watch explicit content, it is a deal breaker for me. It is important for me to be with a partner who will someday enthusiastically (want to) be a husband and a dad, so that contributes to the household.

I am in the process of adopting two lovely small dogs, who will soon be living with me. This means that I am less flexible with travelling. In my free time, I enjoy reading (I mostly read non-fic, although I like all types of fictional novels too, except fantasy), spending time with friends (either playing billiard, going for a walk, or just having a coffee and good talks), napping, knitting (in the colder months), playing Sims occasionally (I play no other games, oops), watching movies (usually the same cult-movies I really like haha), and learning languages. I really like to keep my living space clean and tidy, but I wouldn't call that a hobby haha Overall, I would describe myself as an openminded, assertive, optimistic and positive person, and it is important for me, that overall my partner matches these qualities. I have a great relationship with my parents, so it is also important that my partner will respect and encourages me frequently visiting my parents who live abroad. Politically speaking, I am left-leaning and overall have a feminist and anti-colonial worldview. In a relationship, I am loving, loyal, supportive, and affectionate. My love languages are quality time and cooking :) I am still working on communicating about my needs, doubts and feelings in an open way, especially when conflict is involved. Unfortunately, especially when stress is involved, I tend to close down. I think I am a good listener, too, and am generally very curious about other people, especially about learning what they are passionate about, about their culture etc.

I hope I was able to describe myself well, if you have any other questions, please let me know :) And most importantly: I am very looking forward to meeting you!",2,1763846624.0,asexualdating,0,0.75,False

1p44lrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1p44lrw/my_family_is_falling_apart/,My family is falling apart,"Hi yall. I don’t even really know where to begin. My (22F) parents (60) are heading toward divorce and I don’t know what to do.

I still live at home while finishing college. My mother and I have always struggled to get along. She can be a very cruel, hateful, violent person. She can also be one of the most empathetic and kind people you’ll ever meet. She gets angry very quickly, and when she does she says the most horrible things and can get violent. There is too much to tell to give you a full picture of what living with her is like. I can put some screenshots of text exchanges to give an idea if anyone wants, but I doubt this post will gain much traction. Around 2021/2022 things started getting better. We didn’t argue much anymore, we were working through our issues. But then, earlier this year my grammie (her mom) was diagnosed with dementia and everything started going downhill.

She and I started fighting constantly again, and this began to take a toll on my dad. She viewed me as disrespectful (which I admit, I can be on occasion. But she also viewed things like me saying “you shouldn’t buy that for Sister, she won’t like it” as disrespectful). She would start getting angry at him for not defending her, saying I was manipulating him and he was worthless. I will say, my dad is a very quiet, sometimes passive person. He wouldn’t stand up to his mother when she would say mean things about my mom. I understand where she’s coming from, but she takes it so far to the point where it’s hard to feel empathy.

Things boiled over last Friday. There’s too much context to really explain everything, but I was leaving Saturday morning to go do homework at a coffee shop. I was supposed to meet my friend, but my mom stopped me and said I wasn’t leaving until we had a talk. She began complaining about how I don’t help out around the house (I do, but she only notices the things I forget and never what I do). I understand where she was coming from though, and she had been talking so long that my friend had been waiting for a half hour already. I pulled my phone out to text my friend that I wasn’t going to make it, and she flipped out.

She told me not to text her, and to put my phone away. I said no, I’m not going to have her continue waiting for me for who knows how long. She grabbed my phone from me and wouldn’t listen when I asked her to give it back. I bought that phone, and I pay the bill for it. She told me to go talk to my dad, but I didn’t listen. I grabbed my phone from her pocket and she grabbed onto my hair. She was holding my face to the couch by my hair, screaming at me to give it back. My dad came out to see what was going on, so she told him to take my phone. He refused, and told her to let go of me, and she lost it even more. She stormed downstairs and grabbed a suitcase and began to pack, saying how she was leaving. For context, my mom is a stay at home wife, and hasn’t held a long term job in like 25 years. She has no savings, and is already 60.

I brushed and de-matted her cat, bathed her dog, and did some dishes, and then I went to my boyfriend’s place. I didn’t want to go back home while she was there, so I waited until my dad told me to come home. It took her 13 hours to leave. The next five days were honestly really peaceful! There was no screaming, no drama, no anger.  My dad went to visit her Monday night, but had to leave for work Tuesday morning. Apparently, she looked at his phone “to make sure he had an alarm set” and coincidentally saw texts between my dad and her brother (who she is currently also fighting with) about what to do to get my mother help. She flipped out on him. She didn’t come home until Wednesday night.

Things were ok, but then I said something dumb about her trying to make her dog a service animal. Her dog is horribly behaved, and not trained to do anything. She thinks she can train her, I really don’t 😭 but that put us back into a cycle of arguing again. I’m attaching a screenshot of texts I sent my boyfriend after the incident, I was really upset so sorry for the grammar and stuff. But now she’s leaving again, and I think my dad is just. Done.

I love my mom, but I don’t think she really understands the people around her. She has pushed everyone away from her, and I’m really worried about what is going to happen to her if they divorce. She has no job, she never finished high school, and she’s burned a lot of her bridges. I’m worried about my dad too, he has lost almost 30 lbs in 4 months due to stress. I just.

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",0,1763846520.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,0.5,False

It triggered a cold sore. But then a week later, I had a curry and got another cold sore. It was huge!!  Woke up this morning, about a week later again and another cold sore! Is this common with histamine issues? A few months ago, I had zero symptoms. I only noticed I’d get some redness after dinner because I saw it in the bathroom mirror. But it would disappear quickly. The recent flare is by far the worst I’ve ever got. I was really taken aback that it could get so bad. 

For background, I’ve been dealing with gut issues for a little while and just saw a new batrioath who’s meant to be a guru for SIBO. I was so relieved to finally be in good hands after really upsetting experiences with mishandling with naturopaths in the past. Though he told me something that I didn’t see coming and potentially could have a lifelong condition, so I had a fuck everything moment and had decaf coffee, siete tortilla chips, coconut logs and Thai food. On a normal day for me that would be completely normal. Even a couple of months ago I might have had mild itching but not sure why. So the fact that this threw me off so bad has been stressing me out. Does histamine trigger cold sores in others here or wonder if it’s something else. I rarely get them otherwise.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Minnesota Wild vs. Winnipeg Jets: A Central Division Showdown Where the Puck *****Might***** Drop the Mic**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a hockey clash that’s tighter than a goalie’s grip on a playoff paycheck. The Minnesota Wild (11-7-4) and Winnipeg Jets (12-8) collide on Sunday, November 24, 2025, in a rematch of their first meeting—a Jets overtime victory that probably left Wild fans muttering, “We were *this* close to a comeback!” Let’s break this down with the statistical precision of a Zamboni and the humor of a penguin in a hockey mask.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The betting markets are as split as a chicken’s dinner. The Jets are slight favorites at **-200** (implied probability: **66.67%**) on DraftKings, while the Wild hover at **+212** (35.71%). Decimal odds for the Jets sit at **1.8**, translating to a 55.5% implied chance to win, versus the Wild’s 48.8% at **2.05**. But here’s the twist: the Wild have allowed just **1.7 goals per game over their last 10**—a defense so sturdy, they’d make a vault blush. Meanwhile, the Jets have given up **2.9 goals per game** in the same span, which is about the same as your average coffee table’s ability to hold mugs without toppling.

The spread? Jets are favored by **1.5 goals**. If you’re betting on the Jets, you’re banking on their offense (66 goals scored) outmuscling the Wild’s porous one. But if you’re backing the Wild, you’re probably high-fiving their **3.2 goals per game** and the fact that they’ve won **8 of their last 10**—including a 5-0 shutout that had the Pittsburgh Penguins questioning their life choices.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Momentum, and Dad Jokes

Let’s start with the bad news for the Jets: **No major injuries**. That’s right, Winnipeg’s roster is as healthy as a vegan at a salad bar. Their top line of Mark Scheifele (11 goals, 17 assists) and Kyle Connor (6 goals, 7 assists in 10 games) is firing on all cylinders, and their +10 goal differential smells like a bakery’s fresh bread—warm, reliable, and slightly yeasty.

The Wild? They’re playing without **reigning MVP Connor Hellebuyck**, who’s sidelined for 4-6 weeks after knee surgery. Ouch. But here’s the silver lining: They’ve got **Filip Gustavsson**, who’s been so good, he’s made a shutout look easier than explaining blockchain to your grandma. Plus, their recent 5-0 drubbing of Pittsburgh had the flair of a fireworks show—spectacular, cathartic, and leaving the opposition wondering if they forgot to bri

1p44hig,https://www.reddit.com/r/ICARUS/comments/1p44hig/biofuel_stove_efficiency/,"Biofuel Stove ""Efficiency""","The biofuel stove says it is efficient. 

I disagree. 

Brewing coffee takes 100 seconds at the campfire. This uses 1.67 wood as 1 wood burns for exactly 60 seconds.

The biofuel stove operates 1.5x as fast, so it only takes about 66.7 seconds. Sounds decent at face value, but then you see that a full can of 10,000 biofuel lasts a mere 1000 seconds, just 16 min 40 seconds. 

That's 10 biofuel per second!

This means a single brew of coffee uses 667 biofuel.

Now realize that 100 biofuel comes from 1 wood and 1 sap. This means for 667 biofuel you're using 9.34 wood per coffee brew. That's 6.7 wood, plus 2.64 wood converted to sticks converted to sap. 

Biofuel Stove uses over 5.5x as much wood per brew of coffee as a basic campfire.

Oh, and you don't get any charcoal for your efforts this way.

It's not even more efficient if you only use rotted meat or plants, because you're still using the 2.64 wood to get sap, plus you're going to be extremely limited on how much fuel you get if you stick with spoiled foods. This is still 1.58x as much wood.

Its only redeeming qualities are that it takes less space and is faster, so it's more ""efficient"" in that aspect, but consumes more resources. My takeaway is that if you can use the campfire for a recipe, you should, and only use the biofuel stove if you need its recipes.

I’m 31. I have a 6 year old from my first marriage, and a 1 year old now with my husband now. We are coming up on our second year wedding anniversary. We got married very quick after meeting and dating, within about 8-9 months. Typical for most Christians of course. We didn’t live together before we got married, again typical for Christians. I had rose colored glasses on the whole time. Ignored a few flags. He did too. Of course, like lots of marriages, his life immediately improved and he’s been on an exponential curve upwards in HIS life since we met/married, and mine has gone the complete opposite. I had a lot of freedom, a high paying job, hobbies, friends, etc. all before him. And now I have literally nothing except for working a low paying menial office job 2 days a week, and home with the kids for the rest of the time. My mom helps, and that’s the only time I feel some semblance of “happy” when I can finally be alone for a few hours. My husband is textbook “weaponized incompetence” kind of guy. He’s also ex-military, and just kind of an asshole sometimes for lack of a better phrase. He went to school for psychology, so he’s like a narcissist that went to therapy and now uses “therapy speak” or thinks everyone else is the problem, you know?? The only one out of the four of us that he really (genuinely) seems to like is our son. He’s cold towards me and my daughter, his step-daughter. I am mostly depressed and angry and resentful 24/7, with brief moments of hope or “joy”. I feel alone all the time. My husband almost always seems aggravated by me because of whatever I didn’t do or because I’m not all chipper and some “sweet, submissive” sort of housewife to come home to. Every time I spend money or want to spend money it’s frowned upon, but he bought himself hundreds of dollars of camping supplies, a new MacBook laptop, he gets himself tons of olipop sodas, etc. But he’ll whip out the excel budget spreadsheet where he tracks everything and he’ll make me feel bad for going out to get coffees or getting my hair cut or whatever else. I’m just super sad. I could’ve given myself a really great and beautiful and special life. I wish I never had children. I feel like a prisoner every day. The only reason I’m still here is because my broken hearted inner child still wants all of this to work so badly I guess, and I don’t want my kids to grow up in an even more broken home than they are now. He’s very belittling in arguments. He exacerbates everybody’s anxiety in the household but blames me for basically not being tough enough, I’m too emotional, irrational, etc. We pretty much don’t agree about anything. If I was independently wealthy I would have left a long time ago. But I’ve allow myself to become totally dependent on him and I’m just so heart broken for myself, you know? And the kids who didn’t choose this. I look at old pictures of myself and I sob over how happy and free and funny and interesting I was. And now I’m absolutely nobody. I’m just a shitty maid, a good cook, and I do the grocery shopping and other things that my husband doesn’t like to do. I’m so tired. Getting married twice and having two children has absolutely ruined my life. These are supposed to be my best years, making happy memories with my kids. Feeling loved and special from my husband. And instead every day I scream in my car and cry. I’ve become a horribly emotionally neglectful mother. My daughter loves my mom more than me, and I don’t blame her. I’m always so miserable because of my husband and my overall exhaustion from all this BS and the mental load of all of this that I’m not available for any sort of nurturing, play, etc. that kids need. I hate my life every single day. I guess I just needed to say all that. Thanks to anyone who read all of this. I already have a therapist by the way. Not much therapy can do to change shitty life choices though. Anyway…thanks. ",12,1763846061.0,confessions,16,0.7,False

But nowadays I suddenly realized that there was a spotlight in my background. For me, that light is Axxx.  Now that he's about to leave me, I regret that this thought only occurred to me recently.



<The Anchor in the Storm>

I remember a specific project a few months back. The deadline was looming, a critical bug had emerged, and the pressure was mounting. It was one of those moments where frustration starts to cloud judgment. In the midst of that chaos, Axxx was a steady anchor. While others (understandably) panicked, they calmly brewed a fresh pot of coffee, pulled up a chair, and said, ""Okay, let's walk through it together.""

That simple act—the calm in my storm—changed everything. We didn’t just fix the bug; we fortified a trust that I now know is priceless. A great colleague doesn’t just share your workload; they share the weight of the challenge. They are the calm voice that reminds you that no problem is insurmountable as a team.

And to everyone reading this, I encourage you to look around. Acknowledge that colleague who makes your work life better. Tell them what they mean to you. Because in the grand narrative of our careers, these relationships aren't just a subplot—they are the foundation upon which we build our greatest work.

If I want chocolate? I have chocolate. Heck, I’ll have a small-ish Dubai-style pistachio kunafa chocolate bar. I’ve even been known to have the Biscoff kunafa chocolate bar. 

If I want a Chinese takeaway? I’ll eat a quarter of it, but half of a Chinese takeaway is probably more reasonable than a quarter. I just physically can’t eat more than a quarter because of Mounjaro. 

If I’m hungry, I eat. I DO NOT IGNORE hunger signals. The more you ignore hunger, the higher the likelihood that you’ll end up binging later (not a problem when you’re on Mounjaro but it can be for people not on the jabs). 

Alcohol? I drink it. Going on a night out? A couple of cocktails (always the Bramble cocktails for me). Wanting something more? I drink vodka with sugar-free pineappleade

I go to college. Know what I get when I’m on a break? Either a lovely butter croissant or a cinnamon swirl pastry. 

Someone’s birthday? A slice of cake? Absolutely, but never more than 1 slice

A cup of coffee, a couple of sugars in it? Absolutely. Sugar is not the enemy- not in controlled amounts anyway 

The real truth? I had NO IDEA how much I was eating before Mounjaro. Seriously. I didn’t think I was eating that much. 

I gave my nephew a portion of chips and chicken curry from the local Chinese. The portion was HUGE! Filled a whole large plate. I would’ve eaten it beforehand and still say, “I haven’t eaten that much today.”

Want to know something more? IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT. It is not your fault that you are overweight. You could say, “Yeah I should eat less and exercise more.” Typical weight loss advice. But truly, Mounjaro and Wegovy (and similar GLP-1 receptor agonists) fix a problem within the brain and body. 

You have no idea how distorted your relationship with food is until you’re on a medication to correct it.

I liken it to a person who is depressed going on antidepressants. Of course, lifestyle changes are warranted, but you don’t know how distorted your thinking is until you get a medication which works for your depression. 

If you can eat massive portions (like I did because of medication) and still not feel satiated, still not thinking that you’re eating too much- it’s a physiological problem. Not a moral failing. 

I see all these fad diets- eliminate this food, only eat these foods. Seems miserable. And I can see why these diets have high “drop out” rates

My reality is that the “moderation” everyone was preaching about couldn’t be conceptualised by my mind until Mounjaro. Now I know what moderation looks like. Now I know how normal people feel when they eat. It’s a privilege for me to be able to afford Mounjaro- but I really hope to see more people getting access to it via the NHS. It has the ability to change lives and reduce the burden associated with obesity-related diseases

Side note: Now that I’ve lost all the weight, I’m freezing cold this season. Any tips?

I was surprised at the amount of current fall and winter candles they had on the tables. The collaboration tables were ransacked of course, so I only ended up finding the one wizard of oz candle.

They had so many of the world traveler collection and aromatherapy. Honestly, they had a lot of everything! Oh and they even had the brand new Harry potter wax melts, and I saw one of the candles.

I’m coming from Melitta, having had a Melitta caffeo passione, and more recently a Caffeo CI Touch (RIP @ 7000 coffees)

Looking through this sub I see a lot of mentions of Philips/Saeco/Gaggia, Jura and Delonghi, but not much in terms of Melitta.

Main reason for me coming here was to get a feel of the Philips machine issues and longevity. I replaced many parts on my Melittas to keep them going for several years and they coffee from them was fantastic. Making 2 foamed milk drinks at the same time ‘hands off’ was just elite imo!

Are the Philips machines as easy to fix with parts readily available? I’m still in my return window so I’m summing it all up. The coffee is nowhere near as good in the Philips yet, but I’m told it should “run in” after 30-40 cups.

The 36” round table tops are large and heavy, 40”x40”x4” box, 45-pounds.

The lowest cost shipping I have found, for approximately 200-miles away is an E-commerce offer from UPS for $65,I don’t need any kind of quick shipping option.

I am sure that I am not finding the best rates, even just based on my experience buying large items for my family.  I have signed up for business accounts for USPS, FedEx and UPS, but still am missing something because the shipping rates are so high as to be unsustainable. 

On Shopify, the platform said the FedEx rate would be $45, (based on the entered package size and weight) which is ok (I would hide 20$ of it in the product costs just for optics) but then the rate I find via my FedEx account is well over $120 at least… 

This seems to be the one hurdle that has me the most concerned re the viability of my business even getting off the ground successfully.

I do enjoy hanging out with them and we seem to have a lot of fun, but I often find myself being left out of stuff. It doesn't bother me completely, it only bothers me when I'm right there listening.

For example, the other day K asked G if she would want to go for lunch that day somewhere. G mentioned me at some point and K told her ""no she wouldn't want to go"" or something like that. I was sitting right there and I would've went with them if they asked. Only then K invited me when she noticed I was listening. I didn't end up going because I didn't know if they actually wanted me there. 

Another example is when I asked K if she wanted to go to the gym with me before we meet up with G to study. I also offered if G wanted to go but she had some work to do and said no. K agreed, we picked a time (and I even negotiated and told K to pick a good enough time but she agreed to the one I offered) and when the time came to do the plan, she texted me right at the time we were going to meet up and said she isn't coming. However, she was just in time for the study session we had planned with G. Ashen we all met up, K whispered to G saying ""I thought she said x time but she didn't"". That is a lie because she agreed to the time and texted me at that time. I brushed this situation off but whenever something new happens I think about how it's repeating. K is always late to everything I plan.

K does tell me to meet up with her to get coffee sometimes though, and she also asks me for help when studying so maybe it's not all that bad.

I always help them when they ask and I'm always on time for everyone's plans so I don't know why it happens.

I might just be sensitive (though I doubt it because I am pretty tough) but I always seem to be the one left out of stuff or not knowing something funny that they know, etc. It's always me when it's groups like this. 

I am quiet and I mind my own business. I also don't enjoy parties or gossiping but I will admit it's fun if  person I'm talking about is truly bad (which in that case I guess isn't gossip? I don't know). I'm also not that pretty; like I'm not awfully ugly either but I am uglier than my two best friends and I don't do much makeup because I'd rather sleep in an extra while than wake up earlier to put on a mask (also makeup is kind of expensive). I used to do makeup to hide so that's why I stopped, I only do mascara now cause I like t but my friends like to do full faces of makeup and they're really good at it! it's just not my thing. Does this make me boring? I've been told I also live under a rock so maybe that's why. I don't know.

If anyone has any tips so I can be interesting or better as a friend please let me know :)

Maybe it will explain how I feel at times. 

I've been carnivore for about a year and mostly I feel good but I still notice a lot of dips in energy and holding on to weight. I am fit and workout 3 times a week hard and have a bit of stubborn fat. I do feel strongest I've ever felt, can't lie.

The energy is the real issue for me. I always feel like my mind is catching up with reality if that makes sense. I have good energy but the weird dips/days are noticeable.

I eat about 150-250 grams of fat first and follow it up with mostly beef, twice a day. 

I supplement magnesium, vitamin D, cod liver oil and iodine. 

I have milk once a day in my coffee but very little, no other dairy. Dairy causes easy weight gain for me, because of this I only eat organic beef tallow for fat and before every meal. I know coffee isn't the strictest on this woe.

Before carnivore I ate all the normal shit that wants to kill you and lots of it: spinach, almonds, cashews etc.. after researching, my diet was FULL of oxalates.

Is it possible the energy dips and stubborn bit of fat is due to metabolic healing? What's your knowledge and experience with this?

Sometimes big things grow from small and inauspicious beginnings, and that’s the story of the 2025 Nobel prize in Chemistry. In 1974, University of Melbourne chemist [Richard Robson ](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/university-of-melbourne-professor-richard-robson-wins-nobel-prize/news-story/aa63a2b06161ec4c29e8e95fa5110a0e)had an idea. He toyed with it for 10 years before trying it out in his lab. Then in the mid-1980s, working alone and without fanfare, he took the first steps in creating a new class of manufactured material – today known as metal-organic frameworks (or MOFs) – which have extraordinary properties.

They are crystals, but they are not solid. They are built like scaffolding, from a network of molecular rods, and they are mainly empty space. This means they are extremely porous but their cavities are nano-sized: so small they can be “tuned” to admit some types of molecules and refuse entry to others.

[](https://research.curtin.edu.au/research-areas/sustainability-and-energy-transition/)

To build the first MOF, Robson decided to try to emulate a diamond crystal, which is structured as a series of tetrahedrons stacked together. Except that unlike diamond – made of solid tetrahedrons with strong bonds between carbon atoms – he would build it from molecular rods. The end result was a liquid that didn’t look spectacular. But when Robson’s colleague Bernard Hoskins X-rayed it, the diffraction image proved that floating in the liquid was the tetrahedral lattice that Robson was seeking.

He understood the significance of what he had achieved. Hoskins and he published a paper in 1989 describing their result and hence proposed “a new and potentially extensive class of solid polymeric materials with unprecedented and possibly useful properties”. They said, prophetically, that the materials “may show some interesting molecular sieve and ion exchange properties”. Their structure “would generate a regular array of cavities, interconnected by windows”. Even rods of “modest length” would produce cavities and windows of “relatively large size”, the paper said.

Although Robson correctly foresaw the potential of this new class of materials, the early examples he and others produced [did not have practical applications](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/what-universities-could-learn-from-richard-robson-our-88yearold-nobel-prize-winner/news-story/e2cdfcb398162169d5f0075dfb53ba96). One problem was that they were not strong. If the solvent bath they were created in evaporated away, they were prone to disintegrate. But despite this, Robson was able to show in these early experiments that molecules could flow in and out of the lattices and they could be optimised to attract different chemicals to their interior “cavities”. He also suggested that the lattices could be designed to catalyse chemical reactions.

He was proved to be correct. Today, more than 10,000 different types of MOFs have been built by chemists. They look commonplace. Some are powders and others are grains the size of rice. But what they have in common is immensely small, molecular-sized “cavities and windows” that do amazing things.

There are MOFs that are designed to admit only one type of molecule and to store them in their interior space. There are others that will remove carbon dioxide from the air. And some that will capture water vapour from the air, allowing it to be liquefied and provided as drinking water in arid areas. There are also MOFs that will store hydrogen gas, a fuel that is expensive to store or transport at the moment because of the need to keep it under high pressure at very low temperatures.

MOFs can also be designed to filter specific pollutants from both air and water, including the dangerous PFAS “forever chemicals”. Related to this, a MOF can be used as a sensor. If “tuned” to admit only one particular substance into its lattice, it can trigger an alert when this occurs.

The possible uses for MOFs are countless and often not obvious. For example, MOFs that absorb ethylene – a gas released by fruit that hastens ripening – are being used to extend shelf life of perishable foods. And studies are under way to see if MOFs are an economic way to filter lithium – a key component of batteries – from briny underground water.

University of Sydney chemistry professor Deanna D’Alessandro, who has worked with Robson on MOFs and is the [field leader in inorganic chemistry ](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/special-reports/research-magazine/deanna-dalessandro-is-our-leading-researcher-in-inorganic-chemistry/news-story/0c0ba2687b7fd72929651a27dd3999aa)in this year’s Research magazine, explains their ubiquity by noting that MOF designers have all the elements of the periodic table to work with. “You’ve got whatever your imagination can come up with,” she says.

D’Alessandro says real advances were made by Robson’s fellow Nobel prize winners, Susumu Kitagawa of Kyoto University in Japan, and Omar Yaghi of the University of California, Berkeley in the US. “They showed how to make these materials stable when you evacuated all the molecules out of the pores”.

In the 1990s, Kitagawa made a famous breakthrough when he built a MOF which was flexible. It expands when it absorbs a gas or liquid and contracts when it is released. One of Yaghi’s achievements was an immensely strong MOF called MOF-5. It has a huge interior storage capacity and is so stable it can be heated to 300 degrees C and remain intact.

What comes next? Will there be enormously successful commercial applications for MOFs in carbon reduction, pollution control, hydrogen storage or water harvesting. “We have to be careful not to say that MOFs will solve all the world’s problems,” says D’Alessandro. “If only they could.” She says there is a leap to be made from a MOF that works in the lab to one that works, and is economic, when integrated into a large engineered system.

“But there’s certainly many of us working hard because we recognise that there are going to be needs for this technology,” she says.

Robson, although he still goes into the University of Melbourne most days, said in an interview just after his Nobel win that he’s not in close touch with the latest developments. But the 88-year-old said he was still excited by one possibility, that a MOF could be designed to have high electrical conductivity. “including, very optimistically, super conductivity.”

His University of Melbourne colleague Brendan Abrahams, who has worked closely with Robson in the lab for 35 years, says the path-breaking MOF research was enjoyable just for the sake of it. “It was fun, it really was. We’d often have an early morning coffee and he’d bring in this thick wad of paper. He’d written down all of these ideas that he’d come up with overnight.”

Abrahams says Robson was never one to look for publicity or reward. “He’s a very quiet person, a very humble and modest person.” So quiet that for a long time he had a very low profile in the chemistry department, Abrahams says.

But in December, Robson will be in the spotlight when he goes to Stockholm to be presented with his Nobel prize by the Swedish king and be feted at a magnificent banquet. And he’s invited his long-time colleague Abrahams to go with him.",15,1763845131.0,aussie,2,0.94,False

From obsessive optimizers to zen monks, crypto scammers to accidental heirs: We've mapped the ecosystem. Find yourself in the typology, laugh at the accuracy or lack of it, then tell us which weird hybrid you actually are. Or which obvious personas we overlooked.

# Who Are You, Really?

Your morning starts with a spreadsheet ritual: coffee in hand, 20 tabs open, meticulous check of last night's market moves. When dinner guests cancel, it's not a social loss, oh no, it's an extra hour to tweak your retirement date by 0.01%.  
Are we allowed to call you a **Spreadsheet Samurai**?

Or is your FIRE journey less about numbers and more about peace of mind? Did you pause index fund contributions for a full month to focus on wellness retreats because FIRE isn't about retiring early as much as retiring *stress*?  
Admit it: Your close friend has been calling you a **Wealth Monk** for years, right?

And you over there: Didn't you get lucky when your central heating broke down during the coldest week of the year, perfectly timed with the death of your 25-year-old fridge? So you put on your warmest jumper, saved a substantial amount, and learned to live without refrigeration anyway. Not bad, on the contrary! This will save you an estimated €1,000 over the next decade, at least. No, you're probably not even reading this because hanging out on social networks is such a *waste of resources*, isn't it, **Frugal Extremist**?  
But who are you then?

# Why Personas Matter (Sort Of)

When you read through the various FIRE subs, you'll inevitably encounter clusters of users with strong persona traits that combine **financial attitudes, career choices, and lifestyle quirks.**

**Why bother with typologies?** Because they help us:

* Self-identify and reflect on our own patterns
* Find relatable stories and avoid isolation
* Recognize red flags in ourselves (and others)
* Have some damn fun on a weekend (*Dsclaimer: the second part of the first, the second part of the second and the third point are here due to the wisdom of AI whereas, luckily, the fun part we managed to keep. We put this little disclaimer here for those who gain intellectual rewards just by spotting usage of AI. So here you go)*

Research on financial personalities suggests people do cluster around distinct money attitude, think of risk tolerance, optimization tendencies, and lifestyle trade-offs that can create predictable patterns. Sure, these labels are playful and semi-scientific at best, but they're grounded in the reality that *different people FIRE differently*. This is the mantra of this sub also as you may have grasped in the meantime...

What other archetypes are lurking in the FIRE ecosystem? **Bonus points for identifying personas we** ***missed***\*\*.\*\*

# Why This Matters (Beyond the Laughs)

If you have come so far then the usual little snack: These personas aren't just for fun. We think if they were only for fun that would be reason enough to list them, though. But personas can also reveal how **different psychological profiles approach the same goal**. Understanding your type helps you:

* Recognize your blind spots (Spreadsheet Samurai: when's the last time you had fun?)
* Find your people (Wealth Monks: you're not lazy, you're intentional and we like to see more of you)
* Avoid toxic patterns (Crypto Hustlers: please leave or rather stay away as you wondefully did so far)

The beauty of ""It's Complicated"" FIRE? **You don't have to fit one box.** Most of us are weird hybrids navigating messy realities.

So: **Which persona are you? And which one secretly annoys you the most?** We hope it's not just this one🦉

We wanted to be close to the airport and we were killing time before going there. So we decided to go to a bar.

We arrived and sat down at a table. We ordened coffee. A few minutes later, I felt a gust of wind on my back and heard a loud noise. I saw my boyfriend’s eyes glaze over.

Two waiters came over to apologize. A cabinet about 2 meter x 0,5 meters fell behind me, just a few centimeters away. It didn't hit my head because at that moment I was bent over looking for my cell phone in my backpack. My boyfriend started to touching me, trembling. And someone said ""I think she's in a shock"". Then I looked at the fallen cabinet and I don't know.

I am looking to expand my credit portfolio, and as the title mentions, I am having a hard time finding any cons in applying for the AMEX gold card. A little about me, I am a 23 year old female who will be graduating college in 3 weeks with my Bachelor's. I've been working full-time in my field for the past year and a half, and I have another job waiting for me when I graduate.

I have one credit card, the Discover student card, right now. The limit started at $500, but it is now $2,000. I've never made a late payment, and I keep the utilizing limit under 35%. My other loans are my car loans and my student loans, which total about $41,000, combined. I think I'm doing okay with my debt. I apologize if this is too much information; I just don't know what is relevant when posting in this subreddit.

That being said, I've been doing some research about expanding my portfolio, and I want a credit card that has some perks to it, leading me to Chase Sapphire vs Amex Gold. I like Amex because the 4x points on grocery + food is nice, as that's where I spend most of money. I won't lie, either. The metal card is pretty cool. But I know that's vain, and I can - obviously - look past it. Besides the $350 yearly payment, I can't find any downsides. I want to travel, Dunkin is my favorite coffee (though I don't buy it out), and I don't typically Uber. 

I also come from a very financial illiterate family, so I really have to work hard to understand finances. If this seems like a fake post, I promise it's not. If there are better options, too, please enlighten me. I'm pretty open minded, so I'll accept anything you have to say! Thank you guys!",2,1763844887.0,CreditCards,12,0.75,False

Alright, I’ll just be blunt. I’ve been in the DMV for a little while now (work brought me to Arlington), and making friends here feels impossible. It seems like everyone is either buried in work, already has their established crew, or is just passing through.

I’ve tried the basics—smiling at coworkers, the usual—but it never seems to turn into actual ""let's hang out on a Saturday"" friendships.

So, for those of you who have successfully built a social circle here, how did you do it?

· Did you join a specific league or club? (A pottery class?)
· Did you have luck with Bumble BFF or Meetup? Any groups in particular?
· Are there certain bars, coffee shops, or recurring events that are better for meeting people than others?
· Did you just relentlessly talk to your neighbors until one of them adopted you?
· What was the secret to turning a friendly chat into an actual friendship?

As a Black professional in my early 30s, trying new restaurants, and generally just looking for people to explore the area with. But honestly, I'm open to almost anything at this point.

Any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance for saving my social life.

You reach for your water bottle at the gym, hoping for a refreshing sip, but the lack of condensation tells you the ice is long gone. Enter the insulated tumbler. Its sleek design and solid feel promise better. You twist the cap, hearing the secure click, and fill it with ice-cold water. Hours later, after a grueling workout, you twist the lid open. The water is still ice-cold, the ice cubes clinking inside. It's a small victory, a moment of pure satisfaction.

The calendar is still stuck on Sunday the 13th of July, and I will let it remain that way. I guess my mind is stuck there as well.

The books you sorted in alphabetical order are now all over the place. Even the poetry books. I’m so sorry, I’ve just been looking frantically for something. An answer, maybe even a question. Anything that will get my blood flowing again.

I barely eat anymore, I’m unable to match the level of your cooking so I might as well avoid trying. Today I’ve only had three cups of black coffee. I’ve reused the same cup a few times, I know that’s not good. I also get a bit too impatient every time I fill it. I should let the coffee cool down, but I seem to prefer those blisters on the roof of my mouth.

Some teenagers were screaming outside the apartment earlier. I know you would’ve run out to see what was happening, and if there was anything you could do to help. I just opened the balcony door and listened. Then I got cold and closed it again. I think they were just playing around.

I have watered the flowers as promised, but I haven’t truly considered them. Things are tidy enough, but I haven’t been dusting properly. The milk is sour.

I do however believe that she sounded her best on that TV show. How come she managed to sing in a completely different style? Can a vocalist just change their technique with the snap of their finger like that? 

I wish she'd had the opportunity to sing Korean OSTs during her time in BLACKPINK, it's such a shame that it'll probably never happen now except we no longer have YG to blame for her lack of promotions in South Korea or Korean music.

You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip.

1p43dhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/runaway/comments/1p43dhi/wisconsin_runaways_and_those_who_can_get_to/,"Wisconsin Runaways (and those who can get to Wisconsin), please read this!","I'm an 18-year-old girl in Wisconsin, and I know a safe place for any runaways in or near Wisconsin. Pittsville, Wisconsin is a small town where you can disappear. Everyone's close, it's kind of like a massive family almost, and most people are very welcoming here. There's several job opportunities within walking distance depending on where you end up living, and depending on when you read this, Woodco Apartments might have a spot for you. The Cranberry Creamery is within walking distance and you can get coffee there, as well as massive ice creams (3 scoops for $5!) for those who have a sweet tooth, and everything's real local. You can create a new identity there and no one will ask too many questions. Schools are great for those still in school, highest rated in the state last I checked and I personally loved my time at their high school. People are friendly and welcoming, and for anyone who needs an extra hand, they offer free breakfast and lunch to many students who need extra support. 

Also, I want to offer a word of advice--if you do move here, Kaiden Sherwood isn't a great person, and I recommend not getting involved with him. He's hurt a lot of people, including some of my closest friends, so I hope you'll stay away from him. Also, if anyone with the last name Veldman offers you a place to stay, decline and get out of there. A guy named Bob Veldman recently graduated, and he's sexually harassed a lot of girls, including freshman girls. I can't speak for the rest of his family, but I can tell you for a fact Bob is definitely someone you want to stay away from, especially for any fem-presenting runaways. 

People I *would* recommend going to are the Topping family (reference picture to AJ Topping [here](https://www.facebook.com/PittsvilleWISD/photos/-put-your-hands-together-for-our-phs-october-students-of-the-month-wearepittsvil/1299828575490541/)), Marissa Peterson (counselor at the high school), Tracy Dinkmeyer (an English teacher at the high school and a successful runaway), Derek Menzer (a history teacher at the high school that's genuinely amazing), Ms. Florence (a science teacher at the high school with 4 kids and a patience span a mile long), and the Zickert family (Gina Zickert used to be part of the school's special needs program, she retired though). If you find AJ, let him know you're with Rosegore and he'll do whatever he can to help; for Ms. Dinkmeyer, tell her Kaiya (Kai-yuh) sent you and she'll do the same. Her and I talked about helping my bestie Mason runaway, and she ran away at 17, so she knows quite a bit about how to survive on your own. 

I doubt many people will actually follow this, and I don't blame you. I know I'm just a girl on the internet and a lot of you probably immediately assume I'm trying to traffick you, but *please* at least consider moving to Pittsville if you're in the area. I'm one of those few people who's trying to help without asking anything in return because I know what it's like to want to runaway and need somewhere safe. I'm not asking you to meet me or anything, just offering a place to stay. We moved to Pittsville 4 years ago today and I went from an antisocial wreck to actually thriving here, and I want to help others do the same.",3,1763843426.0,runaway,1,1.0,False

I’m a 32 year old male who still can’t decide if coffee is my personality or just my coping mechanism. I’ve mastered the art of parallel parking (most days), can cook and once fixed a leaky faucet all by myself, so yeah, basically husband material. 

I live together with my fluffy dog and recently bought myself a house. I really enjoy working around the house and taking care of my plants. When I'm not doing anything above I spend a lot of hours working full-time as a social worker.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

I made him about 8 - 10 years ago. 

He was my first OC that I really liked and devolved. 

I only drew him traditionally before so this is my first time drawing him, digitally.

I only got the idea for creating him when I had a line up of dreams with him in it.

From his abilities he can do this weird thing were he punches someone in the stomach and then they get separated from their body and he can either control their bodies or talk to their spirits, kinda like what the Sorcerer supreme.

He's 80 years old. he ages VERY slowly, so he looks and acts 21.

He likes tigers.

Colepolcole is very annoyed that he can't grow a beard, that's his biggest grievance. 

  
Personality wise he is very grumpy and sarcastic, a natural leader and sometimes very VERY tired, just like, done with EVERYTHING, very annoyed.

He is a coffee addict.

He is from this old super herop story I made a a LONG time ago, he is a S.H.A.R.P.I.E (Unfortunately I don't remember what it stands for) A group of teens that are experimented on.

1p4370p,https://www.reddit.com/r/HiddenTrueCrimeChat/comments/1p4370p/how_family_stories_shape_the_way_people/,"How family stories shape the way people understand morality, especially when they later build a public persona around “heritage” and “justice.”","**TL;DR:** Lauren tells a childhood story where her father bravely slipped forbidden Mormon books under the table in communist Romania — a narrative built on secrecy, rule-bending, and outsmarting an oppressive system.

But the Utah Supreme Court record of his disbarment shows a *secular version of that same pattern*:

* secret actions
* bending rules
* concealing money
* defying oversight
* framing himself as unfairly treated

Same **structure**, different **context**.

This helps explain why Lauren still sees him as a persecuted hero, and why she and Dr. John now frame criticism the same way: **as persecution, not accountability.**

In Lauren Matthias’s Mormon Stories interview, she tells a dramatic story about her father during the Ceausescu era:

·         spies everywhere

·         slipping the Book of Mormon under the table to interested Romanians

·         bribing doctors with cigarettes

·         subverting an oppressive regime

·         protecting the family through secrecy

·         doing “what had to be done” even when rules said otherwise

It’s told as a **hero story**: brave, righteous, risky, and morally elevated.

But when you look at the court documents from his later disbarment, the *structure* of the behavior is strikingly similar — just without the religious framing.

From the Utah Supreme Court’s findings:

·         he settled a case without client authorization

·         he concealed the truth

·         he kept $28,800 of client funds

·         he refused to return it despite repeated demands

·         he offered “no satisfactory explanation”

·         the facts were “undisputed”

·         he was disbarred for misappropriation of client money

Later, he was also convicted by federal juries of:

·         securities fraud

·         mortgage fraud

·         money laundering

·         wire/mail fraud

·         violating parole

  
Again, **Lauren is not responsible for this**. But the *pattern* is relevant to how she frames her family and her own credibility in the true crime space.

**The narrative patterns match in form, even if the content is different**

**In Romania (the story Lauren tells):**

Covert actions = righteous  
Rule-bending = heroic  
Secrecy = necessary  
System = hostile  
Identity = persecuted but noble

**In the fraud/disbarment cases (the court documents):**

Covert actions = concealing misconduct  
Rule-bending = misusing authority  
Secrecy = hiding funds  
System = blamed when consequences appear  
Identity = claimed innocence despite evidence

It’s the **same narrative template**, but one is spiritualized and one is criminalized.

**Why this matters**

When someone grows up with a story where:

* secrecy = survival
* bending rules = moral courage
* outside authority = unfair or oppressive
* family = righteous victims of misunderstanding
* being “persecuted” = proof you’re right

…it becomes easier to see yourself through that same lens as an adult.

And now in her public life:

* she describes her father as “remarkable,” “innocent,” and unfairly accused
* she and her husband frame critics as persecutors
* they send cease-and-desist letters to dissenting creators
* they present themselves as unjustly targeted truth-tellers

It’s not a coincidence.  
It’s an inherited narrative structure.

Not pathology — just a family myth shaping adult interpretation of events.

 **Transcript of the Mormon Stories Interview:**  

**Lauren:** *And then, um, I think, and then on my dad's side, I even have some that actually were in the Mexican colony - I think. With the Romneys. I mean, there, there's a wide range, but I am, I am LDS blood through and through. And then, I–My parents met at BYU. That’s how you meet. And then I was born in New York City, while my dad was attending Columbia Law School. I was a mistake. They already had two boys in a very small apartment in New York City. And so, um, I came along. So, I had two older brothers. Then we lived in Brooklyn for a while. My dad practiced. And then, the family actually moved to Romania, for a time. Um, it was my dad . . . had a Fulbright scholarship there, uh, studying international law because it was a, it was a communist country at the time. It was under the dictator Ceaușescu. And so . . . a lot of stories growing up, of how he had to hold me - I was a toddler at the time - you know, in the food lines in order to get food. How there were spies everywhere and they had to slip the Book of Mormon to someone underneath the table that was interested. How they had to bribe the doctors with cigarettes to treat my older brother. And so, there was a . . . lot of lessons, uh, when I was younger about how important freedom of religion is and accepting everyone.*

*And then in New York, though too, and, and I love this about my parents: how they taught diversity. You know my dad would always teach about respect of other religions too. Well, he was proud of our LDS heritage. He would always tell the story of being in this small apartment student housing in New York City and our neighbors were Orthodox Jews and how they helped on another. And they didn't want to operate machinery on the Sabbath. And so they would come over and they would knock, not ring the doorbell, but knock on my parents door and say, ""Can you come push the elevator buttons for them on the Sabbath day so that they could keep their Sabbath Holy. And so I was also, always growing, I always grew up with the idea that you did say ‘happy holidays’ and not ‘Merry Christmas’ and that you respect everybody's religions; and that we . . we kept coffee in our cupboard, if we had friends come over that were visiting . . that drank that. And so it was more of a very, I think I had a lot of LDS pride and a lot of like heritage kind of a feeling to it, like this is us; and someone else might be . . Jewish, and- and so that's something I want to kind of put out there too. Because I think that formed a lot of how I thought about my faith. And then I . . . we moved to Salt Lake City. That’s where I started . . kindergarten. And from there –*

I know because I torched my life with flamethrowers and regret. Rock bottom left me isolated, no one left to lean on, and trying to go it alone? That's a recipe for slips. But turning inward, focusing on small, consistent steps, I started crafting a new network from scratch. No pleading for old ties; just building fresh ones grounded in shared growth.

In my book, I talk about ""Guys Night""—that simple gathering I kicked off with a few sober dudes facing the same grind. No fancy agenda, just real talk around a fire pit or coffee, sharing wins, triggers, and Stoic reflections. It wasn't about fixing each other; it was accountability without judgment, like mapping behavior chains together. Sure, it was slow at first, but it reclaimed my stability. Those sudden lulls didn't lead to cravings, because I had a crew to text or meet. In the S.O.B.E.R. Method, this ties into Restore: Release isolation's blame, then Execute by seeking or starting your own circle. Church groups, sober meetups, or online forums (like this one). Start small, show up consistent, and watch trust build naturally.

But there’s more: he claims he feels *a sturdy stage foot in every crowd*. That’s what the dance floor felt like when I moved to a subscription to BuildX, the local community center. He says, “Room reading? A certain height is helpful,” but in my memory, the line after the teachers’ desk is the thing that stops me from feeling small
