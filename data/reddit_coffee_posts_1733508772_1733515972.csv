I'm 5 years carnivore, fully fat adapted, omad+ (extra meat/fat within 90 minutes occasionally), entertainment items ingested daily 3 cups of coffee up to 9:30am.

I started getting strange dizzy spells when getting up to urinate at night, I get up a couple times and thought it might be electrolytes and have added some supplements for potassium, magnesium and also B6 which are typically low on a carnivore way of eating.
Electrolyte addiction hasn't helped.

Could the A/C unit (which looks old) be sending mold into my room at night? I will try to swap to using a fan but was wondering if anyone else came across this symptom in the tropics. (Been here for 9 weeks and use the a/c only for sleeping.

But nothing—nothing—compares to what happened in the summer of 2018.

It was the graveyard shift. The stillness of the night had a way of amplifying every sound, every shadow. Most nights were the usual mix of speeding drivers and DUI stops. That night started no differently.

I was stationed at my usual spot near mile marker 62, radar gun in hand, coffee thermos perched on the dash. The radio buzzed with routine chatter. Then, just as I was finishing my second cup of coffee, the radio chatted in.

“Any available units near Route 18, we have a 10-90.”

I was confused, I’d never heard that code before.

“HQ, this is Unit 504. What’s a 10-90?”

Silence.

“HQ?”

No response. Just static.

Seconds later, coordinates popped up on my patrol car’s computer. It was an isolated patch off the highway, deep in the woods. Uneasy, I radioed my supervisor.

“Hey, Sarge, HQ just paged me about a 10-90. What’s the protocol?”

His response was curt. “Ignore it. It wasn’t meant for you.”

“Seriously? They gave me coordinates—”

“Drop it, 504. Get back to work.”

I hesitated, but orders were orders. The night dragged on with routine stops. Around 3 a.m., exhaustion hit, so I pulled into a donut shop. Yeah, I know the stereotype, but sometimes you just need the sugar rush.

The shop was a dive—peeling paint, flickering neon sign—but it was open. Behind the counter stood a man so pale he looked like he’d been carved from marble. His fingers were unnaturally long, and he moved with a stiffness that gave me the creeps.

“What’ll it be?” His voice was raspy, like dead leaves rustling.

“Just coffee. And a couple of glazed.”

He slid my order across the counter without a word. His gaze lingered on me, unblinking, as if he were memorizing my face.

“Long night?” he asked, his lips curling into a faint, unnatural smile.

“Yeah. Graveyard shift. Never gets easier.”

He chuckled—a low, guttural sound that made my skin crawl. “Be careful out there. You never know what might be lurking.”

I left in a hurry, the bell above the door jangling behind me. I was halfway to my car when the radio crackled again.

“Help me.”

The voice was faint, distorted, but unmistakably human.

I froze, my heart hammering.

“HQ, this is Unit 504. Did someone just broadcast a distress call?”

No response.

I tried my supervisor. Nothing.

Curiosity gnawed at me. Against my better judgment, I punched the coordinates into my GPS and set off.

The drive took me 45 minutes, deep into the highway forest. The road narrowed until it was barely more than a dirt path. My headlights cut through the thick darkness, revealing gnarled trees that seemed to close in around me.

When the GPS announced I’d arrived, I was in the middle of nowhere. I stepped out of the car, gun holstered, flashlight in hand. The silence was unnatural—not a single insect, not even the rustle of leaves.

I radioed again. “HQ, this is 504. I’m at the coordinates. What’s going on?”

Static.

I took a step forward. The ground was hard beneath my boots, but I couldn’t hear my own footsteps. The air felt heavy, oppressive.

Then, behind me, a twig snapped.

I spun around, flashlight beam slicing through the darkness. Nothing.

“Who’s there?” I called, unholstering my gun.

The radio crackled to life again.

“HELP ME.”

The voice was deafening, as if it were screaming directly into my skull. I dropped the radio, clutching my ears.

Before I could react, a heavy blow struck the back of my head, and everything went black.



I woke up tied to a tree. My hands and feet were bound with rough rope, my head throbbing. The air reeked of damp earth and something metallic—blood, maybe.

Three hooded figures stood before me, their faces obscured. They whispered among themselves, their voices low and guttural.

One stepped forward. “Why did you come here?”

“I... I got a call. A distress call,” I stammered.

“Why are you here?” the figure repeated, more forcefully.

“I was just doing my job! Look, killing me won’t do you any good. My team knows I’m out here. They’ll come looking—”

They whispered among themselves again, then one of them nodded.

“Let him go,” the leader said.

Another figure stepped forward, cutting my bonds. My legs were weak, but I managed to stand.

“Take your gun. Leave. Do not come back.”

I didn’t need to be told twice. I grabbed my weapon and stumbled back toward my car. My head swam, and my limbs felt heavy, like I’d been drugged.

As I made my way down the path, figures began emerging from the shadows—dozens of them, their faces pale and featureless.

“Don’t come back,” they chanted in unison. “Don’t come back.”

I reached my car and sped out of there, not daring to look in the rearview mirror.

The next morning, I reported everything to my supervisor. He dismissed it as exhaustion-induced hallucinations and put me on paid leave. But I know what I saw.

Even now, years later, I can’t shake the feeling that they’re still watching me. I kept one of my radios as a memento of my time on the force. Sometimes, late at night, it crackles to life.

“Help me,” the voice whispers.

And sometimes... it calls my name.

Tonight, I’ve made up my mind. I’m going back. I don’t care what’s waiting for me in those woods. I need answers.

*Wish me luck.*

This creature is often associated with sleep and dreams, but can just as easily cause nightmares or insomnia. Crossing the Sandman is never recommended, as he is capable - and all too willing - to force his victims into insanity with restless, fitful sleep.*

*The Sandman is the only creature known to have the ability to bring people into and out of the Worlds Between. While most fairies can utilize the Worlds Between for communicating with those in the human world, none of them are capable of fully entering the wakeless world on their own. It has been speculated that some of those ushered into the Worlds Between by the Sandman are abandoned there.

*Fortunately, this fairy is generally a benevolent force. He meticulously measures out just enough of his enchanted dust to help each individual fall asleep, and has been seen wistfully watching over those under his influence. It is understood that this entity rarely wishes harm upon others, rather, he may withhold sleep from those with a guilty conscience.* 

Summer gets to her room and finally kicks off her heels. The hardwood flooring in her room provides a comforting chill to her soles, nibbling up through her thin socks as her feet press down. A relaxing sigh spills from her chest as she takes a moment to unwind from the madness consuming her life, and she closes her eyes to find greater grounding. 

“*Friday…*,” she says with an exhale.

It had hardly dawned on her before, but the weekend had now snuck up on her. The week had been such a blur since tripping headfirst into the hidden world, and she pauses a little longer to find more stability. Her back presses against her closed door, and she tips her head to the solid barrier behind her while taking another deep breath. There was a rising desire to call her father for help, but she knew it wouldn’t do any good. Not that he *wouldn’t* help, but how could she ever expect him - or anyone to believe *any* of this? In the time it would take to convince someone who has always been there for her, she could maybe, *just* maybe, be done with the list on her own.

The coin is unusually heavy in her hand. She opens her eyes and lets them trace the design minted into Gavin’s coin. Rather than place the coin under her pillow right away, Summer decides to store it in her *Keepsakes* box. She kneels onto the floor and pulls the box closer to her, then opens it with a sentimental smile. The ‘fairy’ notes her father wrote when she was a little girl are a welcome sight, and she finds herself wishing it could all be so simple. A soft, quiet laugh sneaks out as she thinks how strange it is to prefer normalcy over the magic she had tripped and fallen into.

After a moment of hesitation, Summer tosses the coin onto her bed and closes the box, then slides it back into her closet. She rises to her feet and searches for some more comfortable clothing. Summer has no intention of letting the remaining days slip by unproductively, and she made a promise to help her friend. With any luck, she would be able to locate the remaining items required by the Collective and put this all behind her. Her nose crinkles with a grimace, but she puts the thought of unexpected amendments or contract renewals out of her mind.

The deep blue blazer and skirt get haphazardly tossed into a nearby clothes hamper, and Summer notes how full the plastic basket is getting when the emerald blouse lands on top of the growing pile. She makes a mental note to do laundry sooner rather than later while peeling one knee-high sock down her leg. A more jovial part of her bubbles to the surface as she playfully tosses one sock, then another into the basket.

She turns to her bed and looks at the chosen attire, hoping it will suit her needs for what lies ahead. The dark blue of her pants lightens as she pulls them up, and she turns herself in front of the mirror to check for any unexpected holes in the stretchy material. Her top grips her chest firmly, holding everything in place with the Temutatio sliding across the smooth fabric as she prepares to put on a gray hoodie. With anklet socks wrapped snug around her feet within a pair of worn sneakers, she feels confident and ready to go.

Summer trots out of her room with renewed vigor. A more enthusiastic breath inflates her lungs before rushing out again, and she smiles brightly at Gavin. The leprechaun had continued to pace in her absence, and Summer was momentarily surprised to see another little cup of coffee in his hand.

The leprechaun glances up from the cup tipped to his mouth, and Summer sees his eyes flick down to her shoes. He nearly spits out his drink while looking at his much more casually dressed roommate, and Summer chuckles as the leprechaun’s cheeks take a redder shade. His eyes widen when Summer holds his coin up. 

“It might be best for you to hold onto this for now,” Summer says with a smirk.

She tosses the golden coin to Gavin, who effortlessly snatches it from the air. The relief striking his face threatens to shatter her heart, and she scolds herself internally at even *thinking* to rob him of something so valuable.

“We only have two more days,” she explains. “I don’t have any intention of leaving you without a single coin. Let’s go find the rest.”

Gavin visibly relaxes at the admission, and a softness returns to his eyes. He sends the little cup away with a flick of his wrist, and it vanishes before having the chance to clatter to the ground.

“Are ya sure? It won’t be the easiest-”

“Right now,” Summer cuts in, “I have a solid burst of energy. You know where more of your coins are, let’s go get them.”

An excited giggle shivers out of Gavin, and he nods with uncontainable glee. The knowledge of where his gold is still nags in the back of his mind, but he can already feel the dreaded unpleasantness creeping in. If he were to tell Summer where they’re heading now, would she really want to help?

“Wonderful!” he exclaims. The leprechaun tugs at the open edges of his long coat as he heads toward the door. “Oh- bring your seein’ stone!”

Summer had started to follow him when he made the suggestion. She turns and looks at the table, then glances back at Gavin.

“Uh- sure,” she agrees. “Ok…”

“We gotta find a way into the faerealm,” Gavin explains. “That’ll help ya find a gateway.”

The flat stone scrapes across the surface of the table as Summer collects it. She turns to Gavin, fighting to keep the disbelief from her face while walking back over to him at the door.

“Still strugglin’ to accept everythin’, huh?” he asks with a smirk. 

Summer nods, but slips the stone into the pocket in her hoodie nonetheless. They walk quietly to the elevator, with neither able to bring themselves to break the silence. The doors slide open, and Summer glances back down the hall at her closed door one last time before following Gavin into the elevator.

“My portal is on the other side of the country,” Gavin explains. “I haven’t really bothered tryin’ to find one here, who even *knows* where it would lead.”

“I guess I thought they would take you where you want to go?” Summer admits with a furrowed brow. “They all go to the fairy world, though?”

“The faerealm, yeah,” he replies, nodding his head as they ride down. “But, it’s not as easy as steppin’ into one and *presto*. Well, it *is*, but…”

The elevator rattles to a halt at the ground floor, and they both look at the shut doors. A second passes, then another, and Summer is reminded of why she hates the elevator. There have been too many times when the stubborn doors take horrifyingly long to open, and she was always certain that *this* would be the time they simply remained closed. Both occupants let out a relieved sigh when the doors slid open following a muffled *ding*, and their eyes met before they chuckled together.

“Easier than an *elevator*, anyway,” Gavin adds with a smirk. “They’re kinda… geologically locked? I guess?”

“You guess?” Summer replies quickly, glancing over at him while walking to the apartment complex’s door.

Gavin shrugs before continuing. “Hey, I ain’t ever done a study or nothin’, but every portal I been through always seems to lead to the same spot on the other side. My portal takes me into my bedroom closet back home, and others have established similar connections. Takes some doin’, though.”

“‘*Takes some doin*’,” Summer repeats, considering what the leprechaun was telling her. “So, in other words, I can’t just wish for another one to open up and lead us right to your gold.”

It wasn’t a question, but Gavin nodded his answer anyway. He sighs as they reach the sidewalk beside the street, and a gust of wind races after a passing car.

“Not that simple, I’m afraid.” He strokes his beard in one hand and laughs, “If I had all my gold? Maybe. But I ain’t got enough access to the magic for it just now.”

Summer takes the smooth, flat stone from the pocket of her hoodie and holds it in the open palm of her hand. She rubs a finger along the curve of the stone’s hole, and looks at the storefronts across the street. The convenience store she walked out of (without even being inside) sits next to a realtor. On the other side is a vintage game shop, and on the other side of that is a bakery. The scent of fresh baked bread hangs in the air as she holds the stone to her eye.

“So, am I supposed to just…” she says with a hint of frustration in her voice. Her free hand gestures around, “...tape this to my glasses and look *everywhere*?”

“Ya *could*,” Gavin responds, and Summer can hear the smirk in his tone. “Would be hilarious.”

An annoyed sigh rushes from Summer as she rolls her eyes. There’s clearly plenty more the leprechaun hasn’t said, and the young woman is getting frustrated with all these people withholding important information. The lack of much needed information is how she got into this mess in the first place, after all.

“I *live* to entertain,” she says sarcastically.

Gavin takes note of her obvious annoyance and glances down the street. While his coastal location is still fairly unknown, he has a pretty good idea of where to start.

“There’s a shop for wannabe witches not far from here,” he supplies. “Herbs, crystals, things people *think* have magic properties. Those kinda places will usually have some kind of portal nearby.”

Summer stashes her stone back into the pocket of her hoodie and retrieves her phone. The shop sounds familiar, though she’s certainly never been there. She unlocks the device’s screen and accesses her maps app, then watches as the phone’s GPS finds her position. 

The map on her phone zooms in on their location enough for the names of individual locations to begin showing up. Without really *knowing* what she’s looking for, Summer drags her finger across the screen in search of anything ‘witchy.’ She rolls her eyes and smirks at her foolishness, then taps the search icon at the top of the screen.

“Whacha lookin’ for?” Gavin asks while Summer types in her request.

“Witchy store,” she replies with a grin.

“I gotta get me one of those,” he says quietly, watching as the image on the upside-down map zooms out with five different locations pinned.

“They *are* pretty helpful,” she agrees, then sets about finding the store closest to where they’re standing. “Looks like the nearest one is about a mile… that way.”

Summer looks up from her phone and gestures with it across the street. Another car streaks by, dragging a gust of wind behind it that makes her stagger to the side. 

“Maybe we can use one of those new cross-walks I’ve heard so much about?” Gavin says, sarcasm heavy in his voice.

“I wasn’t going to just *jump* out into traffic!” Summer retorts, but she can feel redness burning in her cheeks as she follows the leprechaun to the nearby intersection.

There are few close calls as the two make their way across the street, and before long they walk into the parking lot of a small strip mall. Several specialty stores surround the parking area, along with a couple chain outlets featuring shoes, sports gear, games and collectables, spices, and toys. Wedged into the corner, squeezed between a clothing outfitter advertising summer clearance prices and a spirits outlet, is what looks like an over-the-top witch store, “*Glamors Galore*.”

Summer and Gavin stand on the sidewalk outside the store, peering in through the windows at the assorted goods on display. Crystals and carved stone figurines are neatly arranged on three-level-shelves along the windows, and robes of varying lengths and colors line one wall all the way to the back of the store. In the middle of the store are several shelves with tarot cards, ouija boards, incense and burners, several bundles of herbs, and dozens of baggies and little boxes. Closer to the counter is another row of shelves, this one heavy with books packed so tight that only their spines are on display.

“This place?” Summer asks with disbelief.

Gavin shrugs, then pulls the door open and ushers her through. An overwhelming combination of potent fragrances assaults their senses as they enter the store, and Summer stifles a cough while her mind struggles to identify the cacophony. Her eyes begin to water, and she’s relieved to find herself gradually acclimating to the sudden change.

“Sure, it’s a bit… overly commercialized,” Gavin admits. He scans the shelves and displays, but it’s obvious he’s not looking for anything advertised. “Ya just gotta keep an open mind when lookin’ for this kinda stuff.”

“Your boyfriend is wise beyond his years…”

Summer nearly drops the seeing stone as she pulls it from the pocket in her hoodie when the store’s attendant suddenly speaks. She hadn’t even noticed the older woman before, but her eyes are fixated on the woman dressed in an excessive amount of new-age paraphernalia. From the wide-lens spectacles to the dreamcatcher earrings, to the scarlet robes with symbols woven into the fabric with golden strings and crystals, she was effectively a walking billboard for her store. There were even polished beads shimmering in her lengthy silvered hair.

“Oh, he’s not my-” the young woman begins, trying to be friendly while fumbling with the flat stone in her pocket.

“Husband, then,” the storekeeper finishes with a knowing smirk. “It *is* best to keep an open mind when coming across something unfamiliar.”

“uhhh-Yeah,” Gavin says with a quiet chuckle. “Over here, wifey.”

The shopkeeper puts on her friendliest smile, and Summer decides to ignore all of its implications while turning away and moving over to her *not* boyfriend. Gavin grins at her, and is clearly trying not to laugh as the shopkeeper makes her way back to the counter. 

“What do ya see back there, *hon*?” he asks, pointing to a door in the back of the shop.

She looks at the slightly ajar door and sighs. It’s just a regular door, in a regular shop, separating customers from a regular storage area. At least, that’s what anyone *else* might think. If Summer hadn’t been introduced to the undeniable world of magic, she wouldn’t think anything of the partially open door. Instead, she holds the seeing stone up to her eye to see what Gavin might be pointing out, and a shiver of excitement dances down her spine.

While the door was just a basic, average, everyday sort, the light spilling through the opening most certainly was not. Summer moves the stone from her eye as if to do a double-take, and draws a sharp breath while looking through the hole worn in the stone’s surface. With her naked eye, the door seems to lead into the shadows of a room with the lights off. Through the stone, she sees a shimmering violet haze illuminating the open door with confusing brightness. *How-* how is it that something as basic as *light* can’t be seen without-

“Do ya see it?” Gavin prods.

He takes a step forward, then looks back at the stunned woman. Summer closes her mouth after realizing it was hanging open, and follows her leprechaun *friend*. For some annoying reason, she feels compelled to tell herself that he’s just a friend, and she rolls her eyes internally at how such a simple assumption had rubbed her the wrong way. She tries to push it from her mind, a task that is all too easy while approaching the door. 

“Is there something I can help you find?” the shopkeeper asks.

Summer spins around to see the older woman right behind her. She’s so startled that the stone nearly falls from her hand, but she manages to maintain her grip on the flat rock.

“Yeah, actually,” Gavin replies. He stands beside and slightly behind Summer, and places his hand on her far hip before continuing. “We’re lookin’ for somethin’... *special*.”

His fingers press into Summer’s hip as he wordlessly guides her back from the shopkeeper. Summer resists at first, but quickly catches on to her leprechaun’s game and steps to the side. She pretends to examine the colorful books on the shelf in front of her, running her finger down the spine of a blue book without actually reading it. Her attention was on the door just a few steps away, and the conversation Gavin was having with the shopkeeper.

“Crystals, maybe?” he continues. “What can ya tell me about the figurines on that shelf?”

“The- are you looking for any figure in particular?” the shopkeeper asks, a confused hesitance in her voice.

Gavin reaches a hand towards the older woman and gently caresses her shoulder. His fingers rub down to her elbow as a nearly imperceptible golden flash flickers in his eyes.

“Unicorn?” he asks, “Two horns, though? In amethyst, I believe I saw one on those shelves at the front?”

Without another word, the shopkeeper nods and starts walking to the front of her store. Gavin turns on a heel and beckons Summer to follow as he hurries to the open door in the back. Summer’s heart beats rapidly as they rush into the back room, and she fights through the strict morality and lawfulness she had followed all her life. It wasn’t like they were trying to *steal* anything, just-

Before the thought can fully form in her head to assure her that sneaking somewhere she didn’t belong was fine so long as they didn’t take anything, her surroundings shatter. Violet light burns through the fissures of her reality, and the fractured pieces of the storage area fall into the blinding light. She throws her arm over her eyes and closes them reflexively to shield them from harm, and shrieks as the world twirls around her.",0,1733515467.0,stories,0,0.5,False

After a moment of hesitation, Summer tosses the coin onto her bed and closes the box, then slides it back into her closet. She rises to her feet and searches for some more comfortable clothing. Summer has no intention of letting the remaining days slip by unproductively, and she made a promise to help her friend. With any luck, she would be able to locate the remaining items required by the Collective and put this all behind her. Her nose crinkles with a grimace, but she puts the thought of unexpected amendments or contract renewals out of her mind.

The deep blue blazer and skirt get haphazardly tossed into a nearby clothes hamper, and Summer notes how full the plastic basket is getting when the emerald blouse lands on top of the growing pile. She makes a mental note to do laundry sooner rather than later while peeling one knee-high sock down her leg. A more jovial part of her bubbles to the surface as she playfully tosses one sock, then another into the basket.

She turns to her bed and looks at the chosen attire, hoping it will suit her needs for what lies ahead. The dark blue of her pants lightens as she pulls them up, and she turns herself in front of the mirror to check for any unexpected holes in the stretchy material. Her top grips her chest firmly, holding everything in place with the Temutatio sliding across the smooth fabric as she prepares to put on a gray hoodie. With anklet socks wrapped snug around her feet within a pair of worn sneakers, she feels confident and ready to go.

Summer trots out of her room with renewed vigor. A more enthusiastic breath inflates her lungs before rushing out again, and she smiles brightly at Gavin. The leprechaun had continued to pace in her absence, and Summer was momentarily surprised to see another little cup of coffee in his hand.

The leprechaun glances up from the cup tipped to his mouth, and Summer sees his eyes flick down to her shoes. He nearly spits out his drink while looking at his much more casually dressed roommate, and Summer chuckles as the leprechaun’s cheeks take a redder shade. His eyes widen when Summer holds his coin up. 

“It might be best for you to hold onto this for now,” Summer says with a smirk.

She tosses the golden coin to Gavin, who effortlessly snatches it from the air. The relief striking his face threatens to shatter her heart, and she scolds herself internally at even *thinking* to rob him of something so valuable.

“We only have two more days,” she explains. “I don’t have any intention of leaving you without a single coin. Let’s go find the rest.”

Gavin visibly relaxes at the admission, and a softness returns to his eyes. He sends the little cup away with a flick of his wrist, and it vanishes before having the chance to clatter to the ground.

“Are ya sure? It won’t be the easiest-”

“Right now,” Summer cuts in, “I have a solid burst of energy. You know where more of your coins are, let’s go get them.”

An excited giggle shivers out of Gavin, and he nods with uncontainable glee. The knowledge of where his gold is still nags in the back of his mind, but he can already feel the dreaded unpleasantness creeping in. If he were to tell Summer where they’re heading now, would she really want to help?

“Wonderful!” he exclaims. The leprechaun tugs at the open edges of his long coat as he heads toward the door. “Oh- bring your seein’ stone!”

Summer had started to follow him when he made the suggestion. She turns and looks at the table, then glances back at Gavin.

“Uh- sure,” she agrees. “Ok…”

“We gotta find a way into the faerealm,” Gavin explains. “That’ll help ya find a gateway.”

The flat stone scrapes across the surface of the table as Summer collects it. She turns to Gavin, fighting to keep the disbelief from her face while walking back over to him at the door.

“Still strugglin’ to accept everythin’, huh?” he asks with a smirk. 

Summer nods, but slips the stone into the pocket in her hoodie nonetheless. They walk quietly to the elevator, with neither able to bring themselves to break the silence. The doors slide open, and Summer glances back down the hall at her closed door one last time before following Gavin into the elevator.

“My portal is on the other side of the country,” Gavin explains. “I haven’t really bothered tryin’ to find one here, who even *knows* where it would lead.”

“I guess I thought they would take you where you want to go?” Summer admits with a furrowed brow. “They all go to the fairy world, though?”

“The faerealm, yeah,” he replies, nodding his head as they ride down. “But, it’s not as easy as steppin’ into one and *presto*. Well, it *is*, but…”

The elevator rattles to a halt at the ground floor, and they both look at the shut doors. A second passes, then another, and Summer is reminded of why she hates the elevator. There have been too many times when the stubborn doors take horrifyingly long to open, and she was always certain that *this* would be the time they simply remained closed. Both occupants let out a relieved sigh when the doors slid open following a muffled *ding*, and their eyes met before they chuckled together.

“Easier than an *elevator*, anyway,” Gavin adds with a smirk. “They’re kinda… geologically locked? I guess?”

“You guess?” Summer replies quickly, glancing over at him while walking to the apartment complex’s door.

Gavin shrugs before continuing. “Hey, I ain’t ever done a study or nothin’, but every portal I been through always seems to lead to the same spot on the other side. My portal takes me into my bedroom closet back home, and others have established similar connections. Takes some doin’, though.”

“‘*Takes some doin*’,” Summer repeats, considering what the leprechaun was telling her. “So, in other words, I can’t just wish for another one to open up and lead us right to your gold.”

It wasn’t a question, but Gavin nodded his answer anyway. He sighs as they reach the sidewalk beside the street, and a gust of wind races after a passing car.

“Not that simple, I’m afraid.” He strokes his beard in one hand and laughs, “If I had all my gold? Maybe. But I ain’t got enough access to the magic for it just now.”

Summer takes the smooth, flat stone from the pocket of her hoodie and holds it in the open palm of her hand. She rubs a finger along the curve of the stone’s hole, and looks at the storefronts across the street. The convenience store she walked out of (without even being inside) sits next to a realtor. On the other side is a vintage game shop, and on the other side of that is a bakery. The scent of fresh baked bread hangs in the air as she holds the stone to her eye.

“So, am I supposed to just…” she says with a hint of frustration in her voice. Her free hand gestures around, “...tape this to my glasses and look *everywhere*?”

“Ya *could*,” Gavin responds, and Summer can hear the smirk in his tone. “Would be hilarious.”

An annoyed sigh rushes from Summer as she rolls her eyes. There’s clearly plenty more the leprechaun hasn’t said, and the young woman is getting frustrated with all these people withholding important information. The lack of much needed information is how she got into this mess in the first place, after all.

“I *live* to entertain,” she says sarcastically.

Gavin takes note of her obvious annoyance and glances down the street. While his coastal location is still fairly unknown, he has a pretty good idea of where to start.

“There’s a shop for wannabe witches not far from here,” he supplies. “Herbs, crystals, things people *think* have magic properties. Those kinda places will usually have some kind of portal nearby.”

Summer stashes her stone back into the pocket of her hoodie and retrieves her phone. The shop sounds familiar, though she’s certainly never been there. She unlocks the device’s screen and accesses her maps app, then watches as the phone’s GPS finds her position. 

The map on her phone zooms in on their location enough for the names of individual locations to begin showing up. Without really *knowing* what she’s looking for, Summer drags her finger across the screen in search of anything ‘witchy.’ She rolls her eyes and smirks at her foolishness, then taps the search icon at the top of the screen.

“Whacha lookin’ for?” Gavin asks while Summer types in her request.

“Witchy store,” she replies with a grin.

“I gotta get me one of those,” he says quietly, watching as the image on the upside-down map zooms out with five different locations pinned.

“They *are* pretty helpful,” she agrees, then sets about finding the store closest to where they’re standing. “Looks like the nearest one is about a mile… that way.”

Summer looks up from her phone and gestures with it across the street. Another car streaks by, dragging a gust of wind behind it that makes her stagger to the side. 

“Maybe we can use one of those new cross-walks I’ve heard so much about?” Gavin says, sarcasm heavy in his voice.

“I wasn’t going to just *jump* out into traffic!” Summer retorts, but she can feel redness burning in her cheeks as she follows the leprechaun to the nearby intersection.

There are few close calls as the two make their way across the street, and before long they walk into the parking lot of a small strip mall. Several specialty stores surround the parking area, along with a couple chain outlets featuring shoes, sports gear, games and collectables, spices, and toys. Wedged into the corner, squeezed between a clothing outfitter advertising summer clearance prices and a spirits outlet, is what looks like an over-the-top witch store, “*Glamors Galore*.”

Summer and Gavin stand on the sidewalk outside the store, peering in through the windows at the assorted goods on display. Crystals and carved stone figurines are neatly arranged on three-level-shelves along the windows, and robes of varying lengths and colors line one wall all the way to the back of the store. In the middle of the store are several shelves with tarot cards, ouija boards, incense and burners, several bundles of herbs, and dozens of baggies and little boxes. Closer to the counter is another row of shelves, this one heavy with books packed so tight that only their spines are on display.

“This place?” Summer asks with disbelief.

Gavin shrugs, then pulls the door open and ushers her through. An overwhelming combination of potent fragrances assaults their senses as they enter the store, and Summer stifles a cough while her mind struggles to identify the cacophony. Her eyes begin to water, and she’s relieved to find herself gradually acclimating to the sudden change.

“Sure, it’s a bit… overly commercialized,” Gavin admits. He scans the shelves and displays, but it’s obvious he’s not looking for anything advertised. “Ya just gotta keep an open mind when lookin’ for this kinda stuff.”

“Your boyfriend is wise beyond his years…”

Summer nearly drops the seeing stone as she pulls it from the pocket in her hoodie when the store’s attendant suddenly speaks. She hadn’t even noticed the older woman before, but her eyes are fixated on the woman dressed in an excessive amount of new-age paraphernalia. From the wide-lens spectacles to the dreamcatcher earrings, to the scarlet robes with symbols woven into the fabric with golden strings and crystals, she was effectively a walking billboard for her store. There were even polished beads shimmering in her lengthy silvered hair.

“Oh, he’s not my-” the young woman begins, trying to be friendly while fumbling with the flat stone in her pocket.

“Husband, then,” the storekeeper finishes with a knowing smirk. “It *is* best to keep an open mind when coming across something unfamiliar.”

“uhhh-Yeah,” Gavin says with a quiet chuckle. “Over here, wifey.”

The shopkeeper puts on her friendliest smile, and Summer decides to ignore all of its implications while turning away and moving over to her *not* boyfriend. Gavin grins at her, and is clearly trying not to laugh as the shopkeeper makes her way back to the counter. 

“What do ya see back there, *hon*?” he asks, pointing to a door in the back of the shop.

She looks at the slightly ajar door and sighs. It’s just a regular door, in a regular shop, separating customers from a regular storage area. At least, that’s what anyone *else* might think. If Summer hadn’t been introduced to the undeniable world of magic, she wouldn’t think anything of the partially open door. Instead, she holds the seeing stone up to her eye to see what Gavin might be pointing out, and a shiver of excitement dances down her spine.

While the door was just a basic, average, everyday sort, the light spilling through the opening most certainly was not. Summer moves the stone from her eye as if to do a double-take, and draws a sharp breath while looking through the hole worn in the stone’s surface. With her naked eye, the door seems to lead into the shadows of a room with the lights off. Through the stone, she sees a shimmering violet haze illuminating the open door with confusing brightness. *How-* how is it that something as basic as *light* can’t be seen without-

“Do ya see it?” Gavin prods.

He takes a step forward, then looks back at the stunned woman. Summer closes her mouth after realizing it was hanging open, and follows her leprechaun *friend*. For some annoying reason, she feels compelled to tell herself that he’s just a friend, and she rolls her eyes internally at how such a simple assumption had rubbed her the wrong way. She tries to push it from her mind, a task that is all too easy while approaching the door. 

“Is there something I can help you find?” the shopkeeper asks.

Summer spins around to see the older woman right behind her. She’s so startled that the stone nearly falls from her hand, but she manages to maintain her grip on the flat rock.

“Yeah, actually,” Gavin replies. He stands beside and slightly behind Summer, and places his hand on her far hip before continuing. “We’re lookin’ for somethin’... *special*.”

His fingers press into Summer’s hip as he wordlessly guides her back from the shopkeeper. Summer resists at first, but quickly catches on to her leprechaun’s game and steps to the side. She pretends to examine the colorful books on the shelf in front of her, running her finger down the spine of a blue book without actually reading it. Her attention was on the door just a few steps away, and the conversation Gavin was having with the shopkeeper.

“Crystals, maybe?” he continues. “What can ya tell me about the figurines on that shelf?”

“The- are you looking for any figure in particular?” the shopkeeper asks, a confused hesitance in her voice.

Gavin reaches a hand towards the older woman and gently caresses her shoulder. His fingers rub down to her elbow as a nearly imperceptible golden flash flickers in his eyes.

“Unicorn?” he asks, “Two horns, though? In amethyst, I believe I saw one on those shelves at the front?”

Without another word, the shopkeeper nods and starts walking to the front of her store. Gavin turns on a heel and beckons Summer to follow as he hurries to the open door in the back. Summer’s heart beats rapidly as they rush into the back room, and she fights through the strict morality and lawfulness she had followed all her life. It wasn’t like they were trying to *steal* anything, just-

Before the thought can fully form in her head to assure her that sneaking somewhere she didn’t belong was fine so long as they didn’t take anything, her surroundings shatter. Violet light burns through the fissures of her reality, and the fractured pieces of the storage area fall into the blinding light. She throws her arm over her eyes and closes them reflexively to shield them from harm, and shrieks as the world twirls around her.",1,1733515450.0,story,0,1.0,False

This creature is often associated with sleep and dreams, but can just as easily cause nightmares or insomnia. Crossing the Sandman is never recommended, as he is capable - and all too willing - to force his victims into insanity with restless, fitful sleep.*

*The Sandman is the only creature known to have the ability to bring people into and out of the Worlds Between. While most fairies can utilize the Worlds Between for communicating with those in the human world, none of them are capable of fully entering the wakeless world on their own. It has been speculated that some of those ushered into the Worlds Between by the Sandman are abandoned there. Some posit this as the way some people fall into a coma, while others speculate there would simply be no physical remnant of these victims at all.*

*Fortunately, this fairy is generally a benevolent force. He meticulously measures out just enough of his enchanted dust to help each individual fall asleep, and has been seen wistfully watching over those under his influence. It is understood that this entity rarely wishes harm upon others, rather, he may withhold sleep from those with a guilty conscience.* 

Summer gets to her room and finally kicks off her heels. The hardwood flooring in her room provides a comforting chill to her soles, nibbling up through her thin socks as her feet press down. A relaxing sigh spills from her chest as she takes a moment to unwind from the madness consuming her life, and she closes her eyes to find greater grounding. 

“*Friday…*,” she says with an exhale.

It had hardly dawned on her before, but the weekend had now snuck up on her. The week had been such a blur since tripping headfirst into the hidden world, and she pauses a little longer to find more stability. Her back presses against her closed door, and she tips her head to the solid barrier behind her while taking another deep breath. There was a rising desire to call her father for help, but she knew it wouldn’t do any good. Not that he *wouldn’t* help, but how could she ever expect him - or anyone to believe *any* of this? In the time it would take to convince someone who has always been there for her, she could maybe, *just* maybe, be done with the list on her own.

The coin is unusually heavy in her hand. She opens her eyes and lets them trace the design minted into Gavin’s coin. Rather than place the coin under her pillow right away, Summer decides to store it in her *Keepsakes* box. She kneels onto the floor and pulls the box closer to her, then opens it with a sentimental smile. The ‘fairy’ notes her father wrote when she was a little girl are a welcome sight, and she finds herself wishing it could all be so simple. A soft, quiet laugh sneaks out as she thinks how strange it is to prefer normalcy over the magic she had tripped and fallen into.

After a moment of hesitation, Summer tosses the coin onto her bed and closes the box, then slides it back into her closet. She rises to her feet and searches for some more comfortable clothing. Summer has no intention of letting the remaining days slip by unproductively, and she made a promise to help her friend. With any luck, she would be able to locate the remaining items required by the Collective and put this all behind her. Her nose crinkles with a grimace, but she puts the thought of unexpected amendments or contract renewals out of her mind.

The deep blue blazer and skirt get haphazardly tossed into a nearby clothes hamper, and Summer notes how full the plastic basket is getting when the emerald blouse lands on top of the growing pile. She makes a mental note to do laundry sooner rather than later while peeling one knee-high sock down her leg. A more jovial part of her bubbles to the surface as she playfully tosses one sock, then another into the basket.

She turns to her bed and looks at the chosen attire, hoping it will suit her needs for what lies ahead. The dark blue of her pants lightens as she pulls them up, and she turns herself in front of the mirror to check for any unexpected holes in the stretchy material. Her top grips her chest firmly, holding everything in place with the Temutatio sliding across the smooth fabric as she prepares to put on a gray hoodie. With anklet socks wrapped snug around her feet within a pair of worn sneakers, she feels confident and ready to go.

Summer trots out of her room with renewed vigor. A more enthusiastic breath inflates her lungs before rushing out again, and she smiles brightly at Gavin. The leprechaun had continued to pace in her absence, and Summer was momentarily surprised to see another little cup of coffee in his hand.

The leprechaun glances up from the cup tipped to his mouth, and Summer sees his eyes flick down to her shoes. He nearly spits out his drink while looking at his much more casually dressed roommate, and Summer chuckles as the leprechaun’s cheeks take a redder shade. His eyes widen when Summer holds his coin up. 

“It might be best for you to hold onto this for now,” Summer says with a smirk.

“Still strugglin’ to accept everythin’, huh?” he asks with a smirk. 

Summer nods, but slips the stone into the pocket in her hoodie nonetheless. They walk quietly to the elevator, with neither able to bring themselves to break the silence. The doors slide open, and Summer glances back down the hall at her closed door one last time before following Gavin into the elevator.

“My portal is on the other side of the country,” Gavin explains. “I haven’t really bothered tryin’ to find one here, who even *knows* where it would lead.”

There are few close calls as the two make their way across the street, and before long they walk into the parking lot of a small strip mall. Several specialty stores surround the parking area, along with a couple chain outlets featuring shoes, sports gear, games and collectables, spices, and toys. Wedged into the corner, squeezed between a clothing outfitter advertising summer clearance prices and a spirits outlet, is what looks like an over-the-top witch store, “*Glamors Galore*.”

Summer and Gavin stand on the sidewalk outside the store, peering in through the windows at the assorted goods on display. Crystals and carved stone figurines are neatly arranged on three-level-shelves along the windows, and robes of varying lengths and colors line one wall all the way to the back of the store. In the middle of the store are several shelves with tarot cards, ouija boards, incense and burners, several bundles of herbs, and dozens of baggies and little boxes. Closer to the counter is another row of shelves, this one heavy with books packed so tight that only their spines are on display.

“This place?” Summer asks with disbelief.

Gavin shrugs, then pulls the door open and ushers her through. An overwhelming combination of potent fragrances assaults their senses as they enter the store, and Summer stifles a cough while her mind struggles to identify the cacophony. Her eyes begin to water, and she’s relieved to find herself gradually acclimating to the sudden change.

“Sure, it’s a bit… overly commercialized,” Gavin admits. He scans the shelves and displays, but it’s obvious he’s not looking for anything advertised. “Ya just gotta keep an open mind when lookin’ for this kinda stuff.”

“Your boyfriend is wise beyond his years…”

Summer nearly drops the seeing stone as she pulls it from the pocket in her hoodie when the store’s attendant suddenly speaks. She hadn’t even noticed the older woman before, but her eyes are fixated on the woman dressed in an excessive amount of new-age paraphernalia. From the wide-lens spectacles to the dreamcatcher earrings, to the scarlet robes with symbols woven into the fabric with golden strings and crystals, she was effectively a walking billboard for her store. There were even polished beads shimmering in her lengthy silvered hair.

Gavin reaches a hand towards the older woman and gently caresses her shoulder. His fingers rub down to her elbow as a nearly imperceptible golden flash flickers in his eyes.

“Unicorn?” he asks, “Two horns, though? In amethyst, I believe I saw one on those shelves at the front?”

Without another word, the shopkeeper nods and starts walking to the front of her store. Gavin turns on a heel and beckons Summer to follow as he hurries to the open door in the back. Summer’s heart beats rapidly as they rush into the back room, and she fights through the strict morality and lawfulness she had followed all her life.

1h8ac2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ShaunDoed/comments/1h8ac2z/summer_tyme_with_the_collectors_chapter_14/,Summer Tyme with the Collectors: Chapter 14,"**Sandman**: *Of all the entities of faerealm, few are as fickle as the Sandman. This creature is often associated with sleep and dreams, but can just as easily cause nightmares or insomnia. Crossing the Sandman is never recommended, as he is capable - and all too willing - to force his victims into insanity with restless, fitful sleep.*

*The Sandman is the only creature known to have the ability to bring people into and out of the Worlds Between. While most fairies can utilize the Worlds Between for communicating with those in the human world, none of them are capable of fully entering the wakeless world on their own. It has been speculated that some of those ushered into the Worlds Between by the Sandman are abandoned there. Some posit this as the way some people fall into a coma, while others speculate there would simply be no physical remnant of these victims at all.*

*Fortunately, this fairy is generally a benevolent force. He meticulously measures out just enough of his enchanted dust to help each individual fall asleep, and has been seen wistfully watching over those under his influence. It is understood that this entity rarely wishes harm upon others, rather, he may withhold sleep from those with a guilty conscience.* 

Summer gets to her room and finally kicks off her heels. The hardwood flooring in her room provides a comforting chill to her soles, nibbling up through her thin socks as her feet press down. A relaxing sigh spills from her chest as she takes a moment to unwind from the madness consuming her life, and she closes her eyes to find greater grounding. 

“*Friday…*,” she says with an exhale.

It had hardly dawned on her before, but the weekend had now snuck up on her. The week had been such a blur since tripping headfirst into the hidden world, and she pauses a little longer to find more stability. Her back presses against her closed door, and she tips her head to the solid barrier behind her while taking another deep breath. There was a rising desire to call her father for help, but she knew it wouldn’t do any good. Not that he *wouldn’t* help, but how could she ever expect him - or anyone to believe *any* of this? In the time it would take to convince someone who has always been there for her, she could maybe, *just* maybe, be done with the list on her own.

The coin is unusually heavy in her hand. She opens her eyes and lets them trace the design minted into Gavin’s coin. Rather than place the coin under her pillow right away, Summer decides to store it in her *Keepsakes* box. She kneels onto the floor and pulls the box closer to her, then opens it with a sentimental smile. The ‘fairy’ notes her father wrote when she was a little girl are a welcome sight, and she finds herself wishing it could all be so simple. A soft, quiet laugh sneaks out as she thinks how strange it is to prefer normalcy over the magic she had tripped and fallen into.

After a moment of hesitation, Summer tosses the coin onto her bed and closes the box, then slides it back into her closet. She rises to her feet and searches for some more comfortable clothing. Summer has no intention of letting the remaining days slip by unproductively, and she made a promise to help her friend. With any luck, she would be able to locate the remaining items required by the Collective and put this all behind her. Her nose crinkles with a grimace, but she puts the thought of unexpected amendments or contract renewals out of her mind.

The deep blue blazer and skirt get haphazardly tossed into a nearby clothes hamper, and Summer notes how full the plastic basket is getting when the emerald blouse lands on top of the growing pile. She makes a mental note to do laundry sooner rather than later while peeling one knee-high sock down her leg. A more jovial part of her bubbles to the surface as she playfully tosses one sock, then another into the basket.

She turns to her bed and looks at the chosen attire, hoping it will suit her needs for what lies ahead. The dark blue of her pants lightens as she pulls them up, and she turns herself in front of the mirror to check for any unexpected holes in the stretchy material. Her top grips her chest firmly, holding everything in place with the Temutatio sliding across the smooth fabric as she prepares to put on a gray hoodie. With anklet socks wrapped snug around her feet within a pair of worn sneakers, she feels confident and ready to go.

Summer trots out of her room with renewed vigor. A more enthusiastic breath inflates her lungs before rushing out again, and she smiles brightly at Gavin. The leprechaun had continued to pace in her absence, and Summer was momentarily surprised to see another little cup of coffee in his hand.

The leprechaun glances up from the cup tipped to his mouth, and Summer sees his eyes flick down to her shoes. He nearly spits out his drink while looking at his much more casually dressed roommate, and Summer chuckles as the leprechaun’s cheeks take a redder shade. His eyes widen when Summer holds his coin up. 

“It might be best for you to hold onto this for now,” Summer says with a smirk.

She tosses the golden coin to Gavin, who effortlessly snatches it from the air. The relief striking his face threatens to shatter her heart, and she scolds herself internally at even *thinking* to rob him of something so valuable.

“We only have two more days,” she explains. “I don’t have any intention of leaving you without a single coin. Let’s go find the rest.”

Gavin visibly relaxes at the admission, and a softness returns to his eyes. He sends the little cup away with a flick of his wrist, and it vanishes before having the chance to clatter to the ground.

“Are ya sure? It won’t be the easiest-”

“Right now,” Summer cuts in, “I have a solid burst of energy. You know where more of your coins are, let’s go get them.”

An excited giggle shivers out of Gavin, and he nods with uncontainable glee. The knowledge of where his gold is still nags in the back of his mind, but he can already feel the dreaded unpleasantness creeping in. If he were to tell Summer where they’re heading now, would she really want to help?

“Wonderful!” he exclaims. The leprechaun tugs at the open edges of his long coat as he heads toward the door. “Oh- bring your seein’ stone!”

Summer had started to follow him when he made the suggestion. She turns and looks at the table, then glances back at Gavin.

“Uh- sure,” she agrees. “Ok…”

“We gotta find a way into the faerealm,” Gavin explains. “That’ll help ya find a gateway.”

The flat stone scrapes across the surface of the table as Summer collects it. She turns to Gavin, fighting to keep the disbelief from her face while walking back over to him at the door.

“Still strugglin’ to accept everythin’, huh?” he asks with a smirk. 

Summer nods, but slips the stone into the pocket in her hoodie nonetheless. They walk quietly to the elevator, with neither able to bring themselves to break the silence. The doors slide open, and Summer glances back down the hall at her closed door one last time before following Gavin into the elevator.

“My portal is on the other side of the country,” Gavin explains. “I haven’t really bothered tryin’ to find one here, who even *knows* where it would lead.”

“I guess I thought they would take you where you want to go?” Summer admits with a furrowed brow. “They all go to the fairy world, though?”

“The faerealm, yeah,” he replies, nodding his head as they ride down. “But, it’s not as easy as steppin’ into one and *presto*. Well, it *is*, but…”

The elevator rattles to a halt at the ground floor, and they both look at the shut doors. A second passes, then another, and Summer is reminded of why she hates the elevator. There have been too many times when the stubborn doors take horrifyingly long to open, and she was always certain that *this* would be the time they simply remained closed. Both occupants let out a relieved sigh when the doors slid open following a muffled *ding*, and their eyes met before they chuckled together.

“Easier than an *elevator*, anyway,” Gavin adds with a smirk. “They’re kinda… geologically locked? I guess?”

“You guess?” Summer replies quickly, glancing over at him while walking to the apartment complex’s door.

Gavin shrugs before continuing. “Hey, I ain’t ever done a study or nothin’, but every portal I been through always seems to lead to the same spot on the other side. My portal takes me into my bedroom closet back home, and others have established similar connections. Takes some doin’, though.”

“‘*Takes some doin*’,” Summer repeats, considering what the leprechaun was telling her. “So, in other words, I can’t just wish for another one to open up and lead us right to your gold.”

It wasn’t a question, but Gavin nodded his answer anyway. He sighs as they reach the sidewalk beside the street, and a gust of wind races after a passing car.

“Not that simple, I’m afraid.” He strokes his beard in one hand and laughs, “If I had all my gold? Maybe. But I ain’t got enough access to the magic for it just now.”

Summer takes the smooth, flat stone from the pocket of her hoodie and holds it in the open palm of her hand. She rubs a finger along the curve of the stone’s hole, and looks at the storefronts across the street. The convenience store she walked out of (without even being inside) sits next to a realtor. On the other side is a vintage game shop, and on the other side of that is a bakery. The scent of fresh baked bread hangs in the air as she holds the stone to her eye.

“So, am I supposed to just…” she says with a hint of frustration in her voice. Her free hand gestures around, “...tape this to my glasses and look *everywhere*?”

“Ya *could*,” Gavin responds, and Summer can hear the smirk in his tone. “Would be hilarious.”

An annoyed sigh rushes from Summer as she rolls her eyes. There’s clearly plenty more the leprechaun hasn’t said, and the young woman is getting frustrated with all these people withholding important information. The lack of much needed information is how she got into this mess in the first place, after all.

“I *live* to entertain,” she says sarcastically.

Gavin takes note of her obvious annoyance and glances down the street. While his coastal location is still fairly unknown, he has a pretty good idea of where to start.

“There’s a shop for wannabe witches not far from here,” he supplies. “Herbs, crystals, things people *think* have magic properties. Those kinda places will usually have some kind of portal nearby.”

Summer stashes her stone back into the pocket of her hoodie and retrieves her phone. The shop sounds familiar, though she’s certainly never been there. She unlocks the device’s screen and accesses her maps app, then watches as the phone’s GPS finds her position. 

The map on her phone zooms in on their location enough for the names of individual locations to begin showing up. Without really *knowing* what she’s looking for, Summer drags her finger across the screen in search of anything ‘witchy.’ She rolls her eyes and smirks at her foolishness, then taps the search icon at the top of the screen.

“Whacha lookin’ for?” Gavin asks while Summer types in her request.

“Witchy store,” she replies with a grin.

“I gotta get me one of those,” he says quietly, watching as the image on the upside-down map zooms out with five different locations pinned.

“They *are* pretty helpful,” she agrees, then sets about finding the store closest to where they’re standing. “Looks like the nearest one is about a mile… that way.”

Summer looks up from her phone and gestures with it across the street. Another car streaks by, dragging a gust of wind behind it that makes her stagger to the side. 

“Maybe we can use one of those new cross-walks I’ve heard so much about?” Gavin says, sarcasm heavy in his voice.

“I wasn’t going to just *jump* out into traffic!” Summer retorts, but she can feel redness burning in her cheeks as she follows the leprechaun to the nearby intersection.

There are few close calls as the two make their way across the street, and before long they walk into the parking lot of a small strip mall. Several specialty stores surround the parking area, along with a couple chain outlets featuring shoes, sports gear, games and collectables, spices, and toys. Wedged into the corner, squeezed between a clothing outfitter advertising summer clearance prices and a spirits outlet, is what looks like an over-the-top witch store, “*Glamors Galore*.”

Summer and Gavin stand on the sidewalk outside the store, peering in through the windows at the assorted goods on display. Crystals and carved stone figurines are neatly arranged on three-level-shelves along the windows, and robes of varying lengths and colors line one wall all the way to the back of the store. In the middle of the store are several shelves with tarot cards, ouija boards, incense and burners, several bundles of herbs, and dozens of baggies and little boxes. Closer to the counter is another row of shelves, this one heavy with books packed so tight that only their spines are on display.

“This place?” Summer asks with disbelief.

Gavin shrugs, then pulls the door open and ushers her through. An overwhelming combination of potent fragrances assaults their senses as they enter the store, and Summer stifles a cough while her mind struggles to identify the cacophony. Her eyes begin to water, and she’s relieved to find herself gradually acclimating to the sudden change.

“Sure, it’s a bit… overly commercialized,” Gavin admits. He scans the shelves and displays, but it’s obvious he’s not looking for anything advertised. “Ya just gotta keep an open mind when lookin’ for this kinda stuff.”

“Your boyfriend is wise beyond his years…”

Summer nearly drops the seeing stone as she pulls it from the pocket in her hoodie when the store’s attendant suddenly speaks. She hadn’t even noticed the older woman before, but her eyes are fixated on the woman dressed in an excessive amount of new-age paraphernalia. From the wide-lens spectacles to the dreamcatcher earrings, to the scarlet robes with symbols woven into the fabric with golden strings and crystals, she was effectively a walking billboard for her store. There were even polished beads shimmering in her lengthy silvered hair.

“Oh, he’s not my-” the young woman begins, trying to be friendly while fumbling with the flat stone in her pocket.

“Husband, then,” the storekeeper finishes with a knowing smirk. “It *is* best to keep an open mind when coming across something unfamiliar.”

“uhhh-Yeah,” Gavin says with a quiet chuckle. “Over here, wifey.”

The shopkeeper puts on her friendliest smile, and Summer decides to ignore all of its implications while turning away and moving over to her *not* boyfriend. Gavin grins at her, and is clearly trying not to laugh as the shopkeeper makes her way back to the counter. 

“What do ya see back there, *hon*?” he asks, pointing to a door in the back of the shop.

She looks at the slightly ajar door and sighs. It’s just a regular door, in a regular shop, separating customers from a regular storage area. At least, that’s what anyone *else* might think. If Summer hadn’t been introduced to the undeniable world of magic, she wouldn’t think anything of the partially open door. Instead, she holds the seeing stone up to her eye to see what Gavin might be pointing out, and a shiver of excitement dances down her spine.

While the door was just a basic, average, everyday sort, the light spilling through the opening most certainly was not. Summer moves the stone from her eye as if to do a double-take, and draws a sharp breath while looking through the hole worn in the stone’s surface. With her naked eye, the door seems to lead into the shadows of a room with the lights off. Through the stone, she sees a shimmering violet haze illuminating the open door with confusing brightness. *How-* how is it that something as basic as *light* can’t be seen without-

“Do ya see it?” Gavin prods.

He takes a step forward, then looks back at the stunned woman. Summer closes her mouth after realizing it was hanging open, and follows her leprechaun *friend*. For some annoying reason, she feels compelled to tell herself that he’s just a friend, and she rolls her eyes internally at how such a simple assumption had rubbed her the wrong way. She tries to push it from her mind, a task that is all too easy while approaching the door. 

“Is there something I can help you find?” the shopkeeper asks.

Summer spins around to see the older woman right behind her. She’s so startled that the stone nearly falls from her hand, but she manages to maintain her grip on the flat rock.

“Yeah, actually,” Gavin replies. He stands beside and slightly behind Summer, and places his hand on her far hip before continuing. “We’re lookin’ for somethin’... *special*.”

His fingers press into Summer’s hip as he wordlessly guides her back from the shopkeeper. Summer resists at first, but quickly catches on to her leprechaun’s game and steps to the side. She pretends to examine the colorful books on the shelf in front of her, running her finger down the spine of a blue book without actually reading it. Her attention was on the door just a few steps away, and the conversation Gavin was having with the shopkeeper.

“Crystals, maybe?” he continues. “What can ya tell me about the figurines on that shelf?”

“The- are you looking for any figure in particular?” the shopkeeper asks, a confused hesitance in her voice.

Gavin reaches a hand towards the older woman and gently caresses her shoulder. His fingers rub down to her elbow as a nearly imperceptible golden flash flickers in his eyes.

“Unicorn?” he asks, “Two horns, though? In amethyst, I believe I saw one on those shelves at the front?”

Without another word, the shopkeeper nods and starts walking to the front of her store. Gavin turns on a heel and beckons Summer to follow as he hurries to the open door in the back. Summer’s heart beats rapidly as they rush into the back room, and she fights through the strict morality and lawfulness she had followed all her life. It wasn’t like they were trying to *steal* anything, just-

Before the thought can fully form in her head to assure her that sneaking somewhere she didn’t belong was fine so long as they didn’t take anything, her surroundings shatter. Violet light burns through the fissures of her reality, and the fractured pieces of the storage area fall into the blinding light.

Hello all, 

I am recently divorced. Decently attractive man. I work a lot. I’m an introverted extrovert. I have a beard and tattoos. I’m rough on the edges. I swear a lot. Looking to connect with somebody who’s serious about getting to know one another who values trust honesty, and communication and is super kind to others. I am attracted to all races, creeds, religions and nationalities. I do prefer woman who have curves. I’m also an ass man so bonus points if you’re a cutie with a bootie. I know I know, super cheesy. But that’s me. I have a fairly stable life. I drive, have my own place, have my shit together. I don’t smoke, drink or do drugs but I’m not against people who do. If your weekends are all about going out, drinking and shit like that, it probably ain’t going to work. 
A bit more about me below ⬇️ 

* 41, Caucasian, 6’1
* Super chill & friendly 
* Best smelling guy you’ll meet. Period. 
* I’m a Dad of 2 beautiful kids. 
* I’m a big nerd, love space and comics, sci fi and horror. Games. 
* Lover of Coffee
* Nature walks & Hikes are my jam. I love to throw on my AirPods, find a trail and just go. 

Can send a SFW pic if you are willing too also! Hoping to connect with you!  I don’t want a penpal and I don’t want to waste anyone’s time.  

I am looking for WOMEN ONLY. 
Please be free and unattached from your exs. Please don’t live with your ex still, and don’t be “on and off” with your ex 😡  

Thanks for reading my novel ✌️",1,1733515293.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False
1h8aa35,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1h8aa35/am_i_overthinking/,Am I overthinking? ,"Hello . 
I have a question. I’m a F36 and I’m dating a guy 28M almost a month . 

Since day when the guy was super excited and yet we haven’t have sex because I wanted to wait first to get him know him better . 

The thing is before I date seriously someone I take in consideration a few stuff . 
The guy on day 3 he asked me to be his girlfriend which is not that bad , but he doesn’t know me yet . 

Then he mentioned his mom several times in things that he didn’t need to . For example , my mom doesn’t like tattoos , my mom didn’t like my ex , etc … 
All those things made me think about a lot of stuff . 
Then he admitted that his first dates always go for coffee because it’s cheap and if he wants to get out it’s easy if he doesn’t like the date . 
Seriously , men should put a little bit effort even if it’s the first date .
We’ve seen each other only 5 times . 2 of them was each others houses . 
My first date was on a caffe , second date was in an Applebees but I chose this one , third date he took me to a park and we saw each other on a cinema which was one of the cheapest and outdated in this state . 
Also he didn’t buy a drink , he said he will drink from mine . 

I don’t look for someone to pay me the bills or anything.  I’m an independent woman who has a very good job but I want something equal to me . Someone who cares to put some effort . 

In his house he order pizza and didn’t get any salad or soda , 
I dunno those are small details that makes someone unattractive to my eyes . 
I’m in my late 30s , I’m looking for someone to treat me as a woman not as a teenager. 

Am I overreacting? What should I do ?
I like him but not so much , to put so much effort into. 

Because I don’t see potential in him . 
Also he’s texts are dry , monotonous 
He always says he misses me and he likes me but nothing else , the texts has only romantic rhythm and I cannot keep a convo with him .

1h8a8a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1h8a8a0/wrong_way_serve_me_anyway/,Wrong Way? Serve me anyway!!!,"I once managed a very popular coffeeshop back in the day. It was located in a medium sized coastal town and was a regular stop for our local police force. I happened to be working the day when a couple in a big SUV drove the wrong way into the drive-thru. About the same time a couple of other cars were in the drive thru (the right way), finished ordering and drove forward only to see the misplace SUV blocking them. 

Did the car entering the wrong way realize their mistake and back up? Of course not! I was quickly called over by my very flustered casher just as the passenger side window came down and the wife started barking out an order!!! I saw the situation and explained to them that not only were they facing the wrong way but they had also cut in line. Their response? ""Well, we are here now so just take our order and we will back out when we get our drinks""!!!

No...I don't play that way. I refused, told them they needed to back out and get in line or come in. Of course they got angry and indignant, said they weren't moving without their drinks and repeated their demands. I said, ""ok give me a sec"" as I walked over to the table of four police officers who were enjoying their coffee but already noticing their was an issue at the window.  Well....needless to say the situation was quickly resolved. One officer told me it was the easiest ticket he ever wrote and the driver had an expired license as well. The cops returned to newly fresh coffee when they were done with the SUV, who left without their drinks and much poorer in tickets.

Occasionally my job was very satisfying and that was certainly one of those days.",20,1733515141.0,EntitledPeople,1,1.0,False
1h8a88x,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h8a88x/have_you_ever_had_to_break_up_with_someone_you/,Have you ever had to break up with someone you still love? (32F) (M29) *Long post,"I have been hurting. Am still hurting. I feel at times like I’m drowning in memories, laughter, peace, late night talks, excitement… and as soon as I regain consciousness I gasp for air and I’m back in reality without him in it. He became such a large part of my every day, so the gap of his presence was a huge change in my day-to-day.

We didn’t end on bad terms, which for me, makes it a lot harder to process. The main reason being that it was circumstantial (very long distance), and at the end of the day was not sustainable in the long term. It would be extremely difficult for either of us to make such a life changing sacrifice to move, as well as it not being certain it would happen since it would be atleast a year or so out before either of us could consider it. It was painful for both of us for this to end, but we both felt similarly once the initial wave of change washed over us. The conversations were not easy by any means, but we knew it was what was best. We chatted about other reasons why this decision made the most sense, despite still loving eachother deeply. Reminisced on our favorite memories. Laughed, cried, sobbed, laughed again. ""When you love someone, let them go."" In this situation, we both knew letting go was the most gut wrenching, but realistic option. 

Recently I was watching a show called “Somebody Somewhere” (if you haven’t watched this show PLEASE DO!), *SPOILER* at the end of the latest episode, the main character Sam was talking to her best friend. He was upset because he was sacrifycing a dream of his in order to be with his partner. Everything felt perfect but this one thing was driving him into a deep sadness and depression. Sam said “What’s wrong with wanting a little bit more?”

We tend to sacrifice some of our core values in a partner because their other qualities seem so perfect for us. An example: You want kids and to get married, they don’t want either. But you’re willing to sacrifice those aspirations because they seem perfect for you in every other way. But let’s remember what Sam said… “What’s wrong with wanting a little bit more?” We tend to feel guilt because we're ""asking for too much"" or ""we'll never find someone with all the qualities we ever want"". It might be true that no one is perfect, but there will be a perfect person for you. Look at yourself in the mirror, do you really think it's impossible to find someone who wants the same as you? Out of all the people in this world?

On my way back home from my trip to see him, I reflected on our relationship as a whole. Especially in terms of myself. What was I sacrificing that were non-negotiable? Or, how was I sacrificing myself in order to make our relationship work? (I was not the only one making sacrifices of course, he was as well. Ones that I knew he also was reluctent to make because we wanted to make it work.) I realized that there was a lot that I cast aside and was only allowing myself to be fulfilled by him. His mood, his time, his interests. I had lost touch with a lot of my interests. I didn't realize this was the case until I was starting to feel alone and depressed, despite being in the most fullfilling relationship I've ever had even at our distance. I knew it was time to take my life back by the reigns and choose to love myself, love my hobbies again, and not use my relationships as an emotional crutch. I knew in order for me to have a deeper connection with someone, I needed to have that within myself first.

Breakups always happen for a reason, even if it’s a choice we make ourselves. Not everything that happens for a reason has to be something that is out of our control. Intuitively and logically, I knew that eventually our relationship would’ve ended in resentment on both sides had it not ended when it did. 

In all honesty - I had a mental breakdown last night... A not so good one. A lot of it targeted through jealousy, sadness, and grief. I realize now after coming down from all the emotions that I am in fact worthy of a quiet mind, peaceful solidarity and autonomy over my feelings; giving the made up stories in my brain the power to rule over my present. Allowing the loss of someone to completely dictate what I'm doing, how I'm acting, how I'm feeling made me realize that I invested too much of myself even when I didn't think I did. Bed rotting, crying, isolating and endlessly scrolling on social media will never get me to the place I aspire to be. You can love someone while also loving yourself. You don't need to make the relationship the epicenter of your life in order for it to work. 

I sometimes find myself questioning if I made the right decision - especially on nights like these where it feels like my heart has been ripped out of me. I just want to stuff him back into the space in which has been left by his absence. But then I think of another quote - this time by Cheryl Strayed “Be brave enough to break your own heart.” 

That means, even if the decision sucks right now, you will eventually prosper. “Bad” feelings are part of life, just as the “good” feelings are. We need them to appreciate the good. Go for the walk. Read the book you've been eyeing. Go to a store or coffee shop you've been wanting to go into. Smile at others. Small steps. Imagine how good it'll feel once you reap the benefits of a decision that hurt like hell in the moment. To know you filled your own cup. You listened to yourself and prospered. 

It’s hard to say thank you right now, but I know one day I will indeed thank myself. I deserve “a little more” and so do you. If you are going through something similar, please know you are not alone and there are SO many people experiencing heartbreak at this very moment. Please feel free to share your experience in the comments wether this is something you're currently going through (and how you're dealing with it) or if you've been through it, how do you feel now?

I stay at their house sometimes and have been making espresso with this machine, and I want to improve their espresso experience. I have noticed a few problems that I would love some advice addressing.

**Issues I want to address:** the puck is watery after pulling a shot, shots take too long to pull, the shot isn’t double my ground espresso weight, and if I leave the puck in the basket in the machine it drips coffee for at least 30 minutes. 

**Here is what I am working with and what I observed this morning:**

Shot prep: shake to get clumps out best I can, level, and manual tamp

Shot type: double

Coffee: Illy Intenso Bold Roast Espresso Preparation Ground Coffee (maybe the solution to all of this is just getting them a burr grinder)

Portafilter and basket: Neouza 51mm bottomless portafilter with a non-pressurized basket

Dose: 15g

Brew time: 32 seconds

Yield: 25g of espresso

\*I have also noticed that the second shot I pull will take longer and yield less than the first shot if I do them back to back\*

**Machine maintenance:**

* I descaled it a few weeks ago with a good descaler, but it hadn’t been descaled for a while before that
* That’s about it besides running some water through the screen before pulling a shot

I would really appreciate any advice you have to move my time and yield in the right direction. Getting a clean and dry puck would also be great! Thank you in advance!

I decided to give Psyllium a try, ever so low an amount and cautiously.  Things are finally moving digestively. The constipation for me is the main trigger.   Food intolerances come in second: Milk and coffee are the other two.  Be the flare up be from a back up digestively, or that of my foolishly overindulging with dairy, what follows next is a cycle which ends up with constipation.  That constipation can trigger yet another flareup and there was no way around it until Psyllium powder.

It's important to note that the Psyllium I use is not the type that has additives.  I use the capsules which do not have added Maltodextrin (MDX) or artificial sweeteners.  MDX contributes to suppression of intestinal anti-microbial defense mechanisms and may be an environmental priming factor for the development of chronic inflammatory disease. ( [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4084946/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4084946/) )

I am having good results using Psyllium.  I am not going to even touch Mesalamine. Mesalamine can cause a serious reaction called **mesalamine-induced acute intolerance syndrome**. The symptoms can be confusing because they look like ulcerative colitis. Tell your doctor if you're taking mesalamine and you have: Stomach pain or cramps.

Before trying the Psyllium, my digestive tract was not moving along food, despite my being physically active, eating healthy and being ideal weight.

Studies state that Psyllium powder might be as effective as mesalamine to maintain remission in ulcerative colitis. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10022641/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10022641/)

Those suffering from a host of IBS etc symptoms,  wouldn't even be able to distinguish the side effects of mesalamine.  

Yet, many here are saying that before going on Psyllium which is over the counter item,  should not be taken for more than 7 days.  That really isn't so...  It's more of a legal disclaimer. They simply want to have people check in with their Dr before doing anything longterm.  The side effects of Mesalamine are much more pronounced.

1h8a6c8,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1h8a6c8/have_any_of_you_gone_down_from_50_to_40mg/,Have any of you gone down from 50 to 40mg? ,"Hey everyone, I've been taking Vyvanse 50mg for a month now. This post will be a bit longer, so I'll summarize everything here and for those who are interested, my side effects are listed below: I've had relatively good experiences with the doses so far, it's helping me quite well with university and everyday life. However, I do have a few mild side effects that depend on different factors. **I have already thought about making a telephone appointment with my doctor to talk about the problems** and whether it might be worth trying the 40mg. I started with 30mg of Vyvanse, but it didn't do anything even two weeks later - I needed two coffees so that I could work a bit efficiently, but I didn't have any side effects either way. Before anyone asks: I now avoid caffeine most days - but even if I drink a coffee or two on a Vyvanse day, it has no negative effect on me. When we increased the dose, we weren't sure whether 40mg was already available in Germany, so we continued with 50mg. However, I have heard from time to time from people in Germany that they are taking 40mg. I would therefore like to hear the experiences of people who have previously taken 50mg but then decided to go down to 40mg =) My side effects are not very bad in my opinion, but could still be signs of an overdose? And generally, the goal is to find the lowest possible effective dose.

I've heard it often enough and can only confirm it: enough sleep, regular meals, drinks and exercise are definitely important. Most of my complaints are caused by irregular meals. If everything is on point, I have good experiences. Nevertheless, these 3 side effects remain:

*My side effects*

1. Dry mouth since day one. At this time of year, I definitely have to drink around 2.5 liters a day + chew 3-4 pieces of gum. I tend to drink 1.5 liters in the first 4 hours and then less throughout the day until I get thirsty again in the evening. This is of course a problem when I go to sleep because the toilet becomes my second home. What I have noticed, however, is **that I have to drink more regularly - so no longer breaks during the afternoon**. On days without medication, I definitely drink less and just as irregularly - so I think my body is telling me in the evening: girl please drink at appropriate intervals! Three days ago I also tried another 30mg as I still had enough from the first attempt. Once again, I realized that it wasn't really helping me with my focus, I was constantly distracted. I also drank a liter less compared to days when I take 50mg - so everything was more or less the same as on days without medication; this became problematic again at night when my mouth constantly felt like the Sahara. Nevertheless, this side effect is the most annoying one and I can't just chew gum for the rest of my life, right???
2. My heart rate is a little high. I bought a fitness watch a month ago and it often measures in the 90-100 BPM range during simple activities. Over the weeks, the average normal heart rate is between 76 and 80 BPM. **However, I have to say that I generally have an elevated heart rate**. I had a long-term ECG in July and it measured a range of 64 - 144 BPM throughout the day, including a “slightly increased average heart rate of 87 BPM”. I didn't do any exercise that day either, apart from walking the 20-minute route home from the doctor. And yes, I have to see the doctor again soon, I will make an appointment on Monday. But nothing else negative was noticed, which is why I was allowed to start the medication. My mother has a blood pressure monitor and the pulse values are very close to those of my watch. Incidentally, my blood pressure is quite low, but in combination with my pulse while on Vyvanse, I'm in the optimum range.
3. I am way more talkative. Especially in the first few hours, I can't be on social media or WhatsApp, because otherwise I just can't keep my mouth shut. It's not noticeable at university because I don't really talk. But in real conversations, I babble on quite a lot, but after the peak I'm exhausted and, depending on the situation, I'm no longer in the mood and quickly become irritable from all kinds of noises. **I have to say that I was already diagnosed with autism before ADHD and on days without medication I feel the symptoms much more than on days without**. I think the medication compensates for my autism a little and the symptoms feel more intense to me when the effect wears off. Since I've been taking the medication, my father asks me on unmedicated days if I'm tired or something because I don't talk that much.

*What I have changed in my life since starting 50mg and what influences the effectiveness*

1. I now always eat something rich in protein for breakfast, even on days without medication, and that also gives me energy, which is definitely very important either way. I also do 20 minutes of cardio once a day - either in the morning before Vyvanse or 8-9 hours after I take it.
2. More precise routines, no Vyvanse later than 9:30am, getting ready for bed around 9:30pm. I still struggle with falling sleep on time, but if I have at least 7-8 hours of sleep, it definitely works for around 8 hours before I finally get tired, but I still have the capacity to deal with uni work. On unmedicated days, when I have less than 7 hours of sleep, my heart rate seems to be just as high as on medicated days or even higher.
3. Regular meals: yeah, lack of appetite is real on adhd meds, so technically another side effect. Though I already experienced this even before starting meds. On days when I eat regularly, I definitely don't feel the crash. But if I don't eat anything for 8 hours after breakfast or only eat snacks, then I feel absolutely tired after 6-8 hours, have warmer ears for a while, but physically can't fall asleep - so since the 50mg I say bye bye to naps.
4. I take 400mg of magnesium in the evening before going to bed.

Lastly, I'm 20F and often hear that the cycle plays a role - I have to say: I can still manage well towards the end/beginning of the cycle with medication - though I do get distracted way more. But without meds -> definitely not getting anything done for a week.",1,1733514995.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

1h8a5s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseweight/comments/1h8a5s6/my_weightloss_journey/,My Weightloss Journey ,"I know the holidays haven’t started yet but I wanted to share my personal weightloss experience to help those who may be struggling. I started back in 2022.  I’d decided I wanted to lose weight and hopefully be healthier. I had issues with my knees and back, and I was hoping it would reduce my pain if I was carrying less weight.

When I started tracking my food/drinks, I discovered how many calories I was DRINKING every day. It was a major eye opener. My kryptonite was too much coffee with sugary creamer, regular sodas, and alcohol. 

My approach was to slowly make better choices by replacing certain foods.  Some of the changes were really easy for me. For example, I found some great low carb wraps (or iceberg lettuce) that I used instead of bread for sandwiches. If I wanted sour cream I used 0% greek yogurt. 

The  beverages were harder for me.  I don’t like the after taste of some of the zero sugar coffee creamers. So I SLOWLY weaned myself off. Every week I reduced the amount of creamer in my coffee and replaced it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk and a tsp of honey.  When the creamer was gone, I started reducing the amount of honey and now I drink coffee with ⅛ cup of the unsweetened vanilla almond milk. 

Just like the coffee creamer, I very much dislike the aftertaste of diet soda.  So I decided to replace sodas with Arnold Palmers (½ regular lemonade with ½ iced tea). Over time I reduced the amount of lemonade until I was just drinking straight iced tea.  As for alcohol I looked for beer alternatives or low calorie options.  My favorites are Hop Wtr (double hopped and lemonade) which have no calories and the High Noon Vodka Seltzer (lemon and mango).

I feel like the slow approach I’ve taken has helped stay consistent.  I’ve still got about 10 pounds to go until I reach my weight loss goal. Will I still occasionally drink a beer once I reach my goal? Yep. But now I have a healthier alternative that works just as well!

We recently went through the drive-through specifically to try the caramel frosty.  My mom is not a fan of caramel so she decided to get a vanilla, but they told us that they only have the caramel Frosty’s in stock until after the holidays. That is Wendy’s first mistake. When we were in the drive-through, she showed us this weird brown liquid at the bottom of the cup and said that it was gonna take 5 to 10 minutes more for it to thicken up and we had to pull into a parking spot to wait. I was super excited for this, so I didn’t mind though it kind of weirded me out seeing this gross liquid, knowing that was what I was getting ready to eat.  We live about two minutes from Wendy’s so when we got home, I grabbed the spoon and shoveled a spoonful into my mouth.  I immediately regretted even going to Wendy’s to try this. This isn’t caramel. I don’t care what they call it and I don’t care what anybody says it’s not caramel. It tastes like butterscotch flavored coffee.  It literally tastes like they took salt and put it into the frosty.

1h8a2ry,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h8a2ry/my_masters_project_turned_out_to_be_cursed/,My masters project turned out to be cursed,"I'm an archaeology masters student studying in the UK, which yes, I see the irony behind. I've heard every grave robber joke there is, I get it. I've always had a personal interest in Irish archaeology specifically, in fact I wish I had gone there to study, in some ways. At least this way though, I'm not paying international student fees.

I ended up picking up a personal project purely by coincidence in September, two months ago. I was visiting a small town near Kerry to see some friends before heading back to university for the autumn term. We ended up perusing the local charity shops, which were pretty cheap and full of knickknacks. One of my friends, Cait and I started joking about some of the things there being older than what I was studying, since I had just finished a module on Victorian pottery. We both laughed it off, but it did get me wondering about whether there was anything there I just wasn't seeing. You learn fairly early on in archaeology that sometimes there can be artefacts and history found in random people's houses, at car-boot sales, and charity shops. Unfortunately, much of it doesn't end up in museums.

I came away with a shabby necklace, and a nearly untouched pair of vintage doc Martens, spending just under €25, most of it being from the cost of the shoes. The necklace was an odd duck though. The 'string' seemed to be made out of some kind of tanned leather, with a series of white beads strung across it. It wasn't my usual style by any means, but it was weirdly charming and stuck out to me amongst all the clunky 2010s reminiscent jewellery. Also did help that it was 29¢.

It was only when my other friend David commented on it that I looked at it properly. He pointed it out while we were at the pub, asked which shop I had gotten it from. When I told him, he seemed to freeze up for a second before averting his eyes and relaxing. When I asked him why, he didn't give me any clear answer, instead saying it was nothing and moving on quickly, ordering another pint.

That night, as I laid awake on their couch, the buzzing of an electrical box keeping me awake, the necklace crossed my mind again. I was still wearing it, since it was fairly loose, and I was a little worried about breaking it in the process of removal. I hadn't been sleeping well, on account of being on a couch, but after I did eventually fall asleep, I began to wish that I hadn't. The first thing I noticed after waking up was the smell. It had me questioning if something terrible had happened or I was being messed with, it was that bad. It was almost like a peat bog, the stench of decomposition that anyone who has been near one will know what I'm talking about. It's one of those stinks that you can't get out of your nose for ages after it's there. The low talking from David and Cait's room was gone, so I figured that I had just woken up in the early hours. The low buzzing from earlier still persisted, and I figured that I wouldn't be able to get back to sleep again with that, so I tried to raise my head up. No luck. I tried reaching over to the ground to find my glasses or phone, planning to doom scroll until a socially acceptable hour, but my hand wouldn't move either. I attempted a leg, which with extreme effort I finally managed to nudge towards the edge of the couch, making me question whether it really was sleep paralysis. Every time I had experienced it before, it had been full body, often not even with anything scary, just the mild inconvenience of being immobile. This time, there was something else. 

The moment I moved that leg, making a small shuffling sound, the buzzing stopped. The only noise now was my breathing, growing heavier as my mind raced with reassurance. *It was a coincidence, you're alone, we'll wake up soon.* It wasn't enough to slow my breathing. The only counter I had was that awful stench, putting me into the same experience I imagine it is having a panic attack in a festival portaloo. Needing to breathe, but *really* not wanting to. After five or so minutes, I started to relax again, although not for long. As my breaths grew thankfully slower, I became aware that the heavy breathing I had been hearing wasn't any quieter. In fact, it was louder than ever, as if it was coming directly from me...

*or above your head.*

The thought had me panicking again. I tried pinpointing the sound but it was even louder still, and I still wasn't able to move my head to check the room. I felt bile in my throat at the smell, it was so close I could practically taste it on my breath. The breaths grew louder until I could feel hair brushing beside my ear, the icy feeling of cold breath making my skin crawl. In less than a millisecond, I could feel a strong force dragging at my necklace, practically forcing me up with a sharp tug. It must have been enough to wake me up properly, thank god, because I was bent over the loo within five minutes, puking my guts out and waking Cait and David up in the process. I stopped sleeping with the necklace on after that. Put it down to a mix of the beer in my system, and the jewellery probably snagging on something as I tossed about in my sleep.

Maybe it was a mix of my curiosity and that night (alongside a few more nights of sleep paralysis) which led to me taking the necklace to the lab, four weeks later. After I had brought it home, it had sat at the bottom of my bag for days before the smell made me pull it out. The weirdest part was, when I actually sniffed the thing, there wasn't anything there. Just the musty scent of old leather. I ended up fiddling with it while sitting in the library that day, holding it in my hands as I listened and made notes. After so long, I began to wonder what it was even made from, given the texture and weight. The leather I could deduce was probably from a cow, but the white beads had a really odd feel. They were heavier than plastic, but not quite enough to be a stone or metal, which led me to wonder if they were made from animal bone. it wouldn't be that unusual, maybe a bit strange to find randomly, but nothing I hadn't seen before. I had a lab scheduled later that day, so I planned to ask my tutor about it then. He came to a similar conclusion that I did, mentioning that if I was interested, there was similar jewellery currently at a local museum.

I thanked him, before I asked if he had any ideas on how old it was. He paused for a few minutes as he held the leather up to the light, looking the beads with a deep frown before handing it back over. He asked me where I had found it, and so I told him. After that, he asked me if he could send it off for sampling. I was confused, but agreed.

Around a month had passed before I asked him about the necklace again. By that point, I had another project lined up, so I wasn't overly concerned about getting it back. I was a bit annoyed sure, I had been curious about how old it was, where it was from, etc. There was some intrigue, mystery, and I was hoping for answers.

When my tutor did finally email me again, however, it wasn't with the answers, nor any results. It was an urgent request for me to come and speak to him during office hours regarding my research project. When those rolled around the next day, I managed to sneak off during a rare break between my lectures.

If I was to be brutally honest, he looked terrible. Huge grey bags under his eyes, a dishevelled and wrinkled shirt, and a pair of trousers with a large coffee stain on the front. His skin was deathly white, but I put a lot of that down to him being a university tutor given all the news stories about overworking and poor pay. It was what he told me that was really the kicker.

After handing him the necklace, he'd been curious himself about the material. So, after taking samples and sending them off, he'd decided to examine the leather in closer detail. When I had removed the leather from my neck, I had asked my flatmate who had untied it very carefully. He decided to forego that and cut it with a hair of scissors, instead of untying the new knot which I had tied in order to keep the beads on there. He told me, that as soon as he had severed the leather, there had been a burning sensation around his neck. The feeling persisted for long enough in the end that he asked his partner to look, upon which he discovered a pair of wet handprints, seemingly stuck to the skin with some kind of dirty liquid, like a water stain on a wall. Following that day, he told me that he'd experienced nightmares, which was when I chimed in with my own sleep paralysis stories. He looked somewhat relieved once I told him that, but the frown didn't leave his expression. He continued, telling me about regular spells of paranoia, illness, and misfortune. Small things, like being caught in the rain or losing your bank card, but often enough that it felt suspicious. I asked him if he knew what the material was, after all of that.

""Human. The leather is human skin, petrified and likely from a peat bog. Once I found that out, I sent for a carbon date as well as contacting the police. The results for the carbon date came back yesterday, police told the university that unless it was recent, they didn't need further involvement.""

""And the results?' I remember asking.

""3000BC.""

I couldn't hold back my surprise, nor my excitement. ""Do you still have it?""

""Well, that's the other thing I needed to discuss with you. The university has actually had offers from several museums for the necklace, but we've not been able to find it.""",1,1733514737.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I've been living in LA for the past 5 years, and I'm constantly discovering new and exciting things to do in this amazing city. Today, I want to share some awesome activities that'll make your time in Los Angeles unforgettable.

First off, let's talk about the must-see spots. Obviously, the Hollywood Sign and Walk of Fame are tourist favorites, but there's so much more to explore! I recently found this cool website (https://athometouch.com/losangeles) that helped me discover some hidden gems I didn't even know existed.

The beaches here are incredible. Venice Beach is perfect for people-watching and soaking up that classic LA vibe. Santa Monica Pier is another spot you can't miss - the sunset views are absolutely breathtaking, and the rides are super fun, especially if you're traveling with family.

For all my fellow foodies out there, Grand Central Market downtown is a food paradise. From authentic Mexican tacos to gourmet coffee, this place has it all. Speaking of food, the food truck scene here is insane! You can find everything from Korean fusion to gourmet grilled cheese.

If you're into nature, Griffith Observatory is a must-visit. The hiking trails offer amazing city views, and the observatory itself is fascinating. Runyon Canyon is another favorite spot for hiking enthusiasts - just make sure to bring water, it can get pretty hot!

For art lovers, The Getty Center and LACMA are world-class museums that'll blow your mind. The architecture alone is worth the visit. And don't get me started on the Instagram-worthy Urban Light installation at LACMA!

Looking for something different? Check out some local events and tours through this site: https://athometouch.com/losangeles. I've found some really unique experiences there, from food tours in Little Tokyo to hidden staircase walks in Silver Lake.

The comedy scene here is incredible too. The Comedy Store and Laugh Factory often have surprise appearances by famous comedians. Just last week, I saw Dave Chappelle do a surprise set!

For shopping addicts, The Grove is perfect for retail therapy, plus the farmers market next door is amazing for fresh produce and local treats. If you're into vintage stuff, hit up Melrose Trading Post on Sundays.

Universal Studios and Disneyland (technically in Anaheim) are obvious choices if you're into theme parks. Pro tip: go on weekdays to avoid massive crowds.

Remember, LA traffic is real, so plan your activities by area. Don't try to do Hollywood in the morning and Santa Monica in the afternoon - you'll spend half your day in traffic!

These are just some highlights - there's always something happening in this city. Whether you're into arts, food, outdoor activities, or entertainment, LA's got you covered. Feel free to ask any questions in the comments!",1,1733514689.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

I always thought it's a bit interesting but never really knew much about it. Then it turned out there's plenty of free tests online (I know that they can only be used as guidelines or reference point) and my scores were for example 42/50 or 46/50 which led me to a conclusion that it might be the right time to read a bit about it.

Well, it almost felt like a big relief and it was this kind of long anticipated feeling of being understood where all the pieces fall into place. At the same time my thoughts were dancing between ""ok, so now I'm weird"" and ""even if I know I'm autistic, how will it change my life?"".

I was trying to look at my own life from a different perspective. So I'm a 40 M living alone in a different country for many years, have no close friends here. I have now a stable career and earn good money but was comfortable earning close to minimum wage due to a frugal lifestyle. I am definitely socially very weird, I always tend to avoid people, I am single. There's only a handful of people that I will talk to and where I feel there is some sort of emotional connection between us. Since I can remember people always almost hated me for having my own rules and never breaking them. I always thought - why does it even bother them? It won't hurt anyone that I do things my way. So for example I drink absolutely zero alcohol, zero coffee, no drugs, used to be super fit (was into dance, martial arts, acrobatics), didn't watch TV or any movies at all for almost 20 years and had no clue about all the movies that people were talking about. 

I can't make up my mind whether I am doing alright with my everyday life. I have a job, health is very good, I enjoy cooking and won't even touch any junk food etc. but at the same time there is an insane mess in my room. It has always been like this. I sometimes have a feeling that I can dive deeply into something that I find fascinating and that I can see/hear/sense things that others can't. I am also a synesthete, I see connections between numbers and emotions (and also between sounds/chord progressions and emotional tension). I love numbers. 

There are times when I can see see some nice results of who I am (recently won a piano competition, speak 4 languages on a daily basis, still learn a couple more etc.) but in general I have a very low self-esteem and see my future in very dark colours. 

And I am thinking now - I can go and see a doctor and let's assume I will be diagnosed. What would that change in my life?

So, when my crush was packing up and leaving, my crush, I asked her if she was leaving. She said she was going to a cafe to work with that common friend.

At that time, the common friend asked me to come along as well. I said I don't mind as I like coffee (that's  true). Anyway, my crush was a bit uncomfortable at that.

When we finally went to the Cafe and got our drinks, she called one of her girl friends, who was out with her boyfriend for dinner nearby, and said once they're done with dinner she will meet them.

At this time I asked her - ""What's holding you back? (from fun)"".

She said - ""Not having a boyfriend!""  Then she changed the topic and said it's because she has too much work.

If you didn't see my last game dev post documenting 30 days, then check that out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1gltkxc/what_30_days_of_game_dev_looks_like/) :D

I ended up finishing [this C# 8h YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGpSQsS8uc&t=32s&ab_channel=CoffeeNCode) and even though I did not fully understand every single thing, it gave me a good understanding of what was possible and how I should be thinking about coding when working with Godot. A big change was how I was approaching problems. Here is a snippet of what I have made so far in Godot.

[Sandbox TD game](https://reddit.com/link/1h89zps/video/rwtd27xd4a5e1/player)

Some changes to how I think happened after going through that C# coding video. So let's say I wanted a tower to shoot an enemy. Instead of trying to find a tutorial by searching something like ""Tower Defense tutorial enemy damage Godot"" and scouring the many different tutorials of different versions and quality, I instead start breaking the problems down into chunks that would make sense from a coding perspective. So I want the enemy to have a Collision, I want the tower to react to when the enemy enters its range with like an Area2D. When the collision walks into the Area2D, how can I make it aware that it is inside that Area2D, which would then trigger a damage function? Should the damage function be on the tower or enemy script? How can I prevent it from shooting all enemies and just hit the first one that enters its range? Perhaps use groups for that? I am now looking more at the coding framework that is required to make something happen instead of trying to find specific tutorials that recreates what I need (and let's be real, a tutorial never suits 100% of your game needs...).

Another shift has been to focus more on growth as a game dev instead of finishing a game. I am now using the game as a sandbox to explore the possibilities of Godot. So for example making a title screen, adding sound, using tweens, screen shake, save and load, scene transitions, creating knockback etc. I have a shortlist of mechanics I see in games that I want to make in the future that I want to try and recreate. These are mechanics that I know I will probably use in the future so making a single instance of the mechanic, learning as much as possible from that and then move on to another mechanic is the learning strategy that I currently have. This differs from before where I would want to tweak a mechanic and massage it until it was perfect for the game, which led to a lot of nudging around with minimal learning and growth.

Learning how to use the Godot debugger has made me go into detective mode instead of frustration mode whenever I hit an error. It allows me to work backwards and find where problems stem from. Press besides any line to toggle a breakpoint in the code, then hover over many different things to see if they contain the value, paths or logic that you were expecting. Being a new game dev really throws the whole kitchen sink of runtime issues at ya! Googling error messages is also something I do quite often as they are quite cryptic at times haha.

[Github Shenanigans](https://preview.redd.it/0rzg78ai7a5e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2ebb46c0e22ff09b2acbb1336b1875e2b8429a7)

I started using GitHub and it has also been a great way to keep tabs on my journey as a coder. Whenever I get to a milestone (like making a functional state machine), I commit it to GitHub and it will always be there for me! I see it also as a mini journal of learnings. It of course also keeps a backup so if I ever mess things up beyond recovery or lose my computer, I will have a backup in the cloud.

I have been experimenting with ChatGPT and it is really amazing for learning. So I don't want it to write the code for me, instead I want it to tell me what is possible and how I could achieve something with different methods. So for example referencing properties. I asked ChatGPT ""what are all the ways you can reference properties between objects in Godot 4.x?"" and got 12 different ways and examples of doing it. Then I tried implementing some of them in Godot.

[The code for the label positioning below. Each label gets its positional properties in different ways.](https://preview.redd.it/0au2bcaj5a5e1.jpg?width=1537&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9280128a84c46e5218778c9cc85994ae69cbec1)

I didn't implement all 12 ways but I managed to implement a bunch and know how they function. With me now being aware of these methods, I can always come back and reference these example if there is a certain property reference that needs something specific.

I also managed to get two of my IRL friends into game dev, which is also a big motivational factor as we are all now working on refining our skills to hopefully partake in a GameJam down the road. These two friends were the ones who first got me into game dev (we were having coffee and just talking about how cool it would be to code games and our dream games). That was the catalyst that started this journey and I am super glad that they are now coming along for the ride!

If you haven't seen [Miziziziz's rad videos on 4 Game Developers, One Art Kit](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmugv6_kd0qMgc7Bd2gO7cbfrdBIQrdpV&si=mwilLodbF6j0sYRN), I highly recommend checking that out both for inspiration and understanding how game dev's think. I binged that playlist in a day or so haha.

I have a list of things I want to try and better understand and some of those include functions, callable, signals, tweens and more. There was this one video that blew my mind on [Callables by Blargis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56I72m5wDj4&ab_channel=Blargis) so that will probably be my next learning stepping stone! My strategy will be to slowly learn each of these game elements on a fundamental level (like how I did with properties) and continue levelling up that way.

“Ventura: the city where gentrification moved in like it was opening a boutique coffee shop, and suddenly the 'authentic charm' became a $9 avocado toast. You’re the place where old surf shops are getting replaced by overpriced boutiques that sell 'handmade' candles that probably came from Target. Your downtown's trying so hard to be 'up-and-coming,' but the only thing actually 'coming up' are the rents, pushing out the locals who used to give this place any character. And let’s not forget, half the population here is old enough to remember when the freeway was just a dirt road, so the vibe feels more 'retirement community' than 'trendy beach town.' It’s like a place caught between gentrification and social security checks. The vibe is half 'hidden gem' and half 'we’re sorry, what happened to the cool, gritty beach town?' But hey, at least you can now enjoy a craft beer while you look at the condos being built where the taco stand used to be. Truly a place where the only thing that's authentic is the nostalgia for what used to be.”

1h89vxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MovingThroughChange/comments/1h89vxz/rituals_change/,Rituals & Change,"Think of how we mark major transitions in life—graduations, weddings, funerals. We create rituals, deeply tied to our beliefs and values. Even that morning cup of coffee is a ritual of sorts, isn't it? A way to mark the start or end of something meaningful—the day-to-day, an accomplishment, a milestone.

So, why are rituals important? Psychology 101 teaches us that rituals, like habits, provide a sense of control and comfort during times of uncertainty. They create a space to honor the past while opening ourselves to the future.

Remember the final episode of *Friends*? In Season 10, Episode 18, aptly titled *The Last One,* the group bids farewell to their iconic New York apartment. It’s an emotional moment as they reflect on the apartment as more than just a space—it symbolized friendship, connection, and a meaningful chapter of their lives. They honor its closure with a heartfelt moment of silence—a ritual.

By acknowledging the importance of life transitions, we can better prepare for change. Rituals like a housewarming, blessing a new space with sage, or setting positive intentions can ground us in these moments.

What rituals have helped you adjust to a major life transition? (Yes, even that cup of coffee counts!)

1h89va9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueNarcissisticAbuse/comments/1h89va9/a_therapy_summary/,A Therapy Summary,"(A long post) So I'm meeting with my therapist on Monday. She is a new therapist, and I'm compiling a list of things I plan on sharing with her, to give her an idea for what I'm dealing with, and thought I would share with everyone to get your thoughts. I thought that before deciding to end the relationship, I could start seeing a therapist to go over what I've dealt with and get her thoughts on it.

* When he questions why I do things, and I share with him things from my past or childhood that explain why I do certain things, he will roll his eyes and start doing stuff on his phone (being very dismissive).
* He moved in with me because he had a horrible experience with his roommate (which I'm now starting to understand why that might've been). After moving in with me:
   * He required that we start composting 
   * He had very strict requirements for recycling
   * Was relentless about asking me if I washed my hands
   * He watched over me like a hawk when I cooked, ensuring I was property preparing and cooking the food, and sanitizing the countertops to his liking.
* After moving in, he said we had to go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time each day. I have always stuck to this because of how much it meant to him that his sleep not be interrupted because he’s a light sleeper. He does not give me the same respect. He wakes up and goes to bed whenever he wants. Even if I want to be in bed, lights turned off, and sleeping by 11pm, he’ll be up way past that. He’ll come into the bedroom at 11.30pm, turns lights on, and then he starts getting ready for bed. Different set of rules for me than it is for him. I’m the one that has to adjust my sleep schedule for him, it’s never the other way around. 
* He has told me that if I am doing something that effects him (making dinner, doing laundry, cleaning the house, driving, etc) and it's not done the way he wants it, he is going to speak up and say something about it because it effects him.
* If I bring up something he does or says, and tell him how it makes me feel, he never…and I mean never…takes ownership. Instead of apologizing or taking ownership for his words or actions, he will always flip it back onto me. He’s very good at this. 
   * 1 of many examples: 2 weeks ago, he wanted to make cards for his mom, who was recently diagnosed with cancer. They were little cards that would either say something funny, or be a poem, or something motivational. They were just things to help her through her treatment. It was his sister’s idea. He waited until the VEEEEEERY last minute to do them. After he got home from work, he rushed to do them, and then wanted to leave to go play soccer at an open gym, so he asked me to go take them to the mail so he could go play soccer. I kind of smiled, and he asked me why I was smiling. I told him I was frustrated that he waited until the last minute to do it, and now I have to be the one to go take them to the UPS store to get mailed out. His reply to me saying that was, “Well, I would’ve gotten them done, but my time was taken all weekend with other things. And then we went to go see that movie you wanted to see with our friends. I guess I’ll just miss my first soccer game then.” Instead of taking ownership of his lack of time management, he placed the blame on me. I relented and took them to the mail for him. Again, if I took the time, I could think of more examples. This is just the most recent one.
* 4-5 months into living together, he told me he didn’t like the location of my house and he wanted me to sell the house to move. This evolved into talking about it publicly in front of friends, where he would bring up his points as a way of proving to me that it was the right idea. If I disagreed or said I didn’t want to do it, it would cause an argument. At one point, he flat out told me that he hated the house and living there and was highly motivated to sell the house and move. He gave every reason why him moving in with me was a sacrifice for him- like living further away from his friends (including the couple he was in a relationship with prior to us dating), living further away from work, giving up his ability to garden, not being able to ride his bike around the city. In my head, those were incredibly immature reasons to ask your partner of a little over a year to sell their house and move. He should've considered those things prior to moving in. After months of pressure, I finally relented, and I regret it. 
* In the middle of pressuring me to sell my house, he went on a coffee date with someone he used to hook up with prior to our relationship. Apparently they were visiting from out of state, but I have no way of knowing if that's true. He said he did it to make sure that continuing in a relationship with me was something he really wanted. I came VERY close to breaking up with him then, and I don’t think I every fully recovered. It’s been a year.
* After moving into the new house, he wanted to get a dog. I already had two cats, but he doesn’t like them and wanted a dog. Admittedly, I was open to the idea, but this has turned into me doing most of the heavy lifting taking care of the dog since I work from home and he goes into the office each day. 
* He tells me I can absolutely not work before or after my work hours, but he frequently stays late. I never mention it at all, but he’s always sure to mention it to me when I have to.
* He’s always correcting me. If I share a fact or something I remember with him (or with others when he’s around me), he’ll correct me, often telling me that I’m wrong or didn’t remember something the right way. He does this in private and when we're around people. Friends have told me they notice it too. It happens all day, every day. I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t share as much with him anymore, or if I’m asked something, I give shorter answers than I typically would.
* He always feels the need to play the blame game. If something happens around the house (ie: the dog chewed up the remote), he immediately looks to place blame at me. This led to a huge argument, where I asked him why someone always had to be at fault. Why can’t we just recognize something happened and try to be more solution based in our thinking?
* One time, after having a few drinks with friends, we got home and there was a box in the garage that had fallen. I had maybe been in the garage for 30 seconds that day and went nowhere near the box. He argued with me, screaming and yelling and clapping his hands, trying to get me to admit that I had moved the box, when I knew for a fact that I didn't. The next day, he was very apologetic. I told him that going forward, I will disengage from conversations that are argumentative when either of us has had a drink because the conversation we had was incredibly destructive and wasn’t healthy.
* Our sex life has come to a screeching halt. Since May, we’ve had intercourse twice. I do not think that is normal. This week alone, he’s brought up the idea of watching porn together, which I’m not really into... and seems like an emotionally distant way to still get off. We also had an incident when we were at the zoo this week, where he opened his snapchat and an xxx photo from someone's story he follows popped up on his phone. I kind of froze and didn’t know how to react. It made me upset and sad and frustrated.
* If we’re talking about something and he gives me advice, if I don’t follow his advice, he gets very upset and lashes out.
* When we have social interactions, he tends talk negatively about many of our friends behind their backs. I get that being a partner to him means I get to hear some of that, but it’s a lot. He’s very pessimistic behind their backs, but then when we get around them, it’s all warmth and hugs and laughs. I personally feel like he's incredibly emotionally immature. This was the cause of our first big argument. He had been venting about his old roommate all day. It was literally the only thing we talked about. I did my best to listen as much as I could. Cut to 1am and we’re driving home from dinner with friends…he’s still going on about it. I asked him if we could talk about something else, and he absolutely lost his shit. He told me, “how dare I cut him off when he was speaking and ask him to change the subject.” After lashing out at me, he gave me the silent treatment the rest of the night. It was the first time in our relationship he made me cry. That was 4 months into our relationship.

That's what I have so far. I'm curious what your thoughts are, or if any of you have any similar experiences? Really looking forward to seeing my therapist about this.",1,1733514203.0,TrueNarcissisticAbuse,0,1.0,False

And coffee perpetuates the addictive tendencies by training me to want that kick. To always to looking for a burst of excitement.

I have gone through 4 periods in my life where addictions basically took over. At the end it was mainly alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine. And it starts like this: I get myself very healthy, with lots of work. Years of work really. Breaking bad habits, developing super clean diet habits, changing the way I think about things and how I view life. And then coffee innocently introduces itself. And it’s nice. But its effects after a while feel like not enough. And it trains me to want to put something in my body that will produce a pleasant effect. It also seems to have a weird way of blocking dopamine response from natural, healthy things. Like I just cannot feel good without some kind of real chemical kick. Then nicotine and or alcohol introduce themselves into my life. And it all seems to start innocently enough. Dabbling here and there. But looking back I can see that I have gone down that road many times. And I’ve ended up basically getting shitfaced most nights of the week, sucking on nicotine lozenges, drinking gobs of strong coffee. And then the slow process of realization begins again that I am poinsoning myself. And it usually has to get pretty bad for that’s to happen, and it’s a long painful process of breaking those addictions, and often I view coffee and caffeine innocently, like it’s not part of the problem. And I struggle to quit my other bad habits until I finally realize that addiction is addiction, and clinging onto caffeine addiction does not allow my brain to fully reorganize to a non-addictive state. Food is in there too. Because that can also be the last addiction that I and others cling on to. Eating for pleasure, rather than for nourishment, and only when truly hungry.

It might seem strange, but coffee is the gateway drug for me. 

I just wanted to put this out there. Partly just to organize my own thoughts about it, but maybe others can relate.

Edit: I wanted to add a couple more thoughts. Often when trying to break out of these addictive patterns, I quit all the real toxic ones, but stick with coffee for a long time. And when I’ve been there, even though I’m much healthier than when drinking every day, the coffee kind of makes everything I do an addiction. Even exercise. I go out and run, or bike, hard, but I’m doing it specifically to get a kick from endorphins. It’s an odd state to be in. The caffeine addiction keeps me in a state of trying to get chemical kicks, even though I have eliminated the more poisonous chemicals, and it has my brain looking for constant stimulation.",3,1733514165.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

Every morning I wake up to several alarms with a voice in my head screaming “get up! You have to get up! You have to stop doing this!” Even being gently confronted about it at work hasn’t created the urgency to get out of my bed in time to get to my job with normal reasonable hours. Every time I look for solutions I always get the same suggestions. Nice peaceful little routines that are apparently the backbone of humanity. 


My relationship with habits is bad. I hate them. I despise the idea of any action being automated. The idea of my body telling me to go to sleep and not having the option to stay up (I’m not up past midnight anyway) is aggravating. It’s like my autonomy is stripped by my own body. 
Maybe I am capable of forming habits. Maybe it is just a failing of character and I really am lazy. That doesn’t change the fact that I have failed every single time I have tried. 

My worst bad habit is being late to work. I know it’s bad. I know people think less of me for it, and they are right to do so. I have tried everything from rewarding myself with coffees I can only have if I leave on time (this has only been a reward i have managed to achieve once) to several alarms. Drinking water before bed. Sleep hygiene that works until l I have to do literally anything after work (so maybe three days before a disruption)(and when I did find a routine that worked my therapist told me it was bad and wrong and I had to do the same “put down your phone and read a book” thing because that is universally successful apparently. It didn’t stick.) Any time someone sweetly suggests an easy little five minute a day routine I feel violent rage.

Selen was someone that was being harassed by other livers (according to Nijisanji's termination letter), and that management decided to side with Selen's harassers instead of her.

During the Black Screen Stream, Vox said that Selen was recording her conversations with him without his consent over the course of a year. Which tells me that at that point, Selen felt that she needed to gather her own evidence. That was probably the point in time where Selen lost her faith in management. 

We saw it through moments in 2023 like the May Art Contest where Selen revealed it was Nijisanji that didn't want to give a monetary prize for the free character design work that would go along as part of the contest. There was also that time when Selen revealed that she was banned from organizing company wide events right as she just announced a Fall Guys Tournament a couple days earlier. And of course, Selen asking people to re-upload her Last Cup Of Coffee music video against the wishes of the company.

Selen was rebelling big time.

With recent events showing us that there are other harassers within the company in the case of Aster, it makes me wonder if another liver will come out bursting out of the woodwork with their own story?

While sure we may have not been seeing livers rebelling as much as Selen, hell the recent screen shots gives us an example of a liver being too scared to do so due to fear of being blacklisted, it doesn't mean that there isn't a boiling point behind the scenes that's about to be reached.

With the revelations about Aster, Selen's harassers still being in the company possibly going after another victim, and with Nijisanji's track record for handling these kinds of things, it's only a matter of time before we hear about another horrible story. I just hope it doesn't come to the worst case scenario.

And that also begs the question, what will Niji EN'S future be after an event like that?",8,1733513885.0,kurosanji,7,0.83,False

He's not physically abusive, but he has a short temper and will become angry and cussing very quickly. On top of that, he always needs some form of revenge if he feels slighted. Like I tried to talk to him about how he spends $1000+ a month on herbal remedies that aren't working, and I ended up getting banned from drinking coffee (which costs us about $20 a month).

The problem at hand though, is that he's refusing medical treatment for our toddler who has really bad eczema. It's so bad, she scratches until she bleeds. She won't play with toys, she barely eats, she won't even walk on her own (needs to be carried around all day). She only wants to scratch. She wakes up 3 or 4 times a night screaming about being itchy. Through it all, my husband will only do herbal or alternative medicine treatments. We've never even tried hydrocortisone or even an over the counter lotion. He pays $300 a month on a specialty lotion that doesn't seem to be working.

I'm fairly confident that insisting he use hydrocortisone or any regular medical approach will result in him yelling at me, and probably kicking me out of the house. I've made my peace with that, to the point that I have a friend who said I could stay at her place if it comes to that. The problem I'm having is working up the courage to confront my husband.

About me: I love video games, especially warframe so if there's anyone in eu servers (or pretty much anywhere, I don't mind) who wants to play then hit me up ! I also love playing the piano so I'll probably play the piano for you if we're close enough haha. I also like having the occasional reading time while drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette, just trying to chill and allow myself to drown deeper into the imaginary world that books usually take you to.

What I'm looking for: well i am 23 so minors do not message me, I prefer someone around the age of 20-30 but 18 is okay too, I'm bisexual, not that it really matters but the point is I'm up to talk to anyone doesn't matter their gender or whatever. I know what it's like being judged for things you can't control so I'm the last person who would do that. I'm looking for a person who's kind, funny, someone who's down to texting at the odd hours of the night sometimes, or play video games with me and listen to each other venting about life and shit like that.

1h89ksc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1h89ksc/question_about_signs_from_girls/,Question About Signs From Girls,"Okay, so I guess I should preface this by saying that I recently broke up with my ex about 3 months ago and it became psychologically abusive towards the end and I felt like I was shattered a little bit emotionally.

But, I feel like I was still able to have fun and enjoy myself and I felt like I would still have good interactions with girls after that. I guess maybe I am trying to understand if I am maybe doing something wrong?

I feel like I am generally just a fun, silly person and I can be a bit deranged (kind of like Conan O'Brien I guess?) and I don't try to be someone I am not because I feel like I realized from my past relationship that if someone doesn't like me for exactly who I am, then 3 or 4 months in, I am not going to enjoy being with that person. Also, if someone doesn't enjoy my authentic qualities, what could I offer them in return?

I feel like there were two incidents where I felt like:

1. I went hiking all day with a girl and she was initiating a lot of conversation and she even took pictures of me (and made a post with only pictures of me on her Instagram, where she even PUT TWO HEARTS IN THE CAPTION). We were really silly the whole time and laughing and I even went to dinner with her and a friend and she would find reasons to touch me and she even came to the lounge of the hostel I was staying at where just my friend and I were talking and she sat next to me, asked if we could watch Netflix, and put her legs up on me. And all this to say, when I started flirting her a bit on Instagram after we left the hostel, she told me SHE WASN'T INTERESTED LIKE THAT.
2. I met this girl on a boat tour where we just happened to sit next to each other and I didn't really see her as anything in the beginning (because I thought she had a boyfriend before I got her Instagram haha) but I was still talking to her in general and making jokes which she thought were funny. And she gave me a spare towel she had later in the trip when I was shivering a bit (to be fair, this was just a kind thing to do - I am not reading in to this haha) but we kept talking and I told her about my Spain trip and we were just talking about ourselves and how we got to the tour and having a good conversation in general, and I told her she could get my Instagram at the end if she wanted me to share my itinerary for the Greece trip I went on, and she asked me for my Instagram after. But when I try to make a plan to even get coffee with her, it seems like she is not interested.

I also went on a speed dating event recently where I felt like I had some nice conversations with a lot of the girls (and they were maintaining good eye contact and laughing) and I feel like I am not a terrible-looking guy (although my friend recently told me I would look much better without my beard, although some people think my beard looks amazing, so idk what to think about that haha). I did fuck up a little bit with some of the girls by talking about my ex with one girl or sharing a really dirty joke with another one, but generally I thought the conversations were good (although I was kind of shot after like the 3rd conversation mentally haha, and maybe my default mode is to be deranged.) I only matched with one of the girls there (which was good at least, but there were like 8 girls haha) but I guess I told a lot of the girls I didn't really like the city (which was where they lived) and I was in a job search (and I guess I was already in the lower end of the age range for this event lol).

I guess what I am trying to ask in a HUGE TL;DR: I am having lots of conversations with girls inside and outside of dating-related events which seem good and they seem to find me funny and we have what I think are nice conversations and I enjoy the conversation as well. I guess I enjoy being a bit deranged, but I feel like it's not in a bad way haha. I guess I am just wondering - is there some common thread among the interactions I have with the people outside and inside of dating events that I am just not seeing? I think I am not the hottest guy ever, but I think I am quite decent-looking, and I guess I am just wondering if maybe I am doing something super wrong? I guess I could plan to ask a few more questions in the dating related event and obviously I should plan to move to the same city as them if I am interested in dating them lmao.

I don't think I should change who I am (because I feel like that's the best thing I can give to people) but I also would like to be a bit more successful in situations where I feel like I am doing fine haha.",1,1733513448.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

He's not physically abusive, but he has a short temper and will become angry and cussing very quickly. On top of that, he always needs some form of revenge if he feels slighted. Like I tried to talk to him about how he spends $1000+ a month on herbal remedies that aren't working, and I ended up getting banned from drinking coffee (which costs us about $20 a month).


The problem at hand though, is that he's refusing medical treatment for our toddler who has really bad eczema. It's so bad, she scratches until she bleeds. She won't play with toys, she barely eats, she won't even walk on her own (needs to be carried around all day). She only wants to scratch. She wakes up 3 or 4 times a night screaming about being itchy. Through it all, my husband will only do herbal or alternative medicine treatments. We've never even tried hydrocortisone or even an over the counter lotion. He pays $300 a month on a specialty lotion that doesn't seem to be working. 


I'm fairly confident that insisting he use hydrocortisone or any regular medical approach will result in him yelling at me, and probably kicking me out of the house. I've made my peace with that, to the point that I have a friend who said I could stay at her place if it comes to that. The problem I'm having is working up the courage to confront my husband.

As a physician who lived to be 105, he shaped modern healthcare by prioritizing preventive medicine. He believed that early detection and consistent self-care were vital for long-term health, and his innovative approaches still resonate within the medical community.

His lifestyle was rooted in simplicity and discipline. He started his mornings with a light breakfast, often coffee and olive oil-infused juice, and maintained a lean diet focused on balance rather than indulgence. He saw moderation as a cornerstone of health, emphasizing the value of nourishing the body without overburdening it.

Physical activity was seamlessly integrated into his day-to-day life. Rather than following structured fitness regimens, he chose practical movement, like climbing stairs and carrying his own belongings. These small, consistent actions reflected his belief in the importance of staying active, regardless of age or circumstance.

Dr. Hinohara also understood the link between emotional well-being and physical health. He championed the integration of art, music, and other therapeutic approaches into medicine, aiming to heal both the body and the mind. His holistic view of health remains influential in modern discussions about the factors that contribute to longevity.

His life offers powerful lessons about living with intention. Through his work, habits, and philosophy, Dr. Hinohara showed that longevity isn’t simply about adding years but about filling those years with purpose, vitality, and joy.

I’ve met several students in the campus student center and have sort of made a new friend. We’ve hung out twice so far—once when he gave me a ride home (we stopped at a park to walk and chat), and another time when he invited me to see a live band at a coffee shop with a few other students.

He’s very friendly and seems like someone who enjoys helping his friends. However, he has a pattern of bringing up hugs and cuddling in conversation, which makes me feel awkward and uncomfortable.

For example:

Early in our texting, he asked, “Since you like being indoors all the time, would you like a cuddle buddy?” I replied, “Thanks for the offer, but I’m more of a virtual hug type of person and am generally averse to touch.”

After the coffee shop, he asked if I wanted a hug, and I said, “Thanks, but I really don’t like hugs or being touched—even my relatives don’t hug me, haha.”

This morning, when I texted, “What’s new with you this morning?” he replied, “Searching for someone to wrap up in a blanket, how about you?” (edit to add that I haven't responded to this message yet)

I thought I was clear about my feelings, but he continues to bring up touch and cuddling. I asked my mom for advice, and she suggested just ignoring him, but I don’t want to be rude. I’m introverted, awkward, and not used to having IRL friends or dealing with situations like this, so I’m looking for perspectives on how to handle this or how would you feel or react.

They say a nightmare is your subconscious manifesting what you fear most and in my case, truer words were never spoken.

Monsters and demons do little in the way of frightening me so I never think about them. My wife's infedelity with my best friend behind my back on the other hand, terrifies me.

It's something I think about a lot.

Between you, me, and the lampost, my wife is out of my league so it's possible that these dreams stem from the insecurity of a man who is punching above his weight class. It's damn hard being a homely balding man with a bombshell wife. It's harder still when your tall and handsome best friend Jason, who introduced the two of you used to sleep with her.

Last night's dream was no different than the others. It began in the same manner as the ones that preceded it with the song of my alarm clock.

In a dream you can be like anyone you want. You aren't bound to the habits and shortcomings of your waking self. Dreams are the ultimate refuge of the weak and the meager. A domain free of constraints or fear. A universe where you are finally master of your own destiny.

That's the best I can describe how I am when the nightmare begins. It's apparent that I'm dreaming because I feel powerful, aware and confident. A stark contrast to the real world where I am none of those things.

I must be a mundane human being because this recurring nightly vision is filled with my day to day life instead of sex with models or adventures in fantastical far away lands.

Four years straight of this broken record of a reverie, and even while unconscious I can lucidly predict what happens next.

Instead of hitting snooze on my cellphone as I would in real life, I fling the covers off of me getting to my feet rapidly, wearing nothing but my boxer shorts and eyeing my beautiful wife already dressed in her yoga outfit that leaves little to the imagination.

Seated at her vanity, tying her long auburn hair into a ponytail, she meets my gaze in the mirror. 

""Morning, panda bear!"" she smiles.

I offer no reply as I stomp over to her while grabbing a fistful of her freshly tied hair, jerking it back abruptly to force her eyes up to me. Enjoying the look she's never given me in real life.

A combination of fear and arousal.

She's too stunned to speak as I trace my finger around her lips before kissing her hard and pulling her up from her chair, hair still in hand.

I use my body weight to push her up against the nearest wall.

""Never call me that again."" I whisper in Sandy's ear with authority.

I can feel her melt into me with the shiver she gave as my hand traveled up her inner thigh. 

""Wha-"" she begins before being interrupted with another kiss. Feeling the heat her body was emitting as I dominated her coupled with the sound of her quick labored breath in my ear is always enough to cause my hands to shake with adrenaline. I won't lie to you, I very much enjoy this part of the dream. It's what I imagine men like Jason feel like everyday.

Powerful.

In some small way I'm thankful that I get to experience this passion that men like me rarely do, even if only until I wake up.

I release her and make my way over to our in room bathroom. Throwing a glance over my shoulder at her where she stands awkwardly up against that wall. Her face flushed, nipples now clearly visible under her skin tight t-shirt. I watch them rise and fall with every deep breath she takes.

I close the door behind me when she finally speaks.

""Dear lord in heaven, pand-"" she catches herself. ""Sammy.""

I smile at myself in the mirror at this victory as I turn the faucet.

""My goodness!"" she continues, ""I'm late for my yoga class."" I hear her pick up the duffle bag from the floor, ""but when you get back from work, I want to see some more of... whatever that was!"" Her voice becoming smaller with each footstep she takes toward our front door. ""Have a good day, love you!""

When the front door locks behind her, I exit the bathroom. I pick up my phone from the nightstand to call my boss and wait for him to answer. 

""Hiya Sam!"" his stupidly happy ""morning person"" voice greets me.""What can I do you for?"" He giggles.

""You can shut the fuck up!"" I respond mimicking his happy tone perfectly.

""Excu-"" he begins apprehensively.

""No no, none of that."" I cut him off, shushing him. ""I hate your stupid voice."" I chuckle. ""Don't speak, just listen.""

This is another part of this that I enjoy immensely. It's the secret wish of almost every working man to be able to tell his boss where he can stick it. I savor every word that escapes my lips, leaving behind a sweet after taste on this newfound silver toungue.

""I gotta get something off my chest."" I inhale deeply before starting. ""I hate your stupid voice, I hate your stupid face, I hate your stupid company, and in the name of all things good and holy, your wifes meat loaf is disgusting.""

He gasps through the wire.

""Fuck you Carl!"" I laugh at his shock. ""Fuck you, you stupid ugly son of a bitch, I quit!"" I don't even take the time to hang up the phone. I just wind up like a baseball pitcher and throw it with all my might against the bedroom wall causing a substantial dent where my wife stood moments earlier. Admiring the beautiful intricacies of the phones shattered glass where it rests on the floor. 

I whistle to myself as I put one of my blazer jackets on. Approving of my fashion choice combination of underwear and suit jacket in the full length mirror by the door.

Being caught without pants in a dream seems to be the fear of every character in almost all of the sitcoms I've watched. In my case however, I find it oddly empowering. 

I leave the door to my house open behind me and enjoy how the grass of my lawn feels between my toes as I survey the prison known as the suburbs. 

My nosy next-door neighbor Carol is out tending to her flowers, staring at me from bended knee. Garden spade hanging loosely in her gloved hand.

""Um... Good morning Sam."" She calls out confused but waving. ""Got the day off work?""

I can't contain my laughter as I shift my body in her direction. ""Ah Carol."" I smile. ""You nosy joyless bitch of a woman, how the hell are ya?"" Folding my arms over my chest in mock interest.

Her mouth hangs open at my response.

""Cat got your tongue?"" I say taking a step towards her. ""That's incredible, I never thought I'd see the day you went silent."" Another step. ""That's probably why your husband left you, you know?"" Mere feet away from her now never halting my approach. ""You just can't shut the fuck up."" I stop at the foot of her garden. Towering over the clearly frightened woman staring up at me with her mouth still agape. ""And speaking of cats, if I catch yours shitting on my lawn again-"" I bend my body to put my lips right against her ear. ""I'll fucking skin it, then I'll fucking skin you!""

She screams as I abruptly stand, raising my foot before bringing it down with all of my strength on her precious tulips. Repeating the process over and over until every single flower is flattened into the earth. Much in the same way Godzilla stomps buildings in a Japanese B-movie. Laughing hysterically all the while. 

""Bye Carol!"" I scream after the old woman as she flees as fast as her fat legs can carry her away from me. ""Can't wait to see what casserole you make for the next neighborhood council meeting!""

I laugh as I fish in my pocket for the car keys to the candy apple red convertible Mazda Miata my wife asked me to buy for her. I laugh at its musical beep as I remotely unlock the doors on the way, and I laugh harder still at the ridiculous sound this tiny engine makes upon ignition in comparison to my black BMW that Sandy takes instead.

I switch on the stereo as I peel down my street, tires screeching in the process. ""And I would do anything for love!"" I scream, singing along to the 90's Meatloaf hit that blares full blast through the speakers of the Miata as I drive like a madman to Jason's house. Laughing at the zombies that inhabit this city as they dive out of the way of the speeding vehicle that blows every stop light and traffic sign on the way to its destination. Thinking they really should be thanking me for the thrill I'm providing for their empty domesticated lives. ""And these are the days that never end!"" I continue bellowing along with the singer. Feeling the wind rustle in my hair as I drive the pedal down further with my dirty bare foot.

I kill the ridiculous engine and exit the vehicle when I arrive. I notice my black BMW parked in Jason's driveway and run my hands over its sharp curves that are warm to the touch from being out in the sun. They must think so little of me to have the audacity to keep their evidence out in broad daylight.

Still humming the song of my journey as I use the spare key he gave me years earlier to water his plants while he was away on business, gaining entrance.

I shut the door behind me and draw the curtains. The bed creaks loudly and rhythmically from the upstairs bedroom. Accompanied by the soft moaning of my wife and the percussion of skin on skin contact, musically tying together the symphony of adultery.

I walk up the stairs snapping my fingers in time with its tempo which is remarkably similar to Billy Jean. Bobbing my head to its beat and when I reach the top, I break out into my best moonwalk towards the source of the music.

The door is slightly ajar and I can't help but notice a marble ashtray on the chest of drawers that faced the bed. Two half smoked cigarettes left smoldering in their own embers. 

Funny, Sandy demanded I quit smoking on our wedding day, she said she disliked the smell.

Another striking example of her hypocrisy is the fact that she is faced down as he takes her from behind, knuckles white as she clutches the mattress. A position she told me she wasn't comfortable with. 

She looked plenty comfortable to me.

Tempo never missed a beat. Jason, to his credit, is at the very least consistent.

The door squeaks as I push it open further, alerting the lovers to my presence. Passing its threshold, I head straight to the cigarettes. I pick up the one closest to me and puff on it a few times to get it hotter.

""Shit..."" Jason begins as he wraps one of the sheets around his waist while dismounting my wife in a panic.

""Panda bear!"" Sandy chimes in, pivoting and pulling up a spare pillow to cover her breasts. 

All I can do is laugh at the futility of this motion of hers. ""No need to cover up sweetheart."" I say putting out the cigarette in the ashtray I now held in my hand before picking up the other and repeating the process. ""Everyone has already seen what you got."" I beam while shimmying my shoulders.

Silence can be incredibly loud at times.

Jason has both knees on the mattress and walking over to him I notice that that makes us nearly the same height. It's strange looking level into the eyes of a man you're usually forced to look up to.

""Sam, listen to me."" He says with one hand securing his makeshift toga the other motioning up and down for me to be calm.

I take one last haul of my cigarette as I stand before him, butting it out before I expel the smoke into his face.

""You know what Jason?"" Barring my teeth. ""I don't think that I will."" I place my free hand on his bare shoulder. ""But take a look at my wife over there, I'm sure she'll buy whatever it is you're selling."" I gesture in her direction with my head. 

He turns to look at her and I seize the opportunity to bring the heavy ashtray down onto the back of his skull. 

A dull thud fills the air which is cut by the sharp screams of my wife.

His limp body falls forward into my waiting arms and I shift myself to the left dropping him to the floor. Humming now. 

""Sam please!"" Sandy pleads wide eyed and terrified. ""I'm sorry!""

""No you're not."" I wink at her as I throw a leg over Jason who lay on his back. ""At least-"" I say descending on top of him, sitting on my heels and watching as this handsome man looks up at me, eyes fluttering, waiting patiently as his disoriented mind makes the connection of what's to come. ""-not yet."" Smiling at him when it does.

""Please."" He whimpers as I hover the ashtray above my head.

The sound his skull makes when first struck with the marble, cracks so loudly that it reverberates off the walls. By the seventh or so, its muted to the sound of crunching leaves in autumn. By the seventeenth, just wet thumping which continues until the ashtray is too heavy to lift. 

""Oh God, what a rush!"" I yell while panting. My left eye twitching at the sting of one the stray drops of blood that speckles my face. 

My naked wife sobs in the background, trying to make herself as small as possible against the tufted headboard of the bed, trembling violently.

She gasps and pleads with me as I walk toward her. She continued to plead as I climbed on top of her. She pleaded at me with her eyes when my hands around her neck stifled her voice, making speech an impossibility.

When it's done and my wife lay dead, I fish around her purse to retrieve my car keys and I drive home in my black BMW as a symbol of my victory. Top down, breathing in the afternoon air aromatized with the scent of freshly mown lawns and hot pavement. I wave at the passerby's who cover the eyes of their children as they oggle the half naked man covered in blood. I flip Carol the finger as she stares at me through the blinds when I arrive and I light another cigarette as I close the door that was already left open of my house. A smile breaks at my lips as it dangles and I let out a sigh of happiness from the seat of my sofa.

That's when I wake up. Drenched in sweat, hands shaking at my remorseless ferocity. 

Though, that hasn't happened yet.

Four years straight of this exact dream and its never lasted this long. It always ends with the smile. Yet here I am on the sofa, cigarette long since butted out on my coffee table, waiting to wake up.

I write this to you now as blue and red lights fill my living room, casting sporadic shadows on the floor.

Waiting still.

If this post goes through, then I'm not asleep and I'm living a dream come true.

I can't help but laugh out loud at the irony of it all. It took me to think I was asleep to finally summon the courage to open my eyes.

I won't be going outside despite the man on the loud speaker demanding that I do so, with my hands on my head no less.

I'll end it myself. Because for the first time in my life, I am the master of my own destiny.

Free.

I laugh even harder at that.

Because who else could truly say that they've lived their wildest dreams.

1h89b57,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1h89b57/advice_about_a_friend_in_aa/,Advice about a friend in AA,"Hi I'm writing a post here because I'm not sure on how to get some advice about my friend in who is in the NA/AA program any other way, I could probably go to a meeting and ask my questions there but i don't think that would be the correct thing to do, given it is meant to be anonymous and I am not part of the program.

This will be quite a long story for context so if you read and offer any advice thankyou in advance.  

My best friend of ten years let's call him Jay had quite a substance abuse problem that worsened when he moved away from our home town to go work regionally. Jay was always quite a heavy drug user but once he moved away he also became quite a heavy drinker and his drug use worsened. While I had some idea Jay had a problem the full scope of his addiction came to light when he moved back home after his relationship with a long term girlfriend ended.

Once Jay was back at home and his problems came to light, I stopped drinking with him, I funnily enough stopped drinking all tgether, as he was really the only friend I had that would drink or take drugs. Myself and another one of his close friends tried our best to support him and help him get sober, but unfortunately I don't think we really knew how to help him other than offering support and encouragement. So when Jay decided he would try AA we were extremely supportive of that decision and offered to help in any way we could. 

After about 3 months in the AA program Jay came to me and said that he wanted to go-no contact for a bit and figure out who he was without alcohol or drugs (I'm pretty sure this idea came from his sponsor) and while that made me quite sad I accepted his descscion, gave him a huge hug and told him I would always be there for him and if that's what he needed to get sober then I would respect that and not contact him until he reached out to me.

Here's where things get tricky for me now, it has been over 7 months now since he said he was going no-contact. I have checked in with his parents multiple times and I know he is now 6 months sober. Jay has been my best friend for 10 years, he was the best man at my wedding and if I am being honest he saved my life, when I went though some really hard things in my early 20s he gave me the strength to pull through and I probably wouldn't be alive writing this post if it wasn't for him and I miss him terribly, more than I thought I ever would. 

I have asked someone else I know lets call him Jack who has been sober for 15 years because of AA and Jack suggested it could be because Jay views me as a trigger. Jay and I did have a lot of wild and crazy nights in our younger days, but since COVID occured they were pretty infrequent, and the bulk of our time was spent together going for walks, catching up for coffee and going to the gym. Getting drunk or taking drugs with Jay was a once in a 6 month occurrence. Once the true state of his addiction came out, taking drugs/drinking with him stopped altogether. I also know that when he had a few relapses, early days in AA Jay was really clear the reason he didn't call me to go out drinking with him or to get a score from was because I would say no. So clearly he knows I am 100% all in on his recovery.

So here's where my question lies. No matter what I will respect his request for me to not contact him, but I feel borderline depressed not having him in my life, I'm crying as I write this and I have to hope there is an end, where I get to see my sober amazing best friend again. I just want to know if being a trigger would be a deal breaker for someone in AA ? 

Is this something that Jay would likely be able to overcome ? 

Is there anything I could do to stop myself from being a trigger to him ? 

Do you think I will ever see my best friend again ?

Of course, this would not be a good plan for anyone with cardiovascular problems. 

We know caffeine makes PET worse, presumably through the diuretic effect (and I personally think increased GI motility as well). Also lowering the head helps through increasing blood pressure / volume in the head. 

It is often said to drink a lot of water - problem is a people urinates a lot of this out. My thought here is increased salt intake (potentially through commerically available capsules) might help. 

Drugs that help with orthostatic hypotension (dizzness when standing) theoretically might help as well (midodrine fludricortisone). 

My PET came back about a week ago (drank too much coffee) so looking to find a solution again. I know of the vitamin C in nasal spray trick (though have only tried the hypertonic saline with minimal benefit). Oral options for PET seem easier, if feasible.

I worked the day after the election, and I already knew people would be upset. 
I’m not exactly happy about it either, but also this is my place of work. 
I come in and a few people were crying. My manager told everyone to be professional and sensitive, but to just do our jobs and not talk about the election to customers. 
Of course, the other baristas couldn’t help themselves and were talking about the election, which I stayed out of. About an hour in, a customer came in with a MAGA hat on and decked out in American apparel (flag, eagle, etc.) 
My coworker, I’ll call her Janice, was at register and as this customer walked up, she left. Everyone else was busy, so I had to take this customers order. The customer tipped very well and was very kind. And once they left Janice came back and said “I just cannot serve those people”. 
I know that I was feeling annoyed, and so I probably should have just ignored her, but I felt like the only person working while everyone else was taking turns to go cry in the supply closet. 
I said “we are at work. This is your job and you can’t just refuse to serve people because they voted differently than you.” I didn’t raise my voice but I was firm and that seemed to upset her.
Janice basically said that it was an ethical thing. And I told her that she wouldn’t have been able to tell what political party a customer voted for if they hadn’t been decked out in MAGA gear. 
She then left and at the end of my shift, I was pulled into the break room with the other baristas. It felt like a freaking intervention. 
They said that I needed to be more sensitive to Janice because of the election and that I shouldn’t have yelled at her for being overwhelmed. 
I said that I didn’t yell at her. But we were busy and she can’t just leave without telling me. I was making two other drinks at the time and had to stop to take this customers order. 
They said that now Janice feels unsafe working here because she feels that I don’t support her. And that’s when I got really angry. 
I shouldn’t have to announce my political opinions to my coworkers because of their own issues with feeling supported. It is none of their business who I voted for. And the thing is, I didn’t even vote for Trump, but they don’t care about that. 
I told them that this was very inappropriate and that if Janice couldn’t handle being around people who vote differently than her then she shouldn’t work in customer service. 
Our manager came in and broke us up, I went home. 
My manager asked me to come in ten minutes before my next shift. We had a discussion about it. I apologized for how I phrased my last statement, but I felt antagonized by my coworkers for doing my job. She understood and said that the workplace is not a place to talk about political issues and I didn’t have to tell anyone who I voted for. I felt validated and good about everything. 
But now, a few weeks later, I’m being frozen out of my coworkers. They don’t talk to me unless it’s necessary. Somehow Janice has gotten other people to cover her shift if we were scheduled to work together.

I'm debating whether to choose Foxridge or Union. They are both the same price.  


**My Situation**

I’ll probably spend most of my time at home studying and job searching.  


**Foxridge**

Pros:

* Bigger space (1-bedroom)
* Lots of sunlight

Cons:

* First floor
* Noise issues due to thin walls (worst case: loud neighbors upstairs, especially at night)
* Far from campus, restaurants, and coffee shops (not walkable)



**Union**

Pros:

* Super close to Kroger and campus
* Walkable to most restaurants and coffee shops
* New facilities

Cons:

* Wi-Fi issues
* Lower floor (possibly no sunlight?) - though less important than noise issues
* Smaller space (studio)



**My Concerns (Noise level/ No car)**

Foxridge:

I’m worried about constant noise from neighbors, which would stress me out since I’ll be home most of the time. (I've seen some posts on reddit) I’m also concerned about feeling trapped without a car, as Foxridge isn’t walkable to places like downtown or University Mall.

Union:

Does Union still have Wi-Fi issues? How well can you hear your neighbors there? What’s it like living in a studio at Union?  


**Main Questions**

* How well can you hear your neighbors at Foxridge?
* How difficult is it to live at Foxridge without a car?
* How well can you hear your neighbors at Union?
* Has Union resolved its Wi-Fi problems?

Yesterday, I walked into a completely new coffee shop with only one worker (a homeless woman) and ordered a simple latte. But when the barista handed me my drink, I refused to tip her.

That’s right. I didn’t leave a single penny on the counter. And you know why? Because I’m sick of being guilt-tripped into tipping for subpar service.

The barista, who I’ll call “Emma,” looked at me with a mixture of shock and disgust. “You’re not going to tip me?” she asked.

I looked her straight in the eye and said, “No, Emma. I’m not going to tip you for a drink that took you 30 seconds to make. I’m not going to tip you for a smile that looked more like a scowl. And I’m not going to tip you for the privilege of being treated like a second-class citizen. I think you can go fuck yourself, all that money is going to your meth addiction.”

Emma looked like she’d been punched in the gut. She stuttered and stumbled, trying to come up with a response. But I just turned on my heel and walked out of the coffee shop, leaving her to ponder the error of her ways.

I know what you’re thinking: “But what about the poor barista who’s just trying to make a living?” Let me tell you, If Emma wants to make a living, she should try actually providing good service. She should try being friendly and attentive. And she should try making drinks that don’t taste like dishwater.

Until then, I’ll keep my tips to myself. And if you’re a barista who can’t handle a little bit of criticism, then maybe you’re in the wrong line of work.",1,1733511767.0,story,1,0.67,False

Me being an inexperienced idiot thought ""that won't take long to sort out"". It's worth mentioning I had virtually no DIY skills at all, as I'd rented forever.

This is just my sitting room, I've done heaps to the other rooms, most of which are almost complete. I paid a company to install my new bathroom, as it was clear I wouldn't be able to do that. I have had a heap of help off a family member, with painting and stripping wallpaper etc.

This room had an old fireplace (only for an electric fire), textured wallpaper on the walls and ceiling, dated switches and sockets, tacky light fitting, office blinds, knackered skirting qnd architraves, a cream carpet that has seen better days & broken coving that also had wallpaper on it.

I got a chippie in to hang my doors and a plumber to hang new radiators.

I completely stripped the room. Scrubbed, filled, sanded. Moved some sockets into the media unit, replaced all switches and sockets, fitted new flooring (laminate), fitted new skirting and architraves, fitted new coving, fitted the V-groove boards on to the wall, fitted the media unit, made some in-wall cable management for the tech, and bought and positioned everything. It's been challenging, I've learned loads and it's almost done and I really like it.

I do need to get a new sofa, as my current one is a corner sofa and I hate how the rug isn't dead centre under the media unit, but I'll look into that after Christmas. Also my wall art is a little too small, I'm gonna change those.

I still have a few bits to do, my coffee table comes soon and the mess on the floor is a puece of glass for the unit, that's getting exchanged. I'll probably also get a bigger soundbar as it looks a little lost with my new telly.

I've asked questions in here and it really has been amazing getting help and advice. I've lurked on posts and learned from them. This sub has made it all possible, and of course much of the other stuff I've done in other rooms. Thank you.",20,1733511739.0,DIYUK,6,1.0,False

====================================

""Secret of Fresh Breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

When you think about dental issues, an array of problems may come to mind: cavities, tooth decay, or perhaps gum disease. One of the less discussed but highly unpleasant outcomes of oral health neglect is bad breath. It's that nagging issue that can pop up unexpectedly and leave you feeling self-conscious in social situations. Now, when it comes to bad breath, a surprising culprit often lurks behind the scenes—periodontitis.

But you might wonder: does periodontitis cause bad breath? The answer isn’t straightforward, as it involves understanding both conditions. This article will dive deep into the connection between periodontitis and bad breath, unveiling the mechanisms that link these two issues together, and offering solutions to combat them. Grab your cup of coffee, settle in, and let’s explore this topic together.

Understanding Periodontitis: The Silent Foe
-------------------------------------------

Before we tackle the question, ""does periodontitis cause bad breath?"", let’s break down what periodontitis actually is.

### What Is Periodontitis?

Periodontitis is not just any dental condition; it’s a serious gum infection that damages the soft tissue and, if left untreated, can destroy the bone that supports your teeth. It’s more than a little annoyance—it’s a significant health concern. Think of it as that uninvited guest at a party who just won’t leave.

#### The Stages of Gum Disease

1. **Gingivitis**: This is the initial stage, marked by inflammation of the gums. They may appear swollen and bleed easily during brushing or flossing. The good news? Gingivitis can usually be reversed with good oral hygiene.
2. **Moderate Periodontitis**: If gingivitis remains unchecked, it progresses to moderate periodontitis. Here, the supporting bone begins to erode, and pockets form between your teeth and gums.
3. **Severe Periodontitis**: This is the last and most severe stage, where significant damage has occurred. Teeth may become loose and could even fall out.

### Signs and Symptoms of Periodontitis

Recognizing periodontitis early can be your best defense. Here are some common signs and symptoms:

- Persistent bad breath
- Red or swollen gums
- Gum recession
- Loose teeth
- Changes in bite

Understanding these symptoms is crucial for your health; once you spot them, don’t hesitate to reach out to your dentist!

The Link Between Periodontitis and Bad Breath
---------------------------------------------

Now, let’s connect the dots—does periodontitis cause bad breath? Spoiler alert: it sure can! The relationship between these two conditions is significant and often underappreciated.

### How Does Periodontitis Contribute to Bad Breath?

Bad breath, or halitosis, often stems from bacteria lurking in your mouth. When you have periodontitis, the support structures of your teeth and gums are compromised, allowing those villainous bacteria to flourish.

#### Bacterial Growth and Accumulation

Bacteria thrive in the warm, moist environment of your mouth. With periodontitis, the inflammation causes pockets to form between your gums and teeth, where bacteria accumulate. These bacteria produce sulfur compounds as they digest food particles and organic matter, leading to foul odors.

### Additional Factors Worsening Bad Breath

While periodontitis is a prime suspect, several other factors could worsen the situation:

- **Poor Oral Hygiene**: Not brushing and flossing regularly allows plaque buildup.
- **Diet**: Foods like garlic and onions can contribute to temporary bad breath.
- **Dehydration**: A dry mouth reduces saliva, which helps neutralize odors.
- **Smoking**: Tobacco products not only stain teeth but also contribute to bad breath.

So, it's safe to say that if you've got periodontitis, the odds are stacked against your breath!

Bad Breath in Different Stages of Periodontitis
-----------------------------------------------

As previously mentioned, periodontitis progresses through stages. You might be wondering: does the severity of periodontitis affect the degree of bad breath? Absolutely!

### Gingivitis vs. Moderate and Severe Periodontitis

- **Gingivitis**: While it can cause some bad breath, it is typically mild and more manageable with good oral hygiene.
- **Moderate Periodontitis**: At this stage, the bad breath may intensify due to increased bacterial proliferation and gum inflammation.
- **Severe Periodontitis**: Here, the situation takes a nosedive. The buildup of bacteria and toxins leads to noticeably foul breath that can be quite persistent.

Combatting Bad Breath Linked to Periodontitis
---------------------------------------------

Feeling overwhelmed? Don’t fret! There are many ways to tackle bad breath associated with periodontitis while improving your overall oral health.

### Improve Your Oral Hygiene Routine

A robust oral hygiene routine can do wonders:

1. **Brush Twice a Day**: Use fluoride toothpaste and a soft-bristled toothbrush. Spend at least two minutes each time brushing.
2. **Floss Daily**: Flossing removes food particles and plaque between teeth that a toothbrush can’t reach.
3. **Use Mouthwash**: An antibacterial mouthwash can help reduce bacteria and freshen breath.

### Regular Dental Check-Ups

Regular visits to your dentist are crucial for preventing and managing periodontitis:

- Schedule cleanings every six months.
- Get check-ups to monitor gum health.
- Don’t hesitate to ask your dentist about specific treatments for bad breath.

### Maintain a Healthy Diet

What you eat plays a significant role in your oral health:

- **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to keep your mouth moist and help wash away food particles.
- **Limit Sugary Foods**: Sugar feeds bacteria, so try to cut back on sweets.
- **Include Crunchy Fruits and Vegetables**: Apples and carrots can naturally scrub your teeth while you chew.

### Quitting Smoking

If you’re a smoker, quitting could dramatically improve your breath.

- Seek support through various programs or consider nicotine replacement therapies.

Home Remedies for Bad Breath
----------------------------

Sometimes, a few home remedies can provide quick relief from bad breath caused by periodontitis. Here’s a list of tried-and-true methods:

1. **Chew Sugar-Free Gum**: This stimulates saliva production and keeps your mouth moist.
2. **Use Baking Soda**: Brushing with baking soda can help neutralize odors.
3. **Apple Cider Vinegar**: Dilute a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water and rinse your mouth. It may help balance pH levels.
4. **Parsley Chewing**: This herb can temporarily mask bad breath due to its chlorophyll content.
5. **Essential Oils**: Peppermint or tea tree oil diluted in water can serve as a refreshing mouth rinse.

Myths About Periodontitis and Bad Breath
----------------------------------------

Before we wrap things up, let's debunk some common myths concerning periodontitis and its connection to bad breath.

### Myth 1: Only Poor Oral Hygiene Causes Bad Breath

While poor hygiene is a significant factor, periodontitis is often overlooked as a leading cause. It can happen to anyone, even those who brush and floss diligently.

### Myth 2: Bad Breath Is Just a Minor Issue

Think again! Persistent bad breath can be a sign of underlying health problems, including periodontitis or other systemic diseases.

### Myth 3: Mouthwash Can Replace Brushing and Flossing

Although mouthwash can help freshen breath temporarily, it doesn’t replace the need for brushing and flossing.

Conclusion: Staying Ahead of Bad Breath
---------------------------------------

""Secret of Fresh Breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

In conclusion, there’s a strong connection between periodontitis and bad breath. This duo can create a vicious cycle that's hard to break. However, maintaining excellent oral hygiene, seeking regular dental care, and addressing any gum issues promptly can help you breathe easier. So, the next time you find yourself in a situation where bad breath rears its ugly head, remember that understanding the root cause is half the battle!

By being proactive and taking charge of your oral health, you can keep that pesky bad breath at bay and enjoy a confident smile. If you suspect you have periodontitis, don’t wait around—book that dental appointment today! After all, nobody wants to be remembered for their less-than-fresh breath.

I was in clerkship when I tried dating app having the thought of hard to find love life inresidency. I was really afraid at first, since I grew up in a conservative family who doesn’t believe in online dating (parents who instilled studies first) and the fact that there were many guys who were there for lust.

I usually swipe with those in gradschool and luckily I matched with a clerk. As an NBSB, I was straightforward that I’m against pre-marital sex. I felt it cringe before when he send pick-up lines or talking about cuddles which I had open up to him and he felt sorry if he had been too fast and he had said he’d really wanted to know me better and won’t do the same thing again and would understand and respect me.

We had first date/coffee date five days after we matched, where he travelled all the way from his clerkship duty in Valenzuela to Marikina. He was consistently chatting me, we even had virtual reviews after we got home from our duties. I gave it a chance and took the risk. I wasn’t sure if that was love bomb as he felt like his very sure of me, seeing he wanted to introduce me to his family, talks about future with me, to have with kids, to review boards with him and go with same hospital with me for internship. 

After few weeks, I got a confidence to finally introduce him to my parents asking for permission. On our day offs, he had to travel hour/s just to study with me. He coached me what to do as I was afraid scrubbing in. I really felt that we would be good together. After 2 months of dating, things didn’t go along as planned. He would be the right person for me it’s just the wrong time. I really felt sorry when he didn’t graduate on time with me. I knew it was hard to accept especially when he courted me he made a promise to my parents that our priority was to be licensed doctors. I gave him space and time to heal but I haven’t seen along that we were slowly losing our bond. I lost in touch as I was having mental health issues in my PGIship. 

I’m sorry if I haven’t love you the way you did. I was confused and I don’t want to play around with your feelings; committing just because of boredom or  out of choice that's why I wanted to know us better. I’ve been harsh to the both of us as there’s already part of me liking you but I really didn’t knew what was holding back, maybe the time where both of us were tested. We had a great relationship and connection but I was immature, I was not the right one for you, I’m really sorry. 

Thank you for showing genuinely the love and care that I don’t deserve; for letting me feel that someone truly cares for me, cheering me up, keeping me feel safe and comfortable, and treating me like a princess. You've been one of my inspirations to achieve this MD dream. Maybe someday, we’ll meet again. I’m praying for your success and of your heart. I’m always proud of you Doc MJ!

I am also the caretaker for my 88 year old father. With a lot of support, he can live alone. I have hired a cleaning and lawn service. I do all his cooking, shopping, pay the bills, take him to med appts, get him to social things, etc. I have a brother who does nothing. 

  
Now we are in the holidays. I have to host Thanksgiving - at his house because he has mobility challenges, which is a lot harder than doing it at your own house. I have to host Xmas - at his house, same thing. Relatives insisted they wanted to visit him, so now I have to cook and clean for a fancy lunch at his place tomorrow. I have to do the Xmas shopping and wrapping and all the prep and put up his tree, and of course he wants Xmas cookies too. My brother has medical conditions and is unemployed, so there is a lot of expectation there that I financially support them and provide other benefits. My sister tries to help, but she has to have a major surgery next week and there's no one else to take care of her. So I have to step up there too.

  
In the meantime, my dad keeps falling prey to salesmen. First it was one of those ""let me inspect your roof for storm damage."" Now its major changes to his phones and communication tools. Both of which end up on my shoulders to fix when it goes wrong because he's 88 and doesn't think so clearly anymore. I hate those sleazy salesmen with the fiery hot passion of a thousand suns.

  
I'm tired and frustrated and burned out and resentful. I miss having a life. I miss being able to meet a friend for a cup of coffee or go on vacation. I miss feeling like my own life mattered. I hate feeling resentful. I keep trying to be in the moment, knowing dad won't be here forever. I keep trying to focus on giving him the best life possible. I know you are doing the same thing for your LO.

  
The holidays just add so much extra burden on everyone. I know all of you reading this are or have been in the same situation. So please know that I see you. I see how much you are doing for others. I see how much you are giving up in your own life to give them a good life. I know how invisible your labors are to everyone else who find it so convenient not to see it.  You are doing a good thing, a huge act of love. You act with grace in a situation you wouldn't be in if the world was a fairer, kinder place. I wish I could give you a Christmas present you didn't have to buy yourself. I wish I could give you a quiet night with no worry. I hope your LO sits up one day and notices all you do, and thanks you. I hope your family suddenly step up to support you. But if they don't, we thank you. We know how hard you work and how much you do, and how you are holding the family and the world together for you LO.

1h88kke,https://www.reddit.com/r/readbeforebuying/comments/1h88kke/blazingfast_anker_nebula_capsule_max_review_best/,Blazing-fast: Anker Nebula Capsule Max Review - Best Portable Projector?,"# 

Looking for a portable projector that packs a punch? I recently got my hands on the Nebula Capsule Max, and I'm impressed with what this little device can do.

This compact projector from Anker offers a 720p HD image up to 100 inches in size. I found the 200 ANSI lumens brightness works well in dim settings, making it great for movie nights at home or outdoor viewing. The built-in 8W speaker surprised me with its sound quality, and the 4-hour video playtime means I can watch a full movie without needing to plug it in.

https://preview.redd.it/nhiwz7dsx95e1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d75fd796676c9e8774523d5978a6b4ed96861b7

I like that it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, letting me easily stream content or use it as a speaker. The autofocus and keystone correction make setup a breeze. It runs on Android, so I can download apps like Netflix and YouTube directly to the projector.

It's not perfect though. The 720p resolution isn't the sharpest, and it struggles in bright rooms. The price is also a bit high for what you get.

# Bottom Line

The Nebula Capsule Max is a solid choice if you want a portable projector for casual viewing. Its compact size and built-in features make it versatile for different settings.



# Overview of the NEBULA by Anker Capsule Max

I recently got my hands on the Capsule Max, and I'm impressed with its portability. This mini projector packs a punch for its size. It projects a 720p HD image up to 100 inches, which looks great in dim rooms. The 200 ANSI lumens brightness works well for movie nights, but it's not ideal for daytime use.

I like the autofocus feature - it adjusts the image quickly when I move the projector. The built-in 8W speaker sounds surprisingly good for such a small device. Battery life is solid too, lasting about 4 hours of video playback.

The Android-based interface lets me download streaming apps directly. Netflix works, but I can't mirror it from my phone. The remote control is handy, and there's also a smartphone app for easier navigation.

While it's not perfect for bright rooms, the Capsule Max shines as a portable entertainment option for camping trips or backyard movie nights. Its compact size and decent performance make it a fun gadget for on-the-go viewing.

# Cutting-Edge HD Viewing Experience

I was impressed by the Capsule Max's image quality. It projects a sharp 720p picture up to 100 inches wide. The 200 ANSI lumens are bright enough for dim rooms. I liked how clear movies looked, even when I made the image big. The DLP tech gives nice colors too.

The autofocus worked fast when I moved the projector. It fixed the image shape quickly with keystoning. This made setup easy.

The picture looks best in dark spaces. It's not meant for daytime use outside. But for movie nights at home or camping trips, it works great. I enjoyed watching shows on a big screen without needing a TV.

# Autofocus and Keystoning for Instant Clarity

I was impressed by how quickly this projector adjusted the image. The one-second autofocus worked like a charm, giving me a sharp picture almost instantly. I didn't have to fiddle with manual focus controls at all. The automatic keystoning was a lifesaver too. I could set up the Capsule Max at different angles, and it still produced a perfectly rectangular image. This made it easy to use in various spots around my home. Whether I put it on a coffee table or mounted it on a tripod, the picture looked great. These features really helped me get watching faster without any hassle.

# Versatility Inside Your Home

I found the Capsule Max to be a handy little device for various uses around my house. It's great for movie nights in the living room, projecting a big 100-inch picture on the wall. I also used it in the bedroom to watch shows before bed. The portability came in handy when I wanted to move it to different rooms. I even set it up in the kitchen to follow cooking videos while making dinner. The built-in speaker was good enough that I didn't need to connect external audio. One drawback is that it works best in darker rooms, so daytime viewing wasn't ideal. Still, I liked how easy it was to take this projector from room to room for different activities.

# Built-In Smart OS for Streaming

I found the smart OS on this mini projector really handy. It lets me download apps like YouTube and Netflix right to the device. I can stream shows and movies without needing to connect another device. The Nebula Manager Store has a good selection of apps. I like using the Nebula Connect app on my phone as a remote to control Netflix on the projector. It's pretty easy to navigate. Just keep in mind you can't mirror or screencast copyrighted content from streaming services - you need to use the built-in apps instead. Overall the smart features work well, but the app selection is somewhat limited compared to a full streaming device.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using this compact projector for a while now, and it's been an interesting experience. Here's what I've found:

# Pros

* Portability: The Capsule Max is incredibly easy to carry around. I've taken it on trips and to friends' houses without any hassle.
* Picture quality: For its size, the 720p HD image is quite impressive. I've enjoyed watching movies on a 100-inch screen.
* Built-in apps: Having Netflix and YouTube right on the device is handy. I don't always need to connect other devices.
* Sound: The 8W speaker packs a punch. I rarely feel the need for external speakers.
* Battery life: With 4 hours of video playback, it's perfect for a movie night without needing a power outlet.

# Cons

* Brightness: At 200 ANSI lumens, it struggles in bright rooms. I've found it works best in dim or dark settings.
* Price: It's not cheap, especially for 720p resolution. I'd suggest looking for a sale.
* App limitations: Some streaming apps don't work well or aren't available. I sometimes need to use workarounds.
* Not Full HD: While 720p looks good, I do miss having 1080p resolution for some content.

In my experience, the Capsule Max shines in specific situations but isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. It's great for portable use, but might not replace a main TV or home theater setup.

# Customer Reviews

I've checked out what buyers are saying about the Nebula Capsule Max. Many people love this tiny projector for its portability and ease of use. It's great for outdoor movie nights and camping trips. The built-in apps like Netflix and YouTube are a nice bonus. Sound quality from the 8W speaker surprised quite a few users.

On the downside, some felt it was pricey for 720p resolution. The 200 lumens brightness works well in dark rooms but struggles in daylight. A few wished they'd spent more on a higher-end model.

Overall, most reviewers seem happy with their purchase, especially those who got it on sale. It's not perfect, but the Capsule Max offers a good mix of features for casual movie watching on the go.

# Ease of Portability and Setup

I found the Capsule Max to be incredibly easy to carry and set up. Its compact size and lightweight design (just 1.6 pounds) make it a breeze to move around. I can toss it in my bag and take it anywhere.

Setting up the projector is quick and simple. I just turn it on, and it automatically focuses in about a second. The auto-keystone feature helps get a straight image even when the projector isn't perfectly aligned.

One small issue is the throw distance. I need at least 40 feet of space to get the full 100-inch picture. But for most rooms, this isn't a problem.

The built-in battery lasts about 4 hours, which is great for movie nights without needing to plug in. Overall, the portability and setup of this little projector really impressed me.

# Battery Life and Charging Efficiency

I was impressed by the Capsule Max's battery performance. It lasted about 4 hours on a single charge, which was perfect for watching a couple of movies. The projector charged up quickly too - I plugged it in for about 2.5 hours and it was ready to go. One small issue is that the battery drains faster at higher brightness settings. I found using it at 50-60% brightness gave me the best balance of picture quality and battery life. The USB-C charging port is convenient, letting me use the same cable as my phone. Overall, the Capsule Max's battery life met my needs for portable movie nights.

# Audio Performance

I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality from the Capsule Max's 8W speaker. It packs a punch for such a small device. The audio is clear and loud enough to fill a room. Bass is decent, though not earth-shaking. For movies and TV shows, dialogue comes through crisp and easy to understand. Music playback is enjoyable too, with good clarity across different genres.

While it can't match dedicated home theater speakers, the built-in audio is more than adequate for most portable viewing situations. I found it works great for outdoor movie nights or camping trips. The projector can also connect to external speakers via Bluetooth or the aux port if you want to boost the sound even more.

# Conclusion

I've found the Capsule Max to be a solid portable projector for casual movie nights and outdoor viewing. Its compact size and built-in battery make it easy to take anywhere. The picture quality is decent for 720p, though not as sharp as full HD projectors. The 200 ANSI lumens are enough for dark rooms but struggle in brighter settings.

The built-in apps and wireless connectivity are convenient, but the interface can be sluggish at times. Sound quality from the 8W speaker is surprisingly good for its size. Battery life is adequate for most movies.

While pricier than some competitors, the Capsule Max offers a good balance of portability and performance. It's a fun gadget for impromptu movie nights, camping trips, or backyard viewing. Just keep expectations realistic for brightness and resolution at this size and price point.",1,1733510864.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

They have completely ignored both BF and myself (including my message that if they really wanted to we could go get them set up for a drivers test), and more or less have avoided us both as well. Which is fine I guess, if a little awkward since we share a house with one bathroom. 

I’m off from work today and sib came in getting ready for their job. I attempted an olive branch and asked if they wanted a ride or coffee or something on the way. Sib said “it’s okay” and proceeded to pretend like I wasn’t there and left. (Again, I did apologize when I realized how bad my comment upset them when this whole thing started). So I guess that’s kinda that as far as our relationship goes for now. 

Not sure why sib is also treating my boyfriend to silence other than I guess sib assumes he’s in my “camp” he really didn’t do anything other than witness the comment being made and subsequent blow up. Sib also apparently has avoided paying rent so far this month (it’s boyfriend’s house so we pay him) so this might get more awkward yet.

Before you ask, he is a good sport and LOVES being center of attention. He will love being roasted. 

  
Some non specific/non inside joke things about him...

 Talks a lot and loudly

 Is an Apple freak... he can fix any apple product that has ever existed. He doesn't work at Apple but enjoys their products/fixing them. 

Is an actual Rocket Scientist that works on satellites

Loves bags- mostly travel bags/work bags, jackets (think outdoor recreation and how many types and layers of jackets there are), and travel cups.... like travel coffee mugs and water bottles

Has lost most of his hair and is very much bald but has it cut super short. I find it funny that he goes to a barber and doesn't just shave it.

He drives very fast and borderline aggressive. He will be sure to get you wherever you are going on time and is proud to say it! You may get whiplash along the way or need to hold on for your life..... but you'll get there! 

He enjoys skiing... FAST.

He LOVES technology, has every cord imaginable for anything, and saves old computer/speakers/games/music equipment/etc. He's very proud to pull out things when others need help fixing or charging something that is hard to find. 

Has the biggest heart. He's the type of person who you can call any time of night and he will be there to help in a heart beat. 

Is on the shorter side for a man- 5'7"". His younger brother is over 6 foot and he has always been a bit jealous.  He is sensitive to this but can joke about it.... so nothing too harsh. 

You can always count on a long text message in response to just about anything with full detail! Even if it doesn't need to be. 

He will always insist on driving. It's rare that you'll see him in a vehicle with someone else driving. 



That should be good for now.

My perspective of looking into the reflection of me changed when I finally learnt accept myself. I discovered why do we get acne, browsed and read a lot of articles, and educated myself to the fact that I don't even care if I lose people.
But throughout this journey, the most important thing I learnt was to take care of yourself internally..i.e sleeping well, drinking enough water, balancing your diet,,(ik y'all have heard this a lot) but trust me, the real glow and confidence comes when you actually do it for yourself and not to impress people.

I've been on a health journey lately and decided to invest in a high-quality blender. After months of research and actually testing different models, I wanted to share my experience about choosing the right Vitamix blender.

I know many of you have been asking about Vitamix blenders, and honestly, I was just as confused when I started looking into them. These machines aren't cheap, so it's important to make the right choice.

Let me break down the main options:

The Vitamix 5200 is what I'd call the classic workhorse. It's been around forever and there's a reason for that. The tall container is perfect for making large batches of smoothies, and it absolutely demolishes ice and frozen fruit. I was amazed at how smooth my morning smoothies became - no chunks, no bits of kale, just perfectly blended goodness.

If counter space is an issue (like it was for me), you might want to check out the Vitamix E310 Explorian. It's more compact but still packs a punch. You can find both models here: https://athometouch.com/vitamixblender

The Pro 750 is like the luxury car of blenders - it's got preset programs and is significantly quieter. But honestly, unless you're running a small cafe or have money to burn, it might be overkill.

What really surprised me was the A3500 Ascent Series. The smart features and touchscreen are cool, but what sold me was the self-detect containers and how it adjusts blending times automatically. I actually ended up getting this one after trying my friend's.

One thing I wish someone had told me earlier: don't get too caught up in the horsepower numbers. What matters more is how well the blender performs daily tasks. All Vitamix blenders are powerful enough to handle whatever you throw at them.

For beginners, I'd recommend starting with either the E310 or the 5200. They're more affordable but still give you that legendary Vitamix quality. You can compare prices and features here: https://athometouch.com/vitamixblender

The warranty is pretty impressive too - most models come with a 7-10 year warranty, which really shows how confident they are in their products.

I know this is a big purchase, but after using mine daily for everything from smoothies to hot soups (yes, it actually heats soup!), homemade nut butters, and even grinding coffee beans, I can say it's worth every penny. The build quality is insane compared to the cheaper blenders I've owned.

Feel free to ask any specific questions - I'd be happy to share more details about my experience with different models!",1,1733510165.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

A sketch of ancient Athens

A woman's egg joins with a man's sperm.  Conception. Following the act of thrusting a penis inside a vagina - for pleasure, reproduction, or something you let happen because it’s the only time he touched you all night. When someone you love offers a bid for connection you say yes every time. The crying and screaming stop for a while and you are able to pretend he’s not leaving in a few hours, maybe minutes if he feels like it.    
If it means I get to be near you. I just want to be near you. Why would you feel alright having sex with someone whose heart you just ripped apart. Why am I under you when an hour ago, I wasn’t allowed to sit beside you on the couch. Don’t think about that now. Try to enjoy it.    
   
Three weeks later, my usually very regular period still hasn’t arrived.    
The fear to find myself accidentally pregnant a constant companion since my debut at fifteen. Recurring nightmares about suddenly realizing I’m nine months in, my belly is huge, and it’s too late to go back. The relief upon waking and being so careful, every month welcoming the cramps and nausea.    
   
I remember the last time I found myself in this situation. A few hours after my grandmother's memorial service and coffee with Finnish relatives I did not know, I walked through muddy brown snow to the pharmacy.    
Twenty-three years old, sore breasts and four years into our relationship, with not a hint of a desire for being a parent from either of us. The strange comfort in it.   
My precious grandmother's fragile body, her soft hands and white curls, would soon be scorched to ashes and all the while something could have begun to form - something I never asked for but still was. In that fact was a threat, the universe forcing me to acknowledge that life moves on relentlessly, without mine or anyone else's permission. That same evening, just like every month before, my period started.    
   
This familiar worry combined with my current situation even more unfavourable.    
I’m getting ahead of events as I picture myself in a sterile room sitting across a midwife with a kind face. ""Is anyone forcing or pressuring you into having this abortion?"" she would routinely have to ask. Yes, my ex. He would hate me forever. And I’d hate this child forever. Or become obsessed with it, precisely because it’s ours, and in that way binds us to each other for the rest of our lives. A valid reason, a convoluted and ridiculous excuse to see him again.    
Maybe I still have one of his books I could return, the one about a boy in 1500’s Japan. We would talk about going there, or maybe to Greece.     
   
“My colleague has a house we can rent,” he’d say after a few beers in the quiet of the closed pub where he worked. His voice soft and sure and I imagined us in Naxos or Athens, petting stray kittens in tight alleyways. Somehow it always felt distant, more like a story we were telling each other than a plan we were actually making. Dreams that were meant to stay dreams is what’s left now. A decade worth of memories and a hardcover copy of “Across the Nightingale Floor”.    
   
The same night my test is expected to arrive with the morning mail, I’m awakened by pain. I’m wet, warm and nauseous as I shiver and sweat simultaneously. My underwear and sheets are soaked dark red. There’s a dull ache in my lower back. The sounds of traffic outside my window as I lie still in my blood, thinking about a baby I never wanted.   
   
The word conception has several meanings.    
One of them is fertilization. A woman's egg joins with a man's sperm.    
   
Another is a notion, a concept, of something not actually existing.    
Like an artist’s sketch of ancient Athens. Like an embryo growing inside my uterus.   
Like a future with him in it.

He always apologizes and it gets better for a bit but he falls back into it eventually. 

Today he is off work so I messaged him at 8am saying I would pick us up pizza for dinner on my way home so let me know what he wants. He opened it but didn’t respond. Sent another message a bit after asking if he could clean the kitchen and he still hasn’t opened it at 12:30.

Maybe I’m just in a petty mood but I’ve decided I will send him one final message on my last coffee break (something like “guess you don’t want pizza then”) and see if he sees it. If not I’m not getting him pizza and he can cook his own dinner tonight. I think he needs to see that doing this will have consequences from now on. I feel like maybe its an asshole thing to do in some way though? He wont be mad or anything because he’s VERY aware that this is a problem but I also dont want him to feel like I’m punishing him for his ADHD because again, I know he cant help it to a point but now its starting to feel neglectful.

\-- Traditional celebrations of Saint Nicholas Day in Northern Europe included gifts left in children's shoes (the origin of our American Christmas stockings). Good children receive treats - candies, cookies, apples, and nuts, while naughty children receive switches or lumps of coal. Sometimes coins were left in the shoes, reminiscent of the life-saving dowries the saint provided. Today - especially in families of German extraction - children still put a shoe outside their bedroom doors on the eve of Saint Nicholas Day and expect to find candy and coins or small gifts in their shoes on December 6th.

I haven't spoken to many folks but every single person I did told me I needed a sponsor.

The first time we met at a coffee shop and he had the book out and was showing me some videos about AA at max volume on his phone and talking loud. I finally said I was starting to get uneasy with the whole coffee shop knowing so we went for a walk.

A week later we met cause he got a book for me and we were starting to read it together. In a different coffee shop again he started talking about the program and AA with everybody around, then we were sitting on a bench with our giant books out like bibles lol and finally I asked to move to a bench further from people. I couldn't focus on what we were doing when I was low-level stressed about everyone around.

Later the same night I \_really\_ wanted a drink, like the first time I was about to go to the liquor store since days 28/29. I realized I was actually super stressed about the morning and maybe (gasp!) I had identified a red flag. So I texted with him to ask if we could keep the AA part of our relationship private, since I needed anonymity right now to keep from losing control.

He texted back that he doesn't ""do secrets"" and to find another sponsor.

I know each one is different, but am I trippin to think that asking for privacy or discretion is not normal? I mean, anonymous is in the name after all.

Throwaway account because this is wild, and I honestly don't know if I’m a horrible person or just made things work out the way they were meant to be.

When I (28F) was 19, it was my freshman year of university. I’d taken a gap year to work as an au pair in Japan, so I started a bit later than most of my peers. I didn’t have many friends until I met Jessi (19F), and we instantly clicked. She became my go-to friend, and one day, she invited me to her birthday party—a small gathering with close friends.

That’s when I met Kylin (27M). He was older, gorgeous, and had this presence about him that left me awestruck. But he wasn’t single—he was in a serious, two-year relationship with Niah (25F). Jessi noticed my instant crush on him but told me it was pointless to even think about because Kylin and Niah were rock-solid.

I didn’t care.

At the party, I talked to both Kylin and Niah, trying to get a feel for who she was and what their relationship was like. I got both of their Instagrams and started keeping tabs on them, stalking every move they made. I wasn’t looking for anything specific—just one slip-up on Niah’s part that I could use to my advantage.


That’s when I noticed something—Niah had a tendency to overdo it with alcohol when she went out. It wasn’t extreme, but it was enough for me to see an opportunity. I realized that if I could create a scenario where she made a mistake while drunk, I could push Kylin to see her in a different light.

One night, I invited Jessi and Niah out for drinks, pretending it was just a casual girls’ night. While we were out, I slipped something into Niah’s drink—not enough to harm her but enough to make her act out of character. There was a guy at the bar who had been eyeing her all night, so I encouraged her to talk to him while I ""documented the fun."" I purposefully filmed myself having a good time, making sure Niah was in the background talking to the guy, looking a little too friendly.

The next day, Kylin saw the video. They broke up.

It was messy. Niah didn’t remember much from that night and thought the situation was just a mistake on her part. She didn’t blame me for anything, assuming I had accidentally caught her on camera. She took the breakup hard but accepted that it was ""her fault.""

That’s when I stepped in.

I started comforting Kylin, being there for him as a shoulder to cry on. We bonded over coffee dates and deep conversations about his feelings. He helped me with my major (he did the same major as I was) and I took things slow, knowing he needed time to heal. Months passed, and one day, while we were eating at In-N-Out—of all places—he kissed me. It was cheesy, but it was perfect.

We started dating, and over time, things got serious. Niah eventually moved abroad for work, and we lost contact with her completely. Three years later, Kylin proposed. Now, we’re married, and I’m 20 weeks pregnant with our baby girl.

Here’s where I’m conflicted: I love Kylin with everything I have. He’s the perfect man—kind, hardworking, and everything I ever wanted. But I can’t shake the guilt of how we started. I manipulated things to get him, and while I’d do it all over again because I love him but, I do wonder if I crossed a line too far.

So, AITA for how I got my husband? Or did I just do what I needed to push fate to secure my happiness?

Ordinarily, I notice they start with the sexting and dick pics almost immediately so they get filtered out quickly. However, last week I started talking to a new man from AM and there actually seems to be potential. He lives relatively nearby, schedules align, is reasonably attractive, and the conversation has been refreshingly nice, even had a nice video chat. We are scheduled to meet for a quick coffee next week.

However, this morning I woke up to a couple zoomed in dick pics :( he even said he'd ""be more than glad to send a video as well"".. lmaoo. So I told him he was doing so good until now. He said ""sorry, it's been awhile"". Tells me he hasn't had sex in months, DB with wife. Still, doesn't justify.

Unless a man has a legitimate micropenis or is exotically deformed in a way in which a woman would like to know about beforehand, I have no interest in seeing a stranger's penis, let it be a surprise.

So I'm debating now not even meeting, wondering if I \*should\* have the ick. Advice? Would you still go thru with meeting him?

The British Imperialism in India had its roots in the 1600s. During that period, the East India Company had started setting up its trading offices at different port cities like Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras.

The main intention was to trade in spices. Moreover, owing to the worldwide industrial revolution, Britain had become the centre-stage of development. “As a blanket term the Industrial Revolution explains little about British expansion in general at the end of the eighteenth century.” (Marshal 1985). India was very important to Britain due to the fact that for the procurement of raw material for its industries, it had to depend on India.

India was considered as “a Jewel in the Crown’. Also, India was a huge end user of British products. “The most obvious grounds for doubting the significance of manufacturing as a force behind British imperialism are provided by the course of events in India, the main field of conquest during the period in question…” (Ward 1994)

The Mughal dynasty was at its peak during that era. As such, East India Company traders were under the vigil of the Mughal officials. However, by the initial years of the 1700s, the Mughal Empire started experiencing a downfall. Taking advantage of this situation, many erstwhile small states, breaking away from the Mughal rule, parted ways and formed their own rule.

The East India Company also took advantage of this state of affairs and started chalking out plans to invade India. The Indian rulers got the indication from its sources and asked for help from the French, who also had some base in India. Finally, it was in 1757 that Robert Clive defeated the Indian & French allied forces in the Battle of Plassey. Over the years, there was an increase in the regions controlled by East India Company.

The East India Company’s power was supreme until 1858. The British government had an authoritative control over the workings of the East India Company directly or indirectly. But the British government did not interfere in the daily functioning of the East India Company. The East India Company had its own army and controlled India until the beginning of the nineteenth century.

Several restrictions were imposed on the Indians. The Indian economy came under the British government. Indian farmers were forced to produce raw material for the British industries and the Indians were supposed to buy only British goods. The raw material included indigo (a dye), jute, coffee, cotton, and tea.

One of the major plantations done in India was that of opium. Opium was sold to china and tea was purchased that was further sold in Britain. No one could start a business that competed with the British goods. For instance, the Indian handloom industry suffered a major setback due to the introduction of readymade clothes collection from Britain that was good in quality as well as economical.

There were certain factors that made Indian goods crucial for Britain. The Crimean War of 1850 restricted the supply of jute from Russia to Scotland. As a result, Bengal jute was much in demand. Similarly, the American Civil War restricted the supply of cotton to Britain. In order to keep the British textile mills running Indian cotton became very precious for Britain.

In order to ease the transportation of raw material from the remote areas to the ports and finished goods from the ports to various destinations in India, the British government started the railway network.

## What Was India’s Response to European Imperialism?

By the year 1850, most of the Indian subcontinent was under the control of the British East India Company. During the years, a sense and feeling of disgruntlement started developing within various Indian factions. The people were frustrated because the British had controlled their lands. Moreover, the British were even trying to convert the natives to Christianity.

There was also a mass grudge against the racism that was being meted out towards them by the British. The situation became aggravated when word spread that the bullets/cartridges of the new Enfield rifles, which were being used by the sepoys, were lubricated with beef and pork fat.

The practical point behind this was that the religious beliefs of the two major sects in India, the Hindus and the Muslims, were impeded upon by the use of such cartridges. The Hindus consider cow sacred and the Muslims do not eat pork. The problem was that in order to use the cartridges, the sepoys had to cut off the ends with their teeth. This outraged both the communities.

In one of the instances, on 9 May 1857, 85 out of the 90 sepoys of a garrison refused to use the cartridges. Instead of dealing the matter in a diplomatic manner, the Garrison Commander jailed all the sepoys who had disobeyed. The next day i.e. 10 May 1857, when soldiers rebelled and marched to Delhi, proved to be a shot in the arm for the mutiny.

These soldiers connected with other Indian soldiers who were based in Delhi. The city of Delhi was captured and the upheaval further stretched to the northern and central parts of India. The fierce fighting continued for about a year after which the East India Company suppressed the mutiny with the help of British troops.

This mutiny is termed as the ‘Sepoy Mutiny’ and it was a turning point in Indian and British history. There were some very significant results of this mutiny. Firstly, after this mutiny, the British Government took direct control of all the affairs in India. Secondly, there was a split between the Hindus and the Muslims. Thirdly, the Sikhs became the favourite of the British. And lastly, this mutiny stimulated the racist attitude of the British.

## Negative and Positive Effects of British Imperialism in India

British Imperialism had a large impact on India during the nineteenth century because the British modernized and industrialized India, many economic declines were caused in India due to the lack of financial benefits from the British rule, and Indians gained a sense of nationalism after the British took control over India’s government and people.

There were both negative and positive impacts on India.

Negative impacts:

Positive impacts:

## How Was India Affected by Imperialism?

The British colonialism had great impacts on India. The British intended to make English as a local language in India. That’s the reason they built new schools and colleges. But educating people fared against the British government. There was an increase in the feeling of nationalism. A mass resentment was felt against the British rule, which ultimately resulted in the end of British rule in India.

Being a vast area, India had different languages being spoken in different regions. Due to lack of interpretation of each other’s languages, there was a communication gap. But the British government, by teaching English, finished this communication gap. The educated people all over India started communicating with each other and expressed their views.

This resulted in the unification of all the regions of India as far as the spirit of nationalism was concerned. The local educated people of different regions started spreading this feeling in their local languages.

People like Ram Mohan Roy started campaigns that demanded more modernization and a greater role in the government. Education had given new ideas to people. Ram Mohan Roy, called the Father of modern India, tried to abolish the practise of child marriage. He also tried to finish the caste system prevailing within the society.

Indians started feeling a sense of nationalism due to the fact that they were considered to be second class citizens of their own country. Top Indian Civil Services were reserved for the British only. Also, if an Indian and a British were in the same category of job, the Indian was paid less. For instance, in East India Railway, a British engineer got about twenty times more salary than his Indian counterpart.

The cultures of India & Britain were totally different. Indian culture had male supremacy. There was inequality among the two genders. “The British used the particular form which gender divisions took in India as a vehicle for proving their liberality, as a demonstration of their superiority, and as a legitimation of their rule.” (Liddle et al. 1985). The British wanted to change this culture and prove that there rule was legitimate. But this was not possible since the roots of Indian culture were too deep.

Such instances and many more of them led the way to the foundation of the Indian National Congress (1885) and the Muslim League (1906). The initial years of the 1900s witnessed demands from these groups for a self-government. In 1905, a partition was made and Bengal was separated from India. This infuriated the nationalists. It is notable that Bengal was a Muslim dominated region. The British wanted to separate the Muslims from the Hindus.

This resulted in terrorist activities. “The railway, which had previously been a secure means of transportations for women travelling alone, became a particularly unsafe environment. As moving targets, trains attracted random acts of violence.” (Procida 2002). In order to deal with this menace, the British government had to revoke its decision in the year 1911.

## The Effects of Imperialism in India: Indian National Congress

The Indian National Congress is one of the oldest and leading political parties of India. It was founded in the year 1885 by Allan Octavian Hume, Dadabhai Naoroji, Dinshaw Wacha, Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee, Surendranath Banerjee, Monomohun Ghose, Mahadev Govind Ranade and William Wedderburn.

Indian National Congress became the torch bearer of the Indian Independence Movement. During the years of struggle for independence, it enrolled up to 15 million members. Once India gained independence in 1947, the party became India’s dominant Democratic Party with Jawaharlal Nehru as its mentor.

## Rabindranath Tagore

Rabindranath Tagore was born on 7 May 1861 in West Bengal and died on 8 August 1941. His father’s name was Debendranath Tagore and that of his mother was Sharada Devi. His father was the honorary Secretary of the British Indian Association. Rabindranath Tagore was of an exceptional and huge personality.

His other qualities were that he was a renowned scholar, a freedom fighter, and a painter. But beyond all these, he was a modest human being. Indian Literature has colossal input of his works. He being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1913 for Gitanjali, a collection of his poems, is enough proof of his wisdom. The Indian National Anthem was penned by him. He had to travel across the region to collect rent.

During these trips, he used to meet people and listen to their plights. Gradually, he started depicting the British immorality in his poems. He wrote most of his works in Bengali, his mother tongue. In order to reach the mass public, he later translated his works.

The poems were read by a majority of people and this helped in spreading the awareness of nationalism. He mentioned the intentions of the British in his works. Being a renowned scholar, his poems and other works were read worldwide. This made other nations aware of the British atrocities and in return they started putting pressure on the British government to account for such acts.

In appreciation for his works, the Calcutta University offered him honorary Doctorate of Literature and the British government presented him with a knighthood. In 1919, the infamous Jallianwala Bagh Massacre happened where General Dyer ordered firing of innocent people. As a protest to this brutal massacre, Rabindranath Tagore surrendered the knighthood. In the ensuing years, Rabindranath visited countries like Japan and America as a devout ambassador.

## Role of Gandhi

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is and will always be the forerunner in contributing towards the independence of India. He is also known as the ‘Father of the Nation’. Apart from his struggle for independence, Gandhi’s thoughts changed the scenario of the country and its people. The Indian National Congress will always be indebted to Gandhi because when he took over the reins of the party, he had his millions of followers behind him to support the cause. Gandhi’s path to independence was of non-violence or ‘Ahimsa’.

Come what may, Gandhi never deviated from his ideologies and the path of non-violence. This always helped him to succeed. Gandhi’s main weapon was ‘Satyagraha’. Satyagraha means submissive resistance. One of his main contributions to the India society and which helped in unifying the country was the motto of ‘Sarva Dharma Sambhava’.

It meant that all people of different religions should practice equal respect for all the religions. Gandhi was also against the industrialization being done by the British. He wanted the Indians to do their chores by their own hands instead of taking help of machines.

In the year 1942, Gandhi rejected the British offer of granting India independence if it helped Britain in World War II. Instead, Gandhi started the Quit India Movement. After the war, Gandhi held conferences with the viceroy Lord Mountbatten and Muhammed Ali Jinnah, leader of Muslim League, and it was decide to carve out a separate state for the Muslims.

Although Gandhi was against this decision yet he had to agree in the larger interest of the nation. When the news spread, violence started all over the country, especially the northern part. Gandhi started fasting and toured the riot affected areas in order to bring back peace and harmony among the people. During one such meeting, he was shot dead by a person named Godse.

Even today, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is remembered as the pioneer of Indian independence. For some people, his ideologies might have lost with the passage of time, but still there are people who follow his thoughts and ideologies. But one thing is certain that if Gandhi would not have been involved in the struggle for freedom, India would have attained independence much later.

At first, we were only talking in the lab, but about three weeks into the semester, she invited me to sit with her during the lecture, which I ended up doing. Everything seemed to be going great. We started to go to the library together more often, even though we were studying, we still maintained a conversation while she worked on her things. I noticed she would sit close to me during lectures and lean way in. I don't have much relationship experience, so I would overthink what I should do, and of course, I never asked her out.

The rest of that semester went the same. We maintained great conversation, and she continued to sit close to me and joke with me, but I never made a move. Throughout our studies at the library, she had made some odd comments through conversation. The one thing that stuck out to me was we were talking about her sibling and her older brother dating a much older woman, and she had stated if she was a year older, she would be more comfortable. I never asked in depth to even provoke this kind of response, so I didn't know what to say and left her hanging. Towards the end of the semester, she became pretty moody. Wouldn't talk much, show up to class late, or she would get up and leave early, almost as if she was storming off. Also, at the library, we used to sit on the same side of the table regularly, and she snapped at me, ""Why do you always feel the need to sit right next to me?"". Some days, she would be distant and a little moody; other days, she would be her happy usual self, but during her moody days, she still sat very close to me during the lecture. 

Most of this, I chalked up to the home situation she was experiencing with the new war fronts opening in Israel. The semester had ended, and she stopped texting me on the phone as much, which hurt, but I was farming and cutting grain at the time, which allowed me to get over it pretty quickly. The day before this semester started, she texted me out of the blue and asked if we would be in O-chem 2 together, which didn't make sense because we had made our schedules together when everything was going well in the library. I messaged back, and this semester started well. The same thing is happening sitting close to me, going to the library more often, and even asking me on the weekends to study. The thing is, we don't study the same way, we sit in awkward silence sometimes, and we each work on our own thing. 

Also, she forgot to buy a parking pass, so I started giving her a ride home after lab so she didn't have to walk home. During the ride home, she still sits close, and sometimes, she's a bit more vulnerable in her emotions when talking about her roommates and other things in her life. This semester, she hasn't been moody at all, which is great. Also, we went to a coffee shop for a study session, but she looked different. She had perfume on, which she doesn't really wear at all, and she looked very pretty. We ended up studying and talking for around three hours. The thing is, she doesn't ask anyone else but me. She knows other students in the class who are better students than me.

 I asked her about the Christmas stroll, and she had already made plans, but I was thinking of asking her to a movie late Sunday to avoid conflict in her studying for the upcoming finals.

I don't know if I should be direct when asking her out. Or what I should say in general. I'm overthinking this entire situation, and I don't know how to indicate that I like her. We only have one more day left together, which will be Tuesday, and I would like to ask her in person rather than over the phone. Please help! Its also very hard to get her alone unless I'm giving her a ride home or away from her roomates.",3,1733509177.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I write up trip reports after doing unique experiences with festivals such as Discover Europe and the 20th Anniversary packages with Tomorrowland. I can go a bit overboard with details so people in the future can reference the post se see what has changed, use it for feedback and log my memories. 

This is my second Dreamstate. I never went when it was in San Bernardino because of logistical difficulties and being in a sketch area. When DS moved to the Queen Mary I was in. Flying to LGB is a breeze, it is a 20min/20-30 dollar Uber to get to Long Beach and from there an easy transfer to the QM. 

In 2023 I was not lucky enough to stay on the QM but went to the after parties and had a blast, so decided to go again this year and try to stay on the QM. 

Unfortunately I missed the email announcing the QM reservations were open, so got to the website about 30 min late. By that time all the options were waitlist only so put my name on a few of the rooms. Fortunately about 6 weeks ago Raffi from Fan Experiences contacted me with the great news, I was off the waitlist and got a portside Deluxe Stateroom. 

A special shoutout to Raffi who was responsive to any questions and communicated very thorough information about my stay. 

I flew in Friday morning, took an Uber to the shuttle point and then picked up my hotel bracelet from fan experience tent outside the QM. After a quick security check we were essentially allowed to wander the ""back areas"" of the festival. You could see the artist trailers, a bunch of workers finishing stage testing. 

There was a little area next to the QM entrance that had food trucks and a small coffee stand. I'm going to take a second and call out the Honesto coffee stand for being fabulous. I went around 6 times throughout the weekend (until I got ""banned"", more on that later). The owner was from Colombia and they used their own beans from a family farm. I basically lived off the flat whites lol. 

The QM itself is iconic and just really cool. I didn't realize it is actually about double the weight and larger than the Titanic! It is done up in 1930s Art Deco style with classy woodwork and brass finishing throughout. The main promenade looks like it comes from a movie set. Check in was painless and I ended up with a Deluxe Room on the port (left) side of the ship, with my windows overlooking the artist viewing area. If you are on the starboard side you overlook Long Beach and it is probably a bit quieter since you are not facing the festival. 

There was a welcome bag with some water and also a large Dreamstate shawl which was perfect on Saturday when it got a bit chilly and rainy. 

The room was like stepping into a time capsule from the 1930s, a refreshing change from modern cookie cutter hotel rooms. it was actually a lot larger than I was expecting, and it was interesting to see how everything was designed with crossing the ocean in a mind. All the cabinets had locking doors, the porthole windows could be screwed in place with 4 point restraints, the tub had individual nozzles for seawater and fresh water (seawater not working, makes sense, it's Long Beach port water lol) and the toilet was a squat little thing with a big push lever on the wall. It was actually more comfy than many modern hotel rooms. 

The ship had a handful of active amenities. They have two restaurants (Promenade Cafe and Chelsea's Chowder House) and a bar near the top of the ship (Observation Bar). The Observation bar just oozes class an history. Everything in wood paneling and brass accents, with Art Deco murals highlighting the walls. The drinks were better and cheaper than in the festival itself, so a great place to pre part or nip back in for a quick drink. 

Unfortunately Chelsea's was closed during the weekend and Observation Bar closed pretty early. The Promenade cafe was okay, but I liked the food at Chelsea's better last year. It was also pretty pricey, so you might have been better off getting food at the festival. 

Certain parts of the ship had roped off and closed down for the weekend, which sort of sucked. It wasn't a huge deal, but for example the sun deck was completely closed for some reason. It would have been nice to let people staying on the ship to go up there so you could get a 360 degree view of the harbor/festival and Long Beach. 

Having a hotel wristband gave you essentially unlimited in and out festival access, so you could go in right when DS opened at 1 and grab merch, check out the stages, and go back to the ship if you wanted to relax for a bit. There was a separate entrance/exit (same as the afterparty) and security just did a quick glance to make sure you had the appropriate wristbands. 

Staying on the ship also gave you access to the afterparties on both Friday and Saturday which is a huge perk and one of the reasons to actually stay on the QM. It was hugely advantageous for a few reasons. First, you didn't have to pay! Second was the bathrooms. Unfortunately they block off all the bathrooms on the QM for the afterparty and make everyone actually exit the ship and go to the docks where they have the port-a-potties. Easy enough to hit up your own room for the bathroom. Third is getting between the stages. Since most of the interior of the ship is blocked off and you need a hotel band to get around, you have to leave the ship or take a really circuitous route to get between the stages. With the hotel access it took at most 2-3 minutes to get between stages, and if you wanted to stop fora quick nap or recharge you were only a couple minutes away. 

Music was an issue if you wanted to sleep through some of the afterparties, depending on your location. I was located 1 level up from teh Grand ballroom and 1 section aft, so heard plenty of music but it didn't really bother me. If I had been one section forward my room would have been literally shaking lol. Walking through the hallways you could actually see the walls vibrating. I'm not sure if they actually used those rooms for guests or not (I didn't see anyone going in or out of them). 

Leaving on Sunday was a bit of a cluster. They had a single shuttle stop for everyone staying on the QM, but also for staff and anyone else who wanted to leave. I guess another large Carnival ship had socked and the traffic to it bakced up across the bridge to Long Beach. I skipped the bus and took an Uber directly to LGB airport which was fast and easy. 

Th afterparties were great. I made it until about 5 Am both nights and soooo grateful I just had to walk about 60 seconds to my room and collapse from exhaustion. Night two I basically camped the Grand which just banger set after banger set with some true legends throwing down. 

Overall it was a fantastic and unique experience, with lots of perks. I'm going to go through a bit of the negatives and areas for improvement, thankfully not many.

-QM was too shut down. Like I mentioned above they had blocked off the sun deck and other areas of the ship. It was disappointing to not be able to fully explore the ship and see the views from the top. 
-Chelsea restaurant being closed, food was better there than Promenade Cafe
-Last year Observation Bar stayed open until around 1 AM which was great for a couple reasons. You could get strong mixed drinks and draft beers prior to the afterparty. You could also use the bathroom there, so you didn't have to go all the way outside the ship. For some reason they did last call at 930 and closed at 10. If I could make one change it would be this, have no idea why the closed so early.
-Bathroom situation still not great. There are bathrooms next to the stages but they close them off, so everyone needs to go all the way off the ship. I had access to my room so didn't affect me but heard lots of complaints. 
-Security was super hit or miss. So above I mentioned getting ""banned"" from the coffee shop. I wasn't actually banned but Friday and Saturday throughout the day and evening I had popped over to that area to grab some coffee. Saturday evening some security guard showed up standing next to the area aggressively checking everyone's bands. He flat out refused anyone access from the ship. He didn't have a bracelet guide, just grunted and pointed away. I tried to reason with him, and mentioned that I had already had been to this area 6+ times and had to have access to get to the fan experience tent, but just blankly stared at me. I didn't want to get tossed out by some aggressive security on a power trip so didn't press the issue. 
-Someone else had been blocked from the afterparty whilst having a ship bracelet. They eventually had to circle around and find another entrance where a security guard wasn't an idiot. I know festival security has a reputation but come on....

My final verdict? Despite the above, staying on the Queen Mary transformed the festival into a seamless, immersive experience. While there were some minor aggravations and logistical issues the perks far outweighed the downsides. I couldn't imagine doing Dreamstate another way. 

Some pro tips:
-QM will sell out fast, but if you don't get it try the waitlist
-Skip LAX and if possible fly into LGB. You'll thank me later. 
-If driving try to get there early on Friday. People were saying by noon the parking lots had filled up. 
-Don't bring alcohol. They don't let you on the ship with it. So either stash it away or don't try. 
-Pack for mild but chilly weather. It's November on the ocean. You are likely to get some light rain and temps in the 40s-60s. The ship itself was chilly but hoodie and pants were fine. 
-You can bring your own food/snacks. 
-Enjoy the timeless elegence of the Observation Bar and have some nice cocktails overlooking the party.

Standouts for me were cranberry & pomegranate, evergreen & for (maybe my one of my new fave tree scents?!), and vanilla & caramel. Otherwise, everything was too spring/summer for my taste. Stocked up on some good winter scents though 🤷🏻‍♀️",24,1733509029.0,bathandbodyworks,9,0.96,False
1h87rhi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h87rhi,Our NYC Wedding Recap ,"Sharing a few photos from our big day plus some details and cost-saving tips I learned along the way! We planned the wedding in 83 DAYS! A true feat! My husband and I met, live in, and plan to raise our family in NYC, so it was so special to have our big day here! We hosted a 100-guest wedding and spent about $123k total ($83k on wedding, $30k on my gift to my husband, 10k on my bridal wardrobe). The wedding itself was reasonable for the best day of our lives. Our original budget was $160k, sharing how I saved below, too! 

The Venue 
We got married at the Burden Kahn Mansions in the UES of Manhattan in late September '24. The venue is a gilded age mansion that is now operating as a Catholic school! There are 3 rooms in the Burden Mansion where we hosted our ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception. The venue only books from March for that same year (the school gets the first pick of the dates to use the space) but is so worth it. It was $1500/hr for a rental with a 5-hour minimum. We rented the space for a total of 12 hours. It's a historic place with a small kitchen, so they have exclusive catering contacts BUT there are options from more budget-friendly to $$$$ food vendors. More info on their site https://www.burdenkahnmansion.org/
The cost of the venue includes their in-house chairs, tables, and a grand-baby piano. You must get insurance and pay for security ($200/hr) for the space. We used their in-house chairs for the ceremony and rented ballroom chairs for the dinner portion of the reception. We saved a bit of money using their long tables (they also have round) for the dining tables and using their long tables on risers for the bar. 
You otherwise need to bring everything else in - we used Broadway Party Rentals via our catering contact 
The Food 
We picked one of the mid-tier vendors, Eventfull, solely based on how excellent their event manager, Melody, was! She is a STAR and made the whole process amazing! The food was so good and we had so many compliments. We had an open bar with 4 signature drinks, wine, beer, a jamon carving station, a charcuterie station, 5 passed apps for cocktail hour (including caviar on blinis), a 3-course meal, a late-night snack (french fries) and assorted baked goods. We still have guests telling us how much they loved the meal. 
Our stunning cake was a yuzu-olive oil cake from FourCorners.NYC was one of the best cakes I have ever had!! So yummy and was about $250 for a large sheet cake. It was great to have the value of a sheet cake but still elegant. 
The Design
We did not work with a wedding planner, I came up with the design myself and worked hard to source vendors who understood our vision. When we saw the venue, I realized I did not want to try and compete with the ornate details, but we wanted to make it feel ""modern"" with organic shapes, unique florals, and personal touches. 
The first flowers my husband bought me when we were dating were red roses - how roses make me feel drove the concept.  I worked with a florist called Tovert who NAILED my vision. Jin, the founder, really had an eye for design and the details. I found her on Instagram and she was a pleasure to work with.
If you like my style feel free to DM and I am happy to share some ideas I have or had!
The Entertainment 
We opted for a string duet from Ideal Ensembles  - beautiful and professional. Yury was great to work with. We could have done a trio or quartet, but with the smaller space of the ceremony room and all the marble, the sound was well amplified naturally and I think any more would have been too loud. We had them play ""Every Teardrop is a Waterfall"" as we shared our first kiss and it added a lot of DRAMAAA in the best way! 
Morsy Music for DJ and Sax accompaniment - 90% of our wedding guests were millennials. He is a great DJ who ACTUALLY SPINS and doesn't just make a playlist. He was amazing to work with and was able to operate with the restrictive venue requirements (i.e. no tape on the marble floors). We had a sax player playing with him the first hour of the dancing. It was a great way to add a live music element that is a little more special than a standard DJ. 
Columbia University Lion Dance Team - My husband is Chinese and wanted to incorporate his culture. These college students did a GREAT job and our guests loved the performance. They did a ten-minute performance as we entered for our grand entrance with 2 lions, the live music, a dancing buddha, the whole thing! 
The Details 
We had our welcome/seating cards as personalized drawings of all our guests. Having the drawings was great - it was a seating chart, a gift, and a little ""something else"". I used Drawn Together NYC. I reached out to them, and they connected me with one of their artists and she did a killer job. Everyone thought it was so unique and having an original piece of art aligns with my husband's and I's interests! He loves the New Yorker magazine and I love art. 
Custom coffee cups (not pictured) with our cat's photo and ""Cafe Con Fedez"" stickers. The cat's name is Fedez. This was my only DIY. This added a personal touch and was about $100 total vs the $200 it would have cost us to rent coffee mugs and saucers 
Capturing the Day 
Photography - We worked with a newer photographer and got a great rate. I asked her for ""images that are effortless, artful, remarkably cinematic as if they were straight out of a movie and so candid that they may even feel accidental"" and she delivered 100 times over.  
Content Creation: EverBridalContent - I found her on Reddit! images are not on this post BUT she did an amazing job. We had over 2000 clips from the day - it was so fun to see the wedding again from her POV. This was so worth it!! I could not recommend more
Cost Saving 
The venue was STUNNING on its own - I found that a lot of ""white box"" spaces need a ton of decor to make it feel aesthetic. The better your venue, the less ""extra"" you need. 
We didn't do a photobooth. I always use them at weddings I go to, but I usually find them a little ugly in the design (unless you rented a vintage style one). I think the money is better spent elsewhere 
We bought our chargers from EFavorMart for $120 for 100. It would have been $500 to rent the same chargers from the rental company. We delivered them to the venue the day before and the catering company packed them back up for us after the wedding 
Design helps - I prefer coupe wine glasses over flutes and they were cheaper! this added a lot of nice detail and vibe to the day. All of our specialty cocktails had an ""extra"" bit I sourced myself. A water topper of SF bridge for the espresso martini, cube ice, and an ice stamp of ""double happiness"" we got off Etsy ($50) for the old-fashioned; cocktail sticks with a little rat image for our ""NYC Rat Dirty Martini"" ($45 on Etsy), and edible glitter for the elderflower spritz ($10 on amazon). For the table settings - we did not do a wine flute and mixed and matched the glassware for an eclectic vibe. We splurged on the salad plate with an elegant design but kept the dinner plate more simple (gold band white plate). The food was plated beautifully and we wanted that to stand out PLUS it saved us $300 from doing the upgraded plate. ",31,1733508803.0,WedditNYC,14,0.95,False
