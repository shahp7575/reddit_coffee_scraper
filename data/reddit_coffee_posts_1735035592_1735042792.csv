I have a ton of games, and i would love to play more. I'm not gonnas list any games since that's not the purpose of this post. This post is more to find someone that i can vibe with, someone i get along with. But it would be very good if you  played games.

But i'm gonna list some favorites of different kinds, so you somewhat get a feel for who i am?

* The movie Oldboy, been my favorite since it came out, so good.
* Bread. I do love bread, any type of bread tbh, it's not good for you but could easily live on it.
* Pepsi Max/Water/Coffee. I almost exclusively drink these 3 things.
* I do listen to a lot of music, but it's hard to describe? so heres my [last.fm](http://last.fm/user/zauron)
* Animals! An easy thing to love. I sadly don't have a cat anymore, but i'll adopt one soon again. I'm also very into Capybaras, they are amazing!
* Homelabbing. I have a *redacted* which i tinker with a lot, running a bunch of services and just playing around with it, it's super fun!

1hlc1w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teethgumhealth/comments/1hlc1w4/does_delta_dental_cover_teeth_whitening/,Does Delta Dental Cover Teeth Whitening,"Understanding Delta Dental's Coverage on Teeth Whitening Services
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to maintaining sparkling white teeth, many people wonder about the role dental insurance plays in their teeth whitening journey. If you are considering teeth whitening and have Delta Dental insurance, you may be asking yourself: does Delta Dental cover teeth whitening? Understanding the specifics can help you make informed decisions about your dental care and budget.

Generally, Delta Dental provides a wide range of dental services, but teeth whitening is often categorized differently. Here‚Äôs a breakdown to clarify what you need to know:

- **Cosmetic vs. Essential Care:** Teeth whitening primarily falls under cosmetic dentistry rather than essential dental care. Most insurance policies, including Delta Dental, typically cover only essential services that maintain oral health.
- **Types of Whitening Services:** There are various methods for whitening teeth, including in-office treatments performed by a dentist and at-home kits. Understand that most insurance will not cover these optional procedures.
- **Plan Variations:** Different Delta Dental plans may have different inclusions and exclusions. It is crucial to review your specific plan details to see if any provisions apply to whitening services.

To determine whether your Delta Dental coverage includes teeth whitening, follow these steps:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
1. **Check Your Policy:** The first step is to read through your policy documents. Most insurance handbooks outline covered and non-covered services. Look for sections about cosmetic dentistry.
2. **Contact Customer Service:** If you are unsure after checking your policy, reach out to Delta Dental's customer service. They can provide accurate information about your coverage options.
3. **Consult Your Dentist:** Your dentist may also have insights into what is likely covered under your plan. They can help you create a treatment plan that works with your insurance.

If you discover that teeth whitening is not covered by your Delta Dental plan, don‚Äôt be disheartened! Here are some alternatives you might consider:

- **In-Office Solutions:** While these might be out of pocket, many patients find them effective due to their long-lasting results.
- **At-Home Kits:** Look for over-the-counter whitening kits that are less expensive and designed for effectiveness at home.
- **Payment Plans:** Some dental offices offer financing options for cosmetic procedures, making whitening services more accessible.

It‚Äôs important to weigh the benefits against costs when contemplating cosmetic procedures like teeth whitening. If enhancing your smile is a priority for you, understanding your insurance plan can help you find the best way to achieve that bright smile.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
The takeaway here is clear: while Delta Dental generally does not cover teeth whitening due to its classification as a cosmetic procedure, you still have options. Familiarizing yourself with your specific plan and working closely with your dental provider can open up avenues for affordable teeth whitening treatments.

In addition to exploring dental coverage, remember that maintaining good oral hygiene practices can also impact the whiteness of your teeth. Here are some best practices that can help keep your teeth bright:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
1. **Regular Brushing:** Brush your teeth at least twice a day with fluoride toothpaste.
2. **Floss Daily:** Flossing removes plaque and food particles between teeth that brushing alone may miss.
3. **Limit Stain-Causing Foods:** Reduce your intake of coffee, tea, and red wine, which can contribute to staining.

While Delta Dental does not typically cover teeth whitening services, being proactive in checking your coverage and maintaining proper dental habits can help you achieve the smile you desire. Knowing your options allows you to proceed confidently on your journey to a brighter smile.

Exploring Alternative Options for Teeth Whitening Beyond Insurance
------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening is a popular cosmetic procedure that many people seek for a brighter smile. While some dental insurance plans might cover certain treatments, many do not extend their coverage to teeth whitening. This often leaves individuals looking for alternative options that won‚Äôt break the bank. Whether you want to brighten your teeth before an important event or simply wish to maintain a dazzling smile, there are several alternatives to consider.

### Understanding Your Options

When insurance doesn‚Äôt cover your teeth whitening needs, you can explore several alternative options. These alternatives range from in-office treatments to at-home solutions, each with its own benefits and costs. Here‚Äôs a look at some of the most accessible choices:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-Office Treatments:** Professional whitening procedures conducted by a dentist are typically the most effective. They use stronger bleaching agents than you‚Äôd find in over-the-counter solutions, often resulting in immediate results. However, these treatments can be expensive, generally ranging from $300 to $1,000.
- **Take-Home Kits from Dentists:** Many dental offices offer custom take-home whitening kits. These kits often include a less potent version of the whitening gel used during in-office treatments. While they are more affordable than in-office whitening, expect to pay between $200 and $400.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** There are numerous whitening products available at pharmacies, including strips, gels, and toothpaste. These are typically less expensive, costing anywhere from $20 to $50, but they may take longer to produce noticeable results.
- **Natural Remedies:** Some individuals turn to home remedies for a whitening boost. Baking soda, activated charcoal, and hydrogen peroxide are common options. While these methods are often inexpensive and readily available, results can vary and may take longer.
- **Whitening Mouthwash:** Some mouthwashes offer mild whitening effects. They‚Äôre easy to incorporate into your daily oral hygiene routine but may yield only subtle changes in your smile over time. These mouthwashes generally cost between $5 and $15.

### Cost Considerations

When deciding on a teeth whitening option, understanding the costs involved is crucial. When exploring alternatives to insurance-covered teeth whitening, consider not just the price but also the potential effectiveness. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the costs associated with each option:

- In-Office Treatments: $300 - $1,000
- Take-Home Kits from Dentists: $200 - $400
- Over-the-Counter Products: $20 - $50
- Natural Remedies: Generally low-cost
- Whitening Mouthwash: $5 - $15

### Choosing the Right Option for You

Your choice of teeth whitening method should depend on several factors:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Effectiveness:** If you‚Äôre looking for quick and significant results, in-office treatments are your best bet. If you're more patient, at-home kits or over-the-counter products may suffice.
- **Budget:** Assess how much you‚Äôre willing to spend. If budget constraints are tight, home remedies or over-the-counter options might be more appealing.
- **Teeth Sensitivity:** Some whitening methods can cause discomfort for sensitive teeth. If you have sensitive teeth, consider starting with gentler options or consult your dentist for advice.

### Tips for Maintaining Your Whitened Smile

Once you‚Äôve achieved the bright smile you desire, it‚Äôs essential to maintain it. Here are some easy tips:

- **Good Oral Hygiene:** Brush and floss regularly to keep plaque at bay, which can dull your shine.
- **Avoid Staining Foods/Drinks:** Limit your intake of dark beverages like coffee, tea, and red wine that can stain your teeth.
- **Regular Dental Cleanings:** Visit your dentist every six months for a professional cleaning.
- **Use Whitening Toothpaste:** a whitening toothpaste into your daily routine can help maintain your results.

By exploring the available options for teeth whitening beyond insurance coverage, you can find a solution that aligns with your budget and needs. Remember to weigh the pros and cons of each method, and consult your dentist if you have specific concerns. A brighter smile is within reach‚Äîeven if your insurance doesn‚Äôt cover it!

### Conclusion

Navigating dental insurance can often be challenging, especially when it comes to specific treatments like teeth whitening. Delta Dental typically does not cover teeth whitening as it is considered a cosmetic procedure. This means that if you‚Äôre looking to brighten your smile, you will likely need to explore payment options outside of your insurance plan.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Fortunately, there are various alternative options available that can suit different budgets. From over-the-counter whitening strips and toothpaste to professional treatments offered by dentists, you have plenty of choices. In-office treatments may provide quicker results, but they often come with a higher price tag. At-home kits can be more affordable and still deliver effective results, making them a great option for those looking to save.

It‚Äôs also wise to consider the long-term value of any whitening treatment you choose. Maintaining your dental health and adhering to good oral hygiene practices can help prolong the effects of whitening. Additionally, regular dental check-ups and cleanings can enhance your smile without the need for harsh whitening agents.

Your journey to a brighter smile doesn‚Äôt have to be limited by insurance coverage. With the right information and a little research, you can find a teeth whitening solution that works for you, fits your lifestyle, and brings out your best smile. Remember, investing in your dental appearance can lead to increased confidence and improved self-esteem, making the pursuit worthwhile.",1,1735041199.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False
1hlc0qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/morningmessage/comments/1hlc0qy/happy_tuesday/,Happy Tuesday ,"Good morning. Love. A garden bed of soil. A helping hand doing a load of laundry. A small surprise bought during the shopping trip that brightened someone‚Äôs day. An unexpected phone call from a long lost relative catching up. Love. 

Love. An innocent Man punished for the sins of others. A child destined for pain and torture, knowing this yet still choosing that path. An infant King, God in human form, born in the crud and mud of a stable. Pure and holy. Mankind‚Äôs only hope for salvation. Love. 

Love is expressed in so many ways. May our love gift to God and others be open and honest, may we strive to give the same  to Him as He gave to us, everything. 

Copied below, a story I ran across that I knew I needed to share. Have a great day friends. 

I often joke that my 11-year-old is like an immovable slug, so when I asked him to help me unload dirt from our little pickup into his mom's new garden boxes, his response was pretty typical.

‚ÄúUmmmm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm busy right now,‚Äù he said, totally absorbed in playing Roblox on the family laptop, dressed in sweatpants and an old T-shirt, lounging on the couch with his feet up on the coffee table.

‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre not,‚Äù I replied.

There was the usual back-and-forth‚Äîwhining, excuses, you name it. A little while later, we found ourselves next to a wheelbarrow shoveling dirt. He looked at me with those flat eyes, his hoodie pulled up, shoulders slumped, and asked, ‚ÄúWhy do we have to do this?‚Äù

I paused for a second, because honestly, it was a fair question. Neither of us were really into flowers or veggies, or anything that would grow in those boxes. But my wife, Mel, absolutely loves gardening.

After thinking it over, I finally said, ‚ÄúWhen you love someone, you serve them.‚Äù I went on to explain that I want him to grow up to be the kind of guy who takes care of his family, friends, and community.

‚ÄúThis,‚Äù I said, gesturing to the dirt, the garden boxes I had built the weekend before, the wheelbarrow and shovel, and the first of many truckloads of dirt we‚Äôd be unloading over the next few weeks, ‚Äú...is what love looks like.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt thrilled with my answer, and I could tell as he reluctantly picked his shovel back up.

We finished unloading the dirt, and the next day, while I was at work and the kids and Mel were off because it was a break between terms, Mel sent me a picture. She had picked up another load of dirt, and before she could even unload it, Tristan jumped in to help. When she asked him why he was doing it, he just shrugged and said, ‚ÄúBecause I love you.‚Äù

I can‚Äôt tell you how proud I felt of my son in that moment

‚Ä¢Please pray for continuing displays of love‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúSo they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.‚Äù Luke 2:16-20. Have a blessed day. 143!!!

You don't always need a plan. Sometimes you just need to breathe, trust, let go and see what happens

We had a range of experiences at all the cafes, but for our tastes, the coffee from Glitch fit our desired profile the most.

  
I've been enjoying hydrangea for a while now, brew with a basic v60 + ode 2. And I tried hoffman's v60 recipe. Never was a huge fan. Then landed on Hendricks 1-2-1, and had a decent time with it. A lot of my experience has been a struggle getting the coffee to not be bitter, bring out the tasting notes. And I kept needing to grind coarser and coarser, to get the draw down times to finish on time.

  
After our trip i noticed a few things that a lot of our favorite coffee shops were doing. And the largest one was a really low brew temperature. I typically brewed anywhere from 195 to 203F. 

  
Glitch brewed at 186. 

I was like huh I've never tried going that low before. They were so kind and gave us a brew guide along with a sample of the grind size they used. I came home and ground some beans to match as best I could, ended up for my around 5.2 on the Ode gen 2. And at this time, I was using always 7-7.2.



So I gave their brew guide a try this morning on 2 cups. And the cups were so clean! Im not saying its directly the reason, but what I found interesting was I ground finer, agitated less, bloomed less, and the resulting cup was very pleasant. Gonna play around with things more, but im convinced the lower temp is what I really needed to brew the cup I like.

  
If your curious on their guide, you can find it on the subreddit but its basically:

15g coffee

260g water @ 86C

0:00   |   +70g 

0:30   |   +140g  (210g total)

1:30   |   +50g    (260g total)

2:30  |   Finish, pull when 210g of yield is reached. ",6,1735041058.0,pourover,3,1.0,False
1hlc07e,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParanormalEncounters/comments/1hlc07e/i_met_humans_with_telepathy_and_other/,I met humans with telepathy and other supernatural abilities in 2005,"Hi friends. Back in 2005 I had an incredible experience that I'd like to share. I kind of keep this to myself for the most part as nearly 20 years on I'm pretty much a normal dad with kids and a career and don't want to ... ya know... but some things that happened when I was young still stun me to this day and this is one of them.

Caveat: In the lead up to the night I had this chance meeting I had gone through quite a psychologically questionable series of events that culminated in me ending up being diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder and hospitalised. I won't go into detail on everything that occurred during this ""psychotic"" event but it lasted about six months and is the only reason I sort of keep this story largely to myself, because it provides plausible deniability to even myself that it happened. Contradictory to that though I know adamantly that this part of it actually happened. Funny how the brain works. Or is it just me? Anyway there it is for those who switch off when stories are told by psychotics! Read on if you're still curious.

I attended a party in Northern NSW, Australia in the spring of 2005. These ""bush doofs"" were frequented by odd and unusual people of different sub cultures but on this night it was stranger than the usual ravers that I was used to. Much more pleasant. Much more friendly.

At first the party was relatively normal like any other party of its type. Lots of electronic music, people dancing and enjoying the atmosphere. I was there with my girlfriend at the time who was a bit of a free spirit and seemed to just know absolutely everyone at the party, which wasn't unusual. She seemed to either develop instant chemistry with anyone or already just knew people and I never got to the bottom of that. She and I mostly went our separate ways at parties like this and would just meet up randomly as the doof brought us back together.

During the night at the party I met a few ""interesting"" people. This wasn't the first time I'd met supernatural types or had strange experiences at a party like this but it was the first time it happened that I wasn't on drugs. The first one I remember was a guy silently gesturing to me. I sort of didn't realise he was gesturing to me so just stared blankly until another guy grabbed me and pointed at the ground where the dude was gesturing. As it turns out the guy was trying to bring my attention to himself seemingly manifesting a small energy orb the size of a marble at the tip of his fingertips hovering about a few cms above the ground. It was translucent. Almost like a bubble but it was more dense and hovering perfectly still and seemingly manifested by this guy. Or maybe he was just pointing at it. I reacted with awe, as you would, and both guys were happy with my reaction. They sort of celebrated with each other and with me, without making sounds. I continued to party. Cool fun. Magic orb. Let's go.

The second one I met was when I was sitting by an open fire. She was sitting across from me. A pretty looking white woman with a short cropped brown haircut and a crochet beanie on her head. Relatively normal looking type of Northern NSW raver. We caught each others eyes and then suddenly I could hear her voice inside my head. Well not at first. At first we had a brief conversation telepathically without me realising it was happening. I don't remember many of the talking points but it was probably me thinking about how cute she was and her replying. When I first noticed it she laughed because I instantly rejected what was occurring and physically jumped a little. She must have reassured me pretty quickly because we sat there discussing... something... for a long time. Again, the words were taken from me so I can't remember much of the discussion. But what happened next was pretty intense. She told me that she could ... do pretty much anything. And that I could too while she was there. Wild right? Well she evidenced it by reaching into the fire and picking up a handful, not a coal, a handful of embers and holding the fire in her hands. She did this with no pain, dropped it or dismissed it and then showed me no injury and told me to try. So I did. And it worked. She was, like the previous dudes, completely thrilled. And her joy actually was so palpable it completely washed over me. It was an intensely euphoric feeling. Paralysingly so. Pure joy that overwhelmed every one of my senses.

The next thing I know I am being stirred awake by a random raver looking dude and it's dawn. I'm snuggled into a sleeping bag and under a tree and had the best nights sleep ever. He gives me a small thimble full of hot brown liquid and gestures for me to drink it. He seems super awesome so ... I do. It tastes like... sort of like a coffee but a bit different. Very pleasant. Warming, soothing.

I get up and I notice that the party looks ... different. There are no cars around, nobody drinking, nobody passed out on the ground, nobody looking like post doof regret partiers, just... 20 or so very quiet, very peaceful people and the DJ. And my girlfriend sitting with them on a rug as they cooked up a hot meal; some sort of stew or vegetable curry.

So I walked over to her but as I did I noticed that more people were emerging seemingly from behind the trees in the forest that was surrounding the glade the party was in. All of them were attractive, but not overwhelmingly so. Men, women and even kids all emerged from behind the trees. I don't know how many but the party picked back up and they basically just all started dancing with each other, being merry. No talking though. Only me, my girlfriend and the girl from the fire who was now sitting next to my girlfriend seemed to talk. 

I walked over to them and must have had a look of shock or awe on my face while both of them had a look of complete contentment and happiness, which calmed me a bit. They gestured me to sit down so I did. They served me a bowl of the food and I wolfed it down. Next thing I know I'm laying face down and completely incapacitated. All I remember is a feeling of mild static electricity in the back of my head. I eventually came to and sat up and they asked if they could paint me, so I let them.

They drew on me with dye or ink. It was pleasant enough. Everyone was still having a good time. It took what felt like maybe 15 minutes for them to finish. As soon as they did the music stopped, people started retreating into the forest, their demeanour changed to almost hostile and my girlfriend told me we had to go. She almost dragged me out of the glade and down a small lane that quickly turned into the main road back to the highway. Suddenly all the hungover people and the cars were all visible again. We walked about a kilometre back to the main road and attempted to hitch hike to the nearest town which took ages. Eventually we finally got collected and I was able to look in the mirror. They'd painted me in the most incredible clown make-up you've ever seen. It was really impressive, but I certainly felt like I'd been ... I dunno ... mocked or laughed at? 

My girlfriend and I drifted apart not long after that. As I said this was a small part of a larger series of events over a fairly long period and my memory of the time isn't amazing for a number of reasons but this night stuck out for obvious reasons.",4,1735041004.0,ParanormalEncounters,1,0.83,False

Bond 1 | Pohjola is the name of a country in the north that is only spoken of in legends these days. Would you understand if I told you it's the northern polar region located to the north of Suomi...that is, Finland, son-in-law? It is a land enclosed in snow, ice and the darkness of the northern nights, yet it still has a short but wonderful Summer... It's a remote and inconvenient land where things don't go as planned, but that's just how a human's life is most of the time.  
Bond 2 | This chick is Kokko, an eagle of flames. The others are the tonttu fairies and the peikko trolls. The sea monster Turisas is with us too. They are members of Louhi's family who live in Pohjola. We all live there helping each other out.  
Bond 3 | Louhi's gotten quite younger by becoming a Servant. Maybe my daughters' Saint Graphs have gotten a bit mixed into mine? Anyway, it's great that my shoulders and waist have been relieved. Look, nom...my teeth that I am proud of are in perfect shape as well! ...Ah, sorry, I ended up drawing some blood when I bit you...  
Bond 4 | Aha, I see. With a Mystic Code, son-in-law can use Gandr too. While it isn't in the language of Pohjola, I know that these spells‚Äîthe forte of the people of the North‚Äîare collectively called Gandr and are feared by many. In that case, Louhi will call them that as well...by the way? Actually, it is this Louhi who is the 'Gandr', you know? If you want to make someone miserable‚Äîwhether by having them suffer an injury or catch some disease‚Äîor you have a target of revenge, just tell me, okay, son-in-law? I'll gift them with a blow they'll never be able to recover from.  
Bond 5 | Moi, son-in-law! Come here for a bit and help Louhi polish her horns...phew, yes, yes, you're doing great. Hm? ""They are hard glitter faintly like jewels, yet they also feel like velvet to the touch""? I-I see. Fuhi, ihihihihihi...I won't give them to you just because you praised them.  
Dialogue 1 | Moi! Time to go skiing, son-in-law!  
Dialogue 2 | Son-in-law and Louhi's meeting was fated to be. It was the will of the sky god Ukko...is that what you thought I'd say that!? It's obvious Louhi got you with her own hands!  
Dialogue 3 | Son-in-law will be the groom of one of Louhi's daughters. I can't wait for the day you get adopted into my family. (Male MC) / Son-in-law will be the groom of one of Louhi's daughters. It doesn't matter whether you are a man or a woman. A Mage can solve that problem one way or another! (Female MC)  
Dialogue 4 | Heeh. A hawk witch is here as well? A great witch who makes barley congee? She really wants a pigsty and lends people all kinds of wisdom? How do I say this, she's quite push- no, it's nothing, yep, hang in there. If it's barley, Louhi's specialty is brewing beer. During a wedding feast, I'd brew enough to fill a lake. You can leave preparations for a celebration to Louhi. (If you have Circe and her True Name has been revealed)  
Dialogue 5 | These little ones are the tonttu. Fairies who help out at Louhi's residence. They work very hard, which is of great help to me. However, it is quite troubling that in Chaldea, whenever they see one of the Joulupukki...those Santa imitations, they follow them and go off somewhere... Ah, the tonttu have pakkanen, the fairies of cold frost, mixed into them as well so be careful, son-in-law. Your fingers will end up turning black like salmiakki and get plucked off. (If you have any Santa Servants)  
Dialogue 6 | That jewel-loving goddess, Ishtar was her name, I think. She is quite decent. She fires a great Gandr since she puts her back into it. If you don't amass a solid amount of grudges on a daily basis, you won't be able to let loose such a heavy blow...it's a bit scary. (If you have any Ishtar)  
Dialogue 7 | Voi...There's a Louhi inside Sitonai too? Interesting. She also has an otso...a bear. Otso are nice, aren't they. Still, you see, when I sent a bear elder I was good friends with to give that old fart a good talking-to, they ended up getting eaten by him completely which turned into a small trauma for me. Ngh, that damn Vainemoinen...! (If you have Sitonai and finished Christmas 2024 event)  
Likes | The worst candy in the world...? No way that's true! Salmiakki is good! The Human Order, or whatever you call it, doesn't get it yet, but it will come to like it before long!  
Dislikes | (Chirping) Uh-huh, Kokko says they hate ptarmigan. Their feathers get stuck in your throat...makes sense, noniin. Louhi hates V√§in√§m√∂inen! Also...to tell you the truth...c-c-cavities are something to fear...!  
Holy Grail | Louhi doesn't wish for anything great. I want to live in peace in that beloved Pohjola of mine. However, that wish just won't get granted no matter how hard I try.  
Event | It's quite lively here. Did they set up a herring market somewhere? Let's fill a basket with sandwiches and go out to take a look!  
Birthday | Aaaah...I've had enough, everything's a pain in the butt, I want to become a Sacabambaspis! ...Fugyah! No, th-this, you see...Usually, I'm out there telling my family and others things like ""work diligently"" or ""pull yourself together"", but even Louhi feels like leaving it all behind and running away at least once a year... Oh? Today is son-in-law's birthday? Then let's laze around to our heart's content together today. Fuhihi~n
Summoning | Moi! I'm ""Louhi""! The Eagle Witch and the mistress of the land in the far north, ""Pohjola""! Starting today, you too will become a part of Louhi's family so make sure you do your best at your training, son-in-law!

Having fused with the flame eagle Kokko, I burn and devour everything. I will have the nine diseases be visited upon son-in-law's enemies!  
Ascension 4 | Hihi. Have you finally gathered your resolve to be adopted into my family, son-in-law?  What, you still haven't decided? In that case, come to my place for the time being. Ruminate on it at your own pace while doing your son-in-law training. You'll surely find yourself a bride that suits your fancy before long during that period.  
Bond 1 | It's only after being thoroughly driven into a corner from messing up terribly and being abandoned even by the moon that people really start living! That's 'sisu' at its finest!  
Bond 2 | They show up to feasts they weren't invited to, make strange noises, cause a mess, and then regret everything on their own after it's over. That's how the foolish creatures known as men are. On the other hand, there are women who, no matter how vibrant and clever they appear, are no different from infants on the inside. They are all the same. If everyone was wise and sophisticated, songs or love wouldn't come to be.  
Bond 3 | Tattatta~ yadattatta~ yadattandaradira moimoimoi~! Yep, yep. In Pohjola we mostly used our spells by singing and drumming. Recently, Louhi's favorite is definitely the air guitar! I won't lose to some stingy old fart's kantele! Fuu~!  
Bond 4 | There're not only good things about having a family. Most of the time, it's nothing but trouble. Just like how you can't split a ptarmigan or a squirrel into parts while they are alive, you can't really split from your family either. It's common for your feelings to not get across and to get frustrated with each other. That's why one has to be careful when choosing a son-in-law as well. Well, perhaps Louhi made things hard for her daughters with that...  
Bond 5 | The witch Louhi is the master of Pohjola! However, I accept that here, in Chaldea, you are the Master, son-in-law. I've come to learn that you are the one with the greatest resolve. Take care of your body and do your best, son-in-law.  
Dialogue 1 | Shall we take some of the forest's harvest soon, son-in-law?  
Dialogue 2 | Louhi does not need consideration or kind words. Save such things for the other girls.  
Dialogue 3 | The reason I chose son-in-law? Seeing the people at Chaldea should make that obvious. If they are son-in-law's family then they are family to Louhi as well.  
Dialogue 4 | Ooh? Astraea...so the one she is possessing is one of the so-called people of Kalewa, a daughter of Suomi. In that case, to the mistress of Pohjola, Louhi, she should be called my enemy rather than my brethren...Well, to show deference to son-in-law, if it's just drinking coffee together I can put up with that much, I guess...Of course, if she wants to start posturing as the righteous and challenges me to a fistfight, I'll take her any day, you know? (If you have Astraea)  
Dialogue 5 | Fueeeh! Galatea!? She's quite the big deal. An ivory statue that managed to come to life. I am reminded of that doll bride the smith Ilmarinen made out of gold and silver. Though that one remained a cold and stiff statue and even Ilmarinen's face was soaked in tears going ""Why did it end up like this..."". Even though he acts like that, that guy was a master of his craft that made the Sampo and, well, he was also Louhi's son-in-law once so I don't really want to say bad things about him, but...there was a time he got mad and turned my daughter into a seagull and he also went and made a collar that could capture this Louhi. He is an outrageous psycho bastard... Aah, how scary. (if you have Galatea)  
Likes | After all is said and done, family is number one. A hardworker who cherishes their family. Doesn't matter if they are average or weak. They will be honest and apologise when they are in the wrong. That's the kind of son-in-law you'll become, son-in-law.  
Dislikes | Voi, voi, voi...! What Louhi can't forgive is that cunning old fart. Young men are all fools so I can let them off lightly for their mischief. Gah! But when it comes to that ungrateful V√§in√§m√∂inen‚Äã, he's just the worst! He incites the young ones and then just plays on his kantele like he had nothing to do with it! He stole the Sampo and would abandon a baby on a hill! That damn bastard!!  
Holy Grail | If I just had the Sampo...I'm not talking about my Noble Phantasm that is woven from mana. If I just had the real Sampo, the beautiful Pohjola and everyone would return to my home...  
Event | There's a big event right now! Hyv√§√§! In that case, I'll butcher my treasured giant bull!  
Birthday | Hmm, birthday? Free time to go out of my way and celebrate such a thing...is something I have. Hyv√§√§ syntym√§p√§iv√§√§! Happy birthday, son-in-law! For your gift, let's see...an all-night long live concert performed with Louhi's newly made air guitar or the right to take part in a wife carrying race! I'll let you pick the one you like!

1hlbl8z,https://archive.md/KlVND,Article: Your blood pressure reading is probably wrong. ,"Dangling your arm, wearing the wrong size cuff and scrolling on your phone can make a reading higher or lower than it should be.

More often than not, patients and even nurses and doctors are skipping steps that help paint an accurate portrait of someone‚Äôs blood pressure.
How someone sits and positions their arm, whether they just had a cup of coffee or chitchat with their practitioner during the measurement, and other factors can produce readings that are higher or lower than normal blood pressure.
‚ÄúTo really make a dent at improving people‚Äôs cardiovascular health, we need to screen and treat people for hypertension, but we need to do it correctly,‚Äù said Dr Tammy Brady, a pediatric nephrologist at the Johns Hopkins Children‚Äôs Centre in Baltimore who studies blood-pressure measurement and cardiovascular health in children and adults.

Getting the right reading is important for preventing heart attacks, strokes and other potentially fatal conditions.
What does it take to get your reading right? You should sit with both feet on the ground, legs uncrossed, back straight and your arm supported on a table or other surface, according to guidelines from the American Heart Association and other organisations. A cuff should be positioned over your bare arm at the level of your heart. You shouldn‚Äôt talk or scroll on your phone while it is being measured, and your bladder should be empty. And you should take your blood pressure at least a couple of times in a sitting.

Anxiety can also be a factor when it comes to inaccurate blood-pressure readings. Some people have elevated blood pressure in a doctor‚Äôs office, though it typically reads normal at home, a condition known as white-coat hypertension.

Level up 2 | Ippon‚ô™ pippon‚ô™ pelist√§‚ô™ pois‚ô™  
Level up 3 | Here's some salmiakki as a reward~  
Ascension 1 | Ihana! Fluffy clothes are the strongest~! This is how Pohjola's people should dress! Our eyelashes freezing is an everyday thing for us. There, there, Kokko is in perfect form as well.  
Ascension 2 | Mit√§? Aah, these horns are crystallization of magic power. Female reindeer protect their bodies with their horns during winter season, you see. If you touch me carelessly, you'll get stabbed in the guts! ‚Ä¶Tota, well, if you‚Äôll be gentle‚Ä¶  
Bond 1 | Pohjola is the name of a country in the north that is only spoken of in legends these days. Would you understand if I told you it's the northern polar region located to the north of Suomi...that is, Finland, son-in-law? It is a land enclosed in snow, ice and the darkness of the northern nights, yet it still has a short but wonderful Summer... It's a remote and inconvenient land where things don't go as planned, but that's just how a human's life is most of the time.  
Bond 2 | This chick is Kokko, an eagle of flames. The others are the tonttu fairies and the peikko trolls. The sea monster Turisas is with us too. They are members of Louhi's family who live in Pohjola. We all live there helping each other out.  
Bond 3 | Louhi's gotten quite younger by becoming a Servant. Maybe my daughters' Saint Graphs have gotten a bit mixed into mine? Anyway, it's great that my shoulders and waist have been relieved. Look, nom...my teeth that I am proud of are in perfect shape as well! ...Ah, sorry, I ended up drawing some blood when I bit you...  
Bond 4 | Aha, I see. With a Mystic Code, son-in-law can use Gandr too. While it isn't in the language of Pohjola, I know that these spells‚Äîthe forte of the people of the North‚Äîare collectively called Gandr and are feared by many. In that case, Louhi will call them that as well...by the way? Actually, it is this Louhi who is the 'Gandr', you know? If you want to make someone miserable‚Äîwhether by having them suffer an injury or catch some disease‚Äîor you have a target of revenge, just tell me, okay, son-in-law? I'll gift them with a blow they'll never be able to recover from.  
Bond 5 | Moi, son-in-law! Come here for a bit and help Louhi polish her horns...phew, yes, yes, you're doing great. Hm? ""They are hard glitter faintly like jewels, yet they also feel like velvet to the touch""? I-I see. Fuhi, ihihihihihi...I won't give them to you just because you praised them.  
Dialogue 1 | Moi! Time to go skiing, son-in-law!  
Dialogue 2 | Son-in-law and Louhi's meeting was fated to be. It was the will of the sky god Ukko...is that what you thought I'd say that!? It's obvious Louhi got you with her own hands!  
Dialogue 3 | Son-in-law will be the groom of one of Louhi's daughters. I can't wait for the day you get adopted into my family. (Male MC) / Son-in-law will be the groom of one of Louhi's daughters. It doesn't matter whether you are a man or a woman. A Mage can solve that problem one way or another! (Female MC)  
Dialogue 4 | Heeh. A hawk witch is here as well? A great witch who makes barley congee? She really wants a pigsty and lends people all kinds of wisdom? How do I say this, she's quite push- no, it's nothing, yep, hang in there. If it's barley, Louhi's specialty is brewing beer. During a wedding feast, I'd brew enough to fill a lake. You can leave preparations for a celebration to Louhi. (If you have Circe and her True Name has been revealed)  
Dialogue 5 | These little ones are the tonttu. Fairies who help out at Louhi's residence. They work very hard, which is of great help to me. However, it is quite troubling that in Chaldea, whenever they see one of the Joulupukki...those Santa imitations, they follow them and go off somewhere... Ah, the tonttu have pakkanen, the fairies of cold frost, mixed into them as well so be careful, son-in-law. Your fingers will end up turning black like salmiakki and get plucked off. (If you have any Santa Servants)  
Dialogue 6 | That jewel-loving goddess, Ishtar was her name, I think. She is quite decent. She fires a great Gandr since she puts her back into it. If you don't amass a solid amount of grudges on a daily basis, you won't be able to let loose such a heavy blow...it's a bit scary. (If you have any Ishtar)  
Dialogue 7 | Voi...There's a Louhi inside Sitonai too? Interesting. She also has an otso...a bear. Otso are nice, aren't they. Still, you see, when I sent a bear elder I was good friends with to give that old fart a good talking-to, they ended up getting eaten by him completely which turned into a small trauma for me. Ngh, that damn Vainemoinen...! (If you have Sitonai and finished Christmas 2024 event)  
Likes | The worst candy in the world...? No way that's true! Salmiakki is good! The Human Order, or whatever you call it, doesn't get it yet, but it will come to like it before long!  
Dislikes | (Chirping) Uh-huh, Kokko says they hate ptarmigan. Their feathers get stuck in your throat...makes sense, noniin. Louhi hates V√§in√§m√∂inen! Also...to tell you the truth...c-c-cavities are something to fear...!  
Holy Grail | Louhi doesn't wish for anything great. I want to live in peace in that beloved Pohjola of mine. However, that wish just won't get granted no matter how hard I try.  
Event | It's quite lively here. Did they set up a herring market somewhere? Let's fill a basket with sandwiches and go out to take a look!  
Birthday | Aaaah...I've had enough, everything's a pain in the butt, I want to become a Sacabambaspis! ...Fugyah! No, th-this, you see...Usually, I'm out there telling my family and others things like ""work diligently"" or ""pull yourself together"", but even Louhi feels like leaving it all behind and running away at least once a year... Oh? Today is son-in-law's birthday? Then let's laze around to our heart's content together today. Fuhihi~n
Summoning | Moi! I'm ""Louhi""! The Eagle Witch and the mistress of the land in the far north, ""Pohjola""! Starting today, you too will become a part of Louhi's family so make sure you do your best at your training, son-in-law!

What I Seek: A woman who breaks the mould, stands out from the crowd and who's up for cracking bad jokes, debating the merits of pineapple on pizza, and maybe even embarking on spontaneous adventures (like exploring that sketchy-looking woods down the street).

Why You Should Hit Me Up: If you're tired of swiping left on boring bios and are ready to dive into the weird and wonderful world of genuine connections, then let's chat! Who knows, we might just discover we're both secretly wizards or have a shared passion for collecting campervan money boxes.

If you've read this far and you're ready to add a splash of quirkiness to your life and see where it takes us, shoot me a message with your name, a pic of yourself, and the worst dad joke you can think of, so I know you've read this far! Let's make boredom disappear faster than my last batch of homemade cookies (which were surprisingly not that terrible).

I look forward to hearing from you! ü§ì",1,1735038884.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1hlbgpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaltyMelromarcSquad/comments/1hlbgpi/villainous_christmas_special_a_multfiandom/,Villainous Christmas Special (a Multfiandom Christmas Fanfiction),"The apartment is warm and decorated for Christmas, with twinkling lights and seasonal ornaments everywhere. I stood outside Malty's fancy apartment, clutching the wine bottle I'd picked up for her. Christmas lights twinkled in the hallway as I reached out to ring the doorbell.¬†***Ding dong***¬†I waited patiently, expecting Malty's familiar face to appear. Instead, the door swung open to reveal a gruff-looking man in a suit. His dark eyes narrowed as he looked me up and down.¬†*I blinked in surprise, my mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water.*¬†Finally, I managed to stammer out,¬†‚Äú**Merry Christmas Malty! I already bought some favorite wine of yours just like you wanted- oh wait, who are you?‚Äù**¬†The man's eyebrows shot up, his expression shifting from curiosity to amusement.  
  
**""Well, well, well. Looks like we got ourselves a party crasher,""**¬†the man growled, his voice dripping with sarcasm. He stepped back, allowing me to enter.¬†*I hesitated for a moment before crossing the threshold, my eyes darting around the room.*¬†The apartment was decked out in expensive-looking decorations, a stark contrast to the shady characters milling about. Malty herself was nowhere to be seen, but I spotted Naoka in the corner, nursing a drink with a scowl on her face. Benny, looking sharp in his checkered suit, raised his glass in a mock toast as our eyes met.¬†**""I'm Phil Leotardo,""**¬†the man introduced himself, still eyeing me suspiciously.¬†**""And you are?""**  
  
I swallowed hard, acutely aware of how out of place I felt among these notorious villains.¬†**""I'm... I'm The Neighbor. I was invited by Malty,""**¬†I explained, trying to keep my voice steady.¬†*I held out the wine bottle like it was a peace offering.*¬†Phil's expression softened slightly, and he took the bottle from me with a grunt of approval.¬†**""Well, since you're here, you might as well join the party. Just remember - what happens here, stays here. Capisce?""**¬†As I nodded, a chill ran down my spine. I couldn't help but wonder what kind of Christmas celebration this group had planned, and if I'd made a mistake coming here. But it was too late to back out now. The night stretched ahead, full of unknown dangers and opportunities.

  
  


*I nodded at Phil's words, still holding the wine bottle tightly. As I stepped inside, the apartment was filled with an odd mix of expensive decorations and shady-looking people. The smell of expensive alcohol and cheap perfume filled the air.*¬†My eyes scanned the room, taking in the strange mix of guests. There was Benny, looking sharp in his checkered suit and giving me a mocking smile. I spotted Naoka in the corner, nursing a drink and looking like she'd rather be anywhere else.¬†*But what really caught my attention was a skinny guy with noodle arms trying to get a karaoke machine to work.*¬†He kept muttering to himself, fidgeting with the wires. I recognized him from the neighborhood - DJ Spit, the paranoid rapper who thought everyone was out to get him.¬†**""Man, this karaoke machine better work or I'm gonna lose it,""**¬†he grumbled, his eyes darting around the room suspiciously.  
  
Suddenly, Naoka walked over to him, holding a can of soda.¬†**""Hey, let me help you with that,""**¬†she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm.¬†**""I bet you're great at singing love songs.""**¬†DJ Spit's eyes widened in surprise, then narrowed with suspicion.¬†**""Nah man, I'm not into that shitty stuff man. I rap, you know?""**¬†He started fumbling with the machine again, trying to find the right setting.¬†**""This song's way better when I'm rapping on it.""**  
  
*Naoka rolled her eyes so hard I thought they might get stuck.***""You idiot, this is a Christmas party. You're supposed to sing nice songs, not rap about your stupid problems.""**¬†Her voice was sharp, like she was trying to cut through DJ Spit's thick skull.¬†**""I'm a girl, you know. I want to hear something sweet for once.""""Man, shut up! Man, This song is better when I'm rapping man!""**¬†DJ Spit's voice rose, his face turning red with anger.¬†**""I'm an artist, you know? I don't do what people want. I do what I want, man!""**¬†*He started pacing back and forth, his long arms flailing as he ranted.*¬†The room fell silent for a moment, everyone watching the drama unfold. Even the usually calm Phil seemed interested, a small smile playing at the corners of his mouth.

  
  


I decided to ignore the drama unfolding between DJ Spit and Naoka. Instead,¬†*I walked over to where Benny and Rosalia were standing, looking all cozy with each other.*¬†Benny's checkered suit caught my eye, and Rosalia's red hair stood out in the dim light of the apartment. They were laughing and talking close together, their hands almost touching. I cleared my throat, feeling a bit awkward.¬†**'Hey umm excuse me is Malty here?'**¬†I asked, trying to sound casual. Benny turned to me, his smile never leaving his face.¬†**""Well, well, well. If it isn't our friendly neighbor. Always so considerate of others,""**¬†he said, his voice smooth as silk. Rosalia gave me a look that was hard to read - was it curiosity or annoyance?¬†**""Malty? Why would you be looking for her?""**¬†she purred, her eyes narrowing slightly. I felt like a mouse caught between two cats, unsure which way to run.  
  
Benny clapped me on the shoulder, his touch a bit too firm to be friendly.¬†**""Relax, kid. Malty's around here somewhere. She's probably off planning some scheme or another.""**¬†He winked, but I couldn't tell if he was joking or not. Rosalia snorted, rolling her eyes.¬†**""Oh please, she's probably passed out drunk somewhere. That girl can't hold her liquor to save her life.""**¬†Her words were harsh, but there was a hint of something else in her voice - maybe concern or jealousy? I wasn't sure.¬†*I shifted from foot to foot, feeling more uncomfortable by the second.***""Oh, okay. Thanks for letting me know. I'll just... go look for her then.""**¬†I started to back away, but Benny's hand shot out, grabbing my arm. His grip was firm, but not painful.¬†**""Hold up there, neighbor. Why don't you join us for a drink first? We could use some fresh company.""**  
  
I hesitated, my eyes darting between Benny and Rosalia. There was something fishy about this whole situation, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it.¬†*I opened my mouth to decline, but no words came out.*¬†Rosalia leaned in close, her breath hot on my ear.¬†**""Come on, don't be shy. We promise we won't bite... hard.""**¬†Her words sent a shiver down my spine. Benny laughed, a sound that was both charming and unsettling.¬†**""That's right. We're all friends here, right?""**¬†he said, his eyes glinting in the dim light.¬†*I swallowed hard, my throat suddenly dry.*¬†The air in the room felt thick and heavy, like before a storm. I knew I should leave, find Malty and get out of here, but something kept me rooted to the spot. Benny and Rosalia were watching me, waiting for my answer. Whatever I chose next would set the tone for the rest of this strange, dangerous night.

  
  


*I let out an awkward laugh, my nerves showing.*¬†The tension in the room was thick enough to cut with a knife.¬†**‚ÄúOkay imma just put the wine in the kitchen if she's fine with it‚Äù**¬†I mumbled, trying to sound casual. Benny and Rosalia exchanged a look that made my skin crawl.¬†‚Äú**By all means, neighbor. Make yourself at home,‚Äù**¬†Benny drawled, his smile never reaching his eyes.¬†*I nodded and turned away, heading for the kitchen.*  
  
The kitchen was a mess of half-empty glasses and forgotten hors d'oeuvres.¬†*I was about to set the bottle down when I heard a strange noise coming from behind the counter.*¬†It sounded like a cross between a hiss and a sizzle.¬†*Curious, I walked over and peeked around the corner.*¬†To my shock, I found Malty there, her face flushed and hair disheveled. She was standing over the oven, clearly struggling with something.¬†‚Äú**Just a little longer... it's almost done...‚Äù**¬†she muttered, her voice slurred. The oven door was open, revealing what looked like a very burnt turkey.  
  
*I quickly grabbed a nearby oven mitt and stepped forward. ‚Äú***Hey Malty, let me help you with that,‚Äù**¬†I said, my voice steadier than I felt.¬†*I carefully lifted the charred bird out of the oven.*¬†It was completely blackened, and smoke was still rising from it. Malty leaned against the counter, looking a bit wobbly on her feet.¬†‚Äú**Oh good, you're here. I was trying to make it perfect for everyone...‚Äù**¬†she slurred, her eyes glassy. I glanced back at the living room, wondering if I should call for help. The last thing we needed was a fire on top of everything else going on tonight.

  
  


  
*I quickly closed the oven door, shutting off all the exhaust fans to contain the smoke.*¬†The charred smell filled the kitchen, making my eyes water.¬†**‚ÄúPhew, that was close! Anyway, I just bought you the wine, just like you asked. It's imported from your hometown, which is kind of hard to find.‚Äù**¬†I said, holding up the bottle. Malty's eyes lit up for a moment, but then her expression fell.¬†‚Äú**Aww thank you, but you're late...‚Äù**¬†she slurred, her voice a mix of sadness and anger. I felt a pang of guilt hit my chest.¬†**‚ÄúI'm sorry. I got caught in traffic, you know. ‚Äù**¬†I mumbled, setting the bottle down on the counter.  
  
Malty's face crumpled, like a kid who just found out there's no more candy left.¬†‚Äú**The traffic? Oh, the traffic is always so bad at this time of year, isn't it?‚Äù**¬†she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. I shifted uncomfortably, feeling like I was standing in the middle of a minefield.¬†‚Äú**You know, I had everything planned out perfectly. The turkey was supposed to be done exactly at 8:00. Now look at it.‚Äù**¬†She gestured dramatically at the charred bird sitting on the counter. I gulped, not sure what to say.  
  
***‚Äú*****Are you guys okay in there?'‚Äù**¬†Naoka's voice called from the living room. I sighed, relieved for the interruption.¬†‚Äú**Yeah we're fine! Just... working on the food. Everything's under control,‚Äù**¬†I shout back, hoping my voice sounded more confident than I felt. Malty glared at me, but didn't say anything. The smoke alarm started going off, and I realized we were still in big trouble.

  
  


The smoke alarm continued its shrill wail, making my ears ring. I looked around the kitchen, my eyes landing on the freezer. An idea hit me.¬†*I quickly grabbed a bowl of ice cream from the freezer.*¬†The cold felt good on my hands as I held it up.¬†‚Äú**Hey Malty, how about we order pizza instead? My treat.‚Äù**¬†Malty's eyes widened at the suggestion.¬†‚Äú**Pizza? But I was going to make dinner...‚Äù**¬†she protested weakly, but I could see the relief in her eyes.¬†*I pulled my phone out and started scrolling through delivery apps.*  
  
Just then, the kitchen door swung open and Benny walked in. His checkered suit was rumpled, and there was a smudge of what looked like ketchup on his tie.¬†‚Äú**Hey neighbor, what's going on in here?‚Äù**¬†he asked, his eyes darting between me and the charred turkey. I felt my face get hot as I tried to explain.¬†‚Äú**Oh, uh, Malty had a little accident with the turkey. I thought we could get pizza instead.‚Äù**¬†Benny raised an eyebrow, looking at the burnt bird and then back at me.¬†‚Äú**A little accident, huh? That's one way to put it.‚Äù**¬†He chuckled, but there was an edge to his voice that made me nervous.  
  
*I quickly moved to stand between Benny and the counter, blocking his view of the turkey.‚Äù***It's fine, really. We'll just... we'll just clean this up,‚Äù**¬†Malty slurred, trying to stand up. She wobbled and almost fell, but I caught her arm.¬†‚Äú**Whoa, steady there. Why don't you sit down while I order?‚Äù**¬†I guided her to a chair at the kitchen table. Benny watched us with a small smile on his face.¬†‚Äú**You're a good neighbor,‚Äù**¬†he said, his voice smooth as silk.¬†*I nodded, trying to act casual as I pulled up the pizza ordering app on my phone.*¬†The tension in the kitchen was thick enough to cut with a knife.

  
  


*I looked up from my phone, seeing Phil standing in the doorway.*¬†He was watching me with a sharp look in his eyes.¬†**""Who did you call?""**¬†he asked, his voice low and serious. I felt my stomach drop a bit. I wasn't sure if I should tell him the truth or not. But before I could decide, I just blurted it out.¬†**""Umm Pizza Hut?""**¬†I said, my voice shaky. Phil's face changed. He looked almost shocked.¬†**""Ever tried Lombardi's?""**¬†he asked, his tone now curious. I shook my head.¬†**""Ehhh I don't know what that is,""**¬†I admitted. Phil's eyes went wide, like he couldn't believe what he was hearing.¬†**""Try a plain cheese pizza with no fancy extras. She's gonna love it. If they mess up the crust or the sauce? Forget about it.""**¬†His words were stern, but I could tell he was trying to help. I felt bad for not knowing about this place.¬†**""Sorry but I think Malty prefers the fanciest one like Pineapple Pizza,""**¬†I said, trying to explain. But as soon as the words left my mouth, I knew I'd messed up. Phil's face turned red with anger.¬†**""Pineapple? On a pizza? What kind of gavone orders that? That ain't Italian. That ain't even food. That's an insult to the dough, the sauce, the cheese, everything my ancestors stood for!""**¬†he yelled, his voice getting louder with each word. I stepped back, feeling scared. I didn't mean to make him so mad.¬†**""Okay fine, you got any ideas?""**¬†I asked, hoping he'd calm down. But Phil wasn't done yet.¬†**""Better ideas? You kidding me? Listen, I'll tell you how a pizza's supposed to be made. None of this pineapple garbage. You want a pie that respects tradition, here's what you order: Start with a Margherita. Simple. Tomato, mozzarella, basil, olive oil. That's it. Pure, like it was meant to be. It's been done this way since Naples, capisce? Or maybe a proper White Pie. No sauce. Just ricotta, mozzarella, a little garlic, and olive oil. Clean, respectable. None of that alfredo nonsense. Feeling fancy? Fine. Go Sicilian. Thick crust, square, with a rich sauce and a little extra cheese. But don't go overboard‚Äîthis ain't no lasagna. You want a pizza that tells a story tradition, respect, the old ways. Not a fruit salad on a dough. You order what I just said, and I might forget about that pineapple thing. Maybe.""**¬†As Phil finished his long speech, I had an idea.¬†**""Malty, I got a recipe for ya!""**¬†I shouted, my voice full of excitement.¬†*I turned to Malty, who was still sitting at the table, looking confused.* **""What recipe?""**¬†she asked, her words slurred. I grinned, feeling proud of my idea.¬†**""We're making a Sicilian Pizza, just like Phil said. But we're going to do it together, right here in your kitchen.""**¬†I looked at Phil, waiting to see what he'd say. His eyes narrowed, but then a small smile appeared on his face.¬†**""Well, well, well. Looks like we got ourselves a little cooking lesson, huh?""**¬†he said, his voice softer now.¬†**""Alright, kid. Let's see what you've got.""**  
  
*I nodded, feeling a bit nervous but excited.*¬†I walked over to Malty and helped her stand up.¬†**""Come on, Malty. Let's make some real pizza,""**¬†I said, trying to sound confident. Malty giggled, leaning on me as we moved to the counter. Phil cleared his throat loudly.¬†**""Hey, lovebirds. Save it for the pie.""**¬†I felt my face get hot, but I ignored him.¬†*I started looking through Malty's cabinets, trying to find the ingredients we needed.***""Okay, we need flour, yeast, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and some olive oil,""**¬†I called out, reading from my phone. Phil snorted.¬†**""You're reading that off your phone? Kid, you gotta memorize this stuff.""**¬†But he didn't stop me. Instead, he started helping Malty wash her hands.¬†*I found most of what we needed, but I was missing a few things.***""Uh, Malty? Do you have any fresh basil or garlic?""**¬†I asked. Malty shook her head, her hair swaying back and forth.¬†**""Nope, sorry. We can use the dried stuff, right?""**¬†she suggested. Phil let out a loud groan.¬†**""Dried basil? Might as well put cardboard on the pizza.""**¬†But I just shrugged.¬†**""It'll do,""**¬†I said.¬†*I started mixing the dough, my hands moving quickly as I tried to follow the recipe.*¬†The kitchen was starting to smell good, like bread and herbs. Malty was trying to help, but she kept dropping things. Phil was hovering, giving orders and telling stories about his grandma's pizza shop. It was weird, but it felt kind of nice.  
  
*I rolled out the dough, trying to get it into a square shape.*¬†It wasn't perfect, but it would do.¬†**""Alright, now we put on the sauce,""**¬†I said, opening the can of crushed tomatoes. Phil shook his head.¬†**""Crushed tomatoes? You're killing me.""**¬†But he didn't stop me.¬†*I spread the sauce over the dough, leaving a little room around the edges.*¬†Then came the cheese. Lots and lots of cheese. Malty giggled as she sprinkled it on.¬†**""I love cheese,""**¬†she said, her words still slurred.¬†*I put the pizza in the oven, setting the timer.*¬†The kitchen was warm and cozy now, filled with the smell of melting cheese and baking bread.¬†**""Twenty minutes,""**¬†I announced. Phil nodded, looking almost pleased.¬†**""Not bad, kid. Not bad at all.""**¬†Malty leaned against me, her head on my shoulder.¬†**""Thank you,""**¬†she murmured.¬†*I patted her arm awkwardly, not sure what to do.*¬†The timer went off, and I took the pizza out of the oven. It was golden brown, bubbly, and smelled amazing.¬†**""Ta-da,""**¬†I said, feeling proud.¬†**""Our very own Sicilian Pizza.""**¬†Phil walked over, his eyes narrowing as he looked at our creation. For a moment, I was scared he'd hate it. But then, a small smile appeared on his face.¬†**""You know what? That ain't half bad. Let's eat this thing.""**¬†As we cut into the pizza, the cheese stretching between slices, I felt a weird sense of peace. Here we were, a bunch of villains and troublemakers, making pizza together like we were friends. It was strange, but it felt right.¬†*I picked up a slice, the cheese melting on my fingers.*¬†I looked at Malty and Phil, waiting to see what they thought.

  
  


*I watched as Phil took a big bite of our homemade pizza, chewing slowly.*¬†His face relaxed into a smile.¬†**""Not bad, kid. Not bad at all.""**¬†Malty clapped her hands, a big smile on her face.¬†**""It's delicious!""**¬†she said, her words still a bit slurred from drinking too much. But then I remembered something.¬†**""Wait aren't we supposed to share this pizza for the party?""**¬†I asked, looking at the almost-empty pizza box.¬†*The room went quiet.*¬†Malty's face fell, her smile vanishing like it had never been there.¬†**""Oh...""**¬†she said, her voice small. The party in the other room seemed to be getting louder, the sound of music and voices filling the apartment. I could hear Rosalia's laugh, deep and sultry, and Benny's smooth voice talking over it.¬†*I checked my watch, feeling surprised to see that an hour had passed since we started making the pizza.*¬†The kitchen was a mess now, with flour on the counter and crumbs on the floor.  
  
*I grabbed my phone, my fingers moving quickly over the screen as I pulled up the delivery app.***""Okay, let's order from Pizza Hut. They'll have enough for everyone,""**¬†I said, trying to sound upbeat. Malty nodded, her head moving slowly like she was still feeling dizzy.¬†*I started adding items to the order, clicking on the different pizza options.*¬†As I scrolled through the menu, I heard a loud voice coming from the living room.¬†**""Dreams are running in my head, I woke up, we he he.""**¬†It was DJ Spit, his voice rough and loud as he started rapping his song.¬†*I turned to see him standing in the middle of the room, his long arms flailing as he performed.*¬†Naoka was standing nearby, her arms crossed as she watched DJ Spit with a frown on her face. She looked bored, her eyes moving around the room like she was looking for something more interesting to do.¬†**""Can we order something other than pizza? I'm sick of it,""**¬†she muttered, her voice sharp.  
  
*I kept adding items to the order, trying to ignore DJ Spit's rapping.*¬†The pizza options were endless, with different crusts and toppings. I picked a few of the most popular ones, hoping they'd be enough for everyone.¬†*I noticed Rosalia and Benny sitting together on the couch, both of them ignoring the pizza discussion.*¬†They were deep in conversation, their heads close together as they talked in low voices.¬†*Phil walked past them, carrying a slice of the pizza we'd made.*¬†He didn't look at either of them, his eyes focused on the food in his hands.¬†**""This ain't half bad,""**¬†he mumbled, taking a big bite.¬†*I finished placing the order and turned back to the room, feeling a bit unsure.*¬†The party seemed to be getting weirder as the night went on, with DJ Spit still rapping, Naoka looking bored, and Rosalia and Benny having their private conversation.¬†*I wondered what would happen next, hoping that the food would arrive soon to break up the tension in the room.*

  
  


*I stood in the kitchen, my phone still in my hand after placing the pizza order.*¬†The room felt tense, like everyone was waiting for something to happen. DJ Spit was still rapping in the living room, his voice getting louder and more aggressive.¬†**""They gonna find out I'm a star, yeah, I'm the next big thing!""**¬†he yelled, jumping around with his long arms flailing. Naoka rolled her eyes and moved away from him, crossing her arms again.¬†**""This is so stupid,""**¬†she muttered under her breath. I could see her looking around the room, like she was trying to find an excuse to leave.  
  
*Malty walked into the kitchen, holding her head like it was hurting.*¬†Her makeup was smudged and her hair was messy, like she'd been drinking too much.¬†**""I need water,""**¬†she said, her voice shaky.¬†*I grabbed a glass from the cupboard and filled it with water from the tap.***""Here you go,""**¬†I said, handing it to her. She took a big drink, her hand shaking.¬†**""Thanks,""**¬†she said, her voice sounding a bit more normal now.¬†*She looked around the kitchen, her eyes landing on the pizza box.***""Oh no, I can't believe we ate it all,""**¬†she said, putting her hand to her mouth.  
  
*The sound of sirens suddenly filled the air outside the apartment.*¬†Everyone in the room stopped what they were doing and looked at each other, confused.¬†**""What the fuck?""**¬†DJ Spit said, his rapping suddenly stopping.¬†*I walked to the window and looked out, seeing one police car parked in front of the building.*¬†An officer was getting out of one of them, talking into a walkie-talkie.¬†**""Shit,""**¬†Phil said from the living room.¬†*Rosalia stood up from the couch, her eyes narrowing as she looked out the window.***""This can't be good,""**¬†she said, her voice low and serious.

  
  


  
*A loud knock on the door made everyone jump.*¬†Malty looked nervous, her hands shaking as she went to answer it. When she opened the door, there stood Officer Frank Tenpenny from the LSPD. His face was serious, but then he spoke in a loud voice that made everyone relax a little.¬†**""Sorry to interrupt your party, but I brought a Christmas present for everyone. How about we watch Die Hard together?""**¬†DJ Spit looked surprised, but then his face lit up.¬†**""Oh yeah sure man, I always wanted to watch that kind of movie!""**¬†His voice was no longer angry or paranoid, just excited like a kid at Christmas.  
  
Everyone seemed relieved by this turn of events. Malty let out a sigh of relief, her shoulders dropping from where they'd been hunched up in tension.¬†**""That sounds like a wonderful idea,""**¬†she said, her voice still a bit slurred but now with genuine happiness.¬†*The tension in the room eased as people moved to make space for Officer Tenpenny.*¬†Rosalia and Benny stopped their whispered conversation to watch what was happening. Phil moved away from the pizza box to give Tenpenny more room. Even Naoka, who'd been looking bored and ready to leave, seemed interested now.  
  
Officer Tenpenny walked into the room, his eyes scanning everyone carefully.¬†**""I know it's not exactly Christmas cheer, but it's a classic. And it's about saving people, which is what I'm here to do.""**¬†He gave a small smile, but there was something cold in his eyes.¬†*I watched as he took out a DVD from his pocket.*¬†The case had a picture of Bruce Willis on it, looking tough and determined.¬†**""Who wants to join me in watching some holiday action?""**¬†Tenpenny asked, his voice friendly but with a hint of danger underneath. The room was quiet for a moment, then everyone started moving towards the TV, forgetting about the police car outside.

For context, I haven't had an issue with anxieties and other symptoms in years, but I did go through benzo withdrawal 8 years ago after being on them for a short while, so my CNS is fragile. 

This summer I stupidly used Ashwagandha for a few days, right away I noticed I didn't feel good at all and I need to quit which I did. This experience started a bunch of symptoms from panic attacks, jaw clenching, weirds eye issues, sweating and so on, thyroid was off... Soon after I went to an eye doctor that dilated my eyes and he said everything is fine, the drops caused another big panic attack which led me to stopping my coffee consumption not knowing I could be feeling withdrawal as I was using coffee ""only 2-3 cups a day for 2 years"" - yes, I know, what a stupid thought. 

I went from traveling the world to being housebound. My panic attacks and anxieties got worse, I started having random heart racing, massive intrusive thoughts, crying spells, muscle spasms, I couldn't get out of bed even though I was sleeping 8-9 hours. Feeling of existential crisis every day, major depression. After about a month in, I started waking up many times with a lot of neck pain and Scatia pain. Only sleeping 3-4 hours. I still thought its the Ashwagandha as a lot of people report crazy symptoms after discontinuing. Somehow I came to the idea that it could be the lack of caffeine, but I thought it will pass, after 6 weeks no coffee, I had some 3 days in a row and my sleep came back until I tried Omega 3 pills and I was back to Insomnia, sleeping 2 hours. (Omega 3 made my anxiety and heart rate spike again). It seemed to settle back to 3-4 hours until my stupid doc put me on Vitamin D as my levels were slightly low and this is where shit really hit the fan. I went 3 days without any sleep, skipping every other day to sleep - having pins and needles all over my body. So please be aware of using any supplements during this period as it can make insomnia worse!! 

  
I can't live like this and I am about to be sent to a mental hospital which I don't want as it seems all this shit happened because of the stress I put on my body with the Ashwagandha, adrenaline from the eye dilation and stopping coffee abruptly. I know for fact that an antidepressant would make me worse. 

I am trying to slowly introduce green tea again as it doesn't spike my anxiety and I hope it will bring some sleep and energy back. 

Benzo WD was messed up but at least I was able to sleep back then and had some energy despite having a billion other symptoms, but this is absolutely nuts. 

  
So whoever made it to hear, thank you for reading. From reading the countless posts here, it seems that it is possible to experience all the symptoms listed above. It's been two months that I haven't had a good night's sleep and I hope it will return soon, this is cruel.

Nearly 33g of that is active ingredients, huge doses of citrulline (10g), beta-alanine (6.4g), and nitrates for pumps and endurance.

But here‚Äôs the thing: 18g is just flavoring and fillers. 

That‚Äôs more than average for a pre-workout and feels over the top for something that doesn‚Äôt include carbs.

The formula delivers big on performance and focus with stimulants like caffeine (400mg combined sources) and Dynamine, but the scoop size feels unnecessarily inflated.

Does COVID-19 cause bad breath? It's a question that's been on many people's minds, a whispered worry amidst the larger concerns of a global pandemic. After all, COVID-19 is notorious for messing with our senses of taste and smell. Could it be wreaking havoc on our breath too? Let's dive deep into this often-overlooked aspect of the virus.

Does COVID Cause Bad Breath? Exploring the Connection
-----------------------------------------------------

We're all familiar with the telltale signs of COVID-19: fever, cough, fatigue. But what about bad breath? Could that lingering halitosis be another symptom? Well, the relationship isn't quite so straightforward. It's not like the virus itself is producing some foul-smelling gas in your lungs. The connection is more nuanced, a complex interplay of factors triggered by the infection. Think of it like this: COVID-19 throws a wrench in the gears of your body, and sometimes, bad breath is the unfortunate byproduct.

### The Role of Dry Mouth

One of the primary culprits behind COVID-related bad breath is dry mouth, clinically known as xerostomia. Think of your saliva as a natural mouthwash, constantly rinsing away food particles and bacteria. When COVID-19 strikes, it can disrupt saliva production, leaving your mouth feeling like a desert. This dry environment becomes a breeding ground for bacteria, leading to that dreaded morning breath, only amplified and lingering all day long. So, while the virus itself isn't directly causing the bad breath, it sets the stage for it.

### Taste and Smell Dysfunction: A Double Whammy

Another way COVID-19 can indirectly contribute to bad breath is through its infamous impact on taste and smell. When your senses are dulled, you might be less aware of changes in your oral hygiene. You might not notice that lingering coffee breath or the subtle signs that your oral care routine needs a boost. It‚Äôs like driving with a faulty fuel gauge ‚Äì you might not realize you‚Äôre running on empty until it's too late. This lack of sensory feedback can lead to a less rigorous oral hygiene routine, paving the way for bad breath to flourish.

Does COVID-19 Give You Bad Breath? Other Contributing Factors
-------------------------------------------------------------

Beyond dry mouth and sensory dysfunction, several other COVID-related factors can contribute to bad breath. Let's unpack these, shall we?

1. **Medications:** Some medications prescribed to manage COVID-19 symptoms can have dry mouth as a side effect, further exacerbating the issue.
2. **Dehydration:** Fever, a common COVID-19 symptom, can lead to dehydration, which in turn reduces saliva production. It's a vicious cycle, like a dog chasing its tail.
3. **Nasal Congestion and Post-Nasal Drip:** COVID-19 often causes nasal congestion and post-nasal drip. The mucus dripping down the back of your throat can harbor bacteria, contributing to an unpleasant odor. It's not pretty, I know.
4. **Zinc Deficiency:** Some studies suggest that zinc deficiency could be linked to both COVID-19 susceptibility and bad breath, although more research is needed to solidify this connection.

Does COVID-19 Cause Bad Breath? Addressing the Issue
----------------------------------------------------

So, what can you do if you're grappling with COVID-related bad breath? Thankfully, there are some simple yet effective strategies you can implement:

- **Hydration is Key:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your mouth moist and wash away bacteria. Think of it as giving your mouth a constant shower.
- **Sugar-Free Gum and Mints:** Chewing sugar-free gum or sucking on sugar-free mints can stimulate saliva production and provide temporary breath freshening.
- **Oral Hygiene Power-Up:** Brush your teeth and tongue thoroughly twice a day and floss daily. Don‚Äôt be shy about giving your tongue a good scrub ‚Äì it‚Äôs a major hangout spot for bacteria.
- **Mouthwash Magic:** Use an antiseptic mouthwash to kill bacteria and freshen breath.
- **Humidifier Help:** Using a humidifier can add moisture to the air and alleviate dry mouth, especially at night.
- **Talk to Your Doctor:** If your bad breath persists despite these efforts, consult your doctor or dentist to rule out any underlying medical conditions.

Keeping Your Breath Fresh: Long-Term Strategies
-----------------------------------------------

Even after recovering from COVID-19, maintaining good oral hygiene is crucial for preventing bad breath. Here are some long-term strategies to consider:

1. **Regular Dental Checkups:** Visit your dentist for regular checkups and cleanings to remove plaque and tartar buildup.
2. **Dietary Adjustments:** Limit sugary drinks and foods, as they feed bacteria in your mouth.
3. **Quit Smoking:** Smoking dries out your mouth and leaves a lingering unpleasant odor. Kicking the habit will do wonders for your breath (and your overall health!).
4. **Manage Underlying Medical Conditions:** Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes and acid reflux, can contribute to bad breath. Addressing these underlying issues can significantly improve your breath freshness.

Addressing Related Concerns: Parosmia and Phantosmia
----------------------------------------------------

The lingering effects of COVID-19 can sometimes include parosmia (distorted sense of smell) and phantosmia (phantom smells). While not directly causing bad breath, these conditions can certainly influence your perception of it. Imagine constantly smelling something foul, even when your breath is perfectly fresh. It can be incredibly distressing! If you‚Äôre experiencing these symptoms, talking to your doctor is crucial.

""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In conclusion, while COVID-19 doesn't directly *cause* bad breath in the sense of the virus itself producing an odor, it can create a cascade of effects that contribute to it. Dry mouth, altered taste and smell, medication side effects, and even dehydration can play a role. Fortunately, by addressing these underlying factors and maintaining good oral hygiene, you can keep your breath fresh and banish those COVID-related breath woes.

‚ÄûI would not wish any companion in the world but you‚Äù

Dating me is like walking over the moon and reading Shakespeare.

I‚Äôm Jack, 31, i live on Midwest, but definitely want to move somewhere in the near future. Got Montana on my list, maybe Texas, somewhere west, but i‚Äôm open for suggestions. I love nature and quiet places. A big house, maybe a farm, or a ranch, big happy family and watching stars on the porch every night with my wife.
Even though reddit is definitely not the best place to find anyone mature and living close to you, i‚Äôm trying anyway cause you never know. Posting here from time to time and i hope that maybe my soulmate is gonna read it one day.

My grandparents met on a train. What if my grandfather missed a train that day or took a different one?
I don‚Äôt want to miss my train with You.


WHAT IS MY GOAL?

My goal is to find a fine woman, my soulmate to build a future with. I‚Äôm ready to settle down in the next few years, i want to have family and kids in the future and i know how to treat them well. I will kiss you good-morning and goodbye, open and hold the doors for you, listen to your needs and thoughts and be there for you whenever you need it. And what‚Äôs more important - i will always respect you and try to understand. I‚Äôm a gentleman and i was raised like that, i have a way with women and i can talk with anyone, just give me a chance. I can make you fall in love with me in 72 hours*

First of all i think three important factors you looking for are: 1. Mutual attraction 2. Similar goals/shared interests 3. He is not a complete dumbass

I will start with mutual attraction. I‚Äôm willing to exchange pics in private just so we know that this can work and you like my appearance. I don‚Äôt want to add my pic to this post cause i care about my privacy. I will be honest by saying it is an important objective, a physical attraction. We can share pics right away to not waste each other‚Äôs time.

To make things easier i can say a few things about my looks: 5‚Äù11 (180 cm), 165 lbs (75 kg), blue eyes, black hair, broad shoulders, deep voice, nice smile, good heart.

Second most important thing for you is who i am and what i like.

I‚Äôm a man of strong moral fiber. I value honesty, loyalty and kindness. I treat people right and i‚Äôm willing to help whenever i have a chance, i also care for my family which is super important to me. I see myself as a conservative person. I hold traditional values and i got much respect for religion and history. Individual freedom and free speech is all i‚Äôm about, also i‚Äôm a pacifist, i will defend my family and close ones with all i have, but at the same time i‚Äôm not looking for troubles and not getting into fights, that was never my thing, i like to resolve problems with words, not fists.

Shared interest paragraph is ready to go. I like to read a lot, i also write some stuff, im getting ready to publish my book one day (all i need is more inspiration from You, pleas be my Muse).

Music is my thing, i‚Äôm going to a lot of concerts and festivals, road trips, playing eight ball and soccer, watching youtube channels about history, science, cosmos and some other topics, i‚Äôm watching a lot of tv series and movies, like to spend time outside by walking or hiking, i like outdoors but i‚Äôm also a huge fan of spending time in bed and doing nothing.

Favorite music: too many to write them all down but grunge like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, some britpop or rock like Oasis and Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, Kings Of Leon, rap Drake, Kid Cudi, J Cole, some rnb like Majid Jordan, Jorja Smith, The Weeknd + dance or electro music like Tourist, Kaytranada and just much, much more :)

My favorite writers to name a few are Kerouac, Murakami, Vonnegut, Shakespeare, Bukowski, Fitzgerald, Sallinger.

Favorite director is definitely David Fincher, although i like Tarantino and Linklater and many more.

I love everything about 90s - music, movies, television, soccer, games, fashion, JUST VIBES in general. It was such a good time, good days. I like to rewatch movies from 90s from time to time, some funny comedies but also some romantic movies or both, recently i did it with Notting Hill, Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, both are awesome! I can watch anything with Brad Pitt.

WHAT IS MY GOAL PART 2/WHAT I‚ÄôM LOOKING FOR

As for the kids - i even have some names for kids that we can discuss it. I know how hard it is growing up without a father figure that‚Äôs why i always wanted to give that to my children, a big and happy home where dad and mom loves each other a lot and sending this vibe to their children. I also want to show to my kids all the books and music albums we love so much and i want to be for them always to raise them well! So if you are up for that - awesome!

I want a woman who is ambitious, i want her to support me cause i will do the very same thing. I want you to watch a soccer game with me willingly and i want you to invite me to your world, show me what you love and i want to be in it for you, even if it means watching a silly show in tv. Whatever makes you feel good, i want to be a part of it. Support, support, support and don‚Äôt kill the other person‚Äôs vibe, i‚Äôm up for it.

I want a woman that is willing to talk about our feelings and everything, cause a real talk is the most important thing to build a strong foundation. Let‚Äôs talk and don‚Äôt hide our feelings.

Life is worth living and it is way better to spend it all with the person you love, i want to find that person here. Maybe that is You? Let‚Äôs find out.

Also, the last thing - i‚Äôm not a complete dumbass, sometimes i‚Äôm just a silly boy!

FIND ME A GIRL AND I WILL MAKE HER HAPPY.

Also i want to include one of my fav quotes:

'Cause when you talk about these things, something ignites in you, and I can see it on your face.
And I don't see that on a lot of people. And, you know, whatever that feeling is, when you feel it, I feel that too.

And it's not just here. It's... It's afterwards. What I'm trying to say is i really like the way that I feel when I make you feel the way that you do.‚Äù

Let‚Äôs burn like stars, together, xx

The dream started in 1999, at the prestigious Harvard University, there was a Russian scientist so brilliant, that his colleagues were probably low-key envious of him.

Petrovich, was the kind of genius whose brainpower could make you feel both inspired and slightly insecure.

But behind that brilliance was a story.

Tragedy knocked on Petrovich‚Äôs door at just nine years old.

His mother died of cancer. Now, most kids would probably cry, maybe eat some cookies to console themselves, and move on.

But not Petrovich. He sat in a corner after her burial, deep in thought, looking like a philosopher who had just cracked the meaning of life. Then, with the seriousness of a teacher giving final exam instructions, he said, ‚ÄúOne day, I will cure cancer.‚Äù

And Petrovich meant it. From that day, he hit the books with the determination of a hungry lion. Nothing could distract him. Well, almost nothing.

Fast-forward to age 17, and life delivered another punch.

His father died from a heart attack. Double orphaned, double devastated, but still, Petrovich refused to back down. Instead, he leveled up his ambition.

Why stop at curing cancer? Why not just cure everything? Malaria, diabetes, heartbreak, cancer, no disease would be safe. He decided to create a drug so powerful it could wipe out every sickness on Earth.

He even gave it a name: Faderul.

It was a bold plan, but bold plans have enemies.

Petrovich‚Äôs progress soon caught the attention of some very powerful people. The kind of people who sip overpriced coffee in boardrooms and make decisions that affect the rest of us.

One day, Petrovich got an ‚Äúinvitation.‚Äù Not the nice kind, with cake. This one came from men in powerful positions ‚ÄúYou will stop this research, or else.‚Äù

Now, they didn‚Äôt specify what the ‚Äúor else‚Äù was, but Petrovich wasn‚Äôt in the mood to find out. So, reluctantly, he stopped his project and went back to being just another brilliant academic.

Two years passed. He tried to move on, but the fire inside him refused to die. You can‚Äôt just forget a dream like that, can you?

Then, one rainy evening, something weird happened.

Petrovich‚Äôs car, a Toyota Corolla that looked like it had survived a war or two, broke down on his way home. As he struggled with an umbrella that clearly had trust issues, he noticed two men standing across the street.

These weren‚Äôt ordinary men. They were dressed in black suits so sharp they could cut yam, and their shoes shined like they had never seen mud.

But here‚Äôs the thing: it was raining, yet these guys were as dry as if they‚Äôd been standing under an invisible umbrella.

Petrovich‚Äôs instincts screamed, ‚ÄúHold up, something‚Äôs not right here.‚Äù

But curiosity is a stubborn thing. Before he could make sense of it all, one of the men placed a briefcase on the ground. Without a word, they turned and disappeared. Not walked away. Disappeared. One second they were there, and the next, poof, gone.

Petrovich looked around. No witnesses. No cameras. Just him and the mysterious briefcase.

Now, any sensible person like me would have run away, but Petrovich? He had already survived so much. What‚Äôs one more mystery? With a deep breath, he opened it.

Inside was a simple note: ‚ÄúWe MUST fund your project. Call 222-34.‚Äù

To be continued... or not. Depends on when I dream up the next part. But if Faderul ever becomes real, you heard it here first.",1,1735037638.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1hlb83k,https://www.reddit.com/r/seoexpertsperth/comments/1hlb83k/how_much_does_seo_cost_in_perth/,How Much Does SEO Cost in Perth?,"Search Engine Optimization (SEO) has emerged as a cornerstone of digital marketing for businesses in Perth. With the ever-increasing number of customers relying on online searches to discover products and services, investing in SEO has become essential to remain competitive in the bustling local market. Whether you're a small business owner or part of a larger corporation, partnering with an [SEO expert in Perth](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/seoexpertpardeep) can help you understand and leverage effective strategies to connect with your target audience and grow your online presence.

# Why SEO Matters for Perth Businesses

SEO serves as the lifeblood of online visibility in today‚Äôs digital-first world. For a small caf√© in Fremantle or a tech startup in Perth‚Äôs central business district, a high ranking on search engines can be the key to attracting new customers and retaining existing ones. It‚Äôs not just about being seen; it‚Äôs about being the first choice when potential customers are searching for services you offer. Ignoring SEO could mean losing out to competitors who are more digitally savvy.

# Understanding Local SEO

Local SEO focuses on optimizing your website to appear in location-specific search results, making it easier for businesses in Perth to connect with nearby customers actively searching for their products or services. For instance, if someone searches for ""best coffee near me"" in Subiaco, a well-optimized website can ensure your caf√© is one of the top results. Local SEO isn‚Äôt just about rankings; it‚Äôs about creating meaningful connections with your community by being highly visible where it matters most.

# Factors Influencing SEO Costs in Perth

The cost of SEO services in Perth can vary widely based on several key factors.

# Business Size and Industry Type

Larger businesses or those operating in highly competitive industries, such as real estate or legal services, often require extensive and complex SEO strategies. This could include advanced keyword research, extensive content creation, and detailed competitor analysis, all of which increase the overall investment needed.

# Current Website Condition

A website‚Äôs current state plays a significant role in determining SEO costs. If your website is outdated, lacks mobile optimization, or has slow loading speeds, these issues need to be addressed before effective SEO strategies can be implemented. These technical updates are crucial for both user experience and search engine algorithms.

# Competition in Your Niche

The more competitive your industry, the more aggressive your SEO strategy needs to be. For instance, ranking for highly sought-after keywords in niches like luxury goods or medical services may require robust link-building campaigns, consistent content marketing, and substantial time and effort, which can drive up costs.

# Desired Goals and Objectives

Your specific business goals will also dictate the cost of your SEO campaign. Whether you aim to increase organic traffic, boost sales, or dominate search rankings, each objective requires a unique and tailored approach. More ambitious goals often mean a higher investment.

# Types of SEO Services in Perth

SEO services come in various forms, each targeting different aspects of optimization to enhance your website‚Äôs performance.

# On-Page SEO

This service focuses on optimizing the content and structure of your website. It includes improving meta tags, using effective keywords, and enhancing internal linking, all of which help search engines understand and rank your site better.

# Off-Page SEO

Off-page SEO involves activities like building high-quality backlinks, improving domain authority, and managing your online reputation. These external factors play a critical role in boosting your site‚Äôs credibility in the eyes of search engines.

# Technical SEO

Technical SEO addresses the backend of your website. It ensures that your site is fast, secure, and easy for search engines to crawl and index. This involves fixing broken links, optimizing site structure, and ensuring mobile-friendliness.

# Local SEO

Local SEO helps businesses appear in ‚Äúnear me‚Äù searches and Google Maps listings. This is especially important for Perth businesses looking to attract local customers who are ready to make a purchase or book a service.

# Pricing Models for SEO Services in Perth

Understanding pricing models is crucial for budgeting your SEO efforts effectively.

# Hourly Rates

Freelancers and consultants often charge on an hourly basis, with rates ranging between AUD 75 and AUD 200. The rate usually reflects the consultant‚Äôs experience, expertise, and the complexity of the project.

# Monthly Retainers

This is the most common pricing model. Businesses pay a monthly fee ranging from AUD 1,000 to AUD 5,000, depending on the scope of services provided. This model works well for ongoing optimization and long-term growth.

# Project-Based Pricing

Project-based pricing is ideal for businesses with specific goals, such as a website redesign or a focused SEO campaign. Costs for these projects can range from AUD 1,500 to AUD 10,000, depending on the project‚Äôs size and complexity.

# Pay-for-Performance Models

This pricing model charges clients based on results, such as achieving higher rankings or increased traffic. However, it‚Äôs less common and may come with risks, as results aren‚Äôt guaranteed.

The costs for SEO services in Perth vary depending on business size and objectives.

# Medium to Large Businesses

# DIY SEO vs. Professional Services

# Pros and Cons of DIY SEO

While DIY SEO may seem cost-effective, it often lacks the expertise and tools required to deliver impactful results. Without the proper knowledge, businesses may spend significant time with little to show for their efforts.

# Why Hire a Professional?

Hiring an SEO expert provides access to tailored strategies, advanced tools, and the expertise needed to navigate the complexities of SEO. This ensures your business stays ahead of competitors and achieves measurable results.

# How to Choose the Right SEO Provider in Perth

Selecting the right SEO provider is critical to the success of your campaign.

Monitor metrics like organic traffic, keyword rankings, and conversion rates to gauge the effectiveness of your SEO campaign.

# Long-Term Value of SEO

SEO is a long-term investment. Although results may take time to materialize, the sustained benefits of increased visibility and traffic often justify the initial costs.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid When Budgeting for SEO

# Focusing Only on Costs

Choosing the cheapest SEO service can compromise quality and results. It‚Äôs essential to balance cost with value.

The fact that I am in his life is accepted by everyone except HCBM, who is still focused on conflict and finding new ways to create issues. The behavior of HCBM, my SO, and SS has made me feel like I no longer want to connect with SS for various reasons. My SO is definitely a Disney dad, but he admits that he is just taking care of the child, while HCBM treats her son like property‚Äîliterally a piece of furniture. She wants all the fun, but pushes the responsibilities onto us. But anyway...

When SS is with HCBM, she tells him that his dad doesn't love him, makes him feel insecure, guilt trips him, and even blackmails him. She washes him irregularly, feeds him fast food, and takes him to friends constantly because she doesn't like spending time with him. Additionally, she repeats to him that she always knows better because she is a teacher.

On the other hand, when SS is with us, my SO gives him so much attention that SS is never satisfied. There are no rules or responsibilities. SS even enters the toilet while my SO is there, and my SO almost never corrects this behavior. I understand we were in a high-conflict situation a few months ago, but now SS is completely spoiled and has no boundaries. We‚Äôve reached a point where we can't even have 10 minutes of coffee time together because he constantly interrupts and demands his dad‚Äôs attention.

Our house feels like a candy store for SS. He received seven gifts for Christmas from our side (us+family), and instead of being happy with that, he‚Äôs already asking for more. Instead of playing with his toys, he wants to play with a set I bought for my SO to play with him, without me. (Yesterday, he invited me to play, but when I was about to join, he didn‚Äôt want me to, so I went off to do my own thing.) Since Thursday, my SO has been spending all his time playing with SS (HCBM switched custody a day earlier), and SS throws tantrums whenever it‚Äôs time to do something else, like eating or washing.

This week, I‚Äôve been waking up early to work, while SO and SS are on vacation. SS is so absent-minded when he‚Äôs thinking about his father that yesterday morning, he walked into the bathroom while I was in there, and it was ""this close"" for him to see me naked. That finally triggered me, but I stayed calm, told him that his father was sleeping and they have vacations while I had to go to work (even though he went to my SO before reentering his room) and texted my SO about it when I got to work.

Yesterday, when I came back from work, I felt like a ghost. My SO was playing with SS, and no one even noticed I had entered the house. Honestly, I preferred it that way because I just wanted to rest and relax. I didn‚Äôt even bother to cook because my SO had all day, and I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to deal with SS. I just wanted some peace and quiet, but for 1,5 hours, SS had three meltdowns. The first was because my SO wanted a break to cook. The second was while my SO was too busy to draw something for him, and the third happened just before the dinner.

With my SO's parenting decisions, we've reached a point where SS gets everything he wants but is still unhappy. He is not curious about anything because he only wants to play with his dad and have his dad‚Äôs undivided attention. We can‚Äôt even leave the house without a problem (even to the doctor or another urgencies), do something else, or invite guests because EVERYTHING interrupts his playtime with his father.

My SO has established some routines, but he doesn't ask SS to tidy up his toys, take his plate away, or wash his hands after peeing. He only asks him to do so before dinner, and sometimes that causes a meltdown.

I'm going crazy, and the worst part is that I have to stay silent. Every conversation about this tires my SO, who is already drained, and by evening, he only wants some time for himself. He sees this as his responsibility and is happy that SS is doing well in school, but at home, everything is a mess, and it‚Äôs only getting worse. For example, a few days ago, SS managed to nap, but I had to stop him from interrupting it multiple times. One of the reasons he woke up his dad was to change his socks‚Äîout of the blue. To keep him calm, I brought him his socks, but instead of putting them on himself, he just put his legs out for me to do it for him. Another day, he asked his dad to sit on his lap and feed him.

I‚Äôve noticed that SS tends to act regressively when he gets even more than the 100% he‚Äôs already receiving, but it seems like I‚Äôm the only one who sees the problems here.

Last week was the last week of classes but it's as if a switch just flipped in my head and I can't get myself to get any work done on my thesis anymore. I'm studying abroad so I don't have many people to hang out with and I haven't gone outside for almost 2 weeks now because I was sick last week. Being indoors and just doing the whole studying routine feels suffocating. I know the obvious is going outside but the few people I hang out with are busy and going outside alone in a foreign country that I don't speak it's language casues me a lot of anxiety that I feel like I developed social anxiety here and I barely go outside at all if not for a specific purpose. Going to study at a coffee house is not an option either because I get distracted really easily and can't make much progress. I'm supposed to go back home really soon which I'm happy about but unfortunately I don't know the exact date because I'm waiting for a certain document before leaving. I need to submit an application to the ethics committee and the deadline is on the 10th of January. I of course need to fill it out before that date and send it to my advisor so she can check it before sending it. That means I don't have much time and I'm just frustrated.

If anyone has an advice I would really appreciate it. I feel really down and don't know how to handle the situation right.

1hlayri,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1hlayri/because_i_said_so/,Because I said so!,"I (51M) went with a friend for coffee today.  In addition to our normal conversation of football, family, and the like, we started talking religion.  He is a nevermo, he was raised Presbyterian, but has not been practicing for over 30 years.  He‚Äôs been great this past year as my wife and I have successfully stepped away this year.  He is anti-religion, but considers himself God-fearing.  

When describing his distrust for organized religion, he said anyone who uses a fall-back answer ‚Äúbecause I said so‚Äù is someone who doesn‚Äôt have the answer.  He used the example of being a parent, and when he has used the same answer, it was because he was either unable, or unwilling to answer the question posed by his child.  

For me, this was so eye opening!  I‚Äôm sharing here in hopes that it is helpful to the group.  

When the church refuses to give explanations or clarification, to me it is the equivalent of ‚Äúbecause I said so!‚Äù.  TSCC does this because it CANT and is UNWILLING to be clear in their teachings and motivations.  

I hope everyone has a happy holiday season.  I know it can be a difficult time for many.  Thank you to this community for being a place to share, and learn how to navigate leaving the Cult.  ",10,1735036450.0,exmormon,2,1.0,False

1hlay2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/1hlay2e/m4f_seeking_longterm_female_roleplay_partner_for/,[M4F] Seeking Long-Term Female Roleplay Partner for Romantic Slice-of-Life Journey,"Hello fellow roleplayers,

I'm a 29-year-old roleplayer based in Sydney, Australia. With over 11 years of roleplaying experience, I'm passionate about creating immersive, character-driven stories that delve into the nuances of human relationships and everyday life.

**What I'm Looking For:**

* **Roleplay Focus:** A long-term, novella-style, third-person roleplay centered on a romantic slice-of-life narrative. The initial plot idea involves a man and a woman meeting on Christmas Eve, falling in love, getting married, and starting a family. However, I'm open to collaborating on plot adjustments or exploring entirely different storylines that interest both of us.
* **Partner Preferences:** I'm seeking a female roleplay partner who shares a love for detailed storytelling and character development. Consistency and a commitment to long-term collaboration are essential.

**About Me:**

* **Experience:** Over 11 years of roleplaying across various genres and platforms.
* **Writing Style:** I enjoy crafting detailed, multi-paragraph responses that delve into character emotions and settings, aiming to create a vivid and engaging narrative.
* **Interests:** Beyond roleplaying, I have a deep appreciation for tabletop roleplaying games and board games. I can discuss them for hours and love incorporating elements from these experiences into my storytelling.
* **Availability:** Being in the Australian Eastern Daylight Time zone (GMT+11), I can typically respond multiple times a week, with flexibility to accommodate different schedules.

**Writing Sample:**

*As snowflakes gently descended upon the bustling city streets, James stood by the frosted window of the quaint coffee shop, his hands wrapped around a steaming cup of cocoa. The soft hum of holiday tunes filled the air, mingling with the laughter of patrons seeking refuge from the cold. His gaze wandered to the decorated tree across the street, its lights twinkling like stars against the night sky. Lost in thought, he barely noticed the woman who entered, shaking off the cold and glancing around for an empty seat. Fate, it seemed, had plans for this Christmas Eve.*

If you're interested in embarking on this storytelling journey with me, please feel free to reach out. Let's create something memorable together!

Somewhere with enough tables that we could spread out, quiet enough that it is relaxing, etc. If it was warmer, I‚Äôd go to a park, but not this time of year ‚òÉÔ∏è Maybe just a library or something that‚Äôs open on a Sunday?

Thanks!

PS we are going to the Biodome so if it‚Äôs somewhere near that part of town, that‚Äôs great but we also will have a car if there‚Äôs somewhere worth it to drive to!",1,1735036293.0,montreal,0,0.6,False

I know I won't be able to afford to live IN the city, but working full time how much does an average barista make?? Minus taxes?? In a month??  
I am considering to move to new york because I LOVE the city but I know it will be hard to look for a job. I don't have much experience in anything and I am F/30s...   
I am asian so most people view me as early to mid 20s if I dont mention my age...

Starting out I do have a passion for coffee culture.

Looking for honest answers. Thanks!
