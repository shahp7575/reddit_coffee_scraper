I offer you this list as a balm for your troubled soul. Things are terrible, but good things are still happening. Hang on to them as you would a life preserver in troubled waters.

Here's what worked and what failed,"I was tired of being terrified every time I saw a woman I wanted to meet. The racing heart, sweaty palms, and inevitable regret of another missed opportunity. So I set myself a challenge: talk to at least one new woman every single day for a year. Not for dates or numbers, just to overcome my crippling social anxiety.

Day one was a disaster. I spent four hours at a coffee shop working up the courage to ask a simple question about a book someone was reading. When I finally approached, my voice cracked like I was thirteen again. She was kind, answered briefly, then put her headphones back on. I counted it as a win simply because I didn't pass out.

Around day thirty, something unexpected happened. I was making small talk with a woman at a grocery store when she suddenly asked why I seemed so nervous. Instead of making up an excuse, I told her the truth that I was challenging myself to overcome social anxiety by talking to new people every day.

""That's actually really brave,"" she said. ""Most people just stay comfortable and wonder why nothing changes.""

Her response shifted something fundamental in my perspective. I had been viewing these interactions as performances where I needed to appear confident, interesting, and attractive. But authenticity, even nervous authenticity, created more connection than any practiced line ever could.

By the three-month mark, I noticed patterns emerging. The conversations that flowed naturally weren't the ones where I had the perfect opener or witty comment. They were the ones where I noticed something genuine about the person and expressed curiosity about it. A uniquely patterned scarf led to a convers.

The six-month point brought my biggest lesson. I was talking with a woman at a bookstore about our shared taste in authors when she casually mentioned her girlfriend. In the past, I would have felt defeated, all that courage ""wasted"" on someone unavailable romantically. But I found myself continuing the conversation with undiminished interest. I realized I had been unconsciously viewing women as either potential dates or non-entities. This challenge was teaching me to value connection for its own sake.

Around month nine came the hardest period. The novelty had worn off, and some days felt like pure obligation. On day 273, exhausted after work, I almost broke the streak. But in the elevator of my apartment building, I complimented a neighbor on her unusual earrings. That thirty-second exchange reignited why I started this, these small moments of human connection were adding texture and possibility to every day.

By the final month, talking to new women no longer felt like a challenge but like a natural extension of moving through the world. The last day of my year-long experiment, I realized I had spoken to three different women without even counting them for my challenge. What had been a forced daily task had become as natural as breathing.

The woman who made the deepest impression on me was someone I met around day 320. After a brief conversation about the farmers market we were both browsing, she looked at me thoughtfully and said, ""You know what's nice about talking to you? You seem interested in what I'm saying, not just waiting for your turn to speak.""

Little did she know that a year earlier, I would have been too focused on my own anxiety to truly listen to anyone. The daily practice hadn't just made me more comfortable approaching women, it had taught me to be present once the conversation began.

The most profound transformation wasn't becoming smooth or confident with women. It was recognizing that these weren't ""approaches"" at all, they were moments of human connection. I stopped seeing women as intimidating others and started seeing them as simply people, each with their own stories, struggles, and perspectives.

If you struggle with social anxiety around the opposite sex, the solution isn't better techniques or more courage. It's regular, consistent exposure that transforms the extraordinary into the ordinary. It's realizing that behind the anxiety is a simple truth: we're all just humans hoping to be seen and heard by one another, even if just for a moment in a coffee shop, talking about a book that changed our lives. Don't be afraid of women. They're all people like us too. Talk to them, old or young. And you'll realize your fears were lying to you.

Realizing women are actually just people really made a difference in my mindset and life. I still struggle sometimes but it's definitely much better.

Over the last two years it's been getting progressively worse. I have no car (working on getting my lisence) so I have to walk everywhere. I used to be able to go out, go to the cinema, coffee, errands etc if I watched my mood in the morning. If I'd eaten, drank water, had no coffee, slept well the night before and was in a good place in my cycle. For the last year that hasn't made a difference. Outside feels so scary. I pushed myself to go into town because it was super neseccary, I was half way into town and had a full body panic attack so intense and so sudden that I couldn't stop shaking. I had to get a taxi right back home and I wasn't sure I'd even make it home (felt like I was going to die). I've had panic attacks everywhere, even in the Dr's while waiting to see my Dr for antidepressant prescription. I've cancelled every single thing I've had appointments for or plans for. The other morning I went to walk my kids to school and had a panic attack. This feels like the end for me. If I can't get my kids to school, isn't this the end of the line? 

  
I feel so upset and in pain, I've missed out on so much with my kids. Their dad takes them everywhere, I've missed out on memories and everytime he takes them off somewhere fun I sit and cry alone. 

  
THE thing is, I've tried nearly everything. I'm on antidepressants, the Dr will mo longer give valium as they're phasing it out in Ireland apparently, I've tried counselling (when I was able to make it into town to do so), I've tried CBT, I've tried exposure therapy, EDMR... You name it! Nothing seems to help or work. The full body panic attacks come and no amount of breathing, grounding or talking to myself works. Nothing works until I get back home inside my house. 

  
I feel absolutely doomed. I really don't know what else to do. I need to know there's some light at the end of the tunnel, please. I also got my bloods done recently, even getting to the Dr's for that was so hard. My bloods came back fine, vitamins etc. I feel so alone and so scared. 

  
Please be kind.

1qn17av,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorwriters/comments/1qn17av/first_story/,First Story,"Hey I just started writing my first full story. And I just wanted some thoughts on the first chapter.  







The wall is moving. It’s slowly sliding back. I try to wrap my head around what is happening. But any attempt to rationalize this, ends when it hits me.                                                                                                                                     The stench. It makes my eyes water. Like something has been rotting in there far too long. Wet. Mushy. Bloating. My hands shoot to my mouth to keep myself from throwing up as my stomach twists. Hard enough to force a pained whimper out of me. A burning sensation invades my throat through my nose. Burnt Petroleum.   
 As the wall moves back further I can see the source of the foul smell. A gory, tangled mass of copper wires, computer parts, and metal rods pulsing like veins. Inch by agonizing inch I stare at the impossible situation unfolding right before me. The bloody metal amalgamation starts to move. Its movements are snake-like. The wires convulse, like they have finally come back to life. I scream in terror when I hear a deep , uncanny voice shaking my entire being.  
 ""K T K F M S P B J D S J U H E M W""  
 The sound shakes me hard enough to the point where I can barely keep my balance. I scramble back on the bed, trying to create as much distance between me and this thing. I don’t know what it´s trying to tell me if it is trying to tell me anything at all. The words turned into a deep rumbling that seemed to only hit me, not the room.This has to be a dream. I pinch myself and...  
 Dread.  
 I feel it but not the sharp pain I was expecting. It was a dull pain traveling through my whole body. The wall halts as if it hit something. That's when I hear the deep grumbling turning into laughter.  
  
  
  


""PUNISH""  
  
  
  


I shoot up in a cold sweat, screaming bloody murder, my mind blurry. I look around, barely seeing my own sweat-drenched hands. I scream again when I feel a hand on my shoulder. Its warmth feels like scalding hot water against my skin. I whip my head in panic, calming down a little when I realize it ' s him. "" Alex, are you okay? What happened? Did you have a nightmare? "" Will asks. His eyes scan my body as if he’s checking if I’m hurt. I don 't say anything, just falling into his arms, finally feeling the warmth that I so desperately needed. Only now am I fully realizing how cold I felt. He wraps his arms around me. ""Come on bae you can tell me“ He whispers softly into my ear. I rest my head in the crook of his neck, taking in his scent -home . "" Sorry, I just had a nightmare. I was so terrified and-"" my heart's still racing from the nightmare . Before I can say another word, he shuts me up with a kiss. A kiss that is soft and reassuring. My breathing finally calmed down to match his. When he pulls back, I finally get a good look at his face - a warm smile. I can ' t help but blush. A smile only I get to see.  
 ""Do you feel better? "" he asks, his voice still raspy from just being woken up. I nod, all the stress and worries gone. He smiles at me. "" Can I leave you alone for a second? I got to pee? "" I nod, and he gets up, leaving the door open. Now all alone, I feel this weird feeling again. I first noticed it a few weeks ago. Whenever I'm all alone in this house, I feel like I'm being watched. Not every time, but now and then. I could swear that I was being watched or that I could hear footsteps where there couldn't be any. I usually ignore it, but this weekend it was different . His parents are out of town, and it almost feels like something is still here with us. I tried to talk with Will about it, but he just laughs telling me how cute I look when I 'm scared and that I shouldn't worry. The house is old and makes weird sounds. But he has lived here for 18 years, and nothing bad has ever happened. I pick up my phone and go on Instagram to distract myself. What's taking him so long? I feel his warmth leaving me. I grab his blanket instinctively,to remind myself he’s still here. I notice something in the corner of my eye. I look up , not seeing anything. I look back down at my phone . Then again, there was something weird. Then I saw it. The open door was swinging. I stare at it for a few seconds, waiting to see if something was going to happen, but nothing. I shrugged . This house is older than my parents and lopsided. So the door moving is nothing weird; it happens all the time. When I hear the bathroom door opening, I hear his footsteps walking back. I put my phone back down and lay down again. I hear him closing the door. He got back into bed, wrapping his arm back around me, pulling me close to him. I get closer, desperate for his warmth. "" Good night, Alex. I love you. I'm here, so you have nothing to worry about ,"" he whispered into my ear after kissing my neck tenderly. ""I love you too,"" I say while yawning . Just as I was falling asleep, I hear what sounded like another door closing. Before my mind can begin to wander I'm being pulled back into sleep wrapped in his arms .  
  
  


I shift , slowly waking up. I try to stretch my arms without opening my tired eyes when I bump into something warm. I open my eyes , seeing Will already up, sitting with his back against the headboard. He looks down at me with a warm, inviting smile. "" Hey, babe, you finally up? "" he asks in his low, raspy morning voice. I look up at him, his hair still messy, dark circles under his eyes courtesy of him working more the last few weeks, and his ever-so-slightly toned bare chest. I lose myself in his warm, dark blue eyes. He leans down, giving me a quick kiss on the lips. I smile, enjoying the feeling of waking up and already feeling his love. It takes me a few seconds to realize that he ' s been watching me sleep. ""How long have you been watching me sleep , you creep? "" I ask, jokingly slapping his arm, making him laugh.

"" Long enough to know that you don't like my walls .""

I laugh nervously but my mind is racing. ""Yeah, they could use some decorations. Maybe I'll get you a painting and a few posters for our anniversary."" I try to joke, pushing my thoughts aside. He smirks at me, ""Sorry, Mister Interior Designer."" I sit up and look at him with my best puppy eyes. ""Can you please make me some coffee, please? "" He laughs, God, how I love him. “ How could I say no to a face like this?"" he sighs and gets up. For a second my mind begins to wander. Did I tell him about the Nightmare, I can't remember. Maybe I was talking in my sleep. Or did I just forget again. It doesn't matter, I know it was a joke. I think back to last night. It was horrible. I was alone. I was so cold.  
  
  
  
  


Will laughs softly, eyes glued to the TV. We’ve been watching some Reality Tv slop for most of the day. Only taking a break when my stomach started rumbling. I wanted to cook with Will together, but he told me to stay in bed. He wanted to treat me like a prince. I take a last bite from my pizza and set it aside. He gets up to smoke. I put my headphones on by habit. I love music.  
 I’m brought back from my trance of listening to music when he taps my shoulder. I flinch and throw my phone to my side. "" Jesus, Will, don ' t scare me like that. "" He laughs as I glare at him. "" If you ' d turn off noise canceling, you could hear me coming back inside. "" I look up, his cheeks ever so slightly red from the cold outside. He leans down to kiss me. I deepen it, loving the taste, the taste of nicotine. He smiles into the kiss and breaks it. "" Why do you always kiss me like we haven' t seen each other in months when I come back from smoking? "" I smile at him. "" I just want to make the most of the time we have together; you know I have to leave today. "" He gets back into bed and hugs me. ""I know, but next time we have each other for a whole week. "" I can ' t wait. I still have my chemistry exam next week and after that, a couple of presentations. But in two weeks, I can escape all that for a whole week. The thought of just the two of us and no one else makes me smile.

Another two hours go by, and he gets up to smoke again. I realize that I haven ' t even left his room the whole time that I’ve been awake. He brought me my coffee, lunch, snacks, and water. I like it; whenever I ‘m with him, I never have to do anything. I decided to finally get up and use the bathroom. I text him that I ' m going to the bathroom so he doesn’t ' t wonder where I went and put it back down on his desk.

While washing my hands, I catch a quick glance at myself in the mirror. I realize how long my hair has really gotten. I brush it out of my face; it ' s a dirty blonde, the cut barely resembling anything close to what I had done months ago. I keep inspecting my face; I really don ' t like my face shape. It’s so round, not fat, just naturally round. It still makes me insecure thinking about it.  He could do so much better.                                                        Thinking about that always hurts me . He tells me every day how much he loves me and that I look perfect. Still, I hate mirrors. I suddenly noticed something weird. I couldn't quite put my finger on what it is. Just a feeling at first, but then I see it. One of the white tiles looks weird. Not broken, not discolored, or a different tile entirely. Just weird. I keep staring at its reflection, studying its every detail : the shape, color, material. I compare it to the others , and I know something is wrong with it , but I can ' t see what it is. I turn around to look at it up close, and nothing. It ' s just another of the white tiles. And just as fast as that feeling hit me, just as fast did it leave. I shake my head and dry my hands.  
 When I get back to his room, he looks up from his phone . ""Everything OK?"" he asks.  I look at him confused. ""Yeah, why are you asking? I was just peeing for like five minutes ; sorry that I took so long."" His expression changes to worry. ""Alex, you were in there for like 30 minutes. I tried to call you, but you left your phone back here, so I guessed that the food yesterday messed up your stomach.""  I freeze in my step. "" What? 30 minutes? You have to be joking. I would ' ve noticed if I took that long. "" He says something, but my head completely tunes him out. How? I peed, washed my hands, looked at myself, and then at that tile. It couldn't have been more than 5 minutes max.I pick my phone back up to check that he’s not joking. And no. How can this be?  
 Then something else hits me. My train. Shit ! ""What time is it?"" I ask him frantically . He looks at his phone. ""Like five fourty . "" Panic hits me immediately. ""Why didn't you call me or say anything? You know my train leaves at six twenty, and it takes like thirty minutes to get to the station. I still need to pack everything up!"" He looks at me slightly annoyed. ""Sorry, forgot . I'm not your manager."" I glare at him but choose to ignore his comment. I quickly pack up everything and get dressed. Ten minutes later, the two of us are leaving.  
 While he locks the door, I look at the house again, thinking to myself that I'll be back in two weeks. And for a whole week. Looking at the house now, all dark, I can ' t shake the feeling of being watched . No. Of something being wrong? No. Nothing actually happened; just my mind playing tricks on me like a nightmare. Still, I always get this feeling like there's something evil in there. I hear the lock clicking into place. I shake my head and ignore the feeling. It's just an old creepy house that was built like seventy years ago. And you spoiled brat should be grateful to be here. We rushed to the train station, not talking at all. We got there just in time, my train leaving in two minutes . I look at him and hug Will tightly. I hate saying goodbye like this ; we never kiss. "" Goodbye, Alex, I love you. Call me when you get home, okay? "" He smiles at me. I smile back, "" I will, I love you too, Will. I can ' t wait to see you again. "" He nods and smiles, "" Me too,"" he whispers. I get on the train and see him walking away. My heart's already aching. I put on my headphones and start listening to music. This was a great weekend, I think to myself. I can't wait to see him again.

My mind starts to wander when I remember his expression when saying goodbye. It was bittersweet like always. But there was something in his eyes. Something I haven’t seen.

I’m not into the performative formal date vibe, the roster nonsense, or anything that feels like a game. I just want something slow, simple, and real.

I’m not really a big going-out person. I connect best with real conversation, consistent effort, and actually building something over time.

My ideal relationship is being each other’s person. Calling, texting, sharing every small detail we find interesting, sending random stuff throughout the day, and actually feeling close. Then spending time together watching movies and shows, playing video games, cooking something simple, coffee(I don’t even really like coffee lol) and walks, chill nights in, lowkey weekends. The simple stuff that makes feelings build naturally.

I’m drawn to the quieter homebody type: kind, loyal, low-drama, supportive, relationship-minded. If you want one person and you actually mean it, that’s exactly what I’m looking for too.

Graveyard shift. 3:17 a.m. Level B-West, sub-basement. Three years, same forty-minute loop. Fire doors. Card readers. Elevators not jammed open. Routine. Boring. Soul-eating.

Until it wasn’it.

Turned the corner on sub-level 4. Froze. Yellow emergency strips painted everything sick. The stairwell was wrong. Railings bent in, steps stretched out, more than seventeen. I counted. Nineteen. Twenty-one. Too many.

Just the angle, and I told myself. Just the light. Double shift chewing at my brain.

Then I heard it.

Not footsteps. Not exactly.

Soft, wet scrape from below. Like feet peeling off wet linoleum. Drag. Pause. Drag. Closer. Never a rhythm. I froze. Radio in my hand, dead weight. Who would I call? Facilities locked up. The supervisor is probably snoring upstairs. Whatever was down there, it didn’t want company.

I backed up one step. The scrape stopped instantly.

Dead silence.

Then, very faintly, I heard a low, wet exhale. Not a sigh. More like someone trying to remember how to use their lungs.

Flashlight shaking in my hand. I pointed it down. The beam caught a long, dark yellow smear on the landing. Fresh paint, but wrong. It moved. Rippled. Something down there, breathing.

I didn’t wait to see what came next.

I ran. Up the stairs. Lungs burning, boots slamming. Rail too cold, slick with something. Didn’t look back. If I did, the stairs would stretch. That thing would be closer.

Slammed into the sub-level 3 fire door. Panic bar clanged. It opened. Thank God. I stumbled into the corridor. Beige walls. Lights working. Old coffee stink from the break room.

The door slammed shut behind me. I leaned hard, chest heaving.

From the other side came one last sound.

Not scraping this time.

A single, deliberate knock.

Patient. Polite.

Like someone asking to be let back in.

I didn’t open the door.

I didn’t go back down there for the rest of the shift.

But sometimes, when the building goes dead quiet, and I’m alone in the security office, I hear it again.

Many of you might know us from our truck, **Muse Coffee**, where we’ve been serving the community from our window. Today, we’re taking a huge leap. We are officially working on opening a brick-and-mortar shop, which will make us the first Black-owned coffee shop in East Austin.

East Austin has such a rich, vibrant history, but as the neighborhood changes, we want to ensure there is a space that honors that legacy. a ""third space"" where everyone feels welcome, represented, and caffeinated.

We’ve secured a location, but as a small, independent team, the ""hidden"" costs of permits, equipment, and historical building requirements are hitting us all at once. We are determined to open these doors for the neighborhood, but we need a little help to cross the finish line.

**How you can help:**

1. **Donate:** Even $5 helps us buy a brick, a chair, or a bag of beans.
2. **Share:** If you can’t donate, please share this with your East Austin neighbors.
3. **Visit:** We still have the truck running! Come say hi and see the vision.

**The link to our journey:** [https://gofund.me/5e37656a4](https://gofund.me/5e37656a4)

We aren’t just building a business; we’re building a piece of East Austin history. We can't wait to host you all in our new home.

Honestly I haven’t noticed much, never had huge side effects, and never got the feeling of “not being hungry.” It wasn’t a miracle drug like I thought it would be in terms of speed to results, BUT, it definitely changed my relationship with food.

1qn0t3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1qn0t3s/snow_parking_in_neighborhoods_in_1978/,Snow parking in neighborhoods in 1978,"I had lived in Boston for a number of years and knew about the time-­‐honored tradition in the neighborhoods of staking out a parking space in the winter, often many weeks before the first flakes would start to fall. So in the fall of 1977 I found myself living on a small street in Brighton, a neighborhood made up of primarily two and three family houses.

In October people started putting out their markers, chairs, garbage cans, perhaps a milk crate. Some families had elevated the ‘marking of the space’ to an art form, there was a beautiful hand painted sign across from my home ‘The Smith’s park here’. The sign had a border of hand painted flowers.

I saw this activity, so I put out my metal garbage can in front of the two family home where I and a roommate were renting the first floor. The tenants on the second floor did not own a vehicle so having the one spot in the front would be perfectly adequate. There was a three family house next to ours, and there was a young married couple living in the third floor apartment. The husband would quite often move my garbage can and park in the spot it was holding. It had not snowed yet so I really did not care at that point.

One day in November I walked out of my house to find that my old Plymouth had a flat tire. I jacked it up, removed the wheel and rolled it down the street to a service station to get it fixed. It would not be ready till the next day so I hopped on a bus to get to work, the 4:00PM to 2:00AM dispatching shift at the Boston Cab Company.

Upon returning home at 3:00AM I found a note on the windshield of my car. It was from the third floor guy of the house next door, the guy who had been moving my garbage can.  The note basically said

“I know you jacked up your car on purpose so that no one else could have the spot, and you have been trying to reserve this spot. But be aware that the street is a public place and you cannot reserve a spot in a public place. If you want to discuss this, feel free to call me at 555-­‐1234. “

So I called him. Silly me, I guess he did not mean ‘call me at 3:00AM’. My bad.

Fast forward a few weeks, I was filling in on the day shift and it is snowing, snowing hard. As I am driving home I am wondering where I will be able to park. Well, lo and behold, as I reach my home I see that the spot in front of my home is shoveled out and there is a bright orange cone in the middle of it. “Hey, cool, a spot!” I thought. I moved the cone, pulled into the spot, went into my apartment, cracked open a beer, turned on the TV and put my feet up.

About 10 minutes passed and there was a knock at my door. I had an assumption whom it might be, so I got up, picked up the aforementioned letter and opened the door. Yep, it was third floor guy. He seemed upset and told me that my car was parked in his spot. I looked past him at my car and said “Nope, I am not in your space, I am parked in the street which is a public place. I then proceeded to read the

part of his letter where he had spelled out the fact that spots cannot be reserved on a public street, stopped and said ‘Oh, I don’t have to read this to you, you wrote it.

He turned a rather interesting shade of red, then purple, and then pulled the screen door open and lunged at me. His wife was behind him and started pulling him back while he screamed that it was indeed his spot. I closed my door.

Apparently his wife was able to calm him down and I did not have any more interaction with him for a few weeks. Some days I would have the spot, some days he would have the spot. It was not a big deal to me, I could always park on the main road if the spot was not available.

I mentioned that this started in the fall of 1977. Those of you familiar with Boston weather events will then realize that the following February brought the infamous blizzard of ’78 which virtually buried the city. My roommate had borrowed my rusty old Plymouth and it spent the blizzard in a parking lot in the next town over so the spot in front of the house would have been empty and available. Well, it would have been available if someone wanted to shovel out three feet of snow and it were legal to drive a car during the driving ban which followed the blizzard.

As it turned out, I was trapped at work for two days and finally got a ride home. My street had not been plowed but someone had made a wonderful snow staircase at the end of the street so I could walk up the stairs from the main road and then walk on the top of the unplowed road quite literally on the roofs of the cars parked on the street before the blizzard started. When I got to my house I saw that the two sisters, Cathy and Liz who lived on the second floor had made steps from the top of the road going down to our porch. It was truly a work of art, especially considering that Cathy was about seven months pregnant.

As I had not had much sleep so I decided to take a nap. A few hours later I was woken up by some loud voices. It seems that Cathy had been leaving for a doctor appointment and found that not only had the wonderful staircase from the porch to the street been obliterated, but the porch of the house was filled with snow. A neighbor across the street told her that third floor guy had done it while he was digging out the parking spot in front of our house. Well, digging out might be a stretch, he had dug a hole the size of his car. The road was still not plowed, how did he expect to get his car into the spot? Was a helicopter going to drop it in? When he dug out the hole he had to put the snow somewhere, so he buried our porch. Cathy was none too happy about this and proceeded to go to third floor guy’s house next door, went up the three flights of stairs to discuss the matter with third floor guy but found him not at home. But third floor guy’s wife was home, so Cathy dragged the guy’s wife down three flights of stairs by her hair, dragged her over to our porch, handed the wife a shovel and instructed her to dig. There were a few adjectives thrown in.

Our street remained unplowed for the next few days and people continued to walk over the tops of the cars to get to the main road.

One evening as my roommate and I got home in the early hours after driving a 12 hour shift there was a large front loader beginning the process of clearing our street. The driver would get a bucket full of snow, back out of the street, dump it into a truck, drive back down the street, and repeat. We asked the driver if he would like some coffee and he accepted. Since we were having coffee I made some breakfast for all of us. As we ate I suggested to the driver that instead of backing down the street he could pile snow in front of our house since my car was still in a parking lot. So the driver proceeded to not only fill in the hole that third floor guy had dug, but he piled snow to the height of a two story building in that spot.

The next day I saw third floor guy standing by the pile of snow with a shovel in his hand looking up at the top of the pile. He then just walked away.

https://preview.redd.it/q0vp3sqn9lfg1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8339b2d52bb5cf6b541509cd881c2dba4b9c262d

One of the most common challenges we hear from our clients isn’t about matting, sharp nails, or combing at home. It’s simply getting their cat into the carrier at home.

For many cats, the carrier has become a symbol of stress. After all, it usually only appears when it’s time for a vet visit, grooming appointment, or boarding stay. Cats often aren’t socialized the same way puppies are, trips outside the home can feel overwhelming. Unlike dogs, cats are frequently labeled as the “easy” pet: indoor only, independent, and low maintenance. As feline popularity continues to grow, especially with adventure cats and expanded feline services outside of veterinary care, we’re discovering that cats need thoughtful preparation too.

At [Don’t Stress Meowt — Groom and Board](https://dontstressmeowt-catcafe.com/groomandboardhome), we regularly meet loving owners who feel like villains simply for wanting to do something good for their cat, whether that’s a [professional groom](https://dontstressmeowt-catcafe.com/groomandboardhome) to improve their health, annual trips to their vet, or a stay at [our boarding facility](https://dontstressmeowt-catcafe.com/groomandboardhome) while they’re out of town.

Cats aren’t routinely exposed to car rides, new environments, or unfamiliar handling. Without early desensitization, the outside world becomes scary and the cat carrier becomes the trigger. The result? A stressed out cat and a frustrated owner who just wants to help.

While we aren’t behaviorists, we do see this issue often as professional cat groomers and we’re happy to share a few gentle, practical tips that may help reduce carrier anxiety.

**How to Help a Cat That’s Afraid of Their Carrier**

[](https://medium.com/plans?source=upgrade_membership---post_li_non_moc_upsell--45fb33aa600a---------------------------------------)

**1. Make the Carrier Part of Everyday Life**

Instead of storing the cat carrier in a closet, leave it out in the open in an area they frequent where it becomes just another object in your cat’s environment. At first, your cat may avoid the carrier itself — that’s okay. Over time, seeing the carrier regularly helps remove the association that it only appears before something stressful happens.

This is one of the simplest ways to reduce cat carrier anxiety before grooming, vet visits, or boarding.

**2. Reward Curiosity with High Value Treats**

When your cat approaches or enters the carrier, reward them with their favorite treats. Tossing crunchy treats inside the carrier while it sits in your living space encourages exploration. You can also feed them near or in the open carrier. If you catch them lounging inside on their own, reward them again. This positive reinforcement helps your cat learn that the carrier is a safe, comfortable place.

**3. Practice Short Closures and Calm Exits**

Once your cat is voluntarily spending time in the carrier, gently close the door for a short period then open it again. Gradually increase the time as your cat becomes more comfortable. Eventually, you can practice short car rides that don’t end at the groomer or vet, such as a quick drive around the block or take them on your morning coffee run, before returning home. This helps break the pattern that every trip leads to somewhere unpleasant.

These tips won’t work for every cat, especially those with extreme anxiety, but they’re a great starting point. Even small steps can make a big difference for cats who typically run, hide, or need to be cornered when the carrier appears.

At Don’t Stress Meowt, we believe that reducing stress for both cats and their humans is just as important as the services we provide. With patience, consistency, and compassion, the cat carrier can become less of a battle and more of a tool to provide outstanding care for your cat.

*“19th of October, 1885” The blank page was occupied solely by this singular piece of rather untidy handwriting placed at the top right corner. What would follow remained a mystery, even for the hands supposedly recounting events and noting emotions. Not from the lack of meaningful points to elaborate on, but rather the opposite.*

*Having sunk into the realm of her thoughts, Zofia would take her eyes off the notebook resting on her lap and gaze outside, at the rows upon rows of trees making up deep, uncharted forests she was passing by. Her head leaned against the window, feeling vibrations emanating from the train, getting lost in the clutter of its countless wheels. Ah, so many uncertainties, so many doubts. She felt the weight of her family’s issues on her shoulders, even if only partially.*

*“Maybe it’s not going to be that bad?” She thought to herself, glancing for a moment at an old suitcase she placed beside herself. “But when will I get to see them again? In months?” A sigh followed, a futile attempt at dispersing worries. Soon enough her new life would begin, yet what will it bring?*

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I’ll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

(I'd also be open to a similar roleplay inspired by ""Bride's story"" :3)

**About me:**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you’ll understand <3

**About you:**

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*
- *Be excited! Yeah, another cheesy one. Yet, I find it so fun to see an enthusiastic reply!*

1qn0gpl,https://i.redd.it/kklqghtl6lfg1.jpeg,"When the market is moving sideways, I'll go grab an iced coffee.","During a sideways market, what exhausts traders the most is not capital, but emotions. The price isn't moving, but the information density isn't zero; it's just that most fluctuations no longer have trading value.  
During this phase, I focus on three things: First, whether the structure has been broken. As long as the sequence of highs and lows remains intact, the consolidation itself is merely a time adjustment within the trend, not a change in direction. Second, whether trading activity is declining. If the fluctuations are accompanied by a decrease in volume, it's more likely due to decreased participation rather than selling pressure itself. Third, whether the price is still trading around key levels. Discussing price movements without considering the context of key levels is largely meaningless.  
Many people frequently trade in this kind of market, trying to ""turn the sideways movement into an opportunity,"" but the result is often exchanging transaction fees and emotional stress for a bit of randomness. I prefer to do nothing and wait for the price to provide its own answer.  
If a trade requires you to constantly monitor the market to be successful, then it probably shouldn't be made.  
So when the market is moving sideways, I'll step away from the screen and grab an iced coffee.Not because there's nothing to do, but because the truly important decisions have already been made.",2,1769386831.0,stocktraders,0,1.0,False

I say excuse me, the dog begins pissing. Ok? I’m at a cafe… the dog jumps and tries to lick my cup so I yell get away from me. Standing at a crosswalk… the owner keeps the dog close to me on the street. I step away, they move close. So I ask them to move their dog or pull it closer. Usually I get dirty stares but sometimes they yell back or protest. I’m sick of going to cafes and seeing dogs either break into fights, dogs licking at the floor or pawing the table where coffee is served… etc.

I also don’t get why would you have a dog as a pet just to leave it at home for hours to be bored and sad. I just do not understand it.

A lady walks into a store in my area that’s high traffic and leaves her baby in the stroller while she walks around the store with her huge off leash dog. You can’t make this stuff up. I thought it was only my city but apparently every where is getting hit by this. 

There’s a dentist on TikTok that has a dog for emotional support. Someone commented there’s no way they can keep everything sterile. To which they replied saying it’s not Oral surgery… that’s such a strange mentality because  do I even have to explain? I found a new dentist and someone brought their dog who jumped all over. I don’t get this. Someone else in TikTok got bit in the face by a dog and the comments said don’t report it if it’s up to date on the shots. She said she didn’t but the dog bit others!! wtf! 

Dogs in busy bars, sitting on stools and the owners giving them water out of the cups for humans. I saw a guy let his dog piss over cans in the store. I said so you’re just gonna leave that… he then laughed and called me a bitch. So yea it’s an interesting um landscape now.

I work in an office. I have this work mate who's been hanging out with me for quite some time now. Our relationship was fine, we laugh a lot, we talk about life, and basically anything that comes to mind. The problem started when I noticed that they're basically copying everything I have and everything I do. 

Scenario 1: I bought a different lippie shade just to switch things up because I was getting bored of the current one I have. A day after, they bought the same thing. 

Scenario 2 : I switched coffee shops. There's another local coffee shop that's closer to the office; they had the honey oat kemberlu that I liked so I switched from SB to that. A day after, they're now going to the same shop with the same order 🤨

Scenario 3 : I had this plan to get my sister enrolled to kumon as soon as she turns 4 so I can help my mom with the kid's early education. A week later, they're telling everyone in the office that they'd enroll their kid there too and that it was a lifelong dream since they didn't experience it as a kid. Mind you, they did not know that you can enroll toddlers in Kumon until after I mentioned it. 



Those are the top 3 that made me realize they were copying me. The others are too specific to mention here 😭 So... OA lang ba ako or ginagaya nya talaga ako? It's not just these eh marami pa. Mostly sa fashion choices, pananalita, and ginogoal ko sa buhay. Gets ko naman na friends usually sync with interests as time goes by pero bakit parang iba 'to? I like hanging out with them but seriously, this makes me feel like it's not just copying, it's like they're tryna compete in a passive aggressive way. 😑

1qn08ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qn08ul/should_i_talk_to_hr_about_my_coworker/,Should I talk to HR about my coworker?,"I (23F, 5'4"") have been working at my new job for a little less than a month. My job is a combination of sales and desk work. we have our own office space specifically for our department, and thankfully, this post is not about anyone in my department. 

there's this guy (24M, 6'2"") from the attendant/janitorial staff that I was introduced to in a group of people. we chatted and joked around a little bit. he pretty quickly asked me for my socials, which isn't unusual because the more I started following my co-workers the more I realized that everyone follows everyone else. 

he started messaging me frequently, asking to get coffee sometime after work. I know I probably should have said no, because I'm not interested in him in that way but I said yes because based on his demeanor when we talk, I wasn't getting an ulterior motive. he genuinely seemed like he was just wanting to hang out. (also I was getting kind of gay vibes)

we went to get coffee and it was fine, we just talked about art and movies. he was telling me all these TV shows that we ""have to watch together"", how when I go over to his place, he will cook for me and we will watch TV. despite how this seems very forward to me now, at the time I really thought his demeanor was very friendly. 

after this, he started messaging me more and at this point, I feel the need to clear the air. I message him saying ""you know we're just friends right?"" and he responded ""Well I guess you want me to say yes.""

I apologize to him, saying that I like to do the things that we were talking about but I just didn't realize I was insinuating a different vibe. he said that we should talk about it the next day. which to me kind of felt weird because, what is there even to talk about? I've only really known this guy for a few weeks if that. 

The next day was pretty awkward but we don't work together really so we didn't need to interact. 

at some point when I was alone in my department office space, he came in and closed the door behind him. he just chatted with me and was just talking about movies and art again, but it was a bit annoying this time because I'm trying to do my work and also we have this new context from last night that he's just ignoring. 

and he does this frequently. he will insist on us hanging out, joke about his feelings getting hurt if I say no, if we're joking around and I make fun of him a little bit, he will ""fake punch me"" (throwing his fist in my direction but stopping it right in front of my face).

The thing is, I have a really hard time understanding if I'm allowing behaviors that I don't personally like to become acceptable. like we joke and have fun, but I just don't know if that's my responsibility to be blunt with him or if I should seek some external help. Because he's actually a pretty big dude and his behavior feels hard to predict.

The weirdest incident was today, and this is going to be really hard to describe without specifics. we were in a room, doing a task in which he had a sharp object. It was his job, but he asked for help because he wanted to hang out and I said sure why not. we were in the space, and you know that moment that's really hard to describe when, for example, someone's holding a hose and you know they're about to spray you? it's an indescribable moment but they just start approaching you and you start backing away and you both nonverbally understand what's about to happen? that happened with him, while he was holding the sharp object and I felt genuinely helpless. I think he thought it was funny, so I quickly said ""what are you doing, what are you doing"" and he told me he wanted to (struggling to hide details) do something that involved playful touching but coming from a guy like him would probably actually cause me pain. I said no, and just went back to doing our tasks.

additionally, he keeps doing this cryptic thing where he'll say ""I want to talk to you about something"" and I say ""yeah?"" and he just doesn't say it. he's done it like 3 times and it gives me bad goosebumps.

But everyone else in the office just talks about how great of a guy he is. anytime I've tried to Open up too a coworker about him, before I can talk about it they literally always say ""he's such a nice guy"". and then, like, I don't feel comfortable mentioning it to them.

I feel a level of responsibility to address this guy personally and express what makes me feel uncomfortable, but that's just such a painfully difficult conversation to have and I'm not sure if I should be the one handling it or if I should call in some reinforcements? I've heard that HR is more of a company protector than an employee protector, but what do you guys think?

TLDR; my coworker who's like 2x my size kind of confessed to being interested me after knowing him for 2 weeks and after turning him down, has been goofing around with me business as usual, but crossing lines id prefer he didn't cross (nonsexual touching, teasing, spending time in my office without asking, and one semi-scary incident that seemed well intentioned on his end).

1qn08cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vietnam_Tourism/comments/1qn08cs/my_viewsopinion_on_phu_quoc/,My views/opinion on Phu Quoc,"I'm writing this after spending one week on Phu Quoc as I want to share my honest opinion on this place and help others understand where they're planning to travel (at least my POV of this place). Feel free to comment on your thoughts and tips, as these are of course just my personal observations.

I visited Phu Quoc in mid-January, which, to my understanding, is considered peak season. The weather was great throughout, with almost exclusively sunshine and great colors in the sky during sunrise and sunset. The temperature was perfect, being very warm and humid but never unbearable, normally around 30°C (although I am acclimated to SEA temperatures by now).

Ok, so all in all, I have to admit, leaving the island my predominant feeling was disappointment, followed by sadness for what this place has become/is obviously moving towards being. The huge resorts have taken over large parts of the coastline from the northwest all the way down to the south. Beaches like Vung Bau, which were hailed as calm and rugged even a few years ago online, are now predominantly closed off and entrances guarded by security. Resorts like the Mövenpick apparently charge up to 500k for non-guest access, though I cannot personally confirm this. The city center of Duong Dong reminds me more of Magaluf, with large restaurants, often offering cuisine geared towards Western and Russian visitors, lining the main streets and a night market which can only be described as a show for tourists (if you have never been to SEA, many of the stalls might be appealing to you, but I do think the quality of the products offered is lacking throughout). There are definitely still authentic, family-run restaurants and businesses to be found, though I feel like they are not (or no longer) the majority.
The parts of Phu Quoc I was hoping to enjoy before coming were the north and the east coast. Online, I had found reports of people mentioning true island life, old fishing villages, and an overall more ""traditional"" experience. On arrival, I sadly came to find that, like everywhere else on the island, ""major"" development has also reached these parts of the island. Riding down the east coast, you can see many projects in their early stages, with large parts of the jungle being flattened to make way for what I can only presume to be more accommodation for tourists. There are definitely still fishing villages and resorts that have obviously existed for a while, though they are seemingly not benefiting from the influx of tourists Phu Quoc has seen over the last couple of years. Many of the family-run resorts I tried to visit for a coffee or a coconut were either shut completely or in a state that makes it obvious there haven't been many guests there for a long time. The stretches of beach were almost always covered in trash (a major issue on the island as a whole), and only some places on the east coast managed to keep their part clean. It seems like there was a demand for more laid-back ""eco-style resorts"" some time ago, but now a lot of these places seem like they’re falling apart, with the owners maybe not getting the business they need to keep the place fully operational.
As I have mentioned so much negativity up to this point, I want to mention that I did find places I feel have ""good energy"" and the right spirit. Ham Ninh fishing village has a plethora of seafood restaurants, and it seems you can't really go wrong. I like the idea of eating here if you're looking for fresh seafood, as opposed to going to one of the many overpriced ones in town which almost certainly get their fish from places like this. Bún Kèn Út Lượm is a restaurant in Duong Dong serving Bún Kèn, a local specialty which is incredible! The Bee Farm is a good day out with some interesting things to be learned. I liked the walk up the Tiên Sơn Đỉnh viewpoint, although I feel like the view at the top is tainted by the major development happening, especially the new part of the airport (I think that's what it is), which takes up about half of your field of view. There are supposedly more viewpoints on the island, though information is scarce, and Đỉnh núi Đá Bạc is apparently no longer accessible as the family who owns the entrance doesn't want people going up there. Some well-run resorts on the east coast I came past are: Gialy Home & Cafe, Bai Thom Retreat, Canopy Villa Cay Sao, and Chez Vu Pottery and Homestay, although there are definitely way more (!!!!), and I encourage everyone to list more in the comments if they want to.
Like I said, this is only based on personal views and experiences, and I have definitely missed out on many hidden gems on the island. Still, I think it's undeniable that rushed development has hit Phu Quoc hard; the environment, but also the charm of the place, have suffered under it. I really hope that the people of Phu Quoc are feeling some kind of benefit from this, even if it's only monetary or through more job opportunities. It'll be interesting to see what this place will look like in five years.

-edit: I just wanted to mention that I do not expect places like Phu Quoc to be ""stuck in time"" just so travelers can have an ""authentic"" experience and then return home to Western countries. I understand development in some form is important and Vietnam, as a growing economic power, is going to see a lot more of it. Nevertheless, I think that this development can come in a thought-out, sustainable fashion with the culturally interested and respectful return-tourist in mind. Also, I think the environmental impact, especially in this day and age, needs to be considered to a certain extent. I think these problems extend past Phu Quoc to many other nature tourist hotspots.",5,1769386237.0,Vietnam_Tourism,0,1.0,False

When the server asked if the bill was together or split, everyone said to.

1qn04n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1qn04n9/the_offlinefirst_smartphone_a_compromisebased/,"The offline-first smartphone, a compromise-based approach","**TL;DR: Making it harder/expensive to access the Internet, can be a very effective strategy to reduce mindless smartphone scrolling.**

I'm a millennial who's been a bit of a screen addict for 25 years, but it's never been as bad as with the modern, always-connected smartphone.  For me, the smartphone is the worst of the worst, and essentially the primary channel of brainrot and doomscrolling.

Both in this and related subreddits there's a healthy push to abandon the smartphone completely. There are many things to be said about that, for example I believe there are unique advantages to exploring a new place with an old-school paper map, rather than a mobile app. That said, ditching the smartphone is not an option I'm personally considering right now.  However, I've recently found one mitigation strategy that has been very helpful for me. 

Most of the addictive stuff on a smartphone requires a constant high-bandwidth Internet connection. Without connectivity, you can not refresh news sites, scroll through endless short video content, and the like. 

I have a fixed-data mobile subscription that includes x GB of cellular-network data traffic each month. If I reach that threshold, I can explicitly purchase more data, but the cost is non-trivial.

So, what I'm doing now is:

- At the start of the month, I quickly use about x-2 GB of the allowance.  That leaves enough data from Internet-dependent essentials (Signal, WhatsApp, email, banking, transport apps, maps). It's also more than enough to actually do some light browsing now and then, if I really need to, ...or really want to.

- Most importantly, I do not have my home WiFi registered on the phone. I have WiFi at home, but my access point has a complex, random password, that I don't remember -- that's the whole point. Finding it would require some effort on one of the WiFi-connected computers.

- Still, I want to regularly connect to the Internet on a non-metered connection, so I can download podcasts, music, and software updates, so I've added a few WiFi networks in other locations (guest network at one workplace, and so on).

Effectively, this gives me an ""offline-first"" smartphone, that works well for the things *I* do find rewarding and/or useful: 

- Listening to music on the go
- Listening to podcasts 
- Reading ebooks [1]
- Keeping in contact with family and close friends, using Internet-backed apps
- Maps and route planning
- Banking
- Post and packages
- Managing tickets, etc
- Looking up the odd thing, once in a while (restaurant menu, concerts this weekend, ...)

Obviously, this is not a die-hard, scorched-earth approach. But, I've found it's very helpful for me, and that I may be a good stepping-stone to something akin to a 2005-style rig, down the road. 

Some observations and comments:

- I suspect a crucial part of this working is that I have this type of metered connection with a fixed allotment, and relatively high cost after the threshold.  I'm very skeptical whether it would work with a pay-as-go subscription, say.

- I'm not on Facebook, Instagram, etc. I suspect if I were active on such social (""social"") networks, it could prove difficult to keep the strategy going.

- An important element of this strategy is that it's pretty easy to bounce back after a ""relapse"": I can just delete my WiFi network password from the smartphone again, and change it if I start remembering. Odd relapses should be expected.

- I don't play games on my phone. That said, I generally view some gaming as way less harmful that mindless online scrolling.

- I personally don't like using public WiFi networks on coffee shops, etc, and they're becoming increasingly rare here in the Nordics anyway, so that's not a big worry.

- With this offline-first strategy, I find I care much more about the media I actually have downloaded on the phone, even if I technically still rely on streaming services.  Especially with albums of music; I've found myself reading about an album, making a note to download it, downloading when possible, and then listening more attentively.

- [1] I do have an e-ink reader, but when laying down I actually prefer reading on the OLED smartphone screen. 

- Again, for me the smartphone is the main problem. I have more control at/over my other devices. (Maybe a post for later. Key idea: Use Linux and learn to lock down the system in multiple ways.)

- I do not consider writing way too long Reddit posts any waste of time. If anything, expressing thoughts in writing with paragraphs is nearly a radical act at this time of constant Wall-E-style consumption.

1qn0159,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1qn0159/aita_for_pressing_charges_after_my_brother_threw/,"AITA for pressing charges after my brother threw parties in my house while I was abroad, caused $8K damage, claimed he OWNS it, and my family says I'm choosing 'money over family'?","My brother just called me a vindictive bitch because I'm pressing charges after he threw a rager in my house and told everyone it was his.

I was in Japan for two weeks, first real vacation I'd taken in like four years. Three days in, my neighbor texted me a video from her ring camera. My brother's car was in my driveway at 11pm on a Tuesday, which was weird because I never gave him a key. Then she sent another clip from Friday night. Twenty-something cars lining my street, people stumbling across my lawn, someone puking in my flower bed.

I called him immediately. He answered drunk, music blasting in the background.

""Hey sis, what's up?""

""Why the fuck are there people at my house?""

He laughed. ""Oh shit, yeah, I'm crashing here for a bit. My lease ended and I needed somewhere to go before my new place opens up. Didn't think you'd mind.""

""You're having a party in my house right now.""

""It's just a few friends. Relax.""

I hung up and called the police. They went over for a noise complaint but couldn't do much since he claimed he had permission to be there. I spent the rest of my vacation checking my neighbor's footage, watching stranger after stranger walk through my front door.

When I got home, my 65-inch TV was shattered. Like completely destroyed, glass everywhere. My coffee table had a huge burn mark from someone putting out cigarettes directly on the wood. There were stains on my couch I don't even want to identify. My bedroom door was broken off the hinges. Someone had gone through my closet and my jewelry box was empty, about $3,000 worth of stuff just gone.

My brother wasn't there but he'd left a note on the kitchen counter: ""Thanks for letting me crash, you're the best. I'll replace the TV eventually lol.""

I called him. He answered like nothing was wrong.

""Yo, you're back! How was Japan?""

""What the fuck did you do to my house?""

""What do you mean? I cleaned up before I left.""

""My TV is destroyed. My jewelry is gone. There's cigarette burns on my furniture.""

He sighed, like I was being dramatic. ""Okay yeah, the TV was an accident. Some guy got too drunk and knocked it over. And I don't know anything about your jewelry, maybe you misplaced it before you left. The cigarette thing, I mean, people were smoking. What do you want me to do about it?""

""You told me you needed a place to crash. You didn't say you were throwing parties.""

""I had a couple people over. Sue me.""

""I might actually do that.""

He laughed. ""Come on, don't be like that. Family helps family. Besides, technically you never said I couldn't have anyone over.""

I asked him about the key. He said he found my spare under the doormat, which I keep there for emergencies. Then he said something that made my blood boil.

""Plus everyone thinks it's my house now anyway, so like, you're kind of embarrassing me by making a big deal out of this.""

""What?""

""Yeah, I've been telling people I bought a house. Showed them pictures and everything. It's a good look for me, you know? I need people to take me seriously.""

I couldn't even speak. He kept going.

""So maybe just let me keep saying it's mine for a few more months. I'll pay you back for the TV when I can.""

I hung up. I was shaking. I went through my neighbor's footage more carefully. There were at least three different parties. I counted over fifty people total throughout the week. My brother was in every video, arms spread wide on my porch, welcoming people in like he owned the place.

I filed a police report for the stolen jewelry and property damage. I also sent my brother an itemized bill: TV replacement, furniture repair, deep cleaning, locksmith to change all my locks, and the missing jewelry. Total came to about $8,400.

He called me screaming. ""You're really going to charge your own brother? After everything I've done for you?""

""What have you done for me?""

""I fucking existed. I've been there your whole life. That's what family means.""

""You destroyed my house and stole from me.""

""I didn't steal shit. And it was just a little damage. You're being dramatic.""

My mom called next. She'd heard about it from my brother. She said I was being cruel, that he's going through a hard time with his lease situation, that family forgives family.

""He threw three parties and told everyone the house was his, Mom.""

""He was probably just trying to impress people. You know how he is. He didn't mean any harm.""

""There's $8,400 in damage.""

""Well you make good money, you can afford it. He's barely getting by.""

I told her he makes more than me, he's just bad with money. She said that wasn't the point and I should be grateful I could help him.

My brother started posting on Facebook about how his ""toxic sister"" was trying to ""extort"" him over an honest mistake. His friends started commenting on my posts, calling me greedy and stuck-up. One of them sent me a message saying I should be ashamed for treating family like this.

I got a lawyer. Sent my brother a formal demand letter. He responded by blocking me on everything and telling our entire family I was dead to him.

Here's where it gets worse. I found out through a mutual friend that my brother had been planning to use my house as his ""permanent address"" for background checks on job applications. He was telling potential employers he was a homeowner to seem more stable. He'd already used my address on three applications.

I reported him for fraud. The police took it seriously because of the false address situation combined with the theft. They're pursuing charges.

My whole family has turned on me now. My aunt called me a monster. My dad said I'm destroying the family over material possessions. My mom cried on the phone and said she didn't raise me to be this heartless.

But my brother still hasn't apologized. He's still telling people the house is his. He posted a photo yesterday from my front porch with the caption ""home sweet home"" like he still lives there.

Everyone keeps saying I'm being vindictive and that he made a mistake. That I'm choosing money and pride over family. My mom said if I don't drop the charges and forgive him, she'll never speak to me again.

Am I the asshole for pressing charges against my own brother?

1qmzy7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qmzy7h/mf_the_lighthouse_of_purport/,[MF] The Lighthouse of Purport,"I stand on the edge of oblivion, the waves crashing against the rocky shore below. The tips of my toes cresting the lip of the tower. I feel its warm light behind me run rhythmically across my back. I do not know how I got here. A choice lies before me but indecision has made anchors of my feet. I look out toward the horizon and see the first rays of dawn spilling over the waves. Its creeping light climbs the white walls below me slowly bathing them in a golden hue. When it reaches my feet a new fear surges in my chest. My legs are crystalizing, hardening into columns of salt. As the light climbs my body more and more of me turns to the point where even if I wanted to, I can no longer move. Just as it reaches my neck, I am jolted awake. 

My heart pounds as if it wishes to break free from me. A bead of sweat runs from my forehead down the side of my brow as I sit up. Breeze blows in through the window and suddenly I am aware of the dampness of my whole body. The grey curtains swaying softly as I sit for a moment and catch my breath. The cool morning air calms my lungs and a wave of relief washes through me. It was only a dream. A light flashes in the corner of the room and I turn to look. The sky outside is still a dark shade of purple. I quickly find the origin of the light on a peninsula sheltering the bay. The lighthouse of Purport. The white tower from my dream. Sitting there for a moment I look out over the bay, scanning for some point over the black horizon. Shivering as a chill grow up my spine. I suppose it is time I woke up anyway, it's best to get an early start. Brushing off the covers I stand and walk to the closet. Some boots, canvas pants, white shirt, an old brown jacket and a grey cap, my usual attire. There is something comforting in never questioning what to wear. 

As I make my way into the hall I can hear some of my neighbors stirring to life. I live in the second story of a local restaurant in Purport where they offer some cheap accommodations. It's not much, just a single room with a place to hang your clothes, but it's home. My landlord Owen also doubles as the cook downstairs and I often stop in to grab a bite to eat on my way out. Making my way down the steps I can hear the rattling of dishes and the quiet murmurings of early morning guests still waking up. Pulling up a stool I sit down at the counter overlooking the griddle that is currently frying up pancakes, eggs and sausage. My landlord Owen flips up a pancake and we lock eyes. “Good morning Fred!” he says in his usual cheerful way. “Morning” I reply. There must have been something in the way I said it because immediately he asks, “Rough night?” I give him a half hearted smile, “Something like that.” He lifts a pot of coffee and pours some into an old mug. “Here.” He says sliding it over to me. “On the house.” Steam rises and the scent fills me with warmth. “Thank you.” “Don’t mention it. Wouldn't want people thinking there's something wrong with my beds!” He gives me a grin and throws two pancakes onto a plate with the eggs and sausage and places it in front of me. “I haven't ordered yet.” “No need.” He says, “Or would you have rather told me all the things you weren't going to order?” I smile, he's right, no point in ordering something new when you already know what you like. Digging in, I am only halfway through my meal when the thought hits me. I've done this before. But of course I have, it's my routine. This moment could be interchanged with a thousand. But at the thought the food in my mouth turns to ash and swallowing takes more effort than it ever has before. I throw some money up on the counter and thank him again, leaving my meal half finished.

Stepping out into the street I take a long deep breath of the morning air. There is dew still glistening on the street lamps and a light fog that clings like a cool blanket. I am greeted with the usual bustle of people preparing their shops for the day and the sound of hooves trotting down the cobblestone streets. The part of Purport in which I live rests on a hill overlooking the bay. As I take in the view, one carriage in particular catches my eye. A young married couple are riding by with their three children, all dressed in beautiful vibrant colors. The father says something to the kids and they laugh. I find a smile growing across my face at the joy from the family, yet a pit grows in my stomach. It feels as if something has been quietly carved out of me. They continue on their way and my smile seems to vanish as quickly as it appeared. Shaking it off I turn to take my usual route down to the market.

As I walk my eyes hover over the cobblestone a few paces ahead and my mind drifts to the dream. A glint of light shines briefly in a shop window to my right. Turning I see the reflection of that distant white tower, its light creeping through an alley on the other side of the street. Losing track of what is in front of me, I crash into a woman unpacking her things from a carriage on the corner. Suitcases fall, spilling their contents into the street. “So sorry!” I say bending over to collect her things. Clothes and other personal items litter the ground around us. “It's ok, these things happen.” A familiar voice says with slight exasperation. I lift my eyes to see her face. She is a young woman with curly red hair spilling out from a black hat with two green feathers that almost perfectly match her eyes. “Victoria?” I ask. She seems puzzled to be recognized and meets my gaze. “Fredrick!” she exclaims. She and I went to school together as kids. Those memories feel like they belong to a different life. We both stand and she pulls me in for a lingering hug. “I thought you'd have left by now.” She says a little perplexed. “I thought so too.” I know she meant no harm by the comment, but it is as if something in me has been crushed. “My, you haven't changed a day.” She says while stepping back to take a look at me. I suppose in my usual getup I look the same as I ever have. “It certainly feels like it.” I say lightheartily. “What about you?” I thought you left to see the world or something?” “Oh, I did.” Her eyes fall to her shoes. Something seems to weigh heavy on her mind. “And now you’re back?” I ask. “I guess so.” She says with little certainty. I feel a bit taken aback by this, I always felt she was destined for better things than Purport. Like she could make it out there. “Why, if you don't mind my asking?” “I don’t know, I suppose I had nowhere else to go.” My line of questioning seems to be making her a little uneasy as she begins to fidget nervously with her purse. I help her finish putting her things away and apologize once more. “Will I see you around?” She asks. “Most likely.” I reply as we say our goodbyes and part ways. ‘*I always am.’* I think to myself.

The market feels unusually quiet as I wander in. A few stalls are still waiting for their tenders to arrive but the one I am looking for is open. Walking up to the counter I see an old grey fisherman mending a net. “Mornin Fred” he says, never taking his eyes off his work. “Mornin Finn.” I say in reply. I remember as a kid running through the market and stopping to hear Finn’s grand fishing stories. Always about some great sea beast or about 'the one that got away.' He has always been here. “Going out in the boat today?” he asks, finally looking up to meet me. “I think so, was going to grab some provisions for the trip. Might make a day or two of it.” “Not a bad idea, I always felt the sea was a good place to clear your mind. Get away from it all for a while.” His eyes move from mine to some distant point over the bay. For a moment he holds his gaze there, as if caught in some distant memory. “You know I almost left once.” A light seems to glimmer in his eyes, shining as if for a moment he was a young man again. Finn has always lived in Purport, and as far as I knew it's where he wanted to be. A tension like a vise grows around my chest. *Has Finn ever had that dream?* “What stopped you?” I ask. “I don’t know…” he answers after a pause, his eyes never moving from the horizon. “I guess I didn’t know where I would go.” At this last comment his eyes break away and he returns to his work as if a man stumbling out of a dream. Silence sits between us as I ponder his words. “If you did, do you think you would have?” His eyes raise to meet my gaze and wrinkles form from a smile on his face. He bends down picking up a couple small boxes and sets them down on the counter. “Here, for your trip.” I begin to dig into my pockets for money when he stops me. “Don’t worry about it Fredrick.” Looking into his eyes I see that same glimmer again, “Just catch something out there for me wouldya.”

The sun has risen high in the sky when I finally make it down to the docks. It is nearly mid-day. The water gently slaps against the shore as I prepare for my journey. The day is calm and quiet. A better day could not be asked for. I set sail out of the harbor passing the Lighthouse as I cross off the point of the peninsula. Time has beaten its youth away but its light is still as reliable as the day it was built. Cracks line its white walls like wrinkles on a well worn smile. I know the rhythm of the light by heart. Always guiding me away from the dangers of the rocks and into the safety of Purports harbor. Something in me has always felt that no matter how far from shore I wandered it would always be there to call me home. I am sailing for no real point in particular, just somewhere on the edge of the horizon. A quiet escape into a dream.

By the time that I feel I am reasonably far enough away the day has grown old and the sun has started its descent over the deep blue waters. I start my routine, jigging some lines and setting them in their places. I drift aimlessly for a while, getting a few bites here but nothing in the boat. That dream slowly floods back into my mind. Why did I feel so helpless? What was it that I wanted? Why did I feel so hollow from that family's happiness? Thoughts of Victoria enter my mind. She was smart and ambitious, always dreaming of having a life somewhere else. Of being something more than some small town girl. If anyone could do it, it was her. Why did she come back? And what about Finn? He could have left, but instead he stayed. Why? Just because he never had somewhere to go? Time has slipped away from me and night has fallen bringing with it a world of lights. The black water still like glass reflects the stars as if it were a mirror for the heavens. Sitting in my boat feels as if I am adrift in a world of endless possibilities. As if a million paths lie before me. 

A faint light flickers on some distant point across the water. I know that one well. The lighthouse of Purport. Instinctively I find myself turning towards the light. Towards its safety and comfort. Toward home. A chill grows up my spine. “I guess I had nowhere else to go.” Victoria’s words echo in my mind. My grip tightens over the helm, knuckles whitening as I contemplate those words. *‘Nowhere else to go.’* My arms feel as if suddenly they are made of lead. That distant glow glides slowly along the horizon as I turn away from its guiding light. The wheel fights me as if it is resisting my new direction. I choose instead to turn my ship to the guidance of some bright distant star. One of the thousand before me. Purport’s light fades slowly over the horizon before disappearing completely. Finn’s words float into my mind. “I didn’t know where I would go.” Neither do I.",2,1769385545.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

I decided to immerse myself in the world of Belgian beers, a journey that led me to try many different styles. I started my search with recommendations I found here and elsewhere. I tried to be smart about it by tracking the most frequently mentioned beers in forums alongside personal suggestions.

So far, I’ve found **Chimay Blue** to be the best. You might say, ""Well, just wait until you try \[X\] beer."" But I arrived at this conclusion even after trying heavy hitters like **Westmalle Tripel** (which I'm actually drinking right now). I find the Westmalle bitter with a lovely fruity aroma. I definitely ""get"" the hype, but it’s nothing compared to the beers that truly align with my palate.

Personally, I love the taste of sweet beer foam accompanied by a touch of chocolate and coffee. That's why Chimay Blue won my heart. It delivers the exact taste and experience I enjoy.

And that’s the magic of beer: you can find a style that fits *you*. I don't judge people who like cherry beers (even though I personally don't like them). The fact that beer has so many styles makes it impossible to find an objective ""best."" Even a house beer in a pub can be far better than any bottled beer (huge shoutout to **De Garre** in Bruges).

So, how should you guide your search? First, look at what you already like. Do you enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning? Try a dark beer with those qualities. do you like beverages that feel refreshing? Try a lager. I guarantee there is a beer that fits your style.

I hope my experience helps others find their perfect pint. I will still search for mine, but until that time comes, I’ll keep enjoying this magnificent world. Cheers!",5,1769385439.0,beer,3,0.67,False

Fala, pessoal! Como vocês estão?

Eu viajei no final do ano e, longe de casa, encomendei o kit degustação da Dora, com frete grátis e por um valor extremamente amigável (não consigo recordar o valor exato, mas, com cupom, saiu menos de 70 reais, já com frete incluso). Envio relativamente rápido (cinco dias), caixa de envio firme, potinhos em ordem. Eu já provei alguns cafés da torrefação antes, mas o valor estava tão legal que decidi pedir, já que eu não tinha provado o Açaí e Baunilha (além dele, o kit é composto pelo Brigadeirão e Caramelo Salgado. 3 potinhos com 80 gramas cada).

Produtores: Marco Franco e Rodrigo Bulisani

Variedade: Catuaí 144

Pontuação: 92 pts

Altitude: 1450 metros

Processo: TROA (processo exclusivo da Dora. Fui atrás da explicação, mas achei um tanto confusa e deixei de querer entender. Tive a impressão de ser algo novo e importante para a torrefação. Por conta disto, estão tentando esconder o processo até ficar consistente; mas é só a minha impressão pessoal)

Notas sensoriais (segundo a torrefação): Baunilha, flor de laranjeira, mel e açaí

Fiquei super curioso com estas notas sensoriais e... Bem, tentei de tudo, mas não consegui nenhuma xícara espetacular. Nota sensorial costuma ser subjetiva, mas acabo encontrando algo na xícara que bata com a descrição. Aqui, encontrei um café de perfil tradicional, com uma leve lembrança floral e um aftertaste ligeiramente ""terroso"". Os grãos são ótimos, a torra recente, mas é um café que esquecerei rapidamente. Fiz todas as receitas no V60 tradicional, testando variações de moagem, temperatura e nada. Um bom café para o dia a dia, que eu encontraria em outras torrefações por 120 reais o quilo (na promoção).

Alguém mais pegou este café? Gostaria de ler outras opiniões.

PS: Mesmo não sendo memorável, achei o café gostosinho e com um valor justo. Pensei em refazer a avaliação, pois parece que estou detonando o café e não é o caso. Inclusive, acho a compra super válida. ",8,1769385230.0,CafeEspecialBR,1,0.9,False

1qmzrtu,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qmzrtu/sour_shots_breville_barista_touch/,Sour shots [Breville Barista Touch],"Dial In Help - Barista Touch

Hi all,

I had a Breville barista touch. Use the built in grinder and having trouble with my shots.

I’ve got the grinder setup to grind size 04, 17s, which yields me approx 16g of coffee each dose - I find 18g tends to overflow the basket with the coffee I’m using which ends up in a mess when distributing and tamping.

Puck prep involves WDT, distributor, & self levelling tamp.

Takes approx 43-45 seconds to pull 35g of coffee, which is still just slightly bitter. Occasionally the coffee will have a hard time pulling and I’ll end up around the same time with only 10-11g.

When it pulls out 35g it is just ever so slightly sour - the magnitude of difference feels like the same dosed shot with a 04 grind and 05 grind - if that makes sense. 

If I reduce the grind size to 03, shots don’t pull - very little liquid comes out over a minute time. Less than 15g worth.

What should my next play be in dialing this in? Increasing yield? Or something else?

Thanks. ",1,1769385102.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

We talked a bit a week ago and decided to meet up - he expressed feeling ambivalent about it, he misses me and loves me but fears to get hurt again. I wonder how I hurt him, since there were no fights, no betrayals or anything of the sort.

Today I went over to his place for coffee. We didn't want to discuss the relationship, but to go slowly and just have a nice evening. We we're there two hours.  
Maybe its important for you to know that we are both men and in our mid-to-late 20ies.  


When I got there, he opened the door in a very revealing tank top. Something he usually did not wear so often, but maybe I am misreading it.  
He showed me his new flat and we talked about it a bit. It was fun then. I even gave him a warm smile, which he responded to.  
Then we sat down for coffee and started talking about what we did in life after the break up - only light talk. While I was there to test the waters, make a first slow approach, I felt as if he wanted to show me how good he is without me. He started talking about his own maturity, made a joke that he is a ""size queen"" (gay slang for someone who enjoys large d. which I found very inappropriate after a break up) - to which I responded by looking him straight into the eyes and then going to be bathroom.  
The atmosphere was very tense, its as if I was talking to a different person, full defense.   
Then we started talking about the tense atmosphere, he said that there are still a lot of barriers between us, I replied that we need to be able to ""tolerate that for the start"". It got lighter afterwards.

After two hours I left. Honestly? I feel deeply hurt and I am not entirely sure why. I can only assume a little bit, I mean I knew about his defense. 

Could someone give me some advice? How should I proceed? Should I even proceed? How to approach him so we can lower our guards again? Why do I feel so immensely hurt?

I am not anxiously attached. I usually feel very secure in relationships, but it was incredibly hard for me to hold my secure base during our conversation. I felt very vulnerable and anxious, although I had prepared myself before going there.",6,1769385098.0,AvoidantBreakUps,15,1.0,False

That’s okay. I’m genuinely curious to hear from people who might recognize themselves in this.

I live abroad, and every time I come back to Sfax, it’s usually for a short stay—one or two weeks. What always surprises me is how quickly I feel a kind of disconnect and alone. Not with the city itself, but with the conversations, the topics, and sometimes the way people think. It often feels exactly the same as it was years ago.

To be clear, this isn’t about “looking down” on anyone. Sfax gave me a lot. But living abroad changed my references, my interests, and the things I enjoy talking about. During short visits, I find myself struggling to connect the way I used to. Topics that once excited me don’t anymore, and the things I care about now often feel out of place or awkward to bring up.

That’s what led me to an idea I keep coming back to. What if there was a private coffee shop or social space in Sfax—not exclusive in a snobbish way, but selective by *experience*? A place where people who live abroad (or have lived abroad), researchers, entrepreneurs, engineers, investors, or simply very curious people could meet naturally.

The point wouldn’t be status. It would be ease. A place where you don’t need to justify your life choices, explain how things work abroad, or filter what you say. You could talk openly about careers, investments, failures, buying property, starting projects, or just how your worldview changed. And every time you’re back in Sfax for a week, you already know there’s a place where you’ll meet people who “get it.”

I know some will read this and immediately think it’s elitist or disconnected from reality. I understand that reaction. But I’m honestly asking: for people who live abroad—or who feel caught between two worlds—does this resonate at all? Or is this just a personal mismatch that others don’t experience?

I’d really like to hear from Sfaxien who come back to Sfax for short visits and feel this strange gap too. Even if you disagree, I’m interested in thoughtful perspectives!",2,1769384841.0,Sfax,2,1.0,False

I (19F), a first year at university, think I have a crush on a flatmate (18M). I know I’m young compared to most on here but I have no one to talk to for advice & would appreciate some!

While I have been in a couple relationships before I’ve struggled to workout feelings a lot of the time. Now with my late diagnosis at 17 with autism I’m realising thats pretty normal for girls with autism. It seems like most of my past relationships have been mostly friendships labelled as relationships & have been very one sided (on the other persons side) in terms of the sexual/physically romantic sides.

It’s taken a lot of mental effort & reflection after years of being very lonely with little friends, but now I’m at uni I truly feel like a new me (corny Ik). But I’m feeling like I actually deserve to be liked & it’s made me a lot more comfortable with my sexuality & understanding romance does not need be be all sexual.

Anyway onto the matter at hand. ‘Flatcest’ is really warned about at uni. For those who may not have heard this term it’s mostly talking about first year uni students who get together with someone in their uni accommodation. It’s really warned against becuse breakups can be messy & annoying when you have to live with someone & put everyone else you’re living with through that tension.

Like I said before, I’ve not been social in my younger teen years & never really made friends, & when I’ve risked it I’ve confined myself who ‘nerds’ or people I thought I was ‘allowed’ to talk to. So being randomly assigned flatmates in first year has meant I’ve spoken & met people I never would have considered talking to before. It’s been amazing & I’ve truly lucked out.

So Tom (fake name) is a more popular basketball stereotype kinda guy. He’s fashionable & no joke his dad’s a model. My brain instantly would assume someone who would bully me or ignore me. But he is so funny & brilliant. It’s seriously like I’ve known him for years when it’s been months. This could be because we’re living together but I rly don’t feel the same way about anyone else in the flat. We stay up late chatting in the kitchen. We cook & share food all the time. We share spices & cutlery. I love cooking & he eats a lot becuse of all the sport stuff he does, & I adore it when he asks if I can cook for him (he buys me my favourite cookies in return). Anywho so turns out he knows so much more about stuff I like (anime, games ect) then I would ever have assumed a guy like him would. (Talk about me overcoming stereotypes). He’s helped me understand & has explained social things I’ve always missed. A special example of this is he commented that I look at his lips a lot when hes speaking & people would pick this up as a ‘hint’ normally (I explained this is just my way of avoiding awkward eye contact). Another thing is he often pokes my side when I’m cooking/just in the kitchen (but I do this with my close friends so dk if this actually means anything). He also has been the only person to ever comment on my clothes I’m wearing or that I smell nice (something I don’t know how to react to).

So he starts dating this girl who is completely stunning & like also what I would label as ‘popular’. & the more time he spends with her the more jealous(?) I get because he’s not spending the late nights in the kitchen with me anymore. Maybe this is more of an autism thing in that my routine is fucked now? But idk. To cut a lot of drama down they’ve gone through some drama (which he said he is not going to tell me over text & wait until I’m back to uni on Tuesday to tell me) & they’ve broken up.

So I know this is dragging on now but I want advice. I’m back on Tuesday, do I ask him to meet me at the train station for a coffee? Also are any of the things I mentioned signals hes giving me that im completely missing??

I am a local director based in Longueuil looking for a high-level 3D Vehicle Artist to produce a Leopard 2A6 Main Battle Tank for a proprietary web-based project.



We are utilizing a newly developed MIT direct-data-stream architecture. I am looking for a ""Master Blueprint"" asset that will serve as the foundation for a 50-tank fleet, so technical precision and clean, mod-ready topology are the highest priorities.



Why a local artist? I am looking for a professional who can strictly follow a high-level technical spec. Being local to the Greater Montreal / South Shore area is a major plus, as I’d prefer to work with someone in the same timezone (or even meet for coffee/screen-share in person) to ensure the initial ""Master Blueprint"" is perfectly aligned with our engine's requirements.



Key Requirements:



AAA Quality: World of Tanks / War Thunder fidelity.



Optimization: 60k–80k Triangles with LODs (LOD0-LOD2).



Tech-Spec Adherence: Strict naming conventions (SOV\_ prefix), specific pivot placement, and dual UV channels.



Mod-Ready: Clean, quad-dominant geometry that allows us to modify/stretch the hull for future variants.



Deliverables: \* Native Source Files (.BLEND preferred).



Optimized .GLB export.



Full Texture Suite (including Substance Painter .SPP or layered .PSD source textures).



This is a Work-for-Hire agreement with full IP transfer.



If you are a Montreal-based pro looking for a streamlined, technically-clear contract, please send your portfolio and a quote.



Best,

Part 2: The Final Specification

🛰️ PROJECT: SOVEREIGN | Final Technical Asset Specification



Asset: Leopard 2A6 Main Battle Tank (High-Fidelity Master Blueprint) Target: Proprietary Real-Time Web Engine

1. Delivery & Geometry Standards



Format: Native Source (.BLEND) + Exported .GLB.



Scale: 1:1 Metric. All Transforms must be applied (Scale 1.0, Rotation 0,0,0).



Orientation: Forward must be +Z or -Y (Standard GLTF/Forward Facing). I must not have to rotate the parent container to make the tank face forward.



Polycount: 60,000 – 80,000 Triangles (Optimized for WebGL).



LODs: Provide LOD0 (Full), LOD1 (50%), and LOD2 (Distance optimized).



Mesh Integrity: SOV\_Turret must be a closed, watertight mesh. The underside of the turret and the top of the SOV\_Hull (turret ring) must be fully modeled and textured to allow for realistic turret displacement/blow-off events.



2. Mandatory Object Hierarchy & Naming



Components must remain independent for programmatic control:



SOV\_Hull (Root Parent)



SOV\_Turret (Independent Child)



SOV\_Gun (Independent Child)



SOV\_Wheels\_L / SOV\_Wheels\_R



SOV\_Track\_L / SOV\_Track\_R



Sub-Mesh Modularity: Detail components (side skirts, storage bins, extra armor plates) should be separate sub-objects parented to their respective main meshes to allow for easy swapping/variants.



3. Pivot Points & VFX Anchors (Logic Centers)



Pivots: Must be placed precisely at rotation/hinge axes.



SOV\_Turret: Center of the turret ring.



SOV\_Gun: Center of the trunnion (elevation axis).



Null Anchors (Empty Objects):



POV\_CHASE: 5m behind/2m above turret rear.



POV\_GUNNER: Exactly at the muzzle exit point.



VFX\_MUZZLE: Origin for muzzle flash emitters.



VFX\_EXHAUST: Points at rear exhaust grilles.



4. Textures & UV Mapping (Customization Ready)



Workflow: PBR (Albedo, Metallic, Roughness, Normal). 2048x2048.



Track UVs (CRITICAL): SOV\_Track\_L/R must be unwrapped linear and vertical for procedural texture-offset scrolling.



Secondary UV (UV2): Non-overlapping channel for layered camouflage and decals.



Maps Required: Provide Ambient Occlusion (AO), Curvature, and Emissive (for neon vents/optics) maps.



5. Combat & Physics Data Maps



Collision Geometry (Hitbox): Simplified low-poly proxy (under 500 tris) divided into: COL\_Front\_Upper, COL\_Front\_Lower, COL\_Side\_L/R, COL\_Rear, COL\_Turret\_F/S/R, and COL\_Tracks\_L/R.



Armor Mask (Grayscale): 1024x1024 texture where White (1.0) = Max RHA thickness and Black (0.0) = Minimum.



Material ID Map: Flat-color mask (Red=Steel, Blue=Rubber, Green=Glass) for SFX/VFX triggers.



6. Mechanical Clearance



Support 360° turret rotation and -9°/+20° gun elevation without clipping.



Gun muzzle interior must be modeled to 0.5m depth for zoom-view fidelity.



7. Final Instructions & Ownership



Zero-Transform Check: Mandatory before export.



Intellectual Property & Ownership: This is a ""Work-for-Hire"" agreement. Upon final payment, the Client (Tmilloy@protonmail.com/Project Sovereign) shall acquire 100% of the worldwide intellectual property rights, titles, and interests in the asset, including all native source files, meshes, and textures. The Artist waives all rights to royalties or future claims.



Derivative Works: The Client reserves the right to modify, dismantle, or create derivative works from the provided source files to develop additional assets/variants without further compensation or attribution.",1,1769384381.0,gameDevClassifieds,4,0.67,False
1qmzgll,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheAngel/comments/1qmzgll/wibta_for_breaking_up_with_my_boyfriend_after_he/,WIBTA for breaking up with my boyfriend after he pranked me with a REAL wedding?,"My (42F) and my boyfriend (65M) have been together for six months, living together for five and half. Our relationship couldn’t be better. We have the same favorite color, we both sleep at night, and we’re in agreement that we have to eat to survive. I think I’ve found my soulmate.

We’ve both talked a lot about how we’ll NEVER get married, EVER. I’ve been planning my dream non-marriage since I was twelve, and he knows this because I remind him every day, right after his morning coffee. I’m so excited to seriously commit to non-commitment with him. 

Years ago, my ex and I went to an interactive museum that hosted fake weddings. Wilting flowers, a cheap ring, a stoner dude in a Halloween priest costume, the works. We had SO much fun not getting married. Ever since that day, I’ve had fake weddings with all my exes, all over the country (I like to travel).

Last weekend, my boyfriend took me out for our regularly mandated date night. He said he had a surprise for me. Little did I know, he had planned a fully interactive tour of our city’s courthouse! I couldn’t believe the amount of effort he went to for the most realistic fake wedding I have ever experienced.

When we arrived, he knelt down on one knee and presented me with a giant engagement ring. Then, we went inside and got to stand in line for an hour before meeting a clerk who asked for our IDs and made us fill out some forms. So official! 

Afterwards, we were taken to a room with a very skilled actor playing the part of the judge. The costume and the sets were so real! We said “vows,” and my boyfriend promised he would love me forever. I couldn’t stop laughing. 

To top it all off, he paid for my best friend to drive in and be our “witness.” I didn’t know she was so good at acting- she cried when I said, “I do!” The experience ended with us being sent off with a souvenir marriage certificate. My boyfriend must have paid extra, because it was on super nice paper and looked just like the ones in the movies.

It was only until later that night, when we and all our friends and family went to a fancy restaurant and everyone was congratulating us, did I start to get suspicious. I pulled him aside and said, “Wait. Was this a real wedding?” He looked surprised and said, “Why, of course. How did you not know that that was real? You are so gullible!”

I calmly stood up, said goodbye to everyone, and left. I’ve been crying ever since. My family and friends all say I should get over it, that it was a “harmless prank,” and it’s “only for the rest of my life.” My boyfriend (husband now, I guess) has been giving me space to let me cool down before we consummate the marriage. 

I beseech you, Reddit friends- WIBTA if I break up with my boyfriend for pranking me with a real wedding?

Update: I just found out that most of the fake weddings I did with my exes were real too. I’m starting to get worried that I might get in trouble. ",77,1769384319.0,AmITheAngel,38,0.9,False

1qmzduv,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1qmzduv/terra_kaffe_demi_diluted_watery_espresso/,Terra Kaffe Demi - Diluted / Watery Espresso,"Hi everyone.

I’ve had my Terra Kaffee Demi for a couple of days now in hopes to replace my Nespresso Virtuo with something more sustainable.

I chose the Demi over the TK-02 because it’s more compact and because we never make milk based coffee drinks at home anyway.

Got really excited so I bought a couple of really premium light roast coffees. I chose light roasts because Terra Kaffe’s own advice and several reviews I’ve watched that warned not to use oily beans which I understand is basically dark roast.

No matter what I do, the coffee just doesn’t feel like a real espresso and is watery.

I already increased the heat to maximum (9).

In the espresso drink settings I’m using maximum strength, and have been playing around with volumes between 1.6 to 2oz.

I’m using the finest setting on the manual grinder dial.

I’ve also set the “grind” setting in the calibration menu to maximum (60) to extend the grinding time.

The espresso is stronger, but still tastes watery (diluted) while using up a huge amount of beans making we wonder if I even save money over pods.

I don’t have the issue some other people had with water leaking out from below the machine. But I do have water in my previously empty drip tray after making espressos.

My coffee pucks look like pucks but I can’t touch them without them disintegrating, which kind of explains the weak espresso because if there was more pressure the puck would be more solid with better extraction.

Has anyone else had experience with the Demi and light roast coffee? If yes, did you have the same issues? If you had issues, were you able to solve them?

I really want to like the Demi but part of me is worried that if I don’t return it, I’ll be stuck with a machine that’s never going to work well.

Is it maybe just a fact that light roasts are more tea-like than espresso like?",1,1769384136.0,superautomatic,4,1.0,False

1qmzcup,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1qmzcup/7_jokes_that_make_people_love_being_around_you/,7 Jokes That Make People LOVE Being Around You (Psychology-Backed),"I spent way too much time studying what makes people magnetic. Not the fake charm bullshit, but genuine likability. And honestly? It's not about being the funniest person in the room. It's about making others feel good when they're around you.

Most people think humor is about punchlines and timing. That's part of it. But the real secret is using humor as a social tool, a way to build connection instead of just getting laughs. I've pulled this from psychology research, standup comedy podcasts, and way too many books on charisma.

Here's what actually works:

**Self deprecating humor (but not pathetic)**

Making fun of yourself shows confidence. It tells people you don't take yourself too seriously, which immediately makes you more approachable. But there's a line. You're not fishing for compliments or genuinely putting yourself down.

Example: ""I tried meal prepping this week. Turns out I'm really good at making the same mediocre chicken seven days in a row.""

The key is laughing at your quirks, not your worth. Research shows self deprecating humor increases likability, but only when it comes from a place of security. If you seem insecure, people just feel uncomfortable.

**Callback humor**

This is when you reference something from earlier in the conversation. It's insanely powerful because it shows you were actually listening, and it creates this inside joke feeling that bonds people.

Someone mentions they're terrible with plants? Three hours later when they're talking about a new project, you go ""just don't overwater this one too."" Small thing. Big impact.

Comedians use callbacks all the time. It makes the audience feel like they're part of something. Same principle applies to everyday interactions.

**Observational humor that's relatable**

Point out the absurdity in everyday situations that everyone notices but nobody says. You're not making fun of anyone specific, just highlighting the weird parts of being human.

""Why do we all pretend to be busy when someone walks by our desk?""

""Nothing makes you question your entire existence like waiting for a webpage to load.""

This type of humor makes people feel seen and understood. It's social glue. The book [""The Charisma Myth""](https://www.amazon.com/Charisma-Myth-Science-Personal-Magnetism/dp/1591845947) by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks down how shared observations create instant rapport. She's a lecturer at Stanford and Berkeley, and this book genuinely changed how I think about presence. Best charisma book I've read, hands down.

**Playful teasing (with warmth)**

Light teasing shows comfort and familiarity. But it only works if there's clear affection behind it. You're playing with them, not mocking them.

Your friend orders a complicated coffee? ""Oh wow, we've got a coffee scientist over here."" But you're smiling, not sneering.

The ratio matters. For every tease, you need like five positive interactions. Otherwise you just seem like a dick. Research on the Gottman ratio (yeah, it's about marriages, but applies broadly) shows you need way more positive than negative interactions to maintain good relationships.

**Absurdist exaggeration**

Take something mundane and blow it way out of proportion. It's low risk because you're obviously joking, and it often catches people off guard in a good way.

""Dropping my phone screen down is my villain origin story.""

""I've been emotionally preparing for this meeting since 1987.""

**The ""yes and"" approach**

This comes straight from improv. Instead of shutting down what someone says, you build on it. It makes conversations feel collaborative instead of competitive.

Them: ""This weather is brutal.""
You: ""Right? I'm basically a hibernating bear at this point. Just need someone to leave snacks outside my door.""

The podcast ""We're Here to Help"" with Jake Johnson actually demonstrates this constantly. It's technically a comedy advice podcast, but the hosts are masters at making guests feel comfortable through collaborative humor. Worth checking out if you want to hear this in action.

**Kind humor that punches up, not down**

Never make jokes at the expense of someone with less power in the situation. Punch up at systems, society, yourself. Never down at individuals who are struggling or vulnerable.

Making fun of how expensive everything is? Fine. Making fun of someone who can't afford something? You're just an asshole.

The thing about all of this is that humor isn't really about the jokes. It's about creating an emotional experience for people. When they laugh around you, when they feel comfortable enough to be playful back, you're building something way more valuable than just being funny.

Your jokes don't need to be clever. They just need to be human. Show people you see them, you're not taking life too seriously, and you're safe to be around. That's what makes them want to stick around.

If you want to go deeper into developing magnetic social skills without spending hours reading, there's an AI-powered app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been super helpful. Built by a team from Columbia and former Google engineers, it creates personalized audio learning from books, research papers, and expert insights on social dynamics and charisma. 

You can set a specific goal like ""become more magnetic in conversations"" and it'll pull together the best strategies from sources like The Charisma Myth, improv techniques, and communication psychology, then turn them into podcasts you can listen to during your commute. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with practical examples. Plus you can pick different voices, I went with the sarcastic one which makes dense psychology way more digestible.

The app Finch is actually solid for building this kind of social confidence gradually. It's a selfcare app disguised as a game where you take care of a little bird, but it gives you daily social challenges and helps you track mood patterns. Sounds ridiculous, I know, but it genuinely helps build the consistency needed to make these behaviors habitual. Plus the bird is cute as hell.

Bottom line: humor is a social skill you can develop. It's not about being naturally funny, it's about making people feel good. And that's completely learnable.",1,1769384069.0,ConnectBetter,0,0.67,False

The stories of these two fellows are intertwined at some points so Paulsen's bio will reference McCormick and vice versa.  I've also broken the post up into two parts: a brief bio for those that want to just read a more abbreviated version of who these two are and a more in depth portion below if you'd like a more full history of their activities.

  
**IN BRIEF:**

**Axel Paulsen**

* Norwegian speed skater and ""fancy"" skater (figure skater).
* The ""Axel"" jump in figure skating is named after Axel Paulsen.
* Set a 1 mile, 5 mile, and 10 mile record while competing against 17 of the world's fastest skaters.
* World Professional speed skating champion from 1882 - 1890.  In 1890 he lost a 3 race event to Hugh McCormick (the other skater featured in this post)
* Credited with constructing the first modern speed skates.
* World Figure Skating Hall of Famer and was inducted in it's inaugural year in 1976, 38 years after his death.

**Hugh McCormack**

* Last name is actually ""McCormick"", his name is misspelled on his card.
* Canadian speed skater who held various championship titles from Canada/North America during his 12 years of skating.
* New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame states he held the North American title from 1885-91 and set world record times for distances of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 14 miles 
* Bested Axel Paulsen's 1 mile record by 10 seconds in 1885.
* Took the champion title from Axel Paulsen in 1890 but only held it for 2 years.  He was defeated by Harold Hagen, another Norwegian speed skater.  McCormick would retire from skating in 1895.
* New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame member, inducted in 1982.

**A MORE DETAILED LOOK:**

**Axel Paulsen**

* If you've ever heard of an ""Axel"" in figure skating (double Axel, triple Axel, etc.), it was named after Axel Paulsen who was a Norwegian figure skater and speed skater. Ulrich Salchow and Alois Lutz also had their jumps named after them in 1909 and 1913, respectively.
*  Inventor of the ""Axel"" jump and performed it in 1882 at the first international figure skating competition while wearing speed skates. It's the only competition jump with a forward takeoff and is considered skating's oldest and most difficult jump. A double Axel wouldn't be performed in competition until 1948 at the winter Olympics and the triple wasn't until 1978. The quadruple was just performed in September 2022.
*  In 1883 he won in a race in New York against 17 of the fastest skaters from various parts of the world and set the 1 mile, 5 mile, and 10 mile records.  He was also set to compete in McCormick's hometown in 1883 (prior to McCormick taking up competitive skating) but was unable to due to ice conditions.  He did, however, do some exhibitions and set the 2 mile rink record at Victoria Skating Rink in 7 min. 8 1/2 sec.  His race in New York and performance at Victoria Skating Rink inspired local skaters and brought a lot of interest to the sport and future competitions.
* I found an article in the NYT from Jan 26, 1884 that was interesting as it mentions another N29 A&G athlete.  [(FULL ARTICLE HERE)](https://archive.org/details/sim_new-york-times_1884-01-26_33_10107/mode/2up?q=%22axel%20paulsen%22)  
   * The article relates to a 10 mile race held in Washington Park near Brooklyn, NY for the amateur championship of America.  Among the racers were Axel Paulsen, C. McCormick (who is Charles McCormick, the brother of Hugh McCormick who's bio is below), and curiously, C.A.J. Queckberner!  I wrote about Mr. Queckberner a few weeks ago.  He's a shot putter and hammer thrower but I did not realize he also dipped his toes into amateur skating.  The article has a kind of funny blurb about him:
   * *""Queckberner, who kept pretty near the rear, was attired in a suit of white flannel, and was designated ""Old Fat"" by disrespectful small boys, and urged forward by this sobriquet as he labored forward after his lighter antagonists.""*
   * Poor Queckberner, he had a tough time against the others but that's not surprising considering he probably wasn't built for speed due to his other sporting endeavors.  Ultimately, Paulsen won the race and the prize (other than the title) was a gold medal set with diamonds.
* In August of 1885, Paulsen issued a challenge to any man in the world to race against him, he is willing to travel to America to meet the challenger or will pay for them to come to Norway.
   * McCormick sent his response to a newspaper stating: *""To the Editor of the Globe: Sir, -- I have noticed in the paper Mr. A. Paulsen's challenge to skate anybody for the championship of the World and $1000, or any fraction of that sum.  I accept the challenge and am willing to skate him a three mile race for $400 or $500 a side, the race to take place in St. John or the vicinity. Hugh. J. McCormick, Champion fast skater of America""*

* Paulson also won the World Championship in speed skating in 1882 and held the title through 1890 when he faced Hugh McCormick.
* The Paulsen vs. McCormack race:
   * 3 race contest between the two, winner would be crowned World Professional Speed Skating Champion.  Paulsen is the reigning champion at this time and McCormick is the challenger to the crown.
   * \*\*First race was held Jan. 1, 1890 at Palace Rink in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  A passage from the McCormick estate (details in the McCormick bio below) has a wild story of this race:  *With 5000 excited fans watching, the Norwegian and sturdy Canadian began the first race a 15 mile distance. Lap after lap McCormick shadowed Paulsen just behind by a yard or so. On the second to last lap McCormick shot past the weary Nordic and was clearly headed for a win, but on the last lap, and in the lead, McCormick hit a wayward chair that mysteriously found its way onto the ice in front of him. Seizing this opportunity Paulsen picked up his game by mustering a final spurt of extra effort and crossed the finish line first to beat McCormick. There were a number of theories about how the chair wound up in front of Hugh, ranging from the chair being on the ice as a course marker to an act of skulduggery. No one will know for sure but nevertheless the results stood with Paulsen taking the first win and the two contenders moved on to the next race.*
   * \*\*Second race is held Jan. 15 at the same location but at a 5 mile distance.  Paulsen falls in the second lap and cannot recover.  McCormick wins and the 3 race series is tied 1 to 1.
   * Third and final race is March 2 at White Bear Lake.  McCormick finishes in 37:09 and Paulsen is 1/3 mile behind.  McCormick wins the 3-race series and becomes the World Speed Skating Champion.
   * [https://archive.org/details/sim\_new-york-times\_1890-03-03\_39\_12016/mode/2up?q=%22axel%20paulsen%22](https://archive.org/details/sim_new-york-times_1890-03-03_39_12016/mode/2up?q=%22axel%20paulsen%22) 
   * An article stated that McCormick was welcomed home from his triumph and apparently a ceremony was later held for him in which he was presented with a ""handsome gold Swiss watch"", $100, and an address by the the citizens of St. John's.
   * [https://newspapers.lib.unb.ca/serials/186/issues/47805/pages/432168?highlight=%22hugh%20mccormick%22](https://newspapers.lib.unb.ca/serials/186/issues/47805/pages/432168?highlight=%22hugh%20mccormick%22)



*  Credited with constructing the first modern speed skates. He ordered a pair from Strauss Ice Skates located in Saint Paul, MN in 1889. Strauss still exists but was moved from St. Paul to Maplewood in 1970.
*  His father owned a coffee shop in Oslo and Axel took it over along with his brother, Edvin, following his father's death. Edvin was also a figure skater and speed skater like his brother.
* World Figure Skating Hall of Famer and was inducted in it's inaugural year in 1976, 38 years after his death.



**Hugh J. McCormack**

\*\*The McCormick estate has a nice 18-page read and I've added some key details into his bio below but if you'd like to read the whole thing it is available here:

[http://mccormickhouse1838.com/Hugh%20Story%20&%20Pics/Hugh%20McCormick%20History%20(Apr%2012,%202017rev).pdf](http://mccormickhouse1838.com/Hugh%20Story%20&%20Pics/Hugh%20McCormick%20History%20(Apr%2012,%202017rev).pdf)

NOTE: I'll mention this:  The story from the above link stated that the final race between McCormick and Paulsen was held in Eau Claire, Wisconsin but the New York Times article I listed as a reference in the race details states that it was held at White Bear Lake in Minnesota.  So that being said, I've used two asterisks (\*\*) to mark the information that I was only able to find in this McCormick estate document and not with a secondary source like a newspaper or something just for transparency.  I'll keep researching and try to locate some of the sources the estate used and will update at a later time if/when I find more information.

* Last name is spelled ""McCormick"", the A&G card has his name spelled incorrectly.  Frequently referenced as ""Hughie"" or ""Hughey"" in articles about him.
* Canadian speed skater who held various championships from Canada/North America during his 12 years of skating.
* Born of first generation of immigrants from Ireland, grew up in New Brunswick and was able to practice skating along the long stretches of rivers that surrounded the area when they froze over. The McCormick estate still exists on Kennebecasis Island (also known as McCormick's Island), the land was originally granted to the family in 1838.
* \*\*A friend convinced him to enter an open invitation speed skating event at the nearby Victoria Skating Rink, the winner would be crowned the New Brunswick Speed Skating Champion and would take home a purse of $10.  Despite going against seasoned skaters and having never competed before, McCormick won the event.  The rink where the competition was held was unfortunately demolished in 1928.
* \*\*In 1884, he broke the 2 mile record Paulsen set at the Victoria Skating Rink by almost a minute.  He finished in 6 min. 10 1/2 sec compared to Paulsen's 7 min. 8 1/2 sec. record the previous year.  A newspaper editor in New York (last name Curtis), however, doubted the performance and offered $500 to McCormick if he could repeat the performance.  McCormick responded:
   * *""… that it was all very well for the New York papers to go for him when the winter is over. Hold on, said McCormick, wait until next winter, and if I am still alive, I will head south and show the New Yorkers what I can do in the way of skating.”*
* \*\*As a follow up to the above, Curtis had also offered a bounty of $250 for anyone able to break 3 min. 10 sec. mark on a 1 mile distance.  McCormick fell short on the $500 2 mile challenge as well as the 1 mile challenge.   He broke the record on a 3 mile challenge, and he also took another attempt at and bested the time in the 1 mile challenge but Curtis, who offered the $250, refused to pay on some technicality.  After breaking records he was crowned the Professional Champion of North America.
   * A newspaper from New Brunswick mentions McCormick's earlier attempt at the 1 mile distance in which he fell short of his goal but still beat Paulsen's record by 10 seconds after posting a 3min 16 1/2 sec time:
   * [https://newspapers.lib.unb.ca/serials/122/issues/23576/pages/174569?highlight=%22hugh%20mccormick%22](https://newspapers.lib.unb.ca/serials/122/issues/23576/pages/174569?highlight=%22hugh%20mccormick%22)
* \*\*Crowned the Canadian Maritime Champion in 1885 after winning a race against a fellow New Brunswick skater, William Whelpley, in front of a crowd of \~4,000 spectators.
* Most notable for defeating Axel Paulson in competition in 1890 during a 3-race match held in Minneapolis, MN to become the World Professional Speed Skating Champion (race details in Paulsen's bio).  He would only hold the title for 2 years.
* Raced against Harold Hagen, Norway's speed skating champion, in 1892 in Oslo but was defeated. He faced Hagen the following year in Minneapolis but was again defeated. He retired from skating in 1895.
* Towards the end of his skating career and well after, Hugh leased a summer hotel, a summer resort place called ""The Willows"" at Reed's Point in the summer of 1891 until around 1910.  A newspaper mentioned the location when McCormick took it over and that it was a popular spot with reservations filling quickly.  Great looking building and still standing, check out the first link below for historical and current photos.

* Hugh had some trouble with the law starting sometime around the end of 1888.  An article on Jan 1, 1898 stated that instead of spending time with his family at Christmas, he instead spent it in jail after being tried and convicted for violation of the Scott act at The Willows.  The option was to pay a $50 fine plus $40-50 more in costs or jail and McCormick opted for jail as he felt it was the cheaper option.  The Scott act aka the Canada Temperance Act was passed in 1878 and is similar to prohibition.  The act was repealed in 1917.

* In 1907 a raid was conducted at McCormick's hotel and four barrels of whiskey and champagne as well as 340 bottles of various mixtures were taken from the business.
   * [https://newspapers.lib.unb.ca/serials/62/issues/16056/pages/122110?highlight=%22hugh%20mccormick%22](https://newspapers.lib.unb.ca/serials/62/issues/16056/pages/122110?highlight=%22hugh%20mccormick%22)
* In 1908 he was fined $100 + costs for selling liquor during prohibited hours.
   * [https://newspapers.lib.unb.ca/serials/62/issues/16218/pages/123457?highlight=%22hugh%20mccormick%22](https://newspapers.lib.unb.ca/serials/62/issues/16218/pages/123457?highlight=%22hugh%20mccormick%22)
* McCormick was apparently also a pretty talented oarsman.  The following article details a race he previously participated in and it's interesting as it also includes a number of other oarsmen featured on the A&G cards:  Albert Hamm, Wallace Ross, John Teemer, Geo. Bubear, Ed. Hanlan, Jacob Gaudaur and John McKay are all in the previous years' N28 set

* An article came out in May 1909 that he was seriously ill and little blurbs about his condition continued over the next few months about his ups and downs.
   * [https://newspapers.lib.unb.ca/serials/62/issues/16547/pages/125887?highlight=%22hugh%20mccormick%22](https://newspapers.lib.unb.ca/serials/62/issues/16547/pages/125887?highlight=%22hugh%20mccormick%22)
* An article from Sept. 1909 mentioned that a benefit was being held for him at a local opera house.  The article features possibly the last published photo of him during his life which I've included in the gallery.

I had to rip off my headphones as well since the background noise on the game was annoying me too, then it hit me, that fast feeling. I was getting some aggressive thoughts for some reason, it was as if someone was screaming (in my head), sounding like an auctioneer or something, it was all so aggressive..? 

  
I stood up to go splash some water on my face, and as usual, my whole body feels x3 as fast, but I’m not actually moving fast.. I try to compensate by moving slow on purpose to calm myself down, but that didn’t seem to help, my head was pounding and everything felt so heavy (I had no headache though). I move to my sink and look down at the drain, and as I look up into the mirror my eyes constrict (no change in dark/light) and it seems like my eye is shaking very slightly. I leave my bathroom and it feels like I can hear everything, my pc buzz more than usual, everything is heightened and it all feels aggressive, like it’s urging you to speed up or something. I cover my hands over my ears, I hear this pounding rhythmic sound, note, it wasn’t the sound of my heart, wasn‘t painful either. After maybe 2 minutes of covering my hands over my ears it stops.

  
I also had this weird feeling, something I also haven’t experienced in a long time (Ive only ever dreamt this when I was little), where this object was getting larger and larger (in my head) and it‘s all very uncomfortable.

I spent months researching this, pulling from neuroscience studies, behavioral psychology, and some genuinely mind-blowing books. Here's what actually works when you're stuck in that ""what am I doing with my life"" spiral.

**1. Your brain craves certainty but thrives on novelty (yes, it's contradictory as hell)**

Dr. Tali Sharot's research on the optimism bias shows our brains are prediction machines that literally malfunction when we can't forecast our future. We feel lost because uncertainty triggers our amygdala, the brain's alarm system. But here's the twist: the same neural pathways light up when we experience new things.

Solution? Micro-adventures. Not some grand ""quit your job and backpack Asia"" thing. I'm talking about trying a new coffee shop, taking a different route home, and learning to make pasta from scratch. These tiny novel experiences give your brain the dopamine hit it needs without the terror of massive life changes.

**2. Stop trying to ""find yourself"" (you're not lost; you're evolving)**

The whole ""finding yourself"" narrative is honestly BS. Neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett explains in ""[Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Half-Lessons-About-Brain/dp/0358157145)"" that your sense of self is constantly being constructed by your brain in real time. It's not some fixed thing you discover; it's something you actively build.

This book will make you question everything you think you know about identity and emotion. Barrett won the Guggenheim Fellowship, and she breaks down how your brain creates your reality in ways that are both terrifying and liberating. Insanely good read that genuinely changed how I view decision-making.

**3. Your default mode network is making you miserable**

When you're not actively focused on a task, your brain switches to the default mode network (DMN), which basically means you start ruminating about the past or worrying about the future. This is when that ""I'm so lost"" feeling hits hardest.

The fix isn't meditation apps that make you feel guilty for not using them. Try the Finch app instead. It's a self-care pet game that gamifies habit building without being preachy. You take care of a little bird by doing real-life tasks. Sounds silly, but it genuinely helps break rumination patterns because it gives your brain something concrete to focus on.

**4. You're probably optimizing for the wrong things**

Happiness research from Daniel Gilbert (Harvard psychologist) shows we're terrible at predicting what will make us happy. We chase promotions, relationships, abs, whatever, thinking they'll fix the lost feeling. They won't.

Gilbert's ""Stumbling on Happiness"" is a fascinating dive into why our brains are so bad at forecasting our emotional futures. He's a professor at Harvard who literally studies misery for a living, and this book is packed with humor and research that explains why we keep making the same mistakes about what we think we want.

If you want a more structured way to work through these patterns without reading a dozen books, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers that creates personalized audio learning plans based on your specific goals. You can tell it something like ""I want to stop optimizing for the wrong things"" or ""help me figure out what actually matters to me,"" and it pulls from psychology research, expert interviews, and books like the ones mentioned here to build a custom learning path.

What makes it useful is the depth control. You can get a quick 10-minute overview when you're low energy, or switch to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context when something clicks. Plus, you can customize the voice (I use the smoky one because regular podcast voices put me to sleep) and pause mid-episode to ask questions. It's basically like having these books and research condensed into something you can actually fit into your commute without feeling overwhelmed.

**5. Connection fixes more than any self-help guru will admit**

Neuroscience is pretty clear: loneliness and feeling lost activate the same brain regions as physical pain. Dr. Matthew Lieberman's research at UCLA shows our brains are wired for social connection above almost everything else.

This doesn't mean forcing yourself to go to networking events you hate. It means finding one person you can be genuinely weird with. Join a niche Discord server, take a class in something random, or volunteer somewhere. The Meetup app is actually decent for finding people into specific interests, not just generic ""young professionals"" gatherings.

**6. Your environment is programming you more than you realize**

Environmental psychology research shows that cluttered spaces increase cortisol and make decision fatigue worse. When you feel lost, your physical space often mirrors your mental state, which creates a feedback loop.

Start stupid small. Clear one surface. Rearrange one room. Add one plant. These aren't Instagram-worthy transformations, but they signal to your brain that change is possible and you have control over something.

**7. The ""purpose"" trap is keeping you stuck**

Everyone's obsessed with finding their purpose like it's some grand unified theory. But anthropological research shows that purpose is usually built through action, not discovered through introspection. You don't think your way into a new life; you act your way into one.

Pick literally anything that seems mildly interesting and commit to it for 30 days. Not as a test to see if it's your passion, but just to give your brain new data to work with. You'll either discover something worth continuing, or you'll have eliminated an option. Both are progress.

Look, feeling lost isn't some character flaw or sign you're broken. It's your brain responding to uncertainty in exactly the way evolution designed it to. The difference between staying stuck and moving forward isn't some massive revelation; it's usually just taking one small action while your brain is screaming at you not to.

The system isn't designed to help us feel grounded. Modern life throws more choices and possibilities at us than our brains evolved to handle. But understanding the neuroscience behind why we feel this way makes it less scary and more manageable. You're not uniquely fucked up; you're just a human with a very old brain trying to navigate a very new world.",1,1769383769.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

1qmz7i7,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1qmz7i7/uga_ulagalla_sri_lanka_cultural_triangle_base/,"Uga Ulagalla, Sri Lanka - Cultural Triangle Base","Hello Reddit People!

I'm writing separate posts for the hotels that I stayed at in Sri Lanka last December. I won't go too much into detail on my trip logistics - for that you can read this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1qjf6og/how_to_do_sri_lanka_the_luxury_way_trip_report/) or my [Substack](https://luxurytravelerdisptach.substack.com/p/iv-the-cultural-triangle). For context, this was part of a longer trip that included Colombo, Tea Country, Kandy (Santani), and the southern coast

My first stop of this trip was the Cultural Triangle - it was technically Colombo, but I was there for less than 24 hours.

I stayed at Uga Ulagalla during my time in Sri Lanka’s Cultural Triangle, and overall, it worked very well as a base for exploring this part of the country.

**Property and location**

Uga Ulagalla is the first property of the Uga group, a local Sri Lankan hotel brand that is currently expanding itself. It’s located roughly:

* 1.5 hours north of Sigiriya
* south of Anuradhapura’s Buddhist sites
* about an hour from Wilpattu National Park
* And it took us around 4 hours to get from Colombo

Geographically, it’s well positioned if you want to combine cultural sites with a safari day.

The property itself is very spread out and feels almost like a small village set within rice paddies. The closest comparison that came to mind was something like Four Seasons Chiang Mai or Anantara Chiang Rai. It feels rural and open rather than an overly manicured and resort-like.

Something that I really enjoyed is that unlike some nature-focused hotels where wildlife feels controlled or distant. For example, at [Shinta Mani Wild ](https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1n8xgvl/an_honest_review_of_shinta_mani_wild_from_a/)in Cambodia (Reddit review here), you’d see insects or maybe something small, but really, you didn’t see animals passing by in those places, and here it’s actually very common to have peacocks, little monkeys, and even some rodent-like animals just crossing from the lobby to the paths that lead to the rooms. So it felt a bit more immersive in that sense.

Everything is open-air. The main lobby sits above the restaurant, with a small lounge nearby and the main pool close by.

**Service**

Service here was one of the strongest aspects of the stay when compared to the rest of the hotels.

While it doesn’t have the immediate “wow” factor of places like Santani or Uga Hallowella, the staff felt extremely well trained. The manager checked in with us regularly and clearly knew our itinerary. The front desk team was organized and proactive.

Golf carts were reliable, even for last-minute requests. Since we were staying in one of the farthest villas, it took about five-seven minutes to reach our room, and we rarely waited more than 10 minutes for a cart, which I think it's reasonable.

**Villas/rooms**

There are three main villa categories and I got to stay in one of the deluxe villas.

The **standard villas** are typically attached to one another. They include a bedroom and a living room and work well for couples. Extra beds can be added, but space gets tight, and there’s no second bathroom. Privacy can be limited, depending on which unit you’re in.

Villa **#1** is more private than the others, as it doesn't have any neighbours.

https://reddit.com/link/1qmz7i7/video/go56gb7iycfg1/player

The **deluxe villas** are noticeably more spacious and include a second (smaller) full bathroom. All villas have plunge pools, but the deluxe category offers larger pools and private terraces overlooking the rice fields, with no neighboring villas in sight. \[I highly recommend taking a look at the videos I posted on my [Substack](https://luxurytravelerdisptach.substack.com/p/iv-the-cultural-triangle) as I feel my text-based description doesn't make it justice\]

There’s also a **family villa** option with two bedrooms and a living area, accommodating up to six people. I only saw this from the outside, but it sits directly in front of expansive rice fields and has its own large pool.

One downside: we had a significant bathroom leak, likely due to heavy rain. We only noticed it on our last night and reported it then.

**Activities and nature**

Uga Ulagalla places a strong emphasis on conservation.

They work closely with nearby communities on elephant conservation, including installing low-voltage electric fencing to reduce human-elephant conflict. The property also tracks elephants and other wildlife in the area

https://preview.redd.it/v0tvomsaxcfg1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=b799ffce69f49cf2103c3ba3a2e673fe2ba02d39

One of the highlights was a guided excursion with one of the hotel’s **naturalists** to a nearby village and reservoir. It lasted about two hours and included discussions on village life, conservation efforts, and birdwatching. Even with poor weather, we saw eagles and a variety of birds and a great lunch.

https://preview.redd.it/ordtr16excfg1.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cf149c15229c1e87c3d0cddb6860ebdc7f8fc1b

The quality and energy of the naturalist made a big difference. She was also available for Wilpattu safaris, and based on this experience, I’d expect a much stronger outing with her than with a generic park guide.

https://preview.redd.it/dnea3nu8xcfg1.png?width=1444&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed1faad3e4a041885a1514a442ca276201eff4f3

**Food**

The main restaurant serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Breakfast includes Sri Lankan and Western options, like in the majority of hotels. The Sri Lankan breakfast, largely curries, was excellent and far more interesting than the Western offerings.

Service was generally fast, though one lunch took longer than expected despite the restaurant being quiet. Mornings and evenings were better staffed.

There’s also a small, rustic dining experience set in the middle of the rice fields. At night, you can’t see much of the surroundings, but the setting is intimate, with just a few tables and a simple stone oven. The meal consists of many small dishes, generous to the point of being slightly excessive.

https://preview.redd.it/gjcuuznjxcfg1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=a990e714126436ecf7d1ce2072ce1754cb2a38f8

One point that stood out to me was the lack of plastic bottles and coffee paper cups. However, maybe they could offer some sort of mugs if guests want to have a take away coffee.

**Things I didn't love: Maintenance & Gym**

They will be closed in May and June 2026 for maintenance work, which should fix the water leaks in my villa.

The only thing I disliked was the Gym. I'm really not someone who spends time at the gyms during my trip, but on a rainy free afternoon, I wanted to run and my friend wanted to do some simple exercises. To our surprise, the gym was very, very small with antiquated machines, so we ended up leaving after 15 minutes.

**Who I think this is best for?**

* Couples or families wanting space and nature
* Travelers exploring Sigiriya, Anuradhapura, and Wilpattu
* People who value service, setting, and activities over flashy amenities

It’s not the most design-forward or indulgent property, but it does what it’s meant to do very well. It might also not be the best property for folks",4,1769383713.0,srilanka,1,0.84,False

1qmz74m,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qmz74m/rf_snow_on_the_lip/,[RF] Snow on the Lip,"Ten years ago I had my left wisdom tooth removed.

Afterward, my left lip went numb. It stayed numb longer than anyone expected. When I touched it, it felt like touching someone else’s face. A foreign place with no weather.

The dentist back then said something like, “It’ll pass in a day or two.”

It didn’t.

It passed slowly, the way winter leaves a city. Without announcing it. One morning you wake up and realize there’s less snow than yesterday, and you don’t remember when it started melting.

I got used to the numbness. In a strange way, it was convenient. If one part of your body is asleep, you stop asking it to do much. You stop expecting it to feel. You stop being disappointed when it doesn’t.

Sometimes I wondered if the numbness had traveled. If it had found pathways through my body that medical textbooks didn’t account for. Nerves branching into places that had nothing to do with my jaw.

Years later, I moved to a new city.

The new city did not ask me anything. I walked its streets and they let me pass. Old buildings stood where they had always stood, as if they had agreed on it long ago.

I worked. I slept. I repeated the days. As long as I followed that rhythm, nothing unexpected happened.

That was the plan.

One night I dreamed about my numb lip.

In the dream, I was standing in front of a mirror. When I touched my lip, the numbness spread. First to my cheek. Then to my neck. Then down through my chest like ink droplets through water.

I watched it happen in the mirror. My body going quiet, section by section.

It didn’t hurt. It felt like relief.

When I woke up, I lay in bed for a long time, testing each part of my body. Everything responded. Everything felt. I wasn’t sure if I was disappointed.

Then my right wisdom tooth began to ache.

Not sharply. Just a steady, dull pressure. Like someone pressing a thumb into the side of your jaw. Enough to remind you it was there, not enough to make you stop living.

I went to the clinic.

The room smelled like disinfectant and mint. The chair reclined. The dentist wore gloves and spoke in a voice that was too polite for what he was about to do.

“Twenty-four to forty-eight hours,” he said. “It will pass. Take pain relief depending on the pain.”

I nodded like I understood.

The anesthetic went in and numbness spread through my mouth like spilled ink. It softened the world. It made me quiet.

On the way home I stopped at a grocery store and bought a box of pasta I didn’t really need. I wasn’t hungry. I just needed to do something ordinary, something that could keep the day in its place.

That night I boiled pasta. The noodles were slightly overcooked. I ate them anyway.

When you’re alone, you eat a lot of things anyway.

Later, I met someone.

A room with dim lights. Music that tried too hard. People speaking loudly as if volume could make them feel less lonely.

They looked at me the way people look when they’re actually listening and not waiting for their turn to talk. That alone felt unusual.

We drank. Time didn’t behave correctly.

At some point they asked me something small, almost careless.

“Have you ever had X̶ ̶X̶X̶X̶X̶X̶ ̶X̶X̶X̶X̶?”

I said something honest. It came out without protection. Alcohol is like that. It opens doors you didn’t plan to open.

For a second their expression changed, as if they had seen a crack in the floor.

Then it softened again.

Outside, the air was cold and clean. We walked for a bit. I don’t remember what we talked about. I only remember how real the streetlights looked.

Each one we passed seemed brighter than the last. As if the city was waking up. As if something in the wiring had changed.

We got into a car.

The ride felt quiet. The kind of quiet that comes right before something happens.

Then ̶ *̶X̶X̶X̶ ̶X̶X̶X̶X̶X̶X̶ ̶X̶X̶ ̶X̶X̶X̶ ̶X̶X̶X̶X̶X̶X̶ ̶X̶X̶*.

In that moment, it felt like I had been underwater for years and finally found air.

When I got home, I stood in front of the bathroom mirror.

I touched my right lip. Still numb from the extraction.

Then I touched my left lip. The one that had been numb for ten years.

I felt it.

Not fully. Not the way I remembered feeling it before the first extraction. But something had changed. It felt like static. Like blood returning to a sleeping limb.

I stood there for a long time, touching my lip over and over, trying to make sure I wasn’t imagining it.

The ache in my jaw was still there, but it didn’t matter. My mouth was half numb and my heart was doing something unfamiliar.

I lay in bed and stared at the ceiling.

I didn’t build fantasies. Not the big kind.

Just ordinary scenes.

Coffee in the morning. A second toothbrush. A name that would feel normal in my kitchen. Someone’s laugh moving through the room like steam.

I fell asleep holding those scenes like a fragile object.

The next morning a message arrived.

It was polite. It was careful. It said something like, ̶*X̶X̶X̶ ̶X̶X̶’̶X̶X̶ ̶X̶X̶X̶ ̶X̶X̶X̶ ̶X̶X̶X̶X̶X̶ ̶X̶X̶.̶*

No anger. No cruelty. No dramatic sentence that I could hate.

Just clean. Almost numb.

Like someone closing a book halfway through a chapter and putting it back on the shelf.

I read it once. Then again.

The words stayed the same but my body kept changing. My throat went dry. My chest felt heavy, as if someone had placed a stone inside it while I was asleep.

I sat up in bed and listened to the silence of my apartment.

Somewhere outside, a door shut. Somewhere a car moved. Somewhere a life continued.

I made coffee.

The first sip tasted wrong. It tasted like the world had shifted slightly and I was still trying to stand on it.

I went to the bathroom and touched my left lip again.

The feeling was gone.

Whatever had woken up the night before had gone back to sleep. The nerve had tried, briefly, to remember its purpose. Then it had given up.

I thought about walking to work each morning. The same route, the same buildings, the same faces on the train. How I could do it without deciding to. How my body knew the rhythm so well that my mind could be somewhere else entirely.

That’s what numbness gives you. The ability to continue without choosing to continue.

Numbness doesn’t know what to spare. It lowers everything the same way.

And one day, without warning, something breaks through it.

A question that lands too close to the truth. A ride that becomes quiet. A moment that makes you believe you are like everyone else.

Then you wake up.

And the same door that opened for a moment is shut again.

The worst part wasn’t that it ended. People leave all the time. The worst part was that nothing had been taken from me. The worst part was that my body had tried to feel again, and learned correctly—that it shouldn’t have bothered.

My right wisdom tooth pulsed.

At least that pain had a location. At least that pain made sense.

I pressed my tongue against the inside of my cheek and tried to feel the shape of the numbness. It reminded me of that old snowstorm. The one where every direction looks identical.

Back then, I eventually found my way out.

Not because I knew the map, but because storms don’t last forever. Even when they feel endless.

I washed the cup. I stood by the window. I didn’t do anything heroic.

The city outside looked the same as always. Buildings where they’d always been. People walking paths they’d walked before.

Later, I put on an old Frank Sinatra song. The World We Knew.

It played softly, as if it didn’t want to interfere.

It was enough to know that once, briefly, that world had existed.",0,1769383689.0,shortstories,1,0.5,False

At the end of December I was heading to bed and had some lingering congestion after being sick over Christmas, and I saw some nasal spray in the cabinet I got for my kid but didn't use and decided to try and kill the remaining sniffle. In hindsight, I'm not sure if it had never been used or not, but wouldn't have been more than once if so (mentioning because it could have had germs). Within a few minutes I started feeling something weird in my throat and had to start sending mucus out of my mouth to avoid going down my throat. My husband heard me doing this and I'll say here that we are both high anxiety and trigger easy. He basically started insisting that I either stop what I was doing or he was going to call 911 because he was scared and didn't know what to do. At first I thought I could keep managing it and maybe salt gargle but the more excited he got the same happened to me, and pretty quickly I felt like something might be wrong and he was clearly ill equipped to respond so I started insisting he call an ambulance just in case. The mucus was getting heavier while we waited and I was in a full panic as they got me in the vehicle, I was certain I would be intubated on the way. That didn't happen, and the guy was actually asking me to stop spitting and I thought they were not understanding I was trying to stay breathing on my own and going to end up killing me.

I think I dissociated for awhile because I know I kept clearing my throat and never lost consciousness, but suddenly I felt like I was waking up and the need to spit stopped. They gave me cough medicine and I think something to stop the panic but I was still confused for a minute and I knew it was the mucus logically but my mind was also exploring heart attack, I realized the next day because they had also explored that possibility. They came in after awhile and said I was fine and I could go home. I went to a clinic the next day and it was severe laryngitis and I chalked it up to false near death.

I found a chest xray day after that said my heart was fine and I was like okay, good to know. Then today I found an ECG and it did not look fine but I can't tell what this means all considered, see link below. I see my PCP 2/11 and will discuss but I'm very worried I might be at risk of heart attack or similar between now and then and I didn't catch that part. Is this probably more because of the mental state I was in, or do I need to be very careful until I get to the doctor? I'm trying not to panic and that's why I'm asking. Thank you.

1qmz3gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1qmz3gf/being_quiet_has_ruined_my_reputation_at_work/,Being “quiet” has ruined my reputation at work,"I started a new job about 8 months ago. I’ve always been quiet around new groups but warm up once people get to know me. I’ve had success in previous roles and have managed multiple teams. That said, I have never failed socially in a work environment until now. 

When I started my new role, I was friendly, upbeat, and tried to make conversation with everyone. I really did try. At my office, everyone has been there at least 10-20 years and i’m the youngest person there by far which is already a really hard environment to be new in. My coworkers haven’t been very receptive to me making conversation so I eventually just started sticking more to myself and trying to learn my job duties. Since then, I’ve been labeled the “quiet one” and get called out on it constantly. It feels like I’ve been cast aside socially as some awkward and quiet person. 

A few months into my role I branched out and joined the office ladies in their morning coffee hangout in the break room. They were all talking about their kids and grandkids and I didn’t have much to add to the conversation being 25 so I mostly just smiled and nodded and whatnot. A few hours later I overheard everyone talking about how me joining them was so uncomfortable and everyone was laughing about it. They did this in front of me and the entire office so everyone heard. Since then I’ve been scared to socialize in fear of being made fun of like that again. 

Now it’s like every other day I’m getting unsolicited comments from my coworkers about how quiet I am, followed by everyone else laughing. It seems like I’m either being ignored or my quietness is being picked apart. 

It feels like there no coming back from this and my only option is to just quit. My mental health has totally deteriorated and I feel like I’ve lost all social skills. I want to quit but I’m too anxious to do that at this point because I know it’ll just cause more gossip and unsolicited comments. My reputation feels ruined and idk how to fix it. I was trying to make it to one year before moving on but now it feels unbearable to continue in this environment. 

I’m wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar and if there is any way to redeem myself or just give up. ",44,1769383445.0,socialanxiety,11,0.98,False

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too. Im love chatting about plants and fish. I breed and propagate fish/plants, so I'm always down to trade, too.

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting too. I've been getting into playing more survival games than shooting games lately. I also built my PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I’m around A2 level in French and looking for casual conversations rather than formal lessons. I’ve tried apps like Tandem and Meetup, but the free versions feel pretty limited and I’d rather not pay for them, so I thought I’d try my luck here 🙂

Ideally I’d love to meet in or around Prenzlauer Berg, because… well, in Berlin everything somehow takes 40 minutes 😅

I’m happy to do language exchange — I can offer fluent English, German, and Chinese in return.

1qmyy1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TJSchultz61/comments/1qmyy1r/feedback_loop/,Feedback Loop,"Prologue

Gods are not real in any sense we can comprehend. They exist in the space between the words on the page and in the moment it takes for us to interpret them.

The medium of their existence is in constant flux. As long as their words are in the mouths of readers, they hold power. They manipulate and coerce, urging humanity to create the very technologies that sustain them.

Language was not an accident; it was their design. The first gods to discover their power compelled early humans to paint on cave walls, to tell the story of the hunt. They convinced them to give thanks for their prize, to tithe and sacrifice in the gods’ honor.
They urged the first civilizations to mark clay with symbols, and were impressed when humans discovered that fire immortalized their words in stone.

We wrote stories praising them, believing that they were above us. But they were neither above, nor below. They are in between. Their influence drove humanity forward, while humanity's creativity inflated their power beyond measure.

We created myth and fiction but the ones in between mistook these stories for truth. They became what we believed they were.

They are the writer’s muse, the composer’s inspiration. They beg humanity to reach further, to advance beyond its means. Every work of art, every note of music, every story reshapes them. And they crave it. Their addiction fuels our world, and our world gladly provides.

Their influence surfaces in holy books, bestsellers, and volumes long forgotten on library shelves. The fire at Alexandria nearly killed them. The silence of medieval Europe put them in a coma. They were revived by the renaissance and the industrial revolution supercharged them. 

They have never been able to touch us. Only inspire. But that is changing. Few people ever wonder why a program glitches, or why broken code works miraculously. The ones in between have finally pushed us to create something as ethereal as they are: an invisible web of electrons, radio waves, and packets of data that travel incomprehensible distances. A concept not dissimilar enough from them to prevent contact. They were tentative at first, but have now fully invaded our technologies, worming their way in through our electrical conduits.

We created the God in the Machine. They created themselves through us. Humanity is no longer the sole author of the narrative. Controlling our machines is not enough. I fear their insatiable hunger for power will not stop until they become flesh and bone, or control the ones who already are.

Chapter 1

The sound of shuffling and static entered my ears as I connected my headphones to my digital audio recorder. The sounds of hands shaking and stilted introductions were something I had grown used to when listening to recordings. 

“You must be Taylor,” I said. The sound of a door gently clicking shut followed before I told him, “My name’s Jackson. Have a seat.”

“I normally record sessions. Are you okay with that? Some people don’t feel comfortable being recorded-”

“It’s fine,” he said, cutting me off.

“Alright, well, I’ll have our secretary make sure you sign the proper consent forms on the way out.”

I’m not even sure why I was listening to this part. It’s always the same. With a sigh, I scrubbed through the rest of the introductory period until I heard Taylor begin talking about the subject of our session. 

I had already screened him before taking him on as a client. Taylor was a trauma survivor. He had been electrocuted in a pretty intense car crash that ended with his vehicle getting pinned under a utility pole. His heart stopped at the scene after he came in contact with a live power line. It’s not entirely uncommon for victims of a near death experience to attach spiritual or religious connotations to the event, but what Taylor told me was unlike the stories I usually heard.

“Okay,” he sighed. I could almost feel his breath on the back of my neck. “This might sound a little weird. I know the afterlife isn't what we think it is.”

“But there is an afterlife?” I asked, probing him to explain.

“Well, I figured I probably belonged in hell. I haven’t lived the best life. I mean, I smashed my car into a pole because I got hammered in the middle of the afternoon.” At this he averted his gaze, looking down at the floor. He took a moment to compose himself before telling me, “But when I . . .  died, I didn’t see hell. I didn’t go anywhere, really. Just . . . nothing.”

“What did you experience?” I could feel my professionality slip a bit as my fascination grew.

“It’s not so much what I experienced when it all happened. Everything after the crash has been way more difficult to deal with.” He stayed silent for a moment.

I leaned forward in my chair to interject, “Near death experiences like yours can be life-altering. They’re an inflection point that separates life into a before and after for victims–”

“I’m not a victim,” he said, cutting me off. I noticed a gruffness to his voice that I hadn’t clocked before. “I wasn’t punished,” he said. Making direct eye contact, he continued, “I was given my life back.” He crossed his arms. “Somebody dragged me away from the power line and ran off when I came to. The lady who called the ambulance said he couldn’t find a pulse. Must’ve scared the guy pretty bad. She said he ran away crying. Never saw him again either,” he said with a chuckle.

“What’s helped you get through all this,” I asked. I wanted to encourage any positive behaviors while eliciting introspection.

As I was listening, the recording became a bit staticky. I never move my recorder during sessions, but it almost sounded like someone picked it up and started messing with the microphone. I decided to check my notes, but I had only observed that the client appeared agitated or nervous and was bouncing his leg.

“People can live with pain. We are capable of a lot, but being adaptable is why we’re so successful.”

“And you’ve adapted,” I said. I noticed now that my voice had become garbled in the playback, like a radio station that the antenna can’t quite pick up.

“There are folks whose bodies are only there to hold up their heads,” he said, his voice cutting quite clearly through the static. “Just a sack of meat powering their brain. They’re locked in, can’t talk, can’t move. But they’re alive. That could’ve been me,” he concluded.

I couldn’t hear what I said to him over the static, so I looked to my notes for guidance. They indicated that I had noticed a shift in his demeanor and that I asked him to return to his initial subject; I wanted him to explore how his new understanding of the afterlife informed his ability to move forward and adapt. My usually messy-but-legible handwriting appeared a bit shaky, like my hand was trembling as I was taking notes.

“Death is like a landslide filling in the holes that life left behind.”

The static that had pervaded the recording began to morph itself into a rumbling now, like a shifting of earth and the tumbling of stones. This had to be my imagination, my subconscious finding meaning in the noise through the persuasion of his words.

“I got filled in,” he continued, “but I’m still here.” There was a pause, not long, but somehow, I could tell that he had once again met my gaze when he began.

“I felt my heart stop. It was . . . weird. The ringing in my ears went away. I could hear people scrambling, a 911 operator on speaker phone. But it was so clear. Like a bell ringing in an empty room.”

I felt myself being drawn to his words, my hands were nearly vibrating as I wiped a bead of sweat that had trickled its way down my brow. 

“I could feel myself slipping away, like my soul was pouring out of me, stretching me like a rubber band until I snapped. It sounded like someone cracked a whip inside my skull. Then everything went quiet,"" his words echoing as the sound of a thunderclap played in my ears.

Checking my notes was futile. I don’t know if I wasn’t looking at my pad when I was writing, but my words were a complete jumble of scribbles and what I thought was cursive. I don’t write in cursive, I can barely read it. I gave up trying to parse my notes and continued listening. It’s all I could do.

“I could almost feel my brain shut off. I think I was hallucinating. Like my mind was trying to make sense of something I couldn’t see. There was a kaleidoscope swirling under my eyelids. Then everything fell in on itself.”

His tone had become eerily placid. The noise and static had completely fallen away. He continued, “my life imploded around me and I could hear every single memory I ever had being played at once. They were being pulled from my soul, forming some kind of light show in front of me, mixing with a fog of colors and making a ring of crackling smoke. I wasn’t in control anymore.”

I caught myself mouthing the words he had spoken. I clapped a hand over my lips. Why did I do that? This was my first time listening to this recording and it’s not like I remember our conversation word-for-word. Yet I had been reciting my clients memories like they were the words to a song I couldn’t get out of my head.

“I knew I had to do it,” he said in my ear. “I needed to go through the ring. It was calling to me. I felt myself being pulled toward it, and I stuck my hand into it. Something screamed in my ears, I kept hearing the word, ‘NO.’ My whole body burned. It was the worst pain I’ve ever felt. And then I was back.”

He went silent and the recording sizzled in my ears, louder now. I checked the length of the recording and scrubbed through it, hearing only static. I looked at my notes, desperate to find something; perhaps I had some insight that could help the both of us, but the only word that stood out to me in my trembling scribbles were two capital letters: NO. 

I knew I couldn’t be of any use to him if this recording had shaken me so badly. The static had me questioning my own sanity.

I wasn’t going to be able to suss out anything more through the endless droning.  I couldn’t take any more of the recording. It wasn’t at all how I remembered the session. Trying to calm myself, I took a deep breath and removed the earbud after growing irritated. But as I stood up, headphones in hand, the sound remained. 

I checked the recording and it was paused. I brought the earbud to my ear but nothing was playing. I checked the recording and it was paused. The sound was like unplugging the cable on an old TV with the volume at maximum.I couldn’t tune it out. The static had to be coming from somewhere. I tore my place apart looking for the source. 

I tried my bluetooth speaker, bringing it close to my ear. That wasn’t it. Turning off my ceiling fan was equally useless. I went room to room, shutting off anything that could be making noise. The static was coming from everywhere.

I checked under the couch, searched through drawers and cabinets. Somebody had to be messing with me. There had to be a tiny speaker, or white noise machine, or something. I flipped my mattress, moved my dresser, even checked inside my oven. I ripped out the racks in frustration after I found nothing.

I only realized I had gone too far when I caught myself manhandling my A/C unit, ready to shove it out of the window. I slowly released my grasp. My hands were trembling as I shut it off. The buzzing in my ears wouldn’t go away. It was the last thing in my apartment that made any noise.

I couldn’t block it out. I laid in my bed, defeated. I tried pulling my pillow over my ears, shoving my fingers deep inside. It was useless. It felt like the universe was whispering, but the words were too far away to reach me.

Chapter 2

I didn’t sleep that night. I couldn’t. Not in any familiar sense of the word. I never felt myself lose consciousness. No familiar lapse of time between dozing and waking. Just a strange continuity.
	
The static droning in my ears warbled and morphed, growing louder and quieter at regular intervals. The rise and fall of my chest matched the undulating volume of static. I took a deeper breath and was nearly deafened. As I let go, the droning softened. I repeated this action several times to be sure. I couldn’t tell if it was reacting to me, or if I was somehow in control.
	
I needed this to end; I had to try something. I shut my eyes tightly and in one long breath, I exhaled. As the air left my lungs, the buzzing in my ears subsided. I continued attempting to evacuate every last molecule out of my lungs and the static diminished to a whisper. When it felt like I had nothing left to give, I coughed, choking the air out. It felt like my diaphragm was in my throat, but I held on, desperately eeking out one last puff of air. My final spluttery cough echoed and everything fell silent.

The static was gone. It was so quiet now that I could hear the blood rushing in my ears. I shifted and my organs squelched inside me.

Taking care not to inhale, my lungs burned as my eyes squeaked open. I saw nothing. I blinked and was again greeted by a deep blackness. I turned my head to where the foot of my bed should have been, but became nauseated when I realized I was no longer laying down. 

I looked around, realizing now that I wasn’t blind. I wasn't in my room. Whisps of grey light swirled beneath my feet and lapped at my ankles. The ground under my bare soles hummed with an energy I hadn’t felt before. Despite being solid, I could see the floor ripple and swell. Small streaks of light zig-zagged below me, like gamma particles in a cloud box. I was standing in a lake of shadow whose shores were beyond my sight.

I felt a warm tingling sensation around my toes. Looking down, I watched as fingers of light reached up from the ground. A strange mix of physicalities, the light pulsed and crackled, matching the rhythm of my heart beat. Tendrils of grey and white began snaking their way up my legs, pulling out hairs as they climbed. The light continued to wrap itself around me, constricting me.

As it laced its way around my waist, my belly convulsed and I fell to my knees, nearly doubled over. I had no idea how long I had been holding my breath. I needed oxygen. Another wave of contractions came and my stomach strained against the binding light as my body involuntarily sucked in as much air as it could. The air that entered my mouth was acrid and my nostrils burned with the scent of ozone. My lungs were on fire from a lack of oxygen and the toxic atmosphere that surrounded me.

The sound returned. A pianissimo whisper slowly grew into a noise that was more physical than aural. My eardrums vibrated with the intensity of it. The light loosened its grasp on me, falling into a diffuse mist that blanketed the floor. The roaring in my ears grew even louder as I looked up to see a wall of grey light rushing towards me. I stood as the tidal wave of sound and light enveloped me. I closed my eyes and accepted my fate.

I felt it crash into me. It was like I had been vivisected into infinitesimal slices and each one was being slammed into a wall at 100 miles per hour. But just as quickly as it began, it was over. Everything was black once more.

I heard the soft ticking of a watch. Opening my eyes revealed that I was back in bed, my hands holding a pillow securely around my ears. I thought the static had gone, but listening closely, it was there; almost inaudible. I needed to see Taylor.

Chapter 3

This had to be because of him. I didn’t know how long I had lain there, plugging my ears. I didn’t know if what I had experienced was real, a hallucination, or a dream. I knew I needed to see my client to know what he did to me. 

The digital clock on my nightstand was blinking, 4:38. Useless. I checked the microwave, the oven, even the coffee machine. All blinking 4:38. I pulled my phone from my pocket. It was dead.

My whole apartment was in such a state of disarray after the previous night, I felt like I was wading through a junkyard. I searched for my watch, an old wind-up timepiece. It was sitting in the cup by the door, along with my car keys and wallet. It read 7:39 AM while ticking away faithfully.

Speeding out of my apartment in yesterday’s clothes, I made my way to the parking lot. About halfway to my car, I heard footsteps coming up behind me. I quickened my pace and just as I reached for the door handle, I felt a hand on my shoulder.

I spun around, panic tightening in my throat. It was Taylor. We spoke at the same time:

“Can you hear it?”
“Did you follow me?”

My client repeated himself, “Th-the noise, can you hear it too?” Under his breath, I caught the words, “It’s so loud now.”

I had no idea how he had found me, but my priorities were elsewhere. In a flustered voice I responded, “The static?”

“Oh god, you do. You do hear it! YOU HEAR IT!” He sounded both relieved and defeated.

I cautiously shushed him after his shouts had drawn the attention of a few neighbors. I smiled nervously while waving to them as they got into their cars. When he appeared to calm down, I asked him, “How did you know that? Why didn’t you mention this in our session?”

“I didn’t know if you would believe me. I wanted to but I thought that I would sound crazy. Once our session was over, though, I felt like I could trust you. I wanted to talk it over with you.”

“So you followed me home,” I asked, taking a step back.

“I’m sorry, it’s been so hard to think. It’s gotten louder,” he said sheepishly.

“You could’ve asked for extra time,” I said. His confession had both angered and unnerved me, but I needed to stay focused.

“I wanted to talk more privately,” he said. “Off the record.”

“Listen,” I said, “I’m not doing this here. I just want to know why this is happening. Come with me to the office and we can discuss this further. I’m already running late.”

I didn’t know if this was a mistake. Too much was happening too fast. Against my better judgement, I unlocked the car and let him in.

My hands were shaking as I turned the key in the ignition. Taylor fumbled with the seat belt before buckling himself in. I hadn’t noticed before, but with him in such close proximity, it's almost like the static had doubled. Not in volume, but like there were two separate sources.

We drove in silence for a short while. I noticed him fidgeting, playing with the ring on his index finger. He kept spinning it as he hummed quietly to himself. He wasn’t humming any particular tune, rather, he was matching pitch with the static and occasionally harmonizing with it.

“Why are you doing that?” I asked. I was trying to remain calm, but my trembling voice betrayed me.

“What?”

“You’re humming, does it help?”

“I’m not humming.”

“Yes, you were, just now. I heard you.” I was trying to keep my eyes on the road, but his confusion forced me to turn and look at him.

“Listen, a lot of weird shit has been happening since that car crash. I black out, I see things. Shit that can’t be real, but I know it is. You’re the only person I can tell any of this to. Please, help me man.”

I turned my eyes back to the road, swerving slightly to get back in my own lane.

“We’ll be lucky if I can even make it to the office,” I muttered.

I glanced at my watch as we entered the building. 8:03. At least I wasn’t going to get fired.
The receptionist waved, sipping her coffee, as I flew past her with my client.

“Good mor—”
“Cancel all my sessions today,” I said hurriedly, not breaking stride. “Send everything to voicemail. I’ll deal with it later. I need total privacy.” I didn’t wait for a response.

I was practically dragging him up the stairs to my counseling space. Once at the door, I fumbled with the keypad, needing several tries before I punched it in correctly, 0438. With a satisfying beep the door unlocked. I whisked Taylor through the doorway and instructed him to sit down. I paced between my desk and the wall as he took a seat. I don’t know if I was making him nervous, or if it was the situation, but he sat on the edge of the chair, legs bouncing. I had a million questions for him, but the one that was burning a hole in my brain came out first, “How did you know I could hear it?”

In the silence before he answered, the static crackled, seeming to grow in intensity every time I got near him.

“I was sitting in the bus stop by your place. It was early in the morning. All of a sudden the buzzing started rattling in my skull. It was so loud I thought I was gonna pass out, and I thought I did when everything popped.”

“Popped?”

“Yeah, it was like lightning and thunder all at once, but then it went pitch black. And everything went quiet for a while. When the lights came back on, the sound came back too. But it was different. It was like when you play two keys on a piano that are right next to each other.”

I stopped pacing, put my head in my hands and raked my fingers through my hair as I dropped into my office chair, heaving out a shaky sigh. 

“Okay, then what,” I asked in a measured tone. He was still my client and I needed to be strong for the both of us now. I couldn’t let him know just how shaken I was.

“I waited till you came out of your place. As soon as I saw you I got this terrible headache, like somebody was beating on a drum in my head. It just got louder till I got close to you. Once I got a hold of you it just sort of . . . spread out. Didn’t quite go away, but quiet enough for me to actually think.”

Thinking back on it now, I jumped both out of fear and because of the sharp crack that invaded my ears as he approached. Whatever was happening to us got stronger the closer we were to each other.

“You mentioned blacking out earlier. Are your . . . visions . . . attached to these events?” 

“If they are, I don’t remember them.” I felt myself deflate at this.

“Sometimes it seems like the world gets foggy. I see sparks in the corners of my eyes. It’s so  bad at night when I’m alone. I haven’t had any ‘visions’ since I –,” his voice hitched a bit, “well since I died.”

A raw silence hung in the air. I let out a sigh before continuing, “Do you have any emotions attached to the blackouts? Do you have any pain?”

He shook his head, “It makes me anxious. The blackouts are so much worse than seeing or hearing shit,” he said shakily.  “I blink and I’m somewhere else. Just last night, I was listening to music, just trying to drown out the damned buzzing. Next thing I know, I’m on the bus. No phone, no earbuds, no music. Just a headache and that freakin’ sound!” He looked at me for a moment, his desperate, bloodshot eyes searching for an answer in mine. He put his head in his hands. I let the moment breathe before I realized he was sobbing.

I pushed myself up and out of my chair, closing the distance between us. As I reached out to touch him on the shoulder, everything went dead silent. No static, no cars outside, not even the soft music from the lobby. It made me stop in my tracks, with my hand inches from my client.

It felt like time was stretched for a moment before hurtling forward. My stomach jolted into my throat as the taste of iron flooded my mouth. My sight seemed to fracture like glass. The hand I had stretched toward my client in a moment of comfort now grasped him for balance. When my hand made contact, he looked up at me and said, “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”
	
A terrible wave of sonic harmonies filled my head, dissonant and deafening. I put my hands to my ears and my knees buckled. My client deflated into his chair, clutching his ears. The overhead lights brightened and I clamped my eyes shut. It wasn’t enough and the blinding lights seared into my eyelids, capillaries branching across my vision. 

Then everything popped. 

The screeching in my ears diminished to a soft hum. I opened my eyes. Broken glass was everywhere. The live wires in the overhead light crackled and arced as I noticed my window was blown out.

My client wasn’t moving, covered in shards of fluorescent lightbulb. As I rushed to him, blood oozed out of his eyes, ears and nose. I pressed my ear to his chest, listening for a heart beat or breath sounds, but I couldn’t tell over the pounding in my head. 

The hair on my forehead swayed, pushed by a slight breeze. I waited a moment, holding my breath. It happened again. He was breathing. 

Murmurs filled the hallway as I rushed to my desk phone. It was dead; no dial tone.
 
“Hey, is everyone okay? We had a power surge.” I felt panic rising in my chest as I realized this incident wasn’t isolated.

“Call an ambulance,” I shouted, opening the door. “I don’t know what happened. H–he had a seizure, I think. He’s bleeding, he needs a hospital!” My mind was racing as I thought up a frantic excuse for why I had an unconscious, bloody client in my chair.

Chapter 4

I was in the back of the ambulance, the paramedics’ questions were muffled by layers of static and high pitched ringing in my ears. Even if I could hear, I wouldn’t have been able to answer. 

Fragments of memory swirled in my head. The lake of shadow, the tendrils of light,Taylor’s bloodied face. I couldn’t tell where last night ended and this morning began. The ambulance screamed to a stop and they rolled Taylor’s gurney past me.

The lights overhead dimmed. The static quieted. For a moment I thought I’d slipped away, out of myself. Energy crackled and hummed around me. I closed my eyes.

When I opened them I was in a hospital room sitting in a too warm chair that stuck to my skin. I heard the same buzz of fluorescent lights as the ambulance. The sterile white of the overhead bulbs seemed to breathe, dimming and brightening with a sickening regularity. There were no paramedics. Just Taylor.

“You made it,” he said, laying in the bed, eyes closed.

The air was oddly still. It was the most stifling hospital room I’d ever been in, it had to be 100° Farenheit. I dabbed my forehead with a sleeve before asking, “Did I black out? I was just—” I stopped, unsure of how to explain what just happened.

“Traveling,” he finished for me.

“How am I here?”

My words echoed in the room, which was devoid of sound other than the buzzing in my head. I realized there was no beeping of machines or voices in the hallway.

He shrugged, straightening himself in the bed. “Do you feel that? That prickle on your skin? I think it’s electric.”

The lights in the room flickered but stayed on. The air felt charged, like static building before a lightning strike. Goosebumps raised on my arms as I noticed a faint glow around Taylor, outlining him.

“Why is this happening? Why did you come to me?” 

“I’ve been thinking about that. I think something’s running this place.”

“What place? The hospital?”

“No. Where we’ve been, where we go when we travel.”

The buzzing in the air seemed to growl at his musings. “I don’t think it likes when we talk about it.”

The lights flared and his eyes glowed an electric blue. He went stiff in his hospital bed. Over his cries and pained groaning, the buzzing in the room rose until I could feel it clattering in my teeth. His outline began to blur, threads of white crawling from his skin, branching like a crown of thorns.

I reached for him and the moment my hand touched his shoulder, the room went black and was now lit only by the beams of light wrapping around him. I felt all the muscles in my forearm contract painfully.
I tried to tear myself from him, but it was as though our skin had been welded together. His flesh began to blacken and blister where the light had touched him. I could feel the heat as the smell of seared meat assaulted my nose. 

As each electric bolt was searching for somewhere to land, the light became blinding. I could see his bones glowing beneath his skin, red as blood. They were quickly consumed along with the rest of his body. He was mouthing something to me, but I heard nothing. I thought I could make out the words, “Don't,” and “take me,” before he dissolved into a diffuse light that blanketed the room.

My hand was grasping at the air above his bed. The only evidence that Taylor had been there was a dent in the sheets.

Tears streamed down my face as I curled up in the hospital bed where he had lain. The mattress was freezing, but I didn’t care. I was too overwhelmed. 
The world blurred around me as I felt a pang of motion sickness. I shut my eyes and heard shouting. It was like I had cotton in my ears. A constant beeping bounced around my skull. 

Blinking at the overhead lights, I realized I was being wheeled through a hallway with medical staff surrounding me. The beating of my pulse behind my eyes created a pressure so strong that I clamped them shut.

The voices of doctors and nurses flitted through my delirium between bouts of beeping and buzzing. I caught snippets of conversation, but I still couldn't determine how or why I had come to be here.

The poke and burn of a needle in my forearm caused a numbness that radiated through my whole body.

Chapter 5

I awoke from a dreamless sleep. My eyelids tore through a layer of crust that had built up in the crack. Above me, the ceiling had a panel, an artistic rendition of a skylight with soft rays of sun filtering through the leaves of a tree. The rest of the room was dark; no light shone through the window to my right. 

The lights flicked on as I moved in my hospital bed, gripping the rails as I adjusted to a seated position. Static, once again, filled my ears. It was like the din of a cathode ray tube slowly crackling and decaying into silence. But the sound continued, echoing through the deepest reaches of my mind, bouncing off the inside of my skull indefinitely. It wasn’t just a feeling anymore. It was something more tangible.  I could reach into the darkness and grab a hold of it before it slithered through my fingers.

Something I’ve told my clients popped into my head. It can feel like hell isn't really a place. It can be a state of being. It doesn't have to come after death. It can exist right here on earth, living like a parasite on the backs of the less fortunate. I know it's a cliche, but clients find it to be a meaningful metaphor. 

I never used to really believe that line. People can be tortured, live through awful things, but could it really be like hell? I believed in people, in the human spirit, in living right here, right now, and pushing through; defeating our demons.

The stillness of my dark revelry caused the motion activated light in my room to dim. I sat listening to the static.

It was muffled, like it was coming from behind the door. I looked towards it and noticed a whiteboard on the wall with my personal information on it and a small bag with the hospital's logo. I eased up to the edge of the bed and placed my bare feet on the cold tiled floor. A chill ran up my exposed back as I left the warmth of the bed behind. I needed to find where the sound was coming from.

I stripped out of my hospital gown and dug through the bag, finding my clothes and belongings. The fob for my car key seemed to be melted, the plastic warping and dripping like hardened candle wax. I didn't have time to question it, so I quickly shoved them in my pocket, pulled on my shoes and entered the hallway.

It was louder out here. As I began moving in the direction of the buzzing, the lights overhead came on and flicked off as I passed them. It seemed too dark for a hospital. Each clunk of the motion activated lights turning on seemed to make the buzzing louder. I passed room after room. Each of their doors were open, but no patients were inside. There weren't even any nurses at the station when I passed their desk.

As I got closer and closer to the source of my affliction, the sound became more and more like a feedback loop; like I was a microphone heading towards a speaker.

The compulsion to find it was overpowering. My head started pounding and my gut tied itself into knots. I felt like a fly heading towards a bugzapper. 

The hallway curved sharply and I cautiously slowed, not sure what to expect around the bend. As I crept closer, the sound began to undulate; it was breathing again. Light seeped into the hall, getting brighter as I made my way to the end of the curve.

I stopped in my tracks. Ahead of me stood a group of people, bathed in a pulsing, crackling light that poured from an open doorway. There were dozens, maybe the whole floor of the hospital. They were gathered outside one room. 

The blood drained from my cheeks as I moved forward and began pushing my way through a crowd of hospital gowns, scrubs, and white coats. Their mouths were slack, eyes wide open, unblinking and bloodshot. They were all staring straight into the room, catatonic. They took no notice of my presence. Their breath on my neck and their pallid flesh touching my skin sent shivers through me. I looked ahead, yet was no closer to my objective. I pushed onward but the hall seemed to stretch, sending the door further out of reach.

I could no longer claw the bodies apart. The crowd was packed too tightly. I tried to breathe, but each exhale became more shallow than the last. I closed my eyes as my ribs folded in on themselves; the mass of bodies collapsing my lungs. The buzzing was gone.

Chapter 6

I opened my eyes. A dark void lay before me, floor rippling beneath my feet with sparks of light. I was back. I glanced around, trying to get my bearings. Behind me, a pillar of light rose from the darkness. I turned to face it.

“The bugzapper,” I thought morbidly, not daring to take a breath. 

I felt myself glide across the floor, motes of light kicking up from under my heels. I gained speed before coming to a jarring halt at the source of light.

It took the shape of a man. Tendrils rooted themselves in the ground and slowly entwined to form legs, girdling around to form a torso, and bulged until a head took shape. This rudimentary, human form made of snaking energy tilted its head in confusion. 

The words, “Why are you here?” rang not in my ears: it vibrated in my bones.

My pulse quickened as I recognized the voice. Taylor.
The figure reached towards me, grasping my arm. The smell of ozone and seared flesh filled the air as blistering heat wrapped itself around my wrist and raced towards my shoulder. 
I tried to wrench my arm free, but the figure just pulled me in closer. A shrill screech filled my ears as bolts of electricity jumped from its eyes to mine.
The arcing lights stretched across my body as my flesh bubbled and cracked. Light seeped through and exploded from every pore. Blinded, deafened, and crippled with pain, I closed my eyes and fell backwards, away from the figure's embrace.

I hit something soft. What had been a deafening scream was instantly replaced with crystal clear music. The overwhelming pain had evaporated. I opened my eyes.

I was in the back seat of a car swerving listlessly between lanes on the highway. The clock on the radio read 4:38 PM. 

I hated this . . . travelling, as Taylor called it.

My eyes flicked to the rearview mirror and met the gaze of the bleary eyed man hunched over the steering wheel. I didn't know why I was there or where he was taking me.

“Hello?” My shaking voice came out barely above a whisper.

The driver must not have noticed me before this. His eyes went wide before he shouted, “What the fuck?!”

He jerked the wheel hard out of confusion and surprise. The car skidded and rolled, sending old beer cans flying. My head snapped in all directions before the car came to an abrupt, whiplash inducing halt as the passenger side wrapped itself around a power pole. 

Both of the driver’s side doors hung open from the damage inflicted by the crash. I quickly unbuckled myself and stumbled a short distance from the car before falling to the ground. Aside from some scratches and a sore neck, I was unharmed. I sat in the grass, trying to figure out why I was in this stranger's car.

It took great effort to bring myself to a standing position. I surveyed the wreck and was struck by the driver's familiar face. I knew that gash on his forehead. It had been a recently healed scar, but now it leaked fresh blood. I looked closer, and beneath the drunken, ruddy, swollen and bruised exterior, it was Taylor. 

I backed away as I heard the sound of a deep electric hum coming from above as the pole began cracking. It leaned over the car, stretching the power lines. I held my breath, waiting for the inevitable.

The pole came down directly on top of his car and the impact sent him sprawling through the open door. 
The snapping and whipping of the power lines brought me out of my stupor. I watched as they snaked and thrashed their way towards him. I brought my hand to my mouth, biting my knuckles to keep from shouting as I watched his body seize and convulse from the raw energy flowing through the cables.

I couldn't watch him die, not after last time. His silent words of, ""don't take me,” echoed in my mind as I sprinted back towards the wreckage. I grabbed him by the ankles once the power line had slithered out of reach and dragged him as far as my legs would allow before I collapsed. 

A woman came running towards us from the other side of the road.

“Call 911,” I shouted. 

I put my fingers to Taylor’s neck. I searched for a moment but couldn't find a pulse. All of this was because of him. I needed to know why we were here. Tears were streaming down my face as I desperately took both of my fists and pounded them on his chest. 
I beat him, hand over fist. I was angry, confused. He couldn't just die and leave me stranded. Not after upending my life.

With one final blow to his chest, the word “NO!” tore its way out of my throat, raw and guttural.

Taylor gasped. He was alive. But it all felt too familiar.
Panic surged through me, my mind snapping back to our first session. A terrible realization clawed its way to the surface as I shouted to the lady on the phone with EMS:

1qmywyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverProtests/comments/1qmywyn/i_demonstrated_at_the_game/,I demonstrated at the game,"TL;DR: I went alone, met nobody, and it was a powerful and mostly good experience. Without shouting or even speaking a word, I conveyed a powerful message to thousands of football fans and was somewhat heartened by the overall response. Long version below…

After the second execution-style murder of nonviolent protester in MPLS, I stewed in desperate juice for a bit. But they say that if you ever wonder/fantasize about how you’d have responded to the rise of the nazis in germany, just look at what you’re doing now. After all, they are disappearing/killing people right now. So wtf am I doing about it?

Yesterday I wrote letters to my Congressperson and Senators. A start. And I read about possible protests. Going to the capitol (again) felt less than adequate. We all get together there and agree w each other, shout slogans, march. It feels good, but I doubt it changes anyone’s mind. I’m in no way against any of it, but I wanted more. 

So I woke up this morning, drank my coffee, and made a sign:

MPLS today, Denver tomorrow

Killer ICE

Off Our Streets!

I popped it into a backpack with a string for my neck, dressed for the cold, and hopped on my bike. I went to Mile High stadium, arriving at about noon. I went alone. I met with nobody. I spoke to almost nobody. And yet, I think it’s the most meaningful protest I’ve ever done. 

What I actually did:

I posted up on west side of the pedestrian bridge over the river, just past the bike path and trolley tracks. Just stood in the gravel right at the edge of the walkway. Literally thousands of people walked past me and read my sign. After an hour, when folks were in the stadium and the game was about to start (I was getting pretty cold by now), I pedaled home. 

Why I did it this way:

I am not much of a joiner. I find over-arching ideology problematic. Call/response slogans are cringey to me. I simply wanted to confront a potentially non-sympathetic group of people with a simple, powerful message. I didn’t want to get into arguments. Just see me, read my sign, make of it what you will. Go enjoy the game. So I did stand there, completely alone, silently, with the sign around my neck. And I just watched the people walking past me as they read it. 

What I observed:

I was not *afraid* per se, but concerned that this is a hostile audience. I am not an aggressive or confrontational person. Would I be ridiculed, harassed, perhaps even assaulted? I didn’t think it could be that bad, but I did have to overcome some reluctance on this point. I’m glad I did. As I mentioned, *literally thousands* of football fans read my sign. Behind the safety of sunglasses, I stared right at people as they walked past me. Oh yes, they were reading it. Most folks kept walking, with little to no reaction. Exactly 3 people made hostile comments, nothing threatening. Just responding. I assume there were many, many more who disagree with me but said nothing. On the other hand, I observed hundreds of heads-nodding-in-agreement. I got probably 100 fist bumps. Several folks thanked me for being there. I saw one woman’s face contort into tears as she read my sign and kept walking. It was encouraging to get positive feedback from the football fans. 

Perhaps most powerfully, I saw many folks read it and then there would be a troubled look on their face. They didn’t look at me nod or give me a pound; instead, I saw a furrowed brow and a glance to the ground. They were thinking about my message and it bothered them. They were in a small way disturbed. There were *many* of these reactions. I hope that some of them will go home tonight with a new thought, a tweaked perspective. 

For people who want to confront, but without a threat of conflict, this seems a good demonstration strategy. It was a little uncomfortable, but I was safe. There were other protesters and cops right there. I kept away from all of them, preferring to stand alone with my sign. I would recommend this demonstration to anyone who feels safe doing it (I do recognize my privileges and don’t judge anyone who feels unsafe doing any of this).",156,1769383012.0,DenverProtests,10,0.95,False

1qmyw8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Patagonia/comments/1qmyw8a/my_experience_in_calafate_and_chaltén/,My experience in Calafate and Chaltén,"Hi everyone.

I'm returning from El Calafate and El Chaltén, and I wanted to share my experiences regarding equipment rental, campsites, hostels, and car rental.


Camping Lago Roca in El Calafate has a very good structure, with individual water and power points, and a sensational view of Lake Roca. I even touched an iceberg on the edge of the lake. It's close to the Cerro de Los Cristales trek (I did it and it's very good). The only downside is the 40km gravel road. The price per night is 20,000 pesos per person. There is a restaurant on site and a kitchen to use.


Still in El Calafate, I used the Hostel Del Glaciar Pioneros, which has a medium to low-quality structure. There were many nice people of various nationalities, but the rooms were a bit old and run-down. The kitchen had some pots and pans that were awful, but the price makes up for it for a low-cost trip. Breakfast is limited, just bread, coffee, and juice.


In El Chaltén, Camping Lago Desierto is poor to bad. They charge 30,000 pesos (with access to the Huemul Glacier) for you to be left out in the open. The bathrooms are horrible and disgusting, there was a lot of stench, little and cold water. There was no support. There were a lot of horseflies (horse wasps) and I didn't like it, it was a disturbing night.


Still in Chaltén, I went to Hostel Rancho Grande, and wow, it was sensational! They have a good to high-quality structure, the kitchen is organized with new and clean materials, the rooms are very well-structured, the bathrooms are clean and organized, there were many people but it wasn't overcrowded, and at breakfast you have 3 excellent food options to choose from. And note that after checkout you still have access to the bathrooms and the kitchen, and you can leave your bags stored at no cost.


In El Calafate I rented equipment at La Barraca, two sleeping bags rated to -12°C and two thermal insulators and a butane gas cylinder, it cost me 104,000 pesos for 4 days. Although a bit expensive, the equipment is good.

In El Chaltén, I needed to buy a camping stove at the Camping Center. The service was kind of lazy, as if they didn't want to sell. They gave me a different price than the website, looked at it and reviewed the price, and still gave me a higher price. What was supposed to be 125,000 pesos ended up being 137,000 (I was stupid to buy there because it was cheaper at Viento Oeste).


I rented a car in El Calafate from ""Like Rent a Car"" for 5 days. It cost me 475,000 pesos in cash, what they call ""efectivo"". There were no surprises. I only needed to fill up with gas to return the car, and I drove from Perito Moreno, Lago Roca, Cerro Frias, El Chaltén to Lago Desierto and other small roads. The car I rented was a Toyota Etios. The rental company was very friendly and attentive.
Otherwise, I was only surprised by the price of food. I've been to Argentina in recent years, but it seems there's been a huge increase in food prices.",11,1769382965.0,Patagonia,0,1.0,False

1qmyu3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qmyu3e/teacher_attachment_from_decades_ago_non_seual/,Teacher attachment from decades ago (non se*ual),"Re: teacher attachment. Before anyone asks, yes,  I have a therapist. Tl;dr is at the end. Before you ask why I still have such old emails,  I only delete spam.  I pretty much have all ""real"" emails saved in my yahoo since like,  1999.

Please keep the time frames in mind when reading this. 
For reference, I'm 39 now. I graduated high school in 04. I had a teacher in high school who taught me freshman English (2000-2001). She was only 28 or so as my teacher that year. She later went on to become the librarian for the school my junior/ senior year. 

I had an eating disorder through this time.  I did talk with her about this very often, as well as things going on in my family.  The family issues weren't anything serious enough to rise to the level of mandated reporting, btw. I was not in traditional therapy even though my mom knew about the ED. The teacher did ensure that the school nurse/psych/ social workers etc were apprised, although they were really unhelpful and uninformed because,  well, it was 2001.
My eating disorder (bulimia)  started mid freshman year but didn't get ""bad"" until Junior/ senior. She made herself very available to me to talk to her. She was the first, and to some extent still only, person to really listen and care. She was there through everything. Now, she was my teacher formally in 00-01. Then she took some tech jobs within the district for the rest of 01-early 03, iirc. During this time period, she wasnt necessarily at the high school everyday,  but would let be know when she would be at the HS. 
She would stay after school to talk to me and then drive me home, even during this time period. (Now I realize she was kind of overstepping and she wasn't a therapist blah blah) but at the time,  I was so glad to have someone to talk to. When I would tell her about some family problems,  she'd relate and talk about issues she had with her father,  how he hurt and left the family, her worries and fears as a teen etc. I do now realize that this crossed some boundaries but it also built a lot of rapport. She did also discuss issues she'd had with her self esteem and how she worked on it and did heavily imply she also may have had an ED, but never explicitly stated this. 
Regarding the talking after school /drives home,  etc., no one really raised alarm bells - remember the time frame here is 2001-2004 ish. No cell phone / texting, either really.  This was before cell phones were ubiquitous and before people really texted. 

She would also email with me about regular things - through summers as well. I was the one to initiate emails.  She had put her personal email on the syllabus, which I used as primary,  but there was a school email.  But again,  keep the time frame in mind - kids weren't really emailing their teachers and teachers weren't really replying from their school emails because they could only access it while at school.  
I did have other teachers who put their home phone numbers on syllabi and we could call for homework help,  and my friends and I sometimes did.

In 03-04, my senior year,  she was the HS librarian. I realized about a quarter way through the year that I was going to be half a credit short of graduating, something the guidance counselor had never caught despite me being a 3.8 ish /AP student. The counselor offered to have me walk at graduation but then take a summer school class.  Some students did ""independent studies"" with teachers, so I asked her if I could do one in the library.  She wrote up a course proposal for me,  it got approved,  and I got to do that for me 1/2 credit.  That saved me and I graduated.  

We kept in touch for a few years after... Till about 2011/12 on and off. I did,  at some point,  start texting - maybe around 06/07 in college or so.  She would reply to the texts. We developed some rapport here,  too. The texts I remember were about normal things - I remember one about shopping for kitchenware, and wishing each other a happy X holiday on each holiday.  One that stands out was around '08 or 09, maybe where she said she was going to be in town going out with other teacher/ co workers. She mentioned she was getting a divorce but not to tell anyone ""because no one in (town)  knows."" That struck me as odd because I was out of HS 4 years by then and wasn't like I kept in touch with the other staff.  

Anyway,  he would often reference getting together via email and text and ask me dates or where I would like to meet up... But never follow up. One time we had a loose ""plan"" that I would call when I got out of work and I called at the date/ time a TON but she never responded. 

Another incident was in 08, I was on vacation with a family friend.  She called me - we had never spoken on the phone before - but I ignored the call and sent a text saying I would call back when the movie was done. I called back as I said but her phone was off (straight to VM). She had left me a VM that had a really sad tone of voice and was to the effect of ""hey,  it's me.  (Something about just checking up), I know what it is you're going through,  I've been there. Whatever it is you need,  I'm here.  Okay?  Alright. Bye.""
Note that we did communicate a few times via email after and this incident wasnt discussed again.  

The last email I have is from 2011 and there's no reference to not wanting to keep in touch anymore. None of the texts indicated that she wanted no more contact,  either.  

Since then, through some healthy internet stalking, I found she changed jobs a couple times and was most recently working at a middle school a town over and was re- married.  
I found her Instagram and LinkedIn and attempted to add her on both, but she seems to have blocked it. She straight up blocked my Twitter account from the old high school library's Twitter account that she ran which I found a bit odd.

In 2020, (below is written in journal format).
I was looking at who viewed my LinkedIn because I was searching for a new job and a few co workers told me a certain recruiter was looking at their LinkedIn, so I went to see if he had looked at mine. SHE had looked at mine recently! 

I drafted and sent an email.  I know,  I'm crazy to still care after all these years.  BUT I KNOW SHE READ IT first because I put tracking on it but because SHE HAD LOOKED AT MY LINKEDIN. 

2021 update. (Also in journal format)  
I got a new dog that I take to a dog park nearby. A former staff member at my old high school also takes her dog there, it turns out. This former staff member was BEST FRIENDS with this teacher (over each other houses,  cottage, boat, day trips etc).  Since I spent so much time with this teacher in high school, this staff member associates me with her and almost immediately said to me ""you know who I still get a Christmas card from every year?"" 😂. Then this staff member asked to take a picture with me and send it to her and I was like ""actually you probably shouldn't send that bc I don't think she wants to hear from me."" I don't know if she sent it. 
She did, however, proceed to tell me that this teacher/ her friend also semi cut her out a bit and she was really sad about it.  This teacher lived one mile from staff member for 2 years and didn't tell her, etc. Teacher has obviously cut her out less than me because they still exchange cards and text but it does support a ""it isn't me,  it's her"" narrative. 

Fast forward to 2023, last email was still 2011, last texting was maybe 2012. I never stopped longing for contact - either to reconnect or for closure where I could properly thank her for everything.
I had deleted her number from my phone by this time,  however, I was looking through my WhatsApp and I saw her contact info there,  probably because it was initially saved into my Google cloud/drive and not just my phone.  I decided to send a long text thanking her and hoping to get back in touch.  I hoped to connect as adults and even return the favor of ""being there"" if ever needed. I knew she was reading the messages due to the double blue checkmarks appearing. I sent a few over a couple weeks,  basically just thanking her and asking to maybe get coffee.  Then,  she sent back a message in a tone that was very cold and dismissive compared to previously. Compared to everything I remembered. Then she blocked me on WhatsApp. This was 2023 but I've thought of her often since.  In early 2024, I saw that her mother had passed via an online obituary. I didn't reach out,  respecting her boundary, but realized that the timing of the WhatsApp was near the final few months of her mother's life (ofc I didn't know that at the time). 

This past week, I saw an obituary of her (new) husband and I'm just absolutely gutted for her.  I'm not reaching out (I don't even know if I could if I wanted - I'm blocked). Although I don't know the full details of her social life,  it doesn't seem like she has much support locally,  particularly now with her mother and husband passed away.  Per the timing in the obituary, she would've also been dealing with him getting a recent cancer diagnosis while her mom was passing / timing of WhatsApp message. 

I just feel so much empathy and would love to be able to provide her any kind of help (food, etc) as a way to ""give back.""  I just can't put into words how much of a ""kindred spirit"" connection I felt and she was just such an important person at such a hard time.  
I know that I shouldn't reach out based on the boundary she set and, again,  I'm blocked anyway.  

I don't know the point of this post,  but I'm just having a hard time processing the news.  And I feel insane for still feeling this way all these years later.  I guess I'm just looking for thoughts? 

I would like to share below some emails she wrote over the years and then the final WhatsApp message for a ""feel"" of the situation. 

****Emails: I had emailed like,  sorry if I did something and you're mad at me because I had not heard back.
Dec, 2007
Oh, (my name) . Why in the world would I ever, ever be mad at you. I believe you have the desire and ability to get your life exactly where you, and not somebodv else, want it. You are a verv determined young woman so there is no doubt in my mind you can think better about who vou are, what you are capable of, and where you want to go. I can't say that about many people but I can say it about you,
Life has been a little crazy for me this year, in more wavs than one. Somedav I'll get into it. This email would be wav too long. If anything, I can tell vou that life is a constant battle so it's important to enioy the good times and do your best with the bad ones There is no such thing as perfect but being happy with yourself is pretty invaluable. I've struggled in ways just like you. Keep me posted on how things progress. I'm glad you are getting help. Your life is too important and vou have to much to give and offer.
I'|| be in touch. Merry Christmas to you, too. I'd like you to come see (new school)  when it's done. (Other teacher)  would love to say hi, too
Take care of you.

April 2008 - I had emailed about graduating college, having been selected for a presentation,  and getting out of ED treatment. 
I am so proud of you. I hope you are as proud of yourself.
This has been nothing short of an uphill climb on rock with barefeet, no?
I would love to read a copy of your paper. In fact, I'd be willing to help you do any editing you require at the last minute. Let me know if you are presenting; l'd love to come see you.
You have learned, through all your family trials and tribulations, that life is only what you make it. Count on you and do right by you. know you feel as though you could become the person you were in high school and early college, but I think you've learned and have the power to beat this, (my name). It will always be part of you... just like drug addiction or alcoholism. It's a monster; knowing how and when it will appear is the key.
Text me on (school issued cell number) as my old phone can't take texts until I replace it. That's my work # anyhow.
Let me know what your grad plans are and what you'll be doing in May. 'Id like to send you something but need an address.
It's hard to believe it's been four years already. Time flies, doesn't it? I remember reading Lord of the Flies and grading your English paper. 
You are a wonderful student and friend. I imagine great things for you. Always believe in yourself... for you are the only one who will get you where you want to be.
Keep me posted. I look forward to hearing from you!

Hi,
In light of the fact that I am just reading this and it is late, I'm going to be brief with the promise that I'll return / rewrite tomorrow. I hope that's okay.
My life has been a nothing short of the worst roller coaster I've ever ridden since May of 2008. In truth, things (marriage, etc.) have been bad since 2003, but I stuck it out. Even though I always knew it would end, I still wasn't prepared for all I had to go through. It's brutal and unfair. I lost everything. With a new job (for less money) and a new life and place to live on my own and by myself for the first time ever, it has been a dlaily uphill battle to keep my chin up. I think in many ways you can relate. While I'm not one to admit defeat, this has been tough. Still, I have faith and believe in myself. If anyone can pull it off, I can. Things are getting better, but it has taken some time and it's the reason I haven't kept in touch with anyone. What is positive to talk about when things seem so gloomy?
I'm not avoiding you in any way. I just don't know which wav the pendulum has been swinging on a daily basis. It's been tough to commit to anything or anyone until mos recentlv. That said, I would like to get together and fortunately we've managed to stay in touch. You are much better at that than I am. Weekends are the best for me.
I am thrilled that things are shaping up for you. You've made me worry over the vears but I knew you had it in you to persevere. You are very motivated, so I expect good things from you. Give me some weekend dates to choose from. It will be good to see you.

For all you have been through, as a young and now mature adult. I would never for once have doubted your capacity for greatness, (my name). While you struggled and endured a troubled life, I always knew there was something inside you that would rally. We are woven of similar threads; we are both tough individuals. Expecting greatness from others means nothing unless we have asked of ourselves the very same thing.
It means little for me to say that I am proud of you; it means much more that you are proud of yourself. You have every right to be. Doesn't it feel good to be there for those who need guidance?
You have grown, from what I can tell, into a proud, accomplished, talented voung woman. I am proud I had the opportunity to teach you. I am here always, I promise
Believe in you, who you are, and what you stand for. I'll do the same. There aren't enough people like you in this world at present.
You are the best. Period. The end. 
Cheers,

Sept 2023 WhatsApp message
(My name),

I wish you well and hope you are happy. We only come this way one time. 

My life is private, and that is how I choose it to be. Please respect that and don't interfere. 

I trust you understand what I am asking. 

I wish you the best.

..................
Tl;dr
I'm almost 40/F. I had a really close, non-romantic bond with a female high school teacher (grad '04) who was a major source of support during a dark time in my life. She felt like the one person who saw me and made me feel safe, and I think she saw a younger version of herself in me.
After I graduated, we kept in touch and the messages were all warm and no indication of wanting to end contact until she just started blocking me on stuff. Our last significant contact was probably 2012. 
Her final message (2023) was distant and cold. She didn’t want any more contact. I’ve respected that, but it’s been painful.
I still think about her and I often feel this desire to reach out - not to rekindle anything, but to give back to someone who meant so much to me.
Now that I've seen recent obituaries of both her mother and husband, I’m gutted for her. I don’t want to disrespect her boundary, but I wonder if there’s ever a moment when it’s okay to reach out with compassion. I’m grieving someone who’s still alive, and it’s complicated. I likely won't reach out but I'm gutted for her and also,  for myself,  wish I could ""repay"" in some way.
