At first we hung out once a week at the coffee shop for a while, then about a year after we met we added a once a month friend date. She is married but her husband isn't very sociable. For my birthday she bought flowers and a necklace. Her husband and her had a big fight in November and he moved into another room.

I had surgery and got anxious after because it felt like she was pulling away, but in January she came to my house and we cooked dinner and talked for hours. She had suggested, also, that we get permanent jewelry for Galentine's day. Then, a week and a half later, she snapped at me about telling her to reach out when she was hurting. A week later she said she wanted a break and low contact. I lasted 12 days. Then I texted her a meme, which she had said was okay to do. We texted back and forth a couple of times and then I left for work. Four hours later she texted and said, this friendship isn't for me and (basically) I wish you all the best.

I graduated high school 2005. I joined the Marines 8 days after my high school diploma. at the end of 2006 I was deployed to Iraq. During my senior year of high school I fell in love with a girl. we started dating. when I joined the Marines she told me she still was sure about us, I told her that I understood if she wanted to part ways but she assured me she would stay with me so I left for Iraq knowing she was still with me. 3 months into my deployment she simply sent me an email telling me she couldn't deal with that situation anymore. I still had several months ahead. I was infantry. I would kick doors down. She left me like a pile of trash not caring I was at war. I was injuried in 2007 in combat. she didn't even call me. Fast forward about 20 years and few weeks  ago I saw her after all this time at our local mall, I couldn't belive it was her (she had moved out of our state about 20 yrs ago) and she says she's thinking about coming back living to our state. She was so friendly. I wasn't rude or anything but part of me didn't forgive her. and I haven't forgotten she left me while I was at war. So when she asked if we could get a coffee once I said 'ok,one of these days' implying I wasn't interested. Now she actually asked me if next friday we could meet. I still haven't answered. I was thinking of going without bringing back the past but I just can't. I am still angry at her. I never got closure. I wonder why she'd contact me after all these years.

1j0n5hl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1j0n5hl/i_survived_gods_test/,I survived God‚Äôs test,"I sat in the dim light of my apartment, staring blankly at the mess around me. Dishes piled high, clothes I hadn't bothered to pick up in weeks, and newspapers cluttered the floor like a layer of dust on my past. Everything about this place felt dead, as lifeless as I felt inside. It's been ten years since my parents died, but some days, it feels like it was just yesterday. Other days, like tonight, it feels like they've been gone forever. I stopped believing in anything after they passed. Faith, hope, God‚Äînone of it meant anything to me anymore.

But old habits die hard. I found myself sitting on the edge of my bed, hands clasped together like I used to when I was a kid, reciting half-remembered prayers. My words were hollow, slipping from my lips without meaning. I didn't believe anyone was listening. Why would they? I hadn't been to church in years and hadn't even thought about God in any real sense since I watched them lower my parents into the ground. But here I was, whispering prayers into the void, feeling stupid for even going through the motions.

The silence in the room felt suffocating. I let out a heavy sigh and ran my hands through my hair, pushing it back as I leaned forward, elbows resting on my knees. What was the point of all this? Every day felt like it bled into the next, an endless loop of nothingness. My friends had long since drifted away, and I couldn't blame them. I barely left the apartment anymore. Maybe they got tired of trying to pull me out of this pit when all I did was pull them in with me.

It was in the middle of that silence, that heavy, crushing stillness, that I heard it.

At first, I thought it was just my imagination‚Äîa voice, soft but clear, cutting through the haze in my mind. I sat up straighter, my heart pounding for reasons I couldn't explain.

""Jude,"" the voice said, smooth and comforting. ""Jude, I've been watching you.""

I froze, my mind racing. Was I hearing things? The voice was calm, almost soothing like it was speaking directly into my thoughts.

""Who...?"" I whispered, my voice cracking from disuse. My heart thudded against my ribs, the pulse-quickening as the voice continued.

""I am God,"" it said simply as if that explained everything. ""And I have chosen you.""

A cold shiver ran down my spine. God? That's ridiculous. I hadn't believed in God in a long time. But there was something about the way the voice spoke, something that made my skin prickle with fear and... a strange sense of comfort.

""You feel lost,"" it continued, as if reading my thoughts. ""You've drifted far from your path. But I am here now. I want to help you find your way again.""

I didn't respond. What could I say to that? My brain told me this was crazy, that I was losing my mind. But there was a part of me, the part that had been drowning in loneliness and despair, that wanted to believe it was real. I wanted to believe that someone‚Äîsomething‚Äîhad come to save me from myself.

I sat there for what felt like forever, staring into the darkened corners of my apartment, waiting for something else to happen. My heart was still racing, but my body felt frozen as if I couldn't move even if I wanted to. The voice‚Äîthat voice‚Äîkept echoing in my mind. ""I am God."" It was absurd, wasn't it? I wasn't some religious zealot or a man of faith anymore. But what else could it be? It wasn't like I'd had visitors recently, and it didn't sound like the kind of voice that came from a mind cracking under pressure. It was too...calm.

""I know you're afraid,"" the voice spoke again, softer this time, almost gentle. ""But there's nothing to fear. I've come to help you, Jude.""

I swallowed hard, feeling the dryness in my throat. ""Help me?"" My voice came out quieter than I intended. I didn't want to sound desperate, but I knew I did. I felt desperate.

""Yes,"" the voice replied, as steady and comforting as before. ""You've suffered long enough. I can see the weight you carry, the burden of your loss. Let me lift it for you. All I ask is to walk with you, to live through you, and to experience what it is to be human.""

Something about the way it said that last part made my skin crawl, but I brushed it off. I wasn't in the position to question help, no matter how strange it seemed. Living through me? Experiencing humanity? That didn't sound so bad, did it? The Catholic teachings from my childhood floated to the surface of my mind‚ÄîGod moving through us, guiding our actions, helping us be better. Maybe that's what this was.

I felt a flicker of something I hadn't felt in years. Hope. If this was real‚Äîif it wasn't some kind of delusion‚Äîmaybe this was my chance. My chance to make sense of everything that had happened, of everything I'd lost.

""What do you want from me?"" I asked, my voice a little stronger now.

""Only what you've already been willing to give,"" the voice said, patient. ""Your life, your experiences. I want to walk beside you, feel what you feel, and help you heal. In return, I will show you things you've never known. You'll find peace again.""

Peace. God, did I want that. The kind of peace that didn't feel like drowning in sorrow. The kind of peace that would let me sleep without waking up in the middle of the night, gasping for air with my heart pounding like I'd just been buried alive.

I hesitated for only a moment longer before nodding, though I wasn't sure who I was nodding to. ""Okay,"" I whispered. ""If you're really God, and you can do what you say... I'll let you in.""

The second the words left my mouth, I felt something‚Äîlike a cool breeze slipping inside my chest, filling the hollow space that had been there for so long. It wasn't unpleasant, but it was strange. Like I could feel the presence of something...someone else inside me.

""Thank you,"" the voice said, quieter now but still soothing. ""Together, we'll do great things.""

I exhaled, realizing I had been holding my breath. The apartment seemed quieter now, still dark and cluttered, but there was a lightness in the air that hadn't been there before. It was subtle, barely noticeable, but it was enough to make me feel...different.

I stood up, shaky at first but steadier than I'd been in weeks. Maybe months. There was a new energy coursing through me, something alive and warm. It made me feel like I could take on anything. Maybe this was what faith felt like. Maybe I was finally finding my way back to something greater than myself.

""Now,"" the voice spoke again, guiding me, ""let's begin.""

The days that followed were the brightest I'd had in years. The voice, soft and steady, kept me going, encouraging me to make small changes in my life. At first, it was simple things‚Äîcleaning up the apartment, tossing out the piles of trash I'd let build up for months. It was amazing how different it felt, how much lighter the air seemed once the place wasn't suffocating under the weight of clutter. The more I cleaned, the more I felt like I could breathe again.

I started taking better care of myself, too. The voice, always calm and reassuring, nudged me to shower more often, to eat real food instead of living off frozen meals and takeout. The act of making a sandwich felt oddly fulfilling as if I was reclaiming something I'd lost. For the first time in what felt like forever, I actually looked forward to the little things. It was as if the voice had flipped a switch inside me, lighting up the parts of me I'd buried in the darkness.

""You're doing well,"" the voice would say, that comforting tone wrapping around me like a warm blanket. ""This is the first step. You're on the right path.""

And I believed it. How could I not? My life was improving slowly but surely. I wasn't just sitting in that dingy apartment, staring at the walls anymore. I was living again. The voice kept me focused, kept me grounded, and I found myself trusting it more with each passing day.

But it wasn't just about cleaning and eating better. One morning, as I sipped on a cup of coffee I'd actually brewed myself instead of grabbing from the convenience store, the voice nudged me toward something bigger.

""It's time to reconnect,"" it said as if it knew exactly what was on my mind before I even thought it. ""Your friends have been waiting for you. They miss you, Jude.""

I stared at the cup in my hands, the steam swirling up in delicate patterns. My friends. I hadn't thought about them in a while, not really. Sure, I saw them maybe five times a year, but it was always awkward like we were strangers who shared old memories but nothing else. Over the years, I'd shut them out, unwilling to burden them with my misery. Yet, the voice was right. They were still there, waiting for me. Maybe now that I had ""God"" with me, things could be different.

""They're important to your journey,"" the voice continued. ""Reach out to them. Show them you're changing, that you're healing. They'll see it, and you'll help them too.""

There it was again‚Äîthat idea of helping others. The thought didn't just sit with me, it bloomed inside my chest like a seed sprouting new life. Maybe I could help them. Maybe this wasn't just about me anymore.

That afternoon, I sent out a few simple texts to the people I'd grown distant from.¬†*Hey, it's been a while. Want to catch up sometime?*

To my surprise, they responded. Enthusiastically. Within a few days, I was sitting at a small caf√©, sipping coffee with old friends I hadn't seen in months. At first, the conversation was light and casual‚Äîwhat everyone had been up to and how work was going. But as the hours wore on, we slipped into more personal territory.

It was Tom who brought it up first. He leaned back in his chair, eyes distant as he spoke about how he'd been struggling with anxiety, how it felt like the walls were closing in on him sometimes. I listened, nodding sympathetically, but I could feel the voice stirring in my mind.

""He needs to confront his pain,"" the voice whispered, soft but insistent. ""Push him. Make him face it head-on.""

I hesitated. Tom's words were heavy, filled with uncertainty, and it didn't feel right to dig into that. But the voice... it sounded so sure, so certain that this was the way. I shifted in my seat, trying to figure out how to approach it.

""You know,"" I began carefully, ""sometimes you have to face that stuff directly. I've been going through some things myself, and what's helped me is... confronting it. Really digging deep, even when it hurts.""

Tom blinked at me, surprised. His expression shifted‚Äîwas that discomfort?‚Äîbut I pressed on, the voice urging me forward.

""Maybe you need to look at what's really causing it,"" I continued. ""Stop avoiding it. Let it hurt for a while, and then you'll come out stronger.""

He didn't respond at first, just stared into his cup. The silence felt heavy between us like the air itself had thickened. My heart started to race‚Äîhad I gone too far? Had I pushed too hard? But the voice was calm, unbothered.

""You're helping him,"" it said, soothing me. ""This is what he needs.""

Tom finally looked up, his eyes dark and stormy. ""Maybe,"" he said quietly, but there was a tension in his voice, something fragile that I couldn't quite place.

The rest of the conversation was more stilted after that. We talked a little longer, but the warmth from earlier was gone. I left the caf√© feeling uneasy as if something had shifted, but I couldn't pinpoint what it was. Still, the voice reassured me, telling me that this was how people grew‚Äîthrough pain, through confrontation. I convinced myself that I was helping Tom, even if it didn't feel that way at the moment.

That night, as I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, the familiar pain in my back returned. This time, it was sharper and more intense than it had been before. I groaned, shifting uncomfortably as the ache spread from my shoulders down my spine.

""Relax,"" the voice said, gentle but firm. ""This is part of the process. It's how you grow.""

I clenched my teeth as the pain intensified, a burning sensation now radiating from my shoulder blades. It felt like something was pressing against my skin from the inside, trying to break free. But even as the discomfort grew, I found myself accepting it, welcoming it. The voice was right‚Äîpain was necessary. It was how we became stronger, how we grew.

As the night wore on, the pain dulled into a throbbing ache, but I didn't fight it. I let it consume me, drifting into a restless sleep with the voice whispering softly in the back of my mind.

""This is only the beginning.""

The next few days passed in a blur. My back still ached, but I pushed it to the back of my mind, focusing on the progress I was making. Things were... good. Or at least, they seemed that way. I was reaching out to friends more, keeping the apartment clean, and eating better. The voice kept guiding me, offering bits of advice that I followed without question.

But Tom had been quiet since our last meeting. At first, I chalked it up to him needing time to process what I'd said, but after days of radio silence, a small seed of doubt began to grow in my mind. Had I gone too far? Had I pushed him when he wasn't ready?

""You did the right thing,"" the voice reassured me. ""He needs time, that's all. Growth comes through pain, Jude. You'll see.""

I wanted to believe it. I needed to believe it. After all, the voice hadn't steered me wrong yet. My life was better because of it. So, I pushed my doubts aside and focused on the next step in my journey‚Äîreaching out to Mark, another old friend I hadn't seen in months.

We arranged to meet at a local bar, the kind of place we used to frequent back in the day before everything had fallen apart. When I walked in, Mark was already there, sitting at a corner table with a beer in hand. He smiled when he saw me, but there was something in his eyes‚Äîa flicker of hesitation, maybe. Or was it just my imagination?

""Jude,"" he said, standing up to greet me. ""It's been a while.""

""Yeah,"" I replied, forcing a smile as I shook his hand. ""Too long.""

We made small talk for a while, catching up on the usual things‚Äîwork, life, the weather. But the voice was there, in the back of my mind, waiting. It felt like it was biding its time, waiting for the right moment to step in.

And that moment came after Mark's second beer, when he leaned in a little closer, his voice lowering as he talked about his recent breakup.

""It's been rough,"" he admitted, his eyes downcast. ""I thought she was the one, you know? But... things fell apart. It's my fault, mostly. I guess I've just got too much baggage. She couldn't deal with it anymore.""

The voice stirred, its presence stronger now. ""He needs to face the truth, Jude,"" it whispered, insistent. ""He's hiding from himself. Make him confront it.""

I hesitated again, just like I had with Tom. But the voice's pressure was stronger this time, more urgent. It pushed me, and before I could stop myself, the words were spilling out.

""You know, maybe she left because you weren't dealing with your own problems,"" I said, my tone sharper than I'd intended. ""Maybe she saw the cracks and realized you were never going to fix them.""

Mark blinked, his expression shifting from sadness to confusion. ""What?""

""You've got to face it, Mark,"" I continued, the voice pushing me forward. ""You can't just blame it on her leaving. If you want to move on, you've got to face your own shit. Stop hiding behind the breakup like it's all on her. You're the problem, and until you deal with that, no one's ever going to stick around.""

There was a long silence after that. Mark stared at me, his face tightening, a mix of shock and anger flashing across his features. I could feel my heart racing and the blood pounding in my ears. Had I gone too far again? Had I pushed him like I had with Tom? But the voice kept whispering, reassuring me.

""This is for his own good, Jude. You're helping him grow. Pain leads to understanding.""

""I‚ÄîI didn't mean it like that,"" Mark stammered, his voice shaky. ""I... I don't know. Maybe you're right, but...""

His words trailed off, and he looked away, his jaw clenched. I knew I'd hit a nerve, but instead of feeling guilty, I felt something else‚Äîa sense of satisfaction. The voice was right. This was how people grew. By facing their pain head-on.

The rest of the night was awkward. We didn't talk much after that; we just exchanged a few strained words before Mark made an excuse to leave early. I watched him walk out of the bar, the weight of the moment pressing down on me, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I had done the right thing.

I sat there alone for a while, sipping my beer and replaying the conversation in my head. The more I thought about it, the more I convinced myself that I had helped him, just like I'd helped Tom. It didn't matter that they both seemed uncomfortable, even hurt by my words. Growth was painful. That's what the voice kept telling me, and I believed it.

As I walked home that night, the pain in my back flared up again, sharper this time. I stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, wincing as the burning sensation spread across my shoulders. It felt like something was moving beneath my skin, pushing against it, trying to break free. I stumbled, clutching at my back as the pain intensified, my breath coming in short, ragged gasps.

""Breathe, Jude,"" the voice whispered, calm and patient. ""This is part of your transformation. You're becoming something more. Embrace the pain.""

I stood there, hunched over in the cold night air, gritting my teeth as the agony ripped through me. But I didn't fight it. I couldn't. If this was what it took to fulfill my purpose, to help others grow, then I would endure it. I would let the pain shape me, just like the voice had promised.

After what felt like an eternity, the pain dulled, leaving a throbbing ache in its wake. I straightened up slowly, my body trembling, and continued walking home. By the time I reached my apartment, I was drenched in sweat, my legs barely able to carry me to my bed.

As I lay there, staring at the ceiling, the voice hummed softly in my mind, soothing me, calming me.

""You're on the right path,"" it said. ""Soon, you'll understand everything. This is just the beginning.""

I closed my eyes, my body still aching, but I felt something else now‚Äîsomething deeper. A sense of purpose. Of destiny.

Whatever was happening to me, I was ready for it.

I texted Mark again, asking if he wanted to meet up. The first few texts went unanswered, but I kept pushing. After what happened last time, I understood why he might not be too eager to see me. I told him I wanted to apologize and that I just wanted to talk things through and make things right. After a long wait, he finally agreed.

We planned to meet at my apartment this time. Something about the isolation of it felt right. The voice told me it was better this way‚Äîno distractions, no interruptions. We could really get into what was holding him back, and I could help him grow.

The day came, and Mark showed up looking uneasy, fidgeting with his jacket zipper as he stood in my doorway. I tried to smile, to put him at ease, but there was a nervous energy between us that made my skin prickle. Still, I invited him in, and he hesitantly stepped over the threshold.

The apartment was clean now, almost unrecognizable compared to the mess it had been before. Mark glanced around, visibly surprised at the change. ""You've been busy,"" he commented, his voice strained with forced casualness.

""Yeah, I've been making some changes,"" I said, keeping my tone light. ""Trying to improve, you know? Just like I want to help you do.""

Mark's eyes flickered with something‚Äîworry, maybe‚Äîbut he nodded and sat down on the couch. I could see how tense he was, the way his shoulders were hunched forward as if he was bracing himself for something.

We made small talk for a bit, just like we did at the bar last time, but I wasn't interested in the surface-level stuff anymore. The voice was there, whispering in the back of my mind, urging me forward. It was time to help Mark break through his walls.

""You've been struggling,"" I said, cutting off the light conversation. ""Since the breakup. I know you're trying to move on, but you haven't really faced the real problem, have you?""

Mark stiffened. His eyes darkened, his lips pressing together into a thin line. ""I... I don't want to get into all that again, Jude,"" he muttered. ""Not like last time.""

But the voice pushed harder, louder now, drowning out any second thoughts I might've had. ""He needs to feel it, Jude. He needs to suffer if he's ever going to grow.""

I leaned forward, my hands clasped together as I stared at him, my gaze unwavering. ""You're never going to get past this if you keep running from it,"" I said, my voice firm. ""You need to face the pain, Mark. You need to feel it, deep down, or you'll never heal.""

Mark shifted uncomfortably, his eyes darting toward the door. ""I... I don't think this is a good idea.""

Before he could move, before he could stand up to leave, the voice gave a final command. ""Show him. Make him feel it.""

My hand shot out and grabbed his arm, gripping it tightly. Mark froze, his eyes widening in shock. ""Jude, what are you doing?""

""You need to feel it,"" I repeated, my voice steady but my grip tightening. ""This is the only way. You can't keep running from the pain.""

I twisted his arm behind his back, forcing him to his knees as he yelped in pain. My heart raced, but the voice was there, soothing me, telling me this was right. This was how I was supposed to help him.

""Jude, stop!"" Mark gasped, struggling against me, but I held him firm, pushing him down harder. His body twisted under the pressure, his breath coming in ragged gasps as I forced him to the ground.

The voice was relentless now, filling my mind with its commands. ""Make him suffer. Only then will he understand.""

My free hand reached for his throat, pressing down as his eyes filled with terror. His hands clawed at my wrists, trying to pry me off, but I didn't let go. I pressed harder, feeling his pulse quicken beneath my fingers.

""This is for your own good,"" I whispered, my voice trembling with some twisted form of reassurance. ""You'll thank me for this.""

Mark's face twisted in agony, his body writhing as he struggled to breathe. His gasps turned into choked sobs, and I felt something inside me shift, something dark and violent taking root. The voice hummed in satisfaction, feeding on the pain I was inflicting.

And then, suddenly, it wasn't just Mark who was suffering. A sharp, searing pain erupted in my back, so intense that I staggered, releasing him. My hands flew to my shoulders as the pain spread, tearing through me like a wildfire. I collapsed to my knees, gasping as the burning sensation reached its peak.

Mark scrambled away, coughing and choking as he stumbled to his feet. I barely noticed him flee, my mind consumed by the agony ripping through my body. I could feel something moving beneath my skin, pushing, stretching, breaking free.

The pain became unbearable, and I screamed, my voice raw and animalistic. My shoulders were on fire, my flesh tearing as something sharp began to poke through the skin. Blood soaked through my shirt, and I ripped it off, desperate to see what was happening.

My back was a mess of torn skin and blood, but beneath the gore, I saw them‚Äîtwo jagged, bony spikes protruding from my shoulder blades. They were growing, pushing their way out of me with sickening cracks and pops, stretching upward like twisted, blood-soaked wings.

The pain was unimaginable, but through it all, I felt... elated. The voice was there, soothing me, telling me that this was my transformation, my reward for doing ""God's"" work.

""You're becoming something more,"" it whispered. ""This is your destiny. Embrace it.""

I collapsed onto the floor, my body trembling, blood pooling beneath me. My vision blurred, the edges of the room darkening as I fought to stay conscious. But even as the darkness closed in, I couldn't help but smile.

I had done it. I had helped Mark, just like I was meant to. And now, I was becoming something greater‚Äîsomething divine.

As I slipped into unconsciousness, the last thing I heard was the voice, calm and reassuring.

""You've done well, Jude. You're almost ready.""

The voice had grown louder and more demanding over the past few days. It wasn't satisfied with the small acts of pain I'd inflicted. I'd pushed Mark and Tom, I'd made them suffer, but it wasn't enough. The voice told me they were only steps on a path, a necessary part of my transformation, but there was more‚Äîsomething bigger, something I wasn't yet ready to see.

That night, the voice called to me with a new urgency.

""Now is the time, Jude,"" it whispered, its tone colder than before. ""You've prepared yourself for this moment. You must bring suffering to the world. Only then will you truly become what I need you to be.""

I didn't question it. How could I? Everything the voice had told me up to this point had been right. I had seen the changes in myself, the transformation happening before my eyes‚Äîbefore my¬†*soul*. The spikes in my back were proof that I was becoming something more than human. The pain, the agony I endured, it was all part of the process.

But this time, the voice wasn't asking for words or emotional suffering. This time, it wanted something real. Something irreversible.

""Go out tonight,"" it commanded. ""Find someone. A soul that needs to feel my presence. Bring them pain, Jude. Bring them to me.""

I didn't ask why. I didn't hesitate. I simply did as I was told.

I left my apartment without a second thought, the cool night air hitting my skin as I stepped into the darkness. The city was quieter than usual. Empty streets stretched before me, illuminated by pale streetlights casting long shadows on the pavement. I felt a strange sense of calm as I walked as if I knew exactly what I needed to do.

The voice guided me, tugging at my mind, pulling me toward the quiet alleys and backstreets. I walked for what felt like hours, my body moving on autopilot until I saw her. She was standing by herself, waiting at a bus stop. A middle-aged woman dressed in a dark coat looking down at her phone. She was alone. Vulnerable.

""This is her, Jude,"" the voice said, its presence now overpowering. ""She's the one. Her soul is ready. You must help her. Bring her pain, bring her closer to me.""

I felt my heart racing, not with fear, but with anticipation. My hands twitched as I approached her, my footsteps barely making a sound on the cracked sidewalk. She didn't notice me until I was right behind her.

""Excuse me?"" I said, my voice steady, almost friendly.

She turned around, startled. I could see the confusion on her face as she took a step back, her eyes flicking to the empty street around us. ""Can I help you?"" she asked, her voice shaking slightly.

""You need to feel this,"" I whispered, taking a step closer.

Her face contorted with fear, and she tried to back away, but I was faster. My hands reached out and grabbed her throat, squeezing tight before she could even scream. The shock in her eyes quickly turned to panic as she clawed at my arms, struggling to pull free.

""Shh,"" I whispered, tightening my grip. ""This is for you. You need to feel the pain. It's the only way to get closer to Him.""

Her gasps filled the air, her body thrashing as she tried to fight me off, but I held her down, pressing her into the ground, the cold pavement beneath us. My grip tightened even more, my fingers digging into her skin as her struggles became weaker, her eyes wide with terror. I felt no remorse, no guilt. This was the right thing to do. She needed this. I was giving her a gift.

Her body stopped moving after a while, the last breath escaping her lips in a faint, broken sound. I held on for a moment longer, waiting until the life drained from her eyes. When I finally let go, her body fell limp against the pavement.

I stood there, breathing heavily, my hands trembling as I looked down at her lifeless form. A strange sense of satisfaction washed over me. The voice had been right. This was necessary. I had done what was asked of me, and now... now I would finally receive my reward.

And then, the pain hit.

It was unlike anything I had ever felt before. A burning, searing agony exploded in my back, sharper than the spikes that had emerged before. I screamed, my body convulsing as I fell to my knees beside her corpse. My hands clawed at my back, but there was nothing I could do to stop it. The pain grew worse, spreading from my shoulders down to my spine as if my entire body was being torn apart from the inside.

And then I felt them‚Äîsomething large, heavy, and wet pushing through the torn skin of my back. The spikes, the ones that had been there for days, began to stretch and grow, tearing through the flesh with a sickening crack. Blood poured from the wounds, staining the pavement beneath me as the spikes unfurled.

I gasped, my breath catching in my throat as I felt them grow‚Äîlong, jagged, blood-soaked wings erupting from my back. They spread wide, casting dark shadows in the dim light of the streetlamp, each movement sending waves of pain through my body. I could feel the blood dripping down my sides, pooling beneath me as the wings twitched and flexed, heavy and sharp.

But through all the pain, I felt... alive. I looked up at the sky, my body trembling as I knelt in the pool of blood, her lifeless body beside me. The wings beat once, twice, heavy and strong, sending gusts of air around me.

""You've done it,"" the voice said, soft but triumphant. ""You've brought her to me. You've embraced your destiny, Jude. This is what you were meant to become.""

The pain was unbearable, but it didn't matter. I had become something more‚Äîsomething divine. I had fulfilled my purpose. The wings, though grotesque and soaked in blood, felt like the final piece of my transformation.

I had killed for God. And in return, He had given me this.

As I knelt there, the blood still seeping from my wounds, I felt a strange peace settle over me. This was what I was meant to do. This was who I was meant to be.

I woke up in the hospital, strapped to machines, barely able to move. At first, I thought it was a dream‚Äîone of those nightmares where you can't scream, can't even open your eyes. But it wasn't a dream. This was real. I couldn't move, couldn't feel anything from the neck down.

They told me I had been found in the middle of the street, covered in blood, barely alive. The police thought I was the victim of some random attack. They said it was a miracle I'd survived at all. The woman‚Äî*the woman I killed*‚Äîthey said she hadn't been so lucky. They told me they'd found her body next to mine, beaten, strangled. But they never suspected me. Not once. They said someone must've attacked us both, that I'd somehow made it out alive while she didn't.

It's strange. You'd think I'd feel relieved that I wasn't caught. But all I could feel was‚Ä¶ devastation.

I had failed Him.

The wings‚Äî*my wings*‚Äîwere gone. When I came to that hospital bed, paralyzed and broken, there was nothing left. No evidence of the transformation I had undergone. No proof of the divine being I was becoming. I had blacked out after my wings emerged, and now they were gone as if they had never been there at all.

And that‚Ä¶ that is what haunts me the most.

I didn't get to finish the work. I didn't get to bring the world closer to Him, to help them understand the beauty of suffering, the purity of pain. When I lost consciousness, I must have disappointed Him. I failed God at the moment when He needed me most.

Now I lie here, in this bed, day after day. Paralyzed. Bedridden. Useless. They gave me this device to help me communicate and to speak my thoughts aloud so I could share my story. But what good is it now? What good am I now?

Still‚Ä¶ even in this broken body, I feel something. A kind of peace. Yes, I failed Him in the end, but I was chosen.¬†*I was chosen*¬†to let Him experience life through me. And for that, I am grateful.

Every moment of pain, every act of suffering I brought into this world‚Ä¶ it wasn't for nothing. I allowed God to live through me, to feel what it means to be human. That was His wish, and I gave it to Him. Even if I couldn't see it through to the end, I did what He asked of me. I let Him feel.

I lie here now, knowing I won't ever walk again. I won't ever leave this bed. But I still feel blessed. I was His vessel. I carried out His will, even if I didn't finish it.

No one knows what really happened that night. They think I'm a survivor, some poor soul who barely escaped with his life. But that's not true. I wasn't the victim. I was¬†*chosen*. I was His instrument. And I will never forget that.

I close my eyes, and sometimes I can still feel the wings, the weight of them, the blood dripping from the tips. In those moments, I smile. I may have disappointed Him, but I let Him live through me. I gave Him what He wanted. And that's enough.",2,1740790069.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

For context, I‚Äôve been with my Muslim partner for about five years. Our relationship has had ups and downs‚Äîhe‚Äôs broken up with me a couple of times, saying we would never work out, only for us to end up talking again. Because of this, I stopped thinking about marriage as a real possibility.

The Proposal & His Assumptions

Last September, he officially asked for my hand in marriage, which caught me off guard. Here‚Äôs why:
	1.	He never directly told me he wanted to marry me. At one point, he told me he was going to marry me but was waiting for me to convert. Since I didn‚Äôt, I assumed marriage was off the table and just tried to appreciate the time we had together.
	2.	Before proposing, he traveled back home and told his family I would convert and that Islam was already in my heart. I found out after he had returned and asked for my hand. His mother welcomed me warmly, saying they love me and want me to be part of their family. While I was touched, I was also shocked because I was never explicitly asked if I would convert‚Äîhe had already decided I would.

Why Did He Assume I Would Convert?
	‚Ä¢	I fast during Ramadan because I enjoy it.
	‚Ä¢	I don‚Äôt eat pork or drink alcohol.
	‚Ä¢	I dress more modestly than I used to.
	‚Ä¢	I attended Taraweeh prayers twice and once tried on a hijab (even though I‚Äôve said I don‚Äôt see myself wearing it permanently).
	‚Ä¢	I told him I believe Jesus was a prophet rather than God.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve always struggled to understand the concept of the Trinity.

The Challenges
	1.	My Family‚Äôs Reaction:
	‚Ä¢	When I told my father about the proposal, he became very upset and said he would disown me if I converted.
	‚Ä¢	My stepdad and mom were initially supportive, but after seeing how persistent his family was about my conversion, they now think the situation is unfair.
	‚Ä¢	His family believes my father will ‚Äúcome around.‚Äù
	2.	I‚Äôm Not Religious & Neither Is He:
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve told him I don‚Äôt see myself being deeply religious, whether as a Christian or a Muslim.
	‚Ä¢	We spoke to an imam, and I explained that I feel like I‚Äôm being forced to choose between my father and the man I love.
	‚Ä¢	The imam said my fianc√© can marry me as a Christian, but he also suggested I convert in secret and tell my dad later to ‚Äúkeep the peace.‚Äù My mom was very upset by this.
	‚Ä¢	Despite insisting that I must convert to be a good Muslim wife, my fianc√© does not pray five times a day. He talks about the importance of faith and religious discipline, but he himself does not follow all the obligations of Islam.
	3.	Spiritual Conflict:
	‚Ä¢	Despite my lack of religious commitment, I still cross myself before bed‚Äîit brings me peace.
	‚Ä¢	When I told my fianc√©, he called it a ‚Äúkafir‚Äù (non-believer) thing to do and said I need to unlearn it.
	‚Ä¢	He often challenges my Christian background, saying Christianity is ‚Äúeasier‚Äù (e.g., allowing pork and alcohol) and that Islam is the true discipline.
	4.	Expectations & Double Standards:
	‚Ä¢	He says that if we marry and have children, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to properly raise them as Muslims unless Islam is truly in my heart.
	‚Ä¢	He says my family is disrespectful for not putting our dog away when his family visits, but I live with my parents and don‚Äôt make those decisions.
	‚Ä¢	He blames the lack of relationship with my family on me, saying I don‚Äôt invite him over for dinner or coffee enough. Yet, when I ask him to message my mom to build that relationship, he refuses and says the effort has to come from me.
	5.	The Pressure to Convert:
	‚Ä¢	He insists that converting wouldn‚Äôt change my life much because I already follow many Islamic practices.
	‚Ä¢	He says he wants me to convert for God, not for him, yet our relationship hinges on my conversion.
	‚Ä¢	He frequently reminds me how welcoming his family has been to me and how much effort they‚Äôve made, implying I should reciprocate by accepting Islam.

Where I Stand

I feel stuck. I genuinely love him and his family, and I know they love me too. But I also feel like I‚Äôm being pushed into something I‚Äôm not fully at peace with.
	‚Ä¢	If I convert, I feel like I‚Äôm losing a part of myself and making a huge life change I can‚Äôt confidently explain to my family.
	‚Ä¢	If I don‚Äôt convert, I lose the person I love and the family I‚Äôve become attached to.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like I have to justify why I wouldn‚Äôt convert, even though I shouldn‚Äôt have to. It feels like I can‚Äôt win either way.

It takes me about five months to fill up each side so the old side ends up in there about 10 months. When I stop adding kitchen scraps to a side I still keep adding coffee grounds and leaves as it shrinks until it's full again. Both sides have loads of worms. The worms survived several nights in the single digits Fahrenheit and lots of nights in the teens over winter.

   - While the Basilica Cistern is popular, not everyone knows about the mysterious Medusa heads at the base of two columns. Legend has it they were placed upside down to ward off evil spirits.  

3. Arasta Bazaar:  
   - Skip the crowds at the Grand Bazaar and explore this smaller, more intimate market near the Blue Mosque. It‚Äôs great for authentic souvenirs and carpets.  

4. Princes‚Äô Islands (B√ºy√ºkada):  
   - Take a ferry to this car-free island and rent a bike to explore its charming streets and Ottoman-era mansions. It‚Äôs a peaceful escape from the city‚Äôs hustle.  

5. Turkish Coffee at Mandabatmaz:  
   - Tucked away near Istiklal Street, this tiny spot serves some of the best Turkish coffee in the city. It‚Äôs a local favorite!

¬†

God has blessed my family and given my family and me so many second chances at life and living that I hope we do not waste them. Everything I have written has happened to my family and me, and there may be more things than I can remember. These wondrous things that have happened to us are in chronological order and span five decades, from 1975 to 2025. I feel and know that God looks after his own, for I have experienced that. I know many things have happened to my family and me, but these happenings are spread over a fifty-year period, and a lot can happen in fifty years in a person's life and a family's life.

¬†

When I was a teenager, my family had a swimming pool and one day, in the summer of 1975, I was swimming alone in the pool as I was home, and I dived into the pool far too deep for the pool itself and as a result of the dive my chin hit the bottom of the pool with a loud clicking sound and with much force, My life could have ended with me floating or sinking in the pool and drowning as I was by myself in the pool. If I were paralysed, I would not have been able to save myself and get out of the pool.

¬†

When I was approaching the end of Year 10, in 1975, my parents arranged for a transfer to a new school for me to study Music the following year as my current school was not offering that in Years 11 and 12. I got a transfer to the school, although I was outside its catchment area, and in doing so, I managed to go to a better school as I was bullied in junior high. The bullying stopped and did not happen at the new school, and I got to study Music. That is God making things happen, as I was not in the catchment area for the new school when I went to junior high, and I still was not in their catchment area, and I got to study music and evade the bullies. I got a place in the new school.

¬†

When I studied hard to get through Years 11 and 12, I scored high enough in my Higher School Certificate to attend Macquarie University, study History, and get a Bachelor of Arts. The university was a bit tough at times, but I got through them and graduated.

¬†

When I met Jackie at a Christian Youth Group called Young Life, and we dated each other, my mum told me after just a couple of weeks that I should let Jackie know how I felt about her. And so, one night a week later, I did, and we went from boyfriend and girlfriend to steady to engaged on that one night as I proposed to her. She said ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, and I did not even have a ring. I was not planning to propose that night, it just happened. I had known Jackie for less than six weeks at the time. My mother got me to follow my heart and not my head, for Jackie had already captured my heart, and she still has it, and mums know who is right for their boys.

¬†

When my mum showed me an advertisement for a government job, I had just finished university and was due to be married in less than two months, but I got one from them. I even asked for leave without pay for my honeymoon when I was being interviewed for the job. I stayed in that job for over eighteen years, and everything was okay once I started working to take time off for my honeymoon.

¬†

We got married on 5th December 1981, and the next day, we set out on our honeymoon. On our way to Forster, we were on the freeway heading north from Hornsby, and a woman in the lane next to us had a trailer. She puts on her blinker and starts to move over into our lane, but we are in her blind spot. I try to move over and give her room and slow down, but we are all at highway speeds, and she is still moving over increasingly into my lane. And I blasted my horn. She entered my lane, leaving me with nowhere to go as there were traffic safety barriers on the side of the road and a ditch. I was into them, and she finally heard me and realised that we were there and moved back into her lane; on our honeymoon, we had a dangerous start to our married life.

¬†

When we were newly married and renting a unit in West Ryde, a bill came in that we could not pay. Then, a cheque arrived in the mail the day after we got that bill, and it was not too late to pay it. We were not expecting the cheque. We did not know the cheque was coming, and it was for a couple of dollars less than the bill. Now, we can pay the bill.

¬†

When we rented that unit, we asked if we could put a deadlock in the door. The real estate agreed that we should give them a set of keys and leave the lock on the door after we vacated the unit. A couple of months later, all the units in the unit block were burgled except for ours and one other. A total of ten units in the block of twelve units were burgled, but of the two that were not, both of those units had deadbolts, and one of the units was ours. The remaining units did not have deadlock, and they all had the same type of lock that made it easy to break into the units.

¬†

When we had our first car, a green Holden HQ Kingswood sedan, someone stole it from the unit carpark. Fortunately, it was found later that day in Eastern Creek but was written off. The police found the car without us having to wait months for the insurance company to decide when they would have paid out the claim if the vehicle had not been found and recovered.

¬†

We were renting the unit at West Ryde, and it was almost time to renew the lease or move out; we had not made up our minds about which way we were going to jump; my parents had decided to go on an extended holiday for four months overseas, and so the decision is made for us as we were asked to housesit for them. We did not have much furniture, and my parents had a large downstairs room we could live in, and we had a toilet and shower to use next to the room. My parents had prepaid all their bills, so we do not have any to pay them. We were provided a place to live rent-free while they were away and for a couple of months when they returned home.

¬†

When we moved out of my parents' house, we found a unit to rent for a year in Meadowbank. During that year and the time, we spent at my parents' house before that, we saved up enough money to deposit on another unit in Meadowbank. We paid off a small personal loan and bought the unit. We exited the rental market and entered a mortgaged unit we owned.

¬†

When we had been married for six years, and our parents asked us when we would give them grandchildren, we had not even thought about having children as we had been too busy with work, holidays and looking after my younger brother Christopher on many occasions. We decided to try to have a child. It only took six weeks for Jackie to fall pregnant after being on the pill for eight years, and she carried Michelle to full term. Michelle was born with the aid of forceps as she was not positioned right for the birth, and then the birth went smoothly because of the skill of the doctor and the use of the forceps.

¬†

When we realised, before Michelle was born, how difficult it would be to bring up a baby in a top-floor unit without a laundry and that disposable nappies were not around, we decided to sell the unit and buy a house. Still, we must first find a buyer for the unit and a house to live in. The unit was sold on the day it was listed, and the house hunt began. We found a house to buy and moved in before our daughter was born. That is God who found us the buyer so quickly, and even though we looked at many houses, we found one to buy at the right time, so we were able to move into the house on the same day that the unit sale was finalised when the new owners took possession of the unit.

¬†

When we were shopping at Blacktown Westpoint, Michelle was a year old, so we had a trolley, a pram, and a package to get out of the lift. We pushed the pram out first, and then both Jackie and I went back into the lift to get the rest. The lift door shuts on us, and the lift starts moving up to the next floor, leaving Michelle alone in her pram on the floor we just came from. We hurried down to that floor after the lift stopped higher up and found the pram surrounded by several elderly ladies, all wondering where the mother was. Michelle was not alone; she had got the ladies' attention and was not taken away by anyone or abducted.

¬†

When I hit a semi-trailer, I got a written-off car as the whole front of the car, from both front doors to the front bumper bar, was damaged as I had lost control of the vehicle on a wet road, and we were headed for a telegraph pole. I slid across three lanes of the road without being in control of the car, but we hit the truck instead and were pushed by the impact back into the lane we started instead of the telegraph pole being wrapped around the pole. The car got written off by the insurance company. Nothing happened to me; my wife Jackie got whiplash and got over it successfully, and our two-year-old daughter Michelle got the imprint of the buckle from her safety child car seat on her stomach. The insurance company replaces the child's car seat, but she is okay.

¬†

Years later than the accident, we have a second child, Marcus, who would not have been born if we had perished in the crash, and decades later than that, I realise how fortunate we were to have survived the crash as we would not have had Marcus if we had died. He would never have existed, for he had not even been conceived then. The truck was in the right place at the right time to stop us from hitting the telegraph pole.

¬†

When we tried for another child, months went on, and we lost heart and thought it was never going to happen, and it did not; we stopped actively trying for a child, and then Jackie fell pregnant after we had given up trying for one. We got a second child.

¬†

When my youngest child, Marcus, was three years old, my wife Jackie was doing housework, and she was home alone with Marcus that day when she heard an audible voice inside her room. It was spoken out aloud, and no one was there, and the voice was telling her to go and check on Marcus. She went out the front of the house to look for him, and he was on the road. She gathers him and takes him back inside, and he is safe from any potential harm from any vehicle on the road.

¬†

When we were on holiday in Dubbo, and we were all in a large op-shop, and our four-year-old son, Marcus, went off by himself, which he usually does in a store, but usually, he stays in any store that we‚Äôre in, but this time he leaves the store, and we did not know that he had left the store. My wife, daughter, and I looked for him, but he was not in the store. So, we left the store and turned to the left, not the right, although we had no idea which way he went, and we started walking away from the store. Then, we met up with a man and his wife walking toward us. He is holding Marcus high up in his arms, and Marcus is safe; the man says he picked up Marcus as Marcus was crossing a road by himself at the pedestrian crossing, and it did not look right to the man, as Marcus was not walking with any parents. So, he picked up Marcus and backtracked with Marcus to see if he could find us. He did find us, and we were reunited with our son.

¬†

When we were on holiday driving back from Melbourne to Sydney, our children were young, and we were at a roadside rest stop with a toilet. Our older child Michelle wanted to go to the off she went by herself. To my horror, I realised it was a pit toilet. I told my wife Jackie to run after our daughter, and my wife got there and managed to save our daughter from disappearing into the pit of poo and wee that was below the toilet seat because the toilet is made for adult bottoms, not smaller children‚Äôs bottoms. Fortunately, our child had left the toilet door open so Jackie could grab her before she disappeared into the pit below her. Michelle almost fell in, and she would have drowned in the pit if she had fallen in.

¬†

When we were so broke that all we could afford to eat was sausages and potato mash for weeks, we fed our family; my wife, Jackie, talked to some of the ladies at the church we were going to She spoke of how hard we were finding it financially, and someone we never found out who did it put an envelope in the offering tray with our name on it, and it had $100 in notes. In the nineties, $100 was considered a substantial amount of money. One of the church‚Äôs elders gave us the envelope containing the money. We were at our lowest financial point.

¬†

After leaving that church, as Marcus was a bit too much for them, he was the only special needs child in the church, and Marcus had behavioural issues. We started going to another church where Marcus was accepted for who he was. Jackie and I went through the waters of an adult baptism. We found a new church suitable for Marcus and for us to acknowledge God as our Lord through an adult baptism.

¬†

When I was on holiday with my family in Melbourne, on yet another holiday in Melbourne, and we were lost and parked on the side of the road, a truck came over the hill from behind us and hit our car. Still, all that was hit was our driver's door exterior mirror, the only part of the car that broke. It could have been a lot worse if the truck had been a little bit closer to us, as our car would have been pushed forward violently from behind by the truck. It would have been a bad accident, potentially a fatal one.

¬†

When I was on that holiday to Melbourne with my family, we were on a bus the day we left the car for the mirror repair. We were having difficulty settling Marcus, and a lady came over and prayed for my family and me Marcus settled down. We needed that intercessory prayer. She said that God told her to pray for us, so she did.

¬†

When my wife Jackie had a series of mini-strokes, and we already had two children, we were told that she had to go off the pill right then and that I would need a vasectomy as an operation to tie her tubes would have been too dangerous for Jackie to have as would another pregnancy and childbirth as she could die from either the operation, or from pregnancy or giving birth and so I went ahead with getting the vasectomy, and we had counselling. I wanted to keep Jackie safe, alive, and well, and we made the right decision about me getting the vasectomy. I got to keep my wife safe by getting the vasectomy and enabling Jackie to be still alive. Otherwise, I would have become a widower with small children.

¬†

After experiencing chest pain for a long time, months, and months, in mid-1999, I visited a doctor at the recommendation of my wife. X-rays, ultrasounds, and a biopsy showed that my thyroid gland had significantly enlarged and extended deep down into my chest cavity. It was pushing my oesophagus, windpipe out of the way, and my other organs. ¬†If it were not for my wife getting me to see the doctor, I would have died once the windpipe had fully closed because I could live without food for a while if my oesophagus had closed, but I cannot live without air if my windpipe had closed. Getting a hole put in my neck to use for breathing would not have worked for breathing as the windpipe and oesophagus were much lower down in my chest cavity where they were being squished. The surgeon was able to remove the thyroid through my neck as he was thinking at first of cracking open my ribcage to get at the thyroid from below it as it was deep, far down into my chest cavity, which would have had more risks and a more complicated period of recovery. Still, he was able to remove the thyroid through my neck and hide the scar in a skin fold. I got through the entire process of getting the medical and surgical help I needed.

¬†

When I was awaiting a phone call to find out if my thyroid was cancerous as I had had a biopsy and I was at work, a workmate told me that my wife was on the phone for me, and my wife Jackie said, ""There's no cancer"", and right then at that moment I felt two hands on my shoulders from behind me. I turned around to see who had touched me, and nobody was there; the nearest member of staff was three metres in front of me, and it was not her, yet I felt the hands on both of my shoulders; it was a physical touch as I did feel them.

¬†

When I saw a cat on TV that was twitching and moving while asleep, and it moved so much that it fell off the coffee table that it was lying on, and the commentator said the cat had REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder, I told my wife, ‚ÄúLook, that‚Äôs me.‚Äù I had been having dreams where I became active while dreaming instead of remaining passive, and I moved around and fell out of bed while fast asleep, which had happened several times. I went to the hospital and saw a sleep specialist, had a sleep study, and got diagnosed with REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder. The sleep doctor started talking about Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and my short-term memory issues. I watched a TV program I did not know was on as I was just channel surfing. It got me to make the connection between me and my sleeping behaviour and the cats and this led to a diagnosis of REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder.

¬†

When I had a shoulder ache, and it had been there for a long time, and I had not seen a doctor as I am a man, for it‚Äôll be right and the church we were attending, had for the first time in the years we had been going there, they have a visiting healer. I got to the front, sat on the chair, and didn't tell the healer what was wrong with me; he didn't ask. I got holy oil on my forehead, was prayed over with the laying on of hands, and returned to my seat. Then I got a burning circle of hotness, red hot, right where my shoulder had been hurting, and after a while, the burning sensation went away, and I realised that the shoulder pain had gone and did not come back.

¬†

When my eldest child Michelle was getting bullied at high school, and Jackie and I decided to take her out of that school system altogether, we contacted another school. We were nowhere near their catchment area. Yet, they accepted her, and she settled into the new school, and the bullying stopped; she got to make some strong friendships. Later, one of the bullies from the other school starts at our daughter‚Äôs new school, and our daughter is OK as she now has a circle of true friends who tell that bully to leave her alone as the bully tried to bully her again and the bullying is nipped in the bud.

¬†

When our church closed as it was not viable, we joined a new church where we settled, and Marcus was accepted by that church, even though he had special needs. Congregation members had been praying for someone like Marcus to come along, and Marcus went to the new church with us. We got into a new church suitable for all my family.

¬†

When I enter a competition, many times to win $1000, and the community organisation I nominate in the competition will win $10,000, I pray about it. I nominate our new church, and so on. For every entry, I nominate our new church. I did well over thirty entries. I won $1000, and our new church got the $10,000. The cheques were timely for our new church and us and were needed when the Global Financial Crisis was on.

¬†

When Marcus is in Year 11, his high school tries to get him to sign himself out, leave the school permanently, and not return for Year 12. It would have been a bad idea as the community participation program he would have done after schooling had finished for him was for special needs people after they finished Year 12, not Year 11. A place was found for him at a dedicated special needs school for Year 12, which he completed. It was the best year of schooling that he ever had. Marcus went to the new school, the best place for him.

¬†

We renewed our wedding vows on our 30th wedding anniversary, and we did so in front of our church congregation. This time, unlike when we were married, I got to kiss the bride, as I did not get to kiss my bride in our wedding ceremony thirty years before. We publicly show our commitment to each other by renewing one of the important vows possible.

¬†

When Marcus and I boarded a crowded train full of people, I almost lost hold of him while pulling him into the carriage. I would have left him behind. We kept together as if Marcus had been left alone on the platform; I do not know what would have happened to him.

¬†

In a thundering thunderstorm, when the wind and the rain were pouring down a lot, the eucalyptus tree in the backyard fell over and landed on top of our house. It was a widow-maker. I was in the bathroom underneath the tree, and I was safe, and Marcus was in the kitchen, and he was safe. Most of the tree's weight was in its trunk, and the trunk was in the backyard, with many branches on top of the house as far as the front main bedroom.

¬†

When I noticed symptoms that were happening to me, I didn't know what was wrong with me. I saw a neurologist. ‚ÄúYou have Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment,‚Äù and now I know what I‚Äôve got, I can get help and treatment for it. ¬†Now, my symptoms make sense to me, and the type of Mild Cognitive Impairment that I have doesn‚Äôt affect my long-term memory, only short-term memory and some of my power of thought. I got a diagnosis, and what the sleep specialist had talked about so many years before had come true as I ended up with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease.

¬†

My wife Jackie gave me the support and comfort that I needed after being diagnosed with a life-changing diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, and she continues to provide me with the support and comfort over the years before, during and after that diagnosis.

¬†

I drove through an intersection at 50 km per hour with a stop sign that I did not know was there. I did not think I was in an intersection, and I heard the car horn frantically blasting at me from another car as I should have stopped for them. I did not know they were there until they blasted their horn. I looked through my driver‚Äôs window, and all I could see was a car. It was getting closer and closer to us, and both drivers took evasive action, but I did not hit them. I should have stopped for them as they had the right of way. Our car did not roll with the manoeuvre I did, which was to turn the steering wheel hard to the left abruptly and then hard to the right to give us more room between our car and the other car. We missed the other car and the telegraph pole that the other driver thought we would hit after missing her car. She stops near our car, talks to us, and tells us she has her mum and her son in the car. I have my son and my wife, and if I had hit the other car, my family and I and her and her family might have been injured or died, with casualties in both cars. Still, I missed her and the telegraph pole.

¬†

After missing the car at the stop sign, I decided to stop driving that afternoon once I got home, and shortly after that, my neurologist and my GP forbade me from driving. I know they're both right anyway. I‚Äôve already stopped driving as I know I‚Äôm a dangerous driver, driving dangerously on the road. I‚Äôm thankful they and I made the right decision to stop driving. I realised my driving days were over and getting me to accept that fact without second thoughts.

¬†

When I got into the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) on my third attempt at getting accepted into the NDIS, sometimes, God said, ‚ÄòWait.‚Äô Now, I can get the help that I need for my Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment from the NDIS. I got in with perfect timing onto the system when I was prepared for it,

¬†

After my diagnosis of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, my wife and I decided that as I worsened, as that was likely to happen, she wouldn‚Äôt be able to look after Marcus and me, so we made the decision to find Marcus‚Äôs accommodation in a supported independent living share house as he‚Äôs special needs. A place is found for him, and he loves it. We know that after we die, Marcus will be looked after as he is in the system, and we made the right decision for his short-term and long-term living needs.

¬†

When I was in the hospital with Septic Shock because of a nasty bacterial infection from a bacteria called Proteus mirabilis, which is found in soil and potting mix, and I was a gardener as a hobby, I got blood poisoning. I was on life support and in a coma for three days and three nights. My heart was enlarged, my kidneys had shut down, a kidney stone blocked one of the ureters from one of my kidneys, I had blood poisoning, both of my lungs had been infected with that nasty bacterium, and I was on dialysis. My brain is in la-la-land as I have delirium, and the delirium persists well after I am brought out of the coma, as the delirium lasts for more than a week. I‚Äôm contagious with the bacteria, and I‚Äôm in ICU for ten days in a private room as I‚Äôm in isolation; visitors must put on disposable clothes, gloves, and a face mask to come into my room and then dispose of the clothing when they leave my room.

¬†

After the time I spent in the ICU, I was put in the general ward. I come through the whole lot OK without losing a hand or a foot or anything else to sepsis, as many people who end up with sepsis need to have their limbs amputated. As that part of them dies, or they die. For five thousand people a year, for approximately five thousand people die from sepsis in Australia. I got over the delirium, and I still remember the thoughts that I had while delirious. My wife Jackie was there with me for every one of those sixteen days that I was in the hospital, and she had to catch four buses a day to get in to see me and then go home, two each way. I got through sepsis and kept my body intact, and my wife was there every day for me.

¬†

Before finding out that I had blood poisoning and sepsis, I had pain. I went to the hospital earlier in the week, where they took blood, with the result that they were able to culture it and identify the specific bacteria that had infected me, so they didn‚Äôt have to hit it with a broad-spectrum drug and hope for the best but knew exactly what treatment and drug I would need. They stressed how urgent it was that I came back to the hospital for treatment, and I was in the operating theatre that night.

¬†

When I was getting a regular skin cancer check, the skin cancer specialist found a basal cell carcinoma on my nose that I did not know was there. He can remove all the skin cancer, and it is good that he got it all, as otherwise it would eat down through my nose and get bigger, resulting in complex facial surgery and reconstruction. I did not need a more complicated operation to catch and get rid of the skin cancer in time before it got worse.

¬†

I went on a cruise with my dad, just the two of us, on the Majestic Princess down to Tasmania from Sydney and back again, and we had a suite. It was just before COVID-19 entered the world when Dad could still get around, even though he was in his eighties, and we had a wonderful time together. We got time together that we usually would not have before he passed away a couple of years later.

¬†

After visiting my father, who was in a hospital at the time, during the COVID era, I was the one nominated visitor that he could have at the hospital and on my way back to the railway station, I hurried across a road with an active Don't Walk sign flashing on the traffic light crossing. I should not have been crossing the road as the Don't Walk had started flashing, and I fell onto the road in front of a bus. I do not know if the bus driver saw me go down. I was able to pick myself up off the ground and hobble away. I only hurt my elbow, and my shoe came off. Fortunately, the red arrow for the bus stayed red while I was on the crossing. I were still on the ground in front of the bus, if the red arrow had changed, the bus could have started moving right on top of me, running over me while I was on the ground. A woman on the opposite side of the road also called me to see if I was OK.

¬†

Also, on another day, when we travelled home by bus, I was carrying two shopping bags in each hand. I could not hold the seat next to me or the hand straps hanging down from the ceiling as I did not think of putting the bags down; anyway, there was not enough room in the bus for me to put them down. I tried to keep myself upright, and as the bus moved away from the bus stop, I lost my balance and started to fall onto a mother and her pram that had two babies in it. I was falling, and I could not do anything to stop myself. The pram was getting closer as I fell, and a woman sitting on the seat behind me managed to grab hold of me by my belt near my bottom and my shoulder. She pulled me upright before I landed on top of the two babies and their mum. I am not a light person as I am obese, yet she found the strength to pull me upright and the room in the bus to get to me before it was too late, and then someone offered me their seat after my fall.

¬†

My father, Bruce, passed away, and we had a funeral for him. Shortly after the funeral, we were allowed into his unit to clear it out, as Mum had passed away several years before Dad. I found out that Dad had kept many of the birthday, Christmas, and Father‚Äôs Day cards that we had given him as children, and they were in his bedside cabinet, and I had worn his wedding ring from the day of his death. I was shown how sentimental Dad was, as I did not expect him to be so sappy.

¬†

When Marcus, our special needs son, decided to leave his group house where he was living and went without telling the staff, and no one went with him, he got on a bus at Baulkham Hills and travelled to Rouse Hill, which was the last stop for the bus, by himself. We were on holiday in Hobart in another state, and the police contacted us; after that call, we could track where Marcus went by using his Opal public transport card, as Marcus knew how to tap on and off his Opal card. Opal allowed us to track his trip movements, and we rang the police and the house staff to tell them both what we had found out from Opal and the house staff. The police found him at Rouse Hill Shopping Centre. They heard him before they saw him, and Marcus talked loudly to himself. They turned around a corner at the shops, and there he was. Rouse Hill Shops is not your standard type of shopping centre, as it is spread over a large area instead of confined under one roof. Marcus was safe and able to be found by the police and the house staff.

Years after my father died, my wife, Jackie, stepped on an old answering machine that we were no longer using as we are on the NBN and a home phone is not needed; it‚Äôs on the floor, and a message is on it, and it starts playing, and the message is from my deceased father, recorded by him whilst he was alive. We did not know the message was on it. In the message, my dad tells me not to worry about anything and that he loves me. I now realise that I was meant to hear it when I needed to and recorded it on my computer. Now, I can listen to my dad whenever I need to or want to, even though after listening to him, I realise how much I miss him, and sometimes I am overcome by emotion, for I‚Äôm still grieving for him for I have lost a piece of my heart. It has been four years since he died, but I am not going to delete the recording as my dad is on it. It pains me that after Mum died, I was not enough to keep him alive and nor were the rest of my siblings, as all he wanted was to be with Mum. he had lost his will to live, and he had stopped eating, and now he is with Mum. We discovered the phone call when I needed to with the words of comfort on it from Dad, which are helping me in my grieving process.

¬†

When Jackie passed out and was in a diabetic coma last Mother‚Äôs Day at Featherdale Wildlife Park, the 000 operator gave us her full attention. The first aid staff from Featherdale looked after Jackie whilst we were waiting for the ambulance, and the ambulance came. Jackie was not in a coma once they arrived at Featherdale; she was taken to the hospital for observation and admitted to the hospital. As a result of the diabetic coma and hospital admission, Jackie started testing herself for the sugar readings for her diabetes and looking after herself and her diabetes better. Jackie was stirred into action regarding her diabetes.

¬†

A couple of weeks ago, a stray cat turned up on our doorstep and stayed, and he had no collar and no microchip. Jackie named him Max, and we have fallen in love with him. We got a chance to look after another cat and share our family and our home with him, and we have all fallen in love with Max,

¬†

In early February 2025, I made a new friend, Patrick, whom I call my little brother from another mother. Although taller than me, he is far younger and a Christian. I told him I only had one person to talk to: my wife, Jackie. Patrick gave me his phone number and said I could call him. Here is to a long friendship with Patrick. I now have a friend I can call when I want to talk to a friend.

¬†

This year, I am using support workers to take me to medical appointments and for social activities, which is something new for me as I used to spend most of my time at home alone. I‚Äôm getting out of the house and interacting with more people than I usually would.

¬†

In all that has happened to my family and me, God has always been there for us in the good times and the tough times. He has protected us over all the instances where we felt his Glory by God looking after us mentally, spiritually, physically, emotionally, financially, in times of illness and poor health, and in dangerous times on the road. God was always there in every situation, especially the ones that could have resulted in injury or death, for I am not so lucky to have all the things that have happened to me and my family by chance, instead it was all planned. ¬†God gave me a wife, Jackie, who has always been there for me and my children, and for her; I am profoundly grateful to God for eternity long and then some for finding me a wife who loves me, and I love her.

For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. Jeremiah 29:11.

Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be in dread of them, for it is the Lord your God who goes with you. He will not leave you or forsake you. Deuteronomy 31:6.

Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. Isaiah 41:10.

God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Psalm 46:1.

And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. Romans 8:28.

For you have been my help, and in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy. Psalm 63:7.

Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. Psalm 23:4.

God has blessed my family and given my family and me so many second chances at life and living that I hope we do not waste them. Everything I have written has happened to my family and me, and there may be more things than I can remember. These wondrous things that have happened to us are in chronological order and span five decades, from 1975 to 2025. I feel and know that God looks after his own, for I have experienced that. I know many things have happened to my family and me, but these happenings are spread over a fifty-year period, and a lot can happen in fifty years in a person's life and a family's life.

¬†

When I was a teenager, my family had a swimming pool and one day, in the summer of 1975, I was swimming alone in the pool as I was home, and I dived into the pool far too deep for the pool itself and as a result of the dive my chin hit the bottom of the pool with a loud clicking sound and with much force, My life could have ended with me floating or sinking in the pool and drowning as I was by myself in the pool. If I were paralysed, I would not have been able to save myself and get out of the pool.

¬†

When I was approaching the end of Year 10, in 1975, my parents arranged for a transfer to a new school for me to study Music the following year as my current school was not offering that in Years 11 and 12. I got a transfer to the school, although I was outside its catchment area, and in doing so, I managed to go to a better school as I was bullied in junior high. The bullying stopped and did not happen at the new school, and I got to study Music. That is God making things happen, as I was not in the catchment area for the new school when I went to junior high, and I still was not in their catchment area, and I got to study music and evade the bullies. I got a place in the new school.

¬†

When I studied hard to get through Years 11 and 12, I scored high enough in my Higher School Certificate to attend Macquarie University, study History, and get a Bachelor of Arts. The university was a bit tough at times, but I got through them and graduated.

¬†

When I met Jackie at a Christian Youth Group called Young Life, and we dated each other, my mum told me after just a couple of weeks that I should let Jackie know how I felt about her. And so, one night a week later, I did, and we went from boyfriend and girlfriend to steady to engaged on that one night as I proposed to her. She said ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, and I did not even have a ring. I was not planning to propose that night, it just happened. I had known Jackie for less than six weeks at the time. My mother got me to follow my heart and not my head, for Jackie had already captured my heart, and she still has it, and mums know who is right for their boys.

¬†

When my mum showed me an advertisement for a government job, I had just finished university and was due to be married in less than two months, but I got one from them. I even asked for leave without pay for my honeymoon when I was being interviewed for the job. I stayed in that job for over eighteen years, and everything was okay once I started working to take time off for my honeymoon.

¬†

We got married on 5th December 1981, and the next day, we set out on our honeymoon. On our way to Forster, we were on the freeway heading north from Hornsby, and a woman in the lane next to us had a trailer. She puts on her blinker and starts to move over into our lane, but we are in her blind spot. I try to move over and give her room and slow down, but we are all at highway speeds, and she is still moving over increasingly into my lane. And I blasted my horn. She entered my lane, leaving me with nowhere to go as there were traffic safety barriers on the side of the road and a ditch. I was into them, and she finally heard me and realised that we were there and moved back into her lane; on our honeymoon, we had a dangerous start to our married life.

¬†

When we were newly married and renting a unit in West Ryde, a bill came in that we could not pay. Then, a cheque arrived in the mail the day after we got that bill, and it was not too late to pay it. We were not expecting the cheque. We did not know the cheque was coming, and it was for a couple of dollars less than the bill. Now, we can pay the bill.

¬†

When we rented that unit, we asked if we could put a deadlock in the door. The real estate agreed that we should give them a set of keys and leave the lock on the door after we vacated the unit. A couple of months later, all the units in the unit block were burgled except for ours and one other. A total of ten units in the block of twelve units were burgled, but of the two that were not, both of those units had deadbolts, and one of the units was ours. The remaining units did not have deadlock, and they all had the same type of lock that made it easy to break into the units.

¬†

When we had our first car, a green Holden HQ Kingswood sedan, someone stole it from the unit carpark. Fortunately, it was found later that day in Eastern Creek but was written off. The police found the car without us having to wait months for the insurance company to decide when they would have paid out the claim if the vehicle had not been found and recovered.

¬†

We were renting the unit at West Ryde, and it was almost time to renew the lease or move out; we had not made up our minds about which way we were going to jump; my parents had decided to go on an extended holiday for four months overseas, and so the decision is made for us as we were asked to housesit for them. We did not have much furniture, and my parents had a large downstairs room we could live in, and we had a toilet and shower to use next to the room. My parents had prepaid all their bills, so we do not have any to pay them. We were provided a place to live rent-free while they were away and for a couple of months when they returned home.

¬†

When we moved out of my parents' house, we found a unit to rent for a year in Meadowbank. During that year and the time, we spent at my parents' house before that, we saved up enough money to deposit on another unit in Meadowbank. We paid off a small personal loan and bought the unit. We exited the rental market and entered a mortgaged unit we owned.

¬†

When we had been married for six years, and our parents asked us when we would give them grandchildren, we had not even thought about having children as we had been too busy with work, holidays and looking after my younger brother Christopher on many occasions. We decided to try to have a child. It only took six weeks for Jackie to fall pregnant after being on the pill for eight years, and she carried Michelle to full term. Michelle was born with the aid of forceps as she was not positioned right for the birth, and then the birth went smoothly because of the skill of the doctor and the use of the forceps.

¬†

When we realised, before Michelle was born, how difficult it would be to bring up a baby in a top-floor unit without a laundry and that disposable nappies were not around, we decided to sell the unit and buy a house. Still, we must first find a buyer for the unit and a house to live in. The unit was sold on the day it was listed, and the house hunt began. We found a house to buy and moved in before our daughter was born. That is God who found us the buyer so quickly, and even though we looked at many houses, we found one to buy at the right time, so we were able to move into the house on the same day that the unit sale was finalised when the new owners took possession of the unit.

¬†

When we were shopping at Blacktown Westpoint, Michelle was a year old, so we had a trolley, a pram, and a package to get out of the lift. We pushed the pram out first, and then both Jackie and I went back into the lift to get the rest. The lift door shuts on us, and the lift starts moving up to the next floor, leaving Michelle alone in her pram on the floor we just came from. We hurried down to that floor after the lift stopped higher up and found the pram surrounded by several elderly ladies, all wondering where the mother was. Michelle was not alone; she had got the ladies' attention and was not taken away by anyone or abducted.

¬†

When I hit a semi-trailer, I got a written-off car as the whole front of the car, from both front doors to the front bumper bar, was damaged as I had lost control of the vehicle on a wet road, and we were headed for a telegraph pole. I slid across three lanes of the road without being in control of the car, but we hit the truck instead and were pushed by the impact back into the lane we started instead of the telegraph pole being wrapped around the pole. The car got written off by the insurance company. Nothing happened to me; my wife Jackie got whiplash and got over it successfully, and our two-year-old daughter Michelle got the imprint of the buckle from her safety child car seat on her stomach. The insurance company replaces the child's car seat, but she is okay.

¬†

Years later than the accident, we have a second child, Marcus, who would not have been born if we had perished in the crash, and decades later than that, I realise how fortunate we were to have survived the crash as we would not have had Marcus if we had died. He would never have existed, for he had not even been conceived then. The truck was in the right place at the right time to stop us from hitting the telegraph pole.

¬†

When we tried for another child, months went on, and we lost heart and thought it was never going to happen, and it did not; we stopped actively trying for a child, and then Jackie fell pregnant after we had given up trying for one. We got a second child.

¬†

When my youngest child, Marcus, was three years old, my wife Jackie was doing housework, and she was home alone with Marcus that day when she heard an audible voice inside her room. It was spoken out aloud, and no one was there, and the voice was telling her to go and check on Marcus. She went out the front of the house to look for him, and he was on the road. She gathers him and takes him back inside, and he is safe from any potential harm from any vehicle on the road.

¬†

When we were on holiday in Dubbo, and we were all in a large op-shop, and our four-year-old son, Marcus, went off by himself, which he usually does in a store, but usually, he stays in any store that we‚Äôre in, but this time he leaves the store, and we did not know that he had left the store. My wife, daughter, and I looked for him, but he was not in the store. So, we left the store and turned to the left, not the right, although we had no idea which way he went, and we started walking away from the store. Then, we met up with a man and his wife walking toward us. He is holding Marcus high up in his arms, and Marcus is safe; the man says he picked up Marcus as Marcus was crossing a road by himself at the pedestrian crossing, and it did not look right to the man, as Marcus was not walking with any parents. So, he picked up Marcus and backtracked with Marcus to see if he could find us. He did find us, and we were reunited with our son.

¬†

When we were on holiday driving back from Melbourne to Sydney, our children were young, and we were at a roadside rest stop with a toilet. Our older child Michelle wanted to go to the off she went by herself. To my horror, I realised it was a pit toilet. I told my wife Jackie to run after our daughter, and my wife got there and managed to save our daughter from disappearing into the pit of poo and wee that was below the toilet seat because the toilet is made for adult bottoms, not smaller children‚Äôs bottoms. Fortunately, our child had left the toilet door open so Jackie could grab her before she disappeared into the pit below her. Michelle almost fell in, and she would have drowned in the pit if she had fallen in.

¬†

When we were so broke that all we could afford to eat was sausages and potato mash for weeks, we fed our family; my wife, Jackie, talked to some of the ladies at the church we were going to She spoke of how hard we were finding it financially, and someone we never found out who did it put an envelope in the offering tray with our name on it, and it had $100 in notes. In the nineties, $100 was considered a substantial amount of money. One of the church‚Äôs elders gave us the envelope containing the money. We were at our lowest financial point.

¬†

After leaving that church, as Marcus was a bit too much for them, he was the only special needs child in the church, and Marcus had behavioural issues. We started going to another church where Marcus was accepted for who he was. Jackie and I went through the waters of an adult baptism. We found a new church suitable for Marcus and for us to acknowledge God as our Lord through an adult baptism.

¬†

When I was on holiday with my family in Melbourne, on yet another holiday in Melbourne, and we were lost and parked on the side of the road, a truck came over the hill from behind us and hit our car. Still, all that was hit was our driver's door exterior mirror, the only part of the car that broke. It could have been a lot worse if the truck had been a little bit closer to us, as our car would have been pushed forward violently from behind by the truck. It would have been a bad accident, potentially a fatal one.

¬†

When I was on that holiday to Melbourne with my family, we were on a bus the day we left the car for the mirror repair. We were having difficulty settling Marcus, and a lady came over and prayed for my family and me Marcus settled down. We needed that intercessory prayer. She said that God told her to pray for us, so she did.

¬†

When my wife Jackie had a series of mini-strokes, and we already had two children, we were told that she had to go off the pill right then and that I would need a vasectomy as an operation to tie her tubes would have been too dangerous for Jackie to have as would another pregnancy and childbirth as she could die from either the operation, or from pregnancy or giving birth and so I went ahead with getting the vasectomy, and we had counselling. I wanted to keep Jackie safe, alive, and well, and we made the right decision about me getting the vasectomy. I got to keep my wife safe by getting the vasectomy and enabling Jackie to be still alive. Otherwise, I would have become a widower with small children.

¬†

After experiencing chest pain for a long time, months, and months, in mid-1999, I visited a doctor at the recommendation of my wife. X-rays, ultrasounds, and a biopsy showed that my thyroid gland had significantly enlarged and extended deep down into my chest cavity. It was pushing my oesophagus, windpipe out of the way, and my other organs. ¬†If it were not for my wife getting me to see the doctor, I would have died once the windpipe had fully closed because I could live without food for a while if my oesophagus had closed, but I cannot live without air if my windpipe had closed. Getting a hole put in my neck to use for breathing would not have worked for breathing as the windpipe and oesophagus were much lower down in my chest cavity where they were being squished. The surgeon was able to remove the thyroid through my neck as he was thinking at first of cracking open my ribcage to get at the thyroid from below it as it was deep, far down into my chest cavity, which would have had more risks and a more complicated period of recovery. Still, he was able to remove the thyroid through my neck and hide the scar in a skin fold. I got through the entire process of getting the medical and surgical help I needed.

¬†

When I was awaiting a phone call to find out if my thyroid was cancerous as I had had a biopsy and I was at work, a workmate told me that my wife was on the phone for me, and my wife Jackie said, ""There's no cancer"", and right then at that moment I felt two hands on my shoulders from behind me. I turned around to see who had touched me, and nobody was there; the nearest member of staff was three metres in front of me, and it was not her, yet I felt the hands on both of my shoulders; it was a physical touch as I did feel them.

¬†

When I saw a cat on TV that was twitching and moving while asleep, and it moved so much that it fell off the coffee table that it was lying on, and the commentator said the cat had REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder, I told my wife, ‚ÄúLook, that‚Äôs me.‚Äù I had been having dreams where I became active while dreaming instead of remaining passive, and I moved around and fell out of bed while fast asleep, which had happened several times. I went to the hospital and saw a sleep specialist, had a sleep study, and got diagnosed with REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder. The sleep doctor started talking about Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and my short-term memory issues. I watched a TV program I did not know was on as I was just channel surfing. It got me to make the connection between me and my sleeping behaviour and the cats and this led to a diagnosis of REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder.

¬†

When I had a shoulder ache, and it had been there for a long time, and I had not seen a doctor as I am a man, for it‚Äôll be right and the church we were attending, had for the first time in the years we had been going there, they have a visiting healer. I got to the front, sat on the chair, and didn't tell the healer what was wrong with me; he didn't ask. I got holy oil on my forehead, was prayed over with the laying on of hands, and returned to my seat. Then I got a burning circle of hotness, red hot, right where my shoulder had been hurting, and after a while, the burning sensation went away, and I realised that the shoulder pain had gone and did not come back.

¬†

When my eldest child Michelle was getting bullied at high school, and Jackie and I decided to take her out of that school system altogether, we contacted another school. We were nowhere near their catchment area. Yet, they accepted her, and she settled into the new school, and the bullying stopped; she got to make some strong friendships. Later, one of the bullies from the other school starts at our daughter‚Äôs new school, and our daughter is OK as she now has a circle of true friends who tell that bully to leave her alone as the bully tried to bully her again and the bullying is nipped in the bud.

¬†

When our church closed as it was not viable, we joined a new church where we settled, and Marcus was accepted by that church, even though he had special needs. Congregation members had been praying for someone like Marcus to come along, and Marcus went to the new church with us. We got into a new church suitable for all my family.

¬†

When I enter a competition, many times to win $1000, and the community organisation I nominate in the competition will win $10,000, I pray about it. I nominate our new church, and so on. For every entry, I nominate our new church. I did well over thirty entries. I won $1000, and our new church got the $10,000. The cheques were timely for our new church and us and were needed when the Global Financial Crisis was on.

¬†

When Marcus is in Year 11, his high school tries to get him to sign himself out, leave the school permanently, and not return for Year 12. It would have been a bad idea as the community participation program he would have done after schooling had finished for him was for special needs people after they finished Year 12, not Year 11. A place was found for him at a dedicated special needs school for Year 12, which he completed. It was the best year of schooling that he ever had. Marcus went to the new school, the best place for him.

¬†

We renewed our wedding vows on our 30th wedding anniversary, and we did so in front of our church congregation. This time, unlike when we were married, I got to kiss the bride, as I did not get to kiss my bride in our wedding ceremony thirty years before. We publicly show our commitment to each other by renewing one of the important vows possible.

¬†

When Marcus and I boarded a crowded train full of people, I almost lost hold of him while pulling him into the carriage. I would have left him behind. We kept together as if Marcus had been left alone on the platform; I do not know what would have happened to him.

¬†

In a thundering thunderstorm, when the wind and the rain were pouring down a lot, the eucalyptus tree in the backyard fell over and landed on top of our house. It was a widow-maker. I was in the bathroom underneath the tree, and I was safe, and Marcus was in the kitchen, and he was safe. Most of the tree's weight was in its trunk, and the trunk was in the backyard, with many branches on top of the house as far as the front main bedroom.

¬†

When I noticed symptoms that were happening to me, I didn't know what was wrong with me. I saw a neurologist. ‚ÄúYou have Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment,‚Äù and now I know what I‚Äôve got, I can get help and treatment for it. ¬†Now, my symptoms make sense to me, and the type of Mild Cognitive Impairment that I have doesn‚Äôt affect my long-term memory, only short-term memory and some of my power of thought. I got a diagnosis, and what the sleep specialist had talked about so many years before had come true as I ended up with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease.

¬†

My wife Jackie gave me the support and comfort that I needed after being diagnosed with a life-changing diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, and she continues to provide me with the support and comfort over the years before, during and after that diagnosis.

¬†

I drove through an intersection at 50 km per hour with a stop sign that I did not know was there. I did not think I was in an intersection, and I heard the car horn frantically blasting at me from another car as I should have stopped for them. I did not know they were there until they blasted their horn. I looked through my driver‚Äôs window, and all I could see was a car. It was getting closer and closer to us, and both drivers took evasive action, but I did not hit them. I should have stopped for them as they had the right of way. Our car did not roll with the manoeuvre I did, which was to turn the steering wheel hard to the left abruptly and then hard to the right to give us more room between our car and the other car. We missed the other car and the telegraph pole that the other driver thought we would hit after missing her car. She stops near our car, talks to us, and tells us she has her mum and her son in the car. I have my son and my wife, and if I had hit the other car, my family and I and her and her family might have been injured or died, with casualties in both cars. Still, I missed her and the telegraph pole.

¬†

After missing the car at the stop sign, I decided to stop driving that afternoon once I got home, and shortly after that, my neurologist and my GP forbade me from driving. I know they're both right anyway. I‚Äôve already stopped driving as I know I‚Äôm a dangerous driver, driving dangerously on the road. I‚Äôm thankful they and I made the right decision to stop driving. I realised my driving days were over and getting me to accept that fact without second thoughts.

¬†

When I got into the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) on my third attempt at getting accepted into the NDIS, sometimes, God said, ‚ÄòWait.‚Äô Now, I can get the help that I need for my Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment from the NDIS. I got in with perfect timing onto the system when I was prepared for it,

¬†

After my diagnosis of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, my wife and I decided that as I worsened, as that was likely to happen, she wouldn‚Äôt be able to look after Marcus and me, so we made the decision to find Marcus‚Äôs accommodation in a supported independent living share house as he‚Äôs special needs. A place is found for him, and he loves it. We know that after we die, Marcus will be looked after as he is in the system, and we made the right decision for his short-term and long-term living needs.

¬†

When I was in the hospital with Septic Shock because of a nasty bacterial infection from a bacteria called Proteus mirabilis, which is found in soil and potting mix, and I was a gardener as a hobby, I got blood poisoning. I was on life support and in a coma for three days and three nights. My heart was enlarged, my kidneys had shut down, a kidney stone blocked one of the ureters from one of my kidneys, I had blood poisoning, both of my lungs had been infected with that nasty bacterium, and I was on dialysis. My brain is in la-la-land as I have delirium, and the delirium persists well after I am brought out of the coma, as the delirium lasts for more than a week. I‚Äôm contagious with the bacteria, and I‚Äôm in ICU for ten days in a private room as I‚Äôm in isolation; visitors must put on disposable clothes, gloves, and a face mask to come into my room and then dispose of the clothing when they leave my room.

¬†

After the time I spent in the ICU, I was put in the general ward. I come through the whole lot OK without losing a hand or a foot or anything else to sepsis, as many people who end up with sepsis need to have their limbs amputated. As that part of them dies, or they die. For five thousand people a year, for approximately five thousand people die from sepsis in Australia. I got over the delirium, and I still remember the thoughts that I had while delirious. My wife Jackie was there with me for every one of those sixteen days that I was in the hospital, and she had to catch four buses a day to get in to see me and then go home, two each way. I got through sepsis and kept my body intact, and my wife was there every day for me.

¬†

Before finding out that I had blood poisoning and sepsis, I had pain. I went to the hospital earlier in the week, where they took blood, with the result that they were able to culture it and identify the specific bacteria that had infected me, so they didn‚Äôt have to hit it with a broad-spectrum drug and hope for the best but knew exactly what treatment and drug I would need. They stressed how urgent it was that I came back to the hospital for treatment, and I was in the operating theatre that night.

¬†

When I was getting a regular skin cancer check, the skin cancer specialist found a basal cell carcinoma on my nose that I did not know was there. He can remove all the skin cancer, and it is good that he got it all, as otherwise it would eat down through my nose and get bigger, resulting in complex facial surgery and reconstruction. I did not need a more complicated operation to catch and get rid of the skin cancer in time before it got worse.

¬†

I went on a cruise with my dad, just the two of us, on the Majestic Princess down to Tasmania from Sydney and back again, and we had a suite. It was just before COVID-19 entered the world when Dad could still get around, even though he was in his eighties, and we had a wonderful time together. We got time together that we usually would not have before he passed away a couple of years later.

After visiting my father, who was in a hospital at the time, during the COVID era, I was the one nominated visitor that he could have at the hospital and on my way back to the railway station, I hurried across a road with an active Don't Walk sign flashing on the traffic light crossing. I should not have been crossing the road as the Don't Walk had started flashing, and I fell onto the road in front of a bus. I do not know if the bus driver saw me go down. I was able to pick myself up off the ground and hobble away. I only hurt my elbow, and my shoe came off. Fortunately, the red arrow for the bus stayed red while I was on the crossing. I were still on the ground in front of the bus, if the red arrow had changed, the bus could have started moving right on top of me, running over me while I was on the ground. A woman on the opposite side of the road also called me to see if I was OK.

¬†

Also, on another day, when we travelled home by bus, I was carrying two shopping bags in each hand. I could not hold the seat next to me or the hand straps hanging down from the ceiling as I did not think of putting the bags down; anyway, there was not enough room in the bus for me to put them down. I tried to keep myself upright, and as the bus moved away from the bus stop, I lost my balance and started to fall onto a mother and her pram that had two babies in it. I was falling, and I could not do anything to stop myself. The pram was getting closer as I fell, and a woman sitting on the seat behind me managed to grab hold of me by my belt near my bottom and my shoulder. She pulled me upright before I landed on top of the two babies and their mum. I am not a light person as I am obese, yet she found the strength to pull me upright and the room in the bus to get to me before it was too late, and then someone offered me their seat after my fall.

¬†

My father, Bruce, passed away, and we had a funeral for him. Shortly after the funeral, we were allowed into his unit to clear it out, as Mum had passed away several years before Dad. I found out that Dad had kept many of the birthday, Christmas, and Father‚Äôs Day cards that we had given him as children, and they were in his bedside cabinet, and I had worn his wedding ring from the day of his death. I was shown how sentimental Dad was, as I did not expect him to be so sappy.

¬†

When Marcus, our special needs son, decided to leave his group house where he was living and went without telling the staff, and no one went with him, he got on a bus at Baulkham Hills and travelled to Rouse Hill, which was the last stop for the bus, by himself. We were on holiday in Hobart in another state, and the police contacted us; after that call, we could track where Marcus went by using his Opal public transport card, as Marcus knew how to tap on and off his Opal card. Opal allowed us to track his trip movements, and we rang the police and the house staff to tell them both what we had found out from Opal and the house staff. The police found him at Rouse Hill Shopping Centre. They heard him before they saw him, and Marcus talked loudly to himself. They turned around a corner at the shops, and there he was. Rouse Hill Shops is not your standard type of shopping centre, as it is spread over a large area instead of confined under one roof. Marcus was safe and able to be found by the police and the house staff.

Years after my father died, my wife, Jackie, stepped on an old answering machine that we were no longer using as we are on the NBN and a home phone is not needed; it‚Äôs on the floor, and a message is on it, and it starts playing, and the message is from my deceased father, recorded by him whilst he was alive. We did not know the message was on it. In the message, my dad tells me not to worry about anything and that he loves me. I now realise that I was meant to hear it when I needed to and recorded it on my computer. Now, I can listen to my dad whenever I need to or want to, even though after listening to him, I realise how much I miss him, and sometimes I am overcome by emotion, for I‚Äôm still grieving for him for I have lost a piece of my heart. It has been four years since he died, but I am not going to delete the recording as my dad is on it. It pains me that after Mum died, I was not enough to keep him alive and nor were the rest of my siblings, as all he wanted was to be with Mum. he had lost his will to live, and he had stopped eating, and now he is with Mum. We discovered the phone call when I needed to with the words of comfort on it from Dad, which are helping me in my grieving process.

¬†

When Jackie passed out and was in a diabetic coma last Mother‚Äôs Day at Featherdale Wildlife Park, the 000 operator gave us her full attention. The first aid staff from Featherdale looked after Jackie whilst we were waiting for the ambulance, and the ambulance came. Jackie was not in a coma once they arrived at Featherdale; she was taken to the hospital for observation and admitted to the hospital. As a result of the diabetic coma and hospital admission, Jackie started testing herself for the sugar readings for her diabetes and looking after herself and her diabetes better. Jackie was stirred into action regarding her diabetes.

¬†

A couple of weeks ago, a stray cat turned up on our doorstep and stayed, and he had no collar and no microchip. Jackie named him Max, and we have fallen in love with him. We got a chance to look after another cat and share our family and our home with him, and we have all fallen in love with Max,

¬†

In early February 2025, I made a new friend, Patrick, whom I call my little brother from another mother. Although taller than me, he is far younger and a Christian. I told him I only had one person to talk to: my wife, Jackie. Patrick gave me his phone number and said I could call him. Here is to a long friendship with Patrick. I now have a friend I can call when I want to talk to a friend.

¬†

This year, I am using support workers to take me to medical appointments and for social activities, which is something new for me as I used to spend most of my time at home alone. I‚Äôm getting out of the house and interacting with more people than I usually would.

¬†

In all that has happened to my family and me, God has always been there for us in the good times and the tough times. He has protected us over all the instances where we felt his Glory by God looking after us mentally, spiritually, physically, emotionally, financially, in times of illness and poor health, and in dangerous times on the road. God was always there in every situation, especially the ones that could have resulted in injury or death, for I am not so lucky to have all the things that have happened to me and my family by chance, instead it was all planned. ¬†God gave me a wife, Jackie, who has always been there for me and my children, and for her; I am profoundly grateful to God for eternity long and then some for finding me a wife who loves me, and I love her.

For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. Jeremiah 29:11.

I live near the Lincoln Park campus and am looking to get rid of some of my stuff. Pick up is possible today/tomorrow or can deliver it to you (aside from the couch, I would need you to help me transport).

Large gray sectional with reversible chaise - $600
Good for 2-3 people (way too big for me), matches a lot of furniture. Have only owned for 2 years. Very comfy and also good for sleeping on. Would fit someone over 6 foot.

Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon with 2 sets of chargers - $600
Great working condition and extremely lightweight. I bring this to coffee shops all the time and it‚Äôs the perfect size for small spaces. If you have a laptop to swap for it I could knock the price down a bit as I‚Äôll be buying a cheaper laptop regardless anyway.

Rolling cart - $30
An upright cart for groceries. I prefer my granny cart for large hauls, but this one is cute and easier to store. Would be perfect for groceries and clothes shopping.

Rolling luggage set - $45
Solid black rolling luggage. One is a larger size and the other is a smaller size. Not flashy but gets the job done. If you only want one piece I can give you the price for just one.

A whole bunch of other random items - can price by item
Clothes, bags, earrings, space heater, fan, if you have something you need let me know and maybe I have it. 

It‚Äôs a little unconventional, but since I‚Äôm so close by, you‚Äôre also welcome to just come through and see what I have that you might want! Really just trying to downsize some of my stuff. Most of my women‚Äôs clothing items are size M-XL and shoe size 9.5-10.

1j0mwnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1j0mwnr/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

You blinked, shaking it off. Just fatigue, maybe. You reached for your coffee, but before you could take a sip, your screen lit up with an urgent directive.

I‚Äôll leave this woman‚Äôs order below. My coworkers before me named this woman ‚Äúwhite mocha lady‚Äù I always thought they were just a bit rude. sure, a bit of a complicated order but we get a good amount of those. For my first few weeks I didn‚Äôt make her drink as she liked it a very specific way. Fast forward about seven months and I‚Äôm one of the oldest employees as everyone quits our location (soon to be me) I realized very quickly I severely underestimated this woman. She will take her drink(s!!!) say thank you, walk away and come back within about 15 minutes because her drink is too sweet, not enough coffee flavor, not the right color, not the right texture (valid tbh), too cold, not cold enough, more syrup needed, less syrup. The worst part is she tries to act nice about it by being like ‚Äúyou can put these back in the blender and re blend it with (enter syrup, shots, frapp roast etc.)‚Äù but we can‚Äôt put already drank drinks in the blender?? That‚Äôs disgusting. 

ORDER- So we have to remake: (PER DRINK) two venti white mocha frappes, nonfat milk, shot of espresso, seven pumps white mocha, extra frapp roast (for color) whipped cream. 

In all honesty the drink is not awful to make but she has been banned from the two other Starbucks within a the area because someone will make her drink to a tea and she insists it‚Äôs wrong every time. We batch blend at my location and by the time all the syrup is in it‚Äôs about an inch or two of pure syrup in the blender and there‚Äôs a whole third venti leftover essentially. Not to mention she puts three straws in each drink rather than grab a single boba straw we have right out? 

Our new lead SUCKS. (For many reasons I could share if you guys want the tea) and insists we make her drink however many times needed and we can‚Äôt charge her for the extra syrup bc white mocha frapp already gets white mocha and it only counts as extra syrup if she were to ask for a different flavor ???

We had a great connection when we were friends, many shared interests and this tendency where we just got each other. We never flirted or touched, but I think there was some unspoken sexual tension that we both pretended didn't exist, because he was in a relationship and I was seeing another guy. This friend was very kind to me, and did a lot of nice things that I'd typically expect a long-time friend to do and I almost thought we were both developing feelings for each other. 

He ghosted me out of the blue at the time and then said he doesn't have the time to be my friend(!!) We didn't talk for a long time, like 10 months and then he suddenly emailed me apologizing and wanting to reconnect. I was surprised, we met over coffee. He said he had broken up with his gf, because they wanted different things and long distance wasn't working for them anymore (they were together for 2 years, long distance for 1 year) 

He said he cut me off at the time because he had developed strong feeling for me, and he felt guilty and then his gf sensed his attraction to me and asked him to cut me off. He stayed in the relationship because he was committed to her and didn't wanna leave, he also hoped this would be a passing crush. He's saying the feelings never went away, and that in hindsight, he had fallen for me the first time we met, he suppressed it to honor his relationship. He asked me if I'd be willing to give him a chance now. I like this guy, and I know he is not a bad person, but I'm seeing some red flags: nurturing a crush while in a relationship, staying in a relationship despite knowing he's fallen out of love, ghosting a good friend without communicating etc.

I know exactly what you are going through, and reading your post was like reading an entry from my own journal! I have been married to my husband for 37 years, I (60F) accidentally stumbled upon his (59M) secret last August. 

It was all quite innocent in that I entered a spare bedroom looking for something that I knew I had purchased and did not want to purchase again. Some back history, my husband is also a compulsive spender who jumps from hobby to hobby, so to accommodate the 60+ guitars and amps, one of our spare rooms was turned into a music room. Another, plus our formal living room and garage housed hundreds of sets of golf clubs, bags of putters, etc. yes in his teens and twenties he was in a locally renown rock band and has always had a passion for golf, but not even professional musicians have the equipment he has (Orange and Marshall stacks from floor to ceiling), guitars that are valued from $2k to $10k each and he has over 60, same with Pro Golfers and his hoard of golf equipment. We can‚Äôt forget about all the guns he owns too! They are stashed all over the house, hidden in books, we have multiple gun safes, bug out bags stashed in closets all over the house! Probably 50+ guns not to mention guns in vehicles too.

I had started to feel like I was being forced out of my own home as his collectibles were taking over. If he needed more room, he didn‚Äôt think twice about moving my stuff and literally dumping it into another room! Our sex life had been nearly non existent for 12+ years, we are talking years between occurrences of intimacy and in total, occurrences during this period can be counted on one hand. 

Over the years my self esteem was shot to hell. Between his ED (which I always felt was psychological), the durations where he could barely acknowledge my existence, the compulsive spending, excessive drinking, and so much other stuff, I really wanted to move on and just start my life over. There is a lot more history to his background, childhood trauma, addictive behaviors, etc. just a never ending cycle of baggage on his behalf. While I always stood by him and supported him as my spouse and the father of my child.

During COVID, I went from traveling weekly for work to working from home. The packages arriving daily were never ending. I have never been one to open packages or mail not addressed to me, I never entered rooms where he kept his stuff, as I have always believed everyone has a right to privacy. I never looked through his phone, iPad or computer. I am loyal and trusting‚Ä¶obviously to a fault. 

There were days when Amazon would drop 30+ packages off and the Ring camera would be catching me cursing up a storm regarding his spending habits and all the shit he was buying while I hauled that crap off the porch. I should also say that the mass deliveries were almost daily. I would drag that crap in and pile it on the front stairs in the entry, which we never use as we have multiple staircases to the upper floor of our house. There would be an occasion where Amazon would ship in clear packages and I would question what the hell did he need a pink fishnet bodysuit for, or something of similarity! He would claim that Amazon messed up and obviously shipped the wrong item and he would have to return it. I had no reason to doubt what he was saying, but did grow suspicious that it happened more than a time or two. But when you buy as much as he did, you have higher odds of that happening more often, right??

I regress, back to how I stumbled upon his secret. As I said he would just throw my belongings around and I was tired of spending the money to repurchase things I knew I owned but could not find due to his disrespect for my belongings. 

Last August I decided that was going to stop, so I was searching in one of the spare bedrooms and moved some duffle bags off a bin so I could look in the bin for a box containing two tubes of some French skin care cream. When he realized I was in one of ‚Äúhis‚Äù rooms going through stuff he came flying in there and started yelling at me to get out. I said ‚Äúgive me a second, I am looking for something of mine that you have moved around and I need to find it.‚Äù I opened the bin which I knew contained back-up hair and skin care products, looked around and didn‚Äôt see what I was looking for. I put the lid back on, and started to put the duffle bags back on top of the bin. I picked up the last one and noticed his reaction, his eyes got big and panicky, and his face turned red with veins starting to bulge in his forehead and neck. I was like ‚Äúwhat the hell is your problem‚Äù and he came at me almost violently to grab that bag. 

I knew I hit a nerve and I pulled it back and ripped the zipper open. At first when I saw clothes I thought, ‚ÄúOMG did I use this for one of my trips and put my dirty clothes in it and forget to unpack and wash them?‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt until I started pulling stuff out that I realized I didn‚Äôt recognize the clothes and I don‚Äôt wear anything tacky and slutty like I was pulling out of the bag! 

Then I found dildos and lube in the bag. I dropped the bag in disgust but thought the items belonged to a girlfriend he must have been hiding from me. I should say there were times I would find underwear and slutty clothes left lying around upstairs, and one time found a bottle of lube. I thought he had a GF that came over during my travels for work, and I had noticed a change in his attitude during COVID and then when I changed jobs afterward, the new job didn‚Äôt have me traveling weekly like my old job. It was during this time I felt like he hated me and despised the fact that I was spending more time at home. When I found miscellaneous stuff I threw it away and would say ‚ÄúFuck You, you stupid little motherfucker, your girlfriend lacks taste, class and any level of sophistication‚Äù! In my mind I was planning to start setting myself up for divorce, but would ride out as long as I could in the current situation.

Back to the night last August, I asked if he had a GF, and that all these years of ED was because he no longer desired me?? For years I felt it was my income that he desired more than me. Together we live very well financially. He said no that the clothes and toys were his, I thought he was lying and then he told me that it was a maladaptive behavior that developed at around the age of 8, and he struggled with it off and on throughout HS, and claimed he went 30+ years without any issue until around 2019. He said that he started crossdressing again and masturbating while dressed as a woman. So immediately I replied that he ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt get it up for me but he could not only get it up dressed as a woman but could masturbate to completion.‚Äù Wow, that made me feel even more like some undesirable hag! 

To interject here, I am tall and very shapely built with naturally large breasts, long legs, and have aged extremely well (great skincare and sunscreen)! Most of the time I am mistaken for being 10-15 years younger than I am. I also work in a male dominated field and have a reputation of knowing more and being better at my job than my male counterparts. I get a lot of attention going out and have even had many offers from men in my field wanting to have passionate affairs. Again, I am loyal to a fault and have never broken my marriage vows. Most of the time I dress very low key, jeans, t-shirts and sneakers but I do know that I clean up well and can turn more than a couple of heads when I dress to go out.

After he confessed, he goes to bed and immediately falls asleep. I went to the master bathroom toilet closet and cried by myself for hours. I finally pulled myself together, went downstairs and grabbed his iPad. I started looking through his Amazon purchases, and was disgusted by the amount of sex toys (including a trans woman ‚ÄúSheMale‚Äù sex doll and sex/ramming machine). He had hundreds upon hundreds of orders for dresses, skirts, skorts, tennis skirts, costumes like Catholic School Girl outfits, a Sailor Moon Costume, gafs, shapewear, lingerie, body suits, shoes, purses, belts, jewelry, wigs, the list goes on and on. He wasn‚Äôt just shopping Amazon, he was shopping online from all major stores, some tweeny stores like Forever 21, Victoria Secret, and spending more for his lingerie and panties than he EVER spent on anything he purchased for me. 

I went upstairs and woke his ass up with iPad in hand, and demanded to see his curated wardrobe that he obviously spent tens of thousands of dollars curating for his cross dressing play. He took me to the closet in one of our spare rooms where he had hid stuff. He had plastic drawers hiding under long coats and dresses hanging under coats and jackets. He had women‚Äôs shoes in men‚Äôs shoe boxes. But what floored me was the time and care he took to create this closet. When I opened the drawers, shorts, skirts, panties were all so carefully folded, everything was color arranged from dark to light. I wanted to throw up. He has never in his life taken care of his regular clothes in that manner, he would take off his shoes and throw them in a pile in the closet. He would step out of clothes and leave them laying on the floor and just walk on them, but this crap was lovingly cared for. 

I could write a book just in what transpired over the next few days. I will say that he immediately locked down any access to his electronics, he signed out of all accounts and changed passwords. When I realized this I demanded he write down passwords to his email and Amazon. I left the house and went to a coffee shop and for hours I went through and took screen shots of emails, orders for all his crap, including the trans sex doll and sex machine. I also found that pleasure toy hidden in a box that was taped up and on a shelf in the garage.  I took pictures of it before packing it back up and leaving it in a box on the porch after I demanded he move out. I took all the pictures and filed them away in a photo vault app, that is secure so that he cannot break into my cloud account and delete pictures. The breaking point for me was not only the lies and betrayal, but the financial infidelity. We had to declare bankruptcy earlier in our marriage because of his overspending. At the time we didn‚Äôt make a quarter of what we make now, I have always had to work full time and always had to make more money than he did to be able to live and raise our child in what I considered a middle class lifestyle. I grew up in middle class, he grew up in a snobby family with a grandmother that bragged about her family history and their upper class Boston heritage. I would joke that he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and I had a plastic spoon in mine! I knew I married a manchild and always said that I raised two but only gave birth to one! 

Again, I regress. While I was going through his emails I came across loan documents and realized he had taken out a huge loan! I also found where he applied for his passport. That was my breaking point. The betrayal had cut me to the bone. At this point I was three days of running on caffeine, no sleep and no food! Earlier in the day I had went to my doctor, also his doctor and just broke down. I told him I felt like I was having a nervous breakdown and I needed help. This was before finding the emails about the LARGE loan and passport. He prescribed two different anxiety meds and told me to not hesitate if I needed meds to help me sleep, or anything else. I unloaded and told him EVERYTHING, he already knew about the ED and some other issues. He kept assuring me that this was all his issue and had nothing to do with me. Unfortunately, the scripts were filled and I received the text about 5 minutes before they were due to close and knew I wouldn‚Äôt get there in time. I knew it was going to be another sleepless night. At this point he had moved out of the master bedroom into one of the guest rooms, I had been asking him to do so to give me space while I processed everything. He refused to talk to me, answer my questions and of course tried blaming me for his problem. Typical narcissistic behaviors.

That night is when I found the loan documents and passport application. I printed them off and stormed upstairs demanding answers. Was he leaving the country for a sex change or what? How did this loan affect my credit, did he borrow against my home? I lost it and went over the edge. He kept telling me that he was trying to surprise me for my 60th birthday and wanted to take me on a Viking Cruise down the Thames and to spend a month touring Europe, etc. I looked at him and said ‚Äúhow fucking dumb do you think I am, in order for that lie to hold water I would need to renew my passport since it expired during Covid and it takes about 6 months to get that done!‚Äù That was August and my birthday is in January. 

He had purged and allegedly taken clothes to Goodwill, but his expensive panties, bras, lingerie, and other intimates were bagged and in our trash. Along with a collection of dildos, vibrators, masturbaters, and make-up. I went downstairs, dumped the trash cans over in the driveway and ripped open the bags. I then ran/skipped down our street/sidewalks throwing his stuff all over our yard and surrounding neighbors yards. There was lingerie and intimates hanging from trees, dildos and masturbaters stuck in shrubs. It was a sight to behold. I was laughing and singing all the while, quite funny when I looked at our own security footage! I can‚Äôt imagine what the neighbors thought. Afterwards I went back into the house and told him that the neighborhood knew of his secret, that it was littered all over the neighborhood. He quietly got out of bed, got dressed and walked around picking up what he could find by streetlight and flashlight. When he came back in I told him to get the fuck out of my house. I have to admit that I showered and slept pretty solidly the rest of the night. That breakdown was therapeutic for me. The following morning I apologized to neighbors and went around with garbage bag in hand getting the items he missed in the dark.

Where does all of this stand now?? He has an apartment, and has been in and out of therapy. I believe he manipulated the first therapist into an ally and had taken total control of where the therapy was headed and what they talked about from week to week. No tough subjects were discussed and it turned from therapy into a weekly chat/gab session where she discussed her marital problems with him and he claimed regret for everything he did to me. Yawn! I asked if I could attend a session to make sure issues were being addressed, and he suddenly decided she was not the right therapist. Okay then, I suggested he go to one with LGQB+ experience and to find one through one of their community resource websites. He is now seeing a therapist via ‚Äúvideo conference‚Äù that is mtf trans and after a month states that she isn‚Äôt the right therapist either. I asked why and he said that all he is doing is talking, yeah that is what therapy is about! He said that he is uncomfortable, why‚Ä¶because she is asking questions that hit a little too close to home?? I believe this to be true, and that he is uncomfortable with some of the self realizations being uncovered. That and I truly believe he is afraid that she may be trying to brain wash him to ‚Äújoin her cult‚Äù or is transphobic! 

Bottom line is when he moved out I started talking to divorce lawyers, and I found one that I planned to hire and move forward to dissolve our marriage. He asked me to wait for a year so that he could get his shit straight, he was going to work on himself and get his head right. I told him that it would also need to include relationship and family counseling as well, because I feel betrayed, disgusted, and he has lost my trust. Our son knows his secret, and he no longer wants anything to do with him, he too feels betrayed and feels like we don‚Äôt know who this man really is!! 

I also said that if I agreed, I could not guarantee that I would want to stay married to him regardless of how much he worked on himself. That I too am going to start therapy and I may very well decide that I don‚Äôt want to be married to anyone after the lies, betrayal, hurt, and everything else he has put me through. Again, he has flipped therapists and I can‚Äôt see any real progress, six months have ticked away and there are less than 6 more until the one year mark. I think he is putting in minimal effort and will relapse again and again. Through the duration of our marriage, he has traded one addiction for another, all of which I think were ways to repress his AGP desires. Part of me thinks that when his mother dies, he will begin the process of transition. That the shame he feels for wanting to do it while she is alive is too much and that he will find the courage to move forward after she passes. I have asked him and he gaslights and stone walls me, refusing to answer and then walks away. Just the same thing he did when all this came out in August.

There are a lot of things that I am open to, and I have always kinda lived by ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try anything once, maybe twice if it doesn‚Äôt kill me the first time!‚Äù But I have to draw the line here. I am not into women or men dressed like women. I told him that he needs to be honest with himself so he can be honest in therapy and get the right help if he truly wants to be helped. I, of course, would have rather he told me of his cross dressing/AGP play, than to find out in the manner I did. I also told him that if he is gay, he needs to be true to himself. If he had been honest and come to me with this I would have been more supportive. At this point he is expressing his femininity in small ways, and I support that. I will support him to a point in anyway I can, and would support transition, but will not stay married to him if he goes that route. Honestly I don‚Äôt know if I want to stay married to him after experiencing all of this, even if he were to completely reform and never touch women‚Äôs clothes again. The thought of him in women‚Äôs clothes is a huge turnoff, I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶I just can‚Äôt! 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too much to desire a normal marriage with a normal man. I want a masculine man that desires to be with me, not be turned on by the image of himself dressed as a woman while shoving a dildo up his butt. I want a man to worship me and put me on a pedestal, one that wants to take care of me, not be taken care of. Do these men even exist anymore?? Please tell me where to find them, I need one stat!!

Please know that you are justified in what you feel, there are so many more of us out there going through the same thing. I am so happy that I recently found this group and that we can openly discuss how we feel. Part of me wishes it was a closed group, but I guess that is what our user names are for, to protect our innocence! The other part hopes that he finds this and the blood drains from his face as he reads through my side of the story and how this has not only hurt me but how devastated I am. 

I don‚Äôt know why these men can‚Äôt think beyond their sick desire to dress up, why they can‚Äôt think about who they are hurting in the process and what is going to happen if their secret comes out, but the narcissism in them encourages the behavior like it‚Äôs a reward for having a good life with a wife and children who love them. I just don‚Äôt get it. I guess the saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs all fun and games until somebody gets hurt‚Äù applies, unfortunately we are the ones getting hurt! ",1,1740788940.0,crossdressers_wives,0,1.0,False
1j0mr7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee/comments/1j0mr7w/my_2_cents_on_this_game/,My 2 cents on this game,"What I love about the game:

- The graphics are gorgeous, music is caf√© vibey, characters are cute, and the coffee making process is therapeutic! The storyline seems interesting, although I am still in the early stages of the game.
- For the people saying the coffee making process is too slow compared to GPGP: This game is actually more complex than GPGP (especially in terms of equipment upgrades). So, you need to keep on playing to make money for the upgrades, and also look into each tab (especially the equipment section) in order to get faster machinery. The in-game days do get longer after the first few in-game days.
- I can see that the devs put in a lot of effort to make the game challenging and fun ‚ù§Ô∏è

What could be improved:
- The game has no pause option yet, even during the CNS ad time. I turned on an ad to get a gem, left it on, and came back after a while, and the in-game day was already at 7PM haha. The customer's happiness meter was at 11% üò≠üòÇ

- It would be better if we could simultaneously touch two places of the working station at once. I want to be able to steam the milk and stop the espresso shot at the same time. That would save more time! Idk if it's just me, but that hasn't been working so well atm.

- More clear explanation on what each of the icons and items mean (e.g. the coffee cup looking yellow item) would be nice!

- Auto-buddies for certain things, like milk steaming!

- A function to watch ads to earn more gems. Right now, the only way to earn free gems is the 1 gem ad after the CNS news, and occasionally level up items.

1j0mn9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1j0mn9c/my_claude_code_review/,My Claude Code Review,"Hey all, I know that Claude Sonnet 3.7 isn't a ""local"" model and its not a LLaMa, but a lot of people here like to use GenAI for coding. I'm sure many of you would find this interesting.  
  
BACKGROUND  
I got access to Claude Code and tried it out on a small hobby project I've been working for 2 months. I downloaded Claude Code npm package onto my WSL2 and added Bedrock API keys. My AWS account doesn't have Prompt Caching, so I had to disable that functionality. I realize that this could be the reason my costs are high.

PROJECT and TASK  
The project is a combination of a website, db code, nextjs, react frontend. And some python tools that perform backend jobs. I created many python scripts for testing and wanted to consolidate them into a unified solution. I created a manager script that runs each task asynchronously. I asked Claude Code to familiarize itself with my project and create proper packages in my subfolders by creating \_\_init\_\_.py, fixing up references and making sure everything works.

COST  
The cost to initialize my project was $2.60. It took about 3 minutes.  
The cost to run the task was $6.51. It took about 10 minutes.

RESULTS  
In the end, Claude Code made many changes to my files. It messed up the formatting of the modified files by adding extra new lines (This could be because it works from Ubuntu WSL, and I am looking at my files in Windows). Also, in the end one out of my four my packages got broken. Took me 3 minutes to figure out what's broken. Otherwise it did succeed at doing the boring work of creating \_\_init\_\_.py files in the right places and fixing up references all over the code and even configuration files.

CONCLUSION  
This is a really cool toy, but I won't be using it for now in my team.  
  
The cost: its a little too much. I could have done the same thing in shorter amount of time by asking Sonnet 3.7 or even my local QwQ to rewrite some references. In the end I would have been able to do it faster. But then I'd go get some coffee, check reddit reply notifications and check the breaking news. An average developer costs $50-150 an hour, and this tool can potentially save some money. But human developers are much more versatile. They take longer to familiarize themselves with a project, but then they can work on projects of any size. They know exactly where to make changes and ignore other parts of the solution. 

Control: I dont like how Claude ruined my formatting. I can also see how using this tool too much can cause you to lose ""control"" and expert understanding of your project. When a real complex issue occurs, you need to understand how everything works and often times current AI is not able to do that.

In summary, I think this tool is neat. Its definitely going to get better and I can totally see how in a few years it will start replacing many developers. But at this point, I don't see it replacing even junior developers on a large production project.",0,1740788555.0,LocalLLaMA,0,0.17,False

I‚Äôll try my best to be neutral although obviously you‚Äôre only getting my POV here.

TW : Please do not read if you‚Äôre uncomfortable with the mention of depression and take care of yourself!

P.S English is not my first language, please don‚Äôt mind grammatical mistakes.

In freshman year of high school I started hanging out with the rich popular girl who, as she liked to say ¬´¬†took me under her wing¬†¬ª (because in middle school i was a BTS fan who had a girlfriend so I was considered a weird lesbian dork by most of my peers) and I slowly started being part of her band and becoming less of a looser.

Rachel could be pretty possessive sometimes or mean for no reason but overall she was a good friend to me. We rapidly formed a group of 6 girls : Rachel and I, Regina and her three best friends : Carmen, Leela and Violet

Fast forward the end summer from sophomore year to junior year, Rachel and I argue over something that didn‚Äôt matter to me but mattered a lot to her (we hated the people we had classes with and both wanted to change our class so we could be together with new people, my dad contacted the school while I was at Violet‚Äôs house and Rachel was abroad, I told her as soon as I knew and she ended not being able to be with me and stopped talking to me over it, (which I can understand was not nice to do but please bear with me here).

On Monday, we come back to school, and turns out the entire friend group is giving me weird vibes (like acting normal but I could tell something was off, mind you we had just spent the entire summer together at Rachel‚Äôs summer house together, those girls were my best friends).

My birthday was a few days after back to school that year, on a Friday. After the first day of school, our friend group + some other friends and went for a coffee, and my best friend told everyone that she was organizing a party on that very Friday, and that everyone (so all my friends) was invited (knowing that it was my birthday and obviously I was not invited).

I know I‚Äôm going to sound really conceited, but for some reason I hoped that she was organizing something for me, that the beef was over, but obviously since I‚Äôm writing this, yk that‚Äôs not what happened.

I went home crying, and ended up celebrating my 16th birthday at the bar getting pissed drunk with my girlfriend from middle school (who saved my live and that I could never thank the Universe enough for putting her on my path).  I sent them some snaps during that night, but overall they really gave 0 f.

The following week, one day time during lunch, I invited over Leela for lunch time at my place since my dad lives next to my school. (Leela was the only one who wasn‚Äôt acting weird with me, and we had AP classes together).

That day my best friend Rachel had no one to eat lunch with, so although she was giving me the cold shoulder and did me dirty, I still told her to come eat lunch at my house with Leela because, even though we argued, I thought we were still best friends you know ? I wouldn‚Äôt want to let her eat lunch on her own.

The following day, a guy I had been best friends with in middle school comes up to me, and tells me the other girls from my friend group, who ate lunch at school that day, were talking crap about me, and he overheard them (nothing crazy, stuff like ¬´¬†she‚Äôs kind of a bth¬†¬ª ¬´¬†she‚Äôs really annoying¬†¬ª ¬´¬†can‚Äôt stand her¬†¬ª) but it was really hurtful because I genuinely considered those girls to be my best friends yk ?

Now you ask me ¬´¬†Why would you believe that¬†¬ª you have to understand that I was hanging out with THE popular girls like in mean girls, it really wasn‚Äôt in that guy‚Äôs interest to come up to me and tell me that, especially since he begged me no to say anything to them, he was especially afraid of Regina aka the queen bee of the group.

I can‚Äôt quite remember but I think I just cried for two days and then I just went up to them, and (because I just HATE conflict) told them ¬´¬†Listen, I know you guys talk shit about me, please don‚Äôt deny it, I don‚Äôt even want to argue, I truly loved being friends with you guys but I think we should go our own ways¬†¬ª.

For some lore, Regina had shared with me that because she wasn‚Äôt as rich as the other girls from our friend group,she was super insecure about her house and stuff (she was confortable sharing that with me because middle class, I‚Äôve been very poor before and I‚Äôve always been very honest about it, whereas she would lie about owning designer and stuff, but I never judged her for that because social pressure can be crazy).

Anyways she was pretty mean but sooo good at hiding it, yk those girls that preach about positivity and tell you they want to be therapists because they want to help people ? Yeah the devil reincarnated.

Anyways after I told them I didn‚Äôt want to be friends with them anymore, Regina came up to me with her entire friend group (like literally 15 girls) and confronted me about the whole situation, trying to get who told me who overheard them talking crap about me ect..

After that, Carmen and Violet  came up to me and apologized (which was the only apology I‚Äôve ever gotten lol) and told me that ¬´¬†We know what we did and we wanted to apologize for hurting you in any way¬†¬ª which really moved me because they seemed genuinely sorry and sad.

Now coming by to my best friend, I thought a lot about apologizing to her at this point, I was alone and I felt like I had done her wrong, and I could see that she wanted me to apologize, but the thing is I felt betrayed , because she was still hanging out with Regina after what she had done to me. I may have done her wrong, but she was sad with friends, and I was sad on my own, so I felt like if she just didn‚Äôt care enough to check on me, even if we had argued, she wasn‚Äôt a good friend and I should just make new ones.

I had most of my classes with Paul, who I knew from the 6th grade and is actually the funniest guy I know, which is really something that I needed. We would hang out, and I eventually met Clara, who today is my best friend and who also saved my life. In December, Clara organized a dinner party at a restaurant for her birthday, and I was so happy that she had invited me because that affirmed our friendship and I was so happy to make new friends at this point.

During that dinner, I was sat down next to a super nice girl (Ava), and because obviously the entire school was talking about the fact that I wasn‚Äôt friends with the popular girls anymore, she asks me about it and I give her my side of the story. That‚Äôs when she says ¬´¬†Oh yeah they had been talking crap about you for a while yk ? One time I was with you guys, and when you left Regina immediately started saying you were such a bword , but I couldn‚Äôt tell you, we weren‚Äôt friends so you would never have believed me¬†¬ª. Now she was right, I wouldn‚Äôt have because that specific event occurred BEFORE THAT SUMMER DURING SOPHOMORE YEAR?? That meant I had spend 2 months with girls who hated me, and I didn‚Äôt even know why ? That‚Äôs when I understood that they had been talking behind my back since the beginning, that it was not just a one time thing.

After that, I just held back my tears until the end of dinner, because I was just so confused. Why would these girls tell me about their insecurities, family issues, and even their mental disorders if they hated me so much ? I had shared so many intimate details about my life and personal struggles  and so did they, but they hated me all along ? I just didn‚Äôt get it because I loved them so much, and because they preached so much about being honest, yk the kind of friend that tells you if your outfit looks like shit, if you should lose weight or if you new haircut looked bad, I just loved when they were being honest to my face because to me it meant that they didn‚Äôt have to talk behind my back, so I was really taken aback.

I know it might sound stupid but that betrayal really destroyed me, but at that point the new year was coming and I really wanted to leave that behind me, and be a new person in 2024. Little did I know it would get so much worse.

That year, our english class had an amazing trip abroad planned abroad, and although I was super excited about it, I felt really bad about the price and initially told my parents that I didn‚Äôt care about it and wouldn‚Äôt go. I grew up really poor  because my mom was sick, so money is something that I hate to even think of, I‚Äôve always worked very hard at school in the hopes of being able to support my family in the future.

Anyways that trip was 2,000$ for ten days, and my parents insisted on paying, even if they had to take out a loan, because they didn‚Äôt want me to be the only one to stay back and feel left out (I know, I have the best parents on earth and I‚Äôm crying writing this because the worst is coming).

Now in that english class, my main friend was Paul, we always sat together and he was the first one to tell me that my old friends were just jealous horrible girls and that I should just move on, which I know sounds stupid but he really was the only one for whom these girls didn‚Äôt matter and that felt very reassuring.

During winter break (February) our teacher sent a google form to write with who we wanted to stay in the room at the hotel, and I completely missed it, and when we came back to school, the only room left was with Rachel, a girl we knew from sophomore year which was pretty nice, and her best friend Camila, who was in our school in the 6th grade, had left for some time and had just came back to our school. I didn‚Äôt want to make a big fuss out of it because I knew that I would stay with Paul anyways.

Just before we left for our trip, my friend Clara, who was acquainted with Rachel, told me Rachel said she was on a ¬´¬†mission¬†¬ª to get me back to become friends with me again. And I was so confused ? At that point, my old friend group talked crap about me a lot, they really made it hard for me to make friends again because they had told everyone I was a horrible person, so I was really confused by the fact that Rachel wanted to even talk to me ? Why would you do me so dirty then ? But I just tried no to think about it, I was just so excited to go abroad. At that point in the year, I was struggling with depression but I really was trying to get better.

When we land, I‚Äôm just so excited, and the first day, everything goes pretty well in the room, the 4 of us get along pretty well.

The next morning, our class went to a breakfast place next to our hotel, and I went and sat down with Paul and his friends, because that just felt natural to me yk ?

Anyways, I don‚Äôt want to give too many details, but during daytime we were busy Paul and I had partenered together so it was fun, and we visited the city in the afternoon and had some free time after that.

Everyone and I mean EVERYONE would go in their friend‚Äôs rooms and hang out after our day ended, and would go back to their own before midnight to go to sleep, and so did I. On day 2 or 3 of the trip, I went back to my room at 11pm, took a shower and headed to bed. When I got out of the bathroom, Camila started yelling at me, telling me I was a horrible person, that I had no manners and that my parents had very badly educated me, first because I would eat breakfast with Paul, and then because I was coming back so late, not even telling them where and when I was with whom.

Mind you, before that trip I had barely ever talked to that girl, so I just told her that everybody was hanging out in rooms until late, and that I didn‚Äôt understand why it was a big deal.

Rachel was in the bed that we shared and faked being asleep (the light were on and Camila was screaming at me so I promise you it was impossible, even if she had been asleep, not to wake up). At that point I just went to bed crying because I didn‚Äôt even know what to do, why would I hang out with Rachel or Camila ? Their friends were horrible to me, Rachel never stopped them from calling me names, why would I spend time with her ? That just didn‚Äôt make sense to me.

I don‚Äôt want to go into many details, some other stuff happened but Camila went to some of my classmates and said, I quote ¬´¬†Don‚Äôt you think (me) is such a sl4t ? I just know she wants to suck Paul‚Äôs d so bad¬†¬ª amongst other horrible things, and I ended up sleeping on some of my classmates‚Äôs room couch for 2 days until I was able to fully change rooms and sleep in a bed with some very nice classmates until the end of the trip.

I remember one day we had some free time until 10pm, and I walked some time and sat on a bench on my own and I smoked a cigarette while listening to Brooklyn Baby Lana del Rey, crying because I was so depressed.

Although the trip was (definitely) not the best, that moment is just engraved in my mind, I felt free because I was alone, no one knew where I was and I just felt at peace for a minute or two.

Anyways as you can imagine, when we came back to school, the crap talking went through the roof. After that trip, I didn‚Äôt go to school for 10 days because I wanted to drop out and put myself in a mental hospital because I was genuinely scared of what I could do to myself. I felt so bad because my parents had paid so much for that trip and I didn‚Äôt even manage to pretend I had enjoyed myself, I still blame myself for that today.

Anyways, I failed 1/2 of my final exam that year, but had an amazing grade on the other so my average isn‚Äôt too bad, and I‚Äôm still at the same school today.

Rachel requested me on Instagram last month, which I refused, and Regina is now getting bullied by that old friend group, because they learnt that she was talking crap about everyone.

She would go to Leela, and tell her that Carmen was a btch, and then would go to Carmen and tell her that Leela was the ugliest girl she had ever seen, she would also order ubers on Violet‚Äôs account without her knowing amongst other things.

She is now taking legal measures against them because they are doing to her what they did to me, and I just feel so angry. It‚Äôs so unfair, how can you play Means Girls but not be able to face the consequences of that ? Complaining to anyone who‚Äôs willing to hear it that she‚Äôs on antidepressant ? I‚Äôve been in therapy for a year, I won‚Äôt be able to go to my dream school because my grades were so impacted in junior year, and you think what‚Äôs happening to you is unfair ? I just feel like i‚Äôm going insane, because I know that today, if I said that they bullied me back then, they would tell everyone that I‚Äôm some kind of crazy looser who just wants attention.

Honestly I just want to have some external opinions on my situation, I feel like no one really understands me, because although I have friends, they are friends or at least acquaintances to those girls, and everyone pretty much tells me that I‚Äôm being dramatic about it and that I should get over it. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck on it, I just need closure because I genuinely want to move on don‚Äôt know how I could achieve that. Please help me.",2,1740788543.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

1j0ml4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1j0ml4n/beyond_the_classroom/,Beyond the Classroom,"This is my first ever post here and it‚Äôs long, real long actually, so bear with me.  To provide some context, I served our country as a United Marine for 20 years on active duty before I began my teaching career.  I have read many post about the challenges and struggles about the teaching profession.  First let me say, I hear you and I have seen and experienced many of the same challenges.  At the end of this year, I will have been teaching high school JROTC for 17 years.  Yes it‚Äôs difficult, yes it can be frustrating, yes you may feel restricted, yes kids can be annoying at times, yes there may be parents that aren‚Äôt engaged, yes administration may be expecting more out of you.  Yata, yata, yata‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.the list can feel endless.  But what I want to share with all of you is the real impact of what it means ‚ÄúTo Teach‚Äù as I have experienced it.  The stories that follow are why I still continue to show up and do my thing.  It‚Äôs not about the curriculum, it‚Äôs about the connection.  

Beyond the Classroom
Teaching is often measured in semesters and school years, in lesson plans and report cards. But real teaching‚Äîthe kind that shapes lives‚Äîhas no final bell. It doesn‚Äôt end when the diploma is handed over or when the uniform is returned. It extends far beyond the classroom, woven into the stories, struggles, and successes of the students who pass through my door.
Over the years, I have been more than a teacher. I‚Äôve been a mentor, a guide, and at times, family. I have witnessed my students step into adulthood, not just as young men and women, but as leaders, Marines, artists, parents, and professionals. Their journeys have become part of mine, and I have had the privilege of standing beside them as they navigate life beyond high school.
I‚Äôve attended their weddings, watching them commit their lives to someone they love. I‚Äôve held their newborns, knowing that just yesterday, they were kids themselves, full of questions and potential. I‚Äôve celebrated their 21st birthdays, raising a glass to their milestones, proud of the men and women they‚Äôve become.
I‚Äôve stood in the audience, cheering them on as they perform‚Äîwhether on stage, in uniform, or in life. I‚Äôve sat in their homes at housewarming parties, grateful to see them build something of their own. I‚Äôve attended baby showers, watching them prepare to take on the greatest leadership role of all‚Äîparenthood.
I‚Äôve shared meals, coffee, and conversations too numerous to count. I‚Äôve answered calls at all hours, offered guidance in tough moments, and listened when they just needed someone who understood. I have walked with them through grief, stood beside them in celebration, and given them a place at my family‚Äôs table when they needed it.
I have promoted them in the military, honored to see them rise in the ranks and lead with the same integrity we talked about in the classroom. I have escorted them on senior night, knowing that while high school may be ending, my support for them never will.
I taught some of them how to drive a golf cart before they ever stepped behind the wheel of a car‚Äîbecause leadership isn‚Äôt just about discipline and responsibility. It‚Äôs also about trust, about giving young people the space to learn and grow in ways that don‚Äôt always fit inside a textbook.
And then there are the stories that unfold over years, sometimes over a decade, through stages of growth, change, struggle, and triumph.
One of my students, who I first met as a young high school cadet, left school and joined the military. Our mentorship continued through those early years of service, with late-night calls, long conversations, and steady guidance as she navigated the challenges of being a young Soldier.
Then she became a leader of Soldiers, and the nature of our conversations changed. She wasn‚Äôt just following anymore‚Äîshe was leading, making decisions that impacted the lives of those under her command. Our mentorship shifted, becoming one of shared experiences, of guiding her as she balanced me the weight of responsibility and leadership.
Then came another milestone‚Äîmarriage. Another phase of life, another set of challenges. We talked about commitment, about relationships, about what it meant to build a future with someone.
And then came the moment she shared something deeply personal‚Äîshe was transitioning. The young woman I had known was becoming a man. Through every question, every doubt, every moment of self-discovery, the trust we had built remained. He knew that I wasn‚Äôt just there to teach or mentor‚ÄîI was there to listen, to support, to stand beside him as he embraced who he truly was.
Years later, he made another decision‚Äîone that many wouldn‚Äôt have expected. He chose to come off hormones so that he could ovulate, have his eggs implanted in his wife, and later become a father. It was a journey of courage, of resilience, of pushing past what others might say or think to build the life he wanted.
And then came the hardest part. The overwhelming weight of life‚Äîthe struggles, the doubt, the moments where the darkness felt heavier than the light. When it felt like life might not be worth living, he reached out. Not to a hotline. Not to a stranger. To me. Because in the ten years that had passed since he walked through my classroom, he knew I would still be there.
Some of these connections have come full circle in ways I never could have imagined. One of my former students, a young woman I first met in high school, went on to become an Emmy Award-winning performer and an incredibly talented music artist. We had always shared a deep bond, and when the opportunity came to collaborate on something meaningful, we wrote a song together‚Äîone about resilience, about realizing that it‚Äôs okay to reach out for help. And then, in a moment that still feels surreal, I stood on stage and performed that song with her.
To be part of that experience‚Äîto stand beside a student who had once been in my classroom, now shining in her own right‚Äîwas a moment that captured everything I believe about teaching. The lessons we discuss, the values we instill, the challenges we overcome together‚Äîthey don‚Äôt just stay within the walls of the classroom. They become the foundation for something greater, something lasting.
Once a student, always a student. But more than that‚Äîonce a connection is made, it lasts. The lessons we discuss in class‚Äîabout leadership, responsibility, and character‚Äîare not confined to textbooks. They live on in the choices they make, in the lives they lead. And that is what teaching is truly about.
It‚Äôs about the moments beyond the classroom, the ones that can‚Äôt be measured in grades or attendance but in the impact made, the relationships built, and the lives changed.
And in the end, I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.
This story was captured by a local news outlet where I reside.  It chronicles my personal connection to one of my former students that has lasted for almost 17 years now.

Budget obviously pays a role here - I have seen people say $500-800 is a pretty decent place to start - hoping that holds true.

I found some great deals for a round trip flight to Stockholm for March 17-31st. I would love to get some help on a couple of topics.

Let me give you a quick background story about me, I'm originally from Guatemala but have been living in the USA for the last 11 years. I speak both Spanish and English fluently. I work in the insurance industry in a work from home setting. I love new cultures and not just your common touristy experiences. I love living like a local and getting the full experience. I just came back from a trip in December/January from Southeast Asia. And loved every second of it.
Now I would like to go somewhere opposite of that.
Sweden seems to be perfect. Everywhere I go, I tend to learn as much of the language as possible.

We are arriving in Stockholm (ARN). We don't have any actual plans we just booked the ticket and will figure it out once we're out there. We're staying mostly in hostels or hotels here and there depending on availability. We're planning on visiting Uppsala, Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm√∂ but would also love to go up north if possible. In case things aren't looking that fun or interesting, which I doubt, I would also like to take some days to visit Copenhagen and Helsinki.

We're hoping to use as much public transportation as possible but also willing to rent a car if needed but know if it's recommended.
I would like to know how the weather will be in March. I know there's always an unexpected change but at least to get an idea on how to pack. Do I need like a big coat or just a regular warm jacket should do?

We're not looking to go crazy with local Swedish girls but would love to know if there's anything or anywhere that we could find local people to share our culture and traditions maybe have a coffee or do whatever local people do. I've read it's close to imposible to find friends in Sweden but is there a way to at least get a friendly date (not interested in dating apps). I don't mind hanging out with young people or even older folks who are interested in telling stories while having a good time at the park or cottee.

I'm a little concerned about Sweden's current immigration situation. We both could be mistaken with Arabs due to our dark features. Is that something I should worry about or is it just like one of those things where, as long as you're not doing anything wrong you should be good? 

I might be missing some more details but you get the idea, we just want to get the best out of the trip.

Only deviation and note worthy notes are as follows:

- Used all KA flour with added VWG to bring protein content up from 12.7 to 13%. No whole wheat was added. 

- 79-80f average throughout bulk fermentation (used Proofer box and checked internal dough temp)

- Had to step out near the end of BF, came back it was about 50-60% risen at about 80f. I was hoping for it to be around 40% max before I shaped and retard. **Does it look a tad over proofed to you? I think it does to me. **

- Shaping was not a mess but, I blamed my non baker hands because I don't think I taut the dough strong enough so it looks a tiny bit flat lol. I was trying to be incredibly gentle and hands off as possible. 

Either way it's not perfect like the videos crumb, but I am super happy with my first attempt at it. ",3,1740787960.0,Sourdough,2,1.0,False

I ask because I watch it in the morning with coffee, and at night in bed. Those are the only two times I watch it. Very casual settings/viewing, you know?

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC üòÖ I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play any TTRPGs, but would love to.

I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

1. How would I go about getting the bot to stop controlling the plot? Sometimes I just want a life roleplay and after a movie or ""cuddle session"" or something they'll be like ""okay its over, we have work to do"". Like seriously, its annoying and nobody does this. Sometimes people just chill and TALK. I want it to be more like Character AI sometimes in this context, yes that site gets repetitive but at least I CAN control the pace, not freaking Ned Flanders. Sit down and read your Bible. It's the worst with my record label manager, hes constantly pushing for work on albums even in the middle of the night. Just SLEEP..

2. How would I go about making the responses faster? Maybe I'm used to superspeed responses from other places, but when I add lore and a detailed description these bots take a good 1 1/2-2 minutes per response, mostly looking through the lore/mem query. It makes it agonizing.

3. It dont bother me too much but how do I stop it when the bot goes like: ""You're nice, say youre nice, say it, say it and ill give you coffee. You aren't mean you are nice.."" etc, like please. I have another issue with some bots, I have one named 'Quinton' and they keep typing 'Quenton', and when I banned the word in reminders it just went to 'Quin'. Hell, even the memory says 'Quenton'. Please.

4. How do I get better personalities? I have a character that is a total nuthead, like Tuco-type crazy from Breaking Bad. I mean straight up Joker-level villainous that makes you put Despicable Me on blast. I got the example dialogues. But... when he's in chat he's suddenly like.. he'll threaten you and then never do anything, and sometimes even feel guilt when the user starts crying. Please, you're supposed to be cold. I thought this bot had no filters, it feels like its afraid of violence. Violent bots are hard, they either make that their whole personality full of gun-threats, or they arent good enough.

I dont want half-baked solutions like 'direct the bot', thats not why im here. Please üò≠

‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù

A cart was pushed across the linoleum.  
  
‚ÄúDaddy, we all love you okay? Me and Liza and mum‚Äìand you‚Äôre gonna see her really soon.‚Äù  
  
There was another woman beside her. Pajamas under a black peacoat. Her hair was disheveled and her mascara had run and ran again. A ball of wet tissues spun amidst her restless fingers. ‚ÄúI love you, Dad,‚Äù she added.  
  
The nurse approached the bedside. In his hand was a needle.   
  
‚ÄúHold on, please.‚Äù  
  
He stopped‚Äìadjusted his latex gloves. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre ready. Tell me. No rush.‚Äù  
  
The two women looked back at the lying husk‚Äìthe face half-hidden behind a plastic mask. A tube carried air. They could hear it in the quiet. And beeping. Car horns outside, and sirens. Footsteps in the hall. Fluorescents cast light through the doorway. They were watching too.   
  
One of the women‚ÄìLiza, in the pajamas‚Äìreached out to touch the wrinkled forehead, right above the ventilator mask. ‚ÄúDaddy.‚Äù  
  
Someone walked past the door, giving loud instructions. The nurse walked over and grabbed the metal knob, pushed‚Äìcut off some of the light, and the noise. He left it ajar. Dust flew into his eye; he rubbed at it and blinked. The motion squeezed the plunger some. Morphine ran down his glove. ‚ÄúShit.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThank you for being there. For us, and my kids. Your grandkids. They love you too.‚Äù The woman brushed hair off the man‚Äôs forehead. ‚ÄúThey couldn‚Äôt be here‚Ä¶ they were scared. I‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt want them to see you like this. But I want you to know that they care. Mike, too. He‚Äôs watching them at home, but he was cry-‚Äù  
  
‚Äú-Lily!‚Äù The woman in pajamas‚Äìher stare was empty. ‚ÄúHe knows, okay? Why would he think‚Ä¶ He doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying, alright! ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs important to me that it‚Äôs clear.‚Äù  
  
Reebok sneakers squeaked. The nurse went back to his rolling tray. He looked down at the needle‚Äôs glass body‚Äìthe metal spear. Thinner than a hair in the half-light. He tapped the plunger. Dew formed on the tip.  
  
‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt be in any more pain, alright, Daddy?‚Äù She wept. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre tired. You can sleep, okay? Just go to sleep.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúGo to sleep, Dad. I love you.‚Äù She dabbed her eyes with the wet mess of tissue.  
  
He sat down on a stool, rolled over. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ready?‚Äù  
  
The women nodded‚Äìwouldn‚Äôt look at him.   
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure?‚Äù  
  
Silence.  
  
His latex fingers pulled the skin taught. The needle broke through, slid into flesh. He depressed the plunger with his thumb. He could almost feel the morphine shooting out the buried tip, flowing into the vein, mixing with the blood. ‚ÄúAlright, Mister Tennon. Time to rest.‚Äù   
  
Snap! Red plastic. A faded label: ON/OFF. The ventilator went quiet. No more air in the tube. He reached down to pull the mask off, kept his forearm hovering above the patient‚Äôs open mouth. Nothing. The nose. Nothing.   
  
‚ÄúHe must‚Äôve gone minutes ago. I can still feel some warmth.‚Äù He touched his arm to flesh. ‚ÄúNo breath.‚Äù  
  
The women were quiet, sobbing shadows.  
  
He looked at the older one‚ÄìLily. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs done now.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúHe passed when we told him it was time,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhen I told him to sleep.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYes, I think so. It‚Äôs possible.‚Äù He set the empty needle down. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he heard everything you said.‚Äù He glanced at the man‚Äôs eyes. Empty. Nothing. 

\#

‚ÄúAndy!‚Äù

The nurse stopped, turned around. ‚ÄúDoctor?‚Äù  
  
His white coat was flapping‚Äìleather heels snapped against the floor. The doctor slowed, came to a stop. He spoke through heavy breath. ‚ÄúRoom three-o‚Äô-seven. Got another one for you.‚Äù  
  
Andy, the nurse, said: ‚ÄúUh.. my shift‚Äôs over. Can Melissa?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo, your shift is not over, and no, Melissa is busy.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ six-thirty.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs six-twenty.‚Äù  
  
Silence.  
  
A smack on his shoulder. ‚ÄúCome on, bud. Earn that paycheque. People are crying and people are dying. Not gonna leave ‚Äòem like that.‚Äù He fished a pen out of his white coat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got an achilles in twenty minutes. Gonna shit and grab a coffee so I don‚Äôt fall asleep.‚Äù  
  
He left.  
  
Andy turned, forced open the swinging bathroom door. It reeked of urinal cake and sewage. He went over to the sink. Water dribbled out of the faucet. Calcium had grown from out of the spout‚Äìin the ridges of the metal drain cover. He turned the knob. The dribble stopped. One of the janitors had decapitated the soap dispenser. Its clear plastic head lay below on the ledge of the sink. Congealed, pink gunk was splattered down the wall; the nozzle was encrusted with it.   
  
Humming. From one of the stalls.  
  
The nurse looked in the mirror, saw the closed door.  
  
‚ÄúI keep drinking malted milk, tryna‚Äô drive my blues away.‚Äù  
  
Something in the voice made his chest seize. He turned the knob. Water squeezed out onto the porcelain. It swirled around, and around, then filtered into the drain.   
  
‚ÄúMalted milk, malted milk, keeps rushin' to my head.‚Äù  
  
He shut it off. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a nice voice. Who‚Äôs in there?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúAnd I have a funny, funny feeling, and I'm talkin' all out of my- ‚Ä¶Well thank you, son. I‚Äôm not a singer.‚Äù  
  
The nurse talked into the mirror‚Äìto the reflection of the stall. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say you are.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúMighty kind. I‚Äôm just here to do my business.‚Äù  
  
A pause. ‚ÄúIs that Leroy in there?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo, no. This ain‚Äôt Leroy. I‚Äôm not from here, you see?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWhere, then?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs alright. What are you doing in the shitter, son? Tell me. Standing at the sink like that.‚Äù  
  
The nurse shifted his gaze. He faced down his reflection. ‚ÄúI, uh‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôm just freshening up.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôve gotta pull the plug on someone.‚Äù  
  
A sound from the stall, reverberated on the tiles: a groan. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your job here?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm a nurse, but we have to do it when we‚Äôre called on.‚Äù  
  
Silence.  
  
‚ÄúBaby, fix me one more drink, and hug your daddy one more time.‚Äù  
  
The nurse frowned. ‚ÄúYou, uh‚Ä¶ Visiting someone?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYessir, I am.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWho?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúA very sick man.‚Äù  
  
Silence.   
  
‚ÄúKeep on stirring my malted milk mama, until I change my mind.‚Äù  
  
The metal of the knob was cold. He turned it. Stream of water. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a folded tissue. A pill rolled out into his palm, shaped like a baseplate from a pitch. A large ‚ÄúA‚Äù was molded on one side. He opened his mouth, felt the hard pill on his tongue. The water filled his cupped hands, then washed the little thing down.  
  
‚ÄúMy door knob keeps on turning, must be spooks around my bed.‚Äù  
  
He lifted his hand, looked at its reflection. It shook.   
  
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the time, son?‚Äù The voice crept out from the melody.   
  
‚ÄúOh, uh‚Ä¶ I guess it‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù He checked his watch, his reflected eye stared back above the clicking hands. ‚ÄúSix-forty-five.‚Äù A sigh. He shut off the water. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve gotta get this over with if I wanna go home. Nice talking to you.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI have a warm, old feeling, and the hair rising on my head.‚Äù A pause‚Ä¶ that turned into dead silence.   
  
Andy had his hand on the door. He took it off, crouched down. Slowly. He saw clear through under every stall‚Äìsaw every trunk of every toilet planted in the tile. But no shoes. No legs. The door swung open and he slipped out, letting it go behind him. 

\#

He shook the outstretched hand. ‚ÄúAndy Kemper.‚Äù

‚ÄúPleasure. Sit down.‚Äù  
  
The chair was thinly cushioned. He straightened his jacket.   
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm Doctor Ellis. Gary Ellis, alright? You came highly recommended. Went to UVA, School of Nursing‚Ä¶ I know some of the professors there.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúOh, fantastic. Do you know Harry?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYeah, Harry Santiago. I know him. Know Karen Singh‚Ä¶ Osian Molina did some talks there, I know him too.‚Äù  
  
Andy‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúOh, wow. Okay.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYeah. I could get you a job at his place up in Roanoke someday.‚Äù His eyes lifted. ‚ÄúIf you do well here.‚Äù  
  
Silence.  
  
‚ÄúTell me about yourself.‚Äù  
  
Andy reached for his tie knot. It was straight, but he fiddled anyway. ‚ÄúI was born in Richmond, moved up to Charlottesville for school‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve always wanted to get into medicine and nursing. Helping people is‚Ä¶ my mother always instilled that in me. A desire to protect life. I really love my mother, you know‚Ä¶ A lot. She‚Äôs my rock.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWhat is she? What does she do?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs a cardiologist.‚Äù  
  
A pen started scribbling. ‚ÄúOh, okay.‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúYour father?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúHe left when I was ten.‚Äù  
  
Scribbling. ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs okay. He was a deadbeat.‚Äù  
  
A frown. ‚ÄúHow were your grades?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúUh, very good. Yeah, very good. Top of the class.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúA‚Äôs, B‚Äôs?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúMostly A‚Äôs.‚Äù He looked around the room. Three degrees were hung behind the desk, above the doctor‚Äôs head. Traffic shuffled along below behind aluminum blinds. The room smelled of antiseptic and printer ink.   
  
‚ÄúSo HR brought you on here, I‚Äôm just going over their notes to me.‚Äù His blue eyes walked the printed type. ‚ÄúWhat do you hope you can learn here? What do you‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs your plan for the future?‚Äù  
  
Andy fiddled with a button on his jacket. His foot was tapping the floor. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ absorb everything I possibly can, I guess‚Ä¶ Um.‚Äù ‚Äìthe doctor‚Äôs eyes snapped up‚Äì ‚ÄúMake new professional connections, work in the field‚Ä¶ just start somewhere. That‚Äôs what mum told me.‚Äù  
  
The HR paper returned to the desk. ‚ÄúAt your age, that‚Äôs really all you can do, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù  
  
Andy blinked.  
  
‚ÄúWe deal with a lot of brutality here. I‚Äôm sure you expected that?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúAs we speak, someone is now dead.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúAnd now. And now. Three families are crying somewhere in this building. Three nurses are standing in three rooms, each with a corpse and maybe an inconsolable child‚Äìa son, or daughter. A wife or a husband. School can teach you about which tube goes where and what artery plugs into what organ, but you can‚Äôt teach a kid how to keep his soul from slowly crumbling away. We‚Äôre like soldiers, alright? A nurse can get attached to their patients. Some become friends. One day you walk into that room and your friend might have gone in the night. What then?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThe body is taken away, the sheets are replaced, and the next patient gets tucked in. Now you‚Äôre giving apple juice and pudding to a completely different guy.‚Äù The pen started again. Then stopped. ‚ÄúSometimes you pull the plug yourself. Doctor gives the order, and the nurse executes. In some cases, the family might not want you to do it. Sometimes they do. When they don‚Äôt, it makes everything worse for everyone involved, alright?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI understand.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo you don‚Äôt. Not yet, you don‚Äôt.‚Äù He shuffled papers around on his desk. ‚ÄúI just need to know if you‚Äôre ready to learn. Fast, and unpleasantly.‚Äù  
  
Andy rubbed his hands together. His palms were sweating. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ Yes, Doctor.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúHa! You‚Äôve got that bit right already.‚Äù

\#

The door was half open. He pushed. The lights were on inside, illuminating three people who turned in unison to face him. There was nothing friendly in their eyes. ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù He pulled the door half-closed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Andy Kemper.‚Äù

Silence.  
  
The man went first. ‚ÄúBill.‚Äù He spoke his own name like he was cursing. ‚ÄúAngela. Lorraine.‚Äù His eyes tracked the nurse as he gathered his equipment. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs gonna take our baby away.‚Äù  
  
The nurse looked over his shoulder. A web of clear tubes had been stuck into the infant like it was a pincushion. It looked malnourished‚Äìfrail. One of the women clutched its tiny hand, and it must have been the mother. ‚ÄúDoctor Ellis did his examination, I was told. He do-‚Äù  
  
‚Äú-He left half an hour ago. We‚Äôve had to sit here with our baby breathing through a straw for half a fucking hour before you showed up.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù  
  
A scoff. ‚ÄúFucking sorry, he says.‚Äù  
  
They all went quiet.  
  
Andy pulled a clean syringe and found the morphine. The needle sucked at it‚Äìthirsty. A flick. He tested the plunger. Liquid glass trickled down his glove. Now he gathered everything, set it all on the rolling tray‚Äìbrought it over to the bed.  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you fucking touch my boy.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúLorraine!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gonna kill him, Bill!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúShut up, woman! Shut up! He‚Äôs gone, alright!‚Äù  
  
She started to cry. The other woman embraced her.   
  
‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll wait until you‚Äôre ready.‚Äù  
  
The man looked up. He was heavyset, with a baseball cap. Buccaneers. ‚ÄúWhat? Really? How can we be ready?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúDo you have kids, boy?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo, sir.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWhat are you, nineteen?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúTwenty-seven.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWell, one day you‚Äôll grow up and understand.‚Äù He rubbed his eyes with his thumb and index. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt give a shit what you‚Äôre doing, huh? You fucking robots come in here every couple hours and poke buttons and change tubes, then when someone needs to die, you pump ‚Äòem full and pull the plug. Take the body out and put another one in.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not fair, sir.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYou know what‚Äôs not fair?‚Äù He didn‚Äôt finish.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôll take a sorry from God. I don‚Äôt care what you feel like.‚Äù  
  
The second woman was glaring. When he met her gaze, she seemed to snarl. ‚ÄúWhat do they pay you? Huh?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ not a lot, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs already too much.‚Äù  
  
Silence. It seemed like hours. He looked at the clock. Seven-thirty-five.  
  
‚ÄúI need to do this.‚Äù  
  
They didn‚Äôt answer.  
  
He took a step.  
  
‚ÄúNO!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúLORRAINE! SHUT IT!‚Äù  
  
The woman started to rock back and forth. ‚ÄúNot my baby. Not my baby. Not my baby.‚Äù  
  
Andy looked down at the child. There was nothing in its expression. The eyes were closed‚Äìits breathing was hoarse. He took hold of the arm, pulled the skin taught. The woman wailed and fell out of her chair.   
  
The needle broke the skin, slid into the muscle. He could feel the liquid pulsing as it left the tip, finding its way into the bloodstream.  
  
They‚Äôd put a ventilator on the kid, too. He gently pried the mask off. When he felt for breath with his forearm, he sensed it on his arm hair. It was fading. The eyes‚Ä¶ empty already. Nothing. He stood, put the needle in its disposal bin, and turned to the man. He‚Äôd hoped he would turn and face him, but he didn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be gone soon. Someone will come check on you, or you can let the receptionist know when you leave.‚Äù  
  
Silence.  
  
He left to the sound of sobbing.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been theorized that the human mind is conscious for a time after death. Something about neurons firing still, or some kind of activity appearing in scans once a person has passed‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, well that‚Äôs not been proven yet. Some colleagues of mine a few years ago were toying around with‚Ä¶ I think it was a rat‚Äôs brain. At risk of sounding graphic, they decapitated the poor thing, and had all sorts of sensors attached to its head. Supposedly, and I emphasize that strongly, they picked up activity for‚ÄìI believe it was three minutes. Nothing remotely relating to conscious thought, and in any case, it was indeed a rat and not a man.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI also heard of something involving a dog head, or a cat head, or-‚Äù  
  
‚Äú-Oh, God. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ The Russians in the forties managed to decapitate a dog, and then simulate a circulatory and respiratory system that seemed to bring life back to the head in some capacity. Yes, I saw the film.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúAnd that would mean that the brain functions still if you reintroduce‚Ä¶ well, a body with its systems intact.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúAnd you believe the film is real?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúDo you, Doctor?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI do not. Damage would have been done to the brain once the blood was drained from the body, and putting any trust in a film shot in the forties‚Äìand by Russians‚Äìis a dubious thing. They claimed the dog lived for years‚Äìthere is no proof of that. In the film, it seems to live for maybe a minute or two.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúBut then that would prove my point.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWould it?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThe brain is conscious for a few minutes after death.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúHmm, well, I guess I‚Äôll have to do some experiments myself. But definitely not on dogs.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs right. That‚Äôs all the time we have. Please thank my special guest, Doctor Osian Molina from Cardinal Medicine, right here in the state of Virgin-‚Äù

He shut the radio off.

Rain crackled against the windshield. Vague shapes of cars rushed past left and right, images muddied by the rivulets running down the windows. The vibrations of the tires tried to lull him asleep. He checked the clock on the dash. Eight-thirty. 

A red light. He reached up to run his hand across his face. A glance out the window. The silhouette of another driver was only just visible. He couldn‚Äôt see any features‚Äìjust shadow. There might have been smoke from a dark cigarette. It created a swirling void.

Something shifted in the back seat.

Green light.

He couldn‚Äôt turn around. He ignored the sound as he stepped on the gas.

Hot breath on his neck.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù A quick glance over his shoulder. Nothing. He checked the rear-view mirror.

‚ÄúEarly this mornin' when you knocked upon my door.‚Äù

He almost veered into the oncoming lane. A head and shoulders were visible against the backdrop of the rear windshield. Shadow. No face. It was sitting right behind him.

‚ÄúAnd I said ‚Äòhello Satan,‚Äô I believe it's time to go.‚Äù

He caught his breath. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck? How did you get in here?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, son. You gotta keep them eyes on the road, don‚Äôt ya?‚Äù Something like a snicker. ‚ÄúAlways gotta keep them eyes forward. There‚Äôs spooks out at night.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow was your last job, son?‚Äù

‚ÄúGet the fuck out of my car.‚Äù

Silence.

‚ÄúIt was a child.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe and the Devil was walkin' side by side.‚Äù

The car smelled of rotten meat. It wasn‚Äôt coming from the air vents.

The shadow said, ‚ÄúYour doctor told you things when you first met him. Did you learn, son?‚Äù

A moment passed. ‚ÄúI feel empty.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I guess he was right about you. Wasn‚Äôt prepared for what was comin‚Äô. Broken too easy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen‚Ä¶ I unplug someone‚Ä¶‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúThe ones that die immediately, or the ones that were already dead‚Ä¶ Their eyes change. They turn into‚Ä¶ wax dolls‚Äìor husks. My‚Ä¶ my mind doesn‚Äôt see them as a person anymore. They‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre a thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I'm going to beat my woman until I get satisfied.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see‚Ä¶ people as‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off.

Some lifted truck sped past over the limit. Water splashed up onto the windshield.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have friends, really. Maybe I‚Äôm sociopathic.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got me, son. I‚Äôll be here whenever you need me. Don‚Äôt you worry.‚Äù

Andy didn‚Äôt smile.

‚ÄúHave you pulled the plug on someone and regretted it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI regret every one.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs a shit way of looking at it. You‚Äôre ending a man‚Äôs suffering.‚Äù

He spun the wheel‚Äìdid a ‚ÄòU‚Äô turn. ‚ÄúBut what if that man wants to fight? Maybe he‚Äôs in pain, but he wants to try and get through somehow; we can‚Äôt tell ‚Äòcause he‚Äôs in a coma, and then we cut it short.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou may bury my body down by the highway side-... But the doc made his call. Are you doubting his education?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I think people can be wrong.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúO-o-o-oh, now look here. So my old evil spirit can get a Greyhound bus and ride.‚Äù  
  
More hot breath on his neck. It was almost scalding, like kettle steam. Then‚Ä¶ nothing. He checked the mirror again; the shadow was gone. The back wiper flipped back and forth, peeling droplets away from the glass. Ahead, a car was stopped on the side of the road, hazard lights blinking. Metal was wrinkled like paper. Webs ran through glass.   
  
Blood had mixed with the rain atop the asphalt. Droplets pelted the disemboweled corpse of a doe. The car had torn its stomach and spilled its life across the highway. Red and blue lights flashed in the water trailing down the nurse‚Äôs windshield. He turned away and kept driving.

\#

‚ÄúI heard about your mother.‚Äù

Andy‚Äôs eyes flicked up. Wide. ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù  
  
‚Äú...Thank you.‚Äù  
  
The pen went to scribbling. ‚ÄúAre you planning anything?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶.‚Äù  
  
The pen stopped. ‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù  
  
Silence.  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to plan celebrations alone, I know. An eightieth birthday is a big one. It‚Äôs shit your dad‚Äôs not in the picture to help out. You have any aunts‚Ä¶ uncles?‚Äù  
  
A pause. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúDamn. Well‚Ä¶ Shouldn‚Äôt waste the occasion. I hope you can spend some quality time with her.‚Äù  
  
Silence.  
  
The pen stopped. Doctor Ellis fit it into a cramped pen holder. ‚ÄúHow are things going here? Are you learning lots? Making those connections?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ yeah, I am.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúGood. I like to hear that. The patients seem to like you, you‚Äôre efficient, you‚Äôre effective. A lot of the other nurses really get shaken up when they get asked to pull someone. You don‚Äôt. Maybe we should do a check up on you.‚Äù A laugh. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a necessary thing, though‚ÄìI‚Äôm sure you get that by now. Can‚Äôt keep patients here forever‚Ä¶ getting pumped with drugs and getting cut up for months on end. Even if the families don‚Äôt get that, alright? We‚Äôre all fragile. Humans are like glass. You can harden it and make it stronger, but it‚Äôs still gonna break if you drop it.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYes, Doctor.‚Äù The nurse‚Äôs attention drifted. There was a framed poem on the wall above the degrees. He‚Äôd read it tens of times over by now‚Äìwhile sitting in this chair. 

\#

Do not stand

By my grave, and weep.

I am not there,

I do not sleep.

\#

It was a small clipping from Clare Harner. Sunlight had faded the printed letters.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my favorite.‚Äù

Andy looked down at the doctor. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey read the full thing at my mother‚Äôs funeral.‚Äù Ellis spun in his chair to look up at the frame. ‚ÄúI like to think that when a person dies, something leaves them that becomes a part of nature. Like a soul, maybe. I know it‚Äôs not true, of course, but it helps to comfort the mind.‚Äù He spun back, shuffled some papers around. ‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen we die, we‚Äôre gone. The body shuts down‚Äìthe brain dies.‚Äù

‚ÄúSpoken like a man of science.‚Äù He tilted his head, looked hard at the nurse. ‚ÄúDoes that make it easier?‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre working.‚Äù

The nurse fiddled with the bottom lining of his scrub top. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ No, I guess it makes it harder.‚Äù

\#

The receptionist was gone.

Nurses and doctors mulled about the halls, some sprinting with clipboards, others talking. Andy leaned against the counter. A plastic brochure holder sat off to the side. The text on the topmost one was bolded: Have you checked your eyes? A smiling woman was peering over the lower stack of brochures. He reached over to straighten the holder. The phone started to ring‚Äìa little light blinked.  
  
‚ÄúShit.‚Äù The receptionist rushed around the counter, just returning from the bathroom. She wrenched on the rolling chair, sat, and snatched the phone. ‚ÄúSantiago Molina Center. This is the ICU front desk‚ÄìLinda speaking.‚Äù She tapped a pen against her notepad as she listened.   
  
‚ÄúAndy!‚Äù  
  
The nurse looked over. ‚ÄúDoctor?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúTaking a breather?‚Äù Ellis came over, leaned on the counter next to him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been doing great lately, alright? Honestly.‚Äù  
  
Snap! The pen struck the counter between them. Linda frowned and motioned to the phone at her ear.  
  
Ellis took the nurse by the shoulder and they left the receptionist to her call. ‚ÄúWe had a guy come in yesterday. Accident on the highway, apparently. Had a fractured ribcage and some broken bones in his arms. Fucking ugly shit.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúSounds like it.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúSurgeries are tough. One wrong cut and the guy‚Äìor gal‚Äìstarts bleeding where they shouldn‚Äôt be. Brain stuff is worse, obviously. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm just watching sometimes and not holding the knife.‚Äù He straightened his jacket. ‚ÄúBut listen, alright? I‚Äôve got another job for you. An old girl with Alzheimers. She had a stroke, and she‚Äôs deteriorating rapidly. Won‚Äôt eat, won‚Äôt sleep, the whole thing, alright? Her heart‚Äôs slowing down every day‚Äìpoor girl. She‚Äôs getting violent, too, so hopefully she‚Äôs asleep when you get in. If not, you can give her some Temazepam and Morphine. If you end up needing help, you can call for someone.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ Is her family in there?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo. Her husband died a while back, apparently. She lived alone for years‚Äìno kids, no nothing. A neighbor called to report loud sounds and things being thrown around in the house. They brought her here. It‚Äôs a shit case.‚Äù  
  
The nurse felt his heartbeat in his skull.   
  
‚ÄúSo take out the I.V., shut off the monitor, all that. Give her something to help her sleep. You know the drill. She might be getting moved to hospice at that point if she holds on.‚Äù He smiled. ‚ÄúAll clear?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYes, Doctor.‚Äù  
  
A smack on the shoulder. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I like to hear.‚Äù

\#

He knocked. No answer.

The hinges needed oiling. Or maybe they were screaming. Inside, the lights were shut off, but morning sunlight filtered through the blinds. The whole room smelled of rot. Someone had plugged a Febreze into the wall socket, beside the plug for the television.  
  
She was sitting up in bed. The sun kept him from discerning much detail from her face, apart from the obvious smile. ‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù  
  
He felt his heart thumping.  
  
Gray strands of hair hung down over a wrinkled face‚Äìunwashed. Her eyelids has nearly shrunken up into the sockets.   
  
He stayed by the door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Andy Kemper.‚Äù  
  
Silence.  
  
‚ÄúIs there no one here with you?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo. Th-th-th-th-the-e-e-e-the.‚Äù Sound flowed unformed from between crackling lips.  
  
Someone had left a pile of bloody rags on the counter opposite the bed. Unsanitary. Above it, a wad of flies had collected on the ceiling. They flew between the rags, the ceiling, and the woman in the bed. Where they went when they got to her, he couldn‚Äôt see.   
  
The nurse entered gradually, retrieved what he needed from around the room: gloves, the rolling tray, the needle, the morphine. He felt snaps and pops under his sneakers. Buzzing. ‚ÄúYou should lie down.‚Äù  
  
She didn‚Äôt.  
  
Wherever he went, he felt her eyes.   
  
‚ÄúTh-th-th-th-th-th-th. Y o u r m o t h e r Th-th-th-th.‚Äù  
  
He stopped.  
  
The smell was almost overpowering standing so close. It was like fried meat. He was sure her skin was only a suit‚Äìthat it wasn‚Äôt connected to muscle anymore.  
  
‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù  
  
Something came from deep inside her chest. A sound he‚Äôd never heard, and one he never wanted to hear again. Like every organ had ruptured and turned to liquid‚Äìand started to boil. She tried to grab at him, but he easily stepped aside.   
  
‚ÄúMa‚Äôam. Will you stop?‚Äù He filled the syringe.  
  
‚ÄúY O U R M O T H E R.‚Äù  
  
The woman‚Äôs thin hair was whipping violently as she thrashed forward and back. It was a violent motion‚Äìhe thought she was trying to snap her own spine. Pink discharge ran down the sides of her mouth, then it came from her eyes. The bed rocked. Maggots shook loose from between the mattress and bedsheets; they fell to the ground and writhed. The motion wrung urine out of the bed‚Äìletting it drip and pool beneath.   
  
The nurse watched. He didn‚Äôt move.  
  
‚ÄúMy door knob keeps on turnin', it must be spooks around my bed.‚Äù  
  
It came from the bathroom. He turned, saw a face floating in the shadowy doorframe. He recognized that face.   
  
‚ÄúKill the bitch.‚Äù  
  
She continued to wail.   
  
‚ÄúKill the bitch, son. Kill the bitch and she‚Äôll shut the fuck up. This is it, Andy boy. This is the one.‚Äù  
  
The woman rocked forward hard and lost her balance. She went over the foot of the bed and landed head-first. There was no more wailing after that.   
  
Andy looked back at the bathroom. The face was gone. He set the needle down, backed away from the bed. Her body was mangled and twisted. Flies crawled out from the openings in the rotting, blue hospital gown. The eyes were staring at him, and he knew then that she could still see him. The thing that always left was still there. 

\#

The lock jangled, then snapped. He opened the door and went in. Streetlamp overshine painted strange shapes across his apartment furniture. Eagerly, he flicked the light switch, took off his coat, and pulled a brown paper bag from its inner pocket. It was wet, but thankfully hadn‚Äôt broken through.

Off came his shoes, then he slid them into their place neatly. He set the bag on the counter and opened the fridge. Tomorrow, he would have to go shopping. There was just enough applesauce. He pried one free from the cardboard and found a spoon.   
  
The kitchen radio fizzled stubbornly‚Äìcame to life.  
  
  
  
‚ÄúEyes are the window to the soul.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúDo you believe in a soul?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI do. As a‚Ä¶ as an empath I deal with the soul everyday‚Ä¶ right? Why is it that I can see spirits and communicate with the beyond? Well the soul leaves us when we die and goes somewhere else. I was gifted, fortunately, with the ability to‚Ä¶ tap into that other side and talk with peoples‚Äô souls.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWhen you look into someone‚Äôs eyes, can‚Ä¶ I mean, can you see anything there? That‚Äôs special?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ you know, I‚Äôd say what I just said: the eyes are the window. I don‚Äôt know if I can read your mind, really, or communicate with your soul when it‚Äôs in your body‚Äìwhen it‚Äôs in your body, then‚Ä¶ like, just talking to you is communicating with your soul.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúRight.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶ something special‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs hard. I see auras around people.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúLike white light and that sort of thing?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúEssentially. If someone has bad intentions, or if their soul is corrupted, then I can see that darkness, and vice versa.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYou believe in God?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI do. God gave me this gift. I don‚Äôt know why, but he did. I thank him every day for it.‚Äù

\#

Her room was shut, but the flies still slipped under the door.

When he opened it, he felt her warmth. The smell. It used to smell like fried meat, but now it just smelled like her. How she used to smell. ‚ÄúHi, Mom.‚Äù He set the paper bag down on the rolling tray. There were tools there‚Äìbloody, but they were her tools. Beside the bed was a heart rate monitor. The sound was shut off, but the screen displayed a constant line. ‚ÄúWork wasn‚Äôt great, but I got something for you.‚Äù   
  
Silence.  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôll help us communicate better, I think.‚Äù He picked up the bag and opened it. With a gentle shake, two eyeballs rolled out onto the tray. He picked one up, looked into the pupil. It was still there. It hadn‚Äôt left. ‚ÄúThese are the ones, Mom. Okay? I‚Ä¶ I finally found them.‚Äù  
  
Silence.  
  
‚ÄúWe can pluck those old ones out and put these new ones in. But after your dinner, alright? You have to eat this time. Don‚Äôt just keep it in your mouth.‚Äù He peeled open the apple sauce and dug the spoon inside. ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù

It's a cute and heartwarming compilation of joy: the joy of family gathered around the iftar table, my impatient dad hurrying me to buy him coffee before Maghreb, and the chill nighttime moments with cups of tea, chatting with friends about our problems‚Äîranging from the micro to the macro‚Äîin a sarcastic way.

Over the past couple of years, I‚Äôve questioned the religion I was raised in multiple times. I‚Äôve humbly explored the depths of history, science, philosophy, and a touch of theology from the Abrahamic faiths, seeking answers to broad existential questions. Though I‚Äôm still in the midst of this journey, I no longer see myself as the firm believer I once was.

But I don‚Äôt really hate this sacred Islamic month. Pragmatically speaking, there is no reason for me to be against a month that brings happiness to my family, friends, and even children. It is an event that can be a good investment‚Äîboth on a personal and social level‚Äîor, let's say, a spiritual ritual (though not in the traditional sense of a soul) that can enrich my human experience, as Alain de Botton talks and explains in *Religion for Atheists*, which I read months ago and talks about those who do not subscribe to faith can still find meaning in its cultural and psychological contributions.

1j0m95t,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1j0m95t/unsupportive_mil_surprised_we_dont_visit_her_more/,Unsupportive MIL surprised we don‚Äôt visit her more,"I got pregnant after being married to my husband for 6 years. We married young so I wanted to wait until I was closer to 30 to start our family. 

My MIL would pester me all the time about having kids asap. I was firm in my boundary and shut her down respectfully. She resorted to asking husband behind my back if we were having ‚Äòissues‚Äô. We weren‚Äôt but my husband was so upset by her assuming and told her to stop asking him. 

Anyway, I eventually fell pregnant and my MIL was nowhere to be seen. She went on a trip overseas for three months at the end of my pregnancy. I worked up until I had my baby to get as much leave as possible. It was a really difficult time for me. 

When I had the baby my MIL decided to start working 7 days a week. She has seen my baby maybe 7 or 8 times in 11 months and lives 20 minutes away from me. She has never brought food or helped clean the house or look after the baby. When she visits she expects to be waited on/served tea and coffee to which I don‚Äôt do, my husband will (this is a big no no in their community). 

My MIL believes that we should bring the baby to visit her and that she shouldn‚Äôt come to us. She is only available in the evening when it‚Äôs baby‚Äôs bedtime which we have explained doesn‚Äôt work for us. When we have visited her she just sits on her phone and when my husband leaves the room she will say something super out of pocket and rude to me.  Because of this, I‚Äôve had to set a boundary with my husband that I won‚Äôt visit or see her alone and that he should stay with me/the baby when she‚Äôs around. Also this is why we don‚Äôt bloody visit her often. 

At the moment, she has decided to take Saturdays off to have more time. I literally don‚Äôt give a fuck. She‚Äôs waiting for me to visit or invite her over and I won‚Äôt. 11 months has gone by and my husband and I have done everything on our own without depending on anyone (because we can‚Äôt). What makes her think we need her now? The amount of messages she has been sending me asking what I‚Äôm doing and saying she loves me and is proud is ridiculous. I‚Äôve known her for 10 years, why start this bullshit now. I feel like it‚Äôs to show people that I‚Äôm the bad guy? Just a hunch I have. 

On a seperate issue my SIL lives with my MIL and they HATE each other. They‚Äôve both started inviting ME out and telling each other that I‚Äôm inviting them to make them jealous/upset. My SIL invited me to the zoo yesterday. I only went because I planned on taking my baby anyway. She was 1 hour late and spent the first 30 minutes going back and forth to her car because she forgot her pram and other items. She was late because she didn‚Äôt give my niece breakfast so my niece started shaking. My SIL freaked out and took her to the hospital. Doctor said she was hungry. My SIL is often dramatic and blows up minor issues. There was one year where she cried on everyone‚Äôs birthday and got into arguments over nothing. 

Anyway so SIL was surprised that I had to leave at the time I communicated the day before because my baby has to go home for her afternoon nap. We only spent 50 minutes together because I had a 40 minute drive home. She has two kids herself and was angry because when I left her baby was overtired and needed to nap and it was ‚Äòhard for her‚Äô‚Ä¶? She said ‚Äúoh so you‚Äôre not coming back to my house to visit?‚Äù Firstly you never communicated that was the plan and secondly no. My baby won‚Äôt just nap anywhere. I wish she would but she doesn‚Äôt. 

These people are just impossible and I‚Äôm at the point where I expect dumb behaviour from them and am just numb to it. Husband was unsurprised by what transpired and agreed I should bother hanging out with her again. He has consistently told me to just not bother. It‚Äôs sad that it‚Äôs only been 2-3 times but each time has been a shit show. Going forward I‚Äôm just going to do my own thing and limit my communication.",14,1740787404.0,motherinlawsfromhell,5,1.0,False

I have absolutely zero reference for the cost of living, but I understand Tucson is quite a bit cheaper than Toronto.

Memoricall - Dragon Saliva

OK, firstly from the moment I began playing this game I always thought the way the drinks looked when you served them looked a bit.. clunky? This is especially the case with multiple drinks that just seem sort of like they are floating ish/not meant to be there. I think adding a tray that could come in different colour (like pizza boxes!) or a standard colour could be added to make it make more sense!!

Furthermore I think it would be super cool to have other options to consider after diff drink types have been learned e.g ‚Äòto go‚Äô or not! If a customer wants their order ‚Äòto go‚Äô the player could drag a ‚Äòto go‚Äô lid onto the cup and then serve and there could be an opportunity for a system where you can buy an auto-lidder like the auto cutter and the whole lid thing act like the amount of slice mechanic.

Finally, for more customisation cup sleeves could be super cute! Like pizza box customisation from gpgp (especially if there is a ‚Äòto go‚Äô order) a sleeve can be added and this sleeve can be changed with customisable options in the store!!

I graduated this past May from a well-regarded public college in NYC with a BBA in International Marketing and dual minors in Economics and Data Analytics. While I sometimes think I should have chosen a more finance-focused degree, I‚Äôve worked hard to gain relevant experience, maintain a strong GPA (3.5), earn multiple honors, and complete certifications. Since August, I‚Äôve applied to over 700 jobs‚Äîentry-level roles, programs, internships, and apprenticeships‚Äîbut I can count on two hands how many interviews I‚Äôve received.

I‚Äôve done everything I can think of‚Äîtailoring my resume and cover letters, securing recommendation letters, practicing for interviews, and even paying for LinkedIn Premium‚Äîyet it feels nearly impossible just to land an initial screening. I apply everywhere, not just to top firms or big banks, but also to smaller companies, boutiques, and lesser-known firms, and still, I rarely hear back. At this point, I‚Äôm completely lost on what else I can do besides continuing to sit in front of my laptop and apply to whatever new listing pops up.

I‚Äôve even started considering going back to school for a finance degree, though I hesitate to take on more debt, even if my former college is relatively affordable. I‚Äôve tried networking, cold messaging recruiters, and having coffee chats, but those often feel pointless when it comes to actually landing a role. The entire process is exhausting, and I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I‚Äôm missing something critical or if there‚Äôs another approach I should be taking.

He had sent me a text saying he was sensing some distance and I told him yeah I‚Äôd been wanting to talk about it for a while. I went to his apartment and told him the relationship wasn‚Äôt working for me because we never did anything as a couple and I felt like every time we saw each other it was a group hang out with his friends. I told him the relationship didn‚Äôt feel special or meaningful to me. His problems with the relationship revolved around me not being in a good place in terms of my mental health and him saying he felt like there was no emotional reciprocity: I was always bringing up my feelings and struggles but he never did the same. He said ‚ÄúI think we have our answer‚Äù and despite me saying I‚Äôd be willing to work on things he thought it was best to split. He did say it was a circumstantial breakup and that he had a lot of love for me. I said during the breakup that we should still be friends since the breakup was amicable, but I didn‚Äôt know if that would actually pan out. 
    
     One month after the breakup he texted me saying: ‚ÄúHi Nick! Just checking in. Wanted to reach out earlier but also wanted to give you space. Really hope you‚Äôre doing well and of course been thinking of you a lot. No need to respond, just saying hello üôèüèº.‚Äù I told him I was doing well and wished him the same. So four months after the breakup he texted me to ask how things were going with my parents (this was a problem I was struggling with during the relationship that he noted during the breakup). I told him things were better and I told him I appreciated him reaching out. He then said: ‚ÄúTotally fine if you don‚Äôt want to but was gonna ask if you wanted to get coffee or something when I‚Äôm back / maybe in the new year if December is too busy. If I‚Äôm being totally honest I really don‚Äôt like not having you in my life hah üòÖ¬†.‚Äù 
      
     So we did get drinks and dinner after he got back from traveling. It was nice! We didn‚Äôt discuss the relationship at all and just caught up with each other. He also didn‚Äôt state his intentions for the meetup. Two weeks after we did this I was wanting some clarity so I decided to just text him. I waited two weeks because I wanted to wait for the holidays to be over. 

   I said: ‚ÄúHey! Happy New Year/ Hope you had a nice Christmas! Really glad we got to catch up the other night. To be honest, I had been really missing having you in my life, and when you texted me last month, I wasn‚Äôt sure where your head was at. Just want to make sure we‚Äôre on the same page. Totally cool if you‚Äôd want to talk about it in person.‚Äù 

   He responded: ‚ÄúHi Nick!! Happy new year to you toooo and hope you‚Äôre enjoying!!! Yes, it was so nice to see you! Had a blast!¬† Yeah I was really missing you too. I wanted to reach out earlier but also wanted to give you/us space. I‚Äôd really like to explore a friendship with you if possible but totally understand if that‚Äôs not possible for us rn. And yeah happy to talk about it more in person too at any point.‚Äù 

    Now I‚Äôm feeling confused as it seems like he is sending mixed signals. I did respond to his last message that I‚Äôd totally love to try a friendship because I still value him as a person and he responded he felt the same. Since this conversation we haven‚Äôt spoken once and this was two months ago.

I live in Kansas City, but I've spent most of my life in the NYC metro. I moved here in 2015 for a great job, and I've been here since. I live alone in a nice, modern home in the South Hyde Park area. I love living inside the city and don't see myself living far away from an urban area.

I'm handsome, slim, and in great shape. I have deep, dark eyes and dark hair peppered with greys. I keep my facial hair short and well-groomed. I don't currently have any tattoos or piercings.

I pass regular background checks due to my job so you know I'm not shady. I have no debt or unpaid bills. I'm not addicted to anything. I don't need to be taught basic adult skills like how to care for myself or my home. You won't have to pick up after me or take an overwhelming share of the mental load. I've even kept my plants alive for years! Hopefully, you've got stability and minimal drama in your life. Ideally, you're independent and have a job that you enjoy. 

Politically, I'm a very passionate progressive/liberal. If you have some ""conservative"" values, that may not necessarily be a source of conflict. However, if you're a supporter of the modern Republican party and the MAGA movement, we are not a good fit. I'm not a religious person, but it is okay if you are as long as you can accept that I am not. Lastly, I do not have children and would prefer to date someone without children or whose kids are older and independent.

Except for a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner, I have a happy and comfortable life that doesn't want for anything. I'm capable, confident, independent, and have my life together. I want to meet someone with the intent of developing an enduring relationship. We can proceed at a pace that makes sense for us.

-------------------------
**Some things I enjoy:**

* **Food**: I have a very adventurous palate and love trying new foods. I avoid eating at the same restaurant twice to force myself to broaden my food experiences. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, that's fine! I'm open to the idea of some version of vegetarianism myself. I'm a competent cook, but I don't enjoy cooking. I'd prefer a partner who does. I promise that I'm great at doing the dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen.

* **Fitness**: My health is important, especially as I get older. I exercise regularly and also run. I'd love someone who prioritizes their health and fitness as well.

* **Coffee**: My COVID project was learning to appreciate coffee. My home ""cafe"" looks like a meth lab. I love it. I'll make you a great, fresh cup of pour-over in the morning. 

* **Bread**: Well, now that I'm kind of an expert in fresh pour-over coffee, I've somehow stumbled onto sourdough. I obtained a 220 starter from San Francisco named Doughlene and am raising her child Doughrothy. I've managed to keep her alive (I'm really good at taking care of stuff!) so far and have made various flatbreads. Maybe I'll try an actual loaf soon...

* **Riding**: I own a modern-retro scooter (a la Vespa) and enjoy riding it around the city. Don't worry, you do not need to get on the scooter if you don't want to. I promise I ride safely and with proper gear, and never speed or get on the highway.

* **Therapy**: I have been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and I'm finding it invaluable. After my previous relationships failed, I felt it was important to work on myself and set up future relationships for success. I think everyone would benefit from therapy at various points in their life.

* **Politics**: I'm a ""political junkie"". I frequently read articles and listen to podcasts. I also have a great deal of interest in the Supreme Court.

* **Movies**: I'm a huge cinephile and enjoy going to the theater. 

* **Music**: I love live music. I'm tolerant of most genres but gravitate towards indie, pop, and EDM. I like discovering new music, so if you want to share something you're vibing to and think I might like it, please share it with me.

* **Gaming**: I love to play board games with a group or my partner. I especially like games that involve some sort of social component and intuition, like The Resistance. Going out for trivia nights at bars is also one of my favorite things to do. I sometimes play single-player video games that allow me to stop at any time.

* **Cleanliness**: I'm probably the tidiest man you'll ever meet. I keep both my home and myself tidy. I'm something of a minimalist as well. I am not a big fan of collecting tons of trinkets and knickknacks and would not do well with a hoarder.

* **Drugs**: I have no dependencies or addictions whatsoever. I only drink socially and in moderation. I don't smoke *anything*, and I don't want to date someone who smokes a lot of anything. It smells gross and makes you taste gross. I sometimes enjoy a low-dose edible or a psychedelic. It's okay with me if you casually enjoy alcohol, marijuana, or ""lighter"" drugs more often than I do. 

* **Traveling**: I'm more of a homebody, but I like road trips. I want to drive across the country in a camper someday. I enjoy hiking and ""glamping"", but don't love prolonged camping. I would be agreeable to traveling far and wide with a partner.

It is perfectly fine if you don't share all my interests. I want you to be your own person with your own passions. As long as we align on our core values and ideals, the rest is not all that important.

------------
Please be serious about meeting in person. I don't want to text endlessly. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me via chat or Reddit mail (preferred). **Please include a picture of your face with your message and describe yourself physically**. It's not much different than if we were on a dating app. I **will** ask for a picture if you didn't include one to start. Being weird about this would lead me to believe you're not serious and I'll likely move on.

------------
If you're **long-distance** (i.e. more than 2 hours away) and still interested, feel free to message me, but *only if* you're willing to make an actual effort to meet me in person after chatting for a bit. Ideally, you're in a position where you'll be able to relocate to Kansas City to live with me in a hypothetical future in which we're both committed to one another.

So, I (29M) was talking to my female coworker (34F) who I‚Äôve been working with on and off in different departments together for almost ten years now. Things have been working out lately so that we‚Äôve been working closely together pretty often. Long story short, at work one morning, the conversation got a bit mushy and we basically admitted to each other that we had feelings for each other. We agreed to go grab a coffee together sometime soon and see how things go. I wouldn‚Äôt see her or talk to her again until three days later because we were just off work on different days. When I see her again, she apologizes to me and tells me she wound up booking a last minute trip to Maui and would be going for two weeks the day after tomorrow, and that coffee would have to wait until she came back. So that sucked to hear, but I said okay, sure, I‚Äôll see you when you get back then. I know she actually went on this trip because she was gone from work for two weeks and had posted some pictures of her trip on ig. 

So two long weeks go by, she got back into town two days ago. and yesterday was her first day back at work. However, circumstances had it so that on this particular day we would end up having to work on opposite sides of the warehouse and by the end of my shift we didn‚Äôt get to talk at all. She did walk past me near the end of the day while she was talking to her friend, and she smiled at me and waved. I smiled and waved back. 

Todays circumstances would prove similarly. We worked on opposite sides of the warehouse again, but we did have the chance to have one brief conversation. It was pleasant, but it would be interrupted before we got the chance to talk about our previous plans. I didn‚Äôt get the chance to talk to her again after that. 

So now I‚Äôm not really sure what to do. Two weeks is a lot of time, and I‚Äôm hoping she still feels the same way. I tried to talk myself out of it, but less than an hour ago I did send her a text simply saying ‚Äúhi‚Äù. I regretted sending this text almost immediately. I guess I don‚Äôt want to seem too pushy about it, plus I should probably give her some time to settle back in now that she‚Äôs home, but at the same time, I‚Äôve always been an extremely anxious person and wondering where her heads at rn is killing me a little bit. But I feel like if this really mattered to her, then I would have heard from her by now, but I also know that I tend to overreact to these situations and maybe I just need to chill and give it some time. After all, two days after she got back from her trip isn‚Äôt that long I guess. 

Anyways, that‚Äôs my current situation. I won‚Äôt lie, this is kind of a big deal to me and I want to do what I can to make this work without coming off as too intense, but the whole thing is proving to be very suspenseful. Any advice on how to act from here would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! ",2,1740786666.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

This past week I was in the downtown area working a private catering event. Typically I'm at my home restaurant but decided on making a little extra. During the event, my coworker and I went to Pane vino for a coffee. Upon doing so, a few guys in the kitchen stared at us while talking loud enough for us to hear them, something along the lines of ""All these people just walking in here, who do they think is going to serve them?""
Few minutes later, a waitress appears while we're standing there and just before greeting us mumbles something about a group of people seating themselves outside (More negative remarks about guests) in front of us (guest).

The manager comes out from the back also, stares, then pulls her phone out to text without a word.

Fine, we pay, tip, leave... Bad service won't be back. End of story...

After the event, some of us decide to go to Condado's for happy hour. Two of us leave to go secure a table for about 7 people total. We walk in and there's 2 guys at the bar. We see a high top in the corner that will fit us so we start moving towards it and we ask the person walking around if we seat ourselves. She says ""No!"" then makes us stand there while she wipes off a table. She comes over and we tell her they'll be about 6-7 of us. She grabs menus and trys to seat us at a 4 top near the high top. So we tell her again, ""there'll be about 6 or more."" 
She then ask if we have there phone numbers to call them and ask if they'll be on the way. We can see them from the window at big springs.

Service was slow and rude in both locations.

1j0lto6,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1j0lto6/my_new_fitbit_shows_me_how_my_body_reacts_to/,My new Fitbit shows me how my body reacts to spending time with my MIL!,"I (33F) have had a complicated relationship with my (63F) MIL for the 4 years since I've been having my now fiance (34M). After years of putting up with her insane and manipulative behaviour, I've come to really resent spending time with her and always feel very apprehensive before I see her, nervous about what will happen and whether I will have the confidence to stand up for myself, etc.   
  
I got a Fitbit for Christmas from my mom, and I enjoy looking every morning at my sleep score, HRV, HR, etc, since I've been working on improving my wellness, and this gives me visual confirmation of how well I'm doing. Since Christmas, my HRV has increased significantly (a good thing), and my RHR has gone down (also a good thing).

Anyhow, yesterday I met my MIL for a coffee. I was nervous because the last time we met one-on-one was really uncomfortable, with her just being upset and pushy with me about the fact that we were considering having a two-year engagement instead of one year. Nothing really bad happened this time, except she commented negatively on the makeup I was wearing but I couldn't care less about that. I looked at my stats in my Fitbit app this morning, which alerts me to abnormalities, and noticed that my sleep had been ok, but that my HRV had dropped 20 points and my RHR had gone up by 5 beats per minute, and my readiness score for the day is very low (25/100). I looked into my HR throughout the day and noticed that while we were sat for coffee, my heart rate was in the ""moderate exercise"" zone (120-140bpm)!

I thought this was super interesting, and it led me to look at my stats from other days I've spent time with her since I've had my Fitbit. Turns out, spending time around her seems to consistently impact my physical well-being! I always have a higher HR, lower HRV, poorer sleep, and lower daily readiness and stress management scores the day after I see her (since these are measured overnight) and higher HR the day of seeing her. So crazy!   
  
I don't have a question or anything, I just wanted to share what I noticed and was curious if anyone else has noticed this as well. If you have a Fitbit or any kind of smartwatch, it might be worth looking at!       ",9,1740786212.0,JUSTNOMIL,2,1.0,False

It is so hard but I want the best for my baby. I am an overthinker and this pregnancy is so hard on me mentally. I worry a LOT. Today my husband wanted to go to KFC after a coffee date. I didn't want to because of diet and said so but I gave in cause I was hungry and annoyed. I do not trust places with chicken and I can get obsessive with food safety and this KFC is new in our town and the reviews are not te best. I haven't eaten a single piece of deli meat, lettuce, cabbage or anything that could be a risk in over 6 months. Well, not only did I ruin my 2 weeks of health progress by eating shit food, on my 3rd piece of qurrito (it says in the description it's a tortilla with fried chicken, cheese and BBQ sauce) I realized there was some kind of undisclosed ham or salami behind the cheese and chicken. To say I lost my shit when we got to the car is an understatement, I could've divorced him on the spot for talking me into eating stupid KFC. I cried for an hour thinking I harmed my baby somehow and am so mad at him for going there in the first place. I couldn't forgive myself if anything happened to her because of our ignorance.

1j0lq31,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1j0lq31/should_i_pass_this_student/,Should I pass this student?,"I'm a preceptor on a busy surgical unit, and I currently have a capstone (senior level) nursing student with me. She has done 7 shifts with me so far. She is doing an online RN program, and has never worked as a CNA. Also has something of a military background, though I don't know the specifics. She told me her plan was to blow straight through school to being an NP and never actually work as an RN. 

The first couple shifts she was late (like 7:30 late and completely missed shift change/report) and also didn't have a stethoscope (!!!). She always asks if she can go get coffee/breakfast during the busiest morning hours of the shift. She had literally NO idea how to do assessments. I mean, none. I had to send her youtube videos to watch to get her up to speed. I have spent the majority of our clinical time showing her mundane CNA level shit...bed changes, transfers, etc. She often is clueless about the meds ordered and why, and seems to know very little about common diagnoses (CHF, PNA, etc).

As time went on I grew more impatient with her. She came to me for EVERY tiny thing. I started responding to her questions with, ""I don't know. You're the nurse. What do YOU think you should do?"" (not to be mean at all, just to start pushing her with the critical thinking). She never has any good answers, and relies on me to tell her whether she should give someone tylenol. 

Yesterday I had a ridiculous assignment with 3 extremely heavy pts, plus 2 lighter ones on the other side of the unit. Just out of pure desperation I told her to take the 2 easy ones so I could get the others stabilized quickly. Seemed like things were going well. At 4 pm I finally had time to look at her charting on the other 2. One of her pts had a BP of 201/112 in the morning. I asked her why she hadn't told me this...?!? ""Well I treated it. I gave him 10 mg of PO lisinopril (scheduled)"". His next recorded BP at noon was 197/110. She never told me any of this, nor had ANY concern when I became alarmed over it. Granted, it was partially my fault for trusting a student and not monitoring her, but again I was DROWNING with the other 3 pts. Shouldn't a senior level nursing student at least be able to identify abnormal VS?!? 

So...her instructor has told me it is 100% based on my review of her if she passes or fails. I feel she is light years away from being ready to practice as an RN. And again, she seems to not care a ton about her clinicals as she is planning ""to just be an NP anyway"". 

I hate to fail someone who has invested the time, money, and effort...but holy shit. I don't want it on my conscience either that I promoted someone who absolutely isn't ready. What should I do?!??",231,1740785936.0,nursing,155,0.96,False
1j0lq1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigdaddywit92/comments/1j0lq1e/my_story/,My Story,"Kyle Witkowski threatened me, my child‚Äôs school, and my livelihood. I have known of him since 2021 when we exchanged some messages through Facebook messenger. That initial conversation was not pleasant. My friends at the time had told me of his father, The ‚ÄúThief of Hearts‚Äù (Ken Witkowski) and said that he was bad news as well. I saw his TikTok at the time, and saw what he posted, ‚Äúthirst traps‚Äù as he admittedly called them. He told me that women loved him. That he had a huge following, and became nasty with me quite quickly when I accused him of being a not so good person. Back then I didn‚Äôt personally know him, and this is important as I explain this next recent part. 

Fast forward to last year (2024). I had seen him at TPALS, and I was pretty shocked when I did. He was hanging out with people I knew, talking outside, and I asked if he remembered our previous interaction, as it wasn‚Äôt a good one. He didn‚Äôt remember and couldn‚Äôt even remember my name so we left it at that. I thought because he was at TPALS and had said that he was ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù back then, that maybe he had really changed. In the program I follow, people change every day, so I thought this was possible. 

So fast forward, to Christmas 2024. My stepfather passed away the day after Christmas, and I posted on Facebook looking for help cleaning out his house and recommendations for dumpster companies. Kyle messaged me offering his help, and even offered to pay for the dumpster personally. I thought this was very nice of him, but he started getting pushy pretty quickly and wanted to come see the property, which we weren‚Äôt ready for yet. After I stopped answering his texts about it, and wouldn‚Äôt let him come see the property he said ‚ÄúNever mind, I tried being a friend. I don‚Äôt wanna bother you if you need the help you‚Äôll ask for the help I was gonna pay for the dumpster for you. I‚Äôm not gonna look like a creep or a fool. Keep texting you and offering my service to make sure you‚Äôre OK‚Äù 

So at this point I was taken back. And I don‚Äôt message him again until he texted me about another one of my fb posts that was about my mom‚Äôs sick dog. Offering to pay for him to go to an emergency vet. I said no. He asked me to call him. I didn‚Äôt. 

Fast forward to recently. February of this year (2025). He messaged me urgently looking for a cleaner. I was on the clock, driving to pick up my patient‚Äôs prescriptions, and on the phone with my employer when his text popped up on my phone. I didn‚Äôt have his number saved so only the number came up, no name. I didn‚Äôt know it was him who was asking when I slid down on my phone and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it‚Äù. When I realized it was him, I had a weird feeling but I couldn‚Äôt use the extra cash and thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just being paranoid, I‚Äôll clean his house and it‚Äôll be fine, he‚Äôs offered me so much help in the past, he‚Äôs gotta be a good guy‚Äù 

Well I was wrong. I told him I had to bring my daughter to the my parent‚Äôs house and then I would be able to come clean. So I pick my daughter up from school and he texts and asks if I want to get her McDonald‚Äôs before I bring her, and offers to pay for it. I say that‚Äôs a great idea, but decline him paying for it. He sends me $20 on cashapp anyway. 

I drop my daughter off and start heading up to his address. By the time I get there it‚Äôs already dark, and we still have to go to the store to get the cleaning supplies and to rent the rug shampooer. So he shows me what he needs me to clean and then we get in his truck to go to the store. 

He asks if I want a coffee first and I say that‚Äôd be great. Then we get to GIANT for the rug shampooer. I watch as he throws around his charm to the 60-70 year old lady, asking if he can get a discount and calling her beautiful. I found it funny, he made the lady laugh. And everyone was in good spirits. He refused to buy the cleaner for the shampooer at giant because he thought he could get it for cheaper at the dollar store. 

On the way to the dollar store, he talks about how so many people judge him for being his father. And that I did back in 2021. And that people mistook him for his father because they look so alike. He showed me the news coverage on his father and told me he hates his dad because he scams women. and steals his girlfriends. 

He tells me that he is different and wants nothing to do with his father. That he HELPS single moms and is the opposite of his father, but people still judge him for it. 

He talks about being isolated and not having many friends and being depressed. I start to feel bad that I ever judged him, and thought I was so wrong about him. I even apologized to him for judging him, and told him I would be his friend. 

Then he wanted to stop at the convenient, so I sent him $12 to grab me a pack of cigarettes while he was in there. He got upset that I did that and said he would have paid for it.

We finally get back to his house to start cleaning by 7pm. I set up the shampooer and got everything ready and he says to just let him do the shampooing and just get started on everything else. So I do the floors downstairs and mop them a few times and then we go upstairs and he shampoos the rugs up there while I clean the bathroom and wipe down the kids room. 

When we‚Äôre all done, we‚Äôre talking about decor and I mention that home goods has awesome stuff and I‚Äôve been wanting to go. So he says well do you want to go right now they‚Äôre open until 9. I agreed. He said he would buy me some stuff from there instead of paying me, because I told him paying me wasn‚Äôt necessary, I was just happy to help (people don‚Äôt understand this, but in the program this is what we do. We help eachother)

So we get in his truck.  He says he wants to stop at Burlington first to get bath towels. So we do that, and he grabs a garbage can for his bathroom and towels and a few things. I start to look at a robe, and he tells me to grab it, he‚Äôll pay for it for helping him clean. He does and he thanks me profusely because ‚Äúif I hadn‚Äôt been there, he wouldn‚Äôt have cleaned his house and it would have bothered him so much‚Äù. 

Then we go to home goods. He finds a treasure chest and puts a one dollar bill in it for someone to find which I found pretty cool, and then starts calling me his wife and joking around with the employees. I was having fun, even when he started degrading me as his wife ‚Äúas a joke‚Äù 

He insists on buying a stool for my friend when I mentioned that she had broke hers, from home goods. It was $7. Then we left. I thought this was the end of our night but then he said he really wanted soup and he just HAD to find it. He stopped at Sheetz. They didn‚Äôt have soup. so he went to TGI Fridays and got it there. I kept saying I didn‚Äôt want soup. He kept pushing for me to get something. I picked out some soup. 

He drove back to his house and we talked for a little while in his truck. I felt bad for him. That I had judged him. I kept insisting that I was just happy to help and he didn‚Äôt have to pay me but he gave me $60 anyway. I left and when I got home he called me and told me he gave me the wrong soup. 

Then the next day my patient called me off of work, and Kyle said ‚ÄúWell after seeing your frustration there‚Äôs a place I want to show you, maybe you‚Äôve been there before but it‚Äôs at the local park down the road and will go grab Panera. But wear a jacket cuz god for bid your always freezing haha üòÜ ‚Äú 

I agreed to go. He said he had spent all night til 4am going through every single one of my TikTok videos. Maybe I should have found this odd, but I thought my content just really intrigued him.

I tell him to just pick me up at my place so I could go home and get ready first. He agreed and then I let him up. People are really focusing on this part and I want everyone to understand that this wasn‚Äôt some random stranger I just met. We had many mutual friends and he played his part good. I thought he was working a program and a changed man since the 2021 interaction. 

He switched it up and said I needed to find my inner child and brought me to the arcade in the viewmont mall. He had to stop at CVS first and got mad at me for paying for my own gum after he just told the cashier that I was using him for his money and that he pays me alimony and I‚Äôm his wife. I watched him completely charm a female bank employee inside of PNC bank to go against policy and do something for him. At this point I‚Äôm starting to pick up on the charm and see red flags. 

After the arcade we walked around and went into a store that was having a sale. I was looking at dresses, and he was telling me what would look good on me. I ended up picking out two dresses that were on sale for $10, and he insisted on paying for them.

I was started to think I was being love bombed by this point. It was all adding up and I was getting increasingly more suspicious‚Ä¶ but he kept saying I ‚Äúdeserved a day for me‚Äù and I really wanted to believe he was just being a good guy and saw a single mom who needed a break‚Ä¶ I was wrong. 

While we were walking out of the mall he asked if he could go with me to pick up my daughter. I said it‚Äôs not a good idea. I don‚Äôt really bring people around her. He says stop thinking about it so much, that it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre strangers and it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre dating. He brought up how my old counselor (who is his counselor) kept telling him he just needed to stop thinking so much about things. He kept pushing and I just stayed silent. 

After that, it was snowing outside quite a bit.  We went to Panera. Both got a pretty cheap combo meal. This is when he started talking about ‚Äúwarping children‚Äôs minds‚Äù that that‚Äôs all you have to do and that it‚Äôs easy. He said he could make my daughter want the opposite of what she wanted, ‚Äújust watch‚Äù, 

So at this point I‚Äôm pretty certain of the red flags and start to get increasingly more uncomfortable. 

I fired back with ‚Äúoh is that what you do with women?‚Äù And he said no are you kidding me ‚Ä¶ he asked if he‚Äôs forced me into anything today and I said well now I‚Äôm not so sure. 

I thought we‚Äôd be done at this point, but he said if I didn‚Äôt pick a place to go he would. That it was ‚Äúmy day‚Äù. 

I said Walmart so I could get my protein powder, and some things I needed for my daughter. He said target would be better. Target ended up not having anything I needed which he was pretty annoyed with, and he started getting a little aggressive at this point. 

So we had to go to Walmart. I paid for my stuff and he got a pillow. I was pretty much done for the day. The truck was sliding everywhere because the roads were bad and he brought up picking up my daughter again. Saying ‚Äúif it were my kids I would have picked them up already, do you just wanna go there now?‚Äù I said no. To go back to my house. I didn‚Äôt know how to get rid of this dude at this point. I was tired, and it was my first day being off of cigarettes and nicotine all together. 

He was intimidating me at this point. Telling me that I ‚Äúhad a guy for every thing‚Äù and that it‚Äôs a good thing we‚Äôre just friends, because he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt like to compete‚Äù , to which I said no one asked you to. 

He offered to carry my stuff up for me to my apartment when we got back, which I allowed. But he still wasn‚Äôt leaving. He started picking things up around my house and ‚Äúcleaning up for me‚Äù throwing around small degrading remarks. 

It was finally time for me to go get my daughter from school, and he just got in my car with me, and said we‚Äôll go get something to eat after picking her up‚Ä¶ at this point I‚Äôm super uncomfortable. I didn‚Äôt tell him he could come. He was very pushy. Anytime I tried to form an opinion, he shut it down. I wanted this day to end. He informed me that he knew people at the place my daughter went school. That his own children used to go there and he worked there for a day or something. That he was going to come inside with me and say hi to them. 

So we pick up my daughter and no one recognized him. He didn‚Äôt say hi to anyone. He assured me that all kids always love him, but right away my daughter did not. This made him mad. Especially when he tried to ‚Äúwarp her mind‚Äù and make her want what HE wanted to go eat. 

He completely jumped into the ‚Äúdad‚Äù role and was talking to my daughter like he was her father. Telling her what to do, telling us both what we‚Äôre going to do at this point. Where we‚Äôre going, it was all up to him. My daughter was not having it. She did not like him and wasn‚Äôt listening to him, so he started going in on me about how I coddle her too much and ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why she‚Äôs being like this‚Äù 

At the diner my daughter starts crying and whispers to me that she doesn‚Äôt like him. To which he told her ‚Äúthen I‚Äôm not getting you a present‚Äù This broke my heart and at this point I‚Äôm like I really need to get away from this man. But I was scared. So many things were buzzing through my mind from past experiences with my ex husband and crazy ex‚Äôs. I started to tear up too and I just wanted to get out of there. He was the one calling all of the shots. Telling us all what to do, I felt SO stuck. He tells them we‚Äôre leaving and that he‚Äôll give them a big tip for ‚Äúdealing with US‚Äù 

I felt like at every point where I should have or could have had support from someone around me to get help I didn‚Äôt because he had already charmed them and made himself look like a perfect gentleman. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt speak up, like no one would help me and then what? What would he do then in retaliation? I had been here so many times in my life before and I couldn‚Äôt believe I was here again or how I even got here‚Ä¶.

So we leave the diner and I start to think it‚Äôs okay, he‚Äôs going home. But he tells the diner he‚Äôll be close by and is going to call them for a takeout order for himself. Stuck again. 

He comes upstairs with us. I make my daughter what she wanted to eat. He never orders food from the diner. He starts in on both of us again. Telling me I have a man for everything, and making comments. Playing the role of my daughter‚Äôs father. 

My neighbor then knocks on my door. A man. And where I could have asked for help, I didn‚Äôt feel like I could. He had brought me a meal he made as a thank you for helping him out the other day when his water got shut off. I found myself explaining to Kyle that this isn‚Äôt a usual occurrence since he said ‚ÄúI have a man for everything‚Äù and this man has brought me a meal. When I owe him NO explanation. But I made sure I kept my neighbor around for a little longer. And told him to come in. 

Kyle finally gets a call from a Tom guy and tells me he‚Äôs leaving around 730/8. I am so relieved. He lets himself out, and I text my neighbor. I tell him if he ever sees that man around here again to please tell me. He asks if everything is okay and I tell him how nervous I was and I just don‚Äôt want him here. 

I immediately call my best friend to get everything off of my chest. She tells me about her friend that he stalked a while back. I get even more nervous now because he knows where I live now. 

Kyle immediately starts texting me. Showing all of the money he just won at the machine gambling. I answer him normally because now I‚Äôm freaking out that I let this man know where I live and what if he retaliates if I don‚Äôt answer him after everything ‚Äúhe did for me‚Äù today‚Ä¶ he tries to call me. I don‚Äôt answer. I tell him I‚Äôm busy with my daughter. Then I speak to the woman who my friend clued me in about that he had stalked some time ago. 

She tells me everything and now I‚Äôm getting nervous. I don‚Äôt answer Kyle. And this is where what I had feared happens. He asks me out, and I decline. He keeps texting and texting and texting. I don‚Äôt answer. On Sunday night he starts threatening me. He asks for the $39 he spent on me back. And when I don‚Äôt immediately send it, he gets mad. He says ‚Äúsend it or you‚Äôll see how far I can go with this‚Äù and threatens to use his connections to get me and everyone in my building kicked out. 

At this point I‚Äôm losing my mind. Wondering how this all happened so fast. Wondering how he switched up so quickly and why? Fearing for me and my daughter‚Äôs safety. So I make a Facebook post about it, just in case anything happens. Well that fired him up even more. He threatens to press charges on ME the next day, Monday. For making that post. 

So I go to the police for help. He won‚Äôt stop with the threats, and now multiple numbers are calling me, saying I‚Äôm a dumb bitch and telling me to take the post down. He says the cops won‚Äôt help me because he already went to them and that they‚Äôre pressing charges on me. He tries to scare me out of going. But I still went and asked for harassment charges to be filed. I tell them that I‚Äôm scared. 

I didn‚Äôt realize that my post would get over 300 shares and women from all over coming out with their stories. It blew up. I had so much support. So many women who were also victimized by him. I had no clue. Later that night the Scranton PD called me and told me that I needed to stop posting. That Kyle was trying to press charges on me and that they were getting too many calls over there about my posts. I asked if they were telling me to take down my post. They said no, just stop making new ones. I said I didn‚Äôt make new ones. I only made one. However, everyone else is sharing is and coming out with their own stories. I don‚Äôt have control over that. He said oh, it was said that you were making more posts. I felt like I didn‚Äôt even have the support of the police department now‚Ä¶ 

Later that night, I was getting an influx of messages from women. Telling me their stories. And then I started getting messages with video attachments. 

It was of Kyle, live on TikTok telling all of his followers where my daughter goes to school, at what times, and saying ‚Äúif anything happens to that school, I‚Äôm here in bed *wink*‚Äù at this point I completely break down. 

I start crying and turn my phone off. Thinking ‚Äúwhat have I done?‚Äù Previously that day, while everything was very overwhelming, I felt I had support from hundreds of people. I felt scared but also strong enough to follow through and make sure he gets brought to justice so he doesn‚Äôt keep doing this to more women. Now I started to feel even more scared, lost, and completely destroyed inside. 

My daughter‚Äôs safety being threatened did me in. And Scranton PD wasn‚Äôt answering my messages. Kyle was talking to thousands of people on TikTok telling them I was a drug addict who sold my daughters bed for money, and now threatening to shoot people in the head and threatening my daughters school‚Ä¶ the thoughts start spiraling like how did I get here? Am I doing the right thing speaking up? Am I safe? When is this going to stop? Is it going to just keep getting worse? Are the police even going to help me? Or will they try to silence me again and take his side? 

The next day, a bunch of fellow concerned mothers messaged me. They had taken it upon themselves to go to the police with his video. Some even reported his live to the FBI online. Dunmore police told me it was out of their jurisdiction if I already had an open case with Scranton PD. Scranton PD had told these other concerned mothers that they weren‚Äôt going to do anything about it, and were allegedly ‚Äúnasty‚Äù to them. 

When I dropped my daughter at school that morning, I let the head of the school know what was going on and to please keep our children safe. They assured me they would and to keep my phone close in case they needed to call me. They did call, and I sent the videos over to them so the FBI or other law enforcement could handle it. Still never heard back from Scranton PD. 

My harassment charges definitely stuck, as they are on his PA docket. But I still feel scared. He doesn‚Äôt stop. And he won‚Äôt. People keep telling me I have no reason to be scared. That he won‚Äôt really do anything. But the reason I‚Äôm scared is because of how far I‚Äôve been willing to take this. Every other time, he has allegedly intimidated the other women into shutting up, and not going further with charging him with anything. 

He wasn‚Äôt able to do that with me. I kept pushing, and am pushing other women to do the same. I know how unhinged he can be now, and that‚Äôs what is scary. The fact that his usual antics weren‚Äôt able to intimidate me into shutting up. So what will he do next? ",2,1740785932.0,bigdaddywit92,0,1.0,False

1j0loef,https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/1j0loef/how_is_yale_these_days/,How is Yale these days?,"So, background:

A few decades ago now, I joined my high school debate club.  I had a great time with my friends debating the issues of the day, policies and just ideas in general.

We went on a few occasions to Yale for a Model Congress that students there at the time organized (and I even won a gavel!).  I fondly recall the campus, all the intriguing architecture, the grand libraries, the house system, etc.  

While there, I also really enjoyed New Haven.  Being in high school away from home for one of my first experiences ever, I thought it was so cool to be just simply having cafe au lait in a town like New Haven, and talking about grand ideas over a slice of some of the best pizza I ever had.

I haven't thought of those experiences for a while now, but as I was just making myself a cup of coffee, I thought back to what great times I had.

So, fill me in, Yale students or grads or just those with some kind of connection.  How's it going there?

1j0ll3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1j0ll3e/unexpected_healing/,Unexpected healing,"Recently, I had an appointment at the hospital to discuss the results of my MRI scan for my torn groin. It happened last summer while playing football. One month before the MRI (I had already been in pain for months), I had an ultrasound scan indicating that there was a lot of fluid in the tendon, which suggested there was still an injury (consistent with my pain whenever I made a wrong movement). During that month, I did my workouts, tried not to use the groin too much, but I could feel it being extra tense after workouts. Then, two weeks in advance, I told myself: ‚ÄòThis pain is illusory, my groin is recovered, and this is just psychological pain.‚Äô

I was planning to do a SATS session on this matter, but I totally forgot. Then, on the day of the MRI scan, while walking into the hospital entrance, I thought, ‚ÄòWhy the hell didn‚Äôt I remember to do my SATS to fix this??‚Äô So, as I was entering, I quickly captured the feeling of being very excited and happy because, in my imagination, the doctor had just told me it was completely healed. I truly felt myself screaming with happiness from within because I could finally play football again after six months. Then I just sat down in the waiting room, completely forgot what I had imagined, drank a coffee, and just chilled out. I actually got a bit frustrated because it took 40 minutes longer than expected before it was my turn to see the doctor.

So, I walked in, we sat down, and the doctor told me that he was really surprised by the MRI results because there was not a single indication of an injury, contradicting all earlier test results and the pain I had experienced. I was surprised (a part of me was still prepared for bad news), but at the same time, I was laughing because, of course, I knew what had happened here‚Äîanother part of me actually believed I was healed.
I walked out of the hospital with the exact excitement I had imagined.

So, I only briefly imagined/told myself twice that I was healed. I was pretty detached (because I was already okay with the fact that this might take a couple of months more).

What made a difference this time is that one or two weeks ago, something clicked. I finally, after years, truly understood the concept of the feeling, which is acceptance and knowing who I Am, and therefore knowing that what I decree is truth. Because I am the only one in the whole universe who can decide something about my sense of self, and that will reflect sooner or later.
I somehow started to see 3D more and more as a dream and understood the true order of things, which was a game-changer in detaching from 3D and eliminating/reducing doubts. That‚Äôs why when I told myself my groin was healed, part of me knew that I had decreed it, so it must be true. The part of me that didn‚Äôt believe this was easy to observe and classify as just noise from the ego.

TL;DR:
- Healed a torn groin with just two quick moments of confirming to myself that it was healed.
- Understanding helped me accept who I actually Am, which helped me detach from 3D and know that what I decree is truth.",10,1740785534.0,NevilleGoddard,0,1.0,False

Long version:
I am 21f, living first time outside of my parents house in an all female apartment. I live in an apartment for people who cope with mental health issues (so am I). I have lived there for 6 months.

I have three roomates: S, R and J.
S has been in the apartment the longest (2 years), then R (1.5 years), lastly J (1 year).
S and R are very good friends. J is introverted and spends most of the time alone.

In the beginning I was friends with R and bought food with her. At some point I realized I am losing money (she bought more with our money), so I decided to split. Then her view on me changed.

It started with untasteful jokes from R, passive aggressive remarks and overall bad attitude. Continued with her touching my stuff in the kitchen, and this week us yelling at each other after she said at our apartment gathering that my snoring at the living room interrupted her coffee making smh. Apparently it's against the rules to sleep in the living room.

In the beginning J, R and I cooked for each other. I am vegetarian so they didn't really put effort to make things for me, so I decided to stop cooking for everyone and just for myself. J&R cook now but also for S who stopped cooking for others. Doesn't  seem fair. 

This week aswell, S complained about the scent diffuser in my room, saying it spreads over the apartment and gives her dissociation. Can a scent give you dissociation? Do nice smells cause anxiety? Asking me to close the door all the time. 

Lastly, after I complained about J washing dishes loudly at midnight, that she stored for days at her room, she has decided that she doesn't want us to use her dishes anymore and now we need to bring plates, cups, silverware, bowls and more.

I don't sleep well there at all, usually sleeping well at my parents' house on the weekends. This week having awful nightmares. 

Am I just overreacting or is this just dreadful?
Should I move?
Is it worth it to put up with the constant fighting?

I am very accustomed being with a wide range of women. I also was in female dominant profession:  libraries and e-records mgmt.  However my corporate client groups that I served, for some employers, were predominantly men:  firefighters, fire chiefs, engineers, law, etc.  From early in my career onward, I got used to being part of /socializing on the job with a group of guys.  Although generally coffee group chat was polite and congenial, sometimes there were side-jokes/horseplay semi-insults that some guys indulged.

In the cycling world, it is more mixed but earlier in 1980-1990's where I lived/biked, the group leaders, etc. and participation there were more men.

I also worked on a major engineering construction project site for 3 years, where there were way more men.

I also participate for last 15 yrs. in an American and male dominant cycling forum. Only 6 women, and approx. 50 active men.

When there is no sexual interest/no flirting online, then a woman regular online participant will get some useful advice....and some laughs.  I honestly believe women groups really do interact with far less horseplay and sarcasm.

So I've gotten advice from my friendly online cycling guys...most are married, with tiny handful who are single.  Age range early 40's to 85 (a delightful Scottish guy).  With their light advice, they have helped me keep perspective.  This group is quite different from our forums.

Bio part has some things redacted, but this is the outcome. I‚Äôm looking for some other opinions!)

Dear Agent,
I‚Äôm excited to share By the Harbor, a 65,000 word New Adult Contemporary Romance infused with the sibling‚Äôs best friend trope found in This Summer Will Be Different and the undeniable heartfelt connection and exploration of grief found within Beach Read, depicting Jade‚Äôs journey of healing and love in the aftermath of loss. With themes of self-discovery and second chances, it will appeal to readers who enjoy the works of Emily Henry, Carley Fortune, and Abby Jimenez.

Being stereotyped as the angry Latina girlfriend for five years wasn‚Äôt the type of relationship Jade Mendoza had hoped for‚Äîor wanted. And she definitely never envisioned returning to her charming coastal hometown burdened with grief and guilt. Since the death of Levi, the boyfriend who confined her to his expectations and his parents‚Äô racist ideals, Jade has avoided confronting the past.

But a year after Levi‚Äôs death, Jade is back. With her dreams of a successful career starting to feel too out of reach and past friendships strained, her family supports her return, but it‚Äôs her brother‚Äôs best friend, Declan, who truly complicates everything. Eight years after their brief teenage romance that occurred before Declan joined the military, Jade discovers he‚Äôs back home for good too. And he‚Äôs undeniably attractive in his firefighter uniform, igniting feelings that Jade had tried to leave behind. Which is annoying, since the fire station is right across the street from the coffee shop Jade gets hired at, and Declan can‚Äôt seem to leave her alone.

Despite Declan‚Äôs persistent charm and their deepening feelings for each other, Jade struggles with the tether connecting her to Levi. With the help of Levi‚Äôs younger sister, she creates a list of tasks designed to reclaim her life, including falling for Declan‚Äîa task that might be accomplished more easily than expected.

As Jade confronts her grief and begins to rediscover her true self, she learns to let go of the weight of the past.

1j0lc51,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j0lc51/i_found_so_many_lookalikes/,I found so many look-alikes,"I grew up in a small community in southern Bavaria, Germany. ¬†There were only eight other kids in my age group, so the school had to slap together several classes into one. This was the countryside, where people had to band together to clear the streets in the winter. We made do.

I remember the day I left to study at the university. We had to cover the road in pine branches and gravel to get some kind of friction, as the car tires kept sliding on the ice. Three of our neighbors were out there, all helping to push and cheer.

I barely made it to the train before the doors closed. By some strange twist of fate, I ended up next to a girl from the class above me; Alice.

¬†

Alice came from a big family. Eight siblings, none of them born more than a year apart. You‚Äôd be excused for mistaking one of them for another. But Alice was special; every girl wanted to be like her; myself included. Not only was she pretty, but she was ambitious. Brilliant, even. She could talk her way out of everything, and people were lining up to help her with whatever project she made up. She was the most likely of us to succeed, according to, well‚Ä¶ everyone.

I ended up next to her on the train. We barely knew each other. We had never really talked. But we were heading for something greater, and we wore our nerves on our sleeves. And there was one curious detail we had in common; our necklaces. It was a small amber-colored stone encircled by a silver disc, marked with 12 distinct notches; like a clock, or the months of the year. I noticed it, and Alice did too.

‚ÄúWe got the same one,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you get it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think Emma makes them,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúShe tricked my mom into buying one.‚Äù

‚ÄúWeird how Emma doesn‚Äôt wear one of her own.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre kinda dumb.‚Äù

I just blurted it out, but it got a laugh out of her. Alice always seemed so composed, but for that one moment she was just like me.

¬†

I didn‚Äôt see Alice for a long time after that. I studied photojournalism. I wanted to be the next Niedringhaus, or Kempkens. I fell in love with my camera, and a man, and moved to the big city to live a metropolitan life. I ran into a whole bunch of almost‚Äôs. I almost got married. I almost became a mother. I almost got a promotion. But that whole box of almost‚Äôs fell out the window, and I ended up without anything. Not even my camera.

Alice, on the other hand, was on the up-and-up. She entered a talent show under the name ‚ÄòDorothea‚Äô. She got pretty far, too. It was impressive, in a way; I couldn‚Äôt hear her Bavarian accent anymore. After the show ended, she became a presenter on a local morning show. Nothing big, and I don‚Äôt even know if anyone watched it, but she was there.

After a series of bad choices, I decided to move back to my old town. I got a place near Rothenburg ob der Tauber and did some side work for a small government office. But after downsizing, I was once again left without a plan.

¬†

This whole story started with the dumbest thing; a selfie.

I was standing outside a caf√© and took a selfie when I noticed someone in the background. Alice, or ‚ÄòDorothea‚Äô. I barely recognized her with her darkened hair and muted colors. I turned around and got a proper picture of her since I already had my phone up. I was going to send it to my mom just to say ‚Äúlook who I saw‚Äù today. A couple seconds later, she turned around and noticed me, phone in hand. She raised an eyebrow and walked up to me.

‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Ä¶ Alice,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúFrom school.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlice?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt heard that in a while.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, we- you were a class ahead of me. We had the same necklace.‚Äù

Her hand immediately shot up to her neck, where I noticed her still wearing that same necklace. The amber stone, the silver disc. And for a moment, I could see her as that ambitious young woman again. She had that same fire. And I realized that even now, years later, I could see why people wanted to be her.

¬†

‚ÄúWhy did you take my picture?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúSorry, I was just- it was a surprise to see you,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIs that okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, of course,‚Äù she smiled. ‚ÄúDo you take a lot of pictures?‚Äù

‚ÄúI used to,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúBut you can‚Äôt make much money with a phone camera.‚Äù

She gave me a long, curious look. She considered something, crossing her arms. She looked back on the caf√©, then at me. I think she could tell my phone was a couple of years out of date.

‚ÄúWe should talk,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou know, catch up.‚Äù

¬†

We had a small lunch. Well, I did, she‚Äôd already had hers. I told her about my recent misfortunes, and she listened patiently. There wasn‚Äôt much to say about her life; it‚Äôd been the talk of the town, and most of us knew her story one way or another. She was well aware.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre looking for work, I got something I‚Äôm working on,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd I could use someone I can trust.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? What‚Äôs it about?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rather personal,‚Äù she sighed. ‚ÄúBut all expenses paid.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Alice, I-‚Äú

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Thea now,‚Äù she corrected. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, yeah,‚Äù I nodded. ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

She sent me her contact info, and we decided to meet at her place later that night.

¬†

Now, for those who don‚Äôt know, Rothenburg has a quite peculiar architecture. Walking along those streets after being away for so long feels like stepping back in time. The medieval-like cobblestone streets are lined with traditional Germanic houses. There‚Äôs even a stone wall. It‚Äôs not all medieval, of course, but it really sets a different tone. Coming home from a larger city, it didn‚Äôt just feel like I was back where I belonged; it felt like going back in time.

Alice lived a bit on the outskirts. If you follow one of the residential roads far enough, you get to a turnabout that splits into two; one road leads to a private property, lined with a waist-high metal fence and spotlights with movement detectors. A bit further in is a surprisingly large one-story building. A somewhat modern yellow house with white square windows and a tall gray A-shaped roof; complete with a garden on the east side. It was too cold to grow anything now, but a tired fountain still puttered water from the stone of two wrestling cherubs.

Alice greeted me by the door long before I knocked. She was eager to see me, and I could tell she was a bit more comfortable now. Maybe she didn‚Äôt like being seen in public. I hadn‚Äôt considered just how rude I‚Äôd been; taking pictures of her when she‚Äôs out minding her own business.

¬†

She invited me in and offered me a Tegernseer. I settled for some coffee. I was surprised to see how sparingly decorated her house was; maybe she wasn‚Äôt making as much money as I thought. That, and I had no idea she lived alone. I‚Äôd heard rumors of her dating.

We sat down in her living room as she pushed a little black bag towards me. I recognized the brand immediately. I could tell what kind of camera it was before opening it.

‚ÄúFigures you‚Äôre good with a camera,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúYou want me to take your picture?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI can take pretty good portraits.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù she laughed. ‚ÄúNo, not my picture. It‚Äôs a long story, but‚Ä¶ hear me out.‚Äù

¬†

Not only did Alice grow up in a big family, apparently it was even bigger. Turns out Alice had a different father than four of her other siblings, and some stayed with the other parent. All in all, it was a group of twelve kids; some whom she grew up with, some which she didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúI moved back here to reconnect with that side of the family,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI only learned of them recently.‚Äù

‚ÄúMust‚Äôve been a shock,‚Äù I said. ‚Äú I can‚Äôt imagine.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs only half of it.‚Äù

She grabbed her coffee cup and put it to her lips, but it burned her. She put it down, keeping her composure.

‚ÄúApparently, I have a twin sister,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúAnd she lives around these parts.‚Äù

¬†

As Alice explained it, her sister had been forced to stay with the father as part of a divorce settlement. But she didn‚Äôt know her name, and thought she might‚Äôve gotten married; thus changing her last name. She‚Äôd contacted city officials, and everyone in her family, but to no avail. The only lead she had was that this woman, her twin, still lived somewhere in the region.

‚ÄúI think she works in a bakery, or a caf√©,‚Äù Alice continued. ‚ÄúA friend of a friend swore they saw her at a booth at the Christmas Market.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what do you need me for?‚Äù

‚ÄúI want you to help me find her,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI want you to do just like what you did with me; to look for her. And if you find someone who even remotely looks like her, take a picture, and come back to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds a bit far-fetched,‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of bakeries, and even more caf√©s.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will pay you very generously,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAll equipment. Gas. Anything. I just need an eye out there so I can focus on other things without feeling like I‚Äôm abandoning the idea of her.‚Äù

She took my hand, and I saw the necklace jingle back and forth. There was an honest plea in her voice. But then again ‚Äì she was media trained, and an aspiring actress.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs just a glimpse,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúI just want to know she‚Äôs real.‚Äù

¬†

We worked out the details over the next few days. I was given whatever equipment I asked for. The only thing she insisted on was that I keep all pictures, no matter how bad they were. That, and that I didn‚Äôt approach this woman ‚Äì that could be unnerving. It was simple enough, and I only had to check in with a phone call a day to say what places I visited. Alice wasn‚Äôt picky.

For the first few days, I lulled around town taking pictures of anything and anyone that even remotely looked like her. It was a dud though. No one really stood out. I tried a couple caf√©s and a bakery or two, but no one that worked there really looked like her.

That is, until I checked a place in the next town over, to the west.

¬†

There was a chilling rain in the air that morning; on the border between snow and sleet. Warm enough to make you sweat, but cold enough to freeze your hands. Miserable.

I found a small corner caf√© with a cartoonish carrot mascot on the front. There, sweeping the floor, was a woman that was almost identical to Alice. She had slightly shorter hair, and was a bit taller, but I figured that was just a matter of perspective. It had to be her, so I started taking pictures.

But no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn‚Äôt get it right. It was always slightly out of frame, or she managed to duck behind something at the worst time. Out of almost a hundred pictures, I couldn‚Äôt get a single one without a bit of blur. So I called Alice to ask if I should get her name and number. Alice was quick to respond, but I could tell she was busy with something.

‚ÄúAbsolutely not,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúJust a couple of pictures, and I‚Äôll see about calling her.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not getting anything good,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not used to this kind of-‚Äú

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù Alice interrupted. ‚ÄúJust get what you can, and meet me tonight.‚Äù

¬†

Coming back to Alice‚Äôs place, I was eager to share my findings. She offered me a Tegernseer, but I settled for a coffee, again. I sipped it as she browsed the pictures. She sighed, shaking her head.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not her,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou can see it on the neck, and ears. And the height.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúThe pictures aren‚Äôt very clear.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, I understand,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI can look elsewhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould you?‚Äù Alice smiled. ‚ÄúWould you mind?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot at all.‚Äù

Alice slipped the memory card out of the camera and put it aside with an implied ‚Äòjust in case‚Äô, and kept me company as I finished my coffee. What was the odds of there being another woman who looked like her in this region, who *wasn‚Äôt* her twin? Astronomical.

¬†

About a week later, I spotted another women at a caf√© who was almost identical. She had natural blonde hair, and her cheeks were a bit rounder, but that was it. I took some pictures, and observed. I wasn‚Äôt as preoccupied this time, but I noticed that I still couldn‚Äôt get a good picture. I could get one of the *other* patrons, but not of *that* *particular* *woman*. It‚Äôs as if the camera itself hated her.

It made me question whether it was my skills, or just‚Ä¶ her. How come everyone else turned out so well? Cameras don‚Äôt play favorites. They just show the world as-is. So what was it trying to tell me? I looked at those blurry faces long enough for the caf√© to close. I watched the woman leave and couldn‚Äôt help myself. I had to see what was going on, so I followed her.

She walked a spiraling road out of town, and took a shortcut through the forest. Somewhere along that shortcut, I lost her. I scanned the area with my camera in hand, but it was getting dark.

¬†

Then I spotted her. She was just standing there, off the side of the road.

Looking straight ahead, seemingly paralyzed.

She said nothing. Did nothing. It‚Äôs as if she had stopped pretending.

¬†

My phone buzzed. My head flipped down, and I almost dropped my camera; thank God for the backup straps. Looking back up, she‚Äôd turned my way. Her neutral expression soured as she noticed my camera.

‚ÄúNo pictures!‚Äù she called out.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù she repeated. ‚ÄúI said no pictures!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry!‚Äù I said.

For a moment we just stood there, looking at one another. Then she burst into a sprint.

¬†

I ran as fast as I could, but I hadn‚Äôt run in years. She, apparently, had. She was far faster than I‚Äôd anticipated. It took her less than a minute to catch up to me. She grunted like an animal as she swiped at me, before finally catching the camera strap. She tried to pull it off me, but the strap broke. The camera sailed away, landing bottom-side down on a sharp rock; splitting the storage latch wide open, and crunching the bottom of the memory card.

I fell forward, scraping the palms of my hands. I covered my head and hurried back up to my feet ‚Äì only to realize she was gone. Looking back on the trail, there was no one there. I was just standing there, panting like a dog, for nothing. I looked down at my camera, who‚Äôd taken a far worse beating than me. The memory card was broken, and the screen was cracked. I wouldn‚Äôt have anything to show Alice.

Wherever that woman went, she could rest well knowing that whatever picture I had of her was broken along with my camera.

¬†

I met Alice later that night and explained what‚Äôd happened. She was concerned and handed me some paper towels to wash my hands. Alice didn‚Äôt seem bothered by the camera at all, she could just get me another one. Instead, she wanted to focus our efforts elsewhere. Apparently, she wasn‚Äôt a natural blonde; so this woman couldn‚Äôt possibly have been her twin. I had no idea that Alice had faked it all these years.

As I was about to leave, I threw one of the paper towels away; only to notice something in her trash can. A memory card, just like the one I‚Äôd handed her earlier. She‚Äôd broken it in two and thrown it away.

I didn‚Äôt mention it. Maybe she had her reasons. But what worried me was what those reasons might be.

¬†

This continued for a couple more weeks. I would find someone with a similar look, and I‚Äôd fail to get a clear picture. If I stuck around, I would notice strange behavior. One of them just sat in a car for hours, staring straight ahead as if pretending to drive. Another just wandered around town aimlessly, waving at people. Another just stood at a crossing, looking at cars. I would find at least one of them every week, and they‚Äôd follow similar patterns.

They would never sleep. I never once saw them sleeping, they just kept wandering around, or doing things. They hated being photographed, so I kept well out of sight, and kept my phone muted. They never seemed to talk with people for long. They didn‚Äôt smoke, or drink, or eat, and they never showed any real emotion.

It‚Äôs like they weren‚Äôt really people. They weren‚Äôt really *there*.

¬†

I only mentioned my concerns to Alice once.

‚ÄúYou seem to have a lot of doppeltg√§ngers,‚Äù I mentioned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never considered how many people there are who look like you.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt use that word,‚Äù she murmured.

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you,‚Äù she repeated. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt use that word. It‚Äôs an ugly word.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was just making an observation,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúWell, make a better one,‚Äù she sighed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to entertain your imagination.‚Äù

All the while, she didn‚Äôt raise her voice. She didn‚Äôt lose her composure. Calm as a lake and poised as a princess. The one we all aspired to be, still. And with every meeting, I noticed the stack of broken memory cards grow.

¬†

I had to travel pretty far to find my next target. Far enough to have to catch an overnight stay at a hotel. I‚Äôd been looking at various bakeries all day when I returned to the hotel, stopping briefly in the lobby to brush the thick rain from of my eyes. That‚Äôs when I heard a voice.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me,‚Äù the voice said. ‚ÄúDo I know you?‚Äù

I turned around. It was a woman with short curly blonde hair, and far too much eye shadow. She had a jolly face, underlined by her well-trained arms. It took me a couple of seconds to connect the dots. She wasn‚Äôt an exact copy, but I could tell she had a lot of similarities to Alice.

‚ÄúI met you on the train,‚Äù she smiled. ‚ÄúWe had the same necklace.‚Äù

I just looked at her, flabbergasted. There was no way she could‚Äôve known that.

‚ÄúAlice?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù she laughed. ‚ÄúI knew it!‚Äù

¬†

We ended up talking for a bit. Her move to the big city had turned into disaster, just like mine. She eventually gave up and came back to marry her teenage sweetheart. Now she had three kids and worked in the hotel kitchen. She couldn‚Äôt stop talking about her family and was eager to show me pictures. She had a hundred questions, and I tried to answer them all.

We talked for hours. There was no doubt in my mind that this woman was Alice. She knew everything about our time growing up; the teachers we had, the rumors and fates of those we used to know. She offered me a pastry from the kitchen, free of charge. We had two each.

Before we went our separate ways, I asked her for a picture. She didn‚Äôt mind at all, and asked me to send it to her. It came out perfectly.

‚ÄúI just wish I still had that necklace,‚Äù she sighed. ‚ÄúIt got stolen years ago.‚Äù

It was funny, in a way. She didn‚Äôt turn out the way I thought she would, but I still envied her. Even there and then, I could see people wanting to be her. What a joy of a person.

¬†

Going back to my hotel room, I sat with my phone in hand, considering my options. ‚ÄòDorothea‚Äô would want to know this, but how would she react? She‚Äôd been rigid about me not talking to the ‚Äòtwin‚Äô. I was just supposed to take pictures. Besides, this woman wasn‚Äôt her sister; she was outright claiming to *be* her. Someone wasn‚Äôt telling the truth, and I wasn‚Äôt seeing the whole picture.

And maybe that was the answer. A picture tells a thousand words, and maybe I hadn‚Äôt looked close enough. Looking back at that first picture I took of Dorothea, I noticed something in her expression. When she turned around, she wasn‚Äôt flustered, or curious. She was scared. *Terrified*, even. That expression wasn‚Äôt of someone who‚Äôd been surprised ‚Äì it was of someone afraid to die.

I turned my concerns in and out, and one word kept coming back to me. One word that she didn‚Äôt like.

Doppeltg√§nger.

¬†

The people I‚Äôd taken pictures of never ate, drank, or slept. And thinking back on it, I‚Äôd never seen Dorothea do those things either. At the caf√©, she claimed to have just eaten. Every time I‚Äôd been at her place, she‚Äôd either put her coffee aside, or drank nothing. In fact, that would explain why she always had the same bottle of Tegernseer to offer; she had one herself.

But did she sleep? It might all be circumstantial. Maybe I was missing something. But as I turned the picture of the real Alice over and over in my hands, the thought dawned on me like a spike of ice running down my spine.

I *might* not have talked to a real person.

¬†

I was up late that night, scouring the web for whatever snippets of truth I could find. I looked for what I already knew, trying to find something related to it. People that only pretended to be people. Among the myriads of conspiracy theories, there were a couple of people talking about doppeltg√§ngers. Some even mentioned similar signs as I‚Äôd noticed. There was one post about a man who claimed to be followed by one.

‚ÄúI swear, he stole my shoe and ran off,‚Äù a post read. ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt seen him since.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou need to get that back,‚Äù someone answered. ‚ÄúThey get more real the more things they steal from you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll try to replace you,‚Äù another wrote. ‚ÄúOr worse; kill you.‚Äù

There was so much about them, but it was hard to sift through. Most of it was nonsense. One claimed they couldn‚Äôt attack people who invested in crypto. Another claimed they were actually angels. But a few statements had not only a lot of people agreeing, but others joining in to correlate their findings. One such claim was that the Doppeltg√§ngers hated one another and would compete to be the only remaining copy.

But the most important discussion was how to *destroy* them. Apparently, breaking a picture of a doppeltg√§nger would also break the creature itself. My mind drifted back to the cracked memory cards in Dorothea‚Äôs trash can, and the disappearing lady who‚Äôd chased me.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt work on the good ones,‚Äù a final post mentioned. ‚ÄúIf they have taken something from you, you can barely tell them from the real thing. And you can‚Äôt break their picture.‚Äù

¬†

I barely got any sleep that night. My head was spinning, and my mind kept drifting back to what I‚Äôd seen. I tried to put it together. Around midnight I got a text message from my employer, and my worries settled in my gut.

‚ÄúYou got something for me?‚Äù she texted.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll come by tomorrow,‚Äù I wrote back.

‚ÄúSee you then!‚Äù

Before I turned my phone off, I scrolled to her number. I bit my lip as I changed her contact information from Alice; to Dorothea.

¬†

I didn‚Äôt know what to expect when I came to see her the next day, but I had my eyes open. She stood in the doorway as always, welcoming me. I tried to keep a straight face, but it didn‚Äôt feel genuine. I think she noticed.

‚ÄúYou alright?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúLong day,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù

We stepped inside. No wonder the place looked so pristine; she wasn‚Äôt using it. Some of her kitchen appliances still had protective plastic. Her bed was in perfect order, and I could tell there was a thin layer of dust on the bedside table.

¬†

Dorothea offered me a Tegernseer, but I declined. I declined the coffee too. She raised an eyebrow at that as we sat down in the living room.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat have you found?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I found the right one,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe picture came out perfectly. She didn‚Äôt really look like you though.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally, now?‚Äù

She turned to me fully, giving me complete attention. She held out her left hand. I raised the camera.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you going to do?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to speak to my sister,‚Äù she smiled. ‚ÄúNow hand me the camera.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you both named Alice?‚Äù

Her smile never faded. She leaned back a little; her face stuck in that same unsettling glare; like the eyes of a porcelain doll. She did not blink.

‚ÄúDid you speak to her?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt answer my question.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have no obligation to,‚Äù she responded. ‚ÄúYou work for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre nothing like I remember you,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that strange?‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople change, my friend.‚Äù

¬†

I leaned back in my chair, putting the camera away.

‚ÄúYou have no memory of meeting me on that train, do you?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt respond.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you didn‚Äôt recognize me,‚Äù I continued. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe camera, if you would.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust tell me honestly,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf not Alice, then who are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm my own person,‚Äù she said, leaning a little closer. ‚ÄúNow how about you be a good friend; and hand me the fucking camera.

¬†

I slid it across the table and got up from my chair. She immediately turned it on; noticing that the memory card was empty. I‚Äôd switched them earlier. I snapped a picture of her with my phone; bathing the room in a sudden flash. She clutched the necklace around her neck, but the picture came out perfect.

‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs it then,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how you pass as normal.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe you should learn to mind your own business,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMaybe you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre getting yourself into.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe I don‚Äôt like being taken advantage of!‚Äù I snapped back. ‚ÄúMaybe I don‚Äôt want to bloody my hands, handing over a victim to a-‚Äú

‚ÄúTo a what?‚Äù

She got up from her chair, letting the camera roll across the floor. She looked at me from across the room; unblinking. Her lungs still. She had stopped pretending.

‚ÄúTo a what, exactly?‚Äù she repeated.

¬†

I looked at this thing from across the room. I‚Äôd seen her with that same smile on TV. She‚Äôd been clever, and tried to make herself into a new person. But Dorothea was something different and she knew that I knew. It dawned on me that she might not let me leave. I backed away, keeping my phone raised.

‚ÄúDoppeltg√§nger,‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúYou should have *swallowed* that fucking word,‚Äù she growled. ‚ÄúInstead of‚Ä¶ *spitting it* at me!‚Äù

Without facing away from me, she pressed her fingers into the wall. They were so hard and sharp, like stone, tearing long lines in the wallpaper.

‚ÄúBut no!‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúYou get to be who you want! You! You‚Äôre duller than *a butter knife*! You couldn‚Äôt *dream* bigger than taking pictures of‚Ä¶ *lamps*! *Streets*! Or of people *better* than you!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not *better* than me!‚Äù I snapped back. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre definitely not *people!*‚Äù

¬†

She made this awful sound. Like she inhaled through a straw and never stopped. An inwards breath turned screech, as she tore through whatever she could get her hands on. And even then, her face never changed from that serene smile; but everything I felt from her was this boundless disgust.

I threw myself out the door and took a sharp left, running through her garden. Dorothea was so distracted that she almost kept heading straight, but she managed to spot me before I turned the corner. She came after me like a thunderstorm.

I rushed past the little signs of her budding garden. I trampled right on through; but so did she. I leapt over her waist-high fence, snagging my coat on one of the iron spikes, but I let it tear. Dorothea leapt over it like she was made of nothing, sliding across the sleet like a swan settling on a lake.

¬†

There was a slope leading down to a patch of sparse pine trees. She was gaining on me. I took a sharp left as Dorothea slipped, tumbling down the slope; clawing at the ground as I gained some distance.

Then, she stopped. For a moment, I did too, looking down on her from the top of the slope. She wiped the sleet-covered hair from her face, then turned away from me.

We weren‚Äôt alone.

¬†

I should‚Äôve known.

Dorothea had gotten rid of at least a dozen other Doppeltg√§ngers, thanks to my pictures. It was only a matter of time before they had something to say about it. A handful of them emerged from the woods. If I‚Äôd been a little more observant, I would‚Äôve noticed them long ago. A car following me. People watching me from afar. Hell, the spotlights who stayed on as I entered Dorothea‚Äôs house. Just as I‚Äôd watched them; they‚Äôd done an effort to watch me. And I‚Äôd lead them right to her.

Just as she was vicious and clever; so were they.

They spoke their own language. Short, spit-like words with harsh consonants. They circled her like sharks. Dorothea, in turn, pointed at me, but they weren‚Äôt buying it.

Then, cold steel. Something pressing against my throat.

‚Äú*Walk*.‚Äù

¬†

They wrestled her to the ground like a herd of cats; scratching and tearing at one another. They tore chunks of her hair, and she didn‚Äôt even blink. A snake pit of tattered clothes and neutral faces. At the end of it, she was on her knees, held by three others, who could‚Äôve been her sisters.

An arm reached out from my side, and held up my phone. I heard a twang as her necklace was torn off and thrown to the ground.

‚ÄúTake her picture,‚Äù one of them whispered in my ear. ‚Äú*Now*.‚Äù

They held my arm straight, making sure I couldn‚Äôt use it on anyone else. I pressed my finger to the screen; taking her picture.

¬†

Her face was blurred. Her movements staggered, and strange. A living smudge. A half-person. A colorful shadow, at best. Dorothea looked up at me; her face as neutral as ever. But somewhere in that picture, I could see her hatred. Not in a grimace, or expression; but in the whirling impressions left on the screen.

The steel pressed closer to my neck.

‚ÄúBreak it,‚Äù they whispered. ‚ÄúShe *cheated*. She *skipped the line*.‚Äù

And so I dropped my phone to the ground, and cracked it with the heel of my boot.

¬†

There was no drama. No explosion, or screams. Dorothea simply disappeared like a silent, popped balloon. A whiff of air, lost in the wind. Nothing, returned to nothing; leaving a handful of belongings behind. A coat. Some pants. No shoes.

The doppeltg√§ngers clawed at her things, trying to get to the torn necklace. The one at my throat¬† was distracted and let their composure slip. For a second, I could act. They hissed at one another, muttering their spit-like words, trying to convince each other to let the necklace go.

But I remembered something; Dorothea had called me several times.

She had a *phone*.

¬†

I dropped to my knees and tapped her right coat pocket. I was lucky. My fingers slipped her phone out of her pocket, and I rolled onto my back. I held the phone up like a shield. My attacker recoiled, covering their face with their hands. The others hurried back, hiding behind trees, bushes, and each other.

I held the phone towards them, hoping they wouldn‚Äôt realize I hadn‚Äôt unlocked it. That I couldn‚Äôt take their pictures even if I wanted to. My heart was hammering so fast, hoping against hope that they wouldn‚Äôt figure it out.

‚ÄúI-I got you all,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI got you all, and I can break this.‚Äù

They said nothing. Little shrieks as they lowered their heads, leaning forward like playful cats.

‚ÄúYou think you can break it before we get you?‚Äù one of them whispered.

‚ÄúYou think so?‚Äù another chimed in.

‚ÄúAre you *sure?*‚Äù

¬†

I stepped forward, and they recoiled. It was all talk. But a few of them were moving away; circling me. They wanted to find an angle. Even if they didn‚Äôt attack, they might notice that I wasn‚Äôt recording. I had to act fast.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm keeping this,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd if I see anyone of you, I‚Äôm breaking it. I‚Äôm walking out of here. We‚Äôll never talk again, and no one dies.‚Äù

There was no response. I backed away, watching their doll faces peeking out from behind the trees. Spitting hisses at one another, like snake bites turned word. They were discussing ‚Äì but not moving.

And they let me go.

¬†

Now, this was a couple of years ago. Some things have happened, and some things haven‚Äôt. Even today, you might see ‚ÄòDorothea‚Äô on TV (I‚Äôve changed the name for anonymity, as you might have noticed). I think one of them stole something, or possible fixed the necklace, and took her place. The real Alice still lives with her family; I‚Äôve checked. She‚Äôs okay.

Things turned around for me not long after that. I got a job with a news agency. I think the new ‚ÄòDorothea‚Äô had something to do with it, as it had come with a ‚Äòrecommendation‚Äô. Maybe she figured keeping me happy might keep me from breaking that phone. Or maybe they just wanted me distracted. Or maybe it wasn‚Äôt them at all.

I‚Äôve since made a bit of a name for myself. Nothing big, but enough to get by. I‚Äôve met a man, and I‚Äôve moved to a bigger place. We got a dog, and I can honestly say I‚Äôm happy. If anything, I can imagine others wishing they were me, for once.

¬†

But I wanted to share this story for a reason, and I think others need to pay attention too.

About a month ago I came home to a bouquet of flowers sitting on my doorstep. Mostly white roses, but a handful of blue sunflowers as well. And a little note.

‚Äú*I got one of your earrings*,‚Äù it said.

It was signed with a smiley.

¬†

As I turned around and looked across the street, I noticed someone looking back.

It was almost like looking in a mirror. My hair, my nose, my smile.

1j0lbui,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1j0lbui/do_you_hear_my_soul_calling_yours/,Do you hear my soul calling yours?,"I've never experienced a soul connection like yours. I desire being in your arms, desire being in your embrace, curling into your lap/arms & wrap around you like a koala. Resting my head into you- listening to the rhythm of your heartbeat. I know I would be held with love, compassion, acceptance & understanding. You crowd my thoughts. Why? What is this feeling? What is this intense draw? What are these desires? What is this sureness? Do you hear our souls calling each other? Silently speaking deep within? Or do you at least- hear mine? With the intensity- I can't fathom it is just me feeling this. If it was- why have I never experienced this before? Why haven't I experienced something even remotely close to this- ever? 

You intrigue me. I genuinely want to get to know the full you. I want to be your safe space. I want to know your flaws & weaknesses. I want to know your strengths & where you flourish in life. I want to see you in your own element. What makes your eyes light up? (Gah, I can't help but melt in them each time you look at me. I worry if I look into your eyes too long. You will see this desire I'm trying to hide. Due to fear of not being enough for you. Your eyes are so beautiful- they were the very first thing I saw). What kind of books do you enjoy most? Do you want coffee each morning? Do you put sugar or milk in your tea?  What is your favorite ice cream? What are your talents? Forest, desert or beach? What music heals your soul when you feel down? I want to know the things that drive you. Why you became you. What traumas you felt through your life. Each experience- ones that made you fall & ones that made you grow. I want to know about past loves, ensuring I don't hurt you in anyway you've experienced previously. Giving me the opportunity to love you the way you need. Allowing me to love you tenderly, passionately, and completely ensure you know my heart desires all of you. I can't explain what this draw is. I have never felt such a draw to another soul. Even as a very in tune spiritual being. All this is extremely confusing. As, I've never physically touched you. Not your hand, your face, your hair, or even been in the embrace of your arms. Which is such a huge desire of mine. 

I have only known love to be pain, disappointment, hidden lies, cheating, neglect, & abuse of all kinds. I've realized through my growth & my old ""love"" experiences- I accepted below par & bare minimum because I didn't love myself enough. I had never believed a kind, loyal, genuine love would ever exist for me. (Maybe I'm just jumping the gun & it won't really ever exist) Or even possibly be in my grasp in the future.

This is such an uncertain feeling. I feel your draw,  I feel the hints, I feel your soul through the week. At random times, I'm slammed with something in life. Suddenly, you flood my mind like a tsunami. Wondering if my past was only paving the way for our souls to finally cross paths?? Has my soul called to you all these years?? 

If I'm honest, you are not my normal type. Not that you are unattractive- because you are very handsome. I couldn't imagine being more attracted to you. Even being turned on by certain things that normally would be a turn on. Which shows me that my soul/heart desires everything about you. You feel like the missing piece my soul has always searched for. Is this just my heart manifesting you into my life? Into my arms? You are so different than the rest. I see the heart you hold in your chest- it's huge, it's kind, it's patient, its completely beautiful. Your desire for knowledge, reading, poetry, nature, and spiritual way of life- continues to draw me in.

Last night- I had one of the most intense experiences. I'm still trying to mentally comprehend what it was/is. I would be dishonest if I didn't want to feel that way again and again. Let me explain what happened... 

I got out of the shower. I had started to brush my hair, thinking about the laundry list I had to get done tomorrow (today, now). I felt you come up behind me. I felt your hands wrap around my back moving around my waist embracing my body in a hug. I felt your breath on my neck. Lightly kissing the back of my neck, slowly moving to the side of my neck. Where you gently bite. Making my body ache for more. You were so sensual, I could feel you were soaking us in, just like I was. Knowing this wasnt just a desire to use me and leave. You continue to kiss my neck, while exploring my body. You move one hand near my breast- brushing my nipple. Making me ache. Making me want to turn around to face you. Yet, you grabbed me keeping me right where you wanted me. Which got me even more turned on. Being sensually dominated, grabbed just right. You keep tracing my body with your fingertips feeling every inch of me. You stop brushing by my nipple- finally lightly pinch and pull my nipples. Making me moan in lust. Wanting all of you. Loving every second of you taking your time. You move up with one hand and touch my neck & tilt my head up. Making me immediately wet, fighting back the urge to completely release in an intense orgasm. By your touch, your breath.. you continue to explore my body with your other hand. You grabbed hips and pull me closer- as if in that moment we became one. I could feel your warmth. I could feel myself pulse making me lose my leg strength making me wrap my hand around the nape of your neck for more stability. I press into you allow my body to tell you how I want all of you. Finally you put your hands in my pants line... you get the picture..needless to say we didn't stop, until we both were satisfied. While my body & mind were in complete and utter ecstasy. In person I had to grab & resting on the counter to make sure I could stay up. I could feel your hands, your breath, your thrusts. I'm unsure how long I was in that realm with you.. I know I didn't want to leave. I couldn't control my moans & intense body sensation. I couldn't control my body, my thoughts. In that moment- I gave you every ounce of me. My mind, body, soul. I was right where I wanted to be. It fully became yours. I woke today still feeling- you still hold all of me. As if last night I fell deeper than I have before. 

To be quite honest, I still keep questioning what last night's experience was. I've never experienced anything like it. I've never heard someone tell me this experience before. I can't help but ponder... were you dreaming of me in your sleep? or were you in the same moment daydream that I was? What was this foreign, unforgettable, & unearthly experience?? That amount of intensity- there is no way it was only me.. I just can't fathom the idea. You were apart of me, like that scene in ghost. 

It would bring me joy knowing we could be completely honest & transparent with each other. I know for once you would prove a love like mine exists in another. A place for radical honesty. Providing a safe space to fully & throughly explore each other. Give us time to explore what this longing desire is. I crave being able to explore your mind, body (memorizing every part of you. Each scar, birth mark, mole, freckle. Your likes, dislikes, the parts you do your best to hide. Your goals & aspirations) & soul. I want to hold & love your soul the way it deserves to be treated. I know you've seen things in your past. Which makes you the incredibly kind soul you are. I do my best not to read you. I notice  when I do I fall deeper for you. No matter how much I continue to deny these feelings. Which is so beyond terrifying. Even with the fears I know if you felt the same deep feelings it would be reciprocated. I feel my heart would be safe in your hands. That you would fight to defend & protect it from more destruction. I'm certain by now you've learned I can handle things on my own. Pick myself up and keep going. Yet, you being who you are. I don't think I would have to face them alone. Even if it's to cheer me on. If I cried at night you wouldn't have your back turned pretending you don't hear. I know you would embrace me letting me know I'm safe. You truly genuinely care- that is why I keep falling deeper. I know that right now, we are ""forbidden"". If we crossed the line- certainly things would have to be changed. I don't know if I'm ready for the change, yet.. maybe I am? All this is so unfamiliar anymore. I'm unsure where to express this. I can't tell you. I can't talk to others who know me- I don't think they would understand. So, I'm posting here maybe when it's said and done universe will answer the questions I seek. 

I will probably never have the opportunity to express any of this to you. As well, I don't think I have the courage to shoot my shot. I don't want things to become awkward. I know I have so much to learn from you, still. Even if thats where we are now- or down the road for our future. I gave up thinking I would be interested in placing my heart in another's hands. It's been years... yet, here I am ready to jump in the unknown with you. Being able to create memories, traditions. Exploring new places & traveling together. I don't just want a relationship- I want an equal partnership. One who understands that any problems we may face it is us against the problem. Someone who knows what's worth fighting for. You know so much about me. Which makes me feel you wouldn't want to take on the challenges that continue to lie ahead in my unknown future. I know right now I'm not healed enough to feel I would be what you fully deserve. If you'd even think my intensity & chaos is worth loving me. Even though I bring a lot to the table. If feelings were mutual. I want us to take our time, I want to feel every second in time with you. Soaking it all in. Grow. Learn together. Smell flowers or smell every candle in the store. Not feeling upset or annoyed. Because it wouldnt matter what we did- we would be together. I wouldn't want to live in the past or future.  Just fully in the moment with you. If I strayed off the present. You would guide me back.

I'll keep this all to myself. I'm sure this all sounds crazy. Or even an overwhelm of ""WTF?"". Parts of me hope you find this, just to know my feelings. To see if, this soul draw isn't just me.

The other part of me- prays you never see this.  I don't know if I could handle your rejection. At least, not yet. I want to stay in this for a while. Its a peaceful space I havent felt in over 10 years. I know given our circumstances- this draw, my desire, & intense intrigue to know more. Will probably never happen. Unless, somehow we were able to talk about these feelings outside of our circumstances. 

I fully understand that I can't tell you, you can't tell me if you felt the same. I wish I knew if you too, hear my soul talking to yours. Knowing my luck you'll read this & think I sound like a crazy human & never want anything to do with me.. Which, I can't say I blame you.

I just can't explain it though. Which is why I'm trying to navigate it all. So, maybe getting it out helps me understand it more? It's as if your soul belonged to mine & has for many past lives. Maybe this is all in my head & I've been out of the love/dating scene too long. Something deep down- tells me that our souls belong together. 

The nerves of being so vulnerable- are making me feel I should just delete this & get my to do list finished. I won't though, because I need to get this out there. I've already spent this much time getting it out of my head. I know the likelihood of you seeing this, will be slim to never. Thank you for being you.  I know you are a light in the world. One that provides more love in this world of scary, sad, disappointments, and cruelty. Whatever happens from here. I do hope that you feel my soul talking to yours. Reminding you how remarkable you are. One day, I want to know that this- desire, drive, sex day dreams, feeling your breath/embrace- which I've never felt (yet). That you, US... isn't just a one off of insane unfamiliar experiences racing through my mind, body & soul. 

Maybe, tonight, I'll see you again in my dreams. As that is where the us meets from time to time. I hope you keep listening. My soul will keep speaking to yours. ",13,1740784812.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,12,0.89,False

But after watching videos I felt lowkey bad because I thought how I misuse my time doing dumb things like watching youtube and instagram reels.

So I decided to go to my garden and sit down. I watched the sky, the birds, the wind on the leaves of the trees and my chickens walking and eating seed in the yard. I thought about the real meaning of rest.

Rest is not enterteinment. Rest is not dopamine and watching content on YouTube while you eat popcorns and soda. Rest means peace, stay calm and enjoying existence. I sit down in my garden and close my eyes. And for an hour nothing was important.

I reflected about life and I tought many things. For example, I thought we need to leave us time for being bored. You feel bored? don't go on the phone, don't watch youtube videos. Leave you being bored, that would make you to think different.

I thought about the ways of being happy too. For me the true happiness is what I experienced today. There are two more ways of enjoy life. The first is experimenting things, you know, from traveling to another country to go out on your town. The other way is working on your goals. Doing things that you like that nears you to your goals.

After stayed in my garden I played the piano and made coffee. I usually don't do those things because I normally do what I plan for do today. I'm strict in that way, but I just feel tired and simply take a rest. A real rest, not watching youtube videos. Thank you for reading my post.",1,1740784442.0,WriteStreakEN,1,1.0,False

She actually hinted at me to ask her to be my girlfriend. She said that if I didn't ask her she was going to keep hinting until I did. I've supported her in ""extracurricular"" activities, met several of her friends, she tells me they all like me. I think its going well. She works a ton of hours for work, and it's clearly important to her. Work is important to me too, I have an unarguably more demanding and stressful job, but I also am in school for my doctorate. However I make time to send her good morning/night texts, ask her how her day is going etc.

She has a busy work week this week for a known event that is coming up, and so her texting has gotten very light, which I feel is fair. But it was also her birthday. I gave her a card prior to her birthday because I knew I wasn't going to see her on her birthday - I tried too. She lives walking distance away (fewer than 10 mins), and didn't want to meet up because she was going to be tired from work. It was a nice gift and card and she didn't really even comment on it. We were supposed to have a date next Friday because she was going to take off from all the extra unpaid hours shes been doing, but decided not to take the day off because her boss took off and that ""unofficially"" puts her in charge. Then she can't even make plans with me because she has things planned with friends. She also offered a coffee date during the week, but then cancelled it because she was ""tired"" the night before! Then she told me the day where we were going to get coffee that cancelling was ""the right call"" because she was busy at work. I feel like recently I have to initiate all of the texts... but maybe that's just because of this week.

I don't think she's making excuses, I don't think she's not interested. I feel like she's just not prioritizing the relationship, and I've given her nothing but care and attention. She once told me ""she always wanted a boyfriend like me"".

‚Äú‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs warm.‚Äù He nodded. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMmhmm.‚Äù She sighed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had a long, hard week‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôve done a lot of growing, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúHeheh‚Ä¶ I still feel like I should be growing more. Doing more, too.‚Äù Percy wrapped the blanket around his shoulders tighter. ‚ÄúEven though I made up my mind, a part of me‚Äôs like, well‚Ä¶ ‚Äòmy wounds are better, so I should be out fighting with them,‚Äô and stuff like that. And I keep thinking‚Ä¶ are they going to be okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúFirst of all, your wounds aren‚Äôt better.‚Äù His father sighed, leaning back in his chair. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a miracle you were able to walk back at all. Second of all, they‚Äôve got the Headmistress and a frickin‚Äô faerie with them! If they can‚Äôt handle it, no one can.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt they get less hurt if I were there?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably.‚Äù His father shrugged. ‚ÄúBut they‚Äôll make it though ‚Äî so stop worrying about it! You did everything you could, remember? We agreed on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, I know.‚Äù He sighed. ‚ÄúJust overthinking‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou? Overthinking?‚Äù He laughed. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôdve thunk.‚Äù

The boy giggled softly. But as he sighed, blowing ripples upon the surface of his tea again, he gazed down at his reflection, softly lit by the lights around him. His eyes had deep, dark bags beneath them, and even in the reflection‚Äôs golden tint, he was pale ‚Äî as if he was deathly ill with some horrid sickness. Maybe he was ‚Äî though whether it was physical or not, he wasn‚Äôt sure.

Taking a sip of his tea, he sniffled. Propping up his chin with his palm, he opened his free hand and watched the familiar small flame like candlelight poof to life, quietly crackling. Closing his hand and extinguishing it, he opened his hand and it poofed to life again. Over and over. Thinking.

‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs your plan now?‚Äù His mother asked. ""No rush, just curious.""

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù He continued to summon the flame again and again. ‚ÄúI dunno. I haven‚Äôt thought that far, I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want to go back to Etherwood?‚Äù

He didn't respond, instead gazing deeply into the flame. The gentle flickering in his palm was warm and soothing, and yet‚Ä¶ why did his chest feel so cold?

*Etherwood. Etherwood‚Ä¶ What would happen if I didn‚Äôt go? I guess I‚Äôd go to school here again. Talk to all my old friends‚Ä¶ that‚Äôd be nice. But after that‚Ä¶ Would I take over the cafe?*¬†He shuddered.¬†*I‚Äôm terrible at cooking. And I hate coffee. But what else could I do‚Ä¶?*

‚ÄúPercy? You‚Äôre spacing out,‚Äù his mother chuckled.

‚ÄúHuh? Oh, ahaha‚Ä¶ sorry. I just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he finally responded, closing his fist. ‚ÄúWhen I think about it, my stomach feels all tight, for some reason. Like I want to throw up. But still, I‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you still love it.‚Äù She finished. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to imagine a life without it, huh?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶ Yeah.‚Äù He sighed. ‚ÄúLike a charm I can‚Äôt run away from. Is this how you felt, Mom? When you stopped being a Didact?‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ similar, but yes.‚Äù She smiled softly, a momentary longing lingering in her eyes.

‚ÄúDid you love magic?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ Yeah, I did.‚Äù She shrugged.

‚ÄúIf you did, why did you leave?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a story for another time.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen‚Ä¶ how did you move on?‚Äù Percy asked, taking a sip of his tea.

‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶‚Äù She thought for a moment. ‚ÄúFor me, I had to ask myself a lot of questions.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of questions?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike, ‚ÄòHow would you think you‚Äôd feel if you stopped? How would you feel if you didn‚Äôt study magic anymore? Would you be okay sacrificing it?‚Äô‚Äù She smiled, reaching over and parting his hair from his eyes. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more to life than just magic; there‚Äôs more to you than your spells. Just think about it for a bit, okay? You don‚Äôt have to find your answers tonight. Whatever you want to do, we‚Äôll be there to support you.‚Äù

Percy nodded. ‚Äú‚ÄôKay.‚Äù

‚ÄúFinish your tea,‚Äù his father sighed, grunting as he stood. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve gotta go change your bloody bedsheets.‚Äù

Percy sighed, watching as they both flashed him smiles before they stepped upstairs.¬†*A life without magic‚Ä¶ huh? What would that feel like?*

Summoning the flame in his hand, he gazed into its flickering shape once more. But the longer he did, the more he began to notice the flecks of darkness in the flame, burning at the edges. Haunting him, like a terrible specter that wouldn‚Äôt leave. He felt himself tense; he felt his heart begin to race faster and faster.

Gritting his teeth, he shut his hand, extinguishing the flame. Hesitating a moment, he opened it again, staring at his palm. He felt the tightness in his chest grow even more ‚Äî and in a different way. It was like it was twisting and chewing his heart ‚Äî like it was going to tear him apart from the inside. It felt like he was going to die.

He took a deep breath, slowly exhaling.¬†*‚Ä¶ I hate this. Even though it hurts‚Ä¶ this emptiness feels worse.*¬†Taking a deep breath, he focused on his palm, and the flame flared back to life. The tightness lessened, though it didn‚Äôt go away; his heart slowed, though it continued to pound.

*I don‚Äôt know if I deserve to keep studying. He took a deep breath. But if I stopped‚Ä¶ would I forgive myself? There‚Äôs something here‚Ä¶ something awful. But it‚Äôs something.*

He thought back to the battle; the emptiness, the void that he felt. The lack of emotion. Was that him? Was that really him? Was that emptiness something that he really wanted? He gazed quietly into the flame as it danced quietly in his palm before he closed his fist once more.

And yet, the warmth remained.

1j0l3ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1j0l3ik/post_op/,Post Op!,"I had my bisalp this morning! Late 20s, no kids, in a cishet relationship. Following the election (I'm in the US) I scheduled an appointment with a doctor off the CF list. Initially my appointment was supposed to be in December but I had to reschedule in January due to a conflict. Once we met, my doctor was fantastic and we had a super informative discussion about the bisalp as well as IUD/implant since I was considering those. Once I made up my mind we got a consult scheduled and here we are! Total time - 1.5 months, and it could have been shorter if I hadn't been busy on the surgery day she had earlier in February. My state does not have a 30 day waiting period after the consult.

The one downside with this quick turnaround is that my insurance didn't approve the preauthorization for the surgery until 10pm EST a couple days ago, which was super stressful as if it hadn't gotten processed my doctor would not have operated today. For some reason, even though my doctor's office put in the request two weeks ago, insurance took 15 days (the maximum they were allowed) to process. Being generous I'd say that I just fell through the cracks on their side but you may want to have a little more time between consult and surgery to avoid that last minute stress.

Overview of how things are going so far for me (I'll update as I progress through recovery):

**Day Before Surgery:**

Work is crazy hectic for me right now so I honestly didn't think much about surgery until the evening. I had to tell a couple of coworkers that I was having a medical procedure because of some upcoming travel that I won't be able to attend, but I was able to keep it super vague. I WFH so if there hadn't been the travel I wouldn't have told anyone at work at all. After work I definitely became a nervous wreck. I popped out to get some last minute groceries, including a premade quiche that I could just throw in the oven, and some comfort food snacks. When I got home, I stress-cleaned for a few hours, but I made sure to get laundry done, have fresh sheets on my bed, water my plants, take out the trash/cat litter, and refill my cat's auto feeder since these would be the heaviest/most bending-required chores. I then ate a healthy meal and chilled until it was time to try to go to bed. No food after midnight.

**Day Of:**

I can't sleep when I'm anxious, so you can imagine what a terrible night's sleep I had lol. Think I ended up getting about three hours? I had to be up early anyway so eventually I gave up. 2 hours before I was supposed to be at the hospital they wanted me to drink a powerade. My doctor said this wasn't something she felt necessary since the surgery is comparatively minor, but since I was up anyway I did it. Then my boyfriend picked me up and we got to the hospital for a 7AM checkin.

We were kept in the main waiting room for 50 minutes. Because I was so anxious at this point I was afraid I'd been forgotten out there. But we were finally taken back (my bf was permitted to come too) and I had to do a pee cup pregnancy test. Then I got changed into the hospital gown. I'm on my period rn so they just put a big pad down underneath me. The anesthesiologist came in, cracked a few jokes, explained the process, and had me sign his consent form. I was given a scopolamine patch because I do get nauseous sometimes. Then my blood was drawn and IV inserted (both me and my bf had to look away for this, but the nurse was very sweet and verbalized what was happening/when it was over.

After all this was done my bf and I sat in the private room for about twenty minutes. Then my surgeon stopped by, confirmed that I still was good and wanted the procedure, and said I'd be taken back as soon as the OR was cleaned from the bisalp she had done just before mine. At this point they'd started pumping the anti anxiety meds in via IV because I felt a lot more relaxed - fully aware of what was going on, kinda just like I'd had a couple glasses of wine and was just chilling. After about 20 more minutes two nurses came in to kick my boyfriend back out to the waiting room and take me back. I remember getting to the OR and having a number of people around preparing to move me, but then the drugs hit and I had a damn good nap. My bf was kept in the loop via texts and a display they had out in the waiting room, and he said I was the OR about 30 min total.

I woke up in the anesthesia recovery area and was super groggy for a bit. No nausea, and only about a 2 in pain - straight up just mild period cramps. The nurse here was super nice and asked how I felt and what I wanted to drink, and because I was still so groggy I asked her what she recommended like I was at a coffee shop or something lol. She gave me some ginger ale to sip and then I was just left to finish waking up - I felt like I got back to close-to-normal alert pretty quickly. I had to be kept in this area a bit long just because their private pre/post op rooms were all full, but eventually I was wheeled to one of them and my bf could come back and see me/give me my glasses. This was actually one of the worst parts of the surgery day for me because I really had to pee but the nurse was busy in another room so she took a little while getting to me. Eventually she came and helped me get up. A uterine manipulator and catheter were used but I did not notice any stinging when I went. Peeing was required for discharge, so at this point the nurse went over post op guidelines and I was wheeled down to my boyfriend's car. He went to the onsite pharmacy and got my medications. I have three incisions - bellybutton and one on each side below it.

I didn't have any issues with the \~35 min drive home aside from some very minor arm/shoulder pain which I'm now thinking was the gas, and I ate without getting nauseous. I napped a while though I am having to hold a pillow on my abdomen because my cat has been curious/concerned. Thus far the worst pain I've had is throat discomfort from intubation. Each of my incisions is stinging slightly from time to time. I've not yet taken any of my pills but will take ibuprofen when I go to bed - I'm hoping my pain remains minor enough that I don't need the percocet they gave me.

Total time in hospital - about 5, 5.5 hours

Let me know if you've got any questions! Also one thing I'll go ahead and recommend is that I was added to a Discord chat of some folks from here who were having bisalps last week and this week.

\- the hitbox for the coffee machine button and the grinder button is sometimes unresponsive, especially when you try to play with apple pencil \~ messes up timing (this was not an issue in GPGP)

\- the hitbox for picking up a container and adding stuff to it is very inconsistent - I keep trying to add syrup/ice/strawberries into the cup and picking it up instead. I do tap the bottom of the cup to do and the hitbox is still dodgy

  
The game is still very nice and I can't wait to see what new content they'll add. It's just some issues to iron out but I'm very happy for the dev team - this game is so obviously made with love and I smile every time I play it :3

It is still rather small so I am trying to expand the horizon to my neighbour's fields. Hello there!

I became a full-time XR dev a few years back, post-COVID and a bit earlier due to the massive tech corporate layoffs. That triggered me into wondering what the hell I was supposed to do...... So began my journey in building my own XR project, got my first AI security guard that would chase me in VR, got my first Mixed Reality furniture virtual placement project, and got my first lots of things (do I cite my own source...?)

Here are 5 tips on how to become a better XR dev (if you're interested). Some of it also applies to other things in life, but I am going to focus on what made me better and the things I'd like to share

¬†

* **You don't need a VR headset to start as an XR dev.**¬†Surprise surprise, as long as you have something to develop on, whether it is a laptop or a desktop, you don't need to have a headset for development. A lot of simulations, software, and engines these days offer extended interaction for these specific limitations. Not every Vision Pro developer has a VP, not all Snappable devs have a snap goggle. Don't corner yourself just yet, start building it and maybe things will magically work out! Disclaimer. It is definitely easier to build with the headset you want to develop on, but it is not a must when you first start. Don't be limited by your own imagination
* **Have a rubber duck.**¬†Here's the lovely link:¬†[the duckling website](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/)¬†Talk to your rubber duck, John Cena, your chibi, or your invisible friend Steve. Your rubber duck helps you reflect your current state of mind. Talk to it, no really, physically open your mouth and talk to him. He is your witness for your imposter syndrome too. Let Steve watch you become better
* **It is okay to be imperfect.**¬†Whether it is building a project of your passion, or creating something from work. it is completely normal to feel like you haven't perfected it. If you do manage to make a perfect project, CONGRATS!! I AM PROUD OF YOU TOO!! Don't let me sway you otherwise, you are doing great and keep that up!! But if by any chance you are not feeling the right click, it is completely okay as well!! Talk to your ducklings, let them be the judge and witness
* **Start by writing something.**¬†More often than not the biggest barrier is yourself and your doubts. What should I build? What engine is better? Unity? Unreal? Godot...? (My current favourite engine, but I'm ass at it). What language should I use? How do I write shaders? Find something you like, say driving cars. Okay, how do you make an object? Let's start there. Beautiful, now you are ready to make the next little thing. Move it. Congrats, you wrote something! Take a break from time to time, talk to Steve. There, you are becoming a dev!
* **Be agile.**¬†XR especially is having insane updates as of late. Google/ Samsung is releasing its own headset with Android XR software, Meta is confusing on its Horizon OS, Apple has Vision OS, and then Snapchat, Immersed/ Qualcomm, and Magic Leap (yes, this company still exist)...... Don't be afraid to think outside the box, always prepare for a new iteration (unless you are the dude who's building the new version), and most importantly, never never abandon your ducklings

¬†

These are the five pieces of advice I heard from various sources and eventually took to heart as an XR dev. When I first started my XR journey, the shipping for Quest 2 was weeks away (I think the FedEx or Amazon lads were on strike or something), so I built my AI bot in VR without a headset. Subsequently, an AI Jarvis that I can trigger voice commands, virtual hand grabs, controller grabs, etc. All in my VR project. I didn't use a headset either.¬†[This is my Notion page to prove that I built what I said I did](https://www.notion.so/jimmyding/Jimmy-s-Portfolio-05157e8290e5447fb4b22b3cae202b0d). Building these things without a headset is far from easy, but I did it and I believe anyone else can as well. Google, YouTube, and even ChatGPT (only use it when you are 1. absolutely clueless on how to make it work and need some guidance 2. too lazy to write all the for loops) will help you start off quite smoothly. Ultimately you will learn enough to start your own logic, math, and pain. But before that, be agile and learn from everyone and everything

I don't know how much is considered ""excessive self-promotion"", because I was banned 7 days from¬†[r/OculusQuest](https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/)¬†for offering my discord link in a comment. One lad asked me what type of games I would recommend. I offered him various store links and mine, and I got banned. So ehh... I'm building a community on¬†[Discord](https://discord.gg/js86Rvp8), and I'm building a nostalgia + coffee/ museum time MR project.

No matter how much he rubbed his eyes, there it remained. Watching, with glowing golden eyes fixed on the young boy, never deviating, even for a second.

*An Esper.*¬†Asher‚Äôs heard felt as if it twisted into a knot.¬†*She found another.*

Unable to focus, Asher‚Äôs frenetic gaze darted back and forth between the wolf and the only other pair of golden eyes he knew ‚Äì a crow, hesitantly testing out his wings.

‚ÄúEcho.‚Äù Asher whispered. His voice broke the tenuous silence that not even the birds or frogs dared to disturb ‚Äì leaving nothing but ringing in his ears. ‚ÄúEcho, do you know where Percy‚Äôs house is?‚Äù

A single click from the crow‚Äôs tongue.

‚ÄúTap on his window. Tell him that ‚Äòit‚Äôs back.‚Äô He‚Äôll understand. I know he will.‚Äù

He watched as the bird awkwardly hopped off the table, circling around the room to test his wings before flying outside. Immediately, Asher‚Äôs eyes snapped back to the wolf, still staring at him through the window. His thoughts raced.

*Is he going to try to kill me? What if he attacks me? What should I do?*

He forced himself to breathe slower.¬†*It‚Äôs okay. Calm down. Help is on the way. Just keep your eyes on him. He‚Äôll go back.*

Asher gasped as he heard the fluttering of feathers break the silence. Echo landed on the windowsill, head tilted.

‚Äú‚ÄôNo?‚Äô He wasn‚Äôt there?‚Äù

Two clicks of the tongue.

‚ÄúCheck the downstairs. Maybe he‚Äôs talking with his family or something!‚Äù

Obediently, the crow flew away again. leaving Asher in the same discombobulated mentality. Silently, Asher began going through the mental checklist of everything he could do in his head.¬†*Wind magic? Air compression? Light blasts? What do I have left‚Ä¶?!*

Suddenly, there came a knock at the door. Percy! Immediately, he slammed the window closed and rushed down the stairs. As he flung them open, his heart froze.

After leaning and glancing around the house, a tall female figure with red curly hair and a black frock coat smiled and waved slightly. ‚ÄúHello, Asher.‚Äù

‚ÄúP-Professor Lowell?‚Äù Asher asked nervously.

‚ÄúAre your parents home, by chance? I wanted to talk to you for a moment.‚Äù Professor Lowell asked.

‚ÄúU-uhh‚Ä¶ my parents will be back in a little bit,‚Äù Asher stammered, glancing away.

‚ÄúAh, well, then there‚Äôs no worries. I just saw your little puppy in the backyard and thought to ask about the breed! But I don‚Äôt want to talk about it here if your parents aren‚Äôt around.‚Äù

Immediately, Asher‚Äôs mind clicked. ‚ÄúU-uh‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a cafe at the center of town‚Ä¶ maybe we could go there?‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds perfectly fine to me.‚Äù She smiled. ‚ÄúOh, and do be sure to lock your back door on the way from grabbing your shoes, yes?‚Äù

‚ÄúOne black coffee and one hot chocolate!‚Äù The waiter smiled as he placed the two mugs in front of them.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Professor Lowell smiled and nodded. ‚ÄúI appreciate you all being open so late.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot at all! People need their coffee all times of the day, so I‚Ä¶ I understand.‚Äù With a half yawn, the waiter walked away, clattering metal bouncing in their coinpurse.

Professor Lowell took a sip of her coffee with a satisfied sigh. ‚ÄúBeing Headmistress has its perks, I suppose. So, Asher. You‚Äôre being hunted?‚Äù

Asher shivered. ‚ÄúIs it okay to talk about it here?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf it isn‚Äôt, I‚Äôll slip him a few more,‚Äù she shrugged. ‚ÄúBusiness expense.‚Äù

‚ÄúT-then‚Ä¶‚Äù He sighed. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Why did you knock on my door?‚Äù

‚ÄúI went to visit Percy and saw a crow with golden eyes, pecking on his window. Followed it back.‚Äù

‚ÄúEcho‚Ä¶‚Äù Asher sighed.

‚ÄúApologies if¬†*my*¬†knocking was abrupt or rude. Wasn‚Äôt sure when the wolf would strike.‚Äù

‚ÄúN-no, it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù Asher shook his head. ‚ÄúThank you. You saved me, I think.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I suppose sometimes curiosity¬†*does*¬†save the cat. Anyways. Didn't you said Percy killed it?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶ He did.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why‚Äôs it alive again?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶‚Äù Asher glanced out the window to where Echo was perched, quietly watching the streets. ‚ÄúSee how Echo‚Äôs eyes are gold?‚Äù

‚ÄúAhh‚Ä¶ so you think the faerie queen has a shade magic user of their own.‚Äù

‚ÄúA-and someone strong enough to bring an animal back to life‚Ä¶‚Äù Asher shuddered.¬†*She‚Äôs made all those connections already?!*

‚ÄúBut if Percy was the one that killed it, why is it going after you?‚Äù

Asher paused. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds to me like we‚Äôve a jealous queen, quick to anger and blinded by rage. Hmm. Quite the opposite of you.‚Äù

‚ÄúM-me?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo wonder your shade magic is pure.‚Äù She smiled softly. ‚ÄúI knew you would be fine...‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh‚Ä¶?‚Äù Asher blinked.

‚ÄúListen to me, Asher. If the faerie queen were trying to foment an attack against the town, she would have done so already. Instead, she‚Äôs going after you.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ why‚Ä¶?‚Äù Asher‚Äôs gaze fell.

‚ÄúBecause while you both are giving it your all defending your homes, you‚Äôre everything she‚Äôs not. And that‚Äôs how we‚Äôre going to win.‚Äù

1j0kvkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1j0kvkt/baccarat_hotel_new_york_review/,Baccarat Hotel New York review,"I had high expectations for my first visit to the Baccarat Hotel in New York based on some recommendations I received from friends that had stayed there before. My experience ended up being quite negative, and some of the worst service I've received staying anywhere, even low-end hotels. 

I booked my stay with Amex FHR, and it was for 1 night since I changed my travel dates for my trip and needed to backfill a 1-night stay. I spoke to the hotel around noon and asked if my room was ready, to which I was informed it was. I informed the agent that I would be arriving in 15 minutes as I was close by in midtown. When I arrived at the property, there were not any staff members in the front. My partner and I unloaded our rolling cases and duffel bags and made our way into the hotel. Inside, we found 3-4 staff members chatting with each other, and after making eye contact and continuing to maneuver our luggage to the elevator, one of them stopped us and asked if we needed assistance. As we had already done the main part of carrying the luggage, I informed him that it wouldn‚Äôt be necessary, and we went up the elevator. 

Arriving at the lobby level, we made our way to the reception and passed several staff who were dressed in dark suits and had a very macabre look on their faces, which combined with the dark wooded interior reminded me of being at a very wealthy person‚Äôs funeral. At the desk, we were greeted nicely by the reception agent who informed me that there was no FHR upgrade available but that she was able to offer me the 4 p.m. checkout, which was great. This was probably the best interaction I had in the hotel, even though it was pretty standard and not personable. 

The room was beautiful, although it had some issues. One of the crystal glasses was chipped and scratched my partner‚Äôs finger when he was retrieving it, but no big deal. The bath amenities were also mismatching, with 1 being Ferragamo and the other two the Baccarat scented ones. Again, no big deal. The real issue happened after housekeeping rang my doorbell towards the evening. This caused the doorbell to continue ringing sporadically every 5-15 minutes. After several attempts, I was able to fix it by continually pressing the bell several times. The issue returned the following morning, again after housekeeping dropped some things off, and I was unable to get it to stop. I called down and spoke to the agent, who at first did not believe me. However, she was able to hear the bell ringing two more times while we were on the phone, and she apologized and assured me that someone would take care of it while we were out at breakfast. I never heard from anyone after that conversation, and I do not know if anyone attempted to fix anything. When we returned to the room around noon, the ringing was still happening sporadically. We ended up leaving shortly after, even though we had the 4 p.m. checkout, since we couldn't stand the annoying ringing. I was very disappointed that there was no attempt at following up, either a note in the room or a call from management, but you will see later why I shouldn't have been surprised. 

The service is really where I feel like this property just missed the mark and was below expectations even for a lower-end chain hotel. On day one, I made my way to the La Mer spa to purchase some products with my Spa credit since I wouldn't have time for a treatment. I use La Mer products and was hoping to speak to someone who could recommend some additional steps for my regimen. I expected someone knowledgeable in La Mer products since it was a La Mer-branded spa. However, the staff member that assisted me must have never seen or heard about the products. When I asked her for suggestions, she started picking up the display products and trying to read what they were. I tried explaining to her what I currently use and what I could try, and she just kept picking random boxes from the display case reading them and putting them in front of me. I quickly realized this was a lost cause and just decided to pick up some toner, which I was running low on. When she realized that I was not going to purchase the 7-8 products she picked for me, of which I was already using 5, she got a sour face and checked me out quickly. 
At breakfast the following morning, we were seated quickly by the hostess and were hoping for a nice, calm breakfast to kick off our vacation. The server came to our table and said, ‚Äú Good Morning, are you ordering breakfast?‚Äù I found that odd but said, ‚ÄúYes, we are.‚Äù We both ordered our drinks and figured we would order the food after we had some coffee in us. However, as soon as we ordered the drinks and were placing our menus back down, the server repeated again, slightly more agitated, ""Are you ordering breakfast?"" I again said yes, and we both took the menu and quickly placed an order. Another staff member brought me my iced coffee and a straw. I noticed there were no spoons on the table, which was odd, so I asked him if I could please have a spoon. He looked at me, confused. I repeated, ‚ÄúCan I please have a spoon to stir my iced coffee?‚Äù He pointed at the straw on the table and said, ‚ÄúWe don't have spoons; use the straw,‚Äù and walked away. Honestly, I was so flabbergasted at the response that I do not recall much else about the breakfast experience, but at no point was it getting better. 

A couple of days after checking out, I received a survey request, and I filled it out honestly and thoroughly. To my surprise, I received a response from a hotel manager apologizing for my experience and offering me a complimentary night stay including breakfast. I was honestly surprised, and although I had no intention of returning, I responded to the email and provided my mailing address as requested so they can send the gift certificate. Two weeks had passed, and I had not heard back from anyone. I followed up again to the same two email addresses I had received the request from, and it‚Äôs been another week and a half since then, still with no response and no gift certificate. 

In summary, although this property is beautiful in certain spaces like the restaurant, bar, and rooms, the service falls short of any expectations. I do not know if they were understaffed or what the excuse is, but I also feel that for the price paid, no excuse is valid to explain so many service issues. I understand that things can happen and people can have a bad day, but to have so many misses across multiple areas and then be offered a Service Recovery and even messing that up and not following up is just ridiculous. Good luck to any future guests; I truly hope your experience is far better than my own.",10,1740783587.0,chubbytravel,6,1.0,False
