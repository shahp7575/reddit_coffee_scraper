1krnmny,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinionph/comments/1krnmny/unpopular_opinion_stop_romanticizing_the/,Unpopular Opinion: STOP Romanticizing the PROVINCIAL LIFE!,"I know I'm not the only one seeing this trend. Especially during the holidays, I see a LOT of people online talk or post about traveling to the province to heal, to unwind, to adventure and all that. They post photos and vids of pristine beaches, tall coconut trees, quiet roads, or rows of ancestral houses. Some do storytime about how city life is too fast or too toxic for them. And say that going to the province feels like a return to a slow life.

Let‚Äôs be real here. Do these influencers know that many people in our provinces are poor?

Not every Filipino in the province is living their best life. They did not choose to participate in this *slow living* trend; they are forced into it!

How so? The provinces in the Philippines have the lowest daily wages. Many workers outside of Metro Manila earn way less than their urban counterparts. [While a minimum wage in Metro Manila is around P645 while workers in the provinces earn less](https://www.philstar.com/business/2025/05/02/2439974/city-province-workers-get-different-pay-same-work-why-labor-groups-say-its-unfair). This disparity contributes to a high rate of poverty. PSA says that ""individuals residing in rural areas have [higher poverty incidence at 22.1 percent compared to urban areas at 10.3 percent](https://psa.gov.ph/statistics/poverty).""

Not to mention healthcare is also limited. [Rural working-age adults are more likely to report issues with paying medical bills or delaying care due to cost](https://global.infervision.com/blog/making-healthcare-accessible-in-remote-philippine-islands-with-infervisions-inferair). Aside from stating the obvious that there are fewer hospitals in the provinces, those who suffer from the lack of healthcare are pregnant women, children, and the elderly. Even barangays have less to no doctors in their health centers. All these have greatly impacted services like diagnostic tests, obstetrics, and emergency care.

Yet on TikTok or Facebook or IG, we see influencers post about drinking coffee by the rice fields, feeding farm animals, playing with local children in the streets, staying in a buhay kubo for a weekend, being the main character while oblivious to the suffering of their kapwa-Pilipino. Some even have the gall to pretend to be poor just to get likes. They take photos in old markets, walk barefoot, wear cheap clothes and critic local delicacies to show to the world what *slow living* is like. But these influencers return to their air-conditioned homes in the city and enjoy fast internet when the cameras are off. But what they experienced is not the provincial life. It's just a performance! They take from these communities without giving anything back. They make it their brand to appear charitable. They sell the struggle as their *aesthetic*.

Basic needs like electricity and water are unstable in our provinces. Brownouts can last for hours, sometimes even days especially in remote areas. This unstable supply of electricity severely impacts internet access. [This means students struggle to attend online classes. Also qualified workers cannot apply for jobs that require reliable internet and local businesses cannot grow effectively](https://opinion.inquirer.net/181866/the-need-to-address-rising-costs-and-unreliable-supply-of-electricity).

The provinces are hit hard by corruption. Funds intended for roads, schools and relief often disappear. [It's estimated that P1.6 trillion lost to corruption in the 2024 alone](https://opinion.inquirer.net/182554/redemption-from-corruption). Corrupt practices mean that for ""every road or bridge that collapsed"" is due to millions were funneled to pockets of corrupt officials.

Our provinces are not your playground. They are not your escape plan. They are not your clean slate. People actually live there and they struggle every day. They deserve dignity and not romanticized IG stories.

If you want to go to the province, please go with open eyes. Instead of buying at a provincial Starbucks branch, please support local businesses! And pay fair prices! And if you really care, don‚Äôt just post about it. Push for better wages. Support healthcare access. Call out corruption!

Our provinces are not your healing retreats. These are real places with real people. And they deserve more than your clout-chasing TikTok post.",1,1747796457.0,unpopularopinionph,0,1.0,False

Granted ""right after dinner"" was at 1am in the morning and I woke up at 8am yesterday, so I don't think I was being particularly selfish.

This morning he woke me up at 7am in a horrible mood. First he ranted at me for two hours. He told me he doesn't see me as a person, woman, or wife but as a ""thing."" He told me I was abusing him by forgetting things. I have had a stroke so sometimes I hold my mouth a little crooked without noticing, especially when I'm tired. He kept getting mad at me for it, making fun of me, and calling me ugly.

  
He ordered my to get him food and open beer for him. All the while getting mad whenever I dared to ask questions like ""What do you want to eat?""

I was hungry too so I asked if I could eat to take my medicine. He kept refusing. Finally a few hours in he told me to eat half of the food I had set out for him, so I did. Then he got angry at me. While I was taking my medicine (aspirin and vitamins) he called me a junkie.

  
He told me I couldn't leave for work until the last minute, and that he might not even let me go to work. He guarded the door whenever I went near it.

  
He kept calling me names, and he tried to get me to take an intelligence quiz online. Because he doesn't believe I graduated college. he insists he has to be in charge of everything.

  
He also accused me of cheating with a previous manager and says I even admitted to it. I have never had an affair. I don't have contact with any of my coworkers outside of work. Said manager was a good guy and happily married. No romantic interest in him.

I have to go to the laundromat but he hasn't let me. I didn't want to start another fight by trying to get a shirt from the closet (and they are all really wrinkled, it's embarrassing) so I wore a dirty shirt to work. You can see my bra through it so I have to wear a jacket all day even though it's quite hot.

Oh, and I'm not allowed to drink coffee any more. Again.

1krneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1krneur/a_reflective_journey/,A Reflective Journey,"The pre-dawn chill bit through his thin work jacket as he trudged along the Calgary pavement. Another day, another shift hauling drywall and breathing dust. He was somewhere between his late twenties and early thirties, a distinction that felt meaningless. Time smeared together in a grey haze of exhaustion and cheap beer. His hands, rough and calloused, clenched in his pockets.

His boots crunched on the sidewalk, the only sound competing with the distant rumble of early traffic. His destination, as it was most mornings for years, was The Roasterie. It wasn't just the coffee, though it was good, strong enough to jolt him into a semblance of alertness. It was her. The barista with eyes the colour of warm honey and a smile that seemed, however briefly, to cut through his perpetual gloom. He knew her shifts, her way of tucking a stray strand of hair behind her ear, the lilt in her voice when she called out orders. He'd rehearsed countless opening lines in his head, imagined asking her out, but the words always died in his throat, choked by a certainty of rejection. Today, however, wasn't about courage. Today was different.

He pushed open the door, the bell announcing his arrival with a familiar jingle. The rich aroma of roasting beans enveloped him. She was there, wiping down the counter, her back to him. He ordered his usual ‚Äì black, large ‚Äì the words automatic. When she turned, her usual friendly smile flickered. ""Morning! The usual?""

""Yeah. Thanks,"" he mumbled, avoiding her gaze, fumbling with his debit card. He couldn't look at her, not today. Not when the camping gear and the length of sturdy rope were already packed in the back of his beat-up truck. Today, he was driving west, deep into Kananaskis Country, to find a quiet spot among the pines and end things.
The drive out of the city was a blur of familiar highways giving way to the imposing majesty of the Rockies. As the asphalt turned to gravel and the trees grew denser, a memory surfaced, unbidden. He was small, maybe eight or nine, bouncing in the passenger seat of his dad's old Ford. They were heading into the woods, just like this, but for a weekend of fishing and campfire stories. He remembered the smell of pine needles and engine oil, the weight of his dad's hand on his shoulder, the feeling of absolute safety. A sharp pang of loss hit him, so intense it almost made him pull over. That warmth, that security, had vanished when his dad died, replaced by a cold emptiness.

He parked the truck where the logging road became impassable, hoisted his pack, and started walking. He pulled out the roll of reflective tape, tearing off small strips and tying them to branches every fifty metres or so. Just in case, a small voice whispered, though he tried to silence it. Just in case you change your mind.
The forest deepened, swallowing the sounds of the road. The air grew damp and smelled of earth and decaying leaves. As he pushed through a thicket of underbrush, another memory, sharp and unwelcome, flashed behind his eyes. He was maybe twelve. His mom was slumped in her armchair, the television flickering, an empty bottle beside her. A cigarette smouldered between her fingers, dangerously close to dropping onto the threadbare upholstery. The smell of stale booze and smoke filled the small apartment. He remembered carefully plucking the cigarette from her slack hand, dousing it in the sink, the familiar mix of resentment and weary responsibility settling in his young chest as he struggled to guide her stumbling form to bed.

He walked for what felt like hours, finally finding a small clearing near a trickling creek. He set up the small tent, gathered firewood, and coaxed a fire to life as dusk bled through the canopy. He sat on a log, feeding sticks into the flames, watching the sparks spiral upwards towards the darkening sky. Stars began to prick the deep velvet overhead, countless and indifferent. He tilted his head back, truly looking at them. The sheer scale of it, the vast, silent emptiness dotted with distant, burning suns, made his own pain feel suddenly, strangely small. The finality he craved felt less like a release and more like... nothing. A meaningless erasure in the face of cosmic indifference. Doubt, cold and unfamiliar, crept into his thoughts.

Morning arrived damp and grey. He shivered, kicking dirt over the fire's embers. He packed his meagre supplies, the rope feeling heavy and obscene at the bottom of his pack. He turned to head back, scanning the trees for the first glint of reflective tape. Nothing. He walked a few paces in the direction he thought he‚Äôd come from. Still nothing. He checked his pockets. The roll of tape wasn't there. He must have dropped it, or perhaps misplaced the very last marker he'd tied.

Panic began to bubble in his chest. He started moving faster, circling the clearing, his eyes darting frantically between the trees. Every shadow looked like tape; every fallen leaf mimicked its shape. With the rising panic came the echoes of his mother's voice, slurred and angry, from years of drunken nights: ""Useless... just like your father... always a disappointment... never amount to anything..."" Failure. Lost in the woods, just as he was lost in life. The irony was bitter.

He sank to his knees, the damp earth soaking through his jeans. He couldn't find the way back. The forest felt like it was closing in, confirming what he already believed: he was trapped, hopeless. Maybe... maybe this was how it was supposed to be. The forest would take him, one way or another. His original plan seemed less like a choice and more like the only logical path left.
With numb resolve, he pulled the rope from his pack. He found a sturdy branch on a tall pine, tossed the rope over, and tied a crude but effective noose. Tears blurred his vision as he fashioned the knot, the rough fibres scraping against his skin. He looped the other end around his neck, the weight of it settling ominously. He stepped onto a large, moss-covered rock beneath the branch, took a shaky breath, and closed his eyes. The darkness behind his eyelids wasn't complete; for a fleeting, unbidden instant, an image of the barista's smile ‚Äì genuine, warm, the honey colour of her eyes seeing him, truly seeing him, if only for a moment over a coffee cup ‚Äì cut through the despair. Just as he prepared to step off, to surrender to the void, a tiny flicker of light at the very edge of his vision, even through nearly closed lids, made him hesitate. Low down, near the base of a spruce tree fifty feet away, something shone faintly in the dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves. He squinted. It wasn't a trick of the light. It was small, rectangular, and unmistakably reflective.

The last piece of tape.

He froze, the rope suddenly feeling incredibly tight around his neck. He hadn't lost it. It was right there. A way out.

Slowly, carefully, he loosened the noose, pulling it over his head. His hands were shaking. He stumbled towards the flicker of light, his heart pounding against his ribs. He reached down and touched the smooth plastic surface of the tape, clinging precariously to a low-hanging twig.
Holding it in his hand, looking from the tape to the noose still dangling from the branch, felt like seeing his life split into two distinct paths. One path led to oblivion, the other... back. Back to the truck, back to Calgary, back to the dust and the exhaustion, but also back to the smell of coffee, the possibility of warmth, the memory of his father's hand, the vastness of the stars.

He took it as a sign. Not a divine one, perhaps, but a sign from circumstance, from chance, from the simple fact that he hadn't lost the marker. He wasn't meant to end it here, alone in the woods.
He untied the noose, coiled the rope, and stuffed it deep into his pack. Following the trail of reflective markers, which now seemed blindingly obvious, he walked out of the forest. The drive back to Calgary felt different. The mountains still loomed, but they felt less like judges and more like silent witnesses.

He didn't know what would happen next. He didn't know if he could fix the broken parts of himself. But as he drove towards the city limits, one clear intention formed in his mind. Tomorrow morning, he would go to The Roasterie. And this time, he would say hello. He would look her in the eye and maybe, just maybe, ask her name.

1krnc5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/pitofcrocodiles/comments/1krnc5f/as_promised_here_is_a_detailed_report_of/,"As promised here is a detailed report of crocodile pits and the story of my father who threw me in one, as well as my revelation from Saint Hamudi himself.","Crocodile pits have historically been used as containment enclosures for crocodiles, often in zoos, sanctuaries, or, more grimly, in certain historical and mythological tales involving punishment or intimidation. These pits typically consist of a deep, enclosed area filled with water and mud, mimicking the natural habitat of crocodiles, and can range from simple dugouts to complex enclosures. Due to the territorial and aggressive nature of crocodiles, falling into such a pit can be fatal, making them potent symbols of danger, survival, and primal fear.

I was fifteen when my father decided I was too soft for this world. He was a man of hard edges, all scars and silence, forged in war and steel mills. That summer, we went to an off-grid wildlife compound in the Northern Territory of Australia‚Äîhalf zoo, half hell. The centerpiece was a pit: ten feet deep, murky water, and three crocodiles that looked like living relics from the Cretaceous. One morning, without ceremony, he grabbed me by the collar and said, ‚ÄúYou either sink or stand. Time to find out which.‚Äù Before I could protest, I was airborne‚Äîthen submerged.

I remember the silence under the water first, then the slow, terrifying awareness that something *else* was there. One of the crocodiles glided through the mud-dark water, eyes like dull gold coins, closing in. My limbs locked, panic rising in my throat like bile. And then‚Äî

A blinding light erupted beneath the surface.

Time warped.

From it emerged a figure cloaked in what looked like desert wind and storm clouds. He stood barefoot on the water, and the crocodiles recoiled like shadows meeting dawn.

‚ÄúI am Saint Hamudi,‚Äù he said, voice ringing like thunder in a cathedral. ‚ÄúThe Watcher Between Trials.‚Äù

He reached into the folds of his robe and pulled out a small, obsidian capsule‚Äîglowing faintly, impossibly.

‚ÄúThis is the black pill of truth,‚Äù he said, pressing it to my lips. ‚ÄúSwallow it, and know.‚Äù

I did. Instantly, the world cracked open‚Äîmemories, regrets, illusions peeled away like old paint. I saw my father's pain as a boy. I saw my own future, flickering. I saw the loops. The recursion. The lie of choice.

Saint Hamudi leaned in and whispered, ‚ÄúIt was over before it ever began. Tell them. Across every stream and valley‚Äîtell them.‚Äù

And then he vanished. Just‚Ä¶ gone. The water returned to its stillness. The crocodiles retreated.

I clawed my way to a slippery outcrop and pulled myself out, soaked and shivering. My father stood above with a rope and no expression.

‚ÄúYou climbed out,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMeans you‚Äôre not weak.‚Äù

I never forgave him. But I never feared anything the same way again, either. And I remembered Hamudi‚Äôs words. I‚Äôve been spreading the message ever since, in coffee shops, online forums, graffiti on tunnel walls: **It was over before it ever began.**

I‚Äôm 23F and I had my Gallbladder removed Thanksgiving 2023, I had been having attacks consistently every few weeks for about two months right after i gave birth, After ending up in the hospital for a week when one attack left my liver blocked i finally got it out and i am so happy i did. I am mostly able to eat normally, i dont have any trigger foods per se other than the normal super greasy, fat heavy foods. Only the occasional run to the bathroom after my morning coffee sometimes. Recently however, I had noticed bloating around my upper abdomen, it‚Äôs not painful but can be a little uncomfortable, i also noticed bowel movements occasionally  getting very loose and sometimes it seemed as if it was just straight bile. The symptom i‚Äôm most concerned about is the upper left quadrant pain, i‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a 2/3 on a scale of 1-10 but can be uncomfortable. It comes and goes, not everyday and mostly at night. It is nothing in comparison to a gallbladder attack but as someone who has a history of health anxiety (especially related to that region after living with a swollen gallbladder for two months) I am really concerned it could be pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. i‚Äôm in between doctors but have an appointment set up for next month, I was hoping for some advice or insight anyone had to get me through with my anxiety until i get to see my doctor :) ",1,1747794948.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

There‚Äôs something strangely devotional about it. I sit in silence and Plath whispers in that sharp, silver voice of hers. Not a whisper, really. More like a spell. A slicing.

I‚Äôve been starting my mornings lately with Ariel open on my lap and a chipped mug of coffee in my hands... no sugar,  just bitterness and heat and Plath.

Reading Ariel in the morning feels like being flung headfirst into cold water. You emerge breathless, a little stunned, but painfully aware of your own skin. Her words aren‚Äôt meant to soothe
... they awaken. ‚ÄúThe dew that flies / Suicidal‚Äù clings to your throat long after you close the book.

There‚Äôs something about her velocity, her momentum. She doesn‚Äôt linger. She devours. And yet there‚Äôs such strange, crystalline beauty in the wreckage she leaves behind. Her poems don‚Äôt explain themselves. They demand to be felt.

And maybe that‚Äôs why I keep returning to them at the break of day, when the body is still soft with sleep and the mind hasn‚Äôt yet built its armor. Her voice cuts clean through.

I know some people start their mornings with meditation, with calm, with clarity. I start mine with Sylvia. With wild metaphors and the taste of metal and sky. With fury, fragility, and a little bit of fire in my chest.",4,1747794881.0,Indianbooks,0,1.0,False

1krn1of,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1krn1of/i_conquered_my_anxiety_and_now_i_dont_have/,I conquered my anxiety and now I don‚Äôt have emotions,"I used to be anxious and overly emotional. Everyday occurrences were loaded with sentimental attachments, deep significance, longing, joy, pain - I would routinely get choked up from a 15-second commercial on TV or a brief interaction with a stranger. My emotions would run high at the anticipation of wearing a new pair of shoes, of going to a new coffee shop. I understood most people didn‚Äôt get quite as worked up about small everyday occurrences like I did. 


For better and for worse, I was frequently overwhelmed throughout my day to day life by the enormity and emotional weight of nothing at all. 
It was a frustrating way to live and it was exhausting. But I also really treasured my connection to my memories, my feelings and my connection to some existential mystery which felt both burdensome and pleasant at the same time

As I‚Äôve gotten older I‚Äôve found that my emotions are almost nonexistent. I still respond to basic stimuli - things still feel good and bad - but the deeper emotional richness of excitement, melancholy, elation, terror, envy, awe, wonder, yearning, bliss - those states are all left behind and it‚Äôs hard to remember what they really felt like. 

My memory has also gotten horrible. I think I used to catalogue my experiences by the emotions they made me feel. Now that I don't experience those feelings anymore and I can't really remember how they felt, my brain isn't able to file away new memories or recall old memories like it used to. 

But life is much easier now. I'm able to take on new challenges better, I take better care of myself, I embarrass myself less, I can prioritize things more effectively, I don't get hung up in analysis paralysis and I don't get lost in circular thinking. I just do whatever I think needs to be done. 

I‚Äôve got a family now. I feel responsible for their well being every single day. I think subconsciously I believe I can‚Äôt afford to have the highs and lows of intense emotions because I can‚Äôt afford to be under their influence and have it impact me negatively. 

I also think it‚Äôs related to my phone addiction. I listen to podcasts all throughout the day while working and then a lot of scrolling when I get home. I‚Äôm having a hard time unplugging. 

I feel like the only way to get my emotions back would be to either take like 2 months off of work and go on a road trip by myself or to take psychedelics again. I‚Äôm not in a position to do either. Psychedelics make me depressed and schizo and I can't go travel solo cuz I'm a dad with young kids

1krmzb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1krmzb4/brain_cake/,Brain Cake,"‚ÄúThese may be the final words I write, for after dusk I‚Äôm uncertain of what my fate will become. I know what roams out there, what it yearns, it will not have it. These entries have been the only place for me to record what has been happening. I‚Äôve recorded it‚Äôs every move, its patterns, I know now. But still, after everything I‚Äôm uncertain; it knows more about me than I do about it. Yet still, tonight I slay it.‚Äù

This was the last thing my granddad left before his disappearance. I flipped over the wrinkled stained paper, observing my granddad‚Äôs signature on the back, ‚ÄúHubert Davis‚Äù. I looked back up at my dad confused. He returned the gaze with a look of worry and anguish in his face, although he quickly choked it back and covered it up.

‚ÄúSon, what do you make of it?‚Äù He said it firmly, yet I could tell he genuinely wanted my feedback.

‚ÄúWhat even is this?‚Äù It was odd, he had given me the eerie ramblings of our granddad seemingly out of the blue.

‚ÄúWell, you and me both know my pops kinda lost it before the whole incident. I was thinkin‚Äô maybe you got something to pitch in.‚Äù

I looked back down at the writings on the paper. It was odd, yet nothing I wouldn‚Äôt have expected from an old man losing his marbles. The strangest thing of all of this was my dad giving me this. The doctors already said it; we both knew granddad had been suffering hallucinations and seeing things as the tumour developed. So why then give me this paper reaffirming things all these years later?

‚ÄúSon, do you really think a tumour would do all that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, uh‚Ä¶ probably. I‚Äôm no doctor or anything dad. Why are you even bringing all this up?‚Äù

My dad seemed to stare past me as he reclined back in his chair, butting out his cigarette in the dark stained ash tray. He took a deep breath, letting out a small sigh before looking back at me.

‚ÄúSon, have you ever thought about what he meant? I mean his ramblings, they droned on, yet there was always something he kept focus on.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? What like a- ‚Äú

‚ÄúNo, listen for a second boy, hush.‚Äù

There was a long and tense pause as we both sat in the warm living room. The rain tapped the roof of the farmhouse as my dad hunched forward in his chair and I waited in baiting anticipation. I could see his eyes darting across the room, the couch, the window, the door, the window, the shelf, the window. It startled me really, so I turned back to maybe catch what he was trying to find. Couch, window, door, window, shelf, window.

‚ÄúSon, why don‚Äôt we both get some rest? It‚Äôs late now and we‚Äôve got some heavy liftin‚Äô to catch up on tomorrow.‚Äù

I turned back to my dad; he looked at his watch as he stumbled himself forward and up out of the reclining chair. I got up from my seat and give him a firm hug before we both parted for the night. The way he acted had me worried, he was definitely hiding something. The whole interaction had uneased me, but I quickly settled down to prepare for bed.

I was down in the kitchen by myself grabbing a glass of water to bring back up to bed. The cold glass of the cup in my hand as I walked to the sink, feeling every rough spot in the floor. Outside still, the rain poured onto the farmhouse. I thought to myself, ‚ÄúThe crops are gonna be drinking well tonight.‚Äù I came to the sink, feeling the drowsiness already taking over my body as I turned the old tap and let the water run. *Pat-pat-pat-pat.* The rain came down as I watched the glass fill. *Pat-pat-pat-pat-pat.* Halfway full, my gaze trailing away from the glass and out the window. *Pat-pat-pat.* I looked out the kitchen window overlooking the front yard. *Pat-pat-SLAM!* Something I couldn‚Äôt see banged into the glass of the window in front of me. The sound sent me tumbling backward, dropping my nearly full glass of water onto myself. I looked up at the window from the floor to see a large shadow in the window before the loud crash of the glass shattering on the floor startled it away.

My dad was quick getting to the kitchen after hearing all the commotion. ‚ÄúWhat is it son?‚Äù my dad commanded as he charged into the kitchen with a wooden bat uplifted. ‚ÄúI-I could have sworn that I saw, uhm... something in the window. It was too dark to see what, and it hit the glass.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have seen it. And I know what it yearns.‚Äù

‚ÄúWh- dad what are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúGo to your bedroom and rest now. I will stay up and ensure that nothing happens anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut, what, I can‚Äôt just leave you.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is fine‚Ä¶ you-, Brent, son. I am fine just here.‚Äù

Something was different about him than earlier back in the living room. He was no longer acting strange, he was confident, he was ready. He kept the bat lifted, ready, his face was expressionless.

‚ÄúInside of my room you will find tucked in the night stand a key, I want you to have it.‚Äù He simply looked forward as he said this, unwavering in his stance. ‚ÄúIt is a key to uh‚Ä¶ uhm, a box.‚Äù He trailed off as he remained still. I didn‚Äôt argue, it was all so bizarre. I passed my dad, his eyes were cloudy, and his body looked relaxed yet still kept that defensive pose. He said nothing else, simply kept his blank stare aimed at the kitchen window. I wanted answers, what was happening? Why did he seem so different? I made my way up the creaking stairs and down the hallway. Into his room, right where he said was a rusted key. I took it and stuffed it into my pocket before a loud crash came from downstairs. I sprinted as fast as I could out the room, down the hall and stairs to the kitchen, yet he was gone.

It‚Äôs fifty years later now. I have a family, a career, and the keys to that old farmhouse. I recollect that night near vividly, and I haven‚Äôt seen my dad since despite the extensive investigations to find him. I rummage through my leather handbag, tossing aside pill bottles and junk as I dig for the keys to the farmhouse. I feel the dirty brass as I grab a hold of the keys from the bottom of my bag and pull them out. The keys are cold, with scratches and wear suggesting its use.

I take a step out of my car and begin my way up to the farmhouse. *Step‚Ä¶ Step‚Ä¶ Step‚Ä¶* Halfway up the front lawn and I can see the wear of the farmhouse. It‚Äôs been left here for many years now; abandoned ever since the night my dad vanished. *Step‚Ä¶ Step‚Ä¶ Step‚Ä¶* Making my way up onto the porch steps. The creak and snap of old and rotten wood shrieks as I lightly put my foot down onto each step. The front door is covered in peeling paint and scratches. There are several shattered windows with fauna growing out of them. *Step‚Ä¶ Step‚Ä¶* I swing open the front door easily. I‚Äôm not even sure why I thought I would need the keys for this rugged old place. I explore the nostalgia of a liminal yet familiar home, I begin recollecting the memories of my childhood and early adult years spent here. I recall a memory with granddad before his diagnosis. I was thirteen‚Ä¶ maybe fourteen at the time and we were in the living room talking about life. I remember a story he told me; his face changed to a puzzled look as he began looking around the room and began to speak to me.

‚ÄúBrent, do you know where granddad put his glasses?‚Äù I remember him having trouble with memory at this point in time. We both quickly found them; they were next to him on the coffee stand.

‚ÄúBrent, there was a time where I uh‚Ä¶ a time that I had no care for the world at all. All of my experiences, the past, I kept it behind me. But soon, Brent, you‚Äôll wish they could always stay. Cherish it.‚Äù It always stuck with me those words. I remember them specifically as it was one of the last times I got to see my granddad before he passed from that heart attack.

I investigate the living room, unsure of what exactly I am looking for. In the reclining chair my dad used to always sit in I could see the fresh outline of a person in the chair, silhouetted by the old dust. Nobody should have been here, this place hasn‚Äôt been in use for a long time. Who‚Äôs been living in the farmhouse? Whoever, somebody has been here, it made me uneasy. I peeked around the corner to the stairwell, the moonlight peering onto the stairs from a small window. I observe my surroundings; cold, isolated, and eerie. It feels as if it‚Äôs a new place I‚Äôve never been, but that couldn‚Äôt be right.

I begin making my way up the stairs when I hear something. I take a pause and listen for a second, trying to comprehend what I‚Äôm hearing. It sounds like‚Ä¶ it sounds like something‚Äôs walking downstairs. An animal? Or worse, an intruder? I turn my head to the source of the noise; it‚Äôs in the living room. Were they watching me the whole time? I keep looking, preparing myself, adrenaline and fear begins to rush in my mind as my breathing goes heavy. The steps get closer, moving in like a snail as my body stiffens. I hear them, no, it‚Äôs not a person, I hear it call out, ‚ÄúBreeent, where are you?‚Äù It‚Äôs voice is terrible, it sounds like a hundred voices into one. I see it‚Äôs hand come writhing around the corner, gripping the wall as it begins pulling its own weight in through the doorframe.

I bolt immediately up the stairs and down the hall like lightning. Behind me I hear the voice continue to call my name, it‚Äôs taunting me it knows more about me than I do of it. I knock down a picture frame in my rush, glass crashing as it hits the floor. I hear that monster pulling itself up the stairs as it pants out my name. I run into the closest room, I grab the nearest heavy object and push it in front of the door. It‚Äôs making its way down the hall now, the calling of my name replaced with a hyena‚Äôs cackle and the howl of a pained beast.

The lights in the room are already on, looking around I can‚Äôt recognize any of it but I know I‚Äôve been here, I‚Äôve had to it‚Äôs my house. I begin scavenging the room, anything to fight the monster that‚Äôs now banging on the door. It calls out my name, ‚ÄúBrent dearie what‚Äôs gotten into you?‚Äù The voice of a woman calls from the other side of the door, concerned. I feel as I know the voice, despite having never heard it before. I look under the bed, behind spilled boxes of Aricept and wrinkled, stained papers is my dad‚Äôs old bat. I pull it out and take my stance behind the box. The box? I remember, my dad needed me to see in there. In there, what is there? I know what I have, I have it for the box. I take it out, rusty, and open the box. Papers, checkup reports, pills. There it is my granddad‚Äôs final note after all these years. The lights turn off as I grab the paper, plummeting me into the darkness. I stare, looking, I‚Äôm seeing it. I see it, his writing, the signature, ‚ÄúHubert Rich‚Äù. I sit in the darkness, it‚Äôs darker than dark. The void. Beyond the door the woman still calls my name. The void sings to me, a familiar tune, my favourite song. What‚Äôs the paper? Where am I? The door is open now, the darkness surrounding me as the monster embraces me. I can see it, I know what it yearns. I know now.",1,1747794422.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

So, getting older is not without it's challenges. Wear and tear on the body. Love, loss, death, laughter, tears. Car accidents. Being chased by armed pimps. Various ailments popping up on your journey to the end of your time on this mortal coil. 

The last one is what I would like to talk about. 

My day started much like any other day. Alarm at 5:30 a.m.
Take care of them hekkin doggos, immediately. 
Coffee.
Dressed.
More coffee.
Drive.
Clock in.
More coffee.
Fuck off and get paid.
You get the picture. 

However the past 2 days have been different in one very important way. 

I HAVEN'T POOPED. Hot wings, ghost pepper chips, fiesta chicken casserole. And no action.  

Well after work I go get some Big T's Bbq, take some muscle relaxers and get ready to shower. As I give a rib bone to Luna I feel gassy. I decided to cut loose since my lady was in the other room. I gambled and lost. 

What I had assumed was your run-of-the-mill, garden variety flatulence was actually a pivotal moment in my existence. 

As I relaxed my sphincter to casually allow the gas to pass without much fanfare, what I can only describe as a grapefruit sized ball of molten feces found it's way out.

As I felt the sudden presence of solid matter wherein only a fart should be present, I attempted to slam my sphincter but alas, I was too late. The sudden pressure of matter accompanied by the hot, wet squish assured me....I had sharted.

Panic was instantaneous. I leapt to my feet, lest the contact of feces to cotton turned my underpants into a colonic Armageddon. Much to my chagrin, I was at the furthest point in my house from my commode.

With steely resolve, I had determined to handle this matter with as much poise and grace possible. However as I begin my sobering journey to my salvation, my girlfriend makes requests of me. I am hardly aware of the content of these requests. I just need to get clean.

I had vastly underestimated the volume of contents from this malignant shart. Every step, every twitch, every attempt to get closer with cleanliness pushes me further into my own mire. It pushes and squishes out omnidirectionally. It is staining my very existence. 

I finally make it to my bathroom, grab the wipes and begin to clean up....or so I had thought. Working blind, I reach back to start wiping away my sin, only to have it streak my hand. I am getting frustrated at this point.

Then I feel a bubbling. I instinctively sit on the toilet and become acutely aware that my posterior is basted in my own hatred. It is too late. I resign myself to cleaning the toilet before showering.  

Now at this point I understand that when a prescription pill bottle say: May Cause Diarrhea,  what it is actually saying is that by ingesting their poison you are agreeing to summon a balrog from the bowels of the Absu and into the bowels of mankind. 

What happened next was the shame of 10,000 years. As I let go with every fiber of my being the freshly summoned shit demon asserts his will by forcing my body to attempt ejecting all of my major organs in alphabetical order through my treasonous mud pussy.

After a few highly productive heaves, and having my ass flaps speckled in a fresh spackling of errant feces, I feel empty and hollow. I feel as though an entire Thanksgiving meal for 12 has left my digestive tract. I begin the process of cleaning the toilet and forgiving myself. 

I put on Pandora and plan on drifting off wherever the music takes me. As I begin the act of cleansing this barren flesh I get that familiar bubbling again. I stiffen.

I am caught between attempting to exit and land on my toilet without turning my bathroom into a scat/snuff scene or swallowing my pride and putting a hot dagger into what remains of my porous dignity. I choose the latter. 

I will spare the traumatic details. It is too soon. 

As I resume a thorough sandblasting of my flesh it occurs to me that I had recently purchased a new black&gold body poof for football season. I surely cannot sully these colors.I  look for an old poof......success! 

So now I  sit here, traumatized, weary of farts, yet clean.

Date: 5/18/2024

33- Male

My Scores:
	‚Ä¢	RAADS-R: 143
(Above threshold for ASD, strongest in social relatedness and sensory-motor domains)
	‚Ä¢	AQ (taken previously): 32
(Above typical threshold; test taken during earlier phase of exploration)
	‚Ä¢	CAT-Q (Camouflaging Autistic Traits): High overall masking
	‚Ä¢	Especially high on Compensation and Assimilation
	‚Ä¢	EQ/SQ (Empathy/Systemizing):
	‚Ä¢	EQ: Low (slightly disagree to neutral on many empathy-related questions)
	‚Ä¢	SQ: High (very strong on pattern/system reasoning)


My Lived Experience:
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve spent most of my life masking heavily scripting social interactions, mimicking others, and repressing a lot of natural behavior to fit in.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve always had a strong tendency toward intense, focused interests (coffee, video games, geology, true crime, self-improvement, etc.), and I tend to immerse myself fully, often to the exclusion of everything else.
	‚Ä¢	I experience what I now recognize as emotional shutdowns, alexithymia, and a flat affect when overwhelmed or burned out, but I rarely ‚Äúmeltdown‚Äù in the stereotypical sense.
	‚Ä¢	Social situations feel draining unless they‚Äôre very structured or interest-based. I often miss subtext, take things literally, and struggle with reading people unless I‚Äôm consciously analyzing them.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm very sensitive to sensory input,lights, noise, fabrics and I have routines that are soothing but sometimes rigid. I also eat the same foods over and over for sensory consistency.
	‚Ä¢	I was evaluated once in the past, but the clinician said I didn‚Äôt meet the criteria. At the time I was:
	‚Ä¢	Masking hard
	‚Ä¢	On ADHD medication
	‚Ä¢	Trying to ‚Äúpresent well‚Äù without realizing how much that would skew things
I didn‚Äôt feel seen or understood, and in hindsight I don‚Äôt trust that evaluation anymore.

What I‚Äôm Looking For:

I‚Äôd love honest feedback from others in the autistic community who:
	‚Ä¢	Were told ‚Äúno‚Äù at first but got a diagnosis later
	‚Ä¢	Relate to the high-masking, high-functioning-outside / falling-apart-inside pattern
	‚Ä¢	Feel like they had to decode their own brain without clinical support
	‚Ä¢	Believe in or understand self-identification when the formal system fails us

I‚Äôm not asking for diagnosis advice or permission to use the label, just looking for connection, shared experience, and perspective. I want to better understand if what I‚Äôm going through really aligns with autism or if I‚Äôm missing something.

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read and share, I really appreciate your insight.

Help?,"Alrighty, I need this to be explained to me like I'm 5 years old, because to be frank my doctors seem to be sick of me. If I Google, I get anxious and then I get PVCs so I don't want to Google. 

I need to understand possibly why now, out of all the times in my life, do I get PVCs now. Part of me wonders if I'm just getting dismissed.

Let me give you my background.

I have been diagnosed with PVCs since September now. Originally, I thought I was dying. Felt like every time I would lay down every minute or so, someone was smacking the wind out of me. I would often gasp, sit up, and it would stop. Fast heart rate would follow. 

Before September, in August I was diagnosed with two different strains of ecoli that was incredibly difficult to treat, to the point I was hospitalized for 4 days. Lots of antibiotics, lots of anti nausea medicine, lots of blood tests. 

Before the ecoli I had started ozempic 2 months prior. 

Before that, I was diagnosed with pots 11 years prior. I never even had PVCs with pots. 

Before I had PVCs I'd smoke weed on the daily, multiple joints. I'd drink about two sodas a day, but a coffee every now and again. I was sensitive to caffeine and it would only increase my HR. I was on propranolol and I was an active jogger and weight lifter. I did struggle with low blood pressure. 


After getting the diagnosis of PVCs I was given a stress test where I ran on a treadmill for a few minutes and see if I got any PVCs. I did not. But I did get a very high HR quickly. 

I also got a blood test done for my ferritin and it was at 11. My iron was fine. I got transfusions and I will be done with my transfusions this week. 

I also found out I need a sleeping aid as I apparently now hold my breath at times when I sleep, and I'll be getting the machine this week. 


I cannot workout now, as I get massive PVCs *after* I workout, when I lay down. It feels like an eel trying to swim out of my throat. It's scary. I also face low HR while laying down after I workout. 

Since the hospital in August, I no longer have caffeine (not even chocolate) or smoke weed, or drink at all. 

I'm scared to try, I want to go back to how I was before. I'm almost 30 and I am confused.

The System Avatar told me Byrne kept his runeweaving skills even after parting ways, and it was also safe to assume that his scientific knowledge had given him a massive mana pool with access to the Fountain. Byrne was a Scholar, which meant he had decent detection skills, access to mana barriers, and offensive mana manipulation. I couldn‚Äôt discard the fact that Byrne most likely had access to natural magic on top of his System skills.¬†

The carriage wheels rattled against the wide cobbled path. I couldn‚Äôt tell if the houses in the wealthy district were made of marble or a different white stone. Each house had a unique shape with hanging gardens and small vineyards. Unlike other walled cities, Cadrians seem to have little regard for space. It was hard to put it in words, but the wealthy district was ‚Äòwide‚Äô and ‚Äòopen‚Äô. The houses didn‚Äôt lean over the others like they were fighting for space. There were no shadowy spots for water to accumulate.¬†

The carriage slowed down.

‚ÄúIt seems the bridge is undergoing repairs, Lord Clarke,‚Äù the coachman said.

I looked forward on the road. The stone bridge was suspended in the air, and the stream parted in two while the builder crew replaced the foundations. Along the canal, a line of old men watched the crew work. If I had to guess, the old men were high-level merchants, craftsmen, and veteran soldiers lucky enough to have formed ties to nobility.¬†

The carriage detoured a few blocks south, crossed the inner wall, and entered the eastern market. Everything was the same as the day I arrived at Cadria. Rows of vendors hawked their wares, and shoppers fought for better prices. People moved through hanging bridges over the street. Elevated wood platforms hosted even more stands and booths.¬†

The street was packed to the brim, and the carriage moved at a snail's pace.

‚ÄúI'll get off here. Wait for me in Farcrest‚Äôs Alchemists Guild Branch,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúAs you command, Lord Clarke,‚Äù the coachman replied, pulling the reins and stopping the carriage.

I jumped over the guardrail before the coachman could climb down the carriage and deploy the retractable stairs. I smoothed the fall with \[Minor Aerokinesis\], and an old man yelled at me for disturbing his cloak. I ignored him. With the selection exam around the corner, I had little time to spare. I got lost in the crowd, letting \[Foresight\] guide me through the sea of people.¬†

Like the rest of Ebros, the city was mostly made of humans, but there were a considerable number of gnomes and beastfolk. Half-elves weren‚Äôt completely uncommon, although I only noticed a handful of pureblood elves. Orcs and half-orcs were somewhat rarer, which was logical considering the distance between the capital and the northern frontier, where orcs were more common. Harpies didn‚Äôt even bother walking the streets. Instead, they soared into the sky above the rooftops.

I made a mental note of the things I needed.

I approached a small forge in the street corner, somewhat away from the human sea that was the market. \[Foresight\] allowed me to guess how much the owner was trying to overcharge me. When the old blacksmith realized he wouldn‚Äôt fleece me any time soon, he offered me a five percent discount. Although I only intended to get a grasp of the local prices, I still bought a bag of nails and a few small iron discs with a high enchantment threshold. I had only a vague idea of how to prepare for my eventual encounter with Byrne, but I knew I would have to do a lot of enchanting, and iron was a great material to test enchantments. High-quality items had higher enchantment thresholds, so I couldn‚Äôt spare any expense if I wanted to increase my survival rate.

I walked down the market, wondering about my next step.

As far as I knew, Byrne was still a Scholar regardless of the exotic skills that made him the supervisor of the Arcane Circle. My main goal was to counter his mana manipulation. Unknowingly, I had already developed the greatest weapon against a spellcaster: the MDBC ammo. If I could give \[Mana Exhaustion\] to Byrne, I would render his offensive and defensive capabilities useless.

A small handgun would have been the perfect weapon, although there was a reason I didn‚Äôt bring one with me: it was too eye-catching, efficient, and hard to explain. I needed something more discreet, something that could pass as a regular, harmless item to an unsuspecting onlooker. Bows, crossbows, and daggers were probably off the list. As much as my encounter with Byrne could end up in a combat to the death, I would prefer to have the option to neutralize him and ask questions.

‚ÄúWhat would Ilya say?‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúProbably a quote from Sun Tzu.‚Äù

Unlike all my previous opponents, Byrne was the closest thing to a mirror matchup. My \[Mana Mastery\] was stronger than my elemental skills, so it was safe to assume Byrne‚Äôs \[Mana Mastery\] would be enough to counter my \[Minor Pyrokinesis\] and \[Minor Geokinesis\]. However, I had a crucial advantage over a regular Scholar. Speed. As powerful as mana manipulation was, Scholars lacked any movement skill. Byrne, in particular, probably lacked Lv.6 \[Swordsmanship\] and \[Light-Footed\].

In close-quarter combat, I had the absolute advantage.

Now, I needed to figure out how to maximize my chances of getting there.

‚ÄúLord Clarke?‚Äù

A tired voice called my name. I turned to find Osprey and Willow, halberds in hand, patrolling the market. Their shiny armor made them stand out from the crowd. Osprey wasn‚Äôt any less exhausted than the first time we met. His shoulders were hunched forward, but even with that, his head protruded above the crowd like he was a tree. Willow didn‚Äôt seem any less energetic, her gnomish smile covering her face from ear to ear.

‚ÄúOsprey, Willow, it's good to see you well,‚Äù I greeted them.

‚ÄúSee? He remembers us!‚Äù Willow said in a good mood. ‚ÄúHow did your meeting with Astur go, mister?‚Äù

Osprey was appalled, probably because Willow wasn‚Äôt using the proper formal address. It might be just a hunch, but I was starting to understand why Osprey was Willow‚Äôs companion. Maybe he was there to control her. I grinned. One way or another, I had made it clear that casual talking was okay with me from the first moment.

‚ÄúThanks for asking, Willow. That meeting didn‚Äôt go as expected. I got recruited. I‚Äôm an instructor at the Academy for the remainder of the year,‚Äù I admitted.

The gnome girl seemed amazed.

‚ÄúWhere is your escort, Lord Clarke?‚Äù Osprey interjected before Willow could say anything.

‚ÄúI think I just found it,‚Äù I replied.

Osprey gave me an apologetic bow.

‚ÄúLord Captain‚Äôs orders. Nobles must have an escort at all times.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go, then,‚Äù I said.

I continued my shopping trip with the rattling noise of Osprey and Willow‚Äôs armor right behind me. If anything, their presence helped me traverse the crowd. As I was dressed like a commoner, nobody could tell I was ‚Äòimportant‚Äô at first glance. My good mantle had been shredded during my fight with Red and his lackeys, so I was back to my old simple attire.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThere are stores in the inner wall more suitable for an Imperial Instructor, Lord Clarke. May I ask what you are looking for out here in the‚Ä¶ people‚Äôs market?‚Äù Osprey asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm planning a murder,‚Äù I replied, looking over my shoulder with a mischievous smile. Using designer clothes to dress for murder would be a massive target on my back. I needed something more standard.

‚ÄúOh? Who‚Äôs dying?‚Äù Willow asked, suddenly invested in the conversation.

Osprey smacked Willow‚Äôs shoulder.

‚ÄúLord Clarke is joking.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course I am,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWho is the best tailor in the eastern market?‚Äù

Osprey guided me into a parallel street. There were still a lot of people circulating, but not as many as the human sea on the main street. The stores were more humble, but still leagues above what one could find in Farcrest. Not five minutes later, Osprey pointed towards a store with a hand-drawn hanging sign‚Äîa green swallow threading a needle.

Osprey opened the door for me, and Willow entered first.

I wasn‚Äôt expecting to be announced.

‚ÄúAttention, mosslickers! Lord Clarke decided to bless your booth with his presence. Try not to disappoint him.‚Äù

Two gnome women dressed in green dresses turned around, startled. One was old, with streaks of white hair and wrinkles around the mouth. The other was a young blonde gnome, probably not much older than Ilya, but much shorter.

‚ÄúStop fooling around and return to work, Willow,‚Äù the old one said.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not fooling this time, Isolde,‚Äù Osprey said in a tired voice despite it being barely past noon. ‚ÄúPlease be respectful to Lord Clarke. He is a legitimate noble.‚Äù

The gnome woman cleared her throat and smoothed the wrinkles in her dress.

‚ÄúHow can a humble tailor serve you today, my lord?‚Äù she asked with a deep bow.

I looked around the shop. Calling it humble didn‚Äôt do it justice. Every shirt, jacket, and pair of pants seemed top-notch quality. Compared to what you‚Äôd find in Farcrest, this was leagues ahead. Even by modern Earth standards, the colors were vibrant, and \[Foresight\] ensured me the stitching would last at least two generations of Clarkes.¬†

‚ÄúI need a good tunic, shirt, and breeches. I will also need leather gloves, a mantle, and a cloak. Everything in black and without markings, if possible,‚Äù I said as my eyes went through the cabinets and racks.

Osprey gave me a worried look, but Willow quietly told him it was probably winter fencing clothing.

‚ÄúLord Clarke wants to go unnoticed among commoners, perhaps?‚Äù the older clerk cautiously asked.

‚ÄúLord Clarke went unnoticed among commoners for decades until the Marquis decided to make him a thane. Then everyone started to make a huge fuss about him,‚Äù I jokingly replied.¬†

The clerk giggled.

‚ÄúI understand, my lord,‚Äù she said, dropping into a curtsy so exaggerated that it bordered on parody.

I knew I passed the gnome vibe-check.

Isolde handed me a few garments and guided me into the fitting room. Unsurprisingly, shopping for clothes was much more entertaining in a magical world. As I tested different tunics, the clerk told me that the same five tailors supplied every piece at the Green Swallow: the owner and four of their apprentices. No two garments were identical, but their uniqueness wasn‚Äôt enough to track them back to the store. I could tell the apprentices were trying to make ‚Äòsomething‚Äô. If I had to guess, they were well above Lv.25.

This time, however, I wasn‚Äôt trying to make a fashion statement. I needed a high enchantment threshold, so I used \[Identify\] on each garment Isolde handed me. I couldn‚Äôt help but smile as Osprey and Willow patiently waited by the sidelines as I examined the clothes. They must‚Äôve thought I was a picky buyer.

After a while, the younger clerk had a sizeable pile of clothes on her arms.¬†

**Exquisite Murkhog Glove. \[Identify\] Enchantment threshold: 2100.**

**Exquisite Murkhog Glove. \[Identify\] Enchantment threshold: 2100.**

**Quality Brammel Cloak. \[Identify\] Enchantment threshold: 1300.**

**Quality Brammel Tunic. \[Identify\] Enchantment threshold: 1200.**

**Quality Skeeth Belt. \[Identify\] Enchantment threshold: 900.**

**Simple linen mantle. \[Identify\] Enchantment threshold: 600.**

**Simple linen shirt. \[Identify\] Enchanted threshold: 300.**

**Simple linen breeches. \[Identify\] Enchantment threshold: 300.**

I couldn‚Äôt find mantles, shirts, and breeches made of any special material, so I had to settle for regular ones. Not that it mattered. The most important parts were the gloves and the outer layers.¬†

The blonde gnome hopped on a stool and took my measurements to adjust the fit of the garments. I watched as she cut the fabric with the tip of her finger, and then made it whole again with a pass of her hand. The girl was a Mender.

‚ÄúWould you like something to drink while Young Milly adjusts the fittings, Lord Clarke? We have Selka tea and Red Moss infusion,‚Äù Isolde said.

‚ÄúRed Moss sounds good,‚Äù I said.

Osprey gave me a confused look. He hadn‚Äôt moved from the window since we arrived.¬†

‚ÄúAre you sure? Only gnomes like Red Moss infusion. It tastes like muddy water.‚Äù

Isolde returned with a steaming cup and invited me to sit at the coffee table in the corner of the room. The infusion smelled like freshly brewed coffee. I was starting to understand why gnomes called each other ‚Äòmosslickers‚Äô.

‚ÄúWhat about me, Issy?‚Äù Willow asked, looking at my cup with prying eyes.

‚ÄúYou are not a customer, Willy,‚Äù Isolde mockingly replied. ‚ÄúIf you want to be treated like a customer, actually buy something.‚Äù

I zoned out from the argument between the gnomes and blew the steam from the cup. It smelled like Green Moss tea, although the contents looked like proper black coffee. I took a sip. It also tasted like Green Moss‚Äîalmost identical to coffee‚Äîbut there was something different about it. I took another sip, and my body felt electrified.

The System prompt violently popped in front of my eyes.

**You have obtained Caffeinated Lv.1. Temporary.**

My heart skipped a beat.

‚ÄúHoly mother of insomnia, this is strong,‚Äù I muttered.

‚ÄúTold you it tasted like muddy water,‚Äù Osprey pointed out.

‚ÄúMuddy water? More like the elixir of the gods,‚Äù I replied, downing half of the cup despite the infusion‚Äôs temperature. My class had enough Endurance to protect my entrails against hot liquids.

Isolde offered me another cup and I couldn‚Äôt help but accept.

By the time Young Milly finished the adjustments, I was the proud owner of six stacks of Caffeinated, and my hands were starting to tremble.

‚ÄúYou have a good eye, Lord Clarke. If I‚Äôm not mistaken, you picked only pieces sewn by the master,‚Äù Isolde said.

‚ÄúI have a good eye for things, but not so much for people, I fear,‚Äù I replied, thinking about Janus and Holst.¬†

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt blame yourself. People are usually more complex than cloaks and shirts.‚Äù

I paid for the garments, and Isolde put the money inside an enchanted coffer. Maybe it was the caffeine, but the runes appeared on the surface of the lock even without straining my mana sense: User-Activation-Force-Bind-Reinforce plus a Recharge-Instantaneous core to power up the enchantment.

‚ÄúThere are two silver pieces too many,‚Äù Isolde pointed out.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for the service and the coffee,‚Äù I replied.

Isolde and Milly walked me outside and said goodbye with a well-practiced curtsy.

‚ÄúYou have a way with gnome ladies, if I may say so, Lord Clarke,‚Äù Osprey said when we left the Green Swallow behind and returned to the main street.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been spending a lot of time in a gnome colony lately. Once they feel a hint of gnomehood in you, the rest is easy. They will treat you like you are family,‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúAnd here I thought you didn‚Äôt have a good eye for people‚Ä¶‚Äù Willow pointed out, getting away from Osprey before he would slap her shoulder. ‚Äú... Lord Clarke.‚Äù

The tall man massaged his temples.

‚ÄúThe fact you added ‚ÄòLord Clarke‚Äô at the end of the sentence doesn‚Äôt make it any better, or grammatically correct.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, Oz, Lord Clarke is one of us. A mead-drinking, soup-sipping, rib-nibbling gnome ally, unlike the other nobles that probably just eat‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, whatever nobles eat.‚Äù

Osprey looked even more tired than usual, and my caffeinated \[Foresight\] told me the man wanted the day to end already.

‚ÄúWhere next, Lord Clarke?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy carriage is waiting for me.‚Äù

The guards escorted me through the market and left me at the entrance of the branch of Farcrest‚Äôs Alchemist Guild. Osprey bowed, and Willow waved her hand as they continued their patrol. The effect of the caffeine would fade after some time, so it was better to start working while I felt energized.

The aides recognized me as soon as I entered the building. Being one of the two Prestige Classes in Farcrest had advantages, but it was still strange to me that everyone knew my face.

‚ÄúCan you arrange a private room for me? I need a peaceful place to study.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight away, Lord Clarke,‚Äù the aide replied.

I was guided to the second floor, past the guildmaster‚Äôs chambers, and into a study with a window into the lateral alley. The room was an old library in disuse that doubled as a storage for potion crates. Most of the crates had Farcrest‚Äôs black wolf printed on the side. A few had Elincia‚Äôs white rose. I couldn‚Äôt help but smile.

Across the street was an old building without windows. The place was perfect. Nobody had eyes on me.¬†

‚ÄúI must not be disturbed. Not even by the guildmaster. Understood?‚Äù

‚ÄúNaturally, Lord Clarke,‚Äù the aide bowed, putting the key on the table. ‚ÄúIf you need anything, I will be downstairs.‚Äù

I summoned a mana hand and locked the door as soon as the aide left. Then, I opened the package with my purchases and arranged them on the table: gloves, cloak, tunic, mantle, shirt, breeches, nails, and metal discs. I grinned.¬†

My main goal was to neutralize Byrne, not kill him. The best way to do it was to drain his mana until he was no longer a threat. I examined the table. The Murkhog Gloves had a mana threshold of 2100, which meant I could engrave a full-power Vampiric rune on them. If Byrne had as much mana as I did, I would need the extra power.

The MDBC bullets had a weakness, though. If the target had too much mana, shooting it would be like trying to empty the sea with a bucket. The mana drain's effectiveness depended on the target's total amount of mana. It was safe to assume Byrne‚Äôs pool wouldn‚Äôt be drained so easily.

On the bright side, I had experience draining mana from my opponents.

I pulled my sleeve up and examined the old scars from my fight when the Lich possessed a Chrysalimorph‚Äôs body. It was reckless, but I had been forced to runeweave on my own flesh to survive. The memory of the pain as the mana flowed through my body sent a shiver down my spine. Back then, I had a shallow grasp of runeweaving. I still did, but I knew a lot more runes.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get to work,‚Äù I said.

I needed to get close to Byrne to drain him, so I needed concealment.

**Simple linen mantle. \[Identify\] Enchantment threshold: 600.**

**Simple linen shirt. \[Identify\] Enchanted threshold: 300.**

**Simple linen breeches. \[Identify\] Enchantment threshold: 300.**

Kili had taught me that the secret to a perfect disguise was layers. \[Mirage\] and \[Silence Dome\] could make me invisible to the senses of low and mid-level combatants, but I was still channeling System mana underneath the camouflage. Byrne would detect the channeling through my skills.¬†

I summoned the \[Rune Debugger\] and wrote an Insulation-Reinforce enchantment. Even at maximum strength, the enchantment didn‚Äôt surpass the 300 points of Mana Threshold. The area turned green.

After two years of studying and testing, I realized many runes had unintended effects. The Bind rune could glue things together if underpowered, or assign an owner to the enchanted item if fully powered. Insulation also had two interesting secondary effects. Usually, Insulation served to prevent mana exchange, but it also offered a low-level protection against magical attacks. The third effect was the one that interested me the most. Insulation also made enchanted items invisible to detection, much like lead blocked X-rays.¬†

I wrote the runes and fed my mana to the circuit until it closed.

**Reinforced-Insulated linen shirt. \[Identify\] Enchantment threshold: 300/300. Status: Stable.**

**Reinforced-Insulated linen breeches. \[Identify\] Enchantment threshold: 300/300. Status: Stable.**

It would be a shame to under-enchant the linen mantle, so I added a low-power Dampen rune. Dampen was one of the runes I had found on Ilya‚Äôs Cooldown Bow. It absorbed kinetic energy, making the material more resistant to bludgeon attacks. It didn‚Äôt work as well at stopping piercing attacks. I hypothesized it was because of the relation between energy and impact area, but I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure. The Cooldown Bow was still an enigma. My gut told me the enchantment had some juicy tier III runes I was still too inexperienced to learn.

Finally, I added a Bind rune to complete the enchantment.

**Protection mantle. \[Identify\] Enchantment threshold: 600/600. Status: Stable.**

I nodded, pleased with the results.¬†

Kili‚Äôs skills had inspired me. There was an extra layer of camouflage I wanted to test, so I summoned the \[Rune Debugger\] again. The Insulation rune concealed my mana, but there was another way of tricking detection skills: mimicking the mana signature of the environment. Mana was everywhere. Mages loved places with a high concentration of environmental mana because they could use it to replenish their reserves by meditating. Alchemists hated environmental mana because it seeped into their ingredients and ruined their yields. I could use it to hide in plain sight.

Using the Absorption, Detect, Resonate, Echo, and Release runes, I started to design an enchantment that copied the exact signature of the environmental mana. The \[Rune Debugger\] turned red and yellow for an hour, until I came up with the right combination. I tested the enchantment in the iron discs, and it seemed to work. When I closed my eyes and activated my mana sense, the discs were almost invisible against the background mana.

¬†Finally, I added the base Insulation-Reinforce enchantments and the Bind rune so only I could activate them.

**Protection-Stealth Brammel Cloak. \[Identify\] Enchantment threshold: Enchantment threshold: 1200/1300. Status: Stable.**

**Protection-Stealth Brammel Tunic. \[Identify\] Enchantment threshold: Enchantment threshold: 1200/1200. Status: Stable.**

The fact that the Brammel Cloak was under-enchanted hurt my perfectionist soul, but I wasn‚Äôt comfortable adding a low-power Fire rune in case it messed with the stealth enchantment. I didn‚Äôt want igneous mana where it shouldn‚Äôt be.

All that was missing was to enchant the gloves, but there was a huge problem. In contrast with my stealth attire, offensive enchantments would shine like stars in the night sky. If I wanted to pass unnoticed, I needed to add the stealth enchantment on top of the Vampiric rune.

**Exquisite Murkhog Glove. \[Identify\] Enchantment threshold: 2100.**

I cursed. Two thousand and a hundred points of threshold wouldn‚Äôt be enough to fit a full power Vampiric rune, a Release rune, and the Stealth enchantment. I leaned back on my chair and closed my eyes. As if by caffeinated magic, the solution appeared behind my eyelids in an instant. The rune of Red‚Äôs flail. Couple.

‚Äú2100 points won‚Äôt be enough, but 4200 might be,‚Äù I muttered, stretching my back and grabbing a bunch of nails and iron discs. I needed to experiment.

I thought she was kidding but she was very serious and this made me very sad.

so the all gender restroom is occupied like always cause anyone can use it, and people really love the single restroom and stay in there for a very long time. so after that... we sat down and she was lecturing me on how ""good"" I have it as a trans woman in today's society. she said I should be grateful to have access to an all gender restroom and that other companies and countries dont even have restrooms for transgender people to use. oh and that im not allowed to use the woman's restroom.

I was just speechless and sad, I grabbed some tissues before coming back to my desk since I already felt the tears but of course she's sitting next to me. so I showed her our company policy which states that I can use any restroom I feel comfortable to use. I started crying cause I was so sad by how she treated me and my friends there were arguing with her that its okay for me to use the woman's restroom.

she later packed her stuff and moved but messaged me telling me it was an ""innocent"" mistake and told me to be patient with her. I told her that I didnt like how she treated me like an alien and that I need to distance myself from her in the meantime since this isnt the first time she hurt me.

fast forward to today and apparently she didnt like my reply? she reported it to my boss and now he has to report the incident to HR ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è i dont want to draw any attention to me... why did she report the incident when she was the problem??",14,1747793453.0,asktransgender,5,0.94,False
1krmn9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIContentAutomators/comments/1krmn9n/stepbystep_using_trends_to_create_viral_content/,Step-by-Step: Using Trends to Create Viral Content,"Hey, fellow AiContentAutomators! üåü

So, let‚Äôs be real for a second: in this ocean of online content, **how do we ride the waves of trends** to create something that actually *sticks*? ü§î If you‚Äôre feeling like you‚Äôre just treading water while others are catching big breaks, fear not! I‚Äôve been there, and I‚Äôve discovered a killer way to **create viral content** without losing your mind‚Äîor your coffee.

Here‚Äôs my step-by-step guide on how to use trends like a pro! üöÄ

### 1. **Keep Your Radar Up**
   - Ever heard the phrase ‚ÄúKnowledge is power‚Äù? Well, in the world of content creation, it‚Äôs your *best buddy*. 
   - Follow influencers, subscribe to trend newsletters, and hop on platforms like TikTok, Twitter, and Instagram to see what‚Äôs popping.
   - Set Google Alerts for keywords relevant to your niche. Who doesn‚Äôt love a little notification to get the creativity flowing? üì©

### 2. **Get Inspired, Not Imitated**
   - Trend-jacking doesn‚Äôt mean copying! Instead, think of it like remixing a favorite song. üé∂
   - Take a trend and *twist it* to fit your brand or message. For instance, if there‚Äôs a hilarious meme making the rounds, how can you adapt it to reflect your experience in the educational space?
   - Remember, authenticity is key. Your audience can sniff out a fake!

### 3. **Craft Your Content**
   - It‚Äôs showtime! Your ideas are aligning with current trends, and now it‚Äôs time to sprinkle some magic.
   - Use **bold visuals or quirky formats**‚Äîthink infographics, meme-based posts, or TikTok duets. Just make sure it *reflects your style* and engages your audience.
   - Here‚Äôs a simple checklist:
     - Is it visually appealing?
     - Is it relatable and would it make you chuckle?
     - Does it provide value, or provoke thought?

### 4. **Timing is Everything**
   - Hit the publishing button at the right moment. üí•
   - Pay attention to peak usage times for your target audience. Trust me, posting at 2 AM when everyone‚Äôs asleep isn‚Äôt going to do any favors!
   - Consider launching your content alongside key events‚Äîholidays, popular TV show finales, or even trending hashtags. 

### 5. **Engage and Iterate**
   - So, you‚Äôve posted your masterpiece. Now, *get the conversation rolling*! 
   - Respond to comments, ask questions, and encourage sharing. More engagement = more visibility!
   - After a few days, review what worked and what didn‚Äôt. Did that cat video you posted go viral while your thoughtful educational posts fell flat? Adjust accordingly!

### Bonus Tip: Don't Stress Perfection! 
- Seriously, who even has time for that? Sometimes the *imperfect*, spontaneous posts are the ones that get people talking. 

With these steps, you‚Äôre well on your way to **working smarter, not harder**, and creating viral content that resonates with your community. *Who knew riding trends could feel this good?* üòé

So, while you get your creative gears turning, I can‚Äôt help but wonder: what recent trends have you guys experimented with? Any successes or epic fails you‚Äôd like to share? Let‚Äôs chat!",1,1747793377.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a linguistics student from China, and I‚Äôll be staying in Joburg this August for my thesis. I‚Äôm researching how English is influenced by other South African languages like Zulu, Xhosa, Afrikaans, etc.

Ready to start my own business but have no experience except for sales.,"I am a 40-year-old female and I‚Äôve worked my entire life in medical sales making a lot of money in the meantime. I went to graduate school in Italy, where I studied food, wine, and specialty goods, including coffee, chocolate, etc. My dream has always been to open my own Italian coffee shop and dry goods Italian import store. I bought a building this past fall and I‚Äôm currently renting it out with the lease ending in October 2026. I‚Äôm currently making $200k+ with commission at my current pharma sales job. But the problem is, I‚Äôm losing more and more of my soul to corporate America everyday when I go to work. My passion lies in bringing a small piece of Italy to my town and interacting daily with people. I‚Äôll need about $70,000 of startup costs which I have saved or I‚Äôm speaking with an investor currently. Building is on our main street in our small downtown with 12 parking spaces, but it is a very small building (850sq ft) but has a nice patio and four seasons room. The problem is that I have no experience in running a business, but I have the passion and the excitement about starting. Am I absolutely insane to say that once the lease is up, I will open my doors in May 2027? I have two children one being 3 the other 13 and my husband is a firefighter, so time is limited. But when I discuss this endeavor with people, they always tell me there‚Äôs no good time and to just go and follow my passion. The only time I actually get excited about waking up in the morning is when I think about going to my shop. Is this just a pie in the sky idea and am I being way too optimistic about the fact that this might be actually fun?

Corporate fascism ruled the earth, and we knew we had to be careful when setting out - even bringing my skincare along the way would indicate to the guards at the county line checkpoints that we weren't spending the night at home - so my boyfriend and I set out light in my mother's little black Skoda, only a thick knitted woolen sweater each extra. 

We didn't know what to expect along the way, but we knew that taking the back roads was dangerous - if they were patrolled, we had to give a reason for our route.

We first set out in the dawn of the damp, morning to meet Solveig, whom we would tell any guards was an old classmate of my mother - someone who wanted to meet us, as she wanted to reconnect with my mother. 

We managed to avoid any incidents, and we met Solveig outside, where she was walking her black labrador, the pup giddy with excitement in the acid rain. We talked briefly, and her pale blue eyes were soft with sadness as she gesticulated to the cluster of dying pines nearby. Her red windbreaker jacket was the only colour in the heathland.

""It's not like it isn't obvious these days"", she said. ""Everything is dying.""

We only nodded - we had to push further ahead to meet the stranger we had gotten in contact with online. We knew we could be caught and shot, or worse - separated and thrown in jail - I couldn't imagine facing the torture alone, without my boyfriend, the love of my life. I couldn't imagine him having to do the same. But we had to go on. Some things you had to fight for.

We finally arrived at a bay. To our right, a sandy shore, the water a sickly sludge of muted greys - we knew it was dead, like everything around us was dying. A seal cried out from the waterline, her pups motionless besides her.

To our right we could see the high, sharp peaks of mountains, their profiles a dark blue,  interspersed with the singular white flecks of glacier that still remained. There was too little of that for this time of the year. 

Suddenly, in the distance, inching towards us - a pickup truck, its lights dimmed. It came to a halt next to us, and the back passenger door opened. The yellow warm light radiating from inside made us feel we were safe, for now. 

""Welcome"", said Mark, ""to the resistance"". 

He handed me a soda can, and to my surprise I saw that the brand was the Indian Haldiram's. South Indian filter coffee, cold brewed. 

""It's tempered with ghee, fennel seeds and urad dal - I figured it would make you feel comfortable to get something familiar.""

My fianc√© and I looked at each other in disbelief. We jumped into the dry car. 

""We have a long way ahead"", said Mark, his blond head bobbing on his large frame. ""You weren't followed, right?""

We shook our heads, and I opened the coffee. It tasted of home, yet faraway. The car slowly started rolling, it's wheels crushing the wet gravel ahead. ",1,1747793074.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

Night had crept in, soft and heavy, curling around the corners of the room like a tired ghost. I sat still on the edge of the bed, my fingers tangled in the folds of a blanket I hadn‚Äôt the strength to straighten. And now, when I‚Äôm all spent‚Äîwhen there‚Äôs nothing left in me but breath and bruised hope‚ÄîI wonder.

Was I that much? Was I too much of a person, too full of feeling, too sharp at the edges, too warm in the wrong moments, too loud with my silence? I gave all that I had, not in grand gestures, but in the quiet acts‚Äîremembering birthdays, listening beyond words, folding my love into lunch boxes and late-night messages. Still, somehow, I always ended up alone.

Was I that hard to love?

The question hangs in the air like smoke, staining everything it touches. I think of the faces that have come and gone‚Äîsmiles that didn‚Äôt stay, promises made like paper boats, meant to sink eventually. Maybe I made it too hard. Or maybe I just asked for too little, hoping someone would offer more anyway.

Is love that hard to find?

I see people find it like it‚Äôs a rhythm their hearts always knew. They stumble into it at coffee shops and bus stops, in awkward conversations and shared umbrellas. Meanwhile, I search for it in the cracks between conversations, in the silences of long walks home, in the echo of every door that closes a little too loudly behind someone.

And then, the aching thought: Am I not even deserving of that bit of kindness I show?

It breaks something inside me. I‚Äôve poured compassion like water into cups that were never meant to hold it, only to find myself thirsty when the nights grow long. I‚Äôve shown up in ways that felt invisible. I‚Äôve tried to believe that love would circle back around, that someone would see me‚Äîand stay.

But tonight, all I have are questions. I wonder, and wonder, until the stars outside look more like judgment than comfort, until the soft cotton of my pillow is wet with tears I swore I wouldn‚Äôt cry again.

Eventually, I close my eyes, the weight of my wondering heavier than any dream could lift. And so, I cry‚Äîquietly, steadily‚Äîuntil sleep takes me, and the questions drift into the dark with me.

I love the drink options (especially the drip coffee option), froth options and the fact that the tamper is built into the machine. The only drawback is that my husband drinks decaf (but will enjoy a regular coffee as well) whereas I drink regular espressos/coffees. The machines with a dual/interchangeable hopper or bypass are either way out of budget (over $1,000) or do not have the option to do a drip coffee.

* Don't party and don't care for bars or nightlife
* I prefer residential-ish streets / neighborhoods with a few coffee shops / restaurants / shops within walking distance

* Ideally would not live in one of those cookie-cutter apt buildings but if I do want a *nice* place (mom and pop landlords or condos would be ideal)
* No pets and ideally would live in the sunnier parts of the city / the bay

Prologue

In the fictional city of Natsuka‚Äîhalf steel, half silence‚ÄîI live as the man everyone admires: a son with gentle words, a brother with ready shoulders, a friend who drinks but never drowns, and a lover who says just enough. But the truth is simpler: I am a ghost of myself, wearing a mask that grew skin.

They call me reliable. Honest. Thoughtful. But they don‚Äôt know I invent fragments of my past to fill empty silences. That I fake nostalgia. I once cried in front of the girl I loved, just to feel like a tragedy. The love was never real. The tears were theatre. But the applause? That was real.

And then came Mira.

Chapter 1: Fractures in Stillness

It began with a note‚Äîneat cursive, slipped under my apartment door:

""When did the lie become more real than the truth?""

The handwriting wasn‚Äôt familiar. But the chill that crept up my spine was.

I stood in the kitchen of my meticulously clean apartment, the smell of instant coffee faint in the air. The world outside my window‚Äîneon-lit streets, rushed cyclists, and vending machines that hummed through the night‚Äîmoved without urgency. Unlike me.

My hands were steady. That‚Äôs the sickness. There‚Äôs never a crack.

Chapter 2: Mira‚Äôs Quiet Knowing

Mira entered my life with the softness of a breeze that doesn‚Äôt ask for attention. She was my best friend before she became something else. I don‚Äôt know when I started telling her stories that never happened. Or when she began to believe that she knew me.

She thought I was gentle. Supportive. Deep.

She knows about the girl I said I once loved. She knows I cried about it. She doesn‚Äôt know the tears were a performance. She thinks she knows me completely.

Sometimes, I think I love her. Sometimes I don‚Äôt. But the idea of her leaving? That makes my chest ache. Yet even that grief feels...performed.

Chapter 3: The Mirror Room

The second message came as a photo. I, standing outside my workplace late at night. Eyes vacant. The body was posed like a mannequin waiting to be moved.

This one came with a phrase:

""You don't even know what you are pretending to be anymore.""

I looked in the mirror that night and saw nothing wrong. I saw the same well-trimmed hair, soft features, and even breath. But behind my eyes, there was static.

Chapter 4: Shadows and Siblings

My sister visited. She‚Äôs the only one who knows how I once broke a classmate‚Äôs nose in seventh grade and lied so well I got him suspended.

She said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too perfect now. It‚Äôs weird.‚Äù

I laughed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a compliment, right?‚Äù

She shook her head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs eerie.‚Äù

I used to think she looked up to me. Maybe she still does. Maybe that‚Äôs another performance.

Chapter 5: The Red Tape

My office desk drawer contained a folder I didn‚Äôt put there. Inside: clippings about people who vanished from Natsuka. Each article highlighted someone known for being ‚Äògood,‚Äô ‚Äòkind,‚Äô or ‚Äòunproblematic.‚Äô

One name circled in red: Daigo. A man who worked in our firm three years ago. Reliable. Friendly. Smiled a lot.

I didn‚Äôt remember him. But his eyes in the photo‚Ä¶ they looked like mine.

Chapter 6: Mira‚Äôs Journal

She left her journal in my apartment once. Accidentally‚Äîor maybe not.

She wrote:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if he truly loves me. Sometimes, he says everything right. Other times, he looks at me like I‚Äôm furniture. Still, I love him. I think he‚Äôs scared of feeling.‚Äù

Reading that didn‚Äôt make me sad. It made me wonder: had she caught a glimpse of the real me? Or was she just projecting hope onto a shell?

Chapter 7: The Truth Therapy

I was invited to a private therapy group through an anonymous letter. The place didn‚Äôt look like a clinic‚Äîjust a grey room in an industrial zone. Inside were seven others. All with faces too composed. Too familiar.

The rules were simple:

‚ÄúTell your greatest lie. Speak your deepest truth. Leave nothing behind.‚Äù

When it was my turn, I said:

‚ÄúMy greatest lie is that I ever felt real sadness. I‚Äôve mimicked emotions so long that I‚Äôve forgotten how they actually feel. My deepest truth? I don‚Äôt know if I love Mira. But I know I fear what would remain of me if she left.‚Äù

No one clapped. No one cried. They just stared.

Chapter 8: Missing Faces

People from the group began disappearing. Their apartments were left untouched. Their desks were cleaned overnight.

I asked around. No records. No files. It was like they were drafted into nonexistence.

Then I stopped receiving messages. No more photos. No more notes. Just silence.

But every time I walk by a reflective surface, I catch a flicker‚Äîa movement that doesn't match my own.

Chapter 9: Mira‚Äôs Goodbye

She stood by the door. Bag in hand.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt love me,‚Äù she said calmly. ‚ÄúBut I think you want to.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond. I didn‚Äôt stop her. Not out of cruelty. But because I didn‚Äôt know what was true.

As the door clicked shut, I waited for the ache. It didn‚Äôt come.

But my reflection, in the darkened window, smiled.

Epilogue

I still live in Natsuka. Still cook, clean, talk, and negotiate. Still admired.

But the mirror in my hallway cracked last night.

No wind. No tremor.

Just a single, clean fracture‚Äîright across my smile.

And when I whispered to my reflection, it whispered something back.

Something I never said.

‚ÄúYou're almost ready to remember.‚Äù

The game isn‚Äôt over.

It never started.

1krm50l,https://www.reddit.com/r/BackwoodsCreepy/comments/1krm50l/the_bone_collector/,The Bone Collector,"Recently I went on my first camping trip of the year and one of my friends was asking me about any creepy camping or hiking experiences I have had in the past. I haven't shared this story with too many people but, since recounting it to my friend, I haven't been able to stop reflecting on it. I found this subreddit and figured I'd share with you all.

A group of friends and I would go camping at one of their privately owned spots in Hocking Hills, Ohio, several times every summer from 2018-2022. It's located not far from a few rental cabins that are up the hill but, for the most part, it's a pretty quiet and secluded spot. There are no other campsites or campgrounds in the area whatsoever, so it was always nice to feel like we were in our own little slice of the park. It was typical after a night or two of camping for us to wake up early in the morning, make coffee, and then go for a hike in the area. Not far from the campsite, maybe half a mile or so up the road, is one of the park's only nature preserves. We all prefer to go camping and hiking in areas that the general public don't go, so this preserve in particular was a perfect fit for us. Also important to note is that you need permits to explore the nature preserves in the park and there are absolutely no camping permits given for these areas.

One morning, sometime in summer 2021, we went for a hike there after a night of camping. That morning, there were five of us - me, my boyfriend, his best friend and his girlfriend, and another friend from college. As soon as we entered the preserve and started walking down the trail, I had an eerie and uneasy feeling being there, almost like when you feel someone is watching you or something. I had never had that feeling anywhere I had hiked before, especially being in a decent sized group, so I just tried to shake the feeling off. We were the only people in the preserve and we didn't come across anyone else during our entire 2-hour hike. We all split up when we got off trail but didn't travel too far apart, so we were always in earshot of one another. We were all walking around in a pretty open part of the preserve and after 10-15 minutes exploring in our separate little units, we regrouped near a bunch of tall rock formations.

As soon as we started heading through them toward a new area that we hadn't explored yet, we all stopped dead in our tracks. In a slightly open area directly in front of us, surrounded by the rock formations, was a makeshift campsite with a little campfire that looked like it had just recently been put out. Scattered in a circle around the campsite and carefully placed on logs and rocks around it were dozens of animal bones, skulls, teeth, and full/partial pieces of jawbones, some with teeth still attached. We looked around the immediate area and it didn't look like a tent or anything had been pitched; it just looked like someone had made the campfire and stayed for the night or weekend or something. What I found especially creepy was that the bones and teeth had all been neatly and purposefully arranged in a circle and in little single-file lines around the campfire. The person had clearly scoured the preserve for bones to bring back to this campsite, as there were dozens and dozens that had been collected. There were no personal belongings, tools, or anything at all left behind, it was just a circle of bones, some logs and stones, and a burned out fireplace in the middle. Someone in our group made a comment that it looked ""ritualistic"", and while I don't personally believe that it was, a lot of effort had been put into it. Needless to say, the five of us left all of it alone, quickly high tailed it out of there, made our way back to camp and didn't look back. As soon as we were out of the preserve, that uneasy feeling I had of being closely watched was gone. It was such a relief getting out of there.

I'm not sure if whoever was staying there had maybe heard us coming and then went and hid in the trees somewhere or if they had already left and were long gone before we arrived in the area. Again, there were no personal belongings or anything left behind. Regardless, it was scary to think that this person had been camping there, surrounded by bones they had collected, just half a mile or so up the road from us. I only ever ended up camping at my friend's private campsite a few more times over the next year before I ended up moving out of Ohio in 2022, but that experience was always in the back of my mind when we were there. I never felt unsafe or anything because there was always a decently large group of us camping close together. I also never felt uneasy or had any strange feelings or experiences while at camp, but I knew I would never go back to that particular trail/preserve after that experience. Part of me wishes I would have at least taken pictures but, at the time, I was feeling really freaked out and just wanted to get out of there in case anyone actually was hiding and watching us. I often wonder how long they had been in the preserve and if they were camping there the same nights that we were. The mystery of it all keeps me thinking but, ultimately, I'm just glad we didn‚Äôt end up crossing this person's path.

Has anyone else had any creepy discoveries like this near their campsite? I'd be intrigued to hear any of your stories!",10,1747791819.0,BackwoodsCreepy,2,0.86,False

However, I‚Äôve been second-guessing a bit. I enjoy milk drinks, but I also really like straight shots. I‚Äôve heard great things about the Bambino (it seems like everyone recommends it lol), but I‚Äôm wondering how much I‚Äôm leaving on the table in terms of espresso quality.

Would I noticeably benefit from a more expensive machine? How big are the diminishing returns once you move beyond the Bambino?

1krm3or,https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/1krm3or/smell_as_another_class_distinction/,Smell as another class distinction,"A prime location to discern class differences are within public spaces, notably public transportation. Urban hubs are flooded daily with people across differing class backgrounds within the transit matrix, coming into close contact while peacefully ignoring each other and coexisting. Sometimes, however, this division morphs into small unity whenever a homeless person enters the scene. When this subject deemed less than nothing occupies these close-quarter areas, they are commonly avoided and ignored - most people look away when they start asking for money or food. This is tolerable to an extent insofar as they don‚Äôt start harassing them. The boundary is crossed though, when the homeless person smells badly. At this threshold, they become intolerable to most people. In a train or bus or station, the common counter to this unwanted intrusion is to walk somewhere else: I go from this train cart to the next, from the back to the front of the bus, from this side of the station to another. Oftentimes, strangers move away in tandem, or quickly one by one after the other. Either way, there is a silent pact here: we don‚Äôt know each other, we won't talk after this, but in this juncture there is shared comfort that we are not THAT. The logic here is of disavowal: I know this person smells and it disgusts me, but I nonetheless act as though this isn‚Äôt true in order to preserve whatever bits of dignity they have left.¬†

While this is a common sense explanation of events, what I want to disclose here is how even the lower class that is much closer in socioeconomic and political qualities to the homeless, will - in these episodes - cling on to their working class identity and even convey this sort of pseudo-accord with upper class people. The tacit message being: ‚Äúhey, despite our fundamental discord, at least we can appreciate that we are not like him.‚Äù The Homeless in this way, are equivalent to the Untouchables in India: they are beneath the class structure, not even counted in it - they are the paradigmatic ‚ÄòPart of No-Part‚Äô of the class strata.

New York City is a great area to observe this first-hand: go on any train line at nearly any point in the day and one of the carts will perform this scene. The standard course is to move away or past the obscene object (homeless), either quickly with little regard for manners, or slowly to preserve the pretense of manners which helps to alleviate or circumvent the associated guilt from doing so. If they don‚Äôt smell too bad, then okay great we can calmly sit across or diagonal to them, just enough out of touching distance of uncomfortableness. If they start venturing to interact with others, remember the two conventional antidotes: head down and stare at your phone or keep your eyes closed - remain calm and the monstrosity won‚Äôt bother me (most times). What unfolds is an expected scenery of one-half of a cart empty and the other half brimmed, or both ends evenly distributed and the middle part empty. It is kind of uncanny when the train stops at a station and bypassers get on, as they quickly assess the situation and generally move to the inhabited areas, taking refuge with the rest of the lot: clean bodies, headphones, business to trendy attire, shoes without holes in them, shopping bags not donation bags, collared dogs, iphones, plastic iced coffee cups, baby carriages, nylon bookbags, polyester suitcases, couples talking, friends laughing- all the stampings that are associated with the average consumer person.

The basic demarcation here is between people who contain economic value and the homeless precariat that have zero exchange-value who are consequently treated by market forces as waste / unproductive scum. Those who truly feel bad and resort to money donations to signify their humanitarian concern, should be aware that this action exhibits a system of false appearances: the ideological component of this practice is how their (apparent) honest compassion for the disenfranchised homeless, nevertheless testifies to a basis of social exchange that is economic in origin. Which is to say, the camaraderie is insincere because it is mediated through an economic purpose of allocating a portion of money that could temporarily ease their hunger or despair; in contrast to a political solidarity that aims to structurally eradicate the existence of poverty and render the terminology accompanying the homeless obsolete. The unfortunate downside of this practice is that it works as an impotent individualist remedy to an inherent feature of the existing system; a disavowal of the *real* of capitalist social reality by virtue of tackling its class disparities symptomatically.¬†

Incidentally, a proportion of homeless that belong to liberal societies undertake their own exclusionary actions of disaffiliating from / ostracizing homeless immigrants: those refugees - assorted as ‚Äònomadic proletarians‚Äô in Marxist study - that come from the poorest countries are even inferior to the 1st world homeless. In an obscene turn of events, the western homeless person disdains the foreign homeless person who they allege isn't similar to them. This is because the former is subjected to a destitution that doesn‚Äôt compare to the living hell that global south impoverishment inheres. This can be attributed to the minimal layer of privileges (when evaluating the two) or social services that homeless people in the West have which their alien equivalents do not, and this is enough for them to embark on their own class hostilities against them. This is denotative of a topsy-turvy universe whose morbid symptoms are regularly being brought out through these obscene exhibitions.

Bearing this in mind, smell is one of the cardinal physical showcasing‚Äôs of class deviation and remainder: the excess homeless leftovers that have no proper placement within the social totality. In this setting, they could be construed as a contemporary category of unemployment: an ‚Äúunproductive‚Äù base who remind the working class - through their stench - how they can end up in the same dire crossroads.¬†

Corporate fascism ruled the earth, and we knew we had to be careful when setting out - even bringing my skincare along the way would indicate to the guards at the county line checkpoints that we weren't spending the night at home - so my boyfriend and I set out light in my mother's little black Skoda, only a thick knitted woolen sweater each extra. 

We didn't know what to expect along the way, but we knew that taking the back roads was dangerous - if they were patrolled, we had to give a reason for our route.

We first set out in the dawn of the damp, morning to meet Solveig, whom we would tell any guards was an old classmate of my mother - someone who wanted to meet us, as she wanted to reconnect with my mother. 

We managed to avoid any incidents, and we met Solveig outside, where she was walking her black labrador, the pup giddy with excitement in the acid rain. We talked briefly, and her pale blue eyes were soft with sadness as she gesticulated to the cluster of dying pines nearby. Her red windbreaker jacket was the only colour in the heathland.

""It's not like it isn't obvious these days"", she said. ""Everything is dying.""

We only nodded - we had to push further ahead to meet the stranger we had gotten in contact with online. We knew we could be caught and shot, or worse - separated and thrown in jail - I couldn't imagine facing the torture alone, without my boyfriend, the love of my life. I couldn't imagine him having to do the same. But we had to go on. Some things you had to fight for.

We finally arrived at a bay. To our right, a sandy shore, the water a sickly sludge of muted greys - we knew it was dead, like everything around us was dying. A seal cried out from the waterline, her pups motionless besides her.

To our right we could see the high, sharp peaks of mountains, their profiles a dark blue,  interspersed with the singular white flecks of glacier that still remained. There was too little of that for this time of the year. 

Suddenly, in the distance, inching towards us - a pickup truck, its lights dimmed. It came to a halt next to us, and the back passenger door opened. The yellow warm light radiating from inside made us feel we were safe, for now. 

""Welcome"", said Mark, ""to the resistance"". 

He handed me a soda can, and to my surprise I saw that the brand was the Indian Haldiram's. South Indian filter coffee, cold brewed. 

""It's tempered with ghee, fennel seeds and urad dal - I figured it would make you feel comfortable to get something familiar.""

My fianc√© and I looked at each other in disbelief. We jumped into the dry car. 

""We have a long way ahead"", said Mark, his blond head bobbing on his large frame. ""You weren't followed, right?""

We shook our heads, and I opened the coffee. It tasted of home, yet faraway. The car slowly started rolling, it's wheels crushing the wet gravel ahead. ",9,1747791499.0,somnigastronomy,4,0.92,False

Hey everyone! I‚Äôll be spending about 3 weeks in Cincinnati this June for work during the FIFA Club World Cup. I‚Äôll be based mostly around TQL Stadium and staying with family who live about 20 minutes outside the city. I‚Äôm originally from Columbus, so this will be my first real stretch of time getting to know Cincy‚Äîand I want to make the most of it.

Would really appreciate any recommendations or tips from locals (or people who know the city well). I‚Äôll have some free time outside of work and I‚Äôm hoping to explore, try new food, and just enjoy the city while I‚Äôm here.

Some things I‚Äôd love advice on:
	‚Ä¢	Food and coffee: What are your favorite local restaurants, diners, food trucks, or cafes? I love casual spots, hole-in-the-wall joints, and anything unique to Cincy. Bonus points for late-night eats.
	‚Ä¢	Things to do or see: What are the must-visit places for someone new? Any cool neighborhoods, museums, parks, scenic spots, or events I should check out? I‚Äôm open to touristy stuff and local hidden gems.
	‚Ä¢	Places to avoid / safety tips: Are there any areas that are best to steer clear of, especially at night? I‚Äôll likely be heading back and forth to the stadium and sometimes getting home late, so just want to stay alert and smart.
	‚Ä¢	Getting around: I‚Äôll probably be driving, but I‚Äôd love to know how the parking situation is downtown, around TQL, and in general. Is public transit decent or worth figuring out for certain areas?

Im in my early 20s so would also like to know about the nightlife!

I‚Äôm really excited to be a part of such a big event and get a feel for the city outside of the work stuff. If there‚Äôs anything I have to try or do before I leave, I‚Äôd love to hear it. Thanks in advance!",5,1747791015.0,cincinnati,11,0.86,False

I drank copious amounts of coffee and energy drinks and made it to 2 or 3am before needing sleep, plus I felt like a zombie the next day and I was sooo anxious from all the people, loud music, and lights.  

Flash forward to the same rave this year without caffeine and the results were surprising. 

I could stay awake as long as I wanted. I got quality sleep. My energy levels were stable throughout the 4 days. The people around me slamming energy drinks? Not even close to my level. My anxiety? A friggin blip on the radar.

I‚Äôve recently moved to a Presbyterian church for these reasons (Evangelical Presbyterian Church), and while it‚Äôs not a cathedral, they have an appreciation for liturgy and more honest worship, and have felt much more honest intentions in the approach to Sunday services there, they have been an amazing and welcoming church
