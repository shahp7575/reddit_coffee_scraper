1. Recently was on the road for work when I pulled over at a McDonald’s for some breakfast. I decided to go in since my breakfast wasn’t going to be eating while driving friendly.

I have a seat at a table that has a bench on one side and chairs on the other (I opted for the bench), popped in my AirPods, ordered table service on the app and started to search for a video to watch while eating breakfast. (Note on the AirPods: they were in but nothing was playing and noise cancelling was off). While scrolling and waiting for my breakfast a longer table (seats 6-8) started to fill up with the usual suspect boomer loafers…. No biggie they have their coffee and it is like 5 old ladies and one guy… I heard one of the ladies complain about the type of chair she had when all of the sudden the boomer guy stood up, promptly walked to my table and took the chair across from me to give to that lady…. nor did he bring a chair back to the table…

I promptly stood up and now blocked this guys only path back to his table. He came around the table and got face to face with me, a little puffed up like he was the man, assuming I would just move out of his way when I instead took a step towards him, at which point he realized he had an issue. To which the following conversation took place loud enough for his table full of old ladies to hear:

Me: excuse you sir

Boomer: uhhhh

Me: did you just take a chair from my table without asking me….

Boomer: i uh uh uh uh

Me:  you never take a chair from my table or anyone’s table ever again without politely asking permission….. 

Boomer: oh oh oh oh ok….  (Hangs head but clearly thinks this is over and I will move, because he starts to try to step around)

Me: No sir, you owe me an apologies and make sure it is loud enough for these ladies to hear… 

Boomer: (reluctantly) I I I I apologize.

I take my seat and my good shows up 2 minutes later…. I decided to not play any music and instead listen to the clucking at the table next to me…. They had no idea what to do.


Story 2…. Also a breakfast stop at McDonald’s 

I hate going to an unknown McDonald’s in the morning…. It is like going to a new church…. Inevitably you take someone’s seat and they are butthurt. 

I had taken a seat that I thought looked safe… nobody at the tables surrounding it m… because typically these boomer loafers occupy like 5 tables together…. I was eating when I see  a few boomers stroll in and start to occupy the table next to me…. Ok I will finish my food, drink, and reading this news article…. Now they are standing up staring, whispering, and shaking their heads… here we go…

Two of the literally just set at my table…. 

Me: Excuse you!!!! What are you doing….

Boomers: we sit here every morning

Me: so you have the right to just plop down where I am eating 

Boomers: well you don’t mind do you

Me: (loud enough for everyone to hear) YES, that is rude, inconsiderate, and you didn’t even ask. Now take your coffee and find another spot… and leave the chairs….

They relocated…. I decided to stay an extra 15 minutes or so for good measure and to further annoy them…..


The sad thing is, any either of these instances, if they just would have said, “excuse me sir may I …..”   then absolutely I would have obliged… courtesy goes a long way….

Maybe I need to stop going to McDonald’s for breakfast when I’m the road.

1grv1gb,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1grv1gb/alien_oc_observe_humans/,Alien OC Observe Humans ,"
My OC Ebralik is a Pthumerian Splicer (magic scientist/engineer) that is sent to observe humans by his superiors. As he observes humans he finds out many things that separates his people from humans but at the same time shows they aren't so different.

	1)  Ebralik is vexed by humans idea of purpose or rather their desire to be free of it. When humans talk about robots doing everything for them, it feels like they want to grow weak and undisciplined in the wake of their prosperity. He feels as though humans don't have the same passion for their work as his people do as Ebralik could spend centuries working to make new technology and find fulfillment in the journey and the destination, his 95 year old grandfather is still a physically active miner and feels his purpose as he mines in tunnels. He asks himself ""Do humans want to be free of the road to fulfillment, to indulge in hedonism until they inevitably feel empty?""

	2)  Information seems to be open and free to humans which baffles Ebralik as knowledge is like a ravine that must be built correctly so the plants grow, grow in a way optimal to the surrounding area. Free reign of knowledge, information, and ideas seems to create division in human societies. While the Pthumerians aren't kept dumb somethings that could send a wrong message are blocked from the populace.

	3) Human technology intrigues Ebralik, and shows him that despite the chaos he sees in humans some fascinating things and brilliant minds come from their numbers. From chemical kinetic weapons, particle accelerators, meta materials ect. While his kind had technology way above humans, their technology has been dwindled after a cataclysm and have been brought down. Humans take on technology has fascinated Ebralik and he takes inspiration from it as he makes plasma weapons from scrap metal.

	4)  Alcohol is odd to Ebralik as he wonders why humans would willingly ingest poison. The concept of fun isn't alien to Ebralik simply this method is. The only human beverages Ebralik enjoys are coffee and energy drinks as they increase his capacity for his passion.

	5) Humans Innovations, While Ebralik is fascinated with humans capacity for innovation the idea that it can collapse their economy seems like an issue of their actions and mindset. Pthumerians use their innovations to supplement and aid Pthumerian workers not replace them. Humans collectively choose to make things that replace the human worker, leaving most people without jobs, and wonders why their economy suffers. Innovations & Robots don't have to be a problem it seems that humans have an urge the follow the path of making their own species obsolete instead of making tools to aid the worker.

	6) Humans capacity for polluting their world baffles and irritates him. As he hatched in a subterranean colony on Mars and his people work tirelessly to build up what they have now, it breaks his heart to see a world that innately has the ability to support life be corroded by the most sapient species on it. He grew a deep fascination & admiration with the human planet, from the air, to the beasts. It breaks his 3 hearts to see smog fill the air, landfills flood landscapes, oceans full of oil and trash. It's a slow death and corruption akin to watching Pneuma Loss end a Pthumerian as their bodies and minds wither. However he will use scrapyards to his advantage in his craft as the concept of ""Trash"" is rarely used with his people, everything has a purpose.

	7)  The humans seem to have accepted individualism rather than his kind who has had to rely on a Collectivism culture since their origin. It feels like a catalyst for greed & corruption rather than prioritizing everyone, the individual values themselves.

	8) Ebralik is confused by the concept of gender roles as his people are similar in size and strength so gender based roles were never a thing. He's seen humans of both sexes do the same things and he can't wrap his head around genitals making you more valuable or better at leadership.

1grv107,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1grv107/dosing_by_weight_or_volume/,Dosing by weight or volume?,"Coming from pourover mostly, I'm used to dosing coffee and water by weight.

I have an old 2 cup brikka model (with the weight on top of the spout). For water it was pretty easy to measure 100g up to the level marker. For coffee, however, I can either fill the basket to the top without tamping, which results in slightly different weight for different coffees, or I can do a constant weight dose and sometimes it won't fill the basket entirely.

How do you all go about it? For now I'm dosing by volume, but I end up wasting a lot of coffee since I grind too much to make sure I fill the basket all the way. However, if I were to do the opposite, how can I level the coffee bed? What if there's a lot of empty space, how will it affect the extraction?

It’s been an incredible ride, and I’m thrilled to share that [Face Swap AI](https://www.videofaceswap.ai/share?source=reddit&ad_id=noad) is now officially available on iOS and Android! 🎉

Here’s a little peek behind the scenes: It all started with the web version of Face Swap AI. As a team of TV and movie enthusiasts, we couldn’t resist testing it out ourselves. Imagine watching The Office but with your coworkers' faces swapped into every scene. Or starring in your favorite Marvel movie as the lead superhero. Hilarious? Absolutely. Weird? Even more so. 😂

But here’s the thing, we realized something was off. Nobody wants to be tethered to their desktops for something this fun. We’re all glued to our phones anyway, right? And as feedback started rolling in, our early users echoed the same sentiment: ""This is amazing! But can I use it on my phone?""

So, we thought: Why stop at the web? If swapping faces could bring so much joy at a desk, imagine what it could do on the go! That’s when we decided to bring Face Swap AI to mobile. Fast forward through sleepless nights, a bunch of testing and plenty of coffee, and here we are Face Swap AI in the palm of your hand.

Now, whether you’re turning your friend into a sitcom star, imagining yourself as an action hero, or just having a good laugh, you can do it all straight from your phone. No need to wait, no need for a computer—just pure creativity and fun at your fingertips.

What makes this so special for us is how it all started as something we built for our own amusement. It wasn’t just a project; it was personal. But seeing how much joy it’s brought to others? That’s the real win.

So, if you’ve ever wondered what it’s like to star in your favorite show, or you’re just looking for a laugh, give Face Swap AI a try. Swap some faces, share your masterpieces, and let us know what you think. Who knows? Maybe you’ll discover your alternate reality self! 😉

We’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or even wild ideas for what to do next. Let’s keep making creativity accessible—and a little ridiculous—for everyone. 🎬

Had my Intersphinteric Fistulotomy done successfully Thursday 11/14 @ 10:30 a.m and was back home by 1 p.m.

Here’s my story (it’s long but I hope it encourages anyone who feels lost)

I’m a Male 34, Husband to the Best Wife and Father of two beautiful boys (1 and 4 year olds)

I started seeing a CRS ( Colorectal Surgeon) in Mid 2023 for internal hemorrhoids. Minor symptoms but I wanted a solution. Doc was able to help and my issue went away. 

Towards the end of 2023 I started feeling like I was having flare-ups with my hemorrhoids but it was the holidays so I pushed back seeing my CRS. 

Around Feb. of 2024 I ran out of Hydrocortisone 2.5 cream and called for a refill. Doc said “no sir I’d like to see you first it’s been a while”.
Got an appointment for March. 
Appointment comes around, I explain to the resident doctor that I was having symptoms like before PLUS spasms from time to time. Once I mentioned that the CRS wanted to do a visual exam of the area. He found that I had a small fissure but was too tight down there for him to fully check length. I get prescribed Diltiazem A&D ointment. Doc suggested high fiber, tons of water , and just an overall better diet. I change my diet, I weighed 240 the year before and had worked my way down to 200, I cut out dairy almost completely (minus a slice of cheese here and there), I stopped having anything tomato based as i knew it caused me irritation….I felt like I was recovering and my follow ups confirmed that.

But some hot florida summer days and not hydrating enough, plus drinking more coffee than I should, gave me one good strain….and that gave me my first bad episode that lasted a few days. I got stuck in what I like to call “spasm mode”. My sphincter was in a constant spasm where every little thing sent painful shocks. Tried to get in with Doctor but he was booked and they couldn’t see me until the following Tuesday. The next 4/5 days were painful but I could manage. Sitting didn’t feel great and any sudden movements hurt. 
By the time I got to my CRS I was feeling
 better. Symptoms had subdued and he believed I may have re-torn the fissure some but if there wasn’t any more symptoms we would wait on an LIS and just monitor the situation.

It is now August of 2024 and that’s when it happened….my fissure got infected and I developed a Perianal Abscess. 
IT WAS HORRID, the next Wednesday to Sunday consisted of CONSTANT PAIN AND SPASMS, no way of having a bowel movement and the worst burning sensation. I was down bad. I didn’t sleep in days. I went on internet deep dives (don’t recommend it if you suffer from Anxiety, you will find horror stories.)
and found fellow brothers and sisters In pain like me, without sleep like me, in the same dark place I found my self in. My thoughts were all over the place, I couldn’t understand what exactly was going on. After visiting ER, calling CRS on call doc and getting prescribed OXYs, I still had found no relief. I cried a lot. I couldn’t play with my kids or help around the house. I felt useless….

Then Sunday comes along….around Midday after many many many sitz baths and hot showers ( I mean HOT) I felt an abscess above my anus.
I managed to take a picture with my phone and saw a bloody swollen abscess. I called CRS On-Call and she suggested waiting to see my doc the next day. Not an hour after that phone call my Abscess Spontaneously Drained. It was NOT pretty. The smell was awful, the pus was a consistent yellow, green and dark brown! I was freaking out, there was BLOOD! I was alone in the house ( wife and kids were at grocery store)
I drained good for a while squatted over the toilet and using wipes. Once the drainage was manageable I applied Band Aid Non stick gauzes between my cheeks and that’s when I finally realized I WAS NO LONGER IN PAIN, it was instant, as soon as it popped I LIVED again. 
I danced. I sung. I celebrated with Tears of Joy!
Got some rest that night and felt good minus a small amount of irritation ( nothing compared to what I had just gone through). 
Id like to add smoking medical Marijuana and watching Attack on Titan (Anime) were my go to with getting my mind off the pain when I was going through it….at least for a small amount of time.

It’s now the Monday after and I have my appointment with CRS. He inspected my abscess had drained well and said there was no need to further drain. I was to let it drain and heal on its own BUT there was 50% chance it would form a tunnel (Anal Fistula aka Anus # 2 🥴) and I was to return in 5 weeks to have it checked.

7 weeks passed. A Hurricane delay and procedures my CRS had scheduled stopped me from making my appointment at the 5 week mark.   One Monday morning I woke up with more bloody discharge than usual but it went away. I freaked out, called CRS and they sent an order for an MRI. When I finally got in to see him I had done the MRI they asked for (all negative no signs of anything abnormal). Even though my symptoms weren’t horrible, they were still present. The itching was the most noticeable. I was also starting to peel and drain anything from feces to blood to pinkish yellowish discharge ( not much but enough to notice every couple hours) the constant wipe and clean routine had me RAW. Even water felt it caused sensitivity. Once I told him I still had these symptoms he stood up and said “no worries I believe it’s a superficial fistula and can be fixed with a simple Fistulotomy. ( he did quickly mention the “lay open” technique and that there would be a poss. seton placement if needed) 

The turn around was incredible. I saw Doctor for the last appointment pre-Op 10/24/24 and was scheduled by 10/30/25 for 11/14/24.
Did two sets of bloodwork, both came back Normal and then fasted the day before surgery . Tuesday before surgery I had my last solids. Then night before was on only sips of water. 

11/14/24 came around quick…. I felt mentally prepared ( I let out a good cry the day before) I hugged my wife and kids and went on my way. It felt like I had reached the easy part. I would go in the Surgical Center and get treated very nicely.  I was almost at the solution to this on going problem….I felt Ready! I knew there was a recovery stage left and EVERYONE is different so I would just need to go through it to reach the light at the end of the tunnel. I was in my gown by 8:30  a.m and in OR by 10:00. Procedure started at 10:15 and CRS was done by 10:30. Everything went as planned! My CRS was very happy with how the procedure was tolerated and there was no signs of complications. I was awake and discharged by 12:45. When I first woke up my pain was 4/5 out of 10.
I was given an OXY to go home and instructed to take Colace to soften stool, eat as I would “normally”, do sitz baths as needed and alternate Advil and Tylenol on a schedule. Taking each one every 6 hrs but in  3 hour interchanging intervals (example. Advil 3pm Tylenol 6pm Advil 9 pm and Tylenol 12 am) This has kept my pain mostly at bay. I have the gel foam gauze he left inserted which will come out first BM and gauzes folded in between my cheeks. Blood hasn’t been bad and ive felt ok to walk around the house a bit and lay on my side in bed. I ate soup, a banana and some avocado toast at home. I’ve slept some and rested. And I feel good for the most part. There is some pain (nothing unmanageable) but it’s different than what I felt before. This is my path to HEALING and I will take it one step at a time remembering that the lifestyle changes I have made and applied will be for a Better, Healthier ME.
Everyone is Different, we all tolerate pain differently. Some people say tattoos hurt, others say they don’t. It’s just how it is. So if someone online gives you their pain on a scale 1-10 , remember you will have a different tolerance to pain. It could be better or worse but don’t let these things stop you from finding the help you need. Go see a CRS, if surgery is the option they are saying will heal you, Do It. Ask questions in office so your mind doesn’t wonder for answers online.
I have been in the shadows of this Reddit page for months. Reading story after story of people going through similar experiences. I want to Thank all of you, who have had the courage to put your story out there. You helped me not feel alone! 
Again, I’d like to emphasize that EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT. The complexity of the Fistula, the length, the symptoms etc etc all comes down to the individual. 
Be honest with your doctors (that’s the only way they can help you Heal) and don’t let the stigma that comes with anal problems stop you from getting the help you need.
I am now 1 day post-op and know that my journey to healing is just beginning, but after the trauma and annoyance of dealing with these issues for months, I’m Ready to get it over with. I will maintain the area clean, I will be conscious of my diet so I don’t become irregular and I will maintain lifestyle changes to keep any and all issues down there from returning.
My pain this morning is 3/4 out of 10 but the meds have helped some. Have not had a BM yet but it is welcome when it comes. 
I hope my words help anyone who needs it. If you made it this far, I Thank you for reading my story. I have become very vocal about these issues with the men in my family (brothers, cousins etc) and found some have had similar symptoms and not had them checked. People feel embarrassed about these kind of things….you don’t have to be, it is more common than you think, and there is health professionals out there who can help you. Get yourself a good CRS, one you trust and believe in and they will do right by you. 
If you are on your way to recovery or just finding out about any of this, remember this is just a minor setback. One you will recover from and learn from. God has a mysterious but incredible way of doing things. I never question his Will and my faith in Him also helped me throughout. Not everyone is a Believer and that is ok. But any and all positive Energy will be key to finding some kind of normality to cling to while you go through this. 

Peace and Love to All
If anyone has any questions and I can answer them, I will surely try.

Programming it effectively requires more than repetition—it demands engaging the imagination in ways that feel vivid and real. By immersing ourselves in specific techniques like visualization, journaling, and music, we can connect emotionally with our desired outcomes and align our subconscious beliefs with those dreams. Here’s how these methods work to reprogram the mind.

**Visualization** is one of the most direct ways to stimulate the imagination. By vividly imagining your desired reality as though you’re living it now, you create a mental blueprint for your subconscious to follow. The key is to make the experience as sensory-rich as possible: see the colors, hear the sounds, and feel the emotions as if everything is happening in real time. For instance, if your goal is to land your dream job, picture yourself walking into the office, shaking hands with colleagues, and feeling proud of your achievements. Visualization works best when combined with strong emotions like gratitude or excitement, as these emotions create the “imprint” that the subconscious mind responds to.

**Journaling** takes visualization a step further by translating your imagined reality into written words. This technique, often called “scripting,” involves writing as if you’re already living your dream. Describe your ideal day in detail: where you are, what you’re doing, and how you feel. For example, “I woke up in my dream home today, feeling so at peace as the sunlight streamed through the windows. The smell of fresh coffee filled the air as I prepared for an amazing day.” Journaling not only reinforces your vision but also strengthens your emotional connection to it. Plus, it’s a great way to revisit your goals and keep your focus consistent.

**Listening to music** can also be a surprisingly effective tool for programming the subconscious. Music evokes emotions and paints mental pictures, making it a perfect companion for visualization or journaling. Instrumental or cinematic music often works best because it allows you to immerse yourself without the distraction of lyrics. Create a playlist that inspires feelings of joy, empowerment, or serenity, depending on your goals. For example, while journaling about your dream life, play a track that makes you feel unstoppable—it will amplify the emotions you associate with your desires and help anchor those feelings in your subconscious.

These are just a few ways to reprogram your subconscious by stimulating your imagination. Each technique has its unique strengths, and combining them can lead to even greater results. What about you? Do you have a go-to method for programming your subconscious? Whether it’s one of these techniques or something entirely different, I’d love to hear about what works for you!

I am a pharmacy student and as a requirement of my undergrad is to do a summer internship at a community pharmacy.

I have applied to a couple of pharmacies and I got matched to a one very close to where I live. The owner of the pharmacy is an old pharmacist who is very sweet and kind to me , and he has his son 28/M who is also a pharmacist works at the pharmacy and he is the one I spend my training hours with.

 He is so sweet, smart, funny and a handsome person and he is also 5 years older than me which btw is not a big deal where we come from. 

Currently I finished my internship and I just pass by the pharmacy occasionally to spend time with him which a while back he told me to come hang out with him for fun even if I have finished my internship . 

Whenever he sees me I feel like he lights up , he keeps talking to me and on multiple occasions he just calls me by my name .

 He likes to talk to me a lot , he tells me things about his life , asks me about mine and about my family .

 He also shares his favourite music with me while we are sitting together free and he keeps showing me videos he saw that he thinks it was funny.

 He brings me snacks of coffee sometimes to eat while we are sitting together. A couple of days ago I was on my day off and I was kinda sick and I needed some medicine , so I called the pharmacy to order the medicine only to find out that the delivery guy had left early due to some emergency .

 And when the doctor knew I needed medicine he insisted that he gets me the medicine that I need ( he was going to deliver them by himself) which he never did before to anyone even people he knew which are older and more important than me .

 After about an hour he called me told me that he is in my building and that he was going to leave my medicine with the security guy, which I have insisted and tried to stop him from leaving so that I could get down , greet him and give him the money.

 He refused to wait, told me not to come down and that he left the medicine with the security guy and left without taking any money ( btw the medicine was kinda expensive ). 

A lot of situations like this happened where I felt like he might have feelings for me and other times I felt like he was just being nice. 

For example, I don't know if he is not that big of a social media guy or does he just do that with me , but I tried to send him a funny tiktok video which I knew he would like but he hasn't responded or said anything about it , despite him constantly showing me funny videos on his phone while we are sitting together . 

He is the only guy I have truly liked since forever, he takes extra time to teach me things , share his knowledge with me and just tries to make me comfortable and at ease during my training .

 I really like him and whenever I see him or spend time with him I always imagine what it would be like to be his gf or have his attention inside and outside the pharmacy , how it would be like to have him randomly call/text me or to be able to talk to him late at night like any 2 people who like each other . 

And what it would be like to bring him coffee with me when I go to the pharmacy or to just pass by the pharmacy and spend sometime with him whenever I am out and going home just to see him. 

I don't know if I am delusional or if he likes me and just being shy or if there's anything stopping him from persuading me .

 Also me being a very shy person I don't know if I should ever ask him out and if I did how can I do it I am super shy and I have never been in a relationship before nor have I ever asked a guy to hang out or anything like that. 

Any help would be appreciated.

 Any advice on how to deal with my feelings or whether I should try to ask him out ?",1,1731672499.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1grupmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1grupmk/what_are_some_grocery_store_beans_that_you_have/,What are some grocery store beans that you have enjoyed as espresso?,"I know that buying grocery store beans has been seen as a cardinal sin here. 

To share a little bit about why I do it - well, I just like it. I love fruity pour overs and have periods of time when this is all I drink. I love my v60.   
For espresso tho - I have experimented with all - fresh light, medium or dark roasts and grocery store beans - from more generic ones to the classic italian blends. When I travel i'd often visit a different third wave cafe every day but at home I realized that I just want a reliable cheap bean that I can easily pull and easily buy a bag that I can freeze. Where I live freshly roasted coffee is at least two times more expensive than most grocery store beans too, and this is also a strong incentive for me. I fully understand that this is not the case for other countries and also many people don't really like more generic coffees. 

That said, with the right technique and recipe I have managed to pull some great shots in a more classic italian style. 

I've experimented with a lot of grocery store beans and my approach is usually the same. Buy a bag of 1 kg, roasted in the last 7-8 months. Divide it into 4 vacuum bags and freeze 3 of them. 

That all said, i'm interested if there are people here who also pull shots with grocery store beans and what they actually like. I'm based in Europe so I guess americans would have much different experience.   
Some beans I really enjoyed: 

Pellini N°82 VIVACE - it is a blend with around 20% robusta. When pulled at lower temps and lower ratio it is like a syrup. Super chocolatey and thick. Truly great bean that is a bit tricky to pull but is actually pretty tasty. 

Melitta Crema gold - this one usually comes a little more fresh in my country. Usually roasted 1-2 months ago. Incredibly simple bean - easy to pull, nice body and one dimensional taste. Works great in a latte. 100% arabica. 

  
These are my good experiences from the last few months. What are yours?",1,1731671801.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

A few years ago, I scaled my business to a team of 7 and five-figure MRR in 6 months, only to burn it all to the ground after I burned out. 

Long story short I was working 6 am to 10 pm, smashing coffee, skipping meals, and watching my health and relationships all suffer. 

After a few months recovering, that experience forced me to rebuild differently. 

Over the last few years, I’ve flown all over the world and invested over £20k into performance coaching/therapy/courses etc to create systems that allow me to work/live more sustainably, without sacrificing my health, time, or relationships.

And now I want to share what I’ve learned.

If you’re an founder feeling a bit stuck and/or struggling with execution/consistency/balance, I’d like to offer some help.

There’s no catch or fee, just a genuine offer to help a few people get clarity, build momentum, and create systems that actually work.

Realistically, I’ll only be able to work with 2 or 3 founders to make sure I can give enough time and attention to each.

All that’s in it for me is the chance to hear your story, make some likeminded connections, share insights, and maybe build a case study of your success.

If this resonates, feel free to reach out.

1grumht,https://i.redd.it/257ekp8d021e1.jpeg,This subreddit is dangerous :/,"Might be over stimulated this month :/

Left to Right:

1) Nomad - Kibisi (espresso) - Kenya
2) DAK - Strawberry Kiss (espresso) - Ethiopia
3) Bonanza - Masha - Burundi
4) Bonanza - Gogogu - Ethiopia 
5) Early Bird - Zinc de Paris - Blend
6) 19 Grams - Advent Calendar (espresso) - Misc. 

Looking forward to digging into the coffee calendar, last year I got the filter and had found a taste for Ugandan coffee after experiencing a really good one in the calendar.

The DAK - Strawberry Kids is delicious, though can be a bit astringent given its profile. 

The Bonanza - Gogogu is really good and well balanced, I am usually not a big fan of Ethiopian beans but here I am touting the deliciousness of two of them. 

My girlfriend seems to enjoy the Early Bird quite a bit, again well balanced, slightly darker roast with a deep slightly earthy cocoa taste. I would say this a is a great coffee for everyone, but blends also tend to be like that. 

Slightly disappointed in the Burundi, I had some good beans from Burundi earlier in the year (different roaster) and can’t seem to find a bag that I enjoyed since. ",9,1731671477.0,pourover,1,0.85,False

Since last few days, pressure was getting so low eventhough doing descaling regularly with both Delonghi Descaler and DIY Descaler solution. So I decided to do DIY service of the machine at home as I had no patience to wait for schedule of service or for machine to get back from service. 

Tools needed :

-regular Philip screw driver
-special Delinghi screw driver with dip/hole in the middle,
-flat screw driver

After opening top cover, I opened vapour chamber and cleaned it up. 

Then opened base and removed all pipe connections. Took pictures before removing to make sure I don't reconnect wrong tubes. Removed overpressure valve and completely dismentelled. 

Cleaned the parts and blew air with blower part the vaccum and put it all together. 

Descalled it twice. 

Totally it took just an hour but damn it now works as good as new.

I’m heading to NYC from December 14th to January 9th and don’t know anyone here 🙃. I’m from a small town in New Zealand (around 60k people) and am beyond excited to explore the city and meet some like-minded people!

I’ll be spending 3-4 months a year in NYC moving forward (in 3-4 week blocks throughout the year), so I’m hoping to start building some solid connections while I’m here.



# What I’m Looking For

I’d love your recommendations for:

• Apps or communities to meet people outside of the usual options like Meetup.

• Physical places locals love to connect—cafés, co-working spaces, bars, or any social spots.



# About Me

24 y/o male

**Career:**   
I run a digital agency focused on growth marketing, web, and software. Left corporate consulting last year and am also co-launching a fintech startup. I occasionally give keynote talks on marketing, digital, AI, and business. Started my MBA last year but paused it to focus on the biz.

**Interests:**

• Business, finance, startups, and tech

• Jazz/alt music

• Personal development (reading, learning, podcasts)

• Art and theater (admiring, not performing 😅)

• Coffee and food (big foodie; also love a good gin, wine, or cocktail)

• Writing (novice, but I enjoy it)

• Basketball/NFL—planning to catch a Knicks and Giants game (but I’m not a die-hard sports guy)



# Other NYC-Related Questions

1. Favorite hidden gems in the city? (Something beyond the same “40 must-visit NYC spots” from every blog).

2. Best coffee shops in Jersey City (where I’m staying) and Manhattan (south of 106th) for working on a laptop—bonus if they actually have good coffee!

3. Best rooftops for New Year’s Eve—do I need tickets ahead of time?

4. Local blogs or creators to find non-touristy food/drink spots and events.



Would love to hear from you all—thanks in advance for the tips and advice!

Thanks Heaps,

I’ve also tried using oxi-action cleaner on it, which seemed to  work at first, but now also seems to be making it worse. Have I now essentially just bleached away the carpet dye?

But hey, look on the bright side you don’t have to slave away curating a playlist on Spotify. X-FM does all the hard work for you, so you can just sit back, pump your fist, and pretend you’re in an action movie montage. It’s like having your own personal DJ who **actually** knows what’s up.

And if you’re new to the rock scene or just need to expand beyond your usual “classic rock hits” playlist, you’re in for a treat. X-FM is the secret door to discovering new jams you didn’t know you needed in your life.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

The packaging feels professional in that way that makes you simultaneously feel impressed and slightly intimidated, like meeting your partner's ex who has a PHD and runs ultramarathons for fun.

Inside, you'll find 20 individually wrapped trays (10 for top, 10 for bottom) that look like they were designed by someone who watched too much Star Trek. Each packet contains what I can only describe as the dental equivalent of those fancy Japanese toilet seats - high-tech, slightly confusing at first, but ultimately amazing.

# My Favorite Features

**15% hydrogen peroxide formula.** It's strong enough to wage war on years of coffee, wine, and that phase where I thought smoking would make me look cool (narrator: it didn't), but gentle enough that my teeth didn't file for emotional distress.

**Double-layer tray system.** Each tray has two layers. An outer layer that acts like a protective big brother to the inner layer, which molds to your teeth like memory foam for your mouth.

**Flexible wear time.** You can wear these anywhere from 30-60 minutes, which is just enough time to:

* Watch an episode of your favorite show
* Overthink all the decisions you've made in life
* Write half of that email you've been procrastinating on
* Scroll through your ex's Instagram (not that I would know)
* Practice your ""I'm totally paying attention"" face

**Pre-filled design.** The pre-filled design eliminates any possibility of user error. It's basically foolproof, which, as someone who once put face wash on their toothbrush, I deeply appreciate.

**Mint flavor.** It's not just regular mint - it's the kind of mint that makes you feel like you could confidently breathe on a dragon. Plus, it helps mask the slightly chemical taste that reminds you you're actually doing something scientific to your face.

# Pros

**Easy application.** If you can put a letter in an envelope, you can handle these trays. The learning curve is flatter than my attempts at sourdough during lockdown.

**Visible results.** Most users (myself included) report noticeable differences within the first few applications.

**Minimal sensitivity.** Unlike some whitening products that make drinking ice water feel like an extreme sport, these are surprisingly gentle. 

**Professional-grade results (?)** You get near dental office quality without the small talk about your flossing habits or having to lie about how often you actually floss.

# Cons

**Price.** It's not exactly pocket change

**Temporary lifestyle changes.** You'll need to temporarily break up with your beloved coffee, red wine, and anything else that could stain a white shirt. It's like a detox you actually have to stick to.

**The waiting game.** If you're the type who can't sit still, the 30-minute wait time might feel like an eternity. I recommend having a good show queued up

# Final Thoughts

**It's great for:**

* Coffee drinkers seeking redemption
* Wine drinkers with upcoming photo opportunities
* Anyone who's ever looked at their teeth in a selfie and immediately switched to black and white filter
* Busy professionals who want professional results without the professional small talk
* People who have commitment issues with traditional whitening methods

**It might not be for you if:**

* You have ultra-sensitive teeth
* You're looking for a miracle overnight transformation
* You're physically incapable of giving up coffee for a few days
* You enjoy spending more money for the same results at a dentist's office

Me (24M) and my crush (22F),"I have never been in a long term relationship, all my life. Even though I try so hard to have a relationship, I always end up with the wrong person. For instance, I went out with a girl from work for two weeks only to find out she had a boyfriend. This trauma took me 2 years to recover. Now, I'm doing my masters and being alone in a country is not good at all. The only friend whom I could share everything is also my crush now. How fucked up is that? The thing is, she is really spontaneous and had been on more dates within the past 2 months than I have in my entire life. She has a lot of emotional baggage, and she has been through absolute crap her entire life. 

Last week, I told her I had feelings for her, and she straight up told me it would be weird if we break up in the future and not talk again. Also, she told me she never saw me like that. We have been talking a lot on the phone lately, and honestly, I'm growing attached to her more and more. Today, she told me that she's going on a coffee date with a random guy. This is killing me. At one point, I don't want to lose her and our friendship and at another as long as I talk to her, I'm growing more and more attached. If I consider her as a friend and move on, then I would be just faking it. That's going to affect my mental health even more. I seriously don't know what to do. I don't feel like I should love anyone anymore. It's like a nightmare, and it's never ending. Please help.",3,1731669990.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1gru7rk,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1gru7rk/cant_take_office_culture_anymore/,Can’t take office culture anymore ,"Today, I just want to rant a bit about the fact that I’ve been working at this company for a few years. It’s a globally known company. They ask us to be in the office three days a week. At first, I was okay with that, but then I noticed that most departments make their own rules since most team leaders are scattered around the globe. My boss is an older lady who works from home. I have only one colleague in the same office, and she is also older. I swear, I’m so bored and dissociating after a few years here. It feels like the CEO could spit in these people’s mouths, and they would say thank you.

My colleague’s life revolves around her daughter. She lives vicariously through her young daughter and doesn’t take care of herself. I have to pretend I’m a character in an office TV show just to speak with her, which is so far from my personality. She has a different agreement than I do because she’s been in this dead-end job for more time than me. She can come up with some excuse and doesn’t have to come to the office, usually showing up only two days a week, sometimes just one.

After one year, I asked to have the same agreement as her because I feel really bad commuting hours every  day when there’s no one at the office. I would like to use this time to study and improve my life. I asked again a few weeks ago, and they said, “We are in a period where we have to show work; we can’t change your work agreement right now.” Right now?? I’ve been asking since the first year. I feel like a show dog. The company prides itself on “diversity,” so they basically want me in the office to show off in LinkedIn event pictures and to look good when they need to show they don’t hire only male UK employees for positions. It’s a show of crap and bullshit, and I’m at my limit.

I don’t even have much work here, and I don’t understand why they don’t fire me at this point. (If you guys have tips on how to get fired with benefits, please let me know.) I’m so tired of wearing this stupid mask. I don’t care about your kids, your mortgage, or your silly little life. I don’t want to have coffee breaks or pretend I care about these people. I just want to do my work and keep things on a computer screen. The company is going downhill for many reasons, and at this point, I’m just quiet quitting and waiting to be fired. What pisses me off is that I should be able to just dissociate and suck it up, but I can’t. I’m waiting until January to deliver my resignation and praying that they fire me before then.

I wonder why I hate so much. Am I an outcast? Is it normal to hate every one of your coworkers, to not stand up, not fight for their lives to be better, and just accept any bullcrap thrown at them? Does anyone share this feeling?

1gru7e8,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1gru7e8/denial_of_diagnosis_and_caffeine_intolerance/,Denial of diagnosis and caffeine intolerance ,"I got diagnosed with ADHD last year as a 21 year old man and still struggle to come to terms with my diagnosis. I’ve experienced disordered anxiety ever since I was 7 so always thought my inattentive and somewhat hyperactive symptoms were anxiety related. I occasionally become more accepting of it and then when someone unqualified says ‘I don’t think you have ADHD’ or ‘you don’t seem like you have ADHD’ the denial and second guessing comes rushing back. Especially since I’m not an overly severe case and I can contain my hyperactivity for periods to fit into modern day life it makes me think I’m just faking it. 

Also because I’ve heard a lot about caffeine making people with ADHD sleepy but I found a double shot coffee will have me wired and having a panic attack. I’m not sure how accurate of a measure of that is for ADHD though. Thoughts?

I’m see a psychiatrist next month to hopefully get some medication other than the SSRI I’ve been in for the past decade. Is anyone else in a similar position struggling with similar feelings? I wanted this diagnosis but now I have it I keep second guessing it. ",1,1731669827.0,adhd_anxiety,1,1.0,False
1gru6u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gru6u8/upgrade_from_barista_pro_max_2000_better_italian/,"Upgrade from Barista Pro (max. 2000€) - Better Italian Style coffee, occasional milk drink","Hi everyone,  
I'm relatively new to the world of coffee (I've been making espresso at home for about 1 year) and I have a Breville/ Sage Barista Pro. I recently bought a new grinder, the new Eureka Single Dose Pro and I have to say that the difference it big compared to the integrated one.  
I know well that perhaps (or almost certainly) it wouldn't be necessary for my needs, but I would like to switch to a more ""professional"" segment coffee machine.  
  
I almost only make espresso (and only Italian style) and for the moment no milk-based drinks, but in the future I would definitely like to make some cappuccinos or similar drinks, even if the main use will be pure espresso.  
  
The Barista pro is not bad, but I would like to have something better. One thing that really annoys me is that I can never get very hot coffee in the cup, even if I first heat the cups and the filter holder with 2/3 empty shots... you always have to drink it quickly otherwise it will cool down. Furthermore, even when I have time, there is no possibility to heat the machine + cups + filter holder..

Habits/needs/info:  
  
\- Country of residence: Italy (purchase in EU)  
\- Paired with newly purchased Eureka Single Dose Pro grinder  
\- Main use only espresso and occasionally milk drinks.  
\- Italian style or medium/dark roasted coffee, generally drunk without sugar.  
\- Not excessive use: on average 2 coffees in the morning and 2 coffees in the evening, on the weekend probably another 2 coffees or milk-based drinks in the afternoon (when I will learn to make them) in addition to those in the morning and evening, main use however espresso.  
\- Not too complicated to use, so that my girlfriend can also use it, perhaps by programming the volumetric shot.  
  
Wishlist:  
  
\- Have a hotter coffee in the cup  
\- Machine not excessively large (about the size of the Barista Pro at most if possible)  
\- Machine that can heat up rather quickly, but I also consider the possibility of using a Smart Plug if it's worth it.  
\- Possibility, with Smart Plug, that both the cups and the filter holder can be preheated well without having to always make 3/4 empty shots.

I admit, my dream would be to have a machine with E61 group, but I am well aware that it would not go along with the point of rapid heating and with the simplicity of use to allow my girlfriend to use it too (I instead I would really like the idea of ​​having the lever).  


I still have some doubts about this aspect of heating: we often hear about rapid heating and that for many (including myself in some situations) it is a necessity, but from all the reading I have done here on the sub r/espresso, it seems that this is a little bit of a ""utopia"" because, for example, having a hot boiler but a cold brew group is totally useless ... or even machines like my Barista Pro for example where they heat the water instantly but if not used they remain completely cold. For this reason i thing that maybe, in the end, a Smart Plug is more convenient than machines that heat up ""instantaneously"" but not completely (it would be a dream, early in the morning, to get to the coffee machine and feel the cups and the hot filter holder).

I have read a lot about this sub and, keeping to the rapid heating idea, the first two models what i think are the Ascaso Steel uno/duo PID (which as a positive point would have the aesthetic approval of my girlfriend) and the Profitec GO, but obviously I'm open to other proposals.  
  
What would you recommend?

Thank you in advance.

This my first time really putting myself out there so here goes:) I’m looking to make a real authentic connection with someone whether it’s online, or US. If you’re in california or socal specifically that’s even better but it’s not a deal breaker if you’re not. I’ve been trying to practice patience when it comes to meeting someone, but sometimes you have to get up and go get it! So here’s a little bit about myself:

I really love music. It’s definitely my first love language. I sing and song-write in my free time and I love sharing new music to listen to with the people around me, especially my friends and family(would love to share some with you too). It’s been my passion for as long as I can remember. Fun fact: My family says that before I said my first words, I was humming songs. So it’s been a big part of my life for many years. It’s a passion I would love to share with you, too.

Nature. What a beauty mother nature is , right? I love taking nature walks and bird watching. Besides music and cars, I love to nerd out about animals.

Cars are another thing I really love. The car community can be very toxic sometimes, but I keep an open mind to everyone and how they feel. I really like high performance sports cars and super cars. I remember going to my first cars and coffee here in California and it was the first time I saw so much carbon fiber in person. 

Literature. Love it. Need it. I love poetry than any other form(need romantic poems daily, I’m your guy!)

Video games, anime, and sports are some of my favorite things to indulge in when I need to distress and take a break from it all(but I would love to add conversations with you to that list:))

Academics is also a big center of my life as I’m in college right now. I would love to discuss anything about your experience as well. I think my favorite courses I’m taking are my American Sign Language course and my Physiological Psychology course(I’m a psych major!!)

That’s just a little bit about me, but why don’t you come and tell me a little bit about yourself? I’d love to talk with you. Also thanks if you read this far, tell me your favorite memory associated with music when you hit me up:)",1,1731669749.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1gru4o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonAgeVeilguard/comments/1gru4o0/honest_review_after_finishing_the_game/,Honest review after finishing the game,"This will be a long one, so strap yourself in if you wanna read it, and if it wasn't apparent from the title, there will be **SPOILERS** for the whole game.

To set up, I played as a Dwarf Warrior Rook from the Mourn Watch, romanced Harding and used Harding and Emmerich as my main companions, and my combat build was Shield Toss + Necro, difficulty Underdog, 100% completion with the best ending. For previous DA games, I played all the mainline games, very much enjoyed Origins, less 2 and Inquisition was very forgettable to me.

I also played on the release, unpatched version for the whole game because I like to experience games for the first time as the developers are ready to serve them to the players, to see if I should buy the games from the same dev on release next time or if it is not worth it.

**Technical side**: The game runs very well in 1080p on my 3070 with high details, and there has been a surprisingly small amount of bugs on release from a modern game, I only had a single crash through the whole game, and pretty much all bugs would be resolved by teleporting and approaching the location again. The only annoying bug I found was sound cutting out depending on the angle of the camera, most noticeable in the Venatori infiltration, with the crowd cheering cutting in and out. The game also suffers from RAM bleed, so I had to restart every 3 or 4 hours to fix it, but overall, a good job.

**UI design**: The UI design is super bloated and oversized, it takes up too much time on the screen, and when I complete a quest or get a new one, why does it cover a quarter of the screen? I particularly hate the TAB menu where you use the companion abilities, which is super oversized to cover the screen, and filled with a lot of useless borders instead of more buttons and abilities to use. Hotkeys anyone?

**Music**: I do not tend to notice music in games unless it is amazing or atrocious, and I did not notice either here, the music never caught my attention in particular, so I would say overall a good one.

**Visuals**: Most environments are quite gorgeous, but not the dark style I would expect from a mainline Dragon Age game. Would have preffered to give the game more of a darker tone, with less bright purples and colours. The choice to make character heads large compared to body is one I am not a fan off, it gives them a ""something is weird, but IDK what"" feel.

**Character creation**: Now this is the first major down point. The body choices that are available are nice, and the hair physics are amazing, but I missed the option to make a truly out of the average character, both with the boob and butt sliders being limited, as well as not being able to make a truly muscular Qunari (Iron Bull or Antaam style). The fact that the choices from my previous games meant nothing were also extremely dissapointing, and those that were included felt like nothing (like hello, I chose that my Inquisitor romanced Iron Bull, but he does not even mention him????, if the only point was to ask if you romanced Solas or not ,you could have asked yes or no). The factions background could have also been done much better, drawing inspiration from Origins, with a short mission that changes depending on your chosen faction and establishes Rook as a character, because they are clearly not a blank state in this game. More Show, less tell (this will be a recurring theme). Also, why even let you pick a name and surname when nobody, even the characters that knew you before you became Rook, ever use it?



**Armor and Weapon design:** This is another weak point, I played a warrior because I do like more down to earth stuff for my first playthrough, and there are 2 realistic one handed weapons, a few realistic shields and 0 realistic armors and helmets. Everything looks not fantasy and functional, but more mall ninja, and most of the armors would be more dangerous to wear than protect. The scaling for dwarves is also nonexistent, so all the weapons and mainly shields look comically oversized. The choice to add the ski-mask to all hats is lazy, so that you do not have to care about hair and facial hair clipping, and it is still not well made, because my big nose would clip through the face mask. I like the variance, but is it so hard to give us one full plate and one chainmail? Also no longswords is very dissapointing, they were a mainstay in the game for so long, but I know, that would require more work because you just cannot reuse the same animations from the other twohanders.

**Tutorial:** The tutorial is workable, but is both not informative enough and treating you like an idiot at the same time. I do not need to have the same puzzle explained to me 3, 4 or even 5 times and in terms like I was an infant, but I could use a show and explanation what the different status effects do, and why did no one tell me there is a walk button???

**Combat system**: The combat system works for what it is quite well, but is not something I would prefer to see in a Dragon Age game. The fact that you are the only one with actual HP points means enemies will ignore my companions and rush me, and companions are not  really there, they are just extra buttons on my action bar. Companion damage is also extremely negligible. The downgrade to 4 ability system is quite bad, as it limits adaptability to different encounters, which in turn makes all combats have to be simplified, so everything can deal with anything. The enemy variance is super low, you are running into the 5 same types all the time. Bosses are okay, but ever since beating the dragon boss in Crossroads at level 25, nothing was ever even a slight challenge, never even had to press R to heal in combat since level 30. The level system took the worst of both worlds, so some bosses will be level 30, with their pawns being without level, so matched to yours, so the boss will literally take less hits that their underlings to kill. Also, did someone forget about condition immunities, like hello, how can a STONE golem bleed? Difficulty settings are also lazy, as they only increase HP and Damage, not the number or abilities of the enemies, so it makes the combats longer, not harder. The mouse + keyboard optimization is not great, when even with aim assist off my shield throw flew to different places on every throw instead of the centre of the screen. The fact that companions scream ""nice one"" like every 2 seconds is super annoying and made me exit the game multiple times, if I ever decide to replay this game, I need a mod that removes this.

**Factions**: The 4 actual factions that matter are well made, even though some of them (Veil Jumpers) seem absolutely inept with the quest design (Wait, they got lost again doing their only job that they are supposed to be good at?). Mourn Watch and Lords of Fortune seem just slapped on top to pad out the factions, and in the case of Mourn Watch their quests feel more like radiant quests than properly written ones, and Lords of Fortune pretty much do not even have quests. Antivan Crows also feel more like a bunch of coffee addict emo kids than a functional assassin organization that buys child slaves to train.

**World**: Again, Show, don't tell is a fact again. We know there is supposed to be slavery,religion, racial discrimination and discrimination of mages, but we do not see any of this anywhere in the world except for the Venatori infiltration, where it is only used as a cheap way to make them seem even more like the bad guys. The world also feels quite dead, like it does not exist while you are not around. Feels very generic RPG, not Dragon Age overall. The locations of Rivain and Grand Necropolis also feel more like padding than fully realized locations compared to the other cities and locations.

**Main story**: The main story writing is quite good, even though it butchers some established lore. The plot twist with Varric was one I did not expect, and was positively surprised by it, Solas screwing us over on the other hand could be seen from the start of the game. I can also se the elven gods twisting the blight as a nice design point, even though I am not a fan of some of the new darkspawn, the ogre looks more like an anorexia patient than a massive monster. The fact that Demons, the main big bads in 2 and super dangerous things in origins were reduced to pretty much cannon fodder is super dissapointing. Also Venatori, the Human supremacists, working with qunari and elves feels like something they would not do, and the infiltration mission was stupid, with my dwarf just being there and being accepted, why not use shapeshifting magic to disguise us, we know it exists in the world (but the writers probably do not). The main story also gets progressively better over time, which is quite bad, since the first 2 hours is where you are supposed to hook people in so they do not refund, which is something I almost did because it was so bad. Also, what they did to my sarcastic femme fatale Morrigan is inexcusable, she looks like her, sounds like her, but the personality is completely different.

**Side quests**: Most of them were okay to good, I am glad there is next to none of the ""Bring me 10 bear asses"" type quests that Inquisition overused to hell. None of the side quests feels particularly memorable, only ones that stand out are puzzle quests that the game shows you where to go to instead of properly giving you directions, which is lazy when it comes to this type of quest. Also the fact that journal half the time does not give you the text of the notes you pick up and you have to remember them is quite bad. Missed some impactful choices, but this is a problem of the whole game, not just side quests.

**Dialogues:** This is the absolute low-point of the game. All the RPG and choice was taken out and replaced with Yes supportingly, Yes jokingly and Yes slightly sternly. You cannot choose to disagree with companions on almost anything, and you cannot even be properly harsh or choose a evil or even neutral solution to problems, always have to be the good guy (except for punching the first warden, that was an absolute highlight, if only it was not the only one in the game that matters, mayor does not matter). The dialogues feel unnatural, like the characters are talking at each other, not with each other. The language of the writing feels too modern for a fantasy game (""ooof?"" Really?), which will take you out of the fact that it should be a fantasy game, not a game set in today's world among the millenial/gen Z people. There is nothing good to say about the dialogues.

**Companions, ranked from most to least favourite:**

Emmerich: Feels like a standout character from this game, has actual failures and weaknesses in his past, his style of speech fits his character, and his companion quest and decision was the only decision in the game is the only one where I had to actually think for a few minutes before I could make a decision. Sad thing is, he is pretty much unimportant to the main story, compared to everyone except Taash and maybe Harding.

Harding: A bit of a bland character, but not in the wrong way. The way she has to deal with her new powers is interesting, and she was my romantic interest. Her being an established character from a previous game also helped a lot, mainly with her being so pointless for the whole group after the beginning.

Davrin: Another bland character in a good way, he is a stern parent, a warden and a warrior, so it works well for him, and his little plushy seller companion is good, but not nearly as good as Manfred.

Lucanis: Interesting character, but I would like more depth than likes coffee and is a professional as a character trait, since the demon that possessed him does not really show up. I also hate the writers for not giving me an option to stab Illario and kill him. Still a solid one.

Bellara: Man, I found bellara so fucking annoying at the start of the game, expecting her to be another ""I'm quirky"" character, but her companion quests made her much more intriguing, so I ended up liking her quite a bit (also not having her in the party helped a lot).

Neve: Neve is bland, but in the bad kind of way. I found her utterly uninteresting personally, and her companion quests do not help at all.

Taash: Taash is bad... They are pointless for the main story of the whole game, as the dragon slayer that slays 0 dragons, and when we see Ghilan'nain's archdemon, they back out with ""that is not a dragon, idk what to do"" and the other archdemon gets taken out by Solas. The use of non-binary took me completely out of the fantasy illusion, you can compare this to Dorian in Inquisition, who is never stated as gay, he says he prefers the company of men, which fits much better. The whole conflict with mother story also feels like a much inferior version of Dorian confrontation with father story. Their whole personality is also completely unlikeable to me, feels more like a teenager than a grown adult, and the fact that I could not call them out on their hipocrisy during the Emmerich scene is very dissapointing.

Now, to get to the score. I will give the game 3 different scores, because it feels like it deserves them. As an action adventure game, like God of War, I would give it an 8/10. As a generic RPG, it would get a 7/10, and as a mainline Dragon Age game, a 5/10. Overall, if I had to compare it to RPGs from the Previous decade, it would land in the good, not great tier, with games like Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning and Witcher 2. I will probably not be replaying this game anytime soon, if ever, because there is next to no replayability anyways.",0,1731669515.0,DragonAgeVeilguard,0,0.44,False

1gru43q,https://www.reddit.com/r/bestofpositiveupdates/comments/1gru43q/i_23f_have_a_huge_crush_on_my_28m_mentor/,I 23[F] have a huge crush on my 28[M] mentor,"I 23F a pharmacy student and as a requirement of my undergrad is to do a summer internship at a community pharmacy.

I have applied to a couple of pharmacies and I got matched to a one very close to where I live.

The owner of the pharmacy is an old pharmacist who is very sweet and kind to me , and he has his son who is also a pharmacist works at the pharmacy and he is the one I spend my training hours with.

He is so sweet, smart, funny and a handsome person and he is also 5 years older than me which btw is not a big deal where we come from.

Whenever he sees me I feel like he lights up , he keeps talking to me and on multiple occasions he just calls me by my name .

He likes to talk to me a lot , he tells me things about his life , asks me about mine and about my family .

He also shares his favourite music with me while we are sitting together free and he keeps showing me videos he saw that he thinks it was funny.

He brings me snacks of coffee sometimes to eat while we are sitting together.

A couple of days ago I was on my day off and I was kinda sick and I needed some medicine , so I called the pharmacy to order the medicine only to find out that tue delivery guy had left early due to some emergency .

And when the doctor knew I needed medicine he insisted that he gets me the medicine that I need ( he was going to deliver them by himself) which he never did before to anyone even people he knew which are older and more important than me .

After about an hour he called me told me that he is in my building and that he was going to leave my medicine with the security guy, which I have insisted and tried to stop him from leaving so that I could get down , greet him and give him the money.

He refused to wait, told me not to come down and that he left the medicine with the security guy and left without taking any money ( btw the medicine was kinda expensive ).

A lot of situations like this happened where I felt like he might have feelings for me and other times I felt like he was just being nice. 

For example, I don't know if he is not that big of a social media guy or does he just do that with me , but I tried to send him a funny tiktok video which I knew he would like but he hasn't responded or said anything about it , despite him constantly showing me funny videos on his phone while we are sitting together .

He is the only guy I have truly liked since forever, he takes extra time to teach me things , share his knowledge with me and just tries to make me comfortable and at ease during my training .

I really like him and whenever I see him or spend time with him I always imagine what it would be like to be his gf or have his attention inside and outside the pharmacy , how it would be like to have him randomly call/text me or to be able to takk to him late at night like any 2 people who like each other .

And what it would be like to bring him coffee with me when I go to the pharmacy or to just pass by the pharmacy and spend sometime with him whenever I am out and going home just to see him.

I don't know if I am delusional or if he likes me and just being shy or if there's anything stopping him from persuading me . 

Also me being a very shy person I don't know if I should ever ask him out and if I did how can I do it ?

I am super shy and I have never been in a relationship before nor have I ever asked a guy to hang out or anything like that.

Any help would be appreciated.

After years of looking like I'd been dipped in coconut oil every time I tried to protect my face from the sun, I finally caved and bought the sunscreen that dermatologists probably bathe in. This one, from EltaMD. 

Here's my thoughts.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

When the package arrived, I half expected it to be delivered by someone in a white lab coat, given the price point and the fact that every dermatologist on TikTok swears by it. Instead, it came in the same Amazon package as my impulse-bought cat toys and that book I'll probably never read. 

First pump out of the bottle and I'm already overthinking it. 

So I did what any rational person would do. I pumped out way too much and proceeded to slather it all over my face while panic-googling ""how much sunscreen is too much sunscreen?"" 

But the application experience was surprisingly... luxurious? Like being gently caressed by a very expensive marshmallow. No drag, no weird pilling, no feeling like I'm coating my face in spackling paste.

It absorbed faster than my last relationship ended. One minute it's there, the next it's gone, leaving behind skin that feels like it just got back from a spa retreat. No sticky residue, no weird tackiness, no feeling like I need to hold my face away from my phone to avoid leaving greasy smudges everywhere.

By this point, I was either experiencing the placebo effect of expensive skincare, or this stuff was actually living up to the hype. 

# My Favorite Features

**Zinc oxide protection.** The scientists behind this formula somehow managed to make zinc oxide invisible – like my ex after he borrowed money. The protection is there, but the ghost-face effect is gone. It's broad-spectrum protection that doesn't make you look like you're preparing for a role in a Victorian period drama.

**Hyaluronic acid infusion.** They've packed this with hyaluronic acid too. My skin went from ""maybe she's born with it, maybe it's dehydration"" to ""okay, who's this glowing person."" Well, I wouldn't go that far, but still it's a nice addition. 

**Makeup-friendly formula.** If you've ever tried to apply makeup over traditional sunscreen, you know how bad it can get. It's the perfect primer in disguise.

**Non-comedogenic.** For something that offers this much protection, it somehow doesn't clog pores. My acne-prone areas haven't staged a rebellion, which is honestly a miracle considering my skin usually treats new products like personal attacks.

**Fast-absorbing technology.** The speed at which this disappears into your skin is incredible. One minute it's there, the next it's gone, like my motivation to go to the gym – but in a good way.

# Pros

**Genuinely moisturizing.** My skin refreshed, balanced, and somehow more zen. It's not that fake moisture that disappears faster than my paycheck.

**No weird smell.** Can we talk about how most sunscreens smell like a chemical plant had a baby with a coconut? This doesn't smell like anything. Nothing. 

**Works well with others.** This sunscreen layers under makeup better than I layer excuses for being late to morning meetings. No pilling, no separation, no weird patchy moments where your foundation suddenly decides to form little islands on your face.

# Cons

The pump sometimes gets a bit finicky towards the end, like it's holding the last bit hostage until you buy another bottle. 

Also, if you're expecting this to solve all your life problems, it won't. It won't pay your taxes, it won't explain why your ex still watches your Instagram stories, and it definitely won't make your cat stop knocking things off tables. It's just really good sunscreen, not a miracle worker.

# Final Thoughts

**It's perfect for:**

* People who wear makeup and don't want it sliding off their face like they're in a Salvador Dali painting
* People who value their time and don't want to spend 20 minutes waiting for their sunscreen to absorb
* Anyone who's ever said ""I hate wearing sunscreen"" (this will convert you)

Is it expensive? Yes, like I should probably include this in my monthly budget expensive. 

Will I keep buying it? Also yes, because apparently, I've become someone who spends real money on sunscreen, and I'm not even mad about it. It's like when you finally buy good sheets or a quality coffee maker – you can't go back to the cheap stuff without feeling like you're punishing yourself.

When SO takes both kids to the other’s activity, the one not doing the activity if often bored/complaining which is why they would rather stay at home with me.

SO is happy for me to take whichever child has no activity out so they’re not just at home waiting for him and the other SK to get home. It was SO’s idea for me to take them out. Both kids enjoy when I take them out (think art galleries they want to visit and a choice of restaurant after). I also enjoy taking them out, I read my book (favourite hobby) on the way there and back, and always grab my favourite coffee too.

BM ofc doesn’t like that any of the SK’s are spending time with me and this has been the source of the arguments between SO and BM for the last couple of weeks. SO has stated he trusts me with the kids, we have been together over 4 years and is happy for them to go out with me especially since it’s during his time - which is a valid point. It’s important to state, before the 50/50 custody, whilst SO would take one to their activity, the other would be at home with BM, so this isn’t exactly a new arrangement it’s just that I’m involved. 

It used to be water off of a ducks back when it came to BM, but the constant bringing up of my name and me being an issue or a problem to argue is really starting to get to me. I will bring this up to SO later today or tomorrow. 

It feels like she wants me to argue my case or get involved in this argument - I really don’t want to do that, I don’t want to get involved in this back and forth especially since there isn’t really a solution being offered. Unless you count me moving out of my own home whilst the kids are here which I’m sure BM would love (I’m not doing that) How do I rise above this and not let it affect me as much as it is?",2,1731668507.0,stepparents,5,1.0,False

A couple of days ago she went out with him for coffee for closure, (which i was fine with) granted i was hoping that was the end of it but yesterday she brought up the fact of staying friends which i pretty firmly said no about.

In my mind after the closure that would've been the end of it but apparently it can never stop, since the begging of the relationship it has been like this, even though she keeps repeating that she only wants me talks about a future toghether with all the different times she compared me to him (even though now she stopped after talking about it) i can't feel right about it.

These clever pieces not only elevate the look of your space but also provide practical solutions to everyday challenges. In this blog post, our [interior designers in Pune](https://dlifeinteriors.com/pune/) will help you explore the art of integrating these units into your home, ensuring that every piece serves a purpose.

# The Rise of Multi-Functional Design

The trend towards multi-functional design has been growing for years, driven by urbanization and the need for efficient use of space. In cities where living space is at a premium, the demand for furniture that serves more than one purpose is at an all-time high. These versatile units offer solutions to common problems, such as lack of storage or limited entertainment space, by combining several functions into one stylish piece.

Multi-functional decorative units are not only practical but also add a layer of sophistication to any room. Their design often incorporates sleek lines and modern aesthetics that appeal to contemporary tastes, making them a popular choice among interior design enthusiasts.

# Benefits of Multi-Functional Decorative Units

One of the primary advantages of multi-functional decorative units is their ability to maximize space without compromising on style. These units help homeowners make the most of every square foot, especially in smaller homes or apartments. For instance, a coffee table that doubles as a storage unit can keep living rooms tidy, while a sofa bed provides an extra sleeping area for guests without the need for a separate guest room.

Another benefit is the cost-effectiveness of purchasing one piece of furniture that accomplishes multiple tasks. This can be especially appealing to those on a budget or looking to save without sacrificing quality or aesthetics. Additionally, these units often allow for increased creativity in design, as they can be customized to fit specific needs and preferences.

# Types of Multi-Functional Decorative Units

# Storage-Integrated Seating

Storage-integrated seating is a perfect example of a multi-functional decorative unit that combines comfort with utility. Ottomans and benches with built-in storage offer a place to sit while keeping items like blankets, books, or shoes out of sight. These pieces are ideal for entryways, living rooms, and bedrooms, providing both a seating solution and a storage option in one.

# Convertible Furniture

Convertible furniture has gained popularity for its space-saving capabilities. Think of a dining table that can expand to accommodate more guests or a desk that transforms into a bed. These units are ideal for small apartments or homes where space is limited, yet functionality cannot be compromised.

# Multi-Purpose Shelving

Shelving units that serve multiple purposes can drastically alter a room’s layout.[ Bookshelves](https://dlifeinteriors.com/custom-made/products/living-room/bookshelves/) with built-in desks or cabinets that double as room dividers are excellent examples. They not only provide ample storage but also define spaces within an open floor plan, offering a sense of structure and order.

# Choosing the Right Multi-Functional Units for Your Home

When selecting multi-functional [decorative units](https://dlifeinteriors.com/custom-made/products/decorative-units/), consider the size and layout of your space first. It's essential to choose pieces that complement the existing decor while addressing your functional needs. Look for units that blend seamlessly with your home's color palette and design style, whether modern, minimalist, or traditional.

Consider the specific functions you need these units to fulfill. If you require extra storage, opt for pieces with hidden compartments or adjustable shelving. If versatility is key, look for furniture that can easily adapt to different uses, such as tables with extendable surfaces or seating that converts into beds.

# Incorporating Multi-Functional Units into Different Rooms

# Living Room

In the living room, multi-functional decorative units can create a stylish and organized environment. Consider a TV stand with built-in shelves to store media accessories or a coffee table with hidden storage for magazines and remote controls. These pieces not only enhance the room's aesthetics but also keep it clutter-free.

# Bedroom

For bedrooms, consider bed frames with drawers for additional storage space or headboards with built-in shelves for books and nighttime essentials. A dressing table that doubles as a workspace can be a valuable addition, especially in smaller rooms where space is limited.

# Kitchen

In the kitchen, multi-functional units can maximize efficiency and style. An island with storage underneath provides a place for food preparation while offering additional storage for pots, pans, and utensils. Foldable tables can act as extra counter space when needed and be tucked away when not in use, keeping the kitchen area spacious and functional.

# Enhancing Your Space with Custom Multi-Functional Units

For those who seek a unique touch, custom multi-functional decorative units are a great option. Collaborating with skilled craftsmen or interior designers can result in pieces tailored to your exact needs and preferences. Custom units can incorporate personal elements, such as family heirlooms or artwork, ensuring that your space is truly one-of-a-kind.

Custom designs allow homeowners to experiment with materials, finishes, and configurations that cater to specific lifestyle requirements. Whether it's a bespoke bookshelf that fits an awkward corner or a dining set that transforms into a bar, custom multi-functional units offer limitless possibilities.

# The Environmental Impact of Multi-Functional Design

Apart from their practical benefits, multi-functional decorative units also contribute to sustainability. By reducing the need for multiple pieces of furniture, these units help minimize resource consumption and waste. Choosing durable materials ensures longevity, further reducing the environmental footprint of your home decor.

Opting for sustainably sourced materials and working with eco-friendly manufacturers can enhance the environmental benefits of your multi-functional units. This conscious approach supports a greener lifestyle and promotes responsible consumerism.

# Future Trends in Multi-Functional Furniture

The future of multi-functional decorative units holds exciting possibilities as designers continue to innovate. Advancements in technology and design are likely to result in even more adaptable and intelligent furniture solutions. Smart furniture that integrates technology, such as charging stations or built-in speakers, will likely become increasingly popular.

1grtsbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zimbabwe/comments/1grtsbv/how_i_turned_my_life_around_financially/,How I turned my life around financially.,"1. I stopped dating and trying to meet girls. It helped me focus more on my work and to save the few quid I was earning. No emotional stress, no relationship drama etc.....All my energy was solely focused on improving my financial standing.  
  
2. I had a plan. Last year around this time I wrote in my diary my target monthly income and the revenue streams I would use to get there. The target was $400. For the first 6 months of this year I was making half of that but now I'm on course to making more than 5X that monthly. Of course the plan changed as time went on coz rarely do things go perfectly according to plan.  
  
3. I believed in myself. I have a cousin from my mother's side who's roughly my age. He didnt go past O'Level and he was making significantly more than me hustling in the streets. My mother tried convincing me to get me into the same hustling line of work. I said no. I had a plan and I had to stick to it. I had to have the mental fortitude to deal with constant comparisons with my cousin.  
  
4. I did shit for free. As a consultant, it's difficult to give advice for free since that advice actually counts as work. I know most consultants use this logic, ""Doctors get paid for consultations, why can't clients respect us and pay for business consultations as well?"" It makes sense, but sometimes you have to lead with value. I am a young guy just out of Varsity in his late twenties with no proven track record. If I can give some advice for free to build my CV and then I use that CV to get more jobs. All the clients that I have now, I did some shit for them for free at first. Go have that coffee with the client, talk to them. Even if it doesn't translate directly into cash it might get you a useful referal.

5. I didn't wait to get a job after Uni. I remember after Uni I had zero links and it hit me hard that I was going to be part of the statistics for unemployed graduates. I remember taking the few hundred dollars I had in savings, buying a new laptop, paying rent at a co-working space (about $75) and starting my consultancy. That was the hardest period of my life (so far) coz I wasn't making any money though I was meeting people who would become key people in my future life. This little experience I was getting helped me build a CV which I then used to get a job in my field 6 months later.

6. I stopped comparisons. Comparison is the thief of joy. I stopped asking my friends how much they were making, how much they were getting paid etc. I knew this had the potential of derailing my plans. Picture this: If I knew a friend who was a fuel attendant and was making $400 a month and me and my little consultancy we're making $150, chances are if the opportunity arose I would dump the consultancy and become a fuel attendant. Easy decision. But would this move be relavant to my future goals? Nope. 

I know I left out some more tips. I'll be posting them as they come.",5,1731668109.0,Zimbabwe,2,0.86,False

We ended things last summer 2023 after nearly a year. He's German and sometimes his verbal communication can be harsh and also his delivery isn't exactly the best. But he has some other great qualities, plans everything to the T so I don't have to worry about it, pays for everything, let's me know about his whereabouts and he's very handsome man although balding a bit. I honestly didn't know how to handle him at that time since he had some deaths in his family and he shut me down. I went three times to meet him and gave him the support I could, but he was still processing those feelings and even the smallest thing I did bothered him and he got verbally combative, I got very upset and instead of communicating I started packing my things up(big mistake) and he broke things off. I cried a lot and he was very upset too for shutting me down, he sent my stuff through post too. We didn't talk for nearly a year. 

I go to Vienna( where he lives) often for work and for interviews and started seeing my stories and started asking me why I'm there, I kept things casual and one day he insisted to meet me even for a few minutes if I could manage only even a coffee. I agreed but I moved to Germany at that time already but we kept in touch, he sent me pictures of his family that things had cooled down abit. 

I had to go to Budapest meanwhile where I lived before for some paperwork and said I'll pass by vienna, he offered his place for me to freshen up from travel and everything, when we met after our breakup it was sweet, he kissed my forehead multiple times and gave me the keys to his apartment and told me in German that he's happy that I'm there. When I finished my sightseeing, he came home cooked for me and I ended up staying over. 

We still kept in touch, he let's me know about his whereabouts always, send me pictures of his friends even when he's with his friends on their stag do, when he's with his dad, cooking w his mom all those things. I ended up visiting vienna again cz I had an interview there, I stayed at his apartment but the old wounds kind of opened up, he has a very bad delivery as told before and it ended up hurting me, with him saying that sometimes I expect him to do everything for me and that i struggle with basic tasks to the point where he said in the future when we have kids it would be a challenge with how i operate things, when in reality I was adjusting to his space, after listening to him complain I physically shut down after that and didn't let him touch me, I also told him that he lacks empathy and he would be a good boss but I would not have him as my partner which hurt him I guess. He didn't apologize but I was crying at night and he thought I slept so he pulled me close, kissed me, wiped my tears and pulled the covers over for me. He really struggles with verbal communication and can only show through actions while I physically block when I get upset. 

The next day morning I was still very sad with all that happened, I made breakfast and he asked me if I would stay over and try to cheer me up with some king julian memes which I love but I didn't react, when all I wanted to was just to hold him. He came downstairs to drop me off and he told me that we don't have to go through the pain and end things and wished me for my work in Vienna. I said vienna is not for me and I wouldn't want to be here( I regret that too :( but everything was just too raw) and left. I had time process everything that happened. Although what he said hurt me, he has so many other good qualities. He's actually a great guy but just struggles with intimacy generally. He still hasnt deleted my number, has kept my things still unlike last time when he sent them back and actively views my social media. I do want to give this a chance but I feel like he's at wrong here and wanted him to apologize but I ended up clearing the interview too and I might have a next round in vienna soon. 

My question is should I reach out to clear out the air when I go to his city for the interview again? Is there a future here?

I recently downsized my kitchen appliances and had to figure out if a 2 quart air fryer would be enough for my needs. Let me break it down for you in simple terms.

A 2 quart air fryer is pretty compact - it's about the size of a coffee maker. To give you a better idea, it can fit approximately:
- 6-8 chicken wings
- 1 pound of french fries
- 2 small chicken breasts
- 1 personal pizza (around 8 inches)

Perfect for singles or couples, but probably not ideal for families. I live alone, and it's been just right for my portions. The actual dimensions vary by brand, but most 2 quart models measure roughly 10-12 inches in height, 8-10 inches in width, and 8-10 inches in depth.

Here's what I love about this size:
- Takes up minimal counter space
- Perfect for small apartments
- Uses less electricity than larger models
- Heats up faster
- Easy to clean

If you're interested in checking out some great 2 quart air fryers, I found some awesome deals here: https://athometouch.com/airfryer

The downside? You might need to cook in batches if you're preparing food for more than two people. Also, some recipes might need adjusting since most online air fryer recipes are written for larger models.

I've been using mine for about six months now, and honestly, it's been a game-changer for quick, healthy meals. The food comes out perfectly crispy, and I love that I don't need to heat up my whole kitchen to cook a small portion.

For those wondering about the cooking space, think of it like this: the basket is about the size of a medium mixing bowl. It's deep enough to stack foods like fries or wings, but you'll want to shake them halfway through cooking for even results.

Before you buy one, consider your typical cooking needs. If you regularly cook for more than two people or like to meal prep, you might want to look at larger models. I've found some great options in different sizes here: https://athometouch.com/airfryer

Pro tip: Don't just focus on the quart size - also check the basket shape. Some 2 quart models have deeper but narrower baskets, while others are wider but shallower. The shape can make a difference depending on what you usually cook.

Hope this helps anyone who's on the fence about getting a 2 quart air fryer! Let me know if you have any questions - I'm happy to share more about my experience.",1,1731667842.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

If my body hair had a LinkedIn profile, it would be listed as 'aggressively overachieving'. So, I've been giving IPL a try, and here's my thoughts on this model from Innza.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

When the INNZA IPL arrived, I spent a good five minutes just staring at it. There's something deeply unsettling about holding what is essentially a handheld laser gun and thinking, yes, I'm going to point this at my body parts.

The instruction manual was surprisingly thick, which immediately triggered my commitment issues. Was I really ready for a relationship this serious with a hair removal device? But then I remembered the time I tried to wax my own bikini line and ended up stuck to myself like a human pretzel, and suddenly reading a manual didn't seem so bad.

Setting it up felt like preparing for a first date - there's excitement, anxiety, and the lingering fear that something might go horribly wrong. But once you get past the initial intimidation factor, there's something weirdly empowering about it.  Like, yes, I am a responsible adult who can be trusted with laser technology.

# My Favorite Features

**Ice cooling technology.** The device cools down to 8°C, which is perfect for those of us who've experienced the ""OH DEAR GOD WHY IS IT BURNING"" sensation with other hair removal methods. It's like having a mini freezer shooting laser beams at your legs - a sentence I never thought I'd write. The cooling sensation actually feels pleasant, like your skin is getting a tiny spa treatment while being zapped into smoothness.

**999,999 flashes.** That's not a typo - it's actually almost a million flashes. Either they're really confident in their product, or someone fell asleep on the 9 key. To put this in perspective, that's enough flashes to remove hair from approximately 500 full bodies, or one very, very hairy person for several lifetimes.

**Dual flash modes.** The device comes with two modes: auto and manual. Auto mode is for when you're feeling lazy and just want to slide it across your skin like you're scanning groceries at self-checkout. Manual mode is for when you want to pretend you're a precision sniper targeting each individual hair follicle with the dedication of a professional assassin. I started with auto mode because, let's be honest, if there's an easier way to do something, I'm taking it.

**Five power levels.** Level 1 feels like being tickled by a butterfly. Level 5 feels like that butterfly is wearing steel-toed boots. The cool thing is you can customize your experience based on your pain tolerance and how much you hate your hair that day. 

# Real World Performance

**Week 1.** Started with my legs because if something went wrong, at least I could hide them in pants. The cooling feature made the whole process surprisingly pleasant - like getting a cold compress and a tiny light show at the same time. The clicking sound the device makes is satisfying, like popping bubble wrap but way more productive.

**Week 2.** Moved on to my underarms, which required some mild contortionism. Pro tip: If you don't look like you're trying to scratch your own back while doing the hokey pokey, you're probably doing it wrong. 

**Week 3.** This is when I realized that consistency is key. It's like going to the gym - you can't do it once and expect to look amazing. But unlike the gym, you can do this while watching Netflix. I knocked out an entire season of Bridgerton while de-furring myself.

**Week 4.** By now, there was a noticeable difference. Areas I treated regularly were showing less hair growth. The hair that did grow back was finer and sparser, like it had given up on life and decided to pursue a career in being invisible instead.

# Pros

**Actually works.** Unlike that ""miracle"" cream that promised to dissolve hair but just gave you a chemical burn, this actually delivers results. The reduction in hair growth is noticeable, and what does grow back is significantly finer - like your hair decided to go on a diet.

**The cooling feature is everything.** It's like having a tiny ice pack built into your hair removal device. Whoever came up with this idea deserves a Nobel Prize, or at least a really nice fruit basket.

**Painless (mostly).** Even on higher settings, it's more of a ""oh, that's happening"" sensation rather than a SWEET MOTHER OF PEARL experience.

**Long-term savings (?)** If I calculate the money spent on razors, waxing, and post-waxing wine, this device practically pays for itself. Plus, I'm saving time - time I could spend doing literally anything else.

# Cons

**Not for everyone.** If you're blonde, red-headed, or have very light hair, this isn't your magic wand. The device works by targeting melanin, so it needs some color to work with. 

**Takes patience.** This isn't a one-and-done situation. You need to commit to regular sessions, like a relationship but with less drama and more visible results.

**Initial cost.** It's pricier than a pack of razors. But so is therapy after another bad waxing experience, so...

# Final Thoughts

The INNZA IPL is perfect for anyone who's tired of looking like they're wearing a fur coat 24/7 and has the patience of a saint. It's especially great for dark-haired individuals who've been blessed (cursed?) with robust hair growth. However, if you're blonde, redhead, or expecting overnight results, you might want to look elsewhere.

Is it worth it? If you calculate how much you spend annually on temporary hair removal methods, this device practically pays for itself. It's like buying a coffee maker instead of hitting Starbucks every day - initially expensive but ultimately saving you both money and dignity.

For me, I've been quite impressed by this thing. It's also cheaper than some of the name brands but I don't see a huge difference really.

This is causing downtime log system to freakout. We’re running an Omada controller with a ER8411 gateway by tp-link. 3 APs on the WiFi subnet. Logs don’t show what devices are conflicting, just shows there’s a confliction

Idk where to go from here. I’ve built tools to log, I’ve checked every single system service on every server, I’ve checked timed automated scripts to see if anything’s happening, I’ve checked all nodes to see if they have a misconfigured IP, but after a week I’ve come up with nothing…

Edit: I should note, everything is using a static IP, we’re also using DHCP with an address range of a different subnet for WiFi devices, could the router have conflicts with its IP routing vs the gateways routing of the lan and wan addresses? Does that even make sense? It’s 5am and haven’t slept because this is keeping me up. Send coffee pls.

TLDR; Everything drops network at exactly the same time every hour then comes back immediately. Can’t find ARP confliction if that’s even it

As someone who loves my morning coffee ritual, it’s safe to say I was wasting a lot of grounds. That all changed when a gardening friend casually mentioned, “You know, coffee grounds are absolute gold for plants, right?” Cue my curiosity. What I discovered completely transformed how I use coffee in my home and garden. Let me share with you the seven incredible reasons why you should never toss your coffee grounds in the bin again.

Full article  ---  [here](https://allbionow.com/7-amazing-reasons-why-coffee-grounds-should-be-used-in-every-home-garden/)






1. The Perfect Fertiliser Alternative

I used to spend a small fortune on fertilisers, always hunting for something organic yet effective. It turns out that coffee grounds are brimming with nutrients like nitrogen, potassium, and magnesium—everything your plants crave. Sprinkling a thin layer around my vegetable garden became my go-to routine. My tomatoes? They’ve never looked happier.

It’s like giving your plants a caffeine boost, minus the jitters! Just be sure to use them in moderation; too much can overwhelm the soil.

2. Keeps Pests Away

Slugs and snails used to wreak havoc on my lettuce patch. It felt like an ongoing battle I was doomed to lose. Then I heard that coffee grounds can act as a natural pest deterrent. Apparently, the texture and slight acidity aren’t exactly a gourmet treat for slimy critters.

Now, I sprinkle a protective coffee barrier around my plants, and it’s been surprisingly effective. Watching my lettuce thrive feels like a small victory every time I glance at the garden.

3. Eco-Friendly Compost Booster

I’ll admit it—starting a compost pile was daunting at first. But once I realised how much my kitchen scraps could contribute to my garden, I was hooked. Coffee grounds quickly became one of my favourite additions.

They break down beautifully and add a rich, dark colour to the compost. Pairing them with dry materials like leaves or shredded paper creates the perfect balance. It feels so satisfying knowing I’m reducing waste and giving back to the earth.

4. Deodorises the Home

If you’ve ever had a mystery smell in your fridge, you’ll understand my frustration. No matter how much I cleaned, there was always a lingering odour. That’s when I stumbled upon the tip to use coffee grounds as a natural deodoriser.

Now, I keep a small dish of used grounds in the fridge, and it works like magic. It absorbs odours, leaving everything smelling fresh without any chemical sprays. Plus, it’s free, which is a huge bonus!

5. Cleans Stubborn Pots and Pans

Scrubbing burnt-on food from pans used to be my least favourite chore. One day, out of desperation, I grabbed a handful of coffee grounds and used them as a scrub. To my surprise, they worked better than any fancy cleaning product I’ve tried!

The slightly abrasive texture helps lift grime without scratching the surface. Now, whenever I finish my morning brew, I know I’ve got a natural cleaning hack waiting in the wings.

6. Improves Soil Structure

If you’ve ever dealt with heavy, compacted soil, you’ll know how frustrating it is for plants to grow in it. Coffee grounds can work wonders here. When mixed into the soil, they improve drainage and aeration, making it easier for roots to spread out and thrive.

I’ve started using them in my potted plants too, mixing them into the potting soil. The difference has been night and day—my herbs look healthier and grow faster.

7. Attracts Earthworms

At first, I wasn’t thrilled about the idea of more worms in my garden. But after some research, I realised how essential they are for healthy soil. Earthworms love coffee grounds, and as they burrow around, they help aerate the soil and enrich it with nutrients.

Since adding coffee grounds to my garden, I’ve noticed an increase in worm activity. It’s a good sign that my soil is thriving, and honestly, it’s quite fascinating to watch nature do its thing.

A Brew-tiful Discovery

Reusing coffee grounds has been one of the simplest yet most rewarding changes I’ve made at home. It’s such a small step, but the impact it has on my plants, cleaning routine, and even waste reduction is incredible.

So, next time you make a cup of coffee, think twice before tossing those grounds. Whether you sprinkle them in your garden, add them to compost, or use them to scrub a pan, you’ll be amazed at how versatile and useful they are. Who knew my morning pick-me-up could be just as valuable after the last sip?",1,1731667716.0,TinyGardenhome,0,1.0,False
1grtomr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1grtomr/i_overthink_my_gallbladder_is_being_a_problem/,I (over?)think my gallbladder is being a problem child.,"I had a gastric bypass a year ago which I know places me at increased risk for gallbladder issues due to rapid weight loss. I've ate more fatty foods than usual last week because I was visiting an aunt whose diet is higher in fat than mine. Friday she served Polish sausage for lunch and bratwurst for dinner. A couple hours after dinner, I experienced a sudden sharp pain in my upper right quadrant which lasted a minute or so. Then it sort of settled into a moderate crampy pain for a couple of hours and then improved. I came home on Saturday, resumed my usual diet, and have had occasional mild URQ discomfort since then. 

I'm thinking this is probably my gallbladder. The pain is in the right area. It came on after eating rich, fatty foods, and I have a known risk factor for gallbladder disease. (Though I do not have any family history of gallbladder issues). What should I do next? I have a routine follow-up appointment with my bariatric surgeon on December 18th and am supposed to have bloodwork (vitamin levels, cholesterol, liver function, and a1c IIRC) drawn 2-4 weeks before then. My impulse is to send her a mychart message asking if she wants to order any additional labs and/or imaging before that appointment. Does this sound like an appropriate plan? Should I try to be seen sooner? 

Here's a description of my medical history:

I'm 37F with a current BMI of 32.

Active health issues: obesity, depression, insomnia 

Current medications and supplements: Prozac (40mg daily), Abilify (10 mg daily), Bariatric multivitamin with 45mg Fe (daily), Ca Citrate (600mg tid)

Past surgical history: hysteroscopic myomectomy (Dec 2022, only half of the fibroid removed), vaginal hysterectomy with bislap (Jan 2023), gastric bypass with hiatal hernia repair (Nov 2023)

Health issues that I had prior to above surgeries (but are resolved/in remission currently): HTN, HDL, GERD, iron deficiency anemia, heavy menstrual bleeding 

Substance history: alcohol abuse ages 22-29. Current non-drinker for five years. Current coffee drinker (4-6 shots espresso four days a week) Never smoker, never used illegal substances. 

I worry about my liver because of my drinking history, but I've always had good liver function tests results. ",1,1731667661.0,AskDocs,3,1.0,False

For a second, I wonder if I'm going insane. But insane people don't think that they are going insane, right? Everybody knows that. Is it natural to wonder if my existential dread is triggered by reliving a series of stupid mistakes I made when I first stepped into independence and adulthood? Or is it from repeating these same mistakes knowingly and willingly? It makes me wonder if I’m some sort of emotional masochist.

The inability to change myself, combined with anxiety and self-awareness, is a sinister mix and the root of my dread. Sometimes, I wonder if it’s easier to live in denial rather than be self-aware. It’s time to embrace my feelings instead of bottling them up and projecting a tough exterior. Maybe that’s the only way I can break out of this vicious cycle of fear and loathing.

I’m at that phase in life where all my friends have moved on or settled down with family and kids. Being single and pushing 30 is not an ideal place to meet new people or make new friends. I hope to find something real—could be a friend, could be something more. A deeper connection and meaningful conversation. Is that too much to ask for? I really hope not.

I’m on a fitness journey, low-key taking the winter arc seriously, and trying to bring some much-needed discipline into my life. Eating healthy, getting proper sleep, and consistently working out and hitting my goals for the past two months have been keeping me sane. If you’re on a similar journey, let’s keep each other accountable.

I absolutely love banter of all kinds, as long as no feelings are hurt. TV shows, music, and football are my escape from reality. I’m a decent cook and would love to share healthy recipes. I’m weirdly in love with all things black and dark—from my favorite color to how I prefer my coffee, and even the sort of humor I enjoy. If you can relate to me and you’re looking for something similar, let’s connect over DM and take it from there.

Ciao 👋

1grtkk7,https://i.redd.it/or1u01njn11e1.jpeg,Blood test results,"Hi all. Here are my blood results. Australian, 36, Male, 6ft, was 103kg, now 87kg. Been on carnivore/animal based for 10weeks.
Meals have transitioned from lamb steaks, half a roast chicken, salmon, to pretty much fatty scotch fillets/3 star beef mince with a little bit of butter with 2 eggs for each meal, for last 3 weeks. 2 meals a day, 1030am & 530pm. Cooked in Beef tallow. Black coffee with a little bit of butter once a day. 50gm of cheddar for lunch in the last week. No fruits, vegetables, breads, wheats etc.
For the past 3weeks, i have been working out at my home gym 3 times a week, been playing a 45minute full body workout program from youtube and following the video. Been seeing strength increases, and physical changes too.
I cheated on 2 occasions, 4 weeks in, 2weeks later, and none since(the last one was a real what the hell am I doing).
I have a family history of heart disease on mum and dads side but definitely on dads, dad died of complications of a heart attack, 2 of his brothers died from HA or Stroke, his father - open heart surgery, dont have all the details. Not sure of my dads stats but he wasn't a healthy guy by any means.
Background on me before 10weeks ago. Have a history of dieting, being active but also have a history of eating bad and drinking. Average weight would have been 98kg fluctuating up and down. My most recent unhealthy stage before this 10 weeks was just eating irregularly, secret eating, drinking beer almost nightly, no control.
My addictive behaviour has me on board with animal based, but I'm aware this isn't for everyone as I have seen from another post sharing thier results. My goal was to lose weight so I can live a healthy life, ive done the first bit and want work on what i have done, now want to live the 2nd bit. 
Can see my previous 3 results to the left, my current in bold, and the limits on the right. I can see they are different labs, but previous to carnivore are similar even at different labs.
Was wondering everyone's thoughts on the results and the difference over the previous test when I was more than likely just eating like an 'average joe'. Happy to listen to all feedback, direct and to the point is always effective.

Extra info, i didn't tell my dr what I had been eating, he also didnt ask, i wanted to hear what he had to say. His advice was: cut out carbs, sweets, alcohol, exercise more, and take some fish oil tablets and avacodo, all of the things I currently am doing(except the avacado, not eating that at the moment.) Mentioning this to NOT bag him out, but to share his instructions. I'll return in 3-6months after taking stock of the situation and what will work for me.",2,1731667165.0,carnivorediet,5,0.76,False

1grtjwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1grtjwx/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1grtj73,https://i.redd.it/3iojkg31n11e1.jpeg,Help Me Perfect My Aeropress Recipe for Medium Roast Coffee!,"Hi coffee lovers!

I’m experimenting with my Aeropress and need help dialing in a recipe for a medium roast coffee. Here are my details:

	•	Grind size: Medium-fine (between espresso and pour-over).
	•	Equipment: Just a standard Aeropress with filter papers (no Prismo or metal filter).
	•	Preference: I love Americano-style coffee and sometimes enjoy espresso-like strength.

I’ve uploaded a photo of the coffee’s description for reference—it’s medium roast with some interesting tasting notes, slightly acidic.

Would love to hear your go-to recipes for this setup!

Viv camp tries to apply 100% of they brain which was caught by KV but uski baat waha daba diye yeh keh ke "" tu majority ke against kyu ja rha hai"" Okay though because Karan should stand for himself sabke bolne se kya hota hai. 
Chahat- boy she is playing alone so it has pros and cons, but jaisa treat Kara guy was not good tho. Aage kisi ne kar diya to kya bologe? 
Chum- Bhai yaar really disappointed with her attitude towards chahat, just because tum kisi ek ko dabba sakte ho you are going wild on her.
Shilpa- no sympathy man, i despise when she acted like rajmata bada acha hua physical task me sab pata lag gya. 
Viv camp- playing very smart, subtle at times and loud when needed, when bb announced the criteria esha directly said ""rajat is going to win"" she knew he has upper hand in physical task but they supported Shilpa with all force because what they have done to rajat, when they were ""loud"". Viv pacified his tension with him even after task was announced before he was like ""kon baja? Kon baja"". Esha Alice usual faltu ki wannabes, aur yeh esha bar bar bich me kyu aati woh bhi dusre waale ki taraf kisi din pissa gayi to lene ke Dene ho jayenge nibbiyon wali harqat. Avinash is actually good loud etc etc is fine but good but wrong Circle. Viv camp ki ladkiya tabhi dikhti hai jab uncle power hoti baki time they are sides. 
Rajat- Well, I didn't like his cold threat to viv but viv started it, they need to understand he's not actor he openly said he is from streets and what viv did ""kon baja"" thing koi bhi use behas hi karta waise bhi agar koi ek khud ko bhot bada bataye to har Banda use bura hi treat karega because no one is there to massage other's ego or not everyone is Shilpa, also he clearly explained what and why he did to avinash, secondly guy deserved time god, playing with small keeping it good till he wants. Lmao and one of few members for whom kashish and dig works together without any complaints. Coffee wapas nahi deni thi Viv ko. Btw loved that it was Esha who announced rajat as time god 😂 (pic ref 3) 
Digvijay - he's good sharp but it seems like he's targetting Viv camp, though thik hai karna bhi chahiye. But he needs to diversify and be more vocal. He was right to call out rajat but he shouldn't leave him. 
Kashish- slayerr, her guiding chahat was  pookie kashish moment. 
Kv- Bhai itna kya bura lag rha hai, game hai Shilpa being time god would be worse for KV as Shilpa would def pick Viv camp and would sacrifice kv too at times. Atleast rajat ke side is kashish (who is with kv) DGV & Rajat (neutral with kv). And he didn't flinch he did what he thought was right and as Shilpa said to him a night before ""i (Ss) cannot change myself for you (kv)"" why KV would change his view ek tarfa pyar karna hai kya. Chum ne bhi to task ke waqt kV ke pure opposite me rhi thi. 

Rest were good enough to as sides including Shilpa, 2 PPs, bagga, Sara, shrutikha.

I sleep really well now more than before. I wake up feeling refreshed.”

I will say up-front I am not a nutritionist - I don’t know why this works, but it does and there doesn’t seem to be any negative consequences.

It seems to increase the quality of your sleep, so that you need less of it. Quite simple really.

That being said, it’s one of my best productivity hacks. - Just imagine adding an extra 1 to 3 hours to every single day of your life. 300 to 1000+ hours gained every year! That’s almost 137 work days. It’s crazy.

I would advise focusing on the less exciting things first (the things you’ve probably heard a million times before):

* Drink less or eliminate coffee and caffeine.
* Drink less or eliminate alcohol
* Sunlight in the morning.
* Exercise in the morning.
* Sleep and wake up at roughly the same time every day.
* Turn off screens an hour before you sleep. or at least use dark modes and night modes.
* Keep your bed a sleep only zone.
* Have a wind down routine.
* Keep your sleep environment cold, dark and quiet.

Hope this helps! I’ll back with more soon
