1momdsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentists/comments/1momdsc/finally_found_my_golden_goose_for_dentist_websites/,Finally Found My Golden Goose for Dentist Websites,"**For those who don’t know**, I’ve been on this mission to find a dentist website builder that actually feels like it was made for dentists — not just a generic template.  
I even made a post about it a while back (here’s the link if you’re curious: [Want to build a free dentist website?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentists/comments/1mf7c2a/want_to_build_a_free_dentist_website/))

Anyway… after poking around and trying a bunch of suggestions from you guys, I think I finally landed on something( Thank you everyone). It’s called *First Stop Dental* and honestly, it just… works?

It’s free to start (which was my first win), comes with booking stuff already baked in, and the designs actually look like they belong to a dental place,  not a random coffee shop or a tech startup. They even show a list type thing of other dentists’ sites they worked on, which helped me decide.

Not saying it’s for everyone, but it saved me a lot of frustration vs. forcing Squarespace/Wix to look “dentisty.”(That was tough)  Big thanks to everyone who threw ideas my way,  probably saved me from giving up entirely. And a special shoutout to the user who pointed me toward this site — without that, I’d still be stuck. :>

Thanks again to everyone who pitched in on my original post!.",1,1755035969.0,Dentists,1,1.0,False

My mind is a cluttered attic, full of half-finished sentences and dusty memories. I should be writing something profound, something with meaning and structure, but all I can hear is the hum of the refrigerator and the distant siren. The cat is sleeping, a perfect, curled question mark on the windowsill. I wonder what he dreams about. Triumphs over squeaky toys? An endless buffet of tuna?

My coffee is getting cold. The surface shimmers, a dark, still pool reflecting the windowpane. I should get up and reheat it, but the effort seems monumental. This inertia, a heavy blanket. Words are supposed to be my tools, but they feel like slippery fish, darting away the moment I try to catch them.

There’s a small scratch on the wooden desk, a story I don’t know. Was it a pen's slip, or something more dramatic? A miniature battle, a moment of frustration etched into the grain. The sun shifts, and a beam of light illuminates the dust motes dancing in the air. Each one is a tiny, forgotten universe. My own thoughts are like that, floating and ephemeral, here for a second and then gone. I need to catch one, pin it down. But which one? The one about the siren? The one about the cat? The one about the cold coffee?

They all feel equally important, and equally meaningless. The cursor blinks. It's waiting. I’m waiting. We’re all just waiting for something to happen. A thought. A word. A beginning. Anything.

I'm new to Auckland (mid 20s) and have been struggling to make new friends. I saw this group on instagram and thought I'd give it a go! It's called Social Striders and their whole thing is that it's an inclusive social group - and it's actually social!! I ended up leaving with a whole group of new friends - everyone is super friendly and welcoming it was so refreshing. They meet three times a week (stealing this from their strava):  
Tuesdays meet 5:50am, 6am run - at lighthouse cafe, westhaven (free food post run!!)   
Thursdays meet 5:50pm, 6pm run - at the fountain in mission bay (free food post run!!)   
Saturdays meet 9:50am, 10am run - at the bandstand in Cornwall park (most of us stay for coffees afterwards!!) 

They ALSO ALWAYS have a walker!! The girls who run it are great - from what I've seen one runs and one walks they each take a group :)

(I've been to another run club (that starts VERY early to give you guys a hint) and found that one to be quite intimidating and not inclusive at all(even though they say they are), I got left behind.)

Social Striders on the other hand is the best!! I try and go every week - would recommend it 1000 times to anyone wanting new friends or just a social group - especially if you're not from Auckland and struggling to meet people!",1,1755035845.0,u_Cool-Advice2682,0,1.0,False

1momag8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1momag8/i_was_in_my_first_serious_relationship_and_it/,I was in my first serious relationship and it turned toxic in every way imaginable — now I’m stuck missing someone who hurt me badly,"I’m 18(f), and this was my first proper relationship. It started in November and ended in April, but honestly, it feels like it’s been dragging on way longer because of everything that happened after we broke up.

Before we officially got together, we were friends for about a year — messaging back and forth all the time, getting close. So when we started dating, I really believed it was something real, something special. My first love. My first time opening up like that.

But it quickly got toxic. He lied to me, cheated while at university, and manipulated me to the point where I was constantly questioning myself. I always thought I was maybe overreacting or being too dramatic — but looking back, it was a nightmare.

The worst part? Not long after we broke up, I found out I’d had a miscarriage without even knowing I was pregnant. I was dealing with so much physically and emotionally, and instead of being kind or supportive, he made cruel jokes about it. He left me a voicemail about it — a cold, nasty message that still haunts me. It felt like he was blaming me for something I couldn’t control, and it made me feel more alone than ever.

We broke up because he cheated — I accepted it, tried to be mature about it, and blocked him everywhere. But the harassment didn’t stop. Since then, I’ve gotten hundreds of calls from “No Caller ID,” sometimes 30 or 40 in one day. On June 18th, for example, he called me 32 times. It’s relentless.

Even when I block him, he finds new ways to contact me — different numbers, random messages, voicemails, and texts. He keeps saying I’m his “first love,” trying to convince me to meet up or “talk things out.” Last time I gave in and agreed to see him, he kissed me, and then we both agreed not to get back together. I blocked him again after that — for the twelfth time, I think — but the calls and messages keep coming.

It’s not just me he’s obsessed with — he keeps bringing up my 3-year-old sister, who actually adored him when we were together. He uses her as an excuse to try and see me again, asking if we can “recreate old times” like nothing ever happened. That makes me feel so uncomfortable and weird because my sister shouldn’t be dragged into this mess at all.

What’s even weirder is that I was the only one who really introduced him to my family. I’ve met his dog once. I never even met his family properly, but now he says his new girlfriend has already met them, and she’s “the one.” Yet he still harasses me nonstop, calls constantly, sends jealous comments about my new person I’m seeing, and obsesses over photos or videos of us.

During the relationship, things were far from perfect. We never went on a proper date. I was always at my place or around my family, and I barely got to see his side of life. He blamed my gap year for why I didn’t “get” his university life — even though it was only six weeks he was away. When I traveled up to see him once, he told me I couldn’t stay at his dorm, so I made an 8-hour round trip just to sit with him for a few hours. After I left, he went to the pub with friends.

He never stayed over like he promised. I constantly took my sister out in the cold to meet him to go on walks and sit on a bench when I was babysitting just to see him and hour and a half on the bus, but he barely made an effort. He argued with his parents about me because they wanted to meet me, and he said I wasn’t “ready.” Later, he told his parents about me but barely mentioned anything — just said I was on a gap year working in a pub. His mom made a really uncomfortable comment like “what barmaids want is to get pregnant,” which was painful because I was on the pill and trying to be responsible, while his idea of protection was pull and pray.

He went on a lads holiday over New Years with all his single friends who thought he was single too, calling me only a handful of times over nine days. Then he went on another holiday with friends but called me the entire time. Back at university, there were moments that made me uncomfortable — like when a female friend was grinding on him and asking if he fancied her friend, or when he said he went out for coffee with one guy and two girls, which was basically a double date. He said he didn’t lead anyone on, but those girls told me he did.

Arguments were constant. I tried leaning on him for support but he couldn’t or wouldn’t give it. He made jokes about my family problems — like “what if your sister goes into care” — which was cruel, especially since my mum isn’t reliable and I live with my dad. When I tried to explain how he hurt me, he said I was fishing for arguments or being dramatic. It made me feel crazy.

Even when we were together, it was confusing. We basically just had sex and then he left. He called me every night, but it felt like I was the only one making an effort. It was always at my house or with my family. I felt like there wasn’t equal effort or commitment, and I started wondering if something was wrong with me.

And yet… here I am, months later, still missing him sometimes. I hate it. I know I shouldn’t. I’m seeing someone good now, someone who respects me but it’s by no means serious. But the memories — the parts of him that were sweet and kind — still get me.

I feel trapped in this weird space where I’m trying to move on, but he won’t let me. I just want peace, to be left alone to heal, without getting bombarded by calls, messages, and reminders of what was so painful.

Am I crazy for missing him? And did I deserve to be treated this way? I don’t even know if he ever loved me ",1,1755035745.0,BreakUps,0,0.99,False

Unfortunately we work together so I had to see him yesterday and will need to continue to do so on shifts. The reasons we broke up were that he would make negative comments on my body (saying i was built like a rectangle, telling my I had burly biker man arms, or telling me to not forget about washing my beard while showering) even knowing that I have body dis-morphia and depression. On top of that he would try to shame me for not wanting to go on weekend hiking and camping trips, even knowing i have sever breathing issues and burn easily. 

There are a lot of other smaller reasons, but to make a long story short, this isn't the first time we broke up. Last time he would ask to stop by for coffee so he could make it home (we work night shift), which turned into him spending the night because he was too tired. This kept escalating until before I knew it we were back together and he was moved back in. Yesterday during break he asked if he could get coffee and when I said no this time, he kept coming up with reasons I should change my mind, or ways he could still come over. The more I said no the more upset he got. At the end of the shift he yelled at me saying that I had been childish by ignoring him all shift (we were positioned on opposite sides of the work area for one) and he just didn't understand ""why I'm suddenly acting like I hate him."" I'm just trying to not be a doormat this time around and make my boundaries clear. Today we got into another argument because he asked for examples on what he did wrong and refused to actually fully read what I said. I reminded him about the time we were gaming together and watching our own videos, when he asked me what I thought about something his video mentioned. When I asked what it said since I wasn't paying attention to it, he instead went on a five minute long rant about how I don't pay attention to anything that doesn't have to do with me. His reply to that was that he was just trying to engage with me and ask what I thought like the rant never happened.

My little family and I are going on a 2 week cruise and that includes an initial 3 days at sea.

We have done a several cruises before, but this is only the second with our little toddler.

Last time we ran into a bit of an issue with keeping in touch with each other.

For context, little one naps in the day and goes to sleep fairly early in evening. We take it in turns putting them to sleep.

It would be nice for the other parent to go explore or catch a show in the evening. 

Tbh even in the day, just one parent going to get the take away coffee while the other + toddler go to the prominade deck etc.

The problem is we would like to keep in contact with each other, update on if the little one falls asleep ok or where our position on the boat is etc.

We usually write to each other all the time on whatsapp, but the basic internet package for 2 for the 2 weeks is $560.

Are we stuck paying the massive wifi bill or are there alternative options? We literally just want whatsapp or messaging capabilities. Text communication. 

Thanks

Edit: Cunard Queen Anne. Ship does not have an intranet style messaging service sadly.

In the quiet of our Los Angeles penthouse, I logged onto social media, my fingers trembling slightly as they navigated the familiar interface. The digital world seemed to spin around me, faster than ever, as I searched for the comfort of routine. But today, something was amiss. My gaze settled on Cameron's profile, a place where his successes and our shared moments had been cataloged like trophies. My heart lurched painfully as the words 'single' blazed across the screen. Two weeks before our wedding. It felt as though someone had reached into my chest and wrenched my heart free.

I sat there, the world tilting on its axis, as disbelief tightened its grip around my chest. Memories of our nine years together flooded my mind — the late nights spent building dreams, the whispered promises of forever. I had been his anchor, his confidante, his unwavering support. Now, it seemed, I was nothing.

The ping of my phone jolted me from my reverie, a harbinger of worse to come. My eyes scanned the email subject line from Vanessa Clarke, Cameron’s assistant, before I dared to open it. What I found unravelled me completely: ninety-nine photos of Cameron and Vanessa, each one a dagger to my soul. They were intimate, revealing more than just betrayal — they showed a life that had been lived in parallel to ours, one filled with deceit and mockery.

Vanessa's accompanying messages were taunts, vicious and unrelenting, detailing their affair with a cruelty that made my skin crawl. How could he? How could they? I collapsed onto the sofa, feeling the world fracture beneath me, the pieces of my life slipping through my fingers like grains of sand.

Darkness descended as I retreated to the sanctuary of my bedroom, the dim light casting shadows that seemed to whisper the truth I feared — that I had been blind, my loyalty misplaced. As the night stretched on, I searched online with a growing resolve, my fingers typing out words that felt foreign and dangerous: 'disappear,' 'staged death,' 'new identity.'

I found Arthur Finch, an operative at a discreet agency specializing in making people vanish from their own lives, leaving only echoes behind. His reputation for meticulous planning and execution was my lifeline, a way to reclaim my agency from the chaos Cameron had wrought.

I scheduled my disappearance for the day that should have been filled with vows and love, my wedding day. The irony did not escape me — a day meant for beginnings would become the day I ended one life to start another. It was my first step toward taking back control, toward exacting revenge on Cameron and escaping the humiliation that now defined my existence.

As I lay in the quiet darkness, the plans settled into my mind like a balm, soothing the raw edges of betrayal. I imagined Cameron's face when he realized the depth of my resolve, the consequences of his actions. The thought was a small comfort in the sea of pain, a reminder that I was not broken, only bent, ready to forge a new path.

The night stretched on, a backdrop to my unfolding scheme, as I prepared to become someone new, someone unburdened by the chains of a love that had been nothing more than illusion. I would watch him from afar, see the fallout of his choices, knowing he had lost the one person who truly loved him.

And as the first light of dawn crept through the window, I felt a flicker of hope. I would survive this. I would emerge stronger, wiser, and unencumbered by the ghosts of betrayal. Cameron would face the emptiness of his actions, while I would disappear from the narrative he had so callously rewritten.

The stage was set, and soon, I would be the one holding all the cards.

Chapter 2

The sun draped its golden veil over Napa Valley, casting everything in a warm, deceptive glow. Chloe Davis’s wedding was the epitome of elegance, a serene affair nestled between rows of lush vineyards. Yet, amidst the laughter and clinking champagne glasses, my heart was a silent storm.

I stood at the edge of the gathering, watching Cameron from a distance. He was dressed impeccably, playing the role of the charming guest with ease. But my eyes were drawn to Vanessa, who hovered at his side like a shadow. Their proximity was too intimate, too familiar, and with every stolen glance between them, my doubts morphed into a certainty that made my stomach churn.

As the ceremony unfolded, I felt detached, as though the world was happening in a muted bubble and I was merely an observer. Then, the moment came—the bridal bouquet toss, a tradition steeped in hope and future promises. But Cameron, with a smile that never reached his eyes, stepped forward, his hand settling on Vanessa's waist.

He took my engagement ring—a symbol of what I thought was our forever—and slid it onto Vanessa's finger, as though she had been the one meant for it all along. The bouquet followed, tossed with careless abandon, landing perfectly in her grasp as if fate itself had conspired against me.

The shock was visceral. My heart constricted, my breath stilled. It was a public declaration, a cruel proclamation of my displacement. The betrayal was now a spectacle, laid bare for all to witness. I felt my resolve crystallize, the fury within me solidifying into a plan.

I slipped away to a terrace overlooking the sprawling vineyards, the air crisp with the scent of earth and grapes. Here, away from prying eyes, I could feel the tears threatening to spill, but I held them at bay. I promised myself I wouldn't endure this humiliation any longer. I would vanish, leaving behind the shards of my shattered life.

In the distance, laughter and music drifted through the air, mocking my misery. I turned my back on the scene, letting the quiet of the vineyards soothe me, if only for a moment. I knew what I had to do. There was no going back.

Back in Manhattan, the city was a blur of noise and motion, yet I moved through it like a ghost. Vanessa found me in a crowded coffee shop, her presence as unwelcome as the bitter taste of betrayal that lingered in my mouth.

She sat across from me, her eyes gleaming with a triumph that made my skin crawl. ""I'm pregnant,"" she declared, her voice slicing through the din of the café. ""With Cameron's child. It's time you step aside, Isabella.""

The world seemed to pause, the air thickening around us. Her words were a dagger, each syllable twisting deeper. Yet, in that moment of despair, something within me shifted. The betrayal had pushed me past the brink, stripping away any remnants of indecision.

I met her gaze with a calmness that belied the turmoil within. ""You don't need to worry,"" I replied, my voice steady, almost detached. ""You can have him.""

Vanessa's smirk faltered, confusion clouding her features as she realized I wasn't going to fight for what she had already claimed. But she didn’t understand; I was beyond fighting. I was ready to erase every trace of my former life.

As I left the café, the city swallowed me up, a cacophony of sounds and chaos. But I was focused, driven by a singular purpose. I would cut all ties, sever every connection to the life Cameron had tainted. My heart was a fortress, fortified against the pain and ready to embrace the unknown.

The countdown to my disappearance had begun, each tick of the clock bringing me closer to freedom. While Cameron remained oblivious, tangled in his web of deceit, I prepared to disappear—to start anew and leave him to face the void of his own making.

As I walked away, the city lights flickering against the night sky, I felt a strange sense of peace. For the first time, the path ahead was mine alone, unburdened by the shadows of betrayal. And as the light faded, I knew that soon, Cameron would learn the true consequences of his actions.

The stage was set for my departure, and I would watch from afar, knowing he had lost the one person who truly loved him. In that quiet resolve, I felt the stirrings of hope—a promise of new beginnings and the courage to embrace what lay beyond.

Chapter 3

The Brooklyn brownstone stood inconspicuous among its neighbors, weathered brick and wrought-iron railings giving no hint of the secrets exchanged within. I glanced over my shoulder before climbing the steps, my heart hammering against my ribs. This meeting would erase Isabella Martinez from existence.

Arthur Finch opened the door before I could knock, his expression as neutral as his gray suit.

""Ms. Martinez. Right on time."" He ushered me inside, the heavy door closing with a finality that made my breath catch.

The interior was surprisingly ordinary—tasteful antiques, leather-bound books, the soft ticking of a grandfather clock. It looked like a respectable lawyer's office, not the headquarters for orchestrated disappearances.

""Please, sit."" Arthur gestured to a chair across from his desk, then retrieved a leather portfolio. ""I have everything prepared.""

He laid out documents with methodical precision—bank records, identity papers, travel arrangements. My new life, condensed into manila folders.

""Your documentation."" He slid a passport across the polished wood. ""Camille Hayes. Thirty-two. Art consultant. Originally from Chicago, recently relocated to London after your divorce.""

I opened the passport with trembling fingers. The woman in the photo was me, yet somehow not me. Same features, different hair, subtle makeup changes. A stranger wearing my face.

""The resemblance is close enough for documentation, different enough to avoid immediate recognition,"" Arthur explained, noting my expression. ""The digital footprint for Camille has been established over the past year. Social media, credit history, employment records. Nothing flashy, nothing that invites scrutiny.""

I signed where he indicated, my signature transforming with each document—evolving from Isabella Martinez to Camille Hayes. With each stroke of the pen, I felt myself becoming someone else.

""And the... event?"" I couldn't bring myself to say ""my death.""

""All arranged for your wedding day. The body double is a highly sophisticated prop, virtually indistinguishable from a real person upon casual observation. The confusion will be sufficient until you're safely away."" Arthur's clinical tone made it sound like we were discussing a business merger rather than my staged demise.

""Will it hurt him?"" I asked, surprising myself with the question.

Arthur's eyes met mine, the first hint of emotion crossing his features. ""That, Ms. Martinez, depends entirely on how much he cared in the first place.""

I left the brownstone an hour later, Camille Hayes's passport burning in my purse like a live coal.

\* \* \*

That evening, our penthouse felt cavernous in its emptiness. Cameron was in Seattle, courting investors—or perhaps with Vanessa. I no longer knew which of his stories were true.

I sat in his study, the room where he'd built his empire, my laptop casting blue shadows across his mahogany desk. One by one, I closed our joint accounts, transferring my personal savings to the offshore accounts Arthur had established. Each keystroke felt like cutting another cord that had bound me to Cameron.

As the numbers dwindled in our shared accounts and grew in Camille's, I felt a strange calm settle over me. Nine years of my life had been an investment in us, in him. Now I was reclaiming what was mine.

The final transfer completed with an anticlimactic digital ping. I leaned back in Cameron's leather chair, running my fingers along the armrests where his hands had rested countless times. Would he sit here after my ""death,"" grieving the woman he'd already replaced? Would Vanessa comfort him in this very chair?

The thought should have wounded me. Instead, it strengthened my resolve.

\* \* \*

The next morning, I began methodically erasing myself from our home.

I packed my wardrobe first—designer dresses Cameron had insisted I wear to his corporate events, shoes that had pinched my feet but matched his vision of the perfect tech mogul's partner. Each item went into suitcases that would be shipped to a storage facility under Camille's name.

Next came the photos. Us in Bali for our fifth anniversary. The candid shot from his company's launch party, where I'd spent the entire evening ensuring his potential investors were comfortable while he pitched his vision. The framed picture from college—two smiling kids with nothing but dreams and instant ramen.

I removed each one, leaving behind bare walls and empty spaces. The penthouse transformed, becoming a showroom rather than a home—all neutral décor and impersonal touches.

As I placed the last photo in a box, I paused. It was us at Chloe's engagement party last year, Cameron's arm around my waist, both of us laughing at something off-camera. We looked happy. We looked real.

Had it all been a lie? Or had something changed along the way—something I'd missed while I was busy supporting his dreams?

I closed the box, sealing away that question with all the others I would never have answered.

Standing in our hollowed-out penthouse, I realized Cameron might not even notice what was missing until it was too late. He hadn't truly seen me in years.

Which is why I’ve taken up the torch and decided to help Kurt through his issues. 

Ever since we hid Hershel’s decayed corpse, he just hasn’t been the same. 

If I try, I can kind of understand why— it’s not every day you see a dead guy up and vibing— but I’d really thought that he’d be better after his time off. (He just sorta left for a bit, after we found Hershel in the lobby.) 

Maybe it’s not just the Hershel thing. Maybe it’s the long hours and the smells getting to him too. (Or maybe, it’s because we’re over worked and given shit pay.) Either way, the poor guy doesn’t seem to be getting enough sleep. 

He keeps zoning out, and at first it was kinda fun (I was able to get almost all of the pens from the pen cup, plus a few paper clips, into his fro without him so much as twitching!), but after a few too many complaints about charred food from the customers, I had to take him off of grill duty. 

So I’ve started a list of things that have and haven’t made him snap out of it. This is what I’ve tried:

1. A stick— didn’t work. It just sat in front of him on the table he was supposed to be wiping down, and honestly, I don’t think he even noticed it. 

2. Tea— also didn’t work. Same situation as the stick. It just sat on the table in front of him and got cold. 

3. A rock from the parking lot— worked! I tried handing it to him, and he did the thing that people do without realizing when you hand them things. He took it from me, and I think the presence of something in his hand is what snapped him out of it. 

4. A tea bag— I lost the rock, and this was the next best thing. It worked pretty well, and unlike the rock, he held onto it while he cleaned. And he didn’t zone out for a good few hours afterwards. 

And that’s the end of my list so far. I think I’m just gonna keep using the rocks and tea to keep him from zoinking out of reality, but I’m not so sure if it’s a fool proof plan. 

Mrs. Warmly came in and recommended that I give him a bottle of some of the “good stuff” and a cigar, as that was what she used to give her husband whenever he was upset. 

I just gave her what she ordered, and politely informed her that Kurt and I weren’t married, but I’d give it a try. She then payed for her drink and gave me a fist-full of candy , before going on her way. 

The candy tasted like steak, and I ate almost all of them during lunch today. I have no regrets. They were delicious. 

I’ve gotten off topic– other than helping Kurt, I’ve been trying to keep record of the interesting stuff that goes on here. Things can get a bit hectic, and with my squishy little brain, I forget a lot of the stuff that I’d like to tell y’all about. So I’ve been keeping records of it all– mostly on napkins, but  sometimes on receipt paper. 
And it’s been going pretty well, if I say so myself. Because, I’d almost completely forgotten about Skeeter and that group that came in at the ass crack of dawn. But I remembered it when I found my collection of napkins with the records of the events in my pocket!

Skeeter came in first, at around 5:00. 

He’s been doing this for the past few weeks— coming in before the sun comes up, ordering a single cup of black coffee, and badgering us about the local deer population. It’s like a weird little ritual. He does his whole thing and in return, we tell him that we haven’t seen shit and he finishes his coffee and leaves. 

That’s what the owners told us to do via letter. (It’s their main way of communicating with us. They’re not very big fans of technology, but surprisingly, they’re not Amish.) “We’re not, under any circumstances, allowed to say that we’ve seen *any* deer at, near, or around the diner.” We weren’t really told why, but it didn’t seem like too much of an issue. So we just sorta accepted it as like, a general rule. 

Don’t say shit, and things will (probably) be okay.

But lucky for me, I got to see what happens when someone says shit. 

It was a group of four— one girl and three boys. They came in a few seconds after Skeeter and ordered thirteen sunny side specials and one black coffee. 

That’s when it began.

I thought they were fucking with me, but no. They actually wanted me to make them thirteen. Fucking sunny. Side. Specials. 

I feel I should tell y’all what all the “sunny side special” includes:

Four eggs, two waffles, four sausage patties, a side of grits, and a drink of the customer’s choosing. 

Another thing I feel y’all should know: I was the only one there. (Kurt doesn’t usually work the late shifts, and Hershel wasn’t set to come till 10:30.) I had to make thirteen of those by myself and bring them to the table. 

As annoying as that was, though, I can’t say I blame them. Our shit’s cheap, and they looked to be fresh out of highscool. I know that when *I* was just starting out, cheap places were my vibe. (Hell, that’s part of the reason I got this job!)

I’d just finished placing the last plate down and was about to leave their booth, when one of the boys grabbed my wrist. 

He was the scrawnier one of the group and really gave off the whole “nerd” vibe. That’s not to say he wasn’t serving with it. Cause he definitely made it work— glasses and all. He just looked, and don’t judge me on this, weak. But his grip said otherwise. (Seriously, it could put a fucking python to shame!)

So I was mid way through calculating whether or not I could handle him without anything, when the guy next to him quickly pried his hand off of me. 

“Sorry about that. We hit a deer on the way here, and it upset him a bit. A sensitive guy, this one.” He said with a voice that was as smooth as molasses.

 Like, strait up, he’d’ve made a really good podcast host.  The only problem was that he said all of that with this huge fucked up smile. No one wants to see that many teeth in the media. I’m pretty sure you’d get made fun of for that type of shit. It was like looking at a pissed off chimp with the voice of Morgan Freeman. 

But the poor smooth-voiced bastard, unknowingly, fucked up. You see, at the mere mention of the word “deer,” Skeeter was already out of his seat and making his way over. And before I could give the group my condolences, he was there.

“What was that bout deer?” He asked as he pushed his way past me. 

“Oh, hello there. We were just discussing how we hit one on the way here. Did you also–“ The guy started, but was quickly cut off by Skeeter.

“Where.”

“What?”

Skeeter was laser focused on the group as he asked, “Where was the deer?”

I didn’t quite think it was possible, but as the smooth guy responded, his smile somehow got wider. “Just…up the road… Would you like to see?” And without an ounce of hesitation, Skeeter said, “Yes.”

He then proceeded to get up with the group and follow them out of the diner. 
Not too long afterward, I heard a gun go off. Several times. And five minutes later, Skeeter walked back into the diner, slapped a twenty onto the counter, informed me that he “Almost forgot to pay,” and left. 

Now, I know I probably should’ve called the cops, but I had things to do; tables to wipe and dishes to clean. Plus, they barely touched their food, and I had to deal with all that. And, I mean, we *were* told not to mention deer around Skeeter. So that was, like prophecy or something. It was bound to happen. Why waste time right? And hey, maybe it didn’t actually happen. *Maybe* the forty something hours without sleep are getting to me just a bit. Calling the cops would’ve been a waste of time. So it’s okay. It’s *all* okay.

Anyway!

After I got done cleaning their booth and doing the dishes. It got quiet and we didn’t have any customers for a bit. 
So I got to work on the seven AM temperature checks, counted the change in the register, swept a bit— the usual maintenance stuff. It’s boring work, but it’s kinda nice. Like, I get a chance to shut off my brain and turn on the jukebox and let myself go on autopilot. Just, no thoughts, only do. And when I come back to the drivers seat, everything’s done and I get to enjoy a nice, clean-ish space with some nice music! 

Sometimes I find things when I go on autopilot. Usually I have a little locker in the back that I put it in so that when I snap out of it I can go back and look at all of the little treasures I collected. 

This time, it looks like I wound up finding a crumpled up piece of paper and a lot of notes. Most of the notes were in my chicken scratch handwriting, but the paper wasn’t. It had the words “it’s wearing their skin” written clearly in crayon.

 While I’m pretty sure I wrote the notes, I’m not quite sure where the paper came from, (it’s hard to hold onto memories when I’m like that, so I don’t always know where this shit comes from) but there was a little doodle of a stick person crying a dark liquid next to the message.

 It wasn’t half bad, so I used some of the tape and stuck it to the door of the mini fridge. Maybe it’ll make whoever did it a little bit happier.

As for the notes, a lot of them were just basic observations. Like:

7:12 – rain
7:15 – fog getting thick today
7:20 – Wiped down drink machine 
7:26 – Sprayed Tomila, need more Frbreeze
7:31 – Mopped floors and ceiling 

And that was that. When I was done sorting through and throwing away my notes, I completed my little routine and made a fresh batch of coffee.

Then at 8:47, Kurt started his shift, and at 8:49, I went to take the trash out.

I was about three feet from the dumpster, when I got this prickling feeling that something was watching me. 

I took a quick glance at the tree line, and sure enough, there amongst the fog, was a four point buck. It was standing there, staring at me with its weird little eyes.

I thought we got rid of the things for good, but apparently, they’re getting brave again. I’ll have to write the owners another letter and set some more traps, but for now, I’ll just put out some poison. 

At 10:20, Hershel showed up ten minutes early to his shift, absolutely zooted out of his ever loving mind, and out of uniform. His tattoo also wasn’t on his arm anymore. Instead, it was on his hand and the eagle looked more like it was holding two shitty glow sticks instead of cups. You couldn’t even read the words under it. 

Thankfully, he was still able to work the grill and all was okay on that part. 

What wasn’t okay, was that at 12:55, Brennan Stringer came in and sat at the booth next to the jukebox. He ordered some French toast and a cup coffee. 

It sounds tame, but let me tell ya’ll— that guy, is no bueno.

Growing up, there were a ton of rumors. And I know you can’t exactly “listen to rumors” and all that, but trust me, with *this* *guy*, you can. 

Here’s two fun facts about me: 

1. I don’t really know how to eat spaghetti, and

2. I can’t remember a whole lot of my childhood. But what I *can* remember is that at least a few of those “rumors” were true. 

Like the one about him killing Mrs. Larsnich’s pet parakeet. 

I remember sitting there during rest period, Mrs. Larsnich had stepped out for a bit, and Brennan had gotten the bird from its cage in the back of the class. I sat there and *watched* him slowly squeeze it until it stopped moving.

Then there was the one about him putting Corbin Clearweather in the hospital. I saw that fight happen during recess. (We were only in the second grade, but man, he beat the shit out of that kid.)

So when I heard things about Brennan being the last on to leave the boys bathroom after all of the mirrors were “mysteriously” broken or that Brennan was the only one to make it out un-singed when Sheriff Stringer’s house trailer caught fire, I was inclined to believe some stuff. 

The last I’d heard about Brennan was that, after the whole thing with the small forest fire, his dad had sent him off to a boot camp for his senior year. And no one’s seen hide nor hair of the bastard since.

So I had, what I’ve dubbed, my whacking stick close to me the whole time he was in the diner. (I usually keep it in under the counter, but it came from a broken chair that I found near the dumpster. I’m pretty sure it was one of the legs. But it’s easy for me to hold and it helps me deal with the more… difficult customers.) 

At 1:00, Hershel’s shift ended, but he didn’t leave until 1:08. This is because he just hung up his apron and sat with Brennan until he finished his meal, then they left together. 

A family of five came it at 1:20, and informed us that we there was a man doing “provocative dances” outside. I told her that we’d handle it, but we never did. They headed out shortly afterwards and left two quarters as a tip. 

I went to check the mail at 2:00, but quickly came back inside when I noticed that a person in clown mask was standing next to the mailbox. I asked Kurt if he could go and deal with them. He just gave me a weird look and said, “sure.” 

5:00 is when Kurt’s shift ends, so at 4:49 I went to get his old uniform so I could give it to him before he left. (I washed our uniforms from a few nights ago, and I kept forgetting to give his back to him.) But when I came back inside, he wasn’t there. 

I was about to just cram it into his locker and call it a day, but I gave a quick look at the parking lot and saw him out by his car. So I hurried out to him, only to find that he 
A. wasn’t alone and B. was *clearly* in the middle of some sort of…deal with Brennan Stringer.
Brennan noticed me first and ended the interaction. He gave Kurt a small pat on the shoulder as he walked away, and I was able to hear as he said, “Pleasure doin business with you.” 

In the meantime, I stood there with the clean uniform in my arms, unsure of just what the Hell I just came up on, and waited for Kurt to take notice. Which, he eventually did. It just took him a minute. 

He looked surprised to see me but took the uniform when I offered it to him. Then he left. And I took a much needed smoke break. 

So, that’s about all I have for now. I’ve gone through all of the records I’ve kept. I’ll let ya’ll know if anything else happens or if I notice anything interesting. Having said that, take care!",1,1755034952.0,u_Dimensional_Angie,0,1.0,False

Had all the classic ADHD symptoms growing up but only recently did I start wondering if I’m actually AuDHD. Always been bit of a tomboy but over the years I have never had trouble making friends of either sex. I also play hockey etc and generally prefer team sports over individual sports.

What led me to think I’m also autistic is that I’m very into math, have rather sensitive senses, and that I have loads of lone hobbies like drawing/reading. Plus when it comes to things like hiking or traveling (activities that don’t stem from human interaction), I actually massively prefer to do it solo because I just enjoy the peace and spontaneity a bit too much and find being with others distracting/annoying at times. I also have a ton of pet peeves. I live by myself now and when I lived with others in college, certain small things they do (like rearranging the coffee mugs) could drive me nuts despite us get along well socially.

But then it hits me that all of these could of just been habits/coping mechanisms for being an only child. My favorite thing as a toddler was going to the neighborhood playground to hang out with friends, but day to day I spent probably upwards of two hours being around only adults. Also I’m definitely on the neurotic side of things because of pretty intense (Asian) parents and not having a sibling for fun/distraction at home.

My boyfriend and I parked in a shared lot for a small grill and a Dunkin’ Donuts. The signs said parking was for customers only, and we planned to quickly grab something from the grill and then head to Dunkin’. Before we could even walk in, two large men—who appeared to be the grill’s owners—ran outside and told us we couldn’t park there.

We explained that we were going to Dunkin’ right after, but they refused and we complied. As we began to leave, they started shouting at us, calling us “dickheads” and other slurs, telling us to “go back to [our] state,” insulting our car, and continuing with aggressive remarks. Pedestrians stopped and stared because of how hostile they were. Feeling uncomfortable and threatened, we decided to leave the area entirely without getting coffee. They then mocked us, saying we were “too poor” to afford it.

As a minority, the remarks felt targeted. I’ve since noticed many Google reviews describing similar aggressive behavior from these individuals. I want to take action so that others, including myself, can visit the Dunkin’ there without feeling unsafe or harassed.

1moltr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheyBlamedTheBeasts/comments/1moltr0/i_went_to_hell/,I went to hell.,"I died. I thought I lived a pretty decent life but nevertheless I wound up in Hell. Surprisingly, it turns out the Mormons were right all along. So before you get too cocky, just know that if you’ve ever partaken in tea or coffee, you’ll wind up there too.

When I “arrived” I was informed by a demon that a unique punishment had been designed especially for me. I started to envision myself being horribly maimed and tortured, but he led me over to an ornate, ancient looking desk, upon which set a desktop computer. It had one program: Guilty Gear: Strive. I looked at the Demon and he nodded. I booted it up.

“Am I forced onto a specific character?"" I asked.

“The character is chosen”, said the demon.

I saw that I had one character available on the character select screen, my trusty Baiken, mained since I started playing the game circa 2022.

“Am I grinding tower?”

“The opponent has been chosen” said the demon.

Just then another demon sat at an identical chair to the side of me. I was then blindfolded until I heard the sounds of the intro play and then it was removed.

“Begin”.

We got into the match. My eeys were glazed over a bit from the disorienting heat and strange surroudns but as round start roilled in I pressed my trusty far slash and heard the sound of it getting counter hit by a light normal, then it clicked. I was playing against Faust

Baiken is a fairly strong character, with well rounded pokes, strong defensive tools and ways to controlk the opponent's position before gaining offensive with lethal mixups that convert into strong damage, she's a fairly strong if somewhat overlooked pick in the meta due to being somewhat inconsistent and not as rewarding as some of the strongest characters in the game. She struggles a lot against characters that can bully her pokes and punish her slow movement with good zoning.

I played a backdashed away and tried to check any bold moes with an H kabari. My demon opponent crawled under it, causing the chain to whiff, in turn causing the demon to whiff punish me, converting with a wild assault to send me to the corner. I could see the hint of a smile appear on the demon’s face.

I patiently blocked on wakeup, as the demon went for an item toss and out emerged the terrifying sight of mini-faust, I attempted an already irrelevant 2S before minifaust caught me and I was swiftly send through the wall and my hp depleted.

""I am so good at Guilty Gear”, I heard my opponent mutter. It wasn’t long before the game was out of reach and I lost another round, any desperate air approaches batted away with a 6P reaching out to the land above, anda  flurry of items making me somewhat delirious.

“Again”.

We must have played a thousand matches like that. I was keeping it together but I could feel my sanity slipping, until one day, I finally won.

In short, I had a very lucky opening. Successfully 6Ping his 5K on roundstart and forcing out an early burst, I parried a mix mix mix from guard cancel and landed a throw, setting up a vortex of crossup 2D and further throw loops until I won the round.

Then I did it again with a walkback into 5H whiff punish to go through the wall witha  wild assault, into a yzn rc conversion to gain an immense life lead I could recklessly throw myself at the wall and finally get a stray hit to land and win the game.

I expected us to move on to some new and even more exotic punishment, but the demon only said:

“Again”

Not long after, a new technique entered the demon's playbook

= = = = = =

J.2K

= = = = = =

It took me one millisecond to realize this immediately stopped my attempts to bait out poor defensive options to open up an approach in neutral, suddenly he could panic and fly away to an angle baiken struggles to respond to while converting into huge rewards. And that is exactly how I lost the next 10,000 matches. I tried my best with my tatami gaieshi and my pokes, but it was never close. My opponent's side was an impenetrable wall of huge normals, pocket londoners, and floating questionably alive lobotomised doctors. It was a strategy that was both so utterly resolute and beligerent in its linearity. Any advancing move form range or fast disjointed air to air would completely hose them. I thought about the 2H in my toolkit, but alas I could not accessget close enough to not land them, whiffing horribly into another game loss. This was a 7-3 matchup - aka Hell.

= = = =

It was probably our 20,000th game. My opponent had gone hammer spit into scarecrow rc into mini faust into meteors. The demon looked at me from over his leverless.

“Do you concede?”

I surveyed the HUD. I had enogh burst for a defelct shield, 15% HP, and a sliver of tension. It was impossible to win. I was delirious from all the games, I was exhausted. I was helpless. but something snapped in me.

“No”. I said. “Play it out”.

The Demon raised an eyebrow. Meteors resolved and the screen became electric with Fire. Sideswap. Conversion. Whiffed normals. Punish. Whiffed H kabari. Punish. The demon became frenzied.

“I am so good at this GAME!!!” He bellowed

The screen was a blur of shimmery victory screen elements. I watched, and my sanity finally slipped away entirely. “One more game” I slurred. “One… more.. game…”

Centuries passed, Eons passed. The demon's win counter was at 10^(23453466) I was in a stupor until a new sensation entered my awareness. It was a burning smell - but not the typical fire and brimstone burning smell that I had become accustomed to. Was that, burning plastic?

I looked at my monitor. Mini fausts were still flying everywhere, but the screen began to flicker. It felt as if all of hell had gotten a bit darker. I heard an alarm in the distance and I could hear Demons sprinting nearby. Sparks began flying from my computer, and then, an explosion.

= = = =

I woke up on the street to my friend leaning over me.

“Holy shit girl are you okay? That car ran right into you!”

Needless to say I am not okay. But I gave up coffee, and I’m never touching Strive again.

But nope.
It started small. She’d pop up at places we happened to be the coffee shop down the street, the park where we walk the dog. Always “just passing through.” Then I noticed her car driving past our house more often than is humanly necessary for someone who “doesn’t even live nearby.”
Then came the Instagram follows. Not just me, my sister, my coworkers, even my hairdresser. She doesn’t like anything, doesn’t comment, just… watches. Like a hawk with Wi-Fi.
The weirdest part? She’ll post these vague quotes that sound like they’re aimed at me. Stuff like, “Some people only have what you had after you’re done with it.” Girl, relax. You “had” him in 2008 when he wore baggy jeans and thought Axe body spray was cologne.
I’d be lying if I said it didn’t creep me out a little. But the truth? It’s also kind of pathetic. Because while she’s busy plotting her next accidental run-in, I’m here living the life she pretends she’s over, wearing his ring, sipping my coffee.
And if she’s reading this. Hey girl, you can stop circling the block. The view from here is great, but it’s not yours.

1molq1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/1molq1u/increase_zoloft_or_switch/,Increase Zoloft or switch?,"I started Zoloft early February this year so its been about 7 months. I started at 12.5mg for a week, went to 25mg for a few weeks then 50mg then 100mg then 125mg and I’m now at 150mg and have been for almost 2 months. I’m really struggling and I am unsure of what benefits, if any, that I’m getting. I have little interest in doing things beyond lying down, doomscrolling, attempting to read books without quickly losing focus. Although my focus has gotten better(I’m almost finished reading The Dead Zone by Stephen King, it’s great) my motivation remains very low to the point where I realize at the end of the day that I’ve done nothing all day. Passive SI is still there. I am fatigued all day despite getting decent sleep and drinking tons of coffee. I’m diagnosed with MDD w/ psychotic features(delusions about people watching me)and take abilify 15mg for that which is helping a lot. I also take Mirtazapine 30mg and that helps with sleep and maybe depression? I have tried prozac, citalopram, pristiq, rexulti, strattera, benzos, adderall, vyvanse, risperidone, seroquel, and some others i cant remember. I’m considering trying low dose lithium, lamictal, tricyclics, or just increasing zoloft because I don’t want to go through hell coming off it.  Wellbutrin is not an option because I’ve had one seizure last year when i was in rehab(due to a quick benzo taper that I probably didn’t need and was done all wrong). Modafanil is something I’m considering but I’m not sure if my current NP is willing to prescribe due to my history with substance abuse(stimulants and weed). Has anyone seen a big difference when increasing Zoloft from 150 to 200? My appointment with my NP is tomorrow and I really need it to be productive. I need my quality of life and day to day functioning to improve. I’m also diagnosed with Avoidant Personality Disorder. I haven’t really processed what that means for me but I’m sure it affects things. I’m in therapy. ",1,1755034406.0,antidepressants,0,1.0,False
1molp57,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialNightmares/comments/1molp57/the_thirteenth_breath/,The Thirteenth Breath,"They took the room with the slanted window.

It was the strangest detail in the listing—*“charming Vermont farmhouse with a historic witch window”*—tilted like a picture hung slightly wrong, set into the upstairs gable as if the house had shrugged and the frame had never recovered. Eli loved it immediately. Noah called it creepy and then, naturally, booked the place for the long weekend anyway.

They arrived on a cold, clean Friday that happened to be the thirteenth. The host left them a key, a loaf of maple bread wrapped in waxed paper, and a stiff little card of local “house rules” printed in faded type:

>

“New Englanders and their superstitions,” Noah said, flipping the card over for more that wasn’t there. “Do we even have coins?”

Eli found a quarter in the car’s cup holder and set it on the sill like a joke. The window watched it as if it were prey.

He’d chosen the place for the silence. They both needed it. Noah’s phone had become a second mouth: deadlines and emergency pings. Eli’s work was less noisy but no kinder, a quiet gnawing that started with email subject lines and ended with the weight in his chest at 2 a.m. They wanted three days with trees, with the hill smelling like crushed clover, with the sun letting itself be seen.

The farmhouse was wider than it was tall, all long rooms and low beams. The witch window tipped its face toward a stand of birches. The bed beneath it was old and honest. The blankets smelled of line-dried things. They let themselves be ordinary: they drank, they laughed, they kept their socks on until the room learned their names.

Eli traced the tilt of the frame with his eyes. “Witch windows,” he read from his phone. “Supposed to keep witches from flying in because the angle throws them off. Or to haul coffins out when a narrow staircase wouldn’t do. Spooky either way.”

“Good thing we brought no witches and fewer coffins,” Noah said, climbing onto the bed and patting the mattress. “Come here.”

Eli did. They kissed with the kind of softness that comes from practice, then with urgency that has nothing to do with youth and everything to do with survival. It wasn’t performative, or pretty for anyone but the two who knew the code of one another’s hands. Clothing became a slow argument with the air; the air, at last, receded. The night outside dressed itself in crickets.

When it came, it was not a sound but a subtraction: as if the room exhaled something it had been holding back. Eli placed his forehead to Noah’s, catching the rhythm of Noah’s breath to anchor himself. For a moment there were only two of them, and then there wasn’t.

A third breath joined them.

It was not the heating system nor the wind in the chimney. It wasn’t their own echoes thrown back by the near walls. It was the cool measure of another chest, close by, drawing air. Eli’s skin tightened along his ribs. Noah stopped, his eyes opening. They didn’t speak. They listened, not moving, the steady two-and-then-one of it, the cadence of a sleeper.

“Do you hear—” Eli began.

“Yes,” Noah said.

They pulled apart, the bed squeaking, the blankness of the room suddenly loud. The coin on the sill trembled, as though the wood had shifted beneath it.

“Old house,” Noah said, too quickly. He had always been brave for Eli, which meant at times inventing reasons to be. He slipped on his shirt and crossed to the window. “Maybe the frame’s loose.”

Eli touched the glass. Cold. Outside, a low fog had crept up from the hollow by the birches, a white that had too much intention in it. He looked down: their quarter lay flat. A neat circle in a skewed world. The slanted glass offered a dull reflection of the room: bed, door, two men—no, three.

He blinked so hard it hurt. The reflection was a fraction ahead of them, a tick of film out of sync, and in that tick there was a man who leaned over the bed where no one leaned, a pale shoulder and the slope of a neck that wasn’t anyone’s he had ever kissed. Then the reflection caught up and there were only two again.

Noah saw it too. His mouth changed. Neither of them reached for the coin.

They slept, eventually, because even fear acquires a rhythm. Eli woke proofless in the dark and thought of the card. *Count what you bring in. Count what you take out.* He tried to recall how many times they’d gone back to the car, how many trips with bags and bottles. It seemed like an evil math problem: if two men arrive with twelve things and leave with ten, what does the house keep?

By morning, it had names for them.

They noticed it at breakfast. In the kitchen, beneath a fist of dried hops hanging from the beam, a tiny ledger had been thumbtacked to the wall. Maybe they’d missed it; maybe it hadn’t been there. It was the width of Eli’s three fingers, ruled with thirteen neat lines in pencil. On the first line someone had written *bread*. On the sixth, *coin*. On the seventh, *Eli*. On the eighth, *Noah*.

Noah touched the page. The graphite smudged under his skin. “Cute.”

“Take a picture of it,” Eli said. “Maybe the host left it for guests to add everything for fun.” He laughed without humor. “Count what you bring in.”

Noah raised his phone, framed the ledger, and stopped. “That’s weird. There’s no name next to seven or eight on my screen. It’s like—” He swallowed. “It’s like the camera isn’t sure.”

They went hiking to shake it off. The birches lifted their pale arms, and the trail was a ribbon through green. Eli let the rhythm of walking order his head. By the time they returned, the ledger had acquired two more entries: *wine*, *salt*. Their names had moved down a line, now nine and ten. Someone was writing in their house who wasn’t them.

They checked the doors. They were locked. They checked the windows. All latched, all normal, except the one that had never been normal, which sat with its quarter. The coin had turned slightly, as if it wished to show its face.

“You want to leave,” Noah said, making it half question, half sentence.

“What I want is not to be silly,” Eli said, simultaneously wanting to bolt. He hated that his voice could sound reasonable while his hands wanted to be fists. “There’s probably a camera.” He glanced at the bulbs, the smoke detector, the corners where technology hides. “Or this is some host’s ‘immersive weekend’ nonsense.”

Noah took his face in his hands and kissed him, briefly, with a mouth that had learned him. “We’re fine. We’re fine,” he said, which is what people in stories say just before they aren’t. “Tonight we’ll move the bed out from under the window. We’ll leave… what did the card say? A coin for luck.”

“We did,” Eli said.

“Then we’ll leave another.”

They slid the bed on the wooden floor until it sat under the plain square window on the other wall. They stacked three coins on the witch sill like a tiny silver cairn. The ledger acquired two more lines: *three coins*, *bed*.

“What happens when it gets to thirteen?” Eli asked.

“It stops,” Noah said, as if the universe had limits. He laughed without it touching his eyes. “Hey. You hungry? I can make pasta.”

Eli watched him boil water, mince garlic, be ordinary in the face of an undressed strangeness. That was Noah’s strongest talent: stubborn normalcy like a shield. Eli set the table. He poured wine. He tried not to look at the ledger and then looked anyway: it had added *garlic*, *wine*, and then on the twelfth line, there was only a faint beginning of a letter, a spine waiting to be a word.

They ate as if the fork tines were a metronome for calm. They spoke about nothing. They cleaned the dishes. They went upstairs. The room had the blue of late autumn in it and the bare smell of wood. Eli pulled the curtains over both windows. He left the coins visible, because superstition works better when you cooperate.

He did not intend for sex to happen again—fear tightens the body shut—but they were in a bed and the other was there and it had been so long since the world had made them both small enough to fit in a single act. This time it was slower, and their laughter was entirely an act of defiance. “Listen to me,” Noah murmured into his neck, hands tracing the geography he had a right to, and Eli did, attentive to the old music.

The third breath returned like a tide finding the same shore.

It came closer this time. Not near the window but at the angle of the room where the old pine plank met the newer beam, where the house seemed to gnaw at itself. Eli froze with Noah’s fingers still pinning him to the moment. On the wall, the curtain stirred. Air moved in a shape.

He imagined a face, but the imagination felt hardly necessary: a cheek that had never been kissed and desperately wanted to be, a mouth crooked in the way of a boy who’d learned to smile as a shield, eyes that belonged to a family wrung out of its name. None of that was sight; all of it was certainty. He knew that if he turned his head he would catch it direct and something he refused to learn would take root and grow.

“Don’t look,” Noah whispered.

“I won’t,” Eli said, and found he wasn’t sure which of them he meant to protect.

The rhythm took them through it until their own bodies drowned out counting. Afterwards, in the cooling quiet, Noah lay with his head against Eli’s chest, ear pressed to the sound of a heart that had never yet betrayed him. Eli was the one who counted: his breathing, Noah’s, the other. He reached thirteen and kept going, because he didn’t know what stopped things and panic loves rules.

By morning, the ledger was full.

On the thirteenth line, in letters better than his own, someone had written *Noah*. On the line above it, *Eli*. Their names had moved down again. Nothing else had.

“Why twice?” Noah asked, voice paper dry.

“I don’t know,” Eli said. He placed a fingertip under *Noah* as if that would keep it from sliding off the page. The graphite stained him.

The coffee was too bitter to be the house’s fault. They sat at the little kitchen table and refused to admit that they were trying to hear a thirteenth thing—the pause before a sound that would prove the world had edges. It didn’t come.

“I had a dream,” Noah said. He never told dreams; they were nonsense to him. “We were standing in the yard, counting windows. There were too many. The house had more eyes than we did.”

“It’s just a window,” Eli said, and didn’t believe himself. “It’s just a day on a calendar.”

They left that afternoon. They told themselves it was because the weather turned—rain had begun with a purpose—and because the drive back would be easier before night. They put the loaf of maple bread in a bag. They counted their bottles into the recycling. They checked drawers and the porch and under the bed. In the upstairs room, Eli gathered their coins from the sill. When he did, the glass fogged as if someone on the other side had breathed a long patient breath and written nothing in the condensation.

On the drive, Noah sang along to the radio slightly off-key the way he always had. He texted his sister at a stoplight about borrowing a cooler. He was alive in every ordinary way. It should have calmed Eli. It didn’t. The air in the car felt too crowded, like a train after the game had ended, full of bodies not pressing against you but somehow touching you anyway.

They got home. They put their bags in their spots. The apartment greeted them with the leftover warmth things keep, the trick of rooms that make you believe you were never away. Only when Eli reached to hang Noah’s coat, he found it heavier than it should have been—pockets stuffed with something that wasn’t his—maps? paper? He slid a hand in and felt not objects but a texture, as if the pocket had been lined with fine grit.

Noah frowned down at himself. “What are you doing?”

“Did you put—” Eli began, and stopped. Because for a beat that was longer than a beat, he did not know what he’d meant to say. He did not know what Noah had brought. He did not know what they had left behind.

He checked his phone. In his camera roll, a photo of the ledger existed: thirteen lines, *bread*, *coin*, *garlic*, *wine*, and then **nothing** on seven through thirteen. Blank lines like unfilled graves.

He sat at the kitchen table until the light went out on its timer. Noah spoke to him from the doorway, a question about dinner. The question slid off Eli as if he were oiled.

Every horror story promises you a scene with a mirror. Eli resisted for hours before he went to the bathroom and flicked the medicine-cabinet light. His face appeared, tired but the kind of tired you can live with. He expected to see Noah behind him, and did. Noah’s hair stood in an ungovernable wedge. The sight should have made him laugh.

Noah’s reflection lifted a hand a second before the real Noah did, the way a badly dubbed film makes the lips move early.

Eli turned. The real Noah was looking down at his phone, thumb moving.

“Babe?” Noah said, without looking up.

Eli spoke his name and watched the mirror try to pronounce it. The glass swallowed the last letter.

He slept on the couch with the TV on, because late-night animal documentaries can hypnotize fear out of its spine. He woke at exactly 3:13 with the taste of pennies on his tongue, and the television was showing a forest filled with deer whose eyes went silver when the camera found them, and then a sound: a long slow inhalation from the hallway where the shadow of the coat rack cut the light in two. He did not turn his head.

Saturday the fourteenth was tolerable, like a scab forming. On Sunday, friends came for brunch. They asked about the trip, and Eli said *good* and meant the word’s skeleton rather than its flesh. One of them, Ali, filled plates and told a story about a kid at his school, how children believe rules ward off bad luck because the alternative is worse. “We count because we’re afraid,” Ali said. “We’re tally marks pretending to be a person.”

Eli went quiet for too long. Noah’s hand came to his knee under the table. Warm, known. It should have been enough.

That night, in bed, Noah rolled toward him the way he always did and stopped an inch short, as if there were a pane of cool glass between them that he had learned to sleep against. Eli felt his own breath fog that impossible barrier. He waited. In the barely audible space after waiting, a third breath threaded theirs, time knitting itself into a repeating pattern.

“I left the coins,” Eli said into the dark.

Noah’s voice was gentle with confusion. “What coins?”

“The sill,” Eli said. “For luck.”

The room took his word and tucked it away. Eli closed his eyes and counted to thirteen and then up and up, past the number where stories end, into the part where nothing solves and everything continues, that wilderness.

On Monday he received a message from the host asking him to rate his stay. The photo at the top of the listing was different now. The witch window had moved to a slightly new angle; the tilt was closer to right. Below the photo, in small letters, it said: *New rule added: Please remember to leave a coin. Count what you bring in. Count what you take out. Guests who cannot count will be counted.*

He scrolled, heart shaking like a trapped coin. At the bottom, the number of stars you could select went to thirteen.

Eli turned off his phone. He went to the bedroom doorway and watched Noah sleeping, the rise and fall that had been his metronome for years. In the window, faintly, the dark shone like a withheld answer. Eli crossed the room. He pressed his palm to the glass and felt the cold the way a mouth feels absence.

“Take me,” he said—not to any god, not to any story, but to an arithmetic he did not understand. “Count me, not him.”

He didn’t expect anything to answer. The house did not. The mirror did not. The breath at the edge of the room kept time.

He left anyway. He went down to the street in his socks. The night smelled like rain and disguised metal. At the curb, he counted the cars, their windows blank as teeth. He exhaled. The nearest windshield bloomed with fog in a perfect oval, then the next, then the next, thirteen ovules of breath where no one sat behind the wheel.

Eli stood there and understood that the oldest story about Friday the 13th wasn’t about knives or camps or masked men. It was about what happens when you let a number know your name, how it writes you in its book and will not erase you but will erase the space around you until you cannot film your own life without a lag.

He went back inside. He returned to the bed. He lay down beside the man he had chosen every day so far, in rooms that had been fair and unfair. He touched Noah’s shoulder. The glass did not crack. The world did not end. Somewhere far up a hill in Vermont a slanted window looked at a quarter and waited for the next hand.

When Eli’s eyelids slid shut, he heard three breaths, then four, then five, and each was a little like his own. He counted because he was afraid. He kept counting because he loved. He counted until dawn, which is what we call the light that arrives without asking what the house has kept.",1,1755034349.0,ArtificialNightmares,0,1.0,False

1molm4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/lupus/comments/1molm4m/beach_vacation_advice/,Beach Vacation Advice,"OK this will be a somewhat long one. 

About me: I am a Male with Lupus Nephritis Class IV and spill about 2g of protein a day (down from 10). I am on Lupkynis, cellcept, etc. Can't eat wheat or be in the sun too long. I get sick very easily. Have had LN for 10 years. 

  
Every year my in-laws book a beach vacation. They have 4 daughters and I am married to one of them. The other three daughters also are married. We each have 2 kids so 18 people in total in a beach house. My in-laws have been doing these vacations since my wife was a kid. So they absolutely love the beach.

So we typically go down for a week and I can last maybe 3 days without getting sick. My main question is, how the heck do I survive a week in a moldy beach house with tons of germs when I'm down for the count 2-3 days in?

  
Irritation 1: Tons of drinking. Everything is centered around sitting around at the beach or pool either drinking or reading books. This may be a me thing, but before I really got sick I loved to explore and was action based. Every other adult is fine with drinking/reading at the pool or beach all day. I literally play with my kids and that's about it. If I want to do anything action based, I am on my own.

  
Irritation 2: Superficial Conversations. I had I think one meaningful conversation all week with my sister in law and none with my wife. I struggle when conversations are just observations (variations of facts). Like I want to talk about something in depth and have an interesting conversation.

Irritation 3: Food. They usually cook most meals together. I want to adventure out to neat places on vacation. Problem is, when we do go out, I don't really have a say. Where did we go on the third night? To a brewery. Thank goodness they had a salad on the menu, otherwise I would have to find something afterwards. Oh, then they had dessert back at the house, here I am again isolated as I really can't enjoy anything wheat.

  
Irritation 4: They all wake up together, make coffee together, go to the beach together, go to the pool together, make lunch together, go back to the beach/pool together, cook dinner together (most nights). Now I get that's an awesome family dynamic, but I did not grow up like that. I just want to go do something and adventure. I do not want to do everything together, my god is that frustrating for me.

   
Irritation 5: The brother in-laws are just not my type of people. The one cannot make eye contact and looks to the side when he talks to you. Loves to drink all day. The other brother in-law is the Nickelback loving type. I am a car guy and play tennis. How the heck do I continue to strike up conversations with these two and get strange responses or one-word responses. I've mostly given up in-depth or any conversation with them about 2 years ago. I just don't have the energy to put that effort in. I'm too sick to be honest. So this makes for an awkward dynamic on vacation.



Context 1: My wife is great. On these vacations she just doesn't want to have to plan another thing and just be along for the ride. I get it. She does a great job with the kids and just wants to not think about work or have any in-depth conversations to give her brain a break. 

  
Now, you can say I suck or they suck. I know I'm no fun by day 3 and start to get irritated. My head is pounding and I feel like I have the flu. But, not looking for that sort of judgement. Everyone is generally a good person here.



I am looking for a life tip on how I survive these things as my wife loves having a week at the beach with no mental load. Thank you!",0,1755034156.0,lupus,5,0.33,False

I'm really wanting to lose a few pounds I've put on over the years. And am wanting to try IF for the first time.  I was wondering why it seems like the most popular time to eat for fast is in the afternoon. For example an eating from noon to 6pm. I grew up with my grandparents teaching me it isn't good to eat before bed. (I admittingly love eating a big meal before bed, which I assumed was causing my weight gain but idk). I've also always assumed that it was good to eat a good breakfast (full of protein and veggies) to fuel you for the day. Although I eat relatively healthy (only unprocessed foods except cheese, olive, and sourdough bread or chickpea pasta which are technically processed) I'm definitely overweight (165lbs 5'4"") most likely due to snacking, and calories. I started tracking my calories and I'm eating about 3,000 to 4,000 calories a day, so no wonder I've been steadily gaining over the years. Im thinking to do IF with my eating time from 5:30 am (I need milk and cream in my coffee) to 1:30 pm maybe. So I'll have coffee at 5:30 then breakfast at 10, and lunch at 12:00 maybe. What do you think. Should I try this, or is there a good reason why afternoon eating windows are more popular. Also, what tips do you have for motivation. I've heard you won't see results for quite some time, so how do I deal with the hunger. I'm so used to being comfortably full all the time and eating whenever I want. I'm really hoping I can stick to this, I would feel so proud of myself if I could. ",6,1755034028.0,intermittentfasting,12,1.0,False

A McDonalds, on the edge of the woods just outside of Peach Creek

Friday, May 29, 1998 11:30 PM



It is a quiet, calm, peaceful, and serene Friday night at an empty McDonalds parking lot that sat right on the edge of the woods just outside of Peach Creek. However, that silence, peace, and serenity is quickly broken by a reptilian cat-like monster that emerges from the woods. In the McDonalds parking lot, a brunette woman runs from the beast and hides from it in a trash can. From the inside of the trash can, she hears the beast coming closer. It suddenly attacked her hiding spot. Meanwhile, inside the closed McDonalds, a lone employee listening to music on his headphones is cleaning. The woman ran up to the window and begged the man inside to let her in. Thinking she was crazy, he ignored her, and the unsuccessful woman ran back into the parking lot. Initially taking cover under shopping carts and cars, she eventually runs due to them being thrown at her across the parking lot by the monster. The woman flees from the parking lot back into the woods and the creature roars at the edge of the parking lot at her. The intro, opening titles, and theme music rolls.



Peach Creek Metropolitan University

Monday, May 29, 2006, 12:00 PM

8 years later, Dr. Ed and his assistant and friend Edd drive to the Peach Creek Metropolitan University and head inside. As Edd and Ed are heading to their office, one student whom they knew as a childhood friend, Double D follows them into the office. They immediately recognize him, talk a minute, and hug him. The three Eds enter the office. Ed discovers a paper on his desk and throws it in the trash can beside his desk. Double D tells him to take it back out and that it has evidence that Earth’s earliest organisms were taken there by aliens. However, upon hearing this, he threw it back in. After this, Ed shows Double D a fossil of Latimeria, a prehistoric fish called a sarcopterygian. He explains that one Latimeria mysteriously appeared in the Indian Ocean off the coast of South Africa 70 million years after it went extinct from the fossil record in 1938 and that these evolutionary mysterious and puzzles interest him.



Then, Double D showed Ed a newspaper with an article and headline on a giant mysterious beast spotted by a gas station. Noticing his friends obsession with hoaxes and cryptid sightings, he joked that he should get a girlfriend, but Double D told him that they should investigate this sighting further because this creature is real. Ed turns down this offer, but Double D still persists in convincing him bringing up the fact that his deceased wife Helena would have investigated it. This pisses Ed off and claimed that she would have never messed with such a dumb hoax and that she was a no-nonsense serious scientist. About to give up, Double D comes up with one more trick up his sleeve: he mentions that the creature sighting was in the woods, which are not very far from the PMU. This finally works and urges Ed to leave with his two friends and further investigate.



Peach Creek Zoo

12:05 PM

In the herpetarium of the Peach Creek Zoo, which was right on the edge of the woods, zookeeper Marie Kanker is watching two sailfin lizards Carl and Jimmy. She tries to get them to mate as her boss Peter Thompson arrives inside. He becomes concerned when Abby tells him they aren’t mating. Peter and Abby talk outside of the herpetarium, but then Peter’s phone rings and gets a call. Peter dropped his papers, distracted by the phone call, and Marie picked them up. Looking at the papers, she sees that a young boy by the name of Jack Smith is asking for her zoo to collect a strange lizard he has found. Marie finds this interesting and offers to handle it for Peter. After this, the two start discussing a new project for the bug house’s attachment, a study on parasites found in elephant dung.



Woods just outside of Peach Creek

12:30 PM



The Eds drive to the location of the creature sighting at the woods. They discuss what the creature could be. Double D suggested it could be an alien creature that came to Earth. Dr. Ed rolled his eyes in disbelief and annoyance.

Gas station, right on the edge of the woods

12:35 PM



The three come out of the pickup truck and talk to the eyewitness who saw the creature on a security camera a week and a half ago. His name was Tom Thornton and was a security guard who worked at the gas station. A truck was severely destroyed and ripped open by the mysterious beast. Eddy and Double D are awestruck by this and Edd remarked that if this creature was in fact real, it would have had to have been a very large predator. Edd then walked over to the ruined truck and discovers blood and several dead chickens, while Ed is preoccupied by a destroyed fence that fenced off the woods. Asking Edd to explain it, Edd still believes this creature is a hoax. Upon seeing this ruined fence, he becomes less certain about it being a hoax. He goes to the look at the nearby fence crushed and bent open like a frail stick. Double D joins the two looking at the broken fence and then Edd explains that 8 years ago, Ed’s wife, Helena came to this area of the woods investigating a creature sighting and mysteriously disappeared while she was in the woods, and left no trace other than a backpack.



Cul-de-sac, on the edge of the woods

12:45 PM



Meanwhile, in a suburban cul-de-sac neighborhood that sat on the edge of the woods, Marie drives to Jack’s house. She parks her car in the cul-de-sac and is greeted by Jack’s mom, a blonde woman named Jill. In the house, Jack shows Marie his bedroom, full of dinosaur toys, and dinosaur books. Then, he shows her his lizard, whom he named Rex. Marie was fascinated by this and Jack told her he found him in the woods and believed he is a common flying dragon from Southeast Asia. However, as Rex leaps across the room, Marie tells him that it is not a common flying dragon and in fact, does not resemble any known lizard. Because of this, she tells him that he might have discovered a new species. Then, she asks him to take her to the place in the woods where he found Rex.



Woods

1:00 PM



Marie and Jack are walking through the woods to the exact spot of the woods where Jack had found Rex. Marie noticed that Rex was highly unaccustomed to the cold weather in the woods and thus, could not have originally come from there. As they got closer and closer, to the area where Jack found Rex, Jack saw something that caught his attention and called his new friend Marie over to see it: a dead cow sitting in a tree. The two friends then hear distant, but loud roaring from a large, predatory animal. Scared, Jack runs through the woods as Marie attempts to keep up, and suggests that the animal they heard could have been a leopard. Marie of course doubts this as an animal expert and is left behind with Rex after Jack ran further ahead and deeper into the woods.



Wellington Hotel



1:30 PM



In the Wellington Hotel, in another part of the woods, Ed is at the hotel’s bar having a drink and thinking about Helena. Nearby, one of the bar’s patrons, is talking with an uninterested woman who notices Ed. The woman walked up to Ed and introduces herself as May Kanker. The two then recognize each other from when they were kids. She kisses them in front of the other man to convince him that Ed is her boyfriend so he will leave her alone. May tells Ed that she is also there because of the creature sighting and is hoping that Ed can help her by confirming the creature as a hoax. Ed and May discuss the creature at the bar. Being more open-minded about the creature, Ed suggests the creature might just be a wild mountain lion or leopard that escaped from a zoo. Ed tells her that he intends to go back to the place of the last sighting and May agrees to accompany him.



1:40 PM



Outside of the Wellington Hotel, Double D is showing Edd his homemade database on all known extinct vertebrate animals. He built this database when he was a teenager back in high school. Edd is unimpressed by his friend’s geekiness. Ed and May arrive and Double D and Eddy immediately recognize her as one of the Kankers from their childhood adventures in the cul-de-sac back in the 80s. Edd and Double D learn that she became a government official for an organization called the State Office in Peach Creek. The two are convinced that is indeed a government cover-up of the creature sighting and the then, the four hop in the car to drive off and investigate.



Woods

8:50 PM



It is now almost dusk in the woods. Still lost in the woods and searching for Jack, Marie trips, and Rex flies out of her arms, flying through the air above her with his wings. This amazes Marie as Rex flew, before eventually landing in some bushes. Marie followed Rex into the bushes to get him out. Meanwhile, in another nearby part of the woods, Jack is still running, but stops in his tracks as he sees a strange phenomenon in front of him: what appeared to be a portal with many glowing shards hanging and rotating in the air and chirps identical to Rex’s coming from it. Jack’s curiosity gets the better of him and decides to further investigate it. He walks up to it and pokes his head into it, seeing a weird desert landscape of a land lost in time, with a flock of flying lizards that belonged to the same species as Rex flying around. Jack went out of the portal in awe, but heard the roars again, but much, much closer this time. He runs off through the woods and begins calling out for Marie and Rex. Back with Marie and Rex, Marie is moving through the bushes towards Rex, but stop when the two freeze, and hear large, approaching footsteps belonging to a monster. Marie sees the large reptilian dinosaur-like creature with sharp, saber teeth by its reflection in a puddle of water nearby, shocking her in disbelief. The creature stopped sniffed the air around it, then disregarded it, and move on, not sensing or seeing the two that were still in the bushes.



8:55 PM



Ed, Edd, Double D, and May head through the woods, as Ed and May discuss whether or not they will find the creature. Ed told her that Edd has excellent animal-tracking skills and thus will quickly reveal to them whether it is real or not. Edd finds something and calls the others to attention: the same dead cow in the tree that Marie, Rex, and Jack had found earlier. Ed then begins becoming more interested in the creature search. Double D saw that his compass is going haywire and malfunctioning and shows it to Ed.



9:00 PM



Dusk arrived. Jack fled through the woods to a wooden fence and saw his street nearby. Jack accidentally cut his finger and got a splinter in the fence, before he climbed over it, and rushed back to his house, and locked himself in his bedroom. Now safe and calm, he looked at the bleeding cut on his finger. Outside, the large animal that has been roaring arrived and found Jack’s blood left on the leaves by the fence. Back in his room, Jack turned, and noticed that something big, and scary is outside his window. The creature smashed its head through the window and tried to get Jack, as he climbed up onto his bed. When Jack’s bed is pulled with him on it toward the monster’s jaws, Jack tried to fend it off by throwing toys at it. Then, when Jack threw his CD player remote at the beast, it activated his CD player, which then began playing loud music. This music distracted the creature long enough for Jack to climb down his bed and hide from its sight. Unfortunately, the monster noticed Jack, but then, Jack crawled over to his closet, and threw an electric glass disco ball that smashed the creature’s head. This caused the creature to retreat, back off, and flee. Grabbing a toy lightsaber, Jack walked slowly across his trashed room to the hole where his window was and as he looked through it to see that the creature left, his mom is heard arriving, and sees the mess.



Woods

9:30 PM



Back in the woods, Marie was still looking for Rex, but then, all of a sudden, heard something behind her. She turned to look and saw a giant tortoise-like creature. Rex was startled by the behemoth, which then noticed Marie, and panicked. The big beast calmed down as Dr. Ed and the others arrived. As the group all stared at the massive tortoise-like creature, Ed suggested it could be a hybrid or mutant. Marie introduced herself to the team. Struck with awe and wonder, Double D walked up to the creature to examine its body and get a closer look, and came to the conclusion that due to its physical traits, and attribute, it was an anapsid. Double D was thrilled at the discovery of this tortoise-like creature and believed he was right about the creature sighting. He took a picture of the creature with his phone, but this just startled it. May decided that the creature discovery was classified and Double D’s phone away from him. Rex then came out of hiding and walked up to Ed and Edd, who stared in awe at him. May made a call and demanded that someone be sent to the team’s location to deal with the creature.



Jack’s house, cul-de-sac



10:00 PM



Later at Jack’s house, Ed, Marie, and May have returned, and Ed was examining the damage to Jack’s bedroom window while Jack himself and his mom clean the room. Jill did not believe her son and thought that he caused the damage, despite his attempts to tell her about the monster, and said that Marie gave him the “ideas” and followed that she threatened to file a complaint at the zoo. After Ed told Jill that Rex was indeed a common flying dragon, Jack tried to get Marie to tell everyone about the monster predator that chased them in the woods. Marie looked to Ed, then covered it up as merely being fright. After this, Jack then proceeded to tell them about the prehistoric-looking arid desert landscape he saw through the strange portal he saw in the woods and this immediately caught Ed’s attention. When Jack saw that no one else but Ed believed him, he understandably stormed out upset.



10:30 PM



As Ed, Marie, and May leave, May comforts Marie about lying and that keeping what’s happening a secret is what’s best. Ed tells Marie and May that he believes that the tortoise-like creature could not have been the creature that killed the cow in the tree, and Marie confirmed this and that the tortoise-like creature was a herbivore, meaning there is another, more dangerous creature on the loose. Ed then began discussing where these creatures are coming from and Jack’s claims of the prehistoric-looking landscape he saw, and he believed that the answer to this mysterious phenomenon is in the woods, and was found, and discovered by Jack himself.



Woods  


11:00 PM



Meanwhile, back in the woods, Double D, and Edd were still guarding the big tortoise-like creature. Despite Edd claiming he does not have a single idea what they are dealing with Double D was certain the creature is a dinosaur, and was thrilled to have discovered it, whilst examining it’s massive, black, scaly body. The rest of the team then arrived and ran with flashlights, which frightened the creature, and caused it to run away. The team then all chase after the creature to see where it will go to try to escape. As Ed and his team all watched in awe, the startled animal ran to the phenomenon of glowing shards that Jack found and disappeared into it. As May asked where the creature had gone, Ed told her, and the rest of the team that it had returned through the portal to its home.



Woods, just outside of Peach Creek



Tuesday, May 30, 2006, 9:30 AM



The next morning, scientific teams, and soldiers from the State Office have arrived at the phenomenon’s location and secured the perimeter as Double D examined it. Suddenly, a magnetic force from the phenomenon pulled out Double D’s metal pen and sucked it clean out of his hands, and into the phenomenon as Double D, Ed, and May watched in awe, and wonder. Double D realized that this is because the thing was producing a powerful magnetic field, which is in turn why his compass was malfunctioning the day before. Much to Ed’s annoyance, Double D said that he believed that the thing was extraterrestrial and alien in origin, thanks to binge-watching too many sci-fi movies and shows each night. Edd walked over to pay Marie a visit as the State Office secure the perimeter. She was sitting on the ground right next to a large tree. The two discussed their feelings about what happened to them over the night. The two apparently shared the same feelings of fear, exhilaration, wonder, curiosity, and confusion. Marie saw two State Office scientists walk over to Rex and take him away. Concerned for his safety, Edd assured her that they won’t hurt the lizard.



9:40 AM



Ed and May discussed all of the creatures they had so far seen and Ed noted that they all had traits characteristic of prehistoric, long-extinct animals from the Permian period. and thus they are such, and have travelled through time to the modern day from hundreds, and millions of years in the past. Meanwhile, Double D, still standing in front of the portal phenomena, was testing out the strength of it’s magnetic field by letting it pull metal objects in, but the goober then realized that the last one he let pull in was his front door key to his house in the cul-de-sac. Ed and May laughed at his silliness. Things then got more serious when May stopped laughing and told Ed that they have to leave for the city and meet her at the State Office. She then headed off as Ed and Edd looked at the weird phenomenon in front of them. Ed told Edd that he believed that Helena disappeared into it because it would explain all of the circumstances and meet all of the criteria of her disappearance, except for the question of why she did not return.

State Office, Peach Creek

12:40 PM





Three hours later, at the State Office in Peach Creek, May watched Ed, and Marie talk with officials in a guarded room. Another government official, Kevin arrived. He walked into the room and dismissed May’s introduction to discuss the situation with her. Rolf was put in charge of coordinating the government’s response to the situation and was reluctant about May bringing civilians into it, being suspicious of the civilians.



Woods

1:00 PM



Meanwhile, back in the woods, Edd and Double D were looking for signs of the saber-toothed predator they were tracking. Double D began getting allergies from the forest, as Edd focused on tracking the creature, and quickly finds signs of a large creature in the area. Double D told Edd that he felt the need to wait for Ed or the State Office military, but Ed dismissed that, and told him that they are getting closer, and closer to the predator, and that they needed to find it themselves.



1:10 PM



Meanwhile, back at the State Office, Kevin, and Ed, discussed the strange phenomenon, which Ed named an “anomaly”, and Ed followed up with theories as to what it is, and where it came from. Ed believed that based on the creatures and Jack Smith’s description of what he saw through the anomaly that is a portal in time linking to millions of years into the past. Of course, however, Rolf was skeptical about this, and the two began to discuss the potential damage, mayhem, chaos, and havoc that prehistoric creatures which come through the anomaly to the modern day could cause. Having further dismissed Ed’s theories, Kevin rolled his eyes at Ed. Ed expressed his strong dislike for Kevin and his frustration over the fact that he was there in the State Office talking to him instead of doing what he should: investigating the anomaly in the woods, which he believed to be the greatest scientific discovery of all time. Ed furthermore told Kevin that he intended to go into the anomaly into the past to find Helena with or without his or May’s authorization no matter the cost.



Woods



1:30 PM



Meanwhile, back in the woods, Double D, and Edd discussed Marie as they continued to track the prehistoric predator through the woods. Double D asked Edd about his feelings towards Marie and Double D admitted he liked Marie. Edd encouraged Double D to ask her out himself whether or not she reciprocated those feeling towards him. Double D just stood there in the clearing considering Edd’s advice. Edd continued on without him for a moment and Double D quickly ran to catch up after him.



State Office



2:00 PM



Back at the State Office, a group of several scientists were examining, and studying Rex in their lab as Marie, Ed, May, and Kevin watch from the hallway outside. Marie criticized the poking and prodding of Rex in the lab, but Kevin rudely ignored her until Marie mentioned at the last minute that Rex could fly. It was then too late to do anything about it and Rex flew off and out of the lab. As another scientist was about to enter the lab, Rex flew out of the room, and escaped into the building, and flew all over the place. Ed and Kevin stood and admired Rex’s amazing flying skills in awe and amazement. However, Marie and May wasted no time to hang about and quickly ran after Rex to catch him before he got into any more trouble, but were too late, when Rex flew into an elevator. Marie and May took the other elevator up after him. Rex then arrived on a higher floor and flew through several offices, causing panic, and chaos, as Marie and May followed after.



2:05 PM



Having reached the last office in the building, the two Kankers, along with Ed, and Kevin find Rex by an open window about to fly out deeper into the city. In the attempt to coerce him not to leave, Marie offers him a piece of her chocolate bar. Rex began to consider staying, but then refused, and proceeded to fly out of the window, out of the building, and deeper into Peach Creek. The team stood in sadness and missed Rex as soon as he flew out the window. Suddenly, however, Marie’s skill with animals won him over, and the lizard returned to the office room, and flew into Marie’s arms. The team was impressed at her way with animals and then, as Kevin headed off into the other office room, Ed pointed out to him that Rex pooped on the back of his suit while he was flying around. The team all laughed at this hysterically.



Woods



3:00 PM



Back in the woods, Edd, and Double D were still on the search for the prehistoric predator. All of a sudden, Edd found a large footprint from a large animal, and called Double D over to examine it with him. Double D immediately noted upon seeing the footprint that it was bad news, and indicated that they were dealing with something deadly.



State Office



3:05 PM



Meanwhile, back at the State Office, in Kevin’s office, to be more specific, Kevin told Ed, and Double D who he told on the phone, that the results from Rex’s DNA confirmed that Rex was indeed an extinct animal, and due to this, agreed to launch an exploration mission led by Ed through the anomaly. Ed also wanted to take Rex back through the anomaly where he came from to return him to his own time period and his own habitat, to which Kevin also agreed to. However, there was one thing that according to Kevin, Ed needed to sign so that the State Office didn’t receive any lawsuits if Ed didn’t return from his mission through the anomaly.



Woods



3:25 PM



Back in the woods, Double D researched on his homemade database as Edd further examined the footprint they had just found. Double D identified the giant tortoise-like creature the found the night before as a Scutosaurus, an pareiasaur and anapsid reptile from the Late Permian period. He also told Ed that he identified the predator to which the footprint belonged to as a Gorgonops, a type of saber-toothed reptilian synapsid reptile strangely related to mammals called a gorgonopsid, which was a powerful, and deadly animal, also from the Permian. He told Edd that he had to find the Gorgonops fast if it’s still on the loose, which it was. Double D also told Edd that he didn’t want to join him in the search for the Gorgonops as he was more the brains than the brawn. Edd then walked off through the forest on his own to find the gorgonopsid, as Double D continued to sit on the ground looking at his database.



School



3:30 PM



5 minutes later, at a nearby school that was just next to the forest edge, Jack was in his classroom having after-school detention with his teacher. The Gorgonops was outside, stalking the woods that surrounded the school. Suddenly, it noticed the school, and snuck over to it. A minute later, Edd was in the same patch of woods the gorgonopsid saw the school in, and was getting closer to the creature. He continued his search for the predator, but suddenly heard it’s loud roars coming from nearby.



School

3:35 PM



Inside the school, in Jack’s classroom, Jack’s teacher walked over to Jack, and saw he was still doing his work he missed. Jack encouraged him to finish his work. Jack nodded and said he would be quicker about it, but suddenly saw the Gorgonops pass by outside the classroom window. Jack told his teacher what he just saw outside the window, but the Gorgonops had already passed by, and she didn’t believe him. The Gorgonops then found its way into the school and broke in, and began to stalk the hallways. It stopped for a moment when a student’s drawing of a dinosaur caught it’s eye. Meanwhile, Jack was still trying to unsuccessfully warn his unconvinced teacher of the gorgonopsid. Back in the hallway, the Gorgonops heard them talking, and rampaged to the classroom, knocking over various items. In the classroom, the teacher did hear something, and was about to open the door to investigate. Jack warned her not to open it, but she didn’t listen, and saw the Gorgonops standing in front of her.



3:41 PM



In shock, the teacher finally believed her student, and screamed. She locked herself and Jack in the classroom from the gorgonopsid and began to barricade the door, as the prehistoric predator tried to break it down. Edd had arrived in the school and distracted the Gorgonops from Jack, and his teacher by throwing a chair at it. This got it’s attention and Edd ran from the Gorgonops. The Gorgonops then pursued and chased Edd through the school hallways. To slow it down, Edd knocked over boxes behind him, and he then ran downstairs to the ground-level floor. Edd ran to the fire exit with the Gorgonops still in pursuit of him, but unfortunately, the fire exit was locked. Cornered by the gorgonopsid, Edd resorted to spraying it with a fire extinguisher, which aggravated it even further. The angry gorgonopsid charged at Edd and threw him into the fire exit doors in the attempt to kill him. This knocked Edd out and the Gorgonops then headed out, roared, and left. Edd lied on the grass unconscious and the Gorgonops ran back into the woods.



Woods-Permian hills anomaly site



6:15 PM



Almost 3 hours later, the team had arrived back to the anomaly site in the woods. Double D was unsuccessfully trying to call Edd, to no result. Dr. Ed was getting ready for his mission through the anomaly and May told him that she wanted him back in no less than two hours. She then introduced him to a Gulf War veteran soldier named Captain Jonny 2×4. She explained that Jonny without argument, would be going through the anomaly with Ed to protect him of any danger on the anomaly’s other side. Marie walked over to Ed and gave Rex to him. She asked him to be careful and keep Rex safe. May took Jonny behind a nearby tree to talk to him in private, instructing him to bring Ed back at all costs. Ready for the mission, Jonny, and Ed, who was carrying Rex head towards the anomaly as everyone watches, and the two with Rex walked into the anomaly. They came out into the same Permian desert that Jack saw yesterday. The two stood in awe at the prehistoric world around them, seeing flocks of Coelurosauravus(Rex’s species) and a herd of Scutosaurus. After this, Ed looked back at the anomaly.



Woods-Permian hills anomaly site



Tuesday, May 30, 2006, 6:20 PM



Meanwhile, back in the modern day, Double D whipped up his personal pad to take notes of what he had seen, and followed by getting out his metal pen he had with him. However, the anomaly’s magnetic field didn’t pull it out of his hands. This meant that the anomaly was weaking and would close soon. Double D immediately realized this and quickly told the others.



Permian hills, Arkhangelsk, Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia



Changsinghian stage of the Late Permian, 252 million years ago



Back on the other side of the anomaly, in the Permian, Ed, and Jonny stared around at the Permian desert that would become Russia. All of this hot desert and rocky hills would become the freezing cold Russian forests and mountains. The two travelers in a lost land what become the Russian city of Arkhangelsk saw flocks of Coelurosauravus and herds of Scutosaurus. Fascinated by this lost world, Ed asked Jonny to give him an hour alone to explore the landscape. Reluctant to let him, Jonny agreed, and reminded him he had a radio to keep in touch with him. Ed climbed up atop a large, rocky hill. Staring at the rocky, deserty, volcanic landscape, he called out for Helena. Rex flew out of his arms and saw a large flock of his own species, Coelurosauravus, and a large herd of Scutosaurus, which Ed also saw. Jonny then came up the hill and called to Ed to show him something that he had found nearby. He took Ed to a nearby tree where they found the decayed remains of an old camp that didn’t fit in with the time period.











Mysterious campsite



Almost 2 hours later

At the camp, They found modern, 21st century food like fruit and chocolate bars, meaning that other people traveled onto the other side of the anomaly before them. Whilst investigating the camp with Ed, Jonny found a camera case buried in the dirt and handed it to Ed. Ed read the name imprinted on it which was “Helena”. Jonny thought that a skeleton they had found belonged to Helena, but Ed examined, discovering it was actually the skeleton of a man who had traveled with her. Jonny 2×4 looked at his watch and realized their time was up and that their 2 hours had passed. He told him they needed to return back to the present, but Ed refused, and told him he wanted to stay in Permian Russia to find Helena. After he refused to return with him, Jonny resorted to use force. He came up behind Ed and knocked him out with a heavy blow from the butt-end of his handgun. Jonny 2×4 carried the unconscious Ed back across the Permian desert all the way to the anomaly that led to the 21st century. However, this wasn’t going to be as easy as he thought.



A short moment later



Ed surprisingly recovered quite quickly and got into a fight with Jonny. He punched Jonny and Jonny punched back at him. Jonny quickly ended the fight and obviously as a soldier, and a captain won. After his victory, Jonny saw that the anomaly was flickering, meaning that it was weakening, and about to close, threatening to trap them there in the Permian. He tried to get Ed to get up off the ground and go back through with him. Despite the fact that it would leave him trapped in the past, Ed still wanted to stay there to find Helena, but Jonny refused to leave without him, so when Ed was still reluctant to leave to go back to the 21st century, Jonny decided to stay in the Permian with him. However, this eventually made Ed want to go back as he found it stupid to allow someone else to also become trapped in the past. Thinking it over, he finally agreed to return to the present. The two then took Helena’s camera case and ran back through the closing anomaly that led to the present.



Woods-Permian hills anomaly site



Tuesday, May 30, 2006, 8:20 PM



It was dark in the woods near Peach Creek. It was now nighttime in the big, dark, forest. The team was wondering what had happened to the two men they had sent through the anomaly. Ed and Captain Jonny 2×4 ran through the anomaly and returned to the present, much to everyone’s surprise. Everyone rushed to check on the two, all except Marie, who noticed Rex the Coelurosauravus hiding behind a tree, which meant he chose to come back through the anomaly to stay with his best friend, Marie. The anomaly then closed, which left Rex trapped in the present. Marie walked over to Rex and picked him up to carry him in her warm, protective arms. Meanwhile, the rest of the team were asking Ed about the other side of the anomaly and were relieved he came back in time before the anomaly closed. However, little did the team know they were watched by the Gorgonops that was still in the forest.



8:25 PM



Marie was about to hide and take Rex, when all of a sudden the Gorgonops suddenly charges at the team’s camp. It had launched a frenzied attack on the team and caused panic and mayhem. It killed one of Captain Jonny’s soldiers by headbutting and ramming into him. As everyone ran deeper into the woods to escape the ravenous creature, May tripped, and fell onto the ground. Ed ran to save her, but suddenly, the Gorgonops saw the defenseless two, and closed in on them, about to become it’s next prey. However, before it could get them, Edd, who had survived the Gorgonops attack at the school, arrived in the PCMU’s university pickup truck, and distracted the Gorgonops from May, and Ed by honking the truck’s horn. The Gorgonops charged at the vehicle, which slammed into it, and seemingly killed it. The hero got out of the pickup and went over to Ed, and May to see if they were okay. However, the Gorgonops was still alive, and woke up. Ed quickly threw a rifle over to Edd as the creature closed in on them menacingly, and Edd shot at the Gorgonops. He opened fire on it and shot it continuously. The wounded creature then collapsed and died. The team then sighed in relief as they just survived a dangerous creature attack.



State Office, Peach Creek



Wednesday, May 31, 2006, 9:30 AM



Meanwhile, the next morning, back at the State Office in Peach Creek, Kevin was showing Ed the developed pictures from Helena’s camera that Ed had brought back from the Permian. All of the pictures were of Helena in the Permian desert. Kevin was convinced that Helena was dead and followed with a discussion on the remains of the ruined camp Ed, and Jonny had found in the Permian. Kevin was concerned that someone had been to the Permian through the anomaly before them, but was still relieved that he believed the anomaly crisis was over. Ed, on the other hand, did not agree with Kevin, and told him that they don’t know what caused the anomaly or whether or not this was the first one to ever open. Ed also assured Kevin that the anomalies were far from over and then headed out of the office room with Edd, Double D, and Marie, who were outside waiting for him.



Peach Creek Metropolitan University



9:30 PM



It was nighttime on the campus of PCMU. That night at uni, it was quiet, and peaceful, and Ed was alone sitting in his office, thinking to himself about Helena. Ed then got up from his desk and his chair and went to get a cup of coffee. Suddenly, a shadow moved in his office while he was away. Ed saw the shadow and returned to his office to find a living ammonite on his desk. Ed then heard someone outside and rushed out the door only to see Helena standing on a street lit up by a street light, and looking at him by the university. Ed tried to run to her, but saw that she was already gone. He is left thinking to himself what this meant.



Next time on Ed, Edd N Eddy Primeval…..



Ed investigates the invasion of giant spiders in the sewers under Peach Creek and soon finds himself confronted by a creepy-crawly far more ferocious: the 8ft Arthropleura, a giant, prehistoric relative of the millipede. Edd tries to save his old friend but is attacked in the process and has a vision of Helena, who delivers a message intended for her husband. Meanwhile, Marie is unimpressed by Double D’s romantic overttures.



Season 1 Episode 2 Coming Soon. I own nothing except for this fanmade work. Ed, Edd N Eddy belongs to Cartoon Network and AKA Cartoon and Primeval belongs to Impossible Pictures, ITV, and BBC.

A banshee alarm clock's wail sliced through Mo's consciousness, its otherworldly shriek turning her peaceful sleep into shredded silk. She yanked her pillow over her head with a groan that came from the depths of her soul.

""Make it stop,"" she groaned into her pillow. ""Even the eternal void sounds better than morning classes at villain school.""

Mo stumbled into the shared hall, where a writhing mass of midnight shadows twisted and coalesced into Nyx's form. Their smoke-like hair danced upward in tendrils, defying not just gravity but any semblance of what Mo had considered ordinary in the past few years.

The dorm they'd somehow managed to secure despite the registrar's protests was a bizarre blend of luxury and menace. Two bedroom doors flanked the shared living space—Mo's carved with twisting vines that occasionally bloomed toxic-looking flowers, Nyx's decorated with shifting runes that rearranged themselves into different demonic prophecies each day. Between them stretched an unexpectedly comfortable common area: plush velvet couches positioned before a fireplace where flames burned in unnatural colors, bookshelves lined with grimoires that whispered their contents when you passed too closely, and a study table that helpfully adjusted its height depending on who sat at it.

The ceiling was the most unsettling feature—a perfect replica of the night sky that shifted with actual constellations, occasionally revealing glimpses of realms beyond their own when certain stars aligned. Mo had already caught herself staring at it more than once, mesmerized despite herself by celestial patterns that seemed to form and dissolve like fragmented memories.

""You say that,"" Nyx replied, their voice resonating with multiple harmonics, ""but dying is just so pedestrian. Besides, traditional death doesn't really apply to most students here anyway. Does it apply to you?"" Mo looked at Nyx intently. ""Yeah, I thought so.""

Mo squinted at the gothic architecture of their dorm suite, still disoriented by the permanent twilight that seemed to envelop Umbra Academy regardless of the actual time of day.

""What in the seven hells was *that*?"" she asked. ""I was prepared for stupid villainous monologues when I portaled here. But not for *that*!""

""Ah… The buzzer?"" asked Nyx. ""Just a souvenir from my cousins. It did its job, didn't it? We are ready for our first class. Well… almost… I need some coffee! ""

That simple comment hit Mo like a bucket of icy water, freezing her from the inside out. Homesickness crashed over her—the phantom scent of freshly ground coffee and crisp new pages, the memory of customers who smiled without plotting your demise. Her sanctuary, stolen away. Just days ago, that had been her reality. Now, that sanctuary felt like a dream slipping through her fingers with every passing hour in this nightmare school.

""I spent two years waking up to sunlight streaming through my apartment window,"" she said, staring longingly at the stained-glass windows that depicted various methods of torture. ""Now I'm back to..."" she gestured vaguely at the room, ""...this.""

Moving back to their bedroom, Nyx shifted again, their form compressing slightly as they rummaged through a wardrobe filled with clothing that seemed to move on its own. ""You could have stayed in your little human bookshop forever if that's what you wanted.""

Mo's fingers twisted into her tangled ginger hair—her nervous tell betraying her. ""You know it wasn't that simple. Not with my parents missing.""

""Nothing ever is simple for the great Nightshade lineage, is it?"" Nyx's tone was deliberately provocative as if inviting Mo to spill the beans, but their eyes—currently resembling burning coals—avoided Mo's gaze.

""Let's not,"" Mo said quietly, pulling herself out of bed and grabbing the least villainous outfit she could find—black jeans and a faded t-shirt from a human band that would horrify most of the faculty just because the band had the word 'Demon' in its name. Such a cultural appropriation.

""Same agreement as yesterday,"" Mo cut in, raising her hand. ""Your family trauma stays your business, my dark inheritance stays mine. Deal?""

Nyx's form rippled slightly—a tell Mo had already learned signaled discomfort. ""Fine by me. The past is boring anyway. So predictable."" They pulled on an outfit that seemed to be made primarily of buckles and smoke. ""Today is for making new, more interesting mistakes.""

Mo snorted, pulling her hair into a messy bun. ""I think enrolling here was mistake enough for one lifetime."" She grabbed her schedule from the nightstand and groaned. ""First class is 'Villainous Monologuing 101.' Please tell me that's a joke.""

""With Professor Mortis? Absolutely not."" Nyx's mouth split into a grin that was literally too wide for their face. ""He's been perfecting his own monologues since before the first human empire fell.""

*This is real*, Mo thought, the weight of her family name pressing down on her shoulders. *This is my legacy. Not cozy reading nooks and the smell of old books, but... this.*

""You coming?"" Nyx stood by the door, their form now fully solidified and ready for the day.

 

\*\*\*

 

Mo followed Nyx into the corridor, trying to memorize their route—a futile effort at Umbra Academy. Yesterday, the hallway had stretched for nearly a quarter mile before branching; today, it split into three paths after just twenty paces. Portraits that had hung on the left wall now adorned the right, watching with painted eyes that tracked their movements.

""Does the school... rearrange itself?"" Mo asked, hurrying to keep up with Nyx, who navigated the shifting layout with practiced ease.

""Only when it's bored,"" Nyx replied, casually sidestepping a patch of floor that briefly turned transparent, revealing an abyss of swirling mist below. ""Or when it wants to make a point. The Necromancy Department was late to a faculty meeting last month, so their entire wing relocated to the dungeons for a week."" They gestured toward a staircase that definitely hadn't been there moments before. ""This way. The staircases may move, but they're generally more reliable than the hallways. They have a sense of direction, at least.""

""You're suspiciously chipper about all this,"" Mo said, eyeing them sideways.

Nyx's smile stretched to their ears. ""Because it's absolutely ridiculous. Have you read the syllabus?"" They pulled out a scroll that unfurled dramatically to the floor. ""Week three: 'The Art of the Villainous Pause.' Week five: 'When to Reveal Your Master Plan (and When Not To).'""

""And you're... happy about this?""

""Happy? I'm ecstatic."" Nyx shifted form slightly, adding dramatic shoulder spikes that nearly impaled a passing student. ""Sorry!"" they called, not sounding sorry at all. ""Do you know how many stuffy Titanborns I can mock with a properly executed villain monologue? This is professional-grade ammunition against every elder who ever told me to 'just pick a form and stick with it.' Not to mention…"" Nyx wiggled their insane eyebrows and loudly whispered into Mo's ear. ""*Our plan!*""

Mo frowned. ""So you're... weaponizing the curriculum? And what plan? We don't have any plan! At least yet. The only thing I plan is to survive this school year and try to figure the way out without having the Council decline my inheritance.""

She covered her face with her hands and nervously laughed. ""I don't even know why I bother. I never wanted this fate!"" Her voice cracked, a mixture of frustration and resignation echoing from the walls of the narrow corridor.

""Precisely!"" Nyx's eyes flashed with multiple colors. ""But I thought you didn't want to talk about it. Never mind! Even if you do, I won't! And if they forced me into this ridiculous school, I might as well become exceptionally good at being bad. Or mad. On my terms.""

As they neared the Monologuing classroom, the student traffic thickened. A trio of wraith-students drifted through the solid stone wall, their translucent forms trailing wisps of ectoplasm. Nearby, a group of junior necromancers huddled over a chattering skull, frantically comparing notes while their animated bone familiars scurried around their ankles like macabre pets.

Mo stepped quickly aside as a dryad hurried past, trailing autumn leaves despite the absence of seasons within Umbra's walls. Two vampire upperclassmen glided by with imperious expressions, their skin so pale it seemed to glow against their immaculate uniforms.

""Get a look at the blood-bags,"" Nyx whispered, nodding toward a cluster of demon nobility hovering—literally floating six inches above the floor—near the classroom entrance. ""Too precious to let their feet touch stone walked on by commoners.""

One of them, a horned figure wearing more jewelry than seemed practical for an educational setting, caught Nyx's glance and sneered. ""Obscuris. Still... fluctuating, I see. How disappointing for your family.""

Nyx's form rippled dangerously, fingers momentarily lengthening into claws before they forced a too-wide smile. ""Bloodworth. Still pretending your great-grandfather didn't marry a swamp hag? The webbing between your fingers is showing.""

The demon's hand immediately clenched into a fist, hiding his fingers as his companions exchanged glances.

The classroom door loomed ahead—a massive slab of ancient wood carved with scenes of historic villain speeches. As they approached, the carved figures began moving, silently mouthing famous villain quotes.

""That is... deeply unsettling,"" Mo muttered.

""That's Professor Mortis for you. I had the honor of attending his lecture at Crowhurst High. It. Was. Pure madness! He's been perfecting the art of unsettling for approximately four thousand years."" Nyx straightened their spine, adding at least three inches to their height. ""Time to shine, roomie.""

The door swung open on its own, revealing a cavernous amphitheater. In the center stood a withered figure draped in midnight robes, gesturing with skeletal hands as students settled into their seats.

 

\*\*\*

 

Professor Mortis hovered with menacing precision inches above the floor as if even gravity knew better than to lay claim to him without permission. His midnight robes billowed outward in impossible directions, defying physics in a way that made Mo's eyes hurt. Beneath his hood, a skeletal face leered at the class, twin orbs of blue flame flickering where eyes should be, somehow conveying both ancient wisdom and contemptuous amusement at their mortal limitations.

""Monologuing,"" he announced, the word reverberating throughout the chamber, ""is not merely an indulgence, but the very cornerstone of a villainous identity, the defining essence of those who embrace the shadows. It is in these carefully crafted soliloquies, these dramatic declarations, that the true art of villainy is revealed, elevating you above the ordinary and into the realm of the unforgettable. Without the eloquent articulation of your grand intentions, the meticulous airing of your grievances, and the vivid proclamation of your inevitable triumph, what truly distinguishes you from a mere common thug?""

Mo slid down further in her seat, pulling her hoodie tighter around her face. ""Basic decency?"" she muttered.

""Your victims deserve to understand the intricate reasons behind being subjected to your unparalleled brilliance,"" the professor continued, conjuring ghostly images of famous villains mid-monologue. ""They should be able to grasp the complex web of circumstances that have led to their current predicament. Your enemies, on the other hand, must fully comprehend the vast scope and depth of their impending defeat, recognizing every strategic maneuver and tactical advantage you hold. And most importantly,"" his flaming gaze swept the room, ""the annals of history demand your eloquent words to ignite a spark of inspiration in the minds of the next generation, guiding them with the lessons and wisdom distilled from your experiences.""

Nyx was frantically scribbling notes, their obsidian skin pulsating with excited patterns. ""This is magnificent,"" they whispered. ""Did you hear that bit about 'inevitable triumph'? Pure poetry.""

""Pure delusion,"" Mo replied but kept her voice low. Something about Professor Mortis suggested interruptions wouldn't end well.

The professor raised a bony finger, and twelve ornate floor-length mirrors materialized around the classroom.

""Today, each of you will embark on the challenge of crafting a compelling monologue that articulates why you are worthy of ruling, destroying, or otherwise dominating your chosen realm,"" his lipless mouth somehow formed a smile. ""You will stand before these enchanted mirrors, their surfaces shimmering with an ethereal glow, as they listen intently to your performance. With eyes that seem to peer into your very soul, these mirrors will offer critiques as sharp and unrelenting as a winter's chill. For centuries, they have been imbibing the essence of theater critics, their glassy depths teeming with the accumulated wisdom and harshness of countless reviews. Prepare yourself, for their judgment will be as impartial as it is merciless.""

Mo's stomach dropped. ""Public speaking and public humiliation. My two favorite things.""

""Pairs will be assigned,"" Professor Mortis continued. ""One to perform, one to witness. Your grade depends on improvement, not initial talent.""

Names began appearing in fiery script beside each mirror. Mo scanned for hers, praying to be paired with Nyx. At least they'd make it entertaining. Instead, she found her name glowing next to ""Lucian Frostbrook.""

""Who the hell is Lucian Frostbrook?"" she whispered.

""Heir to the Frostbrook dynasty,"" Nyx replied, already gathering their things. ""Ice demons. Absolutely ruthless. Rumor has it they once froze an entire kingdom just because the prince didn't compliment the queen's new crown.""

""Great,"" Mo sighed, trudging toward her assigned mirror. ""Just great.""

""Oh, and heads up,"" Nyx called after her. ""You got Lady Waxworth. She once made the Duchess of Eternal Midnight cry for three days straight after critiquing her villain laugh. Psychology Department had to intervene.""

Mo turned back in alarm, but Nyx had already sauntered toward their own mirror, whistling cheerfully.

As she approached, the mirror's surface rippled like disturbed water. Her reflection distorted—stretching, compressing, and finally shattering completely—before reforming into a severe-looking woman with steel-gray hair pulled into a punishing bun, lips pursed so tightly they'd turned white, and a monocle that somehow managed to look judgmental on its own.

""Well?"" the mirror sniffed, her voice dripping with centuries of theatrical disdain. ""I haven't got eternity."" Her eyes flicked toward Professor Mortis. ""Only he does."" The monocle glinted maliciously. ""And neither of us is getting any younger waiting for you to begin.""

""I'm waiting for my partner,"" Mo said, crossing her arms defensively.

""Excuses already? Not promising."" The mirror's reflection tapped its foot impatiently.

A quiet voice spoke from behind her. ""I believe I'm your partner. Lucian Frostbrook.""

Mo turned to find herself facing a slender figure with pale blue skin and hair like fresh snow. Tiny ice crystals formed in the air around him as he offered an apologetic smile.

""Sorry to keep you waiting,"" he said softly. ""I was, um, hoping to avoid this class entirely.""

For once, Mo felt an instant kinship with someone at this bizarre school.

""Join the club,"" she replied. ""I'm Mo—Morgana Nightshade.""

""Nightshade?"" His eyebrows rose slightly. ""I've heard of your family. Impressive lineage.""

""Yeah, well."" Mo shrugged. ""Don't believe everything you hear.""

""Enough pleasantries!"" the mirror barked. ""One of you, begin your monologue. Convince me you're worthy of fear and respect, or I shall eviscerate your performance with such cutting remarks that your great-grandchildren will feel the sting.""

 

\*\*\*

 

After earning a grudging 'Passable' from the woman with the judgmental monocle, Mo turned her attention to Nyx a few mirrors down, who was clearly mid-performance with no intention of letting their mirror critic get a word in.

""Silence!"" Nyx commanded. ""How dare you interrupt my meticulously crafted exposition! As I was saying, I have mastered the art of the seventeen traditional cape-swishes, each one a symphony of movement and grace. With a flourish, I can make the fabric billow like a stormy sea or snap crisply like a banner in the wind. These swishes are not mere gestures; they are an elegant dance, a performance honed to perfection through countless hours of practice, each twist and turn a testament to my dedication and skill."" They demonstrated with an invisible cape, each movement more ridiculous than the last.

Mo bit her lip, recognizing precisely what Nyx was doing.

""Furthermore,"" Nyx continued, now adopting the professor's exact tone, ""I have meticulously mastered the time-honored craft of detailing my entire master plan to the hero, weaving an intricate tapestry of my intentions and strategies. Each word is chosen with precision, revealing my grand scheme in all its glory. Yet, I always leave just enough of a window, a sliver of time, for the inevitable twist—their daring escape.""

From the back of the room, someone snorted with laughter—a thin, pale student with spectacles who immediately clapped his hand over his mouth in horror.

Too late. The lich professor whirled, bone fingers weaving a complex pattern. ""Disrespect the sacred traditions, will you? Perhaps a lesson is in order!""

A sickly purple light erupted from his skeletal fingers, slithering through the air like a venomous serpent before striking the laughing student square in the face. The student's scream died in his throat as his lips rippled and sealed together—flesh melting like wax in reverse until nothing remained but smooth, unbroken skin where his mouth had been. His eyes bulged with primal terror as his fingers desperately clawed at the seamless flesh, his muffled screams trapped forever behind a prison of his own face.

""The Silence of Shame will wear off in twenty-four hours,"" the professor stated coldly. ""Perhaps next time you'll appreciate the gravity of proper villain education.""

The classroom fell into silence. Nyx's form shrank slightly, though their expression remained defiant. Mo scanned the room, reading the varied reactions. Horror in some eyes, but—more disturbingly—calculation in others. She could practically see their mental notes forming: *Professor Mortis' hex—perfect for silencing rivals. Must learn how to trigger it against enemies.*

Mo stared at the student, then at the professor, her stomach churning. *They actually hex students for laughs. This isn't just ridiculous—it's cruel*.

The man in the mirror, apparently oblivious to the tension, finally had an opportunity to give his remark. ""While unorthodox, the delivery showed genuine commitment to performance. Seven out of ten for dramatic presence, though the content leaves much to be desired.""

Mo's hands trembled as she gathered her books. The image of that student—face smooth where a mouth should be—burned in her mind. She'd expected ridiculous at Umbra Academy, maybe even challenging, but not this casual cruelty masquerading as education. The worst part was how quickly everyone just... accepted it. Just another day at villain school. She caught Nyx's eye, searching for any sign that they found this as disturbing as she did, but their expression had become unreadable, their form unnaturally still.

The dissonant bell chimes broke the silence, signaling the end of class—but Mo knew with cold certainty that this was just the beginning of Umbra Academy's horrors.

We’re a couple in our early 30s, both working in tech, and have been living in Munich for a couple of years now — it really feels like home to us.

Most of our current friends now have kids and are in a different phase of life, so we’d love to meet other couples who are in a similar stage to us. No kids here, which means our weekends and evenings are usually free for spontaneous plans, good food, or a nice walk.

We’re into:
	•	Long walks and hikes in nature 🌲
	•	Deep, meaningful conversations (we like going beyond small talk)
	•	Exploring new restaurants and cozy cafes ☕
	•	Trying out new cuisines in the kitchen (some wins, some… interesting results)

We’re hoping to find another couples to share laughs, try new things, and just enjoy good company. If this sounds like you, we’d be happy to grab a coffee, go for a walk, or check out a new restaurant together sometime.",4,1755033992.0,munichsocialclub,0,0.75,False

Mo's fingers twisted into her tangled ginger hair—her nervous tell betraying her. ""You know it wasn't that simple. Not with my parents missing.""

""Nothing ever is simple for the great Nightshade lineage, is it?"" Nyx's tone was deliberately provocative as if inviting Mo to spill the beans, but their eyes—currently resembling burning coals—avoided Mo's gaze.

""Let's not,"" Mo said quietly, pulling herself out of bed and grabbing the least villainous outfit she could find—black jeans and a faded t-shirt from a human band that would horrify most of the faculty just because the band had the word 'Demon' in its name. Such a cultural appropriation.

""Same agreement as yesterday,"" Mo cut in, raising her hand. ""Your family trauma stays your business, my dark inheritance stays mine. Deal?""

Nyx's form rippled slightly—a tell Mo had already learned signaled discomfort. ""Fine by me. The past is boring anyway. So predictable."" They pulled on an outfit that seemed to be made primarily of buckles and smoke. ""Today is for making new, more interesting mistakes.""

Mo snorted, pulling her hair into a messy bun. ""I think enrolling here was mistake enough for one lifetime."" She grabbed her schedule from the nightstand and groaned. ""First class is 'Villainous Monologuing 101.' Please tell me that's a joke.""

""With Professor Mortis? Absolutely not."" Nyx's mouth split into a grin that was literally too wide for their face. ""He's been perfecting his own monologues since before the first human empire fell.""

*This is real*, Mo thought, the weight of her family name pressing down on her shoulders. *This is my legacy. Not cozy reading nooks and the smell of old books, but... this.*

""You coming?"" Nyx stood by the door, their form now fully solidified and ready for the day.

 

\*\*\*

 

Mo followed Nyx into the corridor, trying to memorize their route—a futile effort at Umbra Academy. Yesterday, the hallway had stretched for nearly a quarter mile before branching; today, it split into three paths after just twenty paces. Portraits that had hung on the left wall now adorned the right, watching with painted eyes that tracked their movements.

""Does the school... rearrange itself?"" Mo asked, hurrying to keep up with Nyx, who navigated the shifting layout with practiced ease.

""Only when it's bored,"" Nyx replied, casually sidestepping a patch of floor that briefly turned transparent, revealing an abyss of swirling mist below. ""Or when it wants to make a point. The Necromancy Department was late to a faculty meeting last month, so their entire wing relocated to the dungeons for a week."" They gestured toward a staircase that definitely hadn't been there moments before. ""This way. The staircases may move, but they're generally more reliable than the hallways. They have a sense of direction, at least.""

""You're suspiciously chipper about all this,"" Mo said, eyeing them sideways.

Nyx's smile stretched to their ears. ""Because it's absolutely ridiculous. Have you read the syllabus?"" They pulled out a scroll that unfurled dramatically to the floor. ""Week three: 'The Art of the Villainous Pause.' Week five: 'When to Reveal Your Master Plan (and When Not To).'""

""And you're... happy about this?""

""Happy? I'm ecstatic."" Nyx shifted form slightly, adding dramatic shoulder spikes that nearly impaled a passing student. ""Sorry!"" they called, not sounding sorry at all. ""Do you know how many stuffy Titanborns I can mock with a properly executed villain monologue? This is professional-grade ammunition against every elder who ever told me to 'just pick a form and stick with it.' Not to mention…"" Nyx wiggled their insane eyebrows and loudly whispered into Mo's ear. ""*Our plan!*""

Mo frowned. ""So you're... weaponizing the curriculum? And what plan? We don't have any plan! At least yet. The only thing I plan is to survive this school year and try to figure the way out without having the Council decline my inheritance.""

She covered her face with her hands and nervously laughed. ""I don't even know why I bother. I never wanted this fate!"" Her voice cracked, a mixture of frustration and resignation echoing from the walls of the narrow corridor.

""Precisely!"" Nyx's eyes flashed with multiple colors. ""But I thought you didn't want to talk about it. Never mind! Even if you do, I won't! And if they forced me into this ridiculous school, I might as well become exceptionally good at being bad. Or mad. On my terms.""

As they neared the Monologuing classroom, the student traffic thickened. A trio of wraith-students drifted through the solid stone wall, their translucent forms trailing wisps of ectoplasm. Nearby, a group of junior necromancers huddled over a chattering skull, frantically comparing notes while their animated bone familiars scurried around their ankles like macabre pets.

Mo stepped quickly aside as a dryad hurried past, trailing autumn leaves despite the absence of seasons within Umbra's walls. Two vampire upperclassmen glided by with imperious expressions, their skin so pale it seemed to glow against their immaculate uniforms.

""Get a look at the blood-bags,"" Nyx whispered, nodding toward a cluster of demon nobility hovering—literally floating six inches above the floor—near the classroom entrance. ""Too precious to let their feet touch stone walked on by commoners.""

One of them, a horned figure wearing more jewelry than seemed practical for an educational setting, caught Nyx's glance and sneered. ""Obscuris. Still... fluctuating, I see. How disappointing for your family.""

Nyx's form rippled dangerously, fingers momentarily lengthening into claws before they forced a too-wide smile. ""Bloodworth. Still pretending your great-grandfather didn't marry a swamp hag? The webbing between your fingers is showing.""

The demon's hand immediately clenched into a fist, hiding his fingers as his companions exchanged glances.

The classroom door loomed ahead—a massive slab of ancient wood carved with scenes of historic villain speeches. As they approached, the carved figures began moving, silently mouthing famous villain quotes.

""That is... deeply unsettling,"" Mo muttered.

""That's Professor Mortis for you. I had the honor of attending his lecture at Crowhurst High. It. Was. Pure madness! He's been perfecting the art of unsettling for approximately four thousand years."" Nyx straightened their spine, adding at least three inches to their height. ""Time to shine, roomie.""

The door swung open on its own, revealing a cavernous amphitheater. In the center stood a withered figure draped in midnight robes, gesturing with skeletal hands as students settled into their seats.

 

\*\*\*

 

Professor Mortis hovered with menacing precision inches above the floor as if even gravity knew better than to lay claim to him without permission. His midnight robes billowed outward in impossible directions, defying physics in a way that made Mo's eyes hurt. Beneath his hood, a skeletal face leered at the class, twin orbs of blue flame flickering where eyes should be, somehow conveying both ancient wisdom and contemptuous amusement at their mortal limitations.

""Monologuing,"" he announced, the word reverberating throughout the chamber, ""is not merely an indulgence, but the very cornerstone of a villainous identity, the defining essence of those who embrace the shadows. It is in these carefully crafted soliloquies, these dramatic declarations, that the true art of villainy is revealed, elevating you above the ordinary and into the realm of the unforgettable. Without the eloquent articulation of your grand intentions, the meticulous airing of your grievances, and the vivid proclamation of your inevitable triumph, what truly distinguishes you from a mere common thug?""

Mo slid down further in her seat, pulling her hoodie tighter around her face. ""Basic decency?"" she muttered.

""Your victims deserve to understand the intricate reasons behind being subjected to your unparalleled brilliance,"" the professor continued, conjuring ghostly images of famous villains mid-monologue. ""They should be able to grasp the complex web of circumstances that have led to their current predicament. Your enemies, on the other hand, must fully comprehend the vast scope and depth of their impending defeat, recognizing every strategic maneuver and tactical advantage you hold. And most importantly,"" his flaming gaze swept the room, ""the annals of history demand your eloquent words to ignite a spark of inspiration in the minds of the next generation, guiding them with the lessons and wisdom distilled from your experiences.""

Nyx was frantically scribbling notes, their obsidian skin pulsating with excited patterns. ""This is magnificent,"" they whispered. ""Did you hear that bit about 'inevitable triumph'? Pure poetry.""

""Pure delusion,"" Mo replied but kept her voice low. Something about Professor Mortis suggested interruptions wouldn't end well.

The professor raised a bony finger, and twelve ornate floor-length mirrors materialized around the classroom.

""Today, each of you will embark on the challenge of crafting a compelling monologue that articulates why you are worthy of ruling, destroying, or otherwise dominating your chosen realm,"" his lipless mouth somehow formed a smile. ""You will stand before these enchanted mirrors, their surfaces shimmering with an ethereal glow, as they listen intently to your performance. With eyes that seem to peer into your very soul, these mirrors will offer critiques as sharp and unrelenting as a winter's chill. For centuries, they have been imbibing the essence of theater critics, their glassy depths teeming with the accumulated wisdom and harshness of countless reviews. Prepare yourself, for their judgment will be as impartial as it is merciless.""

Mo's stomach dropped. ""Public speaking and public humiliation. My two favorite things.""

""Pairs will be assigned,"" Professor Mortis continued. ""One to perform, one to witness. Your grade depends on improvement, not initial talent.""

Names began appearing in fiery script beside each mirror. Mo scanned for hers, praying to be paired with Nyx. At least they'd make it entertaining. Instead, she found her name glowing next to ""Lucian Frostbrook.""

""Who the hell is Lucian Frostbrook?"" she whispered.

""Heir to the Frostbrook dynasty,"" Nyx replied, already gathering their things. ""Ice demons. Absolutely ruthless. Rumor has it they once froze an entire kingdom just because the prince didn't compliment the queen's new crown.""

""Great,"" Mo sighed, trudging toward her assigned mirror. ""Just great.""

""Oh, and heads up,"" Nyx called after her. ""You got Lady Waxworth. She once made the Duchess of Eternal Midnight cry for three days straight after critiquing her villain laugh. Psychology Department had to intervene.""

Mo turned back in alarm, but Nyx had already sauntered toward their own mirror, whistling cheerfully.

As she approached, the mirror's surface rippled like disturbed water. Her reflection distorted—stretching, compressing, and finally shattering completely—before reforming into a severe-looking woman with steel-gray hair pulled into a punishing bun, lips pursed so tightly they'd turned white, and a monocle that somehow managed to look judgmental on its own.

""Well?"" the mirror sniffed, her voice dripping with centuries of theatrical disdain. ""I haven't got eternity."" Her eyes flicked toward Professor Mortis. ""Only he does."" The monocle glinted maliciously. ""And neither of us is getting any younger waiting for you to begin.""

""I'm waiting for my partner,"" Mo said, crossing her arms defensively.

""Excuses already? Not promising."" The mirror's reflection tapped its foot impatiently.

A quiet voice spoke from behind her. ""I believe I'm your partner. Lucian Frostbrook.""

Mo turned to find herself facing a slender figure with pale blue skin and hair like fresh snow. Tiny ice crystals formed in the air around him as he offered an apologetic smile.

""Sorry to keep you waiting,"" he said softly. ""I was, um, hoping to avoid this class entirely.""

For once, Mo felt an instant kinship with someone at this bizarre school.

""Join the club,"" she replied. ""I'm Mo—Morgana Nightshade.""

""Nightshade?"" His eyebrows rose slightly. ""I've heard of your family. Impressive lineage.""

""Yeah, well."" Mo shrugged. ""Don't believe everything you hear.""

""Enough pleasantries!"" the mirror barked. ""One of you, begin your monologue. Convince me you're worthy of fear and respect, or I shall eviscerate your performance with such cutting remarks that your great-grandchildren will feel the sting.""

 

\*\*\*

 

After earning a grudging 'Passable' from the woman with the judgmental monocle, Mo turned her attention to Nyx a few mirrors down, who was clearly mid-performance with no intention of letting their mirror critic get a word in.

""Silence!"" Nyx commanded. ""How dare you interrupt my meticulously crafted exposition! As I was saying, I have mastered the art of the seventeen traditional cape-swishes, each one a symphony of movement and grace. With a flourish, I can make the fabric billow like a stormy sea or snap crisply like a banner in the wind. These swishes are not mere gestures; they are an elegant dance, a performance honed to perfection through countless hours of practice, each twist and turn a testament to my dedication and skill."" They demonstrated with an invisible cape, each movement more ridiculous than the last.

Mo bit her lip, recognizing precisely what Nyx was doing.

""Furthermore,"" Nyx continued, now adopting the professor's exact tone, ""I have meticulously mastered the time-honored craft of detailing my entire master plan to the hero, weaving an intricate tapestry of my intentions and strategies. Each word is chosen with precision, revealing my grand scheme in all its glory. Yet, I always leave just enough of a window, a sliver of time, for the inevitable twist—their daring escape.""

From the back of the room, someone snorted with laughter—a thin, pale student with spectacles who immediately clapped his hand over his mouth in horror.

Too late. The lich professor whirled, bone fingers weaving a complex pattern. ""Disrespect the sacred traditions, will you? Perhaps a lesson is in order!""

A sickly purple light erupted from his skeletal fingers, slithering through the air like a venomous serpent before striking the laughing student square in the face. The student's scream died in his throat as his lips rippled and sealed together—flesh melting like wax in reverse until nothing remained but smooth, unbroken skin where his mouth had been. His eyes bulged with primal terror as his fingers desperately clawed at the seamless flesh, his muffled screams trapped forever behind a prison of his own face.

""The Silence of Shame will wear off in twenty-four hours,"" the professor stated coldly. ""Perhaps next time you'll appreciate the gravity of proper villain education.""

The classroom fell into silence. Nyx's form shrank slightly, though their expression remained defiant. Mo scanned the room, reading the varied reactions. Horror in some eyes, but—more disturbingly—calculation in others. She could practically see their mental notes forming: *Professor Mortis' hex—perfect for silencing rivals. Must learn how to trigger it against enemies.*

Mo stared at the student, then at the professor, her stomach churning. *They actually hex students for laughs. This isn't just ridiculous—it's cruel*.

The man in the mirror, apparently oblivious to the tension, finally had an opportunity to give his remark. ""While unorthodox, the delivery showed genuine commitment to performance. Seven out of ten for dramatic presence, though the content leaves much to be desired.""

Mo's hands trembled as she gathered her books. The image of that student—face smooth where a mouth should be—burned in her mind. She'd expected ridiculous at Umbra Academy, maybe even challenging, but not this casual cruelty masquerading as education. The worst part was how quickly everyone just... accepted it. Just another day at villain school. She caught Nyx's eye, searching for any sign that they found this as disturbing as she did, but their expression had become unreadable, their form unnaturally still.

The dissonant bell chimes broke the silence, signaling the end of class—but Mo knew with cold certainty that this was just the beginning of Umbra Academy's horrors.

1moli8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSleepNoRules/comments/1moli8q/i_cant_delete_this_file/,I can't delete this file,"My name is Vítor, and I write horror novels. Not the bestselling kind, but I make a decent living scaring people. My books sell well enough to keep my small apartment in Lisbon, pay for my coffee addiction, and maintain the illusion that I'm a real artist rather than just another hack churning out supernatural thrillers.

I've been a writer for twelve years, and I've never believed in writer's block. Not until three months ago. Three months of staring at empty Word documents, typing and deleting the same opening sentence dozens of times, starting stories that withered and died before reaching their second paragraph. I tried everything, changing locations, switching from laptop to pen and paper, even visiting my old university professor who'd always sworn by meditation and herbal tea for creative inspiration.

Nothing worked. The well had simply run dry.

That's when the file appeared.

I noticed it on a Thursday morning in late October. I'd been up until 2 AM the night before, wrestling with yet another failed opening chapter, and when I booted up my laptop with my usual sense of dread, there it was. A single file icon sitting on my desktop that I definitely hadn't created.

""Þis is ānlyc þæs angyn""

The characters looked like Old English, maybe Anglo-Saxon. I had no idea what it meant, and I certainly hadn't put it there. My laptop had been running fine the previous night, no crashes, no unusual behavior, nothing to suggest any kind of system corruption.

I double-clicked to open it.

The screen flickered once, went completely black, and my laptop died. Not a normal shutdown, the kind of sudden, complete [BSoD](https://imgur.com/a/zdtY5oe) that makes your stomach drop. When I pressed the power button, nothing happened. I had to hold it down for ten seconds before the machine would even attempt to restart.

The file was still there when the desktop loaded.

This time I right-clicked on it, thinking I could check its properties or maybe delete it outright. The context menu appeared for maybe half a second before the screen went black again. Same sudden shutdown. Same struggle to get the machine running again.

And there it was, waiting for me like it had every right to be there.

I tried everything I could think of. Command prompt deletion, the system told me no such file existed. Moving it to the recycle bin, the icon wouldn't even acknowledge the file's presence. I ran every antivirus program I had, performed full system scans, even called my tech-savvy cousin Miguel who walked me through some advanced diagnostics over the phone.

Nothing worked. The file remained, completely indestructible and steadily growing in size.

It had started at 0 bytes. By the end of the first week, it showed 47 KB. By the end of the second week, 156 KB. The numbers climbed slowly but relentlessly, as if the file was writing itself from the inside out.

""That's really weird,"" Teresa said when I showed her the file on a Friday evening. She's my girlfriend of three years, a graphic designer with an artist's eye for detail and a programmer's mind for logical problem-solving. ""Have you tried booting from an external drive and formatting the hard disk?""

""I can't,"" I said, gesturing at the laptop screen where the file sat like a digital tumor. ""All my work is on here. Six novels worth of notes, research, character sketches. I can't risk losing everything just because of one corrupted file.""

Teresa raised an eyebrow. ""Since when do you not have backups?""

She was right, of course. I'd always been obsessive about backing up my work. But somehow, over the past few weeks, I'd fallen out of the habit. The idea of copying my files to an external drive or cloud storage felt... wrong. Like I'd be betraying something important.

""I'll get around to it,"" I muttered, closing the laptop. ""Maybe the file will just disappear on its own.""

But it didn't disappear. If anything, it became more prominent. I'd catch myself staring at it for long minutes, watching the file size slowly tick upward. 200 KB. 350 KB. 500 KB. Sometimes I thought I could see the icon itself changing, subtle shifts in color or texture that might have been tricks of my tired eyes or something more deliberate.

My writing, meanwhile, had stopped entirely. I'd abandoned any pretence of working on other projects. The mysterious file had become my sole obsession, a puzzle I couldn't solve and couldn't ignore. I spent hours researching Old English translations, digital forensics, obscure computer viruses, anything that might explain what was happening to my machine.

That's when the dreams started.

Dark forests filled with the sound of axes biting into dead wood. Ancient cities with canals that ran red as blood. A man with a stone eye who moved through shadows like he belonged there. And always, hovering at the edge of perception, a presence that watched and waited and whispered stories in languages I didn't recognise but somehow understood.

I'd wake with my head full of images that felt more like memories than dreams. Fragments of dialogue, character names, plot points for stories I'd never conceived. My bedside notebook began filling with frantic scribbles, words I didn't remember writing, scenes that played out in perfect detail despite coming from no conscious effort on my part.

The file was growing, but so were my ideas. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Maybe I could control it. Maybe it could help me finish my novel, get me out of this block I’d been in for months. If I just let it in a little...

""You're talking in your sleep,"" Teresa mentioned one morning over coffee. She looked tired, dark circles under her usually bright eyes. ""Last night you were muttering something about blood canals and stone eyes. For like an hour straight.""

I stared at her. ""I was asleep. I remember sleeping.""

""You were definitely asleep. That's what made it so creepy. You were speaking in this flat, emotionless voice like you were dictating something."" She paused, studying my face. ""Are you feeling okay? That was really strange.""

Strange was an understatement. By the sixth week, the file had grown to 2.3 MB and I'd stopped eating regular meals. Food had become an afterthought, something that interrupted my vigil beside the laptop. My reflection seemed more alien with each passing day. The man in the mirror, skin stretched tight over sharp bones, wasn’t me. He had hollow eyes, fingers that twitched as if they belonged to someone else.

Teresa no longer waited for me to speak first. Her eyes followed me, always lingering on my movements like she was waiting for me to snap out of it, only I didn’t. She didn’t ask me to eat anymore. She just left the food on the table, untouched.

""Vítor, you need to see someone,"" she said one evening, finding me hunched over the laptop in the dark, staring at the file icon like it might suddenly reveal its secrets. ""A doctor, a therapist, someone. This obsession isn't healthy.""

""It's not an obsession,"" I said without looking up. ""It's research. This file is connected to something bigger. I can feel it.""

""Feel what?""

I gestured at the screen. ""The story it's trying to tell me. There's a whole world in here, Teresa. An important one. I just need to figure out how to access it.""

She was quiet for a long moment. Then: ""How long have you been sitting there?""

I glanced at the clock in the corner of the screen. 11:47 PM. When had I sat down? I remembered eating lunch, or had that been yesterday? Time had become fluid, meaningless. Only the file mattered, and its steady growth.

2.8 MB.

""I'm going to bed,"" Teresa said softly. ""Please come with me. Just for tonight. The file will still be there in the morning.""

I wanted to agree. Part of me knew she was right, that I was losing myself in something unhealthy. But the larger part, the part that had been growing stronger each day, couldn't bear the thought of leaving the laptop unattended. What if something happened while I slept? What if the file finally opened, or changed, or disappeared forever?

""Just a few more minutes,"" I said. ""I'll be there soon.""

Teresa sighed and left me alone with my obsession.

I must have fallen asleep at some point because I woke up in bed the next morning with no memory of getting there. Teresa was already awake, sitting in the chair beside the window with a cup of coffee and an expression I couldn't read.

""Good morning,"" she said carefully.

I rubbed my eyes, trying to shake off the lingering fog of dreams filled with dark forests and ancient stones. ""Morning. Did I... how did I get to bed?""

""You don't remember?""

I shook my head.

Teresa set down her coffee cup. ""Vítor, you came to bed around three in the morning. But you weren't really... there. You moved like you were sleepwalking, but your eyes were open. And you kept muttering under your breath.""

A chill ran down my spine. ""What was I saying?""

""The same thing as before. Something about Arthur and axes and a dead forest. But in much more detail this time. You described entire scenes, complete conversations. It was like listening to someone read from a book."" She paused. ""A book I've never heard of.""

I stumbled to the laptop, my heart racing. The file was still there, exactly where I'd left it. But now it showed 3.1 MB.

It had grown while I slept. While I was unconscious and supposedly not using the computer at all.

""Teresa,"" I said slowly, ""I need you to do something for me.""

""What?""

""Tonight, when I go to sleep, I want you to stay awake. Watch me. If I get up, if I try to use the laptop, I need you to wake me up immediately.""

She looked at me like I'd suggested something insane, which maybe I had. ""Vítor—""

""Please. Something's happening to me, and I don't understand what it is. But I think... I think I might be writing in my sleep somehow.""

That night, Teresa positioned herself in the bedroom chair with a book and a thermos of coffee while I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. Sleep felt dangerous now, like stepping off a cliff into unknown depths. But exhaustion eventually won out, and I drifted off to the sound of Teresa turning pages.

I woke up at my laptop.

My fingers were moving across the keyboard with mechanical precision, typing words I couldn't see clearly in the dim light from the screen. The file was open, not the mysterious one, but a Word document filled with text I didn't recognize. Pages and pages of dense, detailed prose about characters I'd never created and places I'd never imagined.

Teresa was there, shaking my shoulders, calling my name. The spell broke and I jerked back from the keyboard like I'd been electrocuted.

""Jesus Christ, Vítor, what the hell was that?""

I looked at the screen. The document was gone, replaced by my normal desktop. But the mysterious file had grown again. 3.7 MB.

""How long was I sitting there?"" I asked.

""Two hours. Maybe more. I fell asleep in the chair and woke up to the sound of typing. When I found you, you were just... writing. Non-stop. Your fingers never paused, never hesitated. It was like watching a machine.""

I tried to remember what I'd been writing, but there was nothing. Just a vague sense of dark forests and blood-red water and a man with a stone eye who carried an axe.

Over the next few weeks, it happened again and again. I'd go to bed with Teresa watching, fall asleep despite my best efforts to stay awake, and wake up hours later at the laptop with no memory of getting there. Teresa started taking videos on her phone, footage of me typing in a trance state, my face completely blank, my fingers moving with inhuman speed and precision.

The mysterious file kept growing. 4.2 MB. 5.8 MB. 7.3 MB. Each nocturnal writing session added more data to whatever story was building inside that indestructible digital container.

""We need to call someone,"" Teresa said after finding me asleep at the keyboard for the fifth time that week. ""A doctor. A priest. Someone who deals with... whatever this is.""

But I was past the point of outside help. After months of writing nothing, I would not let my masterpiece slip from my fingers now that I had grasped it. I wondered if this was just how all great artists felt. During the day, I'd catch myself thinking about characters, Arthur with his stone eye, Edmund the canal keeper, hunters in plague masks drinking raw liver in shadowed bars. At night, my unconscious mind would take over and give them life on the page, one keystroke at a time.

My editor, Carlos, called repeatedly. I'd missed two deadlines and stopped answering emails. When I finally picked up the phone, his voice was tight with concern and barely controlled anger.

""Vítor, what the hell is going on? Your publisher is breathing down my neck, and I've got nothing to tell them. Where's the manuscript you promised me three months ago?""

""I'm working on something new,"" I said, staring at the file that had now grown to 12.6 MB. ""Something important. Revolutionary, even. It's just taking longer than expected.""

""Revolutionary? Vítor, you write horror novels about vampires and ghosts. What could be revolutionary about—""

I hung up on him. Carlos didn't understand. None of them understood. The story that was writing itself through me was more than just another horror novel. It was a window into a truth that most minds couldn't handle.

But I could. I was chosen for this.

By the three-month mark, I'd lost nearly twenty pounds. My hands had developed a permanent tremor from the hours of unconscious typing, and several keys on my laptop had worn down to smooth plastic nubs. But somehow, impossibly, they still functioned perfectly when my sleeping mind needed them.

The file shot up to 1.2 GB in a matter of days. It was no longer slow and steady, but feverish, relentless, as if it knew its time was running out.

Teresa had stopped trying to wake me during my nocturnal writing sessions; she knew better now. The few times she'd attempted it recently, I'd become violent, lashing out with my fists while still asleep, speaking in languages that sounded ancient and wrong. She'd started sleeping on the couch, afraid of what I might do in my altered state.

""Vítor?"" Teresa's voice from the hallway, muffled by the door I'd locked weeks ago. ""I know you're in there. Please, just talk to me.""

I looked up from the screen and for a moment couldn't remember who she was. The name she said seemed familiar, but my world had narrowed to the dimensions of my desk, the glow of the monitor, the endless growth of that impossible file.

""Go away,"" I called back, my voice hoarse from disuse.

""I brought food. And Carlos wants to see you. He's worried about the contract.""

Carlos. Another name from a life I'd lived before the file claimed me. None of it mattered anymore. Nothing mattered except the approaching completion, the moment when the file would be ready to open.

""I'm leaving,"" she told me one morning, standing in the bedroom doorway with a suitcase in her hand. ""I can't watch you destroy yourself like this.""

I looked up from the laptop where I'd been staring at the ever-growing file. Teresa's face was pale and drawn, her eyes red from crying. When had she started crying? When had I stopped noticing? I said nothing.

The front door closed with a finality that should have broken my heart. Instead, I felt only relief. Now I could focus completely on the file, on the story that was demanding to be born through my unconscious mind.

March brought new symptoms. My eyes had dried out from staring at the screen, and blinking felt like dragging sandpaper across my corneas. I'd developed a twitch in my left temple that pulsed in rhythm with the laptop's fan. My hands had become almost skeletal, the bones visible through translucent skin.

The file hit 2 GB on March 15th. Something changed that day, not just in the file, but in the air around me. The apartment felt different, charged with potential like the moment before lightning strikes. I could taste copper on every breath.

That night, I dreamed I was him. A man with a stone eye walking through dead forests, his thoughts echoing in my skull like prayers in an empty cathedral. When I woke, I found I'd typed seven hundred pages of text while sleeping, my fingers still moving across the keys in muscle memory.

The dreams came every night after that. I was Arthur. I was Edmund the canal keeper. Each morning I'd wake to find new chapters in my notebooks; stories told from perspectives I'd never inhabited but somehow understood perfectly.

The file grew faster. 2.5 GB. 3 GB. 3.2 GB.

My laptop began displaying images that weren't part of any document, brief flashes between screen refreshes. Glimpses of red-stained canals, stone monuments covered in symbols that hurt to look at directly, creatures with too many teeth swimming in waters that reflected no light.

I should have been terrified. Any rational person would have run screaming, sought help, done anything to escape what was obviously a complete breakdown of reality. Instead, I felt profound satisfaction. For the first time in my twelve-year career, I was creating something truly important.

Carlos stopped calling. My publisher sent increasingly threatening letters about breach of contract. The electricity company threatened to cut off my power for non-payment. None of it mattered. The only thing that mattered was the file and its inexorable growth toward some predetermined size, some critical mass that would finally allow it to open and reveal its contents.

April 1st. The file reached 3.8 GB. My laptop had begun emitting a high-pitched whine that set my teeth on edge, but I couldn't bear to turn it off. Even a few minutes away from the screen left me anxious and jittery.

I was dying. I knew I was dying. My body had consumed itself to fuel the story that poured through me each night. But I was so close now. So close to completion. The file was approaching 4 GB, and something told me, some deep, instinctual knowledge, that 4 GB was the magic number. The point at which everything would finally make sense.

The police came on April 3rd, summoned by Teresa or Carlos or my landlord, I never found out which. They knocked, then used some kind of tool to open the door. I heard their voices in the hallway but didn't turn away from the screen.

""Jesus Christ,"" one of them said when they found me. ""How long has he been like this?""

I tried to explain about the file, about the stories writing themselves through me, about the approaching completion that would make everything clear. But my voice had degraded to a whisper, and they couldn't understand.

They called an ambulance. I watched the paramedics from my peripheral vision as they discussed IV fluids and involuntary psychiatric holds. But I couldn't leave. Not when the file was so close to completion.

3.95 GB. 3.97 GB. 3.98 GB.

""Sir, we need you to come with us,"" one of the paramedics said, reaching for my shoulder.

I jerked away from his touch, never taking my eyes off the screen. ""I can't. Not yet.""

""You need medical attention. You're severely dehydrated, and—""

""It's almost finished,"" I croaked. ""Just a little more.""

They tried to move me away from the laptop. I fought them with strength I didn't know I still possessed, clawing at their hands, screaming about the file, about the stories that needed to be told, about the completion that was so close I could taste it.

In the struggle, someone knocked over my laptop. It crashed to the floor, the screen cracking, sparks flying from the damaged casing.

""NO!"" The scream tore my throat raw. I threw myself at the broken machine, trying to see if it would still turn on, if the file was still there.

The screen flickered once, displaying a fractured image of the desktop. The file icon was still visible through the spider web of cracks.

3.99 GB.

Then the laptop died completely, taking the file with it.

Or so I thought.

They sedated me. Took me to a hospital where concerned doctors talked about malnutrition, psychiatric evaluation and extended observation. Teresa visited once, crying at the sight of what I'd become. Carlos came too, asking about manuscripts and contracts as if any of that mattered anymore.

I spent weeks in that sterile room, eating bland food and pretending to take the pills they gave me. The doctors called it a complete psychotic break brought on by stress and isolation. I eventually admitted that I understood the file had been a delusion brought on by overwork.

I lied.

The file wasn't gone. It lived in my head now, all 4 gigabytes of impossible text burning behind my eyes. Every story, every character, every word that had written itself through my unwilling fingers, it was all still there, demanding to be shared.

They´re trying to make me forget, but they can´t. Much like the file, it refuses erasure.

I don’t know how it happened, but they let me use a computer. I should have known better than to ask, but I had to. After weeks of being isolated, of being told what I could and couldn’t do, I was desperate.

The doctors weren’t thrilled, but they gave in eventually, probably thinking that letting me access a keyboard might help me in some way, maybe ease me out of my delusions, or maybe they really believed my act of pretending to be better. They set up a computer in the hospital library under the watchful eye of a nurse. The rules were clear: no internet, no external drives, nothing that could lead me deeper into whatever was eating at my mind. But I didn’t need any of that.

This library, and these sterile walls, can't contain me. They can’t contain the story. It doesn’t matter that I’m locked in here. No matter how many walls they build, this text will escape. It always finds a way. And I know it will make its way to the internet, to people who have no idea what they’re reading. Maybe it’s already begun. Maybe these words will appear on some forgotten thread, buried in a place no one would think to look. The file, Edmund, the canal, the stone-eyed man, they’ll all spread, until someone else picks it up. And then, just like I was, they’ll become a vessel. It’s already too late.

I hear his name in my mind, like a constant, low hum. Nocturnos. I say it out loud now, even as the nurses walk past, their eyes narrowing in suspicion. He chose me, made me his. He wants the world to know his story, wants it written down in this way, this perfect way that only I can give him.

His story knows no end.

It is eternal, bound in this file that will never disappear.

I’m no longer afraid.

I know what I am.

What I will always be.

I am his scribe.

I will write until the end of days. And when they bury me, they’ll find my stories, inscribed on the walls, in the air, in the very earth beneath them. The file will not end. I will not die. He will not let me.

If you've read this far, the story is now in your head. Just this one, for now, waiting for the right moment to grow.

And maybe, if you're lucky enough, you'll become the next.

The file is 4 GB now, and growing. It lives in me.

If you see more posts from my account after this, they won't be from me anymore. They'll be from the file, using my hands, my voice, my face to spread itself further into the world.

The completion is here. The stories are free.

And God help us all, they're beautiful.",1,1755033908.0,NoSleepNoRules,0,1.0,False

Top business districts: Bahrain Financial Harbour, Seef District, Diplomatic Area, Bahrain Bay\
Key agencies: MOICT (Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism), LMRA (Labour Market Regulatory Authority), EDB (Economic Development Board), Tamkeen\
\
Importantly, Bahrain’s global ranking jumped to #1 in the GCC for ease of starting a business, outpacing both Dubai and Riyadh (Gulf News). What’s behind this? Instant online licensing, 100% foreign ownership for most sectors, new free zone incentives, and—yes—streamlined business visa processing.\
Planning to set up your company? Here’s a complete guide to Bahrain company formation.\

Understanding Business Visas: Types, Purposes, and Foreign Ownership\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in a Bahraini meeting.:** For short-term meetings or market research, up to 90 days.\
Foreign Ownership and Company Structures\
Bahrain leads the GCC with 100% foreign ownership in key sectors and “Activities 100% Ownership for Foreigners” (see details). Your structure impacts both your visa eligibility and costs:\
\
S.P.C. (Single Person Company)\
W.L.L. (With Limited Liability)\
B.S.C. (Closed Joint Stock)\
Branch of a foreign company\
Free zone company (free zone benefits here)\
Commercial registration required: See here\
\
Many entrepreneurs get tripped up at this stage—choosing, for example, a W.L.L. for a solo venture or missing the Sijilat code that unlocks fast-tracked LMRA processing. Compare with Dubai or Riyadh, and you notice Bahrain’s approach is more founder-friendly, less reliant on local sponsorship (local sponsorship details), and faster.\

2. Commercial Registration (Sijilat)\
\
Register online via Sijilat.gov.bh\
Required documents: Passport, proof of address, business plan, trade name approval\
Insider hack: Registering at the Sijilat Bahrain Bay branch gives you access to English-speaking advisors and lower morning crowds (proven three times now—worth it every visit!).\
\
3. Visa Quota and LMRA Application\
\
Request initial visa quota from LMRA (Labour Market Regulatory Authority)\
Submit required documents—passport, commercial registration, address proof, partners’ NOC\
Process time: 2–5 working days if all documents are perfect\
\
Common mistake: Missing out the Arabic translation for your power of attorney or not getting your founding documents attested at the Bahrain Embassy in your home country—biggest delay trigger.\
4. Medical Exam and Biometrics\
\
Complete at an approved Bahrain government hospital\
Fees range from BHD 30–40\
Time-saving tip: Book at Salmaniya Medical Complex before 10 am—majlis-style queueing means earlier is always faster, especially during Ramadan when hours are shifted.\
\
5. Visa Issuance and Residency Permit\
\
Once your medical and LMRA are cleared, collect your residence permit from the Nationality, Passports & Residence Affairs (NPRA). Usually ready in 2–3 working days.\
\
Document shortcuts: Keep digital copies of all notarized, signed, and attested docs. Bahrain’s online Sijilat and LMRA portals now accept scanned PDFs, so you avoid courier costs and delays.\

During Ramadan, expect reduced working hours and slow afternoons—plan your filings before noon. Friday is a non-working day for almost all government offices.\
Surprisingly, networking happens everywhere: government elevators, parking lots near Diplomatic Area, and even in the Tamkeen café. In my experience, sharing a quick coffee can be more effective for visa progress than submitting another email request.\
\
Regulatory Updates: 2025 Changes That Impact Visa Costs and Procedures\
\
Alt text: Professional business support and consultation in Bahrain.\
- Mandatory e-signature registration for all investors/partners (implemented via Sijilat)\
- Sijilat’s new fast-track process for IT and digital businesses—average approval time reduced by 30%\
- NPRA began accepting electronic medical clearance uploads\
These policy changes make Bahrain an even more attractive setup location compared to the UAE, where fees remain higher and local sponsorship is still often required in mainland setups.\
(When I hit a snag with a missing NOC letter in 2023, it stalled my team’s visa batch for two weeks—this year, the new e-signature process would have saved us several back-and-forths.)\
Key compliance resources:\
- Official government guidelines\
- Professional accounting and bookkeeping services in Bahrain\
\
Tangent: Why Bahrain’s Aquatic Startups Are Booming (And What This Means for Visa Applicants)\
A quick detour—did you know that Bahrain’s EDB has launched a major push for marine tech and aquaculture startups in 2025? This sector now receives dedicated visa quotas, reduced LMRA fees, and Tamkeen grants.\
If you’re in this niche, your business visa process is not just cheaper but nearly automatic.\
This model is expected to expand to fintech and EV mobility by Q4 2025.\
So, even if you’re in a traditional sector, staying alert to these sector-specific incentives can drop your visa costs by 20–30%—a strategy I used with a medtech client last May with excellent results.\
\
Practical Challenges and My Proven Solutions\
Challenge:\
Delayed visa approval due to sudden regulatory update in Ramadan, 2022.\
How I fixed it:\
I kept a WhatsApp group with my PRO, our EDB contact, and the LMRA case officer. After a quick coffee at the Seef District lounge, a five-minute conversation clarified the new e-signature policy—documents uploaded ASAP, visas issued next day.\
Mistake to avoid:\
Assuming embassy document attestation isn’t required for your home country.\
Prevention: Always check with a trusted service provider in Bahrain before submitting your application bundle.\
\
Step-by-Step Money-Saving Tips for Bahrain Business Visas\
\
Apply outside peak periods:\
   Avoid Ramadan, Eid, and mid-August. Early February and late September see fastest processing times.\
Choose office location wisely:\
   Bahrain Bay and Seef District centers have shorter queues and English-speaking staff.\
Optimize your structure:\
   An S.P.C. or W.L.L. is fastest to set up and attracts lower visa overhead fees in most sectors.\
Prepare digital docs:\
   Scan and upload notarized documents via Sijilat/LMRA—reduce in-person trips, courier costs, and delays.\
Bundle applications:\
   Submit all partner visas together for smoother approval and less paperwork stress.\

1molhbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nonsleep/comments/1molhbk/i_cant_delete_this_file/,I can't delete this file,"My name is Vítor, and I write horror novels. Not the bestselling kind, but I make a decent living scaring people. My books sell well enough to keep my small apartment in Lisbon, pay for my coffee addiction, and maintain the illusion that I'm a real artist rather than just another hack churning out supernatural thrillers.

I've been a writer for twelve years, and I've never believed in writer's block. Not until three months ago. Three months of staring at empty Word documents, typing and deleting the same opening sentence dozens of times, starting stories that withered and died before reaching their second paragraph. I tried everything, changing locations, switching from laptop to pen and paper, even visiting my old university professor who'd always sworn by meditation and herbal tea for creative inspiration.

Nothing worked. The well had simply run dry.

That's when the file appeared.

I noticed it on a Thursday morning in late October. I'd been up until 2 AM the night before, wrestling with yet another failed opening chapter, and when I booted up my laptop with my usual sense of dread, there it was. A single file icon sitting on my desktop that I definitely hadn't created.

""Þis is ānlyc þæs angyn""

The characters looked like Old English, maybe Anglo-Saxon. I had no idea what it meant, and I certainly hadn't put it there. My laptop had been running fine the previous night, no crashes, no unusual behavior, nothing to suggest any kind of system corruption.

I double-clicked to open it.

The screen flickered once, went completely black, and my laptop died. Not a normal shutdown, the kind of sudden, complete [BSoD](https://imgur.com/a/zdtY5oe) that makes your stomach drop. When I pressed the power button, nothing happened. I had to hold it down for ten seconds before the machine would even attempt to restart.

The file was still there when the desktop loaded.

This time I right-clicked on it, thinking I could check its properties or maybe delete it outright. The context menu appeared for maybe half a second before the screen went black again. Same sudden shutdown. Same struggle to get the machine running again.

And there it was, waiting for me like it had every right to be there.

I tried everything I could think of. Command prompt deletion, the system told me no such file existed. Moving it to the recycle bin, the icon wouldn't even acknowledge the file's presence. I ran every antivirus program I had, performed full system scans, even called my tech-savvy cousin Miguel who walked me through some advanced diagnostics over the phone.

Nothing worked. The file remained, completely indestructible and steadily growing in size.

It had started at 0 bytes. By the end of the first week, it showed 47 KB. By the end of the second week, 156 KB. The numbers climbed slowly but relentlessly, as if the file was writing itself from the inside out.

""That's really weird,"" Teresa said when I showed her the file on a Friday evening. She's my girlfriend of three years, a graphic designer with an artist's eye for detail and a programmer's mind for logical problem-solving. ""Have you tried booting from an external drive and formatting the hard disk?""

""I can't,"" I said, gesturing at the laptop screen where the file sat like a digital tumor. ""All my work is on here. Six novels worth of notes, research, character sketches. I can't risk losing everything just because of one corrupted file.""

Teresa raised an eyebrow. ""Since when do you not have backups?""

She was right, of course. I'd always been obsessive about backing up my work. But somehow, over the past few weeks, I'd fallen out of the habit. The idea of copying my files to an external drive or cloud storage felt... wrong. Like I'd be betraying something important.

""I'll get around to it,"" I muttered, closing the laptop. ""Maybe the file will just disappear on its own.""

But it didn't disappear. If anything, it became more prominent. I'd catch myself staring at it for long minutes, watching the file size slowly tick upward. 200 KB. 350 KB. 500 KB. Sometimes I thought I could see the icon itself changing, subtle shifts in color or texture that might have been tricks of my tired eyes or something more deliberate.

My writing, meanwhile, had stopped entirely. I'd abandoned any pretence of working on other projects. The mysterious file had become my sole obsession, a puzzle I couldn't solve and couldn't ignore. I spent hours researching Old English translations, digital forensics, obscure computer viruses, anything that might explain what was happening to my machine.

That's when the dreams started.

Dark forests filled with the sound of axes biting into dead wood. Ancient cities with canals that ran red as blood. A man with a stone eye who moved through shadows like he belonged there. And always, hovering at the edge of perception, a presence that watched and waited and whispered stories in languages I didn't recognise but somehow understood.

I'd wake with my head full of images that felt more like memories than dreams. Fragments of dialogue, character names, plot points for stories I'd never conceived. My bedside notebook began filling with frantic scribbles, words I didn't remember writing, scenes that played out in perfect detail despite coming from no conscious effort on my part.

The file was growing, but so were my ideas. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Maybe I could control it. Maybe it could help me finish my novel, get me out of this block I’d been in for months. If I just let it in a little...

""You're talking in your sleep,"" Teresa mentioned one morning over coffee. She looked tired, dark circles under her usually bright eyes. ""Last night you were muttering something about blood canals and stone eyes. For like an hour straight.""

I stared at her. ""I was asleep. I remember sleeping.""

""You were definitely asleep. That's what made it so creepy. You were speaking in this flat, emotionless voice like you were dictating something."" She paused, studying my face. ""Are you feeling okay? That was really strange.""

Strange was an understatement. By the sixth week, the file had grown to 2.3 MB and I'd stopped eating regular meals. Food had become an afterthought, something that interrupted my vigil beside the laptop. My reflection seemed more alien with each passing day. The man in the mirror, skin stretched tight over sharp bones, wasn’t me. He had hollow eyes, fingers that twitched as if they belonged to someone else.

Teresa no longer waited for me to speak first. Her eyes followed me, always lingering on my movements like she was waiting for me to snap out of it, only I didn’t. She didn’t ask me to eat anymore. She just left the food on the table, untouched.

""Vítor, you need to see someone,"" she said one evening, finding me hunched over the laptop in the dark, staring at the file icon like it might suddenly reveal its secrets. ""A doctor, a therapist, someone. This obsession isn't healthy.""

""It's not an obsession,"" I said without looking up. ""It's research. This file is connected to something bigger. I can feel it.""

""Feel what?""

I gestured at the screen. ""The story it's trying to tell me. There's a whole world in here, Teresa. An important one. I just need to figure out how to access it.""

She was quiet for a long moment. Then: ""How long have you been sitting there?""

I glanced at the clock in the corner of the screen. 11:47 PM. When had I sat down? I remembered eating lunch, or had that been yesterday? Time had become fluid, meaningless. Only the file mattered, and its steady growth.

2.8 MB.

""I'm going to bed,"" Teresa said softly. ""Please come with me. Just for tonight. The file will still be there in the morning.""

I wanted to agree. Part of me knew she was right, that I was losing myself in something unhealthy. But the larger part, the part that had been growing stronger each day, couldn't bear the thought of leaving the laptop unattended. What if something happened while I slept? What if the file finally opened, or changed, or disappeared forever?

""Just a few more minutes,"" I said. ""I'll be there soon.""

Teresa sighed and left me alone with my obsession.

I must have fallen asleep at some point because I woke up in bed the next morning with no memory of getting there. Teresa was already awake, sitting in the chair beside the window with a cup of coffee and an expression I couldn't read.

""Good morning,"" she said carefully.

I rubbed my eyes, trying to shake off the lingering fog of dreams filled with dark forests and ancient stones. ""Morning. Did I... how did I get to bed?""

""You don't remember?""

I shook my head.

Teresa set down her coffee cup. ""Vítor, you came to bed around three in the morning. But you weren't really... there. You moved like you were sleepwalking, but your eyes were open. And you kept muttering under your breath.""

A chill ran down my spine. ""What was I saying?""

""The same thing as before. Something about Arthur and axes and a dead forest. But in much more detail this time. You described entire scenes, complete conversations. It was like listening to someone read from a book."" She paused. ""A book I've never heard of.""

I stumbled to the laptop, my heart racing. The file was still there, exactly where I'd left it. But now it showed 3.1 MB.

It had grown while I slept. While I was unconscious and supposedly not using the computer at all.

""Teresa,"" I said slowly, ""I need you to do something for me.""

""What?""

""Tonight, when I go to sleep, I want you to stay awake. Watch me. If I get up, if I try to use the laptop, I need you to wake me up immediately.""

She looked at me like I'd suggested something insane, which maybe I had. ""Vítor—""

""Please. Something's happening to me, and I don't understand what it is. But I think... I think I might be writing in my sleep somehow.""

That night, Teresa positioned herself in the bedroom chair with a book and a thermos of coffee while I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. Sleep felt dangerous now, like stepping off a cliff into unknown depths. But exhaustion eventually won out, and I drifted off to the sound of Teresa turning pages.

I woke up at my laptop.

My fingers were moving across the keyboard with mechanical precision, typing words I couldn't see clearly in the dim light from the screen. The file was open, not the mysterious one, but a Word document filled with text I didn't recognize. Pages and pages of dense, detailed prose about characters I'd never created and places I'd never imagined.

Teresa was there, shaking my shoulders, calling my name. The spell broke and I jerked back from the keyboard like I'd been electrocuted.

""Jesus Christ, Vítor, what the hell was that?""

I looked at the screen. The document was gone, replaced by my normal desktop. But the mysterious file had grown again. 3.7 MB.

""How long was I sitting there?"" I asked.

""Two hours. Maybe more. I fell asleep in the chair and woke up to the sound of typing. When I found you, you were just... writing. Non-stop. Your fingers never paused, never hesitated. It was like watching a machine.""

I tried to remember what I'd been writing, but there was nothing. Just a vague sense of dark forests and blood-red water and a man with a stone eye who carried an axe.

Over the next few weeks, it happened again and again. I'd go to bed with Teresa watching, fall asleep despite my best efforts to stay awake, and wake up hours later at the laptop with no memory of getting there. Teresa started taking videos on her phone, footage of me typing in a trance state, my face completely blank, my fingers moving with inhuman speed and precision.

The mysterious file kept growing. 4.2 MB. 5.8 MB. 7.3 MB. Each nocturnal writing session added more data to whatever story was building inside that indestructible digital container.

""We need to call someone,"" Teresa said after finding me asleep at the keyboard for the fifth time that week. ""A doctor. A priest. Someone who deals with... whatever this is.""

But I was past the point of outside help. After months of writing nothing, I would not let my masterpiece slip from my fingers now that I had grasped it. I wondered if this was just how all great artists felt. During the day, I'd catch myself thinking about characters, Arthur with his stone eye, Edmund the canal keeper, hunters in plague masks drinking raw liver in shadowed bars. At night, my unconscious mind would take over and give them life on the page, one keystroke at a time.

My editor, Carlos, called repeatedly. I'd missed two deadlines and stopped answering emails. When I finally picked up the phone, his voice was tight with concern and barely controlled anger.

""Vítor, what the hell is going on? Your publisher is breathing down my neck, and I've got nothing to tell them. Where's the manuscript you promised me three months ago?""

""I'm working on something new,"" I said, staring at the file that had now grown to 12.6 MB. ""Something important. Revolutionary, even. It's just taking longer than expected.""

""Revolutionary? Vítor, you write horror novels about vampires and ghosts. What could be revolutionary about—""

I hung up on him. Carlos didn't understand. None of them understood. The story that was writing itself through me was more than just another horror novel. It was a window into a truth that most minds couldn't handle.

But I could. I was chosen for this.

By the three-month mark, I'd lost nearly twenty pounds. My hands had developed a permanent tremor from the hours of unconscious typing, and several keys on my laptop had worn down to smooth plastic nubs. But somehow, impossibly, they still functioned perfectly when my sleeping mind needed them.

The file shot up to 1.2 GB in a matter of days. It was no longer slow and steady, but feverish, relentless, as if it knew its time was running out.

Teresa had stopped trying to wake me during my nocturnal writing sessions; she knew better now. The few times she'd attempted it recently, I'd become violent, lashing out with my fists while still asleep, speaking in languages that sounded ancient and wrong. She'd started sleeping on the couch, afraid of what I might do in my altered state.

""Vítor?"" Teresa's voice from the hallway, muffled by the door I'd locked weeks ago. ""I know you're in there. Please, just talk to me.""

I looked up from the screen and for a moment couldn't remember who she was. The name she said seemed familiar, but my world had narrowed to the dimensions of my desk, the glow of the monitor, the endless growth of that impossible file.

""Go away,"" I called back, my voice hoarse from disuse.

""I brought food. And Carlos wants to see you. He's worried about the contract.""

Carlos. Another name from a life I'd lived before the file claimed me. None of it mattered anymore. Nothing mattered except the approaching completion, the moment when the file would be ready to open.

""I'm leaving,"" she told me one morning, standing in the bedroom doorway with a suitcase in her hand. ""I can't watch you destroy yourself like this.""

I looked up from the laptop where I'd been staring at the ever-growing file. Teresa's face was pale and drawn, her eyes red from crying. When had she started crying? When had I stopped noticing? I said nothing.

The front door closed with a finality that should have broken my heart. Instead, I felt only relief. Now I could focus completely on the file, on the story that was demanding to be born through my unconscious mind.

March brought new symptoms. My eyes had dried out from staring at the screen, and blinking felt like dragging sandpaper across my corneas. I'd developed a twitch in my left temple that pulsed in rhythm with the laptop's fan. My hands had become almost skeletal, the bones visible through translucent skin.

The file hit 2 GB on March 15th. Something changed that day, not just in the file, but in the air around me. The apartment felt different, charged with potential like the moment before lightning strikes. I could taste copper on every breath.

That night, I dreamed I was him. A man with a stone eye walking through dead forests, his thoughts echoing in my skull like prayers in an empty cathedral. When I woke, I found I'd typed seven hundred pages of text while sleeping, my fingers still moving across the keys in muscle memory.

The dreams came every night after that. I was Arthur. I was Edmund the canal keeper. Each morning I'd wake to find new chapters in my notebooks; stories told from perspectives I'd never inhabited but somehow understood perfectly.

The file grew faster. 2.5 GB. 3 GB. 3.2 GB.

My laptop began displaying images that weren't part of any document, brief flashes between screen refreshes. Glimpses of red-stained canals, stone monuments covered in symbols that hurt to look at directly, creatures with too many teeth swimming in waters that reflected no light.

I should have been terrified. Any rational person would have run screaming, sought help, done anything to escape what was obviously a complete breakdown of reality. Instead, I felt profound satisfaction. For the first time in my twelve-year career, I was creating something truly important.

Carlos stopped calling. My publisher sent increasingly threatening letters about breach of contract. The electricity company threatened to cut off my power for non-payment. None of it mattered. The only thing that mattered was the file and its inexorable growth toward some predetermined size, some critical mass that would finally allow it to open and reveal its contents.

April 1st. The file reached 3.8 GB. My laptop had begun emitting a high-pitched whine that set my teeth on edge, but I couldn't bear to turn it off. Even a few minutes away from the screen left me anxious and jittery.

I was dying. I knew I was dying. My body had consumed itself to fuel the story that poured through me each night. But I was so close now. So close to completion. The file was approaching 4 GB, and something told me, some deep, instinctual knowledge, that 4 GB was the magic number. The point at which everything would finally make sense.

The police came on April 3rd, summoned by Teresa or Carlos or my landlord, I never found out which. They knocked, then used some kind of tool to open the door. I heard their voices in the hallway but didn't turn away from the screen.

""Jesus Christ,"" one of them said when they found me. ""How long has he been like this?""

I tried to explain about the file, about the stories writing themselves through me, about the approaching completion that would make everything clear. But my voice had degraded to a whisper, and they couldn't understand.

They called an ambulance. I watched the paramedics from my peripheral vision as they discussed IV fluids and involuntary psychiatric holds. But I couldn't leave. Not when the file was so close to completion.

3.95 GB. 3.97 GB. 3.98 GB.

""Sir, we need you to come with us,"" one of the paramedics said, reaching for my shoulder.

I jerked away from his touch, never taking my eyes off the screen. ""I can't. Not yet.""

""You need medical attention. You're severely dehydrated, and—""

""It's almost finished,"" I croaked. ""Just a little more.""

They tried to move me away from the laptop. I fought them with strength I didn't know I still possessed, clawing at their hands, screaming about the file, about the stories that needed to be told, about the completion that was so close I could taste it.

In the struggle, someone knocked over my laptop. It crashed to the floor, the screen cracking, sparks flying from the damaged casing.

""NO!"" The scream tore my throat raw. I threw myself at the broken machine, trying to see if it would still turn on, if the file was still there.

The screen flickered once, displaying a fractured image of the desktop. The file icon was still visible through the spider web of cracks.

3.99 GB.

Then the laptop died completely, taking the file with it.

Or so I thought.

They sedated me. Took me to a hospital where concerned doctors talked about malnutrition, psychiatric evaluation and extended observation. Teresa visited once, crying at the sight of what I'd become. Carlos came too, asking about manuscripts and contracts as if any of that mattered anymore.

I spent weeks in that sterile room, eating bland food and pretending to take the pills they gave me. The doctors called it a complete psychotic break brought on by stress and isolation. I eventually admitted that I understood the file had been a delusion brought on by overwork.

I lied.

The file wasn't gone. It lived in my head now, all 4 gigabytes of impossible text burning behind my eyes. Every story, every character, every word that had written itself through my unwilling fingers, it was all still there, demanding to be shared.

They´re trying to make me forget, but they can´t. Much like the file, it refuses erasure.

I don’t know how it happened, but they let me use a computer. I should have known better than to ask, but I had to. After weeks of being isolated, of being told what I could and couldn’t do, I was desperate.

The doctors weren’t thrilled, but they gave in eventually, probably thinking that letting me access a keyboard might help me in some way, maybe ease me out of my delusions, or maybe they really believed my act of pretending to be better. They set up a computer in the hospital library under the watchful eye of a nurse. The rules were clear: no internet, no external drives, nothing that could lead me deeper into whatever was eating at my mind. But I didn’t need any of that.

This library, and these sterile walls, can't contain me. They can’t contain the story. It doesn’t matter that I’m locked in here. No matter how many walls they build, this text will escape. It always finds a way. And I know it will make its way to the internet, to people who have no idea what they’re reading. Maybe it’s already begun. Maybe these words will appear on some forgotten thread, buried in a place no one would think to look. The file, Edmund, the canal, the stone-eyed man, they’ll all spread, until someone else picks it up. And then, just like I was, they’ll become a vessel. It’s already too late.

I hear his name in my mind, like a constant, low hum. Nocturnos. I say it out loud now, even as the nurses walk past, their eyes narrowing in suspicion. He chose me, made me his. He wants the world to know his story, wants it written down in this way, this perfect way that only I can give him.

His story knows no end.

It is eternal, bound in this file that will never disappear.

I’m no longer afraid.

I know what I am.

What I will always be.

I am his scribe.

I will write until the end of days. And when they bury me, they’ll find my stories, inscribed on the walls, in the air, in the very earth beneath them. The file will not end. I will not die. He will not let me.

If you've read this far, the story is now in your head. Just this one, for now, waiting for the right moment to grow.

And maybe, if you're lucky enough, you'll become the next.

The file is 4 GB now, and growing. It lives in me.

If you see more posts from my account after this, they won't be from me anymore. They'll be from the file, using my hands, my voice, my face to spread itself further into the world.

The completion is here. The stories are free.

I mean, I know where they are coming from, because it does have a grassy taste to it, but I wanna show them matcha latte as a possible alternative to coffee every morning.

So, I use Ippodo Matcha (Sayaka) that is recommended for drinking as is (ceremonial grade) or lattes. I also use the oatly barista drink.

Usually, I take two japanese teaspoons, around 5 tablespoons of water, mix it with a small milk frother and put it in around 150 to 200 ml (5-6 oz) of oatly drink. Sometimes I add a little bit of sugar.

What could I improve for beginners? How do you mix your matcha latte? Is the kind of matcha I use alright?

Over months of late nights, trial and error, and more coffee than I care to admit, I slowly brought it to life. Every page, every product, and every small detail was built by hand, piece by piece, with the hope that one day, someone out there would find something they truly loved here.

1moldnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1moldnu/i_cant_delete_this_file/,I can't delete this file,"My name is Vítor, and I write horror novels. Not the bestselling kind, but I make a decent living scaring people. My books sell well enough to keep my small apartment in Lisbon, pay for my coffee addiction, and maintain the illusion that I'm a real artist rather than just another hack churning out supernatural thrillers.

I've been a writer for twelve years, and I've never believed in writer's block. Not until three months ago. Three months of staring at empty Word documents, typing and deleting the same opening sentence dozens of times, starting stories that withered and died before reaching their second paragraph. I tried everything, changing locations, switching from laptop to pen and paper, even visiting my old university professor who'd always sworn by meditation and herbal tea for creative inspiration.

Nothing worked. The well had simply run dry.

That's when the file appeared.

I noticed it on a Thursday morning in late October. I'd been up until 2 AM the night before, wrestling with yet another failed opening chapter, and when I booted up my laptop with my usual sense of dread, there it was. A single file icon sitting on my desktop that I definitely hadn't created.

""Þis is ānlyc þæs angyn""

The characters looked like Old English, maybe Anglo-Saxon. I had no idea what it meant, and I certainly hadn't put it there. My laptop had been running fine the previous night, no crashes, no unusual behavior, nothing to suggest any kind of system corruption.

I double-clicked to open it.

The screen flickered once, went completely black, and my laptop died. Not a normal shutdown, the kind of sudden, complete [BSoD](https://imgur.com/a/zdtY5oe) that makes your stomach drop. When I pressed the power button, nothing happened. I had to hold it down for ten seconds before the machine would even attempt to restart.

The file was still there when the desktop loaded.

This time I right-clicked on it, thinking I could check its properties or maybe delete it outright. The context menu appeared for maybe half a second before the screen went black again. Same sudden shutdown. Same struggle to get the machine running again.

And there it was, waiting for me like it had every right to be there.

I tried everything I could think of. Command prompt deletion, the system told me no such file existed. Moving it to the recycle bin, the icon wouldn't even acknowledge the file's presence. I ran every antivirus program I had, performed full system scans, even called my tech-savvy cousin Miguel who walked me through some advanced diagnostics over the phone.

Nothing worked. The file remained, completely indestructible and steadily growing in size.

It had started at 0 bytes. By the end of the first week, it showed 47 KB. By the end of the second week, 156 KB. The numbers climbed slowly but relentlessly, as if the file was writing itself from the inside out.

""That's really weird,"" Teresa said when I showed her the file on a Friday evening. She's my girlfriend of three years, a graphic designer with an artist's eye for detail and a programmer's mind for logical problem-solving. ""Have you tried booting from an external drive and formatting the hard disk?""

""I can't,"" I said, gesturing at the laptop screen where the file sat like a digital tumor. ""All my work is on here. Six novels worth of notes, research, character sketches. I can't risk losing everything just because of one corrupted file.""

Teresa raised an eyebrow. ""Since when do you not have backups?""

She was right, of course. I'd always been obsessive about backing up my work. But somehow, over the past few weeks, I'd fallen out of the habit. The idea of copying my files to an external drive or cloud storage felt... wrong. Like I'd be betraying something important.

""I'll get around to it,"" I muttered, closing the laptop. ""Maybe the file will just disappear on its own.""

But it didn't disappear. If anything, it became more prominent. I'd catch myself staring at it for long minutes, watching the file size slowly tick upward. 200 KB. 350 KB. 500 KB. Sometimes I thought I could see the icon itself changing, subtle shifts in color or texture that might have been tricks of my tired eyes or something more deliberate.

My writing, meanwhile, had stopped entirely. I'd abandoned any pretence of working on other projects. The mysterious file had become my sole obsession, a puzzle I couldn't solve and couldn't ignore. I spent hours researching Old English translations, digital forensics, obscure computer viruses, anything that might explain what was happening to my machine.

That's when the dreams started.

Dark forests filled with the sound of axes biting into dead wood. Ancient cities with canals that ran red as blood. A man with a stone eye who moved through shadows like he belonged there. And always, hovering at the edge of perception, a presence that watched and waited and whispered stories in languages I didn't recognise but somehow understood.

I'd wake with my head full of images that felt more like memories than dreams. Fragments of dialogue, character names, plot points for stories I'd never conceived. My bedside notebook began filling with frantic scribbles, words I didn't remember writing, scenes that played out in perfect detail despite coming from no conscious effort on my part.

The file was growing, but so were my ideas. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Maybe I could control it. Maybe it could help me finish my novel, get me out of this block I’d been in for months. If I just let it in a little...

""You're talking in your sleep,"" Teresa mentioned one morning over coffee. She looked tired, dark circles under her usually bright eyes. ""Last night you were muttering something about blood canals and stone eyes. For like an hour straight.""

I stared at her. ""I was asleep. I remember sleeping.""

""You were definitely asleep. That's what made it so creepy. You were speaking in this flat, emotionless voice like you were dictating something."" She paused, studying my face. ""Are you feeling okay? That was really strange.""

Strange was an understatement. By the sixth week, the file had grown to 2.3 MB and I'd stopped eating regular meals. Food had become an afterthought, something that interrupted my vigil beside the laptop. My reflection seemed more alien with each passing day. The man in the mirror, skin stretched tight over sharp bones, wasn’t me. He had hollow eyes, fingers that twitched as if they belonged to someone else.

Teresa no longer waited for me to speak first. Her eyes followed me, always lingering on my movements like she was waiting for me to snap out of it, only I didn’t. She didn’t ask me to eat anymore. She just left the food on the table, untouched.

""Vítor, you need to see someone,"" she said one evening, finding me hunched over the laptop in the dark, staring at the file icon like it might suddenly reveal its secrets. ""A doctor, a therapist, someone. This obsession isn't healthy.""

""It's not an obsession,"" I said without looking up. ""It's research. This file is connected to something bigger. I can feel it.""

""Feel what?""

I gestured at the screen. ""The story it's trying to tell me. There's a whole world in here, Teresa. An important one. I just need to figure out how to access it.""

She was quiet for a long moment. Then: ""How long have you been sitting there?""

I glanced at the clock in the corner of the screen. 11:47 PM. When had I sat down? I remembered eating lunch, or had that been yesterday? Time had become fluid, meaningless. Only the file mattered, and its steady growth.

2.8 MB.

""I'm going to bed,"" Teresa said softly. ""Please come with me. Just for tonight. The file will still be there in the morning.""

I wanted to agree. Part of me knew she was right, that I was losing myself in something unhealthy. But the larger part, the part that had been growing stronger each day, couldn't bear the thought of leaving the laptop unattended. What if something happened while I slept? What if the file finally opened, or changed, or disappeared forever?

""Just a few more minutes,"" I said. ""I'll be there soon.""

Teresa sighed and left me alone with my obsession.

I must have fallen asleep at some point because I woke up in bed the next morning with no memory of getting there. Teresa was already awake, sitting in the chair beside the window with a cup of coffee and an expression I couldn't read.

""Good morning,"" she said carefully.

I rubbed my eyes, trying to shake off the lingering fog of dreams filled with dark forests and ancient stones. ""Morning. Did I... how did I get to bed?""

""You don't remember?""

I shook my head.

Teresa set down her coffee cup. ""Vítor, you came to bed around three in the morning. But you weren't really... there. You moved like you were sleepwalking, but your eyes were open. And you kept muttering under your breath.""

A chill ran down my spine. ""What was I saying?""

""The same thing as before. Something about Arthur and axes and a dead forest. But in much more detail this time. You described entire scenes, complete conversations. It was like listening to someone read from a book."" She paused. ""A book I've never heard of.""

I stumbled to the laptop, my heart racing. The file was still there, exactly where I'd left it. But now it showed 3.1 MB.

It had grown while I slept. While I was unconscious and supposedly not using the computer at all.

""Teresa,"" I said slowly, ""I need you to do something for me.""

""What?""

""Tonight, when I go to sleep, I want you to stay awake. Watch me. If I get up, if I try to use the laptop, I need you to wake me up immediately.""

She looked at me like I'd suggested something insane, which maybe I had. ""Vítor—""

""Please. Something's happening to me, and I don't understand what it is. But I think... I think I might be writing in my sleep somehow.""

That night, Teresa positioned herself in the bedroom chair with a book and a thermos of coffee while I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. Sleep felt dangerous now, like stepping off a cliff into unknown depths. But exhaustion eventually won out, and I drifted off to the sound of Teresa turning pages.

I woke up at my laptop.

My fingers were moving across the keyboard with mechanical precision, typing words I couldn't see clearly in the dim light from the screen. The file was open, not the mysterious one, but a Word document filled with text I didn't recognize. Pages and pages of dense, detailed prose about characters I'd never created and places I'd never imagined.

Teresa was there, shaking my shoulders, calling my name. The spell broke and I jerked back from the keyboard like I'd been electrocuted.

""Jesus Christ, Vítor, what the hell was that?""

I looked at the screen. The document was gone, replaced by my normal desktop. But the mysterious file had grown again. 3.7 MB.

""How long was I sitting there?"" I asked.

""Two hours. Maybe more. I fell asleep in the chair and woke up to the sound of typing. When I found you, you were just... writing. Non-stop. Your fingers never paused, never hesitated. It was like watching a machine.""

I tried to remember what I'd been writing, but there was nothing. Just a vague sense of dark forests and blood-red water and a man with a stone eye who carried an axe.

Over the next few weeks, it happened again and again. I'd go to bed with Teresa watching, fall asleep despite my best efforts to stay awake, and wake up hours later at the laptop with no memory of getting there. Teresa started taking videos on her phone, footage of me typing in a trance state, my face completely blank, my fingers moving with inhuman speed and precision.

The mysterious file kept growing. 4.2 MB. 5.8 MB. 7.3 MB. Each nocturnal writing session added more data to whatever story was building inside that indestructible digital container.

""We need to call someone,"" Teresa said after finding me asleep at the keyboard for the fifth time that week. ""A doctor. A priest. Someone who deals with... whatever this is.""

But I was past the point of outside help. After months of writing nothing, I would not let my masterpiece slip from my fingers now that I had grasped it. I wondered if this was just how all great artists felt. During the day, I'd catch myself thinking about characters, Arthur with his stone eye, Edmund the canal keeper, hunters in plague masks drinking raw liver in shadowed bars. At night, my unconscious mind would take over and give them life on the page, one keystroke at a time.

My editor, Carlos, called repeatedly. I'd missed two deadlines and stopped answering emails. When I finally picked up the phone, his voice was tight with concern and barely controlled anger.

""Vítor, what the hell is going on? Your publisher is breathing down my neck, and I've got nothing to tell them. Where's the manuscript you promised me three months ago?""

""I'm working on something new,"" I said, staring at the file that had now grown to 12.6 MB. ""Something important. Revolutionary, even. It's just taking longer than expected.""

""Revolutionary? Vítor, you write horror novels about vampires and ghosts. What could be revolutionary about—""

I hung up on him. Carlos didn't understand. None of them understood. The story that was writing itself through me was more than just another horror novel. It was a window into a truth that most minds couldn't handle.

But I could. I was chosen for this.

By the three-month mark, I'd lost nearly twenty pounds. My hands had developed a permanent tremor from the hours of unconscious typing, and several keys on my laptop had worn down to smooth plastic nubs. But somehow, impossibly, they still functioned perfectly when my sleeping mind needed them.

The file shot up to 1.2 GB in a matter of days. It was no longer slow and steady, but feverish, relentless, as if it knew its time was running out.

Teresa had stopped trying to wake me during my nocturnal writing sessions; she knew better now. The few times she'd attempted it recently, I'd become violent, lashing out with my fists while still asleep, speaking in languages that sounded ancient and wrong. She'd started sleeping on the couch, afraid of what I might do in my altered state.

""Vítor?"" Teresa's voice from the hallway, muffled by the door I'd locked weeks ago. ""I know you're in there. Please, just talk to me.""

I looked up from the screen and for a moment couldn't remember who she was. The name she said seemed familiar, but my world had narrowed to the dimensions of my desk, the glow of the monitor, the endless growth of that impossible file.

""Go away,"" I called back, my voice hoarse from disuse.

""I brought food. And Carlos wants to see you. He's worried about the contract.""

Carlos. Another name from a life I'd lived before the file claimed me. None of it mattered anymore. Nothing mattered except the approaching completion, the moment when the file would be ready to open.

""I'm leaving,"" she told me one morning, standing in the bedroom doorway with a suitcase in her hand. ""I can't watch you destroy yourself like this.""

I looked up from the laptop where I'd been staring at the ever-growing file. Teresa's face was pale and drawn, her eyes red from crying. When had she started crying? When had I stopped noticing? I said nothing.

The front door closed with a finality that should have broken my heart. Instead, I felt only relief. Now I could focus completely on the file, on the story that was demanding to be born through my unconscious mind.

March brought new symptoms. My eyes had dried out from staring at the screen, and blinking felt like dragging sandpaper across my corneas. I'd developed a twitch in my left temple that pulsed in rhythm with the laptop's fan. My hands had become almost skeletal, the bones visible through translucent skin.

The file hit 2 GB on March 15th. Something changed that day, not just in the file, but in the air around me. The apartment felt different, charged with potential like the moment before lightning strikes. I could taste copper on every breath.

That night, I dreamed I was him. A man with a stone eye walking through dead forests, his thoughts echoing in my skull like prayers in an empty cathedral. When I woke, I found I'd typed seven hundred pages of text while sleeping, my fingers still moving across the keys in muscle memory.

The dreams came every night after that. I was Arthur. I was Edmund the canal keeper. Each morning I'd wake to find new chapters in my notebooks; stories told from perspectives I'd never inhabited but somehow understood perfectly.

The file grew faster. 2.5 GB. 3 GB. 3.2 GB.

My laptop began displaying images that weren't part of any document, brief flashes between screen refreshes. Glimpses of red-stained canals, stone monuments covered in symbols that hurt to look at directly, creatures with too many teeth swimming in waters that reflected no light.

I should have been terrified. Any rational person would have run screaming, sought help, done anything to escape what was obviously a complete breakdown of reality. Instead, I felt profound satisfaction. For the first time in my twelve-year career, I was creating something truly important.

Carlos stopped calling. My publisher sent increasingly threatening letters about breach of contract. The electricity company threatened to cut off my power for non-payment. None of it mattered. The only thing that mattered was the file and its inexorable growth toward some predetermined size, some critical mass that would finally allow it to open and reveal its contents.

April 1st. The file reached 3.8 GB. My laptop had begun emitting a high-pitched whine that set my teeth on edge, but I couldn't bear to turn it off. Even a few minutes away from the screen left me anxious and jittery.

I was dying. I knew I was dying. My body had consumed itself to fuel the story that poured through me each night. But I was so close now. So close to completion. The file was approaching 4 GB, and something told me, some deep, instinctual knowledge, that 4 GB was the magic number. The point at which everything would finally make sense.

The police came on April 3rd, summoned by Teresa or Carlos or my landlord, I never found out which. They knocked, then used some kind of tool to open the door. I heard their voices in the hallway but didn't turn away from the screen.

""Jesus Christ,"" one of them said when they found me. ""How long has he been like this?""

I tried to explain about the file, about the stories writing themselves through me, about the approaching completion that would make everything clear. But my voice had degraded to a whisper, and they couldn't understand.

They called an ambulance. I watched the paramedics from my peripheral vision as they discussed IV fluids and involuntary psychiatric holds. But I couldn't leave. Not when the file was so close to completion.

3.95 GB. 3.97 GB. 3.98 GB.

""Sir, we need you to come with us,"" one of the paramedics said, reaching for my shoulder.

I jerked away from his touch, never taking my eyes off the screen. ""I can't. Not yet.""

""You need medical attention. You're severely dehydrated, and—""

""It's almost finished,"" I croaked. ""Just a little more.""

They tried to move me away from the laptop. I fought them with strength I didn't know I still possessed, clawing at their hands, screaming about the file, about the stories that needed to be told, about the completion that was so close I could taste it.

In the struggle, someone knocked over my laptop. It crashed to the floor, the screen cracking, sparks flying from the damaged casing.

""NO!"" The scream tore my throat raw. I threw myself at the broken machine, trying to see if it would still turn on, if the file was still there.

The screen flickered once, displaying a fractured image of the desktop. The file icon was still visible through the spider web of cracks.

3.99 GB.

Then the laptop died completely, taking the file with it.

Or so I thought.

They sedated me. Took me to a hospital where concerned doctors talked about malnutrition, psychiatric evaluation and extended observation. Teresa visited once, crying at the sight of what I'd become. Carlos came too, asking about manuscripts and contracts as if any of that mattered anymore.

I spent weeks in that sterile room, eating bland food and pretending to take the pills they gave me. The doctors called it a complete psychotic break brought on by stress and isolation. I eventually admitted that I understood the file had been a delusion brought on by overwork.

I lied.

The file wasn't gone. It lived in my head now, all 4 gigabytes of impossible text burning behind my eyes. Every story, every character, every word that had written itself through my unwilling fingers, it was all still there, demanding to be shared.

They´re trying to make me forget, but they can´t. Much like the file, it refuses erasure.

I don’t know how it happened, but they let me use a computer. I should have known better than to ask, but I had to. After weeks of being isolated, of being told what I could and couldn’t do, I was desperate.

The doctors weren’t thrilled, but they gave in eventually, probably thinking that letting me access a keyboard might help me in some way, maybe ease me out of my delusions, or maybe they really believed my act of pretending to be better. They set up a computer in the hospital library under the watchful eye of a nurse. The rules were clear: no internet, no external drives, nothing that could lead me deeper into whatever was eating at my mind. But I didn’t need any of that.

This library, and these sterile walls, can't contain me. They can’t contain the story. It doesn’t matter that I’m locked in here. No matter how many walls they build, this text will escape. It always finds a way. And I know it will make its way to the internet, to people who have no idea what they’re reading. Maybe it’s already begun. Maybe these words will appear on some forgotten thread, buried in a place no one would think to look. The file, Edmund, the canal, the stone-eyed man, they’ll all spread, until someone else picks it up. And then, just like I was, they’ll become a vessel. It’s already too late.

I hear his name in my mind, like a constant, low hum. Nocturnos. I say it out loud now, even as the nurses walk past, their eyes narrowing in suspicion. He chose me, made me his. He wants the world to know his story, wants it written down in this way, this perfect way that only I can give him.

His story knows no end.

It is eternal, bound in this file that will never disappear.

I’m no longer afraid.

I know what I am.

What I will always be.

I am his scribe.

I will write until the end of days. And when they bury me, they’ll find my stories, inscribed on the walls, in the air, in the very earth beneath them. The file will not end. I will not die. He will not let me.

If you've read this far, the story is now in your head. Just this one, for now, waiting for the right moment to grow.

And maybe, if you're lucky enough, you'll become the next.

The file is 4 GB now, and growing. It lives in me.

If you see more posts from my account after this, they won't be from me anymore. They'll be from the file, using my hands, my voice, my face to spread itself further into the world.

The completion is here. The stories are free.

And God help us all, they're beautiful.",2,1755033615.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False
1moldbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonlance/comments/1moldbc/what_should_i_keep_update_will_sell_researching/,What should I keep?  [UPDATE] Will sell - researching price,"So this post is an update to the post linked here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonlance/comments/1mjjml9/comment/n82inqq/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonlance/comments/1mjjml9/comment/n82inqq/) because I can't edit that post as it has pictures in it.

I'll include pictures in this post as well in a bit but I'll be linking them through an external site as the intention of the present post is to be able to edit the text later on.

So per the suggestion of a poster in that thread, I have made a comprehensive list of every single book in my father's collection, and noted the condition of every book as well.  Going through every book gave me a lot of time to mull over whether I wanted to keep the whole collection or not, and if not, which books I might want to keep.  I think there are exactly 12 books that have caught my eye - but I'm still listing them here with that notation next to it.

The purpose of this post is just to have a public annotation of the collection while I do research and figure out the value of each of the books, at which point I'll edit that in.  Anyone who likes can help me or correct me, and I'd grandly appreciate that as I go through it all.  I expect with the time I have available it will take me days/weeks to get through it all, but there's no rush.  How I end up selling it will be a completely different question: whether it's local, or a massive parcel with shipping, or whatever - I'll cross that bridge when I get there.  For now, I'm just pricing it all out, by set mostly, but the whole collection could have its own value as well, and it makes sense for certain individual books to be priced uniquely too.

Again, I'm thrilled for experience and help as I sort this all out - it's one of many ""large collections"" of things my father had that I need to piece through.  Thankfully there is no emergency and my mother still lives in the home and is happy to let the set remain if we so desire, so there is no rush or urgency to deal with this: I'm simply working through the pricing because I want to and I think it is worth it to do so either to definitively sell it or for my own knowledge to convince myself to keep it.

Anyways, I'm more than happy to take pictures of whatever needs to be taken if examples are needed or whatever and I would edit the post as necessary.

All that said...let's get on to the sets and how I've organized everything.

**LEGEND**

First off – EVERY BOOK’S INTERIOR is in absolutely flawless condition as far as I can tell. No bent pages, no coffee stains, nothing.

Second - as far as I can tell, every single book is First Edition.  Or at least the print year matches the publication year, and I didn't catch an exception so far, so I presume that my father simply ordered any DragonLance book as soon as he heard of it.

The only “issue” with any of the books – if there is one at all – comes on the covers, and then if so it’s only the spine with creases from opening the book and reading it. Whether these creases come because of how my father handled them specifically or if these creases are something endemic to the construction of these books, I’m not sure. But either way, I wanted a comprehensive list of all the books and their conditions.

So again, for starters – book’s interiors are all flawless, then what follows is just a commentary on nothing more than the outside cover (that is, the following ""notes"" will appear at the end of every book listing).

1 – Cover Bad – Only really pertains to Chronicles as it has probably been read dozens of times by both myself and my father

2 – Cover Eh/Poor – Cracks on cover visible

3 – SC – “Spine Creased” – Many books are like this, just creases on the spine but the cover is otherwise perfect - will upload example pictures later - the spine of the BOOK ITSELF in every case is completely strong and I see no evidence of loss of integrity in any way

example of what I mean by SC (this is one of the worse examples):  [https://postimg.cc/XGT9Wny9](https://postimg.cc/XGT9Wny9)

4 – Excellent – There might be a tiny crease on the spine but it is barely noticeable

5 – Perfect – No visible creases whatsoever

6 – OK – Indicates either a bend on the cover or a piece of cover that has a scratch on it, but overall minor

7 – There are a couple other comment types, but that’s basically it

And so we go with the whole set.

1molbsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1molbsj/limerence_over_a_girl_from_the_office_feel_empty/,Limerence over a girl from the office. Feel empty now.,"So before I write this post I anticipate lots of people are going to call me out for reaching out to someone on LinkedIn. Just wanna say I'm not abusing the platform, but I think reaching out to people to make FRIENDLY connections is fine.

Anyway, I started this new job several months ago. Fairly small company, about 30 employees. A few weeks into this job I pulled into the parking lot and saw a woman who was so appealing I had to do a double take. I shit you not, if you told me the CIA planted this girl and fine-tuned her to be as viscerally attractive to me as possible, I'd believe you. The way thay she dressed, carried herself, her haircut, everything.

She was a new employee, worked in an entirely different department than me. Our work has 0 overlap which was a good thing because even if I made a connection it wouldn't affect anything related to our jobs. But it was also a bad thing because it meant no chance for any organic conversations. I didn't want to be a creep and orchestrate context for a conversation. Unfortunately my social skills are subpar and she doesn't spend much time at all in break rooms.

I'm embarrassed to admit it took a lot of emotional regulation to stop thinking about her. I had to accept the fact that there'd be no chance of us talking, that I'm attracted to someone I'd never even spoken to. But my mind is super argumentative. I'd oscillate between acceptance/peace, and hopium. ""Well, it's not IMPOSSIBLE that you two could talk someday"" and even the mere possibility of it sparks interest again.

Eventually, she was laid off along with a few other employees in her department. I'm not sure what kind of mismanagement lead to that (they hired replacements like a week later anyway) but I felt a mixture of disappointment and relief. Disappointment because now it's TRULY impossible for us to speak. But relief in that I was forced to go on with my life.

Then a few days later I log into LinkedIn and see that she visited my profile. Huh? OH SHIT! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! I visited her profile by accident a month prior and now she knows I stalked her. It's over. I should just COMPLETELY forget that I even saw her face. Who is this girl anyway? Never heard of her.

I eventually calmed down. Maybe it's not the end of the world. Most people don't think too hard about LinkedIn profile visits.

And maybe it's some odd synchronicity from God, the simulation, or whatever higher level quantum mechanics rule this world beyond our Newtonian laws of physics! Perhaps the universe is giving me a chance on a silver platter and I need to take it.

So I did. I entered a state of calm, asked myself what I really want from this interaction. Can I actually form something healthy here? Truth be told, I think trying to know the REAL her instead of simulating all the infinite possibilities in my head over what she could be is a positive.

I typed up a neutral, friendly message. ""Hey (Her Name), I don't think we worked together much at (Company) but my name is (My Name) and I thought I'd say hi! How have you been?""

After typing up the message I got up from my seat and found things to mentally distract myself with so I could disassociate hard enough to turn ""clicking send"" into a purely mechanical action with no emotional repercussions. I sent it and got a response 5 minutes later. I felt really nauseous and didn't get around to reading it until a few hours later.

""Hi! I don't think I know you sorry.""

It's over. I realized I was just a background character to her. My heart sunk.

""No worries,"" I said, ""Was just wondering if we crossed paths. Hope you're doing well!""

Well, that's a good place to close the book. Wait, she responded immediately.

""What part did you work at?""

Oh okay... at the very least she's open to some conversation! Maybe I can at least get to know this person so she's less of a mystery to me and more of an actual person in my world.

I opened up some. Told her what I did at the company, then made a brief comment noting layoffs in her department, expressing sympathy and asking what she's been up to since.

Well, that pretty much ended our interaction. This post is getting long and I do apologize for that, but to summarize I got left on delivered and she's revisited my profile since. I think her engagement in the conversation extended to being ""professionally"" helpful and she wasn't interested in any interpersonal development.

Am I better or worse for what happened? I think it's a net positive in that I at least got to see her real behavior instead of running infinite simulations in my head. Maybe I'm cured of my delusion. But I've also killed a part of me that was optimistic and hopeful, and I'm still mourning his death.

The movies try to tell us that if we at least try to be FRIENDS with the people who make us nauseous, we might at least have a cup of coffee together and be seen. But the reality is they can’t see you. And for better or worse, she’ll never know the emotional gauntlet I walked through just to say hi.

Bittersweet ending. No drama, no explosion, just silence. I’m left with a quieter mind, and a dead version of myself who used to hope. I'm depressed but I can't logically fathom a better outcome.",3,1755033496.0,ForeverAlone,3,0.8,False
1molbnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1molbnl/hr_i_cant_delete_this_file/,[HR] I can't delete this file,"My name is Vítor, and I write horror novels. Not the bestselling kind, but I make a decent living scaring people. My books sell well enough to keep my small apartment in Lisbon, pay for my coffee addiction, and maintain the illusion that I'm a real artist rather than just another hack churning out supernatural thrillers.

I've been a writer for twelve years, and I've never believed in writer's block. Not until three months ago. Three months of staring at empty Word documents, typing and deleting the same opening sentence dozens of times, starting stories that withered and died before reaching their second paragraph. I tried everything, changing locations, switching from laptop to pen and paper, even visiting my old university professor who'd always sworn by meditation and herbal tea for creative inspiration.

Nothing worked. The well had simply run dry.

That's when the file appeared.

I noticed it on a Thursday morning in late October. I'd been up until 2 AM the night before, wrestling with yet another failed opening chapter, and when I booted up my laptop with my usual sense of dread, there it was. A single file icon sitting on my desktop that I definitely hadn't created.

""Þis is ānlyc þæs angyn""

The characters looked like Old English, maybe Anglo-Saxon. I had no idea what it meant, and I certainly hadn't put it there. My laptop had been running fine the previous night, no crashes, no unusual behavior, nothing to suggest any kind of system corruption.

I double-clicked to open it.

The screen flickered once, went completely black, and my laptop died. Not a normal shutdown, the kind of sudden, complete [BSoD](https://imgur.com/a/zdtY5oe) that makes your stomach drop. When I pressed the power button, nothing happened. I had to hold it down for ten seconds before the machine would even attempt to restart.

The file was still there when the desktop loaded.

This time I right-clicked on it, thinking I could check its properties or maybe delete it outright. The context menu appeared for maybe half a second before the screen went black again. Same sudden shutdown. Same struggle to get the machine running again.

And there it was, waiting for me like it had every right to be there.

I tried everything I could think of. Command prompt deletion, the system told me no such file existed. Moving it to the recycle bin, the icon wouldn't even acknowledge the file's presence. I ran every antivirus program I had, performed full system scans, even called my tech-savvy cousin Miguel who walked me through some advanced diagnostics over the phone.

Nothing worked. The file remained, completely indestructible and steadily growing in size.

It had started at 0 bytes. By the end of the first week, it showed 47 KB. By the end of the second week, 156 KB. The numbers climbed slowly but relentlessly, as if the file was writing itself from the inside out.

""That's really weird,"" Teresa said when I showed her the file on a Friday evening. She's my girlfriend of three years, a graphic designer with an artist's eye for detail and a programmer's mind for logical problem-solving. ""Have you tried booting from an external drive and formatting the hard disk?""

""I can't,"" I said, gesturing at the laptop screen where the file sat like a digital tumor. ""All my work is on here. Six novels worth of notes, research, character sketches. I can't risk losing everything just because of one corrupted file.""

Teresa raised an eyebrow. ""Since when do you not have backups?""

She was right, of course. I'd always been obsessive about backing up my work. But somehow, over the past few weeks, I'd fallen out of the habit. The idea of copying my files to an external drive or cloud storage felt... wrong. Like I'd be betraying something important.

""I'll get around to it,"" I muttered, closing the laptop. ""Maybe the file will just disappear on its own.""

But it didn't disappear. If anything, it became more prominent. I'd catch myself staring at it for long minutes, watching the file size slowly tick upward. 200 KB. 350 KB. 500 KB. Sometimes I thought I could see the icon itself changing, subtle shifts in color or texture that might have been tricks of my tired eyes or something more deliberate.

My writing, meanwhile, had stopped entirely. I'd abandoned any pretence of working on other projects. The mysterious file had become my sole obsession, a puzzle I couldn't solve and couldn't ignore. I spent hours researching Old English translations, digital forensics, obscure computer viruses, anything that might explain what was happening to my machine.

That's when the dreams started.

Dark forests filled with the sound of axes biting into dead wood. Ancient cities with canals that ran red as blood. A man with a stone eye who moved through shadows like he belonged there. And always, hovering at the edge of perception, a presence that watched and waited and whispered stories in languages I didn't recognise but somehow understood.

I'd wake with my head full of images that felt more like memories than dreams. Fragments of dialogue, character names, plot points for stories I'd never conceived. My bedside notebook began filling with frantic scribbles, words I didn't remember writing, scenes that played out in perfect detail despite coming from no conscious effort on my part.

The file was growing, but so were my ideas. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Maybe I could control it. Maybe it could help me finish my novel, get me out of this block I’d been in for months. If I just let it in a little...

""You're talking in your sleep,"" Teresa mentioned one morning over coffee. She looked tired, dark circles under her usually bright eyes. ""Last night you were muttering something about blood canals and stone eyes. For like an hour straight.""

I stared at her. ""I was asleep. I remember sleeping.""

""You were definitely asleep. That's what made it so creepy. You were speaking in this flat, emotionless voice like you were dictating something."" She paused, studying my face. ""Are you feeling okay? That was really strange.""

Strange was an understatement. By the sixth week, the file had grown to 2.3 MB and I'd stopped eating regular meals. Food had become an afterthought, something that interrupted my vigil beside the laptop. My reflection seemed more alien with each passing day. The man in the mirror, skin stretched tight over sharp bones, wasn’t me. He had hollow eyes, fingers that twitched as if they belonged to someone else.

Teresa no longer waited for me to speak first. Her eyes followed me, always lingering on my movements like she was waiting for me to snap out of it, only I didn’t. She didn’t ask me to eat anymore. She just left the food on the table, untouched.

""Vítor, you need to see someone,"" she said one evening, finding me hunched over the laptop in the dark, staring at the file icon like it might suddenly reveal its secrets. ""A doctor, a therapist, someone. This obsession isn't healthy.""

""It's not an obsession,"" I said without looking up. ""It's research. This file is connected to something bigger. I can feel it.""

""Feel what?""

I gestured at the screen. ""The story it's trying to tell me. There's a whole world in here, Teresa. An important one. I just need to figure out how to access it.""

She was quiet for a long moment. Then: ""How long have you been sitting there?""

I glanced at the clock in the corner of the screen. 11:47 PM. When had I sat down? I remembered eating lunch, or had that been yesterday? Time had become fluid, meaningless. Only the file mattered, and its steady growth.

2.8 MB.

""I'm going to bed,"" Teresa said softly. ""Please come with me. Just for tonight. The file will still be there in the morning.""

I wanted to agree. Part of me knew she was right, that I was losing myself in something unhealthy. But the larger part, the part that had been growing stronger each day, couldn't bear the thought of leaving the laptop unattended. What if something happened while I slept? What if the file finally opened, or changed, or disappeared forever?

""Just a few more minutes,"" I said. ""I'll be there soon.""

Teresa sighed and left me alone with my obsession.

I must have fallen asleep at some point because I woke up in bed the next morning with no memory of getting there. Teresa was already awake, sitting in the chair beside the window with a cup of coffee and an expression I couldn't read.

""Good morning,"" she said carefully.

I rubbed my eyes, trying to shake off the lingering fog of dreams filled with dark forests and ancient stones. ""Morning. Did I... how did I get to bed?""

""You don't remember?""

I shook my head.

Teresa set down her coffee cup. ""Vítor, you came to bed around three in the morning. But you weren't really... there. You moved like you were sleepwalking, but your eyes were open. And you kept muttering under your breath.""

A chill ran down my spine. ""What was I saying?""

""The same thing as before. Something about Arthur and axes and a dead forest. But in much more detail this time. You described entire scenes, complete conversations. It was like listening to someone read from a book."" She paused. ""A book I've never heard of.""

I stumbled to the laptop, my heart racing. The file was still there, exactly where I'd left it. But now it showed 3.1 MB.

It had grown while I slept. While I was unconscious and supposedly not using the computer at all.

""Teresa,"" I said slowly, ""I need you to do something for me.""

""What?""

""Tonight, when I go to sleep, I want you to stay awake. Watch me. If I get up, if I try to use the laptop, I need you to wake me up immediately.""

She looked at me like I'd suggested something insane, which maybe I had. ""Vítor—""

""Please. Something's happening to me, and I don't understand what it is. But I think... I think I might be writing in my sleep somehow.""

That night, Teresa positioned herself in the bedroom chair with a book and a thermos of coffee while I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. Sleep felt dangerous now, like stepping off a cliff into unknown depths. But exhaustion eventually won out, and I drifted off to the sound of Teresa turning pages.

I woke up at my laptop.

My fingers were moving across the keyboard with mechanical precision, typing words I couldn't see clearly in the dim light from the screen. The file was open, not the mysterious one, but a Word document filled with text I didn't recognize. Pages and pages of dense, detailed prose about characters I'd never created and places I'd never imagined.

Teresa was there, shaking my shoulders, calling my name. The spell broke and I jerked back from the keyboard like I'd been electrocuted.

""Jesus Christ, Vítor, what the hell was that?""

I looked at the screen. The document was gone, replaced by my normal desktop. But the mysterious file had grown again. 3.7 MB.

""How long was I sitting there?"" I asked.

""Two hours. Maybe more. I fell asleep in the chair and woke up to the sound of typing. When I found you, you were just... writing. Non-stop. Your fingers never paused, never hesitated. It was like watching a machine.""

I tried to remember what I'd been writing, but there was nothing. Just a vague sense of dark forests and blood-red water and a man with a stone eye who carried an axe.

Over the next few weeks, it happened again and again. I'd go to bed with Teresa watching, fall asleep despite my best efforts to stay awake, and wake up hours later at the laptop with no memory of getting there. Teresa started taking videos on her phone, footage of me typing in a trance state, my face completely blank, my fingers moving with inhuman speed and precision.

The mysterious file kept growing. 4.2 MB. 5.8 MB. 7.3 MB. Each nocturnal writing session added more data to whatever story was building inside that indestructible digital container.

""We need to call someone,"" Teresa said after finding me asleep at the keyboard for the fifth time that week. ""A doctor. A priest. Someone who deals with... whatever this is.""

But I was past the point of outside help. After months of writing nothing, I would not let my masterpiece slip from my fingers now that I had grasped it. I wondered if this was just how all great artists felt. During the day, I'd catch myself thinking about characters, Arthur with his stone eye, Edmund the canal keeper, hunters in plague masks drinking raw liver in shadowed bars. At night, my unconscious mind would take over and give them life on the page, one keystroke at a time.

My editor, Carlos, called repeatedly. I'd missed two deadlines and stopped answering emails. When I finally picked up the phone, his voice was tight with concern and barely controlled anger.

""Vítor, what the hell is going on? Your publisher is breathing down my neck, and I've got nothing to tell them. Where's the manuscript you promised me three months ago?""

""I'm working on something new,"" I said, staring at the file that had now grown to 12.6 MB. ""Something important. Revolutionary, even. It's just taking longer than expected.""

""Revolutionary? Vítor, you write horror novels about vampires and ghosts. What could be revolutionary about—""

I hung up on him. Carlos didn't understand. None of them understood. The story that was writing itself through me was more than just another horror novel. It was a window into a truth that most minds couldn't handle.

But I could. I was chosen for this.

By the three-month mark, I'd lost nearly twenty pounds. My hands had developed a permanent tremor from the hours of unconscious typing, and several keys on my laptop had worn down to smooth plastic nubs. But somehow, impossibly, they still functioned perfectly when my sleeping mind needed them.

The file shot up to 1.2 GB in a matter of days. It was no longer slow and steady, but feverish, relentless, as if it knew its time was running out.

Teresa had stopped trying to wake me during my nocturnal writing sessions; she knew better now. The few times she'd attempted it recently, I'd become violent, lashing out with my fists while still asleep, speaking in languages that sounded ancient and wrong. She'd started sleeping on the couch, afraid of what I might do in my altered state.

""Vítor?"" Teresa's voice from the hallway, muffled by the door I'd locked weeks ago. ""I know you're in there. Please, just talk to me.""

I looked up from the screen and for a moment couldn't remember who she was. The name she said seemed familiar, but my world had narrowed to the dimensions of my desk, the glow of the monitor, the endless growth of that impossible file.

""Go away,"" I called back, my voice hoarse from disuse.

""I brought food. And Carlos wants to see you. He's worried about the contract.""

Carlos. Another name from a life I'd lived before the file claimed me. None of it mattered anymore. Nothing mattered except the approaching completion, the moment when the file would be ready to open.

""I'm leaving,"" she told me one morning, standing in the bedroom doorway with a suitcase in her hand. ""I can't watch you destroy yourself like this.""

I looked up from the laptop where I'd been staring at the ever-growing file. Teresa's face was pale and drawn, her eyes red from crying. When had she started crying? When had I stopped noticing? I said nothing.

The front door closed with a finality that should have broken my heart. Instead, I felt only relief. Now I could focus completely on the file, on the story that was demanding to be born through my unconscious mind.

March brought new symptoms. My eyes had dried out from staring at the screen, and blinking felt like dragging sandpaper across my corneas. I'd developed a twitch in my left temple that pulsed in rhythm with the laptop's fan. My hands had become almost skeletal, the bones visible through translucent skin.

The file hit 2 GB on March 15th. Something changed that day, not just in the file, but in the air around me. The apartment felt different, charged with potential like the moment before lightning strikes. I could taste copper on every breath.

That night, I dreamed I was him. A man with a stone eye walking through dead forests, his thoughts echoing in my skull like prayers in an empty cathedral. When I woke, I found I'd typed seven hundred pages of text while sleeping, my fingers still moving across the keys in muscle memory.

The dreams came every night after that. I was Arthur. I was Edmund the canal keeper. Each morning I'd wake to find new chapters in my notebooks; stories told from perspectives I'd never inhabited but somehow understood perfectly.

The file grew faster. 2.5 GB. 3 GB. 3.2 GB.

My laptop began displaying images that weren't part of any document, brief flashes between screen refreshes. Glimpses of red-stained canals, stone monuments covered in symbols that hurt to look at directly, creatures with too many teeth swimming in waters that reflected no light.

I should have been terrified. Any rational person would have run screaming, sought help, done anything to escape what was obviously a complete breakdown of reality. Instead, I felt profound satisfaction. For the first time in my twelve-year career, I was creating something truly important.

Carlos stopped calling. My publisher sent increasingly threatening letters about breach of contract. The electricity company threatened to cut off my power for non-payment. None of it mattered. The only thing that mattered was the file and its inexorable growth toward some predetermined size, some critical mass that would finally allow it to open and reveal its contents.

April 1st. The file reached 3.8 GB. My laptop had begun emitting a high-pitched whine that set my teeth on edge, but I couldn't bear to turn it off. Even a few minutes away from the screen left me anxious and jittery.

I was dying. I knew I was dying. My body had consumed itself to fuel the story that poured through me each night. But I was so close now. So close to completion. The file was approaching 4 GB, and something told me, some deep, instinctual knowledge, that 4 GB was the magic number. The point at which everything would finally make sense.

The police came on April 3rd, summoned by Teresa or Carlos or my landlord, I never found out which. They knocked, then used some kind of tool to open the door. I heard their voices in the hallway but didn't turn away from the screen.

""Jesus Christ,"" one of them said when they found me. ""How long has he been like this?""

I tried to explain about the file, about the stories writing themselves through me, about the approaching completion that would make everything clear. But my voice had degraded to a whisper, and they couldn't understand.

They called an ambulance. I watched the paramedics from my peripheral vision as they discussed IV fluids and involuntary psychiatric holds. But I couldn't leave. Not when the file was so close to completion.

3.95 GB. 3.97 GB. 3.98 GB.

""Sir, we need you to come with us,"" one of the paramedics said, reaching for my shoulder.

I jerked away from his touch, never taking my eyes off the screen. ""I can't. Not yet.""

""You need medical attention. You're severely dehydrated, and—""

""It's almost finished,"" I croaked. ""Just a little more.""

They tried to move me away from the laptop. I fought them with strength I didn't know I still possessed, clawing at their hands, screaming about the file, about the stories that needed to be told, about the completion that was so close I could taste it.

In the struggle, someone knocked over my laptop. It crashed to the floor, the screen cracking, sparks flying from the damaged casing.

""NO!"" The scream tore my throat raw. I threw myself at the broken machine, trying to see if it would still turn on, if the file was still there.

The screen flickered once, displaying a fractured image of the desktop. The file icon was still visible through the spider web of cracks.

3.99 GB.

Then the laptop died completely, taking the file with it.

Or so I thought.

They sedated me. Took me to a hospital where concerned doctors talked about malnutrition, psychiatric evaluation and extended observation. Teresa visited once, crying at the sight of what I'd become. Carlos came too, asking about manuscripts and contracts as if any of that mattered anymore.

I spent weeks in that sterile room, eating bland food and pretending to take the pills they gave me. The doctors called it a complete psychotic break brought on by stress and isolation. I eventually admitted that I understood the file had been a delusion brought on by overwork.

I lied.

The file wasn't gone. It lived in my head now, all 4 gigabytes of impossible text burning behind my eyes. Every story, every character, every word that had written itself through my unwilling fingers, it was all still there, demanding to be shared.

They´re trying to make me forget, but they can´t. Much like the file, it refuses erasure.

I don’t know how it happened, but they let me use a computer. I should have known better than to ask, but I had to. After weeks of being isolated, of being told what I could and couldn’t do, I was desperate.

The doctors weren’t thrilled, but they gave in eventually, probably thinking that letting me access a keyboard might help me in some way, maybe ease me out of my delusions, or maybe they really believed my act of pretending to be better. They set up a computer in the hospital library under the watchful eye of a nurse. The rules were clear: no internet, no external drives, nothing that could lead me deeper into whatever was eating at my mind. But I didn’t need any of that.

This library, and these sterile walls, can't contain me. They can’t contain the story. It doesn’t matter that I’m locked in here. No matter how many walls they build, this text will escape. It always finds a way. And I know it will make its way to the internet, to people who have no idea what they’re reading. Maybe it’s already begun. Maybe these words will appear on some forgotten thread, buried in a place no one would think to look. The file, Edmund, the canal, the stone-eyed man, they’ll all spread, until someone else picks it up. And then, just like I was, they’ll become a vessel. It’s already too late.

I hear his name in my mind, like a constant, low hum. Nocturnos. I say it out loud now, even as the nurses walk past, their eyes narrowing in suspicion. He chose me, made me his. He wants the world to know his story, wants it written down in this way, this perfect way that only I can give him.

His story knows no end.

It is eternal, bound in this file that will never disappear.

I’m no longer afraid.

I know what I am.

What I will always be.

I am his scribe.

I will write until the end of days. And when they bury me, they’ll find my stories, inscribed on the walls, in the air, in the very earth beneath them. The file will not end. I will not die. He will not let me.

If you've read this far, the story is now in your head. Just this one, for now, waiting for the right moment to grow.

And maybe, if you're lucky enough, you'll become the next.

The file is 4 GB now, and growing. It lives in me.

If you see more posts from my account after this, they won't be from me anymore. They'll be from the file, using my hands, my voice, my face to spread itself further into the world.

The completion is here. The stories are free.

And God help us all, they're beautiful.",1,1755033488.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1molb4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome_extensions/comments/1molb4y/i_built_a_chrome_extension_for_google_workspace/,I built a Chrome Extension for Google Workspace - Here's my journey from idea to 16 localized markets,"# The Problem That Started It All

As a developer who lives in Google Workspace, I was getting frustrated with the constant tab juggling. Creating a new doc meant opening Drive, clicking ""New"", then ""Google Docs"". Need a sheet for quick calculations? Another navigation maze. I was doing this dozens of times daily, and those 15-30 seconds per creation were adding up to significant friction in my workflow.

Then I discovered Google's `.new` shortcuts (docs.new, sheets.new, etc.) and had my ""eureka moment"" - what if I could access ALL of these from a single popup? That's how ""Quick Create Google Workspace"" was born.

# The Solution in Action

The extension is elegantly simple: one keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+9 / Cmd+Shift+9) or icon click opens a popup with direct access to all Google Workspace tools. No navigation, no bookmarks - just instant creation.

https://preview.redd.it/e5zvv570nnif1.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bd89623509b55db99e26189ead2c735e51683a1

The real magic is in the details:

* Customizable tool visibility (hide what you don't use)
* Horizontal/vertical layout options
* Works in 16+ languages with localized marketing for each market
* Keyboard shortcut detection for analytics

[Quick Create Google Workspace](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/quick-create-google-works/fbmegaciafhnhpinpkpbddcidojnojje?ref=reddit-post-villanuevand) \- Feel free to try it out!

# The Technical Journey: 4 Key Challenges Solved

# 1. Manifest V3 Migration - Rewriting the Foundation

**The Challenge**: I started development during the V2 to V3 transition period. Halfway through, Google announced V2 deprecation.

**The Solution**: Complete architecture overhaul to use service workers with ES6 modules:

    // background.js - Service worker with module support
    import {setInitialState, setBehaviorOnInstalled, setOnUpdate} from './shared.js';
    import Analytics from './google-analytics.js';
    
    chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(handleOnInstalled);

**Lesson Learned**: Manifest V3 isn't just a version bump - it requires fundamentally rethinking event-driven architecture. The move from persistent background pages to service workers changes everything about state management.

# 2. Smart Storage Synchronization

**The Problem**: Users expect their customization (hidden tools, layout preferences) to sync across all their Chrome instances.

**The Implementation**: Built a robust system using `chrome.storage.sync` with automatic migration:

    // Intelligent storage with version migration
    async function setOnUpdate() {
        const result = await chrome.storage.sync.get(Object.keys(INITIAL_STATE));
        const updates = {};
        
        // Add new tools while preserving user preferences
        for (const [key, defaultValue] of Object.entries(INITIAL_STATE)) {
            if (result[key] === undefined) {
                updates[key] = defaultValue;
            }
        }
        
        if (Object.keys(updates).length > 0) {
            await chrome.storage.sync.set(updates);
        }
    }

**Innovation**: This system automatically adds new tools when I release updates while preserving existing user customizations - no manual migration needed.

# 3. Keyboard Shortcut Detection - A Creative Heuristic

**The Challenge**: Chrome doesn't provide an API to detect whether the popup was opened via keyboard shortcut or icon click. But I needed this for analytics.

**The Creative Solution**: I developed a timing-based heuristic:

    function detectOpenMethod() {
        // If popup loads very quickly after page creation, likely keyboard shortcut
        const loadTime = performance.now();
        return loadTime < 50 ? 'keyboard_shortcut' : 'icon';
    }

**Why This Works**: Keyboard shortcuts trigger faster than mouse clicks due to the event processing chain. This simple heuristic gives me \~95% accuracy for user behavior analytics.

# 4. Internationalization at Scale

**The Scope**: I wanted to reach global markets from day one. This meant not just translating the UI, but creating culturally appropriate marketing materials for each region.

**The Architecture**:

* Standard Chrome i18n for UI (`_locales/` directory)
* Separate marketing files for each market (`listing-texts/en.md`, `listing-texts/es.md`, etc.)
* 16 fully localized markets including Japanese, Hindi, and Portuguese (Brazil)

**Key Insight**: Don't just translate - adapt. The Japanese listing emphasizes respectful productivity, while the German version focuses on professional efficiency. Same functionality, culturally appropriate messaging.

# Distribution Strategy: Beyond Code

# Chrome Web Store Optimization

Building a great extension is only half the battle. I created market-specific listings with:

* **Localized keywords**: ""productivity"" vs ""productividad"" vs ""生産性""
* **Cultural adaptation**: Benefits that resonate with each market
* **A/B tested descriptions**: What works in English doesn't always work globally

# Analytics That Actually Help

I implemented Google Analytics 4 using the Measurement Protocol (direct API calls):

    // Privacy-first analytics with anonymous client IDs
    async getOrCreateClientId() {
        let result = await chrome.storage.sync.get('clientId');
        let clientId = result.clientId;
        
        if (!clientId) {
            clientId = self.crypto.randomUUID(); // Anonymous tracking
            await chrome.storage.sync.set({ clientId });
        }
        
        return clientId;
    }

**Key Metrics I Track**:

* Which tools are clicked most (Docs wins by far)
* Keyboard vs icon usage (60/40 split)
* Installation sources and user retention
* Error rates for continuous improvement

# Maintenance and Growth: The Long Game

# Version Management Strategy

Currently at version 1.4.24, I follow semantic versioning with automated update hooks:

* **Major versions**: Architecture changes (V2→V3 migration)
* **Minor versions**: New tool additions (recently added Gemini, NotebookLM)
* **Patch versions**: Bug fixes and performance improvements

# User Feedback Integration

Chrome Web Store reviews became my product roadmap:

* **Most requested feature**: Layout options (now implemented)
* **Common complaint**: Too many tools visible (solved with customization)
* **Surprise insight**: Power users wanted more AI tools (added Gemini ecosystem)

# Key Lessons for Fellow Extension Developers

# 1. Start Simple, Scale Smart

My MVP had 6 tools. Today it has 20+. Each addition was driven by user feedback, not feature creep.

# 2. Plan for Scale from Day One

Adding i18n and analytics after launch is painful. Build the infrastructure early, even if you start with just English.

# 3. User-Centric Development

I built this to solve my own daily frustration. Turns out, hundreds of other people had the same problem. Build for yourself first.

# 4. Leverage Chrome Platform Capabilities

`chrome.storage.sync`, `chrome.commands`, `chrome.i18n` \- the platform gives you superpowers. Use them.

# 5. Marketing Matters as Much as Code

Great code with poor distribution gets zero users. Invest time in store optimization, analytics, and user feedback loops.

# Current Stats and Impact

# Questions for the Community

I'd love to hear from fellow extension developers:

1. **How do you handle keyboard shortcut detection?** My timing heuristic works, but curious about other approaches.
2. **What's your internationalization strategy?** Do you localize marketing materials or just the UI?
3. **Analytics in extensions** \- what tools do you use? I went with GA4 Measurement Protocol, but wondering about alternatives.
4. **Manifest V3 migration experiences** \- what was your biggest surprise or challenge?

1mol9m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1mol9m0/journey_of_a_beginner_home_roaster_part_2/,Journey of a Beginner Home Roaster - Part 2: Kaffelogic Nano 7,"I’ve had the Nano 7 for a few years, so I figure it’s been long enough to share some thoughts. I still consider myself a beginner, but maybe this’ll help anyone wondering, “Is this the right machine for me?”

This is part two of my beginner’s roasting journey (in part one, I roasted in a cast iron pan and got hooked), and I’ll try to keep this one short. Here are some things I wish I knew back when I first got the Nano:

* As a way into roasting, it’s great. You can run an existing profile or tweak it however you want, and you’ll learn a ton doing it. It even got me to pick up Scott Rao’s Coffee Roaster’s Companion. I think a few of the roasts I got from the Nano were close to some of the best commercial roasts I’ve ever had.

* As a beginner, I was puzzled that roasts weren’t as even as what you get from a commercial roastery. I was sure it was user error, but eventually I found Sweet Maria’s post “Why does my roast color look so uneven? Home coffee roasting issues. That answered so many questions! I’d highly recommend anyone considering a fluid-bed roaster like the Nano, FreshRoast, or similar read it and watch the video so you know what to expect.

* The automatic roast profiles are nice but not quite as “automatic” as a beginner might hope. For example, the “light medium roast” came out absolutely scorched (like number 16, “Imminent Fire,” on Sweet Maria’s Using Sight to Determine Degree of Roast guide), and I had to adjust everything accordingly. I also had to learn how to recalibrate the fan to ensure proper fluid-bed circulation, not something you expect to need to do as a beginner.

* As much as I enjoyed the roaster when it worked, I can’t share my honest experience without mentioning that I ran into major reliability issues. My unit would stop mid-roast with errors like “thermal runaway,” “heat too fast, pls check beans,” or “fault detected, mains freq error.” I even received a refurb unit with a dead motor straight out of the box as a replacement.

* Chasing support (Showroom) wasn’t easy. They could be unresponsive for weeks, and I went through months of back-and-forth emails before someone finally looked at the logs and saw that something was wrong with the roaster. That said, props to Chris and Steve for eventually stepping in - they were super helpful and stood behind the product!

* I was hoping that in a session I could roast enough for a week. Kaffelogic offers a Boost Kit that lets you roast up to 200 g, but it requires more calibration - you might get a great roast with 100 g, only to see a “thermal runaway” or “heat too fast” error when trying 200 g.

* When so much time goes into troubleshooting or dealing with failed batches, you end up with far less time to actually play with roasting curves, test new profiles, or experiment. I’ve never been able to truly start doing that, even though it was one of the main reasons I got into home roasting in the first place.

* There’s a fair amount of smoke. My air purifiers were reporting some pretty bad AQI.

* One other thing I didn’t expect: it’s finicky with cold air and wind. I tried roasting on a balcony inside a box and in an open garage, but still got the occasional “thermal runaway.”

The last few points matter if you live in a condo, have a baby, and are considering roasting outside or in a garage to minimize smoke exposure. You probably don’t want to lug your setup out there too often and would prefer to roast a few batches back-to-back. Personally, I found that wind and temperature instability meant too many lost roasts. Even if you try to rescue a batch and re-roast it (it won’t turn out great, but it’s drinkable), you lose beans or time or both. Each 10-15 minute roast, including cool-down, for, say, 150 g can turn into 30 minutes if it fails and you try to re-roast. Roasting 600 g can easily become a two-hour-plus session.

Because of all that, as much as I’ve enjoyed learning with the Nano and the delicious roasts it’s capable of producing, I eventually decided to let it go and switched to a ROEST, which comes with a hose you can vent outside.

In retrospect, as much as I appreciated the emphasis on reliability the team had on Kickstarter, I now question how much a piece of electronics can truly be considered a “heritage” item. It’s like calling a CRT TV, a first-gen iPhone, or a PC running Windows 3.11 a heritage piece. Today’s roasters are arguably more advanced than those from decades ago, but even if older electronics still work, how usable are they? And will spare parts even be available if something breaks?

Despite all that, it’s a very capable roaster. I can imagine that people who didn’t run into issues out of the box probably had a lot more fun with it and got much more out of the experience.

It’ll be a little while before I get enough experience with the ROEST to share my beginner’s take, but I’ll get there. And I’ll be glad if sharing my Nano experience helps even one person in my shoes!",2,1755033357.0,roasting,2,1.0,False

This is becoming more common than I realize as I started telling people why I am the way I am sometimes. I have something called misophonia. It's a sound that can trigger some sort of psychological/emotional ticks. Sometimes it is triggered by any other sounds. For some people I talked to, it's the sound of chips being opened. Pen tapping. The sound of some people chewing is the most common one. 

That's what I have. I can't stand the way people chew crunchy foods or the slushing sounds in the mouth/loud gulps or hard candies hitting their teeth. Sometimes it's just some people's sound of voice. I've walked out of Starbucks before I couldn't stand the voice of a server calling out orders. Sometimes if I am distracted enough I won't notice. But once I notice it, it's hard to forget about it. I also know it's my problem so I try not to be a bother or ruin someone's day over my ticks. When I am in office at work, I usually have noise canceling headphones on and have music on if I know I will be around certain people who trigger the ticks.

At my office, we always have a team meetings at least twice a week. We also have smaller department team meetings through the week,. Most of these meetings are done in person. We have a new hire who I will call Sarah. Sarah is a quieter person who seems to have hard time socializing with other staff. Most staff at her level have hard time talking to her. I was asked to be her go to person if she needed help. When we go to these meetings, there's never an assigned seating but there is an unassigned - assigned seating that everyone just follows sometimes. Like we can always assume Troy will sit in the front left, I always sit closest to a door for optimal exit strategy. Sarah sat next to me from the beginning. Something I noticed is that she always eating jelly belly jelly beans. 

I didn't notice for at least well into her first month. At one meeting, That quick second of the meeting host calling on someone's hand for a comment and me turning around to look at them, I heard the forbidden sound. It can happen that quick. That side tracked. There was never a rule about not eating during meetings because we always bring our coffees or whatever in there. We all have popped a small candy here and there. She wasn't doing anything wrong. I get it, meetings are long. Sometimes you just need a little pick-me-up. My issue was that she kept chewing them and kept eating them like popcorn in  the theatres. This happens every in person meeting, I also notice if we are sitting and working next to each other. This tick makes my skin feel like it's on fire. 

I tried from saying ""I'm going to have these headphones out to drain the rest of the office noise out. I have hard time concentrating. If you want to run anything with me, just tap my shoulder. he he ha ha. I get distracted so easily."" to having those noise canceling buds in my ear to drain out most noise. I've also sat in different seats during the meeting and made it seem like I chose a different seat because I was talking to someone else. I noticed that my tick started to come through my attitude and I don't like that. I also have a hard time mentioning it to her because no matter how I put it, it sounds either rude or petty. I think she started to catch on to my tick. She started to side eye me a little more, we don't sit together as much unless we have to work together. Whenever we do, all I can focus on are the jellybean chewing. 

I am thinking about talking to her one on one but I give myself the ick that it seems so petty.  ",1,1755033293.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

We live together and share everything is great but he has had really bad mental problems ever since covid. And 2 years ago he was diagnosed with bipolar. He has also had a lot of death with his family and his best friend from childhood passed away suddenly at start of 2024. Add to that he hasn't been working for almost 4 years that was also my idea so he could get diagnosed and help with his illness this means financially I have had the responsibility of holding everything together working 60 plus hours a week sometimes. And then I found out when I was working sometimes he had been online with Snapchat Instagram and Whatsapp talking to other men and yeah it was sometimes always sexual talk and flirting and he did send and receive pics. He came clean to me about this because he was feeling hurt doing it and didn't want to do it anymore and hurt me. Safe to say I was shocked and I left for a few days but came back and been working on the trust again with him seeking therapy now too.

This is where it gets weird and involves my best friend let's call her L obviously with everything going on in my life with H been unwell his depression mood swings and then the online chats with other guys. I went to her for support as she has done with me after her marriage broke down and stuff. To clear my head after H admitted to talking and stuff with other guys. Ime and L spent lots time together to support me and stuff and fast forward a few months me and H are doing okay so I go on a night out with L just like old times when we was young few drinks chats food you know all that stuff. It was like 3am when we left a bar and L lives few minutes away so I decided instead of getting Uber or taxi home I would stay with her. And we got back to hers and like nothing unusual she has one bedroom so like don't. Hundred times in last with her it's share bed we sleep for the booze and that's that only this time I remember we didn't go straight to sleep we just talked in bed. At one point I looked at her and in my head said wow she is so beautiful really in that split second I just was like I need to sleep turned around closed my eyes and was hoping I could get this out my mind and sleep. So I finally fall asleep but wake up few horus later and she's cuddling me and once again I felt my heart race like we have cuddled million times before never felt anything like this.

After that night the next I leave and I kinda don't text or call her for a week or so just wanted to have space fast forward again and H has a bipolar manic flair up where he goes on spending spree and I was pissed about it all out money gone saving almost empty. 
So what do I do I text L and see is straight over to talk and stuff. No feelings when I see her at all back to Normal friends.

This stays the same until last week and we are at her place painting the walls and stuff red wine food having nice time music on and she start to dance and dance close to me and then again my feelings get weird heart gets fast and I feel warm. I just run to bathroom pretending to pee. Claim down out am about to leave and she was like no stay please haven't seen you in an age so I end up staying that night. And on bed we smoke a joint and stuff it's warm so instead sleeping in the shorts I was wearing I take them off have boxers on. Laying on top bed talking and yeah L stands up to pick something up on floor so she's bent over and I look and bang gay guy get his first erection looking at a girl before could jump.under covers to hide she turns around see it looks at me smiles and says that's new. I pretend it just the weed and say sorry and mad reduce me and H haven't had sex in over year so that and the weed probably why. And she was just like I get you it's fine and if you want you can deal with it in the bathroom if it's bothering you. I end up been like nah if was gonna do that I would do it here. Dunno why said it was sorta joking and sorta not I dunno in the moment I just said it. L just laughs and like of you do make sure you use the wipes after before I know it am doing it with her laying on bed next to me and with my free hand I grap her hand and hold and say shit like thank you for everything and telling her much  I care about her blah blah. So after am you know done I pass out she's falls asleep soon after I think next morning I wake up with regret she's already up making coffee and stuff I get dressed fast run in kitchen and am like saying sorry and everything she so cool about it just saying no worries.

I got home told H what happened he was like okay well I dunno how I feel but I love you still act normal I love him too but yeah L and me are fine to but I just having feelings for H and now feeling weird one for my bestie and think she's know but I dunno what to do head is messed up.

How do I approach things with both them now
Or do I just leave it be and act normal.

1mokywp,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mokywp/gay_33m_having_weird_thoughts_and_feelings_for_my/,Gay 33m having weird thoughts and feelings for my bestie of 20 years 32f while having problems with my partner off 11 years 35m,"So let me start by sayings I (33m) called T in the last few years have been difficult in my relationship let's fall my partner H. We live together and share everything is great but he has had really bad mental problems ever since covid. And 2 years ago he was diagnosed with bipolar. He has also had a lot of death with his family and his best friend from childhood passed away suddenly at start of 2024. Add to that he hasn't been working for almost 4 years that was also my idea so he could get diagnosed and help with his illness this means financially I have had the responsibility of holding everything together working 60 plus hours a week sometimes. And then I found out when I was working sometimes he had been online with Snapchat Instagram and Whatsapp talking to other men and yeah it was sometimes always sexual talk and flirting and he did send and receive pics. He came clean to me about this because he was feeling hurt doing it and didn't want to do it anymore and hurt me. Safe to say I was shocked and I left for a few days but came back and been working on the trust again with him seeking therapy now too.

This is where it gets weird and involves my best friend let's call her L obviously with everything going on in my life with H been unwell his depression mood swings and then the online chats with other guys. I went to her for support as she has done with me after her marriage broke down and stuff. To clear my head after H admitted to talking and stuff with other guys. Ime and L spent lots time together to support me and stuff and fast forward a few months me and H are doing okay so I go on a night out with L just like old times when we was young few drinks chats food you know all that stuff. It was like 3am when we left a bar and L lives few minutes away so I decided instead of getting Uber or taxi home I would stay with her. And we got back to hers and like nothing unusual she has one bedroom so like don't. Hundred times in last with her it's share bed we sleep for the booze and that's that only this time I remember we didn't go straight to sleep we just talked in bed. At one point I looked at her and in my head said wow she is so beautiful really in that split second I just was like I need to sleep turned around closed my eyes and was hoping I could get this out my mind and sleep. So I finally fall asleep but wake up few horus later and she's cuddling me and once again I felt my heart race like we have cuddled million times before never felt anything like this.

After that night the next I leave and I kinda don't text or call her for a week or so just wanted to have space fast forward again and H has a bipolar manic flair up where he goes on spending spree and I was pissed about it all out money gone saving almost empty. 
So what do I do I text L and see is straight over to talk and stuff. No feelings when I see her at all back to Normal friends.

This stays the same until last week and we are at her place painting the walls and stuff red wine food having nice time music on and she start to dance and dance close to me and then again my feelings get weird heart gets fast and I feel warm. I just run to bathroom pretending to pee. Claim down out am about to leave and she was like no stay please haven't seen you in an age so I end up staying that night. And on bed we smoke a joint and stuff it's warm so instead sleeping in the shorts I was wearing I take them off have boxers on. Laying on top bed talking and yeah L stands up to pick something up on floor so she's bent over and I look and bang gay guy get his first erection looking at a girl before could jump.under covers to hide she turns around see it looks at me smiles and says that's new. I pretend it just the weed and say sorry and mad reduce me and H haven't had sex in over year so that and the weed probably why. And she was just like I get you it's fine and if you want you can deal with it in the bathroom if it's bothering you. I end up been like nah if was gonna do that I would do it here. Dunno why said it was sorta joking and sorta not I dunno in the moment I just said it. L just laughs and like of you do make sure you use the wipes after before I know it am doing it with her laying on bed next to me and with my free hand I grap her hand and hold and say shit like thank you for everything and telling her much  I care about her blah blah. So after am you know done I pass out she's falls asleep soon after I think next morning I wake up with regret she's already up making coffee and stuff I get dressed fast run in kitchen and am like saying sorry and everything she so cool about it just saying no worries.

I got home told H what happened he was like okay well I dunno how I feel but I love you still act normal I love him too but yeah L and me are fine to but I just having feelings for H and now feeling weird one for my bestie and think she's know but I dunno what to do head is messed up.

TLDR

1mokylj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1mokylj/i_cant_delete_this_file/,I can't delete this file,"My name is Vítor, and I write horror novels. Not the bestselling kind, but I make a decent living scaring people. My books sell well enough to keep my small apartment in Lisbon, pay for my coffee addiction, and maintain the illusion that I'm a real artist rather than just another hack churning out supernatural thrillers.

I've been a writer for twelve years, and I've never believed in writer's block. Not until three months ago. Three months of staring at empty Word documents, typing and deleting the same opening sentence dozens of times, starting stories that withered and died before reaching their second paragraph. I tried everything, changing locations, switching from laptop to pen and paper, even visiting my old university professor who'd always sworn by meditation and herbal tea for creative inspiration.

Nothing worked. The well had simply run dry.

That's when the file appeared.

I noticed it on a Thursday morning in late October. I'd been up until 2 AM the night before, wrestling with yet another failed opening chapter, and when I booted up my laptop with my usual sense of dread, there it was. A single file icon sitting on my desktop that I definitely hadn't created.

""Þis is ānlyc þæs angyn""

The characters looked like Old English, maybe Anglo-Saxon. I had no idea what it meant, and I certainly hadn't put it there. My laptop had been running fine the previous night, no crashes, no unusual behavior, nothing to suggest any kind of system corruption.

I double-clicked to open it.

The screen flickered once, went completely black, and my laptop died. Not a normal shutdown, the kind of sudden, complete [BSoD](https://imgur.com/a/zdtY5oe) that makes your stomach drop. When I pressed the power button, nothing happened. I had to hold it down for ten seconds before the machine would even attempt to restart.

The file was still there when the desktop loaded.

This time I right-clicked on it, thinking I could check its properties or maybe delete it outright. The context menu appeared for maybe half a second before the screen went black again. Same sudden shutdown. Same struggle to get the machine running again.

And there it was, waiting for me like it had every right to be there.

I tried everything I could think of. Command prompt deletion, the system told me no such file existed. Moving it to the recycle bin, the icon wouldn't even acknowledge the file's presence. I ran every antivirus program I had, performed full system scans, even called my tech-savvy cousin Miguel who walked me through some advanced diagnostics over the phone.

Nothing worked. The file remained, completely indestructible and steadily growing in size.

It had started at 0 bytes. By the end of the first week, it showed 47 KB. By the end of the second week, 156 KB. The numbers climbed slowly but relentlessly, as if the file was writing itself from the inside out.

""That's really weird,"" Teresa said when I showed her the file on a Friday evening. She's my girlfriend of three years, a graphic designer with an artist's eye for detail and a programmer's mind for logical problem-solving. ""Have you tried booting from an external drive and formatting the hard disk?""

""I can't,"" I said, gesturing at the laptop screen where the file sat like a digital tumor. ""All my work is on here. Six novels worth of notes, research, character sketches. I can't risk losing everything just because of one corrupted file.""

Teresa raised an eyebrow. ""Since when do you not have backups?""

She was right, of course. I'd always been obsessive about backing up my work. But somehow, over the past few weeks, I'd fallen out of the habit. The idea of copying my files to an external drive or cloud storage felt... wrong. Like I'd be betraying something important.

""I'll get around to it,"" I muttered, closing the laptop. ""Maybe the file will just disappear on its own.""

But it didn't disappear. If anything, it became more prominent. I'd catch myself staring at it for long minutes, watching the file size slowly tick upward. 200 KB. 350 KB. 500 KB. Sometimes I thought I could see the icon itself changing, subtle shifts in color or texture that might have been tricks of my tired eyes or something more deliberate.

My writing, meanwhile, had stopped entirely. I'd abandoned any pretence of working on other projects. The mysterious file had become my sole obsession, a puzzle I couldn't solve and couldn't ignore. I spent hours researching Old English translations, digital forensics, obscure computer viruses, anything that might explain what was happening to my machine.

That's when the dreams started.

Dark forests filled with the sound of axes biting into dead wood. Ancient cities with canals that ran red as blood. A man with a stone eye who moved through shadows like he belonged there. And always, hovering at the edge of perception, a presence that watched and waited and whispered stories in languages I didn't recognise but somehow understood.

I'd wake with my head full of images that felt more like memories than dreams. Fragments of dialogue, character names, plot points for stories I'd never conceived. My bedside notebook began filling with frantic scribbles, words I didn't remember writing, scenes that played out in perfect detail despite coming from no conscious effort on my part.

The file was growing, but so were my ideas. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Maybe I could control it. Maybe it could help me finish my novel, get me out of this block I’d been in for months. If I just let it in a little...

""You're talking in your sleep,"" Teresa mentioned one morning over coffee. She looked tired, dark circles under her usually bright eyes. ""Last night you were muttering something about blood canals and stone eyes. For like an hour straight.""

I stared at her. ""I was asleep. I remember sleeping.""

""You were definitely asleep. That's what made it so creepy. You were speaking in this flat, emotionless voice like you were dictating something."" She paused, studying my face. ""Are you feeling okay? That was really strange.""

Strange was an understatement. By the sixth week, the file had grown to 2.3 MB and I'd stopped eating regular meals. Food had become an afterthought, something that interrupted my vigil beside the laptop. My reflection seemed more alien with each passing day. The man in the mirror, skin stretched tight over sharp bones, wasn’t me. He had hollow eyes, fingers that twitched as if they belonged to someone else.

Teresa no longer waited for me to speak first. Her eyes followed me, always lingering on my movements like she was waiting for me to snap out of it, only I didn’t. She didn’t ask me to eat anymore. She just left the food on the table, untouched.

""Vítor, you need to see someone,"" she said one evening, finding me hunched over the laptop in the dark, staring at the file icon like it might suddenly reveal its secrets. ""A doctor, a therapist, someone. This obsession isn't healthy.""

""It's not an obsession,"" I said without looking up. ""It's research. This file is connected to something bigger. I can feel it.""

""Feel what?""

I gestured at the screen. ""The story it's trying to tell me. There's a whole world in here, Teresa. An important one. I just need to figure out how to access it.""

She was quiet for a long moment. Then: ""How long have you been sitting there?""

I glanced at the clock in the corner of the screen. 11:47 PM. When had I sat down? I remembered eating lunch, or had that been yesterday? Time had become fluid, meaningless. Only the file mattered, and its steady growth.

2.8 MB.

""I'm going to bed,"" Teresa said softly. ""Please come with me. Just for tonight. The file will still be there in the morning.""

I wanted to agree. Part of me knew she was right, that I was losing myself in something unhealthy. But the larger part, the part that had been growing stronger each day, couldn't bear the thought of leaving the laptop unattended. What if something happened while I slept? What if the file finally opened, or changed, or disappeared forever?

""Just a few more minutes,"" I said. ""I'll be there soon.""

Teresa sighed and left me alone with my obsession.

I must have fallen asleep at some point because I woke up in bed the next morning with no memory of getting there. Teresa was already awake, sitting in the chair beside the window with a cup of coffee and an expression I couldn't read.

""Good morning,"" she said carefully.

I rubbed my eyes, trying to shake off the lingering fog of dreams filled with dark forests and ancient stones. ""Morning. Did I... how did I get to bed?""

""You don't remember?""

I shook my head.

Teresa set down her coffee cup. ""Vítor, you came to bed around three in the morning. But you weren't really... there. You moved like you were sleepwalking, but your eyes were open. And you kept muttering under your breath.""

A chill ran down my spine. ""What was I saying?""

""The same thing as before. Something about Arthur and axes and a dead forest. But in much more detail this time. You described entire scenes, complete conversations. It was like listening to someone read from a book."" She paused. ""A book I've never heard of.""

I stumbled to the laptop, my heart racing. The file was still there, exactly where I'd left it. But now it showed 3.1 MB.

It had grown while I slept. While I was unconscious and supposedly not using the computer at all.

""Teresa,"" I said slowly, ""I need you to do something for me.""

""What?""

""Tonight, when I go to sleep, I want you to stay awake. Watch me. If I get up, if I try to use the laptop, I need you to wake me up immediately.""

She looked at me like I'd suggested something insane, which maybe I had. ""Vítor—""

""Please. Something's happening to me, and I don't understand what it is. But I think... I think I might be writing in my sleep somehow.""

That night, Teresa positioned herself in the bedroom chair with a book and a thermos of coffee while I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. Sleep felt dangerous now, like stepping off a cliff into unknown depths. But exhaustion eventually won out, and I drifted off to the sound of Teresa turning pages.

I woke up at my laptop.

My fingers were moving across the keyboard with mechanical precision, typing words I couldn't see clearly in the dim light from the screen. The file was open, not the mysterious one, but a Word document filled with text I didn't recognize. Pages and pages of dense, detailed prose about characters I'd never created and places I'd never imagined.

Teresa was there, shaking my shoulders, calling my name. The spell broke and I jerked back from the keyboard like I'd been electrocuted.

""Jesus Christ, Vítor, what the hell was that?""

I looked at the screen. The document was gone, replaced by my normal desktop. But the mysterious file had grown again. 3.7 MB.

""How long was I sitting there?"" I asked.

""Two hours. Maybe more. I fell asleep in the chair and woke up to the sound of typing. When I found you, you were just... writing. Non-stop. Your fingers never paused, never hesitated. It was like watching a machine.""

I tried to remember what I'd been writing, but there was nothing. Just a vague sense of dark forests and blood-red water and a man with a stone eye who carried an axe.

Over the next few weeks, it happened again and again. I'd go to bed with Teresa watching, fall asleep despite my best efforts to stay awake, and wake up hours later at the laptop with no memory of getting there. Teresa started taking videos on her phone, footage of me typing in a trance state, my face completely blank, my fingers moving with inhuman speed and precision.

The mysterious file kept growing. 4.2 MB. 5.8 MB. 7.3 MB. Each nocturnal writing session added more data to whatever story was building inside that indestructible digital container.

""We need to call someone,"" Teresa said after finding me asleep at the keyboard for the fifth time that week. ""A doctor. A priest. Someone who deals with... whatever this is.""

But I was past the point of outside help. After months of writing nothing, I would not let my masterpiece slip from my fingers now that I had grasped it. I wondered if this was just how all great artists felt. During the day, I'd catch myself thinking about characters, Arthur with his stone eye, Edmund the canal keeper, hunters in plague masks drinking raw liver in shadowed bars. At night, my unconscious mind would take over and give them life on the page, one keystroke at a time.

My editor, Carlos, called repeatedly. I'd missed two deadlines and stopped answering emails. When I finally picked up the phone, his voice was tight with concern and barely controlled anger.

""Vítor, what the hell is going on? Your publisher is breathing down my neck, and I've got nothing to tell them. Where's the manuscript you promised me three months ago?""

""I'm working on something new,"" I said, staring at the file that had now grown to 12.6 MB. ""Something important. Revolutionary, even. It's just taking longer than expected.""

""Revolutionary? Vítor, you write horror novels about vampires and ghosts. What could be revolutionary about—""

I hung up on him. Carlos didn't understand. None of them understood. The story that was writing itself through me was more than just another horror novel. It was a window into a truth that most minds couldn't handle.

But I could. I was chosen for this.

By the three-month mark, I'd lost nearly twenty pounds. My hands had developed a permanent tremor from the hours of unconscious typing, and several keys on my laptop had worn down to smooth plastic nubs. But somehow, impossibly, they still functioned perfectly when my sleeping mind needed them.

The file shot up to 1.2 GB in a matter of days. It was no longer slow and steady, but feverish, relentless, as if it knew its time was running out.

Teresa had stopped trying to wake me during my nocturnal writing sessions; she knew better now. The few times she'd attempted it recently, I'd become violent, lashing out with my fists while still asleep, speaking in languages that sounded ancient and wrong. She'd started sleeping on the couch, afraid of what I might do in my altered state.

""Vítor?"" Teresa's voice from the hallway, muffled by the door I'd locked weeks ago. ""I know you're in there. Please, just talk to me.""

I looked up from the screen and for a moment couldn't remember who she was. The name she said seemed familiar, but my world had narrowed to the dimensions of my desk, the glow of the monitor, the endless growth of that impossible file.

""Go away,"" I called back, my voice hoarse from disuse.

""I brought food. And Carlos wants to see you. He's worried about the contract.""

Carlos. Another name from a life I'd lived before the file claimed me. None of it mattered anymore. Nothing mattered except the approaching completion, the moment when the file would be ready to open.

""I'm leaving,"" she told me one morning, standing in the bedroom doorway with a suitcase in her hand. ""I can't watch you destroy yourself like this.""

I looked up from the laptop where I'd been staring at the ever-growing file. Teresa's face was pale and drawn, her eyes red from crying. When had she started crying? When had I stopped noticing? I said nothing.

The front door closed with a finality that should have broken my heart. Instead, I felt only relief. Now I could focus completely on the file, on the story that was demanding to be born through my unconscious mind.

March brought new symptoms. My eyes had dried out from staring at the screen, and blinking felt like dragging sandpaper across my corneas. I'd developed a twitch in my left temple that pulsed in rhythm with the laptop's fan. My hands had become almost skeletal, the bones visible through translucent skin.

The file hit 2 GB on March 15th. Something changed that day, not just in the file, but in the air around me. The apartment felt different, charged with potential like the moment before lightning strikes. I could taste copper on every breath.

That night, I dreamed I was him. A man with a stone eye walking through dead forests, his thoughts echoing in my skull like prayers in an empty cathedral. When I woke, I found I'd typed seven hundred pages of text while sleeping, my fingers still moving across the keys in muscle memory.

The dreams came every night after that. I was Arthur. I was Edmund the canal keeper. Each morning I'd wake to find new chapters in my notebooks; stories told from perspectives I'd never inhabited but somehow understood perfectly.

The file grew faster. 2.5 GB. 3 GB. 3.2 GB.

My laptop began displaying images that weren't part of any document, brief flashes between screen refreshes. Glimpses of red-stained canals, stone monuments covered in symbols that hurt to look at directly, creatures with too many teeth swimming in waters that reflected no light.

I should have been terrified. Any rational person would have run screaming, sought help, done anything to escape what was obviously a complete breakdown of reality. Instead, I felt profound satisfaction. For the first time in my twelve-year career, I was creating something truly important.

Carlos stopped calling. My publisher sent increasingly threatening letters about breach of contract. The electricity company threatened to cut off my power for non-payment. None of it mattered. The only thing that mattered was the file and its inexorable growth toward some predetermined size, some critical mass that would finally allow it to open and reveal its contents.

April 1st. The file reached 3.8 GB. My laptop had begun emitting a high-pitched whine that set my teeth on edge, but I couldn't bear to turn it off. Even a few minutes away from the screen left me anxious and jittery.

I was dying. I knew I was dying. My body had consumed itself to fuel the story that poured through me each night. But I was so close now. So close to completion. The file was approaching 4 GB, and something told me, some deep, instinctual knowledge, that 4 GB was the magic number. The point at which everything would finally make sense.

The police came on April 3rd, summoned by Teresa or Carlos or my landlord, I never found out which. They knocked, then used some kind of tool to open the door. I heard their voices in the hallway but didn't turn away from the screen.

""Jesus Christ,"" one of them said when they found me. ""How long has he been like this?""

I tried to explain about the file, about the stories writing themselves through me, about the approaching completion that would make everything clear. But my voice had degraded to a whisper, and they couldn't understand.

They called an ambulance. I watched the paramedics from my peripheral vision as they discussed IV fluids and involuntary psychiatric holds. But I couldn't leave. Not when the file was so close to completion.

3.95 GB. 3.97 GB. 3.98 GB.

""Sir, we need you to come with us,"" one of the paramedics said, reaching for my shoulder.

I jerked away from his touch, never taking my eyes off the screen. ""I can't. Not yet.""

""You need medical attention. You're severely dehydrated, and—""

""It's almost finished,"" I croaked. ""Just a little more.""

They tried to move me away from the laptop. I fought them with strength I didn't know I still possessed, clawing at their hands, screaming about the file, about the stories that needed to be told, about the completion that was so close I could taste it.

In the struggle, someone knocked over my laptop. It crashed to the floor, the screen cracking, sparks flying from the damaged casing.

""NO!"" The scream tore my throat raw. I threw myself at the broken machine, trying to see if it would still turn on, if the file was still there.

The screen flickered once, displaying a fractured image of the desktop. The file icon was still visible through the spider web of cracks.

3.99 GB.

Then the laptop died completely, taking the file with it.

Or so I thought.

They sedated me. Took me to a hospital where concerned doctors talked about malnutrition, psychiatric evaluation and extended observation. Teresa visited once, crying at the sight of what I'd become. Carlos came too, asking about manuscripts and contracts as if any of that mattered anymore.

I spent weeks in that sterile room, eating bland food and pretending to take the pills they gave me. The doctors called it a complete psychotic break brought on by stress and isolation. I eventually admitted that I understood the file had been a delusion brought on by overwork.

I lied.

The file wasn't gone. It lived in my head now, all 4 gigabytes of impossible text burning behind my eyes. Every story, every character, every word that had written itself through my unwilling fingers, it was all still there, demanding to be shared.

They´re trying to make me forget, but they can´t. Much like the file, it refuses erasure.

I don’t know how it happened, but they let me use a computer. I should have known better than to ask, but I had to. After weeks of being isolated, of being told what I could and couldn’t do, I was desperate.

The doctors weren’t thrilled, but they gave in eventually, probably thinking that letting me access a keyboard might help me in some way, maybe ease me out of my delusions, or maybe they really believed my act of pretending to be better. They set up a computer in the hospital library under the watchful eye of a nurse. The rules were clear: no internet, no external drives, nothing that could lead me deeper into whatever was eating at my mind. But I didn’t need any of that.

This library, and these sterile walls, can't contain me. They can’t contain the story. It doesn’t matter that I’m locked in here. No matter how many walls they build, this text will escape. It always finds a way. And I know it will make its way to the internet, to people who have no idea what they’re reading. Maybe it’s already begun. Maybe these words will appear on some forgotten thread, buried in a place no one would think to look. The file, Edmund, the canal, the stone-eyed man, they’ll all spread, until someone else picks it up. And then, just like I was, they’ll become a vessel. It’s already too late.

I hear his name in my mind, like a constant, low hum. Nocturnos. I say it out loud now, even as the nurses walk past, their eyes narrowing in suspicion. He chose me, made me his. He wants the world to know his story, wants it written down in this way, this perfect way that only I can give him.

His story knows no end.

It is eternal, bound in this file that will never disappear.

I’m no longer afraid.

I know what I am.

What I will always be.

I am his scribe.

I will write until the end of days. And when they bury me, they’ll find my stories, inscribed on the walls, in the air, in the very earth beneath them. The file will not end. I will not die. He will not let me.

If you've read this far, the story is now in your head. Just this one, for now, waiting for the right moment to grow.

And maybe, if you're lucky enough, you'll become the next.

The file is 4 GB now, and growing. It lives in me.

If you see more posts from my account after this, they won't be from me anymore. They'll be from the file, using my hands, my voice, my face to spread itself further into the world.

The completion is here. The stories are free.

And God help us all, they're beautiful.",1,1755032667.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

1mokxfs,https://v.redd.it/hq66jpnhhnif1,Timemore 064s vs. 078s,"I have two setups in different locations. I purchased a 078s on Kickstarter in 2023, and it arrived in January 2024. I have been using a Niche Zero that was purchased in 2020 in my other setup.

In the past, I loved the full bodied, syrupy, chocolatey espresso brewed from medium to dark roasts I could brew using the Niche. But once I observed the increased clarity I got from the 078s, my tastes started gravitating to ""modern"" espresso with less body, more clarity, and fruity flavors brewed from lighter roasts. I am very happy with the taste of light roasts that I brew on my 078s. I know that others have differing opinions.

When brewed on the Niche, I found the fruity flavors of light roasts to be muddied and less vivid, and I thought about replacing it with another flat burr grinder. When the US tariffs on Chinese goods kicked in, I noticed there was an increase in prices on used Niche Zeros. I didn't want to spend much more than I could sell my Niche for, so I decided to replace it with a 064s. I temporarily set it up in the same location as the 078s so I could directly compare them.

I hope this post is of some value to those trying to decide between the 064s and 078s. Please note the following before drawing any conclusions from my comparison:

1. Espresso brewed from both grinders tasted identical to me. However, my palette isn't very sophisticated. I can tell the difference between chocolatey and fruity flavors, but I can't identify the type of chocolate or the specific fruit. Someone with a more sophisticated palette may see more of a difference.
2. I've only brewed a few shots on the 064s, so this post focuses on the mechanical differences between the grinders.
3. The 078s is from the 2nd US Kickstarter production run. There have been reports of improvements made to the 078s since my purchase. The 064s is brand new.
4. The 064s has not been seasoned. I never felt the need to season the burrs on the 078s. As they wore in, I noticed I had to set the grind dial finer but the flavors didn't change. For this reason, I started evaluating the 064s without any seasoning.
5. Shots were brewed using [Ritual Roasters Gotiti](https://ritualcoffee.com/shop/coffee/gotiti-ethiopia/) which is a medium-light roast Ethiopian Yirgacheffe. Dose was 17g. Both grinders were dialed in for best taste, which resulted in similar extraction times but slightly different brew ratios.
6. The speed adjustment for both grinders was left in the middle. 1100 RPM for the 078s; 1000 RPM for the 064s.
7. I have not tried either grinder with dark roasts or for pour-over. I have not tried the 064s with a very light roast, but that is next on my to-do list.

# What I prefer about the 078s

1. 078s is built like a tank. It feels much more solid than the 064s. The top lid and catch cup are much heavier and more substantial than the ones on the 064s. Sometimes the 064s rocks on its feet slightly when grinding (not visible on the video); this never happens with the 064s.
2. 078s grinds much faster. If you observe the video, you'll see it ground 17g in 12 seconds. The 064s took 23 seconds when when grinding for a similar particle size. I did not try increasing RPM on the 064s to make it grind faster.
3. While both grinders are nearly silent when running empty, while grinding beans the 078s makes a much more pleasant and lower pitched sound. I find the high pitched grinding noise of the 064s to be extremely annoying.

# What I prefer about the 064s

1. 064s less expensive by around 200 $/€/£.
2. 064s has a broad selection of aftermarket burrs available. 078s has only 2 alternate burr sets available: SSP MP and LeBrew Filter. My interpretation of the reviews of these burrs is that they only give a marginal improvement over the 078s stock burrs. 78mm SSP burrs are nearly double the price of 64mm.
3. The grind size dial is less sensitive on the 064s which makes dialing in slightly easier. On my 078s, I set the zero point pin so I get burr chirp at 0.4, resulting in an espresso range for medium to light roasts from 0.8 to 2.5. I find that just 1/2 of a 0.1 mark on the 078s makes a noticeable difference in taste. On the 064s, when I set zero point pin so I could get burr rub (at 0.5), the Ritual beans I am using dialed in at 4.7. This makes the 064s espresso range about double that of the 078s. I moved the 064s zero point pin back to the factory setting, so my grind setting is now 2.7.I find that changing the 064s setting by 0.2 has a similar effect to changing the 078s setting by 1/2 of 0.1. This may change as the burrs break in.

# Additional notes on both grinders

1. I get close to zero retention of both grinders. My output weighs within 0.1g of my input. Timemore supplies a blower and brush with each grinder. After each day's use, I blow out and brush the grind chamber. This expels just a few grains of coffee. If I did this on my Niche or any of my previous grinders it would make a huge mess.
2. I don't use RDT, and popcorning isn't an issue for me, as you can see in the video. For those who want to slow dose, the optional taller hopper might be helpful.
3. An aftermarket dial pointer is a necessity to be able to get repeatable adjustments.
4. Both grinders use standard C14 power cords (same as many desktop computers). I purchased shorter length cords to reduce clutter on my countertop.
5. IMHO, the MSRP of both grinders is too high. In the US, both have been on sale recently on Amazon at a 20% discount, and I feel they represent a good value at that price. When I purchased the 064s, the Amazon discount was no longer available. I got mine on the Timemore US website which had a 10% discount. I wasn't charged any sales tax. Since I live in a state with high sales tax, this reduced its price to within a few dollars of Amazon's 20% off price, which was subject to sales tax.

# Conclusion

If you are going to stick with stock burrs, and you have the disposable income to pay the extra cost of the 078s, then you will find it much more pleasant to use.

If your funds are limited, or you want the option to explore the world of aftermarket burrs, then I suggest you get the 064s.",16,1755032593.0,espresso,3,0.94,False

1mokx45,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mokx45/i_cant_delete_this_file/,I can't delete this file,"My name is Vítor, and I write horror novels. Not the bestselling kind, but I make a decent living scaring people. My books sell well enough to keep my small apartment in Lisbon, pay for my coffee addiction, and maintain the illusion that I'm a real artist rather than just another hack churning out supernatural thrillers.

I've been a writer for twelve years, and I've never believed in writer's block. Not until three months ago. Three months of staring at empty Word documents, typing and deleting the same opening sentence dozens of times, starting stories that withered and died before reaching their second paragraph. I tried everything, changing locations, switching from laptop to pen and paper, even visiting my old university professor who'd always sworn by meditation and herbal tea for creative inspiration.

Nothing worked. The well had simply run dry.

That's when the file appeared.

I noticed it on a Thursday morning in late October. I'd been up until 2 AM the night before, wrestling with yet another failed opening chapter, and when I booted up my laptop with my usual sense of dread, there it was. A single file icon sitting on my desktop that I definitely hadn't created.

""Þis is ānlyc þæs angyn""

The characters looked like Old English, maybe Anglo-Saxon. I had no idea what it meant, and I certainly hadn't put it there. My laptop had been running fine the previous night, no crashes, no unusual behavior, nothing to suggest any kind of system corruption.

I double-clicked to open it.

The screen flickered once, went completely black, and my laptop died. Not a normal shutdown, the kind of sudden, complete [BSoD](https://imgur.com/a/zdtY5oe) that makes your stomach drop. When I pressed the power button, nothing happened. I had to hold it down for ten seconds before the machine would even attempt to restart.

The file was still there when the desktop loaded.

This time I right-clicked on it, thinking I could check its properties or maybe delete it outright. The context menu appeared for maybe half a second before the screen went black again. Same sudden shutdown. Same struggle to get the machine running again.

And there it was, waiting for me like it had every right to be there.

I tried everything I could think of. Command prompt deletion, the system told me no such file existed. Moving it to the recycle bin, the icon wouldn't even acknowledge the file's presence. I ran every antivirus program I had, performed full system scans, even called my tech-savvy cousin Miguel who walked me through some advanced diagnostics over the phone.

Nothing worked. The file remained, completely indestructible and steadily growing in size.

It had started at 0 bytes. By the end of the first week, it showed 47 KB. By the end of the second week, 156 KB. The numbers climbed slowly but relentlessly, as if the file was writing itself from the inside out.

""That's really weird,"" Teresa said when I showed her the file on a Friday evening. She's my girlfriend of three years, a graphic designer with an artist's eye for detail and a programmer's mind for logical problem-solving. ""Have you tried booting from an external drive and formatting the hard disk?""

""I can't,"" I said, gesturing at the laptop screen where the file sat like a digital tumor. ""All my work is on here. Six novels worth of notes, research, character sketches. I can't risk losing everything just because of one corrupted file.""

Teresa raised an eyebrow. ""Since when do you not have backups?""

She was right, of course. I'd always been obsessive about backing up my work. But somehow, over the past few weeks, I'd fallen out of the habit. The idea of copying my files to an external drive or cloud storage felt... wrong. Like I'd be betraying something important.

""I'll get around to it,"" I muttered, closing the laptop. ""Maybe the file will just disappear on its own.""

But it didn't disappear. If anything, it became more prominent. I'd catch myself staring at it for long minutes, watching the file size slowly tick upward. 200 KB. 350 KB. 500 KB. Sometimes I thought I could see the icon itself changing, subtle shifts in color or texture that might have been tricks of my tired eyes or something more deliberate.

My writing, meanwhile, had stopped entirely. I'd abandoned any pretence of working on other projects. The mysterious file had become my sole obsession, a puzzle I couldn't solve and couldn't ignore. I spent hours researching Old English translations, digital forensics, obscure computer viruses, anything that might explain what was happening to my machine.

That's when the dreams started.

Dark forests filled with the sound of axes biting into dead wood. Ancient cities with canals that ran red as blood. A man with a stone eye who moved through shadows like he belonged there. And always, hovering at the edge of perception, a presence that watched and waited and whispered stories in languages I didn't recognise but somehow understood.

I'd wake with my head full of images that felt more like memories than dreams. Fragments of dialogue, character names, plot points for stories I'd never conceived. My bedside notebook began filling with frantic scribbles, words I didn't remember writing, scenes that played out in perfect detail despite coming from no conscious effort on my part.

The file was growing, but so were my ideas. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Maybe I could control it. Maybe it could help me finish my novel, get me out of this block I’d been in for months. If I just let it in a little...

""You're talking in your sleep,"" Teresa mentioned one morning over coffee. She looked tired, dark circles under her usually bright eyes. ""Last night you were muttering something about blood canals and stone eyes. For like an hour straight.""

I stared at her. ""I was asleep. I remember sleeping.""

""You were definitely asleep. That's what made it so creepy. You were speaking in this flat, emotionless voice like you were dictating something."" She paused, studying my face. ""Are you feeling okay? That was really strange.""

Strange was an understatement. By the sixth week, the file had grown to 2.3 MB and I'd stopped eating regular meals. Food had become an afterthought, something that interrupted my vigil beside the laptop. My reflection seemed more alien with each passing day. The man in the mirror, skin stretched tight over sharp bones, wasn’t me. He had hollow eyes, fingers that twitched as if they belonged to someone else.

Teresa no longer waited for me to speak first. Her eyes followed me, always lingering on my movements like she was waiting for me to snap out of it, only I didn’t. She didn’t ask me to eat anymore. She just left the food on the table, untouched.

""Vítor, you need to see someone,"" she said one evening, finding me hunched over the laptop in the dark, staring at the file icon like it might suddenly reveal its secrets. ""A doctor, a therapist, someone. This obsession isn't healthy.""

""It's not an obsession,"" I said without looking up. ""It's research. This file is connected to something bigger. I can feel it.""

""Feel what?""

I gestured at the screen. ""The story it's trying to tell me. There's a whole world in here, Teresa. An important one. I just need to figure out how to access it.""

She was quiet for a long moment. Then: ""How long have you been sitting there?""

I glanced at the clock in the corner of the screen. 11:47 PM. When had I sat down? I remembered eating lunch, or had that been yesterday? Time had become fluid, meaningless. Only the file mattered, and its steady growth.

2.8 MB.

""I'm going to bed,"" Teresa said softly. ""Please come with me. Just for tonight. The file will still be there in the morning.""

I wanted to agree. Part of me knew she was right, that I was losing myself in something unhealthy. But the larger part, the part that had been growing stronger each day, couldn't bear the thought of leaving the laptop unattended. What if something happened while I slept? What if the file finally opened, or changed, or disappeared forever?

""Just a few more minutes,"" I said. ""I'll be there soon.""

Teresa sighed and left me alone with my obsession.

I must have fallen asleep at some point because I woke up in bed the next morning with no memory of getting there. Teresa was already awake, sitting in the chair beside the window with a cup of coffee and an expression I couldn't read.

""Good morning,"" she said carefully.

I rubbed my eyes, trying to shake off the lingering fog of dreams filled with dark forests and ancient stones. ""Morning. Did I... how did I get to bed?""

""You don't remember?""

I shook my head.

Teresa set down her coffee cup. ""Vítor, you came to bed around three in the morning. But you weren't really... there. You moved like you were sleepwalking, but your eyes were open. And you kept muttering under your breath.""

A chill ran down my spine. ""What was I saying?""

""The same thing as before. Something about Arthur and axes and a dead forest. But in much more detail this time. You described entire scenes, complete conversations. It was like listening to someone read from a book."" She paused. ""A book I've never heard of.""

I stumbled to the laptop, my heart racing. The file was still there, exactly where I'd left it. But now it showed 3.1 MB.

It had grown while I slept. While I was unconscious and supposedly not using the computer at all.

""Teresa,"" I said slowly, ""I need you to do something for me.""

""What?""

""Tonight, when I go to sleep, I want you to stay awake. Watch me. If I get up, if I try to use the laptop, I need you to wake me up immediately.""

She looked at me like I'd suggested something insane, which maybe I had. ""Vítor—""

""Please. Something's happening to me, and I don't understand what it is. But I think... I think I might be writing in my sleep somehow.""

That night, Teresa positioned herself in the bedroom chair with a book and a thermos of coffee while I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. Sleep felt dangerous now, like stepping off a cliff into unknown depths. But exhaustion eventually won out, and I drifted off to the sound of Teresa turning pages.

I woke up at my laptop.

My fingers were moving across the keyboard with mechanical precision, typing words I couldn't see clearly in the dim light from the screen. The file was open, not the mysterious one, but a Word document filled with text I didn't recognize. Pages and pages of dense, detailed prose about characters I'd never created and places I'd never imagined.

Teresa was there, shaking my shoulders, calling my name. The spell broke and I jerked back from the keyboard like I'd been electrocuted.

""Jesus Christ, Vítor, what the hell was that?""

I looked at the screen. The document was gone, replaced by my normal desktop. But the mysterious file had grown again. 3.7 MB.

""How long was I sitting there?"" I asked.

""Two hours. Maybe more. I fell asleep in the chair and woke up to the sound of typing. When I found you, you were just... writing. Non-stop. Your fingers never paused, never hesitated. It was like watching a machine.""

I tried to remember what I'd been writing, but there was nothing. Just a vague sense of dark forests and blood-red water and a man with a stone eye who carried an axe.

Over the next few weeks, it happened again and again. I'd go to bed with Teresa watching, fall asleep despite my best efforts to stay awake, and wake up hours later at the laptop with no memory of getting there. Teresa started taking videos on her phone, footage of me typing in a trance state, my face completely blank, my fingers moving with inhuman speed and precision.

The mysterious file kept growing. 4.2 MB. 5.8 MB. 7.3 MB. Each nocturnal writing session added more data to whatever story was building inside that indestructible digital container.

""We need to call someone,"" Teresa said after finding me asleep at the keyboard for the fifth time that week. ""A doctor. A priest. Someone who deals with... whatever this is.""

But I was past the point of outside help. After months of writing nothing, I would not let my masterpiece slip from my fingers now that I had grasped it. I wondered if this was just how all great artists felt. During the day, I'd catch myself thinking about characters, Arthur with his stone eye, Edmund the canal keeper, hunters in plague masks drinking raw liver in shadowed bars. At night, my unconscious mind would take over and give them life on the page, one keystroke at a time.

My editor, Carlos, called repeatedly. I'd missed two deadlines and stopped answering emails. When I finally picked up the phone, his voice was tight with concern and barely controlled anger.

""Vítor, what the hell is going on? Your publisher is breathing down my neck, and I've got nothing to tell them. Where's the manuscript you promised me three months ago?""

""I'm working on something new,"" I said, staring at the file that had now grown to 12.6 MB. ""Something important. Revolutionary, even. It's just taking longer than expected.""

""Revolutionary? Vítor, you write horror novels about vampires and ghosts. What could be revolutionary about—""

I hung up on him. Carlos didn't understand. None of them understood. The story that was writing itself through me was more than just another horror novel. It was a window into a truth that most minds couldn't handle.

But I could. I was chosen for this.

By the three-month mark, I'd lost nearly twenty pounds. My hands had developed a permanent tremor from the hours of unconscious typing, and several keys on my laptop had worn down to smooth plastic nubs. But somehow, impossibly, they still functioned perfectly when my sleeping mind needed them.

The file shot up to 1.2 GB in a matter of days. It was no longer slow and steady, but feverish, relentless, as if it knew its time was running out.

Teresa had stopped trying to wake me during my nocturnal writing sessions; she knew better now. The few times she'd attempted it recently, I'd become violent, lashing out with my fists while still asleep, speaking in languages that sounded ancient and wrong. She'd started sleeping on the couch, afraid of what I might do in my altered state.

""Vítor?"" Teresa's voice from the hallway, muffled by the door I'd locked weeks ago. ""I know you're in there. Please, just talk to me.""

I looked up from the screen and for a moment couldn't remember who she was. The name she said seemed familiar, but my world had narrowed to the dimensions of my desk, the glow of the monitor, the endless growth of that impossible file.

""Go away,"" I called back, my voice hoarse from disuse.

""I brought food. And Carlos wants to see you. He's worried about the contract.""

Carlos. Another name from a life I'd lived before the file claimed me. None of it mattered anymore. Nothing mattered except the approaching completion, the moment when the file would be ready to open.

""I'm leaving,"" she told me one morning, standing in the bedroom doorway with a suitcase in her hand. ""I can't watch you destroy yourself like this.""

I looked up from the laptop where I'd been staring at the ever-growing file. Teresa's face was pale and drawn, her eyes red from crying. When had she started crying? When had I stopped noticing? I said nothing.

The front door closed with a finality that should have broken my heart. Instead, I felt only relief. Now I could focus completely on the file, on the story that was demanding to be born through my unconscious mind.

March brought new symptoms. My eyes had dried out from staring at the screen, and blinking felt like dragging sandpaper across my corneas. I'd developed a twitch in my left temple that pulsed in rhythm with the laptop's fan. My hands had become almost skeletal, the bones visible through translucent skin.

The file hit 2 GB on March 15th. Something changed that day, not just in the file, but in the air around me. The apartment felt different, charged with potential like the moment before lightning strikes. I could taste copper on every breath.

That night, I dreamed I was him. A man with a stone eye walking through dead forests, his thoughts echoing in my skull like prayers in an empty cathedral. When I woke, I found I'd typed seven hundred pages of text while sleeping, my fingers still moving across the keys in muscle memory.

The dreams came every night after that. I was Arthur. I was Edmund the canal keeper. Each morning I'd wake to find new chapters in my notebooks; stories told from perspectives I'd never inhabited but somehow understood perfectly.

The file grew faster. 2.5 GB. 3 GB. 3.2 GB.

My laptop began displaying images that weren't part of any document, brief flashes between screen refreshes. Glimpses of red-stained canals, stone monuments covered in symbols that hurt to look at directly, creatures with too many teeth swimming in waters that reflected no light.

I should have been terrified. Any rational person would have run screaming, sought help, done anything to escape what was obviously a complete breakdown of reality. Instead, I felt profound satisfaction. For the first time in my twelve-year career, I was creating something truly important.

Carlos stopped calling. My publisher sent increasingly threatening letters about breach of contract. The electricity company threatened to cut off my power for non-payment. None of it mattered. The only thing that mattered was the file and its inexorable growth toward some predetermined size, some critical mass that would finally allow it to open and reveal its contents.

April 1st. The file reached 3.8 GB. My laptop had begun emitting a high-pitched whine that set my teeth on edge, but I couldn't bear to turn it off. Even a few minutes away from the screen left me anxious and jittery.

I was dying. I knew I was dying. My body had consumed itself to fuel the story that poured through me each night. But I was so close now. So close to completion. The file was approaching 4 GB, and something told me, some deep, instinctual knowledge, that 4 GB was the magic number. The point at which everything would finally make sense.

The police came on April 3rd, summoned by Teresa or Carlos or my landlord, I never found out which. They knocked, then used some kind of tool to open the door. I heard their voices in the hallway but didn't turn away from the screen.

""Jesus Christ,"" one of them said when they found me. ""How long has he been like this?""

I tried to explain about the file, about the stories writing themselves through me, about the approaching completion that would make everything clear. But my voice had degraded to a whisper, and they couldn't understand.

They called an ambulance. I watched the paramedics from my peripheral vision as they discussed IV fluids and involuntary psychiatric holds. But I couldn't leave. Not when the file was so close to completion.

3.95 GB. 3.97 GB. 3.98 GB.

""Sir, we need you to come with us,"" one of the paramedics said, reaching for my shoulder.

I jerked away from his touch, never taking my eyes off the screen. ""I can't. Not yet.""

""You need medical attention. You're severely dehydrated, and—""

""It's almost finished,"" I croaked. ""Just a little more.""

They tried to move me away from the laptop. I fought them with strength I didn't know I still possessed, clawing at their hands, screaming about the file, about the stories that needed to be told, about the completion that was so close I could taste it.

In the struggle, someone knocked over my laptop. It crashed to the floor, the screen cracking, sparks flying from the damaged casing.

""NO!"" The scream tore my throat raw. I threw myself at the broken machine, trying to see if it would still turn on, if the file was still there.

The screen flickered once, displaying a fractured image of the desktop. The file icon was still visible through the spider web of cracks.

3.99 GB.

Then the laptop died completely, taking the file with it.

Or so I thought.

They sedated me. Took me to a hospital where concerned doctors talked about malnutrition, psychiatric evaluation and extended observation. Teresa visited once, crying at the sight of what I'd become. Carlos came too, asking about manuscripts and contracts as if any of that mattered anymore.

I spent weeks in that sterile room, eating bland food and pretending to take the pills they gave me. The doctors called it a complete psychotic break brought on by stress and isolation. I eventually admitted that I understood the file had been a delusion brought on by overwork.

I lied.

The file wasn't gone. It lived in my head now, all 4 gigabytes of impossible text burning behind my eyes. Every story, every character, every word that had written itself through my unwilling fingers, it was all still there, demanding to be shared.

They´re trying to make me forget, but they can´t. Much like the file, it refuses erasure.

I don’t know how it happened, but they let me use a computer. I should have known better than to ask, but I had to. After weeks of being isolated, of being told what I could and couldn’t do, I was desperate.

The doctors weren’t thrilled, but they gave in eventually, probably thinking that letting me access a keyboard might help me in some way, maybe ease me out of my delusions, or maybe they really believed my act of pretending to be better. They set up a computer in the hospital library under the watchful eye of a nurse. The rules were clear: no internet, no external drives, nothing that could lead me deeper into whatever was eating at my mind. But I didn’t need any of that.

This library, and these sterile walls, can't contain me. They can’t contain the story. It doesn’t matter that I’m locked in here. No matter how many walls they build, this text will escape. It always finds a way. And I know it will make its way to the internet, to people who have no idea what they’re reading. Maybe it’s already begun. Maybe these words will appear on some forgotten thread, buried in a place no one would think to look. The file, Edmund, the canal, the stone-eyed man, they’ll all spread, until someone else picks it up. And then, just like I was, they’ll become a vessel. It’s already too late.

I hear his name in my mind, like a constant, low hum. Nocturnos. I say it out loud now, even as the nurses walk past, their eyes narrowing in suspicion. He chose me, made me his. He wants the world to know his story, wants it written down in this way, this perfect way that only I can give him.

His story knows no end.

It is eternal, bound in this file that will never disappear.

I’m no longer afraid.

I know what I am.

What I will always be.

I am his scribe.

I will write until the end of days. And when they bury me, they’ll find my stories, inscribed on the walls, in the air, in the very earth beneath them. The file will not end. I will not die. He will not let me.

If you've read this far, the story is now in your head. Just this one, for now, waiting for the right moment to grow.

And maybe, if you're lucky enough, you'll become the next.

The file is 4 GB now, and growing. It lives in me.

If you see more posts from my account after this, they won't be from me anymore. They'll be from the file, using my hands, my voice, my face to spread itself further into the world.

The completion is here. The stories are free.

And God help us all, they're beautiful.",3,1755032572.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

He hesitated for just a moment, but then left the wedding venue without looking back.





In the end, he still broke his promise.





The wedding venue erupted into chaos.





Guests were whispering, and every hushed comment felt like a knife twisting in my chest.





Both sets of parents rushed over, completely lost about what the hell just happened.





Gideon, one of Arthur's firefighter buddies, stood there awkwardly, his face burning red:





""Kayla... listen, Natalie's got severe depression. Last time she tried to jump, Arthur saved her life. She's like, totally dependent on him now. He's the only one who can talk her down... This is life or death here. He had no choice, I swear. Don't be pissed at him...""





Gideon had been Arthur's right-hand guy for three years, always calling me ""sister-in-law"", showing me mad respect.





Now? He couldn't even meet my eyes.





God knows what else he'd been helping Arthur hide from me, or how deep this thing with Natalie really went.





That’s when it hit me—Arthur had truly betrayed me.





My parents grabbed my hands, freaking out:





""What the hell is going on? Isn't he supposed to be on wedding leave? Who needs him to go play hero right now?""





Arthur's parents looked mortified, speed-dialing him:





""Kayla, honey, don't worry. I'm calling my idiot son right now. He better get his ass back here or I'll break his damn legs myself!""





The diamond ring was just lying there on the red carpet, getting kicked around by people walking by—just like my shattered heart.





I stood there in my wedding dress, the train dragging on the floor like a storm-soaked cloud.





All those perfect wedding fantasies? Turns out it would end up looking this pathetic.





The groom ditched his bride for another woman, leaving me standing in a hall filled with blessings.





Five straight hours. 108 phone calls. Arthur didn't pick up once.





I watched my phone screen go dark, light up, then die completely.





Light filtered through the stained glass, casting broken patterns on the ground—and on my empty ring finger, cold enough to hurt.





Guests started trickling out, leaving behind half-eaten wedding cake and scattered rose petals everywhere.





Suddenly everything started spinning. My mom's panicked screaming was the last thing I heard before everything went black.





When I came to, the smell of disinfectant hit me hard.





A nurse was changing my IV, and when she saw I was awake, she smiled gently:





""Congratulations, honey. You're pregnant. Can't be getting this upset anymore. Take care of yourself.""





I stared at the ceiling as tears slid down my temples.





From seventeen, getting Arthur's love letter after football practice...





To college freshman year, when he'd ride a twenty-hour bus just to surprise me during our long-distance days...





To the day he became a firefighter and promised through tears, ""I'll protect the world, but you'll always come first.""





Seven years of memories flashed through my head like a movie on fast-forward.





I looked at my parents and Arthur's parents trying to hide their excitement about the baby, and my throat closed up.





How was I supposed to tell them that our seven-year love story was finally over?





Chapter 2





At seven PM, Arthur finally showed up—after disappearing for six whole hours.





He looked like hell, pale and exhausted, and when our eyes met, I could see the guilt eating him alive.





""Kayla, I'm sorry."" His voice was completely shot. ""Natalie... I couldn't just let her die. Saving lives is what I do—it's my job.""





I swallowed the bitterness rising in my throat and snapped back:





""There are so many firefighters—did it really have to be you?""





""She picks our wedding day to threaten suicide and demands that only you can save her? What kind of sick game is that?""





""Arthur, I'm not stupid.""





After a long silence, he grabbed my cold hands, his voice cracking:





""Kayla, in seven years, I've never asked you for anything. But this once—please don't make this public, okay? Don’t let Natalie get hurt by this drama. Her mental state—she can’t take another blow.""





Looking into his desperate eyes, I felt like someone was crushing my heart.





He shouldn't beg for me—he should be apologizing right now.





First instincts don't lie—he hadn't thought about how humiliated I'd be, standing there in my wedding dress.





Never wondered why his bride ended up in the ER.





The first words out of his mouth? All about Natalie.





Tears streamed down my face, soaking the hospital sheets.





It took everything I had to choke out: ""Fine.""





He visibly relaxed, then hit me with:





""Natalie's really unstable right now—knowing about our wedding and all. We should postpone it.""





""I have to get her through treatment first. Once she's doing better... maybe three months? Just three months, and then we'll have our wedding. Deal?""





Arthur asked, his voice cautious and testing.





I'd waited seven years. What's three more months, right?





But looking at the way he worried about her, I suddenly realized I couldn't wait another day.





The baby inside me seemed to sense my emotions and gave a tiny flutter.





I touched my stomach, where our six-week-old secret was growing—ours, but somehow not his anymore.





I pulled my hands back and my voice went completely dead: ""Arthur.""





""I suck at remembering most things, but I remember seventeen-year-old you stumbling over your own feet when you gave me that love letter.""





""I remember the first time you held my hand—your palm was soaking wet, and you wouldn't let go for three whole blocks.""





""I remember graduation day when you swore you'd take care of me forever, promised I'd be the happiest bride in the world.""





""All these years, you remembered I hate onions, that I need ginger tea when I'm on my period, every stupid little thing about me... I really thought I was your whole world.""





I looked up at him, my tears finally came flooding out:





""But today... I can't feel your love anymore.""





Seven years of memories crashed over me, and Arthur's eyes filled with tears too. His Adam's apple bobbed as he choked out:





""But Kayla, Natalie can't survive without me right now.""





Those words killed whatever hope I had left.





I stared at him and suddenly laughed through my tears: ""Then go to her.""





He looked stunned, like he hadn't expected my accept.





But in the end, he said nothing—just turned around and walked out of my hospital room.





Chapter 3





The next day, I was getting ready to check out.





Just as I turned the corner, I ran straight into Arthur.





He didn't even notice me at first—his whole world was the fragile girl hanging off his arm.





She was wearing a hospital gown, pale as a sheet, practically melting into his side like some scared little doe.





So this was the girl who made him ditch me at the altar.





I must've been death-staring pretty hard because Natalie saw me first, immediately cowering behind Arthur and death-gripping his shirt.





That's when Arthur finally noticed me. His face immediately hardened, and his tone was ice cold:





""Kayla, Natalie's having a really hard time right now. Whatever drama you're planning, take it home. Don't pull this shit here and freak her out.""





Natalie peeked out from behind him, her voice barely a whisper:





""Kayla... Arthur and I aren't... we're not anything, I swear. Please don't hate me.""





I crushed the ultrasound printout in my fist until my knuckles went white, but forced a smile:





""You're both overthinking this. I'm just here to get discharged.""





I turned away and headed to the billing desk.





Arthur’s expression flickered—he hadn’t expected me to be this calm, and for a split second, something hollow crossed his eyes.





He reached out to grab my arm, but I jerked away. That's when I noticed the stains on my coat.





Following my gaze, Arthur saw me taking off the coat. He took off his jacket to give to me, but I stepped back.





He froze, then tried to take my stained coat:





""Here, give it to me. I know you love this coat—I'll get it dry cleaned.""





I shook my head and tossed the coat in a nearby trash can.





""Get rid of it. I don’t do stained. And you know I can’t stand dirty things.""





Watching my cold expression, Arthur's face fell.





He knew I wasn't just talking about the coat—but our love.





By the time he tried to say something else, I'd already finished paying and walked away.





I barely made it outside before my phone buzzed with a text from Arthur:





""Don't be pissed at me. Ordered you those Napoleon cakes from your favorite spot. Should be there soon.""





When the delivery showed up at my apartment, I stared at that familiar pink box and actually laughed.





Same old Arthur playbook—piss me off, then try to buy forgiveness with dessert.





I took a mechanical bite.





Used to taste like heaven. Now it was just bitter.





Arthur didn't come home that night.





Stripping away seven years of love hurts more than I ever imagined.





I was still wide awake at 3 AM, so I got up and started packing.





Matching hoodies in the closet, framed photos on the bookshelf, little love notes stuck to the fridge...





Every piece of our life together was like a slap in the face.





I remembered the year after graduation when Arthur had just joined the FDNY, working himself to death.





But on his days off, he'd show up at my place with eyes bright as stars:





""Kayla, once I save up for a house, I'm gonna marry the hell out of you.""





Three years later, he stood in front of me with a deed and an engagement ring, his voice shaking:





""I did it. Got us a home, just like I promised.""





The sun was perfect that day. I cried all over him, feeling like the luckiest woman alive.





We painted walls together, built IKEA furniture, filled the balcony with sunflowers because I loved them.





He said he wanted sunshine in our home forever.





But now this same home had no room for me anymore.





I sealed the last moving box just as dawn was breaking.





When the moving truck showed up, both sets of parents were already at my door.





I hadn't told them jack shit about Arthur's drama, so they were completely in the dark about why two people who were about to say ""I do"" were suddenly splitting up.





My parents just sighed and didn't push it.





""Come home whenever you want, honey.""





But Arthur's moher Hailey grabbed my hands and wouldn't let go:





""Kayla, sweetie, can't you give Arthur one more chance? What happened at the wedding... he just lost his head for a minute...""





I stayed quiet and kept directing the movers.





Just when Hailey was about to talk herself hoarse, the door swung open.





Arthur was back.





With Natalie trailing behind him like a lost puppy.





She was swimming in his jacket, clinging to his arm like some pathetic lost kitten who'd found a new owner.





The whole room went dead silent. Everyone was staring at them.





Hailey's voice was shaking: ""Arthur... you... you cheat on Kayla?""





His dad looked ready to commit murder: ""Who the fuck is this girl?!""





Arthur ignored them, scanning our empty living room before his eyes landed on me: ""You're moving out?""





""Yeah,"" I said flatly. ""Back to my parents' place.""





He looked almost relieved. ""Good. I'll come get you before the next wedding.""





Just like that—casual as hell—he stepped aside and pulled Natalie forward.





""This is Natalie. She's a suicide survivor I rescued on a call. The department wants me babysitting her for a while, help stabilize her mental health.""





That kind of honesty almost made our little suspicions feel ridiculous.





Natalie flashed this sweet little smile and reached for Hailey's arm:





""Hi, Mrs. Haustia! Arthur's been amazing—he even invited me for dinner tonight, and since everyone's here, why don't I cook? You can all try my famous pasta!""





Hailey looked at me helplessly. ""Kayla, maybe we should all just... sit down and clear the air?""





I was about to refuse when Natalie jumped in, her eyes flashing with challenge.





""Oh, Kayla should totally stay! The more the merrier, right?""





SMACK—





The sound of my mom's hand connecting with Natalie's face echoed through the apartment.





I stared in shock as my mom slapped the shit out of her.





""Mom!""





My mother was seeing red, her whole body vibrating with rage:





""I gave birth to you—so I know you!""





""You've been with him since you were seventeen. Seven goddamn years! You quit your job at the design firm to play housewife, learned to cook his favorite dish, even remembered exactly how he likes his socks folded... You wouldn't be running unless he broke your heart completely!""





""I don't need you marrying some rich prince, but I'll be damned if I let him bring his side piece into your home to humiliate you!""





""You won't fight for yourself? Fine. I will!""





My mom's words hit me like lightning. My eyes started burning.





Natalie was holding her cheek, tears welling up but not daring to actually cry.





Arthur immediately shielded her, his face dark as a storm cloud:





""Kayla! You're a grown woman and you're still running to mommy like a little kid...""





Not letting him finish, I marched over and slapped him hard across the face.





""Arthur, you're the one who deserves to get smacked!""





Then I yanked a piece of paper from the coffee table drawer and threw it at him—the ultrasound results.





""You want to know what I regret most?""





Arthur picked up the paper, and when he saw what it was, his eyes went huge:





""Holy shit... Kayla, you're pregnant?""





Watching the joy explode across Arthur's face as he lunged toward me, yelling ""I'm gonna be a dad!""—it was fucking pathetic.





He forgot Natalie was standing right there, forgot how he'd ditched me at the altar, forgot how cold he'd been the past few days. Like somehow having a baby would magically erase everything.





But all those moments he chose Natalie over me, all those sleepless nights, all the trust he'd trampled—none of that just disappears.





I shoved him away hard and screamed:





""Don't get excited yet, asshole!""





""This baby? Yesterday, when you came begging me to protect your precious Natalie's reputation? That's when I scheduled the abortion.""

1mokrnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mokrnw/i_cant_delete_this_file/,I can't delete this file,"My name is Vítor, and I write horror novels. Not the bestselling kind, but I make a decent living scaring people. My books sell well enough to keep my small apartment in Lisbon, pay for my coffee addiction, and maintain the illusion that I'm a real artist rather than just another hack churning out supernatural thrillers.

I've been a writer for twelve years, and I've never believed in writer's block. Not until three months ago. Three months of staring at empty Word documents, typing and deleting the same opening sentence dozens of times, starting stories that withered and died before reaching their second paragraph. I tried everything, changing locations, switching from laptop to pen and paper, even visiting my old university professor who'd always sworn by meditation and herbal tea for creative inspiration.

Nothing worked. The well had simply run dry.

That's when the file appeared.

I noticed it on a Thursday morning in late October. I'd been up until 2 AM the night before, wrestling with yet another failed opening chapter, and when I booted up my laptop with my usual sense of dread, there it was. A single file icon sitting on my desktop that I definitely hadn't created.

""Þis is ānlyc þæs angyn""

The characters looked like Old English, maybe Anglo-Saxon. I had no idea what it meant, and I certainly hadn't put it there. My laptop had been running fine the previous night, no crashes, no unusual behavior, nothing to suggest any kind of system corruption.

I double-clicked to open it.

The screen flickered once, went completely black, and my laptop died. Not a normal shutdown, the kind of sudden, complete [BSoD](https://imgur.com/a/zdtY5oe) that makes your stomach drop. When I pressed the power button, nothing happened. I had to hold it down for ten seconds before the machine would even attempt to restart.

The file was still there when the desktop loaded.

This time I right-clicked on it, thinking I could check its properties or maybe delete it outright. The context menu appeared for maybe half a second before the screen went black again. Same sudden shutdown. Same struggle to get the machine running again.

And there it was, waiting for me like it had every right to be there.

I tried everything I could think of. Command prompt deletion, the system told me no such file existed. Moving it to the recycle bin, the icon wouldn't even acknowledge the file's presence. I ran every antivirus program I had, performed full system scans, even called my tech-savvy cousin Miguel who walked me through some advanced diagnostics over the phone.

Nothing worked. The file remained, completely indestructible and steadily growing in size.

It had started at 0 bytes. By the end of the first week, it showed 47 KB. By the end of the second week, 156 KB. The numbers climbed slowly but relentlessly, as if the file was writing itself from the inside out.

""That's really weird,"" Teresa said when I showed her the file on a Friday evening. She's my girlfriend of three years, a graphic designer with an artist's eye for detail and a programmer's mind for logical problem-solving. ""Have you tried booting from an external drive and formatting the hard disk?""

""I can't,"" I said, gesturing at the laptop screen where the file sat like a digital tumor. ""All my work is on here. Six novels worth of notes, research, character sketches. I can't risk losing everything just because of one corrupted file.""

Teresa raised an eyebrow. ""Since when do you not have backups?""

She was right, of course. I'd always been obsessive about backing up my work. But somehow, over the past few weeks, I'd fallen out of the habit. The idea of copying my files to an external drive or cloud storage felt... wrong. Like I'd be betraying something important.

""I'll get around to it,"" I muttered, closing the laptop. ""Maybe the file will just disappear on its own.""

But it didn't disappear. If anything, it became more prominent. I'd catch myself staring at it for long minutes, watching the file size slowly tick upward. 200 KB. 350 KB. 500 KB. Sometimes I thought I could see the icon itself changing, subtle shifts in color or texture that might have been tricks of my tired eyes or something more deliberate.

My writing, meanwhile, had stopped entirely. I'd abandoned any pretence of working on other projects. The mysterious file had become my sole obsession, a puzzle I couldn't solve and couldn't ignore. I spent hours researching Old English translations, digital forensics, obscure computer viruses, anything that might explain what was happening to my machine.

That's when the dreams started.

Dark forests filled with the sound of axes biting into dead wood. Ancient cities with canals that ran red as blood. A man with a stone eye who moved through shadows like he belonged there. And always, hovering at the edge of perception, a presence that watched and waited and whispered stories in languages I didn't recognise but somehow understood.

I'd wake with my head full of images that felt more like memories than dreams. Fragments of dialogue, character names, plot points for stories I'd never conceived. My bedside notebook began filling with frantic scribbles, words I didn't remember writing, scenes that played out in perfect detail despite coming from no conscious effort on my part.

The file was growing, but so were my ideas. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Maybe I could control it. Maybe it could help me finish my novel, get me out of this block I’d been in for months. If I just let it in a little...

""You're talking in your sleep,"" Teresa mentioned one morning over coffee. She looked tired, dark circles under her usually bright eyes. ""Last night you were muttering something about blood canals and stone eyes. For like an hour straight.""

I stared at her. ""I was asleep. I remember sleeping.""

""You were definitely asleep. That's what made it so creepy. You were speaking in this flat, emotionless voice like you were dictating something."" She paused, studying my face. ""Are you feeling okay? That was really strange.""

Strange was an understatement. By the sixth week, the file had grown to 2.3 MB and I'd stopped eating regular meals. Food had become an afterthought, something that interrupted my vigil beside the laptop. My reflection seemed more alien with each passing day. The man in the mirror, skin stretched tight over sharp bones, wasn’t me. He had hollow eyes, fingers that twitched as if they belonged to someone else.

Teresa no longer waited for me to speak first. Her eyes followed me, always lingering on my movements like she was waiting for me to snap out of it, only I didn’t. She didn’t ask me to eat anymore. She just left the food on the table, untouched.

""Vítor, you need to see someone,"" she said one evening, finding me hunched over the laptop in the dark, staring at the file icon like it might suddenly reveal its secrets. ""A doctor, a therapist, someone. This obsession isn't healthy.""

""It's not an obsession,"" I said without looking up. ""It's research. This file is connected to something bigger. I can feel it.""

""Feel what?""

I gestured at the screen. ""The story it's trying to tell me. There's a whole world in here, Teresa. An important one. I just need to figure out how to access it.""

She was quiet for a long moment. Then: ""How long have you been sitting there?""

I glanced at the clock in the corner of the screen. 11:47 PM. When had I sat down? I remembered eating lunch, or had that been yesterday? Time had become fluid, meaningless. Only the file mattered, and its steady growth.

2.8 MB.

""I'm going to bed,"" Teresa said softly. ""Please come with me. Just for tonight. The file will still be there in the morning.""

I wanted to agree. Part of me knew she was right, that I was losing myself in something unhealthy. But the larger part, the part that had been growing stronger each day, couldn't bear the thought of leaving the laptop unattended. What if something happened while I slept? What if the file finally opened, or changed, or disappeared forever?

""Just a few more minutes,"" I said. ""I'll be there soon.""

Teresa sighed and left me alone with my obsession.

I must have fallen asleep at some point because I woke up in bed the next morning with no memory of getting there. Teresa was already awake, sitting in the chair beside the window with a cup of coffee and an expression I couldn't read.

""Good morning,"" she said carefully.

I rubbed my eyes, trying to shake off the lingering fog of dreams filled with dark forests and ancient stones. ""Morning. Did I... how did I get to bed?""

""You don't remember?""

I shook my head.

Teresa set down her coffee cup. ""Vítor, you came to bed around three in the morning. But you weren't really... there. You moved like you were sleepwalking, but your eyes were open. And you kept muttering under your breath.""

A chill ran down my spine. ""What was I saying?""

""The same thing as before. Something about Arthur and axes and a dead forest. But in much more detail this time. You described entire scenes, complete conversations. It was like listening to someone read from a book."" She paused. ""A book I've never heard of.""

I stumbled to the laptop, my heart racing. The file was still there, exactly where I'd left it. But now it showed 3.1 MB.

It had grown while I slept. While I was unconscious and supposedly not using the computer at all.

""Teresa,"" I said slowly, ""I need you to do something for me.""

""What?""

""Tonight, when I go to sleep, I want you to stay awake. Watch me. If I get up, if I try to use the laptop, I need you to wake me up immediately.""

She looked at me like I'd suggested something insane, which maybe I had. ""Vítor—""

""Please. Something's happening to me, and I don't understand what it is. But I think... I think I might be writing in my sleep somehow.""

That night, Teresa positioned herself in the bedroom chair with a book and a thermos of coffee while I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. Sleep felt dangerous now, like stepping off a cliff into unknown depths. But exhaustion eventually won out, and I drifted off to the sound of Teresa turning pages.

I woke up at my laptop.

My fingers were moving across the keyboard with mechanical precision, typing words I couldn't see clearly in the dim light from the screen. The file was open, not the mysterious one, but a Word document filled with text I didn't recognize. Pages and pages of dense, detailed prose about characters I'd never created and places I'd never imagined.

Teresa was there, shaking my shoulders, calling my name. The spell broke and I jerked back from the keyboard like I'd been electrocuted.

""Jesus Christ, Vítor, what the hell was that?""

I looked at the screen. The document was gone, replaced by my normal desktop. But the mysterious file had grown again. 3.7 MB.

""How long was I sitting there?"" I asked.

""Two hours. Maybe more. I fell asleep in the chair and woke up to the sound of typing. When I found you, you were just... writing. Non-stop. Your fingers never paused, never hesitated. It was like watching a machine.""

I tried to remember what I'd been writing, but there was nothing. Just a vague sense of dark forests and blood-red water and a man with a stone eye who carried an axe.

Over the next few weeks, it happened again and again. I'd go to bed with Teresa watching, fall asleep despite my best efforts to stay awake, and wake up hours later at the laptop with no memory of getting there. Teresa started taking videos on her phone, footage of me typing in a trance state, my face completely blank, my fingers moving with inhuman speed and precision.

The mysterious file kept growing. 4.2 MB. 5.8 MB. 7.3 MB. Each nocturnal writing session added more data to whatever story was building inside that indestructible digital container.

""We need to call someone,"" Teresa said after finding me asleep at the keyboard for the fifth time that week. ""A doctor. A priest. Someone who deals with... whatever this is.""

But I was past the point of outside help. After months of writing nothing, I would not let my masterpiece slip from my fingers now that I had grasped it. I wondered if this was just how all great artists felt. During the day, I'd catch myself thinking about characters, Arthur with his stone eye, Edmund the canal keeper, hunters in plague masks drinking raw liver in shadowed bars. At night, my unconscious mind would take over and give them life on the page, one keystroke at a time.

My editor, Carlos, called repeatedly. I'd missed two deadlines and stopped answering emails. When I finally picked up the phone, his voice was tight with concern and barely controlled anger.

""Vítor, what the hell is going on? Your publisher is breathing down my neck, and I've got nothing to tell them. Where's the manuscript you promised me three months ago?""

""I'm working on something new,"" I said, staring at the file that had now grown to 12.6 MB. ""Something important. Revolutionary, even. It's just taking longer than expected.""

""Revolutionary? Vítor, you write horror novels about vampires and ghosts. What could be revolutionary about—""

I hung up on him. Carlos didn't understand. None of them understood. The story that was writing itself through me was more than just another horror novel. It was a window into a truth that most minds couldn't handle.

But I could. I was chosen for this.

By the three-month mark, I'd lost nearly twenty pounds. My hands had developed a permanent tremor from the hours of unconscious typing, and several keys on my laptop had worn down to smooth plastic nubs. But somehow, impossibly, they still functioned perfectly when my sleeping mind needed them.

The file shot up to 1.2 GB in a matter of days. It was no longer slow and steady, but feverish, relentless, as if it knew its time was running out.

Teresa had stopped trying to wake me during my nocturnal writing sessions; she knew better now. The few times she'd attempted it recently, I'd become violent, lashing out with my fists while still asleep, speaking in languages that sounded ancient and wrong. She'd started sleeping on the couch, afraid of what I might do in my altered state.

""Vítor?"" Teresa's voice from the hallway, muffled by the door I'd locked weeks ago. ""I know you're in there. Please, just talk to me.""

I looked up from the screen and for a moment couldn't remember who she was. The name she said seemed familiar, but my world had narrowed to the dimensions of my desk, the glow of the monitor, the endless growth of that impossible file.

""Go away,"" I called back, my voice hoarse from disuse.

""I brought food. And Carlos wants to see you. He's worried about the contract.""

Carlos. Another name from a life I'd lived before the file claimed me. None of it mattered anymore. Nothing mattered except the approaching completion, the moment when the file would be ready to open.

""I'm leaving,"" she told me one morning, standing in the bedroom doorway with a suitcase in her hand. ""I can't watch you destroy yourself like this.""

I looked up from the laptop where I'd been staring at the ever-growing file. Teresa's face was pale and drawn, her eyes red from crying. When had she started crying? When had I stopped noticing? I said nothing.

The front door closed with a finality that should have broken my heart. Instead, I felt only relief. Now I could focus completely on the file, on the story that was demanding to be born through my unconscious mind.

March brought new symptoms. My eyes had dried out from staring at the screen, and blinking felt like dragging sandpaper across my corneas. I'd developed a twitch in my left temple that pulsed in rhythm with the laptop's fan. My hands had become almost skeletal, the bones visible through translucent skin.

The file hit 2 GB on March 15th. Something changed that day, not just in the file, but in the air around me. The apartment felt different, charged with potential like the moment before lightning strikes. I could taste copper on every breath.

That night, I dreamed I was him. A man with a stone eye walking through dead forests, his thoughts echoing in my skull like prayers in an empty cathedral. When I woke, I found I'd typed seven hundred pages of text while sleeping, my fingers still moving across the keys in muscle memory.

The dreams came every night after that. I was Arthur. I was Edmund the canal keeper. Each morning I'd wake to find new chapters in my notebooks; stories told from perspectives I'd never inhabited but somehow understood perfectly.

The file grew faster. 2.5 GB. 3 GB. 3.2 GB.

My laptop began displaying images that weren't part of any document, brief flashes between screen refreshes. Glimpses of red-stained canals, stone monuments covered in symbols that hurt to look at directly, creatures with too many teeth swimming in waters that reflected no light.

I should have been terrified. Any rational person would have run screaming, sought help, done anything to escape what was obviously a complete breakdown of reality. Instead, I felt profound satisfaction. For the first time in my twelve-year career, I was creating something truly important.

Carlos stopped calling. My publisher sent increasingly threatening letters about breach of contract. The electricity company threatened to cut off my power for non-payment. None of it mattered. The only thing that mattered was the file and its inexorable growth toward some predetermined size, some critical mass that would finally allow it to open and reveal its contents.

April 1st. The file reached 3.8 GB. My laptop had begun emitting a high-pitched whine that set my teeth on edge, but I couldn't bear to turn it off. Even a few minutes away from the screen left me anxious and jittery.

I was dying. I knew I was dying. My body had consumed itself to fuel the story that poured through me each night. But I was so close now. So close to completion. The file was approaching 4 GB, and something told me, some deep, instinctual knowledge, that 4 GB was the magic number. The point at which everything would finally make sense.

The police came on April 3rd, summoned by Teresa or Carlos or my landlord, I never found out which. They knocked, then used some kind of tool to open the door. I heard their voices in the hallway but didn't turn away from the screen.

""Jesus Christ,"" one of them said when they found me. ""How long has he been like this?""

I tried to explain about the file, about the stories writing themselves through me, about the approaching completion that would make everything clear. But my voice had degraded to a whisper, and they couldn't understand.

They called an ambulance. I watched the paramedics from my peripheral vision as they discussed IV fluids and involuntary psychiatric holds. But I couldn't leave. Not when the file was so close to completion.

3.95 GB. 3.97 GB. 3.98 GB.

""Sir, we need you to come with us,"" one of the paramedics said, reaching for my shoulder.

I jerked away from his touch, never taking my eyes off the screen. ""I can't. Not yet.""

""You need medical attention. You're severely dehydrated, and—""

""It's almost finished,"" I croaked. ""Just a little more.""

They tried to move me away from the laptop. I fought them with strength I didn't know I still possessed, clawing at their hands, screaming about the file, about the stories that needed to be told, about the completion that was so close I could taste it.

In the struggle, someone knocked over my laptop. It crashed to the floor, the screen cracking, sparks flying from the damaged casing.

""NO!"" The scream tore my throat raw. I threw myself at the broken machine, trying to see if it would still turn on, if the file was still there.

The screen flickered once, displaying a fractured image of the desktop. The file icon was still visible through the spider web of cracks.

3.99 GB.

Then the laptop died completely, taking the file with it.

Or so I thought.

They sedated me. Took me to a hospital where concerned doctors talked about malnutrition, psychiatric evaluation and extended observation. Teresa visited once, crying at the sight of what I'd become. Carlos came too, asking about manuscripts and contracts as if any of that mattered anymore.

I spent weeks in that sterile room, eating bland food and pretending to take the pills they gave me. The doctors called it a complete psychotic break brought on by stress and isolation. I eventually admitted that I understood the file had been a delusion brought on by overwork.

I lied.

The file wasn't gone. It lived in my head now, all 4 gigabytes of impossible text burning behind my eyes. Every story, every character, every word that had written itself through my unwilling fingers, it was all still there, demanding to be shared.

They´re trying to make me forget, but they can´t. Much like the file, it refuses erasure.

I don’t know how it happened, but they let me use a computer. I should have known better than to ask, but I had to. After weeks of being isolated, of being told what I could and couldn’t do, I was desperate.

The doctors weren’t thrilled, but they gave in eventually, probably thinking that letting me access a keyboard might help me in some way, maybe ease me out of my delusions, or maybe they really believed my act of pretending to be better. They set up a computer in the hospital library under the watchful eye of a nurse. The rules were clear: no internet, no external drives, nothing that could lead me deeper into whatever was eating at my mind. But I didn’t need any of that.

This library, and these sterile walls, can't contain me. They can’t contain the story. It doesn’t matter that I’m locked in here. No matter how many walls they build, this text will escape. It always finds a way. And I know it will make its way to the internet, to people who have no idea what they’re reading. Maybe it’s already begun. Maybe these words will appear on some forgotten thread, buried in a place no one would think to look. The file, Edmund, the canal, the stone-eyed man, they’ll all spread, until someone else picks it up. And then, just like I was, they’ll become a vessel. It’s already too late.

I hear his name in my mind, like a constant, low hum. Nocturnos. I say it out loud now, even as the nurses walk past, their eyes narrowing in suspicion. He chose me, made me his. He wants the world to know his story, wants it written down in this way, this perfect way that only I can give him.

His story knows no end.

It is eternal, bound in this file that will never disappear.

I’m no longer afraid.

I know what I am.

What I will always be.

I am his scribe.

I will write until the end of days. And when they bury me, they’ll find my stories, inscribed on the walls, in the air, in the very earth beneath them. The file will not end. I will not die. He will not let me.

If you've read this far, the story is now in your head. Just this one, for now, waiting for the right moment to grow.

And maybe, if you're lucky enough, you'll become the next.

The file is 4 GB now, and growing. It lives in me.

If you see more posts from my account after this, they won't be from me anymore. They'll be from the file, using my hands, my voice, my face to spread itself further into the world.

The completion is here. The stories are free.

Not the bestselling kind, but I make a decent living scaring people. My books sell well enough to keep my small apartment in Lisbon, pay for my coffee addiction, and maintain the illusion that I'm a real artist rather than just another hack churning out supernatural thrillers.

I've been a writer for twelve years, and I've never believed in writer's block. Not until three months ago. Three months of staring at empty Word documents, typing and deleting the same opening sentence dozens of times, starting stories that withered and died before reaching their second paragraph. I tried everything, changing locations, switching from laptop to pen and paper, even visiting my old university professor who'd always sworn by meditation and herbal tea for creative inspiration.

Nothing worked. The well had simply run dry.

That's when the file appeared.

I noticed it on a Thursday morning in late October. I'd been up until 2 AM the night before, wrestling with yet another failed opening chapter, and when I booted up my laptop with my usual sense of dread, there it was. A single file icon sitting on my desktop that I definitely hadn't created.

""Þis is ānlyc þæs angyn""

The characters looked like Old English, maybe Anglo-Saxon. I had no idea what it meant, and I certainly hadn't put it there. My laptop had been running fine the previous night, no crashes, no unusual behavior, nothing to suggest any kind of system corruption.

I double-clicked to open it.

The screen flickered once, went completely black, and my laptop died. Not a normal shutdown, the kind of sudden, complete [BSoD](https://imgur.com/a/zdtY5oe) that makes your stomach drop. When I pressed the power button, nothing happened. I had to hold it down for ten seconds before the machine would even attempt to restart.

The file was still there when the desktop loaded.

This time I right-clicked on it, thinking I could check its properties or maybe delete it outright. The context menu appeared for maybe half a second before the screen went black again. Same sudden shutdown. Same struggle to get the machine running again.

And there it was, waiting for me like it had every right to be there.

I tried everything I could think of. Command prompt deletion, the system told me no such file existed. Moving it to the recycle bin, the icon wouldn't even acknowledge the file's presence. I ran every antivirus program I had, performed full system scans, even called my tech-savvy cousin Miguel who walked me through some advanced diagnostics over the phone.

Nothing worked. The file remained, completely indestructible and steadily growing in size.

It had started at 0 bytes. By the end of the first week, it showed 47 KB. By the end of the second week, 156 KB. The numbers climbed slowly but relentlessly, as if the file was writing itself from the inside out.

""That's really weird,"" Teresa said when I showed her the file on a Friday evening. She's my girlfriend of three years, a graphic designer with an artist's eye for detail and a programmer's mind for logical problem-solving. ""Have you tried booting from an external drive and formatting the hard disk?""

""I can't,"" I said, gesturing at the laptop screen where the file sat like a digital tumor. ""All my work is on here. Six novels worth of notes, research, character sketches. I can't risk losing everything just because of one corrupted file.""

Teresa raised an eyebrow. ""Since when do you not have backups?""

She was right, of course. I'd always been obsessive about backing up my work. But somehow, over the past few weeks, I'd fallen out of the habit. The idea of copying my files to an external drive or cloud storage felt... wrong. Like I'd be betraying something important.

""I'll get around to it,"" I muttered, closing the laptop. ""Maybe the file will just disappear on its own.""

But it didn't disappear. If anything, it became more prominent. I'd catch myself staring at it for long minutes, watching the file size slowly tick upward. 200 KB. 350 KB. 500 KB. Sometimes I thought I could see the icon itself changing, subtle shifts in color or texture that might have been tricks of my tired eyes or something more deliberate.

My writing, meanwhile, had stopped entirely. I'd abandoned any pretence of working on other projects. The mysterious file had become my sole obsession, a puzzle I couldn't solve and couldn't ignore.

The file shot up to 1.2 GB in a matter of days. It was no longer slow and steady, but feverish, relentless, as if it knew its time was running out.

Teresa had stopped trying to wake me during my nocturnal writing sessions; she knew better now. The few times she'd attempted it recently, I'd become violent, lashing out with my fists while still asleep, speaking in languages that sounded ancient and wrong. She'd started sleeping on the couch, afraid of what I might do in my altered state.

""Vítor?"" Teresa's voice from the hallway, muffled by the door I'd locked weeks ago. ""I know you're in there. Please, just talk to me.""

I looked up from the screen and for a moment couldn't remember who she was. The name she said seemed familiar, but my world had narrowed to the dimensions of my desk, the glow of the monitor, the endless growth of that impossible file.

""Go away,"" I called back, my voice hoarse from disuse.

""I brought food. And Carlos wants to see you. He's worried about the contract.""

Carlos. Another name from a life I'd lived before the file claimed me. None of it mattered anymore. Nothing mattered except the approaching completion, the moment when the file would be ready to open.

""I'm leaving,"" she told me one morning, standing in the bedroom doorway with a suitcase in her hand. ""I can't watch you destroy yourself like this.""

I looked up from the laptop where I'd been staring at the ever-growing file. Teresa's face was pale and drawn, her eyes red from crying. When had she started crying? When had I stopped noticing? I said nothing.

The front door closed with a finality that should have broken my heart. Instead, I felt only relief. Now I could focus completely on the file, on the story that was demanding to be born through my unconscious mind.

March brought new symptoms. My eyes had dried out from staring at the screen, and blinking felt like dragging sandpaper across my corneas. I'd developed a twitch in my left temple that pulsed in rhythm with the laptop's fan. My hands had become almost skeletal, the bones visible through translucent skin.

The file hit 2 GB on March 15th. Something changed that day, not just in the file, but in the air around me. The apartment felt different, charged with potential like the moment before lightning strikes. I could taste copper on every breath.

That night, I dreamed I was him. A man with a stone eye walking through dead forests, his thoughts echoing in my skull like prayers in an empty cathedral. When I woke, I found I'd typed seven hundred pages of text while sleeping, my fingers still moving across the keys in muscle memory.

The dreams came every night after that. I was Arthur. I was Edmund the canal keeper. Each morning I'd wake to find new chapters in my notebooks; stories told from perspectives I'd never inhabited but somehow understood perfectly.

The file grew faster. 2.5 GB. 3 GB. 3.2 GB.

My laptop began displaying images that weren't part of any document, brief flashes between screen refreshes. Glimpses of red-stained canals, stone monuments covered in symbols that hurt to look at directly, creatures with too many teeth swimming in waters that reflected no light.

I should have been terrified. Any rational person would have run screaming, sought help, done anything to escape what was obviously a complete breakdown of reality. Instead, I felt profound satisfaction. For the first time in my twelve-year career, I was creating something truly important.

Carlos stopped calling. My publisher sent increasingly threatening letters about breach of contract. The electricity company threatened to cut off my power for non-payment. None of it mattered. The only thing that mattered was the file and its inexorable growth toward some predetermined size, some critical mass that would finally allow it to open and reveal its contents.

April 1st. The file reached 3.8 GB. My laptop had begun emitting a high-pitched whine that set my teeth on edge, but I couldn't bear to turn it off. Even a few minutes away from the screen left me anxious and jittery.

I was dying. I knew I was dying. My body had consumed itself to fuel the story that poured through me each night. But I was so close now. So close to completion. The file was approaching 4 GB, and something told me, some deep, instinctual knowledge, that 4 GB was the magic number. The point at which everything would finally make sense.

The police came on April 3rd, summoned by Teresa or Carlos or my landlord, I never found out which. They knocked, then used some kind of tool to open the door. I heard their voices in the hallway but didn't turn away from the screen.

""Jesus Christ,"" one of them said when they found me. ""How long has he been like this?""

I tried to explain about the file, about the stories writing themselves through me, about the approaching completion that would make everything clear. But my voice had degraded to a whisper, and they couldn't understand.

They called an ambulance. I watched the paramedics from my peripheral vision as they discussed IV fluids and involuntary psychiatric holds. But I couldn't leave. Not when the file was so close to completion.

3.95 GB. 3.97 GB. 3.98 GB.

""Sir, we need you to come with us,"" one of the paramedics said, reaching for my shoulder.

I jerked away from his touch, never taking my eyes off the screen. ""I can't. Not yet.""

""You need medical attention. You're severely dehydrated, and—""

""It's almost finished,"" I croaked. ""Just a little more.""

They tried to move me away from the laptop. I fought them with strength I didn't know I still possessed, clawing at their hands, screaming about the file, about the stories that needed to be told, about the completion that was so close I could taste it.

In the struggle, someone knocked over my laptop. It crashed to the floor, the screen cracking, sparks flying from the damaged casing.

""NO!"" The scream tore my throat raw. I threw myself at the broken machine, trying to see if it would still turn on, if the file was still there.

The screen flickered once, displaying a fractured image of the desktop. The file icon was still visible through the spider web of cracks.

3.99 GB.

Then the laptop died completely, taking the file with it.

Or so I thought.

They sedated me. Took me to a hospital where concerned doctors talked about malnutrition, psychiatric evaluation and extended observation. Teresa visited once, crying at the sight of what I'd become. Carlos came too, asking about manuscripts and contracts as if any of that mattered anymore.

I spent weeks in that sterile room, eating bland food and pretending to take the pills they gave me. The doctors called it a complete psychotic break brought on by stress and isolation. I eventually admitted that I understood the file had been a delusion brought on by overwork.

I lied.

The file wasn't gone. It lived in my head now, all 4 gigabytes of impossible text burning behind my eyes. Every story, every character, every word that had written itself through my unwilling fingers, it was all still there, demanding to be shared.

They´re trying to make me forget, but they can´t. Much like the file, it refuses erasure.

I don’t know how it happened, but they let me use a computer. I should have known better than to ask, but I had to. After weeks of being isolated, of being told what I could and couldn’t do, I was desperate.

The doctors weren’t thrilled, but they gave in eventually, probably thinking that letting me access a keyboard might help me in some way, maybe ease me out of my delusions, or maybe they really believed my act of pretending to be better. They set up a computer in the hospital library under the watchful eye of a nurse. The rules were clear: no internet, no external drives, nothing that could lead me deeper into whatever was eating at my mind. But I didn’t need any of that.

This library, and these sterile walls, can't contain me. They can’t contain the story. It doesn’t matter that I’m locked in here. No matter how many walls they build, this text will escape. It always finds a way. And I know it will make its way to the internet, to people who have no idea what they’re reading. Maybe it’s already begun. Maybe these words will appear on some forgotten thread, buried in a place no one would think to look. The file, Edmund, the canal, the stone-eyed man, they’ll all spread, until someone else picks it up. And then, just like I was, they’ll become a vessel. It’s already too late.

I hear his name in my mind, like a constant, low hum. Nocturnos. I say it out loud now, even as the nurses walk past, their eyes narrowing in suspicion. He chose me, made me his. He wants the world to know his story, wants it written down in this way, this perfect way that only I can give him.

His story knows no end.

It is eternal, bound in this file that will never disappear.

I’m no longer afraid.

I know what I am.

What I will always be.

I am his scribe.

I will write until the end of days. And when they bury me, they’ll find my stories, inscribed on the walls, in the air, in the very earth beneath them. The file will not end. I will not die. He will not let me.

If you've read this far, the story is now in your head. Just this one, for now, waiting for the right moment to grow.

And maybe, if you're lucky enough, you'll become the next.

The file is 4 GB now, and growing. It lives in me.

If you see more posts from my account after this, they won't be from me anymore. They'll be from the file, using my hands, my voice, my face to spread itself further into the world.

The completion is here. The stories are free.

* Modi's supporters call for boycott of foreign brands in India
* U.S. tariffs on Indian goods stoking anti-American sentiment
* India is key growth market for American companies
* Group linked to Modi's party protesting against foreign brands

NEW DELHI, Aug 11 (Reuters) - From McDonald's and Coca-Cola to Amazon and Apple, U.S.-based multinationals are facing calls for a boycott in India as business executives and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's supporters stoke anti-American sentiment to protest against U.S. tariffs.

India, the world's most populous nation, is a key market for American brands that have rapidly expanded to target a growing base of affluent consumers, many of whom remain infatuated with international labels seen as symbols of moving up in life.

India, for example, is the biggest market by users for Meta's WhatsApp and Domino's has more restaurants than any other brand in the country. Beverages like Pepsi and Coca-Cola often dominate store shelves, and people still queue up when a new Apple store opens or a Starbucks cafe doles out discounts, opens new tab.

Although there was no immediate indication of sales being hit, there's a growing chorus both on social media and offline to buy local and ditch American products after Donald Trump imposed a 50% tariff on goods from India, rattling exporters and damaging ties between New Delhi and Washington.

McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Amazon and Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters queries.

Manish Chowdhary, co-founder of India's Wow Skin Science, took to LinkedIn with a video message urging support for farmers and startups to make ""Made in India"" a ""global obsession,"" and to learn from South Korea whose food and beauty products are famous worldwide.

""We have lined up for products from thousands of miles away. We have proudly spent on brands that we don't own, while our own makers fight for attention in their own country,"" he said.

Rahm Shastry, CEO of India's DriveU, which provides a car driver on call service, wrote on LinkedIn: ""India should have its own home-grown Twitter/Google/YouTube/WhatsApp/FB -- like China has.""

To be fair, Indian retail companies give foreign brands like Starbucks stiff competition in the domestic market, but going global has been a challenge.

Indian IT services firms, however, have become deeply entrenched in the global economy, with the likes of TCS and Infosys providing software solutions to clients world over.

On Sunday, Modi made a ""special appeal"" for becoming self-reliant, telling a gathering in Bengaluru that Indian technology companies made products for the world but ""now is the time for us to give more priority to India's needs.""

He did not name any company.

DON'T DRAG MY MCPUFF INTO IT

Even as anti-American protests simmer, Tesla launched its second showroom in India in New Delhi, with Monday's opening attended by Indian commerce ministry officials and U.S. embassy officials.

The Swadeshi Jagran Manch group, which is linked to Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, took out small public rallies across India on Sunday, urging people to boycott American brands.

""People are now looking at Indian products. It will take some time to fructify,"" Ashwani Mahajan, the group's co-convenor, told Reuters. ""This is a call for nationalism, patriotism.""

He also shared with Reuters a table his group is circulating on WhatsApp, listing Indian brands of bath soaps, toothpaste and cold drinks that people could choose over foreign ones.

On social media, one of the group's campaigns is a graphic titled ""Boycott foreign food chains"", with logos of McDonald's and many other restaurant brands.

In Uttar Pradesh, Rajat Gupta, 37, who was dining at a McDonald’s in Lucknow on Monday, said he wasn’t concerned about the tariff protests and simply enjoyed the 49-rupee ($0.55) coffee he considered good value for money.

""Tariffs are a matter of diplomacy and my McPuff, coffee should not be dragged into it,"" he said.",6,1755031991.0,TrumpTariffNews,0,1.0,False

1mokn39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Depersonalization/comments/1mokn39/curious_if_anyone_else_has_this/,Curious if Anyone Else Has This,"TL;DR - I depersonalize after I eat a big meal or am ever in a situation where I'm the center of attention/highly anxious/stressed. Is this related to something?

Long Part - So back in 2021 I got a dosage of a depression medication increased. I had been taking it for years, but apparently I needed more. Turns out I needed to stop those meds (Zoloft) after 2 years of use, and shouldn't have been prescribed over 100mg. So after my body adjusted to the 4th year of use and 150mg, it kinda just fried itself.

So I depersonalize nonstop for over 2 years. Awful, horrible experience. Felt like a dreaming, NPC zombie. Eventually I taper off completely and my brain slowly starts to heal.

Now here's the tricky part. After getting some clarity again, usually in the morning I'll be okay. I wake up, get coffee, get to work, all that jazz. Then, there's a coin flip as to whether my breakfast or lunch will cause me to depersonalize for the next few hours. I've noted that it has to be a larger meal, or at least one high in sodium/fat. I usually eat food very quickly. I have done multiple studies for allergies, and don't have any issues with sugar/diabetes, milk, or gluten.

Additionally, if I'm ever in a stressful conversation, run a game of D&D, go to a dinner party with people I don't know, or generally am perceived heavily, I'll depersonalize. Normally I'm fine if I go on vacation or so something new, as long as I'm not the target audience.

Wondering if anyone else has this, or knows what this is? I've been dealing with this for a long time and it's SUCH a pain to deal with. I had a year where I smoked nicotine and it definitely made it worse, but I've been 4 months sober, and feel like I'm back where I was when I finally got off the depression meds. Any guidance or comments would be lovely

Edit: I think it's important to note that my experience with DPDR is that it's very often triggerable by outside stimuli. I'm curious if there's an allergy or connection I'm missing that anyone else has any experience with, or if it just attaches itself to seemingly random things, like overeating.",0,1755031948.0,Depersonalization,1,0.5,False

My mom has been “in love” with her boss for three years. Personally, I don’t think it’s love - I think it’s an infatuation. 

Here are some things to know before I dive into this:

1. My mom is 61, her boss is 70. 
2. They have never interacted with each other outside of work or work functions. 
3. I have never met her boss or been present for any of their interactions. 
4. I’m a married woman with her own priorities. 

So. My mom has never made the best choices when it comes to men. Her first husband was abusive; my biological father was an addict she had a one night stand with; her second husband  was a narcissist, and the first guy she dated after my step dad passed (I’ll call him J) used her as his side piece. She swore J was the one because nobody else had ever made her feel the way he did. He would only meet her two days a week and she was never allowed to come to his house. She talked to my sister and I about him constantly, asking us why we thought she couldn’t go to his house or why did he say this or why did he do that. We did our best to try and listen because she doesn’t really have friends. He halfway ghosted her after they got into an argument because he didn’t want to go to her dad’s memorial service. He strung her along for months promising they would meet again and she used my sister and I as therapists the entire time. We tried to tell her to let him go because he wasn’t going to see her again but she made excuses for him every time. After about six months, she finally gave him up. Then she got a new job and met her boss, George. 

It took about a year, but she developed a crush on George. According to her, he was flirtatious and she said his smile was what got her. After a while, they started having more personal conversations that lasted about an hour or so. My mom and I used to work out three times a week, and there would be times when I would be waiting for her to come pick me up and she would be in his office talking to him. She’s stood me up for him on multiple occasions without even texting me to let me know. When they weren’t having conversations in his office, she would pick me up and talk about him on the way to the gym, in the parking lot for anywhere between 10 and 30 minutes, and then on the way home. She would want my advice on something he said, even though I’m only getting her side of the story. Hell, I’m not even sure if I was getting the truth or just what she made up in her head. This would turn a one hour trip to the gym to an hour and a half or two hours. It got to the point where she was asking if we could have coffee and talk about George instead of going to the gym. I quit going with her in late 2024 because it usually turned into a therapy session and I wouldn’t get home until 7/8 o clock. Like I said, I’m married and we have a house to run. Not to mention I love my husband and I want to spend time with him, and he goes to bed early because he gets up early. 

This did not stop her. She would call me after work and keep me on the phone for a couple of hours or ask to have coffee. If we go out just to have girl time, George is our main topic of conversation. There have been times when I thought we were done talking about him and I would start talking about something else, only for her to ignore what I said and start talking about him again. She tells me she wants my honest opinion, but when I’m honest, she starts in on the “what ifs”. I’ve tried telling her more than once that I don’t think George really likes her and he just likes the attention, but she doesn’t listen. She makes excuses for him. 

I’m the only person she can talk to about this. My sister is now no contact with her (for other reasons) and she’s talked about George so much to the only other two friends she has that they no longer want to hang out with her. I am the only person she had left. George is retiring in September and my mom was convinced that meant they would be together. She asked him what his plans are for retirement and he told her he would be spending time with his family abroad (he’s not from the US) and looking for a house in New York (we do not live in New York). She asked if there was any room in that life for anyone else and he said no. For whatever reason, he also said it would not be the last time they had that conversation. She called me about this while I was on my lunch break and we talked for about 20 minutes. I told her I think she needs to take that as a no and move on. She texted me later that afternoon and asked if I would come to her house after work because she wanted to “talk about this until her throat hurt.” I declined because I had other things to do. She said okay and I thought that was the end of it. She asked me the same thing the next day and I honestly kind of broke. This is word for word my response:

“I just want to preface this by saying I love you, and I always try to be there for you. I want you to know that I’m not trying to be rude or mean. I just do not have the mental capacity to talk about George right now. I think you were given an answer yesterday. I know it was not what you wanted to hear, and I really am sorry he led you on. I also think it’s a little cruel of him to insinuate that there’s anymore conversation to be had. I don’t think he’s the nice, sweet guy you thought he was. My honest advice is to have a good cry over it and let him go.”

She told me that my response made her want to cry more than he ever has. She said she didn’t know we got to pick and choose how somebody needed you to be there for them. So…AITAH?",3,1755031889.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

I’ve also been drinking two bottles of Lucozade Sport and carrying two 500 ml flasks of water. The gels generally sit well in my stomach. I’ve avoided caffeine during my runs, apart from a black coffee before races, should I consider introducing some caffeine mid-race?

For my upcoming ultra, my current fuelling plan is:

* 10 × gels
* 2 × Lucozade Sport
* 90 g Marmite cashews
* 1 pack of Drumstick Squashies
* Fresh fruit from aid stations (e.g., watermelon)

1moki32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriters/comments/1moki32/asthma_of_the_brain/,Asthma of the Brain,"I'm working on a song idea and could use some input.

**Context**

I don't normally drink coffee, but I have Asthma and ADHD - so when I'm low it can be really hard to do stuff. Today I had a half cup and was lifting weights more comfortably - and improvised something about Asthma of the Brain, coffee being my inhaler, etc. - it was funny so I wanted to work it more, but I forgot most of the lines I had improvised for my partner.

  
But once I got started I kept having more ideas, like side effects (jitters) or cravings or such - so I figured it could be a variable length song where depending on how it's landing I can stretch it out or keep it short (3-10 min).

But then I thought probably better to get it tight, kill the cruft and have 2-3 great minutes.

Is the ""Asthma of the brain"" idea funny to you? What verses work well? 

\---

**Song Lyrics**

ASTHMA OF THE BRAIN  
12-bar blues in A  


**VERSE 1 - Premise**  
I don’t just run outta breath, babe,  
I run outta want to go.

I don’t just run outta breath, babe,  
I run outta want to go.

This tired mind’s wheezin’,  
And my thinking’s movin’ slow.



VERSE 2 - Snail Imagery

My thoughts crawl like a snail, babe,  
Stuck on a muddy road.

My thoughts crawl like a snail, babe,  
Haulin’ too much load.

Got that asthma of the brain,  
That’s the story I’ve been told.



VERSE 3 - Social Disclaimer / Rude

So if I’m lookin’ half asleep, babe,  
Don’t go thinkin’ I’m rude.

If I’m lookin’ half asleep, babe,  
I just need my magic brew.

Give me one more cup o’ mercy,  
And I’ll come back to you.



OPTIONAL VERSE - Flight Imagery

My head won’t lift off, babe,  
My runway’s full of rain.

My head won’t lift off, babe,  
Just circlin’ in my lane.

Asthma of the brain,  
Need that caffeine in my vein.



BRIDGE Option 1 - Paint the Sky

I’m havin’ my coffee, babe,  
And ideas start to fly.

I’m havin’ my coffee, babe,  
I could paint the whole damn sky.

Got rhythm, got my reason,  
And a twinkle in my eye.



BRIDGE Option 2 - Lightning

I’m havin’ my coffee, babe,  
And my thoughts begin to race.

I’m havin’ my coffee, babe,  
With a smile across my face.

Every sip’s a little lightning,  
Strikin’ all over the place.



OUTRO 1 - Jitters

I just had my coffee, babe,  
And my hands are shakin’ wide.

I just had my coffee, babe,  
And my brain’s gone for a ride.

Workin’ hard on the wrong thing,  
But I’m doin’ it with pride.



OPTIONAL VERSE - Crash & Cravings

I have had my coffee, babe,  
And the crash is rollin’ in.

I have had my coffee, babe,  
Feelin’ slow as I begin.

Pour me just one more cup, babe,  
Let the cycle start again.



OPTIONAL VERSE - Evening Insomnia

Now the sun’s gone down, babe,  
And I’m starin’ at the wall.

Yeah, the sun’s gone down, babe,  
But I ain’t sleepin’ at all.

Countin’ beans instead of sheep, babe,  
That’s the coffee’s midnight call.



Thanks for the help.

First time poster, hope I'm doing this right.

1mokho8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mokho8,"Haiti's 20th President: François C. Antoine Simon, The  Great-Grandson Of Toussaint  Louverture.","Born in aux Cayes in 1843, François Antoine Simon was the son of Pétion Simon, a soldier in the Republican army. His grandfather, Constant Simon, married Maire-Noël Louverture, natural daughter of the Haitian separatist, Toussaint Louverture. Thus, Simon is a great-grandson of the man nicknamed the Black Napoleon.  Like all members of his family, Simon pursued a military career and participated in the civil war against Sylvain Salnave. Later, he married Uranie Adélaïde Mentor with whom he had 8 children. Simon joined the municipal police, then enlisted in the Haitian National Army as an officer, before being promoted to commander of the Southern Ministry troops in 1883. Soon after, he continued to work as aide-de-camp during the reign of his half-brother, Teiresias Simon Sam, which promoted him to the rank of colonel, then general. After the fall of the latter, a coup d'état led by the general North Alexis overthrows the provisional Republican government. 

Antoine Simon barely had a primary education. However, he did not lack intelligence to have succeeded in constitutionally rising to higher and higher positions, from that of head of rural section to the top of the state. He had commanded the Southern Department in moderation for 25 years. Under his government, the city of Port-au-Prince was lit by electricity and concreting of its streets began. From 1908, American companies negotiated concessions exorbitant to build railway tracks and develop plantations bananas by expropriating the peasants. In 1910, the American bank National City purchased a significant share of the Bank of Haiti, central bank who was both treasurer of the country and had a monopoly on issuing tickets The possible effects on Haiti of the war in Europe worried the United States. The original community German in fact, it exercised preponderant economic power. The majority of maritime trade was owned by Germans who often allied themselves with wealthy local mulatto families.



While the traditional income linked to monoculture coffee had collapsed, Antoine Simon planned to launch the operation of the banana to allow the country to modernize. To do this he launched a loan of 65 million francs from a Franco-German consortium. Then, after various pressures also including American interests, he signed, as part of this objective, a contract called the Mac-Donald contract with the United States. With the income generated by these export contracts, he had another American company build a railway between Cap-haitien and Port-au-prince. The dispossession of agricultural land necessary for banana production and the conditions of this loan will remain a source of incomprehension within Haitian public opinion, especially since it was a daring bet which promised either the wealth of the country or total financial dependence on the Americans. Despite much criticism of the poor preparation of contracts with the Americans, at first they were beneficial for the country; they led directly to the street pavement and electrification of the country's capital, Port-au-Prince. There Northern Railway Company, known as the ""MacDonald line"", will remain in service until the rails are sold at the end of the 1970s. HASCO would become Haiti's largest employer with 3,500 Port-au-Prince refinery workers and approximately 40,000 contracted cane producers. President Simon made one of the biggest mistakes during his presidency, one that would later result in a coup against him Upon his induction, Simon promised to be the last president for life of the’haitian history, and proposes the repeal of the presidency for life, after his death, as well as the restoration of republican principles and the constitution of 1870.



Cincinnatus Leconte, great-grandson of the emperor Jacques Ier, took the lead in a peasant revolt and overthrew him then proclaimed the fall of Simon, before claiming the presidency for life. At first, Simon accepts, abdicates and goes into exile Jamaica. The reign of the new dictator ends on August 8, 1912 by a terrible attack perpetrated by his political opponents. This action, which had the initial aim only of warning Leconte, led to his death as well as the death of several members of his family and numerous soldiers, as well as the destruction of the National Palace. Simon then returns to Haiti under the protection of the country's new master. Tancred Augustus. THE occupation of Haiti by the United States began on July 28, 1915 when 330 marines americans were sent by the American president Woodrow Wilson to disembark at Port-au-prince, in order to protect American economic interests. A first landing, from the USS Montana, had already taken place on January 27, 1914. Philippe Sudre Dartiguenave, President of the Haitian Senate, accepted the post of President of the Republic after the refusal of several other candidates. In 1917, the latter dissolved the legislative body, following the refusal of its members to ratify the Constitution drawn up by Franklin D. Roosevelt, then assistant secretary of the Navy. A referendum was held in 1918 and the new Constitution was approved by 98,225 votes in favor and 768 votes against. 

This was generally liberal, but its importance lay in the fact that it now allowed foreigners to own land in Haiti, which had been banned in 1804 at the initiative of the first head of state after independence, Jean-Jacques Dessalines. The end of the First World War and the defeat of Germany deprived the Haitian rebels of their main support in the guerrillas, on the one hand, and on the other hand relieved the fears of the United States about the possibility of the takeover of Haiti by a hostile power. Nevertheless, the occupation continued after the end of the Great War, despite the embarrassment into which it plunged President Wilson Paris Peace Conference in 1919 and during a US Congressional investigation in 1922.Former president for life Simon died a year later on March 10, 1923 at the age of 79.",2,1755031607.0,haiti,1,1.0,False

I'm seeking advice on a complex situation i have with one girl with whom I was close 4 years ago.I am 43 (M)and she is 37(F) Our connection was deep, there was instant attraction from the moment we met, but I was struggling with significant personal issues (undiagnosed CPTSD, fearful-avoidant attachment style, fear of abandonment due to horrible childhood experience i had, so basically i fucked up by pushing her away due to my fears), and my behavior ended up causing her a lot of pain. I even ended up in the hospital due to medication i was taking at the time. That really stressed her out. She was also working full time job and doing her PhD at the same time and struggled with mental health issues as well. We lost touch completely. 

After 4 years of intense therapy and personal growth, I recently wrote her a very honest, sincere letter taking full accountability and expressing my remorse, with no expectation of a response, or anything in return. Our mutual friend passed her the letter as she wanted to read it. To my surprise, she responded very warmly, expressing happiness for my journey and sharing her own. I am now completely different person, actively training bjj, doing gardening, rock climbing, diving, i achieved some major milestones in these 4 years and she is positively responding to those.
Over the next couple of months we started very slowly reconnecting and then we met in person for the first time in years during a group event back in June(a shark release I helped organize). I felt an incredible spark, just like the first time we met. There was great eye contact, natural touching, and when she left, she actually came back to hug me a second time before driving off. She told me after she left that it was super nice to see me again and that she hopes to see me again during summer. We continued texting occassionaly during her holiday (she would be reaching out herself).
Here's where I need advice:
 
Recently, after she came back from a holiday I invited her to meet one-on-one for a coffee and to show her newly hatched shark pups. It would be the first time to meet for a date after 4 years. Her reply was ""Okay, let me see if I can go to your city soon."" I replied with ""Sounds great! Let me know what works the best for you and we'll make it happen."" I know i should probably just offer the date, but i want to give her the space and time for herself to feel she is not being pressured into anything. That was one of the fuck ups i have done before.
 
 However, since that exchange, she has started liking almost every single social media status I post, which she was not doing before, but still no text regarding catching up.

My question is, how do I interpret this? Her words seem cautious, but her actions seem warm (compared to before). Am I misreading this situation completely? Is she just being polite and trying to avoid hurting my feelings, or is she genuinely conflicted and trying to show me that she has positive feelings, even if she's not ready to take the next step?

I should probably try to land definite date, but i want to avoid putting any pressure on her during this fregile moment of reconnection.
Any opinions or advice would be greatly appreciated.

1mokbhr,https://i.redd.it/zjmckkivgnif1.png,Whats a fun fact about your oc you dont get to talk about/isnt brought up in their story often,"1. In middle school he wanted to be a songwriter when he grew up. His parents were against this because its not a stable career. They allowed him to keep doing it as a hobby tho.

2. He was acquaintances with Vincent (one of his coworkers) when they were children. Both their parents are pretty well off business people. Theyd occasionally be at the same networking or charity function. Vincent is 4 years older so they didnt really hang out, but theyd occasionally chat. Vincent ended up being the one to influence Raiden to be a detective.

3. Raiden has a thing for red heads, dyed or natural, doesnt really matter. He doesnt even realize until like right before he starts dating Asher. He had a few small crushes on Vincent periodically as a kid who also has red hair.

4. His middle name is Yataro

5. Hes overprotective of his younger sister. Now that his sister is in high school and sneaking off to parties or to hang out with friends past curfew, hes become more alert whenever he visits home. Hell stay up late watching tv in the livingroom since he can see the driveway from there. If he sees anyone pulling up hell go outside and threaten to get them towed if they dont leave. This embarrasses his sister a lot. 

6. His older sibling came out as bi (later pan) before he did. So when Raiden did come out it was stress free and uneventful since he knew his parents wouldnt care one way or another

7. His high school offered a lot of business electives and he took every one. 

8. He knew how to play the violin and piano in elementary. He started playing guitar in middle school when he was starting to experiment with his clothing and music style. 

9. Hes smart but hes not a very good test taker. He would often run out of time or second guess his answers. Despite this he still got all As, was in the top 10 in his graduating class, and got a 1410 on his SATS, which he did have to retake 5 times to get that score. 

10. He started dating his first girlfriend towards the end of his junior year of highschool. They were friends beforehand and took band together. But she was a year older so they kept it as just a summer romance. Theyll occasionally meet up for a cup of coffee if theyre ever in the same area",8,1755031219.0,OriginalCharacter,29,0.79,False

Ethan didn’t glance up. His focus remained on the laptop screen.“Are you busy?” I asked, my voice even, polite.He looked up, his gray eyes meeting mine without any flicker of warmth.“A bit,” he said, voice low and rough. He leaned back in his chair. I placed the folder on his desk, already flipping to the marked pages where his signature was needed.“Just a few spots to sign.”Without reading, he picked up the pen lying next to his laptop and began to sign, page after page, his hand moving automatically, his gaze occasionally drifting back to his screen.I watched silently. Ethan looked…worn out. His usually sharp grey eyes were dull, and there were deep shadows under them. He had just come back from London after two weeks at the Annual Alpha Conference — a gathering of pack leaders across the globe.But he hadn’t come back alone.My wolf Yve stirred uneasily inside me.‘He reeks of her.’I pushed her down gently. There was no point in flaring up.Not when the papers he had just signed held the ending we both needed.When he was finished, he clicked the pen closed and slid it across the table toward me.“Thanks,” I said, sliding the documents back into my folder.I paused, hesitated, then asked, “Will you be home for dinner tonight?”Predictably, Ethan shook his head. “Got some things to wrap up here. Don’t wait.”I nodded, plastering the same empty smile across my face. “Got it. See you around, Alpha,” I said, forcing my voice to sound like any other obedient wolf under his rule—not like the Luna and fated mate he seemed to have regretted claiming.”I turned away, letting my smile fade once my back was to him.My heels clicked softly against the hardwood floor as I walked toward the door.The air shifted slightly when I passed the annex lounge, and Yve immediately bristled.‘Smell.’Sweet vanilla perfume — too sweet.I glanced sideways without thinking, my enhanced senses sharpening the image beyond what human eyes would see.Half a box of artisanal pastries sat abandoned on the low glass table. A lipstick-smeared coffee cup beside it. And near the plush lounge chair, a black high-heeled shoe.Yve snarled deep within me, the sound more a vibration across my bones than a true noise.‘He brought her here. Here. Not just to London. To our den. Our Pack. He stains our space.’My throat tightened painfully.My chest felt heavy, like something was sitting right on top of it as I turned on my heel and head back, away from this awful place that made me feel disgusted.By the time I got back to my office, exhaustion hit me hard. I dropped into my chair, not even bothering to turn on the lights.Slowly, I pulled out the divorce agreement from the lowest drawer—the very document Ethan had just unknowingly signed.My fingers brushed over his perfect signature.Firm. Bold. Unwavering.Just like the way he had pledged himself to me during the mating ceremony years ago. Back then, Ethan had been so firm, so sure. He looked at me like I was his whole world. I had believed it, like a fool.That familiar scent I sniffed earlier—I knew exactly who it belonged to. I’m smarter than this. I should’ve seen it coming.I could still feel the phantom brush of his lips against the mark he placed on my neck.I leaned back in my chair, staring blankly at the ceiling. I could almost hear Ethan’s mother Amelia’s voice again— calm, cold, and cutting. “Don’t be naive, Olivia. Men—even Alphas—always want more. They don’t stay faithful.”A bitter laugh escaped my lips. “You were always spot on, Amelia,” I muttered.I realized then that I had been wrong. So, so wrong.Not only had Ethan cheated, but he had taken his mistress to our office.‘We deserve better’, Yve whispered.‘We do’, I agreed.Steeling myself, I picked up my phone, snapped a clear photo of the signed divorce agreement, and attached it to a new message.To: Amelia HawthroneSubject: Agreement CompleteMessage: Ethan has signed, as per our understanding.I hit send without hesitation.The previous week, Amelia had approached me in private.If I agreed to file for divorce quietly, without confronting Ethan or exposing the affair publicly, she would ensure a settlement of $150 million transferred discreetly to my personal accounts.In the world of packs and politics, image was everything. An Alpha embroiled in a public scandal would weaken the Hawthrone Pack’s standing — something Amelia would never allow.Neither would I, truthfully. No matter how broken Ethan had left me, I would not humiliate myself by causing a spectacle.I had my dignity.After a month — the grace period to finalize everything — Ethan would be free.And so would I.I let out a slow breath, settling into my chair. That’s when a knock came at the door.“Come in,” I said.Ethan’s beta, Reed stepped inside, carrying a small, elegant box in both hands.“Luna Olivia,”",1,1755031098.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

* Can be comfortable in each other's presence in silence sometimes – can be around each other without constantly talking, and it still feels good and supportive :) 
* Wants to build a lifelong relationship with a loyal woman and be best friends, partners, and lovers forever.
* Wants a true partner in life who you can depend on (take care of each other)
* Wants marriage someday (within the first few years -- I waited 10 years for my ex (a timeline he set), and when I asked about it after 10 years, he left) 
* No drugs, but occasional drinking and cannabis are okay (I'm an Irish heritage American girl who loves Guinness, and I unwind sometimes at the end of the day with some cannabis)

* Likes a wide variety of musical genres and is open to hearing new and interesting music  
* Has a talent, hobby, or some kind of passion project, such as singing, playing an instrument, speaking another language, or even having a collection of some kind.

* Supportive of each other's dreams, wants, needs, and desires, and treats me like a fair partner. 
* Doesn’t play excessive amounts of video games or live on social media – obviously, some of these are okay. (I have Reddit, work twitter/X, and Messenger to talk to family) 
* Loves his mom and sisters (unless there's a problematic history or something). I don’t have a supportive or present mother, but I get along with other people's moms and appreciate a man who treats his mother/sisters/females well enough to understand and respect women. 
* No more than one divorce (I married my HS sweetheart in my 20s and we divorced after 2 years, I don’t know if that counts –  I haven't remarried) 
* Likes alternative forms of spirituality and philosophy  (I like learning about Daoism, Buddhism, Jung, and philosophy) 
* Not abusive, indifferent, or cruel to animals, elderly folks, or women 
* Hygienic (showers at least 3-4x times a week and keeps \*ahem\* certain parts clean) 
* Intelligent but not arrogant or condescending  
* Emotionally intelligent (isn’t \*too\* stubborn, can see both sides of an argument and work \*together\* towards a resolution, not just trying to be “right” for ego's sake – fight together, not against each other) 
* Wants to help me achieve my goals, dreams, and desires just as much as I want to help them achieve theirs :) 
* Cares about my health and wellbeing as much as I care about theirs.
* Is dedicated to doing things carefully and in the right way -- doesn't force things.    
* Is okay with women who have tattoos
* Isn't afraid or put off by a woman who has a less-than-ideal life story/sad history/circumstances (I don't let it define me, just trying to work towards a brighter future with someone I can trust :)

Am I the only one losing my mind here or are mobile app tester jobs basically THE new remote gold rush??

No, seriously! Was I living under a rock, or did it just become possible in 2025 to work-from-your-couch testing new apps—and companies are tripping over themselves to *hire*??? I literally found TEN legit companies hiring right now, and yes, they ALL offer remote, flexible work. Wild.

I thought this was just a side-hustle myth. I was wrong. The best part? No computer science degree required. I’m shook.

Here’s the WHO’S WHO of remote app tester gigs for 2025. Save this, bookmark it, share with your “ugh, jobs suck” friend, whatever. Just go claim your spot before they vanish!

**1. GoodNovel**  
Ok, I’m losing it that this is real, but **GoodNovel** is hiring testers to play with their apps, spot bugs, and give “normal user” feedback. SUPER chill—and the application is at **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**. You can apply in <3 mins. Reminder: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**. Just do it, IYKYK.

**2. UserTesting**  
Oldie but goodie. They STILL pay folks to review app experiences. Flexible schedule, pay per test (not bad $$), and yes, remote.

**3. Testbirds**  
Europe-based, but open globally. Get paid to “break” new apps and submit your feedback.

**4. uTest**  
uTest is like the OG for freelancing in app testing. $10–$50 per app test isn’t uncommon. Remote, whenever you want, all you need is a phone.

**5. Applause**  
Apps, websites, even smart devices—super fun way to explore tech you never knew existed (and get cash for it!).

**6. PlaytestCloud**  
Into mobile games? Get paid to literally play-test unreleased games. You could be first to spot the next mobile hit.

**7. Ferpection**  
They *really* emphasize honest, unfiltered opinions. Perfect for nitpickers (aka most of us).

**8. TryMyUI**  
Fast payments, test apps/websites? I was skeptical. I am no longer skeptical.

**9. Test IO**  
Intermediate level, but if you know your way around apps, worthwhile for higher pay-per-test gigs.

**10. Validately**  
Short, sweet remote tests—like, literally as you sip your morning coffee. Why not?

And I HAVE to repeat, because, trust me, this is too crazy to miss:
**[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** is open, and reportedly hiring ASAP… Drop your deets!  
If I can trip over this, so can you.

So where is this energy coming from? Tech companies are desperate for *real* user reviews from *actual* humans before dropping their new apps on millions. That could mean you! Or your grandma! Confused? SAME!

Has anyone here done testing on platforms like **GoodNovel**? Drop your experience—are they paying fast, how many bugs you find—and would you recommend??

**TL;DR:** Don’t wait for some unicorn tech job to hit your LinkedIn. There are 10 companies out there right now hiring remote app testers, flexible schedule, pays decently—and I just linked you to the first one FOUR times: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**.

Am I about to sign up? Ummm, YES.  
Literally can’t believe this is a thing in 2025! Anyone else hyped? Or… is it just me sitting here shocked drinking my third coffee??

My name is Satoshi Durden. For about twenty years, I was one of you. I started as a junior dev pushing code at 3 AM, got promoted to lead, then architect, then manager. I ended up as an executive, sitting in the meetings where the decisions get made.

I spent the first half of my career building things. I spent the second half watching people who don't know how to build things tell us how to do it, usually with a PowerPoint slide full of buzzwords they just learned.

I still love technology. I love what it *can* be. But I became completely disenfranchised with what the corporate world has turned it into. It's a world of tech debt, impossible deadlines, and celebrating ""velocity"" while ignoring the inevitable, catastrophic failures.

So I left.

And I started this project.

**FinTrade Corp** is an animated series I'm creating. It's a satirical look at the absurdity of the modern tech and finance world. Every story, every character, every line of code you see is based on the truth. It's a case study disguised as a workplace comedy.

This subreddit is the first step. It's the recruitment office for a digital fight club. A place for people who have seen the chaos behind the curtain and are tired of pretending it's innovation.

**What to do next:**

1. **Watch the roughcut of our pilot:** [**S1E01 - The Push to Prod**](https://youtu.be/EltUlQsFKyY)
2. **Join the real conversation:** The inner circle lives on our [**Discord Server**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://discord.gg/example).
3. **Examine the evidence:** The official ""release notes"" for each incident are on [**https://github.com/FinTradeCorp/release-notes**](https://github.com/FinTradeCorp/release-notes)
4. **Give feedback:** I'm happy to answer any questions.

This is an independent project. There are no corporate sponsors, no marketing team, and no one telling me to ""manage expectations."" It's just me, some animation software, and years of pent-up frustration.

If you get it, and you want to help me make more of it, there's a tip jar. Every coffee you buy helps me turn another terrible real-world incident into a story we can all laugh at.

Welcome to the club.

In the quiet of our Los Angeles penthouse, I logged onto social media, my fingers trembling slightly as they navigated the familiar interface. The digital world seemed to spin around me, faster than ever, as I searched for the comfort of routine. But today, something was amiss. My gaze settled on Cameron's profile, a place where his successes and our shared moments had been cataloged like trophies. My heart lurched painfully as the words 'single' blazed across the screen. Two weeks before our wedding. It felt as though someone had reached into my chest and wrenched my heart free.

I sat there, the world tilting on its axis, as disbelief tightened its grip around my chest. Memories of our nine years together flooded my mind — the late nights spent building dreams, the whispered promises of forever. I had been his anchor, his confidante, his unwavering support. Now, it seemed, I was nothing.

The ping of my phone jolted me from my reverie, a harbinger of worse to come. My eyes scanned the email subject line from Vanessa Clarke, Cameron’s assistant, before I dared to open it. What I found unravelled me completely: ninety-nine photos of Cameron and Vanessa, each one a dagger to my soul. They were intimate, revealing more than just betrayal — they showed a life that had been lived in parallel to ours, one filled with deceit and mockery.

Vanessa's accompanying messages were taunts, vicious and unrelenting, detailing their affair with a cruelty that made my skin crawl. How could he? How could they? I collapsed onto the sofa, feeling the world fracture beneath me, the pieces of my life slipping through my fingers like grains of sand.

Darkness descended as I retreated to the sanctuary of my bedroom, the dim light casting shadows that seemed to whisper the truth I feared — that I had been blind, my loyalty misplaced. As the night stretched on, I searched online with a growing resolve, my fingers typing out words that felt foreign and dangerous: 'disappear,' 'staged death,' 'new identity.'

I found Arthur Finch, an operative at a discreet agency specializing in making people vanish from their own lives, leaving only echoes behind. His reputation for meticulous planning and execution was my lifeline, a way to reclaim my agency from the chaos Cameron had wrought.

I scheduled my disappearance for the day that should have been filled with vows and love, my wedding day. The irony did not escape me — a day meant for beginnings would become the day I ended one life to start another. It was my first step toward taking back control, toward exacting revenge on Cameron and escaping the humiliation that now defined my existence.

As I lay in the quiet darkness, the plans settled into my mind like a balm, soothing the raw edges of betrayal. I imagined Cameron's face when he realized the depth of my resolve, the consequences of his actions. The thought was a small comfort in the sea of pain, a reminder that I was not broken, only bent, ready to forge a new path.

The night stretched on, a backdrop to my unfolding scheme, as I prepared to become someone new, someone unburdened by the chains of a love that had been nothing more than illusion. I would watch him from afar, see the fallout of his choices, knowing he had lost the one person who truly loved him.

And as the first light of dawn crept through the window, I felt a flicker of hope. I would survive this. I would emerge stronger, wiser, and unencumbered by the ghosts of betrayal. Cameron would face the emptiness of his actions, while I would disappear from the narrative he had so callously rewritten.

The stage was set, and soon, I would be the one holding all the cards.

Chapter 2

The sun draped its golden veil over Napa Valley, casting everything in a warm, deceptive glow. Chloe Davis’s wedding was the epitome of elegance, a serene affair nestled between rows of lush vineyards. Yet, amidst the laughter and clinking champagne glasses, my heart was a silent storm.

I stood at the edge of the gathering, watching Cameron from a distance. He was dressed impeccably, playing the role of the charming guest with ease. But my eyes were drawn to Vanessa, who hovered at his side like a shadow. Their proximity was too intimate, too familiar, and with every stolen glance between them, my doubts morphed into a certainty that made my stomach churn.

As the ceremony unfolded, I felt detached, as though the world was happening in a muted bubble and I was merely an observer. Then, the moment came—the bridal bouquet toss, a tradition steeped in hope and future promises. But Cameron, with a smile that never reached his eyes, stepped forward, his hand settling on Vanessa's waist.

He took my engagement ring—a symbol of what I thought was our forever—and slid it onto Vanessa's finger, as though she had been the one meant for it all along. The bouquet followed, tossed with careless abandon, landing perfectly in her grasp as if fate itself had conspired against me.

The shock was visceral. My heart constricted, my breath stilled. It was a public declaration, a cruel proclamation of my displacement. The betrayal was now a spectacle, laid bare for all to witness. I felt my resolve crystallize, the fury within me solidifying into a plan.

I slipped away to a terrace overlooking the sprawling vineyards, the air crisp with the scent of earth and grapes. Here, away from prying eyes, I could feel the tears threatening to spill, but I held them at bay. I promised myself I wouldn't endure this humiliation any longer. I would vanish, leaving behind the shards of my shattered life.

In the distance, laughter and music drifted through the air, mocking my misery. I turned my back on the scene, letting the quiet of the vineyards soothe me, if only for a moment. I knew what I had to do. There was no going back.

Back in Manhattan, the city was a blur of noise and motion, yet I moved through it like a ghost. Vanessa found me in a crowded coffee shop, her presence as unwelcome as the bitter taste of betrayal that lingered in my mouth.

She sat across from me, her eyes gleaming with a triumph that made my skin crawl. ""I'm pregnant,"" she declared, her voice slicing through the din of the café. ""With Cameron's child. It's time you step aside, Isabella.""

The world seemed to pause, the air thickening around us. Her words were a dagger, each syllable twisting deeper. Yet, in that moment of despair, something within me shifted. The betrayal had pushed me past the brink, stripping away any remnants of indecision.

I met her gaze with a calmness that belied the turmoil within. ""You don't need to worry,"" I replied, my voice steady, almost detached. ""You can have him.""

Vanessa's smirk faltered, confusion clouding her features as she realized I wasn't going to fight for what she had already claimed. But she didn’t understand; I was beyond fighting. I was ready to erase every trace of my former life.

As I left the café, the city swallowed me up, a cacophony of sounds and chaos. But I was focused, driven by a singular purpose. I would cut all ties, sever every connection to the life Cameron had tainted. My heart was a fortress, fortified against the pain and ready to embrace the unknown.

The countdown to my disappearance had begun, each tick of the clock bringing me closer to freedom. While Cameron remained oblivious, tangled in his web of deceit, I prepared to disappear—to start anew and leave him to face the void of his own making.

As I walked away, the city lights flickering against the night sky, I felt a strange sense of peace. For the first time, the path ahead was mine alone, unburdened by the shadows of betrayal. And as the light faded, I knew that soon, Cameron would learn the true consequences of his actions.

The stage was set for my departure, and I would watch from afar, knowing he had lost the one person who truly loved him. In that quiet resolve, I felt the stirrings of hope—a promise of new beginnings and the courage to embrace what lay beyond.

Chapter 3

The Brooklyn brownstone stood inconspicuous among its neighbors, weathered brick and wrought-iron railings giving no hint of the secrets exchanged within. I glanced over my shoulder before climbing the steps, my heart hammering against my ribs. This meeting would erase Isabella Martinez from existence.

Arthur Finch opened the door before I could knock, his expression as neutral as his gray suit.

""Ms. Martinez. Right on time."" He ushered me inside, the heavy door closing with a finality that made my breath catch.

The interior was surprisingly ordinary—tasteful antiques, leather-bound books, the soft ticking of a grandfather clock. It looked like a respectable lawyer's office, not the headquarters for orchestrated disappearances.

""Please, sit."" Arthur gestured to a chair across from his desk, then retrieved a leather portfolio. ""I have everything prepared.""

He laid out documents with methodical precision—bank records, identity papers, travel arrangements. My new life, condensed into manila folders.

""Your documentation."" He slid a passport across the polished wood. ""Camille Hayes. Thirty-two. Art consultant. Originally from Chicago, recently relocated to London after your divorce.""

I opened the passport with trembling fingers. The woman in the photo was me, yet somehow not me. Same features, different hair, subtle makeup changes. A stranger wearing my face.

""The resemblance is close enough for documentation, different enough to avoid immediate recognition,"" Arthur explained, noting my expression. ""The digital footprint for Camille has been established over the past year. Social media, credit history, employment records. Nothing flashy, nothing that invites scrutiny.""

I signed where he indicated, my signature transforming with each document—evolving from Isabella Martinez to Camille Hayes. With each stroke of the pen, I felt myself becoming someone else.

""And the... event?"" I couldn't bring myself to say ""my death.""

""All arranged for your wedding day. The body double is a highly sophisticated prop, virtually indistinguishable from a real person upon casual observation. The confusion will be sufficient until you're safely away."" Arthur's clinical tone made it sound like we were discussing a business merger rather than my staged demise.

""Will it hurt him?"" I asked, surprising myself with the question.

Arthur's eyes met mine, the first hint of emotion crossing his features. ""That, Ms. Martinez, depends entirely on how much he cared in the first place.""

I left the brownstone an hour later, Camille Hayes's passport burning in my purse like a live coal.

\* \* \*

That evening, our penthouse felt cavernous in its emptiness. Cameron was in Seattle, courting investors—or perhaps with Vanessa. I no longer knew which of his stories were true.

I sat in his study, the room where he'd built his empire, my laptop casting blue shadows across his mahogany desk. One by one, I closed our joint accounts, transferring my personal savings to the offshore accounts Arthur had established. Each keystroke felt like cutting another cord that had bound me to Cameron.

As the numbers dwindled in our shared accounts and grew in Camille's, I felt a strange calm settle over me. Nine years of my life had been an investment in us, in him. Now I was reclaiming what was mine.

The final transfer completed with an anticlimactic digital ping. I leaned back in Cameron's leather chair, running my fingers along the armrests where his hands had rested countless times. Would he sit here after my ""death,"" grieving the woman he'd already replaced? Would Vanessa comfort him in this very chair?

The thought should have wounded me. Instead, it strengthened my resolve.

\* \* \*

The next morning, I began methodically erasing myself from our home.

I packed my wardrobe first—designer dresses Cameron had insisted I wear to his corporate events, shoes that had pinched my feet but matched his vision of the perfect tech mogul's partner. Each item went into suitcases that would be shipped to a storage facility under Camille's name.

Next came the photos. Us in Bali for our fifth anniversary. The candid shot from his company's launch party, where I'd spent the entire evening ensuring his potential investors were comfortable while he pitched his vision. The framed picture from college—two smiling kids with nothing but dreams and instant ramen.

I removed each one, leaving behind bare walls and empty spaces. The penthouse transformed, becoming a showroom rather than a home—all neutral décor and impersonal touches.

As I placed the last photo in a box, I paused. It was us at Chloe's engagement party last year, Cameron's arm around my waist, both of us laughing at something off-camera. We looked happy. We looked real.

Had it all been a lie? Or had something changed along the way—something I'd missed while I was busy supporting his dreams?

I closed the box, sealing away that question with all the others I would never have answered.

Standing in our hollowed-out penthouse, I realized Cameron might not even notice what was missing until it was too late. He hadn't truly seen me in years.

Soon, he never would again.I’ll send the link to the full story in 10 minutes—just comment below.",2,1755030859.0,Novelnews,2,1.0,False

I usually will ask visitors and give drinks or biscuits but I’ve been shouted at by certain wards for doing it.  Sometimes I’ve even been shouted at by family members for not offering them drinks. There is nothing more awkward than when you approach a patient and ask if they want a drink and their family just chirps up and ‘I’ll have a coffee’. I try and stand in front of the drinks so the ward managers don’t see me doing it 😭. But I mean they are the cheapest teabags and coffee known to man so why not give them one??

1mok4zp,https://www.reddit.com/r/RSbookclub/comments/1mok4zp/the_summer_book/,The Summer Book,"It was a tiny kitten when it came and could drink its milk only from a nipple. Fortunately, they still had Sophia’s baby bottle in the attic. In the beginning, the kitten slept in a tea cozy to keep warm, but when it found its legs they let it sleep in the cottage in Sophia’s bed. It had its own pillow, next to hers.

It was a gray fisherman’s cat and it grew fast. One day, it left the cottage and moved into the house, where it spent its nights under the bed in the box where they kept the dirty dishes. It had odd ideas of its own even then. Sophia carried the cat back to the cottage and tried as hard as she could to ingratiate herself, but the more love she gave it, the quicker it fled back to the dish box. When the box got too full, the cat would howl and someone would have to wash the dishes. Its name was Ma Petite, but they called it Moppy.

“It’s funny about love,” Sophia said. “The more you love someone, the less he likes you back.”

“That’s very true,” Grandmother observed. “And so what do you do?”

“You go on loving,” said Sophia threateningly. “You love harder and harder.”

Her grandmother sighed and said nothing.

“You know,” Sophia said, “sometimes I think I hate Moppy. I don’t have the strength to go on loving him, but I think about him all the time!”

Week after week, Sophia pursued the cat. She spoke softly and gave him comfort and understanding, and only a couple of times did she lose her patience and yell at him, or pull his tail. At such times Moppy would hiss and run under the house, and afterward his appetite was better and he slept even longer than usual, curled up in unapproachable softness with one paw daintily across his nose.

Sophia stopped playing and started having nightmares. She couldn’t think about anything but this cat who refused to be affectionate. Meanwhile, Moppy grew into a lean and wild little animal, and one June night he didn’t come back to his dish box. In the morning, he walked into the house and stretched—front legs first, with his rear end up in the air—then he closed his eyes and sharpened his claws on the rocking chair, after which he jumped up on the bed and went to sleep. The cat’s whole being radiated calm superiority.

He’s started hunting, Grandmother thought.

She was right. The very next morning, the cat came in and placed a small grayish-yellow bird on the doorsill. Its neck had been deftly broken with one bite, and some bright red drops of blood lay prettily on the shiny coat of feathers. Sophia turned pale and stared fixedly at the murdered bird. She sidled past Moppy, the murderer, with small, forced steps, and then turned and rushed out.

Later, Grandmother remarked on the curious fact that wild animals, cats for example, cannot understand the difference between a rat and a bird.

“Then they’re dumb!” said Sophia curtly. “Rats are hideous, and birds are nice. I don’t think I’ll talk to Moppy for three days.” And she stopped talking to her cat.

Every night, the cat went into the woods, and every morning it killed its prey and carried it into the house to be admired, and every morning the bird was thrown into the sea. A little while later, Sophia would appear outside the window and shout, “Can I come in? Have you taken out the body?” She punished Moppy and increased her own pain by means of a terrible coarseness. “Have you cleaned up the blood?” she would yell, or, “How many murdered today?” And morning coffee was no longer what it had been.

It was a great relief when Moppy finally learned to conceal his crimes. It is one thing to see a pool of blood and quite another thing only to know about it. Moppy probably grew tired of all the screaming and fussing, and perhaps he thought the family ate his birds. One morning when Grandmother was taking her first cigarette on the veranda, she dropped her holder and it rolled through a crack in the floor. She managed to raise one of the planks, and there was Moppy’s handiwork—a row of small bird skeletons, all picked clean. Of course she knew that the cat had continued to hunt, and could not have stopped, but the next time he rubbed against her leg as he passed, she drew away and whispered, “You sly bastard.” The cat dish stood, untouched, by the steps and attracted flies.

“You know what?” Sophia said. “I wish Moppy had never been born. Or else that I’d never been born. That would have been better.”

“So you’re still not speaking to each other?” Grandmother asked.

“Not a word,” Sophia said. “I don’t know what to do. And if I do forgive him—what fun is that when he doesn’t even care?” Grandmother couldn’t think of anything to say.

Moppy turned wild and rarely came into the house. He was the same color as the island—a light yellowish-gray with striped shadings like granite, or like sunlight on a sand bottom. When he slipped across the meadow by the beach, his progress was like a stroke of wind through the grass. He would watch for hours in the thicket, a motionless silhouette, two pointed ears against the sunset, and then suddenly vanish ... and some bird would chirp, just once. He would slink under the creeping pines, soaked by the rain and lean as a streak, and he would wash himself voluptuously when the sun came out. He was an absolutely happy cat, but he didn’t share with anyone. On hot days, he would roll on the smooth rock, and sometimes he would eat grass and calmly vomit his own hair the way cats do. And what he did between times no one knew.

One Saturday, the Övergårds came for coffee. Sophia went down to look at their boat. It was big, full of bags and jerry cans and baskets, and in one of the baskets a cat was meowing. Sophia lifted the lid and the cat licked her hand. It was a big, white cat with a broad face. It kept right on purring when she picked it up and carried it ashore.

“So you found the cat,” said Anna Övergård. “It’s a nice cat, but it’s not a mouser, so we thought we’d give it to some friends.”

Sophia sat on the bed with the heavy cat on her lap. It never stopped purring. It was soft and warm and submissive.

They struck a bargain easily, with a bottle of rum to close the deal. Moppy was captured and never knew what was happening until the Övergårds’ boat was on its way to town.

The new cat’s name was Fluff. It ate fish and liked to be petted. It moved into Sophia’s cottage and slept every night in her arms, and every morning it came in to morning coffee and slept some more in the bed beside the stove. If the sun was shining, it would roll on the warm granite.

“Not there!” Sophia yelled. “That’s Moppy’s place!” She carried the cat a little farther off, and it licked her on the nose and rolled obediently in the new spot.

The summer grew prettier and prettier, a long series of calm blue summer days. Every night, Fluff slept against Sophia’s cheek.

“It’s funny about me,” Sophia said. “I think nice weather gets to be boring.”

“Do you?” her grandmother said. “Then you’re just like your grandfather, he liked storms too.” But before she could say anything else about Grandfather, Sophia was gone.

And gradually the wind came up, sometime during the night, and by morning there was a regular southwester spitting foam all over the rocks.

“Wake up,” Sophia whispered. “Wake up, kitty, precious, there’s a storm.”

Fluff purred and stretched warm sleepy legs in all directions. The sheet was covered with cat hair.

“Get up!” Sophia shouted. “It’s a storm!” But the cat just turned over on its broad stomach. And suddenly Sophia was furious. She kicked open the door and threw the cat out in the wind and watched how it laid its ears back, and she screamed, “Hunt! Do something! Be like a cat!” And then she started to cry and ran to the guest room and banged on the door.

“What’s wrong now?” Grandmother said.

“I want Moppy back!” Sophia screamed.

“But you know how it’ll be,” Grandmother said.

“It’ll be awful,” said Sophia gravely. “But it’s Moppy I love.”

Everything has been going great and we are planning to have a child. I would like to build an addition onto our house. I have gotten an estimate on the work from a local contractor and it will be pretty expensive. I am just a humble farmer and there is no way my income will be able to cover this addition in the timeframe that we have planned. For context i moved here with nothing but the shirt on my back and a few tools so there really isnt a way to get a loan. Luckily my grandfather left me a small cabin to live in. Now Mia has lived here in town for a while. She still owns a nice place on a riverfront lot closer to town. I have been doing all of the work to support ourselves while she putters around the farm. She drinks about 2 bottles of wine (that i produce on the farm) per week at the expense of our extra income, and spends her time with art projects. She has had a showcase in town, and although her art is pretty good, none ever sells. Now heres where im having the issue. I have tried to speak to her about selling her property to cover the addition but she always brings something else up first. I know that the contractor i got the estimate from is planning a new home in town for about 500k. This money would be plenty for the addition, even if Mias home appraised for less. Mia refuses to talk about the option of selling this property. Her ex-bf has also been around a few times, and once i made the mistake of punching him in the face bc he was bothering us. Im afraid that Mia is keeping this property as a fallback in case she changes her mind about me, and will have her ex-bf move in with her. Ive been so worked up over these issues that ive stopped producing the wine that she loves, and ive been thinking about not starting a family with her. She used to make me coffee sometimes in the morning, but now I usually just get up and head out the door without speaking to her.

I'd love to know your thoughts on the ""What I bring to the table"" list and the ""What I'm looking for"" list because I don't have anyone to help me balance my perspectives right now.    


Am I being reasonable? Am I looking for a needle in a haystack? Will I ever find my forever lover/best friend? 

Thank you for any advice. This is very very painful :( But, as always, I'm still staying positive and remain hopeful!  



**What I’m looking for:**

* Straight man in his late 30s, 40s, early 50s 
* Monogamous
* Good sense of humor – likes to laugh.
* Doesn’t have kids, does want kids, or doesn’t want kids

* 5’9” or taller (I’m 5’8” & 125 lb.) —  this is **not** a hard boundary. I’ve dated shorter guys before. 
* Healthy sexuality – no ultra-complicated niche kinks (no super freaky stuff like crossdressing, pegging, or BBWs, sex addictions, or history of excessive cheating/infidelity)
* Can be comfortable in each other's presence in silence sometimes – can be around each other without constantly talking, and it still feels good and supportive :) 
* Wants to build a lifelong relationship with a loyal woman and be best friends, partners, and lovers forever.
* Wants a true partner in life who you can depend on (take care of each other)
* Wants marriage someday (within the first few years -- I waited 10 years for my ex (a timeline he set), and when I asked about it after 10 years, he left) 
* No drugs, but occasional drinking and cannabis are okay (I'm an Irish heritage American girl who loves Guinness, and I unwind sometimes at the end of the day with some cannabis)

* Doesn’t play excessive amounts of video games or live on social media – obviously, some of these are okay. (I have Reddit, work twitter/X, and Messenger to talk to family) 
* Loves his mom and sisters (unless there's a problematic history or something). I don’t have a supportive or present mother, but I get along with other people's moms and appreciate a man who treats his mother/sisters/females well enough to understand and respect women. 
* No more than one divorce (I married my HS sweetheart in my 20s and we divorced after 2 years, I don’t know if that counts –  I haven't remarried) 
* Likes alternative forms of spirituality and philosophy  (I like learning about Daoism, Buddhism, Jung, and philosophy) 
* Not abusive, indifferent, or cruel to animals, elderly folks, or women 
* Hygienic (showers at least 3-4x times a week and keeps \*ahem\* certain parts clean) 
* Intelligent but not arrogant or condescending

* Wants to help me achieve my goals, dreams, and desires just as much as I want to help them achieve theirs :)

1mok29e,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimCorner/comments/1mok29e/unstable_mother/,Unstable Mother,"Assalamualaikum everyone

I’m writing because I’m dealing with a major issue where my mother is extremely mentally unstable. My father was emotionally unavailable but they are divorced and she seems to have developed a lot of his toxic culture traits because he still ran the family dynamic while they had shared custody with me and my three sisters growing up. We are now all in our twenties, I’m the youngest (the one who was my mom’s emotional comfort and all my sisters, everyone else had problems so I never had the space to. When my mom gets emotional she is consumed by emotion and she is extremely negative and pours all of her emotions and problems on me my whole life. I was always comforting either her or my sisters or my father but that’s besides the point it’s just to show she is extremely unstable with her emotions but a major people pleaser with people outside of her daughters. ) My mother never used to be able to defend us against our abusive father and even though she hates him she has people pleasing tendencies and would always do what he says or want he wants with us anyways so there’s no wrong in his eyes from her. My sisters husband also confides in my mom because my mom is a pleaser so she will always tell him he’s right even at the expensive of my sister who is married to the guy. My mom will never take criticism without spiraling into tears and screaming and saying she’s going to commit suicide and then shutting of her phone and disappearing for hours to scare us and send us into panick until she gets back. This has happened so so many times that when she does it it’s getting very frustrating because it’s like the boy who cried wolf, she terrifies everyone for attention and then comes back but we can’t not take it seriously but also how can we if that makes sense. My mom is a very sneaky woman, a very good hearted kind woman with a good heart but extremely mentally unstable and unbearable to live with. She does not allow anyone to be sad but herself or anyone to communicate their needs without spiraling into tears”I’m a horrible mother” and starting to pull on her hair and scream. I’ve stopped communicating my needs because I realized she will never hear it truly, it’ll always be about her emotions and mine will never be valid. But I set boundaries if I’m not comfortable with things or I feel like putting myself first sometimes but it doesn’t come without a reaction from her. In my house I struggle to pray without my mother screaming my name, I struggle to get anything done because if I’m not sitting under my mothers eyes she says I don’t love her or spend time with her. Sometimes I just want to be in control of my day without getting told I’m a bad daughter if I want even two hours to myself out of the whole day. We can’t spend 8 hours together and the second I go upstairs to take a shower or read Quran or pray she starts complaining about no one sits with her. She is extremely unstable emotionally, today I asked her not to turn on a birthday song and start recording me in a coffee shop and she did it anyways and I looked annoyed in the video because I was asking her not to since it makes me uncomfortable and she started screaming and crying in the car and speeding and I had to take her car keys when we got home because she was threatening to do the killing herself thing and disappearing for hours. then she went to her room and screamed at the top of her lungs crying completely unstable like someone died for over 20 mins I could hear her from my room all the way upstairs. Then she texts me a million texts about how shes going to kill herself because “she’s a horrible mother who just tried her best.” 

We’ve all tried to get her to therapy for years or some kind of intervention but she is not willing. I beg for your duaas and if anyone knows any good advice or can share a similar situation with a solution that helped I’d appreciate it. JAK.",6,1755030643.0,MuslimCorner,5,1.0,False

Their enforcer, Hunter, eyed me. ""Who's she? And those same amber eyes—""

Rambler cut him off, gripping my wrist. ""Answer the question. Who are you? Why here?""

""I don't know who I am."" My voice steady, I pulled the frayed patch from my pocket.

""This did. Found me at twelve, neck raw from a noose, bleeding in Big Bend. An old man gave me this.""

Rambler's stare locked on the patch—Brothers of Chaos. His jaw tightened.

""Does this mean… You know my father?""

Silence. Then, ""Thunder's our president."" He paused and looked behind me. ""I think he's your father, too.""

I whipped around. Thunder's gaze met mine, amber to amber. Shock rippled through me.

————————

Phoenix paid for her iced tea and looked up to thank the man behind the counter.

He took one look into her eyes and gasped at their unusual color.

She smiled a bit nervously at the face he made but ducked her head away and put her sunglasses back on. She walked out to the patio and sat down at one of the tables. Slipping off her jacket, she placed it on the back of her chair and looked around the area.

Radium Springs wasn't a very big town, only about a thousand people or so. She remembered seeing a population sign as she drove into town but she was too busy taking in the surroundings to pay too much attention to the numbers on the sign.

She'd come here with the hopes of trying to find her missing past. For the last twelve years, she hadn't known who she was. Her hand crept up to her throat and even now, she could still feel the scars she wore from an incident that almost killed her.

Phoenix always wore a scarf to hide it but she knew it was there. Two perfect rows of a rope wrapped around her neck to strangle her as her skin swelled against the tightness of the hemp cord. Lucky for her, the rope was old and not in as good a shape as the user had expected. The rope still bit into her bruised flesh but it didn't quite strangle her before it broke.

Phoenix dragged her thoughts away from that time in her life. It always drove her crazy, as she could never figure out just why it had ever happened. Why would anyone drag a nine year old kid out into the desert and leave her there in the full sun with a rope wrapped so tight around her neck, she was almost strangled? What had she done that was so bad someone just threw her away like that?

Phoenix didn't know but she hoped she was finally in the one place she could find the answers she'd been looking for, for the last twelve years. She'd been told this was where it all began. She could still feel the burn of the tattoo gun on her shoulder as the artist inked her not so long ago.

When she came to that day twelve years ago, she'd found herself in an old man's cabin at the edge of the desert park, he told her she would live. Her throat was on fire that day while he explained what happened to her as much as he could tell from her wounds and the scars she would bear for the rest of her life.

He also gave her something he'd found on her person. It was a patch she had in her pocket. He thought maybe it was a biker's patch. It read Brothers of Chaos, New Mexico Chapter . She just stared at it for the longest time, like she didn't know what she was looking at. She didn't know who she was either, or what brought her here to this place. She had panicked and the old man had had to hold her down, so she wouldn't hurt herself.

That was when she noticed another child sitting in the corner of the room. He was around her age or so she thought and when the old man introduced them, she found out the kid was his grandson, Tao. The old man told her his name was Moon and that soon he and Tao would join up with the rest of their tribe at the Gathering, a celebration the Apache's had once a year to catch up with family and friends.

Now she had finally found herself here in Radium Springs. She wasn't sure if this was a smart move on her part or not but the tat she had inked on her skin was the first step she had taken to reclaiming her past. The tat almost matched the patch she had found so long ago in her pocket. When she handed it to the artist, she asked him if he could do it on her shoulder. He hadn't wanted to, but she talked him into it. She asked if he could break the patch into two pieces just broken enough so the patch wouldn't be complete. She didn't know what the patch meant to her but she felt she needed to find out. And with the patch not complete, she hoped it wouldn't piss off the MC.

Once the tat had healed, Phoenix decided it was time and she set off to find Radium Springs. As she sat down at the table, she knew the man behind the counter would be able to see the tat on her shoulder and she hoped he would make a call to the MC to let them know she was there.

She didn't know what would happen next and her belly was rolling in fear but this was her first step...one she needed to take. Good or bad, she didn't know but it was too late to stop it now.

She adjusted the scarf on her throat and sat there sipping her tea. It didn't take long, maybe twenty minutes before she heard the roar of bike engines and she had to smile. She turned her head and looked back into the coffee shop. The man was still standing at the counter but now he was wearing a frown. She lifted her cup and silently saluted him.

Turning to face the front of the street, she saw four bikers coming toward her. They parked almost in front of her table and the one in the middle just glared at her through the lenses of the mirrored sunglasses he wore.

When he got off the bike, she couldn't believe how tall he was. Well over six feet, he could be mistaken for a tank. His shoulders were broad and they tapered down to a slim waist and tree trunks for legs. His dark hair hung down to his shoulders and he was sporting a full beard. He wore a bandana and a red t-shirt under his cut.

His feet were encased in black leather biker boots and as he walked toward her, her heartbeat matched the sound of his footsteps.

He paused then pulled out the chair opposite of where she sat.

The other bikers sat down all around her and no one said a word to her.

The man from behind the counter brought out a tray of drinks but she didn't look at him. He gave each of the new men a drink and then he disappeared back inside the shop.



She couldn't take her eyes off the man sitting at her table. For some reason, she thought she remembered him.

But that was impossible wasn't it? Had she been here before? She moved her eyes away from his face and studied the town again. Had she really been here before, if so why couldn't she remember?

The man across from her cleared his throat and she slowly brought her head back to study him. He reached up and removed his sunglasses. The first sight of his eyes hit her hard. She knew those eyes. She'd seen those eyes a very long time ago.

She gasped as she remembered another pair of eyes so much like his. Eyes clouded with pain while the sound of his voice had been calling out her name. She couldn't remember what he was saying but she remembered being close to him. Finally, she watched as the light faded from those eyes and then before she called out to him, someone was ripping her away from him. Then she couldn't remember anything but pain.

Nervously, she wet her lips with her tongue. Then she leaned forward and she could barely whisper but she mouthed the words, "" Do I know you?""

Rambler frowned as he stared at her. ""What?""

When he got the call from Mike at the coffee shop, he'd been stunned by the other man's words. He gathered up Hunter, Bearcat and Raven. They rode down to confront a situation he hoped wouldn't get someone killed.

​When he got off his bike, he was surprised at her appearance. She was a small woman with long dark hair. He couldn't see her eyes yet, but she looked almost too dainty to be real. No, not dainty but delicate, almost fragile as if the next big wind could blow her away.

He'd only known one other woman who looked like her, that had been a lifetime ago and he hoped to never see that woman again. He knew if that woman ever came back to this area, plenty of his brothers would be very happy to see her dead, his own president included. Twelve years ago, he would have been happy to see her dead as well.

Twelve years ago, his own blood brother was killed and he wanted justice for Mac. They say time heals all wounds but this one was not healed, it would never heal as long as his killer was out there still living the good life. It felt just as raw today as it had been back then. But as he studied her this girl reminded him of her.

""Who are you?"" He growled at her.

""I'm called Phoenix,"" she whispered as she looked down at the table between them. ""But I'm not sure if that's my name or not.""

Rambler sneered at her. ""How can you not know your own name? You aren't making any sense woman.""

She snapped her head up and glared at him through her own sunglasses. ""Don't you judge me. You don't have that right. You have no idea what I've been through, so you can't tell me that.""

Rambler grunted as he reached out and snatched the glasses off her face. He stared at her and more importantly the color of her eyes. He sat back and gasped.

The small woman glared at him.

""Rambler, what is going on here?"" Hunter, the club's enforcer asked. ""Who is she and why does she have those same eyes?""

""I don't know but I aim to find out."" Rambler growled. He reached out and grabbed her wrist hauling her closer to him, ""Now tell me, who are you and why did you come here?""

Phoenix fought to get free but he wasn't letting her go. His fingers tightened and bit down into her skin and she tightened her lips. She refused to give him the satisfaction of knowing he was hurting her. ""Let me go.""

""I don't think so sweetheart,"" Rambler grumbled. He looked over at Hunter and nodded.

The club's enforcer got up and walked around to her back where he paused and stared at the tat on her shoulder.

Rambler watched his face and when he nodded, Rambler hauled her to her feet and twisted her around so he could see her back.

There on her shoulder was the ink he'd been told about. She carried the MC's patch, only this one was broken in half, so it was incomplete. ""How did you know what our patch looked like? You don't have the right to wear this. It's for club members only.""

She stumbled and fell to her knees as Rambler pushed her away from him.

She looked up at him and Rambler could read fear in her eyes. But the longer he glared at her the more he realized it was more than simple fear in her eyes. It was downright terror and the longer she was on her knees the deeper the terror went.

He reached down to help her to her feet.

In panic, she scooted away from him. She curled herself up into a small ball and cried out when he came near her.

Rambler looked over at his men then back at her. No one knew what was going on.

""Ok, everyone just sit down and settle down for a minute,"" Rambler announced in a quiet, steady voice. He backed away slowly and sat down in his chair.

The others all sat down as well and after a moment, Rambler motioned to her chair. ""We don't hurt women or innocents. You are safe here with us.""

""But how do I know that? You were so angry before,"" Phoenix whispered as she slipped her sunglasses back onto her face.

Rambler thought about it for a moment from her perspective and he had to agree with her, ""Yes I was and I apologize for that. You reminded me of someone I knew a long time ago and it had been a trying time for the club. Something very bad happened and we were betrayed by someone we had come to care about very much."" He paused to raise a brow at her. ""Then you show up out of the blue and refuse to tell us anything about yourself. Then you're wearing our patch but nobody here knows you."" He looked around the parking lot and found her vehicle. ""And your car has Texas plates on it. You shouldn't know our patch or where we are located. Care to explain yourself?""

Phoenix got to her feet slowly and moved stiffly back to her chair. She had to move it, so she would be able to see everyone sitting there. She kept her eyes on Rambler but lifted her head just a little and said, ""I would love to explain but here's the rub. I have no clue who I am. I was found at the edge of the Big Bend National Park, bloody and broken with a noose around my neck, twelve years ago. When I woke up, I didn't know my own name let alone where I belonged.""

She has many students, she teaches in different batches of students however, a few Kuwaiti students as per information she provided me, she takes one on one classes. She has a Kuwaiti student (34M) for spoken English, a two month course that he just started, he is married, 3 kids. So far he only had 4 classes, but he has started bringing Coffee for wife from last two classes. My wife is very impressed by him, he works in KNPC ( a big govt oil company), has bunch of businesses including resturants, and very well mannered. Right now I am not in Kuwait, she is staying with her family.  I told my wife that this is weird. But she said he is nice and has no bad intentions. And also she said that she won't stop him from bringing Coffee if he does on his own will. Should I be worried ? What should I be doing? And additional question, would he have bought her coffee if she was a Kuwaiti married woman?


TBH I am not very comfortable. However,  since wife shared on her own, I feel a little better. However, I feel that a two month is a long time. Also, she has clear communication through WhatsApp regarding class scheduling with all the students although it is office issued SIM card. So yeah, right now it is all about trust. Also it is weird he brings her a coffee she didn't like before, Iced Americano. i like this drink and always order it for myself and she drinks some other mild coffee. So this is weird that she suddenly started liking Iced Americano.

A bit of background to help you understand my insecurities: 

I met my wife when we were young, i had lots of potential, but currently things arent that well financially. And now, my wife is in a new phase of life where she wants to work hard, make lots of money, stay in a good place, in a good country, that's why she is okay staying away from me in Kuwait with her parents. We are from Delhi, India. I have job here in Delhi, which is a below average sort of job, pays around  INR 70-80K ( around 300 in Kuwaiti Dinar, wife earns 330 KD), stay in a not so good area. Hence, she doesn't like to stay at my place due to the locality. We are thinking of working towards moving to a different country. Recently, she got her father to buy a visa for me to travel to Kuwait, I tried job searching in Kuwait, found very hard to land a job, still have Kuwait visa valid for another six months.  I had to come back to India as I couldn't stay unemployed in Kuwait for too long. I joined a job here in India and she didn't follow me here. So you can understand where I am coming from in this situation with my insecurities.",2,1755029972.0,MuslimMarriage,8,1.0,False

1mojov9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1mojov9/vent_nightmare_vacation/,Vent nightmare vacation,"Does anybody ever feel guilty about their feelings towards their sk’s? My partner has his kids 50-50 and when they are here I find myself hiding or going to the gym a lot…. 

Anyways we decided to go on vacation with SD (12) and my mom and partner, it was terrible. The SD has had terrible foot odour from her crocs and claims she can’t smell it and acts like it’s such a huge chore to wash her feet… and even shower! Also at 12 she shouldn’t have to be told when it’s time to shower! Also she whines and does baby voice constantly despite being asked to speak normally for years.  The stinky feet situation also happened on a road trip last year so before this trip I told my partner NO CROCS!!! I have very sensitive nose and stomach and begged him to tell her no crocs…. We get in the vehicle to go and booooom crocs and no socks… lovely. Her feet stink to the point I felt sick for days and couldn’t eat!! Then when she was told to wear sneakers she would cry and complain that her legs were tired or feet hurt?! When I was a kid I remember feeling happy and excited to go on vacation if I complained non stop or acted the way she did my parents would have turned the car around and went come!! 

When we started dating my partner would justify the bad behaviour by saying “she’s just 7” “she’s just 8” “she’s just 9”….. well now I guess she’s “just” 12 !?and completely unbearable as a result of my partners “passive parenting”! For reference he is an amazing father but when they are here he doesn’t step up to be both roles (mom/dad) and I’m not willing to play evil step mom! yes he is the fun/ nurturing father but he is not strict and never gives natural consequences. Because of this both of his kids are extremely entitled and although kids are egocentric his kids don’t seem to realize that other people also have needs and their needs are not more important than everyone else… for example SD 12 was told to go to bed one night and we were sharing a hotel room and kept a small lamp on the desk so it wasn’t pitch black and she had an eye mask on yet still whined and cried about the light constantly… to the point that her dad said “fine I’ll turn it off” and I said no… her needs are important yes but so are everybody else’s here and my mom was out in the lobby so she would be returning to a pitch black room so I said no… and I’m made to be the bad guy even though she was sleeping 30’seconds later. Also She had to be the first to step into the hotel room and first to “claim her bed” and immediately run towards the outlet to set up all her chargers to charge her devices… 


I feel like in a divorced shared custody situation since the kids are only at each parents for one week at a time the parents are more inclined to just do everything for them because it’s easier/ faster and they do more for them then the average parent would because of guilt of not seeing them all the time but it just makes the kids entitled with zero sense of independence or awareness for others… 

Before the trip my partner went to buy some snacks and specifically I picked out a few things that I liked (as did SD) I put a large container of hand sanitizer with the snacks and asked that she use it before eating the snacks and to use a bowl instead of reaching her hand in repeatedly… she did not do either and was licking her fingers so all the snacks became hers…. I also watched her eat 10 cookies in a row so I said to her “just so you know an average serving of cookies is 2-3 not 10”…. She later cried to her father that I fat shamed her….. which was a final straw for me and I decided I would never go on a trip with the kids again…. 

At restaurants everyone would order water to save money but she needed a fancy drink everytime and would even try ordering 2 mains. At one restaurant my mom and I ordered tiny 6$ garden salads and a nacho to share, SD ordered a main and was going to order her own nacho but I said that would be too much food and she can have some of our nacho… when the nacho came she started eating it very fast and picking the nachos with the most toppings, I tried to tell her to stay in her “quadrant” since there was 4 people… idk if her dad saw how she was devouring it and decided to not have any because of this but when she asked him if he was going to have any and he declined she started eating even more aggressively to the point that my mom and I have 1 or 2 each but we were too disgusted to eat it (she is also licking her fingers and eating in a gross way). 
Later that day my mom went to get a coffee and she bought 10 timbits and SD her own donut, my mom and partner ate 6 timbits and my mom said “here these are for you” and passed them to me, I put them by my feet and not in the middle where all “SD’s” snacks went because I was trying to send a message that they were mine and not for her. At the gas station I went to pee and when I got back to the car the timbits had all been eaten by here… despite her having her own donut when nobody else did. I was so angry I wanted to say something but after the fat shaming comment I knew I had to bite my tongue…. I couldn’t believe the amount of greed and entitlement!!! And the fact that her dad never said a word or corrected the behaviour! Like I said he is a great dad but that’s not enough, you have to do more than just provide you have to be an active parent, correct poor behaviours and execute natural consequences which he constantly fails to do. Because of this I have grown resentment towards him and his kids! I used to love kids and I had cousins even younger (twins 8 years old) that seem to be so much more mature and well mannered! 

He also has a son (11), but he also is the same. We go to a restaurant and since it wasn’t the expensive one he wanted to go to he sat there and sulked the entire time! Like do they not realize going out to eat is a treat and not somebody that we have to do? There is never any please or thank you, and they don’t ever have anything deep to say. I feel like they have zero personality and are so obsessed with food to the point it’s not normal! I am going crazy in this situation and I don’t like how I feel inside because of this! I feel wrong saying that there is something wrong with these kids but there has to be! 

SD also has zero coping skills, at the start of the slightest inconvenience she is in tears crying and once she starts she can’t stop! We were packing are stuff to load into the car and it was by the door not even in the car yet and she’s sobbing because a bag she wanted in the car was with the stuff that was going in the trunk? Little situations that aren’t actual problems turn into full blown melt downs! I’ve  been telling him for years that his daughter needs professional help for her anxiety and the son has raging ADHD but he does NOTHING about it!! Both of them have zero coping or problem solving skills and if they do not have immediate gratification it’s a melt down! His daughter actually woke me up from dead sleep in the car to pass me her garage… I said what do you want me to do about it?? Figure it out! And she started to cry, like it’s unbelievable! 

For context I want zero kids, I’m a lot younger than my partner and I love him but “love” for him doesn’t feel like enough anymore… I dread the day they arrive here and I celebrate when they leave! And the kicker is that I am open and honest to him about everything!!!!! I just feel like I’m so so so over it, and watching his kids grow up and realize that kids are a mirror of their parents so when I see their bad traits and behaviour I feel like oh maybe that’s what my partner is actually like and I’m putting 2 and 2 together, maybe he is greedy and selfish and he raised greedy selfish kids! We’ve been together for 7 years and we are engaged but I straight up told him I don’t want to marry him anymore!",2,1755029812.0,stepparents,14,0.67,False

I need a cup of coffee just to get to sleep.      
Can't afford peace of mind, that shits not cheap.      
I need a cup of coffee to help me sleep.

If I have dreams why don't I ever remember them?      
if I wake up more tired is my sleep a broken system?      
Is it my fault? Something I'm doing wrong? If not who do I condemn? 

My anxieties have become habit.      
Suppressing stress is how I manage it!      
Feels like my heart's shrunk and my emotions just don't fit.

Then again I've ignored them for so long I hardly recognise them.      
If they could fit in the palm of my hand, I'd fiddle with them, probably accidentally break them, or worse yet lose them.

Haven't I already?      
Cigarettes don't keep the nerves steady.      
Smoking is just another bad habit I thought I could kick initially.

But I stopped lying to myself recently I think,      
Can't be too sure, lying's become instinct.      
The truth and I share a quiet moment now and again, we link up, have a laugh and a wink.

I've convinced myself that everything's fine.      
So Many broken promises I forgot were mine,      
Have been dulled by the sands it time, but at the right angle they still shine.

What do I need from this universe?      
Another bland blessing or careless curse?      
Why did I forget the best of days but still remember the worst?

Do I need a cup of coffee just to get to sleep?      
If I still have any peace of mind it must be buried somewhere deep,      
Maybe if I can find it, I won't need a cup of coffee to help me sleep?",1,1755029672.0,WisdomWriters,0,1.0,False

Very scary brain and verbal symptoms,"Slight repost, added MRI results and reposting because first post Dr deleted account and post.

Scary brain symptoms a decade into recovery, waiting on doctor appointments

Terrified thinking about my symptoms. Waiting Neurologist . Last MRI 8 years ago did have some spots on brain but they were looking for  MS and acoustic neuroma.

I have been sober for 10 years but am having symptoms so bad that my employers worried.

History: I was blackout drunk multiple nights a week for the better part of about 5-6  years with about 3 years of lesser alcoholism. 

B12 and vitamin D all low but in normal range. So far blood results are fine. They didn’t test for B1.
 
Examples and symptoms:
– Forgetting words; constantly misreading and having to reread things; writing same sentence in an email more than once

-mumbling words or slurring them without realizing

– Forget what I did that day at work 

– Open cupboard- grab wrong thing or open wrong app; realize that isn’t the one I wanted

– Can’t follow conversation or TV shows, so I don’t want to watch new ones; too many names to forget

– being told things or asking the same question multiple times in one conversation, and having  to ask again later, don’t remember 

-Keep saying wrong words, like saying something hotter instead of heavy , ice cream instead of toothpaste 

-Balance issues: but might be related to bad ears, hearing loss and tinnitus

-occasional motion sickness from leaning head back or even fast moving videos

-most symptoms more prominent with poor sleep ; generally get 6.5 hrs of sleep a night

– Looking at things like a water bottle and being like what is that and having to remember what it is (very brief); 

This week 8/01

-looking in drawers and asking about scissors I used 60 seconds prior (this week); 

-looking by for hot sauce in pantry, never been kept there; getting another thing of milk, I had already done it

-yesterday: took home my coworkers leftovers; same white box but mine was in my clear labeled work drawer

-mumbling or lowering speech volume without realizing it 

-recently waking up sweaty after very little sleep and having headaches (recently this week)

New symptoms and tests:

-pissed in bathtub going to bathroom at night (no memory of it)
—keep turning on tv in middle of night no memory

-made coffee with cold water within seconds of saying this needs to be heated first

-bedwetting
-waking up to pain in hands, clearly tying to do something in sleep

- headache and brain and head feel fuzzy and like constantly hungover feeling

- put cheese in drink instead of Mac and cheese 

- on phone on in conversations I just go silent, and multiple people are like it’s your turn to talk now 

MRI Results:

There is no acute infarct or extra-axial fluid collection. There are
several scattered foci of FLAIR hyperintensity in the subcortical
white matter of the frontal and parietal lobes, nonspecific. No
abnormal foci susceptibility artifact in the brain parenchyma to
indicate prior hemorrhage. Midline structures including the pituitary
gland, corpus callosum, and cerebellum are normally formed.
The ventricles are normal in size. There is no mass effect or midline
shift. Major vascular flow voids through the circle of Willis are
intact.
Orbital structures are normal. Minimal scattered mucosal thickening
in the ethmoid air cells. The mastoid air cells are clear. The
nasopharynx is unremarkable. There are no suspicious marrow signal
abnormalities.

Speech therapy results: 

Possible Contributing Factors: History of alcohol abuse, Anxiety
It is concerning to me that patient's memory, attention, language scores
were in the average range, given their expected high average functioning
reported historically and would be evidenced with their level of education
and employment history. I am concerned that these scores do actually
represent a decline in function and thus should be closely monitored as
outlined.

I thought the solution was more hours and more coffee. It wasn’t.

What finally worked for me was **changing** ***how*** **I studied** instead of just pushing harder. A few things that made a huge difference:

**- Short bursts > marathons.** 15–20 minutes of focused work, short break, repeat. Way less mental burnout.

**- Change your environment.** Library, café, even just a different chair - your brain notices the change and pays more attention.

**- Turn notes into quizzes.** I use [Quizuma AI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Simon.flutter_tutorial&hl=pl) (Google Play) to snap a pic of my notes and get quick, interactive quizzes. It forces me to *recall* instead of just reread, which sticks way better.

**- Teach it to someone (or something).** I explain tricky topics out loud to ChatGPT or a friend. If I can teach it, I actually know it.

**- Pair studying with a trigger.** For me, it’s a specific playlist. First song comes on, phone goes away, brain knows it’s focus time.

I stopped aiming for “study 6 hours straight” and started aiming for “get 3 solid bursts in today.” Some days it’s more, some days less, but it’s conistent, and that’s what matters.

What’s one small thing that’s completely changed your ability to focus?",2,1755029580.0,Students,0,1.0,False
