This city doesn’t attract stable people. Instead, it brings people who are running away from something like an irrelevant Midwest hometown or people who have something to prove like a Bushwick DJ without a single release.

Think about it for a second. Your boss’s boss’s boss probably lives in Connecticut or Long Island. They don’t need to constantly be surrounded by overpriced drinks or pretentious coffee shops. They’re at peace anywhere. Your favorite celebrity from here owns multiple homes and treats the city like a pit stop before going off to Europe. None of these successful people’s identity revolves around being a New Yorker. 

Being so for real, people whose entire identity is being a New Yorker use that as a convenient  placeholder while still trying to figure themselves out. Ask any of these people how many NYC things they did in the last week, and the answer is probably zero. They just need to accept that they aren’t really any different from the people in their hometown that they feel superior over. At least I’ve come to terms with it. What about you?

1le6ns0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BobbyMcB99/comments/1le6ns0/is_college_a_scam/,Is college a scam....,"is college a scam like Charlie Kirk thinks?

# ChatGPT said:

Ah, the ol’ “is college a scam?” debate — the intellectual equivalent of yelling “Free Bird!” at an economics lecture.

Let’s break it down without the tribal warfare — no Turning Point USA hats, no Marxist study group stickers — just straight facts, Gen X-to-Z real talk style:

# 💰 The Case For ""College is a Scam"" (a la Charlie Kirk & Co.):

1. **Crushing Student Debt:**
   * Average student loan debt in the U.S. is over **$30,000**. Some majors leave you drowning in debt for a degree that barely opens doors.
2. **Overpriced & Under-delivered:**
   * You pay $50K a year to sit through PowerPoints from adjuncts making $30K. Then you learn more on YouTube in an hour than in a semester.
3. **Ideological Indoctrination?**
   * Right-wing critics like Kirk argue colleges are breeding grounds for ""woke"" ideology and leftist politics, not critical thinking. (There’s *some* truth in echo chambers depending on the school.)
4. **Outdated Curriculum:**
   * You get a communications degree but can’t make a resume or budget. Meanwhile, your cousin on YouTube makes $10K/month doing prank videos and drop shipping.
5. **Trades & Tech Rule Now:**
   * Plumbers, electricians, coders, and IT techs are thriving — with no degrees and no debt. College isn’t the only path anymore.

# 🎓 The Case Against “It’s a Scam” (Why College Still Matters):

1. **Higher Lifetime Earnings:**
   * On average, college grads earn **$1 million+ more** over a lifetime than non-grads. Stats don’t lie (though averages can be misleading — looking at you, liberal arts debt survivors).
2. **Some Degrees** ***Do*** **Pay Off:**
   * Engineering, Computer Science, Nursing, Finance — if you’re in these, you’re good. ROI (Return on Investment) can be huge.
3. **Networks & Credentials:**
   * College is often about *access* — alumni networks, internships, credentials that open high-status jobs that you just *can’t* get otherwise.
4. **Personal Growth:**
   * For some, college is the place they figure themselves out — emotionally, intellectually, even sexually (let’s be real). That’s not nothing.
5. **Gatekeeping Professions:**
   * Want to be a lawyer, doctor, therapist, teacher, or scientist? Tough luck without a degree. Some systems are built around the credential pipeline.

# 🧠 The Balanced Truth (Your Friendly Gen Z-Fueled Wisdom):

* **College isn’t a scam — but it is a** ***product*****.** And like any product, you should shop smart. Don’t pay Ferrari prices for a go-kart degree.
* **Not all degrees are created equal.** A philosophy degree from Yale is different from one at ""Totally Real State University.""
* **The system needs reform.** Big time. Cheaper tuition, better curriculum, and fewer useless gen ed classes about mold spores and 18th-century basket weaving.

# 🔥 TL;DR Hot Take:

**College is only a scam if you treat it like a magic ticket instead of a strategic investment.**  
Pick a degree that pays, know your ROI, and don’t go into debt for something you could’ve Googled for free.

Or, ya know, join a trade, build a business, or become a creator. Just don’t get bamboozled either way. Kirk’s got a point *if* you’re a sucker — but if you’re smart, you’ll game the system, not get played by it.

1le6l23,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1le6l23/pennys_playroom/,Penny's Playroom,"How many of you who grew up in Canada during the late 1990s/early 2000s remember that creepy children's show *Penny's Playroom*?

Not very many, I imagine; the show is incredibly obscure.  Almost no proof of its existence can be found on the internet.  No video clips, no still frames.  No mentions on old TV listings.  No Wikipedia or IMDb pages.  If it weren't for the online testimonies from people who watched the show as children, it would be easy to conclude that *Penny's Playroom* never existed at all.

But exist it did.  I remember it, and so do a few others, who turned to Reddit and other forums seeking proof that the show hadn't been some crazy fever dream.  Based on everyone's combined recollections, this is what is known about the show:

*Penny's Playroom* aired on a popular Canadian children's channel for about five years (c. 1997-c. 2002).  It was a blend of puppetry and live action and followed the adventures of Lillian, a little girl who would spend afternoons after school at her Gran's house while her parents were at work.  Now, tucked away at the back of the house was a long-neglected room that had once served as a playroom for Lillian's mother and uncles when they were kids.  Most of the toys had been packed up and stored away, but a few had been left behind.  These included the titular Penny, a rag doll with braided blonde pigtails and a red gingham dress; Nutmeg, a one-eyed teddy bear; Coco, a wooden monkey; Jack, a plastic sailor figurine; and Zippy, a wind-up mouse.  Other characters included Max and Amanda, Lillian's two best friends, and Mr. Whimsyflip, Nana's neighbour who was an inventor and who would often drop by the house to show Lillian his latest gadget.

All sounds pretty innocuous, right?  Well, not exactly.  If there's one thing us who remember *Penny's Playroom* can always agree on, it's that the show was deeply unsettling.  The puppets (*especially* Coco and Jack) looked as creepy as sin, but that was only the beginning.  Gran's house wasn't colourful and cheerful in its design, the way you'd expect the setting of a children's show to be.  Instead, it was dark, shabby, and gloomy.  The playroom itself looked more like an interrogation room than a place for children to play, with blank white walls, a cement floor, and no windows.  As for Gran herself, you never saw her face.  She always had her back turned to the audience... and to the other characters.  She never spoke, communicating through hand gestures and shaking or nodding her head.  And while she appeared to be played by a human actress, her movements were stiff and jerky like those of a malfunctioning animatronic, plunging her deep into the uncanny valley.

Adding to the weirdness was the nervous behaviour of the actors playing Lillian, Max, Amanda, and Mr. Whimsyflip.  They always seemed on edge, and this leaked into their acting.  Their lines often came out stilted and stuttered, their facial expressions appearing forced and strained.  One former viewer even described it as ""as if they were being held at knifepoint. Forced in front of the camera under the threat of violence.""

All those things combined created a show that was eerie at best and downright terrifying at worst in spite of its rather lighthearted premise and themes.  Throw in the show's overall poor quality and it's honestly a surprise that it managed to stay on air for half a decade.  During that time, though, it achieved no real popularity or success, and quickly faded into near-complete obscurity once it stopped airing.  No reruns were ever shown, nor were there ever any DVD releases.  The kids who had watched it grew up, and many of them forgot about it entirely.

But some did not.  Including myself.

I hadn't thought about *Penny's Playroom* in years.  But in my late teens, I developed a fascination with lost media and started a YouTube channel dedicated to the topic.  Through my research, I discovered that my home country of Canada had a lot of lost media, especially children's shows... and *Penny's Playroom* was among them.  Memories of that weird show came flooding back, and the discovery that it was completely lost with no real proof of its existence only amped up the creep factor.  I had recently decided that, for my channel's one-year anniversary, I would do a documentary series on lost Canadian children's shows, and now I wanted *Penny's Playroom* to be a part of it.

There was just one problem: I had nothing to work with.  Oh, there were the accounts from others who had seen the show, but those didn't count, as they didn't tell me anything I didn't already know.  I needed solid information.  Who had produced the show?  What were the names of the actors and puppeteers and what had they been doing since the show ended?  Where had the filming taken place? Why was the show so low-quality?  How had it managed to last as long as it did?

I decided that my best bet would be to appeal to the public for information.  I knew it was a long shot, but I made a video where I explained my plans to make a video about *Penny's Playroom* and requested that anyone who knew anything about the show or had any connection to it contact me.  I wouldn't disclose their name or any personal information; I just had some questions I wanted answered.

I didn't really expect it to work... but the very next day, I received an email from a woman who introduced herself as Emily Perret.  She said that she had worked on the show and would be glad to meet with me and tell me everything I wanted to know.  I was elated, but skeptical.  What were the chances that someone with such a direct connection to *Penny's Playroom* would see my video and contact me within such a small time frame?  But I agreed, figuring that, at worst, this would be a hoax and I would feel stupid.  I could deal with that.  Emily revealed that she lived in the same city as I did (Windsor, Ontario) so we agreed to meet at a local coffee shop.

I was sitting at a table near the back, sipping a vanilla latte, when a young woman (not much older than myself) walked in and approached me.  ""Natalie?""

Looking at her, I felt a jolt of recognition.  Red hair, though cut in a shoulder-length bob instead of falling in a sleek line down her back.  Big brown eyes.  Pale skin.  Round face sprinkled with freckles.  ""L-*Lillian*?""

""Well, I haven't been Lillian since I was a kid. But I guess that's what you'd know me by.""  She sat down across from me.  ""I rarely come across anyone who remembers *Penny's Playroom*. And honestly? I'm thankful for that.""

""What do you mean?"" I asked her.

Lillian (no, *Emily*) sighed.  ""It's not a time of my life I like to revisit.""

""I'm... sorry,"" I said stiffly.  ""I didn't mean to dredge up bad memories.""

She waved dismissively.  ""Hey, it's fine. If I didn't want to do this, I wouldn't have agreed to meet you. Listen, Natalie.""  She fixed her serious brown eyes on me.  ""I said I'd answer your questions, and I will. But it'd be for the best if you didn't include *Penny's Playroom* in your documentary series. Let it be forgotten.""

I frowned.  ""Why?""

""Hold on a sec. I need some coffee.""  Emily went to stand in line, and I got out the pen and notebook I had brought for taking notes.  My mind was a whirl of confusion.  Why did Emily not like talking about the show?  Why did she seem adamant I not include it in my documentary series?  It was a very long ten minutes before Emily returned, coffee in hand.

""Let me tell you about the show first,"" she said.

I uncapped my pen.  ""Shoot.""

She took a long sip of coffee, dabbed at her lips with a paper napkin.  ""As you know, I played Lillian. And Lillian's Gran... that was *my* grandmother playing her. The house was her house... and it's right here. In Windsor.""

I was shocked.  *Penny's Playroom* had been filmed right here in my hometown?

""It's not far from here,"" Emily continued.  ""Chances are you've driven past it and didn't even know it.""

""Maybe.""  I tapped my pen on the open page.  ""So how old were you when you started acting on the show?""

""Five,"" said Emily.  ""And I was about ten when it finally ended. Most shows would have replaced me, but Gran would never allow it. She was a control freak when it came to that show.""

""So she was the one behind it?""

""Yes.""

""But you didn't want to be on the show, did you?""

""No.""

""I'm sorry,"" I said, finally understanding why she always seemed so nervous.  ""What about the others?""

""The others?""

""Amanda. Max. Mr. Whimsyflip. Did *they* want to be on the show?""

""No. None of us did.""  Emily cast her eyes downward, looking sad.  ""I'm the only one left, you know.""

""Wait. They're *dead*?""

She didn't answer, but the silence told me everything I needed to know.

I hadn't even written anything down.  Suddenly, I was deeply uncomfortable with this whole situation and felt just terrible for Emily.  Something dark had taken place behind the scenes of *Penny's Playroom*, and while I was definitely curious, I felt that it wasn't my place to pry.

""Listen,"" I said to Emily.  ""We don't have to do this. I won't mention the show. I'll pretend this meeting never took place. But can you at least tell me the house's address? It might be cool to drive by. Just a quick peek. I won't take any pictures or tell anyone where it is.""

Emily bit her lip, hesitant, but then nodded and told me the address.  We shook hands, and then she stood and walk out of the coffee shop.

I lingered for a while, finishing my now-lukewarm coffee.  My encounter with Emily had left me far more unsettled than *Penny's Playroom* ever had... but my curiously burned bright.  I knew that I couldn't head home without seeing the house.  So I tossed my empty cup in the trash, headed out to my car, and drove to the address Emily had provided me.

The house in question was a grey Victorian with an apple tree in the front yard.  The curtains in every window were drawn, which was odd.  As I stared, though, the ones in the living room window twitched.  It was a blink-and-you'll-miss-it movement, but I knew I hadn't been mistaken.  My curiosity getting the better of me, I exited the car and began walking closer to get a better look.  I was halfway up the front path when the door opened, revealing Emily.

""Sorry!"" I said.  ""I didn't mean to... I'm sorry. I'll leave.""

""No, it's okay. Want to come in?""

I blinked.  ""Are you sure?""

""Yeah. Gran doesn't like guests, but she's taking her nap. As long as you stay quiet.""

I nodded and stepped inside.  The foyer was dark, with the musty smell of an old library.  I blinked a few times as my eyes adjusted... and yelped at the sight of the figure standing at the foot of the stairs.

""Sorry!"" I whispered.

Emily smiled.  ""Meet Coco.""

I didn't mention this before, but Coco was pretty big.  Almost two feet tall, with ball-jointed arms and legs and a long tail that dragged on the floor behind her.  Seeing her up close and personal, I was reminded of how creepy I found her as a kid.  It didn't help that she seemed to have undergone significant wear and tear in the years since the show.  Her right ear was missing, as was her left thumb, and her body was so splintery in places that it resembled tufts of hair.

""She's supposed to be in the play room,"" said Emily.  ""Looks like she got loose again.""  She picked Coco up and began moving deeper into the house.  With nothing better to do, I began to follow her.

As we walked through the house, I noted how dark it was and how neglected it looked, every surface thick with dust, cobwebs gathered in the corners like shadows.  Still, it was definitely the house from the show.  I recognized the worn brown couch in the living room, the painting of a barn on the wall.  When Emily came to a stop, it was at the very back of the house.  In front of a red door.

""Is this...""

She nodded.  ""Yes.""  And then she opened the door.

The playroom was just as I remembered from the show.  Dim, cold, and ugly, its only furnishings being an old toy box pushed up against the wall and a round plastic table in the centre, surrounded by plastic chairs.  In each chair sat a toy, and each of them looked as worn as Coco.  Penny's dress was threadbare and faded.  Both of Nutmeg's eyes were missing.  Jack's head looked caved in on one side, and Zippy had a large tear down his front, stuffing spilling out like guts.  Emily placed Coco in the one remaining empty chair, next to Penny.

As I stared at the odd scene before me, I noticed something.  Placed in the middle of the table were three round white objects.  The big one in the middle wore safety goggles, and the smaller ones wore a red baseball cap and a pink butterfly clip in a single patch of curly dark hair.  And each of them stared back at me with empty black sockets.

Mr. Whimsyflip.  Max.  Amanda.  Their *skulls* were arranged on the table in a grotesque centrepiece.

But before I could even begin to process the horror of what I was seeing, a shuffling noise had me whirling around, my heart slammed up into my throat hard enough to choke me.

My eyes landed on a pair of grey slippers peeking out beneath the hem of a blue housecoat.  My eyes slowly traveled up her body, sliding uncomprehendingly over the face and settling on the grey hair piled atop her head in a large bun before dropping to the face and staying there.

And I knew why the viewer never saw Nana's face.  Why she never spoke.

Stretching from her hairline to her sharp chin was a gaping hole.  There was no blood, no gore.  No exposed tissue or bone.  Just a dark pit yawning at me like the mouth of a cave.  As if her features had been scooped out cleanly with a giant ice cream scooper.

For a moment, the shock rendered me completely numb.  I could not move.  I could not speak.  I could not *think*.  Then panic hit me like a lightning bolt, and I screamed.

I ran.  I pushed past Gran and took off down the hall, shrieking all the way.  My heart pounded so hard it felt like it would burst, and my ears roared with adrenaline.  But underneath that noise, I heard sounds that scraped sharp, jagged claws over my bones.  Footsteps from feet made of wood and plastic and felt.  High-pitched, demented laughter.  And childish voices calling to me, asking me to stay and play, to join them in Penny's playroom.

I slammed out the door, dove into my car, and sped off.  In my state, I didn't even know if I was going in the right direction, and honestly, I didn't care.  As long as I got as far away from that place as possible.

I can't tell you how long I drove before the adrenaline wore off, but when it did, I pulled over and slumped over my steering wheel, trembling harder than I ever had in my life.  It was a long time before I could start moving again, and even longer before my heartbeat slowed to the point where I no longer felt like I was dying.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All that was seven years ago.

I never told anyone what happened.  I made my documentary series, but *Penny's Playroom* wasn't even so much as mentioned.  I did what I had promised Emily and pretended our meeting had never taken place.

To this day, I'm not sure what Emily's intentions were.  Did she lure me into that house with plans to do something terrible to me?  Make me suffer the same fate as Max and Amanda and Mr. Whimsyflip?  Or did she mean me no harm?  I guess I'll never know.  But it won't do me any good to dwell.  I escaped.  I survived.  I recovered from the trauma.  That's what matters.

So why am I posting my story here?  Why am I dredging this all up after staying silent for so long?

Well, you see, a good friend of mine went missing a couple of weeks ago.  We had met online, bonding over our shared fascination with lost media.  Based on what her brother told me when he called me in the hopes that I might know something about the disappearance, she left her apartment after telling her Mum through text that she had an ""appointment"" and never returned; all attempts to reach her had failed, and the police didn't seem too worried, seeing as she's a grown woman and left of her own volition.  But her family feared something terrible might have happened to her.

""You and my sister... you're both into lost media, right?"" her brother said.

""Yes,"" I told him.  ""Why?""

""Well, this is probably a red herring, but not long before her disappearance, she told me how she was looking into a lost children's show. And when I say lost I mean *lost*. It's so obscure its very existence is debated. We both remember watching it when we were kids, but I thought I had imagined it until my sister told me otherwise.""

I suddenly felt cold all over.  ""Is that so?""

""Yes.""

""And what's the show called? Do you know?""

""Yes. Maybe you've heard of it too. Maybe you even saw it yourself,"" said her brother.  ""It's called *Penny's Playroom*.""

**Prediction: ""The Lions Roar, the Bears Whimper (But at Least They’re Not the Tigers)""**

The Samsung Lions (-1.5, 1.77) are favored to stomp the Doosan Bears (2.8–2.9) harder than a Seoul subway rider steps on a pedestrian. With a **10.5-run total** (Even money), this could be a fireworks show or a snoozefest—Samsung’s offense is clicking like a well-oiled Hyundai engine, while Doosan’s pitching looks about as reliable as a fan trying to pick a KBO team on a dare.

**Key Props to Consider (If You’re Brave Enough):**

* **Moneyline**: Bet Samsung Lions at **1.41–1.43** (they’re the sports equivalent of a free coffee at Starbucks).
* **Spread**: Take Samsung -1.5 (**1.77–1.8**) if you trust a team that’s scored like a caffeinated golfer in a putting contest.
* **Doosan Bears +1.5**: **2.0–2.05** (only for masochists or those with a sports psychologist’s number saved).

**Why It’s a Laugh**: The Bears’ best shot? Stealing a few bases and hoping Samsung’s pitchers throw more wild pitches than a TikTok dance-off. Meanwhile, Samsung’s hitters might hit so many homers, the park could rename the outfield ""Doosan’s Despair.""

**Final Verdict**: Samsung wins **6-2**, the total goes **Under** (because even this mismatch needs a break), and Doosan’s manager gets a standing ovation for not quitting… yet.

*Bet responsibly, or don’t. The Bears aren’t exactly a money-maker either.* 🐅🦁️

1le6ihv,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1le6ihv/what_happens_at_the_end_im_exhausted/,What happens at the end? Im exhausted,"I (27M) am married and live a pretty stable life with my wife. My relationship with my father has always been complicated—he’s emotionally volatile, narcissistic, often racist, and dismissive of my lived experiences. He was born in 1968 in Medellín, Colombia, raised in an elite, upper-middle class military family on a massive coffee plantation. 

Think colonial-style wealth, pride, and superiority complex. My mom, on the other hand, came from extreme poverty in Bogotá. Honestly, I think she married him for stability, but still treats him like a child. He lives rent-free in her house in the U.S. now, and she enables his behavior to this day.

He lost all his money due to mismanagement and just being a jerk. Now hes broke, and living in his ex wifes house. All his money, busines, gone. He never helped pay for my college, nothing.

 My dad moved to the U.S. in 2000 when I was 2. Since then, he's had a superiority complex about everything—idolizing whiteness, the U.S., denying racism exists, and constantly gaslighting me. Every time I bring up my trauma or critique the system here, he mocks me, calls me paranoid, or says it's all fake.

To give you an idea of how dismissive he is of my reality: I was recently harassed by a maintenance worker in my apartment complex. The guy followed me to my door, yelling at me aggressively, invading my space, and at one point shouted, “I know where you live.” I felt threatened and shaken. 

When I told my dad about it—hoping for concern, or at least acknowledgment—he just shrugged and said, “Oh, you probably misunderstood him. Maybe he was just being friendly.” That’s the level of delusion I’m dealing with. He completely minimizes anything that doesn’t fit his version of reality. No concern. No empathy. Just gaslighting. i dont even know why i keep telling him things.

On Father’s Day. It started with him screaming at me on the phone for waking up late (I have insomnia, which he knows, and struggles with himself). Then he switched to being overly bubbly and happy when we went out to eat, got drunk, and started rambling loudly in public. Eventually, our conversation turned serious—he brought up the family’s plans to move to Spain, which led me to share my frustrations about life in America and my reasons for wanting to move to a more peaceful, well-developed Asian country (my wife country)

He immediately shut me down, praised America in a weird, nationalistic rant, and called all other countries ""backwards""—even though he’s visited the country I want to move to multiple times and has even said he wanted to retire there. He said racist things, denied school violence and drugs exist in the U.S., and basically blamed me for my own trauma.

But here’s where it got really weird.

When we got back in the car, I told him how I want to live honestly and spiritually, and how my wife and I are building something real. I brought up how I talk to my therapist about the damage he’s done. He had nothing to say. I asked basic questions and he just… stared off into space.

 Silent. Then he started repeating the same phrase over and over: “There is none. There is none.” Like a robot. He ignored me and my wife. It was the most eerie, unsettling thing I’ve ever seen. He wasn’t drunk anymore—he was disassociated. Blank. Gone.


When I dropped him off, he hugged us both without saying anything and walked away. Just completely... empty.

Now I’m sitting here thinking: what the hell was that?

Is he:

Having a cognitive breakdown? Early dementia?

Emotionally collapsing because he’s losing control over me?

Ashamed but incapable of apologizing or showing real emotion?

Just... faking his ""niceness"" and now the mask is slipping?

I was crying im so tired.

He’s still trying to be involved in my life. Calls maybe once a week. Tries to act normal. But I’m done pretending. I don’t think I can take care of him when he’s older. I think he’s going to get worse. I don’t want him ruining my peace or manipulating my wife into putting a business under her name.

Unlike my mom who's not in my life at all, he still reaches out about ince weekly and acts very happy as if life is perfect..one wrong move and he will punish me and treat me terribly and gaslight me and blame me for everything.

My mom when I was a kid let her boyfriend beat me until bloody and she would laugh and side with him. I haven't forgiven her for that. My mom as a kid used to steal my money amd open credit cards using my SSN. Now, she doesn't do any of that, she's just aloof with her drunk bf watching sports every single day.

I’m scared. I’m angry. And I’m tired.

What the hell is this behavior? Has anyone else seen this in their narcissistic parents? What happens next? What is the prognosis with someone like this?

How do they die in the end?

I dont wanna be his age and dealing with a angry old man. I wanna be free. But letting go is tough.

**THE PIVOT**

“Let’s fire everyone,” says Sam.

“Er,” says Davis. “Um. Well, that’s certainly one way to do things.” It’s 9:30 AM. He’s had two espressos today already.

“I’m serious. We have to face facts. We need a hard reset. A clean slate.”

Davis paces the conference room restlessly. The glass is frosted up to 6 feet, which means all his employees know when their CEO is having a tough meeting because they see the top of his hair bobbing back and forth, like a worried, sentient toupee.

“Look, I appreciate the radical runway extension. But even if we were down to a skeleton crew of, I don’t know,” Davis sighs, mentally counting personnel, and mentally assigning himself the work of three normal engineers. “Five people, say, to keep the product running. We’re not going to grow our way out of this if we have no one to sell, or build, or—”

“We cannot sell this shit, Davis.” Sam drops his voice, to sound more serious. Sam is Davis’ chief-of-staff. He is only 22, and he still sounds 22. He is also 6’3”, super handsome, a New Englander from his blonde hair down to his boat shoes. He alternates between weeks of consuming nothing but protein bars and energy drinks and Eastern European snuff films, and weeks of monastic purity, eating handfuls of nuts and taking punishing cold showers. His appearance speaks of well-groomed power. But he doesn’t have any power, of course. Davis has power. Sam has always approached Davis with a reverent, intensely earnest posture, and Davis would be lying if he said this didn’t bring him some real gratification.

So this harsh statement, coming from Sam, is enough to stop Davis in his tracks. “Tom’s numbers are still good,” he says woodenly.

“Tom. Is not replicable. And Tom will back me up on this. Honestly, Davis, he’s interviewing at Square.”

“What?” Davis sits down very heavily. This is a serious loss. Tom is the VP of Zuby’s small sales team, and also their top salesperson, and the only person who has been able to sell manufacturers on Zuby in any serious quantity. “Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.”

“Look, man, you know I admire the fuck out of you,” Sam says, all sweetness again. “And I think the worst case scenario for you, and for me! Like, being honest here. Is that Q3 numbers are just good enough to keep going, and then Q4 is good, because Q4, and organic gingerbread or whatever, and then we raise a fucking terrible Series C, like a down round or something, and then you and me are stuck doing something that is fundamentally doomed for another 2 years. And then we shut down. Like, psychic damage, you know?”

Davis is resisting the urge to slam his head into the conference room table. He ponders if his skull could break it. The table is glass, covered in a rainbow holographic treatment, and left over from the office’s previous tenants, a failed anime porn company. He bought it from them in the spirit of thrift for $150.

“Look, I have something to pitch you.”

Davis doesn’t respond right away. He is retracing his steps, from the first spark of inspiration to the first customer interviews to the first pitch, looking for a flaw in his work, trying to figure out what small or large mechanism he can tinker with to make this thing work. This is what is most lovable about Davis— his megawatt attention, shackled firmly to his stubborn, irrational heart.

“Okay, go,” Davis says finally, with a sigh.

Had any other Zuby employee been in the room to hear his pitch, they’d probably throw Sam’s purple bottle of Future Freeze Prime at his head.

\~\*\~

Davis Budny is Zuby’s founder and CEO. He is 28, and all that everyone feels a young man should be. He is possessed of two funding rounds, technical skills both broad and current, vision and verve, an attractively furnished apartment, thick brown hair, and a three-legged rescue cat. Until 26 he sported slightly below average looks compensated for by his reedy, 6’2” height, but two years ago he discovered he could grow very flattering facial hair, and much was remedied by this.

Davis likes to make people happy. His mother is a history professor; his father was a software engineer. Davis’ teachers often said he was “raised right.” By this, they likely meant that despite being remarkably, remarkably smart, Davis never seemed lazy nor arrogant. This is because Davis is neither lazy nor arrogant. On the contrary, Davis is born of Polish peasant stock on both sides and has all the work ethic of his ancestors, and a great willingness to think himself ordinary.

He did suspect at a young age that he might have a special sort of brain. He often pictured his own brain as a plodding draft horse, head down, muscles straining. Cleverer students would listen to lectures at 2x; Davis was pausing so often he basically listened at .5x. But after a certain amount of heavy pondering, he would find that he had internalized the lesson so deeply that he could suddenly slingshot far ahead, rushing past the current state of the field. Later, a VC would tell him that he really thought “from first principles,” a compliment Davis earnestly cherished until he realized the investor told everybody that.

Zuby is Davis’ second company. He doesn’t like to talk about the first, because of the dogs, which were truly not his fault! And likely already aggressive and badly trained. Unfortunately the dogs made him a bit of a Silicon Valley punchline for a few years, which caused his natural brilliance to go under-recognized. Luckily, with his usual inherent wisdom, Davis humbly retreated to a quiet enterprise software company hidden in the waystation of San Jose, and their eventual IPO gave him both $2.7m in long-term capital gains and enough courage to try again.

There are 38 employees at Zuby (54 if you count contractors, which the team normally does not). 9 of these employees like Davis, 23 feel neutrally, and 6 employees think he is a moron and/or jerk. A 16% malcontent rate is actually very good for a series B company. Too good, some of the investors say. “Soft on people,” they say.

It’s true that despite being blessed with above average salaries, a top-tier health insurance plan, and a generous CEO who carries the gentle air of apology that all software engineers educated at liberal arts colleges share, the employees of Zuby are garrulous, dissatisfied, and prone to spending hours agitating each other to mutiny in secretive Slack channels with names like Thursday-committee and Zuby-cozy-gamers. Half the company thinks the company is going under. Half the company thinks capitalism should be replaced. Most of the company thinks Davis could be doing a better job and no grouping more permanent than 2 individuals on a coffee date for 30 min can agree on what he should be doing differently.

Among those of the 38 who will bother to reminisce on this brief, clumsy brio of human ambition coalesced into a b2b commerce platform, this particular day, August 5th, will stand in infamy. Pivot Day, they’ll call it, or, the day Davis lost his fucking mind.

\~\*\~

“Has he lost his fucking mind,” Rishi intones. “You have to be kidding me. A digital grocery store?”

“I am not kidding,” Samantha hisses, trying to keep her voice down. “You have to help me talk him out of it.”

“No, fuck him,” Rishi exclaims. “I’m not going to waste my time talking him out of it. Goddamnit, I have to start applying for jobs. Tom has the right idea here. We gotta get out.”

“Noo…no, no, no, no, no,” Samantha pleads. “Rishi, I’m only telling you this because he trusts you. So much! Like, he respects you so, so much! And I honestly think this plan is just a good wake-up call that we need to rethink the core business.”

“Uh, yeah, if by rethink you mean evacuate yesterday.” Rishi has turned his chair away from Samantha and back to his second screen. He’s on LinkedIn already. He grimaces, unhappy with what he sees. Rishi Balakrishnan is on the older side for Zuby, a septuagenarian at 35. Davis wanted an older CTO, someone who had scaled a SaaS product before, but who wouldn’t chafe under his habit of nervous micromanagement. Rishi is temperate and wise indeed, as you would be too if you had two sweet daughters and a hefty Redwood City mortgage riding on your job, but Zuby has never found enough customers to make Rishi’s experience all that relevant.

Samantha groans under her breath and adjusts the perfect waves in her black hair out of nervous habit. She is Zuby’s COO, and until Sam’s arrival 9 months ago, she was Davis’ closest confidante and the biggest influence on his thinking. She is 30, and generally perceived by Zuby employees as one of the two “adults” in the room (Rishi being the other). The two have formed an alliance of reasonableness. They arrive early for the weekly C-suite leadership meetings and decide ahead of time which of the two will be the calm one and which of the two will entertain Davis’ increasingly panicked ideas to Save The Company.

Samantha Kim’s resume is sterling, even better than Davis’. She went to Yale, worked at Bain, went to the GSB, then worked at Facebook. In other words, she is a coward. She joined Zuby because of an alleged passion for small organic food businesses. It’s true that while at Facebook, she made 750 granola bars and thought about starting a small organic food business. But ultimately she gave them away at a church bake sale and joined Zuby instead.

Davis is not an idiot. His natural loyalty is to Samantha, who has been invaluable to Davis in a million small ways and a few critical big ones. He is also aware despite all the self-professed admiration, Sam shit-talks him often to friends from Twitter. Whereas Davis has the strong but unprovable impression that Samantha never could, even in the unknowable intimacy of Samantha’s own home, with her husband who grilled Davis at last year’s Christmas party and seemed profoundly unimpressed. Samantha is loyal, like Davis. But she is also scared, and increasingly Davis has no use for anyone who is scared.

“What are you going to say to him at steering?” Samantha asks Rishi dully.

“Does he know you told me?” Rishi asks.

“Um, I don’t really care either way, but I’m sure he’ll kick off the meeting by pitching us so...” Samantha feels a perverse sort of excitement for this momentous upcoming meeting. She is by nature fearful of confrontation, but even she has been aching for relief after months of quiet tension in the office.

“The Sams must have it out,” Meghan, an ops associate, likes to joke. “Winner keeps their job.”

“No, loser has to stay here,” her friend Ethan likes to add.

\~\*\~

Okay, let me tell you really quick what Zuby does. Zuby is a specialty food distributor masquerading as a tech company. The company aggregates cool organic/healthy/indie/up-and-coming food brands and tries to distribute them to stores, like coffee shops and shabby organic grocers from Ojai to Highland Park. The dream would be getting major grocery stores to sign up— Samantha has been personally hounding the buyers at Whole Foods, for instance.

Merchants want cool snacks to sell. Cool snack companies want to be on shelves. Cool snack makers (hands full of organic granola) don’t have the money or time for sales. Two-sided marketplace, aggregate the long tail, ride a macro trend, ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom, $200m valuation. That’s where the problem started.

The problem, they discovered, is that no one big will pay for it. The sales team, which by necessity has included Samantha, Sam and Davis himself, has met two types of customers. The first is an extended cousin of their own white-collar, PMC peer group. The college-educated real estate guy who opened a cool coffee shop, the ex-engineer who now makes protein biscuits. They get it, they love it, they sign up for Zuby, then they go out of business rapidly.

Or, if they succeed and stay in the business, they slowly morph into customer type two: a grizzled food guy, a low-margin hustler, bags under their eyes and Zyn in their mouth, uninterested in discussing the future and more interested in discussing whether Zuby will offer a subsidized rate on refrigerated trucking (they will not). They don’t want to pay, they’re constantly trying to sneak business off the platform, they trudge up to the Zuby booth at trade shows and swill the free coffee with cynical, deadened eyes before asking about discounts. “You’ll be out of business soon, right,” they always ask, possibly because all they think about every morning is the dark siren call of the void (closing the business and taking a nap).

This is an energizing, fixable challenge for Samantha. This is vaguely concerning background noise to Rishi (who Davis and Samantha gently shield from these realities, as they feel a good CTO deserves). The stagnation is a daily, skull-bruising, brain-shattering pain for Davis.

But he still can’t bring himself yet to really see Zuby as it is. Behind every half-assed feature he sees the long and arduous compromise to make it exist; every problem speaks only of its possible solutions. But the truth is that Sam the carpetbagger is right. Zuby is hopelessly overvalued. Zuby is going nowhere. Zuby is a wounded, bewildered beast, overfed and huge-bellied, mournful and whipped on all sides to move with speed of which it is no longer capable, to a destination no one can identify. Keen observers regard it with distaste and compassion. Secretly its two largest investors agree it needs to be put down.

\~\*\~

“What do you think they’re doing in there,” Ethan asks Meghan. He twitches a pen nervously between his fingers.

“I don’t think you should be so emotionally invested in their meetings,” Meghan says primly. She is generating an internal report on merchant churn. She and Ethan sit across from each other habitually, and have spent almost a thousand hours in conversation with each other, but only forty-two of those hours have involved direct eye contact. They prefer to keep two laptop screens, twenty-five inches of white desk, and a task and a half between themselves. In one sense, they are best friends. There is no one the other has spoken to more in the past two years. In another sense, neither knows the other’s middle name.

“I think Sam is going to join,” Ethan forecasts dourly, as he does every week. Sam’s inclusion in the occasional steering meeting is a real thorn in Ethan’s side. Ethan is a young, high energy engineer who does half of Rishi’s work and most of everyone else’s. Ethan is also burdened with the CTO’s private, end-of-week grumblings. After Meghan’s own downloads from Samantha, Ethan and Meghan like to go for a beer and piece together the complaints into a increasingly dire picture of their employer’s health.

“You cannot honestly be jealous that he takes notes in meetings,” Meghan says. She is a natural peace-keeper, a real Libra. Her great talent is that she can peaceably digest literally anything the execs want to say—dire pronouncements, declarations of defeat, 2AM podcast links— with placid gentleness and produce eight hours later some internal memo or deck that soothes their inflamed hearts. Ethan attributes this preternatural calm to Meghan’s one great hobby, running marathons. He imagines that she just sweats out all the resentment and pinprick-sharp anxiety that animates him all day. Ethan does not run marathons, he does not even rock climb or urban bike. He has no time, as he is always working.

“He’s an assistant,” Ethan grumbles. “A glorified assistant that for some reason thinks he’s better than me. I swear to god if he has 1%…”

“Oh my god, Ethan,” Meghan sighs. “I am not checking Carta for you.”

“I think he’s gay,” Ethan continues conspiratorially. “Which is fine!” He hurriedly clarifies, as Meghan finally looks up from her laptop with admonishments ready. “It’s obviously fine! But it’s hypocritical, with his politics.”

“Okay, I actually heard from Lucy that her roommate went to Dartmouth with him. And—”

What gossip or defense Meghan could provide was lost to time. At that very moment Sam pushes back from his standing desk (”Sitting is bad for testosterone levels,” he says) and enters the steering meeting.

Ethan lets out a muffled yelp of indignation and gets nothing else done that afternoon. He’ll have to stay late instead.

\~\*\~

It’s 3PM. Inside the conference room, Sam sits on one side of the table, with Rishi and Samantha on the other. As if it’s an arbitration, Davis sits at the head of the table between them. He drinks a third espresso.

“What is a digital grocery store… Like, Instacart?” Samantha asks slowly.

Sam responds, “No, the food is digital!”

Rishi chuckles.

Sam continues, “So users scan the code on the box. It gives them, like, say, 3 FoodCoin, right? More expensive food, or promotions… we can adjust on the backend how many FoodCoin you get!”

Samantha’s hands dig into the side of her laptop so hard that her fingertips turn white.

Rishi says, “So it’s crypto Boxtops?”

Sam leaps up while everyone else remains seated. “Yes! Dude, that’s such a good line.”

Samantha speaks slowly, mentally patting the floor around her in search of the sanity that seems to have been dropped fifteen minutes ago. “Ok, look. Crypto is kind of controversial. Some VC’s still like it, but—”

Rishi’s curiosity is irrepressible. Also, at this point, he has already decided to find a new job. “What is the FoodCoin for?”

Sam paces the room like Davis does. “That’s the best part. So you take the FoodCoin and bring it to ZubyMart. And you get digital food.” This phrase seems to break something in Samantha, who turns her laptop on its side and starts chewing her knuckles.

Rishi asks, “But what is the digital food for?”

Sam shrugs. “I don’t know, it’s like a collectible, or maybe we make a game?”

“Maybe we make a game?!” Samantha thunders. Even Sam’s eyes grow a little wider. No one at Zuby has seen her like this. Some long-buried gorge is rising in her throat and her eyes spark with new power. “Davis, you cannot possibly be considering this. A pivot at this stage is crazy enough, but…This! Is not even! A reasonable pivot!”

All eyes turn towards Davis. He is seated at the head of the dead ex-tenant’s rainbow conference table, his fingers tented and his gaze pointed at no one in the room. His out-of-character silence amidst the chaos gives him a new, ominous air. Who is this guy, Rishi and Samantha think.

“It’s time to be building,” Sam says.

“We’ve been building!” Samantha shrieks. “You are not even—Rishi, please!”

Rishi shrugs.

“Please,” Samantha says. “Davis! Come on! This is not, like, responsible behavior.”

More thoughtful silence.

“Why aren’t you saying anything!”

\~\*\~

Here’s what happened with Davis’ first company. In college, Davis studied electrical engineering and computer science. Studying both is actually pretty rarefied. You might think you know a lot of “software engineers” who can make a website, but you probably don’t know many genuine *computer scientists.* Davis is the real fucking deal. He invented a protocol that uses sound waves to transmit data. It had been done a few times before, but Davis’ method was the best. Longest distances, worked on really, really old devices, and he packaged it up into the most beautiful, foolproof dev kit. He wanted to use it in disaster zones, Third World countries, places with no wi-fi or phone service. He thought maybe he could be a missionary like his great-grandfather, but with connectivity.

His professor convinced him to explore point-of-sale instead—paying phone-to-phone. He dropped out. They raised a seed round. Professor was chairman of the board, Davis was the CEO and the face. Of course this made it easy for the professor to throw Davis under the bus when things went south.

Long story short, apparently the sounds, although inaudible to human ears, drove dogs insane. There were nine bite incidents and three dogs got put down. One bit a kid at Coupa Cafe. Honestly, how could Davis have known? Of course there weren’t dogs roaming around EE lab during testing. The problem was even fixable, but the PR was not. When Davis was first introduced to Sam, Sam told Davis he thought Wavely had been treated totally unfairly, and three very large beers later Davis was sorrowfully agreeing. “I could have fixed it! I just needed like two months.”

“Yes,” Sam had hissed. “Imagine holding up human progress over a dog.” These were suspicious dogs, after all! Smooth-headed, big-skulled pitbulls, bred in backyards and relinquished over and over until they found a home with some soft-hearted oat-milk drinker who blamed Davis for what was probably inevitable!

And ever since, Davis has been trying to win back the industry’s love, been trying to redeem himself. He shouldn’t need to. What have all these hecklers ever built? That’s what Sam said, anyway.

\~\*\~

“Uh, so, should I start architecting this? What protocol do you want to use?”

“Do all the brands have the same Coin or is it like, one coin per brand?”

“Does this mean I can stop fixing tickets?”

“Am I going to be fired?”

Such were the unenlightened questions that mid-level and senior-level employees had as Samantha called them into the room one-by-one, like a late afternoon death march, throwing bodies desperately as random bullet spray in an attempt to win her case. Her fingers are flying across her keyboard as she messages people, arms them with talking points and supportive emojis before they come in.

Samantha’s plan is this. First off, she knows Davis is not that good at firing people. She figures if she makes him look everyone in the eye—especially the mid-level managers he most trusts—there’s no way he’s going to go through with this insane crypto pivot bullshit.

Secondly, she’s counting on every person who’s consulted to agree that, in fact, the idea is bullshit. A Zuby employee is a very timid creature, actually. They are afraid of getting yelled at. They don’t want anything to be “their fault”. They like consensus. They like actionable plans. They love a puzzle with a 7 out of 10 difficulty. Zuby has steadily provided a stream of 7/10 difficulty puzzles—how to scrape together a list of the fastest growing CPG brands in California, how to make nice UI if every single food category has different tags and specifications, how to de-conflict inventory data across multiple warehouses. The collective deal Zuby employees have made with Davis is that he gets to point them at any 7/10 difficulty puzzle in the world, and they’ll solve it. Just watch them. They’re lean, whip-smart intellectual thoroughbreds ready to run. But in exchange, Davis must promise that great riches are contingent on this specific set of 7/10 puzzles. Obviously Davis has broken the deal. Zuby has not. This is how Samantha sees things.

Of course, it’s chaos outside that conference room. Tom, one of the first to be called in, is a medium-level gossiper but a very good boss, and after grimly delivering his verdict—”Yeah, this isn’t working”—he gathers his lieutenants around him to share the dire news of a looming pivot. They sit on the giant carpeted blocks of the building’s lobby, grim-faced as GIs staring at Normandy. “How many layoffs, you think?” one salesman asks Tom. “Deep cuts,” Tom replies. “I’m gonna warn my friend.” “You do you.”

By 4:15PM, approximately 97% of Zuby’s staff is aware that their CEO is contemplating a massive change in the business (1 employee is on maternity leave). No one is working. Clique-ish huddles have formed. One daring young employee is writing ideas on a whiteboard, in case Davis asks him what he thinks the company should do next. Beers are being passed around. A storm brews outside in the blue twilight, making the florescence of the office look even brighter, almost beautiful. It feels like the last day of school.

Meghan steps outside to get some air. In her pocket, her phone buzzes non-stop. It’s always a jarring transition, where the clean white marble of their building’s lobby stops, and the urine-soaked concrete outside begins. A summer storm is coming, the air warm and sticky and disgusting. She leans against the building’s red brick wall. It’s 5PM, and slackers and South Bay commuters are beginning to trickle out of the offices around them. They’re identified by shirts, fleeces, messenger bags, all bearing the name of their tribe. Megan ticks off names as they pass—goodnight DataCat, goodnight Surmisely, goodnight Airpoint. They are unaware of one of their number laying inside on the operating table, chest open.

Meghan tries to picture losing her job. For a moment it’s as surreal as stepping into an alternate universe, and in the next moment it’s utterly quotidien. What is she freaking out about? She can go to grad school. She can write that book. Take time off, travel. Her parents pay her rent. She goes back inside.

\~\*\~

By 7PM the office is mostly empty, and even Ethan has given up eavesdropping and waiting. Davis, Sam and Samantha, and Rishi (though he is mostly playing games on his phone at this point) remain holed up in the conference room. Empty cups and cans overflow from the unlined trash bin. A pizza sits untouched on the table.

“No one thinks this is a good idea,” Samantha is insisting.

“Look, this is ultimately on me, okay?” Davis says, rubbing his temples. He hasn’t had any food all day. “It’s my neck on the line. I want to try it.”

“Everyone works here,” Samantha says acidly. “Not just you.”

“Well, yes, but for them it’s a job. For me…I’m the one who raised the money. I—I don’t mean this in an egotistical way, but we have to bet on my intuition here, right?”

“And your intuition is we should make cheddar snacks into crypto bets?”

“I mean, look, it’s a seed. It’s exciting! It’s got—”

“If you say vibes right now, I’m going to kill you.”

Sam snorts. Samantha shoots him a glare.

“Why? What’s wrong with vibes?” Davis says. “Why shouldn’t we just follow vibes instead of…”

“Instead of business plans, adult logic…”

Sam jumps in. “Okay, don’t be offended, Samantha, but I think…” He hesitates, or pretends to hesitate. “I think consultant thinking is how we got here to begin with.”

At this point Samantha, who is missing her niece’s birthday dinner, grabs Sam’s Prime and throws it against the wall. Rishi yelps in alarm as it passes him by.

“Jesus Christ, calm down!”

“You are so fucking disrespectful,” Samantha yells, yelling for possibly the first time since she’s been working at Zuby. “What do you know about food?”

“Or crypto,” Rishi comments idly, thumbs twitching away. “It’s gnarly in there right now.”

“I don’t need to know about food,” Sam shoots back. “I know about the meta. And this is the move.”

“This is nonsense!”

“This,” Davis says with great finality. “Is what is happening.”

This morning? Pure chaos. The kind of chaos that makes you question your life choices before coffee.

So, it rained last night. My kids, filled with the kind of energy that can only come from cartoons and fruit snacks, ran outside the moment the clouds cleared. I swear, they were out there for maybe 45 seconds before the screaming started—the dramatic, blood-curdling kind usually reserved for haunted houses and sibling betrayals.

They come barreling back inside yelling, “SNAKES! TWO SNAKES! FROM THE TREE!” And I? I transformed. No pants. No caffeine. Just me, a half-soggy sleep shirt, and a Swiffer mop. Instant warrior mode. I kicked open the side door like I was auditioning for The Walking Dead: Suburban Snake Edition.

And there they were. Two serpentine demons, clearly plotting the downfall of mankind, entwined like some kind of cursed friendship bracelet, lying in the grass. I charged like a sleep-deprived gladiator, flailing my Swiffer like it was Thor’s hammer—but with way less effectiveness and much more static cling.

Meanwhile, my neighbor is standing calmly with his dog, watching what can only be described as an unhinged woman in a pajama top performing interpretive dance with a mop.

I’m yelling “SNAKESSSS!!!” like I’m in a low-budget action film, and he—bless him—has the audacity to ask, “Everything okay over there?”

Sir. Do I look okay?

Anyway, after about five dramatic mop smashes, I realize… nothing is moving. No angry hissing. No slithering. Just two very unbothered “snakes.”

So I squint (still no caffeine, mind you), lean in… and right on cue, his dog trots over, grabs the “snakes,” and proudly returns to his owner.

My neighbor, now clearly trying not to laugh, says, “Yeah… those are just my dog’s rope toys.”

My kids picked the exact moment he threw it to decide to go outside, and voilà: suburban horror movie.

So now I’ve got grass in my hair, Swiffer battle fatigue, and the local reputation of being That Neighbor Who Attacks Dog Toys Before Breakfast.

I looked out the window,  
Rain hittin’ the glass,

TV’s on mute,  
But my mind won’t quit  
Runnin’ back to you.

Tried to move on,  
But I keep lookin’ back.

Puts me off track.  
You were the calm,  
You were the spark—  
Now it’s just me  
Alone in the dark.

I looked out the window,  
Saw pieces of us,  
In the light, in the sky,  
In the back of a bus.  
I’m still here,  
Still stuck in the blue—  
Yeah, I looked out the window,  
And all I saw was you.

*(Verse 2)*  
I walked through the city,  
Heard your laugh in the crowd,  
But it faded too quick,  
Like smoke in a cloud.  
I talk like I’m fine,  
But that ain’t true,  
Every ""I’m okay""  
Still leads back to you.

*(Pre-Chorus)*  
I keep on scrollin’  
Past your old face,  
Thinkin’ ’bout nothin’  
But that time and place.  
You were the light,  
You were the flame—  
Now it’s just silence  
When I call your name.

*(Chorus)*  
I looked out the window,  
Saw pieces of us,  
In the light, in the sky,  
In the back of a bus.  
I’m still here,  
Still stuck in the blue—  
Yeah, I looked out the window,  
And all I saw was you.

*(Bridge)*  
Maybe we broke,  
Maybe that’s life,  
Maybe I should’ve  
Put up more fight.  
But if you ever wonder  
If I still care—  
Just know I still see you  
Everywhere.

*(Final Chorus)*  
I looked out the window,  
Like I always do,  
Still chasing shadows  
That look like you.  
I’m still here,  
Still feeling it too—  
Yeah, I looked out the window…  
And all I saw was you.",1,1750214041.0,Songwriters,0,1.0,False

This morning? Pure chaos. The kind of chaos that makes you question your life choices before coffee.

So, it rained last night. My kids, filled with the kind of energy that can only come from cartoons and fruit snacks, ran outside the moment the clouds cleared. I swear, they were out there for maybe 45 seconds before the screaming started—the dramatic, blood-curdling kind usually reserved for haunted houses and sibling betrayals.

They come barreling back inside yelling, “SNAKES! TWO SNAKES! FROM THE TREE!” And I? I transformed. No pants. No caffeine. Just me, a half-soggy sleep shirt, and a Swiffer mop. Instant warrior mode. I kicked open the side door like I was auditioning for The Walking Dead: Suburban Snake Edition.

And there they were. Two serpentine demons, clearly plotting the downfall of mankind, entwined like some kind of cursed friendship bracelet, lying in the grass. I charged like a sleep-deprived gladiator, flailing my Swiffer like it was Thor’s hammer—but with way less effectiveness and much more static cling.

Meanwhile, my neighbor is standing calmly with his dog, watching what can only be described as an unhinged woman in a pajama top performing interpretive dance with a mop.

I’m yelling “SNAKESSSS!!!” like I’m in a low-budget action film, and he—bless him—has the audacity to ask, “Everything okay over there?”

Sir. Do I look okay?

Anyway, after about five dramatic mop smashes, I realize… nothing is moving. No angry hissing. No slithering. Just two very unbothered “snakes.”

So I squint (still no caffeine, mind you), lean in… and right on cue, his dog trots over, grabs the “snakes,” and proudly returns to his owner.

My neighbor, now clearly trying not to laugh, says, “Yeah… those are just my dog’s rope toys.”

My kids picked the exact moment he threw it to decide to go outside, and voilà: suburban horror movie.

So now I’ve got grass in my hair, Swiffer battle fatigue, and the local reputation of being That Neighbor Who Attacks Dog Toys Before Breakfast.

At least I didn’t spill my coffee.
Oh wait—I didn’t have coffee.",12,1750213978.0,Mommit,2,1.0,False

Ever since we found out, my girlfriend has acted so different. She acts like I have glass bones and paper skin. We're both very touchy people, and we used to cuddle all the time. Every night she'd fall asleep basically on top of me. Now she'll apologize if she accidentally rests her arm on me. 

She also doesn't let me take care of her anymore. Before, I made her breakfast and coffee every morning, packed her a lunch, and made dinner. I love treating her like a princess. But she won't let me anymore. I hate her taking care of me. Most days I can't even get out of bed, so I kind of understand why she takes care of me. But I just miss her being herself. She seems so down lately, I really feel like it's my fault.

Anyway, this kind of just turned into a very sad rant. But how do I make her treat me like she used to? Or is that even possible? I don't know if I have much time left, I really don't want to spend my last few months being treated like I can't do anything. Even though I really can't.

To cut to the chase, he was installing two rooms of crown molding in what is commonly called a ""2 piece"" (basically a flat board to increase the profile then followed by the crown). He invited me into one of the rooms to see how it looked as I was trying to stay away from hovering and/or interfering. As I looked around the room all looked okay until I caught that in a blank space above the first piece in which he wrote the date, the name of his firm and then the words: ""XXXX IS A MORON"". Now XXXX here is the name of a U.S. President.   

Now I am not going to say if it is our current president or a former one as that should not be germane to the issue (but since it will be asked by Redditors, the name was of a president I support/supported). I did not say anything to the contractor as I feared him by this point.  He was virtually finished, and this was one of the last pieces to nail in.  The second piece of crown molding hides the words. But it is killing me up inside. I should not have been a coward and asked him to remove it, but I didn't. I was afraid of the confrontation and just wanted him out. But I can’t live with this so I either must hire someone else, ask a family member to help me out or insist he come back.  And I question if he did this at other points along the way but I only saw the last scribbles.  I want those words that I did see under the molding gone.  I do not mind him signing his work with the date (or even writing something silly like “Kilroy was here""). But it is the political statement he felt he could make that infuriates me.  He crossed a boundary. I feel violated.

I want to add there was absolutely no discussion of politics or divisive issues. I offered a cup of coffee, turned on the air conditioning to make it comfortable to work and discussed a common hobby for a bit before he started his work. I paid a hefty sum for his and his sons 3 hours of work and there are a few quality issues. But it is the passive-aggressive and boundary crossing that is the issue here.  I am considering writing to him to see if he would like to offer a solution and most importantly, an apology.  I anticipate it will not go well.

So, Reddit what do you think?  Should I just go ahead and post negative reviews or give him a chance to do the right thing and sincerely apologize to me?  He will absolutely know it is me posting the review and I must admit I fear doing that as well.

I seriously cannot believe that as a nation we have sunk this low. Until now, the political landscape, while very, very important to me, suddenly turned personally vicious and hit close to home. I now know more than ever that we have crossed a point of no return.

Background info: we've been friends for about two years now, and we've visited each other's houses, but only once each. I'd say that we're ""close"", but we don't really hang out that much besides in our shared extracurricular (band). I'd want the outing to be something interesting enough that it makes sense to invite him out to randomly, so things like coffee or a hike probably wouldn't work that well. A movie might work, but I don't know a lot about his tastes in movies, and there's nothing that interesting out right now that we haven't already watched seprately. He has some social anxiety stuff as well, so a place with too many people or relative overwhelming behavior wouldn't work (public places are fine, I'm just talking places like fairgrounds and clubs probably would be a bad idea).

* Then, when cutting boards oversize 3/4in-1in  just a bit to compensate down the line for both the head section and handle section. Also making sure they meet the thickness wanted
* Mark grain direction 
* Glue boards up in individual sections for both head section and handle section. Let dry for 24 hours.
* Scrape off excess glue.
* While boards dry, create an illustrator file to cut out a jig on CNC of the negative space of the brush shape. 
* Glue boards to create the separate wholes of the respective head section and handle section. Let dry for 24 hours
* Scrape off excess glue
* Place both sections inside jig and clamp down
* Cut out with CNC (may have to do a couple passes)
* Remove off CNC bed.
* Use dowel joiner to create holes in both sections. 
* Glue two sections together with dowels inside.
* Sandpaper and use other hand tools(palm router,file)  to get to desired shape.

So my son is 10.5 months old, has been EBF, and has coslept with me since birth. I believe he’s had some silent reflux issues that have mostly resolved. He has woken up about every 1-2 hours almost every night since birth for comfort. I have compartmentalized this and compensated with coffee and prayer lol. I don’t allow myself to dwell on my lack of sleep because when I say I tried everything except for medication for reflux, I seriously mean it. He goes right back to sleep after latching so I know it is a sleep association. 

However, for some reason 2 weeks ago I decided to try laying him down in the crib for his first nap. He did amazing, like woke up when I laid him down and put himself back to sleep. So I kept on with that and now he takes both naps in his crib. Sleeps 3.5 hrs per day for naps. Goes to sleep between 8/9p, wakes between 7/8a. (Again, with waking very often and needing to latch). 

I have put him in the crib at the start of the night and he wakes up 45mins later upset. I just put him in to bed with me at that point. I’m trying to do this slowly. But I don’t know what the next step is. I’ve been trying to soothe him in other ways other than the boob at night but some nights he will just scream.

Yep, it's beans and weiners time now that summers rolling in! A 2020 menu #1!

1st pic is the star of the show, the beans and weiners! I added some crushed red pepper and apparently a ""blurry"" filter too! Sorry about that. 

This dish was great! You may think it's sweet, but this is actually more savory than sweet. The weiners are like sliced hot dogs, but here's the thing, these are quality weiners. Put the 4 Fingers of Death US MRE out of your mind, these weiners are far superior. 

Pics 2-3 show packaging and contents; a nice little spread for sure!

Pic 4 is that ever present ""Canadian beach towel"", bask in its glory!

Pics 5-6 are that amazingly sweet, moist, and delicious cornbread. Trust me on this, there is nothing wrong with this cornbread, it's fantastic.  In this case, I topped it with the strawberry jam, paired very well. I used the chocolate PB in a US FSR caffeinated chocolate pudding, boy was that yummy too!

Pic 7 shows the Tropical Fruit Salad and the Wildberry Crunchy Cereal. Now, this may look ""normal"", but here's where I went a little waffelly, I actually used the juice from the fruit to recon that cereal!!!! Wow! What a flavor bomb that was!!!

Grape drinks were great, 3 in 1 coffee wonderful in a protein shake, and the Xact Protein bar was eaten by one of my kiddos as they are not my favorite IMP item. I did not use the Tobasco here, as I opted for the crushed red pepper instead.

Conclusion: a great IMP and I encourage others to try one!

I've been on this subreddit before but not much luck. Unfortunately most messages have about as much substance as the people behind them. I'm looking for long term friends and actual connections but I know that's a bit of a loaded request on here. I'm hoping we have things in common to talk about. A bit about me is I'm quite introverted. I enjoy a lot of quiet, creative hobbies like reading and journaling. I like old sitcoms and cartoons, I'm not huge on anime but I do read a few mangas. A quiet and slower lifestyle. I love visiting libraries, coffee shops, bookstores, thrift stores. It's a bit hard to find others like me because they're usually all hiding the same. I do love spending time with someone while just doing our own things, the company is very nice. I'll match your energy when it comes to messaging, I love to chat but I am shy at first. I'm pretty easy going but I am a bit of an old lady compared to most. I hope you know how to carry a conversation or show interest in it. If you're looking for a short conversation, I probably won't be a fun chat. Something a bit different to my other hobbies is I love paranormal and supernatural topics. I have some pretty odd, spiritual beliefs before we get to the conversation. I enjoy some video games but not huge on it. I love COD zombies, RDR2, Minecraft, The Sims, Infinity Nikki, and some others. I hope your message is a bit more than just a hi, hello. I'm 27 from Cali, open to anyone but keep it sfw. It would be great to make some girl friends, I hope I can find other women looking for genuine friends. It would be great if you're within a 6-8 hr time difference so its not so difficult but if we can make good friends, I'm sure we can make it work!

Here are some icebreakers:

* What do you enjoy watching?
* Do you believe in anything paranormal or supernatural?
* Do you collect anything?
* What's a deal breaker for you in a friendship?
* How do you like spending your time?
* Do you have any pets?",1,1750213511.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.67,False

Matsson has won, has the wealth, the luxury home, and yet he finds no satisfaction in it. Success is boring, I think he says. 

Then Logan visits. He mocks the idea of complimenting Matsson’s home—opposite behavior to Roman—and Lukas is intrigued and  feels he has a kindred spirit in the old man.

[Year-in-Delusion 8/8] This year, I want to thank the courage it took to survive… four years at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School. I didn’t know if I’d make it through all those catered networking events, Ivy League syllabi, and internship offers. But I pressed on.

After graduating from Penn, I faced unimaginable adversity: a stable job at the U.S. Department of Commerce. The halls were clean. The coffee was free. But inside, I was battling demons—namely, whether to apply to the #1 law school and the #1 business school on Earth. I asked myself: “Do I dare? Do I deserve it?”

Then I looked around at my peers—also Ivy grads in prestigious federal roles—and I said, “Yes. I, too, will apply to Harvard.”

Now I’m proud to say I’ve overcome those unbearable odds, clawed my way up from the depths of upper-class achievement, and made it to Harvard JD/MBA.

To all the other victims of elite privilege: I see you. I believe in you. And if I can do it, so can you.

On our wedding anniversary, my husband insisted on inviting his entire crew of friends. 
Among them was a female ""bro"" I'd never seen before.
The moment she walked in, she plopped down directly on my husband's lap and started a video call: 
""Mom, I made it! Your godson is sitting right next to me.""
Then she turned and pressed her face close to his: 
""If you treat me badly, I'll have both our families beat you up!""
Crack! The glass I was holding slipped from my fingers.
In an instant, everyone's eyes were on me.
His female ""bro"" just arched one eyebrow:
""Hey, I was just joking around. You're not mind by that, are you?""
I just smiled and calmly said：
""Of course, I don't mind, the room is ready for both of you.""
""After all, no one wants to see you rutting like animals.""

The private room fell silent instantly—you could hear a pin drop.

I instinctively looked at Knox.

He just smiled and playfully tapped Piper's head, his tone affectionate: ""Today's my wedding anniversary with my wife. Don't be so wild.""

She pouted flirtatiously, naturally wrapping her arms around his neck: ""Fine. Since you're throwing this welcome-home party for me, I'll give you that much.""

By then, a server came in to clean up the broken glass and handed me a new cup.

Someone took the opportunity to ease the tension: ""Don't mind her, Riley. Piper's always been carefree—she doesn't mean any harm.""

I remained silent.

Piper glanced at me dismissively: ""Don't tell me you're actually this petty?""

After that, she released her hold on Knox and hopped off his lap: ""Guess I better keep my distance from you, Knox. So wifey doesn't throw a fit when you get home.""

Then she shook her head with a dramatic sigh, teasing the group of guys: ""Now you see why I don't hang out with women?""

""So dramatic and sensitive. It's exhausting.""

Nobody picked up her comment, and the atmosphere turned awkward.

Someone hesitantly spoke up: ""Piper, it's their anniversary today, maybe tone it down a bit...""

Suddenly Piper covered her mouth in mock realization: ""Oh my god, I almost forgot! I brought a gift!""

Then she pulled out a velvet jewelry box from her purse and presented it to Knox like a prized treasure: ""Ta-da!""

When she opened the box, inside lay a pair of gleaming gemstone cufflinks—men's cufflinks.

Someone politely gasped in admiration.

Knox smiled. ""You came all the way back home—I should be the one giving you gifts.""

Hearing this, Piper gave him a coy look and reached over to fasten them on his wrists.

As she moved, matching cufflinks on her own sleeves caught the light brilliantly.

""Hmph, I picked these out especially for you. You better appreciate them.""

Some people had already begun secretly glancing at my expression, but I just took a deep breath, my clenched fingers leaving crescent-shaped marks on my palm.

Then I stood up.

Knox frowned. ""Where are you going?""

I forced a smile. ""To book you two a hotel room.""

""Otherwise I'm afraid you'll do it right here.""

The moment I finished speaking, Piper violently smashed the empty jewelry box in her hand onto the floor.

She cursed loudly: ""What's wrong with this chick?""

""I told you guys we should've just hung out with the bros.""

""Now she's completely ruined the mood!""

Knox chased after me, his tone urgent: ""Babe, Piper doesn't mean anything by it.""

""They're just cufflinks. She's always been casual like this—don't take it personally.""

""And what you said back there was way out of line...""

I gave him a cold smile. ""So the real reason you invited all your friends today was to celebrate your childhood sweetheart coming home, right?""

Knox shifted uncomfortably, avoiding my eyes. ""Why are you making such a big deal out of this?""

""Besides, our anniversaries are always just the two of us—that gets a bit dull.""

""I thought inviting more people would make it more fun.""

Seeing my expression darken, Knox grabbed my hand, his tone softening unusually: ""Babe, don't overthink this. Piper and I have known each other for years—if something was going to happen between us, it would have already.""

""And look, I chose to be with you, didn't I?""

I nearly laughed from anger: ""I'm so sorry for taking your childhood sweetheart's place.""

""Fine, I'll step aside.""

Knox's face flushed red as he yanked his hand away, his tone hardening: ""What are you talking about? You know that's not what I meant.""

""Riley, you're being completely unreasonable!""

With that, he stormed off without looking back.

But his footsteps gradually slowed. I knew he was waiting for me to compromise and follow him, just like I always had before.

I frowned, turned around and walked away.

This man is truly disgusting!

Knox came home at three in the morning.

He was completely wasted, clothes disheveled, reeking of alcohol, stumbling as he tried to embrace me.

I frowned and dodged him, but he caught my wrist.

Next second, his boozy breath hit my face: ""Happy anniversary, babe. Look what I got you.""

He pulled a jewelry box from his pocket and opened it in front of me—it was the Graff Diamonds jewelry set I'd been eyeing for months.

But my eyes quickly fell on the two empty spots in the box.

Knox scratched his head sheepishly: ""Piper accidentally saw it, and she really liked the bracelet and ring. She insisted on taking them.""

""I figured you already have plenty of bracelets and rings, so I let her have them...""

When I didn't take it, he tried to force the box into my hands, his tone reassuring: ""Babe, don't be mad. If you really want them, I'll buy you another set, okay?""

Yet I just stepped back, letting the jewelry box clatter to the floor.

Knox paused, pressed his lips together to control his temper, then forced a smile: ""Babe, I was wrong today. I'm sorry.""

""I shouldn't have invited so many people on our anniversary. But look what I got!""

With that, he pulled out a small cherry cake from behind his back.

I stared at the cake, memories flooding back...

The day we got together, he had given me a cherry cake too.

Since then, we'd promised to celebrate every important occasion with cherry cake.

In that moment, fragments of everything we'd experienced together over the years flashed before my eyes.

I sighed and finally accepted it.

Fine. I'll forgive him one last time.

Seeing me unwrap the cake, Knox's face lit up with a huge smile.

As he fed me a bite, he cautiously began: ""Babe, Piper just got back and hasn't found an apartment yet...""

""She wants to stay with us for a few days. Is that okay?""

""She promised she won't cause you any trouble!""

The sickly sweet taste in my mouth suddenly made me nauseous.

I rushed to the bathroom and couldn't help throwing up.

Knox followed anxiously, patting my back: ""What's wrong? Babe.""

I forcibly pushed his hand away, went to the table and smashed everything on it.

I looked at him, my eyes red: ""Yes, she can stay!

""I'll go!""

Knox's expression instantly changed, his voice rising: ""What are you making a scene about now? I told you it's temporary! You're walking out over something this trivial?""

His contorted face reflected in my eyes, but this time, the light in my eyes had completely extinguished.

I shook my head and forced a bleak smile: ""Let's get divorced.""

Knox clearly hadn't expected me to say that.

He exploded with rage, violently kicking over the coffee table:

""Riley, are you mental? You're really pushing it!""

I locked myself in the master bedroom.

When Knox finished his shower and found the door wouldn't open, he pounded on it furiously before slinking off to the guest room.

The next morning, he sat at the breakfast table with a cold expression. The table was set with an elaborate breakfast.

I snickered.

Playing the silent treatment card? How pathetic.

I just gave him a cold glance and walked expressionlessly toward the front door.

Knox couldn't take it anymore: ""Riley, don't be so ungrateful!""

""You were wrong yesterday too. You shouldn't throw around divorce as an empty threat.""

Without looking back, I replied flatly: ""I'm serious. Start preparing for it.""

After I closed the door, I heard dishes shattering inside.

...

By the time I reached the office, my emotions had completely settled.

My work efficiency remained as high as ever. Almost no one could tell I was having relationship troubles.

During a meeting, my boss announced: ""We have an international order that requires someone to travel to British for a month.""

""If anyone's interested, contact me. The company will cover all expenses, plus a travel allowance.""

At that moment, messages from Knox popped up one after another on my phone screen. I irritably turned off the phone and said loudly: ""I can go.""

After the meeting, a close colleague stopped me, sounding puzzled: ""Riley, what about your husband while you're gone for a month?""

I replied nonchalantly: ""Oh, he has his childhood sweetheart to keep him company. He won't be lonely.""

Hearing my words, my colleague realized they'd said something wrong and awkwardly shut up.

When I got home that evening, I found an unfamiliar suitcase in the entryway.

Bright pink, covered with random stickers.

I took off my heels only to discover someone had taken my house slippers.

My expression darkened immediately.

Walking barefoot a few steps forward, I heard flirtatious laughter: ""Wow, Knox! Your cooking has really improved since I last saw you!""

Piper was wearing my cherry slippers, eating with oil dripping down her chin.

In her hands were clearly my plate and fork.

Seeing me approach, Piper seemed startled: ""Oh! How do you walk so silently? You could've said something—you just scared me!""

""Knox, you're even more jumpy than I am. Must be rough getting scared by your wife every day, huh?""

Without wasting a single word, I stepped forward and slapped her across the face twice, hard and loud.

Then I threw the dishes on the table to the floor.

Piper was stunned by the slaps at first, then immediately exploded: "" You dare hit me?!""

Knox heard the commotion and rushed out from the kitchen, grabbing the raging Piper.

She twisted in his arms: ""Knox, did you see that? Has your wife lost her mind? She hit me the second she walked in!""

""How can you stand this psycho? Why are you holding me back? Hit her back for me!""

Knox's face darkened as he yelled at me: ""Riley, what is wrong with you? Apologize right now!""

I curled my lips into a smile: ""Oh, I'm so sorry. I couldn't see clearly.""

""I just saw some woman wearing my slippers, using my dishes—I thought she was a thief.""

Piper's face flushed red, looking somewhat guilty: ""I didn't know they were yours...""

But she was obviously lying.

I love cherries—almost everything of mine at home has a cherry symbol on it. If she accidentally wore my slippers, that would be understandable, but to also use my plates, my forks? Too many coincidences? Only a fool would believe she wasn't doing it deliberately.

Seeing that I'd apologized, her expression changed.

She nestled softly in Knox's arms, showing her reddened cheek and tearful eyes: ""I'm sorry, Riley. Even if it was an accident, I shouldn't have touched your things...""

I raised an eyebrow.

Well, well. A professional damsel in distress.

But Knox was clearly falling for it.

He soothingly patted Piper's shoulder, then frowned at me: ""Riley, you've really gone too far this time.""

Then he helped Piper to the guest room to treat her face.

I quickly packed my bags and went straight to a hotel.

Soon after, my phone was blowing up.

""Where did you run off to now?"" Knox's voice was impatient.

My tone was ice-cold: ""Aren't you busy taking care of your little sweetheart? Why are you looking for me?""

Hearing my cold attitude, Knox's tone became angry: ""You caused all this mess and just left? Who else should I look for if not you!""

""Piper's face is swollen. Go buy some ice and bring it back—quickly.""

I just laughed coldly: ""I heard saliva works better for swelling. She'd probably prefer that anyway.""

With that, I hung up immediately.

Then my phone buzzed with a message from my boss: [Riley, I've arranged everything for your business trip. Your flight is the day after tomorrow in the morning.]

I calmly replied: [Thank you. I'll be there on time.]

After some consideration, I decided to text Knox about it.

Even though I'd decided on divorce, it didn't stop me from being a responsible adult.

While typing in the chat window, my phone buzzed again—it was a WhatsApp friend request notification, sent by someone who added me using my phone number.

The profile picture was a provocative body shot, and the username was ""Queen Piper.""

I instantly knew who it was. No one but her would use such an extravagant name.

But I had never given my phone number to any of Knox's friends.

So, only Knox could have given her my number.

Thinking of this, I accepted the request.

Neither of us spoke, but her moments were rapidly updating with several new posts.

The earliest was from this afternoon.

[Back in the States! Staying at my best bro's place~] The photo showed a table full of food, with the corner revealing a man and woman's hands wearing matching cufflinks.

[Got hurt by a psycho, and my best bro insisted on going out late at night to buy me medicine.] The photo showed medicine on a table and a man's hand holding a cotton swab.

[OMG! I told him he has to give himself to me as compensation, and he didn't object!] The photo showed a man's back view, apparently passed out on the couch.

I calmly closed my phone and took out my laptop, revising the project materials for the overseas trip.

Everything might betray you, but money never will.

After finishing my project presentation in the conference room,

My boss patted my shoulder encouragingly: ""Great job, Riley. I feel completely confident putting you in charge of this project.""

""Keep it up—there's a bonus in it for you when you finish.""

I thanked him modestly, showing my first genuine smile in days.

After the meeting ended, I was organizing materials to bring tomorrow when I suddenly remembered something—my passport—it's still in the nightstand at home!

So I left work early and took a taxi straight home.

The moment the door opened, my eyes widened as I took in everything before me...",3,1750212974.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,2,1.0,False
1le5mvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1le5mvp/reactive_senior_dog_affecting_quality_of/,"Reactive, senior dog affecting quality of life/mental health","Hi all, I am looking for honest advice. My husband and I adopted our mutt (chocolate lab/aussie/cattle dog/golden mix) when he was about a year old (as young as 9 months as old as 2), so he is 8-9 years old now.

TLDR: our 8 year old mutt’s reactivity / bite risk is negatively affecting our life and our daughter’s life and we are so tired/worn out from managing him for years. Not sure what to do.

He has always been high energy, loud barker especially when anxious, but at first he was friendly to all if somewhat nervous. We did group classes and personal training sessions and he is trainable. He never digs, takes food from a coffee table, or chews toys; and he loves to play fetch more than anything. He doesn’t really like to be pet much (one of his triggers is too much touching, or touching in the wrong place).

First incident was about a year after we got him: he bit (drew a small amount of blood but no stitches) his dog walker on the lip when the walker was leaning over to put on his harness. We felt awful but suspected his harness was  too small so we addressed that and he was fine for about another year until the pandemic. We lived at the time in the middle of a city experiencing intense protests with excessive helicopter presence that tortured our guy for weeks (reactive to loud noises). During this time he bit me (also the lip which bruised and drew a small amount of blood) when I leaned over to pet him while he was asleep on the floor at my feet. We sought a consultation with a behaviorist who prescribed daily sertraline and situational clonidine and we did one-on-one training. While the intervention helped, we never fully trusted him ever again and have been expending so much energy trying to get ahead of his triggers and unpredictable behavior. We also moved to the suburbs (quieter) during this time with a yard. He became reactive to the yard (barking, high prey drive, killing bunnies and at least 1-2 birds). In 2021 we had a baby and in preparation took courses and were obsessive about keeping them apart and then teaching her not to touch the dog. We liberally use baby gates to keep them both safe and out of each others way. They’ve grown to tolerate and even like each other. Things are ok when it’s the three of us.

The issue is strangers. Since 2021 he has gotten more reactive to strangers and we feel like we can’t have people over without greatly managing him (medication, putting him in his room where he sometimes barks at the top of his lungs for hours) due to our distrust of his ability not to react to strangers or their ability to ignore him. He is very cute and presents as friendly when he isn’t barking, but we’ve seen him react (growling, snapping) on a dime toward strangers that don’t read his body language. He snaps or air bites at the vet, groomers that try to touch his feet, or even us if we touch his feet wrong drying him off after a walk, friends in our house who pet him when he doesn’t want to be (this was before we started consistently locking him away when visitors come over). It has absolutely affected our quality of life and made us feel isolated. Our daughter is now at the stage where we want to do play dates. It’s obviously difficult for us to do this and it requires locking him away and preparing the other family about his barking etc. we absolutely don’t trust him around other kids, not to mention they are scared of him. 

We are also looking for long-term childcare help in the afternoons and don’t know how we can feasibly bring a nanny into our home and keep everyone safe without keeping him locked in a room all day.

Any advice? We could never feel good about rehoming given his reactivity. BE feels too extreme but this situation is absolutely affecting us and our bond with him. We are time and energy limited as a dual career household with one young child and frankly just exhausted from constantly thinking about where the dog is and if we are putting him or anyone else in danger. Our absolute priority is our daughter, and while I do feel she is safe when it’s just our family, she is still a kid and I worry about him hurting her or one of her friends if there was a slip in our management protocol.

1le5mlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/1le5mlo/fediverse_explanations_and_guides/,Fediverse Explanations and Guides,"I know a few blind people who may be interested in the Fediverse, so I thought I should share this with you. I'm not one of these people who are against mainstream services. I don't care what you use. I just know that getting started there may be difficult. At any rate, I originally wrote this for a friend of mine and have since added to it. Please note that both Friendica and Akkoma have accessibility issues. However, for screen reader users, Friendica's are far more numourous and annoying. I recommend Akkoma for that reason. But if you use Friendica with a client, it can work for you. My friend was interested in both of these services, since he wished to follow me. Hence my focus on them and not Mastodon, which I have never used. The other reason I avoid Mastodon is that many instances have a 500 character limit and it's difficult to find ones that don't. The limit at Friendica is 200,000, and the limit at blob.cat (I'm not sure about all of Akkoma) is 10,000.

======

Here are some links to help you get started in the Fediverse. Note that while these sites mention Mastodon, as it's the most popular network, most of the advice, concepts, etc. also relate to Akkoma and Friendica.  Many Mastodon phone apps and clients for Windows also work with both. I found an exception with TweeseCake, which doesn't work with Akkoma.  For that, I use TWBlue (see below).

Apps and Clients

Here are some Mastodon apps if you would rather not use the Akkoma or Friendica websites.

This is TWBlue. It works with both platforms. However, you cannot edit posts with it and must hit shift+enter if you wish to deliberately write on a new line e.g. to start a new paragraph, separate lists, etc.

This is TweeseCake. It works wonderfully with Friendica, making most things there accessible. However, it does not work with Akkoma, and I have no idea why.

Fediverse Tips

Even though I now primarily use Akkoma, I was on Friendica long enough to learn these things.  Most apply to both platforms and probably Mastodon as well, so ignore the wording, unless it is specific to a particular platform. Do not include the quotation marks. I did so only to make reading easier.

1.  To follow a hashtag, simply write the number sign with a word i.e. ""#blind"".  Then, you can follow the tag, and any time someone posts with it, you will see that post, even if you're not friends.  You can also find individual posts that way.  To search for a person, use the at sign i.e. ""@dandylover1"", or the full address e.g. ""@dandylover1@blob.cat"", which is what I primarily use, or ""@dandylover1.friendica.world"", which is my other address. You can have as many accounts on as many networks as you wish. If you would like to tag someone in a post, you can do the same thing i.e. just use his address. ""@dandylover1@blob.cat"" I think you will find this interesting.

2.  In your profile, you can use hashtags so that people can find you.  For example ""I like ""#chocolate"" and ""#coffee"" "". You can also write a post about yourself and add the ""#introduction"" hashtag. It's a great way of making friends and works on all platforms. Alternatively, Friendica specifically has keywords that you can enter so that people can find you that way.  They can be written in your profile.

3.  When using hashtags, you must combine words.  For example ""#ComputerGames"" not ""# computer games"" or ""#computer #games"".  Also, if you combine two words, make the first letter of each a capital. This is good for screen reader users. 

4.  In Friendica, if you want to see all of the posts that someone makes, go to Contacts and find the person or group. Then, click on it, and go to Channels.  Ensure that you check the box about seeing all posts.  You must do this for each contact whose posts you wish to see.  In Akkoma, Just go to Following, then click on the name of the person or group, and press the Subscribe button.  If you don't do this, you may miss all but the most popular or newest posts. However, while you can do this with as many contacts as you wish, it may become confusing if you treat too many in this way. This is because, unlike Reddit, where you can follow individual posts and easily see people's replies, in the Fediverse, you see all sorts of conversations and even when you're not actually mentioned, things are often posted to the ""Mentions"" section.

5.  Boosting/repeating is like sharing on Facebook. Liking/favouriting is like liking. 

6.  Both Akkoma and Friendica have local posting and timelines. This means that your posts are visible only to those on your network, and not to the entire Fediverse.  Likewise, your Local timeline only shows your network's posts.  It may even be local to your instance, not the entire networkd.  For example, my network is Akkoma, but my specific instance is blob.cat. If you post publically, all people in the Fediverse can see what you post. This is great if you have friends on different networks, such as Mastodon.

7.  When you are on someone's profile and wish to follow him, if it asks for your instance, don't write your full address.  Just write something like blob.cat or friendica.world, using my own examples.  Then, you will be taken to your page and can follow the person or group from there.",1,1750212897.0,Blind,0,0.67,False

Both their dumplings were really good. Pastry for the xiao long bao didn't fall apart when trying to pick them up and didn't just turn to paste when eating them. Filling was flavourful and there was heaps of soup inside.

The other dumplings were also quite good, the pastry was soft, bouncy, slightly chewy, and slippery. Filling was pork and chives. The soup was savoury and very light.

Someone mentioned Teadee on this sub, I think. Didn't realise it was in Newmarket till I stumbled on it while hunting for coffee. Got the [salted cream Vietnamese coffee](https://i.imgur.com/jCa5GMr.jpeg).

This one tape we had included videos for Bop, Stand Up, Honey Won't You Open That Door, Yellow Rose of Texas. So this was approximately 1988, but this video could be much older. 

Video synopsis: dude is being pursued, he hunkers down for the night and builds a bonfire. Sets his coffee pot on the fire. I believe he looks at a photo in a locket, then there's a shot and the last scene is the coffee pot falling over into the flames. 

This is all I can recall. Several people had suggested Smoky and the Bandit, but the coffee pot and bonfire is a very distinct memory. 

Any leads appreciated. Its been bugging my siblings and myself for years. I even emailed CMT!

But I never crashed and felt lucky and I ate a bit but I still keep staying up every night driving and dancing but felt fine so it was fine but it’s still going and my body is sore and my mind is falling I can feel it and I know it now I’ve been wrong about being better because then I ran away and was fighting with family just a little b it but staid back and it’s fine. anyhow I’ve been hanging out and making friends with coworkers it’s so nice so even better but here’s the problem: I’m starting to like float and my feet feel fake and like I think the sleep may actually be getting to me because I’m fatigued and I can feel the stupid. My ears are like hearing the air loud But now I’m leaving town until Friday so how do o survive or get through until Friday? How do I pass as normal and just be ok? What should I do then?

Made my first real friend in college. Moved to a new city and started from 0 again, and realized I needed a fresh start and to finally make connections. These are some small shifts that worked for me to enjoy talking to people again and allow connection :)

1. use soft, casual openers - instead of forcing deep convos, i just comment on stuff around us (""this line's brutal huh"" or ""is it always this cold here?""). it lowers the pressure
2. think improv, not performance - don’t prepare for conversations, treat them like improv and build on what’s given to you
3. find connections and practice in low-stakes ways - I tried B‎u‍m​b‌l‍e BFF, T‎i‍n​d‌e‍r and Socia​bl, Socia​bl really primed me for socializing because you talk to AI characters in realistic scenarios like grabbing coffee with friends or small talk, the others made me feel a little weird and out of place, I’d resort to making friends in environments that are natural to you (e.g. getting into the gym and meeting someone there if you enjoy it)
4. repeat names once or twice early - makes the interaction feel a bit warmer, science-backed
5. save a few “default” stories - nothing intense, just funny or odd little moments from the week you can pull out if the convo dips (like accidentally microwaving a boiled egg and it exploding)

Still figuring it out, but these tips have really helped me and I’ve made a small yet mighty group of friends lol. I’m usually lurking so mods, please let me know if this goes against any rules! Would love to hear what helped other people too",6,1750212757.0,socialskills,2,1.0,False

I'm not one of these people who are against mainstream services. I don't care what you use. I just know that getting started there may be difficult. At any rate, I originally wrote this for a friend of mine and have since added to it. Please note that both Friendica and Akkoma have accessibility issues. However, for screen reader users, Friendica's are far more numourous and annoying. I recommend Akkoma for that reason. But if you use Friendica with a client, it can work for you. My friend was interested in both of these services, since he wished to follow me. Hence my focus on them and not Mastodon, which I have never used. The other reason I avoid Mastodon is that many instances have a 500 character limit and it's difficult to find ones that don't. The limit at Friendica is 200,000, and the limit at blob.cat (I'm not sure about all of Akkoma) is 10,000.

======

Here are some links to help you get started in the Fediverse. Note that while these sites mention Mastodon, as it's the most popular network, most of the advice, concepts, etc. also relate to Akkoma and Friendica.  Many Mastodon phone apps and clients for Windows also work with both. I found an exception with TweeseCake, which doesn't work with Akkoma.  For that, I use TWBlue (see below).

Fediverse Tips

Even though I now primarily use Akkoma, I was on Friendica long enough to learn these things.  Most apply to both platforms and probably Mastodon as well, so ignore the wording, unless it is specific to a particular platform. Do not include the quotation marks. I did so only to make reading easier.

1.  To follow a hashtag, simply write the number sign with a word i.e. ""#blind"".  Then, you can follow the tag, and any time someone posts with it, you will see that post, even if you're not friends.  You can also find individual posts that way.  To search for a person, use the at sign i.e. ""@dandylover1"", or the full address e.g. ""@dandylover1@blob.cat"", which is what I primarily use, or ""@dandylover1.friendica.world"", which is my other address. You can have as many accounts on as many networks as you wish. If you would like to tag someone in a post, you can do the same thing i.e. just use his address. ""@dandylover1@blob.cat"" I think you will find this interesting.

2.  In your profile, you can use hashtags so that people can find you.  For example ""I like ""#chocolate"" and ""#coffee"" "". You can also write a post about yourself and add the ""#introduction"" hashtag. It's a great way of making friends and works on all platforms. Alternatively, Friendica specifically has keywords that you can enter so that people can find you that way.  They can be written in your profile.

3.  When using hashtags, you must combine words.  For example ""#ComputerGames"" not ""# computer games"" or ""#computer #games"".  Also, if you combine two words, make the first letter of each a capital. This is good for screen reader users. 

4.  In Friendica, if you want to see all of the posts that someone makes, go to Contacts and find the person or group. Then, click on it, and go to Channels.  Ensure that you check the box about seeing all posts.  You must do this for each contact whose posts you wish to see.  In Akkoma, Just go to Following, then click on the name of the person or group, and press the Subscribe button.  If you don't do this, you may miss all but the most popular or newest posts. However, while you can do this with as many contacts as you wish, it may become confusing if you treat too many in this way. This is because, unlike Reddit, where you can follow individual posts and easily see people's replies, in the Fediverse, you see all sorts of conversations and even when you're not actually mentioned, things are often posted to the ""Mentions"" section.

5.  Boosting/repeating is like sharing on Facebook. Liking/favouriting is like liking. 

6.  Both Akkoma and Friendica have local posting and timelines. This means that your posts are visible only to those on your network, and not to the entire Fediverse.  Likewise, your Local timeline only shows your network's posts.  It may even be local to your instance, not the entire networkd.  For example, my network is Akkoma, but my specific instance is blob.cat. If you post publically, all people in the Fediverse can see what you post. This is great if you have friends on different networks, such as Mastodon.

7.  When you are on someone's profile and wish to follow him, if it asks for your instance, don't write your full address.  Just write something like blob.cat or friendica.world, using my own examples.  Then, you will be taken to your page and can follow the person or group from there.",1,1750212659.0,BlindAndFine,0,1.0,False

I had a dream last night. Usually I don’t remember my dreams but this one felt too..personal, too real. 

I was walking around an outdoor mall, casually as far as I remember. When I saw A, we stood there for a moment, surprised at seeing one another I’m assuming. Then from one moment to the next we were walking together. We were taking like we left everything we’ve gone through, behind and started fresh, remembering the good times- the happy times. It felt like there wasn’t any anger between us in that moment. Anyways, we asked each other how it’s been since the last time we saw one another then the conversation was coming to an end, at some point A took a step away as if leaving. I stopped him and immediately said “please let’s hang out for the day, then tomorrow if you don’t want to see me again, I’ll let it go.” I remember how desperate I felt, how I longed to just be near A and talk to him again. At some point he agreed, happily at that, then we ended up in a coffee shop (you know how random dreams are, location wise.) and I ordered him his usual coffee how he liked it, he complimented me saying “You always knew me.” 

In my dream, I paused, I suspected it was a dream. From here it’s like I knew it was a dream but still went along with it all. 

I nodded and handed him his coffee, while I drank mine, I brought him some food too. I stood beside him for a moment while he took a sip of his coffee with a smile. I remember saying “I missed just hanging out with you.” He responded with “I did too, I was hoping I’d see you again.” To which I sighed, again, knowing this was a dream. I smiled at him, as he said “I’ll see you later.” 

Then I woke up. I felt that longing feeling again, the feeling I thought was long gone. That was the last thing I told him before I left for the last time..”I’ll be back, see you later.” I’m so sorry, sorry for bothering you being woman enough to tell you I wasn’t going to be back. I missed you for the longest time. I knew it was the best for us at the moment since you really cared about what your sisters had to say about us, after the gunshot, after everything. Still, I missed you. I have so much I want to say that I know you will never hear. My mom told me about the gas station, when you told her to “please, take care of me.” Thank you. Thank you for caring even in the slightest way. Thank you for everything, even though we both had our rocky moments. We were toxic towards the end, we really were, but that doesn’t mean we didn’t start off well. I still remember the day we first held hands in the store, we were such little kids, all giggly…I hope you’re doing okay. I hope you get to do whatever your hearts set on doing. I still can’t say goodbye to you. So hopefully..

The thrill pumps through me, heart racing, hands tight on the grips. I lean into a turn, pushing the machine harder, chasing that edge where control meets chaos. Something nags at me, a knot in my gut, but I shake it off. I’m too alive to stop.Then it happens. A hidden snow hump, camouflaged under a layer of powder, rises out of nowhere. I don’t see it until I’m airborne, my snowmobile bucking like a wild animal. The world tilts, sky and snow blurring into one. I’m weightless for a heartbeat, then I slam into the ground, tumbling down a 20-foot drop. My body hits hard, snow cushioning nothing. Pain explodes in my right leg, a searing, bone-deep agony that rips a scream from my throat. I skid to a stop, sprawled in a drift, my snowmobile a twisted wreck 10 feet away.I try to move, but my leg’s useless. I glance down, and my stomach lurches. My pant leg is torn, blood soaking through, the angle of my thigh all wrong—shattered, no question. The femur’s snapped, maybe in pieces. I can’t stand, can’t even crawl. I’m stuck, alone, miles from anywhere. My friends are too far ahead, their engines a faint hum, then nothing. Silence crashes in, heavy and suffocating. The trees around me creak, their branches clawing at the sky. No birds, no breeze, just my own gasping breaths and the thud of my heart.Blood pools in the snow, a bright red stain spreading fast. I’m a signal now, a dinner bell for anything with claws and teeth. Mountain lions, bears—they’re out here, and they’ll smell me soon. My pulse spikes, every nerve on edge. A twig snaps, sharp and close, somewhere up the ridge. My head whips toward it, eyes straining against the fading light. Nothing moves, but the hairs on my neck stand up. I’m exposed, a wounded animal in the open.My SPOT device is clipped to my jacket. My hands shake as I fumble for it, fingers clumsy from cold and shock. The pain in my leg is a living thing, pulsing with every heartbeat, making my vision blur. I find the device, rip off my glove, and press the SOS button. I hold it down, counting seconds, praying the signal goes through. The light blinks green, a small promise in the chaos. Help’s coming, I tell myself. Search and Rescue will find me. But how long? Thirty minutes? An hour? My leg’s bleeding bad, and the cold’s already creeping in, numbing my hands, my face.“Stay calm,” I mutter, my voice hoarse, swallowed by the vastness. “Just breathe.” But the words feel like a lie. The silence is worse than the pain. It’s thick, pressing down, broken only by the creak of trees and the faint crunch of settling snow. My eyes dart to the ridge again. Another snap, louder, deliberate. Something’s moving out there, a shadow flickering between the pines. My heart slams against my ribs. Is it a deer? A wolf? Or something bigger, sniffing the air, catching the scent of my blood?I clutch the SPOT device, its blinking light my only anchor. The cold sinks deeper, my body shaking uncontrollably now. My leg’s a furnace of pain, each throb sending sparks across my vision. I try to shift, to ease the pressure, but the movement’s a mistake. A fresh wave of agony hits, and I bite my lip hard, tasting copper. Blood’s still seeping, the stain in the snow growing wider. I picture a bear, its nose twitching, lumbering closer. The thought makes my chest tight, my breaths shallow.“Keep it together,” I whisper. “They’re coming. They have to be.” But doubt creeps in, cold as the snow under me. What if the signal failed? What if the battery’s dead? The SPOT’s light keeps blinking, but it feels mocking now, a false hope in the dark. I scan the ridge again, eyes burning from the strain. A low growl rumbles, close enough to feel in my bones. My blood freezes. It’s not my imagination. Something’s out there, maybe 40 yards away, hidden in the trees. I hold my breath, afraid to make a sound. The growl comes again, deep, hungry, vibrating through the air.I fumble for my knife, but it’s gone, lost in the fall. My snowmobile’s too far to reach, its emergency kit useless now. I’m defenseless, pinned like prey. The pain’s dizzying, my head swimming, but fear keeps me sharp. I talk to myself, voice barely audible. “You’re not dying here. Not like this.” I try to picture the rescue team, their snowmobiles racing toward me, but all I see is the ridge, the shadows, the glint of eyes I can’t be sure are real.Minutes drag, each one an eternity. The cold’s a vice now, squeezing my chest, my fingers numb even inside my gloves. My leg’s gone quiet, the pain dulling, and that scares me more than the growls. Shock’s setting in, or worse. I shake my head, force my eyes open. “Stay awake,” I snap, louder than I mean to. The sound echoes, and I wince, waiting for another growl. It doesn’t come, but the silence is heavier now, like the wilderness is watching, waiting for me to break.A new sound cuts through—a faint whine, mechanical, distant. My heart leaps. An engine. Snowmobiles, maybe more than one. I strain to hear, praying it’s not my mind playing tricks. The sound grows, steady, closer. “Here!” I shout, voice raw. “I’m here!” My good arm waves, a desperate signal, pain shooting through me with every move. Headlights pierce the dusk, bouncing over the snow. Two snowmobiles skid to a stop, their engines idling loud.A figure climbs off, boots crunching as he hurries over. “You the one who sent the distress signal?” His voice is deep, urgent, muffled by a scarf.“Yeah,” I gasp, relief flooding me. “My leg’s busted. Can’t move.”He kneels beside me, pulling off his helmet. His face is weathered, eyes sharp. “Search and Rescue. I’m with the chopper’s medic team. Let’s see what we’re dealing with.” He checks my leg, his hands quick but careful. “This is bad. Femur’s broken, and you’re bleeding too much. Chopper’s close.”“How long?” I ask, teeth chattering.“Eight minutes, tops,” he says, wrapping a blanket around me. “Stay with me, alright?”The second rescuer stands a few feet away, flashlight sweeping the ridge. “You hear anything out here?” he asks, voice low, tense.I nod, throat tight. “Growling. Not far. Maybe a bear.”He grips his radio, muttering something about wildlife. The first guy keeps talking, his voice steady, grounding. “What happened out here? You hit something?”“Snow hump,” I say, wincing as he tightens a strap around my leg. “Didn’t see it. Went flying.”“You’re lucky you had that SPOT,” he says. “Got your signal clear as day. Saved your life.”Another growl rips through the air, closer, sharper. The second rescuer spins, flashlight beam cutting through the trees. “Stay sharp, Tom,” he says to the first guy. My pulse spikes, eyes locked on the ridge. Something moves, a shadow too big to be a deer. The first guy—Tom—squeezes my shoulder. “Focus on me, okay? Chopper’s almost here.”The pain’s back now, roaring as they stabilize my leg. I grit my teeth, sweat beading despite the cold. The growl doesn’t come again, but I feel it, the weight of something watching. The second rescuer keeps his flashlight on the ridge, hand on his radio like he’s ready to call for backup.Then I hear it—the thump of helicopter blades, faint but growing. A spotlight sweeps the snow, blinding. “There!” Tom shouts, waving his arms. The chopper circles, its roar drowning out everything. They load me onto a stretcher, every jolt like a knife in my leg. I bite back a scream as they carry me to the helicopter, the second rescuer still scanning the trees.As they lift me inside, I glance back at the ridge. Eyes glint in the dark, low and steady, then vanish. The chopper door slams shut, and we’re airborne, the wilderness falling away below. I’m safe, but the fear clings like frost. Those 45 minutes—bleeding, waiting, listening for growls—carved something permanent in me. The backcountry doesn’t forgive. It watches, it waits, and if you falter, it’s ready to claim you.

  


# ""Claws in the Quiet"":

I fumbled with the tent poles, my fingers stiff from the long drive as Emily and I set up camp deep in Missinaibi Lake Provincial Park. It was our fifth anniversary, a chance to escape the city’s grind and breathe in the wild. We’d planned this for months, dreaming of quiet nights and open skies. The road up had been a blur of towering pines and twisting gravel paths, the kind that make you feel like you’re the only soul for miles. We packed carefully: a sturdy tent, thick sleeping bags, a cooler of food, gallons of water, a first aid kit, and bear spray. I’d read about bears, but they felt like a distant worry. So when we parked at the trailhead, I left the spray in the glovebox, thinking we’d grab it later. That choice haunts me still.Emily knelt by the fire pit, stacking kindling with care. Her hair caught the fading light as she looked up, smiling. “This is exactly what we needed,” she said, her voice warm. “No emails, no traffic. Just us.”I forced a grin, shoving down the unease creeping up my spine. The forest was too still, the air heavy with the scent of pine and earth. “Yeah, it’s perfect,” I said, tossing a log onto the pile. We got the fire going, its crackle filling the silence. We sat close, shoulders touching, and talked about the future—a house with a big yard, maybe a dog, kids running around. Emily’s laugh was soft, like music, and for a few hours, the world felt right.That night, I woke with a start. A rustle outside the tent, heavy and deliberate, like something big brushing through the undergrowth. My heart thudded as I lay still, straining to hear. Emily stirred, her voice a whisper. “What’s that?”“Probably just a deer,” I said, but my mouth was dry. I unzipped the tent flap an inch, peering into the dark. Shadows shifted beyond the fire’s dying glow, but nothing clear. The rustling stopped, and I zipped the flap shut, my hands shaking. “It’s gone,” I told her, sliding back into my sleeping bag. “Sleep, okay?”“Okay,” she murmured, but her breathing stayed uneven. I stared at the tent’s ceiling, every creak of a branch making me flinch. Something felt wrong, like eyes were on us, waiting. I didn’t sleep again.Morning came, and Emily was herself again, humming as she boiled water for coffee. “Let’s hike today,” she said, holding out a steaming mug. “You said there’s a lake view, right? With cliffs?”“Yeah, sounds good,” I said, sipping the coffee. It burned my tongue, but I didn’t care. I wanted to shake off last night’s nerves. We packed light: water bottles, granola bars, a map, my pocket knife clipped to my belt. The trail started wide, marked by wooden signs nailed to trees. Emily walked ahead, pointing out chipmunks darting across the path. “Look at that one!” she laughed, her voice echoing.An hour in, the trail narrowed. The signs vanished, and the path split into faint tracks swallowed by ferns. I checked the map, but the lines blurred together. “Did we miss a turn?” Emily asked, stopping to wipe her brow.“Nah, it’s probably just up here,” I said, pointing to a trail that looked slightly wider. I wasn’t sure, but I didn’t want her to worry. We kept going, the forest growing denser, branches scraping our arms. My stomach knotted as I realized nothing looked familiar. “Maybe we should head back,” I said, my voice tighter than I meant.Emily nodded, but then she froze, staring at the ground. I followed her gaze—big, fresh tracks in the dirt, claw marks stretching longer than my hand. “Bear,” I whispered, my throat closing up.Her eyes widened. “David, what do we do?”“Stay calm,” I said, my mind racing. “We make noise, scare it off. Like the guide said.” We started clapping, singing an old camp song, our voices thin and shaky. It felt ridiculous, but we kept it up, trudging back the way we came. Then we saw it—a pile of bones, a deer’s carcass, its ribs cracked open, flesh still pink and wet. Emily gripped my arm, her nails digging in.“That’s fresh,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “We need to go. Now.”I nodded, my pulse hammering. We moved faster, eyes darting to every shadow. The forest felt alive, watching. Then came the growl—low, guttural, vibrating through my chest. It was close. Too close.I spun around, scanning the trees. “Stay behind me,” I told Emily, fumbling for my pocket knife. The blade looked pathetic, barely three inches. The growl came again, louder, and then I saw it—a black bear, massive, its fur matted, eyes locked on us. It stood on the path, head lowered, teeth gleaming like knives.“David!” Emily cried, backing up. I raised my arms, trying to look big, shouting, “Get out! Go away!” My voice cracked, but I kept yelling. The bear didn’t flinch. It took a step, then another, its claws scraping the dirt.“Don’t run,” I hissed, my heart pounding so hard I thought it’d burst. But Emily’s panic took over. She bolted, and I grabbed for her, missing. “Emily, no!” The bear charged, a blur of black, its roar shaking the air. I ran after her, branches tearing at my face, my legs burning.It reached her first. She screamed as its claws slashed her side, blood spraying the leaves. She crumpled, and I dove at the bear, stabbing my knife into its shoulder. It roared, swinging its head, and pain exploded in my arm as its claws ripped through my jacket, shredding skin and muscle. I hit the ground hard, gasping, blood soaking my sleeve.Emily was crawling, her face white, blood pooling under her. “David,” she gasped, reaching for me. I scrambled to her, ignoring the fire in my arm. The bear circled, growling, its eyes never leaving us. I dragged her behind a fallen log, my hands slick with blood. “Hold on,” I said, pressing my jacket against her wound. It was deep, too deep. “You’re gonna be okay.”Her eyes were glassy, her voice weak. “It hurts… so much.”“I know, I know,” I said, my voice breaking. “Just stay with me.” I shouted for help, my throat raw, but the forest swallowed my voice. The bear lunged again, its jaws snapping inches from my face. I curled over Emily, playing dead, my body shaking. Its breath was hot, reeking of blood, its claws raking my back. I bit my lip to keep from screaming, tasting copper.Minutes dragged like hours. The bear snorted, pawed at us, then lumbered off, its steps fading. I waited, frozen, expecting it to come back. When it didn’t, I lifted my head. Emily’s breathing was shallow, her hand cold in mine. “Emily, talk to me,” I begged, shaking her gently. Her eyes fluttered open, a faint smile on her lips.“I love you,” she whispered. Then her chest stilled, her hand slipping from mine. I screamed her name, shaking her, but she was gone. Sobs tore through me, my vision blurring with tears. My arm throbbed, my back burned, but I couldn’t leave her. Not yet.I don’t know how long I sat there, cradling her. Blood soaked my clothes, my strength fading. I had to get help, for her, even if it was too late. I kissed her forehead, promising I’d come back. Standing was agony, my arm useless, every step sending pain shooting through me. I stumbled through the forest, shouting, my voice hoarse. The trees seemed to close in, endless, mocking.Hours blurred together. I fell, got up, fell again. My vision swam, but I kept moving, driven by her face, her voice. Finally, I saw the trailhead, the glint of our car. A ranger’s truck was there, and he ran toward me, his face paling. “What happened?” he asked, grabbing his radio.“Bear,” I gasped, collapsing. “My wife… she’s… it got her.” My words slurred as he called for help, his voice fading like a distant echo.They airlifted me out, doctors stitching my arm, bandaging my back. Broken ribs, torn muscles, but I lived. Emily didn’t. The rangers found her, said the bear was a rogue, known for attacks. They tracked it down, but it didn’t bring her back. Her laugh, her dreams, gone in a moment.I see her in every quiet moment, hear that growl in my sleep. The forest is beautiful, but it’s a liar. It gave us one night of peace, then stole everything. I’ll never go back, never trust the wild again. All I have left is her memory, and the weight of knowing I failed her.

  


# ""Night of the Bear"":

I zipped up the tent, the nylon crinkling under my fingers as I tugged the zipper tight. Jacqueline and I had kayaked 80 kilometers north of Chapleau, Ontario, to a remote campsite in Missinaibi Lake Provincial Park. Our two red kayaks rested on the rocky shore, their hulls glinting faintly as the light faded. The campfire popped and hissed, sending sparks into the air. We sat close, roasting marshmallows on sticks we’d whittled earlier. The sweet, charred smell mixed with the sharp scent of pine needles and lake water. Jacqueline’s dark hair fell loose over her shoulder, and her eyes sparkled in the firelight. “I can’t believe how peaceful it is here,” she said, her voice soft. “No phones, no noise. Just us.”I grinned, turning my marshmallow to keep it from burning. “Tomorrow, we’ll paddle to that waterfall the ranger mentioned. It’s supposed to be incredible.”She leaned her head against my shoulder, her warmth steadying me. “As long as I’m with you, I’m happy. But you’re cleaning the dishes tomorrow.”I laughed, nudging her. “Deal. But only if you carry the heavy pack.”We talked like that for hours, planning our route, joking about who’d catch more fish. The lake lapped gently against the shore, and the trees stood tall around us, their shadows blending into the darkness. It felt like the world belonged to us alone. Eventually, we doused the fire, the embers hissing as water hit them, and crawled into our tent. I zipped our sleeping bags together, and Jacqueline curled against me, her breathing slow and even. I fell asleep to the rhythm of her heart, feeling safe, wrapped in the quiet of the wilderness.A sharp crack snapped me awake. My eyes flew open, but the tent was pitch black, the kind of dark that swallows everything. I held my breath, straining to hear. Something heavy moved outside, crunching leaves and snapping twigs. It wasn’t the wind or a raccoon—this was big. My pulse hammered in my ears. I reached for Jacqueline, my hand brushing her arm. “Jacqueline,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “You hear that?”She stirred, her voice thick with sleep. “What… what is it?”“Something’s out there. An animal, maybe.” I kept my voice low, but fear crept into it. “Stay quiet.”I fumbled for the flashlight clipped to my pack, my fingers clumsy in the dark. The beam flickered on, weak and yellow, barely cutting through the blackness. I pointed it at the tent wall, half-expecting to see a shadow. Nothing. But the noises didn’t stop. They circled closer, deliberate, like whatever it was knew we were here. My other hand found my Swiss Army knife in my pocket. I flipped out the blade, its three inches of steel feeling pathetic against the weight of those steps.“Should we make noise?” Jacqueline whispered, her voice trembling now. “Scare it off?”I hesitated. “Maybe. But let’s wait. It might leave.” I didn’t believe my own words. My gut twisted, telling me this wasn’t a curious deer or a fox. The air felt heavy, like the forest itself was holding its breath.The rustling stopped, and for a moment, I thought it was gone. Then the tent shook violently, the poles creaking. A deep, guttural growl rumbled through the air, so loud it vibrated in my chest. Before I could move, the nylon tore open with a sickening rip, claws slicing through like paper. A massive black bear filled the opening, its eyes wild and gleaming in the flashlight’s beam. Its fur was matted, its teeth bared, and it smelled of earth and something sour, like death. Jacqueline screamed, a sound that cut through me.I swung the flashlight, cracking it against the bear’s head. It didn’t flinch, didn’t even blink. Its paw lashed out, claws raking my side. Pain exploded, hot and sharp, like fire spreading through my ribs. I yelled, gripping the knife, and stabbed at its shoulder. The blade sank in, but it was like poking a wall. The bear roared, deafening, and turned on Jacqueline. She kicked, scrambling backward, but its jaws clamped onto her leg, dragging her through the torn tent.“No!” I shouted, my voice raw, scraping my throat. I lunged after her, ignoring the pain in my side, blood soaking my shirt. Outside, the bear had her pinned on the dirt, its massive paws pressing down. Jacqueline fought, swinging her fists at its snout, her face pale but fierce. “Get off her!” I screamed, charging. I drove the knife into its side, once, twice, three times, each stab harder than the last. The bear snarled, swiping at me. Its claws caught my arm, and I heard a sickening crack as pain shot through me. My arm hung limp, but I kept stabbing, aiming for its face.The knife found its eye, sinking deep. The bear roared, rearing back, thrashing wildly, blood streaming from its face. Jacqueline crawled free, gasping, her leg torn, blood pooling beneath her. “I’m okay,” she choked out, but her voice was weak, her eyes wide with shock.The bear staggered, blinded in one eye, then lumbered into the trees, crashing through branches. I dropped beside her, my hands shaking as I touched her face. Her skin was cold, too cold. “You’re okay, you’re okay,” I said, more to myself than her. Blood soaked her pant leg, and her breathing was shallow, ragged. I pressed my hand against the wound, trying to stop the bleeding, but it seeped through my fingers.“We need to get to the main campsite,” I said, forcing my voice to stay steady. “It’s five kilometers. Can you walk?”She nodded, wincing. “I… I’ll try.”I helped her up, my own pain screaming with every move. My side felt like it was tearing apart, and my arm was useless, dangling at my side. We stumbled to the kayaks, the lake stretching out like a black void. I helped her into her kayak, tying it to mine so she wouldn’t drift. “Hold on,” I said, grabbing the paddle. “We’re getting help.” I pushed off, the paddle digging into the water, each stroke sending jolts of pain through my cracked ribs.The lake was silent, too silent, and every splash felt like it echoed forever. I kept talking to keep her awake. “Stay with me, Jacqueline. Tell me about the waterfall.”“It’ll… be beautiful,” she said, her voice faint, slurring. “Like… a painting.”“Yeah,” I said, my throat tight. “The most beautiful thing we’ve ever seen. Keep talking, okay?”She tried, her words fading. “You… you’ll take a picture… right?”“Every angle,” I promised, tears burning my eyes. I glanced back, and her kayak wobbled, her head slumped forward. “Jacqueline!” I shouted, paddling faster. She didn’t answer. I tied her kayak tighter and kept going, my arms shaking, my vision blurring with pain and fear. The main campsite’s lights appeared, faint pinpricks in the distance. It felt like years before we reached the shore.I dragged her kayak onto the rocks, screaming for help. My voice cracked, hoarse. A ranger ran over, his flashlight bobbing. “What happened?” he asked, his face paling as he saw Jacqueline’s still form and my blood-soaked clothes.“Bear,” I gasped, collapsing beside her. “It attacked us. She’s hurt bad. Please.”He dropped to his knees, checking her pulse, then grabbed his radio. “Emergency at main camp. We need a medevac, now!” He started CPR, pressing her chest, but her body didn’t move. Her hand was cold in mine, her fingers limp. I whispered her name, over and over, willing her to open her eyes.The helicopter came, its blades cutting through the night. They loaded me onto a stretcher, but I barely noticed. My eyes stayed on Jacqueline, lying still on the ground, covered with a blanket. The ranger’s voice was gentle, too gentle. “I’m sorry,” he said. “She’s gone.”In the hospital, they stitched me up—over 300 stitches for the gashes on my side and arm. My ribs were cracked, my arm fractured. They said I was lucky to survive. I didn’t feel lucky. I had lost the love of my life. Later, they gave me a medal, the Star of Courage, for fighting the bear. It sits in a drawer, untouched. Rangers tracked the bear and killed it, saying it was a rare predator, not just after food. They found it a mile from our camp, still bleeding from its eye.I can’t go back to the wilderness. The lake, the trees, the quiet—they haunt me. Every night, I hear that growl, see those gleaming eyes, feel Jacqueline’s hand slip from mine. The scars on my body are nothing compared to the ones inside. I keep her paddle, the one she used that last day, propped against the wall. It’s all I have left of her, and it’s not enough.",1,1750211871.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

1le5801,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1le5801/things_arent_that_fun_anymore_what_do_i_do/,Things aren’t that fun anymore what do I do,"Don’t say it’s depression. It’s not. I just don’t have much excitement anymore. The things that make me happy are just staying home, doing stuff on my computer, buying new clothes online, doing my skin care routine, straightening my hair, listening to music, having a good body, sleeping whenever I want, watching my shows or scrolling TikTok, trading stocks, and sex. I do have times where I’m content and happy but it’s all in the comfort of my home. It’s not like I’m here feeling 100% miserable. 

I’m a housewife and idk like it just doesn’t seem worth it to get ready just to have a mediocre time. I used to think maybe it’s money but even that sounds boring outside of my home. Get a nice car? Used to be exciting. Now it’s boring. Going to the mall? Going shopping? I hate being around people I hate having to stress to get ready and possibly hating how I look all for a boring time. Coffee shops are kind of worth it but only at night I hate being around people I don’t know why I hate being around a bunch of people so much. I absolutely hate any kind of parties or going to weddings. It’s so much effort. Get ready, drive, pretend like you care when you don’t. The beach got boring too

Then all the stuff that could possibly make me happy cost a lot of money. Going to the fair MIGHT make me happy but getting ready and risking it isn’t worth it. Getting a nice hotel sounds fun but costs money. Traveling sounds fun but costs money. Sex is fun but it’s not so fun when your husband is stressed and it doesn’t feel fun and passionate and exciting and he’s too stressed to try new things when I talk to him about it. I would never try wearing lingerie to excite him just to save me the embarrassment of looking desperate or getting a casual reaction out of him. It’s just the same boring routine every time. So I’ve just given up on trying to make things exciting. We aren’t even old we are 25/26 years and we met around 3 years ago.

I don’t know where to find enjoyment. I used to get so happy doing the simplest things outside of the house. Now I feel like maybe weed or alcohol would bring some excitement but that isn’t really a good solution. Maybe going on walks at night just for that nostalgia feeling I used to get. Looking pretty feels good.  If I had friends here I’d enjoy if they came over and we hung out but my friends are back in my state.

But idk like most people would enjoy going to a nice restaurant or going shopping or visiting a pretty site seeing area or seeing friends but to me it’s so boring.  I don’t know how to feel excited about the simple things anymore because everything feels so mediocre

So I started as a paralegal in the beginning of June, it’s my first time as a paralegal and I do enjoy it. However, I’m still learning and feel so unexperienced. 

The two paralegals that are in the firm right now are leaving. One is for materiality leave (totally understandable) and the second paralegal will be leaving in the middle of August due to attending law school. 

So… it’s just gonna be me & the attorney working. But I just started and thought I would have someone else with me. 

I’ve been asking so many questions and feel like I’ve learned a ton. Just overall anxious that I am going to mess up. 

The attorney knows this is my first time as a paralegal, and I do want to stay for the experience. 

What do you guys think? It’s uncertain if the paralegal will come back from maternity leave, they’ve been debating it. 

Both paralegals also said they will leave me a step-by-step instruction on how to do everything. I just don’t want to mess up. I’m gonna be alone, besides the interns that show up once-in-a-while. 

I need so much advice, comfort, and/or coffee. Whichever is the best lmao. All of this has been built-up and I don’t want to look unexperienced.

It's just that I've been seeing a lot of posts about the cost of food pop up in my feed, and being from Eastern Europe, I am quite surprised about the items that people are buying (who in their posts clearly state that they have very limited budgets). And of course people can buy whatever they want, but maybe they haven't considered recipes from other cultures.

Example: people buying sausages / hot dogs / wieners on a budget. It's much more efficient to buy a soup hen or chicken parts.

Another example: sauces / ketchup, etc. This is also more expensive. It's much cheaper to buy tomatoes on sale. Take some tomatoes, cut them up, microwave them on low power. Then mash them. I do always use that on pasta / for pizza making.

Juice: this is really not a cheap item and it's not essential. It's also cheaper to just mix water with some squeezed out juice from a slice of lemon. One lemon is enough to make a lot of flavored drinks because it has a strong taste. A lemon can last me more than a week. Sometimes I also squeeze a slice of an orange. In Eastern Europe a very common drink is just black tea with lemon. I think the first time I ever tried juice was only when I came to Canada.

Main meals: soup. For me, since I felt conscious, I remember eating soup. I've eaten soup almost every day of my life. Both of my grandmothers always made soup, my parents make soups, and I make soups about twice a week. A basic soup would be with a soup hen or chicken parts. Usually these can be found for under $10 for a whole pot. The next main ingredients are onions, potatoes, and carrots. I also add peas or lentils. A large pot of soup costs me under $20, and me and my kids eat it every day. 

Cereals - cereal boxes are extremely expensive, if you are on a budget, this is a bad choice. Oatmeal is definitely cheaper. I eat oatmeal every morning, my children as well. I usually add soy milk to it. Also raisins, nuts, berries, etc. We also eat a lot of buckwheat.

Red meat - I never buy it and it's also an expensive item. I think if you are on a very tight budget, it's really not necessary. When I was growing up, we had red meat maybe once a month. Our sources of iron and B vitamins were always organ meats like chicken liver or soup with chicken hearts. Chicken organ means are way cheaper than red meat and they contain even more iron and B vitamins.

Salads - I think salads are really a luxury item. I only had salads in the summer when I was growing up, and I think they are really not necessary. It's possible to get all vitamin requirements from just eating soups, organ meats, oatmeal, and some fruits like oranges. It's much more cost efficient to buy frozen vegetables and make soup than to buy fresh greens for a salad.

In general, I spend on food less than $800 per month (myself + 2 kids). Our regular day is: morning is oatmeal or buckwheat with soy milk and frozen berries + a slice of cheese. All other meals are soup + slices of tomatoes and cucumbers + oranges. For protein - chicken in the soup or fried chicken liver with onions. Sometimes I also get canned sardines or canned oysters for the omega 3. We eat soup with bread / bagels. I have to eat gluten-free, so mine are more expensive than average.  
Drinks - I drink only water and black tea, sometimes coffee. Kids drink water, soy milk, sometimes regular milk.

I saw a lot of posts where people were asking how to spend less on food and I think the main issues are: they are buying red meat, juices, pop, processed foods, cereal boxes, cookies, sauces, raw vegetables, a lot of dairy. All of this really adds up. ",155,1750211483.0,PersonalFinanceCanada,124,0.81,False

1le52zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwho/comments/1le52zs/my_notes_page_for_the_time_warrior/,My notes page for The Time Warrior,"This Irongron guy is an absolute twat.

Cool how the ship falls from the sky and they think it’s a fallen star, though it's a big metal sphere. 

Sontaran (Linx) uses dial on suit before speaking, presumably to auto-translate. He uses laser to disintegrate Irongron’s sword. He plants a flag in the ground and claims the planet and its moon as part of the greater glory for the Sontaran expire. 

However, Linx needs to repair his ship so barters with the humans for their help. He introduces a shotgun to the medieval King—a little odd the Sontaran would have a shotgun.

Sarah is a sneaky bastard! She’s introduced as “Livinia Smith” a “virologist” but the Doctor notices her age and says her paper was remarkable given she wrote it when she was five years old. She confesses her aunt is Livinia and she is taking her place (in this top secret job) for fun as a journalist. 

Doc dismisses her immediately, saying at least she can make him coffee.

Irongron’s neighbours (Sir Edward) are sick of his shit and want to fight him. He sends a messenger but no one knows how to read so they just chuck him in prison XD. Lixn uses a laser truth serum.

Irongron: *“You like war, eh?”* Linx: “*Who does not? My race has been at war for millennia. There is not a galaxy in the universe which our space fleets have not subjugated.”*

In modern day, people and equipment are vanishing from this secret lab, and Doc figured out it’s a matter transmitter paired with time-travel. Presumably the Sontaran is using it to retrieve equipment for his ship—they did say the lab was working on secret space travel technology.

Poor Sarah, having snuck into the TARDIS as Doc follows the Sontaran’s trail, steps out into the middle-ages and expresses bewilderment before being captured by Irongron’s men.

The Sontaran face reveal is epicly disgusting.

Linx takes a moment to understand that Sarah is a female; Sontarans reproduce asexually; he calls sexual reproduction inefficient.

Linx has a life-sized remote-controlled knight. They halt the execution of a prisoner so he can try to fight it, however Doc shoots the control, causing the knight to go rogue. Irongron wallops off its head.

Llinx says, “*The variety of sentient life forms is infinite. Do you think your primitive features are pleasing to me*?” upon being asked if all aliens are ugly like him.

Doc is doing a lot of sneaking around, lurking behind the scenes. He discovers Linx is mind-controlling a bunch of people, both from the medieval and modern times, to work on repairing his ship. One guy isn’t controlled due to blindness, Doc deducing the mind-control is visual. He mentions the “*perpetual war between the Sontarans and the Rutans*.” Llinx says he only had the power to reach the 20th Century with his time matter-transmitter device.

Sarah, safe with Sir Edward, concludes Doc is working with the Sontaran with his time machine. She straight-up leads a raid on Irongron’s castle to recapture Doc.

Doc is angry that Linux is interfering with human evolution, introducing advanced technology. I’m still sceptical of a Sontaran having shotguns, or a remote-control knight, but it’s entertaining—perhaps Linx creates them specifically for Irongron.

Very cool long-take action scene with a birds-eye wide-shot of Doc fighting Irongron's warriors, even if following each individual warrior looks hilariously silly.

Typical Doctor moment: Sarah says, “*How do I know you’re telling the truth*?” Doc says, “*Because I never lie … well, hardly ever*.” Later on, Sarah says, *“You’re serious, aren’t you?”* Doc says, *“About what I do, yes, not necessarily the way I do it.”*

Linx says, “*The greater the odds, the greater the glory.*” Irongron enthusiastically slaps Linx on the back and Linx jolts—foreshadowing? Doc says, “*Sontarans can’t resist getting involved in war … this is something to keep him amused, to stop him getting bored.”* 

Doc cleverly sets up dummies to look like the castle is heavily guarded, but Linx quickly deduces this. When they start scaling the walls, Doc casually throws over his epic home-made stink bombs.

Linx calls out Irongron’s hypocrisy in fleeing, and easily beats him in combat. Irongron’s ego is fuming! Funny when Doc arrives at the castle in disguise as Friar, guards tell him Irongrod is a *“kindly and charitable man*.”

Doc and gang immobilise Linx by hitting the thing on his back.They get to work, retrieving everyone from the mind control and beginning to send them back to modern day. Doc dresses up as the robot knight to stop Irongron from intruding. Sarah gets to work poisoning the castle’s food with a sleeping potion to stop them intruding.

Doc has a sword fight with Irongrong. He also swings Tarzan-style from a chandelier but he casually walks out the castle with Sarah. He says it was *“one of the most active days I’ve had in years -  not as though I’m a lad anymore, once you’re over two hundred.”* Implies he is getting old, rather than still being in his youth at Doc 3. 

The sleeping potion kicks in (like in Sleeping Beauty) so that Doc can return to the castle without being attacked, and everyone gets returned home safely. However, Linx’s ship starts taking off early as he is shot and falls on controls, so everyone hurriedly exits the castle. Luckily the sleeping men are roused in time. It is not shown whether Irongron’s allies managed to escape the castle before it exploded. Doc of course cared about getting everyone out safely (even Irongron). We do see Irongron be killed by Linx though.

Day one was a gentle introduction for two old farts who had little long distance hiking experience.

We caught the train to Milngavie for the ‘true’ WHW experience, while our wives drove from Glasgow.

A local primary school was having some sort of running event and the High Street pedestrian area was crowded with kids and families

A quick snack and a coffee at Costa and we were on our way.

I learned afterwards that the ‘wee house’ near Dumgoyne actually houses a geocache.

The weather was kind to us today. Blue sky occasionally broke through. A fair few people on the trail. Lunch at the Beech Tree.

I got a hot spot on my right sole just after Gartness. Despite cooling my feet in a stream and padding the hot spot, it turned into a 3/4 inch blister. I limped the last mile or so into Drymen,where we enjoyed a well-earned pint at The Clachan while we waited for our wives.

We stayed at a lovely Air BnB just outside of Drymen. We stayed several nights in each location to give the wives a base to stay explore from while they waited for us to call them for pickup at the end of each day.

Loved the license plate on The Drymen Inn van.

The last photo is of the very friendly cat at our Drymen accommodation.

 When we both had to go she fist bumped me. Basically means I'm cooked. She only sees me as a friend which REALLY sucks.

The previous time I got shut down was a girl started messaging me on instagram. We talked for a couple days and asked her out to coffee, she said yes (big shocker I know, shocks me too). We had a good time, or I thought we did. Next day she says "" I had a good time and it's not gonna work"". I was hurt and started replaying everything in my mind what I possibly could have done wrong.

I wanted to share my departure experience leaving KIX (Kansai International Airport near Osaka), as most mentions I could find on this subreddit about leaving from this airport made it sound like it would be a nightmare. And thankfully, it wasn’t! Everything went well!

My flight left at 6:40 am in the morning, with an itinerary first to Haneda then on to the USA. Instead of trying to get to the airport so early, I decided to get a hotel near the airport with a shuttle in the morning provided. I stayed at OMO hotel nearby, it did the job well enough. 

I left the hotel on their 5 am shuttle, was at the airport by 5:10/5:15 am. There were really only two departures during the hour I left, both of which were to Tokyo, so it seemed pretty empty inside the airport. The JAL counter opened at 5:30 am, and I finished up at their counter by 6:10 am (I was towards the back of the line so that’s why it took more time). Security was very quick and simple, no line. 

I would have liked to have more time to get a coffee or look through some stores, but because I was towards the end of the check in and baggage line, I didn’t have as much time when I was past security. 

Overall, it was a pretty easy experience!

Hi everyone,
I'm writing here because the past is coming back, and I really need to know if I was the asshole in this situation.
Sorry in advance if I make any mistakes in English — I'm German.

I'm a 26-year-old guy, and about three years ago I started dating my ex-girlfriend (25F). I met her at a bar, we started hanging out, and after about a month we officially got together. I introduced her to my group of friends, she introduced me to hers, and we started spending our Saturday nights alternating: sometimes with my friends, sometimes with hers, and sometimes just the two of us.

In my friend group, there were three guys I considered my best friends. One of them, the one this story is mostly about, was someone I grew up with. We were really close.

After a while, he started asking my girlfriend to hang out with him, go to bars, and do things just the two of them. The first few times, I didn’t even hear it from him — she was the one who told me. That really bothered me, because I felt it was disrespectful not to be told directly.

I told both of them that it made me uncomfortable that they were spending time alone together. We talked about it and supposedly cleared things up.

Just to add some context, this friend was always known for being stingy with his car. Every time we asked him to drive somewhere, he would refuse and wait for someone else to pick him up. But when it came to seeing my girlfriend, suddenly his car was always ready to go. That alone felt off to me.

There were more things over time that I didn’t like. He often overstepped boundaries. On the night of her birthday, when the clock hit midnight, he turned to me and said, “Why don’t you kiss her?” I remember thinking, man, mind your own business.

We also had an argument about weed. He smoked, and he kept offering it to my girlfriend even though he knew it made me uncomfortable. I had told him before that it bothered me, but he kept doing it anyway.

After about a year and a half together, he started asking her out again — to grab coffee, go for walks, things like that. She told me he had asked, and she said she just needed to clear her head. She also said he had offered to help her practice driving for her license, which is really hard to get here in Germany.

I repeated again how much that made me uncomfortable. It felt like a clear intrusion, like he was trying to insert himself into our relationship.

At the same time, I was going through a serious health issue. My immune system was compromised and I couldn’t go out. I worked from home and barely saw my girlfriend or friends. She started getting frustrated with the fact that I wasn’t going out with her anymore. But it wasn’t like I didn’t want to — my doctor had literally told me not to go out or be around other people for health reasons.

Still, she got mad at me, blamed me, and kept going out with him, sometimes without even telling me. That really hurt.

About a month later, I fell into a major depressive episode. I completely lost myself. I couldn’t even recognize who I was anymore. I slowly isolated myself until I was completely alone. Being around people made me anxious. I started therapy and was put on psychiatric medication.

Then one day she messaged me and said she couldn’t take it anymore. She said the situation was too much for her and that she wanted to break up.

That was the end of the relationship.

About a month later, while I was still on medication and feeling numb, I checked social media. I saw her and my friend still going out together, constantly posting photos. Seeing that made me feel truly betrayed. It was like being stabbed in the gut.

He was still messaging me, asking how I was, if I wanted to talk, pretending to care. I ended up blocking both of them.

Now, after all this time, he messaged me again through another social media account that I hadn’t blocked.

So here I am, wondering if I was really the a**hole. I’d really appreciate your honest opinion.",3,1750210517.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

**Please Read Carefully. This Guide May Save Your Life.— Jeff & Geoff Real Estate**

**I flipped through it, expecting real estate fluff. Instead, I found this:**

#  The House Rules

**Location: Los Angeles, CaliforniaFloors: Two stories (never more!)Price: $50,000 (non-refundable if you die)Paranormal Activity Level: Medium**

#  1. FLOORS

* **The house has exactly two floors.**
* **If you see a third floor, do not enter. It is not real. Doing so will trap you for eternity.**
* **If a basement appears, exit immediately and contact us by mail. Do not re-enter without permission. You will only have one hour before your fate is sealed.**

#  2. COMMUNICATION

* **We only communicate via physical mail.**
* **Ignore phone calls, texts, or emails claiming to be from us. They are not us.**

# 3. WALLS

* **Blue walls are normal. Blue is safe. You are safe.**
* **If they turn yellow, the floors have reversed. The lower floors are fake. Go upstairs or leave within the hour, and avoid coming back to the area for the rest of the day.**
* **If they turn green, you are in the basement.** ***There is no way out.***
* **If they turn black, the house has rejected you. Leave immediately. You may be eligible for a new identity.**

#  4. STRANGERS

* **Blurry, faceless people may appear. Do not speak to or look at them.**
* **If provoked, they may remove your eyes.**

# 5. BEDTIME

* **Once in bed, stay there until 6 AM. Your shadow will leave your body and begin to wander the house, and will come back by morning.**
* **If the shadow finds you awake, pretend to sleepwalk or pass out.This may fool it. It will only attack if it notices you awake while out of your body.**

#  6. WALL WRITING

* **Do not read any wall markings. Doing so will permanently engrave things in your mind, and some things are better off unknown.**

#  7. FOOD

* **Do not touch the snack cabinet. Your roommates use it to store their secrets.**
* **The fridge is safe. It doesn’t want you.**

#  8. ROOMMATES

* **You will have three:**
   * **A tall, pale figure with many eyes. His name is ⨯⍜⎎⏃⏁⊑⍜⎍⌇⏃⋏⎅.He is docile unless you make eye contact with him, and due to how many eyes he has, you might as well just avoid looking at him altogether.**
   * **A doppelgänger who tries to lure you into fake floors. Ignore or avoid it. If aggressive, immediately leave the house for a week.**
   * **A shadow, controlled by something worse. If you see ⎎⏃⌰⌇⟒ ⊑⍜⌿⟒, you’re already dead.**

#  9. LIVING ROOM / WINDOWS

* **The living room is usually safe in the morning, as long as the windows are closed.**
* **Open windows act as invitations to ‘people’, which will have catastrophic consequences.**

#  10. VISITORS

* **Use the peephole.**
* **If they seem wrong (extra limbs, mismatched eyes), don’t answer and close the blinds.  They are the corpses pretending to be people you know, and are looking for a fresh skinsuit.**
* **If they look like your roommate, let them in. Delaying them will make them very angry.**

#  11. ANIMALS

* **Felix the cat: Do not let him in. He is the now stray cat of the owner who previously owned the house. He is blind but very aggressive, and he might think you are the person who killed his owner, which could lead to him attacking you.**
* **⏚⟟⍀⎅ the bird: Let him in if he taps. He belongs to ⨯⍜⎎⏃⏁⊑⍜⎍⌇⏃⋏⎅.**
* **Max the dog: He is safe. Whether you let him in or not is your choice.**

# 12. BATHROOM USE

* **Knock three times. It’s courtesy so your roommates know you are going to enter. They will take your sight if they catch you peeping.**
* **Leave within five minutes. The monster in the drain almost never gets to eat, so try not to take too long before it breaks through its constraints and eats you.**
* **If you feel as if you will take too long to use the bathroom, offer some blood to the drain. The more blood you feed it, the more you will keep it at bay.**
* **If your reflection ever lags, it's not you anymore. Break it immediately. It’s better to make your roommates mad than be sucked into the other world.**

# 13. SOBRIETY

* **Always stay in clear control of your mind. That means no drinking, drugs, or smoking. Staying sober is your best defense.**

# 14. GUESTS

* **If you invite someone, they must follow the rules. Or you’ll both suffer for what they do wrong.**

**There was even a handwritten post-it note inside:**

**“You’ll be fine! 😊 Most tenants survive the first month.”— Geof**f

**I read it twice. Laughed. It had to be some twisted promo gimmick — a haunted house LARP or something. Still, I was broke. No family. Few friends left in town. No credit. And no better options.**

**I signed.**

**The next week, I stood in front of Property #221.It looked exactly like the picture. Blue walls, white trim. Too quiet.**

**The key turned too easily.The door creaked like it had been waiting.**

**Inside, the air smelled like nothing at all.**

**I stepped over the threshold.**

**The door clicked shut behind me, and the air inside wrapped around my body like cold gauze.**

**The first thing I noticed was the silence.**

**No hum of traffic. No wind. No birds. Even my footsteps sounded strange — like they were being muffled on purpose.**

**The blue walls stretched around me, perfectly painted, almost too clean. It reminded me of a hospital waiting room. Sterile. Unlived in. I repeated the line from the guide in my head:**

***Blue is safe.***

**My suitcase wheels groaned against the floor as I made my way down the hall. There was a strange sensation under my skin — not quite fear. More like being watched by something polite enough not to look directly at me.**

**The living room had an ugly brown couch and a glass coffee table. A single dead fly sat in the center like it had been staged. I turned on the light.**

**Flicker. Buzz. Warm white glow.**

**Still no sound outside. The windows were closed. I left them that way.**

**I unpacked upstairs. The bedroom walls were blue too — a soft dusty shade that felt almost calming. The sheets were crisp. The mattress was cold. I found a toothbrush in the bathroom, identical to the one from the photo in the guide, just sitting there on the sink like it had been waiting for me. I left it untouched.**

**Before bed, I skimmed the guide again. This time I noticed a line I’d glossed over earlier:**

***“The living room is usually safe in the morning.”***

**Why specify “usually”?**

**I was about to turn the page when I heard it.**

**A soft knock.**

**Three quick raps, coming from inside the house — downstairs. Not the door. The wall? Maybe the living room? I told myself it was just the house settling. New wood creaks. Pipes groan. All houses make noises. But this wasn’t groaning or creaking. This was deliberate. Knock. Knock. Knock.**

**It repeated — same rhythm, same force. I walked downstairs slowly, the guide clenched in my hand. I rounded the corner into the living room. Empty. Blue walls. Closed windows. No visitors.**

**Then I saw it: the snack cabinet. It wasn’t there before. I was sure of it. Now it sat in the corner of the kitchen, half open. I took a step toward it. The guide’s warning rang in my head like a cold bell:**

***“Do not touch the snack cabinet. Your roommates use it to store their secrets.”***

**I stepped back. The knocking stopped. I backed out of the kitchen without turning my back on the cabinet. Something about it felt... warm. Breathing. Like a dog ready to leap. I didn’t sleep easily that night. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, the guide open beside me. At 1:12 AM, I heard something walk past my door. Slow. Heavy. Dragging one foot.**

**The shadow. I shut my eyes. Let my arm hang off the side like I was sleepwalking. Held my breath until it passed. At 6:00 AM, the sun cut through the blinds like a scalpel. I woke to the sound of footsteps — slow, deliberate, one foot dragging behind the other. But when I opened the bedroom door, the hallway was empty. Or… almost. There was a new staircase.**

**It rose from the second floor where the ceiling had once been flat — a third floor that shouldn’t exist. The guide’s warning came back instantly:**

***“If you see a third floor, do not enter. It is not real. Doing so will trap you for eternity.”***

**The staircase glowed faintly at the top. The walls were still blue — but a colder shade now, like ice. The air smelled metallic, like the inside of a battery.**

**I didn’t move. Just stared. Until something rustled behind me. I turned. He was standing in my bedroom. Tall. Pale. His head brushed the ceiling. He wore a black, perfectly fitted suit that looked ironed into his skin.And his eyes — so many eyes — lined his neck, wrists, chest, and face in uneven spirals. Some were large and wet. Others blinked rapidly, like they were panicking.**

**He looked directly at me. I froze. My chest tightened like it was wrapped in wires. I remembered the rule.**

***“He is docile unless you make eye contact with him”***

**I dropped my gaze to the floor, breathing slowly through my teeth. One of his eyes — I think — let out a soft wheeze.**

**I said, “Sorry.” He tilted his head like a curious crow, and slowly walked past me — each footstep too long, too slow, like he was unlearning gravity with every step. He walked toward the third floor, but didn’t climb it. He just stared up. A moment later, he vanished. Not like a light switch — more like film dissolving. Pieces gone, then the rest.**

**I locked the bedroom door. Sat on the floor. Read the guide again, front to back. Blue is safe. Blue is safe. Blue is safe.**

**It wasn’t until late morning that I met the second one. I had just brushed my teeth — carefully, no mirror issues — and headed down the stairs to get food. When I reached the kitchen, I was already there. Me. Same hair. Same face. Same hoodie.Standing by the fridge, pouring orange juice into a mug like he’d always lived here.**

**He looked up and smiled. “Finally up, huh?” I didn’t answer. “You forgot the toast,” he added, and pointed to the toaster. “I made some. It’s yours.” I stepped backward. Reached for the guide in my back pocket with trembling fingers. The page was already open:**

\*\*\*“\*\*\***A doppelgänger who tries to lure you into fake floors. Ignore or avoid it. If aggressive, immediately leave the house for a week.”**

**The doppelgänger noticed. His smile faded. “That’s not polite,” he said. Then he reached toward the snack cabinet. “No!” I barked — out of reflex, out of panic. He froze. I should have run.But I did the stupid thing. I grabbed the nearest object — a ceramic cup — and threw it at his face.**

**Direct contact. The rules didn’t say what happens if you attack them. He didn’t flinch. He just blinked — and his pupils turned black and wet and wide, like swallowing holes. He whispered, “Mistake.” Then he dissolved.**

**I locked myself in the bathroom. Knelt beside the toilet. Tried not to throw up. When I washed my face, the mirror lagged behind me — just a second, maybe less. I smashed it with the soap dish.**

**When I came back out, the hallway walls had darkened a few shades. Not black — not yet — but close. And the third floor was still there, yawning wide, waiting.**

**I stayed in my room most of the day, lights off, guide clutched like scripture. The walls were still blue, though just barely — they’d taken on a dim, smoky hue, like the color of old bruises. By 3 PM, I had to use the bathroom. I knocked three times, even though I was alone. Waited. No sound. I entered.**

**Blue walls. Safe. So far. The air inside was damp, humid in a way that felt unnatural for a house with no running showers. I set my phone on the counter, cut my palm with a pocketknife — just a quick nick — and let the blood run into the sink drain for five seconds, like the guide said. The sink gargled. Accepted the offering. I started brushing my teeth. I had set a mental timer — five minutes, the max before the drain monster starts to notice.**

**Two minutes in, I heard something wet shifting under the tub. Slap. Drag. Slap. Drag. My mouth was full of foam. I spat into the sink. The sound got louder — like something large and boneless was pulling itself through a pipe too narrow for its body.**

**I panicked. Froze. By the time I opened the door, I knew I’d gone past five minutes. Behind me, the tub ticked — like a fingernail tapping the inside of the drain.**

**When I stepped into the hallway, the phone rang. Not a ringtone. A landline.Except... I didn’t have a landline. It rang from downstairs. I could hear the echo off the tile.The guide throbbed in my back pocket.**

***“Ignore phone calls, texts, or emails claiming to be from us. These are not us.”***

**I didn’t answer it. The ringing stopped after four tries. Then someone knocked on the front door.**

**Once.Twice.Three times.Pause.Once again.**

**I crept down the stairs. The third floor still hovered above, looming like a spider’s nest. At the bottom, I peeked through the peephole. There was a man on the porch. Early thirties. Clean-shaven. Friendly smile. Dressed like a real estate agent. He waved at the peephole.**

**I nearly opened the door — but stopped myself. Something was… off. His arms were just slightly too long. The fingers too thin. One of his shoes was on the wrong foot. Backward. The guide again:**

\*\*\*“\*\*\***If they seem wrong (extra limbs, mismatched eyes), don’t answer and close the blinds.  They are the corpses pretending to be people you know, and are looking for a fresh skinsuit.”**

**I locked the deadbolt. The man stood there, still waving. His smile stretched. Then he slowly tilted his head, resting it on his shoulder — but in the wrong direction, like he was folding. He mouthed something I couldn’t hear. Then he vanished — did not walk away — just blinked out like an overexposed photo.**

**I sat back against the door, shaking. That was three rule-related events in under two hours. I wasn’t surviving. I was being tested. And then... I felt it again. That pressure. Like being stared at. I turned. He was standing halfway down the stairs to the second floor. The tall figure. The thousand-eyed man. This time, he was closer. Much closer.**

**One of his hands brushed the stair rail, dragging lazily. His suit shimmered like oil on water. His eyes blinked at different speeds — some slow and weeping, others twitching like startled animals. I dropped to the ground. Covered my face. But I was too slow. Just for a second — one of his eyes met mine.**

**And I saw—**

**—Myself in a kitchen that wasn’t mine, with blood dripping from the cabinets.—Myself buried beneath the snack cabinet.—Myself climbing the third floor and never returning.—Myself as the man at the door, smiling through the wrong teeth.**

**I screamed. When I looked again, he was gone. My nose was bleeding. My ears rang. My vision flickered at the edges. I stumbled upstairs and collapsed on the bed.**

**When I woke, the mirror in the bathroom was whole again. Even though I had shattered it. The house hadn’t killed me yet. That counted for something. After four days of walking on eggshells and bloodstains, I finally snapped. I needed someone else to witness this place — to tell me I wasn’t losing my mind.**

**So I invited friends. Just two: Eli and Jamie. Old college friends, the kind you don’t need to impress. I didn’t tell them the full truth, just enough to get them here. “I’m losing it in this place,” I said. “Just come by for the night. Please.” They agreed.**

**They arrived around six. Sunlight slanted across the blue walls like gold on bruises. For once, the air didn’t feel like poison. “Dude,” Jamie said as they stepped inside. “Why is it so quiet in here?”**

**“Sound doesn’t stick,” I muttered. “Like everything’s padded.” They laughed. I tried to. I showed them the guide — not everything, just the basics. Told them the rules were real, no matter how stupid they sounded.**

**Jamie smirked. “Snack cabinet? Mirror monsters? Are you sure you’re not just lonely?” “I’m sure,” I said. I should’ve made them read the entire thing.I should’ve made them memorize it.**

**They were in the living room talking about old friends when I stepped away to the bathroom — just for a moment. I knocked three times. Waited. Entered. Blue walls. I ran the tap and let a few drops of blood slip down the drain.**

**Behind me, something rustled inside the mirror. I didn’t look. When I came out, the house was different. The light had shifted. The blue walls had deepened into a murky navy. The air buzzed, faintly, like an old television left on with no picture. And there was now a door on the floor. A basement hatch. Right in the middle of the hallway. Wide open.**

**“Guys!” I shouted. No answer. I ran to the living room. Empty. Then I heard voices. Faint. Muffled. Below. “Eli? Jamie?” A laugh — Jamie’s.**

**I leaned over the hatch and stared into blackness.Stairs led down into the dark, coiled like intestines. That’s when I heard it: My own voice. “I’m down here!” it called.“I found something! Come check it out!”**

**But I hadn’t said anything. I backed away slowly. The air above the hatch rippled like heat. Then I saw movement in the corner. Me — or something that looked like me — standing at the base of the stairs, smiling up with eyes too wide. Jamie called down again. “Dude, why didn’t you wait?” I whispered, “Don’t go down there.” But it was too late. I heard their footsteps on the stairs. Laughter. Then confusion. Then nothing.**

**I screamed into the hatch. No answer. Just cold air. The guide was still in my pocket.**

***“If a basement appears, exit immediately and contact us by mail. Do not re-enter without permission. You will only have one hour before your fate is sealed.”***

**I sat by the hatch for what felt like hours. The air tasted like metal and old rain. The hole never changed. Just blackness and silence. I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t leave. Couldn’t save them. I just waited. At some point, the door slowly closed itself. The basement was gone.**

**The hatch never should have vanished. That’s what haunted me most. One moment it was there. My friends were inside. Screaming, maybe. Lost.Then — gone. Like the house had changed its mind. I didn’t sleep that night. I sat in the hallway with the lights on, watching the spot where the basement had been, waiting for it to open again. Waiting for anything. Sometime around 8 PM, the lights flickered. Then I heard the voice. Jamie’s voice.**

**“Dude. You coming or what?”**

**From the floor. The carpet split open like torn flesh. Beneath it: the** **hatch. Open** **again. Gaping wider than before. This time, it pulled me in. Not like gravity — like intent. Like the house had a hand wrapped around my ribs and was tugging downward. I tried to claw at the floorboards, but they snapped like wet paper. I fell into the dark.**

**There were no stairs this time. Just endless descent — like sinking through molasses and oil. I couldn't see my limbs. I wasn’t even sure I had any. Then I landed. The floor wasn’t solid, but it wasn’t liquid either. It breathed beneath me. The walls were green.**

***“If the walls are green, you are in the basement. There is no escape.”***

**I knew that. But I didn’t believe it. Not yet. I started walking. Shapes flickered past me. Hallways that twisted, doors that opened onto themselves. Sometimes I’d hear Jamie or Eli — crying, or laughing, or whispering things that made no sense.**

**“Your eyes are leaking.”“I followed the wrong you.”“It’s not painful”**

**I turned a corner. And the Shadow was there. Not a figure. Not exactly.Just a mass of black, tall and wide and endless — a silhouette that didn’t obey shape, like it was constantly changing, growing, shrinking, bleeding into the walls.**

**Behind it, something pulsed. A symbol on the wall:**

**⎎⏃⌰⌇⟒ ⊑⍜⌿⟒**

**The name I wasn’t supposed to see.The one from the guide.The entity behind the Shadow. The air burned. The green walls blinked — and I saw eyes. Hundreds of them. Not like the pale man’s. These eyes were hungry, open mouths shaped like vision.**

**Then I saw them. Jamie and Eli. Their bodies were… wrong. Folded, stretched, pressed into corners that didn’t exist. One of them was still breathing. Maybe. Maybe not. The Shadow moved. It came toward me without footsteps. The air around it screamed. Not loud — just violently quiet, like sound had died there.**

**I ran. No direction. Just motion.The basement changed as I moved. Hallways collapsed, walls stretched. Doors opened into rooms full of teeth. And then— A staircase. A real one. Wood, blue-walled. Real. I didn't think. I climbed.**

**The Shadow chased me, slow and massive, always just behind me but never far enough. My vision flickered. Blood ran from my ears. I screamed and it came out sideways, like the sound slipped behind me. But I reached the top. The hatch slammed behind me as I collapsed on the hallway floor.**

**It was morning again. The windows were closed. The fridge hummed.The house looked… normal. Mostly. Except the walls were still a little green around the edges. My phone was on the kitchen counter. A single envelope sat beside it. No stamp. No return address. Just the wax seal: J & G.  I opened it with shaking hands.**

**Congratulations! You survived Property #221.**

**We’re sorry to hear your guests did not adhere to the Occupant Protocols.**

**As a returning tenant, we’re pleased to offer you early access to one of our new properties:**

* **6 rooms, one floor.**
* **$75,000.**
* **Forest adjacency.**
* **Only slightly haunted.**
* **Located in Florida**

**Would you like to schedule a visit?**

**At the bottom:**

**\[ \] Yes\[ \] No**

**My hands trembled.**

**But I couldn’t tell if it was from fear — or relief.**",1,1750210486.0,ScaryStory,0,1.0,False
1le4t3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1le4t3q/aio_for_wanting_to_move_out_and_leave_after_my_bf/,AIO for wanting to move out and leave after my bf walked out on me," Sorry for the long post For context me and my 2 daughters moved in with my bf in Jan. 90% of the time everything is great and i have honestly never been with anyone i love more or makes me happier. My girls also realy love him. Everyone just kind of instantly meshed. Prior to this we were in a hotel for about a year. 

The good: he is kind most of the time. Very caring loving and affectionate. He is the type of person that says his only job in life is to provide for me and his girls (his daughter and my 2). He tells me how happy i make him all the time. He can look at me in full on bum mode messy hair food stained clothes and call me beautiful with so much love in his eyes. He's sweet and adorable  and a huge kid in a playful way when he's happy. I do most of the cooking cleaning etc.. with the exception of the girls doing chores. But he is more than happy and willing to help out. He does everything to take care of me and the house when I'm not feeling well or just too tired. And yes he still works full time 5 to 6 days a week. 


So here's the issue: BF has anger control issues. Not the type where I fear for my physical safety or he gets violent but he says mean hurtful things when he's mad. And he gets mad easy. Like i never know if something will make him crash out. One day he could make a joke about lights being left on or cabinets being lwft open the next he could spaz out about it and say he's taking all the bulbs. Or one time he freaked about one single shred of cheese from a taco being on the coffee table saying there was food all over the table calling the kids lazy (to me not them) 
Hebhas never called me out my name but he gets close saying i say stupid shit just to annoy him or ruin his day. It usually ends with me apologizing and being told im too self deprecating or playign the victim again. The arguments always start over something petty or a misunderstanding.

So today is day 2 of an argument that started like this yesterday

Me: dude at the phone store pissed me off 

Him: what happened 

Me: starts expalining (but doesnt get to finish because he cuts me off which he gets so pissed when i do it)

Him: offering a solution ok dont pay the next phone bill...

Me: (before he finishes) but then we wont have phones

Him: (instanly get pissed) no shit sherlock how about you lets me finish... more condescending things

Me: starts yelling at him about how mean and disrespectful he gets when hes amd and how i said nothing to deserve him talking to me like that

Him: you insulted my intelligence by stating the obvious (my comment about the phone) and more yelling

This escalated into him scream fk you and some other things i didnt hear and me slamming the door and going to sit in the car. Basically didnt talk he rest of the night other than a pathetic goodnight and an offhanded comment from him about how he cant say anything to me because it mean and disrespectful 

Tried to talk this morning and i tried explaining i wasnt insulting his intelligence and even apologized his take on it hasn't changed and he said the way he talked to me was just him giving what he was getting from me. A lot of back and forth about how i never talked to him like that and a lot of yelling... then him saying he's not going to come home if this is what he has to deal with. I start crying ask if he's breaking up with me. This leads to more yelling and him getting in my face saying im playing victim again because he never said that.

I get home he's here i ask how can we fix this... lot of blah blah blah i say im just trying to make us better him saying sometimes you just need to stop because it only makes it worse i say ok I'll stop trying he says there you go saying  stupid shit again...arguement blah blah him im just gonna pack a bag and leave i tell him doing that is goingto make it worse...him and yet you'restill talking. 

 I get in the shower he's gone

So AIO for wanting to pack up me and the kids and just be gone by the time he decides he's ready to come home

TLDR BF and i have been arguing for 2 day over a comment he found offensive but i explained it wasnt. After arguing agaun today he decided he was going to oack a bag and leave to egt some peace. No i want to move me and the kids out. 

UPDATE: He came back within 5 minutes of me posting this. He was gine less rhan an hour. We are still not speaking, he sat in the room and played his game for a bit not he's in the living room actively avoiding me and not talking to me. He back so not sure if i should still be considering going. Pretty sure he just went and bought cigarettes for the first time in months. ",4,1750210418.0,AmIOverreacting,36,0.84,False
1le4srd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1le4srd/aitah_for_killing_my_gfs21f_brother/,"AITAH for ""killing"" my gf's(21f) brother?","This is a throwaway account because this is honestly embarrassing and I don't want my family to find out haha lol. 

Context: I (18f) recently met this girl (21f) while I was hanging out on the beach. Both of us like swimming, so we connected right away. We got coffee together and eventually started dating. We've been together for a little over three months now and it has been going swimmingly (pun intended). The problems started when I met her brother (32m) who is a total jerk. He doesn't care at all about the environment which is problematic to me because I am passionate about the ocean, I basically live in it. Also, he is so obnoxious that he wears a cape constantly (even while surfing) like he thinks he's some kind of superhero. I told my girlfriend (21f) that I don't like him, but she didn't understand what “my problem” was. So then the main problem came up.

It was when we were all at my gf’s (21f) parents house having dinner, I was scared her parents wouldn't like me because I have a more wild fashion sense, and her family is pretty trad. As soon as I walked in, her parents said that I seemed really smart. Her brother said, “I don't care how smart she is. A freak’s a freak.” This was really offensive to me because that's somewhat homophobic, and I was scared he was also judging my fashion style. I was also upset that her parents had thought I was smart just by looking at me (because of racist stereotypes) and I must have shown that I was offended, because my girlfriend (21f) stepped in and said that it was offensive, and made him apologize. I could tell he didn't mean it though.

Now, just a week ago, he came to our place for dinner. My gf (21f) had probably hoped it had all blown over, but I was still really angry. I have faced a lot of prejudice in my life just because of how I look. I have learned not to forgive people easily, because if you let them disrespect you they will just continue doing it. So, I decided to take revenge on him. I knew from my girlfriend (21f) that he was allergic to cumin so I decided to add some to the dish I was preparing. Not a lot, just enough to make him uncomfortable and give him a little scare so he knew exactly who he was dealing with.

The problem is, I didn't realize how allergic he was. Apparently he can't even be near someone who has eaten cumin in the past hour without getting a reaction, and the pinch of the spice that I added to his meal was enough to send him to the hospital. Now he is in a coma and it's unsure if he will make it. I feel really guilty because I feel like this is my fault, even though I didn't mean for it to happen and my girlfriend (21f) and her family are mad at me. So, AITA?

I just wanted to introduce myself and share how I’m helping to normalize men wearing leggings—while also embracing my own unique path along the way.

I’m a man who wears leggings every day, not just for workouts but as a central part of my identity. I live openly with incontinence and wear thick diapers under my leggings, often covered by plastic pants. That might sound unusual at first—but for me, it’s become a powerful symbol of self-acceptance. I pair them with sports bras, soft crop tops, oversized hoodies, and bright accessories like scrunchies and fun tote bags. My go-to scents are soft and bold: baby powder or Bois de Balincourt. And yes, I get compliments!

I present in a way that’s intentionally soft, feminine, and playful—without trying to hide the fact that I’m a man. I’ve learned that leggings don’t have a gender; they’re about confidence, comfort, and freedom. Whether I’m doing yoga, grabbing a coffee, or running errands, I wear my leggings proudly. The visibility matters.

Sometimes people ask me how I deal with the stares or questions. The answer is: with kindness, eye contact, and a little sparkle. I've even had store clerks and baristas compliment my outfit or lip gloss. The world’s not always as judgmental as we fear—and sometimes, it needs *us* to lead the way.

So to anyone wondering, “Can I wear leggings as a guy?” — Yes. You can. And if you need someone cheering you on, I’m right here.

Proudly padded. Softly confident. Living my truth in leggings.

1le4g9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1le4g9n/low_effort_during_initial_chat/,Low effort during initial chat,"I matched with someone on hinge. She seems nice and said she prefers to meet in person for a quick coffee rather than text much — says she doesn’t like texting and that I wouldn’t be seeing “the real her” that way.

Thing is, I had been trying to use texting as a bit of a filter — to gauge effort, vibe, and basic curiosity. She barely asked me anything and gave short replies. I felt like I was carrying the whole convo.

Now I’m conflicted. Part of me agrees with her — I don’t love texting either, and maybe in-person is the only real way to know. But another part of me is hesitant to meet a stranger who hasn't shown much initiative. I’ve been hurt before, and I don’t want to invest in someone who isn’t that interested.

Curious how others handle this:
Do you meet up with people even when texting is dry or one-sided?
Or is that a red flag for low interest/lack of effort?",0,1750209320.0,datingoverforty,49,0.46,False

From 55kg to 60kg to 65kg and now I'm 68kg last 2 months, I started to lessen my food intake, and I rarely drink sugary iced drink. Last month, I noticed a changed in my menstrual flow. It became light. For 12 hours, it can't even soak a pantyliner, it was very light. On the second day, it became medium flow with small clots. This is unusual for me because on my first day of menstruation specifically in 8 hours, it would already soak my whole underwear. Now, I had my period again and it was very light. It has been 17 hours and it was only spotting. I am starting to overthink. Is it possible that I'm having the lightest period because I drastically lessen my calorie intake?
