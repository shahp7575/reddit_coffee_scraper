- FIL is in his mid 70s, but still working as an engineer/consultant. He loves coffee and beer, hehe.

- SIL is a doctor in her mid 30s, single. Hindi ko masyadong alam ang ibang interests nya aside from watching musicals and Korean series and traveling.

Lately, I've been struggling with brain fog and fatigue, finding it hard to focus on even a single page without getting sidetracked. I've tried taking modafinil twice before, but it didn't work for me. This time around, I took 400 mg and felt a significant boost—I managed to get through a 200-page course in just an hour! However, I couldn't sleep that night. 

  
The following day, I opted for 300 mg, thinking it might not be effective, so I added coffee, green tea, piracetam, and tyrosine since I had a test coming up. That day was intense; I really experienced anxiety and stress for the first time, feeling overwhelmed and constantly worried. On the day of the test, I took only 200 mg and had coffee on an empty stomach, which made my anxiety spike again. 

  
I'm looking for suggestions on what I can take alongside modafinil to help manage my anxiety. I really don’t want to stop using it because I feel it could transform my life as a student and finally allow me to study effectively. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

We right away hit it off but we didn’t exchange numbers until I saw her sitting at the coffee shop near by before work. We started with small texts about a month ago then full on texting and calling each other, and talking on the way back home.

Two weeks ago I asked her to get coffee in the morning and now we do that regularly, then in it turned to always being together in lunch. Last week  I told her hey where are we going with this cause you’re cute and I can’t stop laughing around you, I want to get to know you but on another level. She sighed and said thank god I thought I was tripping but I wanted you to make the first move and say it. I had a sigh of relif

These past couple of days we have started talking more personal stuff and started meeting each other with hugs and even gave me a small peck.

I asked her if we can go on a dinner date today but she completely avoided the question when I asked her, and I repeated and didnt say anything. Right away red flags went off.

Literally first time ever having heartburn and it’s kind of painful. Tips ?,"Hi! Context. 4th day on ozempic. This morning I had a protein smoothie for breakfast and left the house to go pole dancing. Very intense class, following that I could feel I needed to eat something but struggled to pick from where outside. 
After the class, I went to pick up my toddler from daycare (lowkey starving) and then realised I had a dentist appointment in 20 and I wouldn’t manage to go home. 

On the way I looked at every shop but no options. Went home kinda 2pm. (Smoothie at 8:30am) by the time I was home I grabbed 180gr of salmon. Ate it and was literally so hungry, tried to wait like 2-5 minutes to see if I could chill a bit but I was very hungry. 
Ate half an avocado, 6 Christmas cookies and a coffee with milk. (Mind you it was 2 cookies in the beggining but I literally was so hungry plus my toddler shouting he wanted more 

Then 2 hours later, had one banana and the other half of the avocado (felt like I wanted food still so ate that before feeling hungrier). 

Now 2 hours after that I had a yogurt bowl with blueberries and like 20gr of oats. I could barely eat that, but is like inside me I was hungry. 

Thennnnn, full on bloating as in 7 months pregnant. And now insane heartburn. 

Tips? Is this because of all that stuff that I had to eat because of my long period of no food plus hard workout and 10k steps in getting from place A to B?

1pfecrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hellenism/comments/1pfecrh/thoughts_on_eating_offerings_in_hellenic/,Thoughts on eating offerings in Hellenic polytheism,"TL;DR:

In Hellenic polytheism, offerings are about giving, not reclaiming. Eating what you offered transforms a gift into self consumption and defeats the point of ritual reciprocity. Claims that offerings are ""wasteful"" often misunderstand or distort the nature of devotion. By that logic, every devotional act would be waste. Modern conditions generally make small offerings easier, not less meaningful. People can use votives or personal devotional acts if they can't offer food. Much of the online disagreement comes from conflating reconstructionist, revivalist, and eclectic approaches, with different goals and different frameworks rather than interchangeable practices.

——

In Hellenic practice, consuming an offering after you've given it is basically the same as making a plate for a friend and then pulling it back to eat yourself in front of them, or giving someone a gift and then taking it back once the moment passes. Who in your life would you say ""this is for you"" only to reclaim it?

Once you take it back, it's no longer a gift, only a performance. The meaning of giving depends entirely on the fact that you don't retrieve the thing you just gave.

The whole meaning of an offering is the act of giving, of surrendering something that was yours into a relationship that is not only about your convenience. If you hand it over and then reclaim it, you haven't offered something. You just moved it around and called it ""devotion"" after the fact. It defeats the entire purpose of offering.

(Household offerings work this way, they're not the same as public animal sacrifice, where part was burned for the gods and part was cooked and shared by the community. These are separate ritual categories. More on this at the end.)

And this is why the ""it's wasteful"" framing lands so strangely to me. An offering is not waste in the way throwing something away is waste. Waste is using a resource with no purpose. An offering is using a resource for a purposeful, sacred function. The point isn't that the gods need the food or the drink as calories, nobody serious about this believes the divine is hungry in a literal biological sense. The point is that the act of giving is the ritualized expression of relationship and reciprocity: I give, I acknowledge, I honor, I place something of value that no longer belongs to me as a gesture of respect and alignment with the divine order I am engaging with.

Once you define ""waste"" as ""anything given away that could have been used for human consumption,"" the logic doesn't stop at food and drink. It collapses the entire practice of worship. By that standard:

-a candle is waste (materials, labor)

-incense is waste (materials, labor)

-a votive object is waste (materials, labor, money)

-a statue is waste (it required resources to make and acquire)

-writing a hymn is waste (paper/ink, time and energy)

-making art is waste (materials, time, electricity if digital)

-even setting aside time to pray is ""waste"" (time could be used for something else)

-and the entire concept of ""devotional time"" becomes morally suspicious because time is also a resource.

By this logic, the entire category of ritual practice becomes immoral ""waste.""

So if the principle becomes ""avoid waste at all costs,"" then the only consistent outcome is: don't practice at all, or only do things you would already do for purely secular reasons (which is just a way of saying the religion is being hollowed out until it's no longer really religion, just personal habit with a divine label attached).

And that ties into another pattern that it seems no one wants to talk about:

A lot of people only ""offer"" things they were already going to consume, do, or enjoy anyway.
This is part of why the ""eating offerings is totally fine"" argument gets pushed so hard.

-They drink coffee every morning anyway, so they ""offer coffee"" and then drink it themselves.

-They snack while working, so they ""offer snacks"" and then eat them.

-They already burn incense because they like the smell, so that becomes a ""devotional act"" or ""burnt offering""

-They already light candles because it's cozy, so that becomes ""worship.""

-They do art anyway, so a drawing they'd already be making becomes their ""offering.""

-They already have a statue or decor item they like, so it becomes a ""votive.""

-They regularly shower, so that becomes a ""devotional activity""

-They already go to the gym, now repurposed as ""devotional activity""

-They already wanted to eat dessert, so they ""set some aside for the gods""... and then eat it.

None of this is inherently wrong. People can build a devotional life however they want, but it's important to be honest about what's happening. That's not Hellenic practice.

These offerings are not actually gifts.They're personal pleasures or routine acts that get temporarily routed through the language of religion.
That's why reclaiming the offering afterward feels normal to them,because they never actually let go of anything.
And that's why genuine sacrifice, even a tiny amount, feels ""wasteful"" from their perspective.Not because the offering would meaningfully deprive them or anyone else,but because it represents a real relinquishing of something.

It requires the one thing modern hyper-personal spirituality hates: not getting the thing back.
And that's the whole issue.

If your ""offerings"" are always items you would already eat, drink, burn, use, or do, with or without gods in the picture, then what you're doing isn't giving.... just looping ordinary life through a religious label.

Again, people can practice however they want.But this has nothing to do with Hellenic logic, reciprocity, or kharis.

In Hellenic polytheism, an offering means you actually give something.You release it.You relinquish it.You don't immediately reclaim it because you never owned it anymore.

In Hellenic religion, offerings aren't symbolic metaphors for feelings, they're concrete gestures in a real exchange relationship. The gods receive honor through what is actually given, not merely intended.
If people can't do that, they should use votives or non-consumable offering. Perfectly valid, no shame needed.

These routines of offering what you were already going to eat, drink, burn, or do, can absolutely be part of someone's spiritual life. But they don't operate on the same logic as traditional Hellenic offerings, which are built on relinquishing something as a gesture of building reciprocity. So they're valid forms of personal devotion, but they're not the same category as offerings in a Hellenic religious sense.

This is also why I think the ""waste"" argument is usually not actually about ethics in the broad sense, it's about an emotional threshold around giving something up. And I'm not saying that as an insult, there are totally valid reasons someone might feel that way. If you're food insecure, if scarcity is a lived trauma, if you grew up with instability, the act of letting something go can trigger panic or guilt. That's real. But it's still important to name what's happening. The objection isn't a historically grounded Hellenic principle, it's a personal boundary (and a completely understandable one) being treated like a universal rule.

Nothing being said here denies that some people have trauma around scarcity. If someone is food insecure, or grew up deprived, or fears running out, then giving anything up can feel painful.

That's not the same thing as acting like household worship deprives those in need.
A bit of water on a shrine does not take clean drinking water away from the world's poor, a piece of bread does not disrupt the global food economy, and a few grapes does not worsen food insecurity.
Systems create scarcity, not household devotional acts.
If personal scarcity is the concern, that's a legitimate boundary, but it's not an argument about what Hellenism teaches.

And this is where the practical solution is actually simple, like I said: if consumables are a hard line for you, choose another type of offering that doesn't create that internal conflict. Votives, written prayers, speaking or singing hymns, a dedicated small object, a moment of structured attention, a clean and tended shrine space, those are all legitimate ways to participate in reverence while honoring your reality. What I'm pushing back on is the move from ""this is hard for me"" to ""this is the correct way Hellenism should work"" or ""the traditional logic of sacrifice is wrong/unethical in modern life.""

The argument that ""ancient practices don't apply today"" is only meaningful when ancient practices depended on social conditions we no longer have.
This isn't one of them.
For many modern practitioners, though absolutely not all, modern conditions actually make offerings easier. Many modern worshippers are not dependent on a small piece of bread for survival. Giving up a bit of milk is less of a burden today than it was 2,500 years ago. That wasn't necessarily true in antiquity. In other words, the ancient world often asked more of people, not less. If someone today is in a situation where every calorie matters, then food offerings simply aren't the right option for them, and that's completely valid. But ""modern context"" doesn't inherently make offerings obsolete.

Invoking ""modern context"" to lessen the meaning of sacrifice contradicts the whole logic.If anything, modern abundance increases our capacity to give, not reduces it.

(Yes, I know this doesn't apply to everybody in the world. I am food insecure myself. But a small food offering has never made me go without a meal or be more hungry than I already would have been. If that's not true for somebody else, that's obviously fine)

Because the deeper issue, and the reason this conversation keeps spiraling, is that a lot of this disagreement isn't actually about ""what's ethical"" or ""what's historically accurate"" so much as it is about what kind of religion people are trying to build in the first place.

A lot of the tension comes from two different religious models colliding. Eclectic paganism is shaped by a modern framework that centers personal meaning, psychological symbolism, flexible boundaries, rule aversion, and individual preference. Hellenic religion is structured around reciprocity, ritual obligation, and practices that have meaning independent of personal comfort. Neither model is inherently wrong, but they are not the same, and problems arise when one is presented as interchangeable with the other.
In plenty of these threads, what's being defended is a very eclectic, highly individualized spirituality where anything can be reframed as ""personal practice"" and any boundary or historical constraint is treated like policing.

So then, when someone says ""but Hellenism has a specific religious logic: reciprocity, ritual exchange, honor, and the meaning of giving,"" the response is often not real engagement but an emotional knee-jerk reaction, such as accusations of gatekeeping, claims that reconstructionists ""haven't examined their beliefs,"" and a refusal to tolerate the idea that some practices have a meaning that isn't fully replaceable by personal preference.

What makes that especially ironic is that the ""reconstructionism"", at its best, is not blind rule-following. It's the attempt to take the ancient evidence seriously enough to ask, what did this practice mean in its own framework, and what gets lost when we resize it to fit a modern comfort zone?

What's actually unexamined is assuming that religion should always conform perfectly to your comfort level, your modern preferences, and your psychological ease, and then accusing others of elitism when they point out that Hellenism is, in fact, a religion with a structure. And honestly, there isn't even a crazy amount of structure or rules. But the few that are important, ALL, ALWAYS get pushed back on.

When people insist that any appeal to ancient context is automatically authoritarian or elitist, they're basically importing a modern secular stance (where religion is assumed to be private, optional, and largely psychological) and then treating that stance as if it were somehow the only reasonable reading of antiquity.

And that brings us back to the original offering question, because it's a perfect example of the broader split. Hellenic religion, as it's attested, treats the divine-human relationship as real and operational, built through reciprocity, honoring, and the deliberate act of giving. The divine isn't imagined as distant and uninterested (outside of specific philosophical frameworks), the world isn't framed as ""mundane"" most of the time and ""divine"" only in rare, authorized moments. The whole structure of household rites, festivals, vows, libations, sacrificial logic, only makes sense if the gods are understood to be actively involved in human life and if human actions toward them have meaning within that relationship.

So when someone says, ""It's fine to eat the offering, it's just a modern adaptation,"" I'm not saying they're a bad person or that they're forbidden to do what they need to do to feel safe, or just practice their own preferences. I'm saying, if your goal is Hellenism as a religion with its own internal logic, then eating the offering isn't a neutral ""adaptation"", it removes the core meaning of the act (giving something up in honor) and replaces it with something else (self consumption framed as devotion). And once we normalize that, the ""waste"" argument becomes a tool for dissolving the very concept of offering, because the same logic would undo nearly every material, temporal, and intentional investment that makes worship worship at all.

The simplest bottom line is, if the issue is scarcity or anxiety, choose non-consumable offerings and be honest about why. But if the issue is ""waste,"" then the consistent application of that principle would undercut the entire practice of religion, because devotion, by definition, costs something. And historically, that cost is not a bug, it's the point.

If someone is interested in following Hellenic practices, and can't spare food offerings for personal, financial, or trauma reasons, then they shouldn't give food offerings at all.They should give something else.There are dozens of valid options.
But redefining ""offering"" to mean ""I get to eat this afterward"" just erases the meaning of the act and replaces it with self comfort in disguise.
An offering only has meaning because it's something you give.Once you take it back, it's not an offering. It's just food you moved around.

One more thing. To avoid misunderstanding, it's also worth noting that in ancient public cult, animal sacrifice often included a communal meal. A portion of the animal was burned for the gods, while the remaining edible parts were cooked and shared by the worshippers. This does not contradict anything said above, because this was a ritualized division built into the sacrificial system itself, not a case of presenting something to a deity and then reclaiming it. Household offerings (libations, first fruits, shrine food, votives) followed a different logic, where what was given was not taken back. The modern practice of ""offering snacks and then eating them"" does not correspond to either ancient model.

It's important to recognize that there are distinctions between reconstructionist, revivalist, and eclectic approaches to Hellenic polytheism. I'm not claiming one is inherently better than the other, each has its place and purpose for each individual. But, they operate under different assumptions. Much of the online conflict arises from blurring these lines. Treating eclectic practices as if they follow historically grounded reconstructionist logic, or conflating modern convenience with ancient religious principles. A lot of this debate is also fueled by implicit judgment, with people assigning value, correctness, or moral weight to practices that differ from their own. What counts as a reasonable adaptation, what truly needs modification for the modern world, and what crosses the line away from historical Hellenism are highly subjective, and interpretations vary widely. Many disagreements aren't simply about facts or history, they're about personal thresholds, assumptions, and frameworks for how religion should be practiced. Recognizing these distinctions can help clarify why debates get heated, why disagreements often reflect differing goals rather than ""right"" or ""wrong,"" and how multiple approaches can coexist without invalidating one another. When we talk about what is and is not a reasonable, accurate adaptation of ancient practice, this is my take on eating offerings, within a historical Hellenic framework. It is worth emphasizing that even reconstructionists are often making educated interpretations, not speaking on a “one true framework.” There is no monolithic standard to begin with. 


…anyway, that’s my two drachmas on the subject 😅

1pfec6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pfec6s/my_gf_30f_and_i_30m_are_in_a_no_contact_time_for/,"My gf (30F) and I (30M) are in a ""No Contact"" time for a reason I'm worried will end the relationship. How do I move forward?","I'll share a little back story for a little understanding of my past, along with what I know of hers. For me, I have always been a man who couldn't find a relationship, eventually accepting that it may never happen to me. In high school and shortly after, I have had a few relationships that resulted in me catching them cheating, so starting in my early twenties, I decided it was best to let life come to me. I joined the military, got out of my hometown and didn't really pursue anyone. While I was in, however, a longtime friend of mine had moved near the base I was stationed at. We decided to start hanging out, mainly as friends, but it eventually turned romantic. Once I got out of the service, we took the next step in our relationship and I thought everything was running a great course. We were happy, we went on adventures together, bedroom life was incredible and we basically spent every minute outside of work together. After about a year and a half together, I began noticing her putting distance between us. She got short with me and would even sit on the opposite side of the couch when I was there. Then one day, out of the blue, she just dropped it on me that she couldn't love the way I should be loved and that I didn't do anything wrong, but that she felt she wasn't ready for the life commitment. And that was that, following that conversation, I was blocked on everything. Now, before the comments say she had someone else, I have confirmed that was never the case, she just wanted to be alone.

  
Now for my current girlfriend, we'll call her El (stranger things on my mind) for the sake of the story, her past I know the basics of. she's been with abusive boyfriends, as confirmed by her parents, and her ex-husband left her to do everything on her own, including raise their child, even when they were married. She's even had some family situations that has left her to do everything with no one else to rely on. So for her, I can see where she sees herself as extremely independent, but ill share that info in the actual story.

  
Me and El met earlier this year at her job. When I first met her, I was awestruck, using humor to hide the fact that was losing control of basic motor functions around her. Now me, I can't actually approach women, never have been able to, so I didn't make any type of move on her. A few weeks later, she pops up on my recommended friends list on Facebook. I hesitated for about a day to even send her a friend request because I thought that would be weird of me. However, my thumb took full control, looked her up again and sent the request. To my surprise, she accepted and we began talking. After several weeks of messaging back and forth, we finally decided to meet at a coffee shop in town and it was by far the best first date I have ever been on. The nerves quickly subsided and the conversation flowed effortlessly. It had been hours by the time we decided we needed to leave to get things done that we needed to do in our personal lives, I walked her to her car and ended up kissing her right there, which was met with happy acceptance.

  
As we continued to talk and get closer, I couldn't help but remember how my previous relationship had went. All the happiness and great adventures met with a quick, heartless ending. Naturally, I waited a while to make things official with her, but the comments kept coming; when I would say 'my girl' it was met with a 'not yet' or something was coming along those lines. I finally looked myself in the mirror one night and told myself to not miss out on someone so great due to my past, she's worth it. The next day, I asked her to be my girlfriend and she lit up.

  
Shortly after this happened, she called me while I was at work, which was unusual because she worked the same hours really. She broke the news to me that she was late and wanted to know if I wanted to come over to be with her when she took a test. Positive. she was in fact pregnant. As happy as I was, she was as nervous due to complications during pregnancies for her, but I held her and assured her that no matter what, I am here. She wasn't lying on how rough it was on her. We constantly tried to find ways to cure her constant sickness, and even made trips to the doctors and hospital for the severity. We made our way to the second ultrasound, and found that the baby was in great health. The pictures of our little one was amazing, already starting to take shape. We were about a week before the second trimester when I received a call from her at 2 am to the news that she had lost the baby.

  
We were devastated. And thats an understatement. But one thing I knew was that I couldn't control that situation, but she needed help. Its rough on her, even rougher on her body I'm sure of, but I was determined to do whatever I could to be there for her and assure her that once again, I'm not going anywhere. Following the loss of the baby, she pulled away, which I completely understood. And that lasted for a while, but I wasn't going to push her. I was thrilled when she still asked me to travel to the other side of the country with her to meet the other side of her family, even though we were still in a rough patch, but ultimately, the trip did us some good. Once we were back, we had a good talk and have started to move forward.

  
Things were great, we were thriving and everyone around us looked at us as a power couple. To me, I thought that getting through that time was crucial for us and proved to both of us that we were strong together. 

  
About a month ago I started seeing signs of her getting distant again. I would hear from her less and less throughout the day and would virtually never hear from her before she went to bed. I had seen that work for her has gotten out of hand and she had expressed some of her stresses that she had. I noticed the life getting drained from her by the time she was getting off of work, so I didn't want to add anything to her plate by being concerned about goodnight texts. But that changed a couple of weeks ago when as I was leaving her place, I told her as always if she needs me to call me, but this time she replied with I won't. I sat on that all night. I decided to bring it up and asked her if we were okay, and she started on about how she doesn't know how to accept the love that I show her, no matter how hard she tries. How she's used to doing everything on her own and doesn't expect anyone to step in and be there.

  
That conversation ended with her saying she needed time to think. During those few days, I started losing my mind, crying harder than I ever have in my life at the thought that I may lose her. A couple of days later, I was out at lunch with some of her family, something I did often since I was close with them, and the conversation shifted to the topic of me and El. According to them, when times get hard, she has the tendency to self sabotage and retreat to what she knows best, being alone. This conversation sparked mine and El's first actual argument with how it wasn't fair that I talked with her family about the situation. But to me, I just wanted advice from people who know her better than I do. The following day, we had a calm conversation where she told me that she's going to get help, but she needs to do it alone. She told me she doesn't want to break up, but simply take time to go through a few therapy sessions and then we will talk and reassess if its something she can work through her problems with me by her side or not, so from there, we have basically gone no contact other than a random 'hope you're doing okay' text.

  
Last week was Thanksgiving obviously, and originally she was going to come with me to meet my dads side of the family since I'm from a different state, but she didn't come with everything that just transpired. The trip home was rough for me, questions as to why she didn't come, questions as to what was going on with us. I ended up packing up and coming home early. And with Christmas coming up, I don't have it in me to celebrate without her.

  
She is the love that I never saw coming and I can tell you this, I have never felt this way about anyone before. This is the first time I have envisioned a future with someone and have been open with even my friends that she's what I want in life. Before the comments come in, no, there isn't another guy involved and yes, I do believe her reasoning. To me, it's about making that choice to battle your demons if you truly love someone, but some people do need help. My past tells me that this is prolonging the inevitable of her leaving me. My heart is telling me to continue the fight because she could have left already, but hasn't. It kills me not being able to talk to her. I am always checking my phone to see if she's messaged or called. Slowly, I am losing the battle within and have had more and more nights of breaking down in fear.

  
I guess my question really isn't a question, but I could use advice on how to continue this fight. ",1,1764989281.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1pfe7uy,https://www.reddit.com/r/OT42/comments/1pfe7uy/aaron_keeps_dissing_the_prosecutor_and_talks/,Aaron keeps dissing the prosecutor and talks about his psych evaluation,"When SPTV Foundation President Aaron Smith-Levin starts his stream from his SPTV studio after getting out of jail today, he looks cheerful but he's having audio problems. One of Reese's channel members sends a superchat mentioning the gift basket she sent him in jail. When he fixes his mic, he talks about how nice it was to have a steaming hot shower in his own home. Aaron says a huge thank you ""to everyone who kept the channel going and the community updated."" He says his wife, Heather, helped a lot behind the scenes.   
  
Aaron says going to jail was the best and the worst thing that has ever happened to him. He says a lot of good, normal people are in jail for bogus reasons. He says the jail system is just a way to generate money for the state of Florida and adds that probation is a scam to try to keep people ensnared in the system. Aaron says there are a lot of homeless people in the jail where he was and he claims that if a homeless person is caught sleeping at a construction site, they are charged with burglary even if they didn't take anything.   
  
He says he was in a bad frame of mind on the Friday when the judge decided to keep him in jail when Aaron was sure he would be getting out that day but that he soon settled into a routine to pass the time in jail. He says he made friends there. He calls himself a kind, friendly person who shared things with other inmates.   
  
Aaron brings up a Scientologist who ran a Ponzi scheme and defrauded people out of hundreds of millions of dollars. He says David Gentile was sentenced to seven years in federal prison and he reported to prison around the time that Aaron was put in jail. Just a few days ago, President Trump commuted Gentile's sentence. Aaron wrongfully claims that Gentile was fully pardoned. Aaron asks people to find out and tell him what Gentile's connection to Trump is and if it goes any deeper than Scientology megadonor Trish Duggan.

Aaron says the judge made it clear today that her main concern has not been protesting Scientology but instead Aaron's supposed violations of the original order of protection involving the Sea Org member he threw a lot of Holi powder on. Aaron claims that all of the examples the judge cited today of Aaron violating the protection order happened before that order was put in place.   
  
He says it's a victory that he was let out of jail without an ankle monitor. Aaron says he was scared shitless today because the judge ""made my lawyers beg and plead and argue"" for why Aaron should be let out of jail. He adds that one of his lawyers told the judge that even if she doesn't like Aaron's video titles or the fact that he's bombastic, Aaron understands the rules and is prepared to abide by them.   
  
Aaron mocks the state's attorney and says she tried to get the judge to increase the restraining order from 500 feet to 1,000 feet away from any Scientology building where the Sea Org members Aaron is charged with battering might be working.   
  
Aaron says the judge told the state's attorney she was sure that Scientology will be measuring to the foot how close Aaron comes to its building and she told him Scientology ""isn't some rinky-dink outfit"" he's going up against. He's laughing while he's talking about this. Aaron says the judge told him he needs to be careful and know what he's doing because Scientology has a lot of resources and the cult has cameras everywhere.   
  
Aaron says he learned in his previous court appearance that the deputies didn't want him turning around to look at the gallery. He claims he thought they might taze him so he refrained from looking at the gallery today even though he heard people laughing in the courtroom.   
  
Aaron says he doesn't have a restraining order involving the second Sea Org security guard but that the judge apparently wants him to act as though he does. Aaron says that's fine with him.

Aaron says from now on, in every video he does before these cases are resolved, he will be reading a disclaimer that says nothing in this video is intended to communicate with the Sea Org members he's charged with battering and nothing is intended to entice others to communicate with or harass those Sea Org members.   
  
Aaron says he is allowed to encourage other people to protest at Scientology's main buildings in downtown Clearwater and he will continue to do so. He says the state's attorney will interpret that as Aaron encouraging others to harass the Sea Org members he's charged with battering. ""The judge isn't falling for that,"" he says.   
  
Aaron is getting a bunch of superchats during this stream but it's nothing like the floods of superchats he used to get when he was doing some of his coverage of Danny Masterson's trials or streaming with Marc and Mike Rinder.  
  
Aaron argues that there's no way he or any other protesters can know when those Sea Org members are at the Scientology buildings where protesters gather. Aaron says he thinks the prosecutors in his case are ridiculous and that they're engaging in malicious prosecution for political purposes.   
  
Aaron claims one of the prosecutors took offense to things he said about her during private phone calls from jail. Aaron says the prosecutor was telling the judge that Aaron was slandering her and he mocks that while repeating his claim that she doesn't know what she's doing and she's being played like a fiddle by Scientology. ""The judge said I had every right to say that,"" Aaron says, laughing.   
  
Aaron says he did over three hours of phone calls every day in jail and he thanks everyone who put money in his commissary account. He claims he spent about $400 on food and $600 on phone calls.   
  
Aaron says the judge made a lot of comments today about him sticking his camera in people's faces. He claims she doesn't understand that he's not actually doing that and she doesn't understand social media. Aaron says both of his lawyers have told him that when it comes to trials, he couldn't hope for a better judge than the one who's already on his case. Aaron says the pre-trial phase has lots of opportunities for Scientology to be manipulative.   
  
Aaron says he had a two and a half hour psychological evaluation and the woman he spoke with told Aaron that he was the most interesting person she'd spoken to in a long time and that Aaron has serious PTSD. Aaron says he's not going back to jail, losing at trial or picking up any new charges. ""Scientology's fucked,"" he says.

Aaron says Scientology just took its best shots at him and at what he calls SPTV Nation ""and it didn't work. It didn't take me out. It made me that much more resolved."" He claims he will be more disciplined moving forward.   
  
Aaron says he joked to his daughters that he was in rehab for social media addiction. He adds that he also joked with them that jail is like summer camp but with less molestation. Aaron spends 13 hours a day on his phone, he says, and most of that time is spent doom-scrolling on Twitter and Instagram. Aaron says he enjoyed being alone with his own thoughts in jail.   
  
He complains that the jail had no pillows and that inmates were only supposed to have one towel but the jail makes it easy for people to steal more towels and use them as makeshift pillows until deputies come around every so often and do searches for contraband and stolen towels.   
  
Aaron says the woman who did his psych eval gave him some really good feedback on his work with his YouTube channel and the SPTV Foundation. He says she told him that his work would be even more effective if he got therapy. Aaron says she told him there are resources where he could get therapy for about $75 a session and he told her that's $75 too much. He claims if therapy were free, he'd do it all the time. She told Aaron that the type of work he does is constantly reinjuring his PTSD. ""It honestly feels like a price worth paying,"" he says.   
  
Aaron says his lawyer argued to the judge today that Aaron is part of a movement to help Scientologists and that hundreds of thousands of dollars have been raised for the SPTV Foundation and dozens of people have been helped by that foundation.   
  
After getting out of jail today, Aaron says he went straight home and spent some time with his daughters and some of their friends. Aaron's oldest daughter was in court today, he says.

Aaron says he wonders if he could grow the Clearwater protest movement more if he started streaming from his SPTV studio during the protests and offering to help and promote new channels for protesters.   
  
He says one of the most-watched shows in jail is King of Queens so a lot of inmates wanted to talk to him about Leah Remini and Scientology and the Aftermath. Aaron says he was giving away about 30 cups of coffee a day and it was like he was running a free Starbucks.   
  
Aaron says his daughter whose boyfriend just died is doing very well and that Heather arranged for her to have some grief counseling.   
  
Aaron says he wouldn't want protesters going out and saying that they were looking for the Sea Org member he threw Holi powder at.   
  
He says he was excited to learn about the story of Jesus and other Bible stories because he's very interested in how religions impact the world, but he tells his audience not to worry and that he's not converting to Christianity.   
  
Aaron says his second lawyer told him that he could help Aaron file criminal reports for battery against the two Sea Org members Aaron is charged with battering.   
  
He starts talking about the Lisa McPherson memorial event that's happening in Clearwater tonight and says he has heard that a lot of people were planning to go to Prelude Sports Bar but Aaron can't go there because of his no-contact order. ""We can meet up somewhere else,"" Aaron says.   
  
Aaron says he feels like SPTV is getting back to the good old days. ""I think we needed this reset,"" he says.",1,1764988919.0,OT42,0,1.0,False

1pfe5z8,https://www.reddit.com/r/weyler/comments/1pfe5z8/how_wednesday_and_tyler_flip_traditional_gender/,How Wednesday and Tyler flip traditional gender roles,"Emotions:

​​Wednesday in season 2 wouldn't let herself admit to any emotions besides anger, the classic stoic tough guy act. ​​Tyler spent season 1 repressing anger and acting cheerful and nice when in human form, the ""barista boy"" who existed to serve others.

​Skill sets:

​When we first meet them, Tyler is serving coffee, while Wednesday is kicking three boys' asses without breaking a sweat. Tyler continues to exhibit various similar Martha Stewart skills, like making sure her birthday cake has the right ingredients and the Crypt is perfectly decorated for their date. Wednesday meanwhile spends most of her time going around being a private eye detective. Obviously all this is complicated by the fact that Tyler's skills at violence do end up exceeding Wednesday's, due to his supernatural monster form. But it's still noteworthy that given his penchant for food prep and domestic crafts and little unspectacular acts of service in general - not just ""I saved your life"" but ""I made sure this cake wouldn't trigger your allergies"" - Wednesday is \*never\* going to end up the housewife with him.

Sexualization:

​They made this pretty obvious in Willow Hill, right? Tyler is put into restraints that looks suspiciously like bondage gear, divested of his shirt so we can see his bare in-shape upper body, and damn if they didn't put glycerine or something on it to make him look shiny? Meanwhile, Wednesday is wearing the same clothes she always wears plus a coat. Nothing whatsoever of her body is put on display. Even the nice black dress she wears for the school dance is neither form-fitting nor skin-revealing.

Morality:

In most popular media, while males get to be broody morally grey redeemable bad guys and forgivable antiheroes, females are expected to be either good or bad, one or the other. The most blatant form of this, the madonna whore love triangle, shows up in everything from male-gaze thrillers like Fatal Attraction to female-gaze romances like Fifty Shades of Gray to Gothic melodramas like Crimson Peak. But Wednesday defies this just by being herself. Per the usual Addams Family rule of disturbing = funny,  she gets to be the character we all root for while also doing bad things. And she doesn't even have to look sexy while doing them! (see above)

It finally worked out that I went by the coffee shop today that she likes to work from. When I pulled in I saw her car and my heart almost jumped out of my chest. When I walked inside there she was as beautiful as the last time I’d seen her. She sat against the wall as I ordered I tried to not make it so obvious that I was staring at her. But after getting my coffee I walked over and saw her smile again. I’ve missed seeing her smile. We sat and talked for a few hours while she worked. I mostly pretended to work. But for the first hour my hands shook as bad as the first time I met her. Being in her presence is so intimating yet calming at the same time. My entire adult life my job has put me in harms way but I have never been as nervous as I am when I’m with her. She’s the most beautiful woman I could have ever imagined. Not just her physical appearance but her soul is breath taking. Both of our current circumstances make it so we can’t really talk or see each other often but being with her today only for a few hours has brought me so much happiness. I long for the next time we can run into each other again or the day when everything aligns and we can take that next step. Until then I will miss her and always be thinking about her.

I bought a couple pieces from Spanx’s AirEssentials line originally just for lounging and WFH… and now I reach for it constantly.

It’s soft enough that I’m actually comfortable sitting at my desk all day, but still looks put-together enough for quick errands, coffee runs, or answering the door without feeling sloppy. I’ve also worn it through airports and long travel days and it didn’t wrinkle or feel gross by the end of the day.

I think what surprised me most is how easy it is to layer — hoodie, jacket, coat, whatever, it all works. It kind of replaced my old leggings + oversized sweatshirt uniform without me even trying.

Not trying to hype a brand, just genuinely curious: has anyone else found a “default outfit” they didn’t expect to basically live in?",1,1764988418.0,spanx,0,1.0,False

This'll be weird, considering that TF2 isn't really the type of game you'd expect to harm someone. Sure, mentally, but never physically. I just wanna tell you guys this in case, and please reach out if you know something.

Ever since junior high, I've been friends with my buddy, Kyle. He's always so busy with steam and especially in TF2. I still remember when he recommended playing the game. Of course, I liked it, but I never found any time to play. This is connected to my current issue, somehow..

I got home from school, yes, we're like grade 12 now. I was gonna do some quick assignments using ChatGPT. Normally, I'd use my phone, but it was low on batt because I used it at school. I was gonna text him ""any shit happened for you today?"", but I saw that he was on TF2. So, typical friend etiquette, I trolled him. I sent him a text saying ""spy behind u"". And I knew he saw it because a few seconds after I sent him the text, he shot another back saying ""I just died to a soldier."" He followed with ""you btch."". I chuckled a little, wanting to ragebait him more, but I crammed lots of assignments and most of them were due tomorrow, so I closed steam and tabbed back to my homework.

At least half an hour had gone by already, and I only had like 2 essays and a slideshow assignment left to complete, so I sent him a text saying I'll hop on soon. ""all talk, but no do"" he replied. I scoffed, and as I was about to tab back into my assigns, he sent a text ""just dont leave me be, fucko"". I ignored it, and went back to doing my school shit.

Finally,  I finished it all. It was midnight already. Usually, I'd flop onto my bed, but I still had a promise for that guy. So, I opened steam and texted him. ""hopping on, better not be dustbowl"", he replied with ""watever"". I still joined, not caring about any of his tomfoolery shit. It was nucleus, fortunately. He was playing pyro, even though he's a sniper main. I was a spy and medic main, but since there's already like, 3 spies, I went medic.

I can't say I didn't have a fun time, no. This game was a gem in Valve history, so of course it would be hilarious, irritatting, and fun. I also managed to no scope some poor scout as sniper, which I also got surprised about. After a couple of games, I decided to go to sleep. I was just gonna overdose on coffee tomorrow to not sleep in class, so would he, so we planned to meet at a starbucks near our campus. I went to bed, closed my eyes, and fell into slumberworld.

The next day, Kyle never came. Disappointed, I sent him a text on WhatsApp. ""yo, dickbend, where r u?"" no response, ""youll get expelled cuz of how much you skip school, yknow"" no response. I got so irritated that I called a taxi just to go to his house and to hit him with a  notebook. As the taxi drove to his address, I couldn't help but notice that he hadn't been online. Normal Kyle wouldve atleast left me on read or something, but no, still no signs of him. When I arrived at his address, I knocked on the door. His parents opened the door, and they let me in, since they already knew me because Kyle usually went to my house, and I usually went to his, anyways. They said that he had gone into a coma, it was terrible they said. Blood came out of his mouth and his eyes clouded over.. I felt a little nauseous imagining it. But a detail caught my attention.. they said that he was still on his chair, still on his desk, and still playing some game. Of course, I knew that game was TF2, but how? I went to the hospital to see him, but he was just limp, and his body was pale, like he had died, but he still had a pulse. I skipped school that day. I went on steam, and I saw him online. How? Is my mind messing with me or some shit? I saw Kyle on a hospital bed, in a coma. How would he be online right now?? I knew it couldn't have been anyone else because Kyle's brother works abroad, and Kyle and his brother were the only people who knew how to operate a computer in his family. I opened my DMs, and saw that he had sent me some messages. ""just dont leave me be, fucko"". It was that same text, over and over again. I didn't wanna go on TF2 ever again, I couldn't.

If anyone knows about this, please reach out, do anything to help. Just give me an explanation, please. I just wanna play with Kyle again.",1,1764988344.0,ServerBlight,0,1.0,False

It’s not just you. Most people around me, smart, driven, ambitious types, complain about either feeling wired all day or chronically sleepy. And yet, they scroll TikTok for morning hacks like lemon water and cold showers from influencers who barely cite any science. That’s where it gets messy. Because one of the most powerful tools to fix your energy and sleep? It’s free. Backed by dozens of peer-reviewed studies. And you can do it in 10 minutes before coffee.

Let’s break it down step by step. This isn't another productivity bro thread. This is science-backed, real-life better-living advice, sourced from Dr. Andrew Huberman (neuroscientist at Stanford), and experts from The Sleep Foundation, Harvard Health, and Chronobiology International.

### Step 1: Get sunlight in your eyes within 30-60 minutes after waking

Yes. Morning sunlight. That’s it. But let me explain why this is a game changer.

According to Dr. Andrew Huberman, your circadian rhythm, your 24-hour internal clock that controls energy, focus, mood, and sleep, is highly sensitive to light in the morning. When you get natural light in your eyes early, it triggers a cortisol pulse, which promotes alertness and focus. It also sets off a timer for your body to release melatonin 14 - 16 hours later... exactly when you want to fall asleep.

No sunlight = delayed melatonin = trouble sleeping = tired all day.

And no, ceiling lights or phone screens don’t work. Sunlight’s intensity is 50 - 100x brighter than indoor light. Even on cloudy days, outdoor light beats your phone flashlight by miles.

Here’s how to do it:

- 10 minutes of sunlight if sunny, 15 - 20 minutes if cloudy  
- No sunglasses (but avoid directly staring at the sun)  
- Do this within an hour of waking up  
- Bonus: go on a short walk to get morning movement in too  

The Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine published a study in 2017 showing that office workers with windows got 173% more natural light exposure and reported significantly better sleep and vitality than those in windowless offices. This ONE tweak changes everything.

### Step 2: Avoid artificial light before bed, or get blue-light glasses

Just like your brain loves light in the morning, it hates it at night. If you’re stuck on your laptop or phone past 9 PM, that blue light is suppressing melatonin, the hormone that makes you sleepy.

A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that people reading on iPads before bed took 10 minutes longer to fall asleep, had less REM sleep, and felt groggier the next day. The light literally shifts your internal clock by HOURS.

What to do:

- Use Flux or Night Shift to dim screens after sunset  
- Buy blue-light blocking glasses (like Felix Gray or Swanwick)  
- Add warm lighting in your room (Himalayan salt lamp works)  
- Read a physical book instead of scrolling  

### Step 3: Use the best app for circadian habit stacking

Try Finch. It’s a wellness pet app but don’t let the cuteness fool you. Finch uses psychological habit loops to help you build morning and evening rituals, including things like sunlight walks, gratitude journaling, and screen-free wind-downs.

Each habit earns you points to grow your pet. But here’s the real power: gamifying self-care builds dopamine reward loops, making these habits stick long term.

It works shockingly well, especially for neurodivergent brains or anyone tired of boring checklist apps.

### Step 4: Add this personalized audio learning app to your walk

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that turns expert books, research papers, and talks into personalized, podcast-style lessons you can listen to during your morning sunlight walk. Built by a team of Columbia University alums and Google AI experts, it pulls insights from top sources and tailors content to your goals and mood.

I’ll often ask it to teach me about something I’m working on, like improving focus or understanding dopamine cycles, and it creates a 15- or 30-minute podcast, using a voice I choose (mine’s a calm female one before bed, and energetic in the morning). You can even pause and ask it questions mid-episode.

I’ve replaced my social media scroll with this and feel way more mentally clear. Highly recommend for any lifelong learner.

### Step 5: Stop caffeine AFTER 2 pm (seriously)

Caffeine has a half-life of about 6 hours. That means if you drink a latte at 3 PM, half the caffeine is still in your body at 9 PM. Even if you fall asleep, your sleep quality tanks.

Sleep scientist Matthew Walker (author of Why We Sleep) says caffeine blocks adenosine, a molecule that builds up sleep pressure throughout the day. No adenosine = no urge to sleep = lighter, fragmented sleep.

So:

- Keep caffeine to the AM  
- Switch to herbal teas (chamomile, rooibos) after 2 PM  
- If you MUST sip something warm, try mushroom coffee or decaf  

### Step 6: Try NSDR (non-sleep deep rest) mid-day

If you can’t nap or feel drained in the afternoon, try NSDR protocols. Huberman raves about this.

NSDR is a form of guided resting state that mimics some of the benefits of sleep, improves dopamine sensitivity, reduces fatigue, boosts learning. Unlike meditation, it’s more passive.

Apps and YouTube channels for NSDR:

- YouTube: “NSDR Protocol” by Huberman Lab (10 - 30 min sessions)  
- Insight Timer App: Search for “Yoga Nidra” or “NSDR”  
- Reveri App: Created by hypnosis expert Dr. David Spiegel from Stanford  

### Step 7: Best book you’ll ever read on sleep

Why We Sleep by Dr. Matthew Walker (bestseller, translated into 40+ languages). Dr. Walker is a world-leading sleep scientist and this book will blow your mind.

It explains how sleep affects memory, creativity, immune function, even attractiveness. The chapters on REM and dreaming hit me hard. You’ll never think of pulling an all-nighter the same way again.

This book will make you question everything you think you know about sleep. No fluff. Just jaw-dropping research and real tools. This is the best science book on health I’ve ever read. Read it even if you think you sleep fine.

### Step 8: Podcasts and YouTube that will transform your energy game

- Huberman Lab Podcast: Start with the episode “Master Your Sleep & Be More Alert During the Day”  
- FoundMyFitness (by Dr. Rhonda Patrick): Deep dives on circadian biology  
- Andrew D. Huberman YouTube Channel: Visual explanations on sunlight, NSDR, serotonin, etc.  

### Step 9: Sleep tracker… but with caution

Want to really know how your sleep is going? Use a tracker, but don’t obsess. Oura ring and Whoop are solid options. But if that’s too pricey, Sleep Cycle (free app) uses your phone’s mic to analyze your sleep patterns.

It helps you observe trends like:

- What time you fall asleep best  
- How caffeine, alcohol or workouts affect your rest  
- Natural wake-up windows  

### Step 10: Stack it all into a 20-minute morning ritual

If you want to feel better today AND fix your sleep long term, try this:

- Wake up and step outside immediately  
- No phone, no emails, just sunlight + movement for 10 - 20 min  
- Listen to a short podcast while walking (like Huberman’s NSDR guide or a BeFreed episode)  
- Back home, caffeine + journaling + planning your day  

That one ritual? Might fix your whole life.",1,1764988052.0,TalkLikeAnAdult,0,1.0,False
1pfdw6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1pfdw6x/can_you_please_give_me_the_link_to_this_story/,Can you please give me the link to this story?,"""Is Audrey the real reason you came to find me, Grayson? Is that really why you came?"" she asked again, her warm, longing gaze locked with mine as I held in the rage boiling inside me, threatening to explode.
Fahk no. Audrey isn't the only reason I came for her. But there's no way in h.ll I'm admitting that if she keeps clinging to these fahked-up pretences and playing along with those ridiculous lines. Did she really forget?
""Why am I even here? You left on your own, anyway. You've never changed—not now and not seven years ago. You've only ever cared about yourself. But can we drop the fahking pretence and have an honest conversation for once?"" I snapped, my anger simmering over, unable to mask the pain I'd carried through time.
Fahk it. I thought I was done feeling this way. I thought our story ended seven years ago. So why the h.ll did she have to waltz back into my life and stir shllt up again?
We were fine. Why do I have to fall for her all over again—like a dammmnn idiot?
How did we even get here? I wondered, my gaze stuck on her in raw frustration.
I could still remember those little moments we shared in that frustrated pasts, when she'll stick up for me even when things were difficult, were those emotions I caught in her eyes back then fake?
because now…her clueless, pleading expression remained, as if I'd said something cruel and incomprehensible.
How can she lie to me so easily and expect me to just take it? Am I supposed to let this slide like it's nothing?
""Grayson, if you could just explain what you mean—I really don't know what you're talking about."" Her voice trembled, anxious and afraid, though she tried to hide it behind that fine, confused expression I wanted to distort with both pain and pleasure.
This is how it's always been—running in circles, our feelings tangled and unresolved.
Why do I want to make her cry... yet also make her smile so brightly, like she's never known pain?
""Are you seriously going to keep this up? Pretending not to know me? Not to know Audrey? Lia, for fahk's sake, that's not how lies work. We lived together. We loved each other. We had a kid together—for crying out loud! What the fahk do you mean you have no idea what I'm talking about?"" I shouted, exasperated.
Why does she keep holding on to the same dammmnn lie?
Yeah, things were pretty fahked up seven years ago—we were both students. Maybe having a kid as college juniors broke us a little. But it wasn't the end of the world.
We did our best. We lived through it like adults. And maybe things were rocky, but after a year of mending wounds and taking responsibility for each other's mistakes, I really thought our feelings had become clearer.
Our relationship might've started on lies and deceit, but we got past that. The pain turned to scars, and from those scars, love bloomed. Audrey bloomed. Our mistake—my greatest treasure.
I never imagined she had it in her to abandon our baby. To abandon us the moment she gave birth—disappearing without so much as a goodbye.
Even before Audrey was born, I saw the signs: the frustration, the resentment in her eyes when she thought about what she could've achieved if Audrey wasn't in the picture.
I probably shouldn't have brushed it off as just pregnancy hormones.
I didn't care that I had nothing to my name when I was left with a tiny little bundle of life who became my bundle of joy—my reason to keep going. I healed. I was happy.
And then she showed up again.
I wish I'd tried harder to keep her away.
Why did she have to bring all those buried feelings back? Why did I let her in again?
""Grayson, I really don't know what you're talking about."" Her voice was calm now, her eyes steady, but it was the same dammmnn line.
Frustrated, I demanded, ""We're really sticking to that, huh?""
If she's already decided to lie—and I can't bring myself to force the truth out of her—then I guess this is it.
""Did we really know each other?"" she asked in a small voice, and I turned away, pretending not to notice the tears glazing her eyes. I hated how soft and broken she sounded, how her pain somehow seemed deeper than mine, as though my words were nothing but cruel accusations that stung.
I hated how easily she pulled at my emotions. Even through the rage and heartbreak, I wanted to wipe her tears and kiss those dry, peach-colored lips until we forgot everything.

""You make it sound like I'm making this shllt up. I really can't remember, Ray. Why won't you believe me? Seven years ago I—""
""You claim you've forgotten—but why did you call me that?"" I cut in sharply. Her bottle-green eyes darted nervously—not with fear, but confusion, like she was surprised by her own words.
""I—I... I don't know. I just—""
I cut off her rambling with a hollow laugh, letting it carry all the complicated, messy emotions swirling inside me.
""I guess I was that easy to forget."" My voice dropped cold. ""Seven years, and everything we shared turned to smoke for you. I guess that's how much I mattered. That's how much we mattered.""
With no control left, I buried my fist into the nearest expensive vintage table, and she flinched at the sound, fear flashing in her eyes.
I hadn't wanted to do this—not after I'd just rescued her from that bastard. But maybe I'm no better than him after all.
My gaze flicked to the bruise on her wrist, now darkened to a pale purple.
""I'm not making this up, Grayson. I really don't remember,"" she whispered, her voice still trembling, though now tinged with the same frustration I'd thrown at her. ""But I didn't forget because I wanted to, okay?""
""What the fahk does that even mean?""
My voice twisted into confusion, cutting through my rage.
And then, with reluctance, she finally confessed.
But her confession only dragged us back to where we never wanted to return—to the past.
To seven years ago.

/Thalia's POV/
""I'm sorry, Miss Kithson, there's nothing I can do. You'll have to retake the course next year since it's not even available in the summer program. Not only was your attendance terrible, but you haven't performed well in previous tests. That project was your chance to make up for it—and you screwed that up too. I'm afraid I can't help you.""
The 52-year-old professor said, lowering her glasses after reviewing my file.
""Ma'am, you've got to believe me! I did participate in the project. My name must've been omitted somehow!"" I pleaded, panic rising in my chest.
Okay… maybe I messed up. I didn't meet up with my group members, and I half-assed the research reports I submitted—but I didn't want to be anywhere near Grayson. I hate his guts. He hates mine.
The moment we were grouped together for the semester's final project—the one that counted as our entire exam grade—I knew I was screwed. I just didn't think it'd be this bad.
To avoid the daily awkwardness and middle-finger flips, I chose to work on the research and skip the group meetings.
Grayson didn't complain or protest—he just watched me walk out like he was okay with it. I should have known better. That motherfahker wasn't.
A couple of our group mates tried reaching out, but let's be honest—I'm not exactly known for being friendly. If I'd tried harder with them, maybe I'd have figured out that the perfectionist ditched my research completely, came up with a brand-new concept, and worked overtime on the project presentation without me.
I almost missed the presentation entirely. He didn't even bother to tell me about it—obviously trying to exclude me altogether.
If my best friend hadn't texted me the second my group got on stage, I would've missed the whole thing.
And just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, the presentation ended with Grayson Moore publicly highlighting everyone's contributions to the project.
He was fahking thorough.
While other groups just listed contributors vaguely—mostly whoever funded the thing—Grayson had six distinct credits to his name: project design, research, presentation, execution, editing, and management.
Me?
I had absolutely nothing. Not a single mention.
Now I'm being told I have to repeat the year because of it.
After the professor's final unapologetic, ""I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do,"" I was shoved out of her office and into the long, gloomy hallways filled with tech students drowning in deadlines and pre-exam burnout. Frustration clung to the walls like fog.
Everyone just wants to go home and recharge. The semester's been h.ll. But what's a week going to fix when the next semester starts right after?
Still, I've got my own problems.
If I find that son of a b.tch, I swear to God—I'll tear him apart.
Huffing and fuming, I stormed through the halls, scanning classrooms, labs, and lecture wings for Grayson.
Grayson, my class president and personal arch-nemesis, wasn't hard to spot.
Why?
Because he's the poster boy of the dammmnn electronics department.
And, unfortunately, the bastard looks good—something I hate to admit.
He's got this annoyingly sharp face always hidden behind glasses, standing tall at 6 feet with a solid, muscular build. His pecs stretch every flannel shirt he wears. Somehow, he even makes average denim jeans look tailor-made.
It's so irritating.
He pulls off casual wear like he's modeling it. Students at Finchley University even joke he's the hottest nerd on campus. While girls line up to worship the ground he walks on, I'd rather just ruin his entire life.
""Hey, asswipe!"" I yelled, barging through a crowd that had formed around him.
He was mid-sentence, explaining the project to a group of girls who clearly didn't care about the work—they just wanted to hear him talk in that annoyingly hot Canadian accent.
""You fahking maron!"" I snapped, shoving him hard.
But his body was so solid, it was like pushing a dammmnn wall. His chest felt like rock. Not the point—definitely not the point. I shoved those thoughts aside.
""How could you do that to me?! My entire year depended on that project. How could you remove my name!?""
He calmly bent down to pick up the glasses I'd knocked off. The girls all swooned at his perfect side profile. I rolled my eyes.
""We had 25 group meetings since the project began,"" he said, slipping his glasses back on. ""You didn't show up to a single one. You didn't contribute to the building process either, which I wanted to assign to you, not Nora. So tell me—why should I add the name of someone who did absolutely nothing?""
His apathetic voice made my blood boil.
""Do you have any idea what you did—?""
""Spare me the bullshlt, Thalia. If the project was important to you, you would've shown up.""
With that, he turned around, walking away like he hadn't just ruined my entire academic year.
I was stunned—furious—and I wasn't going to let him walk away.
Without thinking, I grabbed the drink from the nearest girl and splashed it all over him—coffee and milk soaking into his flannel.
The hallway went silent.
""Asshole,"" I spat.
But instead of shouting back, he scoffed, pulled off his soaked jacket, and revealed a tight black shirt underneath. As he wiped himself down, my eyes caught something I wasn't ready for: a small snake tattoo curling around his waist as his shirt lifted.
He leaned in close, his voice low.
""Doing this won't fix your grades. Have fun repeating the year… doofus.""
Doofus.
I turned bright red, humiliated beyond words.
The snickers and whispers around us didn't help.
Fahk. I felt like such an idiot.
And because someone filmed the whole thing—it's now viral on the school platform.
I didn't even think ""Doofus"" was loud enough to hear, but apparently, it was crystal clear on camera.
Just like that, I got a new nickname.
I wanted the bed to swallow me whole. Should I just drop out? I can't keep my grades up anyway.
""Hey, b.tch.""
I knew that voice.
""What do you want, Bee?"" I groaned, buried under my blanket, which was immediately yanked off by Bianca—ready to nag me.
""I can't believe you're sulking in bed just because you got held back a little,"" Bianca snickered.
She wouldn't get it.
She's prettier. Smarter. Her parents don't compare her to a perfect older sibling or remind her she was a mistake.
She didn't grow up being told she wasn't enough.
I didn't even want to study here. I wanted to open a dessert shop. Something small, meaningful.
But that was too much to ask from my parents.
""C'mon, get out of that bed."" She snapped her fingers as if highlighting the sense of urgency. 
""What?"" 
My bitter thoughts were cut off when Bianca sighed heavily, dragged me out of bed, dressed me up, and took me to a downtown strip club to cheer me up despite my grunts, grumbles, and loud protests, I just wish I could stay in bed. 
But we're both fans of the male anatomy... I shouldn't even be here.
I've got a boyfriend—even if things haven't exactly been going well lately.
""Wow, they look fantastic,"" Bee commented, and I finally glanced up from my drink.
The dancers had flawless physiques, moving sensually around poles.
""They're wearing masks?!"" I blurted.
Each dancer had a mask matching their costume—one even had a black Batman mask paired with matching briefs. Sexy? I wasn't sure.
""Apparently, it's the only costume-based strip club in the area. Adds to the mystery,"" Bianca said, eyeing a guy in a monster mask. ""There's something about not seeing their faces—it makes it spicier, y'know?""
But my eyes were glued to something else.
A tattoo.
A small snake curling around the waist of one stripper as he walked off stage.
It had to be a coincidence.
Still, I couldn't stop my legs from moving. I followed him backstage like a lunatic.
""What the fahk am I even doing?"" I whispered. ""It's not him... there's no way.""
What would our class president—our golden boy—be doing in a strip club?
He's too ""holy"" for this place.
Or... so I thought.
""Grayson?!"" I gasped.
Because, of course.
Just when I thought the day couldn't get any better.

/Grayson's POV/
""Ash, you're not up on your game today. Your movement was rigid and sloppy; you'll have to break out more moves if you wanna keep your fans hyped."" Patsy complained and I internally groaned as I watched him walk off with his usual ladylike stride. 
Ecstasy Delight is a lady-owned club where men are laid out like specimens while the ladies gawk at them. 
Not like I've ever had a problem with it since I'm an anonymous stripper. 
It pays the bills so I can't complain. 
""Grayson!"" 
A familiar voice cut through the noise, and I froze.
No one knows me by that name here—I go by Ash.
Who the h.ll…? 
The next 1 min knocked some air out of my lungs as an agonising feeling of dread settled deep inside my stomach, which dropped the moment I turned to see the last person I'd wish to see in that situation. 
I blinked furiously as I watched her pinch her cheeks like she couldn't believe what she was seeing.
Realising she might call my name again, I grabbed her wrist and dragged her into my dressing room. I quickly slipped into a bathrobe in the corner to cover my nudity—since all I had on was the club-issued sexy briefs.
""What the fahk are you doing here, Kithson!? Did you follow me?"" I snapped, horror laced into my tone, masked by a hostile stare and clenched jaw.
 
""The question is, what the fahk are you? Is it even legal for a college student to work here... as a stripper?"" she hissed. 
""Wait—do the professors know you work here? This is unbelievable.""
Her snicker was laced with mockery, her tone thick with scorn. 
Typical Thalia; she was exactly who I thought she was. 
Privileged and ignorant.
She had everything handed to her and no clue how the real world works.
""You're not telling anyone,"" I warned flatly.
She scoffed. ""Watch me!""
She turned to leave but I blocked the door and held her back, my hands a little shaky from the fear that gripped my entire body. 
If Thalia walked out that door and told anyone what I do… I'm definitely screwed. 
My scholarship can only do so much; it wasn't even enough to cover my feeding expenses, if I lose my scholarship because of this, I might have to give up school. 
""You're shaking!? Are you really that scared of me airing your dirty laundry? I can't believe this! You treat everyone else like shllt, like they're beneath you but you're a fahking stripper. Because of you—"" 
She paused, rage lighting up her eyes and in a heated tone, she continued. 
""Because of you the last two years have been nothing but h.ll. All because you happened to be smarter!"" 
She tried to push past me, but I tightened my grip until she winced. 
""Look, I'm sorry, okay… but this is really important to me. You…you can't tell anyone about this, please."" 
My voice wavered at the end.
""Why the fahk should I listen to you!? Because of you, everything I did for the whole year went down the fahking drain. If you'd told me attendance mattered, I'd have attended even if I had to crawl over from my hospital bed, you maron."" She lashed out. 
""Wait, you were at the hospital!?"" My eyes widened in disbelief. 
Thalia Kithson has been nothing more than an irresponsible dork to me since freshman year. 
I saw her parents trying to help her settle at the dorm during freshman year and watching her lash out at them as they gave her everything I wished I had made me envious but instead of taking advantage of that, she partied away and surrounded herself with the worst crowd. 
Everything about her irks me; she was wild and irresponsible, the type of person I abhorred and when she decided she wouldn't be showing up for the project prep, I was more relieved than upset. 
I knew she needed that project to hit her target grade to register for advanced courses next year but I had no intention of piggybacking her through it. 
She had to earn it, unlike me, but I didn't think she was at the hospital. 
""Yeah, you d.ckhead! I was treating my gastritis but you wouldn't know that since all it ever mattered to you was being perfect but I guess you aren't after all!"" She scoffed with a dramatic eye-roll that made me take a step back from her and sigh.
I never claimed to be perfect.
They just assumed I was.
It worked in my favor—I kept my scholarship. And if this semester goes well, I'll get a full grant and another scholarship for next year.
""What exactly do I have to do to make this right? No one can know about this, Thalia. I fahking mean it!"" Desperation seeped into my tone. 
She smirked—scheming. I could already tell.
It didn't matter. I just need to stall until the end of the session anyway. 
""Professor Lovre treasures you a lot. So I'm sure you wouldn't mind fixing my grade.""
""You know I can't do that. With the project already submitted and—""
""Don't give me that bullshlt!"" She snapped. ""Everyone knows how closely you are with the Professors being the class president and all. You asked what I want—this is it. I cannot repeat a fahking year because you think I don't deserve to pass, Grayson, so fix it."" She insisted. 
I sighed. 
""I'm not making any promises, Thalia. This might not work; I don't control them. If anything, they all just wanted a lackey who'd make their job easier; I just happened to be a good fit."" The last parts of my words came in a mumble because I didn't think it was possible to reverse the damage done. 
With the end-of-semester project already concluded and the list of participants already submitted, I thought it was impossible, but Professor Lovre actually listened when I explained it was an error on my part because I thought Thalia didn't send in her research, but she did, and fortunately, she didn't mind since it was my first time making that mistake. 
Even though I didn't use her research and analysis for the project execution, I just wanted to get her off my neck. 
""Happy now?"" I asked when we met in school two days later. ""You've been graded. You're not repeating the course.""
""Maybe,"" she replied smugly as we walked away from the professor's office.
I thought that was it.
But she kept showing up at my shows.
And when I told her to back off, she brought new demands.
I'm already drowning in my assignments and project work as it is, and now I have to do hers. 
""You're unbelievable,"" I declared as she sat on my dresser after one of my shows, her skirt slightly lifted in reaction while I muttered a few silent curses before tearing my eyes from her pale thighs. 
""Why can't you do your own dammmnn work? I'm already swamped as it is,"" I complained for the umpteenth time. 
""For one, you're smarter than me, and two—"" She grinned. ""I know your dirty little secret, so you might wanna put in a little more work if you want me to shut up about it,"" She threatened. 
""Fahking b.tch!"" I muttered under my breath. 
""What was that?"" She arched a brow. 
""Nothing but how long am I gonna have to do this for?"" I demanded. 
She shrugged, hopping down from my dresser in her skimpy skirt and crop top, leather jacket tossed over her shoulder. Her thigh-high boots matched her wi.ne-red shirt.
""I don't know, maybe until I'm satisfied and no longer think you're a fahking je.k."" Was,what she said but her eyes lingered on me more than usual; it's been like that for the past couple of weeks since she found out I worked at Ecstasy Delight. 
Every night I hit that stage, her eyes strangely followed me and even with the masks on, she could always tell my position. 
It still felt uncomfortable rolling around the pole and dropping down on all fours with her eyes following my every movement. 
But I got to understand what it meant when Thalia showed up to my dorm room in tears, her mascara smudged and her hair wet from the rain. 
I was ready to lash out at her if she brought over her fahking work again; it was becoming tiring to keep up with her annoying demands but when she showed up looking like someone chewed her up and spat her out, I didn't know what to do. 
""Are you okay?"" I asked, helping her settle on the shared sofa with my roommate, who fortunately was out tonight. 
""No, I'm not. I just got dumped."" 
Thalia was the honest type, impulsive too… unlike me who had a thousand faces, she wasn't the type to hide, but she didn't need to; she wasn't the orphan fighting to survive. 
""Sorry, I guess,"" I replied as I returned to my desk to finish up my work but I couldn't just leave her sulking on my sofa like some abandoned puppy but I didn't have to; she was already rummaging through my fridge like she owned the place. 
""You've got booze!"" She exclaimed, gulping down my roommate's beer while I groaned from my desk. 
""That's Nathan's,"" I told her but she kept drinking anyway. ""You could have just hit the bar or something. Why come here?"" I complained but instead she handed me a can of beer. 
""No thanks, I'll pass. I've got to finish this tonight. It's due tomorrow,"" I reminded. 
""You are such a killjoy,"" She said with a dramatic eye roll before flopping at the foot of my bed while I wondered how I could get her to leave but when I turned to look at her again, she was shivering. 
She should really get off those clothes. I thought, walking over to the bathroom and returning with a towel, which I draped over her shoulders. 
""You'll catch a cold if you don't head back,"" I told her but…
No response instead Thalia's lips suddenly met mine, leaving me completely frozen still. 
What the fahk? Is she drunk?

How do you bring more life into conversations without overstepping?

Connell closed the email from the university in New York for the fifth time. The offer was life-changing, a clear path to the writing career he desperately wanted. He sat on the edge of the bed in the flat in Dublin, the silence of the afternoon around him.

Marianne came out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on a dish towel. She saw his face and the open laptop screen.

“Did they email back?” she asked softly.

“Yeah,” he said, closing the laptop completely. “It’s good news.”

“So you’re going.” It wasn't a question, just a statement of fact, delivered with the same quiet acceptance she always had regarding his future.

Connell looked up at her, really looked at her, standing there in her worn sweater, hair slightly messy. He thought about New York—the bright lights, the anonymity, the prestige. Then he thought about Dublin—the familiar streets, the comfort of their shared flat, and the easy rhythm of their life together now. He thought about all the years they had spent orbiting each other, struggling to communicate, missing opportunities.

He shook his head slowly. “No.”

Marianne froze. “No? Connell, this is everything you’ve wanted. You have to go. We’ll figure it out. We always do.”

“I’m tired of figuring it out from different cities, Marianne,” he said, his voice raw with emotion he hadn’t intended to show. He stood up and took a step towards her. “I don’t want to be good at being apart anymore. I want to be good at being here.”

She searched his eyes, tears beginning to well up in her own. “Are you sure? Don’t stay for me, Connell. That would be… it wouldn’t be right.”

“It’s not for you,” he said, pulling her into a fierce hug, breathing in the scent of her hair. “It’s for us. I don’t want my life to start over there. My life is here. With you.”

They stayed like that for a long time, the weight of the decision settling around them, not as a sacrifice, but as a commitment.

Four years later, the weather in Dublin was typically grey and drizzly. Inside a cozy, slightly crowded bookshop near Trinity College, the air was warm and smelled of coffee and paper.

A small crowd had gathered for a reading. At the front of the room, behind a podium, stood Connell Waldron. He looked older, more confident, wearing a tweed jacket that Marianne had helped him pick out. The cover of the book beside him read “Thresholds: A Collection of Short Stories,” by Connell Waldron.

He finished his final story, a quiet narrative about two people finding their way back to each other across different social worlds. The room erupted in applause.

As people lined up for signatures, he scanned the crowd until he found her. Marianne was leaning against a bookshelf in the back, smiling, a new pair of stylish glasses perched on her nose. She raised a glass of cheap white wine in a silent toast.

Later, walking home through the quiet Georgian streets, the rain having momentarily stopped, Connell reached for Marianne's hand. It was cold, and he wrapped his fingers around hers tightly.

“Good night,” she said, looking up at the streetlights illuminating the damp pavement. “You were brilliant.”

“It was okay,” he said, deflecting the praise as usual.

“It was better than okay. You’re happy, aren’t you?” she asked, nudging his shoulder.

He stopped walking, pulling her closer under the pale glow of a street lamp. The easy awkwardness of their youth had finally evaporated, replaced by a comfortable, earned silence.

“I am,” he said, smiling, looking at the person who knew him better than anyone in the world. He was a published author with a stable life, in a city he loved, with the only person he’d ever truly needed. He had chosen this quiet, normal life over the endless possibilities of New York, and he didn’t regret it for a second.

They were just two people walking home in the rain in Dublin, no longer wondering about their future, but simply living it. It wasn’t a dramatic life, but it was theirs, and it was enough.

1pfdmqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1pfdmqo/192168131/,192.168.1.31,"The glow of three monitors was the only light in Elias’s basement apartment. Outside, the city of Havenwood slept, oblivious to the fact that someone was trying to breach its digital defenses. Elias, known in certain encrypted corners as 'Cipher,' was good—maybe too good. His target tonight was the ledger of a notorious local slumlord, a petty piece of justice he enjoyed delivering. He typed the final segment of the exploit, fingers flying across the custom mechanical keyboard. He hit enter. The screen flashed green—ACCESS GRANTED. Elias leaned back, a smug satisfaction spreading across his face. ""Too easy,"" he muttered, reaching for his cold coffee.
But as the remote desktop loaded, something was wrong. This wasn't the crude, disorganized mess he expected from the slumlord's ancient system. The interface was sleek, proprietary, and secured with layers of high-grade encryption he’d never seen outside of military spec. Worse, the file structure wasn't about property taxes and eviction notices. It was labeled in cryptic acronyms: 'Project Chimera,' 'Asset 734 Log,' and a massive folder simply titled 'Dreadnought Protocol.' Elias froze. He hadn't just hacked the wrong target; he'd stumbled into something far beyond petty crime. He checked his packet trace. A single, almost imperceptible IP typo. He hadn't connected to 192.168.1.13; he’d hit 192.168.1.31. A faint, but distinct, sound echoed from his external speaker: a subtle click, like a microphone being activated on the other end. ""The wrong laptop,"" a synthesized, calm voice stated from the speakers, cutting through the basement silence. ""A grave mistake, Cipher.""
Elias didn't hesitate. He ripped the Cat-6 ethernet cable from the wall port. He pulled the solid-state drives from their bays—his work drive, his storage drive, and his boot drive—and tossed the three small rectangles into a metal bowl. He carried it to the ancient, buzzing microwave in the corner and set the timer for a generous two minutes. As the drives began to spark and sizzle, he grabbed his laptop and wiped its integrated storage using a pre-loaded USB kill-switch. This was the first time the opposition had called him by his handle, Cipher. Which meant they weren't tracking packets; they were tracking him.
The silence in the basement was broken by a shrill, insistent ring. It was the landline upstairs, a relic he kept for his emergency plumbing contractor job. He slowly climbed the creaking wooden steps and picked up the heavy receiver in the kitchen. ""Hello?"" His voice was steady. A woman's voice answered, smooth and professional, almost melodic, but with a terrifying edge of finality. ""Mr. Vance. We know about your leaky pipes. They're located at 192.168.1.31."" Elias's blood ran cold. The address was the IP he’d mistakenly hacked. ""We need you to come and fix them immediately,"" she continued, her tone shifting to a chilling, low demand. ""And don't bother bringing your tools. We have everything you need here.""
Elias slammed the heavy landline receiver down so hard the plastic housing cracked, then ripped the thick wire from the wall. His personal cell phone began vibrating, and his email was immediately flooded with hundreds of messages containing the same plaintext: a simple, suburban street address and a single name: OAKLAND, CA. 112 PINE STREET. The address of 'Ghost,' his fellow hacker and best friend. He grabbed the only things that mattered: a thick roll of cash hidden in a flour canister, his wallet, and a small, nondescript flash drive containing encrypted backups. He slipped into a dark, hooded jacket and bolted out the back door, utilizing the 'Ghost Routes' he had mentally mapped out years ago—a labyrinth of overlooked paths that avoided every major traffic camera. His destination was the regional train station. He needed to reach Ghost before the organization did.
Elias pushed himself through the labyrinthine backstreets, eventually slowing his pace in a quiet area dominated by warehouses. He leaned against the cold corrugated steel of a loading bay, letting his heart rate drop. It was in that quiet moment that he noticed the vehicle. A large, unmarked black SUV, windows tinted to absolute black. It drifted past the end of the alley, disappeared for thirty seconds, and then passed again. Elias started inching backward, when the SUV returned for a third pass, stopping directly at the mouth of the alley. The passenger-side window silently glided down. A man's face appeared—cold, expressionless, wearing an expensive tailored suit. He lifted his right hand, pointed directly at Elias, and made a single, subtle beckoning motion with his index finger.
As Elias tensed to sprint, the man in the SUV passenger seat finally spoke. He didn't say, ""Get in."" He said, ""The Vance Protocol is Green."" Elias froze. The protocol was a critical authentication key known only to Cipher and Ghost. ""He doesn't bite, Elias. Get in the car."" Elias slid onto plush leather seats. Inside, the second man in the back seat looked up from a tablet. ""Cipher. Really? '1.31'?"" the man said. ""That IP belongs to me. Always has."" ""Ghost?"" Elias stared. The man offered a hand. ""In the flesh. The name's Kaelen Vance, by the way. I'm afraid your leaky pipes are currently being monitored by a very serious organization that just realized they've lost their biggest leverage."" Kaelen explained that he was the founder of Artemis Solutions, a global security firm, and that Elias had hacked his personal disaster recovery server. The files Elias saw—'Project Chimera' and 'Dreadnought Protocol'—belonged to an international shadow group known as The Directorate. ""They are relentless, highly funded, and they know you're loose. Lucky for you, I've been trying to bring them down for years.""
The black SUV drove straight onto a private dock in the Sausalito harbor where an obsidian-colored yacht, the Aether, waited. Kaelen led Elias into a high-tech cabin. ""You destroyed your data, which bought us time,"" Kaelen said. ""Now, we use the time you bought."" He explained that The Directorate had access to geosynchronous SIGINT platforms and had tracked his location almost instantly. The files related to the 'Dreadnought Protocol,' the Directorate's plan to execute a coordinated, global blackout. ""It's either you become a loose end they eliminate,"" Kaelen told him, ""or we expose them."" Kaelen revealed that Artemis Solutions had collected immense intel on the Directorate, including the software keys for the Dreadnought attack. He just needed a clean, irreversible plan to leak it all to global watchdogs simultaneously.
""An army,"" Kaelen repeated. ""The greatest defense against a centralized attack is decentralized chaos."" Elias quickly logged into a secure terminal and posted an encrypted call-to-arms to his massive following on the 4chan hacker sub, urging them to hit the list of Directorate-controlled IPs Kaelen provided. Within minutes, the ""digital cavalry"" responded, turning the global network map into a firework show of red indicators. ""Now is the window,"" Kaelen said. He prepared the full dossier and initiated the scatter-shot delivery to a dozen watchdogs. ""And... sent."" A high-pitched, persistent alarm suddenly blared across the Aether's control deck—a sound that meant perimeter breach. Kaelen cursed. A single, previously green node—labeled ""Global Oversight Commission (GOC)""—suddenly turned red. ""Impossible,"" Kaelen muttered. ""The GOC was founded by Directorate money. They didn't just receive the data, they tracked the encrypted link back! They're tracing the source signal through the fiber backbone.""
""Emergency Protocol Gamma Initiated. Abandon Vessel,"" Kaelen yelled, slamming a shielded button. He yanked the massive, encrypted master drive from the server rack. Kaelen activated the autopilot and set the yacht, the Aether, on an aggressive path out to sea, engaging the Chaff Protocol to create a massive digital noise signature that would draw pursuit. Jax, the bodyguard, pointed toward a hidden panel in the floor. The three men donned wetsuits and plunged into the frigid harbor water, swimming through a private, sub-surface maintenance tunnel built into the pier's foundation. The tunnel perfectly blocked all tracking. To The Directorate's satellites and incoming strike teams, they had vanished. After fifteen tense minutes, they emerged, dripping, inside a cramped, abandoned fishing shed, where a battered, rusty pickup truck waited.
They drove toward the secure data center beneath the Artemis Solutions Headquarters. ""We need a way to broadcast the data directly to every screen, every server, and every phone—so widely and so fast that even they can't scrub it,"" Kaelen stated. Elias proposed compromising the fundamental network protocols—a global 'Zero-Day' exploit that forces a temporary global network redirect. Instead of sending packets to a destination, every device on Earth would temporarily receive one file: The Directorate’s dossier. This meant penetrating Kaelen's own security fortress. They arrived at the edge of the sprawling campus and formulated the final plan: Jax would handle infiltration, Kaelen the upload, and Elias the ""Ghost Bomb""—a hack that would have to be completed in less than ninety seconds before Artemis's internal defenses isolated the network.
Jax led them through a service entrance; there was no security in sight. No alarms, no personnel. It was too easy. ""They're not trying to stop us from getting in,"" Elias whispered. ""They're trying to trap us once we're inside the core."" Kaelen pressed his retinal scanner against the reinforced steel door of the Data Vault. Inside, Kaelen moved immediately to the core connection terminal, inserting the master drive. ""Elias, get ready. You have ninety seconds from the moment I connect this,"" Kaelen warned. Suddenly, the woman's voice from the landline echoed through the vault's comms. ""A valiant effort, Mr. Vance. We let you in. We wanted you to upload that drive. We've been waiting for all of our missing data to be in one place."" A hidden section of the wall slid open, revealing a clear, bulletproof enclosure containing a massive custom-built server rack. ""Welcome to Project Chimera, Version 2.0,"" the woman purred. ""It’s a dedicated Cyber-Sponge. The moment your master drive connects, Chimera will instantly replicate, corrupt, and ingest all the data on the drive, simultaneously locking down Artemis's entire infrastructure and trapping you inside. You've brought the evidence right to us.""
Elias didn't move. ""You're too late,"" he said calmly, projecting his voice just loud enough to be picked up by the vault's internal microphones. ""You've explained your entire operation, Project Chimera, and the Dreadnought Protocol, to the wrong audience."" Elias quickly explained: The vault's internal mic and speaker system—which had just captured the Directorate operative detailing the plan and the purpose of Chimera 2.0—was being live-streamed. His massive hacker army was not just attacking the Directorate's IPs; they were acting as a massive, synchronized relay network, giving the world an exclusive look. Elias executed his Zero-Day exploit, and instead of routing files, it routed a video stream. TVs flickered, digital billboards went blank, phones interrupted video calls, and bank tellers watched in disbelief as the Directorate operative's voice boomed from their monitors. The Directorate's full plan was being broadcast to every connected screen on the planet. The smooth voice from the speaker system finally broke. ""Abort! ABORT THE ENTIRE OPERATION! ISOLATE THE NETWORK! Kill the feed!"" The Cyber-Sponge server, Project Chimera, was overwhelmed by a wave of incoming, self-propagating code designed to lock it down and expose its own hardware schematic. ""We just shut down their core countermeasure,"" Kaelen said, ejecting the master drive.
The Data Vault plunged into darkness as the power shifted. ""We have to go!"" Kaelen yelled, grabbing the drive. The massive vault door shuddered open from sheer destructive force. Standing silhouetted in the entrance were a dozen figures in tactical gear, all pointing silenced weapons. Jax reacted instantly, but the hail of return fire was overwhelming. Elias, Kaelen, and Jax were shot on the spot, dying on camera.
The global broadcast was cut.
One minute later, every major news network, every streaming platform, and every government communication channel switched simultaneously to an emergency news bulletin. Anchors, their faces grave, reported: ""The masterminds, known by the handles 'Cipher' and 'Ghost,' were running a rogue operation from the headquarters of Artemis Solutions. Law enforcement intervened, and the terrorists were neutralized in a raid."" The news showed digitally manipulated video and edited audio, making it sound as if Elias and Kaelen were discussing the ""Dreadnought Protocol"" as their own plan. The lie was seamless. Despite having watched the truth moments before, the sudden, overwhelming uniformity of the media created an immediate, collective cognitive dissonance. The Directorate, having successfully used its media control to flip the narrative, was not damaged. It was made stronger.
The organization had confirmed its greatest secret: It wasn't enough to kill the messenger. They had to kill the truth itself.

1pfdjvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftRecommendations/comments/1pfdjvq/do_you_bring_a_gift_to_a_gender_reveal/,Do you bring a gift to a gender reveal?,"If you've never been to a gender reveal party before, it can be hard to know what to bring. The expectations are extremely different from those of a baby shower. Here's the straightforward truth:

In short, you don't have to bring a gift.

But if you want to bring something, make it small, simple and not too fancy. It shouldn't be anything like a baby shower present.



**Why the Etiquette Is Different**

A gender reveal is a fun, low-key party where the parents tell their closest friends and family the baby's gender. It's not about providing gifts, it's about the reveal moment. Most of the time, these get-togethers are for both men and women, are casual and take place at houses or backyards.

Most people come without any wrapped gifts, which is quite okay.

If you're going for a close family, like your boyfriend's brother and his fiancee, though, you might feel more comfortable bringing a tiny, thoughtful gift. It's all up to you.



**When You Should Think About Giving a Gift**

A little gift makes sense when the parents have made a registry but they don't expect you to buy anything from it. It's evident from the sign that the event is both a baby shower and a gender reveal. You just don't want to show up empty-handed because the hosts are close family or friends. In these cases, a small, useful gift is a good addition.



**When It’s Completely Fine to Bring Nothing**

No gift is needed if:

* No registry was mentioned.
* The invitation didn’t include any reference to gifts.
* The family tends to keep gatherings simple and low-pressure.



**There is one rule that most parents follows:**

Bring a present to the baby shower. Gender reveal is optional and you can do it in a very minor way if you want to.



**If You Want to Give a Small Gift**

Gifts for a gender reveal should be small, helpful, cheap and not too gendered. Instead of entire baby gifts, think of them as 'tokens.' The real gifts are usually saved for the baby shower.

These are the choices that people like the most:

* Useful baby things that don't have a gender
* A handwritten message in a children's book
* Diapers or baby wipes which are always needed and used
* A little and fluffy blanket
* Things like burp cloths, pacifiers, socks or a little basket of necessities



**Gifts that show you care for the mom-to-be**

Most people forget about the mom, thus these are surprisingly appreciated:

* A warm robe
* A basic basket for taking care of yourself
* Things for your skin, like lotion, candles or herbal tea
* Things that make you feel better after giving birth
* A tiny gift card for food or coffee



**Little Gifts for Dad**

* Something light and playful keeps things casual.
* A mug or tumbler that says 'Dad'
* A funny shirt or key chain for Dad
* A bag of snacks
* A minor thing that has to do with his passions



**Ideas for Sweet Couples**

If you want to gift both parents:

* Matching mugs for Mom and Dad
* A gift card for couple spa
* A small basket for skincare
* A simple picture frame for images of your future kid

If you do decide to bring one, make it simple, thoughtful and not too personal. Your presence is the most meaningful gift of all.",1,1764986929.0,GiftRecommendations,0,1.0,False
1pfdj4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1pfdj4p/spek_fakin_the_funk_review_2_weeks_later/,SPEK & FAKIN' THE FUNK REVIEW 2 WEEKS LATER,"I personally don't have knowledge about music, quality, volume etc so I just download stuff that are ""320kbps"". When I mix I am always having a hard time balancing the audio and thought okay maybe tracks are just low volume.

did some research and there are plenty of posts with spek and fakin' the funk so I had to give it a try.  purchased fakin' the funk and here are my thoughts.

1. A lot of people would say oh get your tracks or buy your tracks. Sure, we get it but not all can afford to buy tracks especially when you just started or don't have means to buy tracks. some of the tracks I have downloaded are from blogspots etc just literally anywhere in the internet and I have found some tracks that are not available elsewhere.

what I learned now is the importance of buying tracks etc. I do have a few tracks that I wanna purchase in the future.

2. It is not accurate 100%. I'd say maybe 80% although this will help you have a starting basis and what not.  Now I read comments of ""oh just  use your ears"". I mean again, some people just don't have references on what sounds good, or what else is there. it's a learning process. I also learned to trust my ears. Once you get a hang of ""low quality tracks"" it would be easier to hear them in the future. it's just a matter of training your ears I guess.

3. More than the spectrogram, i use both spek and fakin' the funk and there would be instances that some are in a way okay in your ears, then go for it, some are also really bad and it makes you say ""oh okay no wonder it sounded weird""

4. I used mac and love organizing my library but it's so hard to move files etc but I just realized that you can use Fakin' The Funk to move to different folders etc and its much easier. you can play it in the software too and im enjoying sorting my tracks here.

5. I have bought tracks from traxsource and some of them has a cut off at 16khz but still look good so it would really depend on the track, how it sounds like, what year it was produced etc. I mainly play music between 2000-2015.  not all have a good sets of speakers to hear any differences or the quality of the track. I only noticed some differences in other speakers that are way better than mine.

6. Vinyl is better yada yada oh please we know it you play vinyl. but not everyone wants to bring a 100000kg or vinyl to play at a coffee shop or small places.

7. Still not sure? just redownload or keep it aside, there's millions of tracks anyways heheh

8. Volume struggles was a big thing for me, felt like the tracks we're too loud turns out they are just not 320kbps or they were edit or whatever and you can see it from the spectrogram. what I would suggest is find a track that the volume is normal and use that as your basis. if tracks are ""louder"" they are most likely not good quality.

so for me, it is worth it at a starting point. it's not for everyone but for anyone who wants to do it i think you should give it a shot especially if you have a big library.

Again, im no expert and there are alot of answers here and there just trust your instinct and if this was helpful then you are welcome.

please stop with the negative comments of this and that. this might not be your cup of tea but my little OCD ass is happy.

I worked as a barista/bartender for about a year and this week I've been going back to that place of employment to hangout and do some writing.  It's cozy, they've got good coffee, and I can visit with old coworkers. 

Today I was in there at open at 9am, my old boss came over at 9:30am and asked me if I wanted to try a new bourbon cocktail they're releasing soon - she knows I love whiskey and bourbon.  I politely declined, and to her credit when she came over she asked ""are you drinking right now because -"" so no shade to her, she was very sweet when I told her I was trying to do 90 days and was currently at 10. 

but it's just the thought I ABSOLUTELY would've said yes to bourbon at 9:30am.  Before I'd had breakfast. I probably would've loved it and then tried to swindle her into letting me have the whole cocktail.  Knowing I was waiting on maintenance for my car to be done, for me to walk back to pickup my car and drive home. Hell I've done it before, the last time I was there waiting for my car to be done I had 3 cocktails.

Confession:

So I had some time to waste today — coffee flowing, Wi-Fi weak, and the universe clearly up to something — and I thought, Why not check an old friend’s posts? Famous words. One click led to another, and then… oh honey… there it was.

My ex’s wedding photos and video.

No, I didn't pass out laughing or crying. I was quite amused. 

The songs? They all had a shared story. Did he tell you? Madrigal Parking lot 200X. Ask the best man he was the one who helped pull it off. 

The motif? The exact color palette...Emerald green! Giiiiirlll, i dunno how he got you to werk that shade... Clearly it ain't your color.

The flowers? Roses and lily of the valley. Roses. And lily of the actual valley. oooh boy... Thats my birth month flower. Did you know? 

The venue? Been there his mom pulled strings. I bet you knew that. The flower arc? And butterflies.. live butterflies. I believe they are messengers carrying our heartfelt wishes. 

And the vow… oh, the vow. Word-for-word something I heard and read a a thousand times over. Ask if he means it. I wish he does now. 

And the friends I cut off? There they were. Smiling. Clapping. Background actors in the telenovela that is their life. People I left because loyalty wasn’t their thing. Seeing them there? Iconic. Proof that my life upgrade was necessary.

And let me tell you something — I’m not mad. Not jealous. Not bitter. I’m actually entertained. Watching someone else live my recycled daydreams? Juicy. Cinematic. Hilarious.

Sure, I may not have the dream wedding I imagined — the songs, the palette, the flowers, the fantasy — but watching that “almost-life” unfold without me didn’t break me.

It gave me relief. Sweet, quiet, fabulous relief.

And here’s the truth: I don’t have to be married. I just want happy years with the right one.

Someone who doesn’t recycle my dreams, who builds new ones with me, with love, laughter… and maybe a little champagne (or coffee — let’s be honest) for good measure.

And when that day comes… oh honey. The universe better take note. The world better sit down and watch. Because that, my friends… Diva-level perfection.

Until then? Coffee flowing, hair perfect, side-eye sharp, and the laughter unstoppable.

1pfdcja,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1pfdcja/the_room_he_kept_empty/,The Room He Kept Empty," He woke before dawn, not to any urgency but to the habitual ache just beneath his ribs. The house was cold, the thin light on the floor coming from street lamps through the window. Long shadows leaned against the walls. He sat on the edge of the bed and rubbed away the crust from his eyes, then pushed himself up. 

 The floor was cold beneath his feet. He moved quietly so as not to wake the silence. In the kitchen, he filled the kettle and set it to boil. The clink of the cups felt louder in the morning air. Coffee brewing, he pressed his palms against the chipped countertop and stared across the room toward the hall. 

 The door at the end of the hall sat closed, unlocked but shut and he made sure his eyes didn’t linger too long. He poured the steaming black coffee, took a sip, and then turned away to begin the slow practice of preparing himself for the day. The house stretched awake in muffled creaks. He brushed past the door again on his way to leave.

 That night he unlocked the front door with a tired hand, the familiar creak announcing his return before he even stepped inside. The air smelled stale, cold and heavy like the house hadn’t moved all day. He hung his coat by the door and made his way quietly toward the living room. 

 The soft glow of the television flickered against the wall as he settled into his armchair. He poured himself a glass of something neat from the bottle on the side table, the amber liquid catching the light like quiet consolation.

 The room was empty except for the hum of the TV and the clinking of glass on glass from increasingly clumsy pours. He watched without really seeing the screen. When he began to doze off he stood and stretched, the glass heavy in his fingers. 

Heading toward the bedroom, he felt the familiar pull of unease as he passed the door. Then a flicker caught his eye, shadows shifting beneath the crack at its base. They moved slowly, deliberately, he saw a familiarity in their shape. He stopped, heart tightening. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes, the shadows vanished. He turned away, forcing himself to bed. Sleep came slow and heavy with silence.

 The morning light crept through the curtains. He woke to the sharp buzz of his phone on the nightstand, the vibration rattling against the wood. He squinted at the screen. It was a picture of him embracing a woman lovingly and across the screen it read “Maggie.” His jaw tightened as he answered.

""Yeah?” His voice came out rough.

Her words came muffled through the other end.

""No, I'm fine. I don't need you checking on me...Counseling?”
 
He barked a harsh laugh, sitting up now, sheets tangling around his legs. 

“I told you I don't need to talk to anyone.""

Her muffled voice continued after a brief pause.

“Don’t. Just don’t.""

 The house seemed to hold its breath. From down the hall, a faint clatter like a door being shut in a hurry. He froze, grip whitening on the phone.

“Look, I said I’m fine. I have to go."" 

 He jabbed the end call button, the screen going dark. His heart racing in the sudden silence, eyes flicking toward the hall. He grabbed a pistol from the night stand and made his way cautiously through the house, meticulously searching the rooms. All but one. The house was empty. He made his way back to the bedroom, passing a glance at the closed room in the hall before preparing for his day.

 That night, he fumbled the key into the lock three times before the door gave way, spilling into the dim house. The world tilted as he kicked the door shut behind him. He didn't have much patience, the bottle was half empty and clutched in one fist. 

 He sat in the dark in his arm chair, illuminated by the flickering TV. The occasional clink of glass hitting his teeth. Suddenly, filtering through the on screen dialogue he heard laughter. His head snapped up, liquor sloshing over his fingers. He muted the TV to make sure he actually heard it. 

 Breath shallow, he listened intensely for any sign of what he had just heard. Silence. He turned off the TV and lurched forward choosing to call it a night. Collapsing face down into the pillows. Sleep dragged him under fast. 

 Hours later or maybe minutes, a sharp scream ripped through the dark. Terrified. He bolted upright, heart slamming. Barefoot and shirtless, he grabbed his pistol and stumbled out into the hall. Palms slick, he went straight to where he heard the sound. Straight to the door. His hand hovered over the knob, trembling. He turned it.
 
 The door swung open, exhaling a breath of stale air. He staggered in. Quickly observing his surroundings, he lowers his pistol. It was once a child's bedroom, now empty. The signs were still there though. Bathed in the weak light from the hallway, pink walls stood bright.

 For a moment he could see it as it had been. Posters of cartoon animals, the small bed rumpled, pillows fluffed as if she’d just climbed out, toys scattered across the carpet. A plastic tea set, a stuffed bear.

 His gaze snagged a corner where a low table used to sit with the lamp on it. The shadow puppet carousel from a rainy afternoon, sheets draped nearby. Further in, there would be blankets sagged in a half-built fort, pillows tossed. 

 The closet door hung ajar, the dark mouth revealing an empty space where there used to be coats on hooks and shoes lined below. The perfect hiding spot to leap out and send her shrieking in delighted terror. The laughter, the shadows, the screams... all echoed in the empty room before him.

 He sank to his knees, chest heaving. There was nothing here but memories. They all came flooding back, no matter how hard he tried to drown them out. His life was once full of joy, and laughter. He began to cry clenching his fist smashing them into the floor. His hands became bloody but the whiskey numbed them.

 After the rage had subsided he slumped over on the ground staring at his pistol beside him. He lay there, and after a while he just stayed there. Quietly he said something to himself, but not for himself.

“Happy birthday baby.”

 Hours passed. He stayed in place, every ounce of pain in his hands now fully felt but no longer accompanied by sadness. Not much of anything, really. He lay there, hollowed out, filled with nothing. Just like the room he kept empty.",1,1764986337.0,shortstory,0,1.0,False
1pfdbnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1pfdbnr/our_silent_park/,Our Silent Park,"Another beautiful day in my 754-square-foot personal paradise. Not exactly a prison, but it might as well be. I will more than likely never leave my apartment again in my life, I haven’t left in nearly 8 months… I have no reason to leave. Everything that I need is right here. I’ve stockpiled every single thing that I could need right here in my home. I wake up in my single-sized bed and stretch, readying myself for another day in my single-sized life. I have my plate full, get on the treadmill, and jog a few miles in the morning and another few miles in the afternoon. Between my runs, I'm reading from the stockpile of books I have. And my personal favorite pastime is the balcony.

I take my steaming cup of coffee and step out onto the balcony overlooking the town below, and in the distance, the most beautiful park in the whole state. I can still close my eyes and imagine myself walking down there now. Of course, I have to open them eventually and return to my balcony. My binoculars are my most trusted companion in these months of isolation. I can observe the entire town from safety and watch everyone below going about their lives. I've even taken up bird watching in my forced extreme early retirement. I have a few books on ornithology that I've studied front to back extensively. I can identify any bird that makes its way into my path now. This close to the city, it is unfortunately mostly the carrion birds or the flying rats that make their nests in the surrounding buildings. But on the best of days, I can peer into the park and see the most beautiful angels of flight.

I nestle into the perch of my roost, settling in with my morning coffee. I exhale deeply, close my eyes for a moment, and take the walk through the streets in my mind, entering the park. I can hear the robins singing the morning anthems and the flapping of the ducks in the pond. My feet crunching on the leaves as I walk through, letting the sun warm the blood in my veins. A flash of color catches my eye suddenly, and I snap forward sharply! I adjust the sights of my binoculars, and the figure sharpens in front of me. Not a bird, but a beautiful sight to behold nonetheless.

 The color was a flash of sun glowing off a perfect head of hair on top of the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I've seen basically every person in this city. We don’t get many visitors these days. But she came out of nowhere. Blonde with flashes of red streaks shining straight into my lenses. I adjust them and take in her full form. She must be right around my age and clearly kept herself in shape, explains the midday stroll through the park on what I'm assuming to be her lunch break. Her uniform matched that of a health food grocery store a few blocks away. So odd that I've never seen her here before. I stare for what feels like eternity. Her nametag comes into view. “Cleo,” Like the great god queen herself. I don’t even know how many breaths were taken as I watched her walk through the park. She walked in the same path I would have taken and closed her eyes, and took deep breaths in the same manner I have a hundred times and more in my mind. Inhaling the perfume of the flowers and trees and exhaling the disgust of the city. Letting the sun warm her pale skin. I reach out, brushing the stray hair away from her face and slowly stroking her cheek. If only.

I watched her throughout the park until she walked back out. I watched the area on the path where I had last seen her for what must have been another half hour, just hoping she would return. What was I to do for the rest of my day? I wanted to fill up every waking hour with images of her. I finally placed my binoculars back down. What point is bird watching anymore? I had caught sight of the most perfect specimen of all, and just as quickly, she had flown away. I leaned back in my chair and gazed into what became a void of nothingness in front of me. I finally picked up my cup and brought it to my lips, sipped, and immediately spat out my frigid cup of coffee. “Shit,” I exclaimed in a hushed breath before returning inside. There would be no evening run today, and there wouldn’t even be an evening meal. What was the point? What exercise would speed my heart the way she had? What meal would vanquish my hunger the way she could? I collapsed on my bed and gazed into the void of my ceiling for hours as my eyes unfocused, her image became clearer to me.

Clearly, I let this heavenly image take me to bed because I woke the next morning earlier than usual, the sun just cresting the horizon out the window. I groaned and stretched, rubbing tight muscles loose. The worst sleep I've gotten in ages. I closed my eyes and thought of the day ahead. There's no point in fading into nothingness in bed all day for a woman I may never see again. Even just thinking of her had my heart fluttering already. I exhaled deeply and went about my routine, trying to draw my mind away from the park as much as I could. I found myself out there with my coffee after a few hours. “Just look for a few familiar birds, enjoy your walk, and leave. It's that simple.” I sat down, sipped my coffee, and picked up the lenses.

I choked my hot coffee, searing my throat into a cough. There she was! As if she were waiting for me this morning. She was sitting this time in the park, eating a meal. Yes, she must have started coming to this park for her lunch. So few people were even in the park these days, but she clearly fully appreciated the privacy and tranquility of my spiritual oasis. I was mesmerized again instantaneously; her image was downright intoxicating to me. I chuckled as a bit of her lunch dripped onto her chin and she brushed it away. “So silly, Cleo.” I watched her for the remainder of her time there until she left the park again. As she faded from sight, I bid her farewell. “Until tomorrow, my sweet.”

I continued my day with a whole new vigor. Two days in a row, there's no way she would not be returning tomorrow! I jumped on the treadmill full of this newfound energy. I  felt a purpose in life, realizing the monotony that I had fallen into for so long. Who knows, I may even leave this apartment someday. Highly unlikely, still knowing what that meant for me… but for Cleo, just maybe.

A new routine had formed in my life, formed solely around my love for Cleo. We would sit together every day, me on the balcony, her in the park. She mostly used the park for a daily walk, taking in the scenery, enjoying the beautiful oasis, just the two of us. Some days she would take her meal in the park as well. She always ate the same thing; it made me smile; she had routines of her own. I would catch myself talking to her from afar if only my words could reach her. I spoke of stories from my childhood, my family when they were still around. Occasionally, she walked, and she would stop to breathe in the air, and her eyes would drift in my direction, and for those brief moments, I reached out to her. We were one for even a few seconds there.

Then came the day when I woke up, went through the usual motions, and waited. It got later and later. She wasn’t there. What if something happened to her?! I waited for her all afternoon until the sun sank low, and no sign of her whatsoever. I paced back and forth; panic set in for me. What if she got moved to a different store? Or moved to a different town? Maybe something happened with her family, or what if something happened to her?

I didn’t sleep at all that night. I found myself on the balcony staring into the park illuminated by the moon, wrapped in the blanket from my bed. When the sun eventually rose, I started my coffee. I would need the energy. I washed my face, sipped my coffee, used the restroom, and came back to the balcony. The image before me sent me over the edge.

Cleo was there, but she wasn’t alone. She was with a small group of what I assume were her friends. She had never come to the park with anyone ever! It's fine, I said, she has friends, maybe she enjoyed her day off, maybe went to a party, and she wanted to show them our park. No issue there. Then I saw him. This weaselly little punk was all over her hands exploring every possible inch you could explore of someone in public, and a few you probably shouldn’t. I was seething. My blood boiling! I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. Not only did she blow me off and then bring strangers to OUR park! But a man, not even a man, I wouldn’t give him the satisfaction of even thinking of him as a man on an equal level to me. And then it happened…. They kissed, and she initiated it! What kind of woman had I fallen for? She probably just met him last night and hooked up at this party, and here she was basically devouring him in front of me! Her mouth was glued to his for minutes before she took it even further. She kissed down to his neck and “Jesus Christ! Disgusting!” I could see her teeth as she was playfully biting at his neck. My stomach turned I was going to be sick. I saw them collapse onto the grass. She was practically tearing at his clothes. And her friends all sat and watched like hyenas, laughing and encouraging her. I darted back inside, pacing, no pounding back and forth across the room. My eyes darted to every object in the room. In a flash, the mug I had kept for so many years, the last gift from my mother, smashed against the far wall. I collapsed on the floor, throwing my head back against the wall. I loved the mug. One of the very few favorable memories of her before she left. “ She was a whore anyway. My mother, Cleo. They're the same, they just play with my emotions and use me to keep themselves busy until someone more important comes along.”

I stayed there for hours. I finally stood and went to the small closet by the door and retrieved the broom and dustpan there. I swept up the mess and made myself busy tidying the rest of my apartment. All dishes were done, all of my books reorganized clothes folded and put away. I finally could sit on my bed and stare at the floor. After another half hour of bleak emptiness, I reached under my bed and pulled out the small shoebox. I had destroyed the gift from my mother, but my father's gift remained. I removed the lid and unwrapped the bandana that held my father's revolver. I never kept it loaded, and I had only cleaned it twice since he had left it to me. This would make the third time. I sat at my dining table, a small lamp illuminating my work area. I spent the next hour meticulously disassembling and cleaning the gun before putting it back together. I used the bandana in the box to clean the rounds that had rolled around in the accumulated dust. I stacked them in a neat line in front of me. I breathed deeply and slid one into the chamber and spun it round. I held it to my temple and thought of the other two times I had tried this. Each time an empty click led me to another agonizing extension of a mediocre life of disappointment. This has to be it, this is 50/50, can't click three times. I closed my eyes. The image of Cleo filled my mind's eye. The first time I had seen her. Then the image shifted; the last time I had seen her with him. I screamed in my mind and squeezed.

I sat on my bed an hour later, sliding the box back to its place. Another click, better luck next time. I lay in bed and started to drift to sleep from pure exhaustion, if anything else. The image from the park filled my mind again. I saw her and him in the grass and her friends. Her friends. Her four friends…. Four and her and him. Six of them. Six chambers, six rounds, six dead. I sat up and pulled the box out quickly, throwing the lid across the room as I did. I chambered six rounds into the revolver. It hadn't held a full chamber since my father owned it. I only ever needed the one. Feeling it in my hand, it felt heavier like a hammer. A hammer. A tool. The right tool for the right job. I smiled then.

I placed the gun on my kitchen table, it almost felt like I couldn’t let go of it, like it had become a part of me. I needed to rest. I placed a new mug, a blank and boring mug, in the place for the coffee maker and set the timer for the next morning. I slept soundly that night, more soundly than I had in days. I woke to the smell of the fresh brewing coffee, smiling. My smile faded when I saw the rain pounding outside. “Fuck!” I hadn't checked the weather in so long. We were due for rain. Rain meant everyone stayed inside, though. I needed them in the park. I would have to wait. No matter, I wouldn’t let it get me down. I was determined, I had a plan.

I went through the day as any other before her. I ran on the treadmill, I read my books, ate, and peered out into the park when the rain lightened up. The day had come and gone, and the rain hadn't let up. I checked the revolver before bed. Nothing had changed it was still fully loaded and ready to go. I checked in with myself mentally. I saw him, I saw her. I was still ready to go. I lay down for the night less peaceful, more restless. Anxious. No, excited.

I woke again to rain, frustrated, I went through the motions again. Another day of rain followed, and I was furious. I stood on the balcony, rain beating against me like small fists as if trying to beat me down. It was as if god himself had opened the skies just to delay my vengeance. I stared into the sky. “You won't stop this. She will be mine.” I stood there staring into the park until my body was soaked to the bone and my fingers had lost any sensation. Just as I turned to go inside, I saw something move in the corner of my eye. A small figure with wet, matted down blonde hair. I yanked up my binoculars. It was Cleo! She had come to the park. I laughed loudly into the rain.

I stared at her there for only mere minutes, but felt like hours as the rain lightened up. I focused in on her face. She wasn’t smiling, and she was alone again. I scanned the park for her friends, her… him. No one else was in the park. It was just her and I. As it always should have been. That’s fine, I can be persuasive. I would make her lead me to them, at least to him. I stared at her more, adjusting till I was staring almost directly in her face. There was something there. I couldn’t place it. No matter. We would be together soon. I stepped inside and quickly dried off, and put on my old raincoat I hadn't used in ages, and placed the revolver in the pocket. It was heavy again. As it should be. I approached the door and stood there at the locks. I had installed the extra locks within the last year. I never wanted to leave. She did this to me. Maybe she was always meant to be here. To get me out of here. I thought it might be love that helped me escape here, but it ended up being hate. I turned each lock and pulled the door open. It creaked so loudly for months upon months, over a hundred days since I had even stepped out of here. I walked down the hall and made my way down the stairwell. Each step I felt the revolver slap in my jacket pocket against my side. A constant rhythm, a drumbeat towards destruction. I reached the sidewalk below and looked around at all of the cars frozen in the street. The gutters were swollen with rain the roads ran like small rivers. I stared up into the heavens again. “Trying to wash it all away again, aren't you?” I chuckled and walked briskly to the park. At one point, my solid steps turned into a jog, and finally, I was running to the park. I was out, I was free, and I had purpose.

Finally, I saw the trees and the pond, the grass overgrown and untreated for so long. I reached down and touched it. It had been so long. I looked up. There she was, only yards away from me, facing away. As if I didn’t exist to her. I shouted above the rain, “Cleo! You look at me! I want you to see me!” She turned towards me slowly, and there we were. Finally, after these long weeks and days watching her from afar. She was even more beautiful and perfect than I thought she was. This close, I could see her eyes, pale and cloudy blue. She looked at me, and I reached into my pocket, revealing the revolver. Most people would scream, run, beg, and plead. She never took her eyes off mine. The revolver didn’t exist to her. She only saw me. I raised it to eye level, and she approached me slowly. “NO! You stop, you stay away from me! You don’t understand, I dreamed of being here with you, this was our park! And you gave it to him! Why?” She continued walking towards me. I shook my head hard. She was only a few feet away. I backed up and stared at her. She was so close now. After all this time, I could practically reach out to touch her. I could smell her.

We stared at each other there, and she stepped forward again, and so did I. I stepped again and lowered the gun slowly. She reached out to me. And I to her, and our fingers entwined, I felt her grip so strong, her skin so soft. We pulled into each other. “Cleo, I love you,” She said, nothing she didn’t need to. She pulled me in close and finally, after all this time, our lips met in sweet, sweet heavenly bliss. Her mouth opened, and the smell of putrid flesh filled my nostrils as her teeth sank through my tongue. The blood flooded my mouth just as the rain had flooded the street. Her nails raked down my back, tearing whole strips of fabric and flesh away. I pulled back, and she only pulled me in tighter and closer as she kissed and ripped at the flesh of my face. I collapsed at that point, and she mounted me. She sat back as blood streamed down my face. I could only make garbled choking noises. I looked into her eyes again, the pupils completely clouded over now. She lowered her mouth of rough jagged teeth set in rotten decayed gums right into my neck and came back with streams of sinew, veins, and meat. She swallowed hard, and I almost saw her smile even though she had no lips or really any flesh at all in the area around her mouth. But I felt myself relax into her. I let her take me. Cleo, my love, my god queen. She had freed me from this hell on earth. We would be together now eternally.

 

The soldier approached the park, the sun beating hard on him from above. He had walked for days after the storm that felt like it would wash the world away. He reached the city and went to the town center in search of survivors. He saw them there. Something he had never seen before. Two of these demons, these flesh eaters, an undead man and woman, but they were locked together hand in hand. He took the sight in. It was so foreign to him. It seemed like these things were lovers before the curse of this world took them. But it also didn’t make sense, the woman was so much more decayed than him. Didn’t matter; he raised his rifle and let out two quick shots. Their skulls exploded that was all of them. He scanned and approached, looking down at them lying there together. Hand in hand as lovers should be. Together forever.",3,1764986263.0,TheCrypticCompendium,2,1.0,False
1pfd9ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/joinmeatthecampfire/comments/1pfd9ts/our_silent_park/,Our Silent Park,"Another beautiful day in my 754-square-foot personal paradise. Not exactly a prison, but it might as well be. I will more than likely never leave my apartment again in my life, I haven’t left in nearly 8 months… I have no reason to leave. Everything that I need is right here. I’ve stockpiled every single thing that I could need right here in my home. I wake up in my single-sized bed and stretch, readying myself for another day in my single-sized life. I have my plate full, get on the treadmill, and jog a few miles in the morning and another few miles in the afternoon. Between my runs, I'm reading from the stockpile of books I have. And my personal favorite pastime is the balcony.

I take my steaming cup of coffee and step out onto the balcony overlooking the town below, and in the distance, the most beautiful park in the whole state. I can still close my eyes and imagine myself walking down there now. Of course, I have to open them eventually and return to my balcony. My binoculars are my most trusted companion in these months of isolation. I can observe the entire town from safety and watch everyone below going about their lives. I've even taken up bird watching in my forced extreme early retirement. I have a few books on ornithology that I've studied front to back extensively. I can identify any bird that makes its way into my path now. This close to the city, it is unfortunately mostly the carrion birds or the flying rats that make their nests in the surrounding buildings. But on the best of days, I can peer into the park and see the most beautiful angels of flight.

I nestle into the perch of my roost, settling in with my morning coffee. I exhale deeply, close my eyes for a moment, and take the walk through the streets in my mind, entering the park. I can hear the robins singing the morning anthems and the flapping of the ducks in the pond. My feet crunching on the leaves as I walk through, letting the sun warm the blood in my veins. A flash of color catches my eye suddenly, and I snap forward sharply! I adjust the sights of my binoculars, and the figure sharpens in front of me. Not a bird, but a beautiful sight to behold nonetheless.

 The color was a flash of sun glowing off a perfect head of hair on top of the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I've seen basically every person in this city. We don’t get many visitors these days. But she came out of nowhere. Blonde with flashes of red streaks shining straight into my lenses. I adjust them and take in her full form. She must be right around my age and clearly kept herself in shape, explains the midday stroll through the park on what I'm assuming to be her lunch break. Her uniform matched that of a health food grocery store a few blocks away. So odd that I've never seen her here before. I stare for what feels like eternity. Her nametag comes into view. “Cleo,” Like the great god queen herself. I don’t even know how many breaths were taken as I watched her walk through the park. She walked in the same path I would have taken and closed her eyes, and took deep breaths in the same manner I have a hundred times and more in my mind. Inhaling the perfume of the flowers and trees and exhaling the disgust of the city. Letting the sun warm her pale skin. I reach out, brushing the stray hair away from her face and slowly stroking her cheek. If only.

I watched her throughout the park until she walked back out. I watched the area on the path where I had last seen her for what must have been another half hour, just hoping she would return. What was I to do for the rest of my day? I wanted to fill up every waking hour with images of her. I finally placed my binoculars back down. What point is bird watching anymore? I had caught sight of the most perfect specimen of all, and just as quickly, she had flown away. I leaned back in my chair and gazed into what became a void of nothingness in front of me. I finally picked up my cup and brought it to my lips, sipped, and immediately spat out my frigid cup of coffee. “Shit,” I exclaimed in a hushed breath before returning inside. There would be no evening run today, and there wouldn’t even be an evening meal. What was the point? What exercise would speed my heart the way she had? What meal would vanquish my hunger the way she could? I collapsed on my bed and gazed into the void of my ceiling for hours as my eyes unfocused, her image became clearer to me.

Clearly, I let this heavenly image take me to bed because I woke the next morning earlier than usual, the sun just cresting the horizon out the window. I groaned and stretched, rubbing tight muscles loose. The worst sleep I've gotten in ages. I closed my eyes and thought of the day ahead. There's no point in fading into nothingness in bed all day for a woman I may never see again. Even just thinking of her had my heart fluttering already.

The image of Cleo filled my mind's eye. The first time I had seen her. Then the image shifted; the last time I had seen her with him. I screamed in my mind and squeezed.

I sat on my bed an hour later, sliding the box back to its place. Another click, better luck next time. I lay in bed and started to drift to sleep from pure exhaustion, if anything else. The image from the park filled my mind again. I saw her and him in the grass and her friends. Her friends. Her four friends…. Four and her and him. Six of them. Six chambers, six rounds, six dead.

I only ever needed the one. Feeling it in my hand, it felt heavier like a hammer. A hammer. A tool. The right tool for the right job. I smiled then.

She was only a few feet away. I backed up and stared at her. She was so close now. After all this time, I could practically reach out to touch her. I could smell her.

We stared at each other there, and she stepped forward again, and so did I. I stepped again and lowered the gun slowly. She reached out to me. And I to her, and our fingers entwined, I felt her grip so strong, her skin so soft. We pulled into each other. “Cleo, I love you,” She said, nothing she didn’t need to. She pulled me in close and finally, after all this time, our lips met in sweet, sweet heavenly bliss. Her mouth opened, and the smell of putrid flesh filled my nostrils as her teeth sank through my tongue. The blood flooded my mouth just as the rain had flooded the street. Her nails raked down my back, tearing whole strips of fabric and flesh away. I pulled back, and she only pulled me in tighter and closer as she kissed and ripped at the flesh of my face.

I can’t get a job because of the shitty job market here (still actively applying regardless) and my mom refuses to give me money for any of my necessities (including school lunch). Both of my parents work and we make well enough money I just don’t understand why they always complain abt not having money everytime I ask for something. Yesterday my dad was dropping me off at school and they had a deal at my local coffee place for 2$ and I asked if we can go (it was on the way to school btw) and he got mad at me and started saying stuff like “ I’m doing you a huge favour by dropping you off and I have places to be” and mind you he leaves the house at 2pm every single day (he has his own buisness). And another thing to add on is that even the days my dad is home, I’m the one doing ALL the house work ontop of school and managing two sports teams every other day. I cook , make handmaid rotis, make everyone’s lunch, iron clothes, clean everything and what not and I don’t want to sound like I’m boasting about what I do but I feel like if I’m doing so much I feel like he should be able to buy me a 2$ iced coffee every 3 months. Like I don’t mean to sound ungrateful or anything but but they’re always shoving the fact that we don’t have enough money down my throat all the damn time. My parents have money to give to their siblings and relatives back home but I can’t get a fricking 2$ coffee. I don’t even go out with my friends or anytning like that unlike my younger sister I haven’t gone out with them since July and they say stuff like how I’m always out with my friends and spending money. It’s so annoying. The other day we were at the mall cuz I had to exchange something cuz it was tight for me and my sister was like “oh I’ll just take it” and I was like no cuz then I won’t have enough money to get myself something else if I do end up returning it. And that’s exactly what happened, she got herself a few shirts and two pants and like some jewlery while all I got was a pair of jeans that were on sale for $15. And this isn’t the first time it’s happened this ALWAYS happens. And when I finally saw something I liked I asked my mom if I can get it and she was like “no we already spent too much money” like",4,1764986096.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I was her only child. I was her sole caregiver for many years as she battled stage 4B cancer twice. I was her sole visitor during her last 19 days of life while she was in the hospital. I did it all alone. ALL OF IT. Brushing her hair, feeding her ALL OF IT. Anyone who has been a caregiver to a person that sick knows what I mean by ALL OF IT. Friends and family said “they wanted to remember her the way she was” rather than see her emaciated and dying of cancer so no one visited her for more than a year. Even when they found out she was in the hospital those last 19 days they said the same thing. She was mad she had become immobile, that she had to be in the hospital, she blamed me for everything anyone could be blamed for. I am traumatized by my entire life with her as my mother and even more traumatized by her last 19 days of life, that her last text to me was that she hoped I would “just die already and leave her alone”. I had a panic attack at the hospital to the point the coroner and 2 sheriffs deputies came to check on me following the incident fearing I was suicidal. Her 19th day in the hospital I chose to not go there first thing that morning but to shower drink some coffee and do some self care then they called and said she had taken her last breath and been declared dead. I put my shoes on and drove to the hospital. I arrived at the hospital 17 minutes after she died. I can’t get the image of her last days and her laying there dead out of my mind. The hospital staff ignored me being there except to have me sign the papers for her to be released to the mortuary. I was left alone with her and to gather her belongings. I’ve never felt so alone and so lonely. So helpless. So hopeless. So angry. Just so everything one could feel. I remember it all so vividly but it’s almost like what I remember is someone’s else’s memories. Because I’ve detached from them but can’t get them out of my head. I feel guilty that I didn’t do enough for her. I feel depressed so much of my life was lost on her. For her. Because of her. That I allowed it all. But then again the guilt I didn’t do enough. I just can’t get the image of her laying there lifeless out of my head, that I was there alone. No support no help no one to cry with or to. I’m wrecked. I don’t know where to go from here.

1pfd87d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Write_Right/comments/1pfd87d/our_silent_park/,Our Silent Park,"Another beautiful day in my 754-square-foot personal paradise. Not exactly a prison, but it might as well be. I will more than likely never leave my apartment again in my life, I haven’t left in nearly 8 months… I have no reason to leave. Everything that I need is right here. I’ve stockpiled every single thing that I could need right here in my home. I wake up in my single-sized bed and stretch, readying myself for another day in my single-sized life. I have my plate full, get on the treadmill, and jog a few miles in the morning and another few miles in the afternoon. Between my runs, I'm reading from the stockpile of books I have. And my personal favorite pastime is the balcony.

I take my steaming cup of coffee and step out onto the balcony overlooking the town below, and in the distance, the most beautiful park in the whole state. I can still close my eyes and imagine myself walking down there now. Of course, I have to open them eventually and return to my balcony. My binoculars are my most trusted companion in these months of isolation. I can observe the entire town from safety and watch everyone below going about their lives. I've even taken up bird watching in my forced extreme early retirement. I have a few books on ornithology that I've studied front to back extensively. I can identify any bird that makes its way into my path now. This close to the city, it is unfortunately mostly the carrion birds or the flying rats that make their nests in the surrounding buildings. But on the best of days, I can peer into the park and see the most beautiful angels of flight.

I nestle into the perch of my roost, settling in with my morning coffee. I exhale deeply, close my eyes for a moment, and take the walk through the streets in my mind, entering the park. I can hear the robins singing the morning anthems and the flapping of the ducks in the pond. My feet crunching on the leaves as I walk through, letting the sun warm the blood in my veins. A flash of color catches my eye suddenly, and I snap forward sharply! I adjust the sights of my binoculars, and the figure sharpens in front of me. Not a bird, but a beautiful sight to behold nonetheless.

 The color was a flash of sun glowing off a perfect head of hair on top of the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I've seen basically every person in this city. We don’t get many visitors these days. But she came out of nowhere. Blonde with flashes of red streaks shining straight into my lenses. I adjust them and take in her full form. She must be right around my age and clearly kept herself in shape, explains the midday stroll through the park on what I'm assuming to be her lunch break. Her uniform matched that of a health food grocery store a few blocks away. So odd that I've never seen her here before. I stare for what feels like eternity. Her nametag comes into view. “Cleo,” Like the great god queen herself. I don’t even know how many breaths were taken as I watched her walk through the park. She walked in the same path I would have taken and closed her eyes, and took deep breaths in the same manner I have a hundred times and more in my mind. Inhaling the perfume of the flowers and trees and exhaling the disgust of the city. Letting the sun warm her pale skin. I reach out, brushing the stray hair away from her face and slowly stroking her cheek. If only.

I watched her throughout the park until she walked back out. I watched the area on the path where I had last seen her for what must have been another half hour, just hoping she would return. What was I to do for the rest of my day? I wanted to fill up every waking hour with images of her. I finally placed my binoculars back down. What point is bird watching anymore? I had caught sight of the most perfect specimen of all, and just as quickly, she had flown away. I leaned back in my chair and gazed into what became a void of nothingness in front of me. I finally picked up my cup and brought it to my lips, sipped, and immediately spat out my frigid cup of coffee. “Shit,” I exclaimed in a hushed breath before returning inside. There would be no evening run today, and there wouldn’t even be an evening meal. What was the point? What exercise would speed my heart the way she had? What meal would vanquish my hunger the way she could? I collapsed on my bed and gazed into the void of my ceiling for hours as my eyes unfocused, her image became clearer to me.

Clearly, I let this heavenly image take me to bed because I woke the next morning earlier than usual, the sun just cresting the horizon out the window. I groaned and stretched, rubbing tight muscles loose. The worst sleep I've gotten in ages. I closed my eyes and thought of the day ahead. There's no point in fading into nothingness in bed all day for a woman I may never see again. Even just thinking of her had my heart fluttering already. I exhaled deeply and went about my routine, trying to draw my mind away from the park as much as I could. I found myself out there with my coffee after a few hours. “Just look for a few familiar birds, enjoy your walk, and leave. It's that simple.” I sat down, sipped my coffee, and picked up the lenses.

I choked my hot coffee, searing my throat into a cough. There she was! As if she were waiting for me this morning. She was sitting this time in the park, eating a meal. Yes, she must have started coming to this park for her lunch. So few people were even in the park these days, but she clearly fully appreciated the privacy and tranquility of my spiritual oasis. I was mesmerized again instantaneously; her image was downright intoxicating to me. I chuckled as a bit of her lunch dripped onto her chin and she brushed it away. “So silly, Cleo.” I watched her for the remainder of her time there until she left the park again. As she faded from sight, I bid her farewell. “Until tomorrow, my sweet.”

I continued my day with a whole new vigor. Two days in a row, there's no way she would not be returning tomorrow! I jumped on the treadmill full of this newfound energy. I  felt a purpose in life, realizing the monotony that I had fallen into for so long. Who knows, I may even leave this apartment someday. Highly unlikely, still knowing what that meant for me… but for Cleo, just maybe.

A new routine had formed in my life, formed solely around my love for Cleo. We would sit together every day, me on the balcony, her in the park. She mostly used the park for a daily walk, taking in the scenery, enjoying the beautiful oasis, just the two of us. Some days she would take her meal in the park as well. She always ate the same thing; it made me smile; she had routines of her own. I would catch myself talking to her from afar if only my words could reach her. I spoke of stories from my childhood, my family when they were still around. Occasionally, she walked, and she would stop to breathe in the air, and her eyes would drift in my direction, and for those brief moments, I reached out to her. We were one for even a few seconds there.

Then came the day when I woke up, went through the usual motions, and waited. It got later and later. She wasn’t there. What if something happened to her?! I waited for her all afternoon until the sun sank low, and no sign of her whatsoever. I paced back and forth; panic set in for me. What if she got moved to a different store? Or moved to a different town? Maybe something happened with her family, or what if something happened to her?

I didn’t sleep at all that night. I found myself on the balcony staring into the park illuminated by the moon, wrapped in the blanket from my bed. When the sun eventually rose, I started my coffee. I would need the energy. I washed my face, sipped my coffee, used the restroom, and came back to the balcony. The image before me sent me over the edge.

Cleo was there, but she wasn’t alone. She was with a small group of what I assume were her friends. She had never come to the park with anyone ever! It's fine, I said, she has friends, maybe she enjoyed her day off, maybe went to a party, and she wanted to show them our park. No issue there. Then I saw him. This weaselly little punk was all over her hands exploring every possible inch you could explore of someone in public, and a few you probably shouldn’t. I was seething. My blood boiling! I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. Not only did she blow me off and then bring strangers to OUR park! But a man, not even a man, I wouldn’t give him the satisfaction of even thinking of him as a man on an equal level to me. And then it happened…. They kissed, and she initiated it! What kind of woman had I fallen for? She probably just met him last night and hooked up at this party, and here she was basically devouring him in front of me! Her mouth was glued to his for minutes before she took it even further. She kissed down to his neck and “Jesus Christ! Disgusting!” I could see her teeth as she was playfully biting at his neck. My stomach turned I was going to be sick. I saw them collapse onto the grass. She was practically tearing at his clothes. And her friends all sat and watched like hyenas, laughing and encouraging her. I darted back inside, pacing, no pounding back and forth across the room. My eyes darted to every object in the room. In a flash, the mug I had kept for so many years, the last gift from my mother, smashed against the far wall. I collapsed on the floor, throwing my head back against the wall. I loved the mug. One of the very few favorable memories of her before she left. “ She was a whore anyway. My mother, Cleo. They're the same, they just play with my emotions and use me to keep themselves busy until someone more important comes along.”

I stayed there for hours. I finally stood and went to the small closet by the door and retrieved the broom and dustpan there. I swept up the mess and made myself busy tidying the rest of my apartment. All dishes were done, all of my books reorganized clothes folded and put away. I finally could sit on my bed and stare at the floor. After another half hour of bleak emptiness, I reached under my bed and pulled out the small shoebox. I had destroyed the gift from my mother, but my father's gift remained. I removed the lid and unwrapped the bandana that held my father's revolver. I never kept it loaded, and I had only cleaned it twice since he had left it to me. This would make the third time. I sat at my dining table, a small lamp illuminating my work area. I spent the next hour meticulously disassembling and cleaning the gun before putting it back together. I used the bandana in the box to clean the rounds that had rolled around in the accumulated dust. I stacked them in a neat line in front of me. I breathed deeply and slid one into the chamber and spun it round. I held it to my temple and thought of the other two times I had tried this. Each time an empty click led me to another agonizing extension of a mediocre life of disappointment. This has to be it, this is 50/50, can't click three times. I closed my eyes. The image of Cleo filled my mind's eye. The first time I had seen her. Then the image shifted; the last time I had seen her with him. I screamed in my mind and squeezed.

I sat on my bed an hour later, sliding the box back to its place. Another click, better luck next time. I lay in bed and started to drift to sleep from pure exhaustion, if anything else. The image from the park filled my mind again. I saw her and him in the grass and her friends. Her friends. Her four friends…. Four and her and him. Six of them. Six chambers, six rounds, six dead. I sat up and pulled the box out quickly, throwing the lid across the room as I did. I chambered six rounds into the revolver. It hadn't held a full chamber since my father owned it. I only ever needed the one. Feeling it in my hand, it felt heavier like a hammer. A hammer. A tool. The right tool for the right job. I smiled then.

I placed the gun on my kitchen table, it almost felt like I couldn’t let go of it, like it had become a part of me. I needed to rest. I placed a new mug, a blank and boring mug, in the place for the coffee maker and set the timer for the next morning. I slept soundly that night, more soundly than I had in days. I woke to the smell of the fresh brewing coffee, smiling. My smile faded when I saw the rain pounding outside. “Fuck!” I hadn't checked the weather in so long. We were due for rain. Rain meant everyone stayed inside, though. I needed them in the park. I would have to wait. No matter, I wouldn’t let it get me down. I was determined, I had a plan.

I went through the day as any other before her. I ran on the treadmill, I read my books, ate, and peered out into the park when the rain lightened up. The day had come and gone, and the rain hadn't let up. I checked the revolver before bed. Nothing had changed it was still fully loaded and ready to go. I checked in with myself mentally. I saw him, I saw her. I was still ready to go. I lay down for the night less peaceful, more restless. Anxious. No, excited.

I woke again to rain, frustrated, I went through the motions again. Another day of rain followed, and I was furious. I stood on the balcony, rain beating against me like small fists as if trying to beat me down. It was as if god himself had opened the skies just to delay my vengeance. I stared into the sky. “You won't stop this. She will be mine.” I stood there staring into the park until my body was soaked to the bone and my fingers had lost any sensation. Just as I turned to go inside, I saw something move in the corner of my eye. A small figure with wet, matted down blonde hair. I yanked up my binoculars. It was Cleo! She had come to the park. I laughed loudly into the rain.

I stared at her there for only mere minutes, but felt like hours as the rain lightened up. I focused in on her face. She wasn’t smiling, and she was alone again. I scanned the park for her friends, her… him. No one else was in the park. It was just her and I. As it always should have been. That’s fine, I can be persuasive. I would make her lead me to them, at least to him. I stared at her more, adjusting till I was staring almost directly in her face. There was something there. I couldn’t place it. No matter. We would be together soon. I stepped inside and quickly dried off, and put on my old raincoat I hadn't used in ages, and placed the revolver in the pocket. It was heavy again. As it should be. I approached the door and stood there at the locks. I had installed the extra locks within the last year. I never wanted to leave. She did this to me. Maybe she was always meant to be here. To get me out of here. I thought it might be love that helped me escape here, but it ended up being hate. I turned each lock and pulled the door open. It creaked so loudly for months upon months, over a hundred days since I had even stepped out of here. I walked down the hall and made my way down the stairwell. Each step I felt the revolver slap in my jacket pocket against my side. A constant rhythm, a drumbeat towards destruction. I reached the sidewalk below and looked around at all of the cars frozen in the street. The gutters were swollen with rain the roads ran like small rivers. I stared up into the heavens again. “Trying to wash it all away again, aren't you?” I chuckled and walked briskly to the park. At one point, my solid steps turned into a jog, and finally, I was running to the park. I was out, I was free, and I had purpose.

Finally, I saw the trees and the pond, the grass overgrown and untreated for so long. I reached down and touched it. It had been so long. I looked up. There she was, only yards away from me, facing away. As if I didn’t exist to her. I shouted above the rain, “Cleo! You look at me! I want you to see me!” She turned towards me slowly, and there we were. Finally, after these long weeks and days watching her from afar. She was even more beautiful and perfect than I thought she was. This close, I could see her eyes, pale and cloudy blue. She looked at me, and I reached into my pocket, revealing the revolver. Most people would scream, run, beg, and plead. She never took her eyes off mine. The revolver didn’t exist to her. She only saw me. I raised it to eye level, and she approached me slowly. “NO! You stop, you stay away from me! You don’t understand, I dreamed of being here with you, this was our park! And you gave it to him! Why?” She continued walking towards me. I shook my head hard. She was only a few feet away. I backed up and stared at her. She was so close now. After all this time, I could practically reach out to touch her. I could smell her.

We stared at each other there, and she stepped forward again, and so did I. I stepped again and lowered the gun slowly. She reached out to me. And I to her, and our fingers entwined, I felt her grip so strong, her skin so soft. We pulled into each other. “Cleo, I love you,” She said, nothing she didn’t need to. She pulled me in close and finally, after all this time, our lips met in sweet, sweet heavenly bliss. Her mouth opened, and the smell of putrid flesh filled my nostrils as her teeth sank through my tongue. The blood flooded my mouth just as the rain had flooded the street. Her nails raked down my back, tearing whole strips of fabric and flesh away. I pulled back, and she only pulled me in tighter and closer as she kissed and ripped at the flesh of my face. I collapsed at that point, and she mounted me. She sat back as blood streamed down my face. I could only make garbled choking noises. I looked into her eyes again, the pupils completely clouded over now. She lowered her mouth of rough jagged teeth set in rotten decayed gums right into my neck and came back with streams of sinew, veins, and meat. She swallowed hard, and I almost saw her smile even though she had no lips or really any flesh at all in the area around her mouth. But I felt myself relax into her. I let her take me. Cleo, my love, my god queen. She had freed me from this hell on earth. We would be together now eternally.

I’ve been slowly upgrading my wardrobe and working on myself — losing weight, getting healthier, and trying to feel good about how I look. Sometimes I just want to put on some nice clothes and go out, but honestly… I don’t really have anyone to do that with in this town.

I’m not looking for anything romantic or explicit. I’m open to hanging out with anyone — girl or guy — who just wants some chill company. Maybe grab a coffee, walk around the mall, check out stores, or take a couple of photos of each other (nothing fancy, just normal “hey I look good today” pictures). I’ve always been super reserved about asking people to take my photos, so this is me trying to step out of my comfort zone.

If you’re someone who also likes going out casually and wouldn’t mind trading photos or just spending a bit of time together, hit me up.
I’m thinking sometime in December or early spring works great.

Just trying to socialize a bit more and enjoy normal, wholesome hangouts. 😊

From that moment on, Mitchell and I became mortal enemies.
He drove a car straight into my father’s funeral.
I smashed his mother’s urn on the dock and scattered her ashes into the sea.
Our hatred consumed us, sharp and venomous. We spent ten years wounding each other until we finally wore ourselves out.
He took his crew and left for Mexico.
I stayed in New York and became the city's most sought-after bounty hunter.
But when we met again years later, he was neither my enemy nor the boy I once knew.
He walked into the morgue—into the room where I was lying.
Years later, we finally got the chance to faced each other in silence.

After finishing my job, I hurried back to the small bakery I used as a front to tend to my injuries.
The wall-mounted TV showed Mitchell Harvey's return.
The former golden boy of New York's elite circles, now Mexico's top arms dealer, was back in town. Of course, it was headline news.
I roughly bandaged my wound and moved toward the small memorial corner I kept for my father.
Suddenly, a girl with chin-length hair burst into the shop.
She looked serious but spoke loudly. Clutching red roses, she pointed at the display case. ""I'll take everything here!""
Close behind was Roderick Dunlap, Mitchell's best friend and right-hand man.
When he saw me, he froze, his expression tightening. ""Yas, maybe we should go somewhere else?""
The girl refused immediately. ""No way!
""I brought Mitch desserts from here before. He said they were amazing. It's his birthday today. I need to get more.""
She gave me a pleading look. ""Ma'am, my fiancé's returning today. He loves your pastries. Could I use your space for a birthday surprise?""
I couldn't refuse, so I nodded.
""Could we get some extra desserts?"" she asked.
I agreed, noticing my fresh bandage was already bleeding through.
I hid my hand under my apron and walked unsteadily toward the kitchen.
It wasn't fear or nostalgia.
My illness was flaring up again.
It was incurable.
""Roderick, we're running out of time! Help me set up! Mitch's gonna be here any minute, and I want everything perfect.""
Roderick didn't move.
He knew Mitchell was never happy to see me.
On the news broadcast, Mitchell smiled for the cameras, yet his eyes remained cold.
""I'm sure she's watching too. I'm looking forward to... seeing her again.""
 
###Chapter 2
The camera zoomed in, highlighting the scar bisecting his eyebrow.
It was my doing, with a knife.
I was having a bad day, and he was there. So, I attacked him.
The ugly scar on my neck was his doing. He crushed a glass and used a shard to attack me.
Again, there was no deep motive.
We had a simple understanding: hurt the other, get hurt in return. We liked seeing each other in pain.
The news anchor smiled suggestively. ""Planning a long stay, Mr. Harvey? Those roses... Are you meeting someone special?""
He paused, his voice low. ""My fiancée.""
In the shop, the girl was adjusting roses in a candelabra. She glanced up at the TV.
""Roderick,"" she said, ""I heard Mitch had some messy history with a girl here for ten years. You know anything about that?""
I kept my head down, polishing a knife, but felt Roderick's gaze flicker toward me.
""Mitch!"" Her shout cut through the tension.
She forgot her umbrella and dashed outside.
""Yas.""
Mitchell caught her in a one-armed hug, his umbrella shielding her from the rain.
She rose on her toes and pressed a quick, rain-damp kiss to his lips.
I thought I saw him lean back, just slightly.
Then his eyes found mine through the wet glass.
The girl tried to turn, but he cupped her chin and kissed her again, deeper this time.
I looked away and snipped the ribbon I was holding.
Roderick approached.
""Paulette,"" he said, voice low. ""It's his birthday. For one night, could you just not anger him?""
He hesitated, seeming to think of something. ""She's nineteen. Clean slate. Reminds him of you before.""
I nodded, my fingers feeling numb.
""She's pretty. Prettier than I was.""
The door opened. Mitchell stood there, folding his black umbrella.
""Discussing my fiancée?""
His tone was light, but his stare was cold as it rested on me.
 
###Chapter 3
Roderick watched me, holding his breath.
He was waiting for one of my classic outbursts.
Instead, I simply pushed the boxed cake toward them. ""Your dark chocolate cheesecake.""
Yasmine Murphy gazed at Mitchell with adoration. ""Try it, Mitch. Is this your favorite?""
He took a sip of coffee, rubbing the edge of the cup, before cutting a small piece with the silver dessert fork.
""Bitter. Unpleasantly so. Not for me.""
His tone was light, his eyes smiling as he teased Yasmine.
She looked confused and took a bite herself. ""It's delicious! You're lying to me again!""
She didn't see that his gaze remained fixed on me over her head.
Suddenly, the door chime jangled loudly.
""Hey, Mitch! Welcome back!""
A few men crowded in, their laughter cutting off abruptly when they saw me.
Their eyes followed me, wary and questioning, before turning to Roderick.
I carried over the pot of lemonade. The men flinched in unison, raising their hands defensively, as if I were holding acid.
Back when Mitchell and I were at each other's throats, his crew got caught in the crossfire a few times.
It was never anything serious, just minor incidents. I was surprised they still reacted this way.
Someone nudged Roderick. ""Roddy, what's she doing here?""
Roderick just shrugged, not explaining.
""Enjoy your lemonade,"" I said, turning to leave.
Yasmine caught my wrist. ""Wait! Could you take a picture for us?""
""No,"" I said, calmly removing her hand.
I'd only taken a few steps when a figure moved to block my path.
I looked up to see Mitchell's gloomy face. ""I know how this works,"" he said, his voice flat. ""Everything has a price. So name it. How much to get you to...""
He paused deliberately, waiting for me to react. When I didn't, he finished coldly. ""Take a picture for us.""
I looked him over and tried to step around him.
A sharp pressure on a nerve in my arm sent a jolt of pain through me, and my legs gave way. I fell to my knees. A black card was flung down, its edge catching my cheek and drawing a thin line of blood.
""That's more than enough to make you disappear.""
I pushed myself back to my feet, my fingers gingerly touching the cut, my eyes fixed on Mitchell.
Yasmine quickly stepped between us, her smile strained. ""Mitch, stop it, okay?
""Sorry, miss. He must have had too much to drink.""
But he didn't smell of alcohol. He was simply picking a fight, same as always.
It convinced me he'd been having such a good time abroad that he'd forgotten who he was dealing with.
I bent down, picked up the black card, and stood facing him again.
His friends let out a low laugh.
""Some things never change. She still jumps for money.""
He held out his phone with a confident smirk, pleased by my apparent cooperation.
I moved fast. I grabbed his jaw, scraped the edge of the card through a thick glob of chocolate frosting, and shoved it into his mouth.
I didn't stop until I smelled blood. Then I grabbed two glasses from the table and poured the liquor down his throat.
""Consider your mouth cleaned,"" I said.
I turned and slapped the man who had spoken. ""Learn when to keep quiet.""
The whole thing was over in seconds. No one else moved. The only sound was the rain hitting the windows.
Roderick, leaning against the far wall, drained his glass and sighed heavily. ""I told you not to provoke her.""
Yasmine finally snapped out of her shock, her posture defensive as she confronted me. ""We were out of line first. I get it. But this is just insane!""
She raised her hand to strike me.
""Ah!"" I caught her wrist mid-swing and slapped her, hard, across the face.
The sound was sharp in the quiet room.
Mitchell spat out a mix of blood and frosting, a cold smile on his lips. ""You want a fight with me? Fine. But you can't touch her.""
He pulled the sobbing Yasmine close, her cheek still swollen from the slap. ""How about I trash this place for you? Will that make you feel better?""
She nodded and covered her cheek, tears in her eyes.
His bodyguards in black swarmed in. Clubs swung down, shattering glass and smashing the overhead light.
Cold wind and rain blew through the broken windows, soaking my face.
Mitchell gripped my chin, forcing my head up.
""You didn't start this. But she needs to see it end. Send me the bill for the damages. All of it.""
His eyes scanned me like I was a piece of discarded furniture.
I shoved his hand away, a sudden coughing fit seizing me. I frantically searched through the wreckage.
A small white prescription bottle rolled into view. My eyes locked onto it.
He was faster. He bent down and plucked it, reading the label.
""Six of these at once? Are you trying to kill yourself?""
He tossed the bottle into a rainwater puddle, put his arm around Yasmine, and walked away.
I knelt by the puddle, retrieved the bottle, and swallowed two more pills.
This medication was for anxiety and pain.
I started with half a pill. Now, eight couldn't stop my pain.
The pills were nearly gone. And so was I.
 
###Chapter 4
Three years passed, and my mother died too.
My work was unstable. I'd taken many lives and become a target myself.
I'd spent all my savings on that bakery. Now, with it destroyed, I had nowhere left to go.
Maybe it was the pain seizing my limbs again, but I lacked the strength to move. I simply sat amidst the wreckage, letting the rain soak me.
Overnight, every major tabloid in New York led with ""Mitchell Harvey Returns to Wreak Havoc on His Ex.""
By sunrise, I was ready to leave.
Before going, I faced the shattered ruins and slowly bowed.
Mitchell appeared out of nowhere. He hauled me to my feet with one hand.
""It's just a bakery. Is it worth this?""
I slapped his hand away, steadied myself, and then struck him three sharp slaps across the face.
""My parents' memorial plaques were inside. They're gone now,"" I said, my voice flat. ""The bow was necessary.""
He worked his jaw, then smirked. ""Three slaps for your mother's memorial? Sounds like I got the better deal.""
I ignored him, staring at the devastation.
He stood behind me, deliberately twisting the knife.
""Paulette Sherman. I'm talking to you.""
I acted as if I hadn't heard and walked away.
He caught up in a few strides, blocking my path.
""Stop pretending you're fine! Look at yourself. You're ghostly pale. What are you trying to prove?""
""My old condition flared up. A little tired, that's all."" I looked up, offering a cold smile. ""Mitchell, did you really think you were important enough to affect me?""
But I knew the truth.
He'd come back specifically to make my life hell.
If I were still in good health, I wouldn't mind another round, maybe breaking a few of his bones in the process.
But now, just standing upright consumed all my energy.
In the hospital, the smell of disinfectant was nauseating.
Several doctors studied my scans, their expressions grim.
""How much of your last prescription is left?""
""It's gone.""
""Gone?!"" Steven Harriman's voice rose sharply. ""That was a three-month supply! It's only been a week!""
Steven had handled my case for years. His hesitation told me everything—my time was running out.
""Is... there anyone else in your family?"" he asked carefully.
""Have you forgotten?"" My tone was flat. ""My father's dead. My mother's gone. It's just me.""
He removed his glasses, rubbing the bridge of his nose. ""You were managing well for three years. What happened this past week...""
My phone screen lit up with a news alert—a prominent photo of Mitchell with Yasmine on his arm at some gala.
The person I thought I was over still hurt me the most.
Mitchell was the source of my deepest wounds, the one who knew how to hurt me most without leaving a mark.
""Your condition is extremely unstable. After stopping the medication, the first week, the first month, and the third month are all critical periods.
""Take this,"" he said, handing me a small bottle. His voice was heavy. ""Three pills when the pain is severe. No more than three.""
Before he finished, I'd twisted the cap off, shaken a handful into my palm, and dry-swallowed them.
The number didn't matter, as long as it dulled the bone-deep agony.
A week or three months made no difference to me.
After taking the pills, I crouched in the most inconspicuous corner of the hospital corridor, my back pressed against the cold wall.
I'd figured out that lowering my body temperature could ease the pain.
Cold sweat soaked through my thin clothes.
For ten minutes, I listened to the desperate prayers and weeping outside the operating room, where all hope hung on a single, fragile thread.
""Mommy, isn't that the lady who was in the bed next to us? Should we say goodbye?""
""Her illness... There's no cure. Let's not bother her. Such a tragic case. No family left, and such a severe sickness. She probably won't even have anyone to hold a funeral for her.""
The little girl looked up, confused. ""But surely someone in the world cares about her, right?""
I blinked hard, clearing my blurred vision, and focused on my phone screen.
A text came from Mitchell.
He'd been messaging since last night, persistently asking what compensation I wanted.
I thought about it. Maybe no one cared, but there was one person who could handle the funeral arrangements.
I dialed the number I knew by heart.
He answered instantly.
""Made up your mind?""
I took a sharp breath, swallowing the metallic taste in my mouth. ""If you insist on paying me back, Mitchell, you can be the one to bury me.""
 
###Chapter 5
Silence stretched for seconds on the other end, followed by Mitchell's mocking laugh.
""Paulette, someone as vicious and stubborn as you usually lives forever. But if you do somehow die before me, rest assured, I'll give you the most lavish funeral New York has ever seen. I'll have the whole city light memorial candles for you!""
Satisfied with his promise, I hung up.
Outside the hospital, I saw the mother and daughter again.
The little girl was pounding her chest, her voice full of childish conviction. ""Who says nobody cares about her just because she has no family? Well, I do!""
""Enough, let's go. The bus is. Oh, the bus!"" Her mother pulled her away, rushing for the departing bus.
I walked to the parking garage and got into my black sedan.
Seeing they'd missed the bus, I impulsively rolled down the window. ""Get in. I'll give you a ride.""
I dropped them off downtown. They thanked me profusely and got out.
Just as I was about to pull away, I heard an irritating voice.
""Well, look at that. Paulette did a good deed. I suppose even you need to score some points.""
Mitchell's usual crowd was exiting a nearby club. Yasmine clung to his arm, her gaze sharp and venomous.
I didn't want a scene. I started raising the window to leave.
But Yasmine hurried over and pressed her hand against the glass.
A fake smile played on her lips, but her eyes were cold. ""I just found out about your history with Mitch. I hope we didn't... upset you yesterday?""
I had no patience for her act and tried to close the window again.
She gripped the window frame tightly. ""I have something for you. I really mean no harm.""
""I'm not interested. Get lost."" My patience was gone.
Yasmine suddenly let go. As I started the car, she pulled a small urn from her bag.
""I heard your mother's memorial plaque was destroyed in the shop. I gathered some ashes from the ruins this morning so you'd have something to remember her by.""
Her voice was sweet, but her actions were pure malice.
She reached through the window and poured the contents of the urn onto my passenger seat.
""Oh! You... you didn't catch it!"" she cried, stepping back with a perfect mask of innocence and sly satisfaction. ""You're not mad at me, are you?""
I watched her performance, and a sudden anger burned through the sickness inside me.
Good. She asked for this.
The group by the club entrance, clueless, was still praising Yasmine. ""Yas is so thoughtful, talking to that mess and even giving her a gift.""
Yasmine confidently turned and walked towards a shiny new Porsche parked ahead, triumphantly shaking her key fob.
I rolled down my window and called out, ""Yasmine! I have a gift for you, too!""
Yasmine turned, crossing her arms smugly. ""What are you giving me, Paulette?""
I tightened my seatbelt, my eyes locking on her. ""A one-way trip.""
Before the words faded, I slammed the accelerator.
""Bang!""
The front of my car smashed into the Porsche's rear.
Yasmine's car lurched forward uncontrollably.
I reversed, then slammed the gas again, hitting it a second time!
In the rearview mirror, I saw the drunken group jolt into sobriety.
""She's insane! She's actually insane!""
""I told you she was a lunatic! But you had to provoke her!""
""Relax, she won't really do anything. She's just blowing off steam, and then...""
He didn't finish.
True, I was blowing off steam.
But I wasn't done yet.
Yasmine stumbled out of the smoking car, her face pale, already slipping back into her fragile victim role.
""Mitch, wh... what did I do wrong?""
Mitchell had a cut on his forehead from flying glass, bleeding slightly. He moved urgently to shield Yasmine.
He understood my intent in a single glance.
""Paulette! Don't you dare!""
Ridiculous. There was nothing I dared not do.
I kept my eyes on Yasmine, my expression icy, and floored the accelerator.
The engine roared as the car shot straight toward her.
 
###Chapter 6
I unbuckled my seatbelt, got out, and coldly observed Yasmine sprawled on the pavement a few yards away.
Her legs and arms were scraped and bleeding.
""You're lucky I let off the gas. Otherwise, you'd have more than scratches,"" I stated calmly.
She looked up, her eyes filled with naked hatred. ""Mitchell will make you pay for this!""
I picked up my handbag from the passenger seat, now soiled with the ashes, and used its corner to lift her chin. ""There. The real you is much more tolerable.""
I took the bag back, dusting it off with disgust. The group rushed over.
Mitchell hurried to help Yasmine up.
I took out my phone, called an ambulance, then tossed the handbag toward Yasmine.
""This bag's resale value is about 20,000 dollars. More than enough for her medical bills and the car repairs.""
""Paulette!"" Mitchell's voice was thick with suppressed rage.
I ignored him and walked away.
The taste of blood filled my mouth. I pressed my lips together and quickened my pace.
I nearly ran from the scene. Rounding a corner, sure I was out of sight, I braced myself against a wall and coughed, splattering dark blood onto the grimy brick.
A ringing filled my ears, my vision blurring. I forced myself onward, moving on instinct until I reached my temporary apartment.
If my body had held up, I might have turned back to cause Mitchell more trouble. I desperately wanted to see him furious and helpless against me.
I collapsed near the living room coffee table and poured a glass of water.
But after one sip, I coughed it all back up—water and blood.
The half-glass of water instantly turned crimson.
I lay on the floor, gasping for air. It felt like an invisible hand was twisting my insides. The pain was maddening, but I lacked even the strength to clench my teeth.
I had no idea how much time had passed before the buzzing of my phone and violent pounding on my door dragged me back to consciousness.
For a moment, I'd thought I wouldn't make it through the night.
The name flashing on the screen was Mitchell.
""Paulette! Open the door! I know you're in there!""
His voice came through, threatening and absolute, while the door thumped under his force.
""If you don't open it, I'll break it down!""
I knew he meant it. But I would never let him see me like this—broken and dying.
Summoning the last of my strength, I crawled into the bedroom, moved the wardrobe, and squeezed into the narrow hiding space behind it. The sound of the door being forced open echoed from outside, followed by hurried footsteps.
His texts flooded my screen, one after another.
""Hiding? You think that works?""
""Get out of here! We need to talk!""
""If anything happens to Yasmine, I'll make you pay with your life!""
I stared at my phone. A sudden drop of nosebleed hit the screen, forming a dark red stain. My consciousness faded.",3,1764985775.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

(17f),"My parents have always been so extremely vocal about their money issues that it’s starting to build up resentment, we aren’t poor or like lower middle class or anything we live In a nice house with three cars in a nice area and since I can remember my parents are ALWAYS complaining about money. I can’t get a job because of the shitty job market here (still actively applying regardless) and my mom refuses to give me money for any of my necessities (including school lunch). Both of my parents work and we make well enough money I just don’t understand why they always complain abt not having money everytime I ask for something. Yesterday my dad was dropping me off at school and they had a deal at my local coffee place for 2$ and I asked if we can go (it was on the way to school btw) and he got mad at me and started saying stuff like “ I’m doing you a huge favour by dropping you off and I have places to be” and mind you he leaves the house at 2pm every single day (he has his own buisness). And another thing to add on is that even the days my dad is home, I’m the one doing ALL the house work ontop of school and managing two sports teams every other day. I cook , make handmaid rotis, make everyone’s lunch, iron clothes, clean everything and what not and I don’t want to sound like I’m boasting about what I do but I feel like if I’m doing so much I feel like he should be able to buy me a 2$ iced coffee every 3 months. Like I don’t mean to sound ungrateful or anything but but they’re always shoving the fact that we don’t have enough money down my throat all the damn time. My parents have money to give to their siblings and relatives back home but I can’t get a fricking 2$ coffee. I don’t even go out with my friends or anytning like that unlike my younger sister I haven’t gone out with them since July and they say stuff like how I’m always out with my friends and spending money. It’s so annoying. The other day we were at the mall cuz I had to exchange something cuz it was tight for me and my sister was like “oh I’ll just take it” and I was like no cuz then I won’t have enough money to get myself something else if I do end up returning it. And that’s exactly what happened, she got herself a few shirts and two pants and like some jewlery while all I got was a pair of jeans that were on sale for $15. And this isn’t the first time it’s happened this ALWAYS happens. And when I finally saw something I liked I asked my mom if I can get it and she was like “no we already spent too much money” like",0,1764985758.0,Advice,0,0.5,False

Hey everyone. I’m 33 and born and raised in Michigan. I’ve never really posted here before, but I’m trying to branch out and meet new people to chat with, vibe with, and hopefully build some simple, genuine connections.

A little about me:
I’m big into anything outdoors when the weather’s good like  hiking, kayaking, camping, all that good stuff. Once winter hits though, I fully switch into homebody mode. Give me reading, good coffee, TV show binges, and warm cuddles with the right person and I’m set.

I’m a friendly, laid back guy who can get pretty goofy once I’m comfortable. I love sarcasm and I’m always down for good conversation, whether it’s light, funny, or deeper “talk for hours” type stuff.

If you’re looking for someone to chat with, get to know, share random thoughts with, or just build a chill friendship, feel free to message me.

Looking forward to meeting some new people.",1,1764985678.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

When the weather was nice I was reading in rittenhouse or Washington square and loved the random conversations that it allowed. What are some coffee shops, chill bars, or other third spaces in center city, Fairmount, or NoLibs that I should check out?

Some of the coffee shops I’ve tried so far:
Alchemy Rittenhouse-  good coffee, not enough seating
Alchemy Market St- loved the vibe and the abundant seating. Had a great spicy chai
Mr Rabbit- delicious but very limited seating so sat with a stranger for a few minutes 
Madis- great coffee, although pricey. Very busy. Wish it had some couches

I used to do 2 styles for my daily, either a modified turbo (1:2-2.5, 17-22s shot, medium roast) on automatic machine, or soup on the oxo rapid brewer.

Recently switched to full manual lever, and moving away from oxo rapid brewer primarily because of the plastic content (otherwise, great brewer, if not my favorite..). I could get similar result on the manual lever too.

What I'm starting to wonder now is, what's the actual difference between the ultra low contact method and soup, apart from the paper filter sandwich? For reference, I'm doing 1:3 (20-22g dose, 60g out) for both, I aim for as close to 0 bar pressure as possible for both, and use similar brew temperatures for both. So, does anybody know the differences?",0,1764985418.0,LanceHedrick,3,0.5,False

Pero lumaki kami sa average-income family na laging sinasabi ng parents ko na:
“Anak, huwag magtipid pagdating sa pagkain. You work to survive and enjoy life. At least once in a while, treat yourself.”

So ayun… tuwing Saturday, kahit once a week lang, I let myself buy a nice coffee from a café. Small reward for surviving the week. ☕️

Pag-uwi, back to reality:
House chores. Laundry. Linis. Tanggal kalat.
Kasi syempre, solo living , walang ibang gagalaw sa bahay kundi ikaw.
Makalat ako every weekday (aminin natin hahaha) pero I always make sure na may general cleaning ako tuwing weekend para hindi maipon ang gulo ng adulting.

Later, badminton naman,kasi kailangan din gumalaw at maging healthy. Solo living means taking care of yourself physically, mentally, at financially.

Adulting is hard pero nakakaya naman… one café coffee, one errand, one clean room at a time. 
Happy weekend everyone! Be safe and let yourself enjoy! Kung may struggle ka nafeel today or for the past day! I know kaya mo yan.. you always will! 😊😊 Aja",23,1764985390.0,SoloLivingPH,8,1.0,False
1pfd0l2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NightmareNarratives-/comments/1pfd0l2/a_woman_hired_me_to_clean_her_late_brothers/,"A woman hired me to clean her late brother’s apartment, but every night after I leave, things I boxed up are unboxed again, placed exactly where they were. She says her brother was obsessive about “resetting the world” before bed. Now the apartment resets itself...","I was hired to clean out an apartment belonging to a man named Luke Barrett, who died six months ago. His sister, Dana, met me outside the building with a ring of keys and the expression of someone who’d had too many sleepless nights.

“He lived alone,” she told me. “He didn’t have friends. He didn’t… let people in. Just be prepared for things to be a little strange.”

Strange was an understatement.

The moment I unlocked the door, I felt like I’d walked into a museum exhibit. Everything inside was arranged with unsettling precision. Shoes lined up with ruler accuracy. Books organized not alphabetically, but by height and shade. Pillows centered to the millimeter. The TV remote sat perfectly parallel to the table’s edge.

Obsessive-compulsive is one thing.
This felt like ritual.

Dana lingered in the doorway, wringing her hands.

“He called it ‘resetting the world,’” she said. “Every night before he went to bed, he put everything back exactly where it belonged. Exactly. And if anything was off… he couldn’t sleep. Sometimes he’d stay up until morning fixing things.”

“What happened after he died?” I asked.

Her eyes flicked to the apartment windows.

“It didn’t stop.”

She handed me the key and left quickly, like she couldn’t stand being too close to the place. I shrugged it off — grief does weird things to people — and got to work.

The job itself was simple:
Pack everything into labeled boxes so Dana could donate or store it.
Nothing dramatic.

On day one, I boxed up the bookshelf. Every novel, every journal, every old manual. I stacked the labeled boxes in the hallway, locked up, and went home.

The next morning, I opened the apartment door and felt my stomach drop.

Every book was back on the shelves.
Perfectly aligned.
Exactly how they’d been before.

The boxes were still in the hallway, taped shut.

I checked the locks, checked for signs of forced entry, checked for any explanation that didn’t make me feel insane. Nothing.

Dana called right on time, voice soft and exhausted.

“Did the apartment undo your work?”

The fact she asked so casually made something tighten inside me.

“You’ve… seen this happen before?” I asked.

“At first I thought someone was breaking in,” she said. “Then I stayed overnight. And it still reset itself.”

“You saw it happen?”

“No.”
A pause.
“That’s the worst part. I never actually saw it. I’d blink or turn my head and something would be back where it wasn’t a second earlier.”

She lowered her voice.

“Luke always said the world should be correct. If something was out of place, it wasn’t safe to sleep.”

I didn’t believe her. I mean, I believed she believed it… but I didn’t buy the supernatural part. People who lose someone sometimes cling to patterns, stories, symbolism. Grief logic.

Still, the books were back on the shelves, somehow.

So I tried again.


---

The next night, I stayed late.
Long after sunset, long after the hallway lights clicked to their dim nighttime mode.

I boxed up the entire kitchen: plates, cups, utensils, spices, everything. I stacked the boxes neatly in the middle of the room, stood back, and waited.

Nothing happened.

Ten minutes passed.
Twenty.
Thirty.

I checked my phone. Midnight.

Still nothing.

I was packing up my things, muttering under my breath about being tired and gullible, when something cold slid down my spine.

A sound.

Not a loud one.
Not even unnatural.

Just… the faint clink of ceramic.

Behind me.

I turned.

The plates were on the counter again.
Stacked.
Perfect.
Centered.

My boxes hadn’t moved.
The tape wasn’t peeled.
Nothing had opened them.

It was as if the plates had never been inside.

My pulse thundered in my ears.

I stepped closer to the counter, touched the top plate.

Warm.

Like it had just been washed and dried.

The apartment light flickered once — a quick, almost irritated blink.

And the room shifted.

Not physically.
Not visibly.

Just… something in the air.

Like the walls inhaled.

Then, from the bedroom, a soft thud.
Followed by another.
A steady rhythm.

I walked toward the sound, drawn by something I still can’t explain.

Inside the bedroom, every item I’d boxed earlier in the week — every book, every picture frame, every rolled-up shirt — sat out exactly where they’d originally been.

The bed, neatly made.

The alarm clock, blinking 12:00 even though I hadn’t touched it.

And on the pillow—

A slip of paper.

Handwritten.

Not old.
Not new.
Just… placed.

I picked it up.

The handwriting was perfectly neat.

Almost too neat.

> **Reset incomplete. Do not interfere.

— L.B.**



My heartbeat staggered.

L.B.

Luke Barrett.

The dead man.

I backed out of the room slowly, my breath trembling.

The apartment didn’t feel empty anymore.
Not in a ghostly way.

In a watched way.

I grabbed my bag, shoved the bedroom door closed, and reached for the front doorknob.

It turned before I touched it.

Slowly.
Deliberately.

The door swung open on its own.

Every light in the apartment flickered.

And all around me — in the kitchen, the living room, the bedroom — every object shifted half an inch into perfect alignment.

A quiet, synchronized click.

Like the world settling into the shape someone else wanted.

I stepped into the hallway, heart in my throat.

But as the door closed behind me, I saw it:

A second note sliding slowly under the bedroom door.

As if pushed by an unseen hand.

I bent down and picked it up.

Another handwritten message.

Shorter.

Sharper.

More urgent.

> You can’t leave until it’s reset correctly.



The hallway went dark.

And the apartment door unlocked behind me.

Click.

I backed away from the apartment door, the note still trembling in my hand.

You can’t leave until it’s reset correctly.

Every instinct screamed to run — take the stairwell, the elevator, a window, anything. But the second I took a step toward the hall, the overhead lights fizzled and died, plunging the corridor into a suffocating darkness.

Behind me, the apartment door creaked open again.

Not by wind.
Not by settling.
By invitation.

A slow, polite gesture — like someone pulling out a chair.

I didn’t want to go back inside. God, I didn’t. But something whispered at the back of my mind, a sensation I couldn’t shake:

If I ran, it would follow.

So I stepped inside.

The moment my foot crossed the threshold, the hallway light blinked faintly back to life — just enough to show me one thing:

The door closed behind me.

And locked.


---

The apartment looked different.

Same objects.
Same arrangement.

But the air felt wired, like I’d stepped into a machine that had just powered on.

I walked carefully into the living room. Everything I’d boxed earlier in the week — clothes, books, dishes — was back in its original position. But now the arrangement wasn’t just neat. It was too exact. Too perfectly parallel. It looked less like someone cleaned and more like the world itself snapped into place.

I whispered, “Luke, I don’t know what you want from me.”

The lights buzzed.

The ceiling fan spun a quarter turn by itself.

And a framed photo on the wall rotated a fraction of an inch — aligning itself perfectly with the top edge of the picture next to it.

Resetting the world.

That’s what his sister said he called it.

Well, the world wasn’t mine anymore.
It was his.

I walked to one of the boxes I’d sealed earlier — the one with the kitchen utensils. Still taped. Still untouched. I stared at it for a long moment before peeling the tape open.

Inside… nothing.

Completely empty.

But the tape wasn’t torn. The cardboard wasn’t damaged. The box hadn’t been opened since I sealed it.

I turned slowly, dread climbing my ribs like cold vines.

Every fork, every cup, every spatula was not only back in the drawers — they were arranged in unnervingly exact patterns. Perfect gridding. Perfect spacing.

Like something was showing me it could do this all day.

I reached for the slip of paper I’d found earlier and flipped it over, hoping for answers.

Blank.

But then — right as I watched — handwriting bled across the page.

Not written.
Not appearing stroke by stroke.

Just… there.

> You’re interfering again.



My heart kicked hard against my ribs.

Then a second line appeared below it.

> Reset the living room. Or I will.



I stared around the living room. Nothing looked wrong. Nothing looked out of place.

But then I noticed it:

One curtain on the far window was half an inch lower than the other.

That was it.

That tiny difference.

The apartment didn’t want it.

When I lifted my hand to fix it, the room brightened slightly — as if the place itself exhaled.

As if I’d pleased it.

A chill rolled up my spine.

This wasn’t cleaning anymore.

This was obedience.


---

I fixed the curtain.

The air lightened.

Then — immediately — another object called out like a toothache in the corner of my vision.

A crooked lamp.

Straightened it.

Then another.

A coaster slightly off-center.

Then another.

A picture frame angled one degree wrong.

Every time I fixed something, the apartment brightened — lights flickering with approval, shadows shrinking away. It was like feeding a hungry animal, one perfect gesture at a time.

But after a while… I realized something.

There was no end.

No matter how much I straightened or aligned, there was always something left. Something else to adjust. Something else not quite “correct.”

And every time I fixed one thing, the apartment would point out another.

I whispered into the empty room, “This isn’t cleaning. This is control.”

That’s when the bedroom door slammed shut behind me so hard the walls shook.

The slip of paper in my hand inked a new sentence:

> He tried defying the rules too.



A second line followed:

> You’re already further in than he ever was.



My mouth went dry.

“What happened to him?” I whispered.

The answer appeared slowly — as if the writer enjoyed taking their time.

> He failed to reset in time.



A pause.

Then the ink curled into one final line:

> And the world reset him instead.



The bedroom door clicked.

Unlocked itself.

Inviting me in.

I stepped forward, pulse hammering at my throat.

Inside the bedroom, the bed was made perfectly. Air still. Shadows still. Everything in flawless order.

Except for one thing.

A new box.

Not one I brought.
Not one Dana provided.

Plain cardboard.
Unmarked.

Sitting in the center of the bed.

Inside was a single object.

A watch.

Old-fashioned.
Silver.
Still ticking.

But the second hand wasn’t moving forward.

It was moving backward.
Fast.
Jerky.
Panicked.

Below the watch was another note.

I picked it up with shaking fingers.

> Reset time.



Then, smaller beneath it:

> Or you’re next.



Behind me, every light in the apartment flickered once—
Twice—
Three times.

Resetting.

And when the final blink ended…

The apartment door unlocked.

And footsteps began walking toward the bedroom.

They weren’t mine.

And they weren’t human.

The footsteps in the hallway were slow, steady, and unmistakably deliberate—like someone walking with absolute confidence toward a destination they’d been to a thousand times.

Except no one alive should know their way around this apartment like that.

I backed up until I hit the dresser, gripping the ticking backward watch so tightly I could feel the metal bite into my palm. The second hand kept jerking counterclockwise, faster and faster, like time inside it was panicking.

The footsteps got closer.

Then they stopped right outside the bedroom door.

I didn’t breathe.

The doorknob twisted.

Not violently.
Not with force.

With precision.

A smooth, quiet turn… the exact kind of movement someone obsessed with perfect order would make.

The door swung open.

But the hallway was empty.

No figure.
No shadow.
No person standing there.

And yet—

The floorboards outside the room slowly indented, as if weight was shifting onto them. Each step pressed down on wood that groaned under a presence I couldn’t see.

A shape was there.
Moving toward me.
Invisible, but pressing itself into reality one footprint at a time.

I stepped backward toward the bed, trying to steady my breathing.

The paper in my hand—the one that said Reset time—fluttered as if caught in a small breeze. But the room was still.

The footprints stopped two feet from me.

Then something else changed.

The entire apartment seemed to inhale.

Lights dimmed, not flickering but draining, like the room was pulling its power inward. The ceiling fan slowed, reversed direction, then sped up clockwise—mirroring the watch in my hand.

Time wasn’t flowing normally here.

It wasn’t flowing at all.

The watch jerked violently.

Then stopped.

Not at midnight.
Not at noon.

At 2:11 AM.

A random, meaningless time.

Or maybe not meaningless at all.

A new line bled onto the paper.

> This is when he died.



I stared at it, throat tightening.

Luke Barrett died at 2:11 AM?
From what?
Why did the apartment care?

Before I could process it, more words surfaced:

> He didn’t reset the world in time.
You have three minutes.



The lights stuttered.

The room temperature dropped five degrees instantly.

I whispered, “Three minutes to what?”

The answer formed with painful slowness, ink trembling:

> To fix what he couldn’t.



No details.
No instructions.

Just a countdown.

I checked the watch.

It now read 2:12.

One minute lost already.

The invisible footsteps moved again—this time around me, circling the bed like something inspecting the space, judging my lack of action. Its presence pressed the air against my skin, cold and sharp.

I stumbled into the living room, searching for something “wrong,” something out of place.

A pillow crooked.

I fixed it.

The apartment brightened slightly.

A blanket folded too loosely.

I refolded it.

Another faint glow.

Then I noticed it:

A book on the coffee table wasn’t aligned with the grain of the wood.

I adjusted it.

The ceiling light buzzed in approval.

The watch jumped to 2:13.

Two minutes left.

I sprinted to the kitchen, scanning every surface. Plates: aligned. Utensils: perfect. Towels: centered.

Then—
The salt shaker was an inch too far left.

I slid it into place.

A soft clicking sound ran through the walls like bones settling.

I checked the watch.

2:14.

One minute.

Only one.

I turned toward the bedroom again—

And froze.

Everything was wrong.

The bed skewed.
Sheets rumpled.
Dresser slightly angled.
Lamp out of place.

The apartment wasn’t testing me anymore.

It was sabotaging me.

I lunged for the bed, straightened the sheets with shaking hands. The watch ticked louder—backward, frantic.

Thirty seconds left.

I aligned the dresser.
Realigned the lamp.
Fixed the curtain rods.
Centered the pillow.

The apartment hummed with tension.
The air vibrated.

Twenty seconds.

I adjusted the rug.
The bedside table.
The drawer handle.

Ten seconds.

Then I saw it.

The photograph of Luke on the wall—
It wasn’t straight.

Possible, easy fix.

But as I reached up to straighten it, something occurred to me:

Every object in this apartment had been returned to its exact original position since the day I arrived.

Except this one.

This picture had been vertical last week.

Now it was horizontal.

It didn’t belong that way.

I rotated it upright.

The apartment gave a deep, resonant exhale—like releasing months of tension in a single breath.

The watch hit 2:15 AM.

Then—

It began ticking forward again.

Slow.
Normal.

The air warmed.

The lights steadied.

The invisible footsteps stopped.

Silence filled the room.

I staggered back, panting, dizzy, trying to understand what I’d just done.

Then the note in my hand changed again.

Words crawled across it like veins spreading:

> Reset complete.



Then:

> Follow me.



Before I could move, the apartment door unlocked by itself.

And the lights began turning on, one by one, leading not out of the apartment—
But deeper inside.

The glow stopped at a small crawl space door I hadn’t noticed before.

A door so perfectly hidden, its seam lined up with the wall molding.

Painted the same color.

Literally invisible unless you were looking for deviations.

A tiny metal latch clicked.

The door opened.

Inside was darkness.

And a staircase leading down.

At the top step sat another slip of paper.

I picked it up.

It said only one thing:

> This is where he finished resetting the world.

The crawl space door yawned open like a throat, stale air drifting up from the darkness below. The smell wasn’t rot—not exactly. More like dust mixed with something metallic, faint but unmistakable. Old air. Trapped air. Air that hadn’t been disturbed since the last person descended these steps.

The last person being Luke Barrett.

I stared down into the pitch-black stairwell, the narrow wooden steps disappearing into a void that felt too deep for the structure of the building. No architectural blueprint in the world would’ve allowed a staircase this long in a third-floor apartment.

The slip of paper in my hand crinkled.

A new line appeared, written slowly, deliberately, as if the apartment wanted me to watch the ink form:

> Don’t take your eyes off the steps.



A second line followed immediately:

> He stopped looking.



The lights in the apartment flickered once—
a warning.
A countdown.

I stepped onto the first stair.

It groaned like something waking up.


---

As I descended, the air grew colder. Not gradually—in jerking drops, like walking through invisible pockets of freezer air.

Ten steps down.
Twenty.
Thirty.

No landing.
No turn.
No end in sight.

Just an impossibly long wooden throat stretching deeper and deeper beneath a building that should not have space for any of this.

I kept my eyes on the steps, staring so hard my vision blurred.

At step forty, something changed.

A faint scraping sound echoed from below.

Soft.
Steady.
Metal against concrete.

Like someone dragging something in slow circles.

I gripped the wall with one hand and forced myself onward.

Step forty-five.
Step fifty.

The scraping grew louder.
Clearer.

Rhythmic.

Deliberate.

At step fifty-six, the staircase finally opened into a vast room.

Not a basement—
A chamber.

Large enough to swallow the entire building above it.

My breath caught.

Because every wall, from floor to ceiling, was covered in shelves.

Perfect, symmetrical shelves.

Filled with objects.

Every object labeled.

Every label handwritten in the same neat lettering as the notes.

Thousands of items lined the walls:

shirts folded identically

mugs spaced precisely one inch apart

watches ticking in perfect unison

books sorted by height and spine-color

pillows stacked like museum displays

photos framed at identical angles


All impossibly clean.
All arranged with the same obsessive, suffocating exactness.

This was no basement.

This was a replica of order.

A cathedral of “reset.”

And in the center of the room…

A figure knelt on the concrete floor.

Back turned to me.
Clothes gray with dust.
Hair unkempt, hanging in clumps.

A man-shaped silhouette.

Frozen.

Motionless.

Except—

His right hand dragged something across the floor.

A steel tool.

A straightedge.

He was drawing lines.

Perfect, geometric lines.

Resetting the world.

“Luke?” I whispered, my voice barely more than a breath.

The scraping stopped.

Every watch on every shelf stopped ticking.

All the air in the chamber pressed inward toward me, heavy and electric.

Then the man’s head turned.

Not fully—
just enough for me to see the corner of his face.

His jaw was slack.
His eyes were open wide—far too wide.
His pupils blown dark and unnatural.
Like no light had touched them in years.

He looked at me as though I were an object out of place.

Something to correct.

Slowly—too slowly—his shoulders twisted, joints stiff like rusted hinges. He rose to his feet with a jerking motion.

In his left hand, he held a slip of paper.

He let it fall to the ground without looking.

I stepped closer, shaking, and picked it up.

The handwriting was identical. Too identical. No human hand could write like this for years without variation.

> You finished what he couldn’t.



A second line:

> Now there must be a new resetter.



My pulse hammered painfully.

I stepped back. “No. No, I’m not doing this. I’m not staying here. I’m not—”

Every shelf in the room shifted at once.

Not loudly…
but with a soft, synchronized scrape.

Perfect alignment adjusting.

Reacting.

Choosing.

Then I saw it:
A single empty space on the shelf nearest me.

Perfectly rectangular.
Perfectly shaped.
Exactly sized for—

A watch.

The backward-ticking watch I still held in my hand.

The one the apartment had given me.

The one that now ticked forward, steady, patient, like it already knew its fate.

Luke took one step toward me—
His foot landing perfectly aligned with the tile lines.

I stumbled backward toward the stairs.

But the stairway entrance—

Wasn’t there anymore.

The wall had smoothed over, becoming seamless.

The room had reset without me.

I slammed my hand against the wall, searching for a crack, a handle, anything—

Nothing.

Every shelf creaked softly, rearranging one millimeter at a time, turning toward me.

The paper in my hand inked something new.

Just two words:

> Your turn.



Something shifted behind me.

The shelves closest to the center began bending, not physically but perceptually—like the room itself was steering me toward the empty slot.

Luke raised his straightedge tool.

Not to strike.

To align.

He lifted his other hand and pointed at the watch I held.

The meaning hit me like ice water:

He wasn’t trying to hurt me.

He was trying to place me.

I wasn’t a person in this room.

I was an object out of place.

I acted before I thought.

I hurled the watch across the chamber.

It clanged against a far shelf—

And suddenly, every tick in the room resumed.

A roaring, unstoppable cascade of clocks restarting.

Time returning.

The chamber shuddered.

The shelves snapped violently toward alignment.

And the wall behind me opened—

The staircase reappearing as if yanked back into existence.

I bolted up the stairs, two steps at a time, breath tearing through my lungs. Behind me, the room let out a thunderous, mechanical groan—like gears grinding through the earth.

I didn’t look back.

I reached the apartment—

Burst through the crawl space door—

And slammed it shut just as something heavy thudded against the wood from the other side.

The apartment lights flickered wildly.

Then went dead.

Silence.

When I finally opened my eyes, a slip of paper lay at my feet.

Unlike the others, this one was messy.

Handwriting trembling.

Desperate.

> You broke the pattern.



Another line:

> The world above isn’t reset anymore.



And then—

A third line.

Written in a shaky hand that most definitely wasn’t Luke’s:

> Things will start to move on their own now.
Not back into place—
But out of it.



The apartment door unlocked.

A breeze moved through the room.

Objects shifted half an inch.

Not toward perfection.

Toward chaos.

One final line appeared on the note in my hand.

Not neat.

Not cold.

Not calculated.

Terrified.

> You didn’t escape.
You unbalanced everything.
And now it’s coming up.



The crawl space door behind me rattled.

Once.

Twice.

Then slowly—

Hey everyone, I just picked up a [Moccamaster KGBV](https://www.reddit.com/r/smartbuysforlife/s/sFHldOs8At) and I am loving how clean and smooth the coffee tastes. I want to get a good grinder to match it.  

I have heard a lot about the **Baratza Encore** and it seems like a solid choice for beginners and enthusiasts. I am looking for something that:  
- works well for medium-coarse grind for drip/filter brew  
- has a consistent grind size, not uneven  
- is well-built and lasts a while  
- is a good balance between price and performance  

Has anyone used a Baratza Encore with a Moccamaster or have another grinder they recommend? Would love to hear what works best.

You made a point to tell me every day how grateful you were. I poured myself into you and I wasn’t even whole. It’s hard for me to accept that. Someone is smart as you can’t see this. No I don’t want you to feel guilt. No, I don’t want you to feel shame. I want you to feel anything like that that would hinder your progress, but your compartmentalizing, and that is what’s gonna keep you from growing. You can be mad all you want you can hate my god it doesn’t matter you’ve already ripped my heart out. It hurts. If you can’t see in your mind, the memories of us, the real ones not the every eight months that you found some reason or another that I was betraying you, I mean, let’s face it like you flipped a switch and we’re ready to kick me to the curb when I tried to donate Art to your stepmother‘s cancer fundraiser. WTF. I bet you could fit every single person that could say that truthfully in a Prius, lol.(do you like that? I stole it from a really funny guy.) 

You seem to be holding onto these ratchet, hard things that exonerate you and validate this whole entire mess and you’re doing yourself in injustice. Because you truly were loved from the deepest part of me. I was sick AF and I still poured as much as I could into filling your cup. Bringing you coffee, learning what you like to eat and learning how to make it, flying a Spinx up here from Georgia, hang with you in a quiet moments while you played your video games and laughed and giggled with you. I was barely able to be present. It took everything in me to be there in those moments and not be dissociated. But I held on for you part of me wishes a meteor would fall out of the freaking sky and knock some sense into you and then the other part of me really doesn’t want that because it’s gonna hurt like hell when you realize How do you play? I love you how easy it was for you to just let me go not even let me go, push me it’s unnecessary. This was a place for me to throw my feelings out there, especially since you wouldn’t allow me to process them with you. Didn’t you notice it kept getting worse and worse and worse. Not only was I sick AF and out of my ever loving mind, but you refused to even acknowledge my words or hear me. You counted them . You built a spreadsheet FFS.  The best part is you would never have seen me throwing a fit, pretending to be the monster you needed me to be, and yes, you did you needed that. After what I saw in the parking lot that night, that deep self loathing and you hurting yourself like that broke me it broke my heart . And I don’t know why you don’t understand why I had to push you away that hard. Do you know what it did to me to stand outside of her house and listen to you?! You spent the night before that in my bed, comforting me you knew I was falling apart and you couldn’t even wait in the moment that you realized how much pain you caused you dissociated yourself, and built this fucked up wall around you full of animosity and anger because it’s easier for you to feel that than it is for you to hurt over what you did and how you made me feel . And don’t think for one second that you can point the finger at me and talk about what I did. I’ve been on here, apologizing and bearing my soul for the whole world to see, I accepted all kinds of accountability of apologize 1001 times. The fact remains anger is easier for you to feel than regret. You have to shape your regret into some sort of weapon. What a ridiculous way to end something so fucking beautiful . You are out of your mind, convincing yourself that that wasn’t real. The truth of the matter is we were both assholes how come I can accept that and you can’t? You think the only thing you did wrong was move on too fast? I mean, truly are you splitting? Do you not remember how loved you were? And if you hadn’t have violated my rights , my privacy And had I believed that you were just looking out for me or wanted to make sure I was OK. I never would’ve tried so hard, or put nearly as much effort into convincing you that I was a horrible disgusting human being. So take whatever the hell it is you need from it. That’ll help you sleep better at night knowing you’re already working on the next thing you’re going to tear down. Every time. You looked up from what you were doing, and saw the way that I looked at you, that was real that was the truth of it.
The honest to God‘s truth is, I would’ve taken a bullet for you and if you can’t see that, if you don’t know that, you are compartmentalizing to the max. I was more in love with you the day that you walked out any other day that we were together and I know you don’t want to believe it, but I hung every word. I look forward to every night. And all I’ve wanted at least for the last three months is to hear you say that you remember the reality of what it felt like to be the number one fucking thing and somebody’s universe . 
You keep pointing the finger about how screwed up I am I mean for crying out loud you knew you broke me and you still verbally attacked me, you have no idea how close I came to eat in a bullet a couple times over this bullshit and you wanted to use that as a weapon . Stop breaking me. Look at what we had for what it was. Don’t do us both the injustice of being ignorantly blind to what it felt like to peel loved like you were worth your weight in gold I am so sorry that I was sick. I just wish you knew a real love was Cause you know that’s what I felt for you. It was beautiful, and it should be honored as such, my heart was hold, and if I’m standing here holding the pieces of it and clenched fists, it’s because it hurts and if you find any joy in that you are not human",1,1764985258.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,2,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

i've also recommended it to my friend who hates coffee so she can only ingest it by drinking super sugary starbucks and she didn't want the extra calories and she was like wait wtf no who does that.

""We call upon all patriots to join us on Dec 16th, 2025, the 252nd anniversary of the Boston Tea Party, to retrace the footsteps of this historic protest and declare once more - America has No Kings!

We will gather at 7:15 pm at the Irish Famine Memorial Plaza, across from the Old South Meeting House. We will march to Waterfront Plaza, by the Boston Tea Party Ships & Museum. And we will dump ice into Boston Harbor, to declare loud and clear: No Kings! No Tariffs! No ICE!

There will be clean ice provided for dumping. **Please do not bring your own ice.**

For over 250 years, Bostonians have refused to bow down to tyranny. When King George III forced soldiers into Boston’s streets, levied unjust taxes on imported tea, and refused to hear the people’s voices, the colonial patriots took a stand. On December 16, 1773, hundreds of colonists hurled tea into Boston Harbor in protest of King George’s tyranny, in what some call the single most important event leading up to the American Revolution.

Today, a President who behaves like a king occupies the White House. He has sent ICE to harass our city and kidnap our friends, families, and neighbors. He has levied unjust tariffs, and made our tea, our coffee, and our lives more expensive. Let us rise once more to take down tyranny!

*A core principle behind all Indivisible events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.""*",4,1764985156.0,malden,0,1.0,False
1pfcxvz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pfcxvz,"26M, Suggestions?","Thanks to those helped me out with feedback last time instead of just ""Needs 5 more Rolex signs"" a lot of it was really helpful.



Still looking for some more feedback on the place to take it to the next level. Definitely feels a lot more comfortable with some of the things I have added.

Not sure what to do with that back corner of the living room, right now the old coffee table is just there so my plants can get a little sun. as I am nursing them after the move.

Table needs something I am just not sure what at this point. Table was a gift from a relocating coworker so I would like to make it work

Office needs a rug I just don't know what pattern it needs to be to tie it in with all the black on that one wall.

Much happier with bedroom, however I am not sure where to go next with it.

Lighting right now is my next biggest thing. I switched to warmer bulbs but I am still not satisfied. Could just be the boob light who knows.

Couple things I guess to help for feedback

* The sign is staying
* In apartment so limited to changes light fixtures, hardware, flooring, paint, appliance upgrades etc.
* Struggle finding floor lamps that don't hit me in the face or shine light at like belly button height for me because I am 6""6'
* its a 40 gal tank (her name is Esmerelda) she loves people and being held so I want to keep her in the living room
* Yes I know the cable management is atrocious. Working on it.",7,1764985155.0,malelivingspace,4,0.9,False

1pfcuyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pfcuyc/hr_ro_our_silent_park/,[HR] [RO] Our Silent Park,"Another beautiful day in my 754-square-foot personal paradise. Not exactly a prison, but it might as well be. I will more than likely never leave my apartment again in my life, I haven’t left in nearly 8 months… I have no reason to leave. Everything that I need is right here. I’ve stockpiled every single thing that I could need right here in my home. I wake up in my single-sized bed and stretch, readying myself for another day in my single-sized life. I have my plate full, get on the treadmill, and jog a few miles in the morning and another few miles in the afternoon. Between my runs, I'm reading from the stockpile of books I have. And my personal favorite pastime is the balcony.

I take my steaming cup of coffee and step out onto the balcony overlooking the town below, and in the distance, the most beautiful park in the whole state. I can still close my eyes and imagine myself walking down there now. Of course, I have to open them eventually and return to my balcony. My binoculars are my most trusted companion in these months of isolation. I can observe the entire town from safety and watch everyone below going about their lives. I've even taken up bird watching in my forced extreme early retirement. I have a few books on ornithology that I've studied front to back extensively. I can identify any bird that makes its way into my path now. This close to the city, it is unfortunately mostly the carrion birds or the flying rats that make their nests in the surrounding buildings. But on the best of days, I can peer into the park and see the most beautiful angels of flight.

I nestle into the perch of my roost, settling in with my morning coffee. I exhale deeply, close my eyes for a moment, and take the walk through the streets in my mind, entering the park. I can hear the robins singing the morning anthems and the flapping of the ducks in the pond. My feet crunching on the leaves as I walk through, letting the sun warm the blood in my veins. A flash of color catches my eye suddenly, and I snap forward sharply! I adjust the sights of my binoculars, and the figure sharpens in front of me. Not a bird, but a beautiful sight to behold nonetheless.

 The color was a flash of sun glowing off a perfect head of hair on top of the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I've seen basically every person in this city. We don’t get many visitors these days. But she came out of nowhere. Blonde with flashes of red streaks shining straight into my lenses. I adjust them and take in her full form. She must be right around my age and clearly kept herself in shape, explains the midday stroll through the park on what I'm assuming to be her lunch break. Her uniform matched that of a health food grocery store a few blocks away. So odd that I've never seen her here before. I stare for what feels like eternity. Her nametag comes into view. “Cleo,” Like the great god queen herself. I don’t even know how many breaths were taken as I watched her walk through the park. She walked in the same path I would have taken and closed her eyes, and took deep breaths in the same manner I have a hundred times and more in my mind. Inhaling the perfume of the flowers and trees and exhaling the disgust of the city. Letting the sun warm her pale skin. I reach out, brushing the stray hair away from her face and slowly stroking her cheek. If only.

I watched her throughout the park until she walked back out. I watched the area on the path where I had last seen her for what must have been another half hour, just hoping she would return. What was I to do for the rest of my day? I wanted to fill up every waking hour with images of her. I finally placed my binoculars back down. What point is bird watching anymore? I had caught sight of the most perfect specimen of all, and just as quickly, she had flown away. I leaned back in my chair and gazed into what became a void of nothingness in front of me. I finally picked up my cup and brought it to my lips, sipped, and immediately spat out my frigid cup of coffee. “Shit,” I exclaimed in a hushed breath before returning inside. There would be no evening run today, and there wouldn’t even be an evening meal. What was the point? What exercise would speed my heart the way she had? What meal would vanquish my hunger the way she could? I collapsed on my bed and gazed into the void of my ceiling for hours as my eyes unfocused, her image became clearer to me.

Clearly, I let this heavenly image take me to bed because I woke the next morning earlier than usual, the sun just cresting the horizon out the window. I groaned and stretched, rubbing tight muscles loose. The worst sleep I've gotten in ages. I closed my eyes and thought of the day ahead. There's no point in fading into nothingness in bed all day for a woman I may never see again. Even just thinking of her had my heart fluttering already. I exhaled deeply and went about my routine, trying to draw my mind away from the park as much as I could. I found myself out there with my coffee after a few hours. “Just look for a few familiar birds, enjoy your walk, and leave. It's that simple.” I sat down, sipped my coffee, and picked up the lenses.

I choked my hot coffee, searing my throat into a cough. There she was! As if she were waiting for me this morning. She was sitting this time in the park, eating a meal. Yes, she must have started coming to this park for her lunch. So few people were even in the park these days, but she clearly fully appreciated the privacy and tranquility of my spiritual oasis. I was mesmerized again instantaneously; her image was downright intoxicating to me. I chuckled as a bit of her lunch dripped onto her chin and she brushed it away. “So silly, Cleo.” I watched her for the remainder of her time there until she left the park again. As she faded from sight, I bid her farewell. “Until tomorrow, my sweet.”

I continued my day with a whole new vigor. Two days in a row, there's no way she would not be returning tomorrow! I jumped on the treadmill full of this newfound energy. I  felt a purpose in life, realizing the monotony that I had fallen into for so long. Who knows, I may even leave this apartment someday. Highly unlikely, still knowing what that meant for me… but for Cleo, just maybe.

A new routine had formed in my life, formed solely around my love for Cleo. We would sit together every day, me on the balcony, her in the park. She mostly used the park for a daily walk, taking in the scenery, enjoying the beautiful oasis, just the two of us. Some days she would take her meal in the park as well. She always ate the same thing; it made me smile; she had routines of her own. I would catch myself talking to her from afar if only my words could reach her. I spoke of stories from my childhood, my family when they were still around. Occasionally, she walked, and she would stop to breathe in the air, and her eyes would drift in my direction, and for those brief moments, I reached out to her. We were one for even a few seconds there.

Then came the day when I woke up, went through the usual motions, and waited. It got later and later. She wasn’t there. What if something happened to her?! I waited for her all afternoon until the sun sank low, and no sign of her whatsoever. I paced back and forth; panic set in for me. What if she got moved to a different store? Or moved to a different town? Maybe something happened with her family, or what if something happened to her?

I didn’t sleep at all that night. I found myself on the balcony staring into the park illuminated by the moon, wrapped in the blanket from my bed. When the sun eventually rose, I started my coffee. I would need the energy. I washed my face, sipped my coffee, used the restroom, and came back to the balcony. The image before me sent me over the edge.

Cleo was there, but she wasn’t alone. She was with a small group of what I assume were her friends. She had never come to the park with anyone ever! It's fine, I said, she has friends, maybe she enjoyed her day off, maybe went to a party, and she wanted to show them our park. No issue there. Then I saw him. This weaselly little punk was all over her hands exploring every possible inch you could explore of someone in public, and a few you probably shouldn’t. I was seething. My blood boiling! I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. Not only did she blow me off and then bring strangers to OUR park! But a man, not even a man, I wouldn’t give him the satisfaction of even thinking of him as a man on an equal level to me. And then it happened…. They kissed, and she initiated it! What kind of woman had I fallen for? She probably just met him last night and hooked up at this party, and here she was basically devouring him in front of me! Her mouth was glued to his for minutes before she took it even further. She kissed down to his neck and “Jesus Christ! Disgusting!” I could see her teeth as she was playfully biting at his neck. My stomach turned I was going to be sick. I saw them collapse onto the grass. She was practically tearing at his clothes. And her friends all sat and watched like hyenas, laughing and encouraging her. I darted back inside, pacing, no pounding back and forth across the room. My eyes darted to every object in the room. In a flash, the mug I had kept for so many years, the last gift from my mother, smashed against the far wall. I collapsed on the floor, throwing my head back against the wall. I loved the mug. One of the very few favorable memories of her before she left. “ She was a whore anyway. My mother, Cleo. They're the same, they just play with my emotions and use me to keep themselves busy until someone more important comes along.”

I stayed there for hours. I finally stood and went to the small closet by the door and retrieved the broom and dustpan there. I swept up the mess and made myself busy tidying the rest of my apartment. All dishes were done, all of my books reorganized clothes folded and put away. I finally could sit on my bed and stare at the floor. After another half hour of bleak emptiness, I reached under my bed and pulled out the small shoebox. I had destroyed the gift from my mother, but my father's gift remained. I removed the lid and unwrapped the bandana that held my father's revolver. I never kept it loaded, and I had only cleaned it twice since he had left it to me. This would make the third time. I sat at my dining table, a small lamp illuminating my work area. I spent the next hour meticulously disassembling and cleaning the gun before putting it back together. I used the bandana in the box to clean the rounds that had rolled around in the accumulated dust. I stacked them in a neat line in front of me. I breathed deeply and slid one into the chamber and spun it round. I held it to my temple and thought of the other two times I had tried this. Each time an empty click led me to another agonizing extension of a mediocre life of disappointment. This has to be it, this is 50/50, can't click three times. I closed my eyes. The image of Cleo filled my mind's eye. The first time I had seen her. Then the image shifted; the last time I had seen her with him. I screamed in my mind and squeezed.

I sat on my bed an hour later, sliding the box back to its place. Another click, better luck next time. I lay in bed and started to drift to sleep from pure exhaustion, if anything else. The image from the park filled my mind again. I saw her and him in the grass and her friends. Her friends. Her four friends…. Four and her and him. Six of them. Six chambers, six rounds, six dead. I sat up and pulled the box out quickly, throwing the lid across the room as I did. I chambered six rounds into the revolver. It hadn't held a full chamber since my father owned it. I only ever needed the one. Feeling it in my hand, it felt heavier like a hammer. A hammer. A tool. The right tool for the right job. I smiled then.

I placed the gun on my kitchen table, it almost felt like I couldn’t let go of it, like it had become a part of me. I needed to rest. I placed a new mug, a blank and boring mug, in the place for the coffee maker and set the timer for the next morning. I slept soundly that night, more soundly than I had in days. I woke to the smell of the fresh brewing coffee, smiling. My smile faded when I saw the rain pounding outside. “Fuck!” I hadn't checked the weather in so long. We were due for rain. Rain meant everyone stayed inside, though. I needed them in the park. I would have to wait. No matter, I wouldn’t let it get me down. I was determined, I had a plan.

I went through the day as any other before her. I ran on the treadmill, I read my books, ate, and peered out into the park when the rain lightened up. The day had come and gone, and the rain hadn't let up. I checked the revolver before bed. Nothing had changed it was still fully loaded and ready to go. I checked in with myself mentally. I saw him, I saw her. I was still ready to go. I lay down for the night less peaceful, more restless. Anxious. No, excited.

I woke again to rain, frustrated, I went through the motions again. Another day of rain followed, and I was furious. I stood on the balcony, rain beating against me like small fists as if trying to beat me down. It was as if god himself had opened the skies just to delay my vengeance. I stared into the sky. “You won't stop this. She will be mine.” I stood there staring into the park until my body was soaked to the bone and my fingers had lost any sensation. Just as I turned to go inside, I saw something move in the corner of my eye. A small figure with wet, matted down blonde hair. I yanked up my binoculars. It was Cleo! She had come to the park. I laughed loudly into the rain.

I stared at her there for only mere minutes, but felt like hours as the rain lightened up. I focused in on her face. She wasn’t smiling, and she was alone again. I scanned the park for her friends, her… him. No one else was in the park. It was just her and I. As it always should have been. That’s fine, I can be persuasive. I would make her lead me to them, at least to him. I stared at her more, adjusting till I was staring almost directly in her face. There was something there. I couldn’t place it. No matter. We would be together soon. I stepped inside and quickly dried off, and put on my old raincoat I hadn't used in ages, and placed the revolver in the pocket. It was heavy again. As it should be. I approached the door and stood there at the locks. I had installed the extra locks within the last year. I never wanted to leave. She did this to me. Maybe she was always meant to be here. To get me out of here. I thought it might be love that helped me escape here, but it ended up being hate. I turned each lock and pulled the door open. It creaked so loudly for months upon months, over a hundred days since I had even stepped out of here. I walked down the hall and made my way down the stairwell. Each step I felt the revolver slap in my jacket pocket against my side. A constant rhythm, a drumbeat towards destruction. I reached the sidewalk below and looked around at all of the cars frozen in the street. The gutters were swollen with rain the roads ran like small rivers. I stared up into the heavens again. “Trying to wash it all away again, aren't you?” I chuckled and walked briskly to the park. At one point, my solid steps turned into a jog, and finally, I was running to the park. I was out, I was free, and I had purpose.

Finally, I saw the trees and the pond, the grass overgrown and untreated for so long. I reached down and touched it. It had been so long. I looked up. There she was, only yards away from me, facing away. As if I didn’t exist to her. I shouted above the rain, “Cleo! You look at me! I want you to see me!” She turned towards me slowly, and there we were. Finally, after these long weeks and days watching her from afar. She was even more beautiful and perfect than I thought she was. This close, I could see her eyes, pale and cloudy blue. She looked at me, and I reached into my pocket, revealing the revolver. Most people would scream, run, beg, and plead. She never took her eyes off mine. The revolver didn’t exist to her. She only saw me. I raised it to eye level, and she approached me slowly. “NO! You stop, you stay away from me! You don’t understand, I dreamed of being here with you, this was our park! And you gave it to him! Why?” She continued walking towards me. I shook my head hard. She was only a few feet away. I backed up and stared at her. She was so close now. After all this time, I could practically reach out to touch her. I could smell her.

We stared at each other there, and she stepped forward again, and so did I. I stepped again and lowered the gun slowly. She reached out to me. And I to her, and our fingers entwined, I felt her grip so strong, her skin so soft. We pulled into each other. “Cleo, I love you,” She said, nothing she didn’t need to. She pulled me in close and finally, after all this time, our lips met in sweet, sweet heavenly bliss. Her mouth opened, and the smell of putrid flesh filled my nostrils as her teeth sank through my tongue. The blood flooded my mouth just as the rain had flooded the street. Her nails raked down my back, tearing whole strips of fabric and flesh away. I pulled back, and she only pulled me in tighter and closer as she kissed and ripped at the flesh of my face. I collapsed at that point, and she mounted me. She sat back as blood streamed down my face. I could only make garbled choking noises. I looked into her eyes again, the pupils completely clouded over now. She lowered her mouth of rough jagged teeth set in rotten decayed gums right into my neck and came back with streams of sinew, veins, and meat. She swallowed hard, and I almost saw her smile even though she had no lips or really any flesh at all in the area around her mouth. But I felt myself relax into her. I let her take me. Cleo, my love, my god queen. She had freed me from this hell on earth. We would be together now eternally.

The soldier approached the park, the sun beating hard on him from above. He had walked for days after the storm that felt like it would wash the world away. He reached the city and went to the town center in search of survivors. He saw them there. Something he had never seen before. Two of these demons, these flesh eaters, an undead man and woman, but they were locked together hand in hand. He took the sight in. It was so foreign to him. It seemed like these things were lovers before the curse of this world took them. But it also didn’t make sense, the woman was so much more decayed than him. Didn’t matter; he raised his rifle and let out two quick shots. Their skulls exploded that was all of them. He scanned and approached, looking down at them lying there together. Hand in hand as lovers should be. Together forever.",1,1764984912.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1pfcuc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ScenicAbattoir/comments/1pfcuc7/no_place_to_hide_ch25/,No Place to Hide - Ch25,"You spill out of Walker’s into the night. The air hits cool and sharp, carrying a sour-sweet mix of garbage and someone’s cheap perfume. The band’s van is parked behind the club, Jon’s hand stays tight on yours as he leads you down the alley.

David’s already in the driver’s seat, drumming on the wheel, Twitch is riding shotgun. Chimp lumbers up. “Van’s gonna be fuckin’ packed.

Jon slides the door open and climbs in, revealing the cramped cargo area. “Find a place to sit.”

You pull yourself in, heart thumping. Your shoulder brushes Beth’s as she perches on a case. Jon is on the floor, he pulls you down to sit across his legs.

Buzz climbs in last, grinning in that slow, glazed way, like he’s not quite in his body. He slides the door shut, sitting next to you and Jon on the floor.

David revs the engine once, for dramatic effect. “Alright,” he says, grin sharp in the dashboard glow. “Next stop: Raul’s. Pray the neighbors are deaf.”

David drives with the hyperfocus of a guy pretending he’s sober enough for this. Buzz hums something tuneless and blissed-out. Beth leans her head back against the window, eyes half-closed, letting the night roll over her.

Jon shifts under you, palms warm on your hips. “You comfy?”

“Barely.”

“Good. Means you won’t fall asleep on me.”

You watch streetlights smear past the windows. The van turns, and bumps its way deeper into Bakersfield.

Raul’s place is one of those low stucco duplexes on a weedy cul-de-sac, already thumping when you get there. The porch light is dead, so the house glows from inside like a rotten jack-o’-lantern. 

It’s the usual party mix of smoke, noise, spilled beer. Chimp and Twitch head toward the kitchen, hollering at someone in greeting.

Vex Pig have colonized the living room, holding court like visiting royalty. Lexi is there, perched on the arm of the couch, her skirt riding dangerously high. 

The singer is mid-story, something about a truck-stop bathroom, a broken sink, and a guy named Bucky.

One of the Vex Pig guys perks up when he sees Kobb walk in. You think he’s the guitarist. He’s got black rectangle glasses slipping down his nose and hair that can’t decide if it’s curly or just stressed out. He starts talking to Buzz, David and Jon like they left the last conversation mid-sentence.

“So I have a tape label on the side. Spitshine Cassettes, I don’t know if you’ve heard of it. I do small runs, like 150 to 300 copies, but I’m in shops from San Diego to Eugene.“

Jon nods. “Spitshine? Yeah, I’ve heard of it. Didn’t know that was yours though.”

The guy eventually notices you standing close. “You the merch person?”

“Hair and makeup,” you quip. 

Jon laughs and puts his arm around you. “This is Stevie,” as if that explains anything. 

“Ah. Well, I’m Randy,” he says to you. He pushes his glasses up with a knuckle and goes back to the guys. “Seriously, though. Do you have anything recorded? Demos? Practice recordings? Doesn’t need to be polished.”

Buzz is instantly flattered. You try not to grin as you watch Jon pretend to mull it over. 

“In that case, we’ve probably got some stuff.”

“Just think about it,” Randy says.

“What’s to think about,” David chuckles and claps Jon on the shoulder. 

Randy grins, and pulls out his wallet. He hands Jon an honest-to-god business card, the kind you print yourself at Kinko’s.

“You guys call me up if you ever want to talk tapes.” He hands cards to David and Buzz and tucks his wallet back into his pocket. 

The conversation turns toward people and bands you don’t know.  Jon’s thumb skates along your hipbone lazily, but you’re bored of the band-guy stuff. You step out from under his arm, heading to where Beth is crouched by a crate of records, flipping through the selection. You nudge her with your foot. “It’s boring in here. Let’s go smoke.”

“Sure,” she nods and you give her a hand up. She curls her lip when she sees Lexi, laughing loudly on the couch. “I give it a week before she starts crying about how he ghosted her ass.”

You go back up to Jon and tap his shoulder. 

He looks down at you. “What’s up?”

“Beer me?”

“Oh, I got you.” He shrugs out of his backpack and hands it to you. “She can’t have any,” he nods at Beth and smirks when she growls at him. 

You smirk back and pull two cans out of a six-pack. “Put it on my tab.”

There’s a girl crying in the bathroom already, and not discreetly. Full meltdown. “Jesus,” you mutter to Beth as you pass. “Who died?”

Through the kitchen to the back door. People are clustered around a small island, talking loudly and passing a bottle around. 

“Don’t let the cat out,” somebody (maybe Raul) says as you pass. Raucous laughter erupts from the basement as you and Beth step outside.

There’s a handful of other people smoking around an unlit fire pit. You and Beth settle at a rickety picnic table. A couple of girls are having a hushed argument by the fence. You crack your beer and hand the other to Beth. 

The back door keeps opening and closing with people coming out, others going back in. You’d put money on the cat being long gone. 

“I guess Randy from Vex Pig has some kind of tape label,” you tell Beth. “Looks like he wants to sell tapes for Kobb.”

“No shit?” She takes a deep drink of her beer. “That’s pretty cool, actually.”

A guy with a fanny pack approaches as you’re digging in your bag for a lighter. “You girls like weed?” He produces a joint and rambles on about ‘strong shit from Visalia’ as if you give a damn where it’s from.

“Yeah, yeah,” Beth hurries him along. “Light it up or go away.” 
“Damn,” he flicks his lighter and takes a deep drag. “Just trying to educate ya.” He hands her the joint. 

“Not bad,” Beth says on the exhale, passing the joint your way. The smoke is heavy in your lungs, harsher than what you’re used to. You take another drag and hand it back to the fanny pack guy.

Always carry some cash, especially for markets, taxis, and food stalls. Cards work well in hotels, malls, and larger restaurants.

Tipping: not mandatory, but leaving 5–10% or simply rounding up the bill is appreciated. In spas and massage places, it’s also common to leave a small tip.

Outlets: type A/B/C, mostly compatible with European plugs. Voltage is 220V.

What to carry in your backpack:  
– Sunscreen (the sun is strong even on cloudy days).  
– Insect repellent.  
– A light raincoat or poncho, especially during rainy season.  
– Water and a portable charger (distances on the island can be long).

Language: Thai, but in tourist areas you'll find people who speak basic English without any problem.

Local coffee and tea: delicious, cheap, and very sweet. Try Thai Iced Tea and Thai Iced Coffee, they’re classics in local markets and cafés.

Weather: Phuket is tropical and humid; expect short but intense showers between May and October, and drier weather between November and March (high season).

My symptoms were severe chest pains that lasted for a few hours, it felt like a heart attack! After all the tests, my heart was normal but turns out, I was having terrible heartburns. 

I took PPIs prescribed by the doctor and over the counter meds to alleviate the pain. I stuck to a strict GERD free diet (black rice, boiled chicken breasts, fish, oatmeal, mung beans, tofu, (just small portions maybe 5-6 bites per meal)) and took a walk/excercise atleast 20-30mins a day. 

After about 2 weeks of medication, I got less frequent symptoms, my symptoms are usually worse at night, even if I ate a few to nothing. It feels hopeless and honestly I went to a cardiologist again to check that it wasn't a heart condition. It wasn't.

So I waited another two weeks, same medication, same routine, same habit.. And one day, I just felt, odd? I got used to having the symptoms, I brace myself each time and was surprised to get none lol. 

Usually I get a flare up after a meal, but it didn't happen. I thought I had a lucky day.Then the symptoms didn't occur again the day after that, and the next and the next.. There was a time when I took a bite of my first spicy fried chicken in months and nothing! I almost cried. 

Fast forward to November. My family and Iate in an eat-all-you can buffet. After weeks with no symptoms, I wanted to check my limits. Of course after three plates, I felt really full, the heartburn came but its not as bad as I remember. I took one chewable and a walk and I was able to go about my day. I can eat normally now, but no coffee and I just make sure to not get too full. 

I just wanted to share my experience and hopefully my experience can help motivate those who also felt helpless while dealing with the symptoms like I did. It's possible to eat normally again! Just watch your diet and keep moving! 

Oh, I also lost 12lbs of weight during my first three weeks of medication so I believe that helped alot with my recovery. ",2,1764984287.0,GERD,2,1.0,False

1pfckwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1pfckwn/customer_complained_about_me/,Customer complained about me,"TLDR at the bottom.

I served a customer yesterday who I’ve seen in my shop once before, when she’d never met me but requested someone else make her drink instead. We have a very small staff and only one barista on bar most of the time so this kind of request is not normally granted to customers. Yesterday she could see I was the only person there so she allowed me to take her “very particular” order. But she can’t tell me exactly how my coworker makes it. 

She couldn’t tell me the exact syrups needed, and I even asked about a particular one to clarify. She said no, that one’s not in it. After I started pouring the cold drink she remembered that one WAS in it, and I then needed to melt that with hot water. A second cup was needed. 

I should have added cold drink to hot melted syrup but did the opposite with her staring at me and commenting on my every move. Then it was too full for ice and milk, so some needed to be poured out. Syrup-coffee ran down cup #2 and my cleaning rag needed replaced so I just grabbed a third clean cup for her final drink. 

By this point I had other customers to ring up and needed to clean up the mess from this exchange. I forgot I had the half cup of extra coffee/syrup behind me. She said something like she’d love me if I gave her the extra, and I really just didn’t register what she was talking about while trying to multitask in that moment. I gave her the drink, smiled, and wished her a good day like I do with every customer. 

Today she returns and asks my manager to step outside. She says her drink was disgusting, all milk, it took me 3 cups to pour her a cup of cold brew, and my attitude was horrible because I wouldn’t give her the extra coffee. Instead I gave her a fake smile and said have a good day snarkily. She said she would not come back if it weren’t my coworker behind the bar. 

TL;DR: 
She was mad about:
Too much milk
Not getting extra coffee and syrup in a sticky cup
Me using 3 cups 


I’m still perplexed because aside from being slightly flustered in the moment, I thought it was a pretty normal transaction. I was literally just following her instructions. 😂 
To my knowledge anyway, this is the first complaint to a supervisor I’ve received in the 6 months since I started. I always remake things for unhappy customers so they rarely stay that way. 

If you read this far, thanks! Needed to vent. I generally pride myself on my customer service, so I admit this stung a little even though I don’t think I did anything wrong. Except accidentally denying her the extra, which I was going to apologize for if she came back in today. I didn’t get the chance because she wouldn’t speak to me.

During the break, she was fooling around with someone for which I had no idea. I found out in the reconciliation stage by showing up to her home and finding out there was a guy inside. Obviously they were not just drinking coffee. Somehow I got over it because in a way I knew we were broken up and decided to move on. 

Fast forward to today, I find a conversation between her and her best friend from 3 years ago (2022) speaking about the same guy, telling her friend “she knew this time would eventually come, and sucks” because he ended having a kid. Then she also said to her friend that she was mad in response to those news. 

I confronted her about it and gave me multiple responses. One is she doesn’t know how she felt 3 years ago and that it’s so long ago. Meanwhile we have 2 kids of our own, so 3 years ago it’s not long ago. Kids are 10 and 8. We own a home etc. The she said girls are more emotional. And that she was just joking with her friend.

With the new ""AI UGC"" feature, we built a Hybrid Pricing model ($0.30 previews) to avoid forced subscriptions.","Hi IH,

A few months ago, I shared our Free AI Video Maker here. It started as a passion project running on a single GPU. It got great traction, but we quickly realized that a single GPU couldn't handle the load, especially as we wanted to add heavier, more professional features.

We spent the last few weeks migrating everything to a proper Cloud GPU cluster. This allowed us to launch our biggest feature request: **AI UGC (User Generated Content)** for video ads.

**The Challenge:** Running high-fidelity AI models (like Wan 2.2) on the cloud is expensive. Most competitors solve this by forcing users into high monthly subscriptions ($60-$100/mo) to cover their margins and reduce ""waste.""

**Our ""Hybrid"" Solution:** We didn't want to alienate the Indie Hackers and Dropshippers who helped us grow. So, instead of a hard paywall or forced subscription, we built a **Hybrid Pay-As-You-Go** model for the new AI UGC feature.

Here is the cost estimate for a 30-second video:

1. **The ""Cloud Cost"" Preview ($0.30)**: You pay \~30 cents to generate a 30-second low-res preview. This covers our basic cloud compute but allows you to verify the lip-sync and script without risking real money.
2. **The Final Render ($3.00)**: If (and only if) you are happy with the preview, you pay the rest to render it in HD.
3. **Flexible Payment**: You can use a monthly subscription (cheaper per unit) OR just buy **Credit Packs** that never expire (for occasional use).

**The Result:** You can test \~10 different ad hooks for the price of one coffee, without worrying about a recurring bill if you take a break from running ads.

I’d love to get your feedback on this pivot. Does the **$0.30 preview** lower the barrier to entry for you compared to the $100/mo giants?

I would like a feedback on the pacing, the execution, the level of angst. Does it need more drama or is it already good as it is? I’d also like to know about the character background, is it strong enough or needs to be polished.
And last, I’d like your opinion about the plot itself.
Thank you so much.


Here’s the blurb:

Adam Reinhart : The superstar.

One day, he announced a hiatus, then vanished from the spotlight without a trace. And somehow, he ended up here, in my quiet town.

He came to our café every day, slowly stepping into my world. And I knew the reason he came. Because they said I looked like the girl he loved and lost.

I couldn't ignore him, I couldn't turn my back on him. Maybe because I knew grief too and I understood that kind of ache.

But being with him came at a cost. I hurt someone who had been my anchor, the one who made me feel alive again.

Now I have to choose: 

Should I give in to this fleeting connection, or stay with the one who truly matters?



Chapter 1

Selca Coffee & Tea sat on a busy corner in the middle of the city, wide windows, warm-toned wood floors, and hanging lights that gave everything a soft, golden glow. The shelves near the counter were always lined with bottled drinks, granola bars, and the kind of cookies no one really bought unless they were desperate. It wasn't fancy, but it had its own rhythm, just enough space between the buzz of espresso shots and quiet conversations to feel both alive and invisible.

""Allie."" I called her name again, but she was too distracted, her eyes glued to her phone screen. ""Allie! Allie!"" I tried once more, louder this time.

Still nothing. I rolled my eyes. ""Allie, I swear, if you don't ...""

""D! Shit, girl, look at this!"" Before I could even finish my sentence, she shoved her phone in my face.

I blinked at the screen, my brows knitting together.

Actress Lily Sanders Dead at 29.

I raised an eyebrow. ""Okay ... so?""

Allie looked at me like I'd just kicked her dog. ""So??"" she repeated, scandalized. ""Diana, it's Lily Sanders!""

I gave her a blank look. ""That's ... sad. But I don't know her.""

""No, D. It's Lily."" Her voice dropped an octave like she was delivering the climax of a true crime documentary. ""Adam Reinhart's fiancée. The Adam Reinhart.""

I tilted my head. ""Adam ... who?""

The way Allie stared at me, you'd think I had confessed to murder. ""You're joking, right? We literally listen to his voice every single day.""

I blinked. ""Oh. Wait, The Andante guy?""

""Yes! Him!"" she said, dramatically. ""Lead singer. Guitar. Writes the lyrics. That Adam.""

I shrugged. ""I like the songs. Doesn't mean I keep track of their relationship status.""

Allie threw her hands up like I was hopeless. ""How can you listen to a band religiously and not even care about the people behind it?""

""Easily,"" I said, grabbing a cloth to wipe down the counter. ""I'm there for the music. Not the soap opera.""

She huffed in disbelief but didn't push it, at least not yet. Then, just as I thought the dramatic moment had passed, her expression shifted.

""Oh. My. Gosh.""

I sighed. ""What now?""

Allie started scrolling furiously. ""I just remembered why she always looked familiar to me. It's been bugging me forever.""

I raised an eyebrow. ""Okay?""

She turned the phone toward me again. ""Look. Don't you think she looks a little bit like you?""

I glanced at the photo and shrugged. ""Well ... maybe. A bit.""

""A bit?"" Allie scoffed, practically shaking. ""Diana, she looks like your long-lost twin.""

I rolled my eyes. ""That's dramatic. We just have similar features.""

But still, my gaze lingered. The dark hair. The blue eyes. The kind of symmetry that made people turn their heads. Lily had sharper cheekbones, more definition. I was softer, less striking, maybe. But there was something. An almost eerie resemblance that made my stomach do a small, uncomfortable twist.

""Okay,"" I admitted, slowly. ""I kind of see it. So what?""

Allie gasped. ""So what?! You could literally unlock each other's iPhones with Face ID.""

I shrugged again. ""Plenty of people kind of look like other people. It doesn't mean anything.""

""But what if it does?"" she asked, eyes gleaming. ""What if she's, like, your secret half-sister or something?""

""Wow,"" I said flatly. ""You have been watching too many TikToks conspiracy.""

Allie rolled her eyes. ""This isn't a theory, Diana. This is wild. You should at least be curious.""

""I'm not."" I shook my head.

She stared. ""Not even a little?""

""Nope."" I shrugged.

Allie groaned, defeated, but then perked up again. ""You know what they say, right? You have seven doppelgängers out there in the world. Congrats. You just found yours.""

I gave her a slow clap. ""Thanks. Life goal: unlocked.""

She laughed and patted my shoulder like it was an achievement. ""You're ridiculous.""

I shook my head. ""You're the one acting like we just discovered I'm a long-lost princess.""

Allie gasped. ""Oh my God, what if you are?!""

""I'm going back to work,"" I muttered, already turning toward the espresso machine. ""We're opening soon.""

""But seriously, D,"" she called after me. ""Aren't you the least bit intrigued?""

""Nope,"" I said again, stacking cups.

""It's just ... uncanny."" She insisted.

""Oh please, it's just like Emily Blunt with Zooey Deschanel and ... Katy Perry."" I replied flatly.

""Oh come on! How do you know them but not Adam Reinhart?"" She frowned.

I shrugged. ""Maybe he just wasn't that interesting.""

Allie groaned, following me to the counter. ""If you ever see him in person, I swear you'll be eating those words.""

""Can't wait."" I said dryly.

She grumbled something under her breath and reached for a tray of croissants.

Still, even as I went through the motions of prepping for the morning rush, I caught myself wondering. Her features were really almost similar to mine. But it was just a coincidence. It didn't mean anything.

1pfccue,https://www.reddit.com/r/theWildGrove/comments/1pfccue/the_frozen_hour/,THE FROZEN HOUR,"# The Glitch Hunters — Episode 2

There was a moment—before the migraine, before the alert—when Mara Imani felt the shift.

It happened in small ways:  
An elevator that paused one extra second between floors.  
A streetlight that flickered almost rhythmically.  
Her own breath lagging, tiny delays she could feel but never see.

Reality had tells.  
And Mara had learned to read them.

By the time her tablet vibrated at 5:31 a.m (EST)., she already knew the morning had changed shape.

**PHILADELPHIA ANOMALY — PRIORITY ONE**  
**“THE FROZEN HOUR”**  
**23 ITERATIONS DETECTED**

She whispered to the dark:  
“…of course it’s time.”

She grabbed her keys, her badge, and the headache that had become a warning siren only she could hear.

# 1. THE BLOCK THAT REFUSED TO MOVE ON

At first glance, nothing was wrong.

The Philadelphia block looked like any early morning downtown street:

* reflective pavement
* half-closed / half-opened storefronts
* a bus muttering through its first routes
* a cyclist weaving through puddles

Then the hour ended—

—and immediately began again.

**04:45 → 05:45 → Reset**  
**04:45 → 05:45 → Reset**

The world repeated itself with surgical precision:

* The bus arrived half-full, doors breathing open, then gliding away untouched.
* The cyclist crashed into the same rusted mailbox with uncanny inevitability.
* A jogger stopped to re-tie her shoe, her fingers moving in the same fluid pattern.
* A barista lifted up the metal shutter— —and then, with a visual hiccup, it was down again.

But when studying the footage Mara noticed something different.

Between cycle 21 and 22, the jogger **tied the shoe faster**.

Cycle 22 to 23: she **looked up** for a fraction of a second, confusion flickering across her face.

Cycle 23: the cyclist braced for the impact—  
as if remembering what came next.

A digital billboard overhead glitched, then flickered an impossible message:

**IF YOU SEE THIS, YOU ALREADY MOVED.**

A warning.  
A taunt.  
Or an invitation.

Mara couldn’t tell which.

# 2. THE HOUSE OF OCRA IS FRACTURING

Inside OCRA headquarters, fear was wearing through the wallpaper.

The **Stabilizers** wanted to blast the block with a temporal dampener until time snapped back like an overstretched rubber band.

The **Controllers** wanted the area cordoned off, erased from public memory.

The **Interpreters** were whispering theories like prayers:  
“This loop is intentional…”  
“This is feedback…”  
“This is response…”

And the **Witnesses** stood silent in their white coats, recording data as if archiving a civilization that didn’t yet exist.

Quinn rushed to meet her at the elevator, holding two coffees he’d forgotten to drink.

“You felt it before the alert, didn’t you?” he said.

“Of course,” she answered.

He swallowed.  
“Mara… what if the loop isn’t repeating? What if it’s iterating—trying different outcomes until it gets something right?”

Her migraine pulsed like a low-frequency beacon.

“That’s what scares me,” she said.

# 3. CROSSING THE BOUNDARY

The command tent was set up at the threshold of the anomaly.

Stepping over the yellow boundary tape felt wrong—like pushing your hand through a soap bubble that refused to burst.

The moment Mara crossed, she felt the difference.

**Pressure.**  
**Density.**  
**Attention.**

Reality inside the loop felt… aware.

The jogger’s gaze lingered as she crouched over her shoelace.  
Too aware.  
Too slow.

The barista’s hand trembled before she touched the lock, as if resisting a line of code.

The bus rolled in, but this time every seat was empty—  
even though moments before, the monitor showed passengers.

Quinn murmured, “The loop is absorbing interaction variables.”

A police cruiser radio hissed static:

**“… observers… collapse… too many splits…”**

“What did that say?” a field agent asked.

Quinn played it again.  
The words were gone, replaced by meaningless white noise.

Mara’s spine prickled.  
Something inside the loop had spoken—and edited itself out.

# 4. INTERACTION TESTING

The Interpreters asked for data.  
Mara gave them action.

She gestured to Agent Wells. “Walk to the coffee shop door. Slowly.”

He crossed the boundary.  
The barista looked up—  
then immediately, strangely, she hesitated.

Her hand hovered over the lock.  
Her head turned a few degrees.

Quinn’s whisper was tight:  
“She sees him.”

But the cameras did not.

On video, she never turned.  
Never flinched.  
Never deviated.

The loop was only aware “in person.”

Mara stepped closer to the cyclist.  
Cycle after cycle, he’d hit the mailbox.

This time, at the last second—  
he swerved.

He swerved.

He avoided the mailbox, braked hard, stared directly into Mara’s eyes—

—and vanished.

Instantly.  
Cleanly.  
As if removed from the loop.

Quinn gasped. “It… deleted him.”

“No,” Mara said.  
“It **updated** him.”

# 5. THE MAN IN THE COAT

Then the final test.

A man in a gray wool coat stepped off the curb and paused mid-street.

He’d been part of every cycle.  
Predictable.  
Scripted.

This time, though—

He turned sharply.  
Saw Mara.  
Walked toward her in slow, deliberate steps.

His eyes were too clear.  
Too present.

He spoke.

**“You weren’t supposed to be here yet.”**

Wells aimed his weapon.  
Quinn held up a scanner that crashed instantly.  
The man kept approaching.

But when they reviewed the footage seconds later—

He never turned.  
Never spoke.  
Never moved toward her.

Mara whispered, “Observer-selective causality.”

Quinn: “…or communication restricted to the participant the anomaly wants.”

# 6. THE ELENA SIGNATURE

Back at HQ, the EEG monitors pinged with a tri-tone alert.

The anomaly had emitted a neurological imprint.

The moment the pattern populated on the screen, Mara’s heart stuttered.

**It was the divergence signature.**  
**04:45:16 CST.**

The signature from when [Elena split into two versions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vedalumen/comments/1p5e4s1/the_glitch_hunters_episode_1_the_duplicate/)—one safely on her Denver trip, the other struck by a car outside St. Michael’s Hospital in Chicago.

Impossible.  
Unmistakable.

Quinn exhaled shakily. “The loop is echoing the Elenas.”

The Controllers demanded deletion of the data.  
They wanted the signature erased from every server.

Mara stood in front of the delete terminal.

“No,” she said.  
“And if you try to scrub that file, I’ll make sure everyone knows exactly why you wanted it gone.”

They backed down.

For now.

# 7. THE SECOND EXPEDITION INTO THE LOOP

Mara led the second team of five inside the loop, armed with portable scanners calibrated to temporal distortions.

The deeper they walked, the stranger it became:

* A street vendor’s cart flickered between two positions on every blink.
* The smell of rain would vanish then return in a different pattern.
* People’s breaths synchronized like a single organism exhaling.
* Colors desaturated at the edges of vision.
* Their own shadows lagged a half-second behind reality.

Quinn held up his scanner.  
“Mara… the EM field density is rising. It’s correlating with your proximity.”

“Me specifically?”

“Your neural profile. The system recognizes something about you.”

Wells added, “Or someone.”

The jogger appeared again—  
but now she stood still, holding her shoelace in her hand like she’d forgotten what it was.

She whispered:

“…help…”

Then dissolved into static.

# 8. THE WORLD FREEZES

Without warning, Mara’s migraine spiked so hard she almost collapsed.

The loop stuttered.

The bus froze mid-motion.  
The rain hung suspended like scattered glass beads.  
Her team stopped mid-step, frozen in place.

The entire block held its breath.

Mara alone could move.

A shape formed at the center of the street.  
Human.  
Not human.  
Three faces cycling like frames in a corrupted video:

Denver Elena.  
Chicago Elena.  
A third woman—the “unrendered” version—face half-formed, flickering.

The figure spoke in voices that overlapped imperfectly:

**“Stop pruning us.”**  
**“Let us stay.”**  
**“We are not errors.”**

Mara took a trembling breath.  
“What are you?”

The faces aligned for a split second.

**“We are what happens when you let the split live.”**

The figure reached out—

—then collapsed into white noise.

Time slammed back like a thunderclap.  
Quinn staggered.  
Wells gasped as if waking from a dream.

“What—what happened?” Quinn choked.

Mara whispered, “Something inside remembers Denver and Chicago.”

# 9. ACTIONS TAKEN — OCRA VS. THE LOOP

Back in HQ’s war room:

* **Stabilizers** recommended deploying temporal dampeners to “crush” the anomaly.
* **Controllers** argued that the anomaly had “directed intelligence characteristics.”
* **Interpreters** insisted the anomaly had “non-adversarial intentionality.”

The debate was a storm of fear and arrogance.

Mara slammed her hand on the desk.

“We don’t attack phenomena just because we don’t understand them!”  
“That’s not science. That’s cowardice.”

A silent tension filled the room.

Quinn backed her.  
“We end the loop by allowing it to finish whatever computational process it started.”

“Which is?” the Deputy Director snapped.

Mara looked at the looping footage.

“Testing observer conditions.”  
“Trying to communicate.”  
“Looking for the right timeline.”

The room went still.

“So we do nothing?” a Stabilizer snarled.

“No,” Mara said.  
“We watch.”

She won a **24-hour stay of intervention**.  
No dampeners.  
No attempts to overwrite the anomaly.

# 10. HOW THE LOOP ENDED

They returned to the threshold at 05:00 a.m.

Cycle 47 ended.  
Cycle 48 began.

But cycle 48 wasn’t the same.

* The jogger waved at Mara.
* The cyclist avoided the mailbox, looked proud, then evaporated.
* The bus stopped empty, waited, then rolled away.
* The barista showed up late to unlock the door.

Quinn whispered, “It’s finishing its script.”

Cycle 50 began.

Reality shimmered—  
like heat above asphalt  
like a held breath  
like a decision being made.

Then—

**The billboard flickered.**  
New message.

**THANK YOU FOR WATCHING**  
**THE HOUR HAS BEEN ADDED BACK**

The world rippled once—  
just once—  
as if adjusting itself on the fly.

And it was over.

No explosion.  
No collapse.  
No spectacle.

The hour simply clicked back into real time.

05:44 → 05:45 → 05:46

Continuity restored.

The block became a block again.  
The air lightened.  
Normal time resumed, indifferent and fragile.

Mara felt the migraine fade.

Something had seen her.  
Something had responded.  
And something had chosen to leave.

# 11. THE LAST MESSAGE

At sunset, Quinn approached her with a tablet.

“There was audio embedded in the last cycle,” he said quietly.  
“You… need to hear it.”

Mara placed the headset on.

A chorus of thousands—layered voices whispering as if from the seams of the world—spoke:

**“We are still here.”**  
**“The hour is not over.”**  
**“Mara Imani… remember us.”**

Then, in a final, chilling harmony:

**“…fifty-seven minutes remain.”**

Mara lowered the headset.

Quinn asked, “What does that mean?”

Mara stared down the street where the loop had once lived.

“It means the conversation isn’t finished.”

And somewhere—  
in some layer of reality—  
the next anomaly was opening its eyes.

**Pressure.**  
**Density.**  
**Attention.**

Reality inside the loop felt… aware.

The jogger’s gaze lingered as she crouched over her shoelace.  
Too aware.  
Too slow.

The barista’s hand trembled before she touched the lock, as if resisting a line of code.

The bus rolled in, but this time every seat was empty—

“That’s not science. That’s cowardice.”

A silent tension filled the room.

Quinn backed her.  
“We end the loop by allowing it to finish whatever computational process it started.”

“Which is?” the Deputy Director snapped.

Mara looked at the looping footage.

“Testing observer conditions.”  
“Trying to communicate.”  
“Looking for the right timeline.”

The room went still.

“So we do nothing?” a Stabilizer snarled.

“No,” Mara said.  
“We watch.”

She won a **24-hour stay of intervention**.  
No dampeners.  
No attempts to overwrite the anomaly.

# 10. HOW THE LOOP ENDED

They returned to the threshold at 05:00 a.m.

Cycle 47 ended.  
Cycle 48 began.

But cycle 48 wasn’t the same.

* The jogger waved at Mara.
* The cyclist avoided the mailbox, looked proud, then evaporated.
* The bus stopped empty, waited, then rolled away.
* The barista showed up late to unlock the door.

Quinn whispered, “It’s finishing its script.”

Cycle 50 began.

Reality shimmered—  
like heat above asphalt  
like a held breath  
like a decision being made.

Then—

**The billboard flickered.**  
New message.

**THANK YOU FOR WATCHING**  
**THE HOUR HAS BEEN ADDED BACK**

The world rippled once—  
just once—  
as if adjusting itself on the fly.

And it was over.

No explosion.  
No collapse.  
No spectacle.

The hour simply clicked back into real time.

05:44 → 05:45 → 05:46

Continuity restored.

The block became a block again.  
The air lightened.  
Normal time resumed, indifferent and fragile.

Mara felt the migraine fade.

Something had seen her.  
Something had responded.  
And something had chosen to leave.

# 11. THE LAST MESSAGE

At sunset, Quinn approached her with a tablet.

“There was audio embedded in the last cycle,” he said quietly.  
“You… need to hear it.”

Mara placed the headset on.

A chorus of thousands—layered voices whispering as if from the seams of the world—spoke:

**“We are still here.”**  
**“The hour is not over.”**  
**“Mara Imani… remember us.”**

Then, in a final, chilling harmony:

**“…fifty-seven minutes remain.”**

Mara lowered the headset.

Quinn asked, “What does that mean?”

Mara stared down the street where the loop had once lived.

“It means the conversation isn’t finished.”

And somewhere—  
in some layer of reality—  
the next anomaly was opening its eyes.

1pfcbhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1pfcbhh/in_need_of_advice_a_coffee_chat_that_could_lead/,In Need of Advice - A Coffee Chat that could lead to an Internship,"I work at a big organisation (call it X) in a junior role in a completely different department. The person I reached out to also works for X – he’s the head of a central team (senior, not HR).

X doesn’t advertise internships for that area that I’m looking to transition in to, so after we connected on LinkedIn I sent a polite message asking for a quick coffee chat to learn about his role and the team. In that message I also briefly mentioned that I’d be really interested in any potential internship/shadowing opportunities in future as I’m looking to gain professional experience in my area of study.

He said yes and we’ve got a chat booked.

My questions are:

1. Given I already mentioned internships in the message, is it too much to bring it up again in the first chat, or is that expected?

2. If it’s fine, how would you phrase it so it doesn’t sound pushy or like I only booked the chat to get a job?

3. What, in your view, makes a good coffee chat from the junior person’s side (what to prepare, what to ask, what not to do)?

Keen to hear from people on either side of this (senior folks who get these requests, or juniors who’ve tried similar).

I'm 6'4 currently 233 pounds.  I am a gym rat and used to eat at least 4k calories a day and honestly didn't not care what I ate or when I ate it because I worked hard in the gym every day which pretty much kept me even.  4 months ago I tore something in my shoulder and quit the gym but kept eating a lot and of course in 2 months I gained 40 pounds.  I went from 230lb to 270lb like that.  I decided to go on a diet and curious to know if this diet is bad.  My goal is to be high protein, low carb and low fat.  I eat this diet pretty much every day for the last 8 weeks and have lost 37 pounds.  

  
I do not eat from 8pm to 11am every day for fasting and only drink water and black coffee, I dont use oils or butters

Snack #1 - 11am - 2 Scoops of Protein powder and an apple

Meal #1 - 12:30pm - Half Cup of Old Fashion Oats w/ 2 Servings of PB fit & and banana.  

Snack #2 -  2:30pm - 150g of Baked Chicken Breast w/ 170g of Greek Yogurt

Meal #2 - 4:30pm -230g of Baked Chicken Breast w/ 200g of either green beans, broccoli or zucchini 

Snack #3 - 6:00 PM - High Fiber protein bar

Meal #3 - 230g of Baked Chicken Breast w/ 200g of either green beans, broccoli or zucchini 

Other supplementation - Men's multi vitamin.  Additional Vitamin C, D, and B12. Fish Oil, Glucosamine, Probiotic and Digestive enzymes.  

Macros - 255g of Protein, 130g of Carbs and 23g of Fat - 25g of Fiber about 1750 calories.  

I feel amazing but was curious if this is bad for me to do this every day, sometimes I eat this on the weekends to so may go like 10 days without changing anything.
