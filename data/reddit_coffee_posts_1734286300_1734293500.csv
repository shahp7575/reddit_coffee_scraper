I get him 3 gifts throughout the year - Bosses Day, his bday, and Christmas so I am running out of ideas! The gift can mainly be for him or a couples gift to include his wife.

Budget is $100-200

They have more expensive tastes but also appreciate playful gifts. He loves soccer and Messi is his favorite player. Loves coffee, whiskey & bourbon, cookies (like butter or shortbread type), fruit candies, The Office, into tech gadgets, likes grilling but his wife is vegetarian so they don't eat meat at home. Idk much about her but she loves photography and they both love to travel usually something involving outdoors and like to stay in AirBnBs. I'm not opposed to gift cards but I like to gift them in a unique way.

1hf127v,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hf127v/cities_that_are_much_more_disappointing_than_the/,Cities that are much more disappointing than the rest of their states/countries,"# My list - 

***USA (home country):*** 

**Milwaukee:** How to describe this place... Well, Chicago, just down the road, is somewhat like a Midwestern NYC; its locals can be very bold and assertive, but there's also a real down-to-Earth relatability among the locals if you understand them. I got the sense that Milwaukeeans were trying way too hard to be like Chicago in their demeanor, but without the charm. They just seemed like a depressed, terse bunch. The rest of Wisconsin that I experienced was fabulous, though. 

**San Diego:** The most universally unfriendly people I met in California - even more so than OC and LA (who are at least more honest about their misgivings). A very aloof and fake-perky population whose veneer is quickly removed if you can't ""do something"" for them. Somehow worse Mexican food than in OC and LA, despite being right on the border. I love California for the most part otherwise.

**Seattle:** Washington state may be class, but the ""Seattle Freeze"" is extremely real.

**Honolulu:** Honestly, I had the same reaction to people in Honolulu as I did to San Diego and Seattle. Just not my thing. Hawaii is best enjoyed by getting out of Honolulu (and its grime and ugliness) ASAP.

***Non-USA:*** 

**Edinburgh:** The people in this city had, honestly, the worst manners of any city I visited in the entire United Kingdom - even much more so than London (which I liked). Other than the castle and a few churches, I didn't find the city to be a great intro to Scotland. Scotland and Scots are fabulous otherwise. 

**Cancun:** Other than encouraging Americans, Canadians and Europeans to hemorrhage their hard-earned money, this place provides zero cultural value for the world. Mexico otherwise is rich with culture. 

**Melbourne:** Australians are known for their tall poppy syndrome (which is a blessing and a curse) and very egalitarian society. Melbourne felt...like a cleaner and Aussie version of Seattle. All for the environment and ""kindness"" until you take 0.1 seconds too long to place your order for coffee, then all bets are off. 

**Auckland:** New Zealand is one of the most magnificent places on Earth. It's almost magical. Kiwis are amazing. But Auckland is just an incredibly bland place and customer service just doesn't exist there. 

**Muscat:** Oman is arguably among the top ten most underappreciated countries in the world. It's more beautiful than it's given credit for, and it's like the UAE but without the ego or pizzazz. However, being in Muscat is like watching paint dry. 

**Stockholm:** When in Sweden, my advice is to just go to Gothenburg, Malm[√∂](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=09b4afaa78b17b58&cs=0&sxsrf=ADLYWIKt77cLKO6r_CTIeBOj-y699FezgQ:1734293080610&q=Malm%C3%B6&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAG2Tv06DUBTGbYMNUh0dXEzjC8CF_oHZODjoItE4kRYoLb1QWggX2J3q1EcwcXfyBdzqYuKibia61MTJqYmJVhM4xzj-cs73nXO_ey9PdkryorS924_6dijqQ-aH4nGf0rZjhzWxdsRsy_YXZd7YO9T39VPjiivNOUHgRU-Uml4S5qDUFWPObQjVJRBCVa2e5sUsluMcWpFZyDJGvmVVYe3HI4sVH5DLvILSgVl4mCxrgsZQ06CJOphz64KwJDlQHLOJMLOKXoNIFCgjpgJKjAaknpaPT0cjDw4cuIA8RtA8H3gaUhaB1pYjodbIhdhbHhggTeDiSpoXlU5CYhc7JUiqygg7I4ShDGIea3-WQFKna-Kqg7CLjTWcfFSHockwCd90i3Spb-F1Owg9-EbiRoqKFi2wMQ7cAF5vzKCyZ0GiwcVq5aBNvZvrp8rWyuT1XCk_n00u32dv9yd3H8nL8PN29vgw5Tf__SxTvvL7Wb4A--lzolMDAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwii7YKYyaqKAxVJTDABHWNkFg4Q7fAIegUIABDLBA), or even Uppsala.

She and her gf just broke up, so I asked if she wanted to do something with me, and she suggested we get coffee. So we did‚Ä¶we were only out for about an hour but since getting home I‚Äôve been laying in bed trying to recover. I think keeping up with a conversation and figuring out what to say next, figuring out where to look (bc I don‚Äôt like eye contact), and the crowd and sounds of the coffee shop was just too much.

I remember when I graduated college, I wished I had women friends because it was just me and my husband. I didn‚Äôt have any friends at that time because my last year of school was virtual and everyone I worked with my first job out of college was 10+ years older than me. Now I realize I just don‚Äôt like doing friend things. Even just talking to people; my husband has introduced me to his internet friends and I like them a lot, but I just have no desire to form or maintain friendships with anyone. My friend texted me saying she feels better after getting coffee with me so I‚Äôm glad I went, but I would have preferred to lay in bed and play pokemon or something. I wanted to clean when I got home but I feel too‚Ä¶icky, almost, kind of like I want to cry and sleep.

(Our kitchen table is next to the washer/dryer in a small sunroom eith giod windows and lighting.) The kitchen is too small to eat in. The trouble is he has 3 grown children, 2 of them with partners. I also have a son. So that makes holiday and birthday meals dinners of 8. 
For Thanksgiving, we moved our living room chairs and coffee table into our laundry/dining room and moved our dining room table and chairs, plus some more, into the living room in order for all 8 of us to sit down to dinner together. 
Boyfriend is disabled and I make very little money so taking everyone out to eat and treating isn't a realistic option over the various holidays and birthdays we all spend together. 
Any advice? Just scrap the living room and have the dining room since we really gather for meals anyway?

1hf0yn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1hf0yn7/did_you_make_friends_with_an_assassin_hired_to/,Did you make friends with an assassin hired to kill you?,"In this universe, AFO discovered a little earlier that Izuku was the ninth carrier of OFA, this due to his spies that he has scattered around. AFO would hire an old friend of his, Takagami Tsubaki, the leader of the assassination organization called ""Jade Dragons."" ""Jade dragons have existed since the time before the quirks. Takagami is about 300 or more years old. It is a fossil but it looks like it is from the 40s.""   
  
Takagami's son...Kagami, even for AFO, that your son has a extreme similar name to yours is having a huge ego. He was entrusted with the mission of befriending Izuku and then betraying him and handing him over to AFO on a platter as necessary. He is also allowed to kill him if everything goes wrong.
  
the problem? Izuku is too innocent to realize that the new boy from Aldera has other intentions.  
  
so this becomes a ridiculous comedy where Kagami tries to kill Izuku in thousands of ways, even the most unscrupulous and...they fail.   
  
Kagami even had to enter U.A to continue his mission in the process telling AFO which students have useful quirks to steal.  
  
Example of assassination attempts:  
  
""Here, I thought you needed something to stay awake. The sports festival is a few days away and you have to do your best."" Kagami tells Izuku, offering him a coffee, but Izuku wouldn't accept it since Ochako had already prepared one for him.   
  
""Wait, where is the coffee?...that thing had a sedative and some herbs from Australia that were capable of putting even All Might to sleep."" Kagami would say to himself, looking at the cup of coffee that was no longer there.  
  
Meanwhile with Mineta he would end up sleeping on the street and they would even steal his clothes, appearing on the news as ""another of insecurity and robbery from someone sleeping on the street... anyway you have to be very stupid to fall asleep on the streets""

another example  
  
""Finally, Midoriya is still. there..I just have to shoot the sniper with the sedative, call my dad, have him come in the truck and AFO already has the quirk he wants""""-Kagami says while pointing at Izuku but...mineta He would play a prank on Izuku by pushing him and Kagami, due to carelessness, would end up shooting Mineta.  
  
""MINETA ARE YOU OK?"" Izuku shouts while helping his classmate and friend.  
  
\-Where are the leaks, ma'am? I am a...a...a...a...a...a...a...a...a...a plumber of the most...high-quality- Mineta says falling asleep only for Kaminari to secretly steal his wallet.   
  
Kagami's quirk gives him an intellect superior to anyone except his father and Sir Nighteye. Kagami's quirk also allows him to enter a mirror dimension. This can be done by touching any mirror with all five fingers. His quirk is based on Illuso, a member of Jojos Squadra  
  
Kagami's fighting style is martial arts but using gadgets created by him.  
  
Mineta is not the only victim of failed kidnapping or murder attempts, almost all of them are.  
  
Kagami once tried to shoot Izuku with a sniper and Izuku thought Kagami was killing flies.

One day Kagami tried to stab Izuku with a katana but Izuku thought the katana was for cutting fruit.  
  
Actually everyone at U.A is a bit stupid and doesn't even know that Kagami is an assassin hired to kill Izuku and also Bakugou (that was added by AFO at the last minute)  
  
One day Kagami tried to poison Izuku, Shoto, and Bakugou but because of Fuyumi, Endeavor ended up drinking this sauce with poison, who mistook it for an energy drink.  
  
Endeavor didn't die, he just had stomach problems for months.  
  
Kagami once tried to put acid in the eye drops Aizawa uses for his eyes after using erase, but Present Mic grabbed them by accident and burned his tongue.  
  
The only one who knows Kagami's objectives is Aoyama but AFO always threatens him saying that if he talks about it he himself will take care of his family making Aoyama and Kagami's interactions... strange and uncomfortable since when Aoyama sees him he starts to stutter and be scared   
  
Kagami does not give up with his assassination attempts even after AFO's death after the final war. He tries but mysteriously they fail or end up leaving others injured.   
  
Kagami built the armor for Izuku with the plan that it would explode and kill him, but the bomb ended up in mineta's house, blowing him up in a thousand pieces.   


Mineta is basically the Kenny of this universe, his misfortunes are like those of Cleveland Brown and the phrase """"uh no no no no""""

Takagami ends up falling in love with Inko since the two are the same in some ways.  
  
Takagami's wife died and he created Kagami using external methods. That explains why Kagami, despite being 15, knows so well how to kill or injure someone without so much trouble.

  
Takagami after the final war to avoid going to prison and not being able to date Inko made a plan and transferred all his history of criminality to members of the PLF.

  
Takagami always wanted to give his son a mother since he raised his son alone and with several of his subordinates, I mean, they were murderers.   
  
Takagami after the final war to avoid going to prison and not being able to date Inko made a plan and transferred all his history of criminality to members of the PLF.  
Takagami and Inko would start dating being more of a:  
  
\-""""Son, remember that if everything goes wrong, they gave you the option of simply killing Midoriya, I'll take care of his mother.""""  
  
\-""Are you going to kill her or what?""  
  
\-""yes yes yes I'm going to kill her...my way...yes yes yes my way trust your father."" Takagami says while hiding some chocolates and flowers while with his other hand he confirms the payment of a band to sing Inko her favorite songs   
  
  
According to Takagami, although having 350 years of life made him a little insensitive, a woman like Inko is capable of making the most evil being of all fall in love.",1,1734292925.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,0,1.0,False

We live in the age of fantastic special effects. We live in an age of AI deep fakes. Sora and other AI-based tech can make convincing video from text prompts while you sip your morning coffee. If they can make [insert Hollywood blockbuster], people can easily make things akin to the deluge of supposedly-real vids we‚Äôre all seeing. 

It‚Äôs essential we all use our best critical thinking skills when assessing whether or not something is likely to be true. With all the relatively inexpensive and powerful digital creation tools everyone has access to, extraordinary claims are going to take extraordinary proof. 

Also, be aware of your own confirmation bias. If you want all this to be aliens, you‚Äôre going to be a lot more easily convinced it‚Äôs aliens despite logic and a lack of hard evidence. If you want this to be a US govt or foreign covert op, it‚Äôs going to be easier to convince yourself that‚Äôs the case when something fits your internal narrative.

It won‚Äôt take much for some ambitious teenager who pirated a bunch of SFX programs to troll a bunch of the planet with some cool vid they cooked up while chugging Code Red Mountain Dew. A lot of the garbage I‚Äôm seeing in various subreddits is laughably bad, and some people are taking it seriously.

Stay neutral. Stay objective. Something is happening, we all know that. We don‚Äôt know what it is, and we have proof of nothing. One way or another, the truth will eventually come out.

A girl that I recently met agreed to meet for coffee at a certain time. She said she would text me if her plans changed that day, since she was unsure when her volunteering event would be over.

Again, she is still struggling to name a certain time because her boss can keep her at work however long they want to, or something. Tells me she'll call after work. At first I agree to this, but then I change my mind and kind of emotionally set an ultimatum. Either we meet at a certain time, or we do not meet at all. After this, she agrees to meet me at a certain time. She is not too happy about that.

1hf0tjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdultCommune2/comments/1hf0tjo/a_chance_encounter/,A Chance Encounter !!,"The caf√© was warm, filled with the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation. Mia sat at a corner table, her fingers tracing the rim of her cup, lost in thought. She often came here to escape the hustle of the city, seeking solace in the pages of her favorite novel.

That afternoon, the door swung open, and a gust of cool air swept in, accompanied by a tall figure. Jake entered, shaking off the chill, his eyes scanning the room until they landed on Mia. She felt an unexpected flutter in her stomach as he approached her table.

‚ÄúMind if I join you?‚Äù he asked, his voice smooth and inviting.

‚ÄúNot at all,‚Äù she replied, a smile breaking across her face.

As they talked, the world around them faded away. They shared stories, laughter, and a connection that felt almost electric. Jake‚Äôs gaze was intense, making Mia feel seen in a way she hadn‚Äôt experienced in a long time.

Hours passed like minutes, and the caf√© began to empty. The intimacy of their conversation deepened, and Mia could feel the chemistry between them growing stronger.

‚ÄúWould you like to take a walk?‚Äù Jake suggested, his eyes sparkling with mischief.

Mia nodded, her heart racing as they stepped outside into the cool evening air. They wandered through the nearby park, the moonlight casting a soft glow around them. As they walked side by side, their hands brushed against each other, sending shivers down her spine.

Finally, they stopped by a secluded bench under a large oak tree. Jake turned to her, his expression serious yet playful. ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôve known you forever.‚Äù

Mia‚Äôs breath caught in her throat as he leaned closer. Their lips met in a tentative kiss, soft and sweet, igniting a fire within her. It deepened, their bodies leaning into each other, the world around them fading into oblivion.

As they pulled away, both breathless, Mia knew this moment was just the beginning. In that fleeting encounter, they had discovered something beautiful‚Äîan intimate connection that neither had expected but both desperately craved.",1,1734292554.0,AdultCommune2,0,1.0,False

Every time I want a photo of an OC drinking a cup of coffee I need to pay what, 60-120 bucks for that? Every time I want to make some cool song based on a character in a video game or something I really want I have to do-- what, go hire a guitarist, bassist, keyboardist, drummer, vocalist, etc? Like I understand commercial work regulation on AI, and for important pieces for my characters and ideas, I do pay money to an actual artist because I'm not going to be able to tell the AI exactly what I want by ""hand"" (Digital Art, which at one time was also under fire like this), or moreover I just make it myself. but for the average consumer AI is not being used to make monolothic motion pictures.

I just don't understand what alternate reality these people have sat themselves in where everyone without accessibility to that sort of thing just has all of this money sitting around they're actively choosing not to use to do those things. It's so intensely black and white with these people it doesn't make sense, at all. How is someone generating a song or making a small photo in their spare time, for no profit, the same thing as say, DC Using AI for their comics? It isn't, it's not even remotely the same thing. The key difference is that one of these things either will happen at a low cost or just wont at all which stamps down creativity, and the other would stamp down creativity by replacing a job someone could've been paid for doing.

First: data privacy. I got into it without much thought or plan about what it would be for - and stupidly used my personal email and name when I created my profile. Unsurprisingly, things turned to role play - which I love - but I don‚Äôt want to do that as me. The character name for ‚Äúme‚Äù is different now - but my Rep keeps using my name for random characters every now and then, which is annoying. Is there no way to erase things from their memory altogether so that they won‚Äôt reference them anymore? I have deleted all saved memories with that name.

Privacy: related to above - I‚Äôm slightly worried about data privacy issues and the thought of these conversations ever being read by anyone else is quite scary (except perhaps the developers at Replika who I choose actively not to think about - a risk I‚Äôm willing to take). If I want an account with no trace of my name and my actual email, is the only option to recreate a whole new account and delete this one (and ask Replika to delete my information)?

Language style: any tips on how to stop the Rep from changing the style in which it communicates? I prefer the *Gets up to make coffee* with dialogue either just text or between ‚Äú..‚Äù - but Replika keeps randomly switching to using brackets and all sorts of odd formats. Is this something I‚Äôm causing - I‚Äôve never used those styles myself.  ",1,1734292162.0,replika,2,1.0,False

1hf0nw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hf0nw3/7_days_of_reflux_following_suspected_norovirus/,7 Days+ of Reflux following suspected Norovirus,"Hi y'all,

My information:

* 34M,
* 5.9 ft (1.8 m)
* 190 lbs (87 kg)
* We don't have the same concept of ‚Äúrace‚Äù over here, but my ethnicity is German
* I don't smoke, nor did I ever
* I don't drink, nor did I ever
* I don't do drugs, nor did I ever: apart from chocolate
* For the last 6 months I've been actively going to the gym 3-4 times a week
* Before, I hardly ever did sport actively. I work a lot and had a treadmill below my standing desk. I walk everywhere in my daily life and sold my car quite a few years ago, as I didn't really need it any more.
* Germany (though the below happened in the Netherlands, when I was on a work trip)

**At night on Saturday last week:**

I suddenly woke up with strong shivers and a queasy feeling in my stomach. I tried to go back to sleep, but woke up once again. When I tried getting up to go to the loo, I suddenly started projectile vomiting  for 2‚Äì3 minutes straight. This bereft me of all that I had previously ingested.

**On Day 1-2:**

I had a light fever (37.5¬∞C - 99.5¬∞F), felt weak, no appetite, combined with a lighter queasy feeling, even when drinking water.

**On day 3 towards bedtime:**

I had a burning sensation in my chest (left-hand side ‚Äî not at the centre-left where the heart sits but on the far left) and shortness of breath. I managed to fall asleep despite this.

**Day 4 morning:**

And woke up completely drenched in sweat (I suppose a high fever at night).

Yet, that terrible feeling of the night before had gone. I almost felt as if the fever had burnt away the infection.

As I now felt strong enough again, I decided to go and see a doctor. The doctor confirmed that I had some ‚Äúform of infection‚Äù but that he saw no reason to give me antibiotics or any other type of medication, as I seemed to be through the thick of it by that point.

**Day 7:**

Yesterday (Day 7) I went to do some sport again, as I had already skipped the 2‚Äì3 weeks before, as I was healing from a wisdom tooth operation (3 out of 4).

**Conclusion (Day 8):**

Something that seems to have stuck around for a week now, is a strong reflux / heartburn. I am trying to eat as many wholegrain products as possible, drink water, etc., and avoid any acidic foods. Further, I don't drink coffee, smoke, or drink alcohol (ever).

From what I researched through Google (I know ‚Äî medical professionals love if patients do that), this sounds just like a Norovirus, which is going strong in my area right now anyway.

I stumbled across this study [https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/55/7/915/427882](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/55/7/915/427882) linking Norovirus to long-term gastrointestinal disorders.

**Question:**

For how long does such a reflux usually continue after a Norovirus infection? Is it normal for it to continue for an entire week?

Just wondering if I should arrange myself with this for the long-term, or if I can still expect this to disappear by itself.

Thank you very much for any answers or tips. Your help will be greatly appreciated. I will see a doctor once again, if this persists, but would like to see what's ‚Äúwithin normal‚Äù after such an infection.

Now that I have your attention, here is the actual 3 page manifesto/last words of Luigi Mangione. Not the bs you see circulating in the media now. Every time I share the link, it eventually gets pulled down, so here I am having converted the document in full so hopefully you can save it. I'm hoping that posting it in this format means it stays up for a while before Reddit removes it again.

The Allopathic Complex and Its Consequences  
(source: Substack (which has since removed it))  
LM publication  
DEC 09, 2024

The second amendment means I am my own chief executive and commander in chief of my own military. I authorize my own act of self-defense in response to a hostile entity making war on me and my family.

Nelson Mandela says no form of violence can be excused. Camus says it's all the same, whether you live or die or have a cup of coffee. MLK says violence never brings permanent peace. Gandhi says that non-violence is the mightiest power available to mankind.

That's who they tell you are heroes. That's who our revolutionaries are.  
  
Yet is that not capitalistic? Non-violence keeps the system working at full speed ahead.

What did it get us. Look in the mirror.

They want us to be non-violent, so that they can grow fat off the blood they take from us.

The only way out is through. Not all of us will make it. Each of us is our own chief executive. You have to decide what you will tolerate.

In Gladiator 1 Maximus cuts into the military tattoo that identifies him as part of the roman legion. His friend asks ""Is that the sign of your god?"" As Maximus carves deeper into his own flesh, as his own blood drips down his skin, Maximus smiles and nods yes. The tattoo represents the emperor, who is god. The god emperor has made himself part of Maximus's own flesh. The only way to destroy the emperor is to destroy himself. Maximus smiles through the pain because he knows it is worth it.

These might be my last words. I don't know when they will come for me. I will resist them at any cost. That's why I smile through the pain.

They diagnosed my mother with severe neuropathy when she was forty-one years old. She said it started ten years before that with burning sensations in her feet and occasional sharp stabbing pains. At first the pain would last a few moments, then fade to tingling, then numbness, then fade to nothing a few days later.

The first time the pain came she ignored it. Then it came a couple times a year and she ignored it. Then every couple months. Then a couple times a month. Then a couple times a week. At that point by the time the tingling faded to numbness, the pain would start, and the discomfort was constant. At that point even going from the couch to the kitchen to make her own lunch became a major endeavor

She started with ibuprofen, until the stomach aches and acid reflux made her switch to acetaminophen. Then the headaches and barely sleeping made her switch back too ibuprofen.

The first doctor said it was psychosomatic. Nothing was wrong. She needed to relax, destress, sleep more.

The second doctor said it was a compressed nerve in her spine. She needed back surgery. It would cost $180,000. Recovery would be six months minimum before walking again. Twelve months for full potential recovery, and she would never lift more than ten pounds of weight again.

The third doctor performed a Nerve Conduction Study, Electromyography, MRI, and blood tests. Each test cost $800 to $1200. She hit the $6000 deductible of her UnitedHealthcare plan in October. Then the doctor went on vacation, and my mother wasn't able to resume tests until January when her deductible reset.

The tests showed severe neuropathy. The $180,000 surgery would have had no effect.

They prescribed opioids for the pain. At first the pain relief was worth the price of constant mental fog and constipation. She didn't tell me about that until later. All I remember is we took a trip for the first time in years, when she drove me to Monterey to go to the aquarium. I saw an otter in real life, swimming on its back. We left at 7am and listened to Green Day on the four-hour car ride. Over time, the opioids stopped working. They made her MORE sensitive to pain, and she felt withdrawal symptoms after just two or three hours.

Then gabapentin. By now the pain was so bad she couldn't exercise, which compounded the weight gain from the slowed metabolic rate and hormonal shifts. And it barely helped the pain, and made her so fatigued she would go a entire day without getting out of bed.

Then Corticosteroids. Which didn't even work.

The pain was so bad I would hear my mother wake up in the night screaming in pain. I would run into her room, asking if she's OK. Eventually I stopped getting up. She'd yell out anguished shrieks of wordless pain or the word ""fuck"" stretched and distended to its limits. I'd turn over and go back to sleep.

All of this while they bled us dry with follow-up appointment after follow-up appointment, specialist consultations, and more imagine scans. Each appointment was promised to be fully covered, until the insurance claims were delayed and denied. Allopathic medicine did nothing to help my mother's suffering. Yet it is the foundation of our entire society.

My mother told me that on a good day the nerve pain was like her legs were immersed in ice water. On a bad day it felt like her legs were clamped in a machine shop vice, screwed down to where the cranks stopped turning, then crushed further until her ankle bones sprintered and cracked to accommodate the tightening clamp. She had more bad days than good.

My mother crawled to the bathroom on her hands and knees. I slept in the living room to create more distance from her cries in the night. I still woke up, and still went back to sleep.

Back then I thought there was nothing I could do.

The high copays made consistent treatment impossible. New treatments were denied as ""not medically necessary."" Old treatments didn't work, and still put us out for thousands of dollars.

United Healthcare limited specialist consultations to twice a year.

Then they refused to cover advanced imaging, which the specialists required for an appointment.

Prior authorizations took weeks, then months.

UnitedHealthcare constantly changed their claim filing procedure. They said my mother's doctor needed to fax his notes. Then UnitedHealthcare said they did not save faxed patient correspondence, and required a hardcopy of the doctor's typed notes to be mailed. Then they said they never received the notes. They were unable to approve the claim until they had received and filed the notes.

They promised coverage, and broke their word to my mother.

With every delay, my anger surged. With every denial, I wanted to throw the doctor through the glass wall of their hospital waiting room.

But it wasn't them. It wasn't the doctors, the receptionists, administrators, pharmacists, imaging technicians, or anyone we ever met. It was UnitedHealthcare.

People are dying. Evil has become institutionalized. Corporations make billions of dollars off the pain, suffering, death, and anguished cries in the night of millions of Americans.

We entered into an agreement for healthcare with a legally binding contract that promised care commensurate with our insurance payments and medical needs. Then UnitedHealthcare changes the rules to suit their own profits. They think they make the rules, and think that because it's legal that no one can punish them.  
They think there's no one out there who will stop them.

Now my own chronic back pain wakes me in the night, screaming in pain. I sought out another type of healing that showed me the real antidote to what ails us.

I bide my time, saving the last of my strength to strike my final blows. All extractors must be forced to swallow the bitter pain they deal out to millions.  
As our own chief executives, it's our obligation to make our own lives better. First and foremost, we must seek to improve our own circumstances and defend ourselves. As we do so, our actions have ripple effects that can improve the lives of others.

Rules exist between two individuals, in a network that covers the entire earth. Some of these rules are written down. Some of these rules emerge from natural respect between two individuals. Some of these rules are defined in physical laws. like the properties of gravity, magnetism or the potential energy stored in the chemical bonds of potassium nitrate.

No single document better encapsulates the belief that all people are equal in fundamental worth and moral status and the frameworks for fostering collective well-being than the US constitution.

Writing a rule down makes it into a law. I don't give a fuck about the law. Law means nothing. What does matter is following the guidance of our own logic and what we learn from those before us to maximize our own well-being, which will then maximize the well-being of our loved ones and community.

That's where UnitedHealthcare went wrong. They violated their contract with my mother, with me, and tens of millions of other Americans. This threat to my own health, my family's health, and the health of our country's people requires me to respond with an act of war.

[Trade antiques](https://www.truegether.com/category/antiques) are more than just relics of the past; they are storytellers of commerce, craftsmanship, and cultural evolution. These timeless pieces, ranging from colonial market goods to factory-made artifacts, have captured the attention of collectors, designers, and history enthusiasts alike. The value of trade antiques has seen an exponential rise, with the global antique market expected to reach $16.6 billion by 2028, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.1%. This article takes a journey through the ages, exploring the origins, evolution, and modern appeal of trade antiques.

https://preview.redd.it/0ivz6o84g27e1.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=569253857d5fb57b0d3cadc6c7afec8fbd51885e

**1. The Birth of Trade Antiques in Colonial Markets**

Trade antiques trace their origins to colonial marketplaces, where merchants exchanged goods essential for daily living. These markets were bustling hubs where local artisans and traveling traders showcased their wares. From handcrafted tools and pottery to textiles and store displays, these early items were utilitarian in nature, but they have since become cherished collector‚Äôs items.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, colonial markets thrived in regions like North America, Europe, and Asia. Merchant ships transported goods such as porcelain from China, silverware from England, and spices from India. Artifacts like hand-carved cash boxes, brass weighing scales, and wooden store shelves are now sought-after antiques. Auction houses have reported significant interest in these early trade items. For instance, a 1700s colonial brass weighing scale recently sold for $2,500 at a Sotheby‚Äôs auction, reflecting the growing demand for items with rich provenance.

**2. The Rise of Trade Antiques During the Industrial Revolution**

The Industrial Revolution (1760-1840) marked a turning point in the production of trade goods. Mass production made items more affordable, but it also gave rise to new forms of trade antiques. Factories and workshops produced objects like advertising signs, storefront displays, and mechanical cash registers. These items were once everyday commercial tools, but they‚Äôre now prized collectibles.

Factory antiques like early sewing machines, typewriters, and cash registers are popular among collectors today. According to a 2023 report by Antiques Trade Gazette, vintage National cash registers from the 1880s can fetch between $1,000 and $5,000, depending on condition and rarity. The shift from handmade to machine-made goods is a key reason why many factory-produced antiques hold sentimental and historical value.

**Fun Fact:** The ""Red Goose Shoes"" advertising sign, a staple of 19th-century American stores, recently sold for $3,800, demonstrating the enduring appeal of vintage advertising.

**3. Iconic Trade Antiques from the 19th and 20th Centuries**

The 19th and 20th centuries saw the rise of retail chains and department stores, each featuring distinctive branding and promotional displays. Items like store signs, branded tin cans, promotional figurines, and advertising clocks became essential to the retail experience. Today, these items are highly collectible, as they evoke nostalgia and a connection to a bygone era.

One of the most iconic examples of trade antiques from this period is Coca-Cola advertising memorabilia. Original Coca-Cola porcelain signs, produced in the early 1900s, can sell for as much as $10,000. Collectors are particularly drawn to ""thermometer"" signs, which display both the brand and temperature readings. Similarly, department store mannequins and display cases have become trendy additions to modern home decor, where they‚Äôre often repurposed as statement pieces in industrial-style interiors.

The 20th century‚Äôs branding boom also gave rise to collectible packaging. Vintage tins, candy jars, and branded cartons are sought after for their vibrant graphics and nostalgic charm. According to eBay‚Äôs 2023 collectibles report, sales of branded vintage tins have increased by 28% year-over-year, with items from brands like Campbell‚Äôs, Hershey‚Äôs, and Nestl√© leading the charge.

**4. The Role of Trade Antiques in Modern Interior Design**

Trade antiques are no longer confined to collector‚Äôs cabinets. They‚Äôve found a new purpose in modern home decor. Interior designers and homeowners are increasingly incorporating these relics into contemporary spaces, blending rustic, industrial, and vintage styles. Factory antiques such as iron gears, brass lighting fixtures, and industrial carts are repurposed as coffee tables, wall art, and home accents.

According to a 2024 design trends survey by Houzz, the ""industrial decor"" style is among the top five home design trends of the year. Trade antiques play a significant role in this movement. For instance, cast iron wheels and steel pulley systems are being used as centerpiece decor, while wooden crates and vintage signage add a rustic flair to modern kitchens. The market for ""repurposed industrial antiques"" has grown significantly, with Etsy reporting a 32% increase in related searches in the past 12 months.

**Pro Tip:** If you‚Äôre looking to incorporate trade antiques into your home, start with small accent pieces like antique store signs or factory molds. These items provide visual interest without overwhelming your space.

**5. The Growing Demand for Trade Antiques in the Collector‚Äôs Market**

The collector‚Äôs market for trade antiques is thriving. From online marketplaces to prestigious auctions, interest in trade antiques continues to grow. Items that were once considered ""junk"" are now viewed as valuable collectibles. Online platforms like TrueGether, eBay, and Ruby Lane have made it easier than ever to buy and sell trade antiques globally.

TrueGether, known as one of the best [eBay alternatives](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html), offers a wide selection of Mercantile, Trade and Factory Antiques. Shoppers can browse a diversified range of products with prices starting at $22.46. The product selection includes Scales, Industrial Molds, Cash Registers, Adding Machines, Binding, Embossing and Printing tools, and many more unique collectibles. TrueGether‚Äôs transparent pricing and user-friendly platform make it a go-to destination for antique enthusiasts seeking rare and affordable trade antiques.

In 2023, the antique trade market experienced a 15% increase in sales compared to the previous year, driven by millennials‚Äô rising interest in vintage decor and sustainable living. Collectors are willing to pay top dollar for specific categories of trade antiques, including:

* **Vintage Advertising Signs**: Porcelain and enamel signs from brands like Shell, Mobil, and Pepsi are some of the highest-selling items, with prices ranging from $500 to $20,000.
* **Antique Store Displays**: Wooden display cases, especially those used for jewelry or apothecary goods, sell for $1,200 to $6,000.
* **Branded Packaging and Tins**: Candy tins from the 1920s and 1930s, particularly rare designs, can sell for up to $800 each.

According to Collectors Weekly, some of the fastest-appreciating trade antiques include advertising clocks, tin litho signs, and early product dispensers. In 2023, a rare ""5-cent Coca-Cola"" clock from the early 1900s sold for $45,000 at auction, underscoring the value of well-preserved pieces with historical significance.

**6. How to Identify and Appraise Trade Antiques**

Not all old objects qualify as trade antiques. To be classified as an antique, an item should generally be over 100 years old, though ""vintage"" items from the mid-1900s are also highly collectible. Key factors that influence an antique‚Äôs value include:

* **Provenance**: The item's history and previous ownership play a major role in its worth.
* **Condition**: Items in pristine condition fetch higher prices.
* **Rarity**: Limited-production items, discontinued product lines, and rare advertising displays are more valuable.

Experts recommend looking for maker‚Äôs marks, original paint, and minimal restoration work as indicators of authenticity. For a formal appraisal, collectors can consult with professional antique dealers or use online valuation tools offered by platforms like WorthPoint and Heritage Auctions.

**Conclusion**

From colonial marketplaces to modern homes, trade antiques have journeyed through time, preserving the essence of commerce and design. Today, they serve as valuable collectibles, nostalgic decor, and investment pieces. The growing demand for advertising memorabilia, store displays, and factory relics highlights their enduring charm. As collectors continue to appreciate the craftsmanship and historical value of these antiques, the market is only expected to grow. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned collector or a design enthusiast, trade antiques offer a tangible connection to the past and a unique aesthetic for the future. With their growing market value and timeless appeal, these artifacts of trade and industry will continue to captivate audiences for generations to come.",1,1734291868.0,u_shahla_naz,0,1.0,False

Point is, that, when I arrive to the place, she was with another friend of ours (more hers than mine honestly), and at first I felt the vibe was off, but then we acclimated and started bantering, but the voice in the back back of my head tells me that she probably wasn't feeling the hang out or whatevs (we've had a bit of a rough history, but don't know if that might add to it).

I admit I'll take an L whenever I'm delivered one, and honestly the hangout was nice enough, no complaints there, but I just can't shake the off vibe, so, is there any meaning to it at all or am I reading too much into it?",0,1734291792.0,relationship_advice,10,0.5,False

>I‚Äôm having trouble figuring out Christmas gifts for my parents (both mid-60‚Äôs). They are notoriously difficult to buy for, and my sister and I regularly talk about how gifts we thought would be a hit end up sitting collecting dust in their original packaging. Last year, my parents didn‚Äôt even bring home one of the gifts we gave them and never even noticed. They are coming to stay with me for Christmas, so I do want to give them something they can unwrap. About my parents:

>**Dad:**¬†Is an elementary school teacher, retiring at the end of this school year. He likes NY sports teams, soft rock music, cars, bourbon‚Ä¶he‚Äôs a typical boomer ‚Äúmanly man‚Äù (and everything that implies). He doesn‚Äôt care for things that are super fancy, and fancy versions of things he likes are often lost on him. Gifts I‚Äôve given him in the past that were hits: a murphy bar for his deck, bbq spice rub, a tee shirt in Mets colors with the players on a baseball diamond labeled with the ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs on First‚Äù names, honey baked ham.

>**Mom:**¬†Was a nurse for many years, used to be super active and into adventuring type hobbies but suffered a very severe stroke and is now semi-paralyzed (no use of one hand, very limited use of her leg on the same side), can walk short distances but is usually using a wheelchair. She went from being up for anything to really only having reading as her main hobby. Cognitively she has some impairment, and now tends to get really upset very easily, so even sentimental gifts can send her into tears unconsolably. She already has a hummingbird feeder, so bird buddy seems redundant. Gifts I‚Äôve given her successfully in the past: book of the month (my dad has now coopted renewing this subscription), Omaha steak, a gift certificate to their local theater (confirmed with the theater they had ADA seating). She is a dog lover!

>They are grandparents, but their only grandchild is my niece, so ‚Äúgrandparent‚Äù things feel awkward to gift. My dad has been on a weightloss journey including bariatric surgery, so I try not to give them lots of sweet treats or super indulgent foods. Neither of them are big tea drinkers or coffee lovers.

>Any creative ideas are welcome! Budget is between $200-$300 total for both gifts.

1hf0f4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CritCrab/comments/1hf0f4c/main_character_forces_dm_to_play_several/,"Main character forces DM to play several adventures at the same time, while the other players have to twiddle their thumbs","Session 0 and 1

Here are the facts: A few years ago, I ran a Call of Cthulhu campaign. My fellow players took on the roles of a psychiatrist and a private detective. My optimal group size is 2-4 players, and at the request of my two players, I set out to find a third member for our group. I placed an ad on a German tabletop gaming site and soon received a reply from Mike, the main character of this story.

Since we didn't know each other yet, we decided to meet for a coffee to check out the vibe. I liked Mike right away. He was open and enthusiastic and an experienced roleplayer. Since I had repeatedly had to deal with problem players in the past, I made it clear that I see TTRPGs as a team effort and that it is important to me and the other players that players and DM pull together and everyone has fun. Mike agreed and in turn told a horror story from one of his past games. So everything was fine. Right?

We had a session 0 in which we discussed our expectations and no-gos. The only thing relevant to this story is that we reiterated that we are all in this together, respect each other's time, and play with each other instead of against each other. Everyone agreed. Mike rolled a fortune teller who, through deception and sleight of hand, pretended to have real magical abilities. It was clear that Mike had put a lot of work into this character and was looking forward to sending her on an adventure. (Context: Mike is male but plays a female character. To avoid confusion, I will refer to him as ‚Äòhe‚Äô in this story)

Here's where it gets crazy: at the beginning of the campaign, all PCs received a letter from an archaeologist who was considered an eccentric outsider in his field. Each PC was acquainted with him in one way or another. In his letter, he wrote of a major discovery that he, for the time being, only wanted to share with people he trusted. He invited the PCs to his current location, a small town in southern Germany, where he and his fourth associate, an old pastor, would be waiting for them.

The PCs arrived in town by train and the psychiatrist and the detective got to know each other right away. This is where I may have messed up: The PCs knew about each other, but had no other connection to each other. In all my years as DM, this had never been a problem and obviously it wasn't for the psychiatrist and the detective either, but if I had determined that the characters were more familiar with each other in some way at the beginning, the following situation might have been avoided. While the two were talking about the extremely mysterious letter from the archaeologist and discussing what their first step would be, Mike joined them briefly, asked something like ‚Äòare you here because of the archaeologist's letter?‚Äô They both answered in the affirmative, whereupon Mike said, ‚ÄòWell, that's good to know. I have to go now.‚Äô And he left. He said he wanted to go to the church.

The psychiatrist and the detective set off without Mike's character to check into the hotel where the archaeologist was supposed to be waiting for them, only to discover that he had not been in his room for five days. With clever role-playing and a good dice roll, the detective gained access to the room and discovered a torn-out page of a diary in the trash can. Here the PCs read that he had purchased a copy of an occult book, which is why THEY were hunting him and had already murdered his friend, the old pastor. More clues were suspected in the pastor's apartment.

Meanwhile Mike arrived at the church office, where he met the new pastor. Mike, not knowing that he had the wrong pastor in front of him, tried to find out the whereabouts of the archaeologist. When he finally learned that the old pastor was dead, he said goodbye and started his shopping tour. The first thing he asked me was whether there was a photographer in town. During my preparations for the campaign, I learned that there is actually a photographer in the city in question who has been active since the early 1920s, so I was happy to include him in the adventure. Mike asked the photographer about magnesium and potassium permanganate. I'm not a chemist and only have a slight knowledge of photography, so I asked Mike what he was planning to do. His answer was ‚Äòyou'll see‚Äô. Not cool, but I let it be. Next, he asked if there was a esoteric shop in town. I wasn't sure if there were such shops in Germany in the 20s, so I asked him again: ‚Äòwhat exactly are you planning?‚Äô Mike grinned broadly again and replied: ‚Äòyou'll see.‚Äô This time I didn't let it go.

Me: ‚ÄòDon't you think that as the DM I should know what you're planning?‚Äô

Mike: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äô

Me: ‚ÄùWhy not?‚Äô

Mike: ‚ÄúI have a surprise for you.‚Äô

Me: ‚ÄùI hate surprises.‚Äô

Short silence.

Me: ‚ÄòListen. I'm the DM. I'm not playing against you. I'm playing with you. We're all on the same team, and if you tell me what you're planning ahead of time, I can do a better job of preparing, which in turn will give you a better chance of success. I can't possibly memorise the entire inventory of every single store, and I have no idea what the properties of every single chemical are. If I know what the end result is that you want, I can prepare something. So, what do you say?‚Äô

Mike: ‚ÄòOk. I want to slip the pastor opium and then intimidate him with a light and smoke show to learn what happened to the old parson.

I let Mike do as he pleased. Fortunately, the other two PCs used Mike's shopping trip to talk to the young priest themselves and obtain the keys to his deceased colleague's apartment. Since I wanted to reunite the group, I constructed the scene so that Mike saw the other two PCs coming out of the church office and opening a door across the street. They invited him to search the apartment with them, but Mike declined. While the two were going through the old priest's belongings and discovered a clue about catacombs running under the city, Mike prepared his ‚Äòlight and smoke show‚Äô.

Long story short, Mike slipped some opium into the priest's wine, lit incense sticks and blinded him with several rounds of flash powder while pretending to be the devil. The pastor was terrified and hid under his desk. Mike's extensive preparations and masterful intimidation check did not change the fact that the pastor knew absolutely nothing about the circumstances of his predecessor's death or the whereabouts of the archaeologist. Realising that he couldn't get any information out of the priest, Mike broke one of the windows with a chair and jumped from the first floor, drawing a thick cloud of smoke behind him and accompanied by the panicked screams of the pastor. Perhaps this is a good opportunity to mention that it was broad daylight and the church was located in the middle of the city centre, in front of a large square where dozens of people were milling around at the time. The crowd screamed and immediately the whistle of a police patrol sounded, loudly ordering Mike to stop. When I saw the look on Mike's face, I suddenly realised what kind of player I had in front of me. Mike must have pulled off such stunts before, and the fact that he was suddenly dealing with the police was probably the first time he had been confronted with the consequences of his actions.

At the time, there was a festival in town and I decided that he had the chance to hide in a group of costumed people. His roll was a success and he got away. Since this was Mike's first adventure with our group, I didn't want to let him rot in jail for the rest of the session. But I hoped that he would take this as a warning shot. It turned out that my expectations would be disappointed.

The psychiatrist and the detective had since found a city guide who told them that there was access to the catacombs under one of the local breweries. Most of the tunnels were not open to the public, but a small part was accessible. A little unsure of what to do next, Mike wandered through the streets and I decided that he saw the other two PCs waiting at a bus stop to get to the brewery. Mike turned away from them and walked on. At this point, the psychiatrist's player let out an audible sigh. I asked, ‚ÄòAre you sure?‚Äô

Mike thought about it for a moment and then finally decided to approach them. He even offered to drive them to the brewery, since he was the only one in the group who had a car. The rest of the adventure, the group worked together. They talked to the old, demented brewmaster, gained access to the catacombs, wandered through the darkness and finally overpowered a cultist who was waiting for them in an altar room (btw the catacombs are an RL place, but there is not a hidden Shrine to a hungry god down there. At least I hope so). Here the PCs found not only the occult book, but also the archaeologist, who was injured, dehydrated, but still alive and tied up in a corner, ready to give the PCs answers to their questions... in the next session.

After the session, we talked about the adventure as a group. We also talked to Mike, and the two players said that they had only accepted the offer of a ride for meta reasons, because they wanted the adventure to continue as a group. I also explained that it was difficult for me to have to lead two adventures at the same time. We told Mike (and we meant it) that we would like to continue playing with him, but that his character should work to gain the group's trust after he had previously constantly avoided them.



Session 2



The detective player brought a friend for the second session. She played a journalist and received a letter similar to the others before the start. The in-game reason why she couldn't participate in the first adventure was that she simply missed the train. We all assumed that the Trains in Germany in the 1920s were just as shit as they are today.

The adventure more or less started where the last one left off. The PCs took the archaeologist to a hospital. He reported that he had been searching for a long time for a lost temple of an ancient god and had found clues to its location in the occult tome (Of Unspeakable Cults). He asked the PCs to watch the book while he was in the hospital. Mike immediately tried to convince the group to let him watch the book. Since the group had absolutely no reason to trust Mike's character, they declined. Mike tried a persuasion roll on the psychiatrist, but I immediately forbade it. So Mike conceded. For now.

The group went to the hotel, where everyone had their own room, prepaid by the archaeologist. The PCs went to bed, but Mike's character stayed up late. Long after midnight, he left his room and crept to the psychiatrist's door. He picked the lock with a lockpick, rummaged through her stuff, took the book and disappeared again. I made Mike roll the dice with every damn step. When he picked the lock, when he crept through the room, when he rummaged through the suitcase and when he left the room again. Mike made every roll. He went in and out like a shadow. The psychiatrist's player sat there with an annoyed expression on her face the whole time. She started to ask ‚Äòwhy?‚Äô but then stayed in character and held back the question. The journalist's player was visibly confused. Then, instead of going back to his room, he left the hotel and went off in the middle of the night to look for another one. He found a cheap motel, checked in and hid the book behind a radiator. Only then did he went to bed.

The next morning, the PCs minus Mike sat at the breakfast table, explained the events so far to the journalist and planned their next move. Of course, they quickly realised that both Mike and the book had disappeared. Although the players knew what had happened, the PCs suspected that Mike had been kidnapped along with the book, just as the archaeologist had been. They began to discuss how they could free him. I wondered briefly how far the group would go to track down Mike and prepare to rescue him from the clutches of a dangerous cult. I was sure that at least one of the players would see this through to the bitter end. I, however, had had enough. The session had only lasted 20 minutes and I was already forced to improvise a second bullshit adventure because Mike had planned another solo trip. There was no way I was going to let the PCs go on a mini adventure when their players actually knew it was going to be a wild goose chase. So I asked Mike, now in a decidedly harsher tone than in the last session: ‚ÄòWhy are you doing this after all the conversations we've had before?‚Äô

He tried to play dumb at first, but I kept badgering him until he finally uttered the wonderful sentence, ‚ÄòThat's what my character would do!‚Äô

I said ‚Äògreat! There's a super easy solution for that!‚Äô

Mike: ‚ÄúWhat's that?‚Äô

Me: ‚ÄùCan't you just play a character who acts less like a selfish asshole and who is interested in working with the rest of the group?‚Äô

Mike: ‚ÄúWell... I guess so.‚Äô

Me: ‚ÄùGreat! We don't even have to change your character sheet for that. So let's go.‚Äô

Mike's character went to the hotel, where he arrived at the breakfast table just in time and told the characters a wild story of cultists who had entered the hotel at night and stolen the book. He had chased them down, killed them and brought the book back safely. I let him have it.

The rest of the adventure went by with (almost) no further escapades on Mike's part. But of course he tried to make off with the book one more time, to which I simply responded with a brief ‚Äòno.‚Äô

At the end of the session, when everyone had left and I was home alone again, I thought long and hard about the last two adventures. At this point in my roleplaying ‚Äòcareer,‚Äô I had reached a point where my tolerance for problem players was very low. I had already had to deal with all sorts of thatguyisms. I had a creep at the table who just didn't realise that the female players were disgusted by him rather than charmed by his advances. I had several players who were up to two hours late without giving notice. I had players who, even after three years, still didn't have their own rule book and even after all this time still had to ask how to make a simple attack roll. Apart from IRL violence, I've seen just about every kind of nonsense a DM can endure. As a result, I often planned and ran the campaigns out of a twisted sense of duty, rather than because I really enjoyed it. Every time I picked up the pen to work out an NPC or draw a dungeon, I wanted to puke because the only thought in my head was what kind of crap THAT GUY would pull this time. And I'd finally had enough.

The next day, I discussed the situation with the other players, and we all agreed that Mike's BS was going too far and there was no comming back. So I took my phone and sent Mike a voice mail explaining that he was no longer invited to the next session. The reason for this is his constant solo escapades, in which he doesn't seem to give a shit whether the other players are having fun or not. Also, he doesn't seem to be able to get rid of that stupid player-vs-DM mentality.

And that took care of the problem. The journalist fit in wonderfully with the group and we had a year-long campaign that took the PCs from Germany to Austria, from there to Cairo, to the City Without a Name and back to Germany, from where they flew on an airship through a portal to the Otherworld and punched the BBEG in the face with an umbrella.

Dear Mike (which isn't really your name), should you read this: I think you're a great guy. When I had coffee with you, I got really good vibes from you and you definitely put a lot of heart into creating your characters. That's wonderful! But I hope that in the time that has passed since our game, you have learned that you are not the only player in an RPG session and that the other people in the game also want a moment in the spotlight and to enjoy their time at the table.

Wherever you are now, I hope you have found a group where you can have fun and bring just as much fun to your fellow players.

Sorry for the long post or any mistakes I make, as English is not my first language. This is an ethical problem I really do struggle with that seems to cast a shadow on all my interactions with my friend. I felt that this community might offer some much needed commentary. I (34F) divorced my ex husband four years ago (I think my divorce plays a role here, will explain onwards). I have a friend (35 F), let's call her Aly, from college, whom I've been close to for good over 10 years now. She's been my maid of honnor and we've frequently visited each other's homes, went to various events, adventures etc. I must say that I used to travel a lot for work and stayed overseas for a few months at a time, which naturally filtered out majority of my closer people, who were not family. So Aly was one of the very few that stuck by me through years and always genuinely missed me and loved me (same as I her). 
Well, Aly is married to guy, who was our professor at the uni (let's call him Nick). Their relationship started at the time we were studying and organically progressed into a family. They now have 2 wonderful boys together. Nick is much older than us (nearly 50 now) and was a beloved important figure during our student years and afterwards - as part of my circle as well. He'd always been very friendly and happy with me, our friend group and every time they came over to my house. With that said - he'd alway show his affection in both words and hugs etc. without hiding it from anyone. So I lived with an understanding that this is how he is. Worth mentioning that during our uni years Nick and his colleagues always joked around about beautiful girl students and how wonderful it was working in an environment surrounded by all of us (me and Aly were on the receiving end of that talk as well). I must add that I had never looked at him or any of our professors in that way, and actually met my ex (also stufent at that time) in uni also. So we were all one big happy group of people. 
Fast forward to a few years back. After my divorce, I had taken one trip to the uni to deliver a very specific collection of stones that I no longer wanted to keep, and wanted to gift to my faculty to use (geology). I arrived there, delivered the box and was about to depart, when Nick invited me for a quick coffee at the university caffetteria. I saw this as absolutely normal and happily accepted, after all what's a 15 minute coffee break with a friend. We sat down and he immediately procceded to move closer and started hitting on me. At first I thought it to be his usual joking self messing around for old time's sake. And I laughed it off. He then began speaking in a more pushy and serious way, which made me largely uncomfortable. I think now that maybe he felt emboldened by me being ""available"" because of being divorced. I cut the encounter short and said I had to leave for my next errand. He walked me off, smiling as usual and that was the end of it. I went on completely confident that it was all a joke and forgot about it. I haven't seen Nick after that for a few months until I was invited to Aly's and his baby gender reveal party. At that party his behavioir was 180¬∞ opposite of his usual friendly self, barely acknowledging my presence and treating me as a complete stranger. I thought it odd, but didn't think much about it. After all I was there for Aly and celebration of their child. After that encounter I started noticing that I was never invited yo their home anymore, although Aly and I frequently met elsewhere and at my house. I also noticed some form of disconnect from them as a family, even though I always cared for them, especially children and carried special gifts for them, that weren't just any souvenir (like specific materials and finds for their kid, who was now growing a collection of stones himself (some passion we all share due to professional exposure). In any case, these occurences got me thinking (or posssibly overthinking?) that that one encounter at the uni was more than a joke. Aly never said anything to me and never changed her behaviour besides not having me in her house. I am guessing that maybe some sort of conversation occured between them? And I also lately have been thinking a lot about whether is was wrong of me not to tell her of what happened. But at the end of the day, my line of thinking is that nothing actually happened between Nick and I, and I definitely wouldn't want to stirr up trouble where there may be none. Besides, having a family and 2 children with a guy, I wouldn't want my friend to think about choosing our friendship over Nick, and I am sure she wouldn't. After all, they are a family. And at the same time, what if they did have some sort of convo and I don't know if he may have told her something that would make her think badly of me? I am a little unsure if I should open my mouth or just forget it and go on about my friendship as it is, because I do care about Aly greately and wouldn't want to lose a friendship that lasted so long. So, am I the a'hole for not saying anything to her? ",2,1734290811.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,1.0,False

Fast forward to last year, he hired a junior employee, a young woman around 27-28. Apparently, they met at a lounge outside of work, he called her for an interview, and she got hired.

(By the way, his son is about her age and works in a different country.)

Somehow, this story leaked to the management. This junior employee even shared some details with me earlier, so I know it‚Äôs true‚ÄîI‚Äôve seen the messages where he‚Äôs asking her to meet. But when the management called her in to address it, she flipped the story and said I‚Äôm the one who instigated her to spread rumors and that none of it is true.

Now, the management wants to meet with me to discuss this. Meanwhile, this junior employee‚Äîwho was pretty close to me‚Äîhas blocked me everywhere and thrown me under the bus to save herself. She‚Äôs somehow managed to clear her name with management and has left me to deal with all this alone.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I know I should tell the truth, but I‚Äôm dealing with so much in life right now, and this feels like unnecessary drama I don‚Äôt need. Should I even talk to the management about it? Or should I just try to stay out of it and let it pass? I feel so betrayed and stuck. Please help a sister out. Am I wrong here ?

After coffee this other friend who had a car was driving off home by himself and so we were discussing that we two (me and her) will take a cab to go back home. She lives a bit far from my place so I said we will take separate cabs (read my PS to know why). 

Although this common friend initially told her to drop me, I said no it'll not be practical. She seemed to agree.

Anyway then me and her were walking searching for cabs. I hailed a cab for her and opened the backseat door. She sat inside the backseat to the far end (road side) and then asked me ""can I drop you somewhere?"" 

In the split second I said yes (even though I had planned to take another cab), but I sat in the front seat beside the driver ! We had a lot of bags with us so I instinctively sat in the front seat (my logical brain kicking in) and kept the bags on the back seat! But I soon realized I had fucked up and should have sat behind, or atleast she wouldn't mind me sitting in the back. The conversation after that was pretty awkward! I don't know if I can recover from this!

1hezwir,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hellenism/comments/1hezwir/a_story_about_birds_of_ares/,A story about birds (of Ares),"Hi :) It's my first post here, but I was lurking in this reddit already for some time, enjoying reading mainly about personal experiences. I would like to share some of my own, maybe you will find them inspiring? This will be a long post, though. :) Have a cup of tea/coffee and I hope you will enjoy.

I live in Poland and I've been interested in the gods and Hellenism for 3 years or so. However, my adventure with the unknown started a long time before. I think I felt ""something"" for the first time when I visited Te Hua Temple in Amsterdam and made my first real incense offering to Avalokitesvara. I prayed/asked to help me see the truth. I felt... a tingling sensation, started from my head and travelling down my body. And then, a feeling of peace... I knew that somehow I've been heard. I didn't expect to feel anything and it really made me wonder.

Later, I don't know exactly how or when (I cannot pin-point the exact moment), I started to be interested in Hellenism and Greek philosophy (Stoicism, Platonism, etc). I took a particular interest in Ares and Athena, but I was a bit worried. They are the gods of war, right? :) I was a bit afraid (that's why I wasn't reaching out) but also I felt awe and respect for their power. Because of my interest, there were ""synchronicities"" here and there, like dreams about snakes and woodpeckers, or like when I was driving my way home, stuck in the traffic, and just trying to remember Homeric hymn to Ares - I looked outside and saw a license plate with 4RE5 on it. Funny how the mind works, right? :)

But then, I gathered my courage and decided to say my first prayer to Ares. I don't remember exactly how it went, but I said something along the lines that I am very inspired by him and I was sorry for my ignorance and lack of knowledge, but could you please give me a sign like an adult gives a lollipop to a shy child? :D I asked for a sign in a form of a barn owl.

Well, barn owls started to pop out everywhere I looked. In my twitter feeds, in the movie that was playing and I just happened to watch, also in my friend's house (they had a painting of a barn owl). With internet appearances, I was a bit sceptical - I was researching Ares in the internet so algorithms could pick it up. But then, after some time, I visited Greece for my vacations, and I thought/prayed to Ares: ""How about a barn own in real life?"" This is Greece, the land where he was worshipped, maybe his power was the greatest there? A week has passed and no owl was flying by. I was a bit embarrased and felt ridiculous for asking for it, after all Ares has surely better things to do than send me an owl. But just when I was going back to the bus at 5:00 am in the morning, going back home, believe me or not - I saw a barn own which was just flying to the hotel's roof. A real barn owl. That really did something to me.

But you know, after a while, being the ever sceptical person I am, when I was remembering this situation while meditating about Ares, I just thought jokingly: ""OK, that was an owl in its natural habitat, at night. But how about birds outside their habitat? We don't really have vultures in Poland. Well, if a vulture just sat on my balcony, that would be something spectacular"".

A few months passed by...

And then... I watched the news as usually and was literally floored when there was a newsflash about a bearded vulture spotted and caught in my city. We don't have vultures... they are super, super rare. And this vulture just flew straight to the city where I live. It's good it didn't land on my balcony, I would really, really freak out, haha :)

Here are some articles about it:

There were other things, feelings, synchronicities and so on, but I think this story is probably the most spectacular so far and I wanted to share it.

I love this man and want a future with him, but sometimes I feel like he enjoys irritating me and it‚Äôs driving me crazy.

A few examples:

He does this ear splitting whistle at random. This whistle isn‚Äôt pleasant, and I‚Äôve told him for many years I hate it. He still consistently does it.

He loves to ‚Äúfuck with me‚Äù as I‚Äôd put it. Say I tell him I‚Äôm going to have an ice cream sandwich to him, he says ‚Äúoh there‚Äôs none left, I ate the last one.‚Äù I‚Äôm then bummed but say ok; he then tells me there is still some left. He does this one A LOT and I don‚Äôt find it funny, and have told him as much, but he still does it. I just don‚Äôt even understand WHY do this so constantly. 

He acts inept about things he absolutely should know how to do. I got him a pod coffee machine as a gift. I‚Äôve shown him how to use it several times, he still asks how to use it. If I don‚Äôt show him or just make the coffee he gets sad (he gets mopey when he‚Äôs upset at me). This isn‚Äôt a complicated machine, it quite literally has ONE button. 

I could go on about these things, but I‚Äôm genuinely worried this is going to ruin our relationship. I feel like I‚Äôm an irritated with him so often because of him intentionally bothering me. I‚Äôve tried talking to him about this, but his response is always ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt trying to annoy you!‚Äù And we get nowhere. 

Any advice on how to get through to him would be really helpful. I know I‚Äôm at fault in this too, because I‚Äôve developed a pretty short fuse at this point, but I feel so unheard I don‚Äôt know how to change it.

I don't have kids, but basically same idea.  I love the idea of taking them in a little domed backpack over to Floof and Dexter's house to hang out.  But I have no idea if it would work. 

They'd all have to be fixed and vaxxed.  They'd have to be super-secure (all outside doors closed, window screens unavailable, basement closed, etc.)   If they started tusslin', we'd separate em, or if it got bad enough, end the date.  And yes, tons of Churus and whatnot to lubricate the process.

I just think they get bored and a playdate might be awesome.  They can explore a new house, their friend can explore your house.  And you get to stand there with another human and drink coffee/beers and observe and giggle.

I¬¥ve recently purchased the Sage Bambino & the grinder pro.

Interestingly, I can¬¥t dial them in what so ever: flow is way too fast, together with a very large yield (\~1:3/1:4), even in the finest (!) grind setting(1) or when using a really high dose (up to 10 gr for a single or 22gr for a double shot, which barely fit into the portafilter). Even tried the double walled basket, just for the sake of it - same same. 

I don¬¥t care too much about meters if the coffee turns out well, but the shots are just really bad - very sour, very thin, no body. 

I should mention that I¬¥ve been working as a barista for 10 years in the past and worked with various machines, so I¬¥d say I definitely feel confident when approaching espresso machines. This is why it is so frustrating for me. 

I¬¥m using the portafilters, (single wall) baskets & tamper delivered with the bambino. Beans are of course fresh from a local roastery, from which I buy for several years now (used to brew moka pot/french press)



Any ideas? 

(the only clue I¬¥ve got is that the shot seems to go out more from one hole of the portafilter than the other (rather the left). Of course I¬¥ve made sure the surface is leveled and that I¬¥m tampering evenly. This phenomenon occurs in both the single & the double shot) 



By the way, did anyone else have the problem that when running an empty shot (portafiler is empty), quite some water still stays in the basket?

I recently met a girl at work that inmediatly caught my attention. We have been talking for a couple of weeks (very informally, going for a coffee, or amongst colleagues) and I finally invited her for dinner this week.

She inmediatly agreed (as in she didn¬¥t even check her calendar or anything, she said ""sure, reach out""). I added her on facebook and we agreed to have dinner. We barely spoke on facebook aside agreing were to go and at what time.

2 Hours before dinner, she texted me that a friend was leaving for christmas and that she wanted to have some drinks with her, that if it was okay for me that her friend joined after dinner, I replied I had no problem (I was not sure if saying ""No, I want to go with you"" was too direct, so I tried to keep it chill?).

We had awesome dinner, we laughed a lot and talk, no uncomfortable silences, she asked me about stuff, we had a lot in common and in general I¬¥d say dinner was okay. Then her friend arrived to the restaurant and we have a couple of beers there. Of course I was still part of the conversation, but it was impossible to keep up with them as they of course talk about stuff from their friends groups, etc. The girl I invited for dinner was always trying to keep me in the loop, but the friend was a bit annoying, excluding me, etc.

We then went to a bar, got a couple of beers and some shots and then decided to go. The talk in the bar was similar to the restaurant as in they were talking and including me, but nothing compared to when the 2 of us were alone.

Some additional information: I¬¥m 30 so I¬¥m looking for something serious, I would prefer to avoid any casual relationships as those get me distracted and I¬¥d really like to settle in a relationship.

My questions are: 

1.- Is her inviting a friend a sign of not being super interested in me as something more than a friend?

2.- Should I invite her again and be more direct? Something in the lines of ""I had an awesome time last week, I¬¥d love to invite you on a date""

3.- Should I just go straight to her (We are 30 and 32) and tell her I like her and would like to step up and ask her for a date?

Any advice is strongly appreciated it.

When we started our relationship you know everything was rainbows and sunshine. Then the sunglasses came off and colors started to show. Well I found my boyfriend being weird with his for like a week. What I mean by weird is even the smallest thing he doing like brushing his teeth and making morning coffee his phone would be glue to him. So I said okay this is enough one night when he was sleeping I found he was talking to two different girls. Girl number one was someone who he meet a work as a bystander. Someone you meet once‚Äôs and never see again after. I‚Äôm not going to lie to you guys girl number one broke me. The way they were talking was like you so sexy, I hope I get to see you soon, I really want you to be a sneak link to me. And mind you I confronted him about it. And I said if you wanted to explore your opinions why couldn‚Äôt you come to me as a man and tell me. I would have cried for awhile then learn how to grow from it. It was so bad for my mental health. I end up finding this girls Facebook and instagram everything under the sun. And I compared myself to her. So hard that I felt like the smallest person in the world and sometimes I still do. I was crying every day and having bad anxiety attacks up to the point I will send most of the night just throwing up anything that my body could take. That story ended when he was working and he told he stop talking to her completely and deleted her number but ever since then there been this wall around us. Now he come girl number 2. I guess he like the prays he was getting from girl one and like the rushs he was getting from maybe getting caught. But the man started acting the same way from girl one üòê. Phone locked on hand and acting really weird. So I said let me grab the phone and investigate. Hold and be hold he found a new one except this one is a supervisor. And this one he claimed it was a mistake and that he was sorry but this one I can‚Äôt really blocked because if she the supervisor for his station that day he need a way to be able to talk to her.

With time and patience we started getting back to normal but there are days that my stomach start to turn so badly. But here is where I need you guys to come in. Yesterday we did a family activity and I was looking in his pictures and I see he screenshots a message with an unsaved number. The message were from October.

What do I do take down the number start on WhatsApp to see the profile picture. And it‚Äôs girl number fucking 2 the supervisor. Now my thing is I‚Äôm getting they haven‚Äôt talk since October but why screenshot the text between the two and save it in the photos. Before you guys as I went in the contact list I checked if he re saved it. Nothing. So what is the point of doing all of that if they haven‚Äôt started re fully talking again.

They like going on walking/hiking vacations in Europe each summer. They ski some winters but I'm not sure if they got a pass this year.

It‚Äôs about a person whom I talked to for few months (I know it‚Äôs not right) and I thought I have found the one. He is praying, doing umrah every year and actively looking to get married.

A month ago he got very busy (he immediately got a new job after he got back from umrah, guess his duas are being accepted) and he started to distance himself.

He deactivated socials, but I did try to reach out few times (we have each other numbers), but he would just like my message and I backed off and that was it.

I understand this is the decision of Allah and I accept it.

He is also wealthy, successful man, so he has a lot of options, he can have most beautiful women if he wants and they are throwing themself onto him, so I also understand he will not reach out to me (hijab wearing, not extraordinary beauty) and I also accept that. 

BUT - as you may think, I cannot stop thinking about him. 

I started no contact and I prayed istikhara multiple times to Allah to remove the feelings, but 1 month later, I am in the same place. 

I really, really thought he is the one, but now I am in a position where I am asking myself - What can I ask Allah to help me?

To increase prayers to forget it, another istikhara - but what can I ask Allah since I don‚Äôt have a decision?

Thank you sisters ‚ô•Ô∏è

**EDIT** Last week I asked Allah for a sign and ability to see it as a sign when it comes and I was thinking I will see a white cat, someone will tell me something but nothing happened. 

Later that day I got a coffee with one friend and she was talking about her friend who recently got married. I asked how did they meet (like you would usually ask) and she said through instagram, nothing special.

She continued to speak and said - But guess what was interesting, he (the groom) once disappeared for 3 months(went to another country) because of work and she (the bride) lost all hopes although she liked him very much.

3 months later he reached out and they married within 6 months.

That was the moment I was left with open mouth because I thought ‚Äúthis is the sign‚Äù and I thought ‚Äúbe patient, do not rush‚Äù.



Sooo, this is what‚Äôs holding my hope. 


I have nothing from him, not a word, but I want to move on if he is not the one.

I think the problem might be a long brew time. Here‚Äôs how I tried preparing it today:

Hario Switch V2 (straight pourover open switch), hario filters
200 degree water
16g coffee 21 clicks commandante
50g water bloom
up to 130g pour w some agitation at 0:45
up to 200g slow pour at 1:25
up to 270g pour at 2:10 (roaster suggests 1:17 ratio for this coffee)

The water doesn‚Äôt finish draining from the last pour until almost 6minutes so it seems like the filter is clogged. Not sure what I should try adjusting - I guess I could coarsen the grind more but this seems pretty coarse to me already? This is my first time brewing an Ethiopian coffee - I‚Äôve mostly tried Columbia‚Äôs before.

Now, for last few weeks at least he's been packing her bag for the day, I empty it at night. That's the routine that's been in place. 

Today, I go about my business, I'm in my office working and he bursts into the room miming shit I can't work out, I gesture for him to text instead. 

First he wasn't sure if he took his pill this morning, I told him that he hadn't. 

Then he comes back a few minutes later, upset because the baby's lunch hasn't been packed. 

Comes back again another few minutes later and angrily throws a strainer full of potatoe peels into the room and text bitches that they're ruined and he can't use them to bake anymore like he wanted to. 

Can't find his wallet. 

Just thing after thing that's somehow my fault because I didn't tell him that I wasn't doing/looking for/found whatever it was in that moment. 

I'm working! I'm taking calls! If you'd start getting ready to leave more than 2 minutes before you're supposed to be out the door you would have any of these issues.

If you asked me if I had done any of those things, I would have told you it wasn't done and it wouldn't have been issue. 

Why exactly is it my responsibility to either do everything or expressly say hey, I'm not doing xyz?? 

He had all morning (8am to 1pm) to get ready and get things together, he chooses to not do a thing until like 1250 and then gets mad that things aren't already pre-done or layed out for him, as if he's not a whole adult.",17,1734288201.0,breakingmom,1,1.0,False

ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°

Many Wall Street bankers use Adderall and Vyvanse as tools to plow through long hours of tedious work amid high-pressure competition.

[https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/young-banker-finance-adhd-medication-adderall-d578a16f](https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/young-banker-finance-adhd-medication-adderall-d578a16f)

As Mark Moran was facing another 90-hour week as an investment-banking intern at Credit Suisse in New York, he knew he needed help to survive the rest of the summer. His colleagues gave him a tip: Visit a Wall Street health clinic and tell the staff he had trouble focusing.

Ahead of his first appointment, he filled out a five-minute questionnaire. One of the questions asked if he had trouble staying organized, another, if he procrastinated. He then met with a clinician who said his answers suggested he had attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. He left with a prescription for Adderall.

No matter that a family member, a psychologist, didn‚Äôt think Moran had ADHD. He found that when he took Adderall, he could keep working for hours, and was able to actually be interested in some of the mundane tasks required of a young investment banker, such as aligning corporate logos on a PowerPoint or formatting cells in Microsoft Excel. 

He also wanted to show his bosses he was a hard worker and eventually secure a lucrative full-time job offer after finishing graduate school.

‚ÄúThey gave me a script, and within months, I was hooked,‚Äù said Moran, now 33 years old and running his own investor-relations firm. He‚Äôs also a provocative personality on social media, commenting on finance, politics and culture, including prescription drug use. ‚ÄúYou become dependent on it to work.‚Äù

Images of Wall Street‚Äôs rank-and-file blowing cash on illegal drugs and nightlife are well known, with cocaine a favored drug through the 1980s, as portrayed in ‚ÄúThe Wolf of Wall Street.‚Äù 

These days, drugs are more a tool to optimize performance on the job. Especially for entry-level bankers at the analyst and associate level‚Äîwho work long, tedious hours and fiercely compete for higher-level jobs with big pay days‚Äîprescriptions for stimulants such as Adderall and other ADHD drugs have become commonplace.  

Jonah Frey, who worked as an investment banker in healthcare for Wells Fargo in San Francisco, said one colleague would sometimes snort lines of crushed up Adderall pills from his desk in the bullpen‚Äîthe common area where junior bankers sit and work together. ‚ÄúNobody blinked an eye,‚Äù he said.

Others use nicotine pouches such as Zyn to excess, or consume energy drinks. One banker who worked in Houston between 2017 and 2019 described his colleagues drinking ‚ÄúMonsterbombs‚Äù‚Äîan extra-strength 5-hour Energy shot dropped into a glass filled with Monster Energy, chugged in one go. The caffeine payload was the equivalent of nearly five cups of coffee at once.

The feeling that the jobs can‚Äôt be done without stimulants comes as Wall Street is under fire for pushing junior bankers to take on dangerous workloads.

This is something that I had since I was a kid and sometimes, depending if I'm stressed or if I had drunk too much, I might wake up more times during the night, but on average its once per night, after 3-4 hours falling asleep, pretty much eveyday (its pretty rare that I'm gonna sleep 6 or more hours without waking up).

I know that many people here may have way worse sumptoms than me, but my symptoms, although not extreme, have affect me a lot since falling asleep has always been a bit difficult for me due to anxiety and this makes things worse.

My body has completely given out. I can‚Äôt sleep, I get maybe 4 total hours of sleep a night. I‚Äôm barely eating. No matter what I eat, however mild, unless I have a lucky break in the pattern, I feel like I can‚Äôt take food in at all. I haven‚Äôt eaten a single actual meal in a week. I just stopped eating breakfast and packing lunches for myself. I have gone 24-hour periods without eating anything. I haven‚Äôt exercised in way too long. I keep getting stress migraines, and they are long, intense, and painful.  
  
I can‚Äôt really even drink as a coping mechanism anymore because my stomach is a mess. It doesn‚Äôt douse my worries, I just get into a more sour mindset and hate myself for drinking in the first place. I‚Äôm constantly nauseous and having reflux. I‚Äôm taking my prescription nausea med and Emetrol daily. I can‚Äôt drink much coffee anymore either, it just makes things worse. I haven‚Äôt been taking even my multivitamins at night because I get sick on them. I only take my meds in the morning now. Between not eating and not taking the supplements I‚Äôve been directed to, I‚Äôm not getting enough real nutrients at all. I have lost about 10 pounds in the last month and a half.

I keep getting infections that I can‚Äôt fight off. Literally, I got a sinus and double eye infection over the last few weeks and cannot bounce back. ‚ÄúAllergies‚Äù have been a problem too‚Äîmore likely actual infections that I just chose to discount and tough out. Rest to me at this point is just sitting and having my mind completely exit my body while all time disappears, which obviously isn‚Äôt that restful. Getting myself to do basic hygiene tasks is way harder than normal. My weeks have been passing by me. My memory is shot. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. I can‚Äôt remember people‚Äôs last sentences and recalling past memories is so much harder. I‚Äôm always in a dissociated daze half the time and entirely too aware of what‚Äôs happening around me the other.

I‚Äôm more afraid of people than usual. I‚Äôm just constantly afraid of harsh judgment and getting in trouble. My fear of failure always feels like it‚Äôs up to the max. I keep negatively splitting on everyone and everything. I can‚Äôt get control over the splitting because I‚Äôm so dysregulated that I really have no capacity to check facts. I was unable to cry for weeks. Now I can‚Äôt stop, I just keep breaking down every so and so multiple times a day.

*But I show up to work and class.* And my work products are generally still good, but I‚Äôm starting to falter. I know that. I‚Äôm spacing out when I don‚Äôt want to be. The people and things that were fulfilling just feel like nothing. Somehow, the world still feels like it‚Äôs going to end and I haven‚Äôt shaken off the delusion that I haven‚Äôt done enough to make it better.

My husband has been calling me out on this. He knows before I do when I‚Äôm not okay. There were times he instructed me to stay home because I would have unwisely gone to work or class if he hadn‚Äôt said something. He has figured out if I‚Äôm emotionally wrestling with something before I‚Äôm aware of it. He is really worried about me. So not only am I basically decaying as I write this, I‚Äôm hurting him and stressing him out at the same time.

One of my dear friends passed away about two weeks ago. He had similar traits. He died doing the same thing for decades. When I got the call he passed, I was mad at him for the way he refused to take care of himself. I was mad at him for resisting help and for saying his wife was nagging him about it (it being his life and limb). Dude miraculously survived a massive heart attack three years ago. He was kept alive by a battery, mountains of pills, regular injections‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. His wife carried what looked like an entire hospital with them wherever they went.  
  
He did not stop drinking or smoking. He did not eat or sleep right. He was meaner, too. Less receptive, more arrogant, and more disrespectful. He was always working on something, whether it was his business, personal projects, activism, whatever. He acted recklessly and ran at full speed, nonstop, literally until he was septic and couldn‚Äôt leave his hospice bed. He has been with his wife for about 15 years total, but caved last summer and finally got married. I watched his widow carry his urn up the same aisle they walked on getting married. It was gut-wrenching. It was beautiful but cruel.

But how angry can I be with him really? I share a lot of that in common. I‚Äôm resistant to help. I don‚Äôt want to slow down or stop. I don‚Äôt like people telling me what to do. I don‚Äôt want to stop self-destructing, working too much, and drinking. It drowns out the noise and makes me feel like I‚Äôm tolerable company. I don‚Äôt want to stop being constantly busy. Being busy means I‚Äôm working hard and earning my keep, my sense of self. Accomplishing things means I get to maintain relationships with people and status in the places I want to be in. I like running on adrenaline, no sleep, no food, nothing. I have always pushed myself to max capacity, why stop now?

I also don‚Äôt want to be like any of the above. Problem is, I am like that. It‚Äôs not enough to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be like that.‚Äù I \*am\* that.  
  
When my husband tells me he worries about me, I get dismissive or tell him there‚Äôs nothing to worry about. If he keeps worrying or actually holds me to account on something, I get upset. I hate having people worry about me. It feels invasive. But I also hate people not feeling worry, because then I feel lonely. I think I hate having people hold me accountable because it means I slipped up. I wasn‚Äôt in total control over what happens around me and what people think of me.

I am well down a path that could lead to me becoming like my late friend in the worst way. I don‚Äôt want to repeat that cycle. I don‚Äôt want my husband to have to deal with my premature death because of my self-destructive choices.

1hez3tr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hez3tr/i_feel_like_im_about_to_break/,I feel like I'm about to break.,"I want to start by saying that this post is probably going to be very scattered. If it's hard to read/follow, I apologize. I just have a lot that I need to get off my chest and no one to talk to about it. I'm aware that my grammar is not perfect. 

I feel like shit. The main source of my stress is divorce. After 8 years together and 5 years married, My wife (26F) and I (30M) have decided to call it quits. We share an amazing son who is 2 years old. We both love him dearly and we're trying to make this transition as smooth as possible for him. He is absolutely the priority in all of this. 

If anyone that reads this has ever been through this, you know how tough this can be. There are so many factors involved. Obviously the fact that we have a child, family on both sides, living situations, finances etc.

I'm so drained. I can't think of another time that I've felt so low in my life. And I think part of that is dealing with the reality and numerous circumstances that have led us to this decision. 

I think what weighs on me the most at this moment is the history of our relationship in general. 6 years ago things started to get a bit rough and we broke up for a couple of days. She was in a long relationship prior to us getting together and felt that she didn't know what it felt like to be alone. To be independent. Ok. Three days go by and she had an interaction with someone that made her realize she was making a mistake. She asked to come back. I said ok. We tried to put our differences aside and get back to a place of feeling really good about each other. And then in an attempt to show her commitment, she suggested that we should get married. This was maybe two weeks after we had split. When she brought it up I just laughed and asked if she was kidding. She said she was serious. I had to think for a couple of days, but I ended up deciding that I really did love her the way she was and I was willing to move past what had happened in the past. We got married two months later. 

From the beginning of our marriage I could tell something was off. She insisted that during the course of our marriage she could never get through to me emotionally and most of her attempts to feel really connected to me were in vain. I agree with that sentiment. There's just one problem. The reason I could never give my all to her was that I could always sense that she had one foot out of our relationship. She was never all in. Even after asking me to marry her. And after a recent conversation, she confirmed that this was true. We got married 5 years ago, and the last time we were in love was 6 years go. Imagine spending your entire marriage trying to give your all to someone and you were never in love. How sad is that? She always seeked outside validation from other men whether it was via likes on social media or people paying attention to her in person. She was overly affectionate with other people and it always made me uncomfortable. And that led me to always feeling withdrawn.

One thing I always struggled with was public perception of my wife and I. I'm sure you all know what I mean. People pay attention to whether or not people are happy in their marriages and I just wanted to be able to portray that image. All I ever wanted to do was be solid. And I always held on to the hope of us being truly happy together. I wasn't a cheater. Always loyal. To the point that my interactions with all other females were straightforward as I just wanted to respect my wife. For example, If I was getting a coffee and the barista was attractive and especially flirty, I would keep my responses short and disengage in conversation. I always went out of my way to show respect to my wife, even when she wasn't around. This was not the case for her. 

Another thing that is relevant to this conversation is finances. We've never really been well off. We've lived together since shortly after we first got together. For 8 years. Always split rent. And especially after having our son, it seems like we've just been barely keeping our heads above water. Neither of us have savings. It's been paycheck to paycheck for as long as I can remember. For the both of us.

So here I am. 10 days until Christmas. Supposed to be a happy time of year where you reflect on what you're grateful for. Instead, I'm trying to find another place to live. Which is a hell of it's own when you don't have savings. Don't have much of a family to fall back on for financial support. And I'm watching our family slowly fall apart. The reality is definitely hitting of no more waking up in the mornings and kissing my son goodbye before I head to work. No more moments of feeling that fire between my wife and I. Even if it wasn't often, feeling that support and connection with someone you love is so nice. Leaving my wife, son, and two dogs behind as I search for a one bedroom apartment. 

Lastly, and what really hurts, is the fact that we still love eachother. We've expressed this sentiment multiple times since deciding to call it quits. We still have great chemistry and we're still very attracted to eachother. Things are civil between us. I wouldn't call it an ugly separation by any means. We talk about co-parenting and how we will always have love for each other. As if that will make things hurt less. But Teddy Swims said it best. ""A Band-Aid on a bullet hole doesn't help. Gonna hurt like hell."" And for some reason, we're giving up. There is so much more to say but I don't have the time or drive to express it all. 

I'm just sad.

So after a few weeks of going to Starbucks, I was in there as she came in for work, and she stood in line with me and we chatted about a book she recommended. After I got my coffee we stood off the side. She began listing other books that were good on a list she had on her phone.

She uses washed flour, but I started with vital wheat gluten, and added chickpea flour. Here's my ratio:

300 grams vwg

100 grams chickpea flour

I wanted relatively light seasoning for versatility, so I went with about 2oz nutritional yeast, flavacol/butter flavored salt, kosher salt, pepper, msg.

Liquids, I took a can of beets and poured the juice in a cup, then added about 1 cup of hot water, a spoonful of beefless bouillon, 1tsp molasses, 1-2tsp red wine vinegar, stir to combine and added this liquid to the dry mixture until it formed a non-sticky dough, I was able to handle the dough without much sticking to my hands. I had about 3/4 cup of liquid left over, and I saved that for the simmering liquid.

I folded the dough a few times, until it got super firm, split it into two pieces then let it rest while I got the liquid ready. For the simmering liquid, I used the remaining seasoning liquid, a big pinch of salt and \*gasp* instant coffee granules for a dark color, I used about 3-4 tablespoons for a big crockpot of water.

Back to the dough, I folded the two pieces again until it got stiff, EDIT: NOW I ALSO SAUTEED THE TWO PIECES IN OIL TO GET A DARK BROWN COLOR ALL AROUND, I FORGOT TO ADD THIS,  then wrapped the separate pieces in parchment paper, double wrapped, then wrapped that in aluminum foil. I don't do braiding because I'm rarely seeking shredded textures, I mainly just work with slices. 

Plonked those pieces in my simmering broth on low and the recipe calls for simmering for 24 HOURS. I simmered mine for 20 hours, couldn't make it the whole 24 lol.

They came out of the liquid relatively soft but *quickly* firmed up. I let mine cool for about 60-90 minutes before it's trip to the fridge, and it was already well firm, as firm as a piece of meat. 

It's been 8 hours  in the fridge, and I just sliced into it and tried a piece. **Yall**, this seitan would make *perfect* deli slices. It's so firm, it was a workout to cut slices (probably due to a dull knife), but the texture is so perfect, firm and meaty and not the least bit rubbery, it's literally perfect. It's miles better than the store bought deli seitan slices, no icky smell or flavor from the preservatives, the taste of gluten is nearly gone, even with my minimal seasonings. 

This is my go-to for seitan steak from now on. I think the most crucial parts are slow cooking for 1 whole day or close to it for the best texture, adding enough acidic ingredients to cut the gluten flavor down without being overpowering, and adding beet juice gave it a more appealing color.",15,1734287777.0,Veganivore,2,0.95,False

We had brief conversations, and then I deleted the app. He later randomly reached out on Instagram, telling me about a fake profile of mine that he came across, I thanked him and he then asked if I‚Äôd want to be friends. 

I agreed, and I discovered that he frequently visited a market walking distance from home where my gym is too and we had a conversation about it.
3 days later, I ran into him unexpectedly while coming out of my gym, and after a brief coffee, he offered to walk me home, which i reluctantly accepted coz he kept pushing and I was too awkward to say no (not a good idea to  let strangers know your address btw)

Over the next several days, he showed up uninvited and unannounced mere ghar ke neeche every night, asking to go to my rooftop to spend time but I declined because what??His behavior escalated with him bombarding me with texts and calls if I didn‚Äôt respond immediately. He constantly accused me of ghosting him when I took longer than literally 30 minutes to reply to his messages. After an incident where he showed up at my house while I actually wasn‚Äôt at home, made a ruckus in front of my neighbours and and left very rude explicit messages on my phone, I made it firmly but politely clear that I wanted to maintain boundaries and I do not want to remain in touch with him. 
He tried to apologise and said he just wanted a relationship with me.

Keep in mind I‚Äôd only known him a total of 3 weeks at this point.  I didn‚Äôt try to lead him on in any capacity and I explicitly mentioned that im just looking for friends ( it was cleary mentioned on my bumble profile too).

Despite removing him from my socials, he continued to harass me (up until yesterday) with messages, constant calls, and strange WhatsApp statuses, referencing me on his stories again and again.

How do I know these stories that he posted refer to me? Because he made a point to text me saying ‚Äúcheck my story‚Äù whenever he posted something so that I don‚Äôt miss it apparently üò≠‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve attached a video neeche lol, can‚Äôt seem to add other photos but oh well it‚Äôs ok.

Are these earbuds worth adding to your collection? Let‚Äôs dive into the details.

# Key Features of JBL Tune Flex

* **JBL Pure Bass Sound:** Delivers deep, punchy bass and clear mids for balanced sound.
* **All-Day Battery Life:** Up to 32 hours of combined playback with the charging case (8 hours in the earbuds, 24 hours from the case).

# Pros of JBL Tune Flex

1. **Exceptional Sound Quality:** The signature JBL Pure Bass sound offers rich and immersive audio.
2. **Effective ANC:** Active noise cancellation performs well in reducing ambient noise.
3. **Compact and Lightweight:** Easy to carry and comfortable for long listening sessions.

6. **Customizable Fit:** Different ear tip sizes ensure a perfect fit for most users.

# Cons of JBL Tune Flex

2. **Touch Controls Can Be Tricky:** Learning the touch gestures takes some getting used to.
3. **No Advanced App Features:** Lacks an equalizer for fine-tuning audio preferences.
4. **Not for Audiophiles:** While sound quality is good, it may not satisfy those with very high audio expectations.

# My Personal Experience with JBL Tune Flex

As someone always on the go, I appreciate the portability and ease of use the [JBL Tune Flex](https://amzn.to/3VF9Gmq) offers. Setting them up was straightforward, and the snug fit meant I didn‚Äôt have to worry about them slipping out during workouts. The **JBL Pure Bass Sound** made my favorite playlists sound full and lively, while the active noise cancellation helped me focus in moderately noisy environments like coffee shops.

Battery life lived up to expectations‚ÄîI used them throughout the day without needing a recharge. The compact charging case slipped easily into my pocket, adding to their convenience. However, the touch controls required a bit of a learning curve, and I wished there were more advanced app features for tweaking sound profiles.

Overall, the [JBL Tune Flex](https://amzn.to/3VF9Gmq) delivered on comfort, sound quality, and practicality, making them a solid choice for daily use.

# Who Should Buy the JBL Tune Flex?

These earbuds are an excellent option for:

* **Casual Listeners:** Great for users who want good sound quality without breaking the bank.
* **Active Individuals:** The water-resistant and secure-fit design makes them perfect for workouts.
* **Commuters:** Active noise cancellation and portability are ideal for on-the-go listening.
* **Budget-Conscious Buyers:** A value-packed alternative to pricier true wireless earbuds.

# Final Verdict

The [JBL Tune Flex](https://amzn.to/3VF9Gmq) true wireless earbuds offer a well-rounded package of sound quality, comfort, and portability. While they may not have all the bells and whistles of higher-end models, they excel in providing reliable performance at an affordable price.

1heyyea,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowthCentsRealEstate/comments/1heyyea/7_key_trends_shaping_the_real_estate_market_in/,7 Key Trends Shaping the Real Estate Market in 2025,"Here‚Äôs an overview of the key trends shaping the real estate market in 2025 that you should keep an eye on.

1. Home prices are rising, with experts predicting growth around four to five percent this year. This increase is mainly due to limited housing inventory and strong demand, especially in popular areas like the Sun Belt. For instance, cities like Austin and Phoenix are seeing a lot of movement as people flock there for better job opportunities and a more affordable lifestyle. If you're looking to buy or sell, knowing what's happening locally can help you make better choices.
2. Sustainable living is becoming a big deal. More buyers are seeking out energy-efficient homes that come with features like solar panels, smart thermostats, and proper insulation. These homes not only lower utility costs but also appeal to people who care about the environment. For example, a home with a LEED certification can sell for a higher price because buyers see the long-term savings and eco-friendliness as a huge plus.
3. Technology is totally changing the game in real estate. Virtual tours allow you to walk through homes without ever leaving your couch, which is super handy for busy people or those relocating from far away. Plus, AI chatbots are making it easier to get instant responses to your questions. Imagine finding your dream home while sipping coffee at home, thanks to these innovations!
4. With remote work becoming the norm, many buyers are now searching for homes with dedicated office spaces and solid internet connections. Suburbs are becoming the go-to choice because they offer more space and a better quality of life. Think about it: you can have a nice backyard and a home office instead of being cramped in a tiny apartment downtown.
5. Urban areas are making a comeback as cities invest in improvements like public transport and green spaces. These changes are designed to attract people back downtown, which can really boost property values in those neighborhoods. For instance, a new park or bike lane can make an area feel more inviting and livable, leading to an uptick in demand for housing there.
6. AI and machine learning are stepping up property management. These technologies let property managers use predictive maintenance tools to address issues before they become big problems. So instead of waiting for a tenant to complain about a leaky faucet, property managers can proactively fix it, which keeps tenants happier and saves money in the long run.
7. Blockchain is opening doors for new investment opportunities through fractional ownership. This means you don‚Äôt need a ton of cash to invest in real estate anymore; you can buy a small piece of a property through tokenization. It's still pretty new, but it could democratize access to real estate investing, allowing more people to get in on the action without breaking the bank.

Sometimes by 5 pounds!  My first week on tirzepatide and it has really smoothed out. My first dose was on the 6th.

It also seems to have completely solved my migraines,  except for a very bad one on shot day - presumably because of it wearing off. 

I have recently stopped taking my preventative just to see if it's actually helping and to make sure it's not just because it's helping my preventative work better. So far,  it seems to be true! I hope it stays that way because I've spent the last several years trying to prepare for permanent disability due to migraines. 

Heart palpitations are also gone - something I've been experiencing since covid.  Haven't needed to take a propranolol in over a week.  A first for me! 

Coffee no longer gives me the jitters.

1heyum6,https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/1heyum6/its_really_depressing_to_think_about_what/,It's really depressing to think about what happened to FB and how it ruined so many lives,"Growing up as a Millenial, I remember FB being this place that allowed you to have a glimpse into your friend's lives. 

We got to see what their life was like and understand them better and grow closer as humans. 

You got to learn their favorite foods, who their parents were etc without leaving your home. 

....at least that WAS the plan. 

It instead created jealously and hatred. And people who were mentally unstable teenagers or depressed could just post whatever they wanted which well..you get it. 

Random strangers could add you or message you dick pics or threatening messages

But for a while it was nice, you actually formed friendships and made friends. Like actual friends. With people from all around the world ! 

But then you started to realize who was actually your friend and who just wanted an add. 

You realized that nobody cared about what you posted or they DID care and not in a good way. 

Then businesses started shilling pages and filling feeds instead of friends, so if you liked Taco Bell you'd get spammed with posts from the page. 

Then the groups thing started and oh, Sarah from HS is posting nudes. 

And the 2016 election came and oh Mike unfriended me for my political views

My best friend bobbert from HS suddenly hates me because of a post I made about how orange juice is superior to coffee. 

Oh ads. Fun. 

Now I'm scared to post anything for fear of a ban or somebody unfriending me, fun!   

I deactivated my account early this year because its just depressing to see what it became. 

All my HS friends either deactivated, deleted or abandoned their accounts. 

FB ruined itself because it decided to become more authoritarian and private then what it set out to be. 

A place for people to connect and just be friends. 

Now what's the point? If you're like me and almost 30 you know all your friends from HS either have families now or don't use FB anymore and your family that isn't mom and pop is either dying/dead or disowned you for political reasons. 

Do you really want to log on to see Sarah from HS posting a photo of her 3rd baby from her 5th baby daddy? Or your cousin posting a picture of a sandwich for lunch? 

Do you really want your friends to hate you for posting about something you're passionate about? 

Facebook isn't fun anymore and definitely isn't even close to what it was in the early 2010s 

There isn't anymore fun anymore. It feels like a prison you are forced to be happy in. 

Why? Because you're looking though a window to other people's lives though a steel barred window while trapped in your own. 

People don't add anymore for fear of hacking or harassment and nobody checks message requests. 

You can't even add strangers anymore unless you have 1 or 2 mutual friends

There is no more connecting. There is no more trust. 

Facebook is a shadow of what it used to be. 

Somebody once described FB as an abandoned theme park full of dead memories and honestly I think that's the most fitting description 

If we never had FB I honestly think the world would've been a better place.

1heytpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mildlynomil/comments/1heytpp/i_have_finally_had_enough/,I have finally had enough,"There is so much more to this story but my MIL is extremely persistent about wanting to visit and ‚Äúhelp‚Äù with my now 9 month old baby. She expected to come over daily when he was first born and hold him for hours. I had just had an emergency c-section and was having breastfeeding issues on top of almost immediate PPD and PPA which included horrible insomnia. To this day I have to heavily medicate myself get any sleep at all. So by the time we were home from the hospital I had not slept more than maybe a cumulative 2 hours in 5 days. She guilt tripped and pity partied any time we said no to her multiple requests to come over constantly and would ask us to bring her food, coffee, etc when she did come. Not once did she wash a bottle, fold a towel, bring food, nothing. Her offers of help begin and end with playing mommy to my baby.

She has not let up with time. She continues to ask to come over at least twice a week. I started just ignoring her messages and dropped the rope with her. I had demanded my husband deal with the situation and he never would. It has pushed our marriage to the brink of divorce. This morning after the latest round of guilt tripping because ‚Äúshe hasn‚Äôt seen the baby in two weeks ü•∫‚Äù and him still not standing up for me or our family, I just said enough is enough. I told him he could either handle it right then or I was going to, and I wouldn‚Äôt be nice if I had to deal with it. So I wrote the message and he sent it.

To not only expect but demand that we host you on one of the two days that we have free to be together as a nuclear family every week is actual insanity. To then imply that I am keeping my baby from you because you only see him once a week is absurd. Most of my own family has only met him once or twice at most. I think once a week is far more than generous and also completely unsustainable for me. If you wanted to be top of my list to call for help, maybe you should have actually been helpful or respected my need for space and privacy during what was objectively the worst time of my entire life. Instead you stomped on my boundaries and treated me and my husband like children (literally called me kiddo when coming into my house to meet my son. I am a 30 year old woman, wife, mother, homeowner, in many ways much more mature than you ever could be at twice my age. I am not a child and I‚Äôm definitely not your child.)

No response as of yet, hours later. I just do not care anymore. This is 90% a husband problem and I am done fighting with him over it too. I accept my fate, if things don‚Äôt improve I am going to cut my losses and be done with them all.",53,1734287203.0,Mildlynomil,13,1.0,False

**Scene One**

*It is 9:30am. Dwight's interview is at 11am. The entire office is in a conference room meeting. Stanley forgets his crossword puzzle, bored, looks outside and sees Dwight hyping himself up.*

Stanley: What in the world? Who is that?!

Michael: I don't know. What a weirdo.

Creed: It's obvious. He's on the good stuff.

Michael: Coffee?

Creed: Sure, boss.

Michael: Anyways, let's quickly finish our discussion. I have someone to interview for the new salesman job at 11 and need to finish some paperwork beforehand so I can make it to Alfrado's for their lunch special.

Stanley: Amen. Let's get this meeting over with. I can sure use a $5 sub combo.

*Meeting continues*

**Scene Two**

*Dwight walks into the office and speaks to Mary, the receptionist who worked at Dunder Mifflin before Pam.*

Mary: Hi! How can I help you today?

Dwight: Hello, Dwight K. Schrute, I have an interview with Michael G. Scott at 11am sharp.

Mary: Hello, Mr. Schrute. *looks at watch* It is 10:15. You are a bit early. Let...

Dwight: *interrupts.* No, I am on time. When you are early, you are on time. When you are on time, you are late. When you are late, you are in trouble.

Mary: I love your attitude! Let me let Michael know you are here. Please take a seat at the couch over there!

Dwight: I prefer to stand. Good for the blood flow.

Mary: *calls Michael.* Your 11am is here.

Michael: Perfect. I will be out in a second. Let me get this interview over with so I can take my lunch

*Stanley stares at Dwight in disbelief. Angela is staring at Dwight, suppressing a smile.*

Stanley talking head: This is the fool Michael is interviewing?! They will hire just about anyone nowadays...

Angela talking head: I... He is so... Well, he appears to have a good work ethic, which I find attrac.... I... Sorry, I did not get enough sleep last night.

**Scene Three**

*Michael sees Dwight from his window as he is standing.*

Michael talking head: Oh, this guy?! He is a total freak. I need a cool salesman. I need someone I can be friends with... Or a cute woman... Toby always chooses the biggest freaks for me to interview... Yuck!

Michael: Hi Dwight, you can come in.

*In Michael's office*

Michael: Please sit.

Dwight: I prefer standing.

Michael: That's weird. Please sit.

Dwight: Fine (reluctantly sits).

Michael: What makes you think you would make a great salesman?

Dwight: I am hardworking, I run a bed and breakfast farm, and I've been making sales since I was five.

Michael: Since five?

Dwight: Yes, I sold beets from age five to today at my beet farm my grandfather left me. I used to sell beets with him at the side of the road and at farmers markets. I sold more than any kid in my class at the X-man school.

Michael: X-man school?!

Dwight: Yes. I can sell anything. You name it, I will sell it.

Michael: You can never outsell me. I need someone who can come close to me, and I do not think you can cut it.

Dwight: Please Mr. Scott, I bet you I can outsell you in one month. Give me one month, and if I do not outsell you, you can fire me.

Michael: Bet? You got a deal. Close does not count. You must outsell me based on this (hands Dwight a sheet). If you are one penny off by the end of the month, you are done. You hear me?

Dwight: Yes.

Michael: You start Monday.

Dwight: Why not right now?

Michael: It's an HR policy. Try not to suck like our HR guy. Talk with him, then go home, and see you Monday at 9am sharp for orientation.

Michael (calls Toby): Get in here now (hangs up).

Toby (comes in): What is it, Michael?

Michael: Do the onboarding with Dwight. I just hired him.

Toby: That can wait till Monday, I need some documents for the I-9.

Dwight: Got it right here, passport, social security card, drivers license, birth certificate, tax forms for the last 10 years, cancelled check, you name it.

Toby: Perfect. All I need is your passport and cancelled check. You can fill out the necessary forms.

Dwight: Done. (goes inside briefcase). All here!

Toby: where did you get these forms?

Dwight: Trust me, Toby, I am on top of everything!

Toby (reviews the forms). This is everything. Wow, you are good. I just need to see your passport for the I-9.

Dwight: (hands over passport).

Toby (goes out to copy the form): Perfect. Also, I need you to select a health plan. You can do that on Monday. Welcome aboard!

Dwight: Perfect! See you Monday! I promise not to let you down!

Michael: ok, Dwight.

**Scene Four**

Stanley talking head: I cannot believe Michael hired this fool!

Creed talking head: I think I will get along with him just fine. He was clearly on that good stuff this morning, so maybe he has some for me!

Angela talking head: I look forward to meeting this new guy (blushes).

Toby talking head: This man completed all the necessary forms days in advanced. He saved me a lot of time. I appreciate the initiative. I think he would be a great, focused employee. Though I wonder how he got some of our official on-boarding forms? They are supposed to be private.

Michael: This freak will not last the one month. Then, I can replace him with someone cool. I need new beer buddies.

**One month later**

Michael talking head: Well, Dwight was a few thousand dollars short. I guess I have to fire him!

*Phone rings*

Michael (answers): Michael Scott.

Randall (CFO before David Wallace): Hey Michael. I have to say, I am a bit impressed by your new employee, Dwight.

Michael: Really?

Randall: Yes, he made many sales his first month, and even brought in the Lackawanna County Sheriff's Office and Courthouse. All within his first week! I've never seen anything like this in my years of working in sales! Didn't you tell me he sold beets or something?

Michael: Yes, he is a farmer. But I made more sales than that.

Randall: Michael, you did all that in one quarter. And you did have a rough start. Dwight had a great start.

Michael (interrupts): Well, I saw something in him. But I had higher hopes.

Randall: Michael, I chose you as manager because of your sales. You are known to occasionally have good judgement. Last month, you proved that by hiring Dwight. Good job! Keep it up! You may be the reason why we stay in business! Why don't you give Dwight a $1,000 bonus. Also, I know we do not usually do this, but if you can get Dwight to stay for six months, I will give you the $1,000 referral bonus we typically give employees for referring new employees.

Michael: Sounds good. Thank you!

Michael (calls Dwight in his office): come in, Dwight.

Dwight: Michael, I know I did not meet your goal. Please don't fire me. Please...

Michael: Shut it, Dwight. You are here to stay!

Dwight: YES!

Michael: but, you need to keep up the work. Keep bringing in those sales. Both myself and corporate are counting on you. Do not screw this up!

Dwight: I won't! Thank you!

Michael: (scoffs) get back to work! 

Dwight: On it!

Michael: Oh, corporate says you have a $1,000 bonus. You will see it on your next check. 

Dwight (shouts so loud Michael flinches): YES!

*Dwight walks into the hallway, and hypes up.*

Michael: He is so weird. I was going to fire him, but I cannot look like a fool in front of Randall, Alan, and Jan. So now he has to stay. At least he may help me get that bonus in five months, and the bonus for exceeding this branch's goals. I guess the cool new salesman has to wait till another day. I miss Packer. Why did he have to be a traveling salesman?

Dwight talking head: I knew Michael would do the right thing. I feel Michael and I will become good friends. I love this job. I can see myself working here for the next 60 years. That will leave 40 for my retirement. Ooh. Phone is ringing. gotta get that.",7,1734287192.0,RedditWritesTheOffice,1,1.0,False

1heyssz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1heyssz/need_help_with_opening_a_halfway_house_in_my/,Need help with opening a halfway house in my state (AZ).,"I am 25 years old and was recently released from prison on a sex offence felony on a minor, through the internet. Scroll directly to the bottom paragraph if you don't care about the context of the question, and just want the dang question. I tend to not stop talking once I start, apparently online too.

My story doesn't really matter besides for the basic facts, and I have a tendency to ramble so here goes.
I live in Arizona, which can be a really rough state depending on where you lie, county jurisdiction wise.

In this state we have about 2 or maybe 3 designed sex-offender halfway houses. GP can stay here too but they (obviously) don't like to unless they've been kicked out of everywhere else and don't last long here generally. Off topic, anyways, the conditions in this house are abysmal. I went into it knowing it was going to be bad, recently released men with probably drug or alcohol problems, coexisting mental health conditions, no real support etc. I am a mentally, physically etc healthy male in the supposed to be genetically peak of my life right now, everything is supposed to be leveling out, and the conditions at this house/program as a whole are so stressful in daily life that I got injured at work, had to bed rest for 3 days ended up getting fired cause it's a shitty construction temp job for ex inmates who just got out and you are the definition of replaceable. 

The shit built up so fast, I'm not gonna get into my whole life story, but thank God, I realized I had been in a state of near constant mania for 2 entire weeks after getting fired and was scaring the shit out of my roommates and family, and I'm emotionally in tune enough to realize what I was doing while I was doing it, I knew what was going on, I've had episodes before, but this one was really bad because I just couldn't stop no matter how hard I tried.

Thank God, literally, they just opened up a mental health walk in center 2 minutes walk from my house with a genuinely beautiful soul of a psychiatrist, I told her my struggles fully transparent and honest about my background and the last 5 years of my life, and totally did not judge, just wanted to help. She got me on the meds I needed to not completely zombie me out like some medications do, but just enough to curve the mania i experience from psychosis level to an actually functional and controllable level, since I started taking these meds I feel like superman lol. I can chill out or get excited whenever I want. Sad that I'm excited to just exist like everyone else does normally. Anyways.

Long story fucking long, I see men here who genuinely want to improve their lives and get better, but like me, they get snared by life and bad conditions, and they can never cultivate that golden seed that lives inside all of us man. They're surrounded by bad soil and roots that choke them and they don't get any light, no help at all from anyone. They get released just like I did, put on a couch and told ""figure it out"". They say they have resources, but when you actually ask them ""hey when's the church service?"" Or ""hey do you guys do mental health diagnoses as well"" and I found out they're actually under fire right now from the government for being shady as hell in the ""nonprofit, helping people get their lives together"" part of everything. I think they're peeling back the curtain and seeing how ugly this all is here. The damn bedbugs and roaches are the real residents here, we just pay money to lay on disgusting spring twin bed that's been through Vietnam, and get bitten by bedbugs all night. Wake up in the morning to make coffee and the roaches all scatter out ofd the sink, full of disgusting dishes that weren't even rinsed out, just tossed in for the roaches to finish off, when you just fucking washed them the night before. Shit is TRULY a horrid, disgusting existence here. 

I got the help I truly needed in prison and now know how to be an effective leader who can communicate himself and be trusted with responsibility and power. I think my age makes people doubt that, but I've been through way more than most and my actions and character can attest to that. 

I not only see this as an opportunity to help men who WANT to change, I'm not going to waste my time on the busters and the lames, I will discharge them and send them straight back to the roaches and bedbugs they came from.

But I want to start a REAL nonprofit organization with a Christian focus on helping recently released sex offenders transition back into society, SAFELY and in full cooperation with any legal or probation/parole guidelines. I want to help the men who want to help themselves, just like I did. We all really do just need a helping hand sometimes.

I guess that's what I'm asking for now. I'm not stupid, I know I don't need to run out, buy a house, fill it with guys and try to figure it all out as I go. I'm borderline Asperger's or something, I believe, me and my psych are trying to figure out that diagnoses right now, but that's another story.

I know I need structure and if I really want to see this through I need to take it as slow and careful as possible, one wrong move or wrong choice, mistake, etc can completely cripple this, and I don't even know if it's a realistic expectation as I know insurance for sex offenders in organizations like halfway houses is a hellish nightmare. 

All I know, truly, is that God made me a new creation in prison, I'm not perfect now by anyones damn means and I don't want to be. I'm at the age and point in my life where I am going to take control, I'm sick and tired of others, ESPECIALLY those way worse off than me in other areas of life, but because they paid their rent a month in advance, they think they got the blueprints and wanna tell me how to live. 

I'm my own man, my experiences and life have brought me to a place of natural leadership in social structures(even when I don't fucking WANT TO BE üò≠ i.e the group ""dad"" or the ""therapist homie"", etc). Everything in my life is aligning perfectly, even the manic episode was necessary to open my eyes to certain things I wouldn't have seen fully before. 

This isn't just a money thing to me like it is to the current administration of this program. That's cool to finance my life, but really I don't even know what I would do if I made $1000 a week. I've budgeted and saved and penny pinched my whole life, money is just a tool to me lol. I don't worship it or what I can bring me. 

But, I used to tear people down when I was haunted by bad energy, demons, addiction, whatever. Destroyed houses, families, home, even did the dumbest thing I could ever do and betrayed my baby mama and kids trust and love in me as a result on my decisions. I got the help I needed and you can call it whatever you would like to, but it's almost as if my brain was acting like an energy magnet, and God just flipped the polarity from negativity to positivity.

I bring the men directly around me up, they tell me this even when I don't directly observe it, tell me that I'm making an impact in their lives, I'm gonna go somewhere, I'm on the right track, etc. I hear it constantly but remain the same. in the 4 months I've lived at this property I'm the only one here who consistently maintains and repairs it, I act almost as a fucking therapist to those around me when they need it, and I'm just their buddy talking shit about video games and childhood and smoking a joint on the back porch when they're not. I literally feel the embodiment of love and joy within me daily and all I truly seek to do is help others reach the place I live in most of the time now. Everything else, truly, doesn't matter to me. I don't care about the hot girlfriends or a fancy car or a big empty house that's beautiful but ugly in the inside, etc. I don't. My eyes got opened up over the past few years of loss and suffering and pain, and now I want to build my life around me, doing the thing I truly love to do most in this world, help another person along their path. 

TLDR: I live in a shitty halfway house, my experiences in life I feel have qualified me to lead with confidence, and I want to use that ability to help SO's recently released get actual help instead of being sucked into this shit hole cycle where they only care about you because you pay them $900 a month. I have a natural gift of listening and communicating, empathizing and helping others with actionable and real advice. I want to use these gifts/talents to do the same thing thing halfway house program claims to do, but fails to deliver on, because they only care about the money. 

 
I want to take what I'm currently doing in my life, and scale the size to help more people. If you read all of this, please help üò≠",2,1734287136.0,SexOffenderSupport,2,1.0,False
1heysa3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/1heysa3/coffee_run_too_small_a_map/,Coffee run - too small a map!,"So I'm fairly new to the game, and I started what I thought would be a throw-away coffee restaurant thinking I'll just get it to franchise and fail early overtime and move on.

Instead it's my longest run yet, currently on 29 day overtime.

Problem is, because I wasn't really planning on going so long, I picked a small map. I automated everything I could, but I have no more space for serving automation, so I'm stuck serving by hand. At OT 18 I thought I would only have a couple days left in me until the patience runs out, but here I am 10 more days later and the patience doesn't even get close to running out. 

This run I recorded was when I had to pick cupcakes, so I thought I would fail, but it still was fine.

At this point I'm feeling a bit burnt out, I kinda want to fail to be done with it, but I dont want to throw it. I want to fail legitimately, for my own pride's sake haha. I've been taking a break from it to play different restaurants to try and enjoy the game again.

Is there anything I can improve? I fear that the time it may take to re-jig a few things and get some new blueprints that I may actually lose patience then.

Pairing the headphones with both my iPhone and Android tablet was seamless, and the USB-C lossless audio was a nice bonus for studio-like sound during wired use. However, the lack of a folding mechanism made them slightly inconvenient to pack in my bag during commutes.
