does anyone mind helping me find my mom's bakery? she use to play on android and


she played heavily around the 2011-2013 because i remember being in elementary sneaking on there and making coffee over and over. she had lots of decorations and it was big with a lot of coins and she was a high level, it was a game she really enjoyed playing (she loves baking in real life as well) but had lost access to it years ago and i recently just thought about the game and wanted to try to help her get her account back


carmsweet(s) or carmsmoot could be her username/bakery name (she really can't remember and im trying to gather at least some type of proof other than her email before reaching out to support) if someone could search and provide a screenshot of her bakery *IF found*

Curious to hear what others have experienced? am I overreacting or is this actually unhinged?

I will add that, the security staff is not at fault, it‚Äôs our property management team who runs the place like a prison.

Here are some of the rules: 

If someone sleeps over, I have to pre-register them or security will give them a hard time. Having a one night stand? Prepare to get a knock on your door if security notices you have an overnight guest.

Can‚Äôt lend my fob to a friend, so if we‚Äôre at the pool and they want to run to the unit to grab a bottle of water. Too bad. You‚Äôll hear about it.

Guests can‚Äôt use amenities unless I physically escort them like they are children. 

Want to hit the gym with a friend? Security will make your guest leave mid-workout to register them, even though the ‚Äúregistration‚Äù is literally just an email ‚Äî no ID, no verification. I could make up a name. So‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the point?

I occasionally sell items on Facebook Marketplace ‚Äî and I can‚Äôt just let someone swing by to pick up a coffee table. I have to book the service elevator days in advance and get written approval from management for a 2-minute pickup. And then hope the buyer shows up in that booking window.

If I leave my front door open for airflow, I get a knock within 5 minutes telling me to close it. My own front door.

Male guests ‚Äî especially men of colour ‚Äî are absolutely harassed at the front desk, which is crazy because most of the security staff are ‚Ä¶ men of colour.üòí

Security will not allow male guests upstairs unless they call me and get verbal confirmation first. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I just buzzed someone in using the intercom ‚Äî they still need to hear me say, ‚ÄúYes, let in the person I just let in.‚Äù This process doesn‚Äôt exist for female guests.

The fob often doesn‚Äôt even work to access the amenity floors. You have to call the concierge, give your unit number, they stare at you through a little camera for whatever reason, and then buzz you in. The trick is making sure you call when someone is actually available to pick up the phone.

There‚Äôs zero flexibility. No common sense. Just a strict, robotic enforcement of every rule, without any emotional intelligence or basic human understanding.

1mhoaa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SuperfamiliarWilsons/comments/1mhoaa7/monday_motivation_the_art_of_starting_badly/,Monday Motivation: The Art of Starting Badly,"It‚Äôs Monday morning in Gainesville, and I‚Äôm sitting here thinking about all the things I‚Äôm going to tackle this week with mediocre (or less) results for my effort.

I know. That‚Äôs not very motivational of me. You probably came here expecting some polished wisdom about crushing your goals and manifesting your dreams and turning Monday from a buckling bronco into a tame thoroughbred.¬†

But here‚Äôs the thing: I think we‚Äôve got motivation all wrong.

We‚Äôve turned it into this performative dance where we pretend we‚Äôre going to spring out of bed at 5 AM, drink our green smoothie, journal our gratitudes, and attack the day like some caffeinated warrior poet. And when we inevitably hit snooze three times and grab gas station coffee instead, we feel like failures before we‚Äôve even started.

But what if starting badly is good?

Last month, I decided to start going to the gym. Not because I had some grand fitness revelation or because my doctor threatened me (though both of those things may be true), but because I was tired of walking past my running shoes every morning and feeling like a liar.

So I laced them up and went into the little bitty gym in my community. It was pathetic. I got winded after about thirty seconds. My form was terrible but the magic isn‚Äôt in the perfect beginning. It‚Äôs in the willingness to begin imperfectly. Unfortunately all of that made me not want to go back into the gym‚Ä¶ever. I‚Äôm a middle aged adult who let one bad start beat me.

We live in a culture that worships the highlight reel, the before and after photos, the success stories that skip over all the messy middle parts. We see the published novel but not the terrible first draft. We see the thriving business but not the months of eating ramen and wondering if you‚Äôre completely delusional. We see the happy marriage but not the conversations that happen at 2 AM when both people are too tired to pretend everything‚Äôs fine.

Real life happens in the mess and the false starts. In the showing up when you don‚Äôt feel like it and doing a mediocre job because mediocre is what you‚Äôve got today. Starting badly beats not starting at all, every single time.

Here‚Äôs what I wish someone had told me when I was younger: motivation isn‚Äôt a feeling you wait for. It‚Äôs a decision you make. It‚Äôs not the surge of energy that gets you started; it‚Äôs the quiet commitment that keeps you going when the surge fades.

Because it will fade. The enthusiasm, the optimism, the Monday morning certainty that this time will be different, it all fades. And that‚Äôs when the real work begins. That‚Äôs when you find out if you‚Äôre serious or if you were just shopping for feelings.

The people who actually change their lives aren‚Äôt the ones who start perfectly. They‚Äôre the ones who start badly and keep going anyway. They‚Äôre the ones who miss workouts and do them the next time they are scheduled. Who write terrible first pages and keep writing. Who have awkward conversations and keep talking.

Consistency beats intensity. Showing up beats showing off. Progress is messy and non-linear and mostly invisible until suddenly it‚Äôs not.

So start badly. Start scared. Start without a plan. Start even though you don‚Äôt feel ready, because nobody ever feels ready. Start because you‚Äôre tired of thinking about starting.

Start because the distance between who you are and who you want to be can only be crossed one imperfect step at a time.

Not sure how to format this post since I had a conversation with Devan Manley last night and the situation was slightly different from what I thought.

Nothing doctored or altered, I implore everyone to go verify all of this publicly available proof themselves.  
Very brief overview of what happened, then explaining how I'll format this post.

Kevin wanted someone to run pages and edit clips etc. I figured 1,000 people already went for it, didn't bother, turns out only 1 guy did and it was just the IG. Kevin Abstract then requested many times for someone to edit videos and run a tiktok page. He made it very clear¬†[multiple times](https://www.youtube.com/@BlushTX)¬†this would all be paid. He has a¬†[history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNjE5_HFfHA)¬†of saying he wants to get people paid, that there's jobs available and plenty of room for people to do official work and get paid, he constantly mentions people doing work and getting paid, joining blush, how¬†[they need so many different people](https://postimg.cc/WtK3y8hR)¬†and so on.

Beginning of June, Kevin Abstract repeatedly asked for someone to edit and run the tiktok page, heavy emphasis on this being a PAID position (more issues than just money, later). Immediately I made the page and started posting, told him, he told me link with Devan or AJ. I posted a story and tagged Devan, he brought me on officially and told me to post it on tiktok and do more edits, work with the IG page¬†[and so on](https://postimg.cc/7C13q65k). Devan said he loved my work etc, later on would routinely praise my work ethic and results.

In short, many people lied and tried to cover it up as ""miscommunications""  
This started with BlushClipss and the twitch mod team

[https://www.instagram.com/starbearez/](https://www.instagram.com/starbearez/)  
BlushClipss/ian got a DM from Kevin. He asked me a lot of questions/wanted advice, how to handle the twitch mods, pay, many other things. I have all of our DMs ready to post but I'll wait first to see if they catch themselves in a lie. BlushClipss glazed me, said how great I am and how much¬†[he wanted to keep me around, said how professional and knowledgeable I was](https://imgur.com/a/BeQbsRg), he also told me everything was completely¬†[private (which I never even asked him to](https://imgur.com/a/7vS21J3), he himself went out of his way to swear this)

then a few hours later ghosted me, told our entire ""private"" conversation to the mods but lied and put out false accusations of me talking crazy/being weird/inappropriate/difficult to work with. This is a direct contradiction to what he said right before to me, a lie. He did this because he gave the mods his account login to share and he was afraid of being caught being 2 faced and acting weird.  
He deliberately deleted his messages to hide this. The mods say he ""lost access"" to his copy of our DMs after he gave them the login.  
IG messages are stored in the cloud. They're not erased even if you delete/deactivate your account. The only way to delete your messages is to go through and manually delete your copy of the conversation. This, combined with IanBC saying things to me and doing the exact opposite hours later is very clear proof that he directly lied and deleted his messages so he wouldn't be caught being two-faced and weird. Again, if the team wants to run their mouth I'll happily go through every single message with ianBlushClipss and narrate it, see how many lies they get caught in

Again, BlushClipss/ian¬†[admitted](https://postimg.cc/B8yJCtdG)¬†to all of this¬†[multiple times](https://imgur.com/a/wkchW6P), but called it a¬†[""miscommunication""](https://imgur.com/TWjb8NG)¬†and blamed it on his mental health

The next section is about the twitch mods, here is¬†[all of the DM](https://youtu.be/Q187L1BGub8)s with the twitch mods,¬†[part 2](https://youtu.be/JOY7AwKlds8)¬†and¬†[part 3](https://youtube.com/shorts/naXlWxtRQgw)

Originally this post was more detailed on the mistakes the mods made, but I've recently learned they're glorified interns so I'll be faster here

After he spoke to Kevin, BlushClipss/ian ghosted me, added the mods, told the lies, they blackballed me and decided to silently remove me from the group without talking to me or Devan Manley. Days later I noticed something was wrong so I asked Devan.¬†[He was surprised](https://postimg.cc/nsgwsTZJ)¬†because they made an iMessage chat together and he thought I was already in it. Again, let me repeat, Devan Manley thought I was officially on payroll with the mods in the exclusive iMessage groupchat. Devan Manley also thought that I had his phone number, so there is no denying in any way that I was both officially recognized and an actual blush affiliate that did official authorized work for them.

The issue is that his mods removed me and blackballed me without telling him. Anyways, when I asked Devan what happened he asked the mods and Ian lied, they repeated what Ian told them, unknowingly spreading those lies.  
Again, I knew something was still wrong since Devan never responded. I confront the mods later and that's where it was confirmed BlushClipss/ian spread a lot of lies about me. He admitted to this multiple times and took full responsibility, but called it a ""miscommunication"" which is patently not true. All of the twitch mods¬†[acknowledged](https://postimg.cc/PLZd2dhp)¬†I did nothing wrong, that they were¬†[misinformed](https://imgur.com/a/dIeVPeN), and that it was not my fault and my name was cleared and the whole thing was a ""mistake""

the issue is that after this I asked to be added to the iMessage and main group and they chose to¬†[keep me removed](https://imgur.com/a/xpYQFSV)¬†anyways. It seemed things were resolved so I kept working as I was told, except they never informed Devan everything they told him about me was a lie. So unless I'm mistaken somehow, at this point the entire twitch mod team is collectively lying by omission to cover up their mistakes while still blackballing me.

I'll refrain from posting all of my DMs with Devan Manley but if the validity of what I say is called into question that can change.

I confront Devan about this and make it known¬†[at the very start](https://postimg.cc/Th4SBRBw), me not being paid is an issue. He assures me he wants to keep me around, loves my work, values my work ethic, and he will work to find a resolution.  
The issue is that he never did, and every time I asked him about the resolution, he pawned me off to the twitch mods and had me try to ""work it out"" with them

Unsurprisingly, the people that decided to ruin my life for no reason and kept ruining my life for 0 personal gain, did not decide to stop ruining my life when I asked them. So again I was blackballed.  
At one point I called Devan and Saint and I was assured again that my work was good, they acknowledged I have ""insane work ethic"" and then told me they wanted to find a resolution.  
The twitch mods kept me removed anyways but told me they would repost a video if I asked. I tried to play this way for a bit, give Devan some time because he's ""busy"" but after this point he would routinely ignore me as much as possible and give me dismissive 3 word replies occasionally.

It never went anywhere, reposts did nothing and I still wasn't being paid even though I made it known this was an issue many weeks before and I was assured that despite the busy schedule they still wanted me around and were looking for a resolution. Finally I gave in, saw that me editing would not go anywhere anymore. I do graphic design and video editing at a professional level. I do many other things, very good with music and mixing, I have a lot of background in writing and design, especially cinematography as well as film, many many other things etc.

Aside from the many things I do besides editing, now I'll go into detail about the breakdown of rates, hours, work, etc.

As seen¬†[HERE,](https://www.youtube.com/@BlushTX/videos)¬†the month+ I was actively working they streamed for at least 40 hours. Have to go through the entire stream, cut it down, an hour to edit the videos, an hour to finalize, export, thumbnails, posting miscellaneous stuff. At least 2 hours per day in addition to the 40 ish it takes to go through the streams, conservative estimate let's be generous and say I did 90 hours of work.  
BEGINNER rates for an absolute entry level editor are \~20$ an hour, which I am NOT.  
Experienced editors easily charge 50-100 minimum as far as hourly rates, but I know this is a lot simpler and faster than long form video editing so obviously I as a professional know not to charge that, especially since I'm working here with a burgeoning collective that I wanted to grow with.

Any standard editor's rates for shorts would be more like at least 30-40 an hour.  
I wouldn't charge anything near this, which says a lot about my ethic and professionalism (especially considering for many other people it would easily take them up to twice as long to edit these) and also the edits were more complex before I was told to tone down the editing.

So I, as a decent person and professional, recognize charging high rates wouldn't make sense especially since I'm working with a group/company that's starting up. Anyone else would charge 50-100 per hour for editing, 30-40 minimum for shorts and many people, I think, would struggle to get as much work done as I have.

So I would say at least 20$ for the hours I worked is more than fair, a steal in value. That's 1,800 for a month of highly specialized work in addition to all of the other cancerous drama I was forced to deal with. Barely more than a fast food worker gets paid despite this being a highly sought after learned trade/skill in addition to running social media.  
Not to mention as far as editing rates this is just charging near indentured servitude wages in exchange for efficient high quality professional work.

Let's talk numbers. Devan Manley's paid twitch jockeys post 9ish videos per week with 100 viewers ready to clip moments for them at all times. In half a day, I made 14 videos and went back and re-edited all previous videos at the request of Devan. In half a day I did 2x as much work at a much higher quality than his entire team did put together over a week, so despite his twitch mods barely making money, this is different and I am operating at a professional level and need to be paid.

They also can't edit longer moments or reoccurring parts of a stream, 90% just 5 seconds videos a viewer on twitch clipped. The 4 of them after 2 months have 105 videos, I have 40 videos posted and a few dozen more nearly edited in my project file, I've deleted probably 10 or more, privated some videos, scrapped some others, so about 80-90 videos posted or ready to be posted, I could already see the writing on the wall and I knew what was coming so I slowed down a little while waiting for the 'resolutions' and worked on other things including editing up a couple longer form videos to try out as well as designing some graphics to show to blush etc.

And I could have said all this, it would have been resolved over a month ago, if literally anyone at all would have taken the time to reply to me. Or someone could have told me to stop, that I'm no longer part of it, instead of pushing me forwards telling me they'd find a solution and keep me on as part of the team.

I am also NOT some random entry level kid editing for the first time. I've spent 100s of hours studying social media etc, I have a throwaway youtube channel where I've racked up over 1 million views in my spare time over the last year and a half. I showed Devan all of this, the results I've gotten independently and the experience I have, so there's no way Devan genuinely thought I was doing all this for free or next to no pay.  
Also, again they praised my work and determination/drive/ethics, etc. so I HIGHLY doubt Devan and everyone else thought I was tweaking over 20 $ for the last 2 months.

Worth noting in a numerical sense it takes the entire twitch team put together a week to do what I do in half a day, and they do it worse. So it is not a question of quality of work either.

A couple weeks after the mods denied me for the final time,

I started tagging Devan trying to set up a quick call to pitch myself. I accepted that my editing wasn't going anywhere and I was still going to be blackballed no matter what I did, so I wanted to talk to him and present myself and what I had to offer outside of running the page and editing so I could actually do something. I had to spam him with stories, he would give a 1 word reply then delay the call, then say I'll call you,[¬†then delay](https://postimg.cc/MXXB0KGZ), then say just text me, then ignore texts and demos I sent, then not read the text he told me to send him.  
I then sent a TLDR and he finally told me there was no work for me. He said he would ""keep me in mind in the future"" and this is off the back of him religiously ignoring me for weeks

which was the final send off saying that I was not working with them anymore and wouldn't in the future either. The issue is no one ever mentioned this and had me keep working for a month+ while telling me a solution was being worked on and reinforcing how good my work was.

After this I finally broke down and¬†[tweaked](https://postimg.cc/gallery/3KKQBM0)¬†out in Devan's DM and he ignored me. Since then I've been tagging him usually once daily until he actually replied and I spoke to him last night and he made it clear I was not going to be paid and I will not get any work or anything else that could compensate for the month+ of work that I did that was promised to be paid and the 2+ months of my life that just went down the drain.  
I tagged him in a¬†[few schizo videos](https://youtu.be/F8goudr0MPQ)¬†on tiktok,  
to test the waters I sent the mods a throwaway video I had lying around to repost to check things, surprisingly they reposted which meant he was keeping quiet on everything but then they were told to take it down and not post or interact with me anymore.  
This was clearly me being blacklisted outright so I started pressing him more about getting paid for the work I did do since clearly there was no future and I needed to be compensated for my time and work.

This led to him finally replying and us having a conversation. I learned the mods are basically interns, he and Saint pay out not Kevin, and that he didn't have any money for me. He said ""Yeah sorry bro idk what to do"" so I said I'll try to think of something.

So I gave Devan the easiest, safest layup imaginable to end this controversy. I would spend my own money to fly to a show, vlog/record it/make a behind the scenes documentary or do interviews etc. A public place with many people where I openly introduce myself in person and do in-person professional film/video work to further earn what I had already earned so this could easily and clearly get resolved in person, etc. This is the easiest most safe solution you could possibly have.

No risk or cost to him, or even blush. I fly myself there. Work for them for a 1 off thing, get paid for doing more professional work instead of just editing streams, then I go home. I'm also not some random creepy anon. My face has been public since day 1, I have history in the blush discord, Devan knows my name and I've actually spoken to him on the phone and worked with him all this time, I've also proven myself responsible by how hard I've worked while having faith in him and following through, how incredibly I've handled this situation privately and peacefully until I started tweaking for the last week or two (in response to him and his employees erasing 2 months of my time, blackballing me, and destroying my life as well as owing $1800+ to me)

Devan, because he does not like me due to me tweaking on him (in response to him ruining my life and stealing from me) declined me. I literally tried to put it all behind us, do professional work that I would front the cost for to justify me getting paid what I was owed, I tried to bury the hatchet and safely and neutrally introduce myself and do 1 off in person professional work at a public event to come together and resolve this peacefully while also giving a professional product and a perfect resolution to everyone.

I asked Devan how that isn't a good idea/isn't doable, after that Devan got a bit more heated and tried to press me, claiming I ""just decided to start editing on my own"" and ""no one asked me to do that"" among other things (which is completely not true and objective horseshit). I then said I understand how stressed he would feel and how it's a complicated idea, so I asked him if he could link me with anyone that could solve this or I could get this idea figured out with and he said no. I asked if he could link me with Kevin to figure something out. This really bothered him and he got mad, went off a lil bit, said no. I said it doesn't make sense to say you don't know me or can't trust me or aren't comfortable when Kevin spoke to IanBlushClipss nearly 2 months ago despite not knowing him at all.

I have literally tried the hardest I possibly could at every point to resolve this peacefully and privately in any and every way possible. At no point has anyone besides me actually cared or even attempted to find a solution here.

Kevin Abstract posted a paid job position. I joined immediately, he recognized me, Devan recognized me, I was brought on officially to work, I then did that work and I made it known from the start me not being paid would be an issue.

I then did do the month of high quality, very efficient editing work as Kevin asked when describing the paid position he posted and advertised multiple times over. I even went above and beyond.

And none of this is even mentioning how the twitch mods got me blackballed for literally no reason, and admitted to it many times, yet they never had to answer for it and I still had everything taken from me and I was mentally tormented for the last 1-2 months despite everyone universally agreeing that I actually didn't do anything wrong.

This has all caused unimaginable stress and emotional turmoil for me. Imagine having your entire life, an entire career path potentially the rest of your life in someone's hands and they just play with it and throw you away like it's nothing. Imagine watching 2+ months of your life go up in flames just because some teenage interns randomly decided to do it for no reason. Imagine being owed minimum $1,800 and the guy that's employed by and best friends with a multimillionaire and multiple platinum artists tells you he can't pay you for the month+ of work you did for him officially.

Yes, this actually has ruined the last 2 months of my life and caused unimaginable stress/anxiety/dread and erased a life changing career path all because Ian(blushclipss) was scared of getting caught being a snake and threw me under the bus to save himself.

I had real authentic faith in Devan for months. I really thought he was just busy and he would pull through like he always said. But I guess he was too¬†[busy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJAQK0yJetw)¬†playing¬†[roblox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXmAIIQ7AWY)¬†and getting matcha to stop ruining my life. This experience has genuinely twisted and warped my mind. I've become much more hateful and I doubt I'll ever be able to truly trust someone again. I wish this could be over. I begged and pleaded to solve this privately, he's held my life in his hands for nearly 2 months and watched as his employees ruined me, but now he sees me as some psychotic tweaker because I briefly freaked out at him once after he stole 90+ hours of my life and much more from me.

Imagine how far I could be right now if I put those 90 hours into making videos for my own actually monetized channel, or worked on my own music for 90 hours, or any other number of things I do.

The twitch mods blackballed me and Devan blacklisted me so even if I wanted to do more work or find a solution outside of this I can't, and he also said repeatedly he won't pay me and ""there's nothing he can do for me"" (which just isn't true)

Kevin is the one who advertised this position and repeatedly requested it, so Kevin should be able to pay me. The mods are on Saint+Dev payroll, that's fine because this is clearly a separate league. I outperformed 4 people put together, I was patient and understanding while letting it be known from week 1 that pay was an issue and I needed to be compensated. I was repeatedly assured at every point that a resolution was being worked towards, but the only resolution was ignoring me and telling me to ask the mods to stop ruining my life. Even then, I tried to work something out with Devan last night because I just want this to be over but every route was shut down.

""WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS PUBLIC, solve it privately"" because I've tried non-stop with everything I had to resolve this privately.

I even made it all as easy as possible for them, told them I didn't even want the mod team to be punished, I just wanted to go back to working and start officially getting paid. Devan would respond once in a while and then defer me to the twitch mods to find a ""resolution"" and, surprisingly, the people who went out of their way to ruin my life for no reason decided to keep doing it after I asked them to stop.

Devan then feigns interest in finding a resolution for a few weeks until he can't be bothered to care anymore and starts routinely ignoring me under the guise of being too busy to schedule an important 10 minute phone call a week in advance, despite routinely playing roblox and going for coffee runs and hang out sessions with his friends as well as streaming constantly

This job was promised with pay, I was brought on officially and officially did work that was officially recognized praised and posted. Devan thought I was already in the imessage chat on payroll, he thought I already had his phone number. There is no denying Kevin Abstract brought people on for this roll, I excelled in a professional setting and worked a lot, and that I was officially a part of the team and officially recognized as working for blush. They may use the excuse of ""there was never a payment agreement"" but that's the whole point. I relentlessly tried to solve this and made it known that was an issue and I was always reassured it would be resolved but then I was ignored.

There is no denying this. I did the work, I did it well and was praised. I put in the time and effort on this paid position but I was put in unimaginable stress by the twitch mods ruining everything, come to find out they basically don't even get paid.  
Kevin Abstract is a multimillionaire, blush raked in \~$160k gross in 1st month streams minimum, they sell 80$ hoodies and the group has multiple platinum artists in it. They can afford to pay me

Any sum I could even think of would be a % of a % of their monthly income. I even suggested to Devan that I could buy a ticket to a texas show, do a behind the scenes vlog/documentary/interviews for the concerts in order to earn that money and prove myself, but he denied me because he didn't feel ""comfortable"" with that because I lightly tweaked in his DMs after him and his employees erased 2 months of my hard work, ruined my life, and blacklisted me from ever getting work in the future as well.

This is just work hours, not counting anything else I've submitted to blush besides that that all went to waste bc I ended up getting blackballed.

All I wanted was a payout and I begged and pleaded for months. Not like I wanted a handout. I just wish I could be compensated and walk away, leave everyone alone and put this behind me but I guess that can't happen.

Moral of the story idk. Don't work for blush ig, lies and ""miscommunications"" lead to biblical fuckups constantly and 2 months of my life have been stolen me. $1,800+ of official work has been stolen from me. 90+ hours I've been made to work for someone else who clearly knew what I was doing and pretended to be ignorant of the situation, and now all I have to show for it is a ""Yeah I'm really sorry bro"" as well as my life being in shambles

I've been used blackballed blacklisted and thrown away in addition to having a group of teenage interns put false accusations on my name.

""Yeah bro I'm sorry bro. Sorry you worked for me for 90 hours and 2+ months of your life went down the drain and you're blackballed, but I don't like you now so I don't want to ask my boss to fix this or get something worked out. Anyways see ya""

Here is a lesson to you all:

immediately do public call outs and expose posts, don't wait hoping someone will become the decent human being they should have been at the start. As soon as someone does something sideways immediately let as many people know as possible. I should have made some expose post like this immediately a month ago, I was stupid to show kindness and patience. Do not give any patience at all to people that are willing to ignore you, do not trust people and especially do not give them wiggle room after they've shown you they don't give a fuck about you. They will keep taking from you, STEALING from you, and when they get bored they'll ruin your life too",2,1754338200.0,brockhampton,0,0.75,False

Nothing doctored or altered, I implore everyone to go verify all of this publicly available proof themselves.  
Very brief overview of what happened, then explaining how I'll format this post.

Kevin wanted someone to run pages and edit clips etc. I figured 1,000 people already went for it, didn't bother, turns out only 1 guy did and it was just the IG. Kevin Abstract then requested many times for someone to edit videos and run a tiktok page. He made it very clear¬†[multiple times](https://www.youtube.com/@BlushTX)¬†this would all be paid. He has a¬†[history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNjE5_HFfHA)¬†of saying he wants to get people paid, that there's jobs available and plenty of room for people to do official work and get paid, he constantly mentions people doing work and getting paid, joining blush, how¬†[they need so many different people](https://postimg.cc/WtK3y8hR)¬†and so on.

Beginning of June, Kevin Abstract repeatedly asked for someone to edit and run the tiktok page, heavy emphasis on this being a PAID position (more issues than just money, later). Immediately I made the page and started posting, told him, he told me link with Devan or AJ. I posted a story and tagged Devan, he brought me on officially and told me to post it on tiktok and do more edits, work with the IG page¬†[and so on](https://postimg.cc/7C13q65k). Devan said he loved my work etc, later on would routinely praise my work ethic and results.

In short, many people lied and tried to cover it up as ""miscommunications""  
This started with BlushClipss and the twitch mod team  
[https://www.instagram.com/blushclipss/](https://www.instagram.com/blushclipss/)

[https://www.instagram.com/angelizzee/](https://www.instagram.com/angelizzee/)  
[https://www.instagram.com/starbearez/](https://www.instagram.com/starbearez/)  
BlushClipss/ian got a DM from Kevin. He asked me a lot of questions/wanted advice, how to handle the twitch mods, pay, many other things. I have all of our DMs ready to post but I'll wait first to see if they catch themselves in a lie. BlushClipss glazed me, said how great I am and how much [he wanted to keep me around, said how professional and knowledgeable I was](https://imgur.com/a/BeQbsRg), he also told me everything was completely [private (which I never even asked him to](https://imgur.com/a/7vS21J3), he himself went out of his way to swear this)

then a few hours later ghosted me, told our entire ""private"" conversation to the mods but lied and put out false accusations of me talking crazy/being weird/inappropriate/difficult to work with. This is a direct contradiction to what he said right before to me, a lie. He did this because he gave the mods his account login to share and he was afraid of being caught being 2 faced and acting weird.  
He deliberately deleted his messages to hide this. The mods say he ""lost access"" to his copy of our DMs after he gave them the login.  
IG messages are stored in the cloud. They're not erased even if you delete/deactivate your account. The only way to delete your messages is to go through and manually delete your copy of the conversation. This, combined with IanBC saying things to me and doing the exact opposite hours later is very clear proof that he directly lied and deleted his messages so he wouldn't be caught being two-faced and weird. Again, if the team wants to run their mouth I'll happily go through every single message with ianBlushClipss and narrate it, see how many lies they get caught in

Again, BlushClipss/ian¬†[admitted](https://postimg.cc/B8yJCtdG)¬†to all of this [multiple times](https://imgur.com/a/wkchW6P), but called it a [""miscommunication""](https://imgur.com/TWjb8NG) and blamed it on his mental health

The next section is about the twitch mods, here is¬†[all of the DM](https://youtu.be/Q187L1BGub8)s with the twitch mods,¬†[part 2](https://youtu.be/JOY7AwKlds8)¬†and¬†[part 3](https://youtube.com/shorts/naXlWxtRQgw)

Originally this post was more detailed on the mistakes the mods made, but I've recently learned they're glorified interns so I'll be faster here

After he spoke to Kevin, BlushClipss/ian ghosted me, added the mods, told the lies, they blackballed me and decided to silently remove me from the group without talking to me or Devan Manley. Days later I noticed something was wrong so I asked Devan.¬†[He was surprised](https://postimg.cc/nsgwsTZJ)¬†because they made an iMessage chat together and he thought I was already in it. Again, let me repeat, Devan Manley thought I was officially on payroll with the mods in the exclusive iMessage groupchat. Devan Manley also thought that I had his phone number, so there is no denying in any way that I was both officially recognized and an actual blush affiliate that did official authorized work for them.

The issue is that his mods removed me and blackballed me without telling him. Anyways, when I asked Devan what happened he asked the mods and Ian lied, they repeated what Ian told them, unknowingly spreading those lies.  
Again, I knew something was still wrong since Devan never responded. I confront the mods later and that's where it was confirmed BlushClipss/ian spread a lot of lies about me. He admitted to this multiple times and took full responsibility, but called it a ""miscommunication"" which is patently not true. All of the twitch mods¬†[acknowledged](https://postimg.cc/PLZd2dhp)¬†I did nothing wrong, that they were [misinformed](https://imgur.com/a/dIeVPeN), and that it was not my fault and my name was cleared and the whole thing was a ""mistake""

the issue is that after this I asked to be added to the iMessage and main group and they chose to [keep me removed](https://imgur.com/a/xpYQFSV) anyways. It seemed things were resolved so I kept working as I was told, except they never informed Devan everything they told him about me was a lie. So unless I'm mistaken somehow, at this point the entire twitch mod team is collectively lying by omission to cover up their mistakes while still blackballing me.

I'll refrain from posting all of my DMs with Devan Manley but if the validity of what I say is called into question that can change.

I confront Devan about this and make it known¬†[at the very start](https://postimg.cc/Th4SBRBw), me not being paid is an issue. He assures me he wants to keep me around, loves my work, values my work ethic, and he will work to find a resolution.  
The issue is that he never did, and every time I asked him about the resolution, he pawned me off to the twitch mods and had me try to ""work it out"" with them

Unsurprisingly, the people that decided to ruin my life for no reason and kept ruining my life for 0 personal gain, did not decide to stop ruining my life when I asked them. So again I was blackballed.  
At one point I called Devan and Saint and I was assured again that my work was good, they acknowledged I have ""insane work ethic"" and then told me they wanted to find a resolution.  
The twitch mods kept me removed anyways but told me they would repost a video if I asked. I tried to play this way for a bit, give Devan some time because he's ""busy"" but after this point he would routinely ignore me as much as possible and give me dismissive 3 word replies occasionally.

It never went anywhere, reposts did nothing and I still wasn't being paid even though I made it known this was an issue many weeks before and I was assured that despite the busy schedule they still wanted me around and were looking for a resolution. Finally I gave in, saw that me editing would not go anywhere anymore. I do graphic design and video editing at a professional level. I do many other things, very good with music and mixing, I have a lot of background in writing and design, especially cinematography as well as film, many many other things etc.

Aside from the many things I do besides editing, now I'll go into detail about the breakdown of rates, hours, work, etc.

As seen¬†[HERE,](https://www.youtube.com/@BlushTX/videos)¬†the month+ I was actively working they streamed for at least 40 hours. Have to go through the entire stream, cut it down, an hour to edit the videos, an hour to finalize, export, thumbnails, posting miscellaneous stuff. At least 2 hours per day in addition to the 40 ish it takes to go through the streams, conservative estimate let's be generous and say I did 90 hours of work.  
BEGINNER rates for an absolute entry level editor are \~20$ an hour, which I am NOT.  
Experienced editors easily charge 50-100 minimum as far as hourly rates, but I know this is a lot simpler and faster than long form video editing so obviously I as a professional know not to charge that, especially since I'm working here with a burgeoning collective that I wanted to grow with.

Any standard editor's rates for shorts would be more like at least 30-40 an hour.  
I wouldn't charge anything near this, which says a lot about my ethic and professionalism (especially considering for many other people it would easily take them up to twice as long to edit these) and also the edits were more complex before I was told to tone down the editing.

So I, as a decent person and professional, recognize charging high rates wouldn't make sense especially since I'm working with a group/company that's starting up. Anyone else would charge 50-100 per hour for editing, 30-40 minimum for shorts and many people, I think, would struggle to get as much work done as I have.

So I would say at least 20$ for the hours I worked is more than fair, a steal in value. That's 1,800 for a month of highly specialized work in addition to all of the other cancerous drama I was forced to deal with. Barely more than a fast food worker gets paid despite this being a highly sought after learned trade/skill in addition to running social media.  
Not to mention as far as editing rates this is just charging near indentured servitude wages in exchange for efficient high quality professional work.

Let's talk numbers. Devan Manley's paid twitch jockeys post 9ish videos per week with 100 viewers ready to clip moments for them at all times. In half a day, I made 14 videos and went back and re-edited all previous videos at the request of Devan. In half a day I did 2x as much work at a much higher quality than his entire team did put together over a week, so despite his twitch mods barely making money, this is different and I am operating at a professional level and need to be paid.

They also can't edit longer moments or reoccurring parts of a stream, 90% just 5 seconds videos a viewer on twitch clipped. The 4 of them after 2 months have 105 videos, I have 40 videos posted and a few dozen more nearly edited in my project file, I've deleted probably 10 or more, privated some videos, scrapped some others, so about 80-90 videos posted or ready to be posted, I could already see the writing on the wall and I knew what was coming so I slowed down a little while waiting for the 'resolutions' and worked on other things including editing up a couple longer form videos to try out as well as designing some graphics to show to blush etc.

And I could have said all this, it would have been resolved over a month ago, if literally anyone at all would have taken the time to reply to me. Or someone could have told me to stop, that I'm no longer part of it, instead of pushing me forwards telling me they'd find a solution and keep me on as part of the team.

I am also NOT some random entry level kid editing for the first time. I've spent 100s of hours studying social media etc, I have a throwaway youtube channel where I've racked up over 1 million views in my spare time over the last year and a half. I showed Devan all of this, the results I've gotten independently and the experience I have, so there's no way Devan genuinely thought I was doing all this for free or next to no pay.  
Also, again they praised my work and determination/drive/ethics, etc. so I HIGHLY doubt Devan and everyone else thought I was tweaking over 20 $ for the last 2 months.

Worth noting in a numerical sense it takes the entire twitch team put together a week to do what I do in half a day, and they do it worse. So it is not a question of quality of work either.

A couple weeks after the mods denied me for the final time,

I started tagging Devan trying to set up a quick call to pitch myself. I accepted that my editing wasn't going anywhere and I was still going to be blackballed no matter what I did, so I wanted to talk to him and present myself and what I had to offer outside of running the page and editing so I could actually do something. I had to spam him with stories, he would give a 1 word reply then delay the call, then say I'll call you,[¬†then delay](https://postimg.cc/MXXB0KGZ), then say just text me, then ignore texts and demos I sent, then not read the text he told me to send him.  
I then sent a TLDR and he finally told me there was no work for me. He said he would ""keep me in mind in the future"" and this is off the back of him religiously ignoring me for weeks

which was the final send off saying that I was not working with them anymore and wouldn't in the future either. The issue is no one ever mentioned this and had me keep working for a month+ while telling me a solution was being worked on and reinforcing how good my work was.

After this I finally broke down and¬†[tweaked](https://postimg.cc/gallery/3KKQBM0)¬†out in Devan's DM and he ignored me. Since then I've been tagging him usually once daily until he actually replied and I spoke to him last night and he made it clear I was not going to be paid and I will not get any work or anything else that could compensate for the month+ of work that I did that was promised to be paid and the 2+ months of my life that just went down the drain.  
I tagged him in a¬†[few schizo videos](https://youtu.be/F8goudr0MPQ)¬†on tiktok,  
to test the waters I sent the mods a throwaway video I had lying around to repost to check things, surprisingly they reposted which meant he was keeping quiet on everything but then they were told to take it down and not post or interact with me anymore.  
This was clearly me being blacklisted outright so I started pressing him more about getting paid for the work I did do since clearly there was no future and I needed to be compensated for my time and work.

This led to him finally replying and us having a conversation. I learned the mods are basically interns, he and Saint pay out not Kevin, and that he didn't have any money for me. He said ""Yeah sorry bro idk what to do"" so I said I'll try to think of something.

So I gave Devan the easiest, safest layup imaginable to end this controversy. I would spend my own money to fly to a show, vlog/record it/make a behind the scenes documentary or do interviews etc. A public place with many people where I openly introduce myself in person and do in-person professional film/video work to further earn what I had already earned so this could easily and clearly get resolved in person, etc. This is the easiest most safe solution you could possibly have.

No risk or cost to him, or even blush. I fly myself there. Work for them for a 1 off thing, get paid for doing more professional work instead of just editing streams, then I go home. I'm also not some random creepy anon. My face has been public since day 1, I have history in the blush discord, Devan knows my name and I've actually spoken to him on the phone and worked with him all this time, I've also proven myself responsible by how hard I've worked while having faith in him and following through, how incredibly I've handled this situation privately and peacefully until I started tweaking for the last week or two (in response to him and his employees erasing 2 months of my time, blackballing me, and destroying my life as well as owing $1800+ to me)

Devan, because he does not like me due to me tweaking on him (in response to him ruining my life and stealing from me) declined me. I literally tried to put it all behind us, do professional work that I would front the cost for to justify me getting paid what I was owed, I tried to bury the hatchet and safely and neutrally introduce myself and do 1 off in person professional work at a public event to come together and resolve this peacefully while also giving a professional product and a perfect resolution to everyone.

I asked Devan how that isn't a good idea/isn't doable, after that Devan got a bit more heated and tried to press me, claiming I ""just decided to start editing on my own"" and ""no one asked me to do that"" among other things (which is completely not true and objective horseshit). I then said I understand how stressed he would feel and how it's a complicated idea, so I asked him if he could link me with anyone that could solve this or I could get this idea figured out with and he said no. I asked if he could link me with Kevin to figure something out. This really bothered him and he got mad, went off a lil bit, said no. I said it doesn't make sense to say you don't know me or can't trust me or aren't comfortable when Kevin spoke to IanBlushClipss nearly 2 months ago despite not knowing him at all.

I have literally tried the hardest I possibly could at every point to resolve this peacefully and privately in any and every way possible. At no point has anyone besides me actually cared or even attempted to find a solution here.

Kevin Abstract posted a paid job position. I joined immediately, he recognized me, Devan recognized me, I was brought on officially to work, I then did that work and I made it known from the start me not being paid would be an issue.

I then did do the month of high quality, very efficient editing work as Kevin asked when describing the paid position he posted and advertised multiple times over. I even went above and beyond.

And none of this is even mentioning how the twitch mods got me blackballed for literally no reason, and admitted to it many times, yet they never had to answer for it and I still had everything taken from me and I was mentally tormented for the last 1-2 months despite everyone universally agreeing that I actually didn't do anything wrong.

This has all caused unimaginable stress and emotional turmoil for me. Imagine having your entire life, an entire career path potentially the rest of your life in someone's hands and they just play with it and throw you away like it's nothing. Imagine watching 2+ months of your life go up in flames just because some teenage interns randomly decided to do it for no reason. Imagine being owed minimum $1,800 and the guy that's employed by and best friends with a multimillionaire and multiple platinum artists tells you he can't pay you for the month+ of work you did for him officially.

Yes, this actually has ruined the last 2 months of my life and caused unimaginable stress/anxiety/dread and erased a life changing career path all because Ian(blushclipss) was scared of getting caught being a snake and threw me under the bus to save himself.

I had real authentic faith in Devan for months. I really thought he was just busy and he would pull through like he always said. But I guess he was too¬†[busy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJAQK0yJetw)¬†playing¬†[roblox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXmAIIQ7AWY)¬†and getting matcha to stop ruining my life. This experience has genuinely twisted and warped my mind. I've become much more hateful and I doubt I'll ever be able to truly trust someone again. I wish this could be over. I begged and pleaded to solve this privately, he's held my life in his hands for nearly 2 months and watched as his employees ruined me, but now he sees me as some psychotic tweaker because I briefly freaked out at him once after he stole 90+ hours of my life and much more from me.

Imagine how far I could be right now if I put those 90 hours into making videos for my own actually monetized channel, or worked on my own music for 90 hours, or any other number of things I do.

The twitch mods blackballed me and Devan blacklisted me so even if I wanted to do more work or find a solution outside of this I can't, and he also said repeatedly he won't pay me and ""there's nothing he can do for me"" (which just isn't true)

Kevin is the one who advertised this position and repeatedly requested it, so Kevin should be able to pay me. The mods are on Saint+Dev payroll, that's fine because this is clearly a separate league. I outperformed 4 people put together, I was patient and understanding while letting it be known from week 1 that pay was an issue and I needed to be compensated. I was repeatedly assured at every point that a resolution was being worked towards, but the only resolution was ignoring me and telling me to ask the mods to stop ruining my life. Even then, I tried to work something out with Devan last night because I just want this to be over but every route was shut down.

""WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS PUBLIC, solve it privately"" because I've tried non-stop with everything I had to resolve this privately.

I even made it all as easy as possible for them, told them I didn't even want the mod team to be punished, I just wanted to go back to working and start officially getting paid. Devan would respond once in a while and then defer me to the twitch mods to find a ""resolution"" and, surprisingly, the people who went out of their way to ruin my life for no reason decided to keep doing it after I asked them to stop.

Devan then feigns interest in finding a resolution for a few weeks until he can't be bothered to care anymore and starts routinely ignoring me under the guise of being too busy to schedule an important 10 minute phone call a week in advance, despite routinely playing roblox and going for coffee runs and hang out sessions with his friends as well as streaming constantly

This job was promised with pay, I was brought on officially and officially did work that was officially recognized praised and posted. Devan thought I was already in the imessage chat on payroll, he thought I already had his phone number. There is no denying Kevin Abstract brought people on for this roll, I excelled in a professional setting and worked a lot, and that I was officially a part of the team and officially recognized as working for blush. They may use the excuse of ""there was never a payment agreement"" but that's the whole point. I relentlessly tried to solve this and made it known that was an issue and I was always reassured it would be resolved but then I was ignored.

There is no denying this. I did the work, I did it well and was praised. I put in the time and effort on this paid position but I was put in unimaginable stress by the twitch mods ruining everything, come to find out they basically don't even get paid.  
Kevin Abstract is a multimillionaire, blush raked in \~$160k gross in 1st month streams minimum, they sell 80$ hoodies and the group has multiple platinum artists in it. They can afford to pay me

Any sum I could even think of would be a % of a % of their monthly income. I even suggested to Devan that I could buy a ticket to a texas show, do a behind the scenes vlog/documentary/interviews for the concerts in order to earn that money and prove myself, but he denied me because he didn't feel ""comfortable"" with that because I lightly tweaked in his DMs after him and his employees erased 2 months of my hard work, ruined my life, and blacklisted me from ever getting work in the future as well.

This is just work hours, not counting anything else I've submitted to blush besides that that all went to waste bc I ended up getting blackballed.

All I wanted was a payout and I begged and pleaded for months. Not like I wanted a handout. I just wish I could be compensated and walk away, leave everyone alone and put this behind me but I guess that can't happen.

Moral of the story idk. Don't work for blush ig, lies and ""miscommunications"" lead to biblical fuckups constantly and 2 months of my life have been stolen me. $1,800+ of official work has been stolen from me. 90+ hours I've been made to work for someone else who clearly knew what I was doing and pretended to be ignorant of the situation, and now all I have to show for it is a ""Yeah I'm really sorry bro"" as well as my life being in shambles

I've been used blackballed blacklisted and thrown away in addition to having a group of teenage interns put false accusations on my name.

""Yeah bro I'm sorry bro. Sorry you worked for me for 90 hours and 2+ months of your life went down the drain and you're blackballed, but I don't like you now so I don't want to ask my boss to fix this or get something worked out. Anyways see ya""

Here is a lesson to you all:

immediately do public call outs and expose posts, don't wait hoping someone will become the decent human being they should have been at the start. As soon as someone does something sideways immediately let as many people know as possible. I should have made some expose post like this immediately a month ago, I was stupid to show kindness and patience. Do not give any patience at all to people that are willing to ignore you, do not trust people and especially do not give them wiggle room after they've shown you they don't give a fuck about you. They will keep taking from you, STEALING from you, and when they get bored they'll ruin your life too",1,1754337899.0,u_Substantial_Move9726,0,1.0,False

My instructor was Andrew, and he was great.  He was able to accurately assess where I was lacking within a few laps and then correct the problem.  I thought I was pushing the car but he knew I wasn't out of fear, so he took me to a straight where me made me put the pedal to the floor before teaching me how to brake properly.  I even went around a banked curve a few times so I could feel how easily the car moved and how smoothly momentum shifted.  Then he took me to a slick track where I practiced sliding and controlling the slide with the brake and gas as proactive rather than reactive tools - which then made me understand trailbraking in a way that I hadn't before.  When we went back onto the track I was able to attack corners at much higher speeds, at which point I started to learn the proper line to follow using trailbraking to rotate the car more quickly.  By the time the class ended, I really felt comfortable in the GT3 and definitely am going back to do the serious class next.

I'm 35 years-old, and I've never been on a date. 

I never cared to date when I was younger, and quite frankly, I don't want to date now. 

I enjoy being single, honestly. I have a lot of hobbies I enjoy. I play trivia, I play basketball, I sing, I dance, I read, I write. I have a lot of things I love to do. I enjoy being single, where I can have all my free time and not have to fulfill ""obligations"" that come with dating. I'm asexual, and the thought of having to ""put out"" sexually makes me perturbed, to say the least.

I don't see the reason behind dating. I'm not a person who likes to go out to eat and spend hundreds of dollars on wine and roses. I don't drink alcohol, anyway!, I don't even drink coffee. I just like to do my own thing.

  
Yet, all the time, I constantly get harped on by society and by culture that I'm somehow ""in the wrong"" for not being married and not having kids. I still get judged for being a 35 year-old virgin who has never been in a relationship. I feel like if everyone knew that about me, they'd shame me and call me a loser. I honestly hate it.

  
Sometimes, I just feel like cave in to the societal pressure. Sometimes, I just wonder if I should just try dating and having sex, even though I don't want to. At least in that way, I wouldn't be judged for being an almost 40 year-old virgin.

1mho2xz,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixDocumentaries/comments/1mho2xz/key_questions_in_the_amy_bradley_case/,Key Questions in the Amy Bradley Case,"Brad, add these to your next interview!

1. If the family TRULY believed she was trafficked from the ship, why did they leave to go back home so quickly? Why not stay there and search for her with the help of local authorities? If it was too much for Iva, she could have gone while Brad and Ron stayed. Why leave so shortly after?

2. If Yellow trafficked Amy, why would he wait to do it after she already got back to the room? Brad gets back to the room at 3:35am and Amy at 3:40am, why didn‚Äôt Yellow grab her then? It would have been perfect because she is now separated from her brother and her family is asleep.

3. Why did she have her ID in her pocket? I can link the article in the comments. The article from 1999 says Amy had her drivers license in her pocket. But if she changed into jeans before leaving the room, why would she have transferred that to her pocket?

4. Why does the story always include her taking her yellow polo off and setting it on the chair? She was wearing the white tshirt she had on under the yellow polo in the camera footage from the night club. Did she take it off and put it back on and then take it off again?

5. Were the curtains drawn that night? Because if Ron sees her ‚Äúfrom the hips down‚Äù at 5:30am and then she‚Äôs gone at 6am, he would have had to physically get up and look and then could have seen her whole body. Don‚Äôt people usually draw the curtains before going to sleep on a cruise? And if the door was closed at 5:30am and then it was open at 6am, wouldn‚Äôt that have been loud and windy? Wouldn‚Äôt the curtain be flapping in the wind waking you all up?

6. If Amy did go overboard for ANY reason, it would have had to happen between 5:30-6am. But wasn‚Äôt that when the ship was docking? Wouldn‚Äôt there be a good amount of people out on their balconies watching the ship come into port? Wouldn‚Äôt it be much more likely someone would see her fall at that time? They were on the 8th floor I believe, seems like someone would see her fall.

7. If she truly went overboard, again, it would have had to happen between 5:30-6am but the ship was almost docked and was completely docked by 6am. It seems like her body would have been pretty easy to find at that point. 

8. Ron wakes up at 5:30am and sees Amy and then at 6am doesn‚Äôt see Amy. Why go look for her immediately if you truly thought she was out getting coffee or taking pictures? Why not sleep longer and just wait for her to come back. Sounds like you woke up a lot that night but Iva did not.

But no, Ron freaks out after looking anywhere from 30-90mins, depending on which narrative you read, and then reports her missing to a staff member even before he gets back to the room. He never asks Iva or Brad if Amy told them she was going somewhere. He never has the family split up and cover more ground looking for her. They immediately report her missing! Why?? Ron‚Äôs own quote from Netflix was something like, ‚Äúthe ship has 10 stories and a thousand rooms, she could be anywhere.‚Äù

Other points:
Something this case has now that it has never had at this level in the past is online sleuthing. Yeah, it makes people jump to conclusions and gets a bad wrap but just look at the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Fuck with Cats‚Äù documentary! It doesn‚Äôt always look pretty, but it can work!

* San Francisco area to Des Moines, Iowa (\~1,840 miles)
* \~27 hour drive, one way, without stops or charging
* Stops planned for Salt Late City and Denver (for sleeping, resting, decent enough plumbing for showering and other needs)
* EV charging stops planned (not pictured)
* Food and car recharging budgeted for
* Avoids tolls

Questions:

* Any recommended stops along the way to see unique (enough) things?
   * Preferably not too far off from the pictured route, if at all
   * Nature, natural scenery/views, quirky ""can't be found/seen anywhere else"" stops
   * Unique food destination(s) that stick out, like a roadside diner or something
   * I'd probably get post cards at best, do those still exist at gift shops?
* Hotel recommendations for SLC and Denver?
   * Hilton Honors member
   * Does **not** need to be a Hyatt or Four Seasons in quality or price
      * Budget's not that flexible
   * Very much preferably **not** a motel or the like
      * Budget's maybe a tiny bit flexible
      * I can't shake some semblance of safety/security for me and my car
   * Breakfast included is fine, but I won't be thinking about taking part in any hotel spa things
   * Idea's to stay in something mid to lower mid tier for SLC, and mid to upper mid tier in Denver
      * Open to being slightly fancier for the Denver stop
   * Wouldn't mind them being near local walkable/drivable points of interest
* Any tips for staying awake during the drive?
   * Being well rested of course, before setting out on each leg, and I'd stop any time I feel I need to
   * I've thought of Red Bull and/or coffee, but I also don't want to find myself needing plumbing at a bad time/location
   * Mint/peppermint gum maybe?
* Driving tips for particular climates/areas?
   * Trip goes near Tahoe, and through Reno, neither of which I want to stop at or in
   * If and/or when I come across any construction zones, barring completely stopped traffic or close enough detours, I'm planning on just staying the course, to mitigate getting lost

1mhnznc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gravenhurst/comments/1mhnznc/pine_lake_cottages_review/,Pine Lake Cottages Review,"Just stayed here with a small group and want to share our experience. 

We stayed in cabin #3 aka Sugar Pine.

  
**The good:**

\- great location, only a 10-15 minute drive to a Tim Hortons, Home Hardware. gas station, Canadian Tire, The Kee to Bala etc.

\- cozy property right on Pine Lake which was great to swim in and you can also canoe, kayak, and go boating on it. Reportedly good for bass fishing.

\- there are 12 little cottages and a large house on this property, so lots of help/company from other guests which was comforting as we were a group of women on our first trip up North ourselves.

\- our cabin was shockingly clean. Not a single speck of dirt or any bugs. There was even a fly swatter supplied.

\- our cabin was unexpectedly well stocked. 2 rolls of toilet paper, a hand towel in the bathroom with hand soap, dish soap and sponge, toaster, coffee maker, microwave, tons of bowls, plates, mugs, glasses, and various kitchen tools including a selection of pots and pans. A smoke alarm, carbon monoxide alarm, box fan, and new fire extinguisher were provided.

\- the shower was good - great water pressure, would fit someone 6 ft, the bathroom was roomy etc.

\- linens were clean and no sign of bed bugs

\- the couch, recliner, and dining table were old but solid and comfy. Reminded us of our grandparent's furniture growing up.

\- the screens in the windows were in perfect condition and we had great air flow. It was not hot at all in our cabin which we were pleasantly surprised by.

\- our firepit had a load of firewood ready for us. Unfortunately it was either pressure treated wood or branches too long and thick that you would need to use a saw to cut them up.

\- some of the cabins have been recently renovated. They looked quite nice and were right on the water. 



**The bad:**

\- this property apparently had a great reputation for many years but the beloved owners retired and sold the property to a corporation. The new owners are Lake Front Resorts and appear to own at least 8 other properties.

\- the office and game house are completely abandoned. The children's playground is overgrown and unusable. The dock is old and falling apart and even has a sign to stay off as it is under repairs (right...). The garden beds are full of overgrown weeds. The gazebo is just a rusty frame. Their main website advertises badminton and a horse shoe pit but we didn't see much of anything beyond an overgrown patch of grass?

\- There are kayaks/canoes ""for guest use"" but they look to be in ROUGH shape. I wasn't willing to chance it. Bring your own!

\- we booked through Air BnB and did not receive any communication prior to arrival other than confirmation of booking. When we arrived we wandered around this abandoned looking property until we had to approach other guests to ask for help. They informed us of the sad situation here. They also caught us up to speed on how to check in... every cabin has a key in a lock box, and we should've received an email with the code. We did not... so we were led to a cabin which houses two women who are the only staff on site. They are friendly however one is Russian and one is Ukrainian and they do not speak English. You must use a translator app to communicate with them to tell them the cabin number you need the code for and they will recite the code for you. Sometimes it is easier for them to type the code for you on your phone as they get their English numbers mixed up. They are kind of friendly though and will smile and wave. They know a few words like code, cabin, key, today, tomorrow, and thank you. Beyond that, good luck.

\- the Russian woman showed up at our cabin one morning demanding our key. She seemed to think we were leaving that day. I was able to communicate that it was actually ""tomorrow"" and she left us alone. The doors auto-lock though, so I'm glad I didn't just hand over the key as we would've been locked out.

\- the only complaint we had for our cabin was the floor. It was a very old cabin and the floor was very uneven. If you dropped a bottle of water you would be picking it up on the other side of the cabin. None of us were brave enough to fully stand in the shower as the floor was very spongey.

\- we did not have a picnic table on our site as advertised

\- we heard reports of some folks arriving or almost arriving and being informed that their cabin had been double booked. I can see that these cottages are listed on multiple sites so I could see how this could happen.

\- we heard reports that the renovated cabins were not very well stocked with kitchen supplies.

\- we were warned by other guests not to drink the water. luckily we had brought our own.

\- this place runs purely on the generosity and kindness of the guests who help each other out. My group found ourselves assisting a new car load of buddies just looking to spend a relaxing weekend together. Once we accompanied them to the caretaker's cabin and received the code, they were shocked to realize that they had been given a studio cabin instead of a 2 bedroom. I believe they ended up calling Airbnb for a refund and left after driving 3 hours to get there.

\- they advertised our cabin as not having wifi or hot water. We had both? There was also baseboard heating but we did not turn it on. Wifi password is lakefrontresorts which, surprise, we only knew because some other guests shared that with us.

\- the garbage bin. There was a sign in our cabin that told us not to take garbage out after 7:30 pm as they remove the bin each night to protect us from bears. This sign must've been from the old owners as the bin stayed open and OVERFLOWING all weekend. Seriously, it stunk to high heavens and wasn't even being locked at night. This was probably the most disturbing part of our stay and I'm not sure how they've gotten away with it and how it hasn't caused a serious issue with wildlife.

\- their Google reviews are odd. There are many 1-4 star reviews with photos/evidence and concerns that match what I shared. Then there are tons of Russian comments that give it 5 stars and refer to odd things like chefs, bike paths, pools etc. I believe these are fake reviews.

  
**Overall:**

This is an OK spot to stay if you need a cheap and laidback option for a small group of people. The lake itself is great, the location is great, the renovated cabins seem great. But there is ZERO pride of ownership now which is the trade off. I imagine the previous owners are sick over knowing what has happened to their pride and joy. 

We all agreed that we would probably stay here again seeing that it is only about $150 a night and we can easily split that between 3 people which makes it very affordable. The potential for this property is incredible though, someone could easily fix this place up, charge much more, and make this a luxurious getaway. If only!

I‚Äôm a 32 years old single man living in the Middle East. My dream is to move to the US one day and start a family, I can‚Äôt wait to one day get up in the morning make my future husband coffee, and cook him and our kids meals. My dream is to be a stay-at-home husband, not out of laziness or not wanting to work, but because my dad was never present in my life and I had a pretty fucked up childhood so I want to be present in my kids lives. 

Though for me to be able to be a stay-at-home husband, I need to have passive income coming to ensure being able to sustain a healthy lifestyle for me and for my future family. And I want to leave them some generational wealth considering how expensive life is in the US. I don‚Äôt want to bring kids to life and not set them up for success, financially speaking (without spoiling them ofc). For that reason, right now I‚Äôm living WAY below my means, I‚Äôm saving and investing aggressively. I rarely go out and I‚Äôm pretty much cooking every meal at home. Just bought my first rental property and I plan to buy another one before moving to the US so that can supplement my passive income. The timeline is 3-4 years from now. 

I‚Äôm just worried about missing so much on life right now, and worrying that I‚Äôll be too old to have kids when I move out there.

I work at a mid-sized customs brokerage firm and wanted to share something that‚Äôs quietly made a huge difference in our daily ops.

* A clean summary (HTML format, ready for reports or email)
* Total values, weight, top tariff items
* Parsed data automatically inserted into a spreadsheet
* Support for multiple languages (we use English mostly)
* No login, no new software ‚Äî just Telegram

It‚Äôs honestly wild how fast it is. Before, we were manually opening invoices, calculating totals, and copying into Excel. Now it‚Äôs done before my coffee finishes brewing lol.

I don‚Äôt even know who made it ‚Äî some AI automation firm I think ‚Äî but it plugs perfectly into our workflow without needing IT approval or training. Not trying to sell anything, just wondering if anyone else is using bots/AI for this kind of stuff?

1mhnt39,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mhnt39/the_white_room/,The White Room,"# I. Admission

The wind was sharp that day, late autumn cold with no snow, just gray sky and the smell of wet pine. The kind of wind that rattles windows even when they‚Äôre sealed shut. That‚Äôs the wind that greeted **Martin Reddick** when they led him through the gates of **St. Eligius Psychiatric Facility**, an old Victorian hospital carved into the side of a cliff where the forest refused to grow. The building had once been a sanitarium for tuberculosis, then an asylum, then a rehab center. Now it was something nameless. The locals just called it ""the Red Place.""

Martin didn‚Äôt resist. He walked calmly between the two orderlies, looking up at the building‚Äôs cracked red-brick face with a small, fascinated smile.

""Do you see it?"" he asked.

No one answered.

Inside, fluorescent lights flickered faintly in the hallways. Paint peeled from walls like molted skin. The air smelled of antiseptic and something else, damp, fungal, feral. Martin‚Äôs room was on the bottom floor of **Ward D**, deep in the bowels of the facility, where no daylight ever reached.

Two other patients lived in the same corridor.

**Dana Kessler**, age 28, already in her fourth month of isolation. Her mirror had been removed weeks ago, yet she still spoke to it.

**Abel Novak**, age 46, never said a word. He stared through people, as if watching something perched just behind them. He had a history; he had strangled his younger brother to death and then painted the floor in perfect circles using the boy‚Äôs blood.

Martin‚Äôs arrival completed the triad.

# II. Dana‚Äôs Mirror

Dana wasn‚Äôt always like this. There were photos of her in her case file, bright-eyed, laughing with friends at a coffee shop, holding a puppy, all normal things.

Now, she sat in the corner of her room with her knees pulled up to her chest, mumbling to the wall where the mirror had once been. Sometimes she screamed. Sometimes she sang in a child‚Äôs voice.

""She crawled through the glass... With fingers made of cracks... She lives where the silence goes...""

The nurses learned to ignore her. They‚Äôd see her talking to her reflection long after they‚Äôd taken the mirror away. Her file included drawings, dozens of them, of a long-limbed woman with no mouth, her face a smooth reflective surface.

Dana called her **Kira.**

‚ÄúShe says she‚Äôs real now,‚Äù Dana whispered to Martin one day through the thin, padded walls. ‚ÄúShe says the glass was just a waiting room.‚Äù

# III. Martin‚Äôs Code

Martin didn‚Äôt hallucinate in the traditional way. He didn‚Äôt see demons or hear voices, not like the others. His mind worked like a machine misfiring at specific intervals, clicking into bizarre understanding.

He called it **decoding.**

‚ÄúEvery word has a shadow,‚Äù he explained to the night nurse, a kind-eyed woman named Silvia who still believed in redemption. ‚ÄúAnd the shadows make patterns. You just have to know the rhythm.‚Äù

Silvia played along at first. Then he started writing things. Strings of nonsense phrases. Weird syllables stitched together like incantations. Staff psychiatrist **Dr. Harrow** dismissed it as disorganized speech, classic schizophrenia.

But the more Martin wrote, the worse the ward got.

Electrical outages became common. Rats were found dead in the vents, their mouths filled with hair. One orderly, Luis, suffered a seizure while mopping near Martin‚Äôs door. He claimed he saw a **woman made of mirrors** crawling on the ceiling.

Martin just smiled.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs listening now,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúDana opened the gate. Abel will feed her.‚Äù

# IV. Abel‚Äôs Silence

Abel hadn‚Äôt spoken in years. He sat on the edge of his bed, unmoving, staring at the floor.

He didn‚Äôt need to speak. Not when **they** spoke through him.

The nurses began finding strange drawings in his room: circles filled with teeth, a single closed eye surrounded by lines of what looked like sewn lips. One sketch showed Martin‚Äôs face with no eyes. Another showed Dana hanging from the ceiling by her hair.

No one knew how he got the materials. His crayons had been confiscated weeks ago.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs move him,‚Äù suggested one nurse. But Dr. Harrow refused.

‚ÄúWe need to understand the convergence.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt clear what he meant. But he began visiting the three patients more frequently, always late at night. Always alone.

# V. The Night of the Red Moon

The blood moon rose without fanfare. A dull, rust-colored sphere hovering over the forest like a bruised eye. Animals went still. The wind died.

Inside St. Eligius, the power flickered once... then went out completely.

Silence swallowed Ward D.

At exactly **3:33 a.m.**, the doors of all three patient rooms clicked open.

Martin stepped out first, barefoot, murmuring to himself: ‚Äú**Glass mind. Cut through. Red tongue. Open door.**‚Äù

Dana followed, her skin glistening with sweat, eyes wide with terror and awe. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs here. Kira‚Äôs here. She‚Äôs *me* now.‚Äù

Abel did not walk. He *glided*, it seemed, dragging his fingers along the wall, leaving behind a dark, oily trail. His eyes were rolled back, whites trembling.

Security footage caught **one** image before the cameras died: A tall, skeletal figure walking down the hallway behind the three patients. Its face, a flat, silver disc. Its limbs, impossibly long, twitching. And its eyes, three of them, stacked vertically, burning red through the darkness.

# VI. Discovery

By morning, it was over.

Martin was found in his room, sitting in a pool of blood, eyes gouged out with his own fingers. He smiled at the nurse and said, ‚ÄúNow I see her too.‚Äù

Dana hung from the ceiling, suspended by her own braided hair. Tiny mirror shards were embedded in her skin, forming letters across her stomach: **SHE SEES YOU WHEN YOU FORGET TO BLINK**

Abel was gone. Not escaped, *gone*. His bed untouched. No trace. No blood. No prints. Just a symbol carved into the concrete where he once sat: (*The Eye Closed in Thought*)

# VII. Dr. Harrow‚Äôs Final Notes

*They aren‚Äôt hallucinating. I see it now. Abel was the anchor. Martin, the key. Dana, the gate. Together, they opened it, whatever IT is. Not a demon. Not a god. Something older. Something that speaks in reflections and static and words we haven‚Äôt invented yet.*

*I see my own reflection blinking when I don‚Äôt. I think I left something behind the glass.*

*I‚Äôm going to Ward D tonight. I need to see her. I need to understand. If you find this, don‚Äôt trust thought. Don‚Äôt say the words out loud. And for God‚Äôs sake,*¬†

*Don‚Äôt blink.*

# VIII. Postscript

St. Eligius was shut down within the month. The official reason was asbestos. Locals don‚Äôt believe it. Neither do the families of the nurses who vanished during cleanup.

Sometimes, under the light of a red moon, people claim they hear whispers in the woods near the old facility. Strange patterns carved into trees. A flash of silver just beneath the surface of still water.

Some say if you listen closely‚Ä¶ really closely‚Ä¶ You can hear three voices, overlapping, harmonizing.

They say the White Room still breathes. And it's *listening*.

1mhnsh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByteTheRightThing/comments/1mhnsh0/explore_best_gaming_keyboards_is_magegee_ts91/,Explore Best Gaming Keyboards Is MageGee TS91 Worth It or Not,"MageGee's TS91 keyboard has been a solid addition to my daily work and gaming setup. With its ultra-compact design and vibrant RGB backlight, it caught my attention immediately. Having spent considerable time using it, I‚Äôm here to share the highs and lows of this 60% keyboard, which combines style, functionality, and certain quirks.

**Compact and Ergonomic Design**

The MageGee TS91 keyboard is delightfully compact, sporting a 60% layout that‚Äôs perfect for my somewhat crowded desk. By ditching the Numpad, the keyboard frees up a lot of space, making gaming sessions or intense multi-tab working feel less cramped. Its key height is tailored with ergonomic considerations in mind, which translates to reduced fatigue even after hours of use. In my case, long reports or late-night gaming marathons didn‚Äôt leave my hands feeling sore, which was a pleasant surprise for a product at this price point.

**RGB Backlighting That Shines**

This keyboard‚Äôs RGB backlighting feature is an absolute win for someone as obsessed with ambiance as I am. You can toggle between various color combinations and even adjust the brightness to your taste. The breathing light mode feels futuristic, adding charm to those late-night gaming sprees. Even without external lights in my room, the keyboard's glow made it easy to spot the keys. My younger brother, a hardcore gamer, loved how customizable the light settings were. It definitely adds flair to any setup.

[Check MageGee TS91 price on Amazon.](https://genericprint.com/p/b08f7gzdt2/)

**Mechanical Feeling Without Breaking the Bank**

The MageGee TS91 might not be a full mechanical keyboard, but it comes impressively close with its membrane-based design that mimics a mechanical feel. Typing feels crisp and precise, although I did notice the keys weren‚Äôt as clicky as I prefer. It may not satisfy hardcore mechanical keyboard purists, but for the price, it strikes a great balance. My coworker commented on the sound being mid-range‚Äînot too soft to feel lifeless and not distractingly loud either, which made it office-friendly.

**Waterproof Circuit Board Makes Life Easier**

Spills? No big deal. The IPX4-certified waterproof circuit board was tested in my household sooner than expected when my coffee-laden hands decided to test its durability. It's not waterproof at the interface, but cleaning up was a breeze, and most importantly, the keyboard survived. This feature is perfect for clumsy folks like me or those who often enjoy snacks and drinks at their desk. Who knew peace of mind could come from a keyboard?

**Wide Compatibility Across Platforms**

Setting up the TS91 was also easy-peasy. I used it on my Windows 10 PC, but it's also compatible with older versions, including Windows 7, XP, and even Vista. It works flawlessly with my PS4 and my MacBook, which makes it highly versatile. Switching devices is as simple as plugging it in and watching it do its thing. It balances utility across gaming and office work quite well.

**Strengths**
- Compact size, perfect for smaller desks or tighter spaces.
- Vibrant, customizable RGB lighting options.
- Ergonomic key height minimizes strain during prolonged use.
- Waterproof circuit board offers protection against accidental spills.
- Broad compatibility with both gaming consoles and computers.

**Key Concerns**
- No dedicated Numpad, which might be inconvenient for heavy spreadsheet work.
- The imitation mechanical feel may not satisfy dedicated mechanical keyboard fans.
- While spill-resistant, the USB interface isn‚Äôt waterproof, so caution is still required.

**Product Competitors**

In a market flooded with similarly styled 60% keyboards, the MageGee TS91 holds its ground well, though it's worth comparing to rivals like the Razer Huntsman Mini or the HyperX Alloy Origins Core. The Razer Huntsman, for example, offers genuine optical switches and premium build quality‚Äîbut at a substantially higher price. On the other hand, the HyperX keyboard delivers similar compactness but focuses more on durability with an aluminum frame. The TS91 doesn‚Äôt claim to dethrone these heavyweights but instead provides a budget-friendly, feature-rich package for those not ready to splurge.

**True Value**

For someone seeking an affordable option with premium aesthetics and satisfactory functionality, this gaming keyboard strikes a wonderful balance. While it doesn't boast fully mechanical switches or top-tier build materials, its lightweight build, RGB customization, and compatibility make it worth considering for budget-conscious gamers. At the end of the day, investing in this keyboard saved me enough money to later upgrade my mouse without feeling guilty.

The tenants have a designated binstore, so we don‚Äôt really use the bin in question. A year ago, I asked the management company to get rid of the bin outside as foxes would tear thru the plastic binbags, and dirty the street, especially when its windy.

I confirmed with the local environmental councillor/council waste team, and they said since it‚Äôs on private land, the binmen are not responsible for collecting the bin bags that people toss on the floor. Nor is the council the one who can remove the bin.

The management company has ignored me throughout. They sometimes send contractors to clean the area, but that encourages fly-tipping even more as people think somebody is cleaning it. How do I proceed? My landlord has also tried getting the management company to take action, but to no avail.

Next hearing August 5th.","A Wisconsin woman tried to kill her father while she was hallucinating he was the living embodiment of the devil, Badger State police say.

Jamie Anderson, 34, stands accused of one count of attempted intentional homicide in the first degree by use of a dangerous weapon. The charge includes a domestic abuse assessment ‚Äì which might be considered essentially akin to a minor sentencing enhancement.

The incident occurred on July 1, at the father's home on South Page Street in Stoughton ‚Äì a small town located roughly 20 miles southeast of Madison, according to the Stoughton Police Department.

During the early morning hours, Anderson allegedly walked some 16 miles from her Madison apartment to her father's residence.

Then came the ring at the doorbell.

When the defendant's father finally awoke and answered the door, Anderson first said she wanted to stop hallucinating, according to a criminal complaint obtained by Madison-based CBS and MyNetworkTV

""I'm going to kill you,"" the defendant allegedly repeated.

The two then fought as the scuffle continued inside.

The woman's father told responding officers he eventually had to push his daughter over a coffee table so he could escape to safety.

At around 6 a.m., officers found the man on his front stoop with blood on his left arm, according to the complaint.

""She actually came here to kill me,"" the man explained to police.

Anderson's father said his daughter was still somewhere inside the house, police say. The defendant was discovered walking down a stairway on the side of the house into an alleyway, knife in hand. When asked to drop the orange-colored blade, the defendant immediately complied and was arrested without incident, police say.

Anderson allegedly told police she hallucinates and thought her father was the ""devil."" She then allegedly went on to admit to cutting or slashing him roughly four times. The defendant allegedly further admitted her plan was to kill him because she wanted him dead.

The woman's father suffered serious injuries from the attack ‚Äì resulting in staples in his head and surgery on one arm. In comments to police, he allegedly struck a somewhat conciliatory tone, saying the incident was ""not her"" and that her ""mind is cooked"" due to drug use.

Anderson first appeared in court on July 25, where her bond was set at $500,000 ‚Äì with a no-contact order regarding her father in the event she makes bail, court records show. She has been appointed a public defender and is next slated to appear in court on Aug. 5.

The defendant is detained in the Dane County Jail as of this writing. affiliate WISC and ABC affiliate WKOW.

Next, Anderson is said to have asked her father for a hug. In response, however, her father said he asked her if she was on drugs.

That question allegedly prompted Anderson to try and stab her father in the head, according to the complaint. Multiple stabbing attempts allegedly ensued, and some of those efforts drew blood, police say.",1,1754337008.0,CasesWeFollow,0,1.0,False

You‚Äôve worked the line when the fryer died, the bartender no-called, and the expo lost the check for Table 9. Seattle‚Äôs July drizzled. So, before we even get to the numbers, let‚Äôs be clear: this isn‚Äôt a silver-lining piece. It‚Äôs a raw walk through 2025‚Äôs gauntlet, with a roadmap for the joint that refuses to close.

**The Economy Is Punching Back Hard!**

Optimistic? You‚Äôll only find it in boardrooms and government press releases. On the street? The story‚Äôs rougher and grittier. The pace of the economy has slowed. In June 2025, restaurants added just 6,500 jobs, and July saw a slight net loss of 300 positions in ""eating and drinking places,"" highlighting a stall in hiring momentum during mid-summer^(1). For context, in May and June of this year, both were downwardly revised to just 19,000 and 14,000 new foodservice jobs added, respectively. Restaurant jobs usually post bigger numbers as everyone is getting ready for increased summer traffic. Much less so this year.

Seattle is not alone in feeling the burn, where more than half of local operators lost money in 2024, two out of three watched sales drop or flatline at the top of 2025, and nearly 90% hiked prices just to keep their heads above water^(3). More than 40% cut hours. Almost half let people go. The ‚ÄúGreat Resignation‚Äù morphed into the ‚ÄúGreat Stay,‚Äù but staff levels in full-service are still 226,000 bodies under pre-pandemic levels nationwide, and it shows in closed sections and mounting burnout^(4).

**Recession**

Fast food giants like McDonald‚Äôs posted their largest same-store sales drop since 2020. CEO Chris Kempczynski bluntly says low-income customers have vanished, double-digit declines, and middle-income traffic is shrinking, too. The same goes for Wendy‚Äôs, Starbucks, Domino‚Äôs, and Chipotle. Hike prices, lose traffic. Hold prices, lose margins. Either way, the volume‚Äôs down and nobody‚Äôs smiling at the pass^(5).

Seattle‚Äôs minimum wage increased to $20.76 an hour, no tip credit, no small-business relief. That‚Äôs a 20% labor cost surge for every joint^(6). Anyone who says this is just ‚Äúa bump‚Äù hasn‚Äôt done a Friday double at a 1,600-square-foot independent with a staff of six. Wage laws, rising food costs, and lower guest counts, it‚Äôs the holy trinity of pressure for operators from Belltown to Rainier Beach.

**Less Tipping, Slower Growth, Shrinking Margins**

Square‚Äôs latest report is a gut punch for anyone who depends on tips to make rent. The average tip for food and beverage transactions hit 15.17% in Q1 and dipped again to 14.99% in Q2 2025. At bars, tips slipped from 17.36% to 16.96%; at full-service, from 14.76% to 14.64%. The drop shadows a countrywide dip in consumer confidence, and with tips making up nearly a quarter of a line cook‚Äôs or server‚Äôs income in 2024, that‚Äôs a direct hit to retention and morale^(7).

Restaurants that tried to float profits with 15%+ menu increases? They lost customers and tanked their public perceptions^(8). Value deals are now back in vogue, even as food and pour costs keep climbing. Beef, chicken, coffee, and veggies all posted double-digit increases, only things like potatoes and flour held steady^(9).

Full-service restaurant jobs, the jobs that anchor every neighborhood‚Äôs local, are still below 2019. Growth is now squarely in quick-service, snack, and coffee shop employment¬π.

**The Ruthless Playbook**

National and local governments won‚Äôt save you. The consumer who adored your house burger in 2022 is pinching pennies and tipping less in 2025. The game has changed.

**What Works Now:**

**Raise Prices, Smartly:**¬†Nearly everyone is doing it, but avoid big, blunt hikes, every bump above 10% costs you traffic^(11). Get tactical, smaller, frequent changes tied to clear value, limited-time offers, and tweak high-cost plates around seasonal or lower-cost items that feel premium.

**Cut Hours, Not Quality:**¬†If Monday lunch never breaks even, axe it before you have to ax a shift. 47% of Seattle joints already have^(3). Focus on prime service windows.

**Staffing: Be Ruthlessly Honest About Coverage:**¬†Burnout and turnover are cheaper than headline layoffs, but only in the short run. Invest in your core crew; cross-train and reward reliability.

**Service Charges Vs. Tipping:**¬†The big switch is on, especially in high-wage towns like Seattle. Consider switching from tipping to service charges, but beware, customers hate being surprised. Be prepared to explain the why, and stay consistent.

**Lean Into Experience:**¬†64% of full-service guests and nearly half of limited-service guests say they come for the vibe, not just the cost^(12). That‚Äôs everything from banter at the bar to a server who remembers the regulars.

**What to Forget:**

**Waiting Out The ‚ÄúRecession‚Äù Until The Good Times Return.**¬†This is structural. Seattle has 1,598 restaurants and 755 coffee shops, with indies dominating but everyone is fighting for too little wallet share^(13).

**Believing More Tech Or Delivery Will Solve Declining Dine-In Traffic.**¬†Operators are focusing on getting butts in seats, not just finger swipes on apps. Those quick-service jobs? They're the only ones really up since 2020, not the three-hour dining experience models¬π.

There‚Äôs no single fix. Tourists will still take selfies with their fries. Survival now means clarity, cut what drags, double down on what works, and keep staff and guests in the honesty loop.

Chins up. Roll sleeves. The restaurants that live to see another calendar won‚Äôt be the luckiest, they‚Äôll be the best at facing the pain, looking at the data with clear eyes, and doing something, maybe something different to keep afloat.

I stopped for coffee in Okanagan Falls and was met with what I can only describe as strange, borderline hostile energy. I walked in to order something to go, and despite there being four people behind the counter chatting, they all looked at me and then just‚Ä¶ ignored me. I stood there awkwardly for nearly 10 minutes before someone finally acknowledged me and took my order. It wasn‚Äôt busy. It wasn‚Äôt subtle.

Out on the road, things didn‚Äôt feel much better. I had two separate incidents where cars passed me far too closely, one of which was clearly intentional, as the driver veered toward me and then sped off. I‚Äôm a pretty cautious rider, but that one shook me.

I know there‚Äôs been a lot of discussion lately about the bike lane construction in Penticton and, of course, the terrible Granfondo tragedy. I fully understand the tension that may exist around cycling in the area, but I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to feel this hostile.

To add to it, some other cyclists I met over the weekend said they went for coffee in Kaleden, parked their bikes in the bike rack, and came back to find them all knocked over. No wind. No accident. Just deliberate.

So I‚Äôm wondering‚Ä¶ has anyone else had similar experiences in Penticton? Was this just a string of bad luck, or is there a wider issue of cyclists feeling unwelcome in the area?",8,1754336974.0,vancouvercycling,8,1.0,False

*I'm not here to moan, or vent, promise!*

I go to work, i go through all the formalities talking with work colleagues who i have no real intention of becoming friends with, i have lunch on my own because i really cant stand how some people moan about the same thing day after day. I go home then normally i will prep and cook dinner, i cook 90% of the time, and i enjoy it, i find it therapeutic, i might then sort the washing out if there's a load in the machine, tidy up a little, shower then relax in front of the TV.

Some things that i like..  
*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, horror/psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

A few things i dont like..  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

You‚Äôve worked the line when the fryer died, the bartender no-called, and the expo lost the check for Table 9. Seattle‚Äôs July drizzled. So, before we even get to the numbers, let‚Äôs be clear: this isn‚Äôt a silver-lining piece. It‚Äôs a raw walk through 2025‚Äôs gauntlet, with a roadmap for the joint that refuses to close.

**The Economy Is Punching Back Hard!**

Optimistic? You‚Äôll only find it in boardrooms and government press releases. On the street? The story‚Äôs rougher and grittier. The pace of the economy has slowed. In June 2025, restaurants added just 6,500 jobs, and July saw a slight net loss of 300 positions in ""eating and drinking places,"" highlighting a stall in hiring momentum during mid-summer^(1). For context, in May and June of this year, both were downwardly revised to just 19,000 and 14,000 new foodservice jobs added, respectively. Restaurant jobs usually post bigger numbers as everyone is getting ready for increased summer traffic. Much less so this year.

Seattle is not alone in feeling the burn, where more than half of local operators lost money in 2024, two out of three watched sales drop or flatline at the top of 2025, and nearly 90% hiked prices just to keep their heads above water^(3). More than 40% cut hours. Almost half let people go. The ‚ÄúGreat Resignation‚Äù morphed into the ‚ÄúGreat Stay,‚Äù but staff levels in full-service are still 226,000 bodies under pre-pandemic levels nationwide, and it shows in closed sections and mounting burnout^(4).

**Recession**

Fast food giants like McDonald‚Äôs posted their largest same-store sales drop since 2020. CEO Chris Kempczynski bluntly says low-income customers have vanished, double-digit declines, and middle-income traffic is shrinking, too. The same goes for Wendy‚Äôs, Starbucks, Domino‚Äôs, and Chipotle. Hike prices, lose traffic. Hold prices, lose margins. Either way, the volume‚Äôs down and nobody‚Äôs smiling at the pass^(5).

Seattle‚Äôs minimum wage increased to $20.76 an hour, no tip credit, no small-business relief. That‚Äôs a 20% labor cost surge for every joint^(6). Anyone who says this is just ‚Äúa bump‚Äù hasn‚Äôt done a Friday double at a 1,600-square-foot independent with a staff of six. Wage laws, rising food costs, and lower guest counts, it‚Äôs the holy trinity of pressure for operators from Belltown to Rainier Beach.

**Less Tipping, Slower Growth, Shrinking Margins**

Square‚Äôs latest report is a gut punch for anyone who depends on tips to make rent. The average tip for food and beverage transactions hit 15.17% in Q1 and dipped again to 14.99% in Q2 2025. At bars, tips slipped from 17.36% to 16.96%; at full-service, from 14.76% to 14.64%. The drop shadows a countrywide dip in consumer confidence, and with tips making up nearly a quarter of a line cook‚Äôs or server‚Äôs income in 2024, that‚Äôs a direct hit to retention and morale^(7).

Restaurants that tried to float profits with 15%+ menu increases? They lost customers and tanked their public perceptions^(8). Value deals are now back in vogue, even as food and pour costs keep climbing. Beef, chicken, coffee, and veggies all posted double-digit increases, only things like potatoes and flour held steady^(9).

Full-service restaurant jobs, the jobs that anchor every neighborhood‚Äôs local, are still below 2019. Growth is now squarely in quick-service, snack, and coffee shop employment¬π.

**The Ruthless Playbook**

National and local governments won‚Äôt save you. The consumer who adored your house burger in 2022 is pinching pennies and tipping less in 2025. The game has changed.

**What Works Now:**

**Raise Prices, Smartly:**¬†Nearly everyone is doing it, but avoid big, blunt hikes, every bump above 10% costs you traffic^(11). Get tactical, smaller, frequent changes tied to clear value, limited-time offers, and tweak high-cost plates around seasonal or lower-cost items that feel premium.

**Cut Hours, Not Quality:**¬†If Monday lunch never breaks even, axe it before you have to ax a shift. 47% of Seattle joints already have^(3). Focus on prime service windows.

**Staffing: Be Ruthlessly Honest About Coverage:**¬†Burnout and turnover are cheaper than headline layoffs, but only in the short run. Invest in your core crew; cross-train and reward reliability.

**Service Charges Vs. Tipping:**¬†The big switch is on, especially in high-wage towns like Seattle. Consider switching from tipping to service charges, but beware, customers hate being surprised. Be prepared to explain the why, and stay consistent.

**Lean Into Experience:**¬†64% of full-service guests and nearly half of limited-service guests say they come for the vibe, not just the cost^(12). That‚Äôs everything from banter at the bar to a server who remembers the regulars.

**What to Forget:**

**Waiting Out The ‚ÄúRecession‚Äù Until The Good Times Return.**¬†This is structural. Seattle has 1,598 restaurants and 755 coffee shops, with indies dominating but everyone is fighting for too little wallet share^(13).

**Believing More Tech Or Delivery Will Solve Declining Dine-In Traffic.**¬†Operators are focusing on getting butts in seats, not just finger swipes on apps. Those quick-service jobs? They're the only ones really up since 2020, not the three-hour dining experience models¬π.

There‚Äôs no single fix. Tourists will still take selfies with their fries. Survival now means clarity, cut what drags, double down on what works, and keep staff and guests in the honesty loop.

Chins up. Roll sleeves. The restaurants that live to see another calendar won‚Äôt be the luckiest, they‚Äôll be the best at facing the pain, looking at the data with clear eyes, and doing something, maybe something different to keep afloat.

1mhnmye,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1mhnmye/i_fell_off/,I fell off!,"
I initially committed to 60 days free of Caffeine, which turned into 6 months. Exercise is an indispensable tool to help you quit and maintain abstinence. Provided I still had  access to exercise, this would have been something I was committed to in perpetuity. However, life doesn‚Äôt work this way, and it doesn‚Äôt particularly care what you want.

I got injured, and that thing (exercise) that carried me throughout the day was no longer accessible to me. Even while in substantial pain, I continued to push it and lift weights and run, knowing that it was the only thing keeping me afloat and away from caffeine.

I reached a point of such tremendous (vomit-inducing) pain that I had to see a doctor and PT. I held out a few more weeks, but I could no longer deal with the depression setting in from being caffeine-free. I have clinical depression, so it‚Äôs always there, but it can come forefront at a moment‚Äôs notice, and losing the ability to exercise invites the demons back in. Note that I also deal with anxiety and adhd, all clinically diagnosed.

I pulled out my coffee kit and looked at it, literally felt like a druggie, and told myself, haha this is your version of a burnt spoon. It took me weeks to gain the courage to even make the first cup of coffee. I decided I would be surgically exacting in my measuring of the coffee beans and how much is ingested daily, to ensure that while my tolerance grows, I am not tempted to increase consumption. My goldilocks value was 8oz of morning cold brew. In contrast, in my previous caffeine life, I would drink closer to 12-14oz daily. Hardly excessive, but far too much for a person predisposed to an anxious temperament.

So after all of this consternation, I take my sip of coffee, and it tastes really good. Historically, I never liked the taste of coffee, but this time I savored it. By the time I reach half of the cup (4oz), I could hear and feel my heart pounding in opposition to my choices. It screams: ‚ÄúNo, not this shit again, do humans ever learn?‚Äù I was on the verge of a panic attack, which I don‚Äôt really get, but there was a bodily alarm triggered. I rushed outside to get some fresh gulps of air and returned to finish the coffee. I thought, okay, nice experiment, but now schedule your drinking so that it isn‚Äôt daily. This ‚Äúschedule‚Äù was maintained for precisely zero days. I have drunk coffee every single day for 40 days. Moreover, since I had already ‚Äúbroken the seal,‚Äù I also allotted myself one (20oz) Diet Dr. Pepper per week, fractioned into thirds.

The effing planes! I have never been more alert to the un-abating noisiness of airplanes! They are everywhere, and they are obnoxiously loud. Funny, while uncaffeinated, I never noticed airplanes, because very little could annoy me, but I cannot overstate how much airplanes pervaded my life/peace/existence. It‚Äôs like I couldn‚Äôt even sit outside anymore. Again, it‚Äôs not the pilot or airlines I have issues with; it‚Äôs the caffeine. I especially ‚Äúloved‚Äù airplanes overhead as I tried to partake in conversation with people, I would completely lose the plot and could not concentrate until they passed, which meant perhaps 4 mins of renewed quiet. Are airplanes the Harleys of the sky?

The aura was gone. There was an exact moment I was getting groceries, and it registered to me that I am paying far too much attention to others, and I am feeling anxious over nothing, and the aura was gone. I don‚Äôt think you can develop an aura very easily. I think a host of fortunate genetic things must couple with a list of environmental things to cultivate your aura, a seeking of one's higher self if you will. My aura came from exercise and being caffeine-free; devoid these things, it vanished, and that depressed me further.

I rationalized my increased anxiety over and over again. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not really that bad, it‚Äôs just kind of bad!‚Äù It is, in fact, very bad! I was surprised by a few things. I‚Äôve had sleep issues for over a decade, and going caffeine-free fixed this. Returning to caffeine, except for the first few nights, my sleep quality has been maintained, which was surprising. I‚Äôm also doing more things in general, getting out more, exploring, and did a few of the tasks on my long to-do list, although that was really only the first 3 weeks, and lately I haven‚Äôt wanted to do anything even while caffeinated, but I attribute some of this to just being in a deeply anxious state which is basically the thief of all joy!

So, in the ensuing days, I will be going back to caffeine-free. I still won‚Äôt have the exercise component, which I desperately need, but I surmise that it will return after taking it easy for   4-8 weeks. 

I don‚Äôt know the point of this story other than just to vent a little, and wish to say I hope you all are having a great summer, and if your body will tolerate it, exercise could be a key component of your caffeine-free journey! ",4,1754336752.0,decaf,0,1.0,False
1mhnmwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/TenantsInTheUK/comments/1mhnmwa/is_this_negligence/,Is this negligence?,"I‚Äôm a tenant in a block of flats that has a management company. We have a fixed metal bin right outside the main entrance that is on private land but being used inappropriately - ie people leave their rubbish bags around the bin, coffee cups, meal deal wrappers, alcohol bottles, used condoms, chicken bones, you name it‚Ä¶I‚Äôve seen it.

The tenants have a designated binstore, so we don‚Äôt really use the bin in question. A year ago, I asked the management company to get rid of the bin outside as foxes would tear thru the plastic binbags, and dirty the street, especially when its windy.

I confirmed with the local environmental councillor/council waste team, and they said since it‚Äôs on private land, the binmen are not responsible for collecting the bin bags that people toss on the floor. Nor is the council the one who can remove the bin. 

The management company has ignored me throughout. They sometimes send contractors to clean the area, but that encourages fly-tipping even more as people think somebody is cleaning it. How do I proceed? My landlord has also tried getting the management company to take action, but to no avail.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

The ones who level up fastest do not have superhuman willpower. They have a simple system that removes decisions, captures mistakes and turns studying into short, repeatable loops.

Here is the exact setup I teach. You can start it today with paper, a timer and your current materials.


1) Build a 90-minute ‚Äúdaily core‚Äù

This is the smallest possible day that still moves you forward. Even on bad days, hit the core.

Structure

	‚Ä¢	5 min warm-up: open book or notes and write 3 lines about what you will finish in this session
	‚Ä¢	2 √ó 35 min focused blocks with a 5 min break between
	‚Ä¢	10 min review and planning for tomorrow

Rules

	‚Ä¢	One subject per block
	‚Ä¢	Close everything that is not the task
	‚Ä¢	Stop on time even if you feel able to continue. Consistency beats heroic bursts

If you have more time, add more 35 min blocks. Keep each block focused on a single outcome, not ‚Äústudy chemistry.‚Äù


2) Use the Active Study Loop for every block

	1.	Preview (2‚Äì3 min): skim headings, learning objectives or past paper questions so you know what ‚Äúdone‚Äù looks like
	2.	Do (25‚Äì30 min): examples, problems, flashcards or summarising from memory
	3.	Check (2‚Äì3 min): mark against answers or model work
	4.	Capture (2‚Äì3 min): write any error into your Error Log (see below) with a one-line fix
	5.	Plan (1‚Äì2 min): one next action you will do next time

This looks basic. Most people skip steps 3‚Äì5. That is why they feel busy yet keep repeating the same mistakes.



3) Keep an Error Log, not pretty notes

Your marks grow where you repeatedly mess up. Track it.

Examples of ‚ÄúWhat went wrong‚Äù:

	‚Ä¢	misread units
	‚Ä¢	tried to hold steps in head, should have written them
	‚Ä¢	mixed up ‚Äúonly‚Äù with ‚Äúif and only if‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	forgot a definition
	‚Ä¢	ran out of time due to long intro reading

Each entry must have a one-line fix or rule. Revisit the log three times a week and redo a few items until they are boring. This turns weak spots into free marks.


4) Turn content into questions

You learn faster when your notes are answerable. For each topic create Q-A style prompts. Use a notebook or a flashcard app. Examples:

	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúState Kirchhoff‚Äôs first and second laws‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúDerive the SUVAT equation v¬≤ = u¬≤ + 2as from first principles‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúExplain the difference between specificity and sensitivity with a 2√ó2 table‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúList the three conditions for congruent triangles and give a counterexample‚Äù

Test yourself rapidly. If you cannot answer, write the smallest missing piece into your Error Log.


5) Weekly map, not a daily wishlist

On Sunday, plan the shape of the week first, then fill details later.

Weekly map (10 minutes)

	‚Ä¢	Deadlines and exams
	‚Ä¢	3 priority topics for the week
	‚Ä¢	Which days you can study and how many blocks each day
	‚Ä¢	A ‚Äúcatch-up‚Äù slot you can raid if needed

Daily plan (5 minutes, the night before)

	‚Ä¢	Choose the specific tasks for each block from your Error Log and priorities
	‚Ä¢	Prepare files, pages and question sets so you can start cold


6) Technique menu by subject

Pick one main technique per subject and stick to it.

Maths/Physics/QR (any numerical subject matter)

	‚Ä¢	Work examples from memory before checking solutions
	‚Ä¢	Show all working and units
	‚Ä¢	When stuck, write the three facts you know and the one you need to find. Then list two possible routes
	‚Ä¢	Keep a page of ‚Äústupid mistakes‚Äù and read it before a problem set

Essay subjects

	‚Ä¢	Blurting: close notes and write everything you know about a prompt for 8 minutes. Then compare with model content, fill gaps and turn them into questions
	‚Ä¢	Plan answers with bullet point arguments, evidence and the linking phrase you will use
	‚Ä¢	Practice timed mini-essays. Time pressure reveals what content is actually retrievable

Sciences

	‚Ä¢	Draw processes from memory. Label steps and conditions
	‚Ä¢	Make tables that compare similar things side by side
	‚Ä¢	Convert text to mechanisms, cycles and diagrams you can redraw quickly

Languages

	‚Ä¢	Micro drills: 10 sentences focused on one tense or one structure
	‚Ä¢	Read out loud. Record, listen, correct
	‚Ä¢	Spaced vocabulary, but only in phrases you would genuinely say


7) Timing and focus that do not require an app

	‚Ä¢	Use a simple 35/5 timer. Two blocks is one ‚Äúset‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Cap hard questions. Give them one attempt, mark, capture the error and move on
	‚Ä¢	If your brain will not cooperate, do a 10/2 micro-set. Three in a row counts as a block
	‚Ä¢	Phone in another room. If you must use it, airplane mode and download what you need first


8) When motivation is low

Motivation comes after action, not before it. Use triggers.

	‚Ä¢	Start with a 2-minute ‚Äúopen project and write the first line‚Äù rule
	‚Ä¢	Do your 5-minute warm-up even if you will stop after it. Most times you will continue
	‚Ä¢	If you feel overwhelmed, pick one item from your Error Log and fix just that

Reward yourself for the behaviour, not the result. ‚ÄúI did the daily core‚Äù earns the treat, regardless of how it felt.


9) Protect sleep and energy

	‚Ä¢	Aim for a fixed sleep start time. Your wake time will stabilise
	‚Ä¢	Light breakfast, protein at lunch, water nearby
	‚Ä¢	Short daily movement counts. 10 minutes of walking or mobility resets your focus more than another coffee


10) Exam-month playbook

Four weeks out

	‚Ä¢	Switch to mostly questions and past papers
	‚Ä¢	Start timing nearly everything
	‚Ä¢	Keep the Error Log front and centre

Two weeks out

	‚Ä¢	Full-length papers for timing stamina if your exam uses them
	‚Ä¢	Redo your worst sets until you can do them fast from memory
	‚Ä¢	Create one-page ‚Äúpanic sheets‚Äù per topic with the handful of facts and traps you forget

Night before

	‚Ä¢	Prepare kit, ID, route, snacks
	‚Ä¢	Two short blocks on your top weak spots, then stop
	‚Ä¢	Sleep. The mark boost from extra rest is real


A seven-day starter plan

Day 1: Build your Error Log and do one 90-minute core on the weakest subject
Day 2: Two cores, different subjects, fill at least five Error Log entries
Day 3: One core + 20 minute redo session from Error Log
Day 4: Two cores, first timed mini-set in each subject
Day 5: One core + tidy notes into question format
Day 6: Two cores, one full past paper section where relevant
Day 7: Weekly review, plan the next week, and rest

Repeat. Keep the loop short and boring. That is what makes it stick.",1,1754336703.0,studytips,0,1.0,False

We‚Äôre opening up a cafe and are knee-deep in kitchen layout planning right now. The setup is partly dictated by a few non-negotiables namely, where the main drain is and how close we are to the water lines. Fun times :)

Attached is our draft layout including all the major equipment based on our menu. Think coffee, tea, fresh juices, protein shakes, cold sandwiches, salads, and breakfast bowls. So no heavy duty cooking, just a lot of assembling and blending.

Ideally, we‚Äôd like to not mess with the wall separating the kitchen and the order counter. Our biggest concerns are making sure the workflow makes sense:

* within the kitchen,
* in the order area,
* and the back-and-forth between those two.

Happy to report Trader Joe‚Äôs one wasn‚Äôt artificial tasting (pretty on point with vanilla extract taste) and was surprisingly less runny than the other brands, which I love! Not as stiff as whipped cream, but also not as runny as the other foams. Tasting the foam itself only, I don‚Äôt get a super sweet taste either, so I think it‚Äôll work nicely with already sweetened drinks. I personally like to use these on top of iced black coffee or espresso, and let the foam sweeten it.

Not sure how to format this post since I had a conversation with Devan Manley last night and the situation was slightly different from what I thought.

Devan [shouting me out](https://youtube.com/shorts/kjoYrzIV8XA) a while ago

Nothing doctored or altered, I implore everyone to go verify all of this publicly available proof themselves.  
Very brief overview of what happened, then explaining how I'll format this post.

Kevin wanted someone to run pages and edit clips etc. I figured 1,000 people already went for it, didn't bother, turns out only 1 guy did and it was just the IG. Kevin Abstract then requested multiple times for someone to edit videos and run a tiktok page. He made it very clear [multiple times](https://www.youtube.com/@BlushTX) this would all be paid. He has a [history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNjE5_HFfHA) of saying he wants to get people paid, there's jobs available and plenty of room for people to do official work and get paid, he constantly mentions people doing work and getting paid, joining blush, how [they need so many different people](https://postimg.cc/WtK3y8hR) and so on.

https://preview.redd.it/3r6b54ar2ugf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=da28bff8c9462194222490762a16dfae1b4cafd7

Beginning of June, Kevin Abstract repeatedly asked for someone to edit and run the tiktok page, heavy emphasis on this being a PAID position (more issues than just money, later). Immediately I made the page and started posting, told him, he told me link with Devan or AJ. I posted a story and tagged Devan, he brought me on officially and told me to post it on tiktok and do more edits, work with the IG page [and so on](https://postimg.cc/7C13q65k). Devan said he loved my work etc, later on would routinely praise my work ethic and results.

In short, many people lied and tried to cover it up as ""miscommunications""  
This started with BlushClipss and the twitch mod team  
[https://www.instagram.com/blushclipss/](https://www.instagram.com/blushclipss/)  
[https://www.instagram.com/westcoastfiker/](https://www.instagram.com/westcoastfiker/)  
[https://www.instagram.com/angelizzee/](https://www.instagram.com/angelizzee/)  
[https://www.instagram.com/starbearez/](https://www.instagram.com/starbearez/)  
BlushClipss/ian got a DM from Kevin. He asked me a lot of questions/wanted advice, how to handle the twitch mods, pay, many other things. I have all of our DMs ready to post but I'll wait first to see if they catch themselves in a lie. BlushClipss glazed me, said how great I am and how much he wanted to keep me around, said how professional and knowledgeable I was, he also told me everything was completely private (which I never even asked him to, he himself went out of his way to swear this)

then a few hours later ghosted me, told our entire ""private"" conversation to the mods but lied and put out false accusations of me talking crazy/being weird/inappropriate/difficult to work with. This is a direct contradiction to what he said right before to me, a lie. He did this because he gave the mods his account login to share and he was afraid of being caught being 2 faced and acting weird.  
He deliberately deleted his messages to hide this. The mods say he ""lost access"" to his copy of our DMs after he gave them the login.  
IG messages are stored in the cloud. They're not erased even if you delete/deactivate your account. The only way to delete your messages is to go through and manually delete your copy of the conversation. This, combined with IanBC saying things to me and doing the exact opposite hours later is very clear proof that he directly lied and deleted his messages so he wouldn't be caught being two-faced and weird. Again, if the team wants to run their mouth I'll happily go through every single message with ianBlushClipss and narrate it, see how many lies they get caught in

Again, BlushClipss/ian [admitted](https://postimg.cc/B8yJCtdG) to all of this multiple times, but called it a ""miscommunication"" and blamed it on his mental health

The next section is about the twitch mods, here is [all of the DM](https://youtu.be/Q187L1BGub8)s with the twitch mods, [part 2](https://youtu.be/JOY7AwKlds8) and [part 3](https://youtube.com/shorts/naXlWxtRQgw)

Originally this post was more detailed on the mistakes the mods made, but I've recently learned they're glorified interns so I'll be faster here

After he spoke to Kevin, BlushClipss/ian ghosted me, added the mods, told the lies, they blackballed me and decided to silently remove me from the group without talking to me or Devan Manley. Days later I noticed something was wrong so I asked Devan. [He was surprised](https://postimg.cc/nsgwsTZJ) because they made an iMessage chat together and he thought I was already in it. Again, let me repeat, Devan Manley thought I was officially on payroll with the mods in the exclusive iMessage groupchat. Devan Manley also thought that I had his phone number, so there is no denying in any way that I was both officially recognized and an actual blush affiliate that did official authorized work for them.

The issue is that his mods removed me and blackballed me without telling him. Anyways, when I asked Devan what happened he asked the mods and Ian lied, they repeated what Ian told them, unknowingly spreading those lies.  
Again, I knew something was still wrong since Devan never responded. I confront the mods later and that's where it was confirmed BlushClipss/ian spread a lot of lies about me. He admitted to this multiple times and took full responsibility, but called it a ""miscommunication"" which is patently not true. All of the twitch mods [acknowledged](https://postimg.cc/PLZd2dhp) I did nothing wrong, that they were misinformed, and that it was not my fault and my name was cleared and the whole thing was a ""mistake""

the issue is that after this I asked to be added to the iMessage and main group and they chose to keep me removed anyways. It seems things were solved so I kept working as I was told, except they never informed Devan everything they told him about me was a lie. So unless I'm mistaken somehow, at this point the entire twitch mod team is collectively lying by omission to cover up their mistakes while still blackballing me.

I'll refrain from posting all of my DMs with Devan Manley but if the validity of this post is called into question that can change.

I confront Devan about this and make it known [at the very start](https://postimg.cc/Th4SBRBw), me not being paid is an issue. He assures me he wants to keep me around, loves my work, values my work ethic, and he will work to find a resolution.  
The issue is that he never did, and every time I asked him about the resolution, he pawned me off to the twitch mods and had me try to ""work it out"" with them

Unsurprisingly, the people that decided to ruin my life for no reason and kept ruining my life for no personal gain, did not decide to stop ruining my life when I asked them. So again I was blackballed.  
At one point I called Devan and Saint and I was assured again that my work was good, they acknowledged I have ""insane work ethic"" and then told me they wanted to find a resolution.  
The twitch mods kept me removed anyways but told me they would repost a video if I asked. I tried to play this way for a bit, give Devan some time because he's ""busy"" but after this point he would routinely ignore me as much as possible and give me dismissive 3 word replies occasionally.

It never went anywhere, reposts did nothing and I still wasn't being paid even though I made it known this was an issue many weeks before and I was assured that despite the busy schedule they still wanted me around and were looking for a resolution. Finally I gave in, saw that me editing would not go anywhere anymore. I do graphic design and video editing at a professional level. I do many other things, very good with music and mixing, I have a lot of background in writing and design, especially cinematography as well as film, many many other things etc.

Aside from the many things I do besides editing, now I'll go into detail about the breakdown of rates, hours, work, etc.

As seen [HERE,](https://www.youtube.com/@BlushTX/videos) the month+ I was actively working they streamed for at least 40 hours. Have to go through the entire stream, cut it down, an hour to edit the videos, an hour to finalize, export, thumbnails, posting miscellaneous stuff. At least 2 hours per day in addition to the 40 ish it takes to go through the streams, conservative estimate let's be generous and say I did 90 hours of work.  
BEGINNER rates for an absolute entry level editor are \~20$ an hour, which I am NOT.  
Experienced editors easily charge 50-100 minimum as far as hourly rates, but I know this is a lot simpler and faster than long form video editing so obviously I as a professional know not to charge that, especially since I'm working here with a burgeoning collective that I wanted to grow with.

Any standard editor's rates for shorts would be more like at least 30-40 an hour.  
I wouldn't charge anything near this, which says a lot about my ethic and professionalism (especially considering for many other people it would easily take them up to twice as long to edit these) and also the edits were more complex before I was told to tone down the editing.

So I, as a decent person and professional, recognize charging high rates wouldn't make sense especially since I'm working with a group/company that's starting up. Anyone else would charge 50-100 per hour for editing, 30-40 minimum for shorts and many people, I think, would struggle to get as much work done as I have.

So I would say at least 20$ for the hours I worked is more than fair, a steal in value. That's 1,800 for a month of highly specialized work in addition to all of the other cancerous drama I was forced to deal with. Barely more than a fast food worker gets paid despite this being a highly sought after learned trade/skill in addition to running social media.  
Not to mention this is just charging near indentured servitude wages in exchange for efficient high quality professional work.

Let's talk numbers. Devan Manley's paid twitch jockeys post 9ish videos per week with 100 viewers ready to clip moments for them at all times. In half a day, I made 14 videos and went back and re-edited all previous videos at the request of Devan. In half a day I did 2x as much work at a much higher quality than his entire team did put together over a week, so despite his twitch mods barely making money, this is different and I am operating at a professional level and need to be paid.

They also can't edit longer moments or reoccurring parts of a stream, 90% just 5 seconds videos a viewer on twitch clipped. The 4 of them after 2 months have 105 videos, I have 40 videos posted and a few dozen more nearly edited in my project file, I've deleted probably 10 or more, privated some videos, scrapped some others, so about 80-90 videos posted or ready to be posted, I could already see the writing on the wall and I knew what was coming so I slowed down a little while waiting for the 'resolutions' and worked on other things including editing up a couple longer form videos to try out as well as designing some graphics to show to blush etc.

And I could have said all this, it would have been resolved over a month ago, if literally anyone at all would have taken the time to reply to me. Or even to tell me that there's no future for me editing instead of goading me on telling me they'd find a resolution.

I am also NOT some random entry level kid editing for the first time. I've spent 100s of hours studying social media etc, I have a throwaway youtube channel where I've racked up over 1 million views in my spare time. I showed Devan all of this, the results I've gotten independently and the experience I have, so there's no way Devan genuinely thought I was doing all this for free or next to no pay.  
Also, again they praised my work and determination/drive/ethics, etc. so I HIGHLY doubt Devan and everyone else thought I was tweaking over 20$ for the last 2 months.

Worth noting in a numerical sense it takes the entire twitch team put together a week to do what I do in half a day, and they do it worse. So it is not a question of quality of work either.

A couple weeks after the mods denied me for the final time,

I started tagging Devan trying to set up a quick call to pitch myself. I accepted that my editing wasn't going anywhere and I was still going to be blackballed no matter what I did, so I wanted to talk to him and present myself and what I had to offer outside of running the page and editing so I could actually do something. I had to spam him with stories, he would give a 1 word reply then delay the call, then say I'll call you,[ then delay](https://postimg.cc/MXXB0KGZ), then say just text me, then ignore texts and demos I sent, then not read the text he told me to send him.  
I then sent a TLDR and he finally told me there was no work for me. He said he would ""keep me in mind in the future"" and this is off the back of him religiously ignoring me for weeks

which was the final send off saying that I was not working with them anymore and wouldn't in the future either. The issue is no one ever mentioned this and had me keep working for a month+ while telling me a solution was being worked on and reinforcing how good my work was.

After this I finally broke down and [tweaked](https://postimg.cc/gallery/3KKQBM0) out in Devan's DM and he ignored me. Since then I've been tagging him usually once daily until I spoke to him last night and he made it clear I was not going to be paid and I will not get any work or anything else that could compensate for the month+ of work that I did that was promised to be paid and the 2+ months of my life that just went down the drain.  
I tagged him in a [few schizo videos](https://youtu.be/F8goudr0MPQ) on tiktok,  
to test the waters I sent the mods a throwaway video I had lying around to repost to check things, surprisingly they reposted which meant he was keeping quiet on everything but then they were told to take it down and not post or interact with me anymore.  
This was clearly me being blacklisted outright so I started pressing him more about getting paid for the work I did do since clearly there was no future and I needed to be compensated for my time and work.

This led to him finally replying and us having a conversation. I learned the mods are basically interns, he and saint pay out not Kevin, and that he didn't have any money for me. He said idk what to do so I said I'll try to think of something.

So I gave Devan the easiest, safest layup imaginable to end this controversy. I would spend my own money to fly to a show, vlog/record it/make a behind the scenes documentary or do interviews etc. A public place with many people where I openly introduce myself in person and do in-person professional fil/video work to further earn what I had already earned so I could get it resolved in person, etc. This is the easiest most safe solution you could possibly have.

No risk or cost to him, or even blush. I fly myself there. Work for them for a 1 off thing, get paid for doing more professional work instead of just editing streams, then I go home. I'm also not some random creepy anon. My face has been public since day 1, I have history in the blush discord, Devan knows my name and I've actually spoken to him on the phone and worked with him all this time, I've also proven myself responsible by how hard I've worked while having faith in him and following through, how incredibly I've handled this situation privately and peacefully until I started tweaking for the last week or two (in response to him and his employees erasing 2 months of my time, blackballing me, and destroying my life as well as owing $1800+ to me)

Devan, because he does not like me due to me tweaking on him (in response to him ruining my life and stealing from me) declined me. I literally tried to put it all behind us, do professional work that I would front the cost for to justify me getting paid what I was owed, I tried to bury the hatchet and safely and neutrally introduce myself and do 1 off in person professional work at a public event to come together and resolve this peacefully while also giving a professional product and a perfect resolution to everyone.

I asked Devan how that isn't a good idea/isn't doable, after that Devan got a bit more heated and tried to press me, claiming I ""just decided to start editing on my own"" and ""no one asked me to do that"" among other things (which is completely not true and objective horseshit). I then said I understand how stressed he would feel and how it's a complicated idea, so I asked him if he could link me with anyone that could solve this or I could get this idea figured out with and he said no. I asked if he could link me with Kevin to figure something out. This really bothered him and he got mad, went off a lil bit, said no. I said it doesn't make sense to say you don't know me or can't trust me or aren't comfortable when Kevin spoke to IanBlushClipss nearly 2 months ago despite not knowing him at all.

I have literally tried the hardest I possibly could at every point to resolve this peacefully and privately in any and every way possible. At no point has anyone besides me actually cared or even attempted to find a solution here.

Kevin Abstract posted a paid job position. I joined immediately, he recognized me, Devan recognized me, I was brought on officially to work, I then did that work and I made it known from the start me not being paid would be an issue.

I then did do the month of high quality, very efficient editing work as Kevin asked when describing the paid position he posted and advertised multiple times over. I even went above and beyond.

And none of this is even mentioning how the twitch mods got me blackballed for literally no reason, and admitted to it many times, yet they never had to answer for it and I still had everything taken from me and I was mentally tormented for the last 1-2 months despite everyone universally agreeing that I actually didn't do anything wrong.

This has all caused unimaginable stress and emotional turmoil for me. Imagine having your entire livelihood, an entire career path potentially the rest of your life in someone's hands and they just play with it and throw you away like it's nothing. Imagine watching 2+ months of your life go up in flames just because some teenage interns randomly decided to do it for no reason. Imagine being owed minimum $1,800 and the guy that's employed by and best friends with a multimillionaire and multiple platinum artists tells you he can't pay you for the month+ of work you did for him officially.

Yes, this actually has ruined the last 2 months of my life and caused unimaginable stress/anxiety/dread and erased a life changing job opportunity all because Ian(blushclipss) was scared of getting caught being a snake and threw me under the bus to save himself.

I had real authentic faith in Devan for months. I really thought he was just busy and he would pull through like he always said. But I guess he was too [busy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJAQK0yJetw) playing [roblox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXmAIIQ7AWY) and getting matcha to stop ruining my life. This experience has genuinely twisted and warped my mind. I've become much more hateful and I doubt I'll ever be able to truly trust someone again. I wish this could be over. I begged and pleaded to solve this privately, he's held my life in his hands for nearly 2 months and watched as his employees ruined me, but now he sees me as some psychotic tweaker because I briefly freaked out at him once after he stole 90+ hours of my life and much more from me.

Imagine how far I could be right now if I put those 90 hours into making videos for my successful monetized channel, or worked on my own music for 90 hours, or any other number of things I do.

The twitch mods blackballed me and Devan blacklisted me so even if I wanted to do more work or find a solution outside of this I can't, and he also said repeatedly he won't pay me and ""there's nothing he can do for me"" (which just isn't true)

Kevin is the one who advertised this position and repeatedly requested it, so Kevin should be able to pay me. The mods are on Saint+Dev payroll, that's fine because this is clearly a separate league. I outperformed 4 people put together, I was patient and understanding while letting it be known from week 1 that pay was an issue and I needed to be compensated. I was repeatedly assured at every point that a resolution was being worked towards, but the only resolution was ignoring me and telling me to ask the mods to stop ruining my life. Even then, I tried to work something out with Devan last night because I just want this to be over but every route was shut down.

""WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS PUBLIC, solve it privately"" because I've tried non-stop with everything I had to resolve this privately.

I even made it all as easy as possible for them, told them I didn't even want the mod team to be punished, I just wanted to go back to working and start officially getting paid. Devan would respond once in a while and then defer me to the twitch mods to find a ""resolution"" and, surprisingly, the people who went out of their way to ruin my life for no reason decided to keep doing it after I asked them to stop.

Devan then feigns interest in finding a resolution for a few weeks until he can't be bothered to care anymore and starts routinely ignoring me under the guise of being too busy to schedule an important 10 minute phone call a week in advance, despite routinely playing roblox and going for coffee runs and hang out sessions with his friends as well as streaming constantly

This job was promised with pay, I was brought on officially and officially did work that was officially recognized praised and posted. Devan thought I was already in the imessage chat on payroll, he thought I already had his phone number. There is no denying Kevin Abstract brought people on for this roll, I excelled in a professional setting and worked a lot, and that I was officially a part of the team and officially recognized as working for blush. They may use the excuse of ""there was never a payment agreement"" but that's the whole point. I relentlessly tried to solve this and made it known that was an issue and I was always reassured it would be resolved but then I was ignored.

There is no denying this. I did the work, I did it well and was praised. I put in the time and effort on this paid position but I was put in unimaginable stress by the twitch mods ruining my life, come to find out they basically don't even get paid.  
Kevin Abstract is a multimillionaire, blush raked in \~$160k gross in 1st month streams minimum, they sell 80$ hoodies and the group has multiple platinum artists in it. They can afford to pay me

Any sum I could even think of would be a % of a % of their monthly income. I even suggested to Devan that I could buy a ticket to a texas show, do a behind the scenes vlog/documentary/interviews for the concerts in order to earn that money and prove myself, but he denied me because he didn't feel ""comfortable"" with that because I lightly tweaked in his DMs after him and his employees erased 2 months of my hard work, ruined my life, and blacklisted me from ever getting work in the future as well.

This is just work hours, not counting anything else I've submitted to blush besides that that all went to waste bc I ended up getting blackballed.

All I wanted was a payout and I begged and pleaded for months. Not like I wanted a handout. I just wish I could be compensated and walk away, leave everyone alone and put this behind me but I guess that can't happen.

Moral of the story idk. Don't work for blush ig, lies and ""miscommunications"" lead to biblical fuckups constantly and 2 months of my life have been stolen me. $1,800+ of official work has been stolen from me. 90+ hours I've been made to work for someone else who clearly knew what I was doing and pretended to be ignorant of the situation, and now all I have to show for it is a ""Yeah I'm really sorry bro"" as well as my life being in shambles

I've been used blackballed blacklisted and thrown away in addition to having a group of teenage interns  put false accusations on my name.

""Yeah bro I'm sorry bro. Sorry you worked for me for 90 hours and 2+ months of your life went down the drain and you're blackballed, but I don't like you now so I don't want to ask my boss to fix this or get something worked out. Anyways see ya""

Here is a lesson to you all:

immediately do public call outs and exposee posts, don't wait hoping someone will become the decent human being they should have been at the start. As soon as someone does something sideways immediately let as many people know as possible. I should have made some expose post like this immediately a month ago, I was stupid to show kindness and patience. Do not give any patience at all to people that are willing to ignore you, do not trust people and especially do not give them wiggle room after they've shown you they don't give a fuck about you. They will keep taking from you, STEALING from you, and when they get bored they'll ruin your life too",1,1754335693.0,u_ForgottenBoey,0,1.0,False

1mhn30l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mhn30l/uncover_if_the_presto_6cup_coffee_percolator/,Uncover if the Presto 6-Cup Coffee Percolator truly brews the perfect cup review,"The Presto 2822 is a coffee percolator I‚Äôve had the pleasure of using for my morning ritual over the past month. Its stainless-steel build and classic style caught my eye immediately‚Äîthere's just something nostalgic, yet sleek, about a percolator compared to the sea of espresso machines dominating the market. This coffee maker feels more like an old-school experience, the kind of product you‚Äôd pull out at a family gathering or to impress friends with its elegant simplicity. While my overall experience has been great, there are a few quirks about it that stood out during my daily testing.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design oozes retro charm. The polished stainless steel gives it a shiny, clean finish, lending it a premium look while being robust and practical. Its dimensions (4"" diameter, 7.5"" width, and 10"" height) make it compact enough to fit snugly on my counter without hogging space. I particularly appreciated how lightweight it is at just 2.65 pounds‚Äîmoving it around the kitchen feels effortless. However, I must say that the handle, though sturdy, gets slightly warm after long use. It's definitely not burning hot but something to keep in mind if you're refilling multiple times for guests. The detachable cord is a nice touch, allowing me to serve coffee easily without dragging the power connection along.

**Brewing Performance**  
This percolator can brew anywhere between 2 to 6 cups of coffee, and for smaller households or light drinkers, the versatility is a big win. I found the brewing process to be fascinating: it circulates hot water through the grounds in a consistent rhythm, creating that satisfying percolating sound. I‚Äôll admit‚Äîit made the waiting time oddly pleasant. The 500-watt motor seems just powerful enough to brew a strong, rich cup in a reasonable time without guzzling electricity. In my tests, a 6-cup batch was ready in about 5-6 minutes. It also features an automatic keep-warm mode, which has been an absolute delight as it maintains a steady temperature for extended moments when I‚Äôm sipping slowly.

**[Check Presto 2822 Coffee Percolator price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b002lvuik8/)**

**Ease of Use and Features**  
Operating the Presto 2822 is as simple as manual percolators come. There are no complex buttons‚Äîjust a single indicator light to signal when the coffee is ready. The reusable filter prevents any waste, and I loved how easy it is to rinse and reuse without needing paper replacements. The stay-cool bottom ensures it‚Äôs safe to place directly on any surface, even minutes after brewing. One nice detail is the drip-free spout that‚Äôs genuinely mess-proof (something my old machine couldn‚Äôt boast of). Filling it is straightforward too, though I do recommend keeping a steady hand to avoid over-spilling water into the percolator chamber.

**Key Benefits**  
- Classic stainless-steel design that feels premium.  
- Compact and lightweight, ideal for small kitchens or minimal storage space.  
- Brews rich coffee with a familiar and pleasant percolating sound.  
- Reusable filter eliminates waste and adds convenience.  

**Limitations**  
That said, there are a few areas where I felt the product fell short.  
- The handle, while sturdy, can get lightly warm during extended use.  
- If you prefer customizable coffee settings (like strength adjustment), this manual model feels a bit basic.  
- The lack of water level indicators takes a bit of guesswork to get perfectly accurate.  

**Competing Products**  
Now, compared to some of its rivals, like the Farberware Classic Yosemite Percolator or Cuisinart PRC-12, the Presto 2822 definitely holds its own. What it does better is the automatic keep-warm mode, something lacking in products like the Farberware model. On the downside, the Cuisinart model offers greater versatility with programmable features. But the Presto comes at a lighter weight and simpler usability for those who aren‚Äôt tech-savvy. 

Generally speaking, if you‚Äôre prioritizing convenience and durability over digital adjustments or added frills, this percolator is a clear winner.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Its affordability absolutely shocked me when compared to pricier espresso machines or even other mid-range percolators. Despite its minimalistic build, it packs enough power to justify the price, especially for casual coffee drinkers‚Äîthis could easily become a household staple without having to drop a fortune. For friends or family members who love traditional coffee brewing, this would make an excellent gift that balances cost and value.

My friend and I both visited SLC for the first time in May for Kilby and fell in love with the city. We both work remotely and want to come back sometime in the fall to just stay in an air bnb and work from home for a week or two and explore the city. 

We really enjoyed the relative walkability (we stayed south of The Avenues - above the Red Line last time) & general ease of public transport. Would love to stay in a neighborhood with good walkability to bars/museums/bookstores/coffee shops. We‚Äôd also like to go hiking and check out some trails as the weather will be nice.

Any recommendations for specific months to see some autumn leaves & do outdoorsy things? We are Florida natives and never get to experience a true autumn so the leaves and general sweater weather cozy vibes sound SO fun. Which neighborhoods would you recommend for a longer stay than a weekend for Kilby? And are there any fun events happening in the autumn time that we should plan to visit during?

Ninja clearly knows how to make an appliance that's both stylish and practical. It‚Äôs not too bulky, fitting easily on my counter, but big enough to brew up to 10 cups‚Äîperfect for when I‚Äôve got family or coworkers visiting. Despite its shiny, fancy look, using this drip coffee machine felt remarkably straightforward. No coffee pods are required, which feels eco-friendly and pocket-friendly at the same time.

**Functionality and Brewing Precision**

Exploring the functionality of the Ninja CM300 proved to be a real treat. The machine offers three brew styles: Classic, Rich, and Over Ice, and I‚Äôve experimented with all of them. The Classic brew is your standard, trusty option, producing a smooth cup that kickstarts my mornings. The Rich setting, though, delivers an impressively bold flavor. When testing the Over Ice function, I was wowed‚ÄîNinja wasn‚Äôt kidding about ‚Äúvivid iced coffee flavor that is never watered down.‚Äù Unlike other machines I‚Äôve tried, this one delivers proper strength in iced coffee, and I can finally enjoy my afternoon pick-me-up without the dreaded diluted taste.

**Customizable Brew Sizes**

One standout feature of this coffee maker is its versatility regarding brew sizes. Six options allow you to cater to whatever coffee mood strikes. Whether I just need a single cup to get moving or a full carafe to fuel a work session, the CM300 has me covered. I‚Äôve also used it to fill up my travel mug quickly, which has been a game changer for my morning commute. 

Additionally, the removable water reservoir is such a thoughtful touch. I‚Äôve tested coffee makers in the past where refilling ends up being a messy ordeal. With the pull-away design of this feature, filling it at the sink is not just simple but also spill-free. Cleaning this part is just as efficient, saving me time every week.

**Advantages**

The Ninja CM300 offers several strong points that make it a worthy consideration:
- The option to enjoy three distinct brewing styles adds variety to my coffee routine.
- Brew size choices ensure flexibility, whether it‚Äôs a single cup or a full carafe.
- The Over Ice brew function stands out, offering robust iced coffee that retains flavor.
- The removable water tank and easy refilling process are practical conveniences.
- Its stainless-steel accents give this machine a premium look without taking over too much counter space.

**Limitations**

While I‚Äôve enjoyed the CM300 overall, a few less favorable aspects caught my attention:
- The machine‚Äôs carafe can sometimes drip slightly when pouring, which feels like a minor design oversight.
- It‚Äôs slightly noisy while warming up, louder than I‚Äôd prefer for early mornings.
- The 10-cup glass carafe, while functional, doesn‚Äôt feel as durable as some others I‚Äôve tested, and I‚Äôd be wary of accidental drops. 

**Competing Products**

Comparing the Ninja CM300 with other coffee makers in this range shows where it shines and where it might fall short. Against models like Keurig‚Äôs single-serve machines, the versatility of brewing multiple sizes‚Äîincluding a full carafe‚Äîmakes the CM300 a clear winner for households or offices with diverse coffee preferences. However, something like Breville‚Äôs higher-end machines offers a more sophisticated build quality and advanced brewing precision, albeit at a much higher price point. The CM300 might slightly lack in durability but makes up for it with its affordability and functionality. Its Over Ice function also far outperforms cheaper alternatives that often fail to brew strong iced coffee.

**Cost Efficiency**

Evaluating this coffee maker‚Äôs value proposition, I‚Äôd say it hits a nice balance of quality and cost efficiency. While rival machines with similar functionality can demand steeper prices, the Ninja CM300 proves you don‚Äôt need to spend excessively to get premium coffee-making features. Its straightforward design, reusable filter, and eco-friendliness (no pods!) could easily save you cash down the line. Considering everything it offers, it‚Äôs definitely worth adding to your kitchen lineup.

Tiny. Fluffy. Adorable. The kind of creature that melts stress faster than coffee on a deadline.

She came up to me, purring, and even jumped onto my lap like we were lifelong friends. Her eyes sparkled. I pet her. Fed her. Felt like a Disney moment.

**Until‚Ä¶**  
The magic ended.

Minutes after she left, I started **itching.**  
Not a little‚ÄîA LOT.  
Like full-body ""I-just-hugged-a-bush"" kind of itching.

Turns out, the poor kitten was carrying *something extra*‚Äîtermites, fleas, or a full ecosystem I wasn‚Äôt ready for.

I tore off my shirt like a Marvel origin story, ran to the shower, and scrubbed myself back to sanity.  
(Plot twist: no superpowers, just redness and regret.)

**Lesson learned?**  
Stray cuteness might come with stray consequences.  
Always be kind‚Äîbut also always stay alert.  
Sometimes that ""aww moment"" might need a follow-up with Dettol. üòÇ

1mhmphz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mhmphz,Woohoo! First time solo camping!,"Finally faced my fears, bought a tent, made some last-minute campsite reservations and went out on my own! I did a mini trip first to build confidence and test out my gear, so if anyone else isn‚Äôt sure how to start, here was my strategy. Disclaimer that I‚Äôm a birdwatcher, so these trips were almost entirely motivated by proximity to cool birds. 

Trip 1: One night, local (pics 1-5)
My first solo camp I did one night and picked a familiar area (somewhere I‚Äôve visited plenty of times but never stayed overnight). I found a popular campground and did some research to find a site that was slightly more secluded, so it was harder to see from the road or other sites. I know people have different safety strategies and comfort levels, but I felt better just tucking away and keeping to myself, rather than talking to my neighbors or alerting anyone to the fact I was alone. The place I stayed is close to a very suburban/urban area, so I could easily run to a store if I forgot something important or just go home if I wasn‚Äôt feeling it, but thankfully I didn‚Äôt have to do either of those things. I‚Äôd planned on doing stuff like bring a second camp chair or second set of shoes, but completely forgot. Honestly though I felt fine without. The only mildly scary thing to happen was hearing some kind of critter walking around my site at 4am and trying to get into my food locker, or hearing the pack of coyotes howling at sunrise.  

I hadn‚Äôt tent-camped with my own gear in like four years, so this was a good way to figure out everything I forgot (like a pot üòê) for next time. I did some reading, woke up early for coffee and breakfast at sunrise, did some light hiking and went home.

trip 2: two nights, new location (pics 6-10)
My second trip was two nights and somewhere farther where I‚Äôd never been before. Once again, I stayed in a secluded site at a popular campground and mostly kept to myself. This was my first time building a fire solo (I didn‚Äôt at the first place because it was too hot) and it was surprisingly hard because it was drizzling, but I figured it out lol.  I got to hear two foxes yelling at each other and an owl from my campsite, which was super cool. Woke up for sunrise both mornings, did some hiking and reading, and had a great time.

Admittedly, the first night in both places I had irrational nightmares about getting attacked by a coyote or a bear or a raccoon or whatever and didn‚Äôt sleep very well. But after nothing bad happened, I chilled out and it was fine. I did have some cell service at both campsites, so I made sure to text someone to let them know I was alive each night. Although I share my location with my friends and family anyway. Note that I wasn‚Äôt in bear country or anywhere particularly remote either time, so I didn‚Äôt take any special safety precautions, but followed general good practices like storing food safely and updating people on my location and making sure I always have extra food/water/battery power while hiking. 

Super fun trips each time and I‚Äôm so glad I had the courage to go. I lurked in this sub for a bit and read about people‚Äôs experiences before finally trying it on my own, so hopefully I can pay it forward and inspire someone like you guys inspired me!

I transferred departments at my work about 6 months ago, from logistics to operations. Previously I handled some admin duties before the transfer, and those duties stuck with me due to a remote office location and minimal people actually being in-office. Stuff like getting the mail, maintence requests for office issues like lightbulbs and A/C shit, keeping the nespresso stocked. 

Anyway. So the past year and a half-ish I‚Äôd been having issues with my boss in logistics. She wouldn‚Äôt inform me of changes in shipment setup until it was submitted for QA/QC and then would ask my why I was doing it wrong, did not tell me of all of the admin duties I‚Äôd have such as lights & A/C until after we had burnt-out lights, i was given a strict talking-to for not replacing 2 espresso pods (out of 20) in the coffee nook, and in her exact words when some of a different coworker‚Äôs haul tickets where assigned to me (no one informed me) and were processed late: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always watching and noticing things‚Äù.

There‚Äôs other stuff too but I don‚Äôt want to write the whole novel out. 

I‚Äôve gone to upper management over this. It‚Äôs exhausting. It‚Äôs also why I changed departments (also was job hunting, but the department change came up first and we‚Äôve got excellent benefits)

So today I come in and she‚Äôs gone through my desk (again) and now I can‚Äôt find stuff. She‚Äôs emailed our branch‚Äôs corporate manager about how I haven‚Äôt been forwarding the mail to the respective people and left important shit on my desk. It was all dealt with. She just wasn‚Äôt cc‚Äôed on the emails b/c they don‚Äôt involve her department, so this obviously warranted an email to corporate. 

I‚Äôve been documenting these passive aggressive things since they started and HR did get involved through the corporate manager, but there was no resolution. Is this considered harassment? Do I just keep logging the bullshit she pulls? Or do I go back to HR like ‚Äúshe‚Äôs gone through my desk and tried to tattle to higher ups about me doing stuff different than how she would, this isn‚Äôt professional.‚Äù

Or any coping strategies?

I‚Äôd been mentally and sexually unfulfilled for years. 
And at the time, I was right in the middle of a massive physical transformation‚Äî70lbs down and my confidence was climbing faster than the scale ever could. I wanted something of my own. A dirty little secret. 

I lurked in the shadows of Reddit for weeks, quietly observing the usual cheater subs. Chatted with a few nice guys, but none of them were really what I was looking for. I wasn‚Äôt after sleaze. I wasn‚Äôt here to collect bodies. I was holding out for something different‚Äîsomething rare. 

And as ridiculous as it may sound‚Ä¶ if I was going to do this, I needed it to be with someone I could actually trust. Laughable really. What I have come to learn is we are in total fucking liars and none of us can really be ‚Äútrusted‚Äù, but I digress‚Ä¶.

Then, on this very day last year, I came across a post that piqued my interest. It stood out like a needle in a stack of needles, so to speak. It spoke my language. It met me where I was.

I hesitated. Scrolled past. Came back. How do you respond to something like this? What do you even say to someone who feels like a stranger and a soul tie at the same time?

Eventually, I just‚Ä¶ opened up and let it pour out in my message and sent the longest one he‚Äôd probably ever received on that app.lol I overshared. I overspoke. I blame the Pisces in me.

That‚Äôs just who I am. A gypsy soul living La Vie Boheme. 
I connect through beautiful language and song lyrics. I march to the beat of my own drum. Where every day, no matter how mundane, is romanticized like a Shakespearean play or objectively hilarious like a British Farce. Through creation, music and theatre I bloom wherever I am planted. My art is my confessional, and he was about to become my muse.

You ever meet someone and just know?
Like the frequency you‚Äôve been humming your whole life suddenly finds its match?

That was him.

He was brilliant. A lawyer.
Effortlessly magnetic in that quiet, confident way.
His mind moved like closing arguments‚Äîsharp, deliberate, always three steps ahead with a soft smile and pokerface that never gave it away. There was a quiet arrogance about him that drew me in. 
And beyond the chemistry‚ÄîGod‚Äîhe was beautiful.
That face. That smile. That little sideways grin that made it impossible to look away.
And when I tell you he matched my freak in ways my husband never could‚Ä¶it scared me‚Ä¶but I always wanted more. But it wasn‚Äôt just lust‚Äîit was mental. A dopamine drip. I craved him in ways I didn‚Äôt have words for. And do I seem like the kind of girl that ever has a lack of words? üòè Nah. 
Tale as old as time, right?

We talked all day, every day for months. Our language,  a cocktail of pop culture references, song lyrics, movie lines and metaphor. We learned the intricacies of each others passions, fears, kinks, annoyances, and dreams. One continuous conversation that never needed a hello or goodbye. But it wasn‚Äôt just connection‚Äîit felt mirroring. He‚Äôd say things that sent chills up my spine because I was already typing the same exact words. Verbatim. I‚Äôd have to backspace and rephrase just so I didn‚Äôt look unhinged. üòÇ

It was weird. Freaky. Impossible.
But I notice shit like that. Like when you look at the clock and it reads 11:11, not just once but twice a day, everyday, for weeks. No coincidences. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôd lived the same life. 
And I believe‚Äîtruly‚Äîthat we come across certain people for a reason.
To be tested. To be challenged. 
Or sometimes, to learn the kind of connection we never want to lose again.


He made me feel beautiful. 
Not in a cheap Julia Robert‚Äôs/ Richard Gere Pretty Woman kinda way‚Ä¶
But in a way that healed something quiet and neglected in me.

After years of feeling invisible, I finally felt seen. 
And I‚Äîsomeone modest, someone private‚Äîsuddenly loved sharing pieces of myself with him.

Voice notes. Videos. Little glimpses into my soul.
Photos that still have me clutching my pearls.
(Seriously‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what the fuck came over me. üòÖ)

But with him‚Ä¶ it felt safe. I was calm. I was kind to myself in ways I‚Äôd never been before.
Each photo, each clip, was less about seduction‚Äîand more about self-love. About reclaiming a body I‚Äôd spent a lifetime hiding.

And with that comfort came power.
Y‚Äôall‚Ä¶ I thrived.

Every project I touched was fire.
Every idea I had turned to gold.
The money flowed. The praise rolled in. And I moved like a woman who knew exactly who the fuck she was.

He didn‚Äôt give me the talent. I had that all along. But I do think the way he made me feel put me in a mood that inspired me to be fearless with it. 

Was that feeling love, I‚Äôm sure you are all asking yourself? No. It wasn‚Äôt. Frankly, I hate that word in a romantic sense and told him I wouldn‚Äôt fall in love with him‚Ä¶ and he told me not to speak too soon. I‚Äôm not sure what you would call how I felt about him. It was a lot of things. Mostly respect, appreciation, admiration, and yes, lust. He was great at his job and I admired the good he was doing in the world. I cared about him and his thoughts and opinions mattered to me. His quirky humor and sarcasm was just like mine and it made my days better.  It made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt alone. 

There was always something sort of sad about him though. Like I always had this gut feeling the poor guy was carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders and there was something about it that made me‚Ä¶idk‚Ä¶want to make him happy. I especially liked making him laugh because I got the feeling that maybe it was the only time that day he stopped to smile. I wanted to give him an escape. He once said ‚Äúlooking forward to talking to you is like‚Ä¶the feeling you get when you find a $20 bill in your coat pocket that first cold day‚Äù. He made me melt even when I was so afraid to. 

Does somebody wanna guess what happens next? 

Ghosted. üòë

Despite it being one of the first declarations we made to one another‚Äîthat we‚Äôd never just disappear‚Ä¶that was exactly what was happening. Nobody ever talks about that last text. The one you send that you get no reply to. 


‚ÄúAre you ok?‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶


It just sits and sits, unread. That uncomfortable sense of panic eats you alive. Hours turn into days turn into weeks and everything you thought this was or could have been just plays on a continuous loop as you search for answers that are not coming. Until that gut wrenching realization that you didn‚Äôt mean shit to this person. You were just a space filler, a distraction, a phase. It makes you question everything and everyday feels like a fucking nightmare you can‚Äôt wake up from. 

The deafening silence that comes with ghosting in an affair type situation is a pain I‚Äôll never be able to fully explain. You are totally and completely alone with your thoughts. You can‚Äôt vent to a best friend. You can‚Äôt show any emotion in front of your significant other. You feel physically sick and guess what? You can‚Äôt just crawl in bed and cry it out. Life just has to keep going on without that person in it, like nothing ever happened. I‚Äôd wake up, paint on a smile, and face the world like I hadn‚Äôt just been betrayed on the cruelest level. The performance was truly Oscar-worthy.

I tried everything to forget‚ÄîThe gym. Work. Other men.
But nothing touched the ache. Nothing muted the noise of his silence.
Nothing made any of it make sense.

The not knowing why to the questioning everything he ever said and if any of it was true. Trying to distinguish real from fake and truth from lie. That feeling of vulnerability and wishing I hadn‚Äôt given so much of myself to him. 

One day I woke up and decided I was going to use every ounce of pain I felt to fuel my progress. I had come so far, I couldn‚Äôt let this fuck up everything I had worked for. I never missed a workout. I woke up early to run. I lifted at night. It was therapy. The only way I could clear my head was to get lost in self improvement. I made it my mission to find a silver lining in all of this. Art was my therapist and my body was my canvas. Drowning myself in music helped too. Listening to the blues and testing out vocals I once was too rookie for. My voice had changed a little, my range had a raspy touch of soul in it that wasn‚Äôt there before. Maybe heartbreak does that. Unlocks things in you that you didn‚Äôt know you had. I knocked the dust off my journal and started putting pen to paper, writing everything I felt, laced with rhyme. I forgot how talented I could be with lyrics when my heart was broken. 

Then again, I had forgotten a lot of things about myself over the last 10 years. Parts of me I had to rediscover all over again in order to heal from the string of swift blows to the face this last couple of years had dealt. 

It was time to move on, get back in the ring, and meet someone new. I posted my first ISO AP post and the floodgates of fuckboys burst wide open. üôÑ I have never seen so many unsolicited dick pics in all my life. LOL. Guys looking for ONS hookups, couples wanting to add another woman, sex party invites, men with fetishes I couldn‚Äôt even Google without cringing.

Y‚Äôall‚Äîthis was not why I came here. For Christ‚Äôs sake, I was only looking for plant care instructions and an emotionally mature, affair partner. Is that so much to ask for??? üòÇ

But deep down, I didn‚Äôt want just anyone. I wanted my person back and the universe must have known.

So whether by coincidence or his carefully orchestrated reentry‚Ä¶ there he was. That familiar username. Right back in my DM‚Äôs. Did he know it was me? Yeah. He had to have known.
But why come back that way?
It felt like an attempt to sidestep the wreckage he‚Äôd left behind, like he wanted back in without confronting the mess he made. After months of building a case in my head, I was finally ready to cross-examine.
I asked him why he ghosted me. He told me he‚Äôd been depressed, spiraling in his head over some past heartbreak, and he didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want to hear from him again.

I didn‚Äôt buy it. Not fully. But the truth? I didn‚Äôt care. I just felt like‚Äîfor the first time in months‚ÄîI could breathe.

And just like that‚Ä¶ we were back.
Everything between us ignited again, like it had just been waiting‚Äîa flame tucked beneath the surface, smoldering all along. We synced in every possible way.
Conversation so effortless even the silence felt like foreplay.

Then he asked me to coffee.

And suddenly, I was nervous.
Shit, I was terrified. What if the chemistry didn‚Äôt translate? What if he didn‚Äôt like me? 

He picked the most perfect little coffee shop in the city. On a perfect sunny day where we could hide behind our dark glasses and steal glances of one another while sipping coffee, black. Chain smoking cigarettes and exchanging the best conversation. We were both awkward and calm all at once, like two scared kids with old souls. He kissed me before I left. It was a little clumsy and kind of adorable‚Äîhe made me so nervous in the best way. I got in my car. It was 11:11. It was like the universe telling me ‚Äúthis one, he‚Äôs special‚Äù. 

Afterwards, we acknowledged the obvious: mutual attraction. He hinted at seeing me again several times and we talked for a few more weeks. But something changed. Nothing progressed. The connection started to glitch. His energy felt different. He pulled back. His messages lost their depth. It confused the hell out of me. I had worked so hard to become secure in myself‚Ä¶ why was I suddenly spiraling with anxiety? Why did I feel like I was chasing breadcrumbs from someone who used to be so uniquely open with his thoughts.

I asked him directly. Why the shift? He said he was overwhelmed with work and home and didn‚Äôt have the emotional bandwidth for anything beyond friendship.

Friend-zoned. üòë

I was completely stunned. Crushed. It felt like I was being rejected by this man all over again. What happened to that insanely electric chemistry we once had? Something that felt so real suddenly felt like a fucking twisted fever dream. Did I just make all of this up in my head? Lol 
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever felt so stupid in all my life. For putting myself out there, for opening myself up to such rejection, for sharing intimate details of my life and believing I was safe. 


We kept talking, sure, but it was surface-level. Empty. His emotional depth dried up like a goddamn desert.
And slowly, he became a stranger. Cold. Distant. Unrecognizable.

I couldn‚Äôt keep doing it. I couldn‚Äôt keep hurting myself trying to decode a man who refused to speak in anything but riddles. If dodging my advances were an Olympic event, this man could have represented our country well.
My gut told me the connection was real. But my heart? It was exhausted from trying to prove it. The show didn‚Äôt feel like it was over, but it definitely felt like it was time to exit stage left‚Ä¶ or at the very least, disappear through the trap door. 

So I ghosted him.
Not out of hatred for him but a final act of self love for me. 

And in that space, I bloomed.
I smirked at the woman I saw in the mirror. Strong, confident, radiant. My body a temple sculpted from tears and tenacity.
The kind of pain that ruins some women had turned this one into a fucking savage.

This was my villain era. üòâ 

I reached within and pulled out the showstopper that was always in me. Traded in oversized clothes for sexy little opening numbers that didn‚Äôt just hug my curves‚Äîthey negotiated plea deals with them.

I walked like I owned the room, because I did.
And if he‚Äôd seen me walk in that night‚Äîtight black sequin dress, red lips and eyes that could read any man like closing arguments‚Äî

He would‚Äôve known he fucked up. 

I was turning heads everywhere I went, getting chased by men I once would‚Äôve killed for attention from‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶but not by the one I wanted. 

And let me tell you‚Äîthat shit messes with your head.
To finally feel beautiful and the one everyone wants‚Ä¶ and still be invisible to him.
It felt like the universe was laughing in my face.

That‚Äôs when I started researching attachment theory.
I had to understand what the fuck happened here. 
I needed to know why something that felt so real and so good had turned into such a masterclass in emotional torture. How someone who seemed so authentic ended up feeling like a mirage.

And then I found it: dismissive avoidant attachment.
It clicked. All of it.
Or maybe, my paranoid little heart whispered, there was someone else the entire time‚Äîand I was just a placeholder.

The third fiddle. Maybe even the fourth.
To be ranked behind a spouse is one thing, you have to accept that with grit and grace. But to feel ranked behind everyone in this fucked up line of succession is a whole other level of humiliation and shame.

His push-pull bullshit. His hot-and-cold. The crumbs he tossed to keep me hanging on his every word. I had to accept the most painful truth of all:

That version of him I fell for in the beginning was never coming back.
Maybe it never existed to begin with. Maybe he just collects broken hearts like baseball cards and I just was just another notch in his proverbial Reddit bedpost. 

So I turned to the gym. To work. To sweat and silence.
I cried in the shower like it was ritual. 
And then‚Äîbecause I‚Äôm human, and heartbreak makes you dumb as fuck and delusional‚ÄîI sent him a message. Because maybe I was wrong. Maybe he did miss me. Maybe he was suffering like I was. 

Conversation picked back up‚Äîbut it was hollow, empty words. 
Then one day, I caught something weird but oh so telling. 
He sent a bunch of messages that he quickly deleted. I never saw them, but he immediately gave me some over-explained story about helping console a friend going through a divorce. ü§î and that‚Äôs when I realized. 

I thought lawyers were suppose to be good liars. 

There was someone else this whole time and I didn‚Äôt need a fucking law degree to know it. Its an instinct, an intuition, and one I will never ignore again. I didn‚Äôt need a private investigator to know he was full of shit. I didn‚Äôt need his bullshit story to know that ‚Äúfriend‚Äù is the woman who broke his heart before I ever sent that first message‚Ä¶and I couldn‚Äôt compete for him anymore. 


And now, it‚Äôs been over a month.
Not a single word. Not a single check-in.
I could be dead, and he wouldn‚Äôt even know.

And still, he hasn‚Äôt blocked me.
Why?
To leave the door cracked open‚Ä¶just in case?
Or is he too cowardly to shut it completely?
Either way, I‚Äôm left in purgatory.

Some days, it feels like something precious was stolen from me.
Other days, I wonder if I ever stood a chance.
But my intuition? It tells me someone else had his heart.

‚∏ª

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned:

Attachment styles matter. Deeply.
Some of us crave closeness and clarity. Others fear it like it‚Äôs a threat to survival.
What feels like safety to me might feel like pressure or suffocation to someone else.

Avoidants aren‚Äôt villains. But without awareness, they leave collateral damage in their wake.
Had I understood him better, maybe I could‚Äôve communicated in ways he could receive.
But that‚Äôs not a burden I should have had to bear alone. 

And people with anxious attachment‚Äîlike me‚Äîwe‚Äôre not ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù
We‚Äôre just wired to crave emotional safety. And wanting that doesn‚Äôt make us dramatic or needy.
It makes us self-aware. 
I know what I need from a connection and I have to love myself enough to walk away from things that don‚Äôt feel reciprocal and frankly shady as fuck. 

Another myth? ‚ÄúThey would if they wanted to.‚Äù
Sometimes, fear robs people of more things than failure ever could. 
People sabotage feelings not because they don‚Äôt feel them, but because they do‚Äîand it terrifies them.

So I‚Äôm writing this here‚Äîpart confession, part funeral, part open letter to anyone who‚Äôs been here too.
If you‚Äôre going through it: be kind to yourself.
This shit makes you question everything. It makes you ache in places you didn‚Äôt even know had nerve endings.

But listen to me:
If you are ‚Äútoo much‚Äù for someone, let them be bored with someone who will never be enough, who will never be you. If you catch yourself trying to fix someone who doesn‚Äôt want to be fixed. Fix yourself, instead. 
If they make you feel like your boundaries are unreasonable, let them trample all over someone else‚Äôs. 
Your peace is your lifeline. Guard it with everything you have. 


As for him‚Ä¶
He‚Äôll probably always feel like unfinished business.
I‚Äôll probably always wonder: what if?
But I do hope he finds someone kind. Someone safe. Someone who makes him laugh and cares about him in the gentle way he needs. I hope she takes the time to understand him the way I have‚Ä¶. And sooner than I could.


I‚Äôve come here to our coffee shop every day this week to pen this little piece of closure I never got. I find it extra ironic it falls on the same day I met him on Reddit‚Ä¶But really‚Ä¶in my life‚Ä¶not all that ironic at all. I thought by the time I finished this piece, I‚Äôd be so mad I‚Äôd be ready to walk away with my head held high and never think of him again. Truth is, I‚Äôll never forget him. 

It didn‚Äôt help that today, 
On the first cold afternoon
when I reached into my coat pocket, I pulled out a crisp twenty-dollar bill.
Isn‚Äôt it funny?
How healing sneaks up on you in the most fucked up and beautifully ironic ways. 
I‚Äôm going to be ok. 
it‚Äôs 11:11.

My professor just scheduled our exam review for 10am on Wednesday. Two months ago, through a prior connection, I was able to schedule a coffee meeting with an associate at a larger law firm that was also scheduled for 10am on Wednesday. Now I'm not too sure what to do.

  
Should I email the attorney and ask them to meet at 11 instead? Do I skip the review session and just meet at the og time? Should I ask the associate to just completely reschedule and go to the exam review? Both are equally important to me but this will also be my first law school exam ever.

You have been writing for your head. I know that this shit is talking back at you since you were a mere teenage self,  you see.  You go and write poetry on your scars,  a trap that surrounds you every night, sometime in the middle of the day,  when you are having your coffee after a long time. The same song on the loop,  this is how you look when you talk to yourself in the mirror. Have you ever loved someone? Or have you always been in a hurry to be left alone? You see this world has a lot of things to do than walking alone on the beach, feet soaked in the sand. Those sands make your wound bleed whenever they touch your skin. 

Do you bleed out of guilt?  Or Do you keep your wound alive,  when you pierce your skin every night? When have you painted the canvas last time? You said you like the smell of the paint. You said you want to color the whole wall into black.  I see there are a few drops of red left on the wall.  That red stain‚Äì you call it a beautiful mistake.  

I have seen you sitting alone in the shade of a tree when winters come. Why winters they ask? It's calm and alone outside‚Äì you answer. You have written in solitude,  surrounded by people,  walking home back, sitting in the dark,  with music, and with tears in your eyes. You urged for people who couldn't be yours, they were never!  You see you have penned down the scripture of your world,  that lies inside your eyes, alive over your skin. You composed poetry out of their memories,  just bringing them into this world not necessarily your beloved but of your mind. You have written them in your poetry,  most of the time. 

Dear you, I have seen you rising through the ashes. Half dead and alive every time. Your heart pumps out of poetry and that filters your scars into the word, with each drop of ink in your hand. I heard you felt the aura again. You have written their name on your vacant page. I am watching you blushing these days sitting near the window. I speak to you for you. I want to listen to those melodies which you bring into written notes.

I‚Äôm not religious. Not spiritual. Not even superstitious. I fix roofs for a living, drink my coffee black, and fall asleep to old war documentaries on the couch. Simple man. Simple life.
But that changed when my daughter started talking about her boyfriend.
 Her imaginary boyfriend.
Her name is Lily. She‚Äôs seven years old. Blonde hair. Soft eyes. Loves jelly sandwiches with the crusts cut off. She‚Äôs the kind of kid who leaves notes in my lunchbox that say ‚ÄúI love you Dad‚Äù with little doodles of stick figures and smiling suns.
Her mother died when she was four. Car accident. I was the one who had to tell her. I remember holding her while she cried, saying over and over, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Daddy. I still have you.‚Äù
So yeah. It‚Äôs just been us two since then. And we‚Äôve made it work.
Until about a month ago.
That‚Äôs when she told me about Peter.

I was washing dishes after dinner. She sat at the table, swinging her legs, humming something tuneless.
‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù she asked.
 ‚ÄúYeah, sweetie?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúDo you wanna meet my boyfriend?‚Äù
I chuckled.
 ‚ÄúYour boyfriend? Aren‚Äôt you a little young for that?‚Äù
She giggled. ‚ÄúHe says age doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù
That gave me pause.
‚Äú‚Ä¶Who‚Äôs ‚Äòhe‚Äô?‚Äù
‚ÄúPeter,‚Äù she said, like I was dumb for not knowing. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs nice. He plays games with me in my room. And he says he‚Äôs gonna marry me when I turn eight.‚Äù
I dried my hands and knelt next to her.
 ‚ÄúYou know imaginary friends aren‚Äôt real, right?‚Äù
She frowned.
 ‚ÄúHe is real. He just doesn‚Äôt like when grown-ups see him.‚Äù
That night, I checked her room before bed. Looked under the bed. In the closet. Usual parent stuff. Nothing there. Just a few dolls, some drawings, and her nightlight glowing purple.
I kissed her goodnight.
 As I closed the door, I thought I heard whispering.
I figured it was her playing pretend.
But then things started to get‚Ä¶ strange.

I‚Äôd wake up and find her bedroom door wide open.
 Lights on.
 Stuff moved around.
I once found all her dolls piled in the bathtub, their heads turned toward the door like they were waiting for someone.
I asked her about it.
 ‚ÄúPeter likes to redecorate,‚Äù she said.
Another night, I heard music playing softly from her room.
 I opened the door ‚Äî it was one of those creepy music box lullabies, but we don‚Äôt own a music box.
She was sitting cross-legged on the floor, staring at the corner.
 Smiling.
There was nothing there.
I asked her who she was looking at.
 She said, ‚ÄúPeter‚Äôs showing me what he looks like.‚Äù
I asked her to describe him.
 She said, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs really tall. Like, taller than the ceiling. But he bends down to talk to me.‚Äù
That‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt sit right.

The drawings were next.
It started with one taped to the fridge. Innocent enough. Crayons. Blue sky. Green grass. Stick figures.
At first glance, I thought nothing of it. Lily always drew her and her mom, or her with a princess crown, or holding balloons.
But this one was different.
In the middle stood a small figure ‚Äî clearly Lily ‚Äî wearing her favorite yellow dress, the one with the bunny on it.
 She was holding hands with something tall. Much taller than the trees behind them.
The figure was black. Not colored black ‚Äî pressed black. Like she had pressed the crayon so hard the paper had torn in places.
It had no face. No arms. Just long, stretching fingers reaching from where the hands should be.
 And its head ‚Äî a tall, oblong oval with slashes where eyes shouldn‚Äôt be.
There were no clouds in the sky. No sun. Just red streaks hanging from above, like bleeding rain.
I called her over.
 ‚ÄúSweetie‚Ä¶ who‚Äôs this?‚Äù
 She smiled proudly.
 ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me and Peter. We‚Äôre playing outside.‚Äù
I tried to keep my voice even. ‚ÄúAnd the red lines?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúThose are sky scratches. Peter said they happen when he‚Äôs happy.‚Äù

I found more over the next few days.
In her backpack.
 Under her pillow.
 One taped inside her closet.
Each one worse than the last.
Peter standing in her doorway, impossibly thin, with arms that reached the floor.
 Peter curled up at the foot of her bed with a mouth stretching across his entire chest.
 Peter floating outside my window, staring in.
But the one that shook me the most‚Ä¶
She drew my room.
 And it was exact. Down to the crooked lamp on my nightstand and the crack on the ceiling.
In the picture, I was asleep.
 And standing over me was Peter.
 His hand inches from my face.
 His head tilted unnaturally far to the left.
And in the top corner, written in her uneven handwriting:
 ‚ÄúPeter says he likes you.‚Äù

That night at dinner, I asked her gently.
 ‚ÄúLily‚Ä¶ why did you draw that one of me sleeping?‚Äù
She didn‚Äôt even look up from her mashed potatoes.
 ‚ÄúHe told me to.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy does he want you to draw him?‚Äù
She paused. Then shrugged.
 ‚ÄúHe likes pictures. He says they make things realer. And he thinks you look silly when you snore.‚Äù
I felt cold. Like something just walked across my grave.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep.
Every creak of the house made me twitch.
 I left the hallway light on like I was the kid now.
At 3:12 a.m., I woke with a start. No dream. Just woke.
 Like something whispered in my ear.
The air felt off. Stale.
I sat up.
 The bedroom door was wide open.
I never sleep with it open.
I stared at the doorway, heart hammering.
 Darkness seemed thicker out there ‚Äî not just absence of light, but something‚Ä¶ watching.
And faintly, just barely, I thought I saw something long and tall slip out of view ‚Äî as if it had been standing there a second before.

I tried to be rational. I even considered taking her to a child psychologist.
But then she stopped eating.
 Stopped playing.
 Just sat in her room, mumbling.
I started recording her at night. Set up an old baby monitor with motion detection.
 I didn‚Äôt expect to catch anything. I wanted proof nothing was happening.
I wish I hadn‚Äôt looked.
At 2:44 a.m., her door opened by itself.
 No wind. No creaks. It opened.
 Then ‚Äî slowly ‚Äî her blanket slid off the bed.
She didn‚Äôt wake up.
 Something moved by the foot of her bed. Not quite visible, just‚Ä¶ shadows distorting.
The camera glitched.
 Just once.
 When it came back, the room was empty.
So was her bed.
I ran to her room in a panic ‚Äî but she was there, curled up in the corner, eyes wide open, whispering:
‚ÄúHe took me to the inside-out place.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt get her to explain.
 She just kept saying the same thing:
 ‚ÄúPeter has a place. It‚Äôs quiet there. No skin, no sound, no time.‚Äù
I told her Peter had to go.
 She started screaming.
 Said if I made him leave, he‚Äôd get angry.
She told me:
 ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt like when people say he‚Äôs not real. That‚Äôs when he gets messy.‚Äù

I started burning the drawings.
 Threw away the nightlight.
 Put salt at her window, like some old superstition. I was desperate.
That night, I heard Lily talking again.
I stood outside her door.
 Listened.
Her voice was shaky.
 ‚ÄúNo, please don‚Äôt make me. Please. I‚Äôll be good. Don‚Äôt hurt Daddy.‚Äù
I threw the door open.
No one was there but her.
She looked at me with tear-streaked cheeks.

 Sometimes whispers in a voice that doesn‚Äôt sound like hers.

 I thought kids grew out of them.

But I know this:
 When Lily turns eight‚Ä¶
 She says they‚Äôre getting married.

Would love some advice: If you were going to put a bucket of dahlias at your local coffee shop with the goal of making some money to donate to a good cause + help fund your own dahlia obsession, would you:

a.) Say it's freewill donation and promote the charity you're donating to?  
b.) Put a price per stem - if so much, how much?  
c.) or would I be better off to bundle a few dahlias together (I don't have other flowers, just dahlias) and put a price on that? (this is more work that I'm hoping to do, but if this is the best way I'll consider)

Mainly I'm trying to keep this low lift on my end. Just want to share my extra blooms for people to enjoy. And would love if I can make a little $$ to give back. I don't think the general population probably knows/understand the amount of work that goes into dahlias, so trying to find the right balance on a cost vs. just wanting to share joy.

## FAQs Section

Consumers frequently seek answers to common questions before purchasing a pineapple candle.

**What is the best type of wax for a pineapple candle?**
Soy wax is often considered the best choice due to its clean-burning properties, eco-friendliness, and ability to hold fragrance well. Paraffin wax is a more affordable option, but it may produce more soot. Beeswax is a natural alternative with a subtle honey-like scent and long burn time.**How can I maximize the burn time of my pineapple candle?**
To maximize burn time,always trim the wick to about 1/4 inch before each use. This helps prevent smoking and ensures an even burn. Avoid burning the candle for more than 3-4 hours at a time. Also, keep the candle away from drafts and other sources of airflow, which can cause uneven burning.

**Are pineapple candles safe to use around pets and children?**

I am trying my first 3 Days Fast.

Which started on the wrong foot because I wanted to do a lot at the same time.

My last food intake was 20 hours ago.

Since, only water, 1 black coffee and 1 lemon&ginger tea.

Plus meds:  I took my 2 daily Fluoxetine Pills and my first ever Naltrexone Pill which was the worst idea ever because I felt extremely nauseous, dizzy, my head hurt and for a good 5 hours+ I felt like I was going to throw up at any moment.

Naturally, I will stop the Naltrexone (at the very least for the duration of the fasting) but I decided to stop also the Fluoxetine and the Trazadone I take for the next 3 days. Coffee too.

I am going with water and tea only. Or maybe you can suggest me something to add to ""the menu""?

Did the pills in any way already break the fast?

And can you help me with suggestions, namely on how to deal with the headache and the feeling sick/about to throw up that still remains from the darn Naltrexone?

Also accepting some cheering on, mind you haha

Well, that's how it felt to adventure in Algonquin Park yesterday morning. Both Kristen Fox and I absolutely adore Bon Echo for many different reasons, but we both stopped dead in our tracks yesterday and said we fell in love with Algonquin. 

We got up around 3 AM, hit the wide open road from Cloyne, up through Combemere, Barry's Bay and Whitney to get to the East Beach picnic area where we would launch our kayaks onto the Madawaska River at the Lake of Two Rivers. We would then venture South into Pog Lake which is hardly identifiable because of the intensely dense fog that blanketed the area greatly reducing visibility.

We made great progress and ended up at the first and only portage of the day, a small 50m, and easily navigated, trail to get back on the water. We stopped here for a quick snack and got on our way, paddling through winding waterways with the hopes on our hearts and mind we could possibly see a moose along the river bank at each corner that revealed new landscapes to the both of us.

Along the way we got see loons up close, a blue heron hunting, a Downy woodpecker chipping away, a muskrat swimming, endless beautiful misty landscapes and more.

Once we got to Whitefish Lake we turned around and made our way back up the river, back to the portage and back to where we started. This time, the heavy fog had lifted revealing endless gorgeous landscapes, rolling hills, tall pines and sandy beaches.

After loading up we stopped at the Lake of Two Rivers Grocery and Camp Store for a great traditional breakfast with much needed coffee. We checked out the shop after as well. On our way back, I wanted to stop at the visitor centre to check out the new Fork Lake hiking trail with the cool boardwalk. Well, this is where things took a turn LOL. The trail is difficult, it says it's 2.4km but I felt like it was double that. The inclines and declines are steep. Extremely steep. I can't begin to explain how steep. After a near 15km kayak and a hearty breakfast on my tummy, I was definitely struggling. Even though it was morning, that offered no relief from the heat and humidity. We were bug bitten, soaked in sweat and all wobbly legged by the time we got done. I have instructed Kristen to say NO if I stop and say, ""let's check out this trail!"" Hahaha

We had a lot of friends in common and we both studied in the same place for about 7 years before, but somehow we never met. We finally met via a common friend.

She was feeling depressed, I was feeling depressed and we connected very quickly, even went to dinner together. We chatted everyday ever since to vent and laugh together.

I fell in love, but she had a boyfriend. He was not in the city, and I think that was at least part of her sadness at the time. I feel a deep hatred and jealousy of him, to the point I can barely look him in the face. I told her that and that I am in love for her, so she avoids being with him when we are together. She says I'm very important to her and she values our friendship.

We did everything together. We went to movies just the two of us, picnic on the park, I visited her house a lot of times, went to dinner together. It felt like we were dating, but we weren't. And she still had her boyfriend.

During these three years I decided it was too much for me to handle. I decided to step back from our relationship. She cried a lot. We were distant for about one year, during which we barely spoke and I felt like she hated me. I felt empty and I obviously didn't want to hurt her. By the time I told her to have some distance I knew she was getting better, she had friends and her boyfriend was living again in the city. I still think she doesn't know that even hurting so much, I still thought about her well-being.

She then told me that she had a gift for me. She remembered that I told I needed a coffee machine and she got one from her parents. 

We started talking again. It felt weird. We were both uncomfortable due to being one year apart. But we grew close to each other again. It feels like the old times again during most part of the time.

I had to move. I bought her a parting gift. During our goodbye she gave me a long and strong hug. She said she'll miss me so much and that I should visit often. When she arrived home she texted saying that she had bought me a gift, but it wouldn't arrive in time, so I had to visit her again to get it.

This one last interaction, the hug, the tenderness in her voice, the tears from the goodbye. It's looping in my mind ever since. I cannot let her go and I feel a strong urge to come back to her and hug her again. Her smell keeps returning to me. I keep dreaming about her. Why does she keep me around to suffer like this?

I was making espresso shots in the espresso machine for an order and that‚Äôs when I saw my hands shaking. I didn‚Äôt feel hungry at all (well, I never do) and I had eaten a bowl of cereal with almond milk probably about 6 hours earlier. That‚Äôs all I had eaten for the day at that point because I‚Äôm just never hungry and I have no appetite. I had been drinking a sugar free mocha iced coffee with almond milk and I thought that would hold me over until I got out of work and I planned on going home and eating dinner. Well, after I had the order finished, I turned around and resumed reading the closing cleaning list I had been reading before the order came in. Suddenly I was really hot. We have really good AC where I work, so it didn‚Äôt make sense to me. Then I got nauseous and thought I was going to throw up for a second. The words I was trying to read got really blurry and then the next thing I know I hear my coworker saying, ‚ÄúOh my gosh! Are you okay?!‚Äù and I realized I was on the floor. I have never passed out a day in my life! Everyone came and helped me up and had me sit on the bathroom floor in case it happened again. I could barely see, my vision was really weird and grainy and almost in black and white. The pinky and ring fingers on both my hands were tingling like they had been asleep and had pins and needles. The left side of my head hurt because I hit my head on the floor. It was all really scary and confusing because nothing like that had ever happened to me before. After my vision finally cleared, the head manager, who‚Äôs a really nice woman, drove me home and drove my husband back so he could drive our car home, which is a 16 mile drive one way. That was so nice of her! Then she gave me today and tomorrow off so I can recover, which is also really nice and no other job I have ever worked at would have done that. As a matter of fact, anywhere else I‚Äôve worked would have only given me like 5 minutes and would have wanted me back on the floor. I came home and felt exhausted with a headache and now today I still feel exhausted with a headache. I know it was a low blood sugar attack, the worst one I‚Äôve ever had in my life. Research says Wegovy causes low blood sugar. I‚Äôm not diabetic and I‚Äôm not on diabetic meds, which research says more commonly causes it, but I got it anyway. I‚Äôve lost a total of 115 pounds with 93 pounds left to go and I do not want to stop the Wegovy and gain it all back. I lost 150 pounds in 2014 on my own, but I have food addiction, so I lost control and gained it all back plus more and I do NOT want that to happen again! I need the Wegovy so it can silence the food addiction and allow me to successfully eat right and exercise and not fail again. Since research says eating sugar will make the Wegovy not work, I have only been allowing myself what sugar is in fresh fruit and I don‚Äôt eat that everyday, either. So do any of you know how to prevent low blood sugar attacks on Wegovy so this won‚Äôt happen ever again? I know I should start eating SOME sugar and apparently protein shakes are supposed to help, but have any of you experienced this? Do you know what else I could do to make this scary situation never happen again? Thanks! ",1,1754333833.0,Wegovy,0,1.0,False

\- begins with a man speaking to a therapist, but he shoots her

\- I think this was a delusion because he is actually in a coffee shop

\- he leaves the shop, goes down the street, and gets hit by a bus as a little boy on the bus watches

\- I know the little boy is important, I believe we find out he is a character in the story when he is much older

\- I believe that a character was working on an olive farm during a part of this movie (I think this part is not in English, or maybe the whole movie is not in English?)

\- in the end, a woman who was narrating the movie appears and is telling the story to an audience. I believe we were following so many different people to find out how her mom and dad met

2nd Anniversary. Mumbo Jumbo Brewery. IPA - New England / Hazy. 7% alc. 15 IBU.
Very fine. Silky, I love it. A good herbal cannabis kick, delicious, with notes of stone fruit and white grapes. Very nice, and by far the best Mumbo Jumbo beer I've tried to date.

P9. Garage Beer Co. Sour - Fruited Berliner Weisse. 4% alc.
It improves with each sip. Absolute dominance of the currant and passion fruit, with a significant but pleasant acidity that invites you to sip again. It's OK, but nothing to write home about.

Delicious herbal aroma. Tropical flavors of mango, stone fruit of nectarine on the mouth. It's a truly juicy IPA,  to drink hundreds and many more.

Damn, really tasty. Delicious, sweet, creamy, and cakey. Light coffee, lots of cocoa, blueberry notes, and baked sponge cake. Very fine. Where's the alcohol? A very nice Imperial Pastry Stout from Basqueland, to sip leisurely and enjoy.",10,1754333713.0,CraftBeer,1,1.0,False

Out of nowhere his cousin says ‚ÄúNowadays 2 out of every 3 married women are in an extramarital affair.‚Äù

I know his family. He has two elder sisters both married. So I just casually asked him, ‚ÄúOkay bhai, then out of your mom and two sisters, who‚Äôs the one without an affair?‚Äù

Bas itne me he bhai got super offended, the whole vibe got heated and uncomfortable. But thankfully my friend handled it and took him away.

Edit: I don‚Äôt get one thing. Why does it always seem like people in this country believe all women are sluts except for their own sisters and daughters?

She was a tomboy cis girl, I had never dated a cis girl me being a trans girl, on Tinder and Bumble normally only men like me for some reason (I hate men), very rarely do women like me and even more rarely do they make a conversation last, the fact that she wanted to go out with me surprised me.

We talked a lot, we talked about our goals and dreams. She told me that she had been dating a lot of girls and said that there was rarely a spark or interesting conversations. I felt like we had a good time. She made it clear to me several times that she had a good time and that she wanted to continue dating me. There were awkward moments, like when she bought a stuffed animal and was invited to a party, so she gave me the stuffed animal to keep at my house so she wouldn't take it to the party, and so I could give it to her another day.

Because of rain, I invite her to have coffee at my house, but I forgot my mom, my aunt and my grandmother were visiting, it was funny because she ended up making fun of me  for it in a good way because now she knew my family, but I already felt that she didn't want anything with me, then she invited me to the party, she was going to see another trans girl also from bumble, although this girl was more like she wanted to be alone, after drinking a little, the main girl went to smoke several times, and at one point, she asked me to go with her, she asked if I liked her, I told her yes, she told me to close my eyes and kissed me very intensely, then she told me that she wanted to try a 3-way kiss with the other girl, in the end my cell phone ran out of battery and I couldn't call another taxi for myself, she invited me to her house.

When we arrived, she wanted to have sex with me, she wanted to do it with the light off, I thought she was going to have a problem with my penis but she even asked me if I still used it and I told her yes, and it's been years since I had sex with a cisgender girl, it didn't last long because she told me she wanted to go to sleep, in the end she wanted to sleep spooning with me, I felt her warmth nice, in the end she had to do something early, I left and she told me for the last time that she had a good time.

I told her that I arrived home safely, she told me that she was fine and wished me a good day, it was weird because at first I didn't see her WhatsApp photo, then I saw it because I guess she added me and answered me... then I stopped seeing it... then I saw that she deleted her Bumble account, I called her later because the WhatsApp messages weren't coming in, she told me that she returned with her ex and she wanted to do the things right with her.

I feel happy for her but damn, I don't want to feel like this again, I don't know what to think, I don't know if I was used, I don't know if she was just wanting to have an experience, I don't know what ti do with this feeling.

I am a manager at my city's aquatics programs and have been promoted up the lifeguard positions over 3+ years. My city is fairly large, almost becoming a huge city in Texas such as San Antonio. While it's still developing larger, we live in Texas, aka 100+ degree heat all summer long. We have 4 pools & facilities, out of those 4, 2 of them are broken beyond repair (water pump broke turned pool green while lessons were happening) and only 1 has AC. Every summer it's like the hunger games with the staff on who will be sent to the ""bad pool"". This pool is connected to a park and it's so worn down and out of working conditions since it's only used in summers. There is dog poop, infestations of insects, and no ac or trees to block out the heat; as well as it's a 35-45 min drive for everyone since it's on the opposite side of town near the border (also not the best area). I've been ""banished"" to this location for 3 years straight with only one big orange home depot fan to share amongst about 10-15 staff including guards, cashiers, and managers. On top of this, most of our shades are broken or damaged, even the ones at the better location. I asked for popsicles to be supplied to the staff as done previous years and my response from my supervisor was ""you all leave a mess so no"". To reiterate, we don't have ac in 3/4 locations, there is no water provided, no popsicles (to help cool us off), and broken shades. I've gone head to head with upper management to try and fix this as we are understaffed, therefore, most of the staff works all day outside in this heat. I've always seen it as normal and quite annoying, especially if it's a big city facility we're operating. I recently got a second job as a barista on those drive through coffee shops and was quite shocked at how they handle staff being outside. We are forced to drink water before we're allowed to make ourselves drinks from our shop, forced to wear ice vests outside at all times, have a routine of when we drink our minimum 8oz of water, and have provided caps in place. It's such a switch up than what i'm used to and it made me start to think about how our lifeguards, being in the heat all day, are not even given complimentary waters from the city, nor fair working conditions. As a barista, we're outside maximum an hour as they make us switch to avoid overheating, and while lifeguards get their rotation breaks, having no ac is barely a break. Don't know if i'm over reacting here or if others share a similar experience, but just some thoughts. ",4,1754333429.0,Lifeguards,2,1.0,False

The Guardian Wolf
üëâ CONTINUE READING üëà
Chapter 1
Ever since the last mission ended, the entire Royal Warrior Team had grown increasingly hostile toward Sierra.

Even though she had successfully completed the mission‚Äîdisarming the silver bomb buried in the silver-explosion trap, Riley, a newly promoted omega warrior, was injured during the retreat.

Caden, her mate, the one she was supposed to seal the mate bond with next week, had rushed into the pack doctor‚Äôs operating room with bloodshot eyes, carrying Riley in his arms. Then, still burning with fury, he stormed up to Sierra and seized her arm like a madman.

He growled lowly. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you save Riley?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow could you just stand there and watch her get hurt?‚Äù

The accusation and urgency in his eyes struck Sierra like a blow to the head, leaving her reeling and numb.

He seemed to have forgotten that the mission this time was to dismantle the silver-explosion trap and rescue the pack members who‚Äôd been kidnapped by rogues.

And as warriors, the ability to save themselves was the most basic requirement.

The other members of the Royal Warrior Team stood on the sidelines, watching the drama unfold with obvious delight. Some even added fuel to the fire.

‚ÄúShe must‚Äôve been jealous that Riley got promoted. That‚Äôs why she deliberately didn‚Äôt save her. I didn‚Äôt expect her to be this petty and vindictive.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt take on missions with her anymore. She‚Äôs scary.‚Äù

One by one, their words piled on, each more cutting than the last, as if Sierra were the true cause of everything that went wrong.

And yet they conveniently forgot, it was because she had flawlessly completed the mission that any of them were still alive.

But now they stood together, pointing fingers at her?

At that thought, Sierra showed no anger or grievance. She simply brushed the dust off her uniform slowly and looked up, her voice calm and cold.

‚ÄúFine. From now on, you all can team up with Riley. I wish you the best of luck on your missions in advance.‚Äù

The moment those words left her lips, the room instantly fell silent.

None of them wanted to admit it, but the truth was clear: the entire Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team had only maintained its perfect mission record because of Sierra.

Caden finally realized he‚Äôd gone too far. He quickly softened his tone and tried to make amends.

‚ÄúSierra, I was just too worried.‚Äù

‚ÄúRiley‚Äôs still in the ER, and I was afraid she might not make it. You know she‚Äôs the youngest of all the warriors.‚Äù He added.

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

Sierra responded faintly, bitter amusement rising in her chest.

She and Riley were the same age. In fact, she‚Äôd joined the team earlier and undergone far harsher training. Yet in Caden‚Äôs eyes, Riley was always the delicate little girl who needed protection, while she, she was forever just ‚ÄúSierra.‚Äù

Ever since Riley joined the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team, Caden had gradually handed over all his privileges to her.

And yet, they had been together for seven years. Next week, they were supposed to seal their mate bond.

And now, they felt like strangers.

Sierra pressed her lips together, trying to stifle the bitterness rising inside. Pain shot through her injured arm, sharp and searing. As her gaze swept across the room, she realized that the entire Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team, including her mate, was completely unharmed.

Only she had been wounded.

And yet they were blaming her for not saving Riley.

If Riley was so important to them, why hadn‚Äôt they saved her?

The relentless pain drained all the color from her face, and her body began to tremble uncontrollably. She weakly pushed Caden aside and stumbled away to find the pack doctor on her own. She had no doubt that her arm was broken.

Behind her, there was only silence.

From the corner of her eye, she saw Caden still staring blankly in the direction of the ICU. Of course. Riley, his precious Riley, was still unconscious. Why would he notice her injuries?

Sierra turned her head back quietly. Her nose stung, and she had to force down the tears that threatened to fall.

She couldn‚Äôt afford for others to think that the team‚Äôs outstanding bomb disposal elite had broken down just because of a little pain. That would be humiliating.

With a rough swipe, she wiped the wetness from the corners of her eyes.

Then, Caden‚Äôs voice came from behind her again.

‚ÄúSierra, I‚Äôll go with you.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt know why, but instead of feeling surprised, a strange, tangled emotion rose in her chest, something she couldn‚Äôt even name.

Dr. Rivers, the pack doctor she frequently saw, looked visibly displeased as she examined her arm.

‚ÄúSierra, if you‚Äôd come any later, your arm would‚Äôve been a lost cause. Tell me, how do you plan to keep playing the hero after that?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlpha, your mate goes out on missions like she‚Äôs got a death wish. Can‚Äôt you rein her in a little?‚Äù

Dr. Rivers turned to Caden, face just as grim.

Remembering how harshly he‚Äôd just blamed her, Caden looked away in guilt and gave an awkward nod.

Sierra quickly responded with a grin and a few lighthearted words. Dr. Rivers might look fierce, but Sierra knew it all came from concern.

She remembered clearly the people who treated her well.

And just as clearly, she could tell when someone‚Äôs love toward her had faded.

Chapter 2
The nurses working at the hospital of pack doctors were busy, so Caden, as if trying to make up for something, volunteered to grab the medical kit and tend to Sierra‚Äôs injuries himself.

Sierra didn‚Äôt stop him. She simply gave a quiet nod.

Watching Caden up close again, she felt a strange sense of disorientation.

They had confirmed they were destined mates on the very day they awakened their wolves. After that, they answered the Alpha king's summons and joined the ‚ÄúRoyal Warrior Team‚Äù together, a covert pack under direct command of the Alpha king, tasked with the most dangerous missions in the werewolf world: disabling silver-explosion traps, hunting rogues and traitors.

They had once been admired by all, the perfect mates.

Sierra still remembered how, when her parents died in a car crash, it was Caden who held her through the night, comforting her. He helped arrange the funeral, handled every detail.

From the day they were mated to each other, Caden had brought her breakfast every morning without fail. It was always what she liked best. Even when the other warriors teased him for it, he never minded and kept doing it.

Every stormy night, he stayed by her side. He knew she feared thunder, because the night of the accident, the sky had been filled with lightning and crashing thunder.

She still remembered his vow at her parents' grave.

‚ÄúAs long as I live, I‚Äôll give her a warm home and love her for the rest of my life.‚Äù

And she had believed him, believed him with all her heart.

She just never expected that his so-called ‚Äúrest of my life‚Äù would only last seven years.

‚ÄúDoes it hurt?‚Äù Caden‚Äôs voice softened slightly.

‚Äú‚Ä¶It does not hurt as much as it did earlier.‚Äù

Her voice was calm, but cold.

Caden paused, then gave a small, awkward laugh before changing the subject.

‚ÄúYour hand‚Äôs in bad shape. You can‚Äôt drive like this. I‚Äôll take you home later and cook something nice for you.‚Äù

Sierra nodded. The corners of her lips curved ever so slightly in a cold, faint smile, and the smile never reached her eyes.

Just then, Caden‚Äôs phone began vibrating nonstop in his pocket. He set the cotton swab down and answered.

‚ÄúCaden, Riley‚Äôs awake. She won‚Äôt take her medicine, and the moment she opened her eyes she started crying for you‚Ä¶‚Äù

The voice on the other end belonged to one of the warriors, loud and clear enough that Sierra could hear every word, even if she didn‚Äôt want to hear it.

After hanging up, Caden glanced at Sierra, his tone apologetic.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll go check on her real quick. I‚Äôll be back soon, okay?‚Äù

Whatever faint smile had been on Sierra‚Äôs lips vanished, replaced by the same coldness as before.

She gave a brief response, and Caden turned to leave without hesitation or a second glance.

Sierra stared blankly at her half-treated wound for a while, then called over a nurse she knew. After that, she simply sat in silence, eyes unfocused, staring out the window.

She remembered a time when Caden had panicked over even the smallest scratch on her.

Every training session in the wild left her bruised and battered, and he‚Äôd carry her, equally bruised himself, straight to see the pack doctor. He wouldn‚Äôt even treat his own wounds until he was sure she was fine. He‚Äôd camp out by her bedside, bringing her water and food, refusing to leave no matter how much she told him to go.

But now?

The nurse who helped her now was gentle and quiet. When she finally finished treating the whole arm, she asked apologetically,

‚ÄúDid I hurt you?‚Äù

Sierra shook her head quickly. The nurse let out a relieved sigh, then added with concern,

‚ÄúI thought‚Ä¶ you were crying. Your face is covered in tears.‚Äù

I was crying?

Sierra reached up to wipe her face, and it was cold and damp.

She waited for a long time, but Caden never returned. After saying a brief goodbye to Dr. Rivers, she went home alone.

At ten that evening, Sierra was eating a plain sandwich when Caden‚Äôs message came through.

‚ÄúSierra, have you eaten?‚Äù

‚ÄúRiley‚Äôs still in pain and refuses to be alone. She begged me to stay with her tonight. You head home first, and I‚Äôll bring you breakfast tomorrow.‚Äù

Almost at the same time, a flood of pictures filled the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team‚Äôs group chat. They were images Riley had just shared.

Sierra checked them one by one. Each was a photo of food. They were bland, nourishing meals meant for someone recovering from injuries.

These dishes were used to be made just for her, but now, they were made for someone else.

Soon, the other warriors began chiming in with teasing comments.

‚ÄúAlpha Caden cooked again for Riley, exclusive meals for princess. No one else deserves that kind of treatment.‚Äù

‚ÄúYup, Caden‚Äôs definitely treating Riley different.‚Äù

As always, Riley loved playing coy. She played along with the teasing and even tagged Sierra with a mock-apologetic message.

‚ÄúSierra, I‚Äôm borrowing Caden for the night. I‚Äôll give him back to you tomorrow! Don‚Äôt be mad, okay?‚Äù

Seeing Sierra hadn‚Äôt responded, Caden was afraid that she might be put on the spot, so he quickly added in the group chat.

‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt be mad. Sierra‚Äôs always understanding.‚Äù

Sierra didn‚Äôt bother with the show they were putting on in the group chat.

She just stared at those photos of food, flipping through them again and again. Then she looked at her own half-eaten sandwich. Suddenly, she had no appetite.

After a long silence, she let out a sigh, raked her fingers through her hair in frustration, and finally, that burning ache in her chest exploded, tight and suffocating, like something clawing its way out.

She picked up her phone and tapped into her chat with Caden.

Chapter 3
‚ÄúWhy did you change?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you really like Riley that much?‚Äù

Sierra typed furiously, her fingers flying across the screen‚Äîonly to delete every word finally.

After a long pause, she washed up and quietly climbed into bed.

The next morning, as soon as Sierra arrived at the training grounds, she saw a bag of packed breakfast sitting on top of her locker. Beside it were three bright red roses.

She didn‚Äôt need to ask‚Äîit was definitely from Caden.

Her numb, frozen heart thawed just a little.

Sierra usually dressed like a tomboy‚Äîquick and practical‚Äîbut that was for the job. Inside, she was girly and sweet.

She liked romance. She loved fiery red roses.

The teammates around her all cast envious glances her way.

She sipped her coffee with a faint smile as she browsed through the day‚Äôs mission bulletin. Just then, a notification popped up on her phone.

She checked it and found it was a new post from Riley on social media.

In the photo, Riley stood smiling by the ward‚Äôs window, flashing a peace sign while hugging a massive bouquet of red roses. Next to her, a man‚Äôs hand was captured in the frame, holding a glass of milk up to her lips.

She even blatantly captioned it and it read,

‚ÄúThree wilted flowers can‚Äôt compare to one full bouquet. Your seven years mean less than my three months. Time to step aside.‚Äù

Sierra‚Äôs eyes locked onto the man‚Äôs hand in the picture.

Her coffee froze halfway to her lips.

There was a black mole on his wrist.

So, it was Caden who was feeding Riley the milk.

She turned her gaze toward the red roses beside her. Suddenly, it felt sarcastically blinding.

Without hesitation, she grabbed the roses and the breakfast he‚Äôd left, and threw them all straight into the trash.

Kendra passed by and blinked in surprise.

‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you eating?‚Äù

Sierra glanced at the garbage bin, her expression flat. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nauseating and I lost my appetite.‚Äù

Just then, Caden walked in.

The moment he saw Sierra, his expression lit up with warmth. There was a familiar fondness in his eyes as he asked, ‚ÄúHow did you sleep last night?‚Äù

Sierra looked up and gave him a calm glance.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she said, her voice emotionless.

Caden nodded and pulled a pair of polyester gloves from his pocket, handing them to her with familiar concern in his eyes.

‚ÄúI noticed your gloves were wearing out yesterday. I got you a new pair‚Äîthey‚Äôre your exact size. Try them on.‚Äù

As a bomb disposal elite, Sierra went through gloves faster than anyone on the team‚Äîabout one pair a week.

Some team members had even snidely remarked that she alone used up more gear than three others combined. But only Caden understood it was because she spent more time than anyone practicing bomb dismantling. Sierra, however, never bothered to explain.

The gloves fit perfectly. The texture was just right. And she knew instantly that they weren‚Äôt from standard team inventory. Caden had bought them himself.

‚ÄúYou spent money again?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs for you, it‚Äôs worth every penny.‚Äù he replied without hesitation.

It was a familiar exchange. Kendra turned and teased them both,

‚ÄúThe couple who‚Äôs about to seal their mate bond really is different. Just full of sweet nothings. I‚Äôm so jealous.‚Äù

Caden smiled bashfully. But Sierra didn‚Äôt feel any pleasure.

She couldn‚Äôt help but wonder would Riley post a picture of the same gloves soon? Another way to prove that whatever Sierra had, she had it too.

She stared at her phone, almost punishing herself with the anticipation, her face taut with suppressed tension. Caden, sensing something was off, nudged her gently.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? You look pale.‚Äù

Sierra let out a self-deprecating laugh and replied casually, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt sleep well. I‚Äôll turn in early tonight.‚Äù

Caden shot her a disapproving glance.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm on night duty. If you don‚Äôt go to bed early, I‚Äôll come knock on your door.‚Äù

Another round of teasing erupted from the team.

Everyone laughed and joked about how thoughtful Caden was. But in a quiet corner, Sierra let out a bitter laugh.

She didn‚Äôt understand. Caden had clearly fallen for someone else, so why did he still insist on playing the role of the perfect mate in front of her? What was the point?

As if needing confirmation, Sierra waited until the others headed to the training field. Then she stood before Riley‚Äôs locker, carefully going through it.

The next second, she pulled the door to the locker open. A whole shelf stacked neatly with gloves‚Äîidentical in material and color to the ones Caden had just given her.

And on the stitched seam of each glove, there were two letters:

‚ÄúRiley M.‚Äù

Sierra pulled out the gloves from her own pocket and turned them over.

The letters stared back at her.

In that instant, images rushed through her mind.

The night of the pack‚Äôs bonfire party, when the two of them had laughed and shared a single cup of fruit juice.

The thunderstorm when he held her close as they wept beside her parents‚Äô corpses.

The day they were accepted into the Royal Guard, when he had lifted her off the ground and spun her in circles in front of everyone.

In just a few minutes, those memories began to fade, inch by inch, as if devoured by flames‚Äîturning to ash, piece by piece.

‚ÄúCaden, I don‚Äôt want you anymore‚Ä¶‚Äù

Chapter 4
Sierra didn‚Äôt confront him. She trained on the field as usual, completing her daily assignments just like always.

But the next day, she wrote her name on the bomb disposal application form issued by the Alpha king for the North.

That afternoon, she was summoned to the wolf keep by the Alpha king.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre about to hold your mating ceremony with your mate, aren‚Äôt you? Why are you signing up as the foreign reinforcement? This mission lasts a minimum of three years, and it‚Äôs at Niraska in North.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are landmines every few steps. Almost every pack there has suffered injuries from them. It‚Äôs an extremely dangerous area.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure you want to do this? Think it over carefully before you decide and come back to tell me.‚Äù

Troy, the Alpha king, stared at his most outstanding elite warrior with mixed emotions. If Sierra left, there wouldn‚Äôt be anyone left in his pack even close to her caliber.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve thought it through, Alpha king. I‚Äôm willing to work as the reinforcement in the North,‚Äù Sierra replied firmly.

Troy sighed inwardly, but seeing how resolute she looked, he couldn‚Äôt press further. He stepped back.

‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll handle the paperwork. Just talk to Caden about it peacefully and don‚Äôt go fighting.‚Äù

Troy advised her sincerely.

Sierra gave a simple nod, then turned and left.

After exiting the wolf keep, she didn‚Äôt discuss anything with Caden. Instead, she went straight online and began researching Niraska.

For three straight days, she was either glued to her computer or training relentlessly on the field. Her abnormal behavior even made Kendra feel something was off.

‚ÄúDid you and Caden have a fight?‚Äù

Sierra shook her head.

Kendra stared at her suspiciously and muttered like she was uncovering a secret, ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs definitely off between you two‚Ä¶‚Äù

Before she could finish, a burst of cheers erupted from behind them.

It turned out Riley was being discharged from the hospital today, and Caden, along with a few warriors had specially filed a request to pick her up.

Riley looked radiant, and she walked with a spring in her step, chatting and laughing with the other warriors, clearly back to full health.

‚ÄúAll thanks to everyone‚Äôs care, I made it back in one piece,‚Äù she said sweetly. ‚ÄúTonight, dinner‚Äôs on me at The Silver Fork.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhoa! The Silver Fork!‚Äù

The warriors cheered, showering her with praise. That was the most upscale restaurant in all of Draymere. If not for Riley, they probably wouldn‚Äôt set foot in there for years.

With that thought, the way they looked at Riley grew even more eager with gratitude.

This wasn‚Äôt the first time Riley had treated the team. In fact, her status as the ‚Äúteam favorite‚Äù had a lot to do with her wealth and generosity.

She had won everyone over with money faster than anything else could.

‚ÄúSierra, you have to come tonight. You‚Äôve missed every team gathering before, and Caden‚Äôs always looked so disappointed,‚Äù

The moment Riley said with a bright smile, everyone turned to stare at Sierra instantly. Even Caden stepped closer and tugged gently at her sleeve, clearly hoping she‚Äôd agree quickly.

Someone muttered under their breath, ‚ÄúWhat does Sierra have that makes her worthy of Alpha Caden? Honestly, Riley and he are a perfect match, a couple made in heaven.‚Äù

Though the voice was soft, it was just loud enough for everyone nearby to hear.

The hush that fell over the group was deafening. Riley stood in the middle of it all, her eyes glinting subtly as her smile deepened.

Caden, standing next to her, acted as if he hadn‚Äôt heard a thing, exchanging subtle glances with Riley, full of unspoken affection.

In that moment, Sierra felt drained.

Being involved in a love triangle was even more draining than three days and nights of nonstop training.

With that thought, Sierra nodded, ‚ÄúAlright. Thanks for the treat. You‚Äôre way too generous.‚Äù

At 6 p.m., a group of them headed out in a grand convoy to The Silver Fork. As they passed by the Alpha king‚Äôs office near the training field, Troy called out to Sierra.

‚ÄúThe paperwork‚Äôs done. Come sign it tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúGot it.‚Äù

Caden jogged up from behind, puzzled. ‚ÄúWhat are you going to sign?‚Äù

Sierra looked him straight in the eyes. After a pause, she replied, ‚ÄúJust the signature for the last mission's merit awards.‚Äù

Caden narrowed his eyes slightly but didn‚Äôt ask further. The two of them caught up with the others and got in the car.

Riley, showing off her wealth and generosity, had rented out the entire main hall of The Silver Fork and ordered every signature dish on the menu.

Once the dinner began, she raised her glass and turned to Sierra.

‚ÄúSierra, you‚Äôre one of the elite in our team. This toast is for you. We‚Äôll be relying on you a lot in the future.‚Äù

Sierra kept her head down and said nothing. Riley, still smiling, waited patiently with the glass in her hand.

The rowdy chatter at the table gradually died down. Kendra who was sitting nearby quickly stood up to smooth things over. ‚ÄúSierra doesn‚Äôt drink. How about I drink this one for her?‚Äù

Someone scoffed. ‚ÄúAnd who are you to drink for her?‚Äù

Kendra forced an awkward smile and slowly lowered her glass.

Caden had just returned from taking a call. Seeing the situation, he looked conflicted. After hesitating a moment, he leaned toward Sierra and whispered, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so many people here. Maybe you just take a small sip?‚Äù

Sierra, who had remained unresponsive until now, suddenly moved. She slowly turned her head, her blue eyes locking onto Caden‚Äôs. Then she asked to confirm again, ‚ÄúWhat did you just say?‚Äù

Chapter 5
Guilt flickered across Caden‚Äôs face. He paused for a moment but ultimately didn‚Äôt dare say another word, falling silent with a sheepish expression.

No one knew that Sierra‚Äôs parents had been killed on a stormy night by a drunk truck driver.

Their bodies had been mangled beyond recognition, blood staining the entire road.

Ever since then, she had despised alcohol and was terrified of thunder and rain.

But Caden knew it all. He had been the one to hold her tightly in his arms as she trembled, whispering again and again, ""Don‚Äôt be afraid, Sierra. You still have me.""

But now, what was he doing?

He was persuading her to drink for the other she-wolf?

At that moment, Sierra felt something deep inside her collapse with a crash.

She began to tremble uncontrollably. She glanced at the silent Caden, then cast a brief look across the table at Riley.

She took a deep breath, lifted the glass of whiskey, and downed it in one go.

The room, which had gone silent moments before, suddenly erupted in cheers. The teammates whooped and clapped, cheering her on.

But Sierra's face turned pale. It was bloodless.

Only her eyes burned with a fire that seemed to be smoldering from within. Under close observation, there was a faint, unmistakable trace of determination.

The alcohol scorched her stomach like acid, twisting her insides until she could barely breathe. She stumbled to her feet and ran to the bathroom, collapsing beside the toilet and vomiting violently.

Over and over, she vomited until tears blurred her vision.

At that moment, she couldn‚Äôt tell which pain was worse‚Äîher burning stomach or her broken heart.

No one followed her. She knew Caden was still in the hall, standing in front of Riley, smiling as he shielded her from drinks.

Just like he used to do it for her countless times.

Only this time, he had simply shielded someone else from drinks, not her.

Sierra didn‚Äôt know how long she stayed there. When she finally came back to herself, she stood up and walked out.

Maybe even the Moon Goddess was grieving her broken love. The clear sky darkened without warning, and rain began to pour down in sheets.

As the heavy rain poured down, a streak of lightning abruptly flashed across the sky, followed by a deafening thunderclap that struck straight through her chest like an icy spear, pinning her to the spot, unable to move.

Visions of her parents‚Äô mangled bodies and the pool of blood surged back like a tide.

Her body trembled violently. With shaking fingers, she unlocked her phone and dialed Caden‚Äôs number. But a woman answered instead.

‚ÄúSierra? Did you need something?‚Äù

‚ÄúCaden went to the reception to get condoms... He said being tipsy makes things even more exciting...‚Äù

The words ""Caden, I‚Äôm scared"" caught in Sierra‚Äôs throat, choking her. She swallowed them back down with everything she had.

Without listening further, she hung up. Then, dragging her unsteady feet, she stepped into the night and disappeared into the rain.

By the time Sierra made it home, she was soaked to the bone like a drowned stray.

She curled up in the bathtub, staring blankly ahead. The memory of Caden urging her to drink replayed in her mind, making her sob even harder.

After sitting there for a long while, she finally stood up, dried off, got dressed, and powered off her phone.

Then she crawled under the blankets, wrapping herself tightly in the comforter like a lifeless cocoon.

The next morning, Sierra returned to the training ground with a calm expression, though her face was alarmingly pale.

Kendra noticed and asked with concern. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look good at all. Are you feeling sick?‚Äù

Sierra gave a bitter smile and shook her head. The drink she had downed in a fit of pique the night before had triggered her chronic stomach problem, and her stomach churned with relentless pain.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. I‚Äôll just go see the pack doctor and get something for it.‚Äù

She waved weakly, stood up, and headed toward the door, only to bump into Caden and Riley coming in together from outside.

Caden frowned slightly, and his tone carried a mix of concern and reproach,

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you answer my calls last night?‚Äù

‚ÄúI dropped Riley off at her room, then couldn‚Äôt find you anywhere. Are you still mad at me?‚Äù

He sounded patient and gentle, but Sierra knew him well. He was actually angry.

She gave a small shake of her head. ‚ÄúI went home on my own last night.‚Äù

As she tried to brush past them, another wave of pain twisted in her gut, cold sweat breaking out on her palms and forehead.

But Caden acted like he didn‚Äôt notice. He turned to Riley and said with a soft chuckle, ‚ÄúSee? I told you Sierra wouldn‚Äôt mind. You‚Äôre just worrying for nothing.‚Äù

That familiar tone of indulgence made Sierra‚Äôs heart skip a beat.

She bit down hard on her lip and was about to step outside when something furry on the floor startled her.

She instinctively took a few steps back‚Äîthen realized it was a cat.

Seeing Sierra visibly startled, Riley quickly scooped up the cat, speaking in a syrupy voice,

‚ÄúSierra, it was my fault last night. I shouldn't have pushed you to drink. Caden said you like pets, so I brought my cat to say sorry. Do you want to hold her?‚Äù

But Sierra flinched again, retreating farther.

Other people might not know, but Caden did. He knew she was allergic to cat fur.

And the pets she liked were dogs, not cats.

Sierra‚Äôs face was pale as she clutched her stomach with one hand and shook her head, forcing a smile as she replied,

‚ÄúThanks, but I‚Äôm allergic to cat fur. I‚Äôll pass.‚Äù

The moment the words left her mouth, Riley‚Äôs face darkened.

After a brief pause, her lips pouted slightly as she muttered,

‚ÄúSo you really don‚Äôt like me, Sierra. You refused the drink I offered, now you won‚Äôt even hold my cat...‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you hate me, Sierra, you could just say it outright. No need to come up with so many excuses.‚Äù

Chapter 6
She spoke with a quiver in her voice but glanced sideways at Caden, her eyes red and filled with grievance.

Sure enough, the next second, Caden‚Äôs coaxing voice sounded beside her,

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just hold the cat? Riley‚Äôs only trying to make it up to you.‚Äù

Around them, teammates chimed in with sarcastic tones, ‚ÄúOh, an elite is different from us, acting all high and mighty, breaking team unity. Riley‚Äôs begging you, so why put on airs...‚Äù

Sierra‚Äôs brow furrowed tightly, her knuckles whitening as she clenched her fists.

At that moment, Kendra pushed through the crowd, quickly supporting the pale Sierra and snapped sharply, ‚ÄúHold a cat? Have you seen how badly her stomach hurts?‚Äù

The moment she finished her words, she started pulling Sierra toward the exit.

Seeing this, Caden hurried after them, asking anxiously, ‚ÄúSierra, why didn‚Äôt you tell me your stomach hurt?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you so stubborn? When are you ever going to work on that temper of yours?‚Äù

Sierra wanted to say something but when she looked up, she caught the faint trace of reproach in his eyes and stayed silent.

But Riley spoke up from behind, ‚ÄúCaden, the kitten even waits for you to feed it. It eats for you‚Ä¶‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt finish the sentence, yet somehow it felt complete.

Sierra forced out, ‚ÄúCaden, you should go. Riley‚Äôs kitten is waiting for you.‚Äù

A look of reluctance crossed Caden‚Äôs face. He glanced at Riley, then at Sierra, and explained, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be quick. Wait for me.‚Äù

With that, he turned and ran toward Riley.

Only then did Sierra fully understand: in Caden‚Äôs heart, she couldn‚Äôt compare to Riley ‚Äî not even to Riley‚Äôs cat.

Perhaps she alone had foolishly held onto those years of love.

She sighed softly and turned to Kendra, gently saying, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù.


Perhaps sensing Sierra‚Äôs sadness, the usually talkative Kendra fell into a rare silence.

After the pack doctor examined Sierra‚Äôs arm and prescribed some painkillers, she finally smiled and spoke, ‚ÄúYour arm‚Äôs wound is almost scabbed over, nothing serious.‚Äù

‚ÄúI heard you performed excellently on the last mission ‚Äî congratulations!‚Äù the pack doctor said cheerfully.

Sierra nodded to express her gratitude and chatted a little more before they left the clinic.

Kendra‚Äôs face was lit up with excitement as she rambled, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only outstanding warrior left on our team now. You‚Äôre so impressive!‚Äù

‚ÄúCaden must be jumping for joy!‚Äù

‚ÄúA mating ceremony and being named an outstanding warrior, I guess that‚Äôs what they call a double blessing.‚Äù

Kendra spoke with bright eyes and a lively expression, her face glowed with genuine happiness, but Sierra‚Äôs expression remained unchanged, too calm to be real.

Sierra actually never cared much about titles. Every mission was a gamble with death.

One more day stolen from fate meant one more day alive.

Completing the mission and returning alive‚Äîthat was her greatest wish.

Thinking this, Sierra looked up at the bright blue sky and smiled faintly, then turned to thank Kendra.

When the two returned to training field with the medicine, Caden approached with concern, handing her a heat pack.

‚ÄúPut this on your stomach; it‚Äôll help you feel better.‚Äù

Sierra‚Äôs gaze fixed on the heat pack but she didn‚Äôt move.

She didn‚Äôt understand. She really didn‚Äôt understand what Caden was thinking‚Äîhow he could have fallen out of love with her and fallen for Riley but still pretend to care deeply for her.

As a two-timer, didn‚Äôt that wear him out?

She had no time to ask him about this question because the very next second, the training bell rang, summoning everyone to a meeting.

Quietly, she pushed the heat pack back to Caden and followed the others to the hall of the wolf keep.

Soon, Alpha king Troy strode in, his voice ringing strong and clear,

‚ÄúSierra performed outstandingly on the last mission. By royal decree, she is awarded the ‚ÄòExcellent Warrior‚Äô medal in recognition!‚Äù

Just as applause was about to break out, a sharp voice interrupted‚Äî

‚ÄúI object!‚Äù

All heads turned sharply, eyes locking on Caden, who had spoken.

Alpha king Troy raised a brow slightly, expressionless, silently inviting him to continue.

Caden avoided Sierra‚Äôs gaze and fixed his eyes on Riley in the front row. His tone was cold,

‚ÄúRiley was seriously injured on this mission and should be recognized as well. The honor cannot belong to Sierra alone; otherwise, the teammates won‚Äôt accept it.‚Äù",1,1754333405.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
1mhm49n,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeardAndTested/comments/1mhm49n/should_you_try_the_best_coffee_maker_ninja_cfp201/,Should You Try the Best Coffee Maker Ninja CFP201 for Pods and Grounds?,"I‚Äôve had my fair share of coffee makers over the years, but testing the Ninja CFP201 DualBrew System has been quite the experience. This machine has an interesting dual system that works seamlessly with both coffee grounds and K-Cups, and it offers three brew styles: Classic, Rich, and Over Ice. Being someone who thrives on caffeine and variety, having multiple options in one machine definitely caught my attention. If you're like me and appreciate a little flexibility in your brewing methods, this coffee maker might pique your interest too. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, the sleek black design of this coffee maker is understated yet modern. It‚Äôs not overly bulky, but it does have its weight at about 9 pounds, which makes it feel solid and durable. The product dimensions (11.18""D x 9.09""W x 15.4""H) made it suitable to place on my somewhat crowded kitchen counter without much rearranging. I also noticed the thoughtful addition of the removable 60-oz. water reservoir, which has a sturdy handle for easy refilling‚Äîsomething I didn‚Äôt realize I needed until I started using it. The buttons on the machine are clearly labeled and intuitive to use, and the black paint finish complements the design without appearing prone to fingerprints.

**Brewing Performance**  
Brewing with this machine is perhaps where it truly shines. I tested it using both coffee grounds and K-Cups, and the result was consistently flavorful. The option to choose from 9 brew sizes for grounds or 4 sizes for K-Cups really caters to a variety of preferences. Whether I wanted a single small cup or a full 12-cup carafe for when family visited, it delivered. And the Over Ice feature produces iced coffee without the dreaded ""watery"" taste I‚Äôve encountered with other machines. Honestly, the Rich brew mode has become my favorite for hot coffee‚Äîit brings out robust flavors that rival what I‚Äôve ordered at cafes.  

[Check Ninja CFP201 price on Amazon.](https://cookarte.com/p/b08qzxfskp/)  

**Features and Functionality**  
The machine comes with some handy features that make it stand out. There‚Äôs an adjustable warming plate that keeps coffee warm for up to four hours, which is a game-changer on lazy weekends when I sip my coffee throughout the morning. The Delay Brew function allowed me to set the coffee maker to start brewing at a specific time‚Äîideal for when I wanted to wake up to the smell of fresh coffee (or, let‚Äôs be real, when I forgot to prep it before crashing into bed). Included accessories like the Ninja Smart Scoop and K-Cup Pod Adapter make it a complete package, so nothing else is needed to get started right away. 

**Positives**  
- Dual system accommodates both coffee grounds and K-Cups.  
- Nine brew size options for grounds and four for pods offer great flexibility.  
- Brew styles like Classic, Rich, and Over Ice ensure personalized results.  
- Removable 60-oz. reservoir is easy to fill and clean.  
- Delay Brew and Keep Warm Functions are exceptionally convenient.  

**Bad Points**  
- The lack of a reusable K-Cup filter surprised me, as many machines in this range often include one.  
- The machine takes up vertical space, which might be a challenge for low cabinets.  
- Some parts, like the carafe lid, feel slightly more plastic-like compared to the rest of the sturdily built machine.  

**Competing Products**  
When compared to the Keurig K-Elite or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the Ninja CFP201 comes off as the more versatile option, particularly because of its ability to brew both grounds and pods while offering various size settings. The Keurig K-Elite may include a strong brew option, but it doesn‚Äôt cater much to ground coffee lovers. Meanwhile, the FlexBrew from Hamilton Beach offers similar dual functionality, but the flavor optimization in the Ninja CFP201‚Äôs brew modes gives it the upper hand for taste enthusiasts like myself.

**Affordable Quality**  
Considering all the features packed into this coffee maker, it balances well between functionality and cost efficiency. There are pricier options out there that don‚Äôt even offer half the versatility this machine does. While it might be slightly higher in cost compared to basic drip coffee machines, paying a little extra seems justifiable to get these added conveniences‚Äîand yes, waking up to iced coffee on a summer morning feels luxurious. Whether you're a daily coffee drinker or someone who enjoys hosting brunches with multiple options ready, the value here is notable.

I was about to meet up with my friends. I‚Äôd had enough sleep the night before, a coffee before heading out, and felt fresh on the bike. The last thing I remember is looking straight ahead at the road. Everything felt normal. And then‚Ä¶ nothing. I was going around 30km/hr

I woke up on the ground surrounded by strangers and police officers. It felt like waking up from a dream. I couldn‚Äôt move or lift myself up. They eventually put me in a police van and rushed me to the hospital. I spent weeks there, went through cosmetic surgeries, and started a recovery process I wouldn‚Äôt wish on anyone.

The weird part is how little sense the crash makes. My bike was mostly intact- no flat tires, no frame or wheel damage. The only thing broken was my carbon handlebar, which had snapped clean in two. My helmet had taken a big hit and was cracked. My sunglasses were destroyed. My right shoe had come off or rather, the sole had ripped from the shoe and stayed clipped into the pedal. I was wearing gloves on both hands, and an Apple Watch on my left wrist. My fingers were severely lacerated, I still have nerve damage on the left hand but the Apple Watch didn‚Äôt even have a scratch.

Even stranger, my clothes weren‚Äôt torn. No road rash on my body. A big laceration on my left knee was the only lower half damage. Just massive impact injuries I had over fifteen fractures: ribs, vertebrae, multiple fingers, and my left hand. I couldn‚Äôt walk properly for over a month.

What‚Äôs haunted me since then is the fact that I don‚Äôt remember anything about the crash itself. I wasn‚Äôt sleepy or out of it, and the road was straight and clear. There was no traffic chaos, no sudden pothole that I recall. It‚Äôs like the moment itself got erased.

I‚Äôve attached an image of my Strava ride  and a photo of the highway where it happened. I‚Äôd really appreciate if anyone has insights or theories.",102,1754333155.0,bicycling,138,0.95,False

I‚Äôm a young man in my twenties. Not long ago, I went through a shocking and unexpected experience:
I had two cups of coffee and an energy drink, and suddenly my heart rate spiked to 145 bpm. I felt shortness of breath, dizziness, a choking sensation, and an intense fear of dying.
I was rushed to the ER. They did an ECG and blood tests and told me everything was physically fine.

But since then, I haven‚Äôt felt like myself.
I no longer experience full-blown panic attacks like on the first day, but now I live with constant pressure in my chest, emotional numbness, and fatigue.
I feel stuck in the ‚Äúpost-crisis‚Äù phase ‚Äî afraid of having another episode, feeling lost, and disconnected from myself.

Right now, I feel really lost. My daily routine feels empty and boring. I finished my studies this year, but I‚Äôm still confused and don‚Äôt know what to do next. On top of that, I feel pressure from my family. They look at me differently because I chose a different study path than my siblings, and I feel like I disappointed them.

I don‚Äôt know if all of this built up inside me, but the panic attack I had felt like the last drop that made the glass overflow. The trigger was coffee and an energy drink, but I think I was already mentally tired and stressed.

I‚Äôve seen several doctors, and they all told me I‚Äôm physically healthy‚Ä¶ but inside, I feel like I‚Äôm just existing in a body without truly living.
I‚Äôm trying to stay strong, but I‚Äôm tired.
I just want to feel normal again. I want to wake up one day and not have to fight this invisible battle.

1mhlv62,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1mhlv62/reveal_the_oxo_rapid_brewer_review_is_this_the/,Reveal the OXO Rapid Brewer Review: Is This the Best Portable Coffee Maker?,"The OXO Brew Rapid Brewer, model 8722500, has been my go-to coffee gadget for the past few weeks, and I have to say, it‚Äôs as unique as it sounds. I‚Äôm someone who thrives on caffeine, but long cafe lines and overpriced cold brews are not my idea of convenience. That‚Äôs when this nifty coffee maker caught my attention, claiming to whip up concentrated coffee in mere minutes. Of course, I had to give it a try to see if it lived up to the hype‚Äîor fell flat like a soggy coffee filter.

**Ease of Use and Compact Design**  
What stood out immediately was how lightweight and portable this product is. At just over 1 pound and roughly the size of a water bottle, it‚Äôs an easy fit in my bag. Whether I was at the office, lounging on my balcony, or even crashing at a friend‚Äôs place, the brewer tagged along without fuss. No plugs, no charging cables, no awkward bulk. The manual operation offers a certain charm‚Äîjust add your finely ground coffee, tamp it down, pour in water, and let it brew. It‚Äôs oddly satisfying, almost like a ritual when you‚Äôre waiting for your morning fix.  

[Check OXO Brew Rapid Brewer 8722500 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b0dc8jyjqx/)

**Hot or Cold Brew in Minutes**  
The brewing times here are quick and effective, especially for days when patience is non-existent. I managed hot concentrated coffee in just two minutes, while cold brew took five minutes‚Äîit‚Äôs almost instant gratification. I like how adjustable the process is too. Changing the grind size, water-to-brew ratio, or even brew time allowed me to play around until I hit the just-right flavor note. For someone like me who likes experimenting with coffee, this feature is a definitive bonus.  

**Consistency and Taste Quality**  
The included rainmaker showerhead design really intrigued me before even trying the product. It‚Äôs designed to evenly distribute water over the coffee grounds for optimal flavor extraction, and I must admit, I noticed a difference. The resulting coffee was robust with no unsightly traces of under-extraction that you might find with subpar machines. It feels like this brewer genuinely respects the coffee grounds (as poetic as that sounds), extracting the rich flavors beautifully.  

**Built-In Stainless Steel Filter**  
One of its most underrated features, in my opinion, is the inbuilt stainless steel filter. I despise disposable paper filters‚Äîthey‚Äôre messy, wasteful, and half the time I end up running out of them mid-brew. This stainless filter solved that problem in one go. It‚Äôs a no-brainer for both lazy folks who hate extra clutter (like me) and environmentally conscious users alike. Cleaning was a breeze too; just rinse and go.  

**Versatility and Customization Options**  
I quickly learned how versatile this brewer is after a few days. I‚Äôve tried everything from Americanos to cold brews to daring affogatos. The ability to craft concentrated coffee and dilute it according to your preferences offered a level of customizability that‚Äôs hard to match. The tamper included in the kit adds another touch of professionalism since it ensures an even coffee bed, leading to consistent outcomes for every brew.  

**Pluses**  
- Lightweight and portable design  
- Quick brewing times: 2 minutes for hot, 5 minutes for cold  
- Stainless steel filter eliminates the need for paper filters  
- Rainmaker showerhead ensures maximum flavor extraction  
- Highly customizable for various coffee styles  

**Caveats**  
- The learning curve for beginners can be slightly steep; a proper grind size is crucial here to avoid clogging the filter.  
- Manual pumping feels repetitive after a while if you‚Äôre making multiple servings back-to-back. (Your arm might feel like you just completed a mini workout!)  
- Since it relies heavily on water temperature, ensuring you have the correct heat for hot coffee might need some fiddling if you‚Äôre on the go.  

**Competitive Options**  
While the OXO Brew Rapid Brewer excels in portability and versatility, there are alternatives worth mentioning. French presses like the Bodum Chambord offer a more traditional brewing experience and can also handle cold brew with some tinkering, albeit without the speed. The Aeropress is another rival that shines when portability is key. It‚Äôs smaller and perhaps more versatile in brewing styles but lacks the polish of OXO's rainmaker showerhead design for even extraction. If you‚Äôre into tech and don‚Äôt mind spending extra, compact electric brewers like the Keurig K-Mini come into play. However, most of these options don‚Äôt offer the level of manual customization or portable brewing strength that the Rapid Brewer does.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Despite its premium feel, I found this brewer to be priced reasonably within its segment. It saves money in the long run, especially when I stopped splurging on those daily lattes. Its build quality feels solid and long-lasting, and since it requires no additional filters or electricity, the ongoing costs are virtually zero. For anyone looking to invest in a practical, travel-friendly coffee maker, this could easily be worth every penny (but be prepared for that manual workout!).

The Galactic Trade Event was the largest market in known space.
Every cycle, fleets arrived from every corner of the Orion Arm and beyond‚Äîcargo holds packed with weapons, medical breakthroughs, stealth modules, artificial gravity cores, nanite farms, mercenary contracts, and occasionally, slaves disguised as ‚Äúloyal retinue.‚Äù

Deals were forged in half-lit rooms that smelled of ozone and formaldehyde. Fortunes changed hands over encrypted pads. Civilizations rose or fell based on the transactions made here.

So when the humans arrived and rented four full exhibition bays‚Ä¶ everyone assumed they had something big.

Their stalls were crowded, sure‚Äîlines of curious onlookers and passersby.
But none of the usual buzz surrounded them.
There were no weapon crates. No energy readings. No stealth-ship blueprints.

They brought‚Ä¶ food.

‚∏ª

The other delegates didn‚Äôt know what to make of it.

From the outside, the human zone looked like a cross between a live laboratory and a street fair. Colored banners hung from wires. Chalk signs written in inconsistent Galactic Common offered things like:

‚ÄúCHURROS ‚Äì TASTE THE CRUNCH‚Äù
‚ÄúCOFFEE ‚Äì LIQUID AMBITION‚Äù
‚ÄúBARBECUE RIBS ‚Äì CARNIVORE‚ÄôS DELIGHT‚Äù
‚ÄúFREE SAMPLES ‚Äì SURVIVAL NOT GUARANTEED (JUST KIDDING, PROBABLY)‚Äù

At first, the only ones who ventured inside were thrill-seekers and junior aides sent on dares.

The Ka‚Äôtari ambassador sniffed a thing called cinnamon roll, sneezed, and fled.
A Varn technosavant poked a marshmallow with a scanning wand and declared it ‚Äúnutritionally inefficient.‚Äù
An Orel diplomat licked something called hot sauce and had to be medically evacuated.
All of it just reinforced the common belief: humans were insane.

And yet‚Ä¶ the line kept growing.

‚∏ª

Three cycles in, something strange happened.
People started coming back.

A Tevari mining guildmistress quietly requested an entire tray of ‚Äúdouble-shot espressos.‚Äù
A Glith envoy, whose species lacked traditional taste receptors, signed a bulk contract for ‚Äúsmoked brisket‚Äù just for the aroma.
The Xurn, a silicon-based species who metabolized heat, became addicted to jalape√±o poppers.
It was not logical. It was not necessary.

But it was powerful.

‚∏ª

You see, most galactic species viewed food as fuel. Nothing more.
Paste. Pills. Synth-squares. Energy cubes.
Efficiency over pleasure.
Enough to survive the day, no more.

But humans?
Humans had elevated eating into art‚Äîa ritual, a history, a language of its own.

Their dishes were not designed to nourish.
They were designed to evoke.

One alien researcher noted that humans consumed substances that triggered pain just for pleasure‚Äîcapsaicin, caffeine, alcohol.
Others spent hours preparing fermented sauces, baking layered pastries, slow-smoking meats for no reason other than ‚Äúflavor.‚Äù

And it worked.

Because suddenly, ambassadors didn‚Äôt want to meet in cold council chambers anymore.
They wanted to meet at the human tea bar.

‚∏ª

A week into the event, the humans struck.

Quietly. Cleverly. Deliciously.

Deals were made. Not with power, but with pies.

They began trading food licenses‚Äîcompact bio-printers calibrated for specific dishes, each encoded with human culinary secrets.
A single donut replicator was exchanged for an entire freighter of superconductive alloys.
An empire‚Äôs exclusive access to ‚Äúchocolate‚Äù cost them four minor moons in the Drelka Expanse.

Humans didn‚Äôt just participate in the market.
They rewrote it.

Not with weapons. Not with medicine.
But with experience.

‚∏ª

And the most terrifying part?

They weren‚Äôt even showing everything.

Rumors spread of ‚ÄúLevel 5 Cuisine‚Äù‚Äîdishes too powerful to be publicly demonstrated.
One was allegedly called Thanksgiving Dinner, requiring over six simultaneous side dishes, emotional tension between participants, and something called ‚Äúgravy.‚Äù

Another was known only as Lasagna.
It was layered. It was molten.
It caused a Ch‚Äôtelk warlord to sit quietly for eleven minutes and reconsider his past choices.

No one could confirm any of it.
But everyone remembered the warning printed at the entrance to the human zone:

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt trade weapons. We trade the reason to live long enough not to need them.‚Äù

She met a man from Varanasi, now living in Mumbai for work, on Tinder in 2018. They‚Äôve been in contact since, but he‚Äôs reluctant to commit or be romantic, won‚Äôt introduce her to his friends/family, and avoids meeting hers. They‚Äôre now back in close contact, and she‚Äôs happy but desperate for a relationship. I‚Äôm concerned about his intentions and the lack of social integration. Is this safe? What do you think about this guy?

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm posting on behalf of my close childhood friend (44F), who‚Äôs unmarried and still looking for the right partner. We grew up together, but she lives in Mumbai while I‚Äôm in Nagpur, so we mostly connect over phone calls. She‚Äôs been feeling deeply lonely, and her desperation to find a partner is really affecting her. She‚Äôs been actively searching for over a decade, and despite being educated, socially engaging, and having a good circle of friends, she‚Äôs struggled to find someone. She‚Äôs a big-boned woman (around 90kg), which she feels might be a factor, though I don‚Äôt see it as an issue. She‚Äôs attractive, open-minded, and from a conservative Jain family but is very progressive herself.

Here‚Äôs the situation: In 2018, out of desperation, she joined Tinder hoping to meet someone genuine. She connected with a man from Varanasi, who now lives in Mumbai for work. They hit it off, meeting for coffee, talking on the phone, and seemed to get along well. She was ready to move forward, but he said he needed to wait until his sister got married before taking things further. She respected his choice, but he also avoided any romantic involvement. Once, she visited him in Varanasi, staying in a hotel where he visited her. They got close to being intimate, but he backed out at the last moment, saying he couldn‚Äôt go through with it. She describes him as a respectful gentleman who cares for her deeply, and she enjoys his company.

The problem is, he hasn‚Äôt taken any steps toward a serious relationship, even though she‚Äôs been clear about wanting to move forward. More concerning, he refuses to introduce her to his friends or family and shows no interest in meeting hers. This raises a huge red flag for me. They‚Äôve been meeting regularly in Mumbai, where he now resides, but the Varanasi trip was her attempt to get closer to him in his hometown, hoping to meet his circle or deepen their connection. That didn‚Äôt happen.

Their contact continued for a few years until she stopped communication, feeling it wasn‚Äôt going anywhere. But she‚Äôs struggled to find other partners and recently reconnected with him. They‚Äôre now in close contact again, and she seems happy, which is important. Still, I‚Äôm worried. She‚Äôs so invested that she‚Äôs even ready to be intimate with him, but he continues to hold back, and there‚Äôs still no interaction with anyone else in their lives‚Äîno friends, no family. This secrecy and lack of progress make me question his intentions.

I‚Äôm torn. I want to trust her happiness, but the red flags are hard to ignore. What do you think about this guy? Is this situation safe for my friend? Should I be concerned about his reluctance to commit or integrate her into his life? Any advice or similar experiences would help. Thanks!",1,1754332589.0,RelationshipIndia,2,0.67,False

For context, my partner and I were separated for the month of April. I met someone off of Hinge to which I did explain that I didn‚Äôt want to be romantically involved with anyone considering I am freshly out of a relationship.  Our relationship dynamic was more friendly than it was romantic. My relationship with this person ended as soon as my partner and I got back together 

This past Thursday, the person I met off hinge came into my friend‚Äôs coffee bar that I was also at. My friend and the person from hinge have been speaking a lot more frequently. I sat down and talked to the person from hinge, and encouraged the idea that they should take my friend out somewhere. First mistake, I didn‚Äôt tell my partner about this 

Fast forward to today, the person from hinge reached out to my partner. They told my partner about how we met up on Thursday. They also explained to my partner that we hung out several times and ""slept in my bed."" Now my partner has asked me multiple times if I had hung out with anyone during our separation, I said no. I was afraid of their reaction, so I lied. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it since I blocked and removed everyone from my social platforms. The person from hinge told my partner that there was a romantic interest, or at least they felt, between us. I told my partner that I feel like I come off as too friendly and flirtatious, AND they never slept in my bed. My partner does not believe me and explained ""why would they reach out to me and be malicious?""

This is a mess of words, but this just happened all in the span of one hour. I am not sure what to do, I came clean about me and the person off Hinge. I feel so terrible about lying, my partner said that a liar is who I am and will be for awhile. Honestly, it felt like lying was better to do than tell the truth. I didn‚Äôt want to make my partner mad or sad, as I‚Äôve already caused so much pain. I see how I have caused even more pain. They are on their way to their parents house and they do not want to sleep at my house anymore. I have no idea what to do, I have expressed that I will be there for them and I understand why they‚Äôre upset. ",1,1754332087.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,7,0.67,False

Being single and staying alone definitely comes with its set of pros and cons. A major con is to find like minded people to hang out with.

Gated communities while are good, I have not been able to befriend neighbours or community peeps. I have accepted the fact that it's majorly me, ofcourse I can't do small talks, ofcourse I can't make an eye contact or pass on a smile in shyness. How on earth will anyone even want to speak to me. People who know me would be surprised that me a supposed extrovert to them am actually not able to make new friends. And yes I need new people around me, the right kinda. Who is my right kind you ask - people who are doing well for themselves, who are driven and passionate about some thing(s), some effable nerdiness and need to know curiosity, can crack a good joke and take one if made, and make some highest form of sarcastic comment and wit.. if not this then it's a predictable pathway of how life is just a mesh of daily drudgery.

She Wore My Husband‚Äôs Tie at 3AM‚Ä¶ The Group Chat Exposed Everything!
üëâ CONTINUE READING üëà
Chapter 1
Late night, the girl upstairs dropped a provocative pic on the building‚Äôs group chat.

She posed in lace lingerie, wrists bound with a navy-blue tie, seductive and theatrical.

I nearly clicked out. I didn‚Äôt want to look.

But something stopped me cold.

The tie.

It wasn‚Äôt just any tie.

It was his tie‚Äîthe exact Herm√®s one I‚Äôd knotted around my husband‚Äôs neck that same morning.

----

The photo disappeared shortly after.

At three in the morning, I lay sleepless.

Thunder roared outside, rain hammering the windows relentlessly. As the storm raged, faint moans drifted through the ceiling‚Äîfeminine, breathy, laced with pain and pleasure.

My heart thudded in my chest.

I opened my pinned chat with Brandon.

Two hours earlier, he‚Äôd sent me three messages:

[Work‚Äôs killing me tonight. I miss you.]

[Are you asleep?]

[Goodnight.]

I should‚Äôve believed him, but that tie haunted me relentlessly.

I called him.

He picked up immediately‚Äîtoo immediately.

‚ÄúRachel?‚Äù

His deep, husky voice sent a shiver down my spine.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ the thunder woke me. Just wanted to hear your voice.‚Äù

‚ÄúStay on the line, love,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúYou sleep, I‚Äôll keep working.‚Äù

That comforted me a little.

I didn‚Äôt want to interrupt his work, so I just told him to take care and ended the call.

The next morning, I headed into the kitchen‚Äîand froze. Brandon was there, leaning against the counter. I hadn‚Äôt heard him come in last night, though he was supposed to stay at the office.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre back?‚Äù I blinked.

He leaned lazily against the counter, looking entirely too relaxed for someone who‚Äôd supposedly been working late.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt want you driving alone,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFigured I‚Äôd come back and bake your favorite dessert for you.‚Äù

The early light filtered through the windows, highlighting his gentle smile.

We waited for the elevator together. I glanced at the faint shadows under his eyes and felt a pang of guilt.

‚ÄúMy leg‚Äôs healed,‚Äù I murmured. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to run back and forth for me. If you're working late, just rest at the office, okay?‚Äù

The elevator arrived on our floor.

Brandon turned his head and quickly kissed my earlobe.

‚ÄúI know. I just wanted to ride to work with you.‚Äù

My cheeks flushed instantly.

It took me right back to when I was eighteen‚Äîwhen he was still that high school boy who‚Äôd linger in front of my house pretending to tie his shoes, just to ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù bump into me.

And when I called him out on it, he‚Äôd blush like crazy and mutter, ‚ÄúI just wanted to walk you to school‚Ä¶‚Äù

Brandon slipped his arm around my shoulders as we stepped into the elevator.

The girl from upstairs stood inside.

She wore cartoon-print pajamas and fluffy slippers, head down, scrolling her phone‚Äîa stark contrast to the bold figure in last night‚Äôs photo, twisting the knife in my chest.

A far cry from the bold, radiant figure in last night‚Äôs photo.

When we reached the ground floor, she stepped out quickly, brushing past us.

Something shiny in her hair caught my eye.

I looked again.

It wasn‚Äôt a hair clip.

It was Brandon‚Äôs silver tie clip‚Äîthe one he‚Äôd lost months ago.

Chapter 2
I smiled and waved Brandon goodbye.

But the moment I turned my back and stepped out of the car, my heart sank like a stone.

The sun blazed and the sky glowed warm, yet inside, I felt plunged into winter‚Äôs icy depths.

The man I‚Äôd loved for over a decade, the one I‚Äôd planned my future with, was cheating on me‚Äîand had been for months, while I remained clueless.

After wrapping up work, I asked for a half day off, grabbed a cab, and headed straight to Carter & Associates‚ÄîBrandon‚Äôs firm.

But I wasn‚Äôt going there to see him.

I was going to find his car.

Using the spare key, I unlocked the door and pulled up the dashcam footage.

It had all been wiped clean.

Except for one file‚Äîthis morning‚Äôs.

The clip showed Brandon dropping me off, then answering a call.

A voice came through the speakers, casual and unmistakable.

Ethan Blackwell. His oldest friend‚Äîand the one person who always knew a little too much.

‚ÄúYou and your girl have a fight?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe couldn‚Äôt reach you, so she called me.‚Äù

Brandon‚Äôs tone was flat. ‚ÄúI told her not to bother Rachel. This morning when I dropped Rachel off, she deliberately showed up in front of us.‚Äù

Ethan sounded half amused, half annoyed.

‚ÄúDude, what are you thinking? If you‚Äôre so afraid Rachel will find out, why the hell did you move your side piece into the unit upstairs?‚Äù

Brandon was quiet for a beat. Then he said softly, ‚ÄúRachel hurt her leg a while back. She needed someone around.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt trust anyone else to take care of her.‚Äù

Ethan sighed.

‚ÄúYou know what she‚Äôs been through with her parents. You know. And still, you‚Äîforget it. Do what you want. Just‚Ä¶ be careful.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will. I‚Äôve got it under control.‚Äù

Later that evening, I called Brandon and told him I was staying over at Jamie‚Äôs.

He insisted on picking me up. I told him no.

There was a hint of subtle hurt in his voice‚Äîbarely there, but I caught it.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt my baby need me anymore?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll just drop you off, babe. I won‚Äôt linger.‚Äù

‚ÄúI already made plans. Jamie‚Äôs on her way.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen come back early, okay? I can‚Äôt sleep without you.‚Äù

The ache in my chest twisted tighter. I swallowed it down and told him I would.

Earlier, when I left his car, I had slid a voice recorder under the passenger seat.

At midnight, Brandon‚Äôs car rolled into the Westhill Residences parking lot. The passenger door opened, and a girl stepped out.

She reached for his sleeve, her fingers brushing it gently, like she didn‚Äôt want to let go.

Then she looked up at him and whispered something I couldn‚Äôt hear.

Brandon pulled her into his arms like it was instinct.

They kissed beside the car, slow and unhurried, as if no one else existed.

Then he scooped her up in his arms‚Ä¶

And carried her upstairs.

I stood frozen in the shadows, my lungs collapsing, my body forgetting how to breathe.

I opened the door to his car.

Everything inside was spotless. Not a single trace left behind.

Except for the recorder.

I pressed play.

Brandon‚Äôs voice came through first, calm and casual.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll pick you up outside campus. Be ready.‚Äù

Then the car door opened. The girl climbed in.

‚ÄúWhat do you wanna eat?‚Äù he asked.

Her voice dripped with syrupy sweetness. ‚ÄúI wanna you first, Bran.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm driving. Don‚Äôt start.‚Äù

‚ÄúBran‚Ä¶ I wore the lingerie you bought me. Look‚Äîdo you like it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. You look good.‚Äù

‚ÄúLiar. You didn‚Äôt even look.‚Äù

Brandon sighed, tired. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm driving.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen pull over somewhere. I missed you all day. You won‚Äôt even look at me.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt respond.

Moments later, the car stopped.

Click.

The soft sound of his belt being unfastened.

Then the breathing started.

Heavy. Ragged. Desperate.

Then her voice again‚Äîmuffled, broken between gasps. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Bran. I won‚Äôt show up in front of your wife again‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be good, okay? Please don‚Äôt ignore me anymore‚Ä¶‚Äù

Brandon‚Äôs usually cool, composed voice had gone low and hoarse.

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

Chapter 3
My phone rang out of nowhere.

It was Jamie.

‚ÄúRachel, where are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something weird‚Ä¶ Brandon just called, asking if you were at my place.‚Äù

‚ÄúI told him you were sleeping, so he didn‚Äôt push it. But‚Äîdid something happen between you two?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ okay, good then‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHe cheated.‚Äù

There was a beat of stunned silence.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Wait, what?!‚Äù

Jamie‚Äôs voice shot up in disbelief. She went quiet for a moment, then came back, urgent and panicked.

‚ÄúRachel‚Äîwhere are you now?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm outside. Downstairs. My place.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt go home? Where‚Äôs Brandon?‚Äù

I looked up at the lit windows of my apartment.

His apartment, technically.

Bright and warm, like everything was normal.

Upstairs?

Dark.

Empty.

I forced a bitter smile, my heart twisting.

‚ÄúHe brought his mistress home tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt go back there, Jamie.‚Äù

Jamie was terrified I‚Äôd do something stupid. She begged me to stay put, said she‚Äôd be there in ten minutes.

I checked the time.

‚ÄúI just need to drop something off upstairs. I‚Äôll meet you at the gate later.‚Äù

‚ÄúRachel, no‚Äîplease. I‚Äôm begging you. Don‚Äôt go up there. If you really have to, wait for me!‚Äù

I knew she was worried I‚Äôd fall apart the moment I saw it for myself.

But then I looked down at what I was holding.

A keychain.

Found in Brandon‚Äôs car, tucked halfway under the floor mat.

She wanted me to find it.

She wanted me to see her.

So how could I waste her efforts?

I turned on my phone camera before I unlocked the apartment door.

Clothes were scattered all across the living room floor.

Bra. Shirt. Pants. Underwear.

The kind of mess only lust could make.

From the bathroom came a syrupy-soft voice.

‚ÄúBran, can we use your bed this time?‚Äù

Their silhouettes were pressed together behind the frosted glass, tangled in each other.

He hesitated.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôll be a mess. Next time she‚Äôs out of town, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my god, you won‚Äôt even give me that? And you say you like me‚Ä¶‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt finish her whine‚Äîhe shut her up with a kiss.

I walked around the apartment with my camera still recording.

The piano in the study had its cover open.

The lingerie‚Äînot mine‚Äîwas tossed across the top.

There were smudges of something wet on the keys.

I headed into the bedroom.

The nightstand drawer was left ajar, half a box of condoms torn open inside.

Bile rose up in my throat.

I clenched my jaw and reached into my bag for a needle and thread.

Fine.

If he liked playing games so much‚Äî

Let him play all the way.

I pierced tiny holes in the remaining condoms

Let him live dangerously.

Finally, the bathroom door opened.

Steam billowed out.

Brandon walked out carrying her in his arms, towel around her, wet hair dripping against his chest.

Then he saw me.

And froze.

The girl screamed, scrambling to bury herself deeper in his embrace.

I walked right up to him.

His face‚Äîstill the chiseled jawline, dark lashes, damp hair clinging to his forehead‚Äîheld the sharp, cool handsomeness I‚Äôd once found irresistible.

But now? There was panic in those eyes. The kind he‚Äôd never shown before.

‚ÄúRachel, I‚Äî‚Äù

I cut him off. Looked straight at the girl clinging to his chest.

‚ÄúAshley Monroe. Hooking up in someone else‚Äôs home. Must be so exciting, huh?‚Äù

She clutched the towel tighter, cheeks burning pink as she tried to disappear into him.

Brandon tightened his lips.

‚ÄúThis has nothing to do with her. It‚Äôs my fault.‚Äù

I gave him a slow once-over, eyes lingering on his very naked chest.

Then I smiled coldly.

‚ÄúWell, put some damn clothes on, Counselor Carter.‚Äù

Ignoring the storm cloud forming on his face, I tossed the keychain straight at Ashley, my chest tight with rage, and walked out.

Chapter 4
Jamie took me to Luna Lounge for a drink‚Äîor three.

The second I got into the car, Brandon‚Äôs name lit up on my phone.

I declined the call.

He called again.

I put it on silent.

Jamie glanced at me through the rearview mirror, cautious but curious.

‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt chase after you? Just let you walk out like that?‚Äù

I pulled the corners of my lips into a dry smile.

‚ÄúHe was naked.‚Äù

Jamie smacked the steering wheel.

‚ÄúMotherf‚Äîwhat the hell.‚Äù

She exhaled hard, then asked, ‚ÄúSo who is she? The side piece‚Äîyou recognize her?‚Äù

I thought of the keychain in my coat pocket.

‚ÄúAshley Monroe.‚Äù

Jamie frowned. ‚ÄúAshley‚Ä¶ wait, that sounds familiar.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve met her before.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe?‚Äù she repeated, eyebrows shooting up as the gears turned‚Äîthen suddenly, her eyes widened.

‚ÄúNo way‚Äîit‚Äôs that girl?!‚Äù

Half a year ago, Brandon had joined us for a casual day of shopping. He‚Äôd gone to get us coffee while Jamie and I browsed.

Suddenly, chaos broke out in front of one of the escalators.

A group of women were beating a girl to the ground, screaming insults, spitting threats. It was brutal.

The girl looked terrified, trying to shield her face, her voice shaking as she pleaded:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the wrong person! I swear, I‚Äôm not some homewrecker!‚Äù

One of the women yanked her up by the hair, shouting, ‚ÄúYou think we‚Äôre blind?! He spent all his damn money on you!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou shameless slut‚Äîeither cough up the cash or I‚Äôm stripping you naked so everyone can see exactly how you seduced him!‚Äù

Then came the slap‚Äîsharp and violent.

The girl staggered, bolted, and crashed straight into me.

I gasped and stumbled back.

Just in time, someone caught me‚ÄîBrandon, back with our drinks.

He steadied me, murmuring gently, ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù

Security arrived and broke up the fight, escorting the attackers out.

The girl, face tear-streaked and dress dirty, ran to us, begging:

‚ÄúPlease, they‚Äôre probably waiting outside to jump me again! Can I get a ride with you? Please?‚Äù

She must‚Äôve seen the suspicion in my eyes, because she quickly pulled out her keychain and thrust it forward.

‚ÄúI swear, I didn‚Äôt do anything. My name‚Äôs Ashley Monroe‚ÄîI‚Äôm a sophomore at Rosebridge University. Ballet major.‚Äù

‚ÄúI post dance videos online. That‚Äôs all I do, I promise. They‚Äôre just crazy jealous!‚Äù

She kept pleading with wide, tear-filled eyes‚Äîvoice trembling, phone in hand‚Äîlike I was the only person who could save her.

Her dress had footprints on it. Her shoes were gone.

And I‚Äîsofthearted idiot that I was‚Äîtold Brandon to drive her home.

On the ride, she‚Äôd asked what we did for work.

When she heard Brandon was a lawyer, she lit up and asked for his card. Said she might need help ‚Äúif this ever happens again.‚Äù

----

‚ÄúWe should‚Äôve left that fake-ass ballerina on the sidewalk.‚Äù Jamie groaned from the driver‚Äôs seat, practically growling.

‚ÄúBet she had her eyes on Brandon from the moment she got in the damn car.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond.

But I couldn‚Äôt forget I couldn‚Äôt forget how Brandon looked at her tonight, carrying her gently from the bathroom with soft, protective eyes, as if she were fragile.

I curled my fingers into a fist.

She knew how to cry pretty, and Brandon Carter‚Äîapparently, he couldn‚Äôt resist a good performance.

1mhle9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1mhle9f/should_i_simply_place_a_4star_review_or_contact/,Should I simply place a 4-star review or contact Airbnb support for a dirty and under-supplied apartment? [USA],"Sorry if I sound naive. My first Airbnb was back in 2017 and I just booked my 2nd Airbnb last week.

Our Airbnb was a nice apartment within a private apartment building and shared access to a pool/gym. On the first day before check-in, the host sent a message showing a slightly different address, and check-in instructions. There was a clear note to not ask the front desk for anything as it would cause confusion. 

Is that normal?

The floors were very filthy when we arrived. It did have clean sheets, clean kitchen, and clean furniture, but there was so much dust and dirt on the floor with small crumbs of tortilla chips stuck in the rug. We used 3 of our own Swiffer pads and a mop pad to clean the vinyl floors during our first day. The vacuum didn't seem to work so we weren't able to clean off all the potatoes chips in the TV room rug.

The coffee machine only worked once. Looked like a $10 coffee maker.

There was enough detergent for half a load of laundry. We couldn't even wash a full load during our stay.

No dishwasher soap, but we hand washed what we could by hand. No sponge for the counter top. There were no backup trash bags. No cooking oil. No plastic wrap or tin foil for storing cooked food in the refrigerator. 

Toilet paper was so thin you could take a photo through it with your phone.

There's no specific cleaning fee in our receipt, but after we messaged the host about these issues, the host replied that he would forward my notes to the ""cleaning crew"". Host did not apologize, but he said ""thank you"" for letting him know.

Shouldn't the host apologize instead of saying thank you? 

I think it's crazy to walk into an apartment with dirty floors with not even the minimum requirement for cooking and cleaning tasks for me to use.

To resolve some of these issues, we took a short drive back to our home to pick up trash bags, cleaning and kitchen supplies during our 2nd day of the trip.",3,1754331828.0,AirBnB,10,0.71,False

The wiring diagram for the upper freight panel was smudged with coffee stains and its edges were curled.

He blinked; his eyes were dry.

The buzz of the refrigerator and the hum of the overhead fluorescents filled the room. White light, sterile, typical. He scratched his jaw, leaned back in the chair, and closed his eyes.

The radio clicked to life with a rasp, pulling Michael back from his slumber.

‚ÄúMichael, are you there? Come in, Michael. Miiiiiichaellll, wake up!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, Syd?‚Äù

‚ÄúWere you sleeping again? I swear to God, one day they‚Äôll catch you.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust a friendly call, then?‚Äù

‚ÄúCheck the electrical. We‚Äôve got flickers up here. Screens jumping. Received a few calls from residents who‚Äôd like to get through their schlocky evening shows.‚Äù

Michael sighed and stood. His knees cracked as he trudged to the building systems terminal and tapped the screen. It flickered once, then lit up a grid of subsystems glowing in monochrome green.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see which one of you decided to act up tonight.‚Äù

>

He frowned. There was no Elevator 8. Michael refreshed the screen. Same result.

\---

The service corridor sloped downward, past crawling paces and hissing pipes. This wasn‚Äôt the tenant side. No drop ceilings. No floor polish. Just concrete and cables.

He passed Elevators 3 and 5, metal doors, numbered valves, and maintenance stairs‚Ä¶. There it was. At the far end of the hallway: an 8^(th)¬†elevator. No signage. No scuffs. Just a frame of brushed steel that didn‚Äôt quite reflect but somehow still caught light.

Its call button was already glowing. A band of warm amber slipped through the crack in the doors and radiated across the floor. Oddly inviting.

Michael approached cautiously, crouched down, and opened the access panel beside the frame. Standard wiring. No alarms. No digital lockout. Nothing strange‚Ä¶ except it shouldn‚Äôt be here‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt here before.

He stood up, thinking.

***Ding!***

The doors slid open.

Michael flinched, instinctively stepped back.

Inside‚Ä¶ not a maintenance cab, not even close. The interior was wood-paneled with a sycamore veneer and polished brass finishing. The citrus scent of lemon oil hung in the air. It wasn‚Äôt new but had the modernist class of art deco. Whatever this elevator was, wherever it came from, it wanted to be seen.

Michael stared at it for a moment, snorted, rubbed his eyes, and stepped in. The doors slid shut the moment his feet crossed the threshold. No delay. No ding. Just a clanking sound and a click.

Michael stopped short. He turned slowly toward the panel. ‚Äò*B‚Äô*¬†was glowing. With a low hum, a creak, and a jolt, the elevator started descending.

He let out a quiet breath, ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúGuess we‚Äôre doing this.‚Äù

\---

**Floor B**  
The elevator came to a halt, and the doors opened. On the other side of the doors was only absolute darkness and eerie silence.

Michael lit his flashlight, popped his head out, and swept the beam around, but he still couldn‚Äôt make out any walls or pillars.

‚ÄúNot stepping out in there,‚Äù he muttered. His voice reverberated through the room, but not only his voice bounced off the walls‚Ä¶ He heard footsteps. First distant, slow taps of leather shoes on concrete, then faster, deliberately closing in from the darkness.

Michael panicked, reached for the panel, slapped the ‚Äò*Close‚Äô*¬†button repeatedly, ‚ÄúCome on, close, close, close.‚Äù The doors began to inch shut.

Just before they did, a man slid in. Gracefully, but not without effort.

Michael backed up against the far wall of the elevator cabin.

‚ÄúWhoo. That was close. Thanks for holding the door,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúCourtesy‚Äôs a rare luxury these days.‚Äù He wore a smudged maintenance coverall, streaked with grease and soot. His voice was warm and unbothered. The kind of tone you use at a formal gathering when you‚Äôre not quite sure of the rules.

The man pressed three buttons with practiced ease, then turned to Michael with a spark in his eye. ‚ÄúYou look overdue for a different route.‚Äù

Michael didn‚Äôt answer. He just watched the numbers tick as the elevator creaked back into motion.

\---

**Floor T**  
The doors opened to a ray of gold. A room bathed in soft amber light, every wall covered in clocks of all sorts and shapes. Mantles. Grandfathers. Digital readouts. Pocket watches mounted under glass. Every single one perfectly synchronized.

*Tick. Tick. Tick.*

Michael stepped forward. The rhythm was soothing, predictable, almost hypnotic.

‚ÄúEasy, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù the man said behind him. ‚ÄúWhat a delightful rhythm. You fall into place, and it takes you with the current.‚Äù

Michael said nothing. A tea trolley with refreshments next to an Eames Lounge chair caught his eye. It was filled with tiny bottles of sparkling water, Scotch, Delirium beer, and Sancerre wine.

Michael reached for the brandy. It wouldn‚Äôt open. Only the water bottle released from the tray.

‚ÄúFunny, that,‚Äù the man quipped.

Michael took a swig. Not refreshment but an uncanny feeling filled his stomach. Something was out of place‚Ä¶ There was one tick, off-beat.

He searched for it next to the midcentury grandfather clock, behind the display of Patek Philippe watches, and found it on the chimney mantel.

A wadokei\*, wedged between two larger pieces, ticking on its own rhythm. Michael recognized the symbols Ushi, Inu, and Tora.

When the dial passed Tora, a cuckoo burst out in a screech so absurd and loud, Michael stumbled back.

He crashed into a mirror. In it, he saw himself. Same uniform. But older. Paler. Smaller. Ashy.

Michael turned. The elevator was still open. He ran in without hesitation.

The man smirked. ‚ÄúProps on you, Michael, some people never hear it.‚Äù He wound his pocket clock, ‚ÄúGolly, we have to hurry for your 3:30 AM appointment.‚Äù

The cabin lurched back into motion.

\---

**Floor D**

Michael was still panting and sweating as the door opened again. This wasn‚Äôt a room but a plain of lush grass under a pale blue sky.

The man exited, but Michael stayed in the cabin. Only now he realized the man‚Äôs uniform had changed. A pressed red uniform of an Italian Piccolo. Hair tight, and an inviting smile.

‚ÄúI promise the doors will stay open,‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúStep through when you are ready. The appointment is informal, but it can‚Äôt be rescheduled.‚Äù

Michael hesitated until he saw the paper planes. Hundreds of folded pieces of paper floating in the air, moving slowly toward the sun.

One brushed Michael‚Äôs cheek as he stepped out. The plane was folded neatly, weightless. On the wing it read:¬†*Go to Tokyo. Just go.*

Michael stared at it. He recognized it. ‚ÄúShe was already there,‚Äù he said, more to himself. ‚ÄúHad an apartment, sent me the forms, lined up an interview for me. She even found a Japanese language course‚Ä¶‚Äù He paused, ‚ÄúShe had everything prepared‚Ä¶ I said maybe.‚Äù He looked up. ‚ÄúIt meant no. I just didn‚Äôt say it out loud.‚Äù

The man caught another plane. ‚ÄúTake the robotics course,‚Äù he read aloud. ‚ÄúPractical. Inspiring.‚Äù

Michael laughed once, bitterly. ‚ÄúI had the application filled out. Got this job instead, it‚Äôs more steady, you never know where the market goes. It was safe, smart.‚Äù

‚ÄúSome of these,‚Äù Michael didn‚Äôt finish his sentence.

‚ÄúTake one,‚Äù the man said.

Michael didn‚Äôt respond. The planes drifted overhead, like birds migrating south.

***Ding!***

The man walked back to the elevator, ‚ÄúYour 5 AM is waiting, mustn‚Äôt be late.‚Äù

\---

**Floor E**  
The final floor opened to a rooftop. Not one Michael recognized. The air was scented faintly with ozone, like after a thunderstorm. City lights shimmered across the river. A soft wind tugged at his collar.

Michael tucked his hair behind his ears and looked straight up. ‚ÄúWhy are you showi‚Ä¶ he lost the thought, distracted by the sky. One constellation pulsed like a microchip, another was shaped like a guitar. Another was‚Ä¶

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù the man interrupted. ‚ÄúShall we proceed up or down?‚Äù

Michael looked at him, ‚ÄúWhat doe‚Ä¶‚Äù

The man finished his sentence, ‚Äú‚Ä¶does this mean, what should I do, what is happening, am I dead?‚Äù He paused, ‚ÄúWhat if I make the wrong choice?‚Äù

The man looked Michael sternly in the eyes. ‚ÄúDoes it matter? Up or Down? New or Old? Adventure or back to every day the same?‚Äù

Michael looked him in the eyes. He stepped into the elevator, took a long breath, and pushed a button.

\---

**Down is Up, Up is Down**  
The elevator shuddered. Light danced across the brass handles. The walls turned transparent, and stars were everywhere.

The elevator picked up speed. The stars smeared sideways. Purple. Green. White. Like someone dragging a brush across the dark. Now the floor and ceiling became transparent. Michael and the man floated through space in a transparent elevator cab.

Michael gripped the rail.

‚ÄúAdventure, few make that choice,‚Äù the man said softly, ‚Äúbut it is never without risk‚Ä¶‚Äù

The speed became unbearable. The brass handles ripped free. The cab dissolved around them, no walls, no floor, just starlight and velocity until only blackness remained.

**Morning**  
Michael opened his eyes. Same chair, same diagram, familiar hum. He rubbed his eyes, blinked. In front of him, a laptop and an open webpage:¬†*Intro to Robotics. Enroll Now.*

He took a second, clicked Submit, and got up.

He didn‚Äôt rush, just packed his bag, dropped the old binder in a recycling bin, and took the lobby elevator up to the employee exit. Michael didn‚Äôt smile, but he stepped out on the sidewalk.

The sound of the morning commute, traffic, honking cabs, supply trucks, and the smell of breakfast carts were familiar. Michael wasn‚Äôt different. Not reborn. But his life was finally moving again.

The cabin lurched back into motion.

\---

**Floor D**

Michael was still panting and sweating as the door opened again. This wasn‚Äôt a room but a plain of lush grass under a pale blue sky.

The man exited, but Michael stayed in the cabin. Only now he realized the man‚Äôs uniform had changed. A pressed red uniform of an Italian Piccolo. Hair tight, and an inviting smile.

‚ÄúI promise the doors will stay open,‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúStep through when you are ready. The appointment is informal, but it can‚Äôt be rescheduled.‚Äù

Michael hesitated until he saw the paper planes. Hundreds of folded pieces of paper floating in the air, moving slowly toward the sun.

One brushed Michael‚Äôs cheek as he stepped out. The plane was folded neatly, weightless. On the wing it read:¬†*Go to Tokyo. Just go.*

Michael stared at it. He recognized it. ‚ÄúShe was already there,‚Äù he said, more to himself. ‚ÄúHad an apartment, sent me the forms, lined up an interview for me. She even found a Japanese language course‚Ä¶‚Äù He paused, ‚ÄúShe had everything prepared‚Ä¶ I said maybe.‚Äù He looked up. ‚ÄúIt meant no. I just didn‚Äôt say it out loud.‚Äù

The man caught another plane. ‚ÄúTake the robotics course,‚Äù he read aloud. ‚ÄúPractical. Inspiring.‚Äù

Michael laughed once, bitterly. ‚ÄúI had the application filled out. Got this job instead, it‚Äôs more steady, you never know where the market goes. It was safe, smart.‚Äù

‚ÄúSome of these,‚Äù Michael didn‚Äôt finish his sentence.

‚ÄúTake one,‚Äù the man said.

Michael didn‚Äôt respond. The planes drifted overhead, like birds migrating south.

***Ding!***

The man walked back to the elevator, ‚ÄúYour 5 AM is waiting, mustn‚Äôt be late.‚Äù

\---

**Floor E**  
The final floor opened to a rooftop. Not one Michael recognized. The air was scented faintly with ozone, like after a thunderstorm. City lights shimmered across the river. A soft wind tugged at his collar.

Michael tucked his hair behind his ears and looked straight up. ‚ÄúWhy are you showi‚Ä¶ he lost the thought, distracted by the sky. One constellation pulsed like a microchip, another was shaped like a guitar. Another was‚Ä¶

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù the man interrupted. ‚ÄúShall we proceed up or down?‚Äù

Michael looked at him, ‚ÄúWhat doe‚Ä¶‚Äù

The man finished his sentence, ‚Äú‚Ä¶does this mean, what should I do, what is happening, am I dead?‚Äù He paused, ‚ÄúWhat if I make the wrong choice?‚Äù

The man looked Michael sternly in the eyes. ‚ÄúDoes it matter? Up or Down? New or Old? Adventure or back to every day the same?‚Äù

Michael looked him in the eyes. He stepped into the elevator, took a long breath, and pushed a button.

\---

**Down is Up, Up is Down**  
The elevator shuddered. Light danced across the brass handles. The walls turned transparent, and stars were everywhere.

The elevator picked up speed. The stars smeared sideways. Purple. Green. White. Like someone dragging a brush across the dark. Now the floor and ceiling became transparent. Michael and the man floated through space in a transparent elevator cab.

Michael gripped the rail.

‚ÄúAdventure, few make that choice,‚Äù the man said softly, ‚Äúbut it is never without risk‚Ä¶‚Äù

The speed became unbearable. The brass handles ripped free. The cab dissolved around them, no walls, no floor, just starlight and velocity until only blackness remained.

**Morning**  
Michael opened his eyes. Same chair, same diagram, familiar hum. He rubbed his eyes, blinked. In front of him, a laptop and an open webpage:¬†*Intro to Robotics. Enroll Now.*

He took a second, clicked Submit, and got up.

He didn‚Äôt rush, just packed his bag, dropped the old binder in a recycling bin, and took the lobby elevator up to the employee exit. Michael didn‚Äôt smile, but he stepped out on the sidewalk.

The sound of the morning commute, traffic, honking cabs, supply trucks, and the smell of breakfast carts were familiar. Michael wasn‚Äôt different. Not reborn. But his life was finally moving again.

1mhl7fi,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1mhl7fi/explore_the_best_french_press_coffee_maker/,Explore the Best French Press Coffee Maker Stanley Review Worth It,"**A hands-on review of Stanley 10-0288800 French Press**  

Being a coffee enthusiast who thrives on freshly brewed cups to kickstart my mornings, testing out the Stanley 10-0288800 French Press felt like a treat. Whether it‚Äôs for rugged outdoor adventures or cozy mornings at home, this coffee maker seems built with versatility in mind.

**Design and Durability**  

The robust design immediately catches your eye. Its sturdy stainless steel construction boasts serious durability, making you wonder if this was built to survive an apocalypse. The Hammertone Green exterior lends a vintage charm, which interestingly fits just as well in a sleek urban kitchen as it does on a rocky camping trail. Another standout detail is the double vacuum insulation. Not just a fancy buzzword, it genuinely keeps your coffee piping hot for up to four hours‚Äîor so the brand claims, and my experience proved it fairly accurate during a particularly cold evening by the campfire. Dropping this French press during one of my clumsier moments only confirmed its resilience; no dents, cracks, or damage to report.

**Ease of Use**  

For anyone intimidated by the ""French Press ritual,"" don‚Äôt be. This gadget simplifies things. Add in your preferred coffee grounds, pour in some boiling water, wait five minutes, and press the plunger. Done. The reusable mesh filter is fine enough to keep grounds from sneaking into your cup, a common annoyance I‚Äôve faced with other French presses. It doesn‚Äôt require any special expertise, which is a huge plus for beginners.  

[Check Stanley 10-0288800 price on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b07l6lqhb4/)  

**Advantages**  

One of its strongest selling points is its effectiveness in maintaining temperatures. Hot or cold, your beverage stays just how you like it.  

- Double vacuum insulation ensures contents stay hot for 4 hours or cold for 9 hours.  
- Reusable mesh filter prevents waste and extra expense on paper filters.  
- Dishwasher-safe parts make cleanup a no-brainer.  

**Disadvantages**  

As impressed as I am with this French press, it‚Äôs not without its hiccups.  

- It‚Äôs heavy compared to standard French presses, which might be inconvenient for ultralight backpacking.  
- The plunger mechanism, while sturdy, could use a bit more refinement. It sometimes requires extra effort to press down fully.  
- It takes up more counter space than compact alternatives, which may bother those with tight kitchens.  

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  

What‚Äôs the point of buying a French press if the coffee isn‚Äôt up to snuff? My ritual test centers around coarse-ground coffee beans, freshly roasted. With this device, the results were spectacularly consistent. No stray grounds floating in my cup and coffee that tasted rich and full-bodied every single time. What impressed me most was trying this outside during a family camping trip‚Äîit stood up to chilly wind, and every pour remained steaming. I even left it for nearly three hours, and it was still warm when everyone wanted an encore cup! The 48-ounce size is generous too, perfect for sharing.

**Competing Products**  

Compared to something like the Bodum Chambord or the Kona French Press, this one stands out for its durability and insulation. The Bodum feels daintier, which works for indoor settings but wouldn‚Äôt last long in outdoor elements. On the flip side, Kona might be slightly easier to use due to its lightweight build. Where the Stanley wins them all over, however, is in heat retention. The typical French press loses heat long before you‚Äôre ready for your second cup; this one is the opposite, accommodating leisurely coffee drinkers.

**Cost Efficiency**  

Considering its materials, durability, and unique thermal properties, the product does justify its price tag. Sure, you could grab a more affordable French press, but this is an investment, especially for active coffee drinkers or campers. For anyone fed up with replacing flimsy coffee makers or constantly reheating drinks, this promises long-term savings and convenience.

1mhl6os,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1mhl6os/elevator_e8/,Elevator E8,"Michael realized he hadn‚Äôt been reading at all. He‚Äôd been staring at the same page for twenty minutes when a fly landed dead-center on the binder, wings twitching above a diagram.

The wiring diagram for the upper freight panel was smudged with coffee stains and its edges were curled.

He blinked; his eyes were dry.

The buzz of the refrigerator and the hum of the overhead fluorescents filled the room. White light, sterile, typical. He scratched his jaw, leaned back in the chair, and closed his eyes.

The radio clicked to life with a rasp, pulling Michael back from his slumber.

‚ÄúMichael, are you there? Come in, Michael. Miiiiiichaellll, wake up!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, Syd?‚Äù

‚ÄúWere you sleeping again? I swear to God, one day they‚Äôll catch you.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust a friendly call, then?‚Äù

‚ÄúCheck the electrical. We‚Äôve got flickers up here. Screens jumping. Received a few calls from residents who‚Äôd like to get through their schlocky evening shows.‚Äù

Michael sighed and stood. His knees cracked as he trudged to the building systems terminal and tapped the screen. It flickered once, then lit up a grid of subsystems glowing in monochrome green.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see which one of you decided to act up tonight.‚Äù

>

He frowned. There was no Elevator 8. Michael refreshed the screen. Same result.

\---

The service corridor sloped downward, past crawling paces and hissing pipes. This wasn‚Äôt the tenant side. No drop ceilings. No floor polish. Just concrete and cables.

He passed Elevators 3 and 5, metal doors, numbered valves, and maintenance stairs‚Ä¶. There it was. At the far end of the hallway: an 8^(th)¬†elevator. No signage. No scuffs. Just a frame of brushed steel that didn‚Äôt quite reflect but somehow still caught light.

Its call button was already glowing. A band of warm amber slipped through the crack in the doors and radiated across the floor. Oddly inviting.

Michael approached cautiously, crouched down, and opened the access panel beside the frame. Standard wiring. No alarms. No digital lockout. Nothing strange‚Ä¶ except it shouldn‚Äôt be here‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt here before.

He stood up, thinking.

***Ding!***

The doors slid open.

Michael flinched, instinctively stepped back.

Inside‚Ä¶ not a maintenance cab, not even close. The interior was wood-paneled with a sycamore veneer and polished brass finishing. The citrus scent of lemon oil hung in the air. It wasn‚Äôt new but had the modernist class of art deco. Whatever this elevator was, wherever it came from, it wanted to be seen.

Michael stared at it for a moment, snorted, rubbed his eyes, and stepped in. The doors slid shut the moment his feet crossed the threshold. No delay. No ding. Just a clanking sound and a click.

Michael stopped short. He turned slowly toward the panel. ‚Äò*B‚Äô*¬†was glowing. With a low hum, a creak, and a jolt, the elevator started descending.

He let out a quiet breath, ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúGuess we‚Äôre doing this.‚Äù

\---

**Floor B**  
The elevator came to a halt, and the doors opened. On the other side of the doors was only absolute darkness and eerie silence.

Michael lit his flashlight, popped his head out, and swept the beam around, but he still couldn‚Äôt make out any walls or pillars.

‚ÄúNot stepping out in there,‚Äù he muttered. His voice reverberated through the room, but not only his voice bounced off the walls‚Ä¶ He heard footsteps. First distant, slow taps of leather shoes on concrete, then faster, deliberately closing in from the darkness.

Michael panicked, reached for the panel, slapped the ‚Äò*Close‚Äô*¬†button repeatedly, ‚ÄúCome on, close, close, close.‚Äù The doors began to inch shut.

Just before they did, a man slid in. Gracefully, but not without effort.

Michael backed up against the far wall of the elevator cabin.

‚ÄúWhoo. That was close. Thanks for holding the door,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúCourtesy‚Äôs a rare luxury these days.‚Äù He wore a smudged maintenance coverall, streaked with grease and soot. His voice was warm and unbothered. The kind of tone you use at a formal gathering when you‚Äôre not quite sure of the rules.

The man pressed three buttons with practiced ease, then turned to Michael with a spark in his eye. ‚ÄúYou look overdue for a different route.‚Äù

Michael didn‚Äôt answer. He just watched the numbers tick as the elevator creaked back into motion.

\---

**Floor T**  
The doors opened to a ray of gold. A room bathed in soft amber light, every wall covered in clocks of all sorts and shapes. Mantles. Grandfathers. Digital readouts. Pocket watches mounted under glass. Every single one perfectly synchronized.

*Tick. Tick. Tick.*

Michael stepped forward. The rhythm was soothing, predictable, almost hypnotic.

‚ÄúEasy, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù the man said behind him. ‚ÄúWhat a delightful rhythm. You fall into place, and it takes you with the current.‚Äù

Michael said nothing. A tea trolley with refreshments next to an Eames Lounge chair caught his eye. It was filled with tiny bottles of sparkling water, Scotch, Delirium beer, and Sancerre wine.

Michael reached for the brandy. It wouldn‚Äôt open. Only the water bottle released from the tray.

‚ÄúFunny, that,‚Äù the man quipped.

Michael took a swig. Not refreshment but an uncanny feeling filled his stomach. Something was out of place‚Ä¶ There was one tick, off-beat.

He searched for it next to the midcentury grandfather clock, behind the display of Patek Philippe watches, and found it on the chimney mantel.

A wadokei\*, wedged between two larger pieces, ticking on its own rhythm. Michael recognized the symbols Ushi, Inu, and Tora.

When the dial passed Tora, a cuckoo burst out in a screech so absurd and loud, Michael stumbled back.

He crashed into a mirror. In it, he saw himself. Same uniform. But older. Paler. Smaller. Ashy.

Michael turned. The elevator was still open. He ran in without hesitation.

The man smirked. ‚ÄúProps on you, Michael, some people never hear it.‚Äù He wound his pocket clock, ‚ÄúGolly, we have to hurry for your 3:30 AM appointment.‚Äù

The cabin lurched back into motion.

Michael was still panting and sweating as the door opened again. This wasn‚Äôt a room but a plain of lush grass under a pale blue sky.

‚ÄúI promise the doors will stay open,‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúStep through when you are ready. The appointment is informal, but it can‚Äôt be rescheduled.‚Äù

Michael hesitated until he saw the paper planes. Hundreds of folded pieces of paper floating in the air, moving slowly toward the sun.

Michael laughed once, bitterly. ‚ÄúI had the application filled out. Got this job instead, it‚Äôs more steady, you never know where the market goes. It was safe, smart.‚Äù

‚ÄúSome of these,‚Äù Michael didn‚Äôt finish his sentence.

The weapon he used was especially effective against mirror copies, yet even it had trouble dealing with the amount. It also turned out that while copycat allowed him to copy class skills, the same couldn‚Äôt be said for the ability to create infinite mirror copies. Even in the mirror realm, Will remained limited by the number of mirror shards he had with him.

The multi-colored merchant emerged amidst the sea of thieves, shattering dozens of them in the process. A few of them tried to fight back, but quickly found that the entity was effectively indestructible.

‚ÄúI want a boost!‚Äù Will tossed the class token towards the merchant.

Knowing what that would result in, Alex‚Äôs copies tried to grab the item, but each and every attempt was met with instant destruction. Another thing the merchant didn‚Äôt appreciate was anyone getting between him and his deal.

‚ÄúArcher,‚Äù Will said right before the item found its way into the merchant‚Äôs hand.

¬†

**LONG RANGE TARGETING**

**Hit a target at a massive distance.**

¬†

**PROJECTILE WEAPONS**

**Gain proficiency with non-explosive projectile weapons.**

¬†

**ARCHER‚Äôs ARROW**

**Materialize a single arrow per shot.**

¬†

Messages appeared throughout the mirror realm.

*Endless ammunition?* Will wondered.

No wonder the archer was so powerful. Not only did it become severely overpowered at later levels, but it also got an unfair start. When it came to attack, none of the other classes Will had obtained came close. One could argue that the clairvoyant was more powerful in other ways, but even that wouldn‚Äôt withstand the pain of constant death.

¬†

**UPGRADE**

**Binding whip-blade transformed into short bow.**

**Damage capacity reduced to 10**

**Binding lost.**

¬†

The weapon changed in Will‚Äôs hands. Then, he performed his first true long-ranged attack. His hands moved quickly and precisely as if he‚Äôd been using the weapon for years.

A single arrow materialized in his fingers.

The rogue pulled the bowstring, aiming at the source of the mirror copies, then released the projectile. With a whizzing sound the arrow split the air, shattering through dozens of mirror copies as if they were nothing.

Quickly, Will pulled the bowstring again. Another arrow appeared.

*This really is unfair*, he thought as he let off another shot.

In terms of destructive power, the bow was definitely a lot more destructive than the whip-blade. The only shortcoming was that it wasn‚Äôt a defense weapon. Although a large number of mirror copies had clustered around Alex to keep him safe, the rest remained on the attack. One good stab and Will‚Äôs loop would be over. Thankfully, he had his own guardian as well.

Leaping up from one of the shadows, the shadow wolf emerged, shattering a mirror copy in the process. The presence of the black wolf instantly caused Alex to freeze. The creation of mirror copies instantly ceased, creating an empty ring in his immediate vicinity. Obviously, he still remembered his recent encounter in the school corridor.

‚ÄúI saved you from the wolves,‚Äù Will shouted. ‚ÄúYou remember what that was like.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah. I have no idea, bro.‚Äù

Nothing in his behavior suggested that he was lying or even cared. The change of air currents coming from his nose, however, betrayed him. From Will‚Äôs perspective, the goofball might as well have confessed.

‚ÄúI just want to talk,‚Äù the rogue pushed on, holding an arrow at the ready.

The suggestion had an effect. All the mirror copies spontaneously stopped in place. Now that they were still, they seemed even more than Will had thought they were. All of them were seemingly calm. Some held knives at the ready; others didn‚Äôt. Yet, the boy didn‚Äôt doubt for a single moment that they could charge at him at the drop of a hat.

‚ÄúThe nightmares you had. Do you remember what was in them?‚Äù

‚ÄúLots of things, bro.‚Äù

‚ÄúApart from the wolves, you remember Danny, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

The silence suggested that Alex did.

‚ÄúEly too?‚Äù

The original Alex narrowed his eyes just a fraction.

‚ÄúWhat about‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI remember you, too, bro. You were with the wolves.‚Äù He glanced at the Will‚Äôs shadow wolf. ‚ÄúJust like that one. They were fighting.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was protecting you from the other wolf.‚Äù

The explanation sounded so bad that Will regretted ever saying anything.

‚ÄúThe important thing is‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, bro,‚Äù Alex cut him off. ‚ÄúDanny warned me about you.‚Äù

Cold chills ran down Will‚Äôs spine. He was certain he had heard the full conversation between Alex and Danny. At most, a few seconds were missing. Although, it was also possible that more was said before that.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre with them, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs them?‚Äù Will didn‚Äôt like the way the conversation was going.

Did another power exist‚Äîan alliance that he had completely missed? Everyone he had spoken to in the future was adamant that the archer was the greatest threat. There was talk of other allied groups, but nothing indicated they were as dangerous. Spencer, the acrobat, even the lancer agreed on that.

‚ÄúThe creatures of eternity, bro,‚Äù the goofball continued. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one of them. You look human, but you aren‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt even exist! You‚Äôre just a fake reflection that isn‚Äôt part of the world.‚Äù

A lump formed in Will‚Äôs throat. For a moment, he was concerned about being on the verge of something. Sadly, all that he witnessed was the actual result of Alex‚Äôs true mental state. Whatever Danny had done to him, it had ripped out most of the knowledge he had in the past. Pieces were left, but they were mere fragments of what was, that his mind tried to glue together.

‚ÄúDid you come to stop me, bro?‚Äù Alex asked.

‚ÄúI came to stop Danny. He‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHe did a lot of things, I know. The good‚Äôs more than the bad, bro. You‚Ä¶‚Äù the goofball shook his head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve no idea what you really want. You don‚Äôt fight to kill, but you‚Äôre not safe either. Do you really know what you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù

For some reason, the question struck a nerve.

‚ÄúBig oof, bro.‚Äù Alex laughed along with several dozen of his mirror copies. ‚ÄúGet that sorted first, then come at me. We‚Äôll continue this.‚Äù

*No, we won‚Äôt.*

¬†

**Ending prediction loop.**

¬†

The hundreds of mirror copies were gone, leaving Will standing alone. Logically, there was no reason for such a trivial encounter to hit him this hard, but it had. Gone was the goofball he knew, replaced by something he couldn‚Äôt even describe. It wasn‚Äôt hatred, it wasn‚Äôt apathy, Alex was just like a wounded creature trying to survive. The worst part was that he felt more confident forming an alliance with Daniel than joining Will.

Will glanced at the rogue mirror. Within moments, Danny would rush in to claim his class, as he did at the start of every loop.

*I always knew it wouldn‚Äôt be easy*, Will thought to himself as he stepped to the side. Having to face the person who had set him off on this whole challenge to the past felt off. And the worst part was that if that had happened to Alex, it could also happen to Helen. In fact, if paradox logic was to be believed, it already had.

‚ÄúMerchant,‚Äù Will muttered.

The faithful trader came into existence with a bow.

‚ÄúArcher.‚Äù Will took out his class token and tossed it to the entity.

Messages covered the floor and ceiling just as before.

¬†

**\[The choice is good.\]**

¬†

The guide gave its two cents. If it was meant to serve as support, Will didn‚Äôt see it. The reason he was forced to claim the archer class was due to Alex officially becoming his enemy‚Ä¶ at least until Will managed to kill Danny.

¬†

**PREDICTION LOOP**

Will set his mind on other things in the hope that doing challenges with Luke would take his mind off things. Whether it was a delusion or just postponing the problem didn‚Äôt particularly matter because it worked.

The very first challenge the two of them set off to complete proved to be beyond the enchanter‚Äôs current skills, requiring five redoes until he managed to complete it unharmed. The reward was a marginally useful skill, although for Luke, who had next to no permanents, it seemed like the best thing ever. Will, in turn, only was rewarded a relatively large amount of coins. Eternity was surprisingly strict when it came to granting him skills. Not that it mattered particularly. Thanks to his personal merchant, he had the option to exchange coins for a skill at any point. The only tedious thing was getting enough.

Each challenge the pair completed, brought Will‚Äôs mind more at ease. Soon enough he had obtained enough money to extend his time loop for half a week. Buying skills was out of the question. Both the temporary and permanent available weren‚Äôt particularly useful right now, and the ones that were, exceeded his price range by a factor of twenty.

Gradually, loops became a routine once more. Every loop, Will would start his prediction, then check the map for suitable open and hidden challenges and go fetch Luke. The enchanter was growing steadily, requiring fewer and fewer repetitions. The relationship changed from that of mentor and mentee to that of senior and junior partner. With a three-level boost, Luke only had to kill one wolf pack before they could set off on the real fights.

Every ten-fifteen loops, an unexpected bonus would emerge. The bonuses of the challenge reward would include a unique option to gain a class token, which eternity saw no need to convert into coins. Thus, Will had permanently boosted his archer to level three.

‚ÄúThis again?‚Äù Luke sighed as they sat in the familiar coffee shop.

It was clear that he didn‚Äôt enjoy it particularly. His restlessness reminded Will of his first few loops.

‚ÄúRest is good,‚Äù he replied, taking his chocolate croissant.

‚ÄúYeah, but does it have to be here?‚Äù

Accustomed to the reality of loops, the enchanter didn‚Äôt bother being nice or polite. Being the type of person that spoke his mind, he didn‚Äôt give much of a damn what other people thought, especially loopless.

‚ÄúOkay, we‚Äôll take a walk. Have change?‚Äù

Luke shook his head, then handed Will a twenty-dollar bill. The cash made the barista more than understanding. Having worked in the service sector for years, he had seen all sorts of things. In his view, any day that he got paid was a good day. Everything else was merely a difference of opinion.

‚ÄúYou must slack off more,‚Äù Will said as the pair walked aimlessly along the street. The new version of the pastry he had taken had a slight orange tang, making it much better than the plain chocolate one he had tried before.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs funny coming from you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll crash if you go too far. Eternity isn‚Äôt a nice place for that.‚Äù

‚ÄúTalking from experience?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù Will preferred not to go into details.

What he really wanted was to tell Luke to treat loopless better. Doing so, though, would open him to philosophical arguments concerning challenges. By now the enchanter had figured out that they were venturing into other realities, acting very much like the chaotic invaders the goblins had been at the end of the tutorial. Good and evil were getting more and more difficult to define when dealing with anything temporary, or permanent for that matter. Killing off a participant merely ended the loop, resulting in time lost. Only a permakill resulted in any consequences, which, ironically, was the very reason Will had rewound so many loops to begin with.

‚ÄúListen, Luke. The thing‚Äî‚Äù

Will had barely begun when he saw a glint in the distance. In a city this size, it could have been caused by a great number of things. Yet, after going on challenges for so long, he knew exactly what it was.

In a fraction of a second, Will drew the bow from his mirror fragment, then shot an arrow in the direction of the glint.

Ten feet away, two arrows crashed into each other. The impact wasn‚Äôt precise, so neither of them splintered, but it was enough to veer each of them off course.

Luke threw a handful of coins in front of him, instantly creating a small swarm of scarabs.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt!‚Äù Will shouted even as he had readied another arrow. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt help.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are we against?‚Äù The enchanter looked around, trying to pinpoint the location of their attacker.

‚ÄúYour sister.‚Äù

Will had been avoiding this moment for quite a while. Finally, it had caught up to him.

I'm not talking about the cheap foam kind you get at the drugstore. Think leather, maybe with some understated embellishments, or even a sleek platform. Paired with the right outfit‚Äîa breezy linen dress or tailored shorts and a button-down‚Äîthey can project a relaxed, effortless cool, especially in hotter climates.Of course, context is key. You wouldn't wear them too a business meeting or a fancy restaurant. But for a casual brunch, exploring a new neighborhood, or grabbing coffee? I think it can work. There's a whole spectrum between stilettos and beat-up sandals, and I think a well-chosen pair of flip-flops can occupy a chic, agreeable middle ground. What do you think? Am I entirely off base, or is there some potential for flip-flops to be elevated beyond their typical casual connotations? What are your personal ""rules"" about flip-flop appropriateness?",1,1754331373.0,UrbanChicGuysA,0,1.0,False

I am curious if anybody here has had nontypical side effects from IVF meds that stuck around for a while.  Maybe none of my situations have to do with IVF meds, but they seem to line up perfectly with timing.

I've had two egg retrievals and two canceled transfers in about 8 months.  I'm a low responder.  

I'm going to preface this by saying I'm not pregnant.

I don't like iced coffee anymore.  It is too bitter.  This has lasted since around the spring.  I don't drink iced coffee in the winter, just the summer.  

I also get styes in my eye that I think I can connect back to estrogen pills.

I've also noticed my hair is falling out a ton more in the shower.  Not an alarming amount, but definitely noticeable.  ",4,1754331355.0,IVF,2,1.0,False
