1kc1w8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1kc1w8e/the_evil_entity_in_my_room/,The evil entity in my room,"I would like to share my story with you about the time I saw an evil entity in my room.  This was back in August of 2014 while I was dealing with a tough transition in my life. This happened in the middle of the night, but I'm going to tell the story of that whole day so that you can better understand why it's all so crazy, as if seeing an evil entity isn't crazy enough.
So that day in August of 2014, I had been 4 months into a recovery program healing from an addiction, that I am still free of to this day! Anyway, during my time at the program I got warnings for talking during work. During the day we worked in a warehouse that distributed donations to a big chain thrift store. During my shift that day, I got caught talking to a male resident which was a huge no-no at this program. So because I got in trouble for the third or fourth time, I got kicked out of the program. They opened the back door and out I went, no cell phone or money (we pretty much worked for snacks). I went into a liquor store and asked to use the phone, where I made plans to have my step dad pick me up from the train station. I waited there for about four hours since I had to wait until he was done with what he already had planned, giving me plenty of time to think on my life decisions and what to do next. He finally arrived, unhappy with me as expected. I sat in what would be my new room for the next couple of months feeling defeated and exhausted. It finally came time to get some rest and I fell asleep quickly. I started to dream that I was in this place I loved as a child called Color Me Mine, but it was also a coffee shop. I sat at a table with no coffee or clay to paint, just sitting there noticing that it was only me and a middle aged woman who was working there. She was sweeping the floor and suddenly stopped and said ""So *Sara*
, what are you going to do now that you got kicked out of treatment""? Even though this was a dream, I remember feeling shocked that she knew my name and such personal information. As I was thinking about how to answer her question, there was suddenly a deafening scream. The scream wasn't of terror, it was of pure anger. The woman was just looking at me with no expression on her face while this scream was happening around us. It terrified me so badly I woke up, but I was still hearing the scream. It faded out and I was waiting for one of my parents to come to my room and ask what the hell that was about, but they never did. Just as quickly as the scream faded, I felt a presence to the left of my bed. Standing there in front of the window, there was this entity. It looked like an angry, sickly and demonic old woman. She was staring daggers at me and her mouth was open as if she were snarling. I was awake at this point. To this day I still know I was awake. I looked right back at her and started praying. Since I had come out of a Christian-based program, it was all I could think of to do. She slowly faded away, and as she was her expression softened but was still full of hatred. Then she was just gone. I sat there, looking around my room. I'm not sure why, but I didn't feel scared after that. I laid back down and went back to sleep.
The next morning, I was making coffee with my mom and telling her about what I had experienced. She tried to tell me it was all a dream, even though I thought I was awake after sitting up from hearing that scream that I'll never forget, she was sure the whole thing was a dream, not just the part up until the scream woke me up. I know that at that moment I sat up, still hearing that scream I was awake. I heard that scream still happening when I sat up right before I saw that evil thing. It's been over ten years and I have never and will never forget it.
Sometimes I think that entity was angry because I was still determined to fight and better my life. I felt like the anger and hatred it gave off was because it wanted me to give up and suffer. I chose to fight and I'm now living an amazing life.",1,1746080028.0,Ghoststories,0,1.0,False

Hey fam! You ever find yourself sitting at your desk, staring blankly at a screen like it’s trying to teleport you to another dimension? I mean, we’ve all been there, right? 😅 One minute you're all set to crush that to-do list, and the next? You’re deep into a Wikipedia wormhole about the mating habits of penguins. 

So, here’s **my ultimate focus hack**: **Time Blocking**. Yeah, I know. It sounds fancy, but hear me out! It’s like giving your tasks their own little VIP time slots. 

Here's how it goes down:

1. **Pick a Task**: Choose one major project or task. Let’s say it’s “Drafting a report” or “Planning that epic birthday party.” 
   
2. **Set a Timer**: Grab your favorite timer (I always go for 25 minutes). Set it, and for that time, you do *nothing* but focus solely on that task. 

3. **Take a Break**: When the timer goes off, take a quick 5-minute breather. Seriously – make coffee, do a victory dance, scroll social media – whatever floats your boat!

4. **Repeat**: After a couple of rounds, reward yourself with a longer break (like 15-30 minutes). Trust me; it makes the grind way more bearable!

Why does this work so well? 🤔

- **Reduces Overwhelm**: Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.
- **Creates Urgency**: That ticking timer gives you a mini adrenaline rush. Who doesn’t love a challenge?
- **Promotes a Balanced Work Rhythm**: With breaks, you’re less likely to feel burnt out or trapped in a focus fog.

A quick personal story: The first time I tried this, I was tackling a presentation I dreaded. Instead of dragging it out over days, I committed to just two focused hours. What do you know? I ended up wrapping it up quicker than expected! 🎉

If you’re like me and struggle with staying focused (curse you, endless distractions!), give this a shot. You might even find yourself zipping through your tasks like a productivity ninja!

1kc1rvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/tonsilstones/comments/1kc1rvc/the_link_between_oxalates_and_tonsil_stones/,The link between Oxalates and Tonsil stones,"I’ve been suffering from tonsil stones for 20 years and it’s impacting my life in ways only people here can understand. I have observed that the quantity of stones fluctuates from time to time. Sometimes it’s chronic and sometimes it’s tolerable.

I just recently learned that a diet high in oxalates may be the reason why our body is creating tonsil stones. I wonder if inadvertent dietary shifts to higher oxalate foods were the trigger? 

According to Sally Norton who wrote “Toxic Superfoods”, oxalates bind with calcium to create calcium oxalate stones that get deposited all over the body including the tonsils and kidneys. 

Do you eat a lot of?

Spinach
Almonds/almond beverages
Cashews
Sweet potatoes
Chocolate /chocolate beverages
Green tea
Beets/beet juice 
Nuts
Mocha coffees
Brownies 
Cake 

This may be the reason. Incidentally, if you suffer from gout, that may be why. It’s important that we stay well-hydrated too as doing so helps flush oxalates from the body. 

As of this week, I’ve drastically reduced the amount of oxalates in my diet and will report back in a couple of weeks in a new thread. 

TLDR: I have started a very low oxalate diet to see if there’s a relationship between tonsil stones and oxalates. High oxalate foods can create stones in our bodies.

1kc1p8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/YahLahBut/comments/1kc1p8x/pap_the_ultimate_capitalist_in_singapore/,PAP - The Ultimate Capitalist in Singapore,"Edit: If you find this useful, please assist me in posting on [r/singapore](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/) as my karma is not high enough. Also share it on other spaces and people as well. Thanks!

As you all know, the PAP recently increased the GST from 7% to 9%. However, that’s not the only way the PAP profits from ordinary Singaporeans. You would have noticed that the prices of all goods and services have increased over the years, far beyond 2%. Because rental costs for these businesses have been rising steadily. And the PAP government has consistently earned a huge profit by having a monopoly on Singapore's most precious resource: Land.

In 1966, the Land Acquisition Act was introduced, which allows the Singapore government to forcibly acquire private land at below-market prices. The government currently owns approximately 90% of all the land, giving it a de facto monopoly. 

The government, through the SLA, then sells land leases, usually between 30 to 99 years. This makes the land in Singapore a renewable resource for the Singapore Government. After the leases expire, the land will be automatically returned to the government to be sold again. Therefore, one could argue that land in a tiny city state like Singapore is an extremely valuable asset, possibly even more valuable than natural resources like gold or oil. 

Private developers such as REITs would buy these land leases and develop the land by building shopping malls, condominiums, offices, factories and more. They will then generate profits by renting out these properties to be used by the businesses that provide you with goods and services. So whenever you buy something or pay for a service, you are indirectly paying for the cost of land leases sold by the Singapore government. And because land prices have been increasing over the years, the cost of rental has also increased which causes the price of your goods and services to increase as well. 

The government has substantial ownership in many of these REITs through their sovereign wealth fund, Temasek Holdings (I.e Mapletree, Capitaland). So the government is basically double dipping, profiting not only from the sale of land leases, but also from the dividends of the REITs! To top it all off, GST is then levied on all the goods and services provided. 

The profiting comes from residential and public housing as well. When you buy a BTO flat from HDB, you are paying for both the construction cost and land cost. HDB buys land leases from SLA at what they consider a “Fair Market Value”. Of course, as land prices have been increasing over the years, this “Fair Market Value” has increased as well. Remember, the government acquired this land a long time ago for a rock bottom price. And now they sell it to us for a profit at what they consider Market Value. This is one of the reasons why property prices have been skyrocketing 

In short, everything that you do is on land leased from the government which profit off you not just once, but at multiple levels.

And that’s not all. The PAP also has a direct or indirect stake in many essential sectors: utilities (SP Group), telecommunications (Singtel), airlines (SIA), offshore and marine businesses (Keppel, Seatrium), and more, largely through Temasek Holdings. Through its political ties with NTUC, it also has influence over key supermarket (NTUC FairPrice) and insurance (Income Insurance) players. Unlike most capitalist countries, which mainly rely on taxes for revenue, Singapore has built a system where the state profits through widespread land ownership and Government-Linked Companies.

Despite being in a much better fiscal position than before the COVID-19 pandemic, the PAP still has the gall to increase the GST from 7% to 9% during a period of heightened inflation and rising cost of living. They claim that they need the money in order to save up for a “rainy day” in the future. But they seem to have forgotten about the “today”. What about the elderly poor who have to pick up cardboard just to make a living, or dishwashing and cleaning the hawker centers and coffee shops. 

Looking at how the PAP runs Singapore, it seems as though they are not running a country but a monopolistic corporation where the aim appears to be market dominance: driving out competition, consolidating control, and ultimately raising the cost of the product. Instead of the Republic of Singapore, we have become Singapore Inc. A profit driven, monopolistic conglomerate where the senior executives draw an exorbitant salary while ordinary workers bear the burden of stagnant wages, rising costs and systemic inequality.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not against the Land Acquisition Act or building up a strong national reserve to protect ourselves during crises. What I take issue with is the hoarding of these fiscal resources under the guise of prudence with much of the wealth distributed amongst the ministers, senior civil servants and those connected with the establishment. 

Elections are just around the corner. Please don’t be fooled by the PAP’s election carrots, their fear mongering of Singapore collapsing if the opposition is voted in or their constant nostalgic reminders of the achievements of the 1st generation PAP. I advise all Singaporeans to vote wisely.",0,1746079242.0,YahLahBut,0,0.4,False

I just wanted to share something that’s been weighing on me lately. First, I want to apologize if the title came off the wrong way or offended anyone—truly not my intention. I’m not here to promote or reveal my business name, and nothing in this post links back to it. I just want to vent a little and connect with others who might be feeling the same way.

I’ve been running a small lip gloss business for about two years now. Back in 2020, when these kinds of businesses weren’t as common, it felt fresh and exciting. But now, the market is so saturated that it feels like the only time people buy from me is during a sale, or when someone genuinely connects with what I offer. And while I’m grateful for those moments, it's been tough.

I’ve tried different methods of marketing, but no matter how many new releases I put out or how much time I spend creating and promoting, I still feel invisible. There’s been a lot of inconsistency on my end too—honestly, I’ve struggled with motivation and have gone on and off posting for the past few months. I totally understand that’s likely why I’m not as popular as other businesses right now.

People will sometimes watch my live streams or check out my posts, but most just scroll past because I’m not a “known” brand. It’s discouraging, and honestly, it’s made me question if I should be doing something else.

Lately, I’ve been daydreaming about starting a coffee cart. I love iced coffee, and the idea of having my own café someday really excites me. God willing, I’d love to make that dream happen. I’m even considering investing in a cart and getting licensed, just to start small. I wouldn't shut down my lip gloss business completely—I’ve put two years of work into it—but I need something that makes me feel alive again.

I’ve had over 68 sales through TikTok and Etsy, which I know is something to be proud of. But the truth is, people don’t seem as excited to support me unless there’s a discount involved, and that hurts. I just want to feel like all the effort means something, beyond a sale.

I’m not sharing this to receive pity—I just really need guidance and advice, because I honestly don’t know what to do. I’m not trying to promote myself at all here, just looking for some honest feedback from people who understand the struggles of entrepreneurship.

If anyone else out there is going through a similar phase—whether you're in beauty, crafts, food, or anything else—I’d love to hear your thoughts. This isn’t a promotion, I promise. Just a fellow entrepreneur venting to people who might understand.",1,1746078984.0,Entrepreneur,1,1.0,False

*Her Side*				

Three years, minus thirteen days—it lasted. The breakup took approximately six months, but the end was surprisingly short. A simple, “I can’t do this anymore.”

I was immediately transported back to college, listening to the words of my communications professor talk about disillusionment—how there’s a moment when what you once knew becomes completely unfamiliar, and you suddenly see everything differently.

Being visual, I imagined the world draining of color, like a slow melt. Everything pulling away into a black-and-white existence.

And in that moment, I guess it did. I stood frozen, knowing the next words would change everything. Sitting in the in-between.

All I could say was, “What?”He repeated it: “I can’t do this anymore.”Then again: “I don’t want to do this anymore.”

I asked, “You want to break up?”

He said yes.

I told him to say it—as if I needed the words to harden into concrete, to solidify it in my mind. “Tell me you want to break up.”

He said, “I want to break up.”

A levee broke.

“Tell me you don’t love me anymore,” I said, standing while he sat on the edge of the hotel bed. I kept thinking housekeeping was going to interrupt this moment—barge in and stop the horror from unfolding.

We had just checked out of the hotel. A week-long vacation. Our first real trip together.

“I can’t say that,” he explained.

Hell broke loose. Several responses bubbled to the surface, my body flipping between fight or flight—do I fight for this, or do I leave it?

Pillars in my mind began crashing down. I flashed back to my last ex—how painful it was to rip myself away from him—but this went deeper. He was never a real option. He didn’t see me.

But this man in front of me—we’d shared too much. Love. Tragedy. He’d seen me at my worst, knew my best. He supported me. We shared a home, dogs, memories I never thought I’d build with anyone. Not like this. Not this close.

And then, one by one, the fantasies collapsed:

The wedding.The babies.Growing old.The future—gone.

All I could say was, “Okay.”Alarm bells ringing, body tense, I picked up my bags and loaded them into the car.

The drive home passed in tears, swinging between frantic problem-solving—*Where will I live? We live together,  I need a car; we share one*—and quietly hoping that somewhere in those five hours, he’d change his mind

We stepped into our place, greeted by our dogs.Ours.I should probably stop saying that.

There was so much to figure out, and I was tired. We barely spoke as we headed upstairs. Before disappearing down the hall, he said quietly, “I’ll sleep in the guest room.”

Another nail in the coffin.He was done.

I didn’t say a word. Just turned and walked to our—I mean, *my*—bedroom.

The days that followed weren’t explosive. They were quiet. Almost gentle.But heavy. So, so heavy.

We moved through the house like ghosts of the people we were. Polite. Predictable. Practical.He still made coffee in the morning. I still folded laundry.We still went to the gym together. Talked about our work days.If someone had seen us from the outside, they wouldn’t have known.Sometimes, it felt like *I* didn’t even know.

But every night reminded me.The silence of my bedroom.The echo of space beside me.The way I’d cry into my pillow until my chest hurt, and sometimes crawl into his bed—not for sex, just… contact. Familiarity. Something like safety.

He never told me to leave.But he never pulled me close, either.

Then came the dinner.*Aphanisis.*A small Greek spot tucked into Georgetown.

The last time we were there, we played pinball all night after splitting souvlaki and laughing over cheap red wine. It had been one of my favorite memories with him. Back when we still thought there were decades ahead of us.

I almost didn’t go. But he wanted to. Said he’d already made the reservation. Said he still wanted to celebrate “what we had.”

That morning, he handed me a small black box—Gucci. He knew I loved Gucci. And his love language was always gift-giving. It was how he said things he couldn’t put into words.

The earrings were beautiful. Delicate. My taste exactly . It was like being handed a breakup wrapped in care. Like he was saying goodbye in his language.

So I curled my hair, put on the dress he liked, and headed to the restaurant. 

And somehow, everything felt natural.Too natural.

He was dressed in his anniversary suit, and I caught my breath when I saw him.The jacket was mostly deep blue and gold, covered in embroidered flowers and snakes—bold, bright colors that somehow worked together: deep reds, greens, flashes of something mythic and loud. It was a statement piece. He’d bought it for our first anniversary and dubbed it the *anniversary jacket*, the only change being he had it tailored to fit him perfectly.

He was so proud of that jacket. He’d never been able to afford something like it until later in life. We actually bonded over that—stories of struggling that started in laughter and ended in truth:

“I used to get food from the food bank.”“I used to overdraft my account just to get gas.”“I lived off payday loans.”“I’d buy a Costco pizza to stretch through a whole weekend.”

“I sometimes pawned my laptop.”“I used to eat ramen every meal for weeks.”“I stayed with my abusive ex because he fed me.”“I got comfortable being hungry… so it’s hard to feel full now.”

That jacket wasn’t just clothing. It was survival made beautiful. A symbol that we made it out. A piece of his pride—and now, a piece of our story I’d have to let go of, too.

I sat down, staring into his green-blue eyes.He smiled the way he always did. Looked at me the way he always had—with love.

We ordered the exact same thing we had last time, down to the baked whole cauliflower. The “candied persimmons were out of this world,” he said, just like before.

We sat in the corner, knee to knee. Each brush of skin against skin lit me up. Every small touch felt like a ghost of what we used to be. I kept thinking about all the lasts—the last kiss, the last fuck, the last *I love you*, the last real connection.

Our last kiss. I always thought about that. Even from the beginning. From our first kiss, I was already thinking about the last.

Not in a dramatic way—more like a quiet curiosity. I remember doing that with my first boyfriend, too. Sitting there after our very first kiss, wondering *how* it would end. Not *if*. Just… what would be the thing that finally undid us?

Nothing in my life ever felt permanent.If you asked my childhood therapist, she’d probably ramble on about how my inability to fully feel happy came from the constant, instinctual bracing for the other shoe to drop.And no matter how loud I screamed, it wouldn’t, it always did.

Therapist after therapist told me I might be manifesting this. Or, in more clinical terms: self-sabotaging.

Which, if you zoom out far enough, starts to look a lot like predicting the truth before it has the chance to become real.

But I am no medical professional—who am I to speak on such things?

We talked in memories, as we usually did. “You remember…?” “Oh my God, I can’t believe what so-and-so said on Instagram.” “Jeff at work is completely out of line.”

Surface stuff. Familiar stuff. We slipped back into it like muscle memory.

“You know how many times I said I would circle back this week?” I asked, laughing as I sipped my wine.

He smiled, nodded. We both knew the language of burnout. The performance of being fine.

But beneath the easy rhythm, something else buzzed—quiet but insistent. This was the same banter we’d always had, but now it felt like quoting lines from a favorite movie we’d both outgrown.

And yet, I kept leaning in.Kept letting my knees brush his.Kept laughing at his dumb jokes, the way I always had.

Because some part of me—small, stubborn, still aching—wanted to believe that if we talked like we used to, maybe we weren’t ending.

Maybe we were remembering how to begin.

Or maybe I was just remembering how much I missed being seen.

I watched him swirl his wine. The curve of his wrist. The way he always smelled faintly of Dove Men’s body wash and that musky cologne he’d worn for years—cheap, probably, but it worked for him. Familiar. Steady.

His hands rested on the table, fingers tapping in a pattern only he understood.The same fingers that had words tattooed across them, small and black, fading in places. I used to trace those letters while we watched TV. Sometimes during sex. Sometimes just because I could.

He caught me staring and smiled. That slow, lopsided one that made me feel like home.

I smiled back, reflexively, even though my chest ached.

And then, like muscle memory of another kind, the real memories flooded in.

The night I had my first panic attack it out of nowhere—in the kitchen, barefoot on the tile, and suddenly everything was closing in. My breath caught in my throat, my heart galloping toward something I couldn’t name. I slid down the cabinet, knees drawn in, hands shaking.

He found me like that.Didn’t panic. Didn’t talk too much.He just sank down next to me, knees pressed to mine, and matched my breathing.One hand on my back. One on my knee.No fixing. No fear. Just—*there.*And I remember thinking, *This is what love feels like.*Not a rescue, not a solution. Just stillness. Just staying.

I reached across the table and rested my hand on his thigh.Just a simple gesture—automatic, familiar.

But the second my fingers landed, I remembered.That night in bed, his voice low in the dark as he told me his father used to pinch him there. Hard. Where no one could see. Pinch him so it would hurt and bruise.

 That was the first time I ever saw him cry. And he let me hold him.

The memory hit like breath against glass—sudden, quiet, and a little shattering.

I didn’t pull away. Just softened my touch.Let it mean what it used to.*I remember. I see you. I still care where it hurt.*

He looked at me—not startled, just... still like he felt it, too like part of him knew exactly what I was saying without saying it,

We had always been gentle with each other’s wounds.and another part didn’t know how to hold it anymore.

Now, he was still smiling across the table. Still wearing the anniversary jacket. Still holding the shape of who he had been to me, and who I had been to him.

But I knew, deep down, even if I didn’t want to:

We were no longer reaching for each other.

We were remembering how it felt to be held.

And it wasn’t the same.

He moved out of the state.And I moved on—to a new love.He’s kind. Steady.But it’s not the same.

Not because he isn’t good to me.But because I never gave myself to someone that way again.Not as fully.Not without armor.

Still, every now and then—when I pass a Greek restaurant, or hear the sound of pinball—I think about that night.The way he smiled like it didn’t hurt.The way I touched his thigh, hoping he’d remember.

And maybe he did.But neither of us said it.

*Almost.*

  


			

  
  
  
  
  




  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


His Side

I think I started letting go on Valentine’s Day. We were sitting in the living room when I said, “You’re like a muted version of yourself on medication.” I still hate that I said it out loud. Not because it wasn’t honest—but because I knew how much it hurt. She was doing the work. She was trying to feel better. And I made it sound like she was disappearing.

We didn’t break up that night.But something cracked between us.I think a part of her stopped trusting me.And a part of me realized I wasn’t brave enough to leave yet.

Later that night, I told her I’d been thinking about breaking up for two years.That wasn’t the full truth.I’d been hurting for two years.Wrestling with something I couldn’t name.She was everything to me—but I didn’t feel like myself anymore.

Then we went on that trip.We were mostly okay.Trying.There were moments where it felt like we were finding each other again.But when she asked about therapy, it slipped out of me.Not gently. Not with care. Just—“I can’t do this anymore.”

I said it fast, like it had been waiting too long in my mouth.She froze.And I wanted to take it back the second it landed.Not because I didn’t mean it, but because of the way it broke her face open.She asked me to say it again.“Tell me you want to break up.”And I did.

Because I owed her the truth, even if I didn’t know how to carry it well.

When she cried, something inside me cracked wide open.This was the person who had loved me harder than anyone else ever had.Who stood by me. Fought for me.And I couldn’t fight back anymore.

I still loved her.Even as I let her go.Even as we drove back in silence—five hours and some change—The car full of everything we weren’t saying.

But losing someone who sees you?That doesn’t fade easy.Not when you know what it meant.Not when you remember what it felt like to be held that way—Fully. Without question.

After I said it, things didn’t explode.They just… settled.Heavy. Quiet. Still.

She didn’t leave right away.She couldn’t—not yet.And I didn’t ask her to.We kept living there.Two people trying to unlearn each other in a house built for “forever.”

Some nights, I heard her cry through the wall.Some nights, she crawled into my bed.She never said much.Didn’t ask for anything.Just curled into me like habit. Like memory.And I let her.

Not because I thought we’d get back together—But because I didn’t know how to say no to someone I still loved.Even if I didn’t want to stay.

We still went to the gym together.Still took turns making coffee.Still smiled for the neighbors.

From the outside, I’m sure we looked fine.But I was grieving her.Grieving us.Quietly. Daily.

I kept telling myself it was better this way.That she’d grow.That this version of me—this chapter—would fade into the background,Like a song she used to love.

But every time she walked through the door,Every time she laughed that laugh that only I really understood,I felt it.The ache of being loved like that.And the weight of choosing to let it go.

So when I asked if she still wanted to go to Aphanisis for our anniversary,I told myself it was just closure. One soft goodbye.

But deep down?I wanted to see her one more time—Not as my ex.Not as someone I’d hurt.Just as her.

I thought back to the first birthday we spent together.We went to the Gucci store, and I told her, “Pick anything.”The stories—of pawning laptops, of living off Costco pizza, of no power—They flickered across her face.We both came from nothing.That gift felt like something I could give her.A small piece of the life she deserved.

So when our not-anniversary came around,I found the earrings she once pointed out—offhand, in passing—And bought them.It wasn’t to fix anything.It was just something I could still give her.

She looked good.Wearing the black dress with the sleeves and the pink heels I always loved.And for a second, it didn’t feel like we were broken .It felt like just another night out.

She laughed at something dumb I said.Her knee brushed mine. It felt easy.And that scared me more than anything.

There were nights I’d test us.Not on purpose. Not maliciously.Just small things.To see if we still worked.Like nacho night.We were cooking dinner together.I said, “Let’s see if we can make these without one of us losing it.”She laughed. Thought I was joking.But I wasn’t—Not completely.

It was a dumb little test.Because if you can agree on the toppings,Maybe you can agree on the hard stuff too.How to compromise.How to not turn every small thing into a quiet war.That night, the nachos were a wreck.Cheese pooled in one corner, chips burned at the edges.But she laughed—big, open, unfiltered.And I remember thinking,Okay. Maybe we make a good team after all.

I think about that night in the kitchen sometimes.And then I think about that dinner at Aphanisis.The way her hand grazed mine when she reached for her glass.The way she touched my thigh—The place I once told her my father used to pinch me.Hard. Where no one could see.I felt it like a wave.

Not the touch—the memory.And I didn’t flinch.But I didn’t know how to hold it either.

I wanted to say something to reach back to to  tell her I still loved her.And I did.But not enough.Not in the way it would’ve taken to stay.

So I smiled.Laughed at another story.Split dessert. And when the check came, I paid, like I always did. Gave her a soft hug outside. Said, “This was nice.”

And we skipped the pinball. Skipped the pretending.

And I walked away from the only person who ever made me feel like I didn’t have to earn love to deserve it.

She moved on.And I moved out of the state.Different cities. Different lives.But some nights, when it’s too quiet,I still think about that dinner.The soft hug.The touch on my thigh.The way we almost said what we meant.

*Almost.*

Mom cried this morning, said she can’t believe her little boy finished high school.
I’m thinking about applying for journalism college. Maybe write science fiction stories. Or who knows, maybe one day even act in Hollywood — I’ve always liked voices, and pretending I’m from other worlds.

Anyway. It’s Christmas Eve, and while everything around me smells like cinnamon and hope, I can’t stop thinking about someone who probably isn’t having such a warm night: Biff Tannen.

Everyone knows Biff. He pushes people, cheats on tests, makes life harder than it has to be.
But I’ve been thinking — maybe Biff didn’t start out that way.

They say his mom left for the city when he was just a baby. His dad disappeared not long after — “went out for cigarettes and never came back.” So Biff was raised by his grandmother. Gertrude Tannen.
If you’ve ever walked by her house, you’ve seen the “NO TRESPASSING” signs. Heard her yelling from inside. No music, no laughter. Just warnings and rules.

And that got me wondering:
Are we born bad? Or do we become what the world makes us?

I read once — in a sci-fi magazine — about genetic memory. That maybe anger and fear can be passed on through DNA like eye color. Maybe there’s something in the Tannen bloodline, a kind of leftover heat from Buford “Mad Dog” himself.

But honestly? I don’t buy that. Not fully.
Because if I had grown up in that house… with those mornings… those silences… those eyes watching me like a mistake waiting to happen…
Maybe I’d be Biff.

I had parents who hugged me. Who asked me what I dreamed about.
Biff had beans. And burnt toast. And black coffee at 6:40am. And a stare that made him feel small.

So maybe it’s not the genes. Maybe it’s the environment — the echo chamber of cold kitchens, closed doors, and no one to say “I believe in you.”

I changed this year.
A stranger — a forastero, someone who just appeared like in a Ray Bradbury story — showed me what I could be. Taught me that I could break the cycle. That I didn’t have to be the scared version of myself anymore. And once I saw that, I couldn’t unsee it.

Maybe Biff needs that moment too. That someone.
Maybe someday, someone will help him see he can choose another path.
I really hope he does.

Because no one should grow up thinking the world owes them something, just because they never got anything real.

Anyway. Merry Christmas to whoever finds this someday.
Maybe I’ll be writing this kind of thing in magazines one day. Or acting in movies about time travel.
For now, I’m just George. And I really do wish Biff Tannen well.

  **The Last Anniversary** 

*Her Side*				

Three years, minus thirteen days—it lasted. The breakup took approximately six months, but the end was surprisingly short. A simple, “I can’t do this anymore.”

I was immediately transported back to college, listening to the words of my communications professor talk about disillusionment—how there’s a moment when what you once knew becomes completely unfamiliar, and you suddenly see everything differently.

Being visual, I imagined the world draining of color, like a slow melt. Everything pulling away into a black-and-white existence.

And in that moment, I guess it did. I stood frozen, knowing the next words would change everything. Sitting in the in-between.

All I could say was, “What?”He repeated it: “I can’t do this anymore.”Then again: “I don’t want to do this anymore.”

I asked, “You want to break up?”

He said yes.

I told him to say it—as if I needed the words to harden into concrete, to solidify it in my mind. “Tell me you want to break up.”

He said, “I want to break up.”

A levee broke.

“Tell me you don’t love me anymore,” I said, standing while he sat on the edge of the hotel bed. I kept thinking housekeeping was going to interrupt this moment—barge in and stop the horror from unfolding.

We had just checked out of the hotel. A week-long vacation. Our first real trip together.

“I can’t say that,” he explained.

Hell broke loose. Several responses bubbled to the surface, my body flipping between fight or flight—do I fight for this, or do I leave it?

Pillars in my mind began crashing down. I flashed back to my last ex—how painful it was to rip myself away from him—but this went deeper. He was never a real option. He didn’t see me.

But this man in front of me—we’d shared too much. Love. Tragedy. He’d seen me at my worst, knew my best. He supported me. We shared a home, dogs, memories I never thought I’d build with anyone. Not like this. Not this close.

And then, one by one, the fantasies collapsed:

The wedding.The babies.Growing old.The future—gone.

All I could say was, “Okay.”Alarm bells ringing, body tense, I picked up my bags and loaded them into the car.

The drive home passed in tears, swinging between frantic problem-solving—*Where will I live? We live together,  I need a car; we share one*—and quietly hoping that somewhere in those five hours, he’d change his mind

We stepped into our place, greeted by our dogs.Ours.I should probably stop saying that.

There was so much to figure out, and I was tired. We barely spoke as we headed upstairs. Before disappearing down the hall, he said quietly, “I’ll sleep in the guest room.”

Another nail in the coffin.He was done.

I didn’t say a word. Just turned and walked to our—I mean, *my*—bedroom.

The days that followed weren’t explosive. They were quiet. Almost gentle.But heavy. So, so heavy.

We moved through the house like ghosts of the people we were. Polite. Predictable. Practical.He still made coffee in the morning. I still folded laundry.We still went to the gym together. Talked about our work days.If someone had seen us from the outside, they wouldn’t have known.Sometimes, it felt like *I* didn’t even know.

But every night reminded me.The silence of my bedroom.The echo of space beside me.The way I’d cry into my pillow until my chest hurt, and sometimes crawl into his bed—not for sex, just… contact. Familiarity. Something like safety.

He never told me to leave.But he never pulled me close, either.

Then came the dinner.*Aphanisis.*A small Greek spot tucked into Georgetown.

The last time we were there, we played pinball all night after splitting souvlaki and laughing over cheap red wine. It had been one of my favorite memories with him. Back when we still thought there were decades ahead of us.

I almost didn’t go. But he wanted to. Said he’d already made the reservation. Said he still wanted to celebrate “what we had.”

That morning, he handed me a small black box—Gucci. He knew I loved Gucci. And his love language was always gift-giving. It was how he said things he couldn’t put into words.

So I curled my hair, put on the dress he liked, and headed to the restaurant. 

And somehow, everything felt natural.Too natural.

He was dressed in his anniversary suit, and I caught my breath when I saw him.The jacket was mostly deep blue and gold, covered in embroidered flowers and snakes—bold, bright colors that somehow worked together: deep reds, greens, flashes of something mythic and loud. It was a statement piece. He’d bought it for our first anniversary and dubbed it the *anniversary jacket*, the only change being he had it tailored to fit him perfectly.

He was so proud of that jacket. He’d never been able to afford something like it until later in life. We actually bonded over that—stories of struggling that started in laughter and ended in truth:

“I used to get food from the food bank.”“I used to overdraft my account just to get gas.”“I lived off payday loans.”“I’d buy a Costco pizza to stretch through a whole weekend.”

“I sometimes pawned my laptop.”“I used to eat ramen every meal for weeks.”“I stayed with my abusive ex because he fed me.”“I got comfortable being hungry… so it’s hard to feel full now.”

That jacket wasn’t just clothing. It was survival made beautiful. A symbol that we made it out. A piece of his pride—and now, a piece of our story I’d have to let go of, too.

Later that night, I told her I’d been thinking about breaking up for two years.That wasn’t the full truth.I’d been hurting for two years.Wrestling with something I couldn’t name.She was everything to me—but I didn’t feel like myself anymore.

Then we went on that trip.We were mostly okay.Trying.There were moments where it felt like we were finding each other again.But when she asked about therapy, it slipped out of me.Not gently. Not with care. Just—“I can’t do this anymore.”

I said it fast, like it had been waiting too long in my mouth.She froze.And I wanted to take it back the second it landed.Not because I didn’t mean it, but because of the way it broke her face open.She asked me to say it again.“Tell me you want to break up.”And I did.

Because I owed her the truth, even if I didn’t know how to carry it well.

When she cried, something inside me cracked wide open.This was the person who had loved me harder than anyone else ever had.Who stood by me. Fought for me.And I couldn’t fight back anymore.

I still loved her.Even as I let her go.Even as we drove back in silence—five hours and some change—The car full of everything we weren’t saying.

But losing someone who sees you?That doesn’t fade easy.Not when you know what it meant.Not when you remember what it felt like to be held that way—Fully. Without question.

After I said it, things didn’t explode.They just… settled.Heavy. Quiet. Still.

She didn’t leave right away.She couldn’t—not yet.And I didn’t ask her to.We kept living there.Two people trying to unlearn each other in a house built for “forever.”

Some nights, I heard her cry through the wall.Some nights, she crawled into my bed.She never said much.Didn’t ask for anything.Just curled into me like habit. Like memory.And I let her.

Not because I thought we’d get back together—But because I didn’t know how to say no to someone I still loved.Even if I didn’t want to stay.

We still went to the gym together.Still took turns making coffee.Still smiled for the neighbors.

From the outside, I’m sure we looked fine.But I was grieving her.Grieving us.Quietly. Daily.

I kept telling myself it was better this way.That she’d grow.That this version of me—this chapter—would fade into the background,Like a song she used to love.

But every time she walked through the door,Every time she laughed that laugh that only I really understood,I felt it.The ache of being loved like that.And the weight of choosing to let it go.

So when I asked if she still wanted to go to Aphanisis for our anniversary,I told myself it was just [closure.One](http://closure.One) soft goodbye.

But deep down?I wanted to see her one more time—Not as my ex.Not as someone I’d hurt.Just as her.

I thought back to the first birthday we spent together.We went to the Gucci store, and I told her, “Pick anything.”The stories—of pawning laptops, of living off Costco pizza, of no power—They flickered across her face.We both came from nothing.That gift felt like something I could give her.A small piece of the life she deserved.

So when our not-anniversary came around,I found the earrings she once pointed out—offhand, in passing—And bought them.It wasn’t to fix anything.It was just something I could still give her.

She looked good.Wearing the black dress with the sleeves and the pink heels I always loved.And for a second, it didn’t feel like we were [broken.It](http://broken.It) felt like just another night out.

She laughed at something dumb I said.Her knee brushed [mine.It](http://mine.It) felt easy.And that scared me more than anything.

There were nights I’d test us.Not on purpose. Not maliciously.Just small things.To see if we still worked.Like nacho night.We were cooking dinner together.I said, “Let’s see if we can make these without one of us losing it.”She laughed. Thought I was joking.But I wasn’t—Not completely.

It was a dumb little test.Because if you can agree on the toppings,Maybe you can agree on the hard stuff too.How to compromise.How to not turn every small thing into a quiet war.That night, the nachos were a wreck.Cheese pooled in one corner, chips burned at the edges.But she laughed—big, open, unfiltered.And I remember thinking,Okay. Maybe we make a good team after all.

I think about that night in the kitchen sometimes.And then I think about that dinner at Aphanisis.The way her hand grazed mine when she reached for her glass.The way she touched my thigh—The place I once told her my father used to pinch me.Hard. Where no one could see.I felt it like a wave.

Not the touch—the memory.And I didn’t flinch.But I didn’t know how to hold it either.

I wanted to say [something.To](http://something.To) reach [back.To](http://back.To) tell her I still loved her.And I did.But not enough.Not in the way it would’ve taken to stay.

So I smiled.Laughed at another story.Split dessert. And when the check came, I paid, like I always did. Gave her a soft hug outside. Said, “This was nice.”

And we skipped the pinball. Skipped the pretending.

And I walked away from the only person who ever made me feel like I didn’t have to earn love to deserve it.

She moved on.And I moved out of the state.Different cities. Different lives.But some nights, when it’s too quiet,I still think about that dinner.The soft hug.The touch on my thigh.The way we almost said what we meant.

*Almost.*

*Her Side*				

Three years, minus thirteen days—it lasted. The breakup took approximately six months, but the end was surprisingly short. A simple, “I can’t do this anymore.”

I was immediately transported back to college, listening to the words of my communications professor talk about disillusionment—how there’s a moment when what you once knew becomes completely unfamiliar, and you suddenly see everything differently.

Being visual, I imagined the world draining of color, like a slow melt. Everything pulling away into a black-and-white existence.

And in that moment, I guess it did. I stood frozen, knowing the next words would change everything. Sitting in the in-between.

All I could say was, “What?”He repeated it: “I can’t do this anymore.”Then again: “I don’t want to do this anymore.”

I asked, “You want to break up?”

He said yes.

I told him to say it—as if I needed the words to harden into concrete, to solidify it in my mind. “Tell me you want to break up.”

He said, “I want to break up.”

A levee broke.

“Tell me you don’t love me anymore,” I said, standing while he sat on the edge of the hotel bed. I kept thinking housekeeping was going to interrupt this moment—barge in and stop the horror from unfolding.

We had just checked out of the hotel. A week-long vacation. Our first real trip together.

“I can’t say that,” he explained.

Hell broke loose. Several responses bubbled to the surface, my body flipping between fight or flight—do I fight for this, or do I leave it?

Pillars in my mind began crashing down. I flashed back to my last ex—how painful it was to rip myself away from him—but this went deeper. He was never a real option. He didn’t see me.

But this man in front of me—we’d shared too much. Love. Tragedy. He’d seen me at my worst, knew my best. He supported me. We shared a home, dogs, memories I never thought I’d build with anyone. Not like this. Not this close.

And then, one by one, the fantasies collapsed:

The wedding.The babies.Growing old.The future—gone.

All I could say was, “Okay.”Alarm bells ringing, body tense, I picked up my bags and loaded them into the car.

The drive home passed in tears, swinging between frantic problem-solving—*Where will I live? We live together,  I need a car; we share one*—and quietly hoping that somewhere in those five hours, he’d change his mind

We stepped into our place, greeted by our dogs.Ours.I should probably stop saying that.

There was so much to figure out, and I was tired. We barely spoke as we headed upstairs. Before disappearing down the hall, he said quietly, “I’ll sleep in the guest room.”

Another nail in the coffin.He was done.

I didn’t say a word. Just turned and walked to our—I mean, *my*—bedroom.

The days that followed weren’t explosive. They were quiet. Almost gentle.But heavy. So, so heavy.

We moved through the house like ghosts of the people we were. Polite. Predictable. Practical.He still made coffee in the morning. I still folded laundry.We still went to the gym together. Talked about our work days.If someone had seen us from the outside, they wouldn’t have known.Sometimes, it felt like *I* didn’t even know.

But every night reminded me.The silence of my bedroom.The echo of space beside me.The way I’d cry into my pillow until my chest hurt, and sometimes crawl into his bed—not for sex, just… contact. Familiarity. Something like safety.

He never told me to leave.But he never pulled me close, either.

Then came the dinner.*Aphanisis.*A small Greek spot tucked into Georgetown.

The last time we were there, we played pinball all night after splitting souvlaki and laughing over cheap red wine. It had been one of my favorite memories with him. Back when we still thought there were decades ahead of us.

I almost didn’t go. But he wanted to. Said he’d already made the reservation. Said he still wanted to celebrate “what we had.”

That morning, he handed me a small black box—Gucci. He knew I loved Gucci. And his love language was always gift-giving. It was how he said things he couldn’t put into words.

The earrings were beautiful. Delicate. My taste [exactly.It](http://exactly.It) was like being handed a breakup wrapped in [care.Like](http://care.Like) he was saying goodbye in his language.

So I curled my hair, put on the dress he liked, and headed to the restaurant. 

And somehow, everything felt natural.Too natural.

He was dressed in his anniversary suit, and I caught my breath when I saw him.The jacket was mostly deep blue and gold, covered in embroidered flowers and snakes—bold, bright colors that somehow worked together: deep reds, greens, flashes of something mythic and loud. It was a statement piece. He’d bought it for our first anniversary and dubbed it the *anniversary jacket*, the only change being he had it tailored to fit him perfectly.

He was so proud of that jacket. He’d never been able to afford something like it until later in life. We actually bonded over that—stories of struggling that started in laughter and ended in truth:

“I used to get food from the food bank.”“I used to overdraft my account just to get gas.”“I lived off payday loans.”“I’d buy a Costco pizza to stretch through a whole weekend.”

“I sometimes pawned my laptop.”“I used to eat ramen every meal for weeks.”“I stayed with my abusive ex because he fed me.”“I got comfortable being hungry… so it’s hard to feel full now.”

That jacket wasn’t just clothing. It was survival made beautiful. A symbol that we made it out. A piece of his pride—and now, a piece of our story I’d have to let go of, too.

I sat down, staring into his green-blue eyes.He smiled the way he always did. Looked at me the way he always had—with love.

We ordered the exact same thing we had last time, down to the baked whole cauliflower. The “candied persimmons were out of this world,” he said, just like before.

We sat in the corner, knee to knee. Each brush of skin against skin lit me up. Every small touch felt like a ghost of what we used to be. I kept thinking about all the lasts—the last kiss, the last fuck, the last *I love you*, the last real connection.

Our last kiss. I always thought about that. Even from the beginning. From our first kiss, I was already thinking about the last.

Not in a dramatic way—more like a quiet curiosity. I remember doing that with my first boyfriend, too. Sitting there after our very first kiss, wondering *how* it would end. Not *if*. Just… what would be the thing that finally undid us?

Nothing in my life ever felt permanent.If you asked my childhood therapist, she’d probably ramble on about how my inability to fully feel happy came from the constant, instinctual bracing for the other shoe to drop.And no matter how loud I screamed, it wouldn’t, it always did.

Therapist after therapist told me I might be manifesting this. Or, in more clinical terms: self-sabotaging.

Which, if you zoom out far enough, starts to look a lot like predicting the truth before it has the chance to become real.

But I am no medical professional—who am I to speak on such things?

We talked in memories, as we usually did. “You remember…?” “Oh my God, I can’t believe what so-and-so said on Instagram.” “Jeff at work is completely out of line.”

Surface stuff. Familiar stuff. We slipped back into it like muscle memory.

“You know how many times I said I would circle back this week?” I asked, laughing as I sipped my wine.

He smiled, nodded. We both knew the language of burnout. The performance of being fine.

But beneath the easy rhythm, something else buzzed—quiet but insistent. This was the same banter we’d always had, but now it felt like quoting lines from a favorite movie we’d both outgrown.

And yet, I kept leaning in.Kept letting my knees brush his.Kept laughing at his dumb jokes, the way I always had.

Because some part of me—small, stubborn, still aching—wanted to believe that if we talked like we used to, maybe we weren’t ending.

Maybe we were remembering how to begin.

Or maybe I was just remembering how much I missed being seen.

I watched him swirl his wine. The curve of his wrist. The way he always smelled faintly of Dove Men’s body wash and that musky cologne he’d worn for years—cheap, probably, but it worked for him. Familiar. Steady.

His hands rested on the table, fingers tapping in a pattern only he understood.The same fingers that had words tattooed across them, small and black, fading in places. I used to trace those letters while we watched TV. Sometimes during sex. Sometimes just because I could.

He caught me staring and smiled. That slow, lopsided one that made me feel like home.

I smiled back, reflexively, even though my chest ached.

And then, like muscle memory of another kind, the real memories flooded in.

The night I had my first panic [attack.It](http://attack.It) hit out of nowhere—in the kitchen, barefoot on the tile, and suddenly everything was closing in. My breath caught in my throat, my heart galloping toward something I couldn’t name. I slid down the cabinet, knees drawn in, hands shaking.

He found me like that.Didn’t panic. Didn’t talk too much.He just sank down next to me, knees pressed to mine, and matched my breathing.One hand on my back. One on my knee.No fixing. No fear. Just—*there.*And I remember thinking, *This is what love feels like.*Not a rescue, not a solution. Just stillness. Just staying.

I reached across the table and rested my hand on his thigh.Just a simple gesture—automatic, familiar.

But the second my fingers landed, I remembered.That night in bed, his voice low in the dark as he told me his father used to pinch him there. Hard. Where no one could see. Pinch him so it would hurt and bruise.

 That was the first time I ever saw him cry. And he let me hold him.

The memory hit like breath against glass—sudden, quiet, and a little shattering.

I didn’t pull away. Just softened my touch.Let it mean what it used to.*I remember. I see you. I still care where it hurt.*

He looked at me—not startled, just... [still.Like](http://still.Like) he felt it, [too.Like](http://too.Like) part of him knew exactly what I was saying without saying it,

We had always been gentle with each other’s wounds.and another part didn’t know how to hold it anymore.

Now, he was still smiling across the table. Still wearing the anniversary jacket. Still holding the shape of who he had been to me, and who I had been to him.

But I knew, deep down, even if I didn’t want to:

We were no longer reaching for each other.

We were remembering how it felt to be held.

And it wasn’t the same.

He moved out of the state.And I moved on—to a new love.He’s kind. Steady.But it’s not the same.

Not because he isn’t good to me.But because I never gave myself to someone that way again.Not as fully.Not without armor.

Still, every now and then—when I pass a Greek restaurant, or hear the sound of pinball—I think about that night.The way he smiled like it didn’t hurt.The way I touched his thigh, hoping he’d remember.

And maybe he did.But neither of us said it.

*Almost.*

  


			

  
  
  
  
  




  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


His Side

I think I started letting go on Valentine’s Day. We were sitting in the living room when I said, “You’re like a muted version of yourself on medication.” I still hate that I said it out loud. Not because it wasn’t honest—but because I knew how much it hurt. She was doing the work. She was trying to feel better. And I made it sound like she was disappearing.

We didn’t break up that night.But something cracked between us.I think a part of her stopped trusting me.And a part of me realized I wasn’t brave enough to leave yet.

He just came back from a business trip that took him to some far flung eastern countries like India, Bali & Thailand. I visited two of those countries last year and gave him lots of tips and pointers for his trip. 

Fast forward 3 weeks to his return and he tells me “Oh I brought you back coffee”. Here’s the kicker…he knows full well that I do not consume caffeine, haven’t for years per doctors orders as it exacerbates my anxiety. If I have a quarter of a can coke it would give me an accelerated heart rate and nausea, I’m now that sensitive to caffeine. 

I’m not a person who expects huge gifts, I’d be happy with the smallest thing that says you were thinking of me. A mini little elephant figurine, some incense, a bar or two of chocolate….why coffee? 

Also, when I travel I buy small pieces of jewelry as keepsake. I’d given him $1,000.00 to purchase me something from the one three countries that I hadn’t visited. I told him that I would love to have something he picked out himself. He never did, and just transferred the money back after the trip. I feel to hurt and disappointed….AITAH? 

Edit: Some people in the comments are hung up on the fact that I had chocolate bars listed as appropriate small gifts ideas that could even be bought at the airport. Him giving me chocolate would be excusable, because some people are not aware of how much caffeine it contains. There’s no excusing straight caffeine though. ",11,1746077380.0,AITAH,37,0.82,False

I am explaining how tariffs work  in the US and how they could be used to strengthen the economy. Also, retaliatory tariffs.","Tariffs are taxes imposed by a government on imported goods, which increase the cost of those goods for consumers. They are used to protect domestic industries by making foreign products more expensive, thereby encouraging consumers to buy locally made items instead. 

However, if a country doesn’t produce that item say coffee then it just increases the cost with no alternative. 

The US imports majority of its goods and doesn’t export as much as it imports. So if another country places a tariff on US goods it makes the US export more expensive to their consumers and if that country does have an alternative for consumers for that item say for automobiles then it also hurts the US because they can just buy the alternative. 

The US doesn’t have many exports that are only found in the US. If we wanted to strengthen the economy using tariffs we would have needed to have the manufacturing processes already in place to encourage US consumers to buy American.

**I (F24) and my BF (M25) had a trip planned and the day before the trip he stops messaging me and then doesn't show up the next day to leave. Can you tell me what to do so I don't lose my mind?**



Hi. This is my first post, because I need people to tell me what to think right now. My bf and I have been dating for a little over 6 months, and we have both been really busy with work and his dad has recently been sick so we haven't gotten to see each other as often these last 5-6 weeks. So about a month ago we decided to plan a vacation during a national holiday that is going on right now. We both are early in our careers and don't make much but we decided to use a bit of savings and fly to a nearby country and have a beach vacation, stay in some hotels, swim and the lot. We've both been so excited for this trip. He's planned most of the general stuff, which days and times we should fly, he booked all the hotels ( we were going to go back and forth between some islands), and messaging me almost every day this week with weather updates and things we could do. I have been super busy with work but cut out some time earlier this week to make a more in depth schedule so we could make the most out of our vacation and to book some stuff for us to do to ensure we would have tickets. It was all going perfectly, we were both clearly excited and had spent a good amount of money. I know he already spent at least $1000 booking stuff, so he was very invested. Plus he is the one who initially came up with the plan and invited me.

Here's where the story turns. (Keep in mind our flight is at 9:10 this morning , the 30th, so we had loose plans to meet near my street and get a taxi at 7:30) Yesterday the 29th I have wifi issues at my apartment, so I don't get a ""good morning"" message. (When we first started dating I kind of found these a bit annoying but I've grown to love them so much, and I know it means a lot to him that I say good-morning back so i try my best to respond within a few hours) So I go to a coffee shop and see that he hasn't messaged me, which I find a little weird but I take the opportunity to be the one to say good-morning first (something I very rarely get to do since he works a 9-5 and I'm remote) and I get to work on my latest project and don't think too much of it. Then a little later I send him the latest ideas for our trip and ask if hes bringing any nicer clothes if we want to do a slightly fancier dinner one night. No response. This man is always ALWAYS on his phone, he responds so fast sometimes it gives me whiplash and its been hours and... nothing. But I know hes at work and I feel a little crazy for even thinking anything of it. I accidentally leave him for hours sometimes because I'm not as attached to my phone so its not a big deal if he doesn't respond quickly, but it is weird for him.

A few hours later I send him a booking confirmation. No response. I finish my work and go home. Then 5:30 rolls around, and I know he should be off work. I message him again and no response. An hour later I message again because I'm getting worried he isn't messaging back the night before our flight. No response. I call him a couple times and he doesn't pick up so by 7/7:30 I'm stressing out, and I walk over to his apartment (a 5 min walk from mine). His bike is outside his door but I knock for 20ish min, and NO RESPONSE. I'm trying to come up with excuses. Maybe he had to work super late? He's at dinner? His phone is dead or broken? I go home and just pack and go to sleep.

This morning still nothing. We planned to leave at 7:30, so I get ready as I would have and try calling him a few times. At 7:30 I go out to the street corner where we normally have met before and wait. To get to the airport in time to check in we have to leave by 8:00 at the absolute latest. I message and call him the whole time and NOTHING. At 8:01 I head to his apartment again. I'm pounding on the door, calling him, there is nothing, no response. His shoes are there that I can see, his bike outside unmoved from the day before. We have missed our flight, so I request a refund on the site while literally sitting against his door. (I miraculously got the refund BTW) and I cancel any bookings I made, all of which went through. So I'm super sad about missing our vacation but I wan to emphasize that I'm not mad about the money, I was able to get it back. I'm scared at this point.

He's been the perfect boyfriend, he brought flowers to my place when I got sick, he is always on time to pick me up for our dates, he plans things for us, we've never fought, I don't even think I've ever seen him annoyed with me, and I'm super annoying. The last time a saw him ( The 24th?) His last words to me were ""I love you"" like 3 times, and then when I left me messaged that he ""loved being with me"" and then later I got a goodnight message.

Cut to today and suddenly its radio silence. Nothing. I'm crying at this point and accept that he's probably not home or I would have hear him so I go home and just cry and get pizza and wine and message him approx. 100000000 times, and try to call and NOTHING.

I haven't met his family yet so I don't have their contacts, I've met a couple of his friends and workmates in passing but didn't think to get any of their numbers, why would I? I know the buildings where he works but not where his office is or the name of the company (its not my native language and names are really hard for me to remember so he might have told me but I forgot if he did), My point is that I have no way of contacting him. If he is in the hospital or something no one is going to think to call me.

It's the evening of the 30th as I'm tying this. I recently got back from his apartment again and his bike hasn't moved. I taped a message to his door to call me, and my contact info for anyone who goes to his apartment in case someone else might know what happened. I can't think of anything else to do and I'm terrified and crying constantly thinking the worst.

I'm trying to think of what could possibly be happening. He takes his bike everywhere but its outside his apartment unmoved. He spent a lot of money on tickets for this trip and then didn't show. Where I live you need your phone to use taxis and metros and such, and there are charging ports and repair shops everywhere so even if his phone died the 29th or broke it would be fine by now. My best idea is that there was some sort of family emergency? maybe with his dad who is sick, that he had to go early on the 29th to see them and after he got there he lost his phone and has been super crazy with family stuff that he hasn't had the bandwidth to go get a new phone. He also just has my contact saved and doesn't have my number memorized (we use wechat), so he wouldnt be able to contact me on another phone.

I've cried more today then in the past year. Please tell me other things I can try, or other excuses for why he isn't responding and didn't go on the trip. I'm so scared. When I was at his apartment door tonight all I could think is ""what if he fell and hit his head and hes on the other side of this door dead?"", but I'm not about to go full crazy and call the cops. Though I'm considering it at this point. Because the image wont leave my head and something is wrong I can feel it.

please help me.

Edit: Thanks for telling me I'm not overreacting this was what I needed to actually try to contact the cops.

*Definitely call the cops. This is very worrying. I would be concerned about his safety/wellbeing. You are NOT overreacting. Have them do a wellness check.*

**littlemissy145**

*Why aren’t you calling the police?? Call them!*

>OOP: Okay, thanks I really didnt know if i was overreacting.

**OracleofAtlantis**

*If Chinese is not your first language, I'd also look into contacting the embassy for your country (got the impression you were foreign). They may have resources to help you get translations when contacting the police. I really hope that he's safe and that you're doing as okay as you can be in this situation. You are NOT overreacting in the slightest, I would be a mess, and so would most of my loved ones if something like this happened. Trust your gut. Please don't prioritize updating Reddit. Your emotions and both of your well-being should matter more. Thinking of you guys.*

>OOP: Thanks so much. So many people have just been replying ""Why haven't you gone sooner??"" But Chinese is very much not my first language and when I'm tired/upset I'm even worse. But I was thankfully able to get by, thanks for the kind words. It's really helping me wind down from the craziness



**Update - 3 hours later**



He's not dead!

Okay so its been a crazy night. For everyone asking why I hadn't already gone to the cops, it had only been a day and a half and I live in a very safe place so I didn't want to overreact. People have always told me I blow stuff up so I'm very cautious about it now. I know I probably should have gone earlier though.

Anyway, I left my house and tried to find a police station but all I could find were traffic violation stations, so I called in even though I have the speech capabilities of an 11 year old in Chinese, and told them what was going on. There was. nice woman on the phone and she was very helpful and patient and sent over some officers to meet me and help me.

They immediately take my case very seriously, but I still have the problem of not really having much info to give them. They asked if I had a picture of his ID and I was like... no? and so it took them a long time to find his record in the system. They were ready to go with me to do a house check but then they got an update on the system and asked if I was okay going with them to the station, and I of course was. So I get there and they ask me a few more questions like if we were fighting (no we weren't), etc. Then the officers who I'm talking to get a bit nervous and one types something into his phone and shows me a translation, and it says: ""Your boyfriend was arrested 2 days ago.""

I felt so many emotions and I'm still reeling, I barely slept last night and I have been worried sick and crying all day and so I'm relieved that hes fine, hes not dead or hurt or sick or in a coma or something. But at the same time,,, Hes fucking arrested????

I'm still trying to wrap my head around it quite frankly. They couldn't tell me why he was arrested because the case isn't closed, but they took down my number and said they'd call me.

But yeah. I'm so exhausted from this whole ordeal.

Since I know people will ask, he's a great guy, a very nice person. He does, however, have very little regard for rules and regulations. He is an asshole driver on his bike and often cuts off cars. Also, he's not an angry person ever, but I can kind of seeing him getting in a fight if there's a good reason, at least in his own mind. (I know he once got in a altercation with someone early in our relationship for cursing out his mother).

But both of those mean you are held in custody until they figure out the case. If its just a minor traffic violation or a fight he'll be out in a few days, and probably pay a fine. If it's something worse... well then maybe I shouldn't be seeing him anyway.

Anyway thanks for everyone who commented, and made me feel like I wasn't overreacting or being a crazy girlfriend.

I'll update if I ever find out what he did.

TLDR: Hes not dead, he was arrested 2 days ago and his case is still ongoing.

Edit/ update: The more I think about it, He had to have been arrested early on tuesday. So probably not a fight or anything, maybe something he was caught on camera for?

Edit: when I say he has little regard for rules I mean compared to me, its very typical here. Bikes are illegal in this city so I'm told and yet I almost get hit by one daily. Jaywalking is illegal and yet he and everyone else does it all the time. Also, you can get held in custody for very minor things, which is why I haven't blacklisted him quite yet. Like once a guy yelled slurs at a group of my friends and called my black friend the n-word and the police detained him for 3 days for disturbing the peace. Not saying my bf would do that but you can get detained for parking tickets



**Comments**



**Questionsey**

*This post has made me realize how rare it is that anything leaks from China onto the English speaking internet.*

>OOP: haha yeah, I'm originally from america so (this might not be a good thing) but one of my first thoughts when I started to truely spiral was... lets ask reddit



**DawaLhamo**

*Early in our relationship, my husband got pulled over (in a small town in Kansas) for a rolling-stop at a stop sign. He had some unpaid parking tickets from years before, so they arrested him. Luckily he was able to get them cleared up, and he was able to get word to me, and was out in a couple days.*

*I hope you have the same kind of luck with your boyfriend, and it's something that can get cleared up quickly. The timing really sucks, though, and I'm sorry you missed your trip. Your boyfriend will really need to make it up to you.*



**Tremenda-Carucha**

*It'll probably be alright, honestly, but it's hard when someone you care about is going through something like this, and you're left feeling lost and a bit bewildered, and I suspect many of us have felt that way at some point, facing an unexpected crisis, so maybe try to be kind to yourself and just focus on taking things one day at a time, because, really, there's not much else you can do right now, is there?*

>OOP: thanks, yeah its been stressful. But I'm also just glad he's okay. Im just typing this until I get tired enough to go to sleep at this point.

Most of my friends from Korea living in the Philippines absolutely hate and despise the Philippines and its people, even making their own ""creative"" jokes, saying Koreans should and will always look down on them, and literally, because they short, ugly gremlins. It was absolutely disgusting to hear, and while I was alone with one of my friends while hanging out, I asked him why do you guys hate the Philippines? Turns out they all had experiences in the Philippines, and even one of their sisters got SA'd, robberies, etc. He also told me about an incident where the police kidnapped and held an innocent Korean businessman for ransom, and was killed, and not just that, but also showed me a news article stating 38 South Koreans were killed in the Philippines, which made me pretty angry, but I didn't feel as bitter as my friends do towards the Philippines. 

They always insult the Philippines and its people, and when we were hanging out, a Filipino man, accidentally spilled coffee on my friend's clothes because the man was on his phone and not looking at where he was going. Of course, my friend reacted violently, and began to taunt the man, who was pretty much defenseless, since my friend was way bigger and taller than the man, maybe a 20 cm difference, since my friend is 184 cm? I felt bad and I was the only one who actually broke him off the accident, while the others were cheering him on and telling him to beat the man up. I have never felt so disgusted and that was when I decided to leave their friend group. 

I still remember clearly my friends all discussed they wish to leave the Philippines but cannot until they graduate, since their parents work here, and all Filipinos in Korea are not welcome, which made me feel disgusted, as even I am half, I still feel everyone is welcome to South Korea. 

I just want to hear your thoughts on this and what makes you think Koreans feel bitter towards the Philippines and its people. ",1,1746076590.0,South_Korea,3,0.6,False

Ever sat in a meeting and thought, “What on earth are we doing here?” Like, seriously, how did we get to the point where discussing the color of post-it notes takes 45 minutes? 🤔 

You’re not alone! Many of us are buried under a mountain of meetings that could have been an email (or a quick text, let’s be real). So how do we reclaim our time and sanity? Enter the *10-Second Rule*!

Here’s the deal: **If it takes longer than 10 seconds to say what you need to say, consider summarizing it.** Sounds simple, right? But it’s a game changer.

**Why it works:**

- **Clarity is King:** When you condense your thoughts, you get straight to the point. It’s like eating a nutritious meal instead of a junk food binge. 🍏
  
- **Time Efficiency:** Think about how many times you've sat there waiting for someone to finish rambling when you already know what they’re saying. Cut that downtime in half!

- **Awkward Silence:** These meetings can have crickets chirping after the same person has held the floor for 15 minutes. Spice it up by making it a little competitive—who can say their point in the shortest time?   

So what can you do? Here are a few actionable strategies to keep your meetings short and effective:

1. **Set a Timer:** At the start of each meeting, announce the 10-second rule. Trust me, people will start thinking on their feet!
   
2. **Use Visual Aids:** Have a whiteboard or a flip chart? Jot down key points—visualizing can often condense the conversation to the essentials.

3. **Before You Speak, Ask – “Is this necessary?”** It’s easy to go off-topic. A little self-reflection goes a long way. 

4. **Redirect if Needed:** If someone strays into the weeds, gently ask them to help you get back on track. “I love where your head’s at, but we might be veering off a little. Can we summarize that in 10 seconds?”

**Personal Story Time**: Just last week, I had a meeting where we ended up discussing the intricacies of file formats (seriously), and it went on for almost an hour. Afterward, I decided to put the 10-second rule into action in our next meeting. Guess what? We wrapped it up in just 25 minutes! I felt like a productivity wizard. 🧙‍♂️✨

Next time you find yourself trapped in a lengthy discussion, remember: **10 seconds is all you need.** 

After all, the real magic happens when you can free up your time to be more creative, productive, and maybe even have a coffee break! ☕ What would you do with those extra minutes? Just think about it! 

Here’s hoping your next meeting becomes a brief yet effective powerhouse of collaboration! 💪",1,1746076232.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Recently I’ve been having marriage problems at home. 
Husband not helping like he used to. He’s texting other women in the area. I’ve caught him on FaceTime a few times with them. He has a drinking problem and has broken down bedroom doors and laid his hands on me….

We’ve been trying to make the marriage work but emotionally I’m not attracted to him anymore. I think we are only in this marriage for the kids and convenience.

Anywho!!!!!!

My ex and I have been in and out of touch the past 7 years. 
Recently I reached out to his old phone number in November to see if it was still his number. To my surprise it is. 
I apologized for things I said in the past and so did he. We reconciled and I thought we’d never be in touch again since before November it was almost 2 years I hadn’t heard from him. 

Well..we’ve been in daily communication since November. 
And recently we poured our emotions out to each other like never before. 
He’s told me about how his own wife is cheating on him and has in the past.
I’ve told him about what’s going on at home with me.
We just share a lot to each other and we find it nice to have someone to talk to about everything.

When we were together I was 18 and he was 21. We were friends for many years before then and we never had any bumps in our relationship. It was perfect. We broke up due to him being deployed in the army and him wanting me to be happy without him. 
Literally only reason we broke up.

Well…7 years later we both regret that but we are at a stand still.

Both married, both have kids, live across the country from one another.

We were going to be in our hometown during the same time in a few months and we thought about meeting up for coffee to reminisce. But that’s no longer happening due to conflicting schedules and no longer being in our hometown at the same time.

We don’t know when we’d ever see each other in person again.

But we still communicate. 

I’m not sure what to do. 
I’m in a loveless marriage but can’t leave him.
I have some sort of feelings towards my ex. 

Any advice? 
Please. I just need guidance.

Edit: I work night shift so we can save money on daycare for our kids. My husband expects me to have a normal sleep schedule and keep the house perfect while he works. However I work 36-48 hours a week. I’m always exhausted and he doesn’t contribute other than financially.
I work to escape our home. 
I take anti depressants because of him.
He blames me for all our problems.
All I do is try to be a good partner and I feel guilty being in touch with my ex but it’s so refreshing to have someone who actually wants to hear about my day. And who actually cares about what I want to say. ",1,1746075893.0,Infidelity,3,1.0,False
1kc0umn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Various_Curve_6404/comments/1kc0umn/the_silence_on_redfield_road/,The Silence on Redfield Road,"

On a quiet street in the town of Hollow Creek, something changed forever on the night of August 17, 2019.

Redfield Road had always been the kind of place where people left their doors unlocked, where neighbors nodded politely and kept to themselves. So when 42-year-old Melanie Grant was found dead in her living room coffee cup still warm, front door slightly ajar it didn’t just shock the community. It fractured it.

Melanie was a local schoolteacher, known for her quiet nature and deep love for literature. She lived alone, had no criminal record, and no known enemies. The idea that she was murdered in her own home felt impossible. Yet there she was slumped over on the sofa, a single stab wound below the rib cage. No signs of forced entry. No valuables taken. Nothing disturbed except her silence.

The investigation began the following morning, after her colleague and close friend, Rachel Dunn, called the police when Melanie didn’t show up for a Saturday workshop. Detectives quickly ruled out robbery. There were no fingerprints on the weapon a kitchen knife, wiped clean and placed back in the drawer. It was almost surgical, precise.

Suspicion first fell on her ex-boyfriend, Thomas Reid, a local handyman with a rough past. They had split a year earlier after a short, rocky relationship. He admitted to stopping by her house a few days before her death, claiming he wanted to ""check in."" But his alibi security footage showing him at a bar during the time of death checked out.

Then came the detail that changed the case.

One of Melanie’s neighbors mentioned seeing a car parked near her house late that night. A blue Honda Civic windows down, engine running, driver inside. Police traced the vehicle to a 19-year-old named Evan Merrill, a former student of Melanie’s.

Evan was quiet in school, often kept to himself. Melanie had once mentored him through a difficult semester and even helped him apply for community college. They had stayed in contact loosely, mostly through email. But something had shifted. Investigators later found a journal in Evan’s room filled with entries about Melanie some respectful, others obsessive, almost delusional.

Under questioning, Evan broke.

He claimed he had gone to visit Melanie to “talk about something personal,” but said they argued, and he “just snapped.” There were no signs of a struggle, but he confessed to stabbing her once in the side, panicking afterward, and trying to make it look clean. He left her there, alone, and drove off into the night.

Evan Merrill was arrested and charged with second-degree murder. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison the following year.

To this day, some in Hollow Creek still leave flowers at Melanie’s gate. Her death was more than a tragedy it was a reminder that even in the quietest towns, the people we least suspect sometimes carry the darkest truths.",1,1746075859.0,u_Various_Curve_6404,0,1.0,False

Part 1.","There was something deeply disturbing about the artist's artwork hanging in the hallway of my childhood home. 

So much so that I stopped for a moment, transfixed by each one, the images growing progressively more violent the deeper we ventured into the hallway. 

Imogen Prairie was polite, pausing in front of each piece, nodding and smiling, swinging a bottle of chardonnay. 

But even her expression was beginning to crack. 

This artwork wasn’t my mother.

I had grown up with paintings of kittens and watercolor landscapes, not to mention the endless supply of rattling pottery crowding the kitchen.

My mom was a self-proclaimed hoarder, like it was a badge of honor.

Born in Pai, a quiet mountain town in northern Thailand where the air was clean and the views stretched on forever, my mother had lived in paradise.

Then she met my dad, a broke musician backpacking through Southeast Asia, and the rest was history.

I was the result of a one-night stand, and my poor mother had traded hot springs and blue mornings with endless views, for a cramped apartment in downstate New York with a man who left when I was in middle school. 

So, a huge fucking downgrade. 

The paintings had changed, yeah. But the place still smelled like home.

Kaz, roommate number two was... less impressed. 

Daring a glance at him, I tore my gaze from one painting in front of me: three shadowy figures devouring the heart of a woman. 

Nothing said, *“Welcome home, son!”* like nightmarish figures dancing on every wall. 

That was a recurring theme, apparently. Each one was labelled *friendship*.

Kaz wasn't a fan, standing with his arms folded, lips curled like he was trying to decode each painting. 

He stood beside me, wearing a white button-up and jeans, his wild sandy hair stuffed beneath a bucket hat at least two sizes too big. 

He looked... tolerable. 

Unlike Imogen, who resembled moonlight itself, draped in white silk that hugged every curve and pooled beneath her, blonde curls tangled with blue ribbons.

Meeting my mother was a big deal, and Imogen was the only one treating it like one. Kaz had barely managed half-formal, with a splash of skater-dude.

I wanted him in a suit. But no. Suits were “outdated and gross,"" and he ""didn’t want to look like a salaryman.”

They couldn't have clashed more with my mother's bright pink hallway, the old-fashioned rugs, or the goddamn welcome mat, my childhood nemesis.

I was always tripping over that thing.

Kaz rested his head comfortably on my shoulder. 

“These are some interesting paintings, dude,” he hummed, lips twitching into a smirk.

He was trying so hard not to laugh.

I could see it in the way he pressed his lips together, practically vibrating with unkempt giggles. Kaz wasn’t fucking slick. 

He thought wearing shades would hide his puffy eyes, that they were the perfect accessory for his outfit, and maybe, he was kind of right.

Living with Imogen Prairie for four years had made me (reluctantly) more style conscious, and Kaz was rocking the look. 

Still, when his personality plummeted from an insufferable parental figure to even-more-insufferable toddler in less than an hour, I knew the culprit. 

He chuckled and nestled his head into the crook of my neck. 

Stoned Kaz was a force to be reckoned with. “Do you think your mom is, like, trying to tell us something?”

I wasn’t expecting Imogen to snort behind us.

She was supposed to be the sensible one.

I stepped away from him— and the unmistakable smell of weed. “Art is... subjective,” I said, though even I was struggling to maintain eye contact with some of the pieces.

“Well, yeah, art is subjective, but then there’s whatever the fuck this is.” 

Kaz danced toward another canvas, fully in clown mode. 

He wasn’t normally like this—even high. 

I wasn't used to being the adult in the room. 

“Ah, yes!” Kaz’s voice dropped to a whisper, adopting a David Attenborough-esque narration. 

“Human sacrifice! And what appears to be... hmm, it looks like a cult worshipping the sky! How very…” 

He turned to me with a grin, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. This boy was testing my patience. 

*“...charming.”*

“Charlie.” 

When he lost it, snorting loud enough to echo down the hallway, I shoved him, and he collapsed into giggles. 

I didn't blame him for laughing. 

The paintings were… a lot. 

The artist must have been heavily experimenting with brushes, scarlet strokes bleeding across every canvas.

To me, it looked like a toddler had been let loose with a can of red paint.

I yanked Kaz back to my side, steadying him when he tipped off-kilter.

“Behave.” 

He snorted again, pretending to marvel at the paintings. 

“I *am*!”

“Did you seriously get high before meeting my mother?” I hissed. 

“Nope.”

I pulled off his glasses, and he entered defensive mode. 

“Rowan!”

“You clearly are.”

“Relax!” he rolled his eyes. “I've met your Mom before. You *know* she likes me.”

Kaz’s words hit me like ice-cold water, a shiver spider webbing down my spine. 

He was right. I had already brought them home. 

I found my voice, my words felt unnatural, rolling off of my tongue. 

“So… *why* are you meeting her again?” 

Kaz rolled his eyes, snatched the shades back, and slid them back on with exaggerated slowness. Instead of answering, he poked another painting. 

Out of the corner of my eye, Imogen crouched, frowning at yet another blur of contorted scarlet. 

Kaz sighed, blowing a raspberry. 

“Sooo, what am I even looking at? Is this like some kind of story through artwork?”

I shrugged. “I have no idea,” I admitted. “I’ve never seen these before.""

He didn't look at me, his gaze glued to one painting in particular. ""You haven't?""

I shot him a look. ""Dude. My mom collects pottery.""

Kaz furrowed his brows, before turning back to the main canvas. Three shadowy figures standing under a crescent moon. 

“I can... kind of see a story… if I squint.” 

“Yeah?” I snorted. “What's it about? Weird rituals?”

He tilted his head, lips curving in concentration. 

“Okay, so there are four figures, and I think...” He moved closer, prodding a painting above us, pushing his glasses up onto the crown of his head.

This time, the painting showed the moon bleeding beneath three dancing figures. 

He traced his finger along one of the kneeling figures. “I think one of these guys sacrifices the others— and *this* one,” his finger skimmed the canvas. 

“It's showing them coming back, but this time, they're *made* of the moon.” 

Kaz turned to me, flashing a grin. “Shadows. Perfect mimics of the human body, soul, and consciousness.”

*“Fascinating,”* I muttered.

Kaz nodded toward another canvas, one showing a fourth figure floating alone above the others. “And this,” he said, crouching, “looks like some kind of rebirth.”

It was getting progressively harder to hide my thinning patience. “Kaz, no offense, but I don't care.”

Ignoring me, he turned back to the wall, his expression crumpling.

“So, each painting, I think, shows a stage of them being reborn,” he murmured, his voice dropping into a low, almost robotic drawl, the words rolling slowly off his tongue. 

“They were shot,” he said, prodding a painting that showed a cavernous hole in a figure’s forehead.

He moved down the hallway, dragging his index finger across each scene. 

His other arm hung loosely at his side, his gaze taking in each grisly explosion of scarlet. 

He chuckled, and for a moment, I could have sworn his face blurred in and out of focus, as if he, too, were just a painting.

""Shot through the skull, carved from their outlines, and sacrificed under a full moon,"" he said, turning to me with a knowing smile. 

""She took pity on them. She gathered their stars, their twisted human shapes, and remade them anew in her own light.""

Kaz stroked his fingers across a painting depicting an amalgamation of screaming heads, and it hit me that he wasn't blinking. 

“She wanted more,” he murmured. “The moon had waited so long, abandoned in the dark. She had tried again and again to reach human blood and bone—and failed every time. But not her royals. Oh, no,” his voice twisted into a laugh, which bled into hysteria. 

“They were hers. The ones standing proud under her light, who let her bleed into their souls, their veins, filling their thoughts with the language of water.”

He paused, moving closer to the painting like she was being drawn forward. His steps were slow, his arms swinging, eyes dilated, lips parting in a dream-like smile.

""They were her…” He tilted his head slightly. ""Royalty.”

I rolled my eyes, but I was too aware of his stature. 

Kaz wasn't moving.

He was just standing, arms loose, head tilted. 

“Uh-huh. That's really cool, dude. They're just paintings.” 

Kaz stepped toward another piece, one I couldn’t bring myself to look at. 

I had been avoiding it since I first glimpsed it out of the corner of my eye, every nerve ending igniting, my skin crawling with phantom bugs. 

Kaz turned, his smile eerie, eyes suddenly too vacant for me to ignore. “Why are you avoiding it, Rowan?”

“I’m not,” I whispered, transfixed by the painting of my face.

There was something grisly and wrong about the way I had been etched onto the canvas. 

My face was skeletal, my eyes bulging from their sockets, lips stretched into a grin, and my mouth full of squirming red.

Kaz didn't speak. His lips broke out into a smile I didn't recognize; one with too many teeth. 

I felt him grab my shoulders and shove me forwards. 

But once I was locking eyes with the painting, I could feel myself slowly coming apart, hypnotized by an explosion of vivid red, which was the perfect depiction of my own face dripping down the canvas. 

""That's the King,"" Kaz sighed. ""A human boy, tricked and sacrificed, skinned, emptied of his shadow, and offered to the moon’s light as the King's immortal skin.""

He turned to me. “Isn't he… beautiful?”

Before I could respond, he cut me off. 

""Do you want to know what they did to the one who tricked them, Rowan?”  he spoke through his teeth this time, every word gritted. “Who fucking *slaughtered* them?” 

Kaz stepped closer, his breath prickling my neck, his voice contorting into something sour, spiteful, ice-cold, crawling, and so fucking *wrong*, I felt myself lurch back. 

But his fingernails clung on, like claws.  

I couldn't breathe, my chest contorting, what felt like *shapes*, shapes that became words, being forced up my throat. 

They weren't mine. They were *never* mine.

""Tell me,"" I choked out, the words tumbling from my mouth, shaped and molded like physical beings, each one forced through my lips, squeezing through my throat. These words weren't mine, and yet they *felt* like mine, rising like bile. They kept coming, violently torn from my bloody lips. 

*Tell me*. 

*Tell me*. 

“Tell… me.” 

My knees buckled, my hands dropping to my sides.

Kaz was quick to catch me, his arms suddenly snake-like, entwining around me. 

“Oh, you want me to *tell* you?” he teased in a sing-song. 

“Yes.” 

“They devoured her whole,” he said, his lips grazing the bridge of my ear.

“The children of the moon ate her—endlessly, beautifully. Body, mind, soul, consciousness—every part of her was consumed, her bones and stars skinned bare, even as her flesh healed itself, knitting back together, over and over and over—”

Kaz paused, as if for effect. “Do you want to know what happened to her?”

I didn't respond, my stomach twisting into knots. 

“She could not escape their feral, monstrous hunger. Even hiding in the dark, wrapped up in oblivion, made up of nothing. They found her again, dragging her soul into the light, stripping her of flesh and blood and *bone*,” 

Something ice cold trickled down my spine when I realized the two were in sync. Kaz, gripping my shoulders, and Imogen, knelt on the floor. 

When Kaz didn't move, his gaze still locked on the painting, I stepped back. 

He was quick to push me forward. “But her light saved them from their anger and resentment, and pain,” he said in a sing-song. Imogen joined him, her fingers reverently stroking across another canvas.

“She sculpted them into royals,” she murmured, translating, as the shadows in the paintings warped, like they were alive, moving, *sentient*, adorned with crowns of dripping, pooling crimson. 

Imogen’s lips broke out into a smile. 

Her hair was suddenly too bright, like liquid light cascading down her shoulders and dripping into her eyes. 

“Look!” She pointed to the next one, a crowd of blurred faces gathering around the crowned figures. 

Each face was painted with a different stroke of the artist's brush, a nightmare of endless, faceless figures drowning them. Imogen’s smile stretched wider across her face. “They even had followers!”

I hadn't realized I had been holding my breath until Kaz's grip slackened on my shoulder. 

""Followers, Rowan,"" he murmured. ""They had an entire kingdom to rule for themselves, to do *anything* they wanted."" 

He let me go.

Out of the corner of my eye, I glimpsed something adorning his head. 

Sharp white prongs sliced into the flesh of his forehead, rising into the shape of a crown, beads of red tracing jaggard rivers down pale skin. Somehow, it looked *right,* as if it belonged there. 

As if the remnants of a child's skull, tangled in his sandy curls, were *always* a part of him.

I swallowed, stumbling back, but he just smiled. 

“You've gone pale, dude,” he said, “What's wrong?”

The light flickered overhead. It was too bright, too *yellow*, and too harsh on my eyes when I squinted up at it.

I felt nauseous as the contrast between the paintings and my mother’s hallway sucked the air from my lungs. 

The bright pink and pale blue and beaded rugs all clashed with the blurred, contorted, absolute carnage - as if a psychopath had smeared real blood across each canvas.

*“We’re in the kitchen, Rowan!”*

Kaz. I twisted around slowly, bile climbing up my throat.

As if on cue, familiar aromas clinging to the corners of the hallway seeped into my brain, yanking me back to my childhood.

I hadn’t been to Thailand since I was a kid, but those powerful flavors had never left me. 

The smell was so thick in my nose, so real, it pulled me straight back to elementary school—sprinting down the stairs and tripping over the (un)welcome mat as I chased the rich, spicy kick of Tom Yum Goong.

I blinked, and the light flickered above me. 

“Rowan, come on! You're going to miss out on the feast!”

Imogen’s melodic laugh drifted down the hallway, an uncanny echo to it. 

“Imogen?” I shouted, my voice bouncing back at me. “Where did you guys go?”

“We’re in here, einstein!” Kaz’s laugh sounded strange, like trickling water. 

Their voices and the *smells* were delectable siren songs, compelling me forward. 

I didn’t remember the hallway being so long and warping like a funhouse mirror, each painting blurring in and out of view. 

But I didn’t care. Mom was cooking. 

I quickened my pace toward the door, ignoring the hallway as it shrank and bloated around me, the door getting smaller and smaller, until I was pinching it between my thumb and index finger. 

Maybe I was about to plummet down a rabbit hole. 

Trippy.

The door swung open on its own. I then realized, my breath catching, that I was the one shrinking.

I was a little kid again, staring down at my Game Boy Advance.

*“Rowan, what did I tell you about letting your dinner go cold?”* Mom’s voice dragged me over the threshold, warm and familiar. *“I don't care if you're playing Pokémon, that can wait. Dinner is ready.”*

*“But I was getting a Charizard!”* my younger self whined. I could sense my little body limping down the hallway, exaggerating a groan. *“I tripped over the welcome mat again! I think I sprained my ankle.”*

Her snort made me smile, warmth expanding in my chest.

“Oi dek bong oei, Rowan,” she laughed. “What *don't* you trip over?”

*“It's not my fault!”* I yelled back. *“It's the unwelcome mat’s fault.”*

*“Sweetie, you're the one who refuses to look where you're going,” Mom chuckled. *“Look up. That's all you need to do. Look up, and the world will stop hitting you in the face.”*

*“But what if the world is the stupid one?”* I mumbled back.

Silence. 

I was back to my own age, staring down at my shredded sneakers. 

I almost slammed face-first into another door waiting for me. 

Maybe she was right.

The hallway warped again, returning to normal-ish.

“Hey, Mom?” I called, echoing my younger self's squeaky voice.

In front of me sat a normal sized door. I turned the handle.

Exactly how I remembered it: large and spacious, with bright yellow décor and ancient Thai pottery hanging dangerously from the ceiling, rattling against each other. 

The lights were too bright, so bright that I had to shade my eyes, blinking through an intense allure bleeding through my mother’s windows. But it wasn't the sun. 

It was almost liquid, alive, bouncing off every reflective surface, dancing across the countertop, prancing over every brittle pattern plate hanging from the ceiling.

I followed the light’s path, tiptoeing across each shard of glass until it spilled across my mother’s table, already set for a feast.

It was all my favorites, a strange blend of childhood favorites and grown-up dishes.

Khao Tom and roti were spread out on patterned plates, steaming, the smell already drowning me, almost sending me to my knees. 

Kaz and Imogen had already taken their seats. When another wave of aroma hit me, rich and mouthwatering, I felt myself drawn forward without thinking.

I lunged for the chair beside Kaz, but he dropped his fork with a clang, mouth full.

“No, Rowan,” he said as something burst between his teeth, beads of red dripping down his chin. ""You're not sitting there.""

He pointed to the end of the table, where a seat, no, a throne, loomed, sculpted from flesh and bone, intestines twisted like withered ropes around the armrests.

""*That's* your seat.""

""He's right, sweetie,"" Mom’s voice bled from the corner. 

She was standing in front of the oven with her back to me, stirring something bubbling in a pan. Mom was wearing her favorite yellow apron.

""You know your place at the table, Rowan.""

I nodded, my thoughts dizzy, the world spinning around. ""Sure, Mom.""

I turned back to the feast before us, but with another violent lurch inside my mind, it had changed. 

The dishes I knew were gone, replaced by heaping bowls of slithering guts, skinned human meat threaded through wooden skewers. 

At the head of the table, a body lay stripped of its flesh, pearly white bone and shredded tendon, an apple crammed between skeletal teeth. 

Kaz lunged forward. 

He clawed at the corpse’s remains, tearing flesh straight from the bone, teeth gnashing together mindlessly, swallowing, spitting out, and repeating. 

Imogen giggled drunkenly, scooping pieces of brain from the hollowed-out skull. 

Disoriented, I collapsed into the throne as my vision swam. I stared at the plate before me, a writhing mass of living flesh that was still moving, squirming across patterned plates. I couldn’t stop myself. 

My hands moved on their own, shoving stringy intestines and pulpy, bloody organs into my mouth. 

They tasted *good.*

Good enough for me to moan like an animal, reveling in each burst of flavor. 

When I was finished, the smell of fresh meat hit me, and the room twisted and blurred. 

Torsos knelt in twisted prayer, their severed heads set neatly beside them. 

I recognized them. Sam and his roommates, my old frat brothers, teachers, classmates, friends. They were all mine. 

I was laughing.

I didn't even realize, until I heard my own giggles erupting around me.

I slipped off of my throne, crawling towards them, feral, grinning, gnawing into each one until I was full. But I was never full. 

I was never whole.

I ate endlessly, watched them grow back, their skin and flesh reforming, only to strip it from their bones once more.

No matter how much I stuffed myself, I was still hungry. I was starving, empty, squeezing their mangled remains between my fists.

I went back to my main meal, the corpse without a face. I tore skin from bone, clawing hair from the hollowed-out skull. 

But she just grew back, and I laughed harder, reveling in the taste of her, rich and sweet, her blood running down my throat.

""Do you like it, my son?""

The voice was sweet, a melody seeping inside my head.

Mom was gone.

Instead, she was on my plate. I was tearing her open, piece by piece, her skin soft and malleable, flooding my mouth. 

In Mom’s place was a mesmerizing light. 

Light that was so soft, so warm, I found myself moving toward it. 

I dropped to my knees in front of her, enjoying her phantom fingers running through my hair, tracing my lips, and jerking my chin towards her static smile. 

""A banquet fit for a *King*.""

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

The clock mounted on the wall had to be wrong. 

9pm was five hours ago — there was no way it was only 9:03.

Over the course of those hours, I had come to realize I really did not like small spaces. 

Interrogation rooms, for example, which was just a cement stall stinking of urine. 

The walls were crumbling and the glass of milk I had been offered was making me gag. 

Another glance at the clock. 9:04. I stifled a groan. 

I glanced at the clock once more. Still broken. Still ticking. 

I was definitely hyperventilating, my breaths coming out in sharp, jagged pants. Did I sound like I was panicking? Maybe. 

But so did the cop sitting across the worn wooden table from me. 

She sat straight, with impressive posture, like she knew what she was doing. 

Mid-thirties. Blonde ponytail. Smelled like Five Guys and cheap perfume. 

She wore a polite yet not-fucking-around smile. 

But her breathing was ragged, and I could hear — no, *sense*—her heart doing the devil’s tango, thud, thud, thudding in my skull. 

I noticed her heartbeat significantly accelerated when I adjusted myself in the chair. 

She was scared of me.

“Rowan Beck,” she said my name like I was caught between her teeth. “Where were you on the night of January 20th, 2025?”

Unconscious. 

“I was at a party.”

She nodded slowly. “Uh-huh. And, Rowan, did you see your roommates, Charlie Delacroix and Imogen Prairie, at this party?”

Yes. 

Several times, actually. 

I was the last one to see them. 

“No ma'am.”

She inclined her head, eyes narrowing.

She was giving me that *look;* the one I’d gotten from patrons, classmates, hell, even my own therapist. 

Like they knew something I didn’t. Like I was a fucking walking neon-colored sign. 

There was zero (official) evidence I had killed my roommates. 

The cop’s mouth broke out into a very obviously fake smile. “Sweetie, would you like a drink?” 

I matched her grin, leaning back in my chair. 

“I'm good. I'm also twenty-four-years old, ma’am.”

“We have soda,” she said, shuffling her chair closer. 

“How about a nice, fresh glass of soda, hmm?” Her gaze drank me in, zeroing in on the visible sweat stains on my shirt. 

The same one I’d worn for the last three days. My jeans barely fit; they were Kaz’s, and I wasn’t expecting to lose a ton of weight over the course of a month.

""Rowan, you claim to have an alibi. Samuel Fuller. He confirmed you were with him that night - the night they disappeared."" 

Her lips curled slightly, like she couldn't bear the thought of me walking free. 

Again. It was the third time this week they'd pulled me from class. 

She leaned in, and I stiffened, her scent sharp and metallic, prickling the back of my throat. ""Is there anything else you want to tell us?"" she asked, voice low. 

""Anything at all?""

“Yes, actually,” I said. 

Her expression pricked with intrigue, one brow raising. “Go ahead.”

I tilted forward, settling her with a wide smile. “Well, first of all, I'm fucking starving.”

Then I lunged, my hands closing around her neck, squeezing until blood ran from her nose. She screamed, but I kept squeezing, like her throat was a fucking juice carton. Her bones were so fragile. 

Soft. Easy to snap.

But I didn’t.

I let go. Slowly. A moan rose from my throat.

“I’m so fucking hungry,” I whispered.

“It’s driving me insane. I can’t eat. Not a single fucking thing. I’m blacking out. I slept for a month! How is that normal?” I laughed. 

“My house is smeared with blood. There are scratches on the ceiling. And the people I love? Gone. Poof! I’m alone, and I think I've completely lost my fucking mind!”

I leaned in closer, my voice cracking. Her startled breaths tickled my cheek.

“Want to know what I think happened?” I murmured, suddenly far too aware of her pulse. I ran my lips down the curve of her throat, inhaling her, choking on her. 

“I think I killed them,” I admitted with a hysterical giggle. 

“I think… something happened at that party, and I don't know, man, I think I snapped. I butchered them. I think I killed Kaz, then Imogen, and it fucked me up! Like I'm in some *serious* denial right now, and I’m having a psychotic break, because there is no way it’s normal to hear someone’s heartbeat. To *smell* them.” 

I didn’t realize I was crying, perched on the table, my jaw clamped around her neck, feeling nothing. Fucking nothing. I was starving for something so out of reach, that didn’t exist. I pulled back, spitting her out.

“I can hear every fucking beat, ma’am,” I whispered. “I can feel your blood rushing through your veins, and I shouldn’t be able to, because that is actually fucking insane! So, I’m mad, right? Tell me I’m going mad.”

I moved closer, close enough for her scent to suffocate me. I grabbed her, shaking her once, twice, until her brain was leaking out of her ears. “Fuck. Tell me I’ve finally lost my mind and everything will make sense again, right?”

I didn’t mean to plead, to beg, and yet somehow I was, hands together, tears stinging my eyes. “*Please* just tell me I’m crazy.”

Leaning back, I gasped for breath and gagged on her scent.

I could never find the right smell. Taste. Instead, I was choking on mediocrity.

“Oh, and here’s the kicker! I almost forgot - there’s a girl’s head in my freezer.”

I flopped back into my chair, spent, arms limp.

“So yeah! I’m pretty sure I murdered my roommates.”

“Mr. Beck?”

I blinked. The cop was in front of me, brows furrowed. 

“Well?”

Instead of answering, I stood and stuffed my hands in my pockets. “So, are we done here?”

Her expression darkened, her lip curling. “Yes.” She pushed back her chair, dragging it noisily. 

Her heart started hammering again. 

“You're free to go,” she said. 

But she stood slowly and picked up the glass of milk. I thought she was going to throw it over my head, but instead, she handed it over, eyes hard. “Rowan, you're free to go if you drink the entire glass.”

I raised an eyebrow. “You want me to drink expired milk to prove my innocence?”

She folded her arms. “Drink it, Mr. Beck.”

A flicker of vulnerability hit me, my stomach twisting. 

Still, I grabbed the glass and downed it, forcing a smile through the pain. 

It was warm, sickly, and slid down my throat like stale vomit. 

I swiped my mouth and handed the glass back to her with a wide grin.

“Happy?” I turned away from her, well aware of the uptick in her heartbeat. As I reached the doorway, the carefully sculpted facade she had built began to splinter.

“I know you did it,” she said, rising as she gathered her notes and stained coffee mug. “You and them—Charlie Delacroix, Imogen Prairie, and the cult leader. You're devils.”

I ignored her, grabbed my jacket and phone from an awaiting cop, waved goodbye with an ironic curl in my lip, and left the station. It was a sunny day, but the sun was too bright, too *hot*, burning the back of my neck.

When I jumped into Kaz’s car and flicked on the radio, I grabbed a trash bag from the back seat, hurled up the glass of milk, and twisted the keys in the ignition. 

I checked my phone. 

Three missed calls from mom, and an uber eats email: “We haven't heard from you in a while!”

Ha. 

With one hand on the wheel, trying to get out of a disastrous parallel park, I scrolled through my texts and landed on a three-minute voice message from Kaz from a year ago. 

I cranked up the volume, settled into my seat, and let his voice wash over me as I drove home.

“Hey, so, I'm telling you this now so you don't forget later, but we've got a potential roommate coming to see us in the morning. You were up all night studying, but I need you to answer the door. I need you to be up, Rowan, and like, *conscious*.” 

He laughed, and I almost crashed the fucking car, fumbling with the wheel.

“What I'm trying to say is, like, please don't embarrass us in front of the new girl. Be nice—and I don't mean ‘condescending asshole’ nice. I mean actually nice. I'm counting on you.” 

He paused, and I reveled in the sound of his breathing.

“I’m making dinner tonight, so be home early. Also, there are like five plates in your room! I sound like your mom, but *please* bring them down. You have a literal ant farm on those leftovers on your floor.” I took a sharp turn, almost hitting a cat. 

“And Jesus Christ, Rowan, I know you're technically an adult, but can you stop inhaling all the cereal? You know those crispy crunch ones are Immie’s favorite, and I’m the one who gets the death threats.”

I could hear the smile in his voice. 

Then a pause. I knew he was losing his train of thought. I’d listened to it enough times to know every breath, every stumble. 

“Oh, shit. I’m losing my train of thought… Right! Dad’s trying to reach out again, so that’s fun. He sent me this message on Instagram that just said, ‘Son, I’m ready for you to become my right hand,’ which is… yeah. Doesn't that sound, like, super ominous?”

Kaz sighed like he could feel me rolling my eyes through time. 

He chuckled, and so did I, tightening my grip on the wheel. “I’ll… talk to you soon, alright?”

Yeah, Kaz. 

Speak to you soon. 

I came home to find a particularly annoying stray sitting on my doorstep. 

She wore a red sweater and jeans, long strawberry-blonde curls falling into narrowed eyes tracking me as I climbed the steps. 

The stray sat with her knees pulled to her chest, chin resting on them. I glanced at her briefly, fumbling with my keys.

""Have you been sitting here all day?""

She refused to meet my gaze, glaring down at her phone. This girl was the only person who didn't have one lick of scent.

“You locked me out.” she grumbled into her knees. 

I shrugged. “Well, yeah, I told you multiple times. The room is closed. Go home.”

With a twist of my key, the door swung open, and that all-too-familiar chill crept down my spine, like phantom fingers tracing my spine. I smiled as I stepped inside, letting my backpack fall to the floor.

“Hey, guys,” I greeted the empty hallway, the gaping crack that split the floorboards wide. I was convinced that, yes, my roommates were dead. 

And yes, somehow, they’d managed to haunt the house anyway. 

I waited for the door to slam like usual, but to my dismay, it stayed open, happily welcoming the so-called roommate inside. I slammed it shut myself.

When I was unceremoniously tugged backward, those spindly phantom fingers entangling with mine, I pulled myself free. 

“Nope,” I told them, kicking off my shoes. 

That creeping sensation followed me to the kitchen, ruffling my hair and blowing open my jacket. 

When the floor started to rumble under my feet, I finally turned to face them. 

“What is it?” 

A painting slipped off the wall, the light flickering above me. But I was used to it. 

One month ago, I would have burned the place down. 

I rolled my eyes, checking the head in the refrigerator. Yep. It was still there. “I told you I don't like this girl. She gives me weird vibes,” I said, grabbing a glass and sticking it under the running tap.

I drank half before my stomach revolted, and I vomited it all back up, bent over the sink. 

I thought I could stomach at least half a glass of water, but apparently, I was wrong. 

I didn't like admitting defeat, but standing hunched over my kitchen sink, unable to eat anything while being constantly fucking hungry for something I couldn't find, was pretty much rock bottom.

When the tap turned on, splashing me in the face, I groaned, swiping at my mouth.

“*Hilarious*, Imogen.”

My phone vibrated in my jeans. I pulled it out, slipping to the floor, my legs buckling. 

“Mom?”

“Rowan, why aren’t you answering your phone?”

Mom’s voice crackled through the static, and I had to jam my fist between my teeth to suppress an involuntary, painful sob. 

“Sweetie, are you sick? I’ve been calling all afternoon.”

“Uh, nope,” I managed to respond. “No, I’m fine. I’m just, um…” 

I scanned the kitchen: cracked walls and bloodstained floor tiles that I really needed to clean. Tipping my head back to stretch my neck, I caught the ancient language clumsily carved into the ceiling. 

“Decorating….?”

There was a pause. “Rowan, are you okay?”

""Yeah, I'm great! Um…"" My Thai was pretty rough. I hadn’t spoken the language in a while. I only spoke broken Thai with her. ""Sabai, sabai, Ma. I’m just tired, and college is, like, super stressful right now.”

I could already taste the water squirming back up my throat.

""How’s Charlie?"" Mom asked, as I lurched toward the sink, heaving up sour bile. “Rowan, are you sick? What's that sound?”

I washed my mouth out, gurgling. ""Hangover.""

I heard her sigh, soft and disappointed. “I told you not to drink so much.” 

She paused. “How is everyone? Oh! Tell Imogen I’ve got some clothes for her! Cute summer dresses I found the other day! Sweetie, I can’t wait to see you kids again. Charlie and Imogen… they’re perfect for you. I was talking to one of my colleagues yesterday, and I told her, ""My son has a boyfriend and a girlfriend!”

""Mom."" I muttered. 

""Sorry, Rowan, you're all grown up now, but I'm just so happy you've found people who make you happy! Charlie is such a sweet boy. Did you tell him how excited—”

Mom’s voice collapsed into white noise. My phone slipped from my hands when the scent hit me. It was thick, wet, and metallic, already dragging me to my feet.

*Threat.*

I lurched forward, my thoughts dizzy, almost drunk on the stink curling in the back of my throat and creeping into my nose. I was only half-aware of the presence around me fading, like Kaz and Imogen were either chasing the threat or being pulled back against their will.

“Hey!” I yelled, my voice breaking into an involuntary growl. “Didn’t I tell you to go ho—mmph!”

A clammy hand clamped over my mouth, a bag coming down over my head.

My body went slack, useless, as I was hauled over someone’s shoulder and carried outside—*where was the fucking stray?*

I was tossed into the trunk of a waiting car, the sound of my kidnappers’ voices muffled as they spoke in low tones. 

Panic kicked in. I rolled onto my stomach, desperate to throw myself out of the trunk. 

When I got a grip of them, I would snap their necks and drink them dry. 

Unlike the cop. I had restraint in the station. I was playing a character. 

These guys had broke into my house, so it was technically *their fault*. But before I could strike, they were ready, armed with lead pipes that forced me to freeze.. 

One of them unrolled duct tape, swiftly binding my wrists and legs. 

“Don't you fucking dare—” I said, before a strip of tape was promptly pressed over my mouth. 

For a moment, the two of them hesitated, staring down at me. 

I could smell them. 

One of them had a scent I recognized, their heartbeat steady, like they knew exactly what they were doing. 

Without warning, one of them pulled back their fist and punched me square in the face, sending me plunging into darkness.

No.

Not darkness.

It was a memory.

I was curled up somewhere enclosed (the same trunk?), my hands tied behind me, my mouth muffled with tape. But this time, I wasn’t alone. There was someone pressed against me, nose to nose.

It was a girl, her face bleeding into shadow. I could only make out her knees, uncomfortably pressed to her chest. 

She was tied up, just like me, dazed eyes flickering, fighting to drink me in. She leaned forward, lips breaking into a smile.

“Do you remember that show when we were kids?” she whispered, her voice slurred. “You know! The one with the, uhmmm…”

“Fuck off.” I laughed, rolling onto my back. “I’m not a fish.”

The girl laughed too, shuffling closer. 

“Can I touch it?” she asked, coming so close, her breath tickled my cheeks.

I scoffed.

“Touch *what*?”

Her eyes, wide and dilated, stared at me, unblinking. 

“Moonlight.” her expression crumpled. “The moon is…swimming in… your eyes.”

The memory jumped forward, like a faulty VCR.

I was being dragged into our house, its windows sealed with layers of tape. 

In the living room, a group of armed strangers surrounded me, guns raised like I was an animal. I could hear screaming upstairs. 

Imogen. I started towards the door, my heart in my throat, only to be yanked back by my hair. 

I hit the ground on my knees, my chest burning, agonizing pain running up and down my spine, a shriek clawing in my throat— *that wasn't mine*. 

The shrieks upstairs felt latched to me, like I could feel Imogen’s pain. 

I didn't realize I was screaming until I was slapped a fosos the face, so hard, I hit the floor, blood pouring from my nose. 

One of the intruders, a man with a bulging belly, grimy hair stuck under a baseball cap, stuck the barrel of his gun in my face, his lips curling into a snarl. 

He reached out, grabbed my chin, forcing me to look at him. “Rowan Beck,” he spat, sneering, “Little birdie told me you and your freak friends are devils.”

I laughed, and he punched me again. I spat blood in his face. 

“Oh, yeah,” I said. “That.” I heaved a breath. “Well, if you must know, I didn't become like this by *choice*.”

“Rowan!”

The voice, and the pain, hit me. 

I twisted around. Kaz was dragged into the lounge by his hair, hands taped behind his back. 

Dishevelled in jeans and a shirt, thick sandy hair hanging over his eyes. 

He wasn't looking at me. His eyes were frenzied, lips parted against a palm clamped over his mouth. 

“Don’t fuck with them,” he whispered, voice muffled by the hand. 

“They’ll—” His words cut off as his attacker pulled a knife and slashed his throat, shoving him to his knees. The pain hit, cold and cruel. I felt the knife go in. 

Felt his blood leaving him.

And I laughed.

“Oh, come on, guys! You can do better than that!” I giggled, hysterical, as Kaz hit the floor. “Why not slash tendons, hmm? Come on! Really kill him! Slice him apart, I dare you—”

The memory broke apart. 

Reality slammed into me. 

The trunk opened. I was scooped into someone's arms.

The town lake shimmered under a crescent moon.

I was dumped into the water. No way to swim, no way to save myself. 

I plunged, dragged down…

Down…

Down…


Until a hand grabbed mine and yanked me up, breaking the surface. 

The shadow dragged me to shore, limp in their arms. 

We hit the riverbank. I rolled onto my stomach, chest burning.

Blinking away water, I glimpsed the figure beside me.

Soaked. 

Gasping. 

Thick blonde curls glued to her face. My heart jolted. 

Something slimy crept up my throat.

""What is *wrong* with you?"" she shrieked,  squeezing water from her hair. 

It was the *stray*.

No.

The girl from the trunk. 

From the memory I didn’t remember.

The girl who said my eyes were moonlight.

I found my voice, trying to find my own breath.

""Wow. I'm *sorry* for being kidnapped,"" I managed to get out.

The stray stared at me for a moment, her eyes wide.

""What are you talking about?"" she whispered, and it was then, when I realized my hands and feet were free.

The girl leaned forward, eyes wild.

Context: I wrote this story with a specific idea in mind. My main character is meant to resemble an edge lord. So if she comes across as edgy, that’s intentional. It’s not my goal to glorify  one of those “get a load of this guy” types. She’s purposely written to be annoying and obnoxious. 

Blurb:  Lyra Bard has been called many things. A villain, a trickster, a chicken thief, a god killer, and, naturally, a man-eating ghoul. She’s had her fill of talentless bards warbling embellished nonsense and spurned lovers twisting the truth to soothe their wounded pride. If history insists on painting her as a monster, she might as well be the one holding the brush. With ink-stained fingers and a toothless grin, she sets out to write her story. A tale of drunken excess, fallen companions, reckless escapades, and a legion of enemies who still spit her name like a curse. 

Yet buried within the wreckage of many misdeeds lies another tale - of a stubborn little girl, too foolish or too headstrong to fear her, who, against all reason, nudges Lyra toward something she never expected: a moment of heroism. One that hurls her into a sea of politics, tangled with murderous knights of lotus who want to kill all things non-human, cunning queen conspiring to overthrow her lazy husband with seven dwarves, comely princesses with werewolf fetish, lusty eunuchs scheming for self interests, and ancient gods conspiring to start a holy war with the help of a hedonistic nun.

Chapter - 1 Do Vampires Dread Mosquito Bites?

All great stories have great beginnings; they often start with a meeting in a tavern or the arrival of a mysterious stranger in a town laden with outlaws. Mine, however, began six feet under, thanks to an attractive vampire with hair that blazed like a hearthfire.

 If this were a conventional biography, I would have begun with the incident where I devoured a ghoul’s heart, Devil bless his generous soul, and became immortal. But I choose not to. Who cares if a young lady became a trifle too famished to concern herself with social propriety? She has every right to, and people know it. All they need is a good story, and I intend to give them one.

 I’ll begin with the event that defined my career where I rose from the dead, or so those unaware of my peculiar talents would say. Buy them a drink, and they’ll say I crushed a man’s head with my bare hands. Toss them a coin, and they’ll swear I led dragons to slay a nun. Offer them a warm bed and a bucket to piss in, and they’ll claim I rode a winged horse to kill a rakish prince. All these legends. All these songs. They’re true.

 But they are just songs and legends that present the truth in a different light. Which is why I ask you, would you rather listen to those charlatans who twist my story for their own gain? Or would you rather hear it from me, a woman kissed on the arse by sweet Lady Misfortune? If your answer is the latter, then put on a glove and take my red right hand, for we’re about to hail a boat and set sail down this indomitable, never-ending river called Time. But if your answer is the former, I ask you why not? I killed old empire fanatics and hacked their god to bits, surely that counts for something. Now, hurry up, you reluctant sod, take my hand and heed my ignoble tale.



\*\*\*\*\*

Around fifty years ago, on a night when ponds shimmered with the soft hue of milky pearls and owls flirted with wide, lustful eyes, I found myself astride a rude black stallion, its hooves clattering on the cobbled path in the middle of a forest. The sound was loud enough to be a wake-up call to a Wendigo, ever in search of its greatest rival, yours truly, the greatest of all man-eaters.

My long, matted hair, caked with blood, danced in the cool night air, mirroring the rustle of the trees lining the road ahead. Among those trees, pointy-eared cunts lay in wait, their eyes tracking me. The first arrow came with the soft, buzzing hum of a honeybee as it sliced through the air. As I listened to the sound, the hairs on my body prickled like a frightened rooster’s. My hand, driven by instinct, shot out and caught the shaft inches from my face.

Some pointy-eared bastard let another arrow fly. Slicing through the mist, it struck my horse with a sickening thud, embedding itself deep in its skull. I was thrown off balance, crashing to the ground, my face landing in goat shit. The impact knocked the wind out of me, leaving me sprawled and gasping.

After what felt like an eternity, I slowly began to rise from that indignity, but a heavy boot slammed down on my back, pinning me hard against the cobblestones and forcing me to taste goat shit once again.

""The mighty ghoul under my boots,"" said a gravelly voice. ""I feel so honored.""

He lifted his boot off my body and whistled like a koel. Two men emerged from the bushes and hauled me to my feet, not for the cunt who had put his filthy boot on my back, but for the striking woman who made men think, Oh, seven blessings, she could do unspeakable things to me.

She walked toward me, silent as a snake in the grass, her visage… ahem… pardon me for the dreadful simile, like a petal with eyes of stone floating on a river of piranhas.

She approached, a cigar in her mouth, its smoke curling in foggy drifts. She was the kind of woman who could make a man jump into a pit of vipers by convincing him the alternative was far worse.

""You killed my brother?"" the elf asked, cold and direct. 

Ah, she was such a delight. People with that no-nonsense approach practically begged to have their feathers ruffled, and it is the birthright of every trickster to rile up such peculiar creatures. I held back and simply nodded in response. But still, common sense wasn’t my strongest suit, and so I couldn’t resist asking the triggering question.

""I killed a lot of brothers. Which one do you speak of?""

""The one whose cock you cut off and shoved into his mouth,"" she answered, her collected facade breaking with that twitch in her lips.

""Oh, you mean Lordling Cockless? That goat-fu,"" she struck me across the face, and I saw stars.

""Drag this whore to farewell grounds,"" she said, her gaze peeling away as if I were less than a worm. How hateful. But given what I did, I can't blame her.

""Sounds like a lovely place,"" I said. 

They dragged me through the forest, tying me to one of their scrawny horses. Poor bastards, those elves, they were once so glorious, riding shiny steeds! How the mighty have fallen! Centuries ago, they saw humanity as little more than dirt beneath their feet. Now look at those proud pointies, living in shitholes. Ah, those poor fuckers, so sad, so tragic, so melancholic and all those synonyms.

My pity only lasted until the horse jolted forward, dragging my body across the unforgiving earth. Twigs and jagged stones tore at my skin, ripping through flesh that reattached as quickly as it was shredded. I tasted blood, dirt, and things both familiar and foreign. I struck a root or two, my body jerking upward, bones snapping and rejoining in a brutal, nauseating rhythm.

Finally, when the moon reached its peak and ghosts roamed the earth to appear only to drunks, they stopped near a graveyard on a cliff overlooking their fragile settlement. The settlement, cobbled together from scraps of wood, metal, and cloth, flickered with sporadic lights, like dying fireflies, fairies imprisoned in lamps. These fairies dimmed now, their glow fading with the slow poisoning of their sacred tree, the source of all that powered elvish life.

Oh, those poor fairies, how dreadful it must be to be so charmingly queer and yet imprisoned in wretched lamps! How I yearned to free them whenever I saw them. Where does that desire come from? I often wondered, and the answer always lay in the memories I lost after devouring the ghoul heart. Sometimes, those memories return, and helplessness stirs my temper. But I quell it quickly with a single thought, Lady Fate is one horny bitch,

They untied me from the horse, and bound my hands as I knelt. ""Lady Fate is one horny bitch,"" I muttered, more to unsettle the elves than to temper my anger.

A swift kick to my face drove me into the wet grass, the taste of iron spreading across my tongue.

""Quiet,"" snapped the same elf who’d shoved me down, his boot still reeking of filth.

""W-what’s your name?"" I asked, spitting blood. ""You’ve got a remarkable kick. Seems only fair to know the name.""

""Kalantus, my lady. The name’s Kalantus,"" he said, giving a mock bow.

""Kalantus!"" I exclaimed, giggling like a lovestruck girl. ""Such a masculine name for such an unmasculine man. Hitting a woman like that, are you sure you’re not compensating for something?""

""Careful,"" he growled. ""We wouldn’t want that pretty face of yours ruined by common filth like me.""

""I am an immortal, you dumb fuck.” I said, and Kalanthus unsheathed his blade, pressing it to my cheek.

""You asked for it,"" he said, grinning with such evilness even  I would find comical.

""Enough!"" barked the she-elf. ""This one’s mine, Kalantus, mine!""

""Yes, Lady Lilia,"" he replied, backing immediately.  

""Ghoul blood would taste foul on your tongue, vampire,"" I said.

The red-haired elf unsheathed her cinquedea. She held it in her hand as though it had sprouted from her palm. What an honor, indeed, to meet one’s end at the hands of such a ravishing creature, with red hair that complemented her unblemished fair skin, and blue eyes that shone like opals. She was perfect.

Unfortunately, I do not have the pleasure of dying normally, and the elf was well aware of the fact, she had planned accordingly. She did not prepare an elaborate ritual or embark on a long journey to a volcano carrying my corpse. Instead, she did it the old-fashioned way of torturing immortals, placing me in a casket and burying me six feet under.

As her merry band of elves dug, the she-elf spoke. ""You love the sound of your own voice, don’t you? Fine, let’s play a game. I’m going to ask you some questions, and you have to act like a buffoon so I can inflict pain that you crave so much.""

""Wonderful, ask away,"" I said.

""Who asked you to kill my brother?""

""The one who farts in roses an' speaks in po'try,"" I slurred, as if I were one bottle away from fucking an undesirable.

She growled and carved a line across my cheek. ""Name,"" she asked, her voice sharp like thorns. ""I demand a name.""

""He’s a very important person. Are you willing to take that risk?""

A quick flash of the knife parted my flesh in a symmetrical line, revealing the muscle beneath. As the skin healed, the blood stopped before it could mark my pale cheek entirely.

""You’d need to carve through a hundred men, hard sons of bitches who collect elvish scalps like prized trophies.""

""‘Black Company’ she spat, disgusted.

“Heard they were the ones who chopped your father’s head off and stuck a pig’s on instead. Creative pricks, aren’t they?” I said, cackling. I let my cackle drag longer than necessary to play her little game.

Then I saw her face. Fury twisting her fine features into a mask of a wounded lion. It’s a sin for such a fine facade to be marred by such dark emotions.

""I knew your brother was born from the corpse of your hanged mother. Is that right? Felt right to kill him that way,"" I said, giving her my special crooked smile, reserved for those who want to rend me asunder.

She pounced on me, slamming me to the ground and knocking the wind out of me. Then, with a primal scream, she slashed my face over and over. Each cut brought a brief flash of pain before it healed almost instantly. I laughed through the entire ordeal, unintentionally, more lunatic than usual. I just couldn’t control it.

“What the fuck is wrong with her?” whispered a she-elf whose facade and good name elude my memory.

The vampire elf, exhausted, collapsed beside me, panting, each breath escaping as a thin plume of mist.

""I... I killed him because I wanted to,"" I said, a smile trembling on my lips even as pain ripped through my body. ""The money’s... it’s good and all, but... but with a good conscience, I... I must speak with utmost veracity, if... if he’d been a good lay, I wouldn’t... wouldn’t have bothered killing him. Do you want to know his final wo-”

Sweet ol’ Kalanthus stomped me in the face, forcing my head back into the mud. He knelt down, scooped up a handful of horse shit, and smeared it across my face, slow and calm, like a virtuoso finishing his masterpiece.

I tried to spit it out, but it landed back on my face as a wet, dried splatter that clung to my skin. I wiped it away with the back of my hand, smearing it more than cleaning it.

  
  


“Delightful,” I muttered, the bitter taste still lingering on my tongue.

The red-haired elf rose to her feet and brushed the dust off her clothes with an air of dignity. The kind only the privileged possess, accompanied by that subtle annoyance at the dirt that dared to cling to them. It must have felt nostalgic for her to act so dignified in days when there was no dignity left for her kin. It makes sense, I suppose, as people say: elves feel more deeply than anyone else; everything they do is infused with passion. Profess your love to them through actions, and you may bask in the gratitude of multitudes. But slight them even slightly, and all of mankind cannot shelter you from their wrath.

""Kalanthus,"" she whispered, her voice cold and low, casting that invisible thread of authority that makes you quiver without your knowing.

Kalanthus stepped forward, his stride carrying all the meekness of a sheep about to be slaughtered.

""Yes?"" he croaked. A sudden punch to the throat and a roundhouse kick to the face sent him sprawling. The vampire elf strode over to him like a tiger approaching its dying prey and planted a foot on his chest.

""You've been an insolent little fuck for quite some time,"" she hissed, her voice low and venomous. She spat on his face—lucky bastard—and said, ""When I command you to speak, you speak. When I order you to move, you move. When I adore you to shit, you shit!""

She knelt down, her red hair dancing in the wind like rage personified. “Do you understand?” she whispered, her voice cold and low.

""Y-yes,"" he croaked. ""I-it wasn’t... wasn’t m-my in... in-in-intention t-to question your judgment.""

""Good,"" she said, her face calm, having made her point. She stood up and turned to me with contempt in her eyes.

  
  


""Deal with her,"" she commanded, gesturing to her servants. Behind her, Kalantus muttered under his foul breath, ""Fuck you, bitch. I'll kill you myself."" My enhanced senses caught all of it. The way he said it sounded like a promise meant to be kept. It would have been good to know how that went for him. But alas, they buried me six feet under, and I never found out. Every day, as I lay buried, they poured spider acid—a substance I heal from slowly—into my casket through a pipe they had placed when burying me. In that casket, I suffocated in a torturous, ponderous rhythm, yearning for sweet release, and yet, contradictingly, I also felt the desire to survive, like all mankind. To be suffocated, yet without taking the hand of death as it extended its skeletal fingers, whispering like a shameless vixen, *“Touch me, touch me,”* felt unnatural. Wrong. Do you understand?

After two years of suffering, one day the usual prick did not come to pour acid. In his place came the wendigo. In tears, it tore open the casket, and I felt both bitter and thankful. Then, with its emaciated hands, it picked out each maggot, concern flickering in its hollow white eyes. You want to imagine it, I suppose, to haunt your dreams, perhaps? I can fulfill that desire. Imagine a starving wolf, but with antlers twisted like gnarled branches and sharp bones protruding from its emaciated chest. Disgusting? There is more. Think of its skin stretched tight over its face, long limbs, and hands, with hollow eyes of hunger and malice. It moves on hind legs, its patchy fur blacker than night, and claws sharp enough to tear through flesh and bone like the silk of a blushing groom.

It poured flesh and blood from a cask onto my lips, and my body began to heal. With the maggots out of my flesh, I stood up in all my naked glory, gazing upon the tall monstrosity.

“Did you a a red haired vampire elf?” I asked.

""I slay not mine kin, yet thou art an exception."" It said.

""Can you tell me if you killed an elf that was uncharacteristically ugly?"" I asked eagerly.

""Nay, but I have laid curses most foul: mothers to devour their daughters, sisters to consume their brothers, fathers to feast upon their sons, and neighbors to rend one another asunder.""

""You should have spared the children. What in the name of Lilet’s cock is wrong with you?"" I snapped, genuinely upset.

""I have healed thee, that thou might rise and face me in battle! Stand, thou bosom friend, and fight!""

""I am naked, you mutt! I have neither sword nor armor with which to fight you.""

I heard someone approaching from behind and turned around with the alertness of a feline. Standing there was a young elf, dark-skinned and handsome, if you could overlook the axe lodged in his skull and the unsettling red glow of his eyes. He tossed a curved, single-edged sword adorned with elvish runes at my feet and began to strip. It was an act I would have watched giggling, had he not been dead.

Yes, indeed, I'm a necrophagic creature with boundless lust, but I am not perverse; my lust is solely reserved for all things humanoid that are willing to have long romantic walks with a croissant in hand or a cheap bottle of vodka.

He bore scars that could make any maiden who dreamed of chivalrous heroes gasp, lassies like yours truly, of course. The sleeping beast beneath his torso. The magic wand that bewitched bitches like me was a sight to behold. As he walked, his wand swayed up and dowb.

As much as it pained me to do so, I looked beyond him and saw red pinpricks glowing in among the trees. Five elves, I guessed without counting, for five is the limit of a wendigo's tether.

I put on the tattered tunic trousers and boots, then picked up the weapon.

“Beautifully made.” I said, swinging about the sword with practiced ease.

""Six, including this naked one? Oh, how noble. I’m not the same graceful girl I once was."" I asked, turning to the wendigo.

""I am not unjust. I shall release them upon thee, and when thou hast recovered , I shall face thee in turn.""

""How generous. Tell me, fellow fiend, no matter what happens here, you wouldn’t lay a finger on me, correct?”I said approaching it.

""Deceit is unknown to me; 'tis the way of men alone. I do as I speak.""

""Hope you are right!"" I said, pirouetting on my feet. With a swift swing of my sword, I sliced through its long limbs. That poor trusty fucker caught off guard and crashed to the ground—his head striking the tombstone with a satisfying thud.

“I am no human, but I do share all their vices and none of their virtues, so you should have thought of me doing this mutt. Now, you promised to fight only when the time is right, so you better keep it! O noble creature who knows no deceit” I said, slashing the abdomen of the elf who had so generously stripped off their clothes for me.

The other five stepped out of the darkness, carrying with them weapons of opportune, scythe, swords, rakes, even pans!

The man with the pan pounced like a cat, and I swung my sword and cut his head clean off. His body skidded across the ground, his hand still clutching his sooty weapon.

I sensed movement behind me, but it was too quick to react. I still tried, turning, but not fast enough to avoid the blonde-haired she-elf whose rake punched into my side.

Pain flared, but I caught the weapon before it drove deeper and snapped it with my forearm. My senses warned me again. I ducked low, feeling the air whistle as a hammer passed. The she-elf wasn’t so lucky. The wild swing caught her in the head, which burst like an overripe tomato, showering the ground in brain pulp.I pivoted and opened the stomach of the brute, who collapsed like a rag doll. But before I enjoyed my victory, a kick to my head sent me crashing to the ground.

The one who kicked me wore armor made of mismatched parts and held a longsword in his hand. I tried to get up, but a child with a dagger leaped on top of me and stabbed me in the eye. The brat tried to pry the dagger out to stab me again. As I struggled to get him off, the armored elf bent low and slid his sword through my cheeks, the blade cutting into my mouth and emerging from the other side.

I pulled the broken rake from my side and drove it into the child's head, just as the brute withdrew his sword. Shoving the dead kid off me, I rolled away from brute's mighty swing that left a deep gash on grass and sprang to my feet.

“Your love for prolonged cruelty is my blessing,” I said to Wendigo, smiling as the wound sealed itself. I could imagine how unsettling it must be to naïve young bloods eager to slay the big, bad Lyra the Ghoul. Those brave soldier boys who had managed to land a similar cut had watched in horror as it mended before their eyes.

I always gave them a chance to prove themselves after the defeat by offering them two easy choices: balls or lives. Surprisingly, many chose their balls. It was a trick question, and those foolis lost their lives!

The armored brute advanced, swinging for my ribs. I moved out of reach and, quick as a cat catching a rat and closed the distance before he could comprehend. A flash of movement, and my blade sliced toward the underside of his wrist. His grip faltered, the longsword dipping in his grasp.

Seizing this opening, I struck again, driving my blade into the gap between his pauldron and breastplate. I wrenched it free, tearing his muscle in the process. He staggered back, and then his knees buckled as blood spilled down from his side. Just to be sure, I picked up a rake, removed his helmet and stabbed him in the face.

“That was beautiful and a much needed warm up for staying still for so long. How long was I out again?” I asked approaching the wendigo who started to heal its legs.

“Two summers,” the wendigo said.

“Two goddamn years? I suppose it’s too late to fulfill that spy’s dying wish to warn King Vasley of a possible snow elf invasion on Vransy.”

""Why dost thou offer aid to one thou claim’st no care for? Was it perchance empathy thou didst feel?""

""Empathy? Don’t be ridiculous!"" I said, more sharply than I expected. “I care for rewards and nothing more.”

""Carest thou naught for what doth befall? The purpose of mortals is lost to mine understanding, yet thou wert once of their kind, dost thou truly scorn all thought of a higher calling?""



""I don’t know about this empathy you speak of. Helping the kingdom earn me some coin to satisfy my desires for pleasure and wine!”

“Carest thou naught for mankind?“Desirest thou not to be as they art? Thou speakest as they do.””

“Yes, I do not care for the upheavals that so frequently occur in the cycles of mankind. Men resent me for my nature, and their insults may flow freely, but in the end, only I shall remain. So, why bother to be like them?”

""I hath beheld a vision, a dream of thee as a maiden fair. Each time I dost taste thy blood, memories of thy past life do unfold ere mine eyes. Dost thou desire to know what thou once wert? Wouldst thou learn of the love, the heartbreak, and the time when thou didst possess a soul?""

I drew my sword and leveled it at the cur’s head. “Hold your tongue, dog. I’ll not suffer your prattle any longer.”

""Wilt thou slay me? Nay, thou shalt not, my love, thou shalt not. I am all thou hast.""

I wanted to drive that sword in and end it then and there. Perhaps it would have been for the best. But history isn’t made by doing all the right things. Sometimes you must not listen to a rational mind that urges you to kill the mutt conspiring to ruin your pleasure-seeking. Instead, give it a kiss, go seek out your salad days, and end up meeting a charming little girl who would change your life forever.

**Chapter - 2  Can a riest whip the devil out of you?**  
  


Whenever I commit morally repugnant acts that are vile enough to make even a man with balls of steel gag and faint, I seek penance like any God-fearing woman. When I visit church, I take extra care to hide my beauty from the lecherous eyes of priests, veiling myself from head to toe in the silk noblewomen cherish to keep their skin fair.

I would step into the booth and talk at length about all the things I had done. Almost always, the priests twisted my words and branded me a devil. 

The worst of them was a handsome priest who, in the throes of lovemaking, kept shouting, “Forgive me, Lord, I have sinned!” over and over, all the while overcompensating by doing far more than I had asked for. He, in fact, lasted quite a while for a man forbidden even the taste of a woman’s lips.

When it was over, we lay naked—gasping and sweating—my skin sticky with heat . I turned my head, with my dark hair plastered to my pale face and asked,

""Do you do this to all the women who come for confession, or did you just accidentally slip your dick in today?""

He ignored me and sat up, his eyes fixed on the dancing flames of the hearth. I asked if he’d care for another round. instead of shouting, “Yippie yippie hurrah hurrah!” for being so lucky, he burst into tears. 

I approached him with what may have been concern flickering in my eyes and gave a reassuring pat on his flaccid pecker. 

""It’s not the size that matters. It’s how you use it. And You, my my holy friend, fucked like a man of dedication, focus, and sheer fucking will."" I ejaculated.

He recoiled as if I were a leper and stammered, “You… you used the devil’s magic! You demon whore, stay away from me!”

""Aww, sweetie. You give me too much credit. It seems God has blessed you, priestie. You should cherish it.""

He stumbled out of bed, backing away like a cornered hare, taking frantic little steps, his balls bouncing with each one. He accidentally bumped into a table, and a butter knife clattered to the floor. He  lunged for it, clutched it in both of his trembling, pale hands that never seen the sun. 

""Fine, you whorish chameleon,"" I said, raising my hands in surrender. ""There’s no need for violence.”

“Stand back, you devil. You’ve ruined me.” He said, inching closer.

""Fine, fine, fine,"" I said, letting out a deep sigh. Then I poked my thumb at my chest. ""The devil will do your bidding. I’ll tell them that I besieged you with devilish charm! You’ll be forgiven, and I’ll take the blame.""

I noticed his pecker was as downcast as his eyes. He took a hesitant step forward, gripping the butter knife with trembling hands.

“It’s… it’s… it’s your own damn fault. You demon whore! If I let you leave, my life is over!” Those cruel, cruel words spilled from his bite-worthy, plump lips, striking me like an arrow loosed by a cherubic angel.

“You’re underestimating how understanding people can be,” I said, stepping closer. “I’ll go tell everyone how I dropped your pants with the sight of dangling breasts. The dirty old men nodding to themselves would say, ‘It’s natural for a young man to have a strong appetite.”

I looked up, folding my hands in mock contemplation. ""Or maybe I’ll compose a song about it, and the title will be 'Lyra and Priest’s Pizzle.'""

I shook my head. ""No, that’s a terrible title. How about Holy Sausage and Demon Harlot? That’s perfect! Now, how should the lyrics go?""

I grabbed my lute at the bed and strummed it once, letting the sound fall as gracefully as rock-hard goat shit.

 

Kneel for eel,

 forsake the Lord,

Moans and hymns in sinful rhyme,

Bless thy breasts with blasphemous lips.

 

At that point, he couldn’t take it anymore. My feminine brilliance had become a needle, pricking at his fragile ego. In a burst of jealous rage, he lunged at me, desperate to butcher the great Lyra Bard with a weapon that could strike fear into cheesecakes.

I responded to his daring attack by stepping aside, and he slipped on the spilled wine. It was entirely my fault, I knocked it over in excitement when he admitted he wanted to suck my toes.

He went down hard, his throat slamming against the sharp edge of the coffee table with a sickening crunch. A wet, choking sound escaped his lips as his body twitched, fingers grasping at something. My waist, perhaps, for a waltz or to perform one of those vaginal massages doctors recommend. His mouth hung open. Was it for a kiss? A jest? He went still before he could answer any of those questions.

At the time, watching his lifeless, naked body, the philosopher in me murmured,

""The soul is a fragile thing, caged by mortality like a flame cupped in hands."" Then I closed his eyes, my fingers moving like the soft graze of a silk curtain.

To honor his dying wish, I stabbed myself with the butter knife.

""You are dead, devil,"" I proclaimed, giggling like a boy who triumphed in mischief. ""You can harm me no more, seduce me no more.""

I imagined how it would’ve gone had I been a mortal woman. He would have finished the job by stabbing me twice or thrice, unleashing a sanguine tide. Then he would’ve collapsed beside me, gasping for breath like a fish out of water.

 Once his strength returned, he’d rise to his feet, crack his fingers, grab my corpse by the legs and drag me out. Then he would’ve shoveled a massive heap of earth to bury me six feet under.

Afterward, he would go about his life as if the entire ordeal had been a nightmare conjured by an emissary of the devil. Justifications such as—*she deserved it, she was asking for it, she didn’t know when to shut up, yada yada yada*—would pile upon one another, growing into a mountain built on a single deplorable memory, until it all became a lie painted by a stranger.

Anyhow, none of it happened, it would’ve done me no good to dwell on all my imaginings which were as bendy as a wick, easy to snuff out. And so once I hurt myself enough, I left his body to rot and made a vow: never fuck a priest again and always go for the nun.

I kept that promise and only met priests to gabble about what I had done and what I would do in future. I had one such talk with a priest right after I came out of my two-year imprisonment in the coffin.

“Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.” I began, my voice measured, reverent yet heavy. “It’s been too long since my last confession, almost two years. My last confession was to old Father Uberto, a man who thought little of me. He called me evil. Devil incarnate. So tell me, Father, am I irredeemable?”

“I have heard of you, Lyra. Men spoke of your deeds quite often in those taverns I frequent. I won’t be judging you like those people. The Lord has guided me to this calling to understand you and love people like you. People who need help.”

“Will you make love to me?”

The priest’s eyse widened a second and then he let out a loud, hearty laugh. “I have made love to enough women, girl. I am old and ugly now. If I were younger and godless, perhaps I might have considered it. But right now all I can do now is listen. Speak your mind, and I will listen.”

I told him everything I had done. The short version, not the long one detailing my exploits, like stealing the trinkets of Crows and ruining the lovemaking of Pigs, important events. And It took me less than a day, more than half a day, but slightly less than evening to tell all of it.

When I was done, he let out a yawn and asked, “You told me what you’ve done. Do you have any plans on what to do next?”

I was a bit taken aback, most would have called me irredeemable, but this one was willing to listen and learn about the splendiferous path I wished to tread

“I don’t know, Father. I always have a plan, but not today. I am hoping you’d suggest something. The more vile, the better.”

“Unfortunately, I cannot speak of nefarious ideas. I am a holy man now,” the priest said.

“Good treachery needs privacy,” I replied. “And the hand of God is always hovering over this sacred place. Nevertheless, I’m disappointed in you, priest. I never took a man of your station to be such a bore. You didn’t even bother to repeat the pious nonsense priests always spout. Something like, *‘Do not eat the flesh of man. If you truly repent, you should starve yourself to death, for your existence is cursed. Whip yourself whenever you lust after a married man.’*”

“Unfortunately, such a personality is not a costume I can wear. Some people aren't good at making masks. You are not so different. You cannot go against your nature, can you? How can a ghoul like you do anything but eat a man's flesh?” the priest asked.

“I tried vegetables once,” I said, sticking out my tongue with a grimace. “Made me sick. How do you people eat that?”

He ignored my question and offered one of his own. “Yet even so, you still managed to put on a mask. Why Lyra? Why do you refrain from loving yourself?”

“What? Love myself? What are you, some kind of homo?” I asked, genuinely stupefied by such outrageous questions.

“Why do you resist seeking pleasure with sincerity?” he asked again.

I cackled loud and long. “Th–Tha–That w-was f-funny! I h-haven’t—-hah—-heard a j-joke that g-good in—ohhhhh–a long time!” I wiped a tear from my eye, still laughing. “Pleasure—ah, it’s the one thing I crave most. And lucky me, I get my fill every day. Tell me, priest—does my spirit grow fat from all the pleasure I get?”

The priest did not speak, even after I respectfully ceased my laughter. Overcome by boredom, I began counting aloud. One, two… and on it went, until six hundred sixty-nine—the number at which he finally spoke.

“I will tell you a story.” He declared, sounding very proud. 

""A story? Now we’re talking! I love stories, can’t get enough of them! Even if they are bad. I am so desperate for entertainment I will of course be very happy to consume any shit you might deign to squeeze into my face from the holy buttocks,"" I said and clapped my hands, mayhaps with a sparkle in my eye. "" Hey, can I ask you something?""

I didn’t wait for his response and asked. ""Is it one of *those* stories, where good, kind girls get rewarded with a fair-haired and fair skinned prince with a cute little butt?""

""Something like that,"" he said.

I sat cross-legged on the cushioned seat, my eyes alight with childlike wonder. “Go on tell me what is it about,”

""It is a tale that disappoints both optimists and pessimists alike—a tale of faith.""

""Pray tell me if this is a story about a blasphemous man finding faith in God after years of raping and pillaging non-belivers. Such tales will ignite the devotee in my heart.""

""No, it is a tale about someone who sought love. A story I tailored just for you.""

""Oh my! A story tailored just for me? You’re making me blush! I even got: what do men say while watching that play,  Dandy Baron Barbarian? They get goose pimples! Yes, goose pimples. I’ve got them. Go on, Father, tell me the story. You got my full attention,"" I said, leaning forward, eyes focused on the purple curtain. 

At the time, I didn’t realize the priest was a man who spoke with two retractable tongues—one angelic, one devilish. Twisted together, they wove this particular tale—and in doing so, the priest became the perfect embodiment of God: the perfect blend of blasphemy and faith.

Whether it’s only a few days, couple weeks, or up to 6+ months, I thought it might be worth creating a thread where people share what’s worked for them in the past when they’ve had no other choice but to go off meds.

Circumstances aside, any lifestyle changes, supplements, alternatives, anything that you’ve implemented in your life when you’ve had no other choice but to be off meds for X period of time.

It’s great to see other users in the comments of other threads, helping to brainstorm how someone might be able to access supply again, so I reckon here we focus on the scenario of “no other choice but to be off meds” for whatever period of time, and what you did that helped you manage :)

I have only been on meds 5 months and haven’t been in this circumstance yet, but I’m already finding the coffee has become a part of my regime as an alternative to IR meds if, say, I only need an hour’s boost or want to switch states into a rest and digest phase.

I had a bad epidural given during my labor that caused the CSF leak. Doctors said they had to wait 24 hours to assess and determine if it was a leak and if I should get a blood patch. I went ahead with the first blood patch and it gave me immediate relief with lingering pressure but I was given terrible discharge advice and probably took things too far after the first day of recovering. This lead to me having to go to the hospital again because of the low pressure symptoms: felt like my head was caving into my neck and I could barely hold my neck up when I stood or sat vertically. Had to be bed ridden and laying flat for relief.

The doctors agreed to do a second patch and this time the person who did the patch was more experienced. I didn’t feel anything going in and it was done swiftly so I was very hopeful. It’s been 24 hours after the second attempt and I’m started to notice symptoms resurfacing: when I sit out of bed I have a brief(less than 10-15 seconds) sensation of a headache forming. It’s not as intense as the initial pain I felt. This pain happens as I’m rising from laying down into a sit position. And it goes away by the time I stand up completely. I also have a sensation of fluid moving down the inside of my head in the backside, it feels as if there’s something flowing. Anyone else feel this? Lastly, I noticed there’s sometimes a constant light throbbing in the back of my neck at the base of my head; it’s not painful but feels like it’s the start of the neck stiffness without the pain. This is when I am laying down. I have been taking Motrin as advised by my doctors but moving forward I’m going to stop. I also had coffee today and I’m thinking these have contributed to Rebound High Pressure??

I’ve learned a lot so far from this sub so I wanted to see if others have experienced these symptoms and what the recovery period looks like. It’s hard because I have a newborn and I’m trying to still breastfeed; I’ve been pretty successful with breastfeed laying down so far. What steps should I take? I’ve stopped taking Motrin and I’m taking tylenol. I’m going to do the lay flat routine through this weekend.

1kc0n6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kc0n6n/aio_because_my_friend_keeps_ghosting_me/,AIO because my friend keeps ghosting me,"This is a throwaway account.

Back, some twenty years ago, I had a friend named “Doug.”  Doug was a year and half younger than me, graduated high school the year after I did, and we ended up working together at the local grocery store.  He went to college about an hour away and would work weekends.  I was a townie, dipping in and out of college.

He was my best friend, but I also understood that I wasn’t *his* best friend.  Make sense?  Anyways, we hung out.  Watched movies, read books, went to the comic shop, got coffee, had drunken college adventures, all that.  Doug was never afraid to give me shit about what I was doing wrong with my life, or what he just disagreed with.  I had a girlfriend that I eventually got engaged to.  He had a string of relationships, some better than others.

After a couple of years, he graduated college and went to law school.  He left the grocery store and I continued to work there for another two years.  We saw less of each other, but that was kinda that phase of our lives.  He was living and working further away, getting his law degree and building his career.  I was working and starting my family.

We would still chat, not nearly as much.  He got married, had two kids of his own.  (I also have two kids.  Ironically we both had daughters).

But in the past few years, he’s moved closer to town.  He’s five minutes away.  He has a stressful, but successful job that I’m proud of him for. 

For the past several years, he’s been ghosting me.

I’ll text him, see if he wants to get breakfast.  Nothing.

Coffee.  Nothing.

Beers.  Nothing.

Even pre-pandemic, we would *occasionally* do these things, but even then, it was only if I suggested it.  He would never reach out to me.

I’m part of a historical organization in town and I’m really proud of the work I do there.  Whenever there’s a community event and I know that he’s going to be there, I’ll reach out to him and ask him to stop by the exhibit or booth.  Nothing.

I saw him once last year and that was because I was able to finagle my way into seeing Dune 2 with him and some mutual friends.  A rarity. 

The only time he ever talks to me is when I have a “legal issue” I need to talk to him about.  Also a rarity.

For the longest time, I just figured he was busy.  Busy with his young family, with his job, with his siblings and parents, with his other friends.

But you know what really made me think that maybe he just doesn’t care?  That maybe he’s just . . . outgrown me?

My 40^(th) birthday.  This was about two years ago.

I let him know what the plans were.

I let him know that it would mean a lot to me if he came.

I gave him plenty of lead time.

I asked him to confirm two weeks ahead.

A week before the party, he said “maybe.”

The day before, a Friday, he said he couldn’t make it because his daughter was sick.  Got it.  Perfectly valid.  Completely understandable. 

Saturday.  Party.  I was disappointed he wasn’t there, but still had a good time.  After the party, I got on Instagram and lo and behold, his wife posted a picture from just a few hours ago.  They were on a date.

They could have stopped by.  They could have called. 

Anything.

Just nothing.

And then to just post on social media.  Like he didn’t say anything to her about it.

Since then, I’ve tried to reach out a few times, but the answer is always the same.  Silence.  Maybe “when?” and then no response to my suggestions. 

I’ve never told him how much that hurt or asked him why he doesn’t respond.  I don’t blow him up with text messages every day.

I was just looking forward to being middle aged with him, having beers and bitching about Trump and talking about our families.  I just miss having him as a friend and I just feel like . . . he doesn’t.

He was my best friend and all I want is to get a beer with him once or twice a year.

Hell, I’d just settle for a response to my text messages.

So am I overreacting?  It’s 12:30 on a Wednesday night and I’m complaining on Reddit about how my friend doesn’t talk to me and it feels just . . . pathetic. ",2,1746075097.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

Although after the Play Store commission and Indian Taxes, I would be left with money for a coffee or 2, I'm glad as things at least started.   
Now I'm not sure if the app will grow good or will die down like the rest of its brothers - but let's see I'll keep you updated. 

The way of marketing was mostly reddit and some youtube posts.   
  
If anyone of you is interested, this is the [Link to the App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arpit.tarot_app) on Play Store.  
Apart from that I also have another app for which I am hopeful. It is called HeyMystica and it's just 10 days old and have already generated 10 USD in revenue. You can find that app on [Play Store ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arpit.manifest)and [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/heymystica-manifestation-app/id6744979873?platform=iphone).

1kc0msd,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kc0msd/why_do_i_31m_still_feel_this_strongly_about_my/,Why do I [31M] still feel this strongly about my [30F] wife?,"Hi. I''m going through a very complicated spell in my life and relationship with my wife of 5 and partner of 11 years. A little background, we met long ago and yes, we were children, but have had a very happy relationship and fortunate life. We never had issues communicating, or of any other kind \*except\* one time which I will detail below, as I feel it is relevant.

So, last year was the worst year of our lives. Everything that could have went wrong, did - My wife who is an excellent employee was on the shortlist for cost cutting, she managed to hang on because she was pregnant, we started trying that fall and were over the moon, and a few weeks after we lost our 10-week old pregnancy. I feel like this drove her off the deep end and made her more extreme and unstable on her views, including the medical field, which she now doesn't trust therapists or doctors of any kind. But it is understandable, we grieved together so much, the excitement of losing our first child and all the new feelings as new parents disappeared... gone in an instant. We worked through this and supported each other, I gave her my full attention and care, and she hers. I can't imagine the shock and pain she went through - but ultimately, the doctors said we're okay, and it's a normal thing to happen with your first pregnancy. We kept trying, unsuccessfully.

Then, three months or so after, I lost my finger in a freak accident with my wedding ring called ring avulsion.

This is probably the biggest mistake in a chain of mistakes, I was traumatized, had some PTSD from having my finger ripped off my hand, and it took me a few months to get back to feeling normal, months that could have been weeks if I seeked a therapist. But I didn't identify with the one I saw, and I worked through things myself. This put strain on our marriage, as I was present and loving, but in a more subdued way. By this, concretely, I mean I would still go on day dates with my wife, walk our dog, planned a few trips but I also didn't feel as social because of the shame, so I wasn't very enthused about for example going out clubbing or felt like 'having fun'. The romance definitely suffered and it made my wife start resenting me, from what best I could gather.

So, about a month ago I noticed she would hide in corners around the house and avoid me. We had a trip coming up to Hawaii which I was super psyched about, she had won it through work all expenses paid for two. I asked her what's wrong, if she wanted to talk, and after pushing for it she admitted she needed time alone and she wasn't taking me on this trip because she didn't know how she felt about us anymore. I felt like the earth opened up and swallowed me whole, it came out of nowhere - I frequently like to check in on how we're doing. We never had a discussion, she never raised a concern, gave an ultimatum or had a serious talk with me. She pointed out our relationship felt less deep and our love was more constant and less a high, that she cares for me in other ways other than just romantically now, and complained about how much time I spent playing videogames, and that I feel unavailable. I apologized and said: okay, if that bothers you, here's what I'm doing - I'll cut down from the 1-2h I would play at night, I had just gotten into Baldur's Gate 3 and I loved it, but it's obviously not as important as our household.

I felt very hurt being left behind and it took me a while to accept she wanted to go on the trip alone, but eventually, I relented and let it go. I had a pretty good time by myself for those two weeks, actually. I got some work done on my degree and at actual work, cleaned the house and reconnected with some friends so it wasn't the worst thing in the world and I hope she had fun, too, looking forward to planning our own vacation together.

She comes back, and she feels the same way. I keep trying to understand and talk, and it only drives us apart.

It got to a point where it just isn't working. She puts up walls, it's clear she doesn't love me anymore, and she's emotionally hurtful. She told me today all the little things added up, such as I'm not ambitious and she doesn't feel financially safe if she has a kid with me because I don't earn enough for her to stay home. I don't know how relevant this is, but I'm the youngest senior manager at the branch of the fortune 50 I work at, I don't get paid as much as she does doing account management, but I'm in the top 5% earners in my country, I get by ok... And I'm doing another degree to be ready in case we move or to keep growing, in addition to her having 80% of her salary covered by the state for two years during maternity. We are in no shape or form hurting financially, even though we're not rich.

She also crossed a line and said she thinks I'm clumsy (fair, I am lol), and I don't behave 'manly' enough. When confronted, she offered no examples. This felt particularly hurtful, because it was vague, and because I'm proud of who I am, it has caused me to close up and retract because now I'm afraid of what is wrong with me.

It profoundly disappoints me she also offered no solution, gave no warning, and refuses to want therapy for herself or marriage counseling. This isn't the first time she has done something like this, and this is the first time I'm actually opening up about it to someone... About 8 years ago or so, she started coming back home late at night, or spending the night elsewhere. Initially she told me she stayed at a friend, but it kept happening every night. Eventually, she admitted to cheating on me after lying for weeks. Now that I'm typing this, I'm so ashamed I trust this person and forgave her. We discussed at the time why, and she said something very similar to how she's feeling now: That she feels like she doesn't have a purpose, that she feels lost and deeply unhappy, and it's my fault because I 'keep her' in place because she wants to be alone. This is a person who doesn't want to do any hobbies or sports, I know this is still my wife and it's unfair to point it out, but I always encouraged her to discover new things, to have fun and take care of herself. At one point, she got arrested for trying to shoplift a scarf, I still don't know why she did it but I kept it a secret, maybe it has to do with how she feels - either way, it felt bizarre considering her lack of initiative to do things.

I was getting ready to leave the relationship, when she apologized and said she loves me more than anything, that I am her happiness. I came back, and she did it \*again\* the same night. Then, shit calmed down. Again, I'm very disappointed and ashamed in my decisions 8 years ago, but I gave it time, I proposed 3 years after when I was sure and felt safe, and I could understand that yeah, at that age, you want to experiment and be with other people.

I stated we have a functional, happy relationship at the beginning and it is true, apart from these two episodes. It is loving, trusting, we have fantastic sex, and our bond is deep and true. But after the things she has said and done, I'm reaching my end of the road. I don't feel like I can trust her any longer, and I don't think I want to live in expectation of the next big breakdown, a healthy way to signal you want more romance is to... ask for more romance, to plan it yourself. I never withheld it and I never rejected her.

So why do I still feel butterflies? What is wrong with me? Why do I want to wake up, have coffee and just go on a walk and talk with her? Why do I love her so much still? Is there something wrong with me?

TLDR: My relationship with my wife of 11 years is reaching its end, but I still deeply care for her and love her. I don't understand why I can't move on and keep trying to fix it",6,1746075055.0,relationships,14,1.0,False

**TL;DR after 2 years together my bf [32M] says he's depressed and suicidal when he can't buy or have what he wants, and shows me less love. But he's not working to earn more. When he has my money [31F], as hes not driven to improve, he's happy and himself. Is it manipulation? How do I deal with it?**

My bf [33M] and I [32F] are both creative types that would love to live free and travel the world, while running our own business, but that's a dream. We've been together for nearly 3 years, love each other, and both started as very positive people. I would say I still am. I can't get a read on him anymore. 

I gave up on owning my own business during Covid and got a role in corporate America. I have worked very very hard to get where I am, moved up and keep doing so. Stress is killer, deadlines are ruthless, but I make good money and keep it up so I can travel and enjoy when I have downtime. Thats my reward for it.

He, however, owns his own business that just isn't doing great. It hasn't been since I met him yet he's changed nothing to improve it. He has always seemed very driven. Has excellent ideas and can wow anyone when talking through a project.  He's pulling in income, but not enough to live on anymore. Business has dropped. We've discussed ideas, way to market and I tried investing and none of the money went into the company that I could tell so I never offered again and have been suggesting other opportunities. He says he's not made for those roles or qualified. 

I cover rent, food, my car and my bills. He covers his bills and spends the rest on cafes, shoes, games, golf, car stuff- whatever makes him look good or makes him happy.

He has weeks of positivity, clarity and focus where he laughs and is fun to be around. Then things get tight or don't work and he's a different person. He's started saying he's depressed, and I have been supporting him through it all over the past 8 months or so. But after the inevstment thing I have pulled back on offering funds. Tell him our expenses are higher so less to spend. Economy is crap. Yet here lately he's asking for more and more, without giving up anything. And the depression is growing. Needs this for the car, new summer clothes, whatever. If he has it he's happy, if not depressed. I don't even buy myself coffee daily I make it at home, but I keep having to sacrifice for his wants. It's now become cancel this vacation I finally booked with my family after years of them going without me (and even though I've worked myself to death) because he needs this thing for his car or it will break down. I suggested he use part of the investment money for that nearly a year ago when I noticed he wasn't putting it into marketing and he didn't, but now that I have a vacation booked and the investment money is gone it's dire and I have to cancel my trip. I even invited him on the trip if he could contribute fornhis flight. Yet he's still spending his money on himself and needing more. He never put the money aside so I didn't book his ticket. But he's also depressed and ""can't take anymore"" upsets if I bring anything up and starts talking suicidal. I need a break though.

On top of that, as I have started to hold back on funds, I don't feel the same love from him. We argue more, a lot of his sweet and loving moments have faded. There's no romance. I'm not sure if it's the depression, the money, me or a game? I'm trying to protect him because of his mental state and feel I need to give in so he doesnt break, but I'm worried I will if he doesn't. He won't see someone for the depression, and it only comes up when he can't have something, gets a bill, or I start talking about feelings and then it's then days of arguments and I have nothing so I have nothing to give you and should just end it talk. It feels like when he has money to blow he's the man I love, but when he doesn't he's someone else entirely. 

What do I do? I feel trapped. I asked for couples therapy if he wont go solo and he wants no part of it. Won't see a Dr. I'm scared because he talks suicidal and I love him and can't bare the thought he hurts himself.

Do I have the hard conversation though he's depressed? Is he depressed? Ask for a balance? If you get this I get that. Or I can help with this now if you help with that next payment to balance. Or do I need to wake up and realize it's not love but a free ride and now that things are tight, that's why the feelings have changed and the depression is present? Is it truly depression or a Uno Reverse card that will get him what he wants? A friend told me it's manipulation and not to give in, but how do I let someone I love say that and ignore it? I feel like I'm losing my mind.

I‘m currently using an Eagle One Prima for my home set-up. After almost 4 years of using it, though there is no fault with the machine, i feel it lacks the enjoyment of being able to control the shots and the volumetric function is really not relevant for my case.

me and my wife mostly drink light-medium roast americano (90%) and occasionally milk coffee (10%), I usually make 2-3 shots a day and think that pressure profiling would be beneficial for my case as sometimes i feel a straight 9-bar shot doesn’t give me the taste profile that i really like.

Recently, i just got a trade-in deal from a local authorized retailer that they would take my used machine (less than 2000shots pulled, excellent condition) for 4500usd and would sell an unused 2022 GS3 MP for 7000usd with one year warranty, where i live a brand new 2025 GS3 MP is 9500usd so it‘s very temping.

1kc0gfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsReadOfficial/comments/1kc0gfd/the_demonic_entity_in_my_room/,The demonic entity in my room,"Hi, I would like to share my story with you about the time I saw a demonic entity. This was back in August of 2014 while I was dealing with a tough transition in my life. This happened in the middle of the night, but I'm going to tell the story of that whole day so that you can better understand why it's all so crazy, as if seeing an evil entity isn't crazy enough.
So that day in August of 2014, I had been 4 months into a recovery program healing from an addiction, that I am still free of to this day! Anyway, during my time at the program I got warnings for talking during work. During the day we worked in a warehouse that distributed donations to a big chain thrift store. During my shift that day, I got caught talking to a male resident which was a huge no-no at this program. So because I got in trouble for the third or fourth time, I got kicked out of the program. They opened the back door and out I went, no cell phone or money (we pretty much worked for snacks). I went into a liquor store and asked to use the phone, where I made plans to have my step dad pick me up from the train station. I waited there for about four hours since I had to wait until he was done with what he already had planned, giving me plenty of time to think on my life decisions and what to do next. He finally arrived, unhappy with me as expected. I sat in what would be my new room for the next couple of months feeling defeated and exhausted. It finally came time to get some rest and I fell asleep quickly. I started to dream that I was in this place I loved as a child called Color Me Mine, but it was also a coffee shop. I sat at a table with no coffee or clay to paint, just sitting there noticing that it was only me and a middle aged woman who was working there. She was sweeping the floor and suddenly stopped and said ""So Sara, what are you going to do now that you got kicked out of treatment""? Even though this was a dream, I remember feeling shocked that she knew my name and such personal information. As I was thinking about how to answer her question, there was suddenly a deafening scream. The scream wasn't of terror, it was of pure anger. The woman was just looking at me with no expression on her face while this scream was happening around us. It terrified me so badly I woke up, but I was still hearing the scream. It faded out and I was waiting for one of my parents to come to my room and ask what the hell that was about, but they never did. Just as quickly as the scream faded, I felt a presence to the left of my bed. Standing there in front of the window, there was this entity. It looked like an angry, sickly and demonic old woman. She was staring daggers at me and her mouth was open as if she were snarling. I was awake at this point. To this day I still know I was awake. I looked right back at her and started praying. Since I had come out of a Christian-based program, it was all I could think of to do. She slowly faded away, and as she was her expression softened but was still full of hatred. Then she was just gone. I sat there, looking around my room. I'm not sure why, but I didn't feel scared after that. I laid back down and went back to sleep.
The next morning, I was making coffee with my mom and telling her about what I had experienced. She tried to tell me it was all a dream, even though I thought I was awake after sitting up from hearing that scream that I'll never forget, she was sure the whole thing was a dream, not just the part up until the scream woke me up. I know that at that moment I sat up, still hearing that scream I was awake. I heard that scream still happening when I sat up right before I saw that evil thing. It's been over ten years and I have never and will never forget it.
Sometimes I think that entity was angry because I was still determined to fight and better my life. I felt like the anger and hatred it gave off was because it wanted me to give up and suffer. I chose to fight and I'm now living an amazing life.",1,1746074394.0,LetsReadOfficial,0,1.0,False

1kc0fdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParanormalEncounters/comments/1kc0fdr/the_demonic_entity_in_the_room/,The demonic entity in the room,"I would like to share my story with you about the time I saw a demonic entity.  This was back in August of 2014 while I was dealing with a tough transition in my life. This happened in the middle of the night, but I'm going to tell the story of that whole day so that you can better understand why it's all so crazy, as if seeing an evil entity isn't crazy enough.
So that day in August of 2014, I had been 4 months into a recovery program healing from an addiction, that I am still free of to this day! Anyway, during my time at the program I got warnings for talking during work. During the day we worked in a warehouse that distributed donations to a big chain thrift store. During my shift that day, I got caught talking to a male resident which was a huge no-no at this program. So because I got in trouble for the third or fourth time, I got kicked out of the program. They opened the back door and out I went, no cell phone or money (we pretty much worked for snacks). I went into a liquor store and asked to use the phone, where I made plans to have my step dad pick me up from the train station. I waited there for about four hours since I had to wait until he was done with what he already had planned, giving me plenty of time to think on my life decisions and what to do next. He finally arrived, unhappy with me as expected. I sat in what would be my new room for the next couple of months feeling defeated and exhausted. It finally came time to get some rest and I fell asleep quickly. I started to dream that I was in this place I loved as a child called Color Me Mine, but it was also a coffee shop. I sat at a table with no coffee or clay to paint, just sitting there noticing that it was only me and a middle aged woman who was working there. She was sweeping the floor and suddenly stopped and said ""So *Sara,* what are you going to do now that you got kicked out of treatment""? Even though this was a dream, I remember feeling shocked that she knew my name and such personal information. As I was thinking about how to answer her question, there was suddenly a deafening scream. The scream wasn't of terror, it was of pure anger. The woman was just looking at me with no expression on her face while this scream was happening around us. It terrified me so badly I woke up, but I was still hearing the scream. It faded out and I was waiting for one of my parents to come to my room and ask what the hell that was about, but they never did. Just as quickly as the scream faded, I felt a presence to the left of my bed. Standing there in front of the window, there was this entity. It looked like an angry, sickly and demonic old woman. She was staring daggers at me and her mouth was open as if she were snarling. I was awake at this point. To this day I still know I was awake. I looked right back at her and started praying. Since I had come out of a Christian-based program, it was all I could think of to do. She slowly faded away, and as she was her expression softened but was still full of hatred. Then she was just gone. I sat there, looking around my room. I'm not sure why, but I didn't feel scared after that. I laid back down and went back to sleep.
The next morning, I was making coffee with my mom and telling her about what I had experienced. She tried to tell me it was all a dream, even though I thought I was awake after sitting up from hearing that scream that I'll never forget, she was sure the whole thing was a dream, not just the part up until the scream woke me up. I know that at that moment I sat up, still hearing that scream I was awake. I heard that scream still happening when I sat up right before I saw that evil thing. It's been over ten years and I have never and will never forget it.
Sometimes I think that entity was angry because I was still determined to fight and better my life. I felt like the anger and hatred it gave off was because it wanted me to give up and suffer. I chose to fight and I'm now living an amazing life.",1,1746074285.0,ParanormalEncounters,2,0.57,False

I know I need to move my rug back more behind the couch, but wondering if I need a new table / bigger size or shape for this area. We have our couch covered in blankets at the moment because our dog is still recovering from surgery but you can see the color of it on the area I lifted the blanket up. We are probably going to replace that big swivel chair with another one and couple probably use another side table (small) for the long portion of the couch. Does the size, shape, and color of table work here? We really don’t have a lot of space in this area but would love some simple suggestions (aside from moving the rug further back).

1kc0d0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1kc0d0l/ghosting_my_bestfriend_of_12_years/,Ghosting my bestfriend of 12 years,"Okay so I 27 F have decided to cut ties with my best friend 26 F of 12 years. Now I can ramble so I will start this off with we have never got into dramatic arguments and fought over dumb things through out this 12 years. The only instance of us arguing happened in 2018 December, I had tweeted some eoy bs like if you didn’t text me or hang out with me in the Holidays don’t expect to hear from me in 2019 and she ended up getting offended. I told her the tweet was about nobody in particular and I’d never do something like that to her but if the shoe fits wear it. We stopped talking for 2 months at most and in Feb. 2019 she reached out to me to make amends.
 All the way up until 2023 was when I started having second thoughts on whether we are still considered “best friends”. At the time I was pregnant expecting my first child in Jan. 2024, we made multiple plans in the summer of 23 while she was living in another state for her return in the fall, baby shower planning, pamper trips the things you typically do with your bestie. Now it’s important for me to add she’s not to fond of my boyfriend/ father of my child. The week she returned she didn’t contact me at all instead I learned she was back in town thru her IG story; she reposted a story from what she now calls her bestie on to her own (I am not a fan of said bestie and she’s aware). They went to go get coffee and I will admit my hormones got the best of me and I was just truly upset she didn’t even reach out to me to let me know she was in town. I had just moved into a new apartment I wanted to her to come over to see it and not only that reveal my baby’s gender.
 So fast forward to November I’m super hormonal at this point bc anything you can think of that a girl would want to be doing with her bestfriend during their first pregnancy is not happening I was planning my baby shower all on my own I was very depressed and just felt miserable and I began to distance myself bc anytime I was reaching out I wouldn’t receive a response until hours or maybe even a day later or at all. I chose to let her know I wanted some space at the beginning of November due to being under a lot of stress already and her not being there like I wanted her to be was only making me feel some type of way and I didn’t wanna stress over anything that was really just irrelevant to what was to be expected. She was given an invitation for my baby shower she did rsvp and she informed me she wouldn’t be going just bc my boyfriend was gonna be there and she in fact did not come. She decided to reach out to me the week after my baby shower to rekindle our friendship. I gave in bc my support system was not so great and I was having some bad experiences. Now I wanna fast forward to the end of 2024.
I left my boyfriend in November due to relationship issues and moved in with my cousin for some time. She invited me to a Friendsgiving and informed me no kids where allowed, I was not able to find a babysitter, for reference my cousin had a 3 month only baby and 15 month old baby and my baby was 9 going on 10 months so it just wasn’t reasonable to throw that on her plate. My dad passed away in 2021 and my mom is an addict I don’t have anybody else and my in laws where not even option for me due to our fall out when I left my boyfriend. To tell me kids weren’t allowed really rubbed me the wrong way but she didn’t make an exception for me so I didn’t go. Christmas came along and she had a Friendsmas and did not even bother to invite me to this. I figured out again thru a repost on IG and the same thing happened with Galentines. Okay so in between all this time I had seen her literally a hand full of times and she lived 15 min. Away from me which wasn’t sitting right with me anymore. January she came to my baby’s birthday party but left early to make it to the bestie previously mentioned birthday dinner bc she has the same birthday as my baby. On Feb. 1 I texted her and asked her for a babysitter early that morning due to mine canceling last minute. She never texted me back and I ended up calling in and getting fired the same day for such reason. Now in no way am I entitled to her to say yes or blame her for being fired I am responsible for that and I took my L. It’s what she did that has made me go silent and ignore her stories and post and as of today remove her from all social media platforms. She never texted me back she didn’t respond at all and that’s what makes me angry, what made me angrier is 2 hours after I sent her my message she posted on IG that she was at a grand opening coffee shop minutes away from us with the same bestie that’s been mentioned previous times before. I just took it as my last straw. She’s gone to New York with this girl and they hang out every weekend or just on a regular basis. I’ve just finally decided I’m not gonna be an option to hang out anymore or to vent to anymore bc I’m tired of not hearing from her for months I stopped sharing my location in March and then yesterday she texted me for the first time since my sons birthday. I didn’t even respond and I don’t think I want to anymore when she bothers me again if she does. I just wanted to vent about it, sorry if I rambled I left out other small things but these are the major things. I just felt like the friendship became so one sided and I’m tired of being the only one to reach out make plans or anything that falls in the lines of keeping the friendship alive.

1kc04w6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnburdenYourMind/comments/1kc04w6/the_keyboard/,The Keyboard,"It was a forgettable kind of Wednesday—gray light spilling across office carpet, half-finished coffee cooling beside half-finished emails. Candy sat with one leg tucked under her, lightly tapping her keyboard like she was trying to coax it back to life. The spacebar was sticking again. It kept catching, breaking her rhythm in all the worst ways.

With a sigh, she gave in and pulled up the IT portal.

New keyboard. New mouse.

Because at this point, why not?

She submitted the ticket and spun slowly in her chair, already anticipating that nothing would happen quickly. IT usually took its time. She reached for her mug again, just as the desk phone rang.

“Hi, this is John from IT,” the voice said—smooth, slightly warm, like he wasn’t trying too hard but still wanted to sound competent. “You submitted a request for a new keyboard and mouse?”

Candy paused at the tone. Not what she expected.

There was something textured in the way he spoke. New, maybe. But not uncertain.

More like… curious.

“That’s me,” she said lightly. “Third floor. Desk with the fake plant and peppermint oil diffuser.”

He let out a low, amused chuckle that hummed across the line. “Got it. Be right there.”

And then he was.

She stood as he stepped off the elevator, and their eyes met before either of them said a word.

Candy’s pulse surprised her.

Because damn.

John was tall—taller than most of the men in this office, with warm milk chocolate skin and deep-set brown eyes the color of dark cocoa. There was something focused in his gaze, like he noticed details other people didn’t. Something watchful. Intelligent. Maybe even a little dangerous, but not in a way that made her uneasy.

No, it made her want to lean in.

He wore a dark, fitted sweater—simple, clean. But as he leaned over her desk to reach behind her monitor, the sleeves pulled back just enough to reveal ink wrapping around both wrists. Black lines. Sharp edges. The beginning of something more.

Candy’s breath hitched a little, subtle enough to hide.

Full sleeves?

She loved a tattooed man. Especially when the ink was quiet, revealed slowly like a secret.

He smelled clean, too—skin-warm and woodsy, with a whisper of something sweet buried in the mix.

She didn’t move.

Let him get close.

Let the warm trail of his body heat skim along her side as he worked.

John caught the scent of her perfume as he leaned in. Something soft and warm—vanilla, with a musk beneath it. Feminine, but not innocent. It filled his head just enough to distract him from the cords he was untangling.



He smiled when she made a quiet joke about the keyboard being cursed. Couldn’t help it. He had one of those full, open smiles that lit up his whole face—but he didn’t show it right away. You had to earn it. When he straightened up, she noticed how he stood—shoulders square, legs long, that easy confidence in the way he moved.



And then his eyes caught the photo on her desk.



Candy. Smiling. Her arm around a man.

Not recent, but not faded either.



He didn’t comment.

Just noted it.

Carefully.



“Well,” he said, stepping back slightly, still smiling. “You’re all set.”



“Thanks,” she said, her voice smooth, maybe a little more than necessary.



And then he left.



Candy turned back to her screen, heart still a little uneven. Her eyes drifted to the photo. She didn’t move it, but she felt its weight now. Like it had interrupted something that hadn’t even started.



John rode the elevator down with the ghost of her scent still lingering in his shirt collar. He didn’t usually notice these things. Didn’t let himself. But this?



This was worth noticing.



He’d tread gently.

But he wasn’t walking away.
