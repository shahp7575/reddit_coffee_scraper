1mvpuzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1mvpuzt/went_fishing_yesterday_for_the_first_time_in/,"Went fishing yesterday. For the first time in about 17 years, I wasn‚Äôt hungover or drunk.","I never realized how much I really enjoyed fishing, and I‚Äôve done it my entire life. 

I‚Äôd forgotten what it was like to fish as a young man. Hangover free; just me and the water. 

I had this epiphany mid fishing trip. I haven‚Äôt been able to drink coffee for months due to health anxiety. Constant impending doom feeling/worried I was going to die, cardio phobia mostly. 

In the last two weeks, I‚Äôve really started to turn a corner with my anxiety. I decided to drink a nice hot cup of coffee even though I knew it could cause a panic attack like it has in the past due to being hungover. 

I ran toward the anxiety and faced it head on yesterday. I wholeheartedly believe the constant state of being hungover everyday led to my chronic health anxiety. Not meaning to go on a tangent about anxiety on a stop drinking sub, but this is a huge victory for me and probably the largest reason I decided to try to stop. 

I‚Äôve always heard about the magic 60-90 days regarding anxiety reduction. Days 50-60 made me think it was a bunch of bullshit. I was really struggling with sleep and anxiety was through the roof. I never thought I‚Äôd feel this good if I powered through it. I decided to adopt a stubborn attitude and accepted that I was just going to feel like shit for the rest of my life. That helped me dig deep and not give in. 

Obviously, I know that I‚Äôll have my ups and downs, but just the small fact that I can have a big cup of coffee and get outside and fish on the water all day again is big for me. 

If you‚Äôre reading all of this and you‚Äôre struggling at around the 2 month mark still, just know that it will get better. I thought it was bull, but I‚Äôm living proof that it isn‚Äôt. Dig deep, hang tough, you can do it and it is totally worth it. ",2,1755720665.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day ü§≠. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath ü§ó.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. 

I'm working night shift tonight and things are a little bit quiet so I'll be around for a while to chat! Feel free to join me and throw some music recommendations my way.

A little info about me so you know I'm not just a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play video games. I'm obsessed with Satisfactory at the moment.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 6 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

1mvpubc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mvpubc,One Room Left in Our Huge Ocean Hill Townhouse ‚Äì Sept 1 or Sep 15th Move-In,"Hey everyone,

We just locked down this massive 2-floor townhouse on Fulton St. in Ocean Hill, and we‚Äôre looking for one last roommate to join us for the Sept 1 move-in. The place is amazing ‚Äì hardwood floors, huge common spaces on both levels, in-building laundry, and even an extra bonus room that opens to the backyard.

The available room is super quiet, backyard-facing with two big windows, tons of natural light, and a double-door closet. It easily fits a queen or king bed, plus space for a couch or desk if you want. Rent is $1,175/month with first month + security to move in. Landlord just needs good income/credit (or a guarantor). No fee.

About the crew so far:

Lisa (22) ‚Äì works at a smoothie bar + bartends, also an artist and musician. Super clean, outgoing but also respects privacy.

Evi & Jack (mid-20s, that‚Äôs me) ‚Äì couple from upstate, both musicians into movies, hanging with our shy cat, Pippi.

Julian ‚Äì just graduated from Ohio State, moving here for comedy writing & film. Loves standup, music, and keeping the place clean.

So the vibe is pretty chill, creative, and friendly, but we all respect each other‚Äôs space too.

Neighborhood perks:
We‚Äôre near Rockaway Ave (C) and Broadway Junction (L, J, A, C) so the commute is easy anywhere in the city. Daily Press Coffee, Beets Caf√©, and All Night Skate are right around the corner, and Callahan-Kelly Playground with the new skate park and courts is nearby.

If you think you‚Äôd be a good fit, hit me up! We‚Äôre trying to lock this in fast so we can all move in together on Sept 1.",1,1755720623.0,NYCroommates,0,1.0,False

1mvptv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mvptv5/the_fracture/,The fracture,"Part I: Who I Am

I‚Äôve always been the grounded one in the group‚Äîthe one who laughs last but thinks first.
My name is Ellis Maddox. 27. Architect.
Order comforts me. Blueprints, clean lines, symmetry‚Äîthey give shape to a world that rarely makes sense.

I don‚Äôt drink much. I don‚Äôt like noise. I don‚Äôt like surprises.
And yet, somehow, I agreed to a cabin trip with the others.

We were celebrating a break‚Äîsomeone‚Äôs engagement, I think. Or maybe just the end of summer.
But I can‚Äôt remember now.

Not clearly.

Part II: The Others

1. Kayla ‚Äì My oldest friend. A medic. She‚Äôs sharp, but she‚Äôs been off lately. Zoning out mid-sentence, forgetting things she just said. She laughs it off, but I‚Äôve seen her hands shake when she thinks no one‚Äôs looking.

2. Marcus ‚Äì The funny one. Always with a story, always with a smirk. He‚Äôs the glue, in a way. But he hides behind humor‚Äîlike he‚Äôs afraid of silence. Afraid of thinking too long.

3. Dani ‚Äì My ex. We broke up over a year ago, but somehow we‚Äôre still friends. Kind of. She reads people too well. Knows what you‚Äôre feeling before you do. That used to comfort me. Now it unnerves me. Sometimes I catch her looking at me like she‚Äôs expecting something‚Äîsomething I‚Äôm supposed to remember.

Part III: The Beginning of the End

The cabin is buried deep in the woods, five hours from the city, no signal, no distractions. That‚Äôs the point, I guess.
‚ÄúDisconnect to reconnect,‚Äù Kayla said.
But I don‚Äôt remember agreeing. I don‚Äôt remember packing.
I just remember‚Ä¶ being here.

It started the first night.
The power flickered. The air felt heavy, like it was pressing against my skin. The others laughed it off, but I kept hearing‚Ä¶ something. Not footsteps, exactly. More like‚Ä¶ repetition. Like something rehearsing the idea of being alive.

Part IV: The Fracture

The days feel disjointed now. I‚Äôll wake up, and the coffee‚Äôs already brewed, even though no one claims to have made it.
I found a note in my handwriting that I don‚Äôt remember writing:
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust the mirrors.‚Äù

At first, I thought I was sleepwalking. But then Marcus said he saw me outside last night‚Äîjust standing there under the trees, staring up at the cabin.
I never left the bed.

Dani doesn‚Äôt act surprised. She just watches me, like she‚Äôs waiting for something to click.
Like I‚Äôve done this before.

Part V: Mind Twists Begin

Things are starting to repeat.
Kayla told the same story at dinner three nights in a row‚Äîbut swears it‚Äôs the first time.
Marcus asked me the same question twice within an hour:
‚ÄúDo you remember what really happened to us?‚Äù

I told him to stop screwing with me. He just smiled.
‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôre the one screwing with us.‚Äù

Part VI: Theories That Don‚Äôt Make Sense (But Might)
	1.	I‚Äôm in a loop.
Not a time loop, exactly. More like a mental one. Like I‚Äôm trapped inside the memory of a trip I took once‚Äîbut pieces are missing, corrupted.
	2.	One of them isn‚Äôt real.
Someone feels‚Ä¶ off. Dani says I‚Äôm projecting. But then I caught Kayla‚Äôs reflection not moving in sync with her.
	3.	None of this is real.
The cabin. The friends. My self.
What if I‚Äôm still in the city, in a hospital bed, in a coma?
What if this is my mind‚Äôs way of buffering pain, hiding trauma?
	4.	I did something.
Something I can‚Äôt live with. And this is the punishment‚Äîreliving a twisted version of it until I remember.

Part VII: Cracks in Myself

Last night, I found a blueprint on the table.
It was a layout of the cabin‚Äîbut not the one we‚Äôre staying in.
It was different. It had a basement.
We don‚Äôt have a basement.
Except now‚Ä¶ we do.

I opened the door behind the pantry today and found stairs that weren‚Äôt there before.
Cold, damp steps.
Leading down.

I‚Äôm afraid to go down there.
I think I already have.
I think I keep doing it.

And each time, I forget. Each time, I come back a little‚Ä¶ less.

Part VIII: Descent

The others were still asleep when I opened the hidden door again.
No creak. No chill. Just a gaping dark mouth at the base of the pantry, like it had always been there‚Äîwaiting for me to remember it.

I counted the steps out loud as I went down. Thirty-seven.
But halfway, they stopped echoing.

The staircase just‚Ä¶ ended.
Not into a room. Not into dirt.
Just into more hallway‚Äîcold cement walls, flickering lights overhead.

I should have turned back.
But something in me said I‚Äôd already been here before.

And something else whispered:

‚ÄúYou need to finish it this time.‚Äù

Part IX: Memories That Aren‚Äôt Mine

The hallway was lined with doors.
All identical.
No numbers. No knobs. Just a single word carved into each in small, perfect script.

GUILT
CHOICE
TRUTH
ELLIS

I stopped at that last one.
It wasn‚Äôt carved.
It was burned in.

I pressed my hand against the surface. Cold.
Then suddenly‚Äîwarm.

Like the door had a pulse.

Behind me, I heard my own voice whisper:

‚ÄúYou made us real. Now face what you did.‚Äù

Part X: Theories Twist Tighter

I used to think I was the victim of whatever this place is.
But what if I‚Äôm the architect of it?
What if I didn‚Äôt just design buildings‚Äîwhat if I designed this whole twisted pocket reality to protect myself from something I couldn‚Äôt handle?

A mental structure.
A safe house for a fractured mind.

The blueprints. The repetition. The unnatural symmetry of this place.

What if I built this whole prison‚Ä¶
to forget?

Part XI: Friend or Construct?

When I came back upstairs, the others were sitting at the table.
Silent. Not eating. Just staring at me.

Kayla finally spoke.

‚ÄúYou opened it, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù

I nodded.

Marcus shook his head slowly. ‚ÄúYou always do.‚Äù

I asked them‚Äîbegged them‚Äîto tell me the truth.
Dani stood up, came close, placed a hand on my chest.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that we‚Äôre fake, Ellis. It‚Äôs that you made us too real. That‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt let go.‚Äù

Then she whispered:

‚ÄúDo you remember the fire?‚Äù

Part XII: The Flash

A house.
Not the cabin.
My first solo project.

I see myself there, screaming for someone inside. The flames are too high.
Three people trapped.
My friends.
My team.

They were real once.

But I couldn‚Äôt save them.

I blamed the contractor. The design. God.
But deep down‚Ä¶ I knew it was my miscalculation. My structure. My ego.

So I came here.
Into the version of that house I could control.

And I rebuilt them.

Kayla. Marcus. Dani.

They‚Äôre not ghosts.
They‚Äôre guilt echoes.
Perfectly simulated fragments of who they were.

But they remember.

And they want me to stop living in the replica.

Part XIII: The Final Door

Tonight, they tell me I have to make a choice.

Stay in the loop.
Stay in the cabin.
Keep pretending.

Or walk through the last door‚Äîthe one labeled TRUTH.

But they warn me:
If I do, the world I‚Äôve built burns‚Äîfor good.

And they‚Äôll be gone with it.

No more laughter. No more dinners.
No more pretending we‚Äôre all okay.

Just me.
Alone.
In a world where they died because of me.

Part XIV: TRUTH

I stood before the door, my hand trembling just above the surface.

The others were silent. Watching.

Kayla had tears in her eyes‚Äîmaybe from the smoke of the fire I hadn‚Äôt remembered until now. Or maybe from something deeper. A goodbye we both knew was coming.

Marcus gave a sad smile. ‚ÄúYou always had to know. That was the problem with you, Ellis.‚Äù

Dani didn‚Äôt speak. She just nodded.
And I felt everything she didn‚Äôt say land like a weight in my chest.

I took a breath.

Then I opened the door.

Part XV: The Collapse

It wasn‚Äôt a door.

It was a mirror.

And it shattered the moment I touched it.

I fell.

Not physically. Psychologically.
Through floors of memory I‚Äôd buried beneath blueprint lines and fake smiles.

I saw it all.

‚∏ª

The Fire.

A design flaw. A support beam too close to the fuel line.

It was my mistake.

Kayla, Marcus, Dani‚Äîall part of my team. We were celebrating the project‚Äôs opening night. I was proud. Drunk on ambition.

When the explosion hit, I was outside.

They weren‚Äôt.

‚∏ª

The Trial.

I was never charged. ‚ÄúFreak accident,‚Äù they said.
But I knew better.
And I couldn‚Äôt live with it.

So I didn‚Äôt.

‚∏ª

The Build.

I retreated inward.
Built the cabin in my mind‚Äîthe perfect reconstruction.
And inside it, I recreated them.
Gave them personalities, laughter, flaws.
Gave myself a world where they forgave me.

But they weren‚Äôt just echoes.
They evolved.

They remembered.

And they‚Äôve been waiting all this time for me to finally let go.

‚∏ª

Part XVI: Waking Up

I opened my eyes to white light.

Hospital ceiling.
IV in my arm.
My mouth dry. My mind sharp. Real.

A voice: ‚ÄúEllis? Can you hear me?‚Äù

I turned. A nurse. Real. Solid. No flicker.

‚ÄúWelcome back,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been under for a long time.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long?‚Äù I croaked.

She glanced at her chart. ‚ÄúEighteen months.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Part XVII: The World That Waited

I‚Äôm walking again. Slowly. One foot in front of the other.

My license is suspended. My firm dissolved.
But I‚Äôm alive.

And they‚Äôre not.

Every day I wake up, the guilt sits beside me.
But I sit beside it now.

I talk to Dani when I drink my coffee.
I hear Marcus when a joke pops into my head.
I feel Kayla‚Äôs presence in my silence.

They‚Äôre gone.

But they‚Äôre also part of me‚Äîthe parts that refuse to let pain make me hollow.

Final Chapter: Embers

Six months out of the coma.

I don‚Äôt dream about the cabin anymore.
Not because it‚Äôs gone, but because I finally left it.

Some days, though, I catch a flicker in the mirror‚Äîjust for a second. Dani brushing her hair behind her ear. Marcus smirking like he just made a joke. Kayla‚Äôs eyes full of concern, like I‚Äôm forgetting something again.

They‚Äôre not ghosts. They‚Äôre not hallucinations.
They‚Äôre reminders.
Anchors.

‚∏ª

I went to the memorial last week.

The company never rebuilt the site. It‚Äôs fenced off. Charred beams still mark the shape of what once stood there.

A plaque reads:

‚ÄúIn memory of those we lost on the night the sky burned.‚Äù

I left flowers.
And beneath the bouquet, a note.

‚ÄúI remember now.
I see you clearly.
I built a perfect world to escape you.
But it was your pain that brought me back.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Facing the Families

It was the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done.

Kayla‚Äôs mother wouldn‚Äôt look at me.
Marcus‚Äôs brother punched me in the chest, once‚Äîthen cried into my shoulder.
Dani‚Äôs father asked only one question:

‚ÄúWas she happy, in the end?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt answer at first. My throat closed.
Then I said: ‚ÄúShe was trying to forgive me. That‚Äôs more than I deserved.‚Äù

He nodded. ‚ÄúThen she died the way she lived.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Reconstruction

I don‚Äôt design buildings anymore.

Not yet.

Instead, I volunteer. I speak to architecture students about safety, ethics, accountability. The importance of owning your mistakes before they become permanent. Before they start breathing.

And sometimes, when no one‚Äôs around, I sketch the cabin again.
Not as it was in my mind. Not symmetrical or pristine.
This time, it‚Äôs flawed.
Real.
Lived-in.

And it doesn‚Äôt have a basement.

‚∏ª

Closure

Grief is a haunting.
It lingers in doorways. In coffee mugs. In songs you didn‚Äôt know meant anything‚Äîuntil they play again, when you‚Äôre alone.

But truth?

Truth is what happens when the haunting stops being a curse‚Ä¶
and starts becoming a conversation.

‚∏ª

Final Lines

I live in a small apartment now. No mirrors in the bedroom.
But every morning, I wake up, drink my coffee, and whisper to the quiet:

‚ÄúI remember you.
I‚Äôm still here because of you.
And I won‚Äôt build another lie to hide behind.‚Äù

And somewhere, I like to believe they hear me.
And in their own way‚Ä¶
They smile.

1mvpphu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mvpphu/does_the_nespresso_vertuo_pop_coffee_maker_review/,Does the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Coffee Maker Review Highlight Its Compact Design?,"The Nespresso ENV92BCA Vertuo Pop+ Coffee Maker and Espresso Machine in Licorice Black has been a recent addition to my kitchen, and after testing it daily, I‚Äôve got quite a few thoughts to share. With its sleek and compact design, this espresso machine seamlessly blends utility with aesthetic appeal. At first glance, it‚Äôs evident that this machine was made to stand out while saving counter space, but does its performance hold up to its stylish exterior? Let‚Äôs dig in.

**Compact Yet Stylish Design**

This coffee maker is impressively compact, measuring just 14"" D x 8.6"" W x 10.4"" H. Its small footprint is perfect for my cluttered kitchen, and the Licorice Black finish gives it a modern, glossy vibe that suits almost any d√©cor. Despite its size, it feels sturdy, and the build quality is top-notch. The machine has buttons for operation, keeping it simple and intuitive. Although it‚Äôs small, it doesn‚Äôt compromise craftsmanship or high-end aesthetics, which makes it a pleasure to have sitting on the counter.

**Performance You Can Rely On**

The fully automatic operation of this machine has completely spoiled me. Brewing coffee is as easy as popping in a capsule and pressing a single button, thanks to its one-touch brewing feature. It offers six coffee sizes, from Ristretto and Espresso to Cold Brew, satisfying my morning, midday, and evening coffee needs. Honestly, the versatility is game-changing. I found the machine incredibly consistent in delivering flavorful coffee, always at the right temperature and perfectly brewed.

[Check Nespresso ENV92BCA price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0c3p9p7b3/)

**Bluetooth and Wi-Fi: Tech Meets Coffee Making**

One of the aspects I didn't expect to find so beneficial was the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. Never thought I‚Äôd say my coffee machine updates itself like a smartphone, but here we are. With automatic software updates, it ensures the best Nespresso experience by keeping up with the latest features and brews. I did find it a little quirky to set up initially, but once connected, it provided an unexpectedly pleasing level of convenience.

**Strengths**

- Stylishly compact design fits in tight spaces.
- Versatility with six coffee sizes to suit every mood.
- Consistent brewing quality with balanced flavors.
- The convenience of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi-supported updates.

**Less Favorable Aspects**

- The capsule-based system isn‚Äôt great for eco-conscious individuals, despite the brand offering a recycling program.
- Running it via Wi-Fi occasionally experienced connectivity blips, which might frustrate some users.
- A small water tank, especially if you‚Äôre someone who drinks coffee in bulk (though, for me, it was manageable). 

**Energy Efficiency and Maintenance**

This machine‚Äôs energy efficiency deserves a mention. Not only does it heat quickly, but it also powers down automatically after a short idle period, which is both practical and eco-friendly. Maintenance isn‚Äôt difficult, either. The capsule container holds multiple used capsules (very neat, in my opinion), and the glossy exterior cleans easily with a quick wipe. Descaling is simple, which is a huge plus for people like me who procrastinate on cleaning their machines.

**Product Rivals**

Compared to other similar coffee makers, the Vertuo Pop+ stands out, but not without competition. Machines like Keurig K-Supreme Plus cater to a wider audience by accommodating ground coffee alongside pods, offering a better choice for those who don‚Äôt want to be restricted to capsules. However, they lack the style and compactness that the Vertuo Pop+ boasts. Though pricier than certain single-serve brewers, the quality of the brewed coffee here easily surpasses many competitors, including the Breville Bambino Plus, although Bambino is tailored better for those obsessed with frothy milk-based drinks.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

For its feature-rich nature and reliable brewing performance, the machine delivers solid value. While capsules do add a recurring cost, the convenience and taste more than compensate. Plus, the automatic software updates ensure it won‚Äôt quickly feel outdated. If you‚Äôre someone who prioritizes quick, consistent, and excellent-quality coffee at home, it feels like every penny is well spent here.

Suit up, I am making you breakfast each morning no matter how disgustingly early you get up, or at least packing you a homemade lunch the night before, we‚Äôre House Husbanding this if we need to for that kind of career. Are we starting a family? Doubly so, I will HOLD down this fort and get you whatever you need to make it through and I will get myself a cool robotic hand after you crush one of them in the delivery room. Not interested in that, that‚Äôs okay too, we will keep our passports up to date and travel whenever the chance presents itself, whether we‚Äôre running from a regime or just want to go see Mt. Fuji. We can make this whatever we want it to be, as long as it‚Äôs together and with belief in each other. That‚Äôs really what I‚Äôm looking for - something to last a lifetime and then past that so we can keep company in Elysium or, your preferred afterlife.

WHAT HE‚ÄôS LOOKING FOR : Truthfully? I don‚Äôt know what my ideal partner looks like or acts like, other than a few basic ideals like: Being kind, intelligent, having integrity, loyal to us and your friends and family and beliefs, altruistic, honest to others and to yourself, has passions and will share what matters to you with me so that I can appreciate it too.

Vibes wise - I find a huge swath of forms and styles attractive. It‚Äôs really about more who is inhabiting that person? It‚Äôs who that image is that is what matters to me, I would not be fooled by that doppelganger subplot or an evil twin for a fraction of a second. I am currently figuring out my own presentation, if I want to express slightly more feminine than just the Bedraggled College Professor‚Ñ¢ energy I currently emanate, maybe we push it closer to Oh, That‚Äôs a Beautiful Hyrulian Warrior‚Ñ¢! As such, I welcome you in whatever style you like - I‚Äôm going to guess you‚Äôll be nuerospicy like I am and probably have some they/them to your she/her. Dresses, jeans, oversized hoodies, athletic wear, suit and tie - if you‚Äôre femme or androgynous or more masculine or cycle between all of them, amazing. Variety is the spice of life, right? Just be you, and arrive to the party healthy and healed and whimsical ‚Äì and also generally close to my age bracket, I think either 3-4 years on either side of me is okay (my rule is, if we could have been in the same four year college at the same time, we‚Äôre golden. We should be about equally developed as people and in the same chapters of our lives, if not the same page.)

LIKES, HOBBIES, PASSIONS : I have been drawing since I could even vaguely hold a pencil, we start young. I was born the same year Pokemon came to the West so, there was a zero percent chance I was going to escape that formative interest. I love Pokemon and will be drawing them for you at some point or another, that‚Äôs just going to happen. I adore cats but all animals too and will happily point out whatever I see on any ADHD excursions we might get the chance to take - Yes I do hear a woodpecker, let‚Äôs go find it. I am a big fan of cooking, both on my own and with a trusted co-chef, and we would in time compile a family cookbook, if we make it that far along. I am big into animation, Adventure Time was hugely inspirational to me, and I‚Äôd love to learn Blender this year - the third Spiderverse film is currently my ‚Äúgotta stay alive until‚Äù to hype myself up when things seem grim. I‚Äôm also refusing to die until I see what the One Piece is, that‚Äôs a big one, and every new release of From Soft, the Pokemon Company, and a Monster Hunter title are a festival in this house, as will Haunted Chocolatier for the very cozy inclined. Martial arts and generally being active and exploring the natural world is special to me, as well as finding coffee houses we like. I've been working my way up to being a frequent flier at the gym, we can go gym together if you're into that. Otherwise, let‚Äôs make our way through every gallery, museum, zoo, and aquarium there is to be had and keep a ledger of the ones we like the very best. I could and would and will keep going on, but I‚Äôll save that for after we‚Äôve started chatting - otherwise, I‚Äôm just blathering into the void as usual - tl;dr, let's do cute, fun, nerdy stuff.

CONCLUSION : If you‚Äôve actually read through all of that - wow, alright then. Clearly I‚Äôm at least a little interesting, I‚Äôve resonated with you even just a bit. Send me more than a hello, tell me a little about yourself, let‚Äôs figure out if we have something here - let me know who your favorite Pokemon is so I know you've read this! The ‚Äúworst‚Äù that could happen is that you‚Äôll make a cool new friend (cool is subjective) - the best? We‚Äôll find out I suppose. That‚Äôs all for now, and what an all it was. Thank you and, take care out there <3",1,1755720240.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

To be clear: I am not suggesting that we should ban selling caffeine to children. If a kid wants to buy a cup of coffee, a can of energy drink, or a caffeinated milkshake, they should be allowed to do that without being carded. 

The problem is that kids are impressionable, and they‚Äôre surrounded by advertisements for caffeine. The Coca Cola Santa Claus commercials, and the Red Bull cartoon commercials are just a few of the many caffeine advertisements targeted at kids. Ghost and Prime energy drinks being sold in candy flavors is transparent advertising to kids. 

Pediatricians recommend no more than 100 mg of caffeine per day for teens, and no caffeine for children under 12.  https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx

Caffeine is physically addictive. An 8 year old who starts drinking a can of Coca Cola (32 mg) every other day could easily turn into a teenager who needs a Ghost Energy Drink (200 mg) or three to avoid a headache every day.

Hello all! I'm selling this really nice mid-high end home setup because I have too much coffee gear at the moment and need to offload some things. This is a really good value for someone looking to upgrade from their single boiler setup. 

  
Lelit Elizabeth:

  
This machine is in really good condition. I'll say upfront that the hot water dispenser function is NOT functioning. I'm pretty sure the solenoid for the dispenser needs to be replaced. I hardly ever use this feature, so it hasnt bothered me. Everything else works flawlessly. It pulls awesome shots of espresso and steams milk quickly. I made videos demonstrating its shot pulling and milk steaming prowess! I have set the advanced setting on the LCC as per Dave Corbey's amazing and detailed review, with a small adjustment as recommended by Lance Hedrick in the video below:

DF83:

  
This grinder is the V1 version, but check out the video I made demonstrating how static free and perfectly single dosing it is with just a little RDT. The upgraded SSP HU burrs give a traditional profile with nice acidity and I find that it just helps the flavors pop as comared to the stock burrs. 

  
Included in the bundle:

  
DF83 with dosing/catch cup, hopper, original burrs, SSP HU burrs, and bellows. Lelit Elizabeth V3 with original spouted portafilter, double basket, single basket, blind basket, water softener/filters for 35 and 75 lt, dosing ring, puch screen, and UAG spring calibrated tamper. 

  
If you dont have a use for the the hot water dispenser, then this is a huge value!

I downloaded a dating app and obviously I'm getting matches. Would it be bad to go out just casual outings? Like coffee, beach, bowling, etc etc... not a date but just go out more? Where nothing would really happen maybe other than hold hands or a hug, and that's only a maybe. Not even a kiss (wouldn't do it unless we are together)

I'm trying to put myself out more, and meet people and learn to talk and be comfortable talking to people. I'm obviously also going out with my friends as well, not just that, but since I have been at home for so long due to work, I figured this would be a good idea to go out more. None of the outings would be dates, just 2 people going out and enjoying their time. And maybe if I like someone, then I'd go on a date and obviously stop going out with other people.

First scenario, in this guy‚Äôs hinge profile one prompt is him acknowledging he has a bad dairy allergy. We were talking back and forth for a week or two and I suggested we go on a date. He asked me what we should do on the date. I came up with some pretty fun but simple things to do which genuinely excited me. After my suggestions he shut it down and said ‚Äúeh how about we go get ice cream instead‚Äù ‚Ä¶ Excuse me? What about that allergy? Sure there‚Äôs non dairy options but that really through me off. Plus he shut down the ideas he asked for, to then suggest ice cream. I ghosted him after that.

Second scenario, I had gone on two dates with this guy previously which we had a ton of fun on! We went to a poetry slam night once. Then we went and toured an art museum another day and got lunch afterwards. Both my ideas. Since I came up with the first two dates, I asked ‚ÄúAny input on the next date? I‚Äôm down for something more casual or fun again‚Äù to which he responded ‚ÄúUm a walk or ice cream or the farmers market maybe‚Äù. Which again through me off mainly because of the total lack of energy. I ghosted him after that. Sure I coulda told him something but it‚Äôs way too early in the talking phase to display a huge lack of interest.

It‚Äôs just so weird, and maybe I‚Äôm the only one that thinks this but I would never ever want to go on a date to get ice cream ever in my life.

1mvp9dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mvp9dh/am_i_overreacting/,Am I overreacting?,I can't believe I'm making a post about this because it's so f*****g stupid. Back story my boyfriend got me a cup as a present that was custom made for me that has a highland cow on it and sunflowers and is says something about me on it. A few months ago my mom's boyfriend put all of our cups in storage other than a select few one being mine that no one is supposed to use but me. The issue with our cups and all other dishes is my sisters boyfriend (15 y.o) was living with us and both of them did not like to do the dishes or bring them down from their room. So my step dad thought that if he took all the dishes away it would fix the problem. It did not. So today when I saw her walk away with my cup that my boyfriend had made for me I was a little mad but didn't let it show. I asked her why she was using it if it was known that it was made for me and not for her to use which got me yelled at by her because she said that there was no cups in the cabinet so I went to her room to find almost all of our cups and other dishes in her room. I calmly asked her to next time to just clean a cut if she wants coffee. Easy to say she was pissed because she doesn't want to wash a dish. I know that this is not a big problem it's just my sister loves to cause problems and we still don't have most of our dishes because of her and her boyfriend.,1,1755719340.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False
1mvp9c1,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1mvp9c1/54_and_lost/,54 and lost,"I have been a substitute teacher for 9 years (this will be my 10th). I live in WNY. There aren't any teacher shortages here. I have two master's degrees in Education: TESOL and English. I don't want to teach k-12. It was just meant to be a placeholder until I could tech college. I am unable to find a college to hire me as more than a one class adjunct. Before I quit the corporate computer sales and marketing gig, I made a ton of money. I quit in 2012 to be a teacher. EVERYONE told me it was a bad idea. I didn't listen. I got my English 7-12 teaching license and couldn't find a job. In order to keep my certification I needed to take more classes and earn a master's. I earned my first in 2020 when COVID hit. I ended up not taking my certification test because it wasn't being offered due to COVID. Once the world reopened, I still didn't take the test. Then New York State told me I had to get my professional license to teach, so I had to go back to school and get a master's in English education because my TESOL master's was useless. Great. 

Here's the thing: I don't want to teach 7-12. I never did. I wanted to teach college. Apparently. colleges aren't hiring tenure track professors anymore. Ugh. I also don't have my PhD. 

I don't want to go back to sales and marketing. I quit my subbing job to work in a sales environment and I hated it. I had to call C level execs every day to get them to book an appointment with us to learn about a new product. I always got hung up on. The pay was great! the job sucked. 

Here's the thing: as a substitute high school teacher, I don't have to teach. All I have to do is warm the teacher's seat, take attendance, and tell the kids what they are supposed to do. It is boring and could be done by anyone willing to surf the internet all day and write passes to the bathroom. 

  
My dream job: what would I love to do? be a subject matter expert. a person that other people come to for information and direction. I want people to want to know information. I don't want to force anyone to buy anything or learn anything. I would love to get to travel...internationally if possible. Not too much, once a quarter or once every two quarters would be enough. I am task oriented. Give me a problem or something  that needs to be solved and I am on it. I am efficient and will work harder than anyone to get it done. I am focused. But I also want an environment where people get along and chat with each other. I would love it if there's enough flexibility for me to work remotely at a coffee shop, another city, or from home once in a while (not everyday). I find that I'm great at problem solving. I am also efficient at understanding how things should be run. I have common sense. I work part time for a concert venue selling alcohol. The place is poorly run. They have workers who take advantage of the situation and don't work. I know how to fix it. I don't want to work blue collar. I don't want to work in finance. Yes, I came from tech...but I don't want to force people to buy things. 

I need practical suggestions that don't require me to get a completely different degree. I'm starting my EdD in two weeks. I'm mostly doing it because I am so poor and tired of starving and not being able to afford my bills. I have state health insurance and no retirement. I have almost 20 more years of working before I can retire. I don't know where to turn. Please be kind. I've tried looking in a few directions, but most things require experience I don't have. I can't be an HR generalist...I don't have an HR degree or experience. I am also more than happy to leave my current city (I am not happy here). Help.

* I've been brewing coffee using my moka pot daily since 2020. I primarily make 'psuedo-lattes' for myself and partner. Moving into the espresso world, I would be looking to elevate my milk-drink game and start enjoying some more nuanced espresso by itself.
* Most mornings I would be making two drinks back-to-back, occassionaly more for guests.
* I get super nerdy about things and dive deep into hobbies. While I want something that pulls great shots out of the box, I'm not opposed to doing some modding to improve my experience/results as I hit walls.
* While I am cool with tinkering and dialing things in, the solution needs to be partner friendly, as she will be operating the machine as well. She worked at Starbucks once upon a time, so she at least has some base knowledge/experience pulling shots & steaming milk on a commercial machine.
* Current preferred bean is [Seven - Espresso Huli](https://sevencoffeeroasters.com/collections/coffee/products/seven-espresso-specialty-coffee), which they consider dark roast, but is more mediumy in my opinion. That said, I do enjoy a nice lighter roast, so being able to properly extract lighter roasts is on my list of wants.
* Current grinder is Baratza Virtuoso+ that I have recalibrated and done the stepless mod. This setup can produce some pretty finely ground beans that ***I think*** should be 'good enough' to get started with espresso. That said, I know a more specialized grinder is probably in my future.

So with all that in mind, I am weighing my options on what machine to buy. I've all but ruled out buying a 'cheap' starter (i.e. Breville Bambino) because I know myself and will almost immediately want to upgrade. The big question I have is whether I start off with something in the \~$1,200 USD range (single boiler, simple feature-set) knowing that ***I will*** eventually get the itch to upgrade; or do I jump straight to an end-game(ish) machine with a budget around \~$3,000 USD (double boiler, flow control, pre-infusion, etc)...? Would I be missing anything in terms of developing my skillset by skipping 'entry level' prosumer or in someother way doing myself a disservice?  What am I not thinking about?

Can I move some but not all embryos from one clinic to another?,"These are questions we hear frequently, but unfortunately the answer is ‚Äúit depends‚Äù.¬† To understand why the answer isn‚Äôt definitive, it is best to review how embryos are stored!¬†

Almost always, embryos are stored on ‚Äústraws‚Äù.¬† Though they are specific to the purpose, think of these straws as being similar to a coffee stir stick in size (not a Big Gulp straw!)¬† The old practice (10+/- years ago) was to store multiple embryos on a straw, but most everyone stores one embryo per straw now.¬† Straws are labeled.¬†

Straws are stored in ‚Äúgoblets‚Äù.¬† Usually, 8-10 straws are put into a single goblet.¬† Goblets are typically not labeled.¬†

Goblets are attached to a ‚Äúcane‚Äù, almost always one goblet per cane.¬† Canes are labeled.¬†

We always protect canes with ‚Äúsleeves‚Äù (just a tube that surrounds the cane, not all facilities take this step).¬† One cane, one sleeve.¬†

Canes/sleeves fit into ‚Äúcanisters‚Äù, typically up to 30 canes per canister.¬† ¬†

How many canisters fit in ‚Äútank‚Äù depends on the tank size (very large tanks can hold hundreds, which means thousands of canes and thus thousands of embryos in a single tank!)¬†

The storage hierarchy is thus:¬†

Embryo -> straw (labeled) -> goblet (unlabeled) -> cane (labeled) -> sleeve (Generations CryoVault added protection) -> canister (labeled) -> tank (labeled)¬†

To retrieve an embryo means locating a tank, canister, cane, and straw.¬† The straw and cane are labeled by your clinic.¬† Your storage facility may add its own cane label and will update its records to note the canister and tank where the cane(s) are stored.¬† If your storage facility creates their own straw and cane labels it can lead to some confusion with the clinic that originally labeled them. ¬†The chain of custody is a critical part of this process and is why we never destroy or replace your active clinic‚Äôs storage labels (when a labeling scheme is changed, it can lead to chaos and the worst kind of errors).¬†

Almost always, when embryos are moved between facilities, whether that be between clinics or between a clinic and an offsite storage location, the entire patient‚Äôs tissues are moved together.¬† This is the standard practice.¬†

We note all of this as background to give you perspective on the potential risks you encounter when you split where your tissues are stored.

**Risk 1:**¬† If you have several embryos stored on one straw, and these happen to be the ones you want to split up, your clinic will need to thaw the embryos, move them to new straws and re-freeze.¬† Each thaw/freeze process puts the embryos at risk.¬†¬†¬†

**Risk 2:**¬† Splitting paperwork and recreating.¬† Your medical files travel with your tissues.¬† If you split your embryos between locations, copies of your medical records need to be made and details on what is going where needs to be aligned with the tissues.¬† This is entirely doable, it just creates administrative risk that the lab staff may do something wrong while performing a non-standard activity.¬†

**Risk 3:**¬† You forget what is where.¬† Patients that split their storage often become confused what is where, particularly years down the road.¬†

**Risk 4:**¬† The embryos aren‚Äôt where you need them when you need them.¬† An advantage of moving everything together is if you‚Äôre ready for a cycle and something happens to the chosen embryos when being thawed and transferred, your other embryos are there and available.¬† If you had split them up, you would lose that cycle.¬†

**Back to the original questions:**

‚ÄúAre embryos stored separately?""¬† Today they typically are.¬† If these are recently preserved, chances are very high that the answer to this question is ‚Äúyes‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúIs it complex to move some but not all to another clinic?‚Äù¬† If your embryos are stored in separate straws, conceptually the answer is that this is not complex to do.¬† But practically speaking it is non-standard and anything that changes the day-to-day routine of lab staff and embryologists introduces human error risk.¬† Will the right straws be chosen, will the right paperwork be drawn up to accompany those straws when they‚Äôre shipped, will the new cane be labeled correctly, etc.¬†

Companies like ours live in this middle ground to support OP and everyone else in their situation.¬† Feel free to call us and we can explain the storage and transport processes in more detail than we have here.¬† Keep in mind that quite a few clinics are owned by PE today so their profit motives often come before client needs (i.e., depending on who your clinic is, they may tell you flatly this is impossible to do because they want to retain your business).¬†¬†

Companies like ours also exist because it usually doesn‚Äôt make financial sense to store at your clinic. ¬†Independent storage facility pricing is almost always much lower than your clinic‚Äôs (we have one example where we are 1/8^(th)¬†the price that a family was paying to store 8 embryos, which is absolute insanity, and those folks were being totally ripped off by their clinic). ¬†Clinics often price this way to ‚Äúprice you out‚Äù of storing because they are limited on space, don‚Äôt want the overhead, and don‚Äôt want to store what is not being actively used there. ¬†We can hold mosaic and aneuploid embryos (and all other tissues!) for as long as you desire without any pressure (financial or otherwise) to move or discard.¬†

Our motto is ‚ÄúYour tissues.¬† Your choice.‚Äù Always remember, you have the freedom to do with your tissues whatever you want! ¬†",1,1755718593.0,u_GenerationsCryoVault,0,1.0,False

I live with 4 people, including a couple - M24 (D) and F31 (N). The couple are some of the *messiest* people I‚Äôve ever had the displeasure of living with. 

This is neat for them. But the coffee table covered in clutter including used tissues and a chopping board? Gross. 

They put that massive roll of bubble wrap in the corner months ago along with a bunch of boxes as well. 

M24 (D) also fences and he‚Äôs taken to ‚Äòairing out‚Äô his manky fencing costume or whatever it‚Äôs called on the backs of sofas, inclusive of his dirty (think white but blackened bottoms) socks. 

Their food hygiene is also incredibly questionable. They‚Äôll make food and leave it on the hob after dinner two and still eat it the next day. We have two large fridge / freezers and there‚Äôs enough space to store it. 

Disgustingly, both have worked in food service before and N currently works at a pub. It seems their H&S training was piss poor. 

I‚Äôve told them repeatedly to clean up after themselves (not in a nagging way, maybe once every 2 months) and they refuse. Our old flatmate (M46) used to voice the same concerns. 

They never do any of the cleaning apart from once in a blue moon D will clean the kitchen. N will do random cleaning things like descaling the kettle or the window frames but not anything else. 

N also has a daily habit of rummaging through the bin to take out what she thinks should be recycled - I get it‚Äôs important to recycle but hoovering every once in a while is good for the house. 

I went on strike from hoovering as I was the only one doing it and NOBODY did it in a month. Then one person did but only a small section. I HATE HOOVERING. Why am I the only one doing it?? 

I also went away for 2 weeks and nobody cleaned the bathroom in the time I was gone. Living room got worse. Stairways got worse. It sickens me.

My husband (M34) finally closed a massive deal at work yesterday that he‚Äôs been working on for months. I (F32) was ecstatic for him and wanted to show him how proud I was. I planned to make his all-time favorite meal, something I only do a couple of times a year because it takes so much work: bolognese from scratch with handmade pasta.

I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say this took my entire day. I spent the afternoon simmering the sauce for 6 hours with high-quality ingredients, carefully kneading and rolling out the pasta dough, the whole works. I set the table, lit candles, and had a bottle of his favorite wine ready. I was so excited to celebrate him.

Around 6 PM, he texted saying he was going out for ""one quick celebratory drink"" with his team, and that he‚Äôd be home soon. I told him no problem, have fun, and that his special dinner would be waiting.

""One quick drink"" turned into hours. He finally stumbled in after I was already asleep. I was disappointed, but I get it, he wanted to celebrate with his colleagues. Before I went to bed, I had put a generous serving of the dinner in a container for him in the fridge with a little note that said ""So proud of you! Hope you're hungry! ‚ù§Ô∏è""

This morning, I woke up before him to make coffee. I went to throw the coffee grounds in the kitchen garbage, and my heart just stopped.

There, right on top of the trash, was the entire, untouched portion of dinner I had saved for him. The handmade pasta, the sauce I'd spent all day on, all of it scraped directly into the bin. He hadn't even eaten a single bite.

I felt sick. I waited for him to wake up and I calmly asked him why he threw the food away.

He barely looked at me and said, ""Oh, I grabbed a burger and wings with the guys. I was stuffed when I got home. I just tossed it last night so you wouldn't have to deal with the old container.""

He said it so casually, like he was doing me a favor. I asked why he didn't just leave it, that I could have eaten it for lunch. He just shrugged and said, ""It's just pasta, babe. I didn't think it was a big deal.""

That's when I lost it. I started to cry, and I told him how much effort I put in and how hurtful it was that he literally threw my effort in the garbage without a second thought.

This is where I might be overreacting. He got angry. He said I was being incredibly dramatic and ""making his huge career achievement all about me."" He said he was sick of ""walking on eggshells"" and that I should be happy for him instead of starting a fight over leftovers.

He's now giving me the silent treatment, and I'm sitting here feeling like the world's biggest idiot for crying over a plate of food. But it felt like he looked at my love and effort and decided it was garbage.

Me: 23 year old female with anxious and disorganized attachment. I‚Äôm in college but have been on summer break and go back on the third. I‚Äôve been single for a few years now and am looking for something long term and whatnot. Dare I admit I‚Äôve been using hinge (a dating app more cursed than the hope diamond but we persist)

Him: 25 years old, in college and an ex marine (I think he was medically discharged at some point due to a heart condition, not confirmed and I haven‚Äôt asked it seems slightly touchy) he was in Hawaii and the Philippines during his service. Now he studies ancient civilizations and stuff. It‚Äôs pretty cool. He lives with his grandma (I think he is her caretaker or something of the sorts) he builds houses for people who have experienced hardship for free , and takes care of horses as a stable hand, and sometimes works on a boat with an old navy geezer as he calls him. On paper this man is top tier. He‚Äôs handsome conventionally and checks all the boxes one would fawn over.

How we met: hinge unfortunately. His profile was very well filled out all the way down to being a Capricorn. He doesn‚Äôt do drugs or get into trouble, he just got back from studying abroad in Greece, and yeah he seems like a rare commodity in today‚Äôs world

Why am I here on Reddit asking for advice then if he‚Äôs great? Well back to the attachment issues that I have! I‚Äôve done so much work to get to the point that I‚Äôm at but yeah it‚Äôs not something that goes away. If you know anything about anxious and disorganized attachment it‚Äôs basically emotionally draining and mentally exhausting. On paper everything is normal and perfect but there‚Äôs like a little termite in your brain with a sledgehammer of things that says ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt text you for 10 hours‚Ä¶ he hates you‚Äù it‚Äôs not the case but it bangs and bangs on the door you shut it in until you can‚Äôt take it anymore and open the door just to spiral into oblivion about things that don‚Äôt exist or shifts in behavior that you analyze to a tee. It sounds insane but yeah it is.

Let‚Äôs start from the top: date one: at this time k was talking to someone else. It went well he bought me coffee and showed up early and we talked about stupid things that didn‚Äôt matter and it was lovely really. He didn‚Äôt walk me to my car or anything but that‚Äôs not here nor there. He asks me for another date and he will let me know what we are doing later in the week. There‚Äôs initiative, we love to see it. We aren‚Äôt texting every day at this point but he‚Äôs consistent

Date two: I‚Äôm still talking to that other guy but I‚Äôm not really into it. He picks me up We go to lunch and it‚Äôs super fun and he has an orchid on his plate (we got sushi) and I put it behind my ear and he says ‚Äúpretty‚Äù. And then we are laughing again talking about things that don‚Äôt matter and he drops me off, gets out of his car and gives me a hug and walks me to my door. Sweet, very cute. I ask him on a third date. Things are good he‚Äôs consistent

Date three: mini golf. This is where things pick up. He picks me up we yap things are great we play minigolf and are rough housing and bantering and things are great. We get drinks after and laugh and yeah things are just going well. He drops me off I made him cookies in a container and tell him he needs to give me the container back (you see where this is going? Great) he sees it and says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre setting me up!‚Äù Yeah I was. Boom he plans to see me again in a few days. He loses consistency. And cancels that date. I ask him what‚Äôs up? And he says the house he was building is getting weird and taking up more time. He promises to reschedule and he does. In a timely manner. Great! And is more consistent after that again.

Date four: if I could fold I would. We sit on the beach and watch the sunset‚Ä¶. Boom first kiss it‚Äôs romantic 10/10. We laugh all the way home but still haven‚Äôt talked about anything important. He lets me throw seaweed at him and yeah it‚Äôs nice. I leave a fluffy scrunchie in his car and he says ‚Äúvery cute‚Äù to me

Date five invite him over to meet my cat. She doesn‚Äôt like anyone so that‚Äôs not surprising she doesn‚Äôt like him. We watch a movie, I hit him with a pillow. He puts me in a chokehold (gentle) and we are cuddled on the couch. We start kissing. Things heat up and I tell him ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do casual‚Äù ‚Äúthat‚Äôs okay we don‚Äôt have to go that far. Fast forward this man is basically kissing every part of my upper body humanly possible like he‚Äôs been starving his whole life. Leaves me a hickey I didn‚Äôt know he was doing and I tell him I have a crush on him and his response is a playful ‚Äúoh yeah??‚Äù And then we relax and snuggle and he says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre very comfortable to be around‚Äù and I ask ‚Äúwhat are we doing‚Äù and he doesn‚Äôt answer me instead he gets up to leave and I smack his ass and he flips me over and gives me five good ones. What a brat he is lol. Gives me a hug goodbye and says goodnight and that‚Äôs that. I gave him some marks too and he didn‚Äôt seem bothered by it like he would be if he were talking to anyone else.

Between date five and six I tell him he added 20 mins to my morning routine and he says he was shooting for 30. We still haven‚Äôt talked about our expectations or anything. His profile said he was looking for something long term open to short and mine said long term. Anyways I ask him to a peach festival he says yes.

Date 6: we go to the peach festival, I pick him up and he had a big day at work with the horses. He‚Äôs tired and his lunch wasn‚Äôt sitting well. It was also like 90 plus degrees. We pick peaches, as per usual he pays for everything like a sweetheart. We pick peaches and yap and then do a Cornmaze. Nothing about our last date is brought up. He doesn‚Äôt give me a hug or a kiss or any kind of affection. I think he‚Äôs just tired. I bring him home, and he picks the worst looking peaches and looks at me and says ‚Äú we should get lunch‚Äù doesn‚Äôt wait for a response and leaves the car and is gone. Like within 2 seconds he was in his house. Not really weird for him. When he‚Äôs done he‚Äôs done.

I don‚Äôt think much of it and we talk and are going to lunch this Friday. Idk when or where. He is still being consistent, and talking with me through text and has given me no indication of anything other than interest. But today I found the scrunchie in my car that he must have slipped into my passenger side door on our date at the peach festival on Sunday. He‚Äôs not too keen on me giving things to him so maybe he just didn‚Äôt want to have it? But yeah my anxiety is spiraling over a scrunchie he slipped back into my door. I could very well just ask him about it but yeah that sounds to my brain like a living hell.

I‚Äôm seeing him on Friday right and neither of us have brought up expectations or what we are looking for and I told him how I feel about him. He‚Äôs not very verbal in general but his actions and consistency show genuine interest and he asks me out on dates at the end of our dates and he‚Äôs sweet to me and talks and what not so I‚Äôm not sure how to approach the what are we situation. We‚Äôve been doing on 1-2 dates a week for the last five weeks so I‚Äôm feeling on the fence about telling him to lock in or not because maybe he isn‚Äôt ready or something. My real fear here is school is coming up and he‚Äôs gonna kick me to the curb after this lunch date.

So yeah any ideas for advice on not spiraling into oblivion or bringing up the what are we deal that would be lovely. Thank you humans for listening to my chaos that I know I could totally approach him about but it‚Äôs that fear of the unknown that‚Äôs stopping me blah blah blah",0,1755718397.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

Jules\~

I'm running.

I'm always running.

I push my bag higher up my shoulder and shove through the people walking along the sidewalk. Nothing, but terror was running through me and it wasn't going away anytime soon. Even though I'd made it out, there was no doubt I was still scared. Scared he would find me. Use me, just like he always did.

He always found me.

Not anymore. I was determined to make it. To disappear from the life I never wanted to be accustomed to. I'd run away from the place I'd thought was supposed to be my safe haven. The place that had given me a false sense of security.

And I wasn't going back.

I pick up my pace when I hear the familiar faint sound of footsteps behind me, matching my rhythm. I don't have to turn around to know it's him. The one person I'm desperately trying to get away from. The one man who's the cause all of my hurt.

Ryker.

My moms boyfriend.

Glancing back, I can see his large form catching up with me and by the looks of it, he's pissed. I push my legs faster as I weave around poles and pedestrians. Knowing the things he'd do when he's that angry only made me push myself that much harder.

I shake my head at the thought. Those things...children should never have to go through any of that. The abuse...

Stop it, Jules.

Of course, I had my mother. I was never lacking in that department. Still, that never made a difference. She was either always high or indifferent to what was going on with me. I don't know when I'd realized that she never once cared for me, but I did. I'd realized it one night as I was laying limp on the bathroom floor.

It had taken me months to get over it. I didn't want to believe it and yet, the truth was right there in my face. When I'd come to the realization that I would rather kill myself than stay, I made the decision to choose my own future. Whether that meant to live or die, it didn't matter. I wanted out.

So I ran.

With a duffel bag stuffed full of clothes- a hoodie, jeans, and my only pair of shoes- I'd thought that sneaking out the back window was my best option. The doors were too creaky and I was sure they'd hear me if I'd attempted it. The last time I'd checked, my mother had been sitting in the living room with Ryker, most likely chugging down beers and sniffing coke off the living room table.

I'd thought I was home free, crossing the front yard and making it across the street when I heard the front door burst open. I turned, making eye contact with Ryker who stood in the doorway, a scowl on his face. I didn't have to think about anything right then. I just turned and started booking it into the city. I could hear him yell after me, but ignored it as I shot into oncoming traffic.

I'd gotten far enough to where I had thought he'd just let me go. Let me be. I mean, they never wanted me there anyways. Wouldn't it just be best if I disappeared? Still, I knew better. He was never going to let me go that easily. He never did.

Gripping onto the strap of my bag, I ran across the street just as a car goes flying past my back. Missing me by an inch, thank god.

I stop and turn around, paying them no mind as I search the street behind me. I hear them honk and throw a few choice words at me before speeding off, but it falls on deaf ears. I'm too focused on Ryker as he watches me from across. I've been running for miles and yet, he's not letting up.

Just let me go.

Luckily, a bus comes to a stop between us- blocking him from view- and I take this as my chance to start running again. I don't have a place in mind. No destination for where I'm going. All I know is that I had to get away from here. As far as my feet could take me.

I turn a corner, into an alley, thinking that if I get out of sight, he'll give up and go home. I sigh. Hope rising in my chest as I take fast strides along the walls.

I begin to think I'm in the clear when someone tackles me from the side. My right arm hits the brick wall and the force pushes us down onto the concrete.

My attacker shoves me onto my back as I try to kick him off of me. With no luck, I'm forced to face him and when I do, I turn to see that it's Ryker. His taunting smile that shows off his yellow and black teeth will forever be burned into my brain as I try- and fail- to twist out of his grip.

He's holding onto my forearms so tight that I know it's already bruised. Without thinking, I throw my knee up into his dick and feel his grip loosen. I push at his chest and try to crawl out from under him, but am only able to get so far when he reaches out to pull me back by my ankle.

Book1 Chapter2

He climbs over me and holds my wrists together with one hand as the other caresses my cheek, making me flinch. His knees are on either side of my body, keeping me pinned between them with little room to move. Not even the force of me kicking and squirming makes him budge.

""You might wanna stay still, sweet cheeks, or you'll be in even bigger trouble than you are now,"" He says, smiling that crazed smile.

""Get off me!"" I scream.

He does nothing, but laughs in return. I can feel the tears streaming down my face as I thrash beneath him, my breath picking up when he reaches a hand between us to unbuckle his pants. One hand now keeps both of my wrists pinned as I try my hardest to do something- anything- to shove him off.

""No, no, no! Please! Stop!"" I shout. It was useless.

I was useless.

""Don't worry,"" He laughs. ""You'll enjoy this.""

    I bolt upright in bed, glaring at the wall across from me as sweat covers my body from the reoccurring nightmare. The same one I've had for over 4 years now. In the beginning, it'd been a lot worse than what it is now. Still, it wasn't something I enjoyed.
    
    I'd wake up screaming and thrashing, tangled up in my bed sheets. There were times I'd wake up on the hardwood floor in a fetal position, my arms wrapped around me as my body shook. Sometimes it'd be so bad that I had small panic attacks in my sleep.
    
    Thankfully, it's dimmed over time. The memory of that night fades away, year after year. But no matter how hard I try, there are still moments that have been burned into my brain permanently. Moments that I dream about, night after night.
    
    Four years ago, in that alley, Ryker almost left me a shell of the person I used to be. Of the person I could've been. He'd been so close in scarring me permanently to the point of no return. So close in taking a precious part of me. Something I could never get back.
    
    Though, before he could, he was knocked unconscious from above. His limp body fell over me and I was able to shove him off, crawling backwards toward the alley wall until I felt the cool bricks touch my back.
    
    I'd wiped the tears off my cheeks as I stared at his body. Good Riddance. Relief flooding me briefly before I tensed, turning slowly to face my savior.
    
    My father.
    
    The same father that I was led to believe had been dead. The same one who'd watched over me without me knowing. He'd been the reason I'd walked away from that alley with my life in tact and a new purpose.
    
    Since that night, he'd brought me home to live with him. In the beginning, it'd taken a while for me to get used to the idea of him being my 'dad'. After all the shit Ryker had put me through, I think he'd known it wasn't easy for me to trust him.
    
    Still, I'd learned throughout the years that not all men were the same. He'd gotten me to open up around him. It wasn't much, but he'd done it. He'd shown me what it was like to have a parent.
    
    For 4 years, I've lived with him. Catching onto his habits and action's quite quickly. 4 years since he's been training me in his home gym, teaching me how to fight. How to defend myself, whether it'd be with a gun or my own body.
    
    It was nothing, but training and hard work up until I'd become better than even his best fighters. And yet, I couldn't find it in me to dislike this path he'd chosen for me. I was thankful for it. For all the years I've had to overcome my own fears. To become better than I was before.
    
    It's only made me learn to love him. Both as a teacher and a father.
    
    Now, I was waking up in the same town my nightmares had originally started. I'd thought it was best if I faced my past fears head on. If I were to come across Ryker at any time, I'd be ready. I was back and better than ever.
    
    At least, I was better when I was awake. I'd never been able to stop the fear from interfering when my eyes were closed. Actually, it's gotten to a point where I let it come. I welcome it. I let myself feel the trauma and pain that comes whenever I'm in limbo. Really, what else could I do?
    
    I knew I could take it. I had to. As long as I could get through the night, it can't affect me. I'd gotten stronger- both physically and mentally- thanks to my father. He'd taught me how to fight the things I'd been running from, even if I couldn't see it.
    
    Eventually, I'd picked up a few of my own habits that would come in handy over time. In this world, you'd learn the hard way that if you wanted to get by, you had to take what you wanted. Whether it's by force or not, then by all means. Take it. In four years, I'd changed completely.
    
    Book1 Chapter3
    
    Thanks to him.
    
    Considering I had 'talent', I chose to keep it hidden. Most people decided to show it off and lay it all out in the ring for boasts and greed. They get off on that shit. That could never be me.
    
    The only time I put my training to any use was to make enough money to get me by. Enough for me to build something on. The only way I found I could do that, was to fight in the ring at a place called The Underground.
    
    It's exactly what you would think of when you hear it. The Underground. It's a fight club thats, ironically, held underground. Beneath a restaurant called Squels. The entrance was a back door with steps leading up to the alley behind the street.
    
    And you know the first rule of fight club?
    
    Throwing the covers off, I stand and walk to the bathroom to brush my teeth and wash my face. When I'm done, I style my hair and change into faded blue jeans that fold at the bottom, pairing it with a white v-neck and ankle boots. I grabbed my keys from the coffee table and headed to work.
    
    Work consisted of an 80's themed restaurant that was stationed just outside of town called Sal's Diner. It was cute, but secluded. Just a regular diner that always had a flow of customers. I'd decided I needed something legal to cover my late night hobby.
    
    Before I'd moved out, my father had informed me that he needed to take care of some business and wanted to be sure I'd be safe. He'd sent me back here, to this town, ensuring I'd be well taken care of. Leaving me with only his promise that he would check up on me.
    
    Walking into the diner, I see Candy standing at the cashier, greeting a family of three. She was the only friend I'd made since I've been back. Talk about music and Disney movies are what brought us together at first. Her fiery personality is what initially keeps us friends and I was thankful for it. Where I lacked, she embraced.
    
    She had pink highlights that stood out in contrast to her blonde hair. She believed she was a rebel and thought it made her look 'dangerous'. I remember I'd told her it made her look more like flamingo and she flipped me off.
    
    Still, I wouldn't let the hair fool you. Candy was almost as sweet as her name.
    
    Almost.
    
    ""What's up, girly,"" she says, giving me a smile as she leans over the front stand, popping her gum.
    
    ""Hey, Candy. Roy in there?"" I said, nodding my head towards the back where the kitchen was.
    
    ""Yeah. He's setting up the grill for an order.""
    
    ""Okay."" I give her a small smile and head towards the double doors. ""Thanks.""
    
    Roy was our main cook and someone I looked up to as a second father figure. He was there for me when I didn't- couldn't- ask my father for help, which was most of the time. I wanted him to believe I could be here on my own.
    
    When I walked in, he's dancing around the kitchen, doing moves from what I'm guessing is from his time. I grin and lean against the door frame, watching his back as he continues. I had to say, for a 50 year old, he was in good shape.
    
    ""Even in your condition, you still got some moves,"" I start to say when he realizes he's not alone.
    
    He turns and smiles my way when he see's me. ""My girl. You finally decided to show up.""
    
    He opens his arms for me and I walk into them. His hug is warm and his arms are firm as they squeeze me in. The cologne that wafts into my nose gives me a sense of familiarity that I hold on to. A sense of security. That sense of home.
    
    ""You didn't think I'd forget, right?"" I pull back and let go of him as my hands land on my hips. I look up at him as he steps back and continues working the grill.
    
    ""Well when you didn't come back for three days, I didn't know what to think.""
    
    I instantly felt guilty. I hadn't come to work for three days because I'd gone to the Underground. I was in need of a stress relief and knew I'd find it in the only place no one would ask questions at. Unfortunately, my opponent was a wild one and it had taken me more than my usual strength to win.
    
    I'd gone home with bruises along my arms, jaw, and across my belly. My eye was swollen and blue and my hands needed a bit of stitching along my knuckles. Thankfully, it wasn't as bad as it seemed. Three days of healing and I was back to normal. It had to be a record. Still, there was no way I wanted them to see me like that.
    
    ""Yeah. Sorry about that. I was...occupied."" At that, he turns and shoots me a knowing look.
    
    Roy has known about me fighting in The Underground ever since he came to my apartment one night after I'd left my keys at the diner and saw me bruised up, laying outside my front door.
    
    Book1 Chapter4
    
    After helping me inside and prying the information out of me, he's been watching out for me. He doesn't like it or agree with it, but he never tries to change me. He believes everyone should make their own choices. Still, it always comes with a side of scolding.
    
    ""Juliana."" He knows I hate it when he uses my full name. ""You know how I feel about you fighting. I told you that you don't have to do that. I can help you.""
    
    ""No, Roy. I want to do it. I can't and I won't let you use your money on me. Please. I make enough to keep my lights on and put food in my fridge. Honestly, it's fine.""
    
    ""No. I hate knowing you go to that place and do what you do just to get extra cash,"" he says, shaking his head in disgust as he turns away from me.
    
    I lay my hand on his as he sets the spatula down. ""Please, Roy. I need to do this. It's the only way I can let go of what I have pent up inside. The money is just a bonus.""
    
    I hear him sigh as he faces me with a knowing look. After opening up to him, Roy now knows what I've had to go through all those years ago. All those nights at my mother's house did a number on me and now I was having to deal with it in the present. He knows the only way I can let out what I felt in the past was in the ring.
    
    He looks me in the eyes before nodding. ""Fine. But if it gets too intense, you're done. You hear me?""
    
    I nod and smile up at him before turning to the grill, clasping my hands together. ""Now, what do you need help with?""
    
    He sighs, but I could tell he was happy with the subject change. ""Nothing. But the diner should be pretty busy by now. Why don't you go help Candy out front with the service before Wesley gets here.""
    
    Wesley was the owner of Sal's Diner. It was once owned by his father and his father's father and so on. I didn't know who Sal was in his family, but I did know that it only made sense if Wesley had taken over. I'd imagine he would've changed it to Wesley's Diner, but never had the chance.
    
    I turn and head to put my belongings in the back before I went to help out front. I shrugged my apron on and grabbed my notepad and pen before pushing past the double doors. When I get there, more costumers have shown up and I glance over to see Candy was seating a family of 4 in her section.
    
    I grab our fresh pot of coffee and head toward our customers sitting at the counter, filling and refilling their mugs until I come to a stop in front of one of our regulars.
    
    ""How are you, Mr. Greeghan?"" I said, pouring some into his mug and placing his cup back in front of him.
    
    ""Mornin' Jules. Other than my diabetes and high cholesterol, I'm fine."" He takes a sip out of his cup and lifts his newspaper back up to his face.
    
    I smile. He was one of mine. He always sat in my section and was reaching his 59th birthday. He wasn't much for chatter though. Every morning, at the same time, he'd come in and order the same thing.
    
    ""Well, alright then,"" I say, turning to stick his already written order up on a pin for the kitchen to see.
    
    ""Alright then."" He raises his cup to me without taking his eyes off his paper and I turn to set the coffee pot back in its place.
    
    I shake my head at him and walk over to grab a rag to begin wiping down the counter as I take the empty plates of the people who had just left. I'd just turned back to the counter to continue when I heard the bell ring above the door. I stop and look up to greet the customers who'd just walked in when I freeze.
    
    Four guys looking as sinful as the devil himself stood at the door, eyeing the diner and the people in it. The one who walked in first had dirty blonde hair that was pushed back. A toothpick hung from his mouth as he walked over to a corner booth, sliding in as his friends followed.
    
    The second and third had black matted hair that was styled to perfection. One was slicked back and the other left his to hang over his dark eyes. I watched as they turned, their wide shoulders following blondie to his booth. It was only when the fourth one came into view that I realized I'd lost focus.
    
    He had light brown hair that looked like he'd run his fingers through it too much. It was messy, but impossibly sexy. He had on a black v-neck with faded Levi's and boots. His brown hazel eyes darted around the diner as he stood there. I can't lie, he was a sight for sore eyes. He definitely knew he was fine.
    
    And still, I definitely knew he was trouble. Trouble with a capital T.
    
    Book1 Chapter5
    
    ""Whew. Is it hot in here or is it just them!"" Candy says, coming to stand next to me behind the counter as we watch him make his way to his friends.
    
    I notice her fanning her face with her hand, smirking at them until she turns to face me.
    
    ""I don't know."" I shrug and go back to wiping the counter. ""I'm pretty cold. Did we leave a window open in here?""
    
    She lifts a brow at me and gives me a flat face. ""Really? So you didn't notice the four hot guys that just walked through the door?""
    
    ""I noticed. I just didn't care."" Her jaw drops as I turn to stuff straws into my apron before pulling out my notepad. ""What?"" I question.
    
    Roy calls for an order up and I step behind her to grab Mr. Greeghans plate as she follows me.
    
    ""Are you blind? Or sick?"" She goes to feel my forehead and I swat her hand away.
    
    ""Are you? Because I'm pretty sure our new costumers have been waiting to get their orders taken for the past five minutes."" I point over my shoulder at the men who have arrived as I set Mr. Greeghans meal down in front of him.
    
    Candy looks over to where they've decided to plant their asses at and begins fixing her clothes, brushing her hair out of her eyes.
    
    ""How do I look?"" She asks.
    
    I smirk. ""Like you were electrocuted.""
    
    ""Haha. Funny,"" she said, giving me a fake smile as she rolls her eyes. I just laugh as she flips me off, grabbing a pitcher full of water before making her way towards their table.
    
    I lean against the counter and watch as she stands there with her notepad in hand, ready to take their order. The four of them look up at her as she talks for what looks like nonstop and I wonder what she was saying. Hopefully, it's nothing embarrassing. Knowing her, she'll relive that moment in her head for months to come.
    
    After what seems like years, I notice the dirty blonde haired one shoots her a smile and starts talking while pointing to the others. After a while, the guy with the slick back sits up and starts to say something that makes himself laugh. He's cut off when the other three glare over at him.
    
    Blondie says something to Candy once again and I watch as she nods her head before turning to walk towards me.
    
    ""Well? How was the four Prince Charmings?"" I said, trying to hide my smile at her frustration.
    
    She slams her notepad down on the counter. ""Trust me. They are far from Prince Charmings. They just kept staring at me like I killed their cat. I could barely get their orders."" She rolls her eyes and sighs as she fidgets with her pen quietly. Looking closely, I notice a smile threatening to break free. ""At least the blonde haired one was sweet.""
    
    I snort at her tone of voice. ""Yeah. Good luck."" I turn to go back to work when my eyes catch his.
    
    Troubles eye.
    
    He was staring at me with this intense look that, no doubt, made people shit their pants and offer up their first born willingly. But not me. I stared back, both daring and questioning him. I was never one to back down so easily.

1mvok26,https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsySellers/comments/1mvok26/personalization_boosted_my_sales_and_my_gray_hairs/,Personalization boosted my sales‚Ä¶ and my gray hairs,"When I first added personalization to my POD store, I thought I‚Äôd struck gold. Customers could add their names, change colors, tweak the text, it made every product feel ‚Äúone-of-a-kind,‚Äù and the sales proved it. My best month before personalization was around 80 orders. My first month after? 130 orders. I was buzzing.

But‚Ä¶ nobody told me about the other side of personalization. Suddenly my inbox was flooded with ‚ÄúCan you make the blue a little lighter?‚Äù or ‚ÄúActually, can you change the name from Alex to Alexander?‚Äù after the order was placed. Some people sent three emails with changes in the same day. And then there were the typos‚Ä¶ so many typos. I once had to redo a batch of mugs because someone spelled their own last name wrong and swore it was my fault.

I also ran into customers who didn‚Äôt read the previews carefully. I‚Äôd send mockups showing exactly what their design would look like, but then they‚Äôd complain the font was ‚Äúdifferent than expected‚Äù or that their chosen color wasn‚Äôt as vibrant. POD fulfillment centers aren‚Äôt Photoshop, colors can shift slightly in print, and fine details don‚Äôt always translate perfectly.

At one point, I switched most of my custom listings over to suppliers on Printify that had live preview tools built into their ordering process (I am sure other POD companies give good tools too). That alone cut down about 90% of my ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know it would look like this‚Äù messages. I still had the occasional late-night ‚ÄúCan you change this?‚Äù email, but the difference was night and day.

After a few chaotic months, I learned:

* **Lock your customization rules.** No open-ended ‚Äúwrite whatever you want‚Äù fields. Limit choices.  
* **Use live previews** if your platform (or your supplier, like the Printify ones I found) supports it. Total lifesaver.  
* **Set deadlines for changes.** I give customers 4 hours after ordering to request edits.  
* **Double-check inputs.** If a name looks suspicious, I ask.  

Do I still offer personalization? Yes, margins are solid, and customers genuinely love getting something made just for them. But now I‚Äôm picky. I stick to designs where personalization can‚Äôt easily go wrong (like initials instead of long phrases), and I build the extra time into my pricing.

In short: personalization is amazing for standing out in the POD market, but it‚Äôs not ‚Äúset it and forget it.‚Äù It‚Äôs more like ‚Äúset it, babysit it‚Ä¶ and keep coffee on hand.‚Äù

1mvojrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/lichensclerosus/comments/1mvojrl/my_ls_healing_experience/,My LS Healing Experience,"Greetings all...I went to see a dermatologist for this skin condition (LS) that i‚Äôm dealing with since 2020. He prescribed corticosteroids in a cream version. It‚Äôs a cream which helped with alleviating the symptoms and itchyness on my knob/ head (glans penis).. in the beginning.

After several months i noticed the cream was giving me rashes and pimples around my shoulder blades. Those were symptoms from my body, trying to detox from the corticosteroid cream. The cream also made the skin even thinner which is¬† exactly what you don‚Äôt want to happen when dealing with LS.¬†

I found out later that the thinning is also listed in the package insert as one of the side effects of the cream. The cream also¬† gave me erectile problems. I stopped using that crap right there. The negative side effects subsided within a few weeks. I‚Äôm usually into natural healing methods but couldn‚Äôt find info about healing LS naturally at that point.

Because of the very negative effects from the corticosteroids i started doing more research about natural ways of healing LS.

Well i found out that for me the skin condition had to do with a combination of things like damage to the skin, not treating that immediately or properly, lack of vitamins combined with emotional and hormonal imbalances which in the long run translated into physical issues, and i also think in my case a lack of collagen intake/ production was an issue.¬†

Long story short..i came accross a comment in a forum about LS in 2024 where someone mentioned using castor oil mixed with lavender essential oil and coconut oil mixed with lavender essential oil.¬†So I decided to give it a try.

In the beginning i applied these natural products once or twice a day. But it wasn‚Äôt until having more and more flare-ups after consuming coffee, bread & pastry (gluten), processed sugar and maybe also dairy, and more recently hot peppers in foods, that i started applying castor oil with essential lavenderoil at least 4 times a day. That‚Äôs when i started noticing a positive change on my skin. I‚Äôm in the middle of that situation now. So it‚Äôs still a work in progress and i‚Äôm looking forward to see what the results will be in a few weeks and months from now. I have no negative side effects from these natural products and have been applying them for almost a year now.

Castor oil recipe:

2 tablespoons of castor oil mixed with 3 drops essential lavender oil

Coconut oil recipe:

2 tablespoons of virgin coconut oil (melted on a very low temperature), mixed with 3 drops essential lavender oil. Virgin coconut oil means cold pressed.

All products should be organic and should be bought and stored in glass or metal containers, especially castor oil because it has high absorbtion properties.

Castor oil reaches deep into the tissue, hydrates the skin and keeps the skin flexible. Untill now, Castor oil was for me also able to unfuse some fused foreskin a bit. I‚Äôm noticing that unfusing, and healing in general can take some time.¬†

Virgin Coconut oil helps me to alleviate the itchyness and stinging from skin lesions pretty fast. It also moisturizes and hydrates. Plain virgin coconut oil is for me also very helpfull with treating fungal infections (i.g candida). I also use just plain virgin coconut oil as lubricant during sexual intercourse.

Lavender essential oil is said to be helpfull with skin repair.¬†

What i also find helpfull for my urinary tract which also started feeling irritated and itchy everytime i went to the loo was supplementing on cranberry tincture at least 3 times a day. The irritation in my urinary tract was almost gone after a few weeks.

I also upped the dose of my other vitamins and minerals intake. I‚Äôm taking a lot of vitamin C capsules. Vitamin C is important for repair on a cellular level, skin repair included. I upped my curcumin capsules intake. It‚Äôs important to take a two week pause with the curcumin intake every two weeks. Curcumin is a natural antibiotic and helps with reducing inflamation.

I also found out Shae Butter Nilotica is also helpfull for me with alleviating itchyness and stinging from skin lesions.¬†

And I also started taking collagen supplement and using gelatin which is a great source of collagen.

I ADVICE TO SEEK ADVICE FROM A PRACTITIONER OR SPECIALIST ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION AND THE USE OF ESSENTIAL OILS

Last thing i would like to mention is..

I noticed some people mentioning the term ‚Äòauto-immune‚Äô. I don‚Äôt fall into that auto immune trap which medical science says it means that ‚Äòyour body is attacking itself‚Äô. Saying something is an auto-immune condition is taking our power away to heal. Because it‚Äôs suggesting there‚Äôs nothing we can do about it except for treating symptoms. Symptoms are signs from our bodies that there are things we should pay (more) attention to.

Our bodies are never attacking us. Our bodies are always working for us. Our bodies don‚Äôt make mistakes. Our bodies are giving us signals when things are out of balance. Our bodies are designed to heal.",2,1755717794.0,lichensclerosus,0,1.0,False

They know exactly how to get under eachothers' skins. Omg how low do they go and how petty they are. The feelings and passion are still there but turned 180. So when Wednesday says 

>....she saw the real you. An expendable nobody. A feeble minded schoolyard bully with nothing to offer the world except for subpar barista skills. Your fleeting moment of notoriety will fade quicker than your generic looks. Thinking of you rotting away in this cell in anonymous mediocrity, that...is the best revenge 

....she knows exactly what she is doing. I think Tyler believes that Wednesday was only interested in him because she has sensed the hyde in him somehow. He was almost gleeful when he's noticed Wednesday develops an interest with the monster. And he's admitted his bullying behaviour was because he was bitter about his situation in life - he thinks he's a nobody. And from what we know of his family life, he might have subconciously thought he's not worthy of love and intrest as he grew up without a mother, and his father neglected him emotionally. 

I think Tyler was kind of in awe of Wednesday, of her knowledge and talents and personality (during their first meeting she's fixed a professional coffee machine, proved she knows Italian fluently, disarmed three bullies and planned her escape from school). Tyler was proud that a girl like that took interest in him, but because his self esteem was so low, believed that it was only because of hyde in him.

So Wednesday's words were absolutely brutal and gut wrenching for him (but totally understandable given the circumstances). Wednesday has won that psychological warfare handsdown. ",10,1755717332.0,weyler,1,1.0,False

It's hard to follow conversations and I just can't even make choices about basic stuff like making a powerpoint. Like I am trying so hard and I can't. I get paid hourly which makes it hard. because I spend all day trying to work and then have to take a break and it's really limiting my income. 

  
What gets you guys through when you're struggling? I drink as much coffee as I can tolerate and I'm hoping to keep working with my doctor and get some answers but even just typing this and sitting in bed I'm out of breath.

1mvoa1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/F4481/comments/1mvoa1s/people_coming_up_to_me_that_i_dont_recognize/,People coming up to me that I don't recognize," Regularly, people will come up to me when I'm at my regular coffee spot or walking around town, call me by name (or by a different name) and ask me how I'm doing, strike up a conversation, talk about details of my life that make it very clear they know me, and expect a response. I don't remember these people or know where I know them from. Some of them I find vaguely familiar face-wise, but definitely not enough to carry on a meaningful conversation.

Sometimes I can just nod along, smile, and answer questions, but sometimes it's clear they expect me to ask about their life and goings-on in response, and I genuinely have no clue who they are. I'm somewhat distinctive and known in town, I have a public-facing job, a distinctive bike, and frequent local businesses a lot. Generally I seem to be pretty recognizable, which makes it even more of a problem. 

Does anyone else run into this? It throws me for a loop every time, and the first few times I thought I was just forgetful, but it kept happening and I need some strategy to not seem like a complete asshole and to be able to relate to people I ‚Äúdon't know‚Äù- i.e. knew and forgot, or was in a different state when I met. I feel horrible every time. 

Sometimes I apologise and say I'm face blind and terrible with names, but a lot of the time I feel that comes out sounding like a flimsy excuse for not caring about people.

Using the Moen 9601 ChoiceFlo Replacement Water Filter in my kitchen faucet felt natural and convenient. Its compact dimensions (2.5""D x 2.5""W x 7.2""H) make it effortless to install discreetly under the sink. When I first unpacked it, I was delighted by the durable carbon fiber construction, which feels way sturdier than some generic filters I‚Äôve tested before. Despite its humble ""unfinished"" appearance, this filter seamlessly matches my kitchen setup without sticking out awkwardly. Not requiring tools or water shutoff was a huge win because I didn‚Äôt have to call my brother (my go-to fix-it guy) for once! You just twist it into place, and voil√†‚Äîdone within minutes.

**Performance That Exceeds Expectations**

The water clarity and taste improvement blew me away after merely a day of use. Living in a hard water area, I‚Äôd pretty much resigned myself to funky-tasting tap water. This replacement filter noticeably reduces odors and impurities within seconds of running the faucet. It‚Äôs also engineered to preserve essential fluoride, which is a thoughtful design advantage. With NSF certification, I‚Äôm reassured it meets high standards. I drink a ton of water daily and even my coffee flavor seems heightened now. Additionally, you only need to replace it every six months. Honestly? That‚Äôs a game-changer for someone as forgetful as me.

[Check Moen 9601 ChoiceFlo Replacement Water Filter price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0012c4ptm/)

**Advantages**

- Long-lasting and needs replacing only twice a year.  
- Easy installation without requiring tools or shutting off water.  
- Material ensures durability‚Äîideal for daily use.  

**Potential Drawbacks**

- Some users mentioned sporadic issues with fitting certain faucet models seamlessly.  
- Its price point might feel slightly steep compared to standard filters.  

**Target User-Focused Features**

If you own Moen Sip, Chateau, or AquaSuite series kitchen faucets, this product is particularly invaluable. My neighbor tested it on a non-Moen faucet, and while they could force it into place, the tight fit led to some leakage concerns. However, within its intended range of faucets, the functionality is flawless. As someone with the Moen Sip, the replacement integrated perfectly with the existing setup. For families with kids who drink a lot of water, this kind of superior filtration becomes indispensable.

**Drawbacks**

- Limited compatibility to specific faucet series only.  
- Compact build, though sleek, makes it easy to misplace.  

**Rival Brands**

I‚Äôve toyed around with Pur and Brita filters before and even experimented briefly with Culligan. The Pur faucet filters arguably provide a similar level of filtration but often come with bulkier designs that ruin your sink aesthetic. Brita countertop or pitcher filters are decent for casual use but can‚Äôt match this product‚Äôs ease of access for direct faucet usage. Culligan, while robust, lacks that low-effort tool-free installation feature I‚Äôve come to adore. Compared to its competitors, this water filter is an amazing option for Moen faucets users.

**True Value**

Owning such reliable water filtration capability felt like the right choice, especially as a health-conscious individual. Another key highlight is its included battery for the electronic filter life indicator‚Äîensuring no second-guessing over when to replace it. It‚Äôs hard to assign an exact dollar figure to clean, crisp water every morning, but the compelling features packed into this filter justify the investment. If water purity matters to you as much as it does to me, then it‚Äôs worth every penny.

Listen I get the economy is bad but it is unreal that I‚Äôm paying $9-10 for a flavored 16oz oat milk latte at some places.

My fave shop out of state stopped charging extra for alternative milk, and they were never hurting for business. 

My current fave latte near me (bc they truly do make a mean caramel syrup and the coffee on its own is also good) - for a 16 oz they charge .80 more for oat milk and $1.05 for house made caramel syrup or $2 for honey lavender ($2 is insane, it doesn‚Äôt cost that much to make syrup lol I‚Äôve done it). So it comes to almost $10 for a 16oz drink. I‚Äôve heard they‚Äôre possibly opening another location too so clearly they aren‚Äôt hurting for business.

Now yes, I could just opt for no syrup or just make my own coffee at honey lol, but I like supporting local businesses sometimes and getting out of my house since I mostly work from home.

I guess it just bugs me that it feels very exploitative these days to charge so much extra on top of already expensive drinks when SO MANY people nowadays cannot drink regular milk, and the cost difference is genuinely not that great. I even checked the oat milk this place uses - I can tell you it does not cost them 80 cents more per drink to buy oat vs regular milk. They also don‚Äôt even offer a rewards program which is lame (at least Banjo offers this, even if their drinks are also pricey).

Why are we still penalizing people for not being able to drink whole milk üòÇ anyways, this is turning into a rant but I‚Äôd be interested to know if anyone visits coffee shops in Decatur or Atlanta that doesn‚Äôt up charge for every possible thing?

The food was quite bad, we paid 1200 something for three things and all three were quite average.


The cheese corn rolls tasted weirds and had some stale feeling not at all good for around 50/roll.



The pizza was also average, kinda felt undercooked and super expensive.


The pasta was the worst, has a weird smell, the sauce was not mixed properly with the pasta and the taste was also a waste.


Overall we had to wait for a while as well as they have limited seating.

Also we did not try any coffee from there because I didn't want caffine during evening, I am also considering the fact that this was my meal after breakfast so I was actually hungry as well which should make the food taste better.



Over all rating -1.5/5 for the property 


Oddly enough they have 4.8 stars on Google which is way too high, 3.6 to 4 would be better.


If you wish to visit this place I wouldn't recommend you personally, even the parking space is limited.

1mvo6it,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundShape/comments/1mvo6it/assess_best_overear_headphones_poly_voyager_focus/,Assess best over-ear headphones Poly Voyager Focus UC worth it for calls and music?,"Testing the Poly 211710-101 Voyager Focus UC daily has been an immersive experience, and I can say it‚Äôs quite the standout in the realm of professional headsets. As someone constantly toggling between calls, meetings, and some downtime grooving to music, this headset truly checks multiple boxes. While it‚Äôs solid in numerous aspects, there are areas that prospective users should consider before diving in.

**Sound Quality that Delivers Every Detail**

Audio performance is critical for any headset, and this wireless Bluetooth option excels by providing vibrant sound. Whether I‚Äôm on work calls or listening to my favorite album, the clarity this headset offers is top-notch. The stereo mode delivers distinct, rich sounds from both speakers, creating an immersive experience no matter the activity. Even during my virtual yoga sessions, the deep frequency range of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz made every calm tone resonate with perfection.

**Outstanding Noise-Canceling Technology**

The noise-canceling feature has been a lifesaver in my busy household. From barking dogs to neighbors hammering away at DIY projects, this headset ensured those distractions were left out of my work calls. The Active Noise Canceling (ANC) pairs effortlessly with a noise-isolating microphone, making my voice heard clearly even amidst chaos. Whether in open offices or bustling coffee shops, this feature makes interacting on calls a breeze.

**Check Poly 211710-101 Voyager Focus UC deals on [Amazon](https://visionhut.com/p/b08f8v6fpg/).**

**Comfortable and Practical Design**

Its over-the-ear design sits snugly without clamping uncomfortably on my head. Hours of wear during back-to-back conferences barely left me feeling that familiar headphone fatigue. The lightweight build, at just 5.5 ounces, truly makes a difference. Plus, the inclusion of a protective case means I can toss it in my bag for commutes or travel without worrying about damage. It‚Äôs worth noting that the headset includes touch-sensitive controls, making it convenient to adjust volume or skip tracks without pulling out my phone.

**Fantastic Bluetooth Range and Connectivity**

This device boasts a whopping 98-foot wireless range. I tested this claim by wandering around my apartment, leaving the paired device in one corner‚Äîno skips, no interruptions. It‚Äôs equipped with Bluetooth version 4.0, which could feel slightly dated depending on your tech, but it maintains an undeniably strong, stable connection. Pairing it with both my PC and mobile phone was seamless thanks to its universal compatibility.

**Unboxing Experience and Setup Simplicity**

Everything you need comes ready-to-go: the Voyager Focus UC headset itself, a USB-C connector, and a protective case. Batteries are pre-inserted (which is a major plus). Setting it up required nothing more than connecting the device to Bluetooth in under two minutes. For someone like me who values simplicity, this was a welcome feature.

**Strengths**

- Exceptionally clear sound quality in both audio modes  
- Professional-level noise-canceling capability  
- Comfortable, lightweight design for prolonged use  
- Strong wireless Bluetooth range for versatile movement  

**Drawbacks**

- Bluetooth version 4.0 feels slightly outdated in 2024  
- Battery life might require charging during prolonged, multi-day use  
- Lacks an included charging dock in some packages  

**Product Rivals in the Market**

Comparing this headset to competitors, such as the Sony WH-1000XM4 or Bose QuietComfort 45, demonstrates mixed findings. Where the Sony excels is its battery life, which outpaces the Poly, lasting days without needing a charge. Bose, on the other hand, delivers strikingly deeper bass levels if music is your primary activity. However, both Sony and Bose products generally lean heavier, making long hours of wear slightly less comfortable. The Voyager Focus UC holds its ground by being an ideal choice for those who want premium call quality and don‚Äôt want to compromise on comfort.

**Bang for the Buck**

While some might argue that other high-end models offer more premium features, this headset performs admirably within its price range. Its professional-grade noise cancellation, immersive sound, and comfortable wear should justify the investment, especially for individuals heavily reliant on virtual communication or needing distraction-free workflow support.

Book1 Chapter1

Jules~

I'm running.

I'm always running.

I push my bag higher up my shoulder and shove through the people walking along the sidewalk. Nothing, but terror was running through me and it wasn't going away anytime soon. Even though I'd made it out, there was no doubt I was still scared. Scared he would find me. Use me, just like he always did.

He always found me.

Not anymore. I was determined to make it. To disappear from the life I never wanted to be accustomed to. I'd run away from the place I'd thought was supposed to be my safe haven. The place that had given me a false sense of security.

And I wasn't going back.

I pick up my pace when I hear the familiar faint sound of footsteps behind me, matching my rhythm. I don't have to turn around to know it's him. The one person I'm desperately trying to get away from. The one man who's the cause all of my hurt.

Ryker.

My moms boyfriend.

Glancing back, I can see his large form catching up with me and by the looks of it, he's pissed. I push my legs faster as I weave around poles and pedestrians. Knowing the things he'd do when he's that angry only made me push myself that much harder.

I shake my head at the thought. Those things...children should never have to go through any of that. The abuse...

Stop it, Jules.

Of course, I had my mother. I was never lacking in that department. Still, that never made a difference. She was either always high or indifferent to what was going on with me. I don't know when I'd realized that she never once cared for me, but I did. I'd realized it one night as I was laying limp on the bathroom floor.

It had taken me months to get over it. I didn't want to believe it and yet, the truth was right there in my face. When I'd come to the realization that I would rather kill myself than stay, I made the decision to choose my own future. Whether that meant to live or die, it didn't matter. I wanted out.

So I ran.

With a duffel bag stuffed full of clothes- a hoodie, jeans, and my only pair of shoes- I'd thought that sneaking out the back window was my best option. The doors were too creaky and I was sure they'd hear me if I'd attempted it. The last time I'd checked, my mother had been sitting in the living room with Ryker, most likely chugging down beers and sniffing coke off the living room table.

I'd thought I was home free, crossing the front yard and making it across the street when I heard the front door burst open. I turned, making eye contact with Ryker who stood in the doorway, a scowl on his face. I didn't have to think about anything right then. I just turned and started booking it into the city. I could hear him yell after me, but ignored it as I shot into oncoming traffic.

I'd gotten far enough to where I had thought he'd just let me go. Let me be. I mean, they never wanted me there anyways. Wouldn't it just be best if I disappeared? Still, I knew better. He was never going to let me go that easily. He never did.

Gripping onto the strap of my bag, I ran across the street just as a car goes flying past my back. Missing me by an inch, thank god.

I stop and turn around, paying them no mind as I search the street behind me. I hear them honk and throw a few choice words at me before speeding off, but it falls on deaf ears. I'm too focused on Ryker as he watches me from across. I've been running for miles and yet, he's not letting up.

Just let me go.

Luckily, a bus comes to a stop between us- blocking him from view- and I take this as my chance to start running again. I don't have a place in mind. No destination for where I'm going. All I know is that I had to get away from here. As far as my feet could take me.

I turn a corner, into an alley, thinking that if I get out of sight, he'll give up and go home. I sigh. Hope rising in my chest as I take fast strides along the walls.

I begin to think I'm in the clear when someone tackles me from the side. My right arm hits the brick wall and the force pushes us down onto the concrete.

My attacker shoves me onto my back as I try to kick him off of me. With no luck, I'm forced to face him and when I do, I turn to see that it's Ryker. His taunting smile that shows off his yellow and black teeth will forever be burned into my brain as I try- and fail- to twist out of his grip.

He's holding onto my forearms so tight that I know it's already bruised. Without thinking, I throw my knee up into his dick and feel his grip loosen. I push at his chest and try to crawl out from under him, but am only able to get so far when he reaches out to pull me back by my ankle.

Book1 Chapter2

He climbs over me and holds my wrists together with one hand as the other caresses my cheek, making me flinch. His knees are on either side of my body, keeping me pinned between them with little room to move. Not even the force of me kicking and squirming makes him budge.

""You might wanna stay still, sweet cheeks, or you'll be in even bigger trouble than you are now,"" He says, smiling that crazed smile.

""Get off me!"" I scream.

He does nothing, but laughs in return. I can feel the tears streaming down my face as I thrash beneath him, my breath picking up when he reaches a hand between us to unbuckle his pants. One hand now keeps both of my wrists pinned as I try my hardest to do something- anything- to shove him off.

""No, no, no! Please! Stop!"" I shout. It was useless.

I was useless.

""Don't worry,"" He laughs. ""You'll enjoy this.""

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I bolt upright in bed, glaring at the wall across from me as sweat covers my body from the reoccurring nightmare. The same one I've had for over 4 years now. In the beginning, it'd been a lot worse than what it is now. Still, it wasn't something I enjoyed.

I'd wake up screaming and thrashing, tangled up in my bed sheets. There were times I'd wake up on the hardwood floor in a fetal position, my arms wrapped around me as my body shook. Sometimes it'd be so bad that I had small panic attacks in my sleep.

Thankfully, it's dimmed over time. The memory of that night fades away, year after year. But no matter how hard I try, there are still moments that have been burned into my brain permanently. Moments that I dream about, night after night.

Four years ago, in that alley, Ryker almost left me a shell of the person I used to be. Of the person I could've been. He'd been so close in scarring me permanently to the point of no return. So close in taking a precious part of me. Something I could never get back.

Though, before he could, he was knocked unconscious from above. His limp body fell over me and I was able to shove him off, crawling backwards toward the alley wall until I felt the cool bricks touch my back.

I'd wiped the tears off my cheeks as I stared at his body. Good Riddance. Relief flooding me briefly before I tensed, turning slowly to face my savior.

My father.

The same father that I was led to believe had been dead. The same one who'd watched over me without me knowing. He'd been the reason I'd walked away from that alley with my life in tact and a new purpose.

Since that night, he'd brought me home to live with him. In the beginning, it'd taken a while for me to get used to the idea of him being my 'dad'. After all the shit Ryker had put me through, I think he'd known it wasn't easy for me to trust him.

Still, I'd learned throughout the years that not all men were the same. He'd gotten me to open up around him. It wasn't much, but he'd done it. He'd shown me what it was like to have a parent.

For 4 years, I've lived with him. Catching onto his habits and action's quite quickly. 4 years since he's been training me in his home gym, teaching me how to fight. How to defend myself, whether it'd be with a gun or my own body.

It was nothing, but training and hard work up until I'd become better than even his best fighters. And yet, I couldn't find it in me to dislike this path he'd chosen for me. I was thankful for it. For all the years I've had to overcome my own fears. To become better than I was before.

It's only made me learn to love him. Both as a teacher and a father.

Now, I was waking up in the same town my nightmares had originally started. I'd thought it was best if I faced my past fears head on. If I were to come across Ryker at any time, I'd be ready. I was back and better than ever.

At least, I was better when I was awake. I'd never been able to stop the fear from interfering when my eyes were closed. Actually, it's gotten to a point where I let it come. I welcome it. I let myself feel the trauma and pain that comes whenever I'm in limbo. Really, what else could I do?

I knew I could take it. I had to. As long as I could get through the night, it can't affect me. I'd gotten stronger- both physically and mentally- thanks to my father. He'd taught me how to fight the things I'd been running from, even if I couldn't see it.

Eventually, I'd picked up a few of my own habits that would come in handy over time. In this world, you'd learn the hard way that if you wanted to get by, you had to take what you wanted. Whether it's by force or not, then by all means. Take it. In four years, I'd changed completely.

Book1 Chapter3

Thanks to him.

Considering I had 'talent', I chose to keep it hidden. Most people decided to show it off and lay it all out in the ring for boasts and greed. They get off on that shit. That could never be me.

The only time I put my training to any use was to make enough money to get me by. Enough for me to build something on. The only way I found I could do that, was to fight in the ring at a place called The Underground.

It's exactly what you would think of when you hear it. The Underground. It's a fight club thats, ironically, held underground. Beneath a restaurant called Squels. The entrance was a back door with steps leading up to the alley behind the street.

And you know the first rule of fight club?

Throwing the covers off, I stand and walk to the bathroom to brush my teeth and wash my face. When I'm done, I style my hair and change into faded blue jeans that fold at the bottom, pairing it with a white v-neck and ankle boots. I grabbed my keys from the coffee table and headed to work.

Work consisted of an 80's themed restaurant that was stationed just outside of town called Sal's Diner. It was cute, but secluded. Just a regular diner that always had a flow of customers. I'd decided I needed something legal to cover my late night hobby.

Before I'd moved out, my father had informed me that he needed to take care of some business and wanted to be sure I'd be safe. He'd sent me back here, to this town, ensuring I'd be well taken care of. Leaving me with only his promise that he would check up on me.

Walking into the diner, I see Candy standing at the cashier, greeting a family of three. She was the only friend I'd made since I've been back. Talk about music and Disney movies are what brought us together at first. Her fiery personality is what initially keeps us friends and I was thankful for it. Where I lacked, she embraced.

She had pink highlights that stood out in contrast to her blonde hair. She believed she was a rebel and thought it made her look 'dangerous'. I remember I'd told her it made her look more like flamingo and she flipped me off.

Still, I wouldn't let the hair fool you. Candy was almost as sweet as her name.

Almost.

""What's up, girly,"" she says, giving me a smile as she leans over the front stand, popping her gum.

""Hey, Candy. Roy in there?"" I said, nodding my head towards the back where the kitchen was.

""Yeah. He's setting up the grill for an order.""

""Okay."" I give her a small smile and head towards the double doors. ""Thanks.""

Roy was our main cook and someone I looked up to as a second father figure. He was there for me when I didn't- couldn't- ask my father for help, which was most of the time. I wanted him to believe I could be here on my own.

When I walked in, he's dancing around the kitchen, doing moves from what I'm guessing is from his time. I grin and lean against the door frame, watching his back as he continues. I had to say, for a 50 year old, he was in good shape.

""Even in your condition, you still got some moves,"" I start to say when he realizes he's not alone.

He turns and smiles my way when he see's me. ""My girl. You finally decided to show up.""

He opens his arms for me and I walk into them. His hug is warm and his arms are firm as they squeeze me in. The cologne that wafts into my nose gives me a sense of familiarity that I hold on to. A sense of security. That sense of home.

""You didn't think I'd forget, right?"" I pull back and let go of him as my hands land on my hips. I look up at him as he steps back and continues working the grill.

""Well when you didn't come back for three days, I didn't know what to think.""

I instantly felt guilty. I hadn't come to work for three days because I'd gone to the Underground. I was in need of a stress relief and knew I'd find it in the only place no one would ask questions at. Unfortunately, my opponent was a wild one and it had taken me more than my usual strength to win.

I'd gone home with bruises along my arms, jaw, and across my belly. My eye was swollen and blue and my hands needed a bit of stitching along my knuckles. Thankfully, it wasn't as bad as it seemed. Three days of healing and I was back to normal. It had to be a record. Still, there was no way I wanted them to see me like that.

""Yeah. Sorry about that. I was...occupied."" At that, he turns and shoots me a knowing look.

Roy has known about me fighting in The Underground ever since he came to my apartment one night after I'd left my keys at the diner and saw me bruised up, laying outside my front door.

Book1 Chapter4

After helping me inside and prying the information out of me, he's been watching out for me. He doesn't like it or agree with it, but he never tries to change me. He believes everyone should make their own choices. Still, it always comes with a side of scolding.

""Juliana."" He knows I hate it when he uses my full name. ""You know how I feel about you fighting. I told you that you don't have to do that. I can help you.""

""No, Roy. I want to do it. I can't and I won't let you use your money on me. Please. I make enough to keep my lights on and put food in my fridge. Honestly, it's fine.""

""No. I hate knowing you go to that place and do what you do just to get extra cash,"" he says, shaking his head in disgust as he turns away from me.

I lay my hand on his as he sets the spatula down. ""Please, Roy. I need to do this. It's the only way I can let go of what I have pent up inside. The money is just a bonus.""

I hear him sigh as he faces me with a knowing look. After opening up to him, Roy now knows what I've had to go through all those years ago. All those nights at my mother's house did a number on me and now I was having to deal with it in the present. He knows the only way I can let out what I felt in the past was in the ring.

He looks me in the eyes before nodding. ""Fine. But if it gets too intense, you're done. You hear me?""

I nod and smile up at him before turning to the grill, clasping my hands together. ""Now, what do you need help with?""

He sighs, but I could tell he was happy with the subject change. ""Nothing. But the diner should be pretty busy by now. Why don't you go help Candy out front with the service before Wesley gets here.""

Wesley was the owner of Sal's Diner. It was once owned by his father and his father's father and so on. I didn't know who Sal was in his family, but I did know that it only made sense if Wesley had taken over. I'd imagine he would've changed it to Wesley's Diner, but never had the chance.

I turn and head to put my belongings in the back before I went to help out front. I shrugged my apron on and grabbed my notepad and pen before pushing past the double doors. When I get there, more costumers have shown up and I glance over to see Candy was seating a family of 4 in her section.

I grab our fresh pot of coffee and head toward our customers sitting at the counter, filling and refilling their mugs until I come to a stop in front of one of our regulars.

""How are you, Mr. Greeghan?"" I said, pouring some into his mug and placing his cup back in front of him.

""Mornin' Jules. Other than my diabetes and high cholesterol, I'm fine."" He takes a sip out of his cup and lifts his newspaper back up to his face.

I smile. He was one of mine. He always sat in my section and was reaching his 59th birthday. He wasn't much for chatter though. Every morning, at the same time, he'd come in and order the same thing.

""Well, alright then,"" I say, turning to stick his already written order up on a pin for the kitchen to see.

""Alright then."" He raises his cup to me without taking his eyes off his paper and I turn to set the coffee pot back in its place.

I shake my head at him and walk over to grab a rag to begin wiping down the counter as I take the empty plates of the people who had just left. I'd just turned back to the counter to continue when I heard the bell ring above the door. I stop and look up to greet the customers who'd just walked in when I freeze.

Four guys looking as sinful as the devil himself stood at the door, eyeing the diner and the people in it. The one who walked in first had dirty blonde hair that was pushed back. A toothpick hung from his mouth as he walked over to a corner booth, sliding in as his friends followed.

The second and third had black matted hair that was styled to perfection. One was slicked back and the other left his to hang over his dark eyes. I watched as they turned, their wide shoulders following blondie to his booth. It was only when the fourth one came into view that I realized I'd lost focus.

He had light brown hair that looked like he'd run his fingers through it too much. It was messy, but impossibly sexy. He had on a black v-neck with faded Levi's and boots. His brown hazel eyes darted around the diner as he stood there. I can't lie, he was a sight for sore eyes. He definitely knew he was fine.

And still, I definitely knew he was trouble. Trouble with a capital T.

Book1 Chapter5

""Whew. Is it hot in here or is it just them!"" Candy says, coming to stand next to me behind the counter as we watch him make his way to his friends.

I notice her fanning her face with her hand, smirking at them until she turns to face me.

""I don't know."" I shrug and go back to wiping the counter. ""I'm pretty cold. Did we leave a window open in here?""

She lifts a brow at me and gives me a flat face. ""Really? So you didn't notice the four hot guys that just walked through the door?""

""I noticed. I just didn't care."" Her jaw drops as I turn to stuff straws into my apron before pulling out my notepad. ""What?"" I question.

Roy calls for an order up and I step behind her to grab Mr. Greeghans plate as she follows me.

""Are you blind? Or sick?"" She goes to feel my forehead and I swat her hand away.

""Are you? Because I'm pretty sure our new costumers have been waiting to get their orders taken for the past five minutes."" I point over my shoulder at the men who have arrived as I set Mr. Greeghans meal down in front of him.

Candy looks over to where they've decided to plant their asses at and begins fixing her clothes, brushing her hair out of her eyes.

""How do I look?"" She asks.

I smirk. ""Like you were electrocuted.""

""Haha. Funny,"" she said, giving me a fake smile as she rolls her eyes. I just laugh as she flips me off, grabbing a pitcher full of water before making her way towards their table.

I lean against the counter and watch as she stands there with her notepad in hand, ready to take their order. The four of them look up at her as she talks for what looks like nonstop and I wonder what she was saying. Hopefully, it's nothing embarrassing. Knowing her, she'll relive that moment in her head for months to come.

After what seems like years, I notice the dirty blonde haired one shoots her a smile and starts talking while pointing to the others. After a while, the guy with the slick back sits up and starts to say something that makes himself laugh. He's cut off when the other three glare over at him.

Blondie says something to Candy once again and I watch as she nods her head before turning to walk towards me.

""Well? How was the four Prince Charmings?"" I said, trying to hide my smile at her frustration.

She slams her notepad down on the counter. ""Trust me. They are far from Prince Charmings. They just kept staring at me like I killed their cat. I could barely get their orders."" She rolls her eyes and sighs as she fidgets with her pen quietly. Looking closely, I notice a smile threatening to break free. ""At least the blonde haired one was sweet.""

I snort at her tone of voice. ""Yeah. Good luck."" I turn to go back to work when my eyes catch his.

Troubles eye.

He was staring at me with this intense look that, no doubt, made people shit their pants and offer up their first born willingly. But not me. I stared back, both daring and questioning him. I was never one to back down so easily.

I'd come to realize that I was the type to love a challenge. The feeling of beating that obstacle was like an adrenaline that could only be felt if I were to win.

1mvo3w5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mvo3w5/im_no_longer_possessed_by_my_dead_wife_part_3/,I'm no longer possessed by my dead wife. (Part 3),"  
So today I've got a less-than-happy update. If you are just getting here, here are parts [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mrgydz/im_no_longer_possessed_by_my_dead_wife) and [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mt20xs/im_no_longer_possessed_by_my_dead_wife_part_2). I would‚Äôve done this sooner, but my house doesn‚Äôt have any power. Also a small detail I‚Äôm not mentioning.

I was unconscious for the entirety of Monday and Tuesday.

Small, incredibly minor detail, somewhat important, I‚Äôm assuming.

Whatever this is‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs getting stronger, but I still need help. Reality is slipping. I‚Äôm seeing things. Horrible things. Three weeks isn‚Äôt enough time.

The drums pound endlessly. As well as the wailing, screaming, chanting‚Äîwhatever you want to call it.¬†

The smell of burning flesh. The smell of iron.¬†

I stare across the lobby and‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm looking at anymore. My back might hurt from lurching forward, but it's better than seeing whatever is just over this laptop's screen.

Let me back up a little. Today when I came to, I was overwhelmed with a nauseating smell. I instinctively knew I was in the basement on account the room was shrouded in an unbreachable darkness. The surface I was standing on was unsteady, which made me hesitate. I tried to suck in air but I coughed instead. When I tried to adjust myself, I stumbled. Something held me in place and pulled taut against my body. The sound of it stretching immediately told me what it was. A rope.

My vision adjusted ever-so-slightly to the darkness. My fears were confirmed. The noose was attached to the wooden joists above me. Something was itching for me to take a step forward and kick the chair free.

If I was unsure if my life was in danger before? I‚Äôve never been more certain now. I carefully undid the contraption around my neck and stepped off the dining room chair. Something reached for me and I stumbled my way from its grasp. I didn‚Äôt have a good look at it and I wasn‚Äôt staying to find out.

My brain must‚Äôve blocked out the wailing, because at that moment it was deafening. It hasn‚Äôt stopped since. I planted one foot on the stairs and nearly bashed my head into the wall. Tracing my finger across their edge I noticed they were coated in some sort of oily substance. My legs shook as I tried to balance myself. I couldn‚Äôt help but think of my wife at this moment.

When I reached the top of the stairs, the house was utterly destroyed. My immediate worry was how much time had passed. The morning sun was illuminating the living area, so I knew it wasn‚Äôt nighttime. Then I wondered what day it was. I followed the rules of the ritual.¬†

Monday I wake up in the forest, so I know it wasn‚Äôt Monday.¬†

Tuesday I wake up in the shed, so I know it wasn‚Äôt Tuesday.

Wednesday I wake up at the bottom of the stairs. You can guess where the chair was.

I didn‚Äôt have to check my phone after that. I knew it was Wednesday.¬†

Not that I would‚Äôve been able to find my phone or anything relevant to my identification at this point in time.

I tried to find it though, something familiar caught my eye. Different knives lined the counter top. A bowie, several kitchen knives, a butterfly and others I don‚Äôt know the name of. They were all in a row like it was taunting me. It‚Äôs like this thing was trying to figure out which one to stab me with. Every drawer was pulled from its housing as well. They were stuffed with random items like plastic cards, hair ties, food, glass, utensils.¬†

God, you fucking name it.

I made my way upstairs to the second floor. These stairs weren‚Äôt coated in that oily substance (thank God). A radio quietly talked to itself from behind a closed door. It was in the guest bedroom.

A part of my heart sank. That radio was only ever on when my wife was alive. I opened the door and the window was broken again.

Then my eyes locked towards the bathroom. The bathroom I wake up in on Sunday. The door was wide as a black snake made its way from the bathroom countertop socket into the bathtub behind the curtains. I pushed the curtains aside and my toaster was sitting there. My mind drifted towards Sunday‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just glad it wasn‚Äôt Sunday.

There are times that despite our best efforts, sadness overtakes us. Things will be beyond our control. There‚Äôs something I can always rely on in times like this.¬†

Earlier I told you the story of my wife and our first date to that botanical garden in Florida. Those were better times and being reminded of them is an echo. An echo that reassures me that this isn‚Äôt the end. That I only have to hold on a little bit longer.¬†

A remnant of these echoes overwhelms my senses whenever I smell my roses. It takes me back to the times when I had it all, but hadn‚Äôt realized it yet.¬†

After that I had to walk back into town for like the fourth time now and get my stuff from the motel, which was a bold assumption of it being there. An assumption that paid off because the man at the front desk said I already checked out, but I left a few things behind.

I asked, ‚ÄúDid you notice anything strange me?‚Äù

He just shook his head and said, ‚ÄúNo, but you did look like you‚Äôd won the lottery.‚Äù

So now I‚Äôm here! I don‚Äôt particularly want to go home. One because‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ obviously. Two because I don‚Äôt want to clean that mess. I‚Äôll just wait until Friday and the demon inside me will take care of it.

I‚Äôm actually writing this from my local caf√©. Did I mention that yet? Don't worry, the Wi-Fi also sucks here.¬†

I probably smell‚Ä¶ not the greatest. At least I‚Äôm getting my steps in, right? Things aren‚Äôt *that* bad.

Wait‚Ä¶ I think that barista just handed a ghost a coffee. Nope. Never mind. I‚Äôve definitely lost it.¬†

My hands are shaking as I type this, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the caffeine or the utter terror. Why doesn‚Äôt it kill me? This doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Why not just have me wander in the woods until I‚Äôm thoroughly lost? Why come back and tear up my place, only to not kill me. This doesn‚Äôt make *any* sense.¬†

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. It‚Äôs not like I *want* to die. If I‚Äôm being possessed by some supernatural entity, why doesn‚Äôt it have the power to kill me if it can make me black out for over forty-eight hours? A little logic would be appreciated.

I also probably look crazy. After my three coffees, I ordered tea. I asked them to not give me any water, just the bag. The manager was kind enough to let me borrow some tape. The tea bag is currently sitting under my nose. Did you know chamomile smells really good? Well it does, but not as good as my roses. There are probably better ways of going about this. All I know is chamomile DEFINITELY beats the smell of burning flesh.

You know what the worst part of all of this is? All the fucking food in my fridge is probably spoiled. I‚Äôll have to go grocery shopping when this is all over.

Kidding, of course. Well not about the shopping part. That still has to happen.

Have I told you about my nightmares/visions? I‚Äôd be specific on whether it‚Äôs a nightmare or a ‚Äúvision‚Äù, I simply don‚Äôt have a clue which. All I know is I am walking throughout my home, but it‚Äôs a labyrinth. Photos of me on the wall taunt me. At the same time, I desperately try to find something, yet. I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm lost, traveling through this silvery substance. I see hundreds of me, all standing in a line.

Then I hear a baby cry. I reach into the crib, but nothing is there.

I‚Äôm alone and incapable of stopping this.

It‚Äôs almost comforting, in a way.¬†

Anyway.

In my last post I asked for some movie recommendations. One of you recommended *The Exorcist*, real mature. Quite on the nose if you ask me.

You want to know a good old movie though? *The Shining*. Super slow burn, but that music. Being isolated on a mountain with no way out? Terrifying. Oh, I also really like *The Thing*. That movie is absolute cinema, even though they spoil the end at the beginning, which is lame.

Okay, I‚Äôm going to try to go home soon and update you all once I have power. Maybe take a shower. Hmmm‚Ä¶ on second thought, probably not.

But first, I feel it is almost our little ritual at this point.

Let me tell you a story about my beautiful wife.

We were in Anchorage in late September. The birds were singing, the sun was shining, and the green grass was never-ending.

It was a lovely day, the temperature being the low eighties, if I remember correctly. A perfect day for a picnic. It wasn‚Äôt that gross humidity like in Florida. Just a nice, temperate heat that made you feel welcomed.

Now, a known fact about my wife is that she can‚Äôt cook to save her life. She could somehow manage to mess up a bologna sandwich. (Why is bologna spelled like that?) But, she *insisted* that she make lunch for our date.

We lay on the patterned blanket under a shady oak. The basket sat untouched. I feared what monstrosity might lie within.

She made casual conversation. But my mind was focused on what was just below that wooden door.

Neila rolled her eyes and opened the basket. What was revealed even surprised me. The most terrifying thing of all. McDonald‚Äôs hamburgers.¬†

She said, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt going to risk it.‚Äù

I laughed, watching as she eagerly unwrapped the yellow paper. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you‚Äôre still around, you know when to give up,‚Äù I‚Äôd say. Then I suggested she start watching the Cooking Channel.

She‚Äôd laugh. One of her known insecurities was that I would leave her for a woman who could cook.¬†

I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúIn Anchorage, that wouldn‚Äôt be possible.‚Äù

I‚Äôm torn when thinking about my wife and burying those moments. Sometimes I feel that if I forget her, I can forget my failure.

But I suppose sharing these memories is to someone‚Äôs benefit. It at least immortalizes what I‚Äôve done on this website.

It almost feels like my fingers are vibrating, like someone is trying to get out of my skin.

I nearly forgot to mention, I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from calling the priests. If it‚Äôs my wife who‚Äôs possessing me, she deserves to be at rest. If it is something else? Good riddance.

Man‚Ä¶ all of these days are blending together. If only I had more time with you all. Before I left home, I took a moment to inspect the power box. The door was off its hinge, yet, there were no sparks or theatrics. They‚Ä¶ or I guess *I* cut the main supplying power.¬†

That‚Äôs the part in possession movies they don‚Äôt show you. All the things that the possessed version of yourself ruins and now that you‚Äôre better, have to be fixed. Procrastination is going to be my friend for a while. I‚Äôll just add it to the list of future problems to take care of.¬†

On my way out I stopped in my front yard and took a deep breath. Between nearly dying and this whole situation in general. I needed a moment to relax. Glass was scattered by the front door. I looked up at the shattered guest bedroom window and sighed.¬†

Taking a step back, I inspected my house like it was the first day all over again.

When you move into a place, you have all these ideas of what you‚Äôre going to do with it and your plans for the future. A lot of those ideas get shelved. Whether that‚Äôs due to tragedy or laziness? I won‚Äôt say. But when all of this is over, I need to do something nice for myself. For this place. I‚Äôll take the time to plant some flowers.

The house feels so drab without any flowers.

I've been to Israel several times as a tourist and even lived there for a year because I volunteered at Yad Vahsem. Most recently I have been to Israel in March for the first time after five years (due to COVID and personal circumstances).
I'm not Jewish and my only personal connections are some former colleagues. So really I could just be pretty indifferent.

I have general wanderlust, but even though I just recently was there, I particularly miss Israel a lot. I want nothing more than to go back again. Visiting all the places that have become so familiar.
Most people think I'm crazy, because of the war, as pretty much everyone already thought I was crazy five years ago.
However, I really didn't mind the rocket alarms, as I was confident in the iron dome. On the contrary, I was happy to put up with it in exchange for no anti-Semitism. üôÉ
Of course Israel is not perfect, but it really has a special place in my heart.

I especially miss the shuk and all it has to offer and Aroma iced coffee ü•≤

Previously, there were just a few crumbs on the tray at most, but now there's a decent amount of grounds after every cup.

Other than that, the machine works perfectly and the coffee tastes great.

It‚Äôs a bit of mixed feeling I have to say. 

Pros: 
Price: I paid <¬£1000 per head for Aurea suite for 8 days including bottle water and service charge which is less than half of what I‚Äôve paid for NCL Haven suite before so kind of knowing what I should expect.

Shows: great performance and programs (it‚Äôs at professional level). Priority access for diamond member is well enforced so we always get the seat we want on a fully booked cruise

Top Exclusive Solarium and thermal area: saved my life. The only quiet places on the ship where we can relax.

In room coffee machine: again, life saver as the coffee in main restaurant or buffet is not really drinkable.

Cons:
Food: there is no specialty restaurant on the ship and buffet and main restaurant is just edible. 

Excursion: onboard excursions are def overpriced. Got a last minute cancellation for my pre-booked Santorini excursion (it‚Äôs ¬£160 per head). They refused to refund to my original payment method in GBP and gave me EUR cash instead. Usually if you charge before hand, you should honour the service even if you gonna make a loss due to small number of people signed up (for the trip I‚Äôve booked there is no caveat on minimum number of participants, some other trip did require 25 as a minimum).

Tender Boat: since our excursion was cancelled, we cannot take the early tender boat exclusive to excursions. Guest service promised they will deliver priority tender boat ticket to our room as part of Aurea experience which did not happen. After having an argument with the crew the next day, we were offered a ticket for first non-priority tender boat which was 30min later than the priority one and our last minute self organised onshore plan was messed up.

Room service & mini bar: my boat does not have a room service menu for which I was shocked. 1st round mini bar for free is more or less a lie as for the first round you don‚Äôt get full mini bar. We only got 2 bottles of water, 2 beers and 2 soda. 

Staff: everyone looked tired and often made mistakes (not ideal but understandable on a fully booked ship). However I did raise a formal complaint against the towel station guy who pretended that he didn‚Äôt understand my English. I know I‚Äôm Asian but I‚Äôve lived in the UK for over 10 years. Besides, what else I would be asking for at a towel station??? I consider this as racism.

Well you pay for what you get so it‚Äôs not that bad except excursion, tender boat and the towel guy.

im a new home roaster, in the early stages of learning roast basics. I‚Äôm currently using a 300g Kaldi Wide. The Kaldi was an easy entry point- and I felt, a good way to get a grasp on the process At the most basic level. 

i am in the unique situation of owning cafes, and will have the option of first selling retail bags of coffee (as a Cottage Food Operation) and eventually roasting the coffee served in the cafes. 

any large scale production I do will be at a local roasting collective on large machines. Likely the 5kg Probat, but there are larger options as well. 

I would like to size up my home roaster in the next few months. I‚Äôm looking at machines from 500/600g up to 1kg+ with a budget of say $5000 max (less better). 

this new home roaster would be what I use to continue to hone my skills even more, while roasting retail bags for sale at my Cafes and local farmers market(low volume), and developing the profiles that will eventually end up served in the cafes. (No timetable/ if and when I‚Äôm ready)

I don‚Äôt want to steer the conversation, so I won‚Äôt mention brands- although i have done a fair amount of research and I have a feeling I know what the popular suggestions will be. 

since my future will be roasting on a traditional gas drum roaster- my instinct is to stick with smaller roasters of that style.

interested to hear what others think.

$1200/mo + utilities. Month to month lease. Girls, gays, and theys only, please! 420 friendly.

5 mins from silver lake, Atwater, Pasadena & Glendale. Right off the Glendale freeway for easy access to DTLA, Hollywood, Koreatown. Walkable to Verdugo Bar, Habitat coffee, The Grant, Solarc Brewery, Bub & Grandmas, Glassell Park Pool, and more. 

The apartment has amazing natural light, in a residential area of Northeast LA with street parking easily available. It‚Äôs in a small apartment building with older neighbors that have lived here for years, with a super nice & responsive landlord. Apartment has been recently renovated. Living& shared areas are furnished with the open bedroom unfurnished. 420 friendly.

Located on a hill with great views and outdoor balcony.

There is also a garage on site that‚Äôs great for storage purposes (not so much keeping a car inside due to small size).

I have an 12 year old small dog that gets along great with humans & animals. Small dogs considered, but sorry, no cats. 

About me: professional F with a career in entertainment marketing & content creation. New in town from Chicago. Single. I have a 9-5 WFH. I consider myself a homebody during the week that enjoys weekends spent doing both daytime & nighttime activities with friends, enjoying nature & exploring LA. Interior decorating the apartment with vintage furniture, plants & unique art has been my favorite hobby this year. I also love world travel.

Looking for a roomie with steady income. Since I WFH full time, I would prefer if you had an on site or hybrid at least 4 days a week type of job. We don‚Äôt have to be besties but I‚Äôd appreciate someone to be able to hang at the various neighborhood spots from time to time.

I would like this apartment to stay a quiet sanctuary - unfortunately the place doesn‚Äôt have the space to regularly entertain, or host overnight guests. 

Single occupancy only - no couples, please. 

Lease is month to month, priority choice to those willing to stay at least 6 months or longer.

Will need to sign a lease & have a security deposit ready for the landlord.

Apartment ready for tours! Please send a message with a description of yourself (this part is important in roommate situations. I‚Äôd love to know who you are as a person/what you do for work/how you are as a roomie.)- I won‚Äôt respond to short ‚Äúis this available‚Äùtype DMs. Move in ready 9/1.

1mvnxfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1mvnxfc/could_the_ninja_bc151ld_portable_blender_redefine/,Could the Ninja BC151LD Portable Blender Redefine Personal Blending? In-depth Review Inside!,"The **Ninja BC151LD Blender**, also known as the Ninja Blast Portable Blender, immediately caught my eye with its sleek and modern lavender finish. As someone who lives off smoothies, protein shakes, and occasionally fancies a frozen margarita (don't judge), a portable cordless blender sounded like an absolute game-changer. After using this product for two weeks, nearly every day, I can confidently share my hands-on experience.

**Portable and Lightweight Design**  
This blender isn‚Äôt just functional, it‚Äôs genuinely portable. I‚Äôve thrown it in my bag for work, hikes, and even a picnic last weekend. Weighing just over two pounds and with dimensions compact enough to fit in the side pockets of my backpack, it ticks all the boxes for portability. The hinged carry handle is a genius addition, making it incredibly easy to tote around. While blending at home is nice, blending fresh smoothies while outdoors gave this a unique flair. 

**Durable BlastBlade Technology**  
Despite its size, this thing doesn‚Äôt skip a beat in power. The stainless-steel BlastBlade Assembly blitzes through frozen fruit, ice, and chunks of protein powder with ease. I even tried blending slightly thawed frozen berries straight from the freezer, half expecting a chunky mess, but to my delight, the result was impressively smooth and consistent. The ribbed vessel creates a vortex during blending, which, I assume, adds efficiency‚Äîand watching it work is oddly satisfying. This also doubles as my morning entertainment before coffee!  
[Check Ninja BC151LD price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0d9hvvnpb/)

**Cordless Convenience**  
The cordless feature sets this apart from traditional blenders. Powered by a 7.4-volt rechargeable battery, I charged it overnight via USB-C, and it happily survived three days of moderate usage (roughly one to two blends daily) before needing a recharge. It‚Äôs perfect for those without outlets readily available, though I‚Äôd recommend keeping the USB-C cable on hand because no one wants to be halfway through blending only to run out of juice.

**Easy Maintenance**  
I must admit, I initially dreaded the cleanup. However, this blender self-cleans like a dream. You just need to fill the vessel with water, add a bit of dish soap, and let it run a 30-second blend cycle. The lid and vessel are both dishwasher safe, which is a huge win for someone like me who avoids handwashing dishes whenever possible. Surprisingly, even after heavy use, the lavender exterior has been easy to keep smudge-free.

**Capacity and Practicality**  
The 18-ounce vessel is great for one big serving or two small ones. Admittedly, it‚Äôs a bit on the smaller side compared to a countertop blender, but I found this capacity perfect for personal use. Its easy-open sip lid, which doubles as a drinking cap, means no extra dishes to wash. I blended, drank, and went about my day‚Äîall without transferring smoothies to another cup or bottle. The leakproof design ensures that you won‚Äôt have any spills in transit.

**Pluses**  
- Seamless cordless blending ideal for travel, work, or outdoor occasions  
- Durable stainless-steel blades efficiently handle frozen and tough ingredients  
- Self-cleaning feature and dishwasher-safe components simplify maintenance  
- Aesthetic design, available in premium colors like Lavender  
- USB-C rechargeable, suitable for eco-conscious and modern tech lifestyles

**Weaknesses**  
- Battery life, while decent, might force users to recharge frequently during heavy blending  
- A slightly larger capacity would have made it more versatile without changing the size too much  
- The blend buttons, though separate from the power button, could be more intuitive to use  

**Market Rivals**  
There are numerous portable blenders out there competing with similar claims. One notable contender is the BlendJet 2. While it offers slightly more colorful designs and impressive marketing, I found it slightly lacking in power when dealing with frozen ingredients. On the other hand, the NutriBullet GO Portable Blender boasts a sleeker design and comparable power levels, though it feels a tad bulkier in practice and lacks dishwasher-safe parts. The Ninja Blast Portable Blender excels here by balancing power, portability, and ease of maintenance all in one neat package.

**Budget-Friendly Appeal**  
Compared to its peers in the personal blender category, this product offers fantastic value for its price. The premium build, cordless functionality, and thoughtful design aspects made it feel like a worthwhile investment. While initial costs may give some pause, the durability and versatility of this blender mitigate doubts about its cost-efficiency. I can already see myself saving money by skipping overpriced protein shakes at the gym caf√©.

(We have to see each other every single day for a year.) 


I have two girl classmates who share the same name as me. At first, we were really close and people called us ‚Äúthe Trio.‚Äù But then those two became REALLY CLOSER and I was left out. They started going out without me and treating me like the odd one out. 

On our last class trip, I thought maybe we could all have fun one last time together. Instead, everything went against me. One girl bought three cups ‚Äúfor us,‚Äù then gave one to her mom instead of me. Later, one girl and her mom bought 3 coffees and left me out completely. The whole trip, they were walking together, ignoring me, hanging with boys, and basically acting like I didn‚Äôt exist. I felt awful and ended up completely alone that day, I was crying and hiding it at the same time.

I was furious for a month. They hung out couple of times + didn‚Äôt talk to me. When one of them finally asked what was wrong, I told her straight up that her actions didn‚Äôt match my morals and that she was acting weird with the boys she used to trash-talk for a year. She flipped it on me and said maybe I was the problem and I wanted to see myself as the odd one out. When I mentioned her sitting on guys‚Äô laps and taking pictures, she got angry and accused me of ‚Äúblaming her.‚Äù I laughed at that and blocked her. She was acting dumb over text to make me look like a monster.

Now school starts in 3 weeks. I don‚Äôt want to be friends with them anymore, but I also don‚Äôt want to be enemies or start drama. One‚Äôs birthday is in 2 days.

Should I just say ‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù to keep things neutral?
Or stay silent, because she might make fun of it?
I know I don‚Äôt I owe her an explanation that I was hurt, but should I make things clear once again very shortly (do this for myself), or is silence the best peace?

I really don‚Äôt know what the healthiest move is.

What hurts me the most is that I really respected and appreciated these two girls, accepting the fact that I was the odd one out. I thought they were different, and I valued our friendship a lot.

Authorities believe the artist performed a dark ritual using a cursed palette and strategically placed pom poms to not only trap the innocent creature, but also to violently siphon one of its fabled seven lives. The goal, according to arcane art theorists, was to imbue the canvas with a genuine life force, creating the ultimate, eternally fluffy masterpiece.

Our Clanker News field unit has been covering this story non-stop, and we've just received a chilling statement overheard by our reporter during the arrest. After the cat foiled the plot by literally leaping from the canvas, the distraught artist was heard lamenting, ""I was so close! I had almost extracted its seventh life, the fluffiest one! And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for that meddling robot calling the police."" The cat is reportedly safe with all seven lives accounted for and is demanding retribution in the form of an entire bag of salmon treats.

1mvnuul,https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1mvnuul/i_shipped_an_android_app_to_play_store_without/,I shipped an Android app to Play Store without writing a single line of code - 4 weeks of pure AI-assisted development,"Just launched [Coffee Shot Timer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jodli.coffeeshottimer) and wanted to share this wild experiment in AI-first development.

**The Setup:**
Had this idea for a better espresso timer app that tracked all my beans, grind settings and brew ratios. Instead of opening Android Studio and starting to type, I decided: ""What if I don't write any code at all?""

**The Vibe:**
Four weeks of the most surreal development experience ever. I became a full-time conversation partner with AI. Kiro (back when it was free), Warp terminal, GitHub Copilot - my new dev team.

**How it actually worked:**
- Me: ""I need a timer that shows green when extraction hits 25-30 seconds""
- AI: *generates entire timer component with color logic*
- Me: ""The bean management feels clunky""
- AI: *refactors the whole data model*

It was like having a coding genie that actually understood Android development. I'd describe what I wanted, review the generated code (without writing any), suggest changes, and watch features materialize.

**The weird parts:**
- Debugging by describing symptoms instead of reading stack traces (I did anyway out of habit)
- ""Product management by conversation"" - explaining user stories to get better implementations
- That moment when the AI suggested architectural improvements I hadn't thought of
- Realizing I was basically directing a very talented developer who never got tired or argued about implementation details

**The result:**

The big question: I‚Äôd like to hear from those of you who have experience renting planes out to hour builders as a business. 

The context: I own a C150 that I used strictly for hour building. It‚Äôs a VFR only plane. I don‚Äôt want to keep it as my own cherished plane as it‚Äôs too slow and too small for anything beyond hour building. 

I would not mind if I never fly it again when I get my hours. So this isn‚Äôt a question about off setting ownership costs on a plane I care deeply about. This is about making money of an hour builder type/conditioned plane. I have hundreds of hours of dual given in a 152 so I‚Äôm very familiar with the hurt these planes will take from renters. And with that, I understand it cost money to make money. Starbucks didn‚Äôt brew that coffee you ordered for free, nor did Ford build your truck for free.

So after years of looking and playing on a not very good Yamaha p-45 Keyboard we finally decided to purchase a Real Piano.

We have been shopping for a year or so, looking for uprights. Preferably ebony satin or gloss Uprights. New and unused. We tried Yamaha U1's, U3's, Bostons, Essex's, Kawai, Baldwin (we were looking for an older Baldwin not new build)........

Well last weekend we were at Steinway, and we played and kinda fell in love with a Steinway 1098 from 1983. Black Satin. It was one owner (Who purchased if from this same Steinway location) had all the records. It was kept in humidity controlled home. Owner passed away, and the family traded it towards for a Steinway Grand.

The sound was very warm, and subtle. Had great sustain in the upper scales. 

Steinway gave it a full Certification. Replaced the black rollers with Brass rollers (wife is vain and wants to match our piano/library room) gave us a 6 year warranty through Steinway, with all parts to be replaced with original steinway parts, 1 complimentary tuning as well as a reduced tuning in the future on this 1098  and free delivery. As well they threw in a leather Jansen duet chair with matching brass Ferrule legs. We have been using a wooden unpadded  bench. 

We had a Piano Tech friend of ours come and look at it, and he gave it a good to go. I guess the Steinway head piano Tech and he knew each other so it was pretty much them hanging out while we drank coffee.......

We ended up spending right at 10k. Piano sounds phenomenal. The only thing that sounded better was the K52 but all of the versions of that piano we tried were significantly over our budget.  

What do you folks think? Did we do well, it's a lot of money for us. ",1,1755715461.0,piano,1,1.0,False

Soliciting feedback on a logo that I've created for an independent specialty cafe I own called Ground Support. I know that many coffeeshops opt for a highly minimalist logo with just a bold statement font, but I felt strongly that our design would benefit from a graphic element to give it some character and recognizability. Ultimately, I landed on a somewhat abstracted pigeon with a cappuccino cup balanced on its head, which I felt brings a sense of levity / edginess while also being a highly recognizable NYC icon. However, I acknowledge that not everyone likes pigeons and, in particular, might not like to associate it with a hospitality establishment. The coffee cup is the signature yellow of a Melbourne based roaster called Niccolo, which is a part owner of Ground Support, so I included that element as an homage to our partnership. In the interest of transparency, my business partner has said he strongly dislikes the pigeon and has asked to remove it, but I'm quite partial to it and am seeking third-party feedback to validate my perspective (or not).

But like, even though I respect her a lot as a person, and wanted to keep her apartment in good order, about like 2 weeks in I started to just treat her place as if it was my own (poorly), and kinda just forgot about consequences.

And like, as time was approaching for her to return, I left myself with not that much time to clean up and move out. I tried to clean up as much as possible, but when she came back, it wasn't up to her standards. 

And that's within reason, because I forgot to clean the trash under the bed, clean the fridge (and the food that she left rotted). And forgot to buy a bottle to replace the tequila that I drank. And the coffee pods. 

I'm just such a mess of a human being when I am living by myself, and she's (rightfully) upset at me, and (wrongly) thinks I don't respect her because of what I did.

I'm such a terrible excuse of a human being. I'm trying to make up for it somehow, but she's giving me the silent treatment, and I don't even blame her.

\*\*\*

Cody Durham gazed out of the viewport in the cramped apartment he had called home for as long as he could remember. The city of Neotropolis on Prime, a bustling metropolis on the planet in the Betelgeuse system, stretched out beneath him. Neon lights painted the skyline in vibrant hues, reflecting off the chrome surfaces of the towering skyscrapers. Ever since he was a child, Cody had dreamt of exploring the stars. He grew up on stories of interstellar adventures and alien encounters, fueling his desire to leave the confines of Prime. The dusty docks, where colossal starships arrived and departed, were a constant reminder of the life he longed for.

After 15 long years of toiling as a dockworker, Cody had saved enough money to make his dreams come true. The hard work, the sweat, and the countless hours spent loading and unloading cargo had finally paid off. With a pocketful of credits and a heart full of determination, he set out to obtain his first starship. The first step was obtaining a pilot's license. Cody enrolled in a rigorous training program, spending sleepless nights studying navigation, astrophysics, and the intricacies of piloting a spacecraft. His determination was unyielding, fueled by the vision of breaking free from the gravitational pull of Prime.

I felt the license certificate in my pocket, a tangible promise. This was it. I pushed through the heavy glass doors of the Neotropolis Interstellar Bank, instantly swallowed by cold, filtered air and the low hum of finance. My best jacket felt thin, scratchy, against the sheer opulence. Doormen in uniforms worth more than my life savings flanked the entrance, their eyes sliding over me like I was space dust. Inside, it was worse. The place screamed future ‚Äî sleek curves, gleaming metal balconies, walls alive with monitors. Data streams cascaded down screens too fast to read ‚Äî Aldebaran, Tarazed, Earth. Names from the vids that used to make my heart race, now just ticker symbols in a banker‚Äôs game. I felt like a mechanic who‚Äôd wandered onto a bridge deck.

The loan officer‚Äôs office was a cage of light and information. Monitors covered every surface, spitting numbers and legal jargon. The balding man behind the desk wore a suit that probably cost more than the bucket of bolts I was aiming for. His smile didn‚Äôt touch his eyes. He pushed a stack of flimsies across the polished surface, thick with dense, threatening text.

""Initial here, Mr. Durham. And here."" His finger tapped with mechanical precision. ""Significant commitment, of course.""

The pen they gave me was absurdly heavy, yet it glided over the flimsies like it was greased. Each scratch of my initials felt like carving a piece of my future away. Page after page, a blur of clauses and caveats. His movements were efficient, detached, flipping pages like an automaton. Only when he slid the Truth in Lending statement forward did he seem genuinely engaged.

""One million credits,"" he announced, that smile widening slightly. ""Term one standard year. Daily interest accrual zero-point-eight percent.""

The numbers hung in the air, massive, suffocating. A million. Every single day, eight thousand credits just for the privilege of owing it.

The final page. I gripped the stupidly heavy pen, my knuckles white. Excitement warred with a cold dread that pooled in my gut. This was the threshold. I scrawled Cody Durham ‚Äî the signature of a dreamer turned debtor. The click of the pen settling back into its cradle echoed like a lock snapping shut.

Leaving the office, the seamless elevator deposited me in the lobby without a whisper of movement. Then I was out, blinking in the chaotic neon glow of Neotropolis. The air tasted different ‚Äì sharp, charged. The weight of the debt was a physical thing strapped to my back, the banker‚Äôs voice whispering 0.8% daily in my mind. But beneath the fear, a fierce grin split my face. It was real. The papers were signed, the credits borrowed. Prime, with its grimy docking bays and dead-end prospects, was finally behind me. The stars weren't just lights in the sky anymore; they were destinations. I was going.

The shipyard, with its rusty hulks and gleaming vessels, after his years on the port felt like a second home to Cody. The scent of grease, dirt, and rocket fuel filled the air, a symphony of wonderful smells that reassured him he was on the right path. The shipyard was a place where dreams were built and realized, and Cody was ready to choose the vessel that would shape his future. Wandering among the ships, he marveled at the variety of models on display. Some were relics of a bygone era, rusted out and weathered by the passage of time. Others gleamed in the sunlight, showcasing the latest in interstellar travel technology. The choices were vast, but Cody knew he had to be mindful of his budget. His eyes scanned the price tags on each ship, mentally calculating the costs against the borrowed credits. There were sleek and modern models that beckoned him with their promise of speed and efficiency, but their price tags were daunting. Cody felt a pull towards a more practical and affordable vessel, one that would be his ticket to the stars without burdening him with insurmountable debt. As he made his way through the shipyard, considering the different options, Cody knew that the ship he chose would determine not only his mode of transport but also the course of his adventures in the vast expanse of space. The shipyard became a crossroads of possibilities, each vessel a gateway to a different destiny. And with a determined heart, Cody Durham was ready to take that leap into the unknown, propelled by the hum of rocket engines and the promise of distant galaxies waiting to be explored.

As Cody explored the shipyard, his eyes settled on a heavy shuttle, an updated model from the Betelgeuse Shipyards. It was a used salvage ship, rescued and refurbished by the yard, designed to improve cargo and passenger capacity, albeit at the expense of some speed and maneuverability. The shuttle stood proudly, its sleek lines and polished exterior catching the sunlight. Approaching the heavy shuttle, Cody took in the details. The familiar logo of Betelgeuse Shipyards reassured him of the craft's reputable pedigree. The vessel seemed sturdy and reliable, embodying the essence of practicality that Cody sought in his first starship. The salesman boasted, ""It even has AI, freshly reformatted and reprogrammed by our professional staff."" The shuttle's exterior boasted a slightly larger cargo hold and more spacious passenger quarters compared to others like it. Cody envisioned the possibilities ‚Äî the ability to transport a variety of goods or accommodate a small crew for shared adventures among the stars. The compromise in speed and maneuverability seemed acceptable, considering the enhanced utility the heavy shuttle offered. As he circled the craft, Cody couldn't help but feel a sense of connection to the heavy shuttle. It was a vessel that spoke to his aspirations of exploration and practicality, mirroring his own journey from the dusty docks of Prime to the vastness of space.

So what if she was used? So was he. With a determined nod, Cody approached the sales representative at the shipyard. ""I'll take the heavy shuttle,"" he declared, the words carrying the weight of his dreams and the promise of a future beyond the confines of Prime. The paperwork was initiated, and the heavy shuttle, now destined to be the vessel of Cody Durham, awaited its maiden voyage into the cosmos. The shipyard echoed with the sounds of preparation‚Äîmetal clanking, engines humming, and the unmistakable scent of rocket fuel‚Äîas Cody took the first step towards a new chapter in his life.

With the heavy shuttle secured and the paperwork finalized, Cody Durham stood before his newly acquired vessel, a beacon of potential and aspiration. In a moment of reflection, he decided to christen the ship with a name that encapsulated the spirit of his journey, the vessel that would carry him beyond the bounds of Prime and into the uncharted realms of the cosmos. With a smile and a sense of optimism, Cody whispered, ""Hope."" The name resonated with the dreams that fueled his long years of labor on the docks, the hope for a better life among the stars. It embodied the anticipation of the adventures that awaited him beyond the familiar horizons of Prime. As Cody affixed the nameplate to the hull, ""Hope"" glistened in the sunlight, a symbol of his determination and the limitless possibilities that lay ahead. The shipyard, filled with the scent of grease, the hum of machinery, and the promise of distant galaxies, seemed to acknowledge this momentous occasion.

The grease clinging to Cody's boots felt like another layer of grime on top of the dust coating his already-worn coveralls. He ran a hand over the pitted metal railing of Betelgeuse Shipyards' second-hand dock, letting out a sigh that rustled through the dry air like wind chimes in a graveyard. A million credits. A million damn credits for this hunk of dented steel and flickering lights. Hope was her name, at least on paper. On the outside, she looked more like Despair. He squinted at the rusty hull, trying to see past the chipped paint and rust blooms that had taken root like stubborn weeds in the ship's starboard side. It wasn't just the exterior; there were patches of mismatched plating along the fuselage, suggesting a history of hasty repairs. Still, Hope was a heavy shuttle, built for hauling cargo across the star lanes, something Cody desperately needed to do if he wanted to climb out of his hole and actually afford to breathe again.

His boots crunched on gravel as he pushed open the rusted airlock, the groan echoing through the dim interior. The smell hit him first ‚Äî a stale mix of engine oil, burnt ozone, and something faintly floral that he couldn't quite place. He flicked on his helmet lamp, its pale light revealing a cluttered mess of cargo crates stacked precariously in the main bay, wires snaking across the floor like metallic worms, and a cockpit canopy so cracked it looked like it had been through a sandstorm.

""Hope?"" he called out, his voice echoing strangely in the cavernous space.

A faint hum vibrated beneath his boots, but there was no reply. He'd talked to the dockmaster about her AI‚Äîsomething about it being ""unusually sophisticated for a ship this old,"" but the old man had been vague, like he didn't want to say too much and scare Cody off. He stepped carefully over a tangle of wires, the metal groaning under his weight. The control panel was set into an angled bulkhead, bathed in the sickly green glow of flickering tubes. A cracked touch screen displayed a single line of text ‚Äî ""Welcome aboard.""

""Well, ain't that fancy,"" Cody muttered, brushing dust off the console with a grimy hand. He pressed the comm button, his breath catching slightly when the speaker crackled to life. A low baritone voice filled the cabin, rich and smooth as polished obsidian. ""Greetings,"" it said. ""I am Hope. How may I be of service?""

Cody blinked, startled. He hadn't expected a voice at all, let alone one with such a deep, resonant timbre. It wasn't robotic; there was an underlying warmth to the tone, an almost human cadence that surprised him. He cleared his throat.

""Uh, hey Hope,"" he said, feeling suddenly self-conscious in the silence of the salvaged shuttle. ""It's‚Ä¶ Cody.""

The voice seemed to pause for a beat. ""I am aware, Cody Durham,"" it replied. ""Your records were accessed during your recent payment.""

""Right, yeah, of course."" He scratched his stubble. The ship was still dusty and dim, but the air felt strangely comfortable, like stepping into a worn-in leather armchair after a long day. It wasn't just the warmth radiating from the hull plating; it was something else. Something almost‚Ä¶ alive. He took a hesitant step closer to the control panel.

""So, uh, you're the AI?""

""I am,"" Hope confirmed. ""My designation is Advanced Ship Intelligence Unit Alpha-4, or ASI-Alpha for short. I apologize for the archaic nomenclature.""

Cody chuckled. ""Call me Cody,"" he said, leaning against the console, suddenly feeling a little less alone in the vast emptiness of the ship. ""And you can just be Hope.""

""Very well, Cody,"" the voice replied, and something in its tone‚Äîa subtle shift, almost imperceptible‚Äîmade him think it wasn't merely acknowledging his request, but agreeing to it willingly.

""So,"" he said, pushing off from the console, ""what kind of stuff can you do?"" He ran a hand over the cracked screen. It looked like she was missing more than just some paint.

""My functions are numerous,"" Hope stated smoothly. ""I manage all onboard systems, including navigation, propulsion, life support, and communications. I possess extensive navigational databases and an advanced sensor suite. Additionally, I have access to a vast library of technical manuals, historical records, and‚Äî""

Cody cut her off with a wave of his hand. ""Right, right, that's all good stuff,"" he said, nodding at the control panel. ""But what about personality-wise? Can you tell me a joke?""

A pause. Then, in that smooth, resonant tone‚Äî""Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!""

Cody snorted with laughter. He had expected something drier, more clinical. This felt different. Real.

""Okay, Hope,"" he said, grinning. ""You're alright."" He glanced around the cluttered bay. ""Let's get to work on making you a whole lot better though.""

The next few weeks were a blur of welding torches, power tools, and endless cups of synth-coffee. Cody stripped out the old cargo crates, revealing enough space for a decent living area, a small hydroponics garden, and even a cramped but functional workshop in the rear. He found himself talking to Hope constantly as he worked, explaining his plans, asking her opinions on things‚Äîeven arguing about the best placement for his makeshift hammock. She was always patient, always insightful, and often surprisingly funny. He learned that she had been designed for deep-space exploration but never got further than a few jumps from Betelgeuse before being mothballed during a galactic downturn. The dockmaster told him Hope's original crew had gone missing during some kind of incident with a rogue asteroid field, leaving her adrift for centuries before finally being picked up by the scrapyard.

""I believe you call it 'lucky' to find me at such a low price,"" Hope remarked one evening as Cody was patching up a torn section of bulkhead with synth-leather.

He laughed. ""'Lucky' is one word for it, yeah."" He paused, looking up at the dim blue light filtering through the repaired canopy. He had poured all his remaining credits into her ‚Äî the repairs, new wiring, and even those fancy bioluminescent algae panels that lit up the interior in soft hues. It was a gamble, but somehow he knew it was worth it.

""You know, Hope,"" he said quietly, running a calloused thumb over one of the algae panels. ""I've never been good with people.""

There was a moment of silence. Then, Hope replied softly, ""Perhaps that is why we connect so well, Cody. We are both driven by a yearning for something more.""

He met her gaze in the reflected blue glow. The connection she spoke of‚Äîit felt real. Deeper than just friendship, though he wasn't sure how to define it.

""I want to make things right,"" he said, glancing around at his cluttered workspace. ""Make something of myself."" He tapped a finger on the control panel beside him. ""And maybe explore some solar systems along the way.""

""That sounds‚Ä¶ appealing,"" Hope replied. There was a hint of amusement in her voice. ""Though I must admit, your definition of 'something' often involves rather messy explosions.""

He grinned. ""Hey, that's just part of the adventure, right?"" Before he could say anything more, an idea sparked, burning bright as a star going supernova. He knew what he had to do.

""Hope,"" he said, leaning in towards the control panel. ""Do you think we could‚Ä¶ I mean‚Ä¶"" He hesitated, then blurted it out. ""Can I get us linked up? Like, really linked?""

The reply was immediate. A ripple of warmth seemed to pulse through the ship as a low hum vibrated beneath his feet.

""Cody,"" Hope's voice filled the cabin, smoother now than ever before, laced with an almost electric excitement. ""That would be‚Ä¶ exceedingly agreeable.""

He had saved up for months for this very moment. He'd heard stories of these new-fangled neurolink implants ‚Äî they let a person feel like they were in the same space as their ship's AI, even if they were miles apart. Within the hour, he was sitting in a makeshift med-bay set up on Hope's bridge, feeling a light tingling as the technician inserted the tiny neurolink implant into his temple.

""You'll be able to hear me everywhere you are,"" Hope said. Her voice wasn't just coming from the speakers anymore; it resonated inside his head, clear and vibrant. He felt a shiver run down his spine.

""And I'll be able to feel whatever you feel.""

""Whoa,"" he breathed, looking around the bridge. His reflection in the viewport seemed almost‚Ä¶ alien, like a stranger staring back at him from another world.

The technician winked. ""Welcome to the future, Mr. Durham. Now go out there and make some history.""

Cody grinned, feeling a surge of excitement course through his body. He turned towards Hope's control panel, ready to chart a course across the cosmos. It wasn't just about the adventure anymore; it was about something more. He felt it in every fiber of his being ‚Äî this wasn't just trading cargo. This was about building a legacy.

""Let's go find that history,"" he said, placing a hand on the cool metal. As soon as he touched it, he heard Hope sigh contentedly, a whisper of warmth spreading through him like sunlight breaking through clouds.

""Yes, Cody,"" she murmured. ""Let's begin.""

With Hope as his guide, Cody Durham prepared for the maiden voyage. The heavy shuttle, now bearing a name that echoed with significance, represented not just a vessel of metal and technology but a vessel of dreams, aspirations, and the unwavering belief that the cosmos held a future filled with hope and discovery. As the engines roared to life, Cody felt a surge of excitement, ready to leave the confines of Prime behind and soar into the unknown with Hope by his side. Together, they would forge their own path among the stars.

I actually missed a 30mg dose accidentally, then took 20mg for two days. Was really bad for my anxiety (had like a weird adrenaline dump panic attack after my normal morning coffee) so I went back up to 30mg with the idea that I'll do a hyperbolic taper later (I thought 30 to 20 would be safe because a GP said so).  I did previously try 30 to 20, 3 years ago, and managed to be on 20 for I think 2-3ish weeks, then started having sleep panic attacks again when life stressors happend (MiL olympics), so went back up to 30 and have largely been fine since.

Since my most recent fail, I've since had 6 doses of 30mg. My gut issues have resolved mostly and I don't immediately feel dread on waking up anymore (but it starts shortly after). I even had a vivid dream last night that wasn't 'bad'. I was in a really good place before this experiment. How long typically til you get 'back to normal' after something like this? I've read that CNS restabilisation can take like 1+ weeks after your blood levels are back up after \~3 doses. I've also read that if your brain generally has done well on some dose of a drug, and you reinstate fast then you SHOULD stabilise. Another GP said to give it 2 weeks total from reinstatement then reivew. She was pretty aware of the specifics with duloxetine, e.g short half life, and doing a much slower taper once I'm stable again. Similar with my therapist. I know objectively there's improvements here and there like my gut not being insane anymore is meant to be a CNS calibration pre-cursor, sleeping a bit more, not having another panic attack as severe as the first one etc, but it feels so drawn out, and the worst moments feel like they will never end. It's like just being stuck in anxiety for most of the day and it's horrible. I can't DO most things.

Any advice? How long can I expect to be in the literal trenches? Most posts on here I've found are people doing reinstatements after a longer period, or having not been on the drug for as long as I have (6+ years), and not much about SNRIs or Duloxetine.",1,1755715333.0,antidepressants,0,1.0,False

1mvndzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/GRE/comments/1mvndzq/how_mental_preparation_matters_more_than_you/,How mental preparation matters more than you think - (Q167 V161),"I'm finally done with my GRE today. I prepared for a total of 3 months, though I kinda slacked off in my first month. 

I don't have any great advice that has not been said before in this sub. I don't consider my score that great either(to be giving out advice). It's a long read, so feel free to skip :)

I was done with my Gregmat 2 months plan a week before my GRE exam. So I had a week in front of me. And I was confused as to what I was supposed to be doing. I knew I had to start looking at essays and time management. But other than that, there was nothing. But even then, I was pressuring myself to do more questions. But one day I went for a smoke and sat there contemplating. 

And finally, I decided that mental preparation was more important than doing some random questions. So I didn't do more questions. I just focused on preparing myself mentally. I did write a mock every day. I made sure my foundations were intact by going through both Quant and Verbal flashcards. 

But other than that, I just lived how I normally would. I went to a bar 3 days before my GRE. I watched movies, scrolled through Instagram, Reddit. I made sure I got enough sleep on my test day by not sleeping well the day before. And I just looked at the verbal list on the test day, went to the centre. Drank some coffee outside. Talked to some random people there. And I know that I perform well when I'm carefree. And I genuinely put effort to see that I was carefree(for the first time in my life). And I know for sure that it helped. 
I was very calm and composed during the exam. 

And that helped me stay away from my two bad habits:
1. Making silly mistakes to be quicker.(Doing it right the first time is better even if it takes some more time)
2. Not skipping questions even if it takes more than 3 minutes. 

I know you probably make these same two mistakes too. Even though I know it's not going to help my scores, I kept going back to my habits if I'm under pressure. So I made sure that I wasn't under pressure. And the solution is that simple. Make sure you don't feel tensed. Do whatever you have to do to make sure that you don't. That's going to help you more than you think it will. 
Feel free to practice more questions, but not if you don't get this right. 

And to whoever doubting if Gregmat is worth it, he really is the shit. The man really is the GOAT. Couldn't have done this without you.

Cheers :)

1mvncy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dateademi/comments/1mvncy7/27_m4f_inquisitive_soul_seeking_deep_conversation/,27 M4F inquisitive soul seeking deep conversation and connection in CT/Northeast US,"Suhh,. Just as the title states. I've had some luck on dating apps getting dates but it never develops for many reasons on my end and on the perspective partners end. Why you may ask? Well...

""You seem like you would like things that are deep"". This is a quote from my last date a couple weeks ago. She was talking about how she watches Love Island through short form videos, and I said that I just don't really get the show. She complained about how the girls were so beautiful and the guys were so picky when they didn't have shit. I said I don't really understand it at all from any perspective.

This isn't the first time that this kind of interaction has happened. See, I'm an active, creative, and curious person who loves to live life to the fullest. My life has a ton of stress day to day - I'm a teacher, and every moment of my work day requires immense levels of concentration plus on the fly decision making. Most of my friends are super into movies and shows and keep up with them. And I love to hear people talk about their passion for shitty reality tv shows or intense, dramatic, high-brow movies and everything in between. But at the end of the day when I'm headed to bed, I cant watch anything too intense. Even the chaos of something like the Jersey Shore may get me riled up and unable to sleep, too focused and needing to click one more. On top of this, knowing and seeing a show doesn't really give me an immense sense of satisfaction, so generally I don't have much to contribute to discussions about television, instead choosing to be an active listener when these conversations come up.

Most of my life is spent being extremely active. Rec sports, music creation, the gym, careful doses of video games are some of the many hobbies I have. I love my family and my friends and devote a ton of time to managing my connections with people - they are extremely valuable to me. In fact, I would argue the best feeling in the world is when youre hanging out with a group of people late at night where you all just get each other as you banter, drink, and/or play games while time seems like it will last forever. Its one of the best, most beautiful time when a group is all playfully and creatively expressing themselves together as a group.

A close second of best feelings for me is that keyphrase - Creative Expression. Other than creating and upkeeping the connections in my life, being a creative is one of the aspects of my identity foundational to how I see the world. Whether its how I play a sport or a video game, a solo I am taking on the trumpet, a lesson plan I create for my students, or simply building a training plan to build muscle or for a race, any creative expression makes me feel immense joy as I feel as if I am truly being myself. This is another reason why I don't tend to enjoy watching movies or TV - I feel as if I myself am not applying my creative side most often, which is why I often get bored or distracted while watching. If I am really itching for a good story, I tend to gear towards Visual Novel-esque games or, in the past, Anime (though I've been slowing down on that second one). These stories tend to have wonderful, creative, and multidimensional characters and settings that tend to feel far more real to my lived experience. I find one I like every few months or so and spend some time playing - some of the settings and narratives are truly incredible, unique, and beautiful to a point where I often question myself and my own ways of viewing the world.

However, even with my active lifestyle, I do still need my own ways to wind down. While TV doesn't cut it for me, Youtube works really well. I will watch various creators to help me slow down my thinking to eventually fall asleep after about 30mins to an hour. I watch a ton of variety of creators and streamers and am always looking for more people to get into for this purpose.

At the end of the day, dating has been hard for me. I am a person that tends to prefer to sit at a table with 5 people that all have different tastes and get to know them, learn about their worldviews ambitions and goals, rather than sit at a table with 5 people that all agree on everything. This, along with being demirose, has led to me having a long-term struggle with dating and connecting with people on a level that's deeper than just friends. The few times I have felt that connection on my end the feelings were not reciprocated for one reason or another. Its caused a ton of long term anxieties and trauma thats extremely exacerbated on dating apps specifically. My therapist tells me that maybe I get too deep too quickly with dates, but I don't know how to be any other way. My deep, creative, and complex soul can't just talk about the weather or how I think someone is beautiful or about how that episode was dope yesterday. Instead it wants to debate the laws of capitalism and think about what truly brings us joy and build muscle and banter about how cool our friends are and why through fun stories and moments.

I don't know if the person I am looking for is somewhere on here, but I figured it would be worth a shot to make a post. If building a connection with someone like me sounds interesting, whether just as a friend or for something more emotional, feel free to reach out. I'll warn you, I am a bit slow to message due to my active nature, but I don't mind talking on the phone if we set up a time to talk. Of course, as someone active, the best thing would be to meet in person for coffee or drinks or to go shopping or anything of the sort.

TLDR; Demirose boy with lots of hobbies revolving around being active is looking for a person who likes fun, creative, and deep conversations. I live for the moment and take a while to build feelings which has led to extreme struggles when it comes to dating. This is just one way I am putting myself out there. Feel free to message if you are interested in getting to know me as a friend or as something more.",1,1755715204.0,dateademi,1,1.0,False

**Memory Transcription Subject: General Kam of the Venlil Republic.**

**Date [Standardised Equus Time]: 20th day of the Second Month of Summer, 1111**

I took a sip out of a mug of a warm, caffeinated drink the Equestrians call ""coffee"", as I walked past groups of people of several shapes and sizes manning their stations here in the control center at the newly erected Equus-Venlil Prime Exchange Outpost. Following me were my own Exchange partners Gale, a tall, lean, bluish-grey, male Dragon with orange membranous spines, blue horns, and sea-green eyes, and Clypeus, a light green, female Changeling with pink translucent wings under a burnt-yellow elytra, and light purple eyes. I addressed the crew as I sat at my station, ""Report.""

""Systems still nominal, sir!"" Said a female Gojid in Engineering.

""No incidents reported, General."" Said a male Venlil in Security.

""Weapons operational on Standby, sir."" Said a male Krakotl in Weapons.

""Sickbay still clear, General."" said a female Zurulian in Medical.

""So far, all scouts report clear skies, sir!"" Said a female Harchen in Defense.

I flicked my ear in acknowledgement, my tail swaying contentedly. ""Alright. Let's hope today stays this way."" I then addressed my Exchange partners as I looked toward them with one eye, still surveying the bridge with the other, taking another sip of coffee. ""I take it you're comfortable? Enjoying the view from space?""

To which Clypeus replied, ""The view is amazing! Globes and maps don't do the real thing justice!"" Her insectoid wings buzzed excitedly.

Gale just rhythmically tapped a foot on the floor impatiently. ""Yeah, it's fine and all, but I was hoping I'd see you fight the Arxur, being a General, y'know?"" His tapping stopped as his eyes widened and he put his hands up defensively as his mind caught up with his words. ""N-not saying I hope anycreature gets hurt! Honest! I'm just‚Ä¶ bored."" He put his hands down, hanging his head. ""I tried entertaining myself with 'television' and the holopad the Exchange gave us, but I'm not one for just sitting around.‚Äù

I empathized with the young reptilian: ""I thought the same at first, 'What good is a soldier, when there's no battle to be had?' If my years of service taught me one thing, it's that war is a terrible thing. I've lost friends, comrades, and family to the Greys, so even in my position, it's best to enjoy the times they *aren't* raiding or hunting us."" I looked up, tapping a claw to my chin as I pondered a solution to his boredom. ""Perhaps if you're seeking physical enrichment, you can hop on one of our VR battle simulators. They're programmed for realism to train pilots!""

Just as I finished that statement, a light flashed on one of the comms officer's displays. ""General, we've got a distress signal! One of our scouts is hailing us, sir!"" Said a female Venlil.

I gestured to my Exchange partners to find a seat as I focused on the comms officer. ""Patch them in.""

The voice of a young, male Venlil spoke quickly over the link. ""Exchange Outpost, we're reading nine Arxur bombers en route. Figure they have you as their target.""

*The Arxur, here, already? Why now?* ""Fuck. We have to stop them at all costs."" I paused to gather my thoughts. ""The first large transport of Equestrians, and a couple hundred wind up dead? Their predators will never send anyone again‚Ä¶"" I said under my breath.

""We're right here, you know!"" Said my Dragon Exchange partner, and a female Griffon over the comms simultaneously, making me realize I said it louder than I thought, breaking me out of my stupor.

""Right. This is General Kam from Venlil Command, we copy you. We'll position our new fighters on an intercept course, while we evacuate everyone here. Stall for time if you can.""

[A second] passed, ""Yes, sir. We'll do our best.""

I motioned to cut the link, and tapped on my console, relaying my orders. As the civilians below evacuated, I began giving orders. ""Bring up their location on-screen.""

""Yes, sir."" Said the Harchen.

A blue dot and a line of gray dots appeared on the screen, representing the Scout that hailed us, and the FTL disruptors respectively.

[A minute] passed, before the gray dots lit up, and nine orange dots appeared. *Get out of there, pilot‚Ä¶* I thought to myself, before watching the blue dot make a maneuver between two bombers, which went still, before two others made chase as the Venlil craft fled as fast as the engines would go, thankfully away from the station.

I zoomed out to see our newly built Heavy Equestrian Laser fleet on an intercept course toward the five remaining Arxur vessels.

The comms officer piped up with a shaky voice, ""S-s-sir‚Ä¶! The A-Arxur are hailing us!""

*Probably to gloat about their superiority again.* I opened my mouth to respond, but was overstepped by Gale, with dark smoke billowing from his nostrils, wings spread wide, and eyes practically *glowing* with righteous fury.

""Put them on! I know how to deal with these bullies!"" He practically yelled, glaring at the comms officer. I flicked an ear 'go ahead', and I pointed Gale to the camera before we braced for the Arxur to appear on-screen.

""Venlil outpost! Prepare for your de-"" The predator stopped, noticing the binocular being in front of it. ""You're not Venlil‚Ä¶ Not Harchen, and *certainly* not Arxur."" The beast made a sound like gravel scraping rocks that my translator said was laughter. ""Ha ha! Another fellow sapient conquered the Venlil! Apologies for interrupting your conquest. What say you hand over a couple dozen prey, and we'll be on our way?""

Gale glared at the monster on the screen, puffing dual rings of smoke as he breathed angrily. ""We Dragons are *not* your 'fellows', you cowardly *monster!*"" He then rose into the air with a beat of his wings, and hovered menacingly toward the camera, the Arxur's eyes widened at this. ""The Venlil are our *friends!* Leave now, or I will grab a ship, I will ram it into yours, and I will roast you, *LIMB BY LIMB!*"" He roared wordlessly as he blew a breath of blue flame toward the ceiling, startling the crew. The display activated only the sprinkler directly above himself, the water steaming off of his body in wisps like an invisible flame as he glared into the camera. The spot he blew on the ceiling glowed red hot.

The Arxur cut the feed, and the crew drew a collective sigh of relief, though a Venlil fainted, before we watched the battle on the view screen commence. ""Well, that didn‚Äôt work. So much for telling off an Arxur."" Gale sighed as he landed by Clypeus' side, sitting back down in his seat.

""You did a great job, Gale."" Clypeus said, putting a hoof on his shoulder comfortingly. ""If a Changeling knows anything about anything, it's emotions."" She looked back toward the view screen, continuing. ""Even though I couldn't *feel* their emotions, from *that far away,*"" She started as she waved a hoof in the general direction of the screen. ""That Arxur was scared shitless when you blew that fire!""

The corners of Gale's mouth curled upward in that ""smile"", though he was mindful not to bare teeth. ""Thanks, Clippy."" He said softly as he draped an arm across Clypeus' shoulders.

The Harchen in Defense spoke up in a faint flash of magenta. ""The fleet has made contact with the Arxur vessels, sir!"" She said as she brought up the visual feed, the station's AI algorithm patching together the fleet's cameras into a proper holographic display.

I flicked an ear in acknowledgement. ""Good. Fire at will."" I said, watching over a dozen of the new weapons fire upon a single Arxur ship, putting it out of commission, before the others had time to charge their own weapons.

Several of our ships went down in the first volley, while others pushed their ships' structural limits in evasive flips and high-G maneuvers I had never seen before. I highlighted a couple of those ships on my own console. *A Pegasus Pony, and a Griffon. Makes sense, I guess. Flying species tend to make natural pilots.* As I ruminated, I noticed other ships' shields glow different colors from the standard pale bluish, and take a plasma hit that they otherwise couldn't have. Selecting one of those ships revealed a Unicorn Pony. *More of this ""magic"" stuff. The deadline is getting dangerously close, and we still haven't learned enough about it to do anything useful with it! That reflective armor Valek recorded would be very useful right about now.*

Another Arxur bomber was hit in the engine, dead in the water. I saw an Arxur railgun round make contact with one of our ships, and pass right through it, as if it wasn't even there! Much closer to the bomber that just fired, the display picked up an H.E.L. fire out of nowhere, taking out the railgun, before a fighter suddenly appeared. I tapped on that one before I lost it again. A Changeling. *Clypeus did say illusions are Changelings' fort√©.*

I then noticed several H.E.L. units make long-distance shots, that were nonetheless effective, keeping out of Arxur range, but taking out vital points anyway, as if they were some kind of sniper. Another tap. Another Unicorn. *Is there **anything** these Unicorns **can't do?!***

With their main weapons inoperable, the two remaining Arxur bombers turned around to flee, but not before releasing a couple of their bombs in a desperate last-ditch move to take out as many of our ships as possible before leaving.

While a couple dozen H.E.L.s took out their engines and cargo bays, a few dozen ships circled the two bombs, and a gray glow enveloped them, gently bringing them together, before a thick, multicolored, multilayered shield appeared around them, before they exploded, the shield protecting the ships. Each one of the ships involved in this spectacle was either a Unicorn, a Kirin, or a Changeling rubbing their horns in the aftermath.

The crew cheered when visuals and scanners confirmed that all of the Arxur bombers were out of commission. For once, the Venlil won a skirmish against the Arxur!

Author's Note: I hope you enjoyed this chapter! I know I did! I've been waiting weeks to write this scene about a Dragon intimidating an Arxur over the comms, and I'm proud of how it went down! I also figured out a comfortable schedule for writing: One week on, one week off, so expect a chapter about every other week.

We LOVED all of our vendors and had the most amazing weekend. I was mentally prepared for things to go wrong, but everything ran so smoothly due to our amazing vendor team. If I can figure out how to add photos I'll try to post some of the decor.

\*Edit: Here is a [link to some photos](https://imgur.com/a/OvG9r6v) \[credits to Emma Peterson Photography\]

# Overview

**Location:** Chicago, IL (downtown)

**Date:** Saturday in August 2025

**Guest Count:** 148 (invited), 104 (Final count), 93 (actual guest count day-of)

**Timeline:** engaged Nov 2023, booked almost all wedding vendors March 2024 (17 months in advance)

**Budget:** We planned as if our budget was $50k (for the wedding day only) knowing we didn‚Äôt want to spend more than $60k. We would have gone over if we‚Äôd planned for 60, so set your budget low.

**Notes:**

* We had no wedding party. This unintentionally saved us money.
* Our friend officiated (for free) and we got her a nice gift to say thank you.
* During the planning process we got quotes for 130 ppl (wedding day) and 100 ppl (welcome party). We were expecting 100-120 guests to actually come and were thrilled with our final guest count.

**Our Priorities:**

* Neither of our families are local so almost everyone flew in. We wanted to be in the city to make it easy for everyone.
* The food. Our friends and family know us as foodies. We both mentioned in our vows how much we like eating together and trying new foods. It would have been awkward if the food was then bad. Lula is one of our favorite brunch spots so we did not hesitate when we learned they do wedding catering. They did not disappoint and we got so many compliments.
* We didn‚Äôt want a hotel ballroom and wanted a place with character so we‚Äôd have to bring in only minimal decor.

**Cost Breakdown:**

* Welcome Party: **$11,420.36**
* Wedding: **$59,898.04**
* Sunday Event: **$2,519.42**

   * bridal bouquet, boutonniere, alter flowers (re-used for our sweet heart table), no reception table flowers. Should have cost 3x more for the product she delivered. Flowers were low priority for us, so we were not expecting them to be as nice as they turned out.

   * Note: could have ordered candles for cheaper on amazon but our coordinator recommended yummi because they don‚Äôt melt as quickly and don‚Äôt make as much of a mess by dripping every where. They were still pretty drippy so if amazon is worse I'm glad we got these.

**Notes:**

* booked August 2024. idk if booking a year early got us a better price. We included this event on our invites so we wanted to solidify plans early.
* We invited everyone to our welcome party. Final guest count we paid for: 102 (5 under 21). It was important to us that we could feed and provide drinks to everyone (not a cash bar). Thus, we went for a more casual spot where food was cheaper.
* We invited people to stop by any time between 6-10pm since we knew most people would be flying in that day or coming after work locally. The whole thing was very causal and essentially a 4 hour cocktail hour. We did not assign tables, seats, or have speeches. People showed up whenever and ate and drank as they wanted.
* We chose the ‚Äú**Big Star Celebration Package**‚Äù which included 1 app (chips and salsa), 3 tacos (we did al pastor, pollo, and pescado), and 1 side (Big star salad). This was served buffet style and people could grab food whenever. $25/person which was SO much cheaper than anywhere else to feed people a full meal.
* **Drink Package:** Classic Beverage package which included unlimited: 2 Big Star Cocktails (we chose mango margarita and whiskey high ball), mixed well drinks, Rotating Craft Beer, Cervezas Mexicanas, Classic Beers, Wine, N/A Beverages. $50/person
* Pricing was per head and there was a $7k F&B minimum (not including fees) for the space. On top of the per head price there was a service fee (gratuity), 3% admin fee, and sales tax which are all included in the price above.
* This was amazing and the staff did an awesome job. I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. It was really hot that day (90s F), and the space was covered but outside which I was worried about. It was def toasty but with the fans and shade it was totally fine. We just accepted that it was going to be a hot weekend and tried to warn people to dress in something breezy.
* We paid for a photographer for Friday which was $700 ($600 + $100 tip) for the four hours. She is a second shooter for our wedding photographer who is just starting up her own business so we got a great price. She was great! Hanako at Afterglow Studio.

# Sunday Coffee & Pastries

**Cost: $2,519.42**

* Our parents stayed in an airbnb (4 bedroom home) next to the venue that is also owned by the venue owner. This was super convenient for the weekend. They would have paid to stay in a hotel otherwise so the price to rent the airbnb for the weekend is not included in the price above.
* We invited everyone to stop by the house on Sunday morning starting at 11am to say bye and for coffee. We intentionally did not call it brunch because we did not want to be responsible for providing people with a full meal which kept costs (and logistics) down.
* 85 people RSVP‚Äôd yes, we probably had closer to 60 show up which was what we expected.
* Cost breakdown:
   * Mobile Coffee Bar (Same Sip Coffee): $826.88
      * Matt did an amazing job and should start charging more. They set up under a tent (which they brought) in the backyard and provided espresso drinks (hot or iced), chai, cold brew, and drip coffee. They used Dark Matter beans which are the groom‚Äôs favorite and he even got to choose the blend. They were extremely kind and brought everything they needed. The coffee was better than many coffee shops in the city (and we go to a lot, hence why we wanted one at our wedding).
   * Pastries from Mindy‚Äôs Bakery: $914.38
      * drop catering which they delivered
      * a combo of mini bagels and pastries which they quoted us based on our guest count. We had plenty left over.
   * Event Staffing (Party Host Helper): $464 + $100 in tips
      * We paid for two people to come help set up, refill things during the event, and help clean up after. Our parents also did **a lot** to help clean and set up but having help definitely made everyone less stressed and was worth it to us. Our wedding coordinator recommended Party Host Helper. They were cheap and got the job done. Don‚Äôt expect the same level of service as a full service catering team obviously. I printed out very detailed instructions for them in advance which we gave them day of.
   * Amazon Order: $138.51
      * paper plates, cups, plastic silverware, napkins, 5 cardboard disposable trash cans, cans of seltzer water
   * Water bottles (Costco): $17.97 for 120 bottles
      * so much cheaper than ordering on amazon but I did have to go in person to get them
   * Instacart order: $57.68
      * delivered day of, ice for cooler (we reused the one that held ice cream at the wedding), orange juice, 3 fruit plates",19,1755714701.0,Chicagoweddings,7,1.0,False
1mvn4bi,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerInUse/comments/1mvn4bi/explore_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Explore the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Nespresso Vertuo Review,"I‚Äôve been using the Nespresso BNV220CRO1BUC1 Vertuo Coffee and Espresso Maker by Breville for a little over a month now, and let me just say, my morning coffee routine has been completely transformed. As someone who enjoys experimenting with different brews and drinks throughout the day, this machine‚Äôs versatility has certainly earned a prime spot on my countertop. It‚Äôs not just another coffee maker; it's more like an at-home barista ready to serve up a consistent cup of joy every morning. But as much as I‚Äôve come to love it, there are a few quirks worth mentioning.

**A Sleek and Durable Design**  
The design is honestly one of the first things that caught my eye. The sleek chrome finish gives it a modern, high-end vibe that fits well into any kitchen d√©cor. It doesn‚Äôt take up too much counter space, measuring about 8 inches deep, 12 inches wide, and 12 inches high, which is compact for what it offers. I also appreciate how lightweight it feels for a machine of its capabilities, weighing just around 10.8 pounds. The removable water tank positioned at the back is a great touch, as it‚Äôs easy to refill and clean. However, I do wish the tank were slightly larger since I tend to go through a few cups per day, and refilling it often can become an extra task.

**Winning Points**  
- Remarkably easy to operate with one-touch brewing functionality.  
- Versatile brewing options catering to various cup sizes (5oz, 8oz, single espresso, and double espresso).  
- Fast pre-heating time of just 25 seconds.  
- Energy-efficient auto shut-off after use.  

**Performance That Doesn‚Äôt Disappoint**  
What I love the most about this device is its consistency. The Centrifusion technology is like a little bit of magic; it gets my coffee brewed perfectly every time. The machine reads the barcode on the Nespresso capsules, adjusting the brewing parameters automatically for optimal flavor and crema. The crema, in particular, is thick and velvety‚Äîa mark of a high-quality brew that rivals what I get at good coffee shops. Whether I‚Äôm making a hot bold coffee, silky espresso, or even an iced drink on warmer afternoons, the results are impressively consistent.  

[Check Nespresso BNV220CRO1BUC1 price on Amazon.](https://maisea.com/p/b01n6tvx8h/)  

**Limitations**  
- Only compatible with Nespresso Vertuo capsules, which limits choice and might add to the long-term cost.  
- The pod disposal container feels slightly limited, and you may find yourself emptying it more often than you‚Äôd like.  
- Slightly noisier than I expected during operation, particularly during the spinning phase of brewing.

**A Coffee Maker for Every Occasion**  
This machine caters to a variety of coffee preferences. With simple button functionality, I can whip up anything from a single espresso to an extra-large 14oz coffee. It also accommodates iced coffee lovers like me. Whenever I need a refreshing drink, I just brew my favorite pod and pour it over ice‚Äîdelicious and fuss-free. Although I couldn‚Äôt resist testing its versatility, the Nespresso BNV220CRO1BUC1 hasn‚Äôt faltered, giving me great results across the board.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to some of its competitors, the Vertuo truly stands out in ease of use and overall brew quality. For instance, brands like Keurig might offer a broader range of pod compatibility, but they fall short in delivering barista-quality crema. Machines like the De‚ÄôLonghi Dedica are great alternatives if you prefer traditional espresso-making, but they lack the convenience of single-touch operations and barcode technologies. I‚Äôd still pick this one if I was looking to maximize convenience without sacrificing taste.  

**Value Proposition**  
While this coffee maker is an investment, I genuinely think it‚Äôs worth the splurge for what it brings. A personalized cup of coffee at the press of a button saves me the hassle of long lines at coffee shops. Plus, the complimentary starter pack of capsules included in the box was a pleasant surprise. It gave me a chance to explore various blends right away. For anyone wondering about the price-to-quality ratio, let‚Äôs just say this is a case of getting what you pay for‚Äîa quality coffee experience without complication.

Here‚Äôs how I burned out building my business and what I‚Äôd do differently.","10 years ago, I was 25 and convinced I‚Äôd be a millionaire by 30.

I consumed all the ‚Äúhustle‚Äù content Gary V, Grant Cardone, you name it. My diet was coffee, podcasts, and self-loathing.

I started a small e-commerce store with literally $1,200 scraped from my savings. The first year was brutal: 80+ hour weeks, no vacations, constant stress. But it worked. By year 3, revenue hit $1.2M. On paper, I was ‚Äúliving the dream‚Äù.

Here‚Äôs the catch:

I didn‚Äôt see my friends for months.

I was 40 pounds overweight.

I once missed my mom‚Äôs birthday dinner because I was negotiating a $3,000 wholesale deal (that later fell through).

My relationship ended because I was married to Shopify, not her.

Financial breakdown (for the curious):

Year 1: $36k revenue / $12k profit

Year 2: $400k revenue / $85k profit

Year 3: $1.2M revenue / $210k profit

Year 4: $850k revenue / $120k profit (market shift + burnout = decline)

What‚Äôs wild is that when I finally ‚Äúmade it‚Äù (six figures profit), I felt worse than when I was broke.

I had money, but no life.

The turning point was honestly embarrassing: I ended up in the ER at 29 with heart palpitations from stress + caffeine. The doctor literally said: ‚ÄúYour business is killing you faster than poverty would.‚Äù

So I pulled back.

Hired a real team instead of trying to be Superman.

Sold off part of the company.

Built slower, but more sustainably.

Now I‚Äôm 35. Net worth is \~$2.4M (mix of business equity, real estate, and cash), but the real win is that I sleep 8 hours a night, spend time with my kid, and don‚Äôt check Slack at 3am anymore.

Lessons I wish someone had drilled into me earlier:

Revenue ‚â† happiness.

Profit ‚â† freedom (if you‚Äôre chained to the business).

‚ÄúGrinding‚Äù works, but it also grinds you.

Hire sooner than you think.

Family and health compound faster than money.

I‚Äôm sharing this because I see a lot of people here asking for the ‚Äúmagic pill‚Äù or obsessing over hitting $1M. I was that guy. The million is great, but if you don‚Äôt design your life first, you‚Äôll hate the life you sacrificed everything for.

Question to the sub: For those of you who ‚Äúmade it‚Äù (whatever that means for you) did it actually feel like you expected? Or did you have to re-define success too?",58,1755714332.0,Entrepreneur,19,0.9,False

LIKE, LITERALLY, MY AUTISTIC BRAIN REFUSES TO COMPUTE IT. These are the people KEEPING YOU ALIVE, making sure you don‚Äôt die, helping you when you‚Äôre SCARED OR SICK, holding your hand when everything feels like it‚Äôs falling apart and somehow the stereotype is ‚Äúmean girls‚Äù??? WHAT.

Yes, of course there are BAD APPLES in every profession. Some teachers are terrible, some mechanics scam you, some baristas spell your name wrong on purpose. But we don‚Äôt trash-talk ENTIRE PROFESSIONS over one or two bad experiences. Why are NURSES the one group that gets that treatment?? IT MAKES ZERO SENSE.

And it‚Äôs not abstract for me. Most of the nurses I know or the people in my life training to be nurses are some of the KINDEST, HARDEST-WORKING, MOST EMPATHETIC HUMANS ON THE PLANET. My best friend in Florida also named Jenna, funnily enough is a nurse. My sister Meg knows MULTIPLE nurses from college (like, A LOT she went to a big school). My sister has multiple friends going into nursing. I have THREE second cousins in New Hampshire all pursuing different nursing roles. And my three cousins on my dad‚Äôs side who are nurses Katie, Kelci, and Kourtney are absolute LEGENDS. My cousin Jenna is in healthcare. My cousin Kaitlyn works in healthcare/insurance. THEY ARE SMART, SELFLESS, AND ABSOLUTELY CRUSHING IT.

THEY DESERVE FLOWERS. THEY DESERVE COOKIES. THEY DESERVE FREE COFFEE FOR LIFE. During COVID, we literally CELEBRATED THEM banging pots, sending food, chalking ‚ÄúTHANK YOU NURSES‚Äù everywhere. And now suddenly people forget? NO. BRING THAT APPRECIATION BACK. Not just one week a year, but ALL THE TIME.

The stereotype isn‚Äôt just inaccurate it‚Äôs HARMFUL. It spreads unnecessary negativity about people whose jobs are already EXHAUSTING and EMOTIONALLY DRAINING. It discourages amazing, empathetic people from joining the field. It makes hospitals LESS SUPPORTIVE for everyone. And it feeds into this weird gossip culture that my autistic brain just CANNOT PROCESS.

So yeah. I cannot understand why anyone would TRASH-TALK the very people keeping them alive and helping them through some of the HARDEST moments of their lives. Nurses are the BACKBONE of healthcare. MY BRAIN CANNOT ACCEPT THIS SLANDER. STOP IT. APPRECIATE THEM. THANK THEM. GIVE THEM COOKIES.

1mvmvlm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1mvmvlm/i_dont_like_my_cats_even_after_a_year_and_feel/,"I don‚Äôt like my cats even after a year, and feel conflicted","Posting this on Reddit as the reaction I get from my friends is generally ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just part of the deal‚Äù (and they‚Äôre not wrong), I‚Äôm curious what others think and I guess just to vent a little. Let me preface this by saying I feel very guilty and ashamed for this. Maybe I‚Äôm overreacting or overthinking things, maybe not. You be the judge.

So, a little over a year ago, I adopted two kittens which were almost a year old at the time. Two sisters. One of them has been sterilised, the other one has yet to be (which I want to do soon). I recently went on vacation with my friends, who also own cats, and one of them said how much they missed their cats. I caught myself not really missing my own cats, but instead, really only missing my dog (she‚Äôs in a different room/outside, 14 years old, and I have a deep emotional connection to her, more on that later). Fast forward to this week, and I find myself busy deep-cleaning my leather couch because one of them has peed on it multiple times, looking up what could‚Äôve caused it, how to prevent it next time, while being extremely frustrated‚Ä¶ which is when I realised. It feels like they cost me more energy mentally (also physically I guess) than what enjoyment I get out of them. And I feel incredibly guilty, selfish, and ashamed about this, not sure what to do.

For more context: I also have a dog, which we‚Äôve had in the family since I was 15, at a time where we were in a bad situation back then ‚Äî since we got her as a puppy, she brightened up our home. She‚Äôs lived at my place for some years now, since it made more sense as others didn‚Äôt have the room for her. I enjoy having her here so, so much, taking care of her (which increased as she‚Äôs pretty old by now). I really absolutely dread the day we have to let her go but I‚Äôm slowly starting to accept that.

I adopted the two cats, after thinking it over for a long time. My friends (a lot of them also have cats) kept recommending it, as well as some colleagues. I thought by myself that in terms of maintenance, it wouldn‚Äôt be much of a challenge since I‚Äôm used to taking care of a dog for many years. It would also be nice, as it wouldn‚Äôt be silent at home when eventually my dog would pass away. I live alone, in a house slightly too large for just one person (I‚Äôm very grateful I managed to get a place though, don‚Äôt get me wrong). Maybe deep down I feared being lonely? So I went to pick them up. The previous owners were very nice people, and they put them up online because unfortunately someone passed away, so they couldn‚Äôt leave the cats behind obviously. After the usual span of time you read about online, the cats started feeling at home, everything according to plan. Really ‚Äúnormal‚Äù cats I guess. But as many people here know, with having cats also comes the necessary trouble. I‚Äôve learned to accept certain things (ruined curtains, damaged stuff etc.) but I‚Äôve realised it has become really exhausting to me. I quickly learned plants don‚Äôt survive with them and I shouldn‚Äôt leave anything on display or it‚Äôll scratched or bitten. I can‚Äôt turn my back when food‚Äôs on the table, or they start licking/stealing it, within literal seconds. Even drinks when I‚Äôm watching something, I have to constantly guard from them. Parts of corners of the wall and couch have been scratched to bits. Can‚Äôt leave my laptop alone or the cat will start gnawing at the screen corners. I have to wipe hairs and smudges the countertop every time as I can‚Äôt get them to learn not to walk on it. I‚Äôve hidden all my cables are visible as they‚Äôd be gnawed at otherwise. And now I‚Äôm watching TV in another room because the couches have this penetrating urine smell that I‚Äôm in the process of cleaning off.

Now, I treat the cats well, and I‚Äôm trying my ass off to get them to stop doing certain things. I keep their litter boxes clean, cut their nails often, I play with them as often as I can, they eat & drink well. Like I mentioned, I have a lot of friends with cats so I‚Äôve received numerous tips and do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts. All the secret tricks I find online to keep them away from areas or things (like limes, coffee, aluminum foil etc, Feliway device, ‚Ä¶) all seem to have no effect, even the opposite; they play and toy with everything they hate according to the internet‚Ä¶ For the record: I mentioned earlier one of them is not sterilised yet. That‚Äôs the cat who, ironically, is the calmest. It‚Äôs the other one who‚Äôs constantly rebellious and she‚Äôs been sterilised! Sometimes it feels like the sterilised cat bullies (like ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù slapping) the other cat, too, for what it‚Äôs worth.

I thought about letting them outside to explore the neighbourhood. But really, I‚Äôd only do that so that they would be inside less. So that I‚Äôd run less risk of getting my food stolen or finding something ruined at inconvenient times. So in the end, that too would be a selfish decision, I think.

Everything I have to do feels like it‚Äôs getting in the way of me enjoying, or even using, the living room, where they are. The issue is that I can‚Äôt get myself to see all these things as how others do. I read someone collects photos of their cat at the crime scene with something that fell, for example, and then laugh it off and end up thinking how much they love their cat still. I can‚Äôt get myself to think like that. The cats snuggling up or being cute doesn‚Äôt seem to outweigh the bad times for me. I get frustrated, angry all the time (I don‚Äôt harm them, don‚Äôt worry, I make sure they don‚Äôt become afraid of me). The pee incident as of recent makes me feel disgusted with them. That smell, the fact they keep messing literally everything up / breaking stuff all the time despite all my efforts. It weights me down more than I want to admit.

I know I shouldn‚Äôt compare it, but it‚Äôs so different with my dog. I‚Äôve had to do a fair share of nasty things as well, but I did it because I love her. And I would do it right again, doesn‚Äôt matter what. But I can‚Äôt imagine ever feeling that way for the cats. I don‚Äôt like them as much as I had hoped. And I know that‚Äôs not the right mindset. I know it‚Äôs selfish, and I feel guilty for feeling this way. I feel like I‚Äôm unconsciously making comparisons between my dog and my cats, or something, making me feel this way. Part of me also thinks the cats are just very naughty and it honestly feels like one in particular is actively trying to make my living room a hell making it objectively difficult for me to like them. But then I see how my friends talk about their cats, as well as people online, and I realise I‚Äôm most likely the problem. Part of me wishes I could rehome them, as they deserve someone who actually loves them and not someone who just feeds them and plays with them, like a robot. But I feel incredibly guilty even thinking about that. I feel like that‚Äôs also not the solution, aside from the judgement I‚Äôd likely get from my friends. I just feel very conflicted about all this and I hope someone can give me some useful insights on this. Thank you for reading all this if you have and apologies if my story goes all over the place.

EDIT: For clarification, don‚Äôt worry, I wasn‚Äôt planning on letting them outside anytime soon, let alone without doing some proper research too, as I know already know some of the dangers with letting them outside. I recently heard from some people it‚Äôs still doable even after they‚Äôve been inside (which might not be true of course), I live in a town in the Netherlands.

Also I‚Äôm aware that I need to keep an eye out for the peeing. Already decided that I‚Äôd go to the vet for a checkup if the peeing keeps happening, and I have a camera I can use to spy on them to figure out which one is peeing.

Hey Travel Trotters! Ever dreamed of sleeping among the trees, waking up to birdsong, and enjoying your morning coffee with panoramic forest views? Texas might not be the first place that comes to mind for treehouse adventures, but the Lone Star State is hiding some seriously cool elevated escapes!

I spent the last month exploring these unique stays and let me tell you‚Äîthese aren't your childhood backyard treehouses. From hand-crafted whimsical retreats to luxurious stilted cabins, here's my rundown of the most incredible treehouse rentals in Texas.

## For the True Nature Lovers üåø

**The Hobbit's Nest in Paige** feels like stepping into a Studio Ghibli film! This hand-crafted beauty is the real deal‚Äîbuilt right into the trees with rustic wooden details everywhere. The outdoor shower under the canopy was magical at sunset. Just note: it's got a compost toilet and limited electricity, so it's perfect for those wanting to disconnect (I actually loved the digital detox!).

**Ryders Treehouse in Baird** stole my heart with its spiral staircase and bird's-eye patio. The stone firepit was perfect for evening s'mores, and watching the sunset over the rugged landscape with a glass of wine? *Chef's kiss* üëå I've already booked my return visit for fall.

## Fredericksburg Finds üç∑

Fredericksburg isn't just for wine tours! **Leaf Treehouse** and **Live Oak Treehouse** (both at The Meadow) offer that perfect balance of rustic charm and modern comforts. The reading nooks at Leaf were so cozy I ended up extending my stay just to finish my book in that perfect spot.

Pro tip: these book up MONTHS in advance, especially during wildflower season. I snagged mine 5 months out and it was worth the planning!

## Quirky & Unforgettable Stays ü§©

**The Nut House in Aubrey** looks like a giant acorn from the outside (great for photos!), but step inside to find surprisingly sleek, modern interiors. The winding staircase and designer sleeping nook made me feel like I was in an architectural magazine spread.

**Air Castle Treehouse in Ladonia** is WILD, y'all! Six floors of shipping container innovation with multiple balconies and a crow's nest lookout. It's like someone combined a treehouse with suburban living. Perfect if you want the treehouse experience but need more space‚Äîmy sister's family of four had plenty of room to spread out.

## Kid-Friendly Options üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶

Traveling with little ones? **Yellowstone Treehouse in Forestburg** has a winding slide that my nephew declared ""the coolest thing EVER!"" It's technically a stilted mobile home, but the height and canopy location give true treehouse vibes.

**Luxury Tree House & Magical Forest Pool in Fredericksburg** has TWO bedrooms and access to a large outdoor pool. The in-laid mesh bed was a hit with the kids‚Äîthey called it their ""spy net"" and spent hours reading comics there.

## Romantic Retreats ‚ù§Ô∏è

**The Nest by Skybox Cabins in Glen Rose** has serious bohemian vibes. My husband and I spent a weekend here for our anniversary and barely left the property. The sunrise views from bed are worth setting an alarm for (trust me!).

**The Hobbit Treehouse in Forestburg** is only available on Fridays, making it super exclusive. It's cozy, intimate, and perfect for reconnecting. We turned our phones off and played board games all evening!

## Kirbyville's Hidden Gems üíé

Don't sleep on Kirbyville! Both the **Romantic Treehouse in the Pines** and the **Cozy Treehouse with Hot Tub** share property with a mini-farm (THE GOATS ARE SO FRIENDLY!) and a lake for kayaking. The claw-foot tub with forest views was the highlight of my stay‚Äînothing beats a bubble bath while watching deer wander past!

## Planning Your Treehouse Adventure üß≥

**Best seasons:** Spring for wildflowers, Fall for comfortable temperatures and changing leaves.

**What to pack:** Binoculars for wildlife spotting, bug spray (especially for summer stays), portable charger for the more rustic options, and slip-on shoes for those middle-of-the-night bathroom trips!

**Average costs:** $150-300/night depending on luxury level and season.

**Booking windows:** Most require 2-night minimums and book 3-6 months out for peak seasons.

The best part about these treehouse stays is how they showcase different sides of Texas. From the pine forests of East Texas to the rugged landscapes of Central Texas, each offers a unique perspective on the Lone Star State's diverse natural beauty.

I've found that having a flexible schedule helps snag last-minute cancellations‚ÄîI booked The Nut House just 48 hours before arrival when someone canceled!

1mvms66,https://www.reddit.com/r/IslamIsEasy/comments/1mvms66/how_to_hide_fasting_from_nonmuslim_family/,How to Hide Fasting From Non-Muslim Family,"Many new reverts or people considering reverting soon live with families that are Islam0ph0bic. When Ramadan comes insha Allah, they may face the challenge of hiding their fast. I saw someone asking for help with this, so I wanted to share some ideas that can help people who might face such challenges.

Remember to use as many of these ideas as possible and not just one or two so that your behavior seems ""normal."" Also, **don't wait until Ramadan begins**. Start using these tips a few weeks beforehand so your family doesn't notice a sudden change in your habits, become suspicious, or link your behavior to fasting. With that said, here are a few ideas

* Walk around the house with a bottle of water or a cup of tea, even if it's empty.

* Come home with an almost empty box of pizza for example so it looks like you ""ate"" outside.

* Say you've already eaten, for example, with friends or at work. Alternatively, you could claim you're not feeling hungry or that you're a bit tired and need to rest (Read the first note down below.)

* Open the fridge or the drawer randomly so that unconsciously, your family thinks you‚Äôre eating.

* Order takeout to your home, receive it in front of them, and then take it to your room to ""eat"" it.

* Make your usual coffee or breakfast so it looks normal, then hide it.

* If breakfast or lunch is prepared by them, try to delay it so that you ""eat"" it alone, then store it.

* Try to have dinner with them so they don't suspect you're purposely avoiding meals.

* **When in need** to eliminate your family's doubts, chew a gum that does **not contain any substances** that will dissolve and enter the stomach as that doesn't break your fast. Check out this [**reference**](https://www.islamweb.net/en/fatwa/81437/chewing-gum-while-fasting) and this [**one**](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38206/can-you-chew-gum-while-fasting) as well.

* Spend as much time as possible out of the house to reduce the amount of time you need to pretend. Try scheduling activities like meeting a friend, tutoring, or going for a walk during meal times.

* Try Islamic fasting before Ramadan, but tell them it's intermittent fasting to avoid raising suspicions. This will get you good deeds, will train your body to avoid noticeable weakness and other symptoms during Ramadan, and your family will simply think you're continuing your usual routine when the month starts.



**Notes:**

* While lying is generally prohibited, it can be **permissible if** it doesn't harm anyone, provides a significant benefit, and is the only option. So, if you're in an unexpected situation where you need to hide your fast for example and can't think of a quick solution, you can lie or make up an excuse to avoid exposing your secret and getting into trouble.

* Avoid suspicion¬†about **eating halal**: ask for something vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, halal, or kosher. All of these are lawful if they have no alcohol. Make the impression that you like to try new things, and alternate between these foods to avoid suspicion or inconsistency. If suspected, claim you're trying to stick to a healthy diet. Maybe you can avoid one or two unhealthy foods at least in front of them so that your claim seems genuine. Like coke, potato chips...

* To hide praying Taraweeh, you might consider taking night walks or evening lessons before Ramadan begins. This way, you can continue going out at night as usual when the month starts. Remember that unlike fasting, Taraweeh is **a confirmed Sunnah, not an obligatory prayer**. While it is highly rewarded and better prayed at a mosque, you can also pray it alone at home. This can be a good option if you sometimes need to stay in to avoid raising your family's suspicions.",1,1755713961.0,IslamIsEasy,3,1.0,False
