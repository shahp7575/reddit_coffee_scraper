My next flight takes of 13 hours later (although getting in/out of the airport plus immigration shrinks it to 9 hours of free time), so of course I want to take this opportunity to do some sightseeing. I have prepared this plan, but I might have missed some better things to do, or things that can't be done in time (although I checked all transport times with maps), or you have some suggestions or anything:

* Arrive at 12am at Grand Central (or somewhere nearby)
* Bounce Grand Central Terminal, Arrive at 12:00, drop luggage
* Nino's Breakfast Shack (on the way), Arrive at 12:20, get coffee and bagel, keep the coffee cup. Ask if I can get the larger size cup even with a regular coffee, ask where to get another bagel when I return at 20:00, since this place will be closed
* Times Square, Arrive at 12:30 and stay 5 minutes just to see the vibe
* $1.50 Fresh Pizza 1723 Broadway, Arrive at 12:45
* Columbus Circle, walk along Broadway to get there at 13:00
* Walk through Central Park, leaving at 14:00 from Strawberry Fields
* Eileen's Special Cheesecake 17 Cleveland Pl, Arrive at 14:30, there shouldn‚Äôt be a line
* Katz's Delicatessen 205 E Houston St, Arrive at 14:45, there shouldn‚Äôt be much wait for takeout
* Whitehall Terminal, Arrive at 16:15, ferry departs at 16:30. Leave at Wall St at 17:30 (no waiting on Staten Island)
* Wall St, Arrive at 17:45, leave at 18:15. If possible, grab something to eat later
* Subway to High St and walk across Brooklyn Bridge, starting around 18:30, or 18:45 if the sun is still too high
* Return to Bounce Grand Central 20:00, pick up luggage and head back to JFK international

The problem is I can't see her till september and my original plan was to wait till then and see her irl to get to know her better since we're not so close. So I texted her and we've been texting but I think she's playing I dont wanna look too desperate move because she responds consistently in 3-4 hours like she times it. This sort of pissed me off so I ended our conversation because I wanted her to engage more actively.

So the dilemma I have is I want to talk to her but if I text again, im worried she might think ""oh yeah this guy likes likes me huh"" and play more hard to get and also I just want her to text me first but don't want to wait.

1m8lmhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m8lmhs/do_i_reconnect_with_a_struggling_former_friend/,Do I reconnect with a struggling former friend?,"This starts out as some typical high schooler drama but escalates into something much more serious. I need to explain the full situation to convey why this is especially difficult and I really don‚Äôt know what to do.

Been friends with Rose for 6 years. We were never best friends, but we were pretty close, especially around 2022-2023 when we shared a lot of interests. Unfortunately, I was like the butt of all of her jokes type of friend; she‚Äôd make me look bad in front of her best friend so that she looked good. We started growing distant when we lost those shared interests. She started making fun of me for my weight and saying rude things online that were obviously about me. 

Around early 2024 she had a blowup with her best friend and ditched her entirely. I think she thought she had all these people behind her, but she didn‚Äôt. She‚Äôs known to be very annoying, loud, and awkward, so sadly she struggles to get friends in the first place. I think she found pretty quickly that, out of her friends she had to fall back on, she was none of their first priority. After this she started trying to reconnect with me somewhat, like we never hung out really but we spoke in school and texted occasionally.

Out of nowhere one day in like September of 2024 she started talking about how left out and disliked she felt in her classes and then suddenly texted me that she had her schedule switched to match mine. We had every class together except 1. My mom was not happy about this because she thinks Rose drags me down and that I don‚Äôt need to deal with her bullshit, which I agreed with. I thought making this decision without consulting me was a bit weird. I was lenient though because I felt bad that she was struggling at school and didn‚Äôt want to ruin such a longtime friendship.

She started pissing me off quick. She never stopped talking and tried to insert herself where she didn‚Äôt belong in conversations and talk to me in the middle of class. She also liked to act like she was some sort of moral superior and judge my friends and I for who we spent time with or what we liked to do. She wore trashy outfits and shitty makeup and had some hygiene problems that we silently addressed with her by giving her some cute care packages (pads, deodorant, perfumes, lotions, etc.) and branding them as ‚Äúself care‚Äù but it never improved. None of my friends liked being around her and she just made everyone mad.

The first crest in our issues was when she gave away my concert ticket. We had planned to attend a concert for 2 years (since 2022) and it was finally announced. We literally jumped out of our seats and went on ticketmaster the second tickets dropped. Well she said she didn‚Äôt want to offend her other friend by bringing me so she texted me later to say she gave my ticket to her sister. I was so mad, I‚Äôd saved $400 for this occasion and planned outfits and makeup and she threw it away in thirty seconds so she didn‚Äôt piss off someone who was never involved in our plans. She sent an apology text and I accepted it way too fast; my other friends said they‚Äôd never forgive her like that. It‚Äôs important to mention I have taken her to 2 concerts and offered to take her to 2 others and taken her to theme parks twice. She‚Äôs paid me once out of those 4 occasions.

The second crest was the last day before Christmas break. She invited a friend of hers to our lunch table which, like, obvs wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal. We didn‚Äôt really know her friend well so my buddy Mikey tried making conversation with her by asking how her boyfriend (that he used to be friends with) was doing. They were doing just fine but she told him to kill himself (we don‚Äôt know why) and Rose thought that was funny as hell for some reason and that was the last straw; we all left the table and went to the library, leaving her alone. 

Apparently and unfortunately that was also her last straw; she sobbed and went to the counselor and told her she was gonna kill herself so they called crisis to have her evaluated for the mental hospital. They didn‚Äôt end up admitting her and she saw me in the hallway later that day and apologized sobbing, asking if Mikey was mad at her and if we still liked her. I encouraged her to talk to Mikey and said I forgave her. 

She texted me later that day and said she was sorry again and asked if I still liked her and if we were friends. I reflected, and decided that we didn‚Äôt really click the way we used to when we were younger. I wasn‚Äôt as loud or talkative as her and I didn‚Äôt really get her humor anymore. That alongside some pretty consistent offenses against me, I decided I wasn‚Äôt interested in being her friend anymore and told her straight up. I said we were different people than when we met and thought it was in both of our best interests to separate for a while so I could at least think about our friendship.

She initially said she‚Äôd give me some space but then suddenly confessed that she had been sexually assaulted by her heroin addicted mother about a year prior and that she was a different person because of this. She continued to apologize for her prior offenses and agreed we were no longer similar and we didn‚Äôt have to be friends. 

This fucking shattered me. It really broke my heart to know someone I had known for so long had suffered silently with this for so long. I cried so hard I got sick after hearing this horrible occurrence, and told her I took back what I said about not being friends and would be here for her as she dealt with this. I went to my mother (a counselor) and asked her for help in consoling Rose after learning of this terrible trauma. I failed to remember that my mother, as a school employee, was a mandated reporter.

My mom contacted the state child abuse authorities as per her obligation and also directly texted Rose‚Äôs father (divorced from her mother) that this had happened. Legal proceedings started and Rose planned to charge her mother. I kept up with Rose during this to make sure things were going smoothly; after all, it was my fault any of this was happening at all. She told me she knew I got her mother reported and told me she wasn‚Äôt angry with me about it and that it was actually pretty relieving. 

Around January they had made no progress on her case because they hired a private lawyer, who blocked the state from talking with Rose and her family. Rose had decided she was not ready to enter the charging process and had paused that side of things.

As you could imagine, Rose was super depressed. She had a lot going on and had lost many friends. I took it as my duty to be her personal suicide watcher. She threatened suicide often and made posts online about her depression and trauma. I made sure to always be kind to her even if none of my other friends really liked her anymore. I felt like if she were to take her own life, I‚Äôd be the one at fault for not checking on her enough. At some point around this time she thanked me for choosing to be her friend again. 

After a few months (April of this year) I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. I spoke to my therapist about how I could politely separate from her. Feeling like I was responsible for her was stressing me the FUCK out and we still were not getting along like we used to; I still felt misunderstood and disconnected in our friendship. After I explained the situation to her, my therapist suggested I create some distance between us by not feeding into her loud, talkative nature and stopping the ‚Äúbabysitting‚Äù I had been doing. I followed her advice.

As I created a barrier between us by doing less talking and allowing myself to take a step back from worrying about her, Rose obviously recognized these behaviors. She took my distance as coldness/rudeness and started to post about me online using a nickname to talk about me. She told her other friends about how mean my friends and I were and how we were switch ups and pretentious and stuff. I really didn‚Äôt know what to do. I just kept the distance and tried to see if it would blow over.

Yeah, it didn‚Äôt. She continued talking about me but the distance had been communicated; I was successful in separating myself from her, and we scarcely spoke as of June. My therapist has assured me that I had done what I could to help her and that it was time to focus on myself.

She went on vacation with some friends who graduated this past year and I don‚Äôt really think it went well because she texted me when she got home and asked to reconnect. I suggested coffee but we never made the plan. We didn‚Äôt talk for a month after that aside from her commenting on my social media posts.

She just called me this morning in tears. She said she was sorry if she made me think she was upset with me for reporting her mother and also that she was sorry for being a bad friend in the past. She said she really misses me and wants to be close friends again. She bought me a good 30-40 dollars of CDs from my favorite musician as some sort of reconciliation gift and wanted to meet to give them to me. It‚Äôs obvious she‚Äôs very alone and not having the best time. I told her I wasn‚Äôt angry or put off at all but didn‚Äôt really say anything else other than thanking her for the gifts and talking about our summers.

I told my best friend Rose had called me. She said to tell her I didn‚Äôt want to be friends. I told my mom Rose called me. She asked why I even picked up. I told my dad Rose called me. He shook his head. Nobody wants me to reconnect with Rose. I don‚Äôt want to reconnect with Rose. I don‚Äôt like her. But I know she‚Äôs having a hard time in life right now, she‚Äôs alone heading into her senior year of high school and trying to get the confidence to press charges on her own mother and she‚Äôs now no-contact with her sister, who doesn‚Äôt believe her. 

I think Rose was once a good friend but sadly became a batshit insane mean ass bitch who is going nowhere in life. I also think it‚Äôs the right thing to be there for her as she finishes school and to make sure she isn‚Äôt alone in her struggles because we were friends for so long. But also‚Ä¶. I despise every second I spend with her. I know she‚Äôs only reaching out because I‚Äôm her last resort.

I know I haven‚Äôt handled all these situations ideally and I know I‚Äôm not a perfect person. To minimize any further harm, I must ask: What do I do here? Is reconnecting and tolerating her for a while the right choice or should I tell her we shouldn‚Äôt be friends? If we shouldn‚Äôt be friends, how do I tell her this?

1m8lma4,https://www.reddit.com/r/irvine/comments/1m8lma4/man_arrested_following_a_suspected_hatemotivated/,Man arrested following a suspected hate-motivated assault,"\#IRVINEPDPIO - A man suspected of committing a hate-motivated assault during a road rage incident has been taken into custody. 

On Tuesday, around 9:30 am, the victim was driving southbound on Sand Canyon Avenue near the Interstate 5 Freeway when he encountered Robert Leon Tackett, 54, from Irvine, yelling at a Hispanic truck driver. 

After the victim passed the initial altercation, Tackett began following the victim, driving aggressively and swerving into their lane multiple times, nearly causing a collision. Tackett shouted racial slurs at the victim before throwing a cup of hot coffee into the victim‚Äôs vehicle. The liquid landed on the victim‚Äôs face, hands, and on the interior of his car. The victim filmed most of the incident, and a family member posted it on social media. Late last night, the victim contacted the Irvine Police Department and reported the incident. 

Today, at around 2:30 pm, Tackett was taken into custody for a hate crime and aggravated assault. 

Detectives ask other victims, witnesses, or anyone with additional footage of the incident to contact: rsteen@cityofirvine.org.

I had a customer come in for their first time 2 days ago, they were very nice and we had a bit of a chat. All is well. They thought we closed early, but when I told them we still had an hour before closing they were happy. No issues that day

Yesterday, they knew when we closed based off our previous conversation the day before. They came in 3 minutes before closing, and ordered a coffee to stay. I had already turned my machine off by 5 to (horribly dead all day). I turned the machine on for them and let them know I was closing in a minute, I could do takeaway that‚Äôs it. Didn‚Äôt seem impressed but I‚Äôm not going to be paid overtime so I‚Äôm not staying for one single person lol. Asked for a water while they wait, I give them and make coffee. Walk to the table and they had setup laptop, bag, etc. give the coffee and walk away, assuming they‚Äôre aware we are now closed and to gtfo. Apparently not, they come back with one coffee and ask for cold milk. I give, they go. Come back with the other coffee and asks for cold milk. I give, they go. 10 minutes go by and I‚Äôm done cleaning, ready to go. I go say ‚Äúhey, I am closing now so I do need to lock doors‚Äù. Gives me a sigh and says okay, proceeds to pack things up slowly, 5 minutes later gets up to leave, tried to chat and I quickly shut it down as I‚Äôm now way past closing and just want to go home.


Then today, they come in at 8am bright and early, starts asking to take photos of my coffee machine, the milk we use, etc etc. bit odd but whatever, go at it. I‚Äôm nice and chatty, bring their coffee with cold milk this time and they‚Äôre appreciative, and we‚Äôre sweet. Cafe dies down, and they are the only one left. It‚Äôs now 11am and they is still here - which is fine do what you do we‚Äôre a public space. But we are making no money off of them. 

Usually when it‚Äôs this dead, I vacuum or mop, but they‚Äôre seemingly deep into work and have previously asked me to turn music down/off. So no noise.

We‚Äôre relocating from Southern California to Denver and got a quote from Allied for $17,541 ‚Äî and that‚Äôs without any storage in transit. It feels high, so I‚Äôm hoping for input from folks who‚Äôve moved cross-country with full-service movers. Here‚Äôs our setup and what we were quoted for:
- Origin: 2600 sq ft house + a storage unit (both in SoCal)
- Destination: A furnished rental in Denver. Only some items go to the rental; the rest are going to a personal storage unit in Denver (not Allied‚Äôs).
- Distance: ~1,025 miles
- Estimated weight: 13,500 lbs
- Services included: Full pack, load, long-haul transport, crate for a marble-top coffee table

What‚Äôs not included: No unpacking, no furniture reassembly.
-Insurance: We‚Äôre quoted $851 for ‚ÄúExtra Care Protection‚Äù $125,000 coverage with a $0 deductible

We noticed the quote includes a Storage in Transit (SIT) fee of $346 ‚Äî but we‚Äôre not using SIT. Everything is going directly to either the furnished rental or our own storage unit. We‚Äôre asking to have that removed.

Key Concerns:
	1.	Cost ‚Äì Is $17.5K normal for this weight/distance with packing but no storage or assembly?
	2.	Damage risk ‚Äì We won‚Äôt be unpacking most of our items immediately. How risky is that in terms of identifying damage and filing a claim?
	3.	Coverage ‚Äì Is Allied‚Äôs $0 deductible coverage based on item value or weight per pound? If it‚Äôs weight-based, what happens with high-value/lightweight items?
	4.	Claim timing ‚Äì If something is broken but we don‚Äôt find out for weeks or months, do we have any recourse?


- cost comparisons from others who‚Äôve done long-distance moves (esp. SoCal to CO)
-valuation: Is $851 for $125K in coverage worth it, or are there smarter ways to insure?
- some suggestions from industry folks on how to reduce cost, protect our stuff, or avoid gotchas (e.g., condition reports, taking photos pre-move.)

We began living together after a few months, we were happy generally, great vibes, doing a lot of sweet couple stuff and even though I was getting my masters and working an internship, I was cooking her meals everyday, helping her with applications, took care of her when she injured herself, I was doing a lot of caretaking, which I‚Äôm fine with but had really significantly limited my personal time. I use to go to the gym 5 days a week, but it‚Äôs been almost 6 months since I‚Äôve stepped foot in one.

Fast forward a year, Ive graduated and have gotten a decent job offer straight out of school, she on the other hand is still searching for a job after a year of graduating her masters(highly competitive program btw). I asked her if she wanted to come with me on a trip, take her mind off of things for a few weeks. She said no, I didn‚Äôt push it and I made a dick move and just left by myself. Coming back in 2 weeks to move to our new place. She was fine with this but in hindsight sight, I should‚Äôve stayed back.

The reason was simple, I‚Äôm traveling to where my parents are, staying at their place for a few days, as it‚Äôs been years since I last saw time, and once I start working, it will be years until I get to see them again. She was understanding, as usual, but I was still worried about her, about her finding a job, staying at home alone, packing to move to a new place etc etc. before I left, I cooked her about 9meals worth of food and froze them. When I arrived, I pulled an all nighter to fix her resume, we call almost every night and she goes off of how tired she is, how frustrated and sad she is about me not being there.

Frankly speaking, I don‚Äôt get it, I miss her a lot, I do, but she works 6-7 hours max at a small coffee shop 3 days a week, her food are precooked by me, I order her some Uber eats from time to time. Yes she has to pack things up but I prepacked all my stuff, I went and looked at over 20 apartments in a week while at school and working before I left to secure an rental apartment early on, all she gotta do is hand over the cheques and money that I‚Äôve already prepared and get the keys from the landlord, I‚Äôve done the heavy lifting, I‚Äôm not complaining but to have someone call u at 2 am to hear them complain while eating food you cooked/ordered is not exactly a nice experience. I know it‚Äôs a blessing, but idk, I get frustrated and impatient when she asks me stuff like ‚Äúwhich flavor of milk tea should I buy‚Äù ‚Äúwhich bowl should I order‚Äù, like I‚Äôm not eating it you are, just choose your own. 

I‚Äôm coming back, while I still love her immensely, I don‚Äôt really see how I can still be patient with her anymore. Every time she mentions something, I see it as a task that I have to do, and it means more pressure. besides this, it‚Äôs like she also gave up trying. We had a couple of hour long quarrels just for me to convince her to put more effort into finding a job, it‚Äôs not that she don‚Äôt want to, but her actions are just nonexistent. Same thing goes for body image, eating healthy and a lot other aspects in life, she has aspirations but no actions.

VA internal monologue

	*She doesn‚Äôt have 8 minutes.* (You can change the number to any one you want, it was just a guess on how long it would take to read the following text.)

(**radio chatter)**



VA on radio

	‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make excuses for them!‚Äù

	‚ÄúOkay so the enemy caught wind that we were staging a recovery; that doesn‚Äôt mean the corporal should have called the whole thing off.¬†

(Said through his teeth) ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lie; we both know that was a bad call!‚Äù

**(Door swinging open)**



VA to listener rushing towards her

	(Relief but also frantically) ‚ÄúHey, hey‚Ä¶‚Äù



Listener is on the floor, protecting her head with her hands from VA‚Äù



VA internal monologue

	*‚ÄúShe looks worse than I had imagined; I thought I had prepared myself enough.‚Äù*



VA to listener

	(Calmingly) ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to cover your head. Here, let me help you move your arm.‚Äù

(Gasp, Shocked) ‚ÄúLet go; it‚Äôs me, it‚Äôs me! I‚Äôm not going to hurt you!‚Äù



Listener trying and failing to move away, repeating, she doesn‚Äôt know him



VA to listener

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know who I am? It‚Äôs me (insert name here), remember?¬†



VA internal monologue

*‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt she remember me? We‚Äôve worked on the field together for our whole careers.* (Knowledgably) *I need to see her better; maybe they hit her head? But why would she be so scared of me?‚Äù*



VA to listener

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have to just trust me; I am not going to hurt you!‚Äù¬†

(Desperately) ‚ÄúWhy are you fighting me? Stop fighting me.‚Äù (Making an effort grunt) ‚ÄúJust trust me, please. I‚Äôm not with them!‚Äù



Listener still struggling to hide from VA



VA to listener

	‚ÄúRelax, please. (Stern) I know you are scared but you need to stop struggling or you will hurt yourself worse.‚Äù (Pleading) ‚ÄúI need you to stay quiet or else they will find both of us, okay?‚Äù



VA overpowers listener



	(Concerned) ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got you. Calm down. Breathe for me. Please.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just going to pick you up; I know, I know it hurts. Just breathe. I‚Äôm going to get you out of here. I‚Äôm going to get you safe, okay?‚Äù



VA on radio

(**Rodger beep from radio)**

	‚ÄúI‚Äôve got her, but she‚Äôs in bad shape; (urgently) we need a way out.‚Äù



VA internal monologue

	*‚ÄúShe‚Äôs so frail! All her ribs are crushed; I can feel the sharp edges pushing against her skin. The breathing is so raspy and labored. Her skin is stretched so tight! Did they feed her at all‚Äî?*

VA to listener

	‚ÄúNo! Don‚Äôt close your eyes, hey, hey. I didn‚Äôt mean to relax this much!‚Äù¬†

(Relieved) ‚ÄúThere you go, eyes open, okay? You‚Äôre in a rough spot. If you go to sleep, you might not wake up. I just need to find how we get out of here.‚Äù



VA on radio

**(Roger beep from radio)**

	(Angrily) ‚ÄúSarg! Now!‚Äù



**(Footsteps coming closer and unintelligible yelling)**



VA aloud

	(Angrily) ‚ÄúShit, now I‚Äôm the one who needs to be quiet.‚Äù



VA to listener

	(Whisper gently) ‚ÄúKeep them open. I am very sorry for what I am about to do, but we need to get out of the cell. You can give me hell once you‚Äôre all better, okay?‚Äù



VA starts running; the movement hurts the listener.



VA to listen

	‚ÄúI know, I know, it hurts; I‚Äôll add smooth running training to my to-do list.‚Äù (Small laugh)



**(Shots from several floors above)**



VA aloud

	(Signed, annoyed but also relieved) ‚ÄúGood to hear the corporal changed his mind.‚Äù



VA to listener

	(Breathing hard from running) ‚ÄúI know that you have zero reason to trust me right now, but do you know how many guards are stationed down here?‚Äù



Listener no response



VA to listener

	(Breathing hard from running) ‚ÄúFair enough, I did say that you don‚Äôt trust me. Keep breathing, okay?‚Äù



VA internal monologue

	*‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get out of here alone.‚Äù* (Sigh of relief) *‚ÄúThis closet will have to do. I don‚Äôt even know the extent of her damage! I‚Äôll see how much I can do before help arrives.‚Äù*



VA on radio (When VA is on the radio, he sounds angry but he flips back and forth to calming talking to the listener.)

**(Roger beep from radio)**

	(Rushed) ‚ÄúI am in a southwestern room labeled utility; I heard footsteps and had to run. She won‚Äôt tell me how many guards will be returning back down here. I need backup immediately.‚Äù



(**radio chatter)**



VA to listener

	(Calm) ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to set you down now, okay? I‚Äôll be gentle.‚Äù



VA internal monologue

	*‚ÄúHer breathing is awful‚Ä¶ One of her fractured ribs must have punctured a lung.‚Äù*



VA to listener

	‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to adjust your head to make it easier to breathe, okay?‚Äù



VA on radio

**(Roger beep from radio)**

(Annoyed) ‚ÄúWhy she won‚Äôt tell me a number does not matter! She‚Äôs getting worse by the minute.‚Äù



(**radio chatter)**



VA to listener

	‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to get you out of here soon, alright? The mission didn‚Äôt go as expected, but Sarg is coming to help us. I know this light is bright but I need to see what we are working with.‚Äù



VA internal monologue

	*(Horrified) ‚Äú... What did they do to her?‚Äù*



VA to listener

	‚ÄúI-I-I I need you to trust me enough to help you. I need you to know I would never do this to you.‚Äù



VA internal monologue

	*‚ÄúGet it together! But where do I even start? Her wounds are already covered in infections.‚Äù*



VA to listener

	(Seriously) ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to tell you everything I am going to do; no surprises.

¬†I‚Äôm going to start with wrapping this arm; these are the freshest wounds and I want to keep them clean. It needs to be tight, so it's going to hurt, but I need you to stay strong for me.‚Äù

	‚ÄúI need to check your cognitive function so I am going to ask you a few questions, okay?‚Äô

	‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù

	‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs L.‚Äù

	‚ÄúHow many sisters do you have?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. And brothers?‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you tell me their names?‚Äù

‚ÄúImpressive, I don‚Äôt think I could remember all six.‚Äù



Listener asks who the sergeant is



VA to listener

	(Surprised) ‚ÄúYou want to know who our sergeant is? Sergeant Jeffords, he got stationed about six months ago; you really don‚Äôt remember?‚Äù

	(Comforting) ‚ÄúNo, no, no, it‚Äôs okay; it‚Äôll come back to you.‚Äù

	(Blows out air) ‚ÄúThe rest of them I need to disinfect; this is going to hurt. You might want to take a nap, but you cannot right now, okay? We‚Äôre so close to getting out of here.‚Äù

	‚ÄúTake a deep breath‚Äù (takes a deep breath with her) ‚Äúand breathe out.‚Äù

	‚ÄúShhhhhhh, shhhhhhh, you‚Äôre okay, you‚Äôre okay.‚Äù

	‚ÄúI told you to stay awake, goddamnit! You‚Äôve done so well this far; don‚Äôt you dare give up on me now. I need you to stay here with me!‚Äù

(Pleading) I know I am asking a lot but you cannot scream; we‚Äôre still hiding, remember?‚Äù

	‚ÄúUhhhh‚Ä¶ Here! Bite this gauze.‚Äù



VA internal monologue

	*‚ÄúI forgot how tough she is; I can‚Äôt think of anyone else who could withstand this and not go into shock and I‚Äôm hardly halfway done with this arm. I‚Äôve got to keep her awake! Where is Sarg? Oh, she mentioned him. Maybe that will intrigue her. Fuck! Think of a story.‚Äù*



VA to listener

	(Fast) ‚ÄúYou used to hate him!‚Äù

	

Listener confused on what he is talking about



VA to listener

	(Frantically thinking) ‚ÄúJeffords, for the first three weeks, you said something about him ‚Äòtrying to hard.‚Äô‚Äù

	‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing so good, my trouble; keep holding on.‚Äù

	

VA can be internal or to listener

	*‚ÄúThink! Think!‚Äù*

(Ah ha exclamation) ‚ÄúFor example, he asked a PA to stay off her phone. You came to my office to make fun of him. You ran in, out of breath from laughing, tears in your eyes, doubled over, grasping your abdomen from how hard you were laughing.‚Äù (Small laugh) ‚ÄúHere I thought there was an emergency so I grabbed you and laid you down on a gurney and I started to cut your shirt off.

‚ÄúShhhhhh, shhhh, shhhh, it‚Äôs going to be okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat made you laugh even harder and made you puke coffee all over me. Which confused me even more so I tore the other half of your shirt off; it wasn‚Äôt until you held your thumb up and pushed me back that I got that you were laughing‚Äî‚Äù

	‚ÄúHey! Stay awake! That wasn‚Äôt a bedtime story.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, just a few more seconds. There you go. We‚Äôll take a break; we‚Äôll take a break. I just need to wrap your shoulder up, okay? There you go, breathe.‚Äù



Listener asks what was so funny about it.



VA to listener

	‚ÄúWhy were you laughing so hard? Oh, because the PA is always on her phone; it's sort of what she is known for. By the way, it was your favorite shirt‚Äù (small laugh), ‚Äúand we both had to dress in the lost and found for the rest of the day.‚Äù



Listener asks why that was a bad story.



VA to listener

	‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt bad; you just didn‚Äôt like that he was trying to.‚Äù (emphasis, kinda like you would say when you are using air-quotes) ‚Äú‚Äòbe controlling.‚Äô‚Äù



Listener asks what was wrong with him doing his job.



VA to listener

	‚ÄúYou knew it was his job, but you like to pick your battles. The PA is just as productive as any other and if she can do her job and text all day, you don‚Äôt see a problem with it.‚Äù



VA inner monologue

	*‚ÄúShe might as well be a stranger to me; I know she is in pain but she‚Äôs always been playful with me regardless. She‚Äôs asking questions about her own thought processes. It‚Äôs like they took all the life out of her.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúAt least she‚Äôs talking.‚Äù*

	

**(Sargent‚Äôs heavy footsteps)**

VA to listener

	‚ÄúHere he comes; we‚Äôre going to get you out of here, okay? I won‚Äôt let him hurt you, I promise.‚Äù



**(Several distinctive knocks that sound like a code that it is him; VA opens the door.)**



VA to the Sergeant

	(Relieved) ‚ÄúSergeant! Thank God! Carry her, but be careful; she has more broken bones than not.‚Äù



VA to listener

	‚ÄúI‚Äôm right here, okay? Let him do all the heavy lifting; all you have to do is stay awake, alright?‚Äù



**(VA and the sergeant start running out.)**



VA to the Sergeant

	‚ÄúI was only able to cover most of her right arm; she doesn‚Äôt remember you or me.‚Äù

	(Angry) ‚ÄúSupport her neck! She‚Äôs already struggling to breathe as it is.‚Äù

	‚ÄúMemory will likely come back; I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs from a head injury.‚Äù



VA to listener

	(Breathing heavier from running up the stairs) ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre so close to getting you out, my trouble; just hold on for a few more minutes.‚Äù



The sergeant explains brainwashing may have been a form of torture



VA to the Sergeant

	‚ÄúThey could have used brainwashing as a form of torture? That‚Äôs not really how the brain works.‚Äù



The sergeant says he has seen it before



**(A high-pitched ringing sound begins from the listener starting to pass out. It starts off quiet but gets louder and the following lines get quieter and more muffled but you can still make out what they are saying.**

VA to the Sergeant

	(Slightly scared) ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve seen it before?‚Äù¬†

(Angrily) ‚ÄúFuck, what did they do to her?‚Äù

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what‚Äôs called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what‚Äôs called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

Hello everyone. I‚Äôm from the USA but based in South Korea. Last Saturday after smoking some hookah with friends, I collapsed on the bus home and had a convulsive seizure. It lasted about fifteen seconds and I was good to go again. After I got home I called the emergency number, but they decided it wasn‚Äôt an emergency since I was already up and at ‚Äòem.

Since hospitals in Korea aren‚Äôt open Sundays, I had to wait until Monday to get checked out. During that time, I found it incredibly difficult sleep. Anytime I would start to falls asleep my body would jolt itself awake because (I‚Äôm assuming) I feared I would have another seizure. 

Finally on Monday I got to a neurologist. We did an EKG, EEG, autonomic nervous function test, blood tests, and he checked my carotid artery. EEG came out fine, blood tests were good, artery is fine, but the EKG and autonomic function test show I have brachyarrhythmia. I‚Äôm a pretty fit person, but he said my resting heart rate was below even marathon runners.

The doctor wanted to do a sleep study, give me a Holter monitor, and do an MRI. 

However, I had already planned and payed for a three week trip to Europe and was leaving in two days. He told me to make sure I sleep well, stay fed and hydrated, and don‚Äôt drink. I asked if coffee was fine and he said yes. He said he couldn‚Äôt diagnose anything unless and until I had a second seizure. 

Fast forward to today. The flight was fine, my first night in Germany was fine, and now I‚Äôm laying awake at 2:30am because each time I feel I‚Äôm about to fall asleep my body jolts me back awake again, just like before. I did have quite a bit of coffee early (7:00am) this morning with some folks in the hostel though. It might have been a dumb decision to not eat the $3000 I spent on the trip, but it wouldn‚Äôt be the first one I made recently. I‚Äôm just looking for advice going forward to curb my anxiety. The frankness of the post might not reflect it, but I‚Äôm genuinely more than scared. Thanks.

I'm looking to upgrade my home espresso machine, and the Elektra has been recommended. I want something that will not be temperamental, nor need too much idiosyncratic maintenance. I don't know too much about the brand but for $5000 is should be terrific.

It can be set up to turn on automatically each morning, and has volumetric programing, but I'm not sure it has a dual boiler.

I only make about 6 to 8 coffees a day, so production is not an issue.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts and assistance.

With their inherent advantage of dual-channel, multi-modal perception through ""vision + voice,"" smart glasses have already become the core platform for the next generation of intelligent experiences. As technology extends into complex scenarios like bustling coffee shops or brainstorming sessions at conferences, interaction pain points become increasingly prominent: hardware computing power can't keep up with algorithmic complexity, the device is easily activated by others by mistake, it's difficult to identify who is speaking, and noise cancellation is weak when capturing sound from a distance. At the same time, for visual Q&A and image translation, achieving high model accuracy with low transmission latency is the biggest challenge in implementation.

Multiple barriers lie between the technological ideal and user expectations. Breaking through these barriers is the key to unlocking the ""unprecedented experience"" of smart glasses.

https://preview.redd.it/clrk15xc1xef1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2aed5e2c3a02135a0a8b14f125c928eff79dfd4a

# 01. Hardware and Software Integration to Effectively Suppress False Wake-ups

When ""Xiao Ai"" is accidentally triggered by someone else, or when ambient noise interferes with the device's judgment, the user's need for a device that ""only listens to its owner"" becomes more pressing. The erroneous response of a smart device to a non-wearer's command is a persistent issue that plagues the user experience. Now, Xiaomi AI Glasses offer a practical and effective solution. Through the deep coupling of VPU (Voice Pickup Unit) hardware and the wake-up model, supplemented by the directional enhancement of a front-end Beamforming (BF) algorithm, a dual-layer ""acoustic shield"" is constructed, making smart interaction more precise.

# VPU Integration for Significantly Improved Voice Interaction Accuracy

Traditional microphone solutions often struggle in complex sound fields, failing to effectively separate ambient noise from the target voice. The introduction of a VPU marks a breakthrough. Its core advantage stems from the physical properties of bone conduction signals: sound is transmitted directly through cranial vibration, filtering out air-transmitted ambient noise at the source, retaining only the wearer's voice characteristics.

This ""pure extraction"" capability provides a unique hardware foundation for distinguishing between the ""master's voice"" and ""interfering sounds,"" as if equipping the device with an ""exclusive auditory filter."" In a convoluted and complex sound environment, the device can accurately capture the wearer's voice signal.

To improve the accuracy of the wearer's voice interaction, it is crucial to accurately distinguish the source of the voice signal when the user, wearing the Xiaomi AI Glasses, triggers ""Xiao Ai"" with a wake-word. However, hardware limitations prevent relying solely on the VPU to identify a non-wearer's voice, and using only a Mic array is also insufficient for effective differentiation.

So, how can the problem of identifying ""who is waking the device"" be solved? The R&D team adopted a targeted solution. First, they sought the optimal combination of features by analyzing and screening various voice characteristics to find the acoustic feature set that most effectively distinguishes between the wearer's and non-wearer's voices. Second, they used a method that combines frequency band analysis of the VPU with the coherence properties between the VPU and MICs. This enhances the ability to differentiate by using sub-band processing and coherence analysis, better suppressing non-wearer voice signals and ensuring that only the ""master's command"" is the trigger.

# Multi-Beamforming Technology for Precise, Directional Sound Pickup

The Beamforming (BF) algorithm, a core technology in audio signal processing, manipulates the signal phase and amplitude of a multi-microphone array to form a directional ""sound beam."" This enhances sound from the target direction while suppressing interference from other directions. In the Xiaomi AI Glasses, this algorithm is finely optimized for different scenarios in coordination with the VPU.

When the VPU signal is deeply integrated with the wake-up model, it can identify non-user wake-up commands in most scenarios through precise comparative analysis. This, combined with the BF algorithm's effective suppression of the intensity of non-wearer voices, builds a dual-layer ""anti-disturbance barrier"" for the user.

In addition to suppressing false wake-ups, the synergy between the BF algorithm and the VPU also solves the problem of sound pickup accuracy in complex scenarios‚Äîfor example, during simultaneous interpretation, how to clearly capture the other person's voice while filtering out one's own. In this scenario, since the wearer may need to communicate or ask questions during the translation process, the technology must accurately distinguish between the wearer's and non-wearer's voices, enhancing the external audio that needs to be translated while suppressing the wearer's speech. However, implementing this is difficult. Vibrations generated by the VPU during audio playback can affect judgment accuracy. Furthermore, a beam formed by just four microphones has limitations in beam width and attenuation‚Äîit can roughly cover only a 30-degree range with 15-20dB of attenuation, making it very difficult to achieve a beam that is narrow enough with sufficient attenuation (which needs to be greater than 40dB).

To address this, the R&D team's solution uses four microphones to form two beams. This allows the device to lock onto your command in a multi-person conversation, even if someone nearby says ""Xiao Ai."" If the other person is speaking from your side or behind you, their voice can also be picked up clearly, preventing missed words in translation. This ultimately achieves comprehensive suppression of the wearer's voice while enhancing the voice pickup of the non-wearer.

# 02. Low-Power Design for 8.6 Hours of All-Day Companionship

Battery life is crucial for smart wearable devices. Frequent charging not only increases the cost of use but also fragments the user's continuous experience. How can standby time be extended to reduce the problem of frequent charging?

Xiaomi AI Glasses adopt a low-power design combining hardware and software to effectively extend the device's standby time.

On the hardware level, the Xiaomi AI Glasses use the flagship Qualcomm AR1 as the main control chip, paired with a low-power Bluetooth audio processing chip, creating a ""dual-chip"" heterogeneous computing platform. Through intelligent task allocation, lightweight tasks that need to run continuously, such as real-time audio signal processing and voice wake-up monitoring, are handled independently by the low-power chip. This significantly reduces the power consumption of the device in a standby state and frees up ample computing resources for the main chip, ensuring it can stably support the smooth operation of multi-dimensional functions.

On the software level, the R&D team precisely compressed energy consumption by restructuring the on-device AI model to be more lightweight and by deeply optimizing the efficiency of audio processing algorithms, all while maintaining core recognition accuracy. Relying on this deeply optimized hardware-software synergy, the typical usage battery life of the Xiaomi AI Glasses reaches 8.6 hours, fully covering daily needs for commuting, office collaboration, and outdoor activities, effectively alleviating the user's ""battery anxiety.""

# 03. Empowered by a Multimodal Large Model to Create a ""Seamless Interaction"" Feature

After solving the issues of false wake-ups and battery life, enabling the device to ""understand the world"" and respond quickly becomes the key to breaking through the experience ceiling. This requires the device not only to have the ability to ""understand what it sees"" but also to achieve the efficiency of ""instant understanding"" in complex scenarios.

The R&D team's answer is to leverage Xiaomi's self-developed multimodal large model technology to break through functional boundaries and achieve an intelligent experience of ""what you see is what you get, what you ask is what you get answered.""

To achieve this goal, the inherent technical hurdles of smart glasses must first be overcome: high-definition image transmission has high latency, yet the performance of large models heavily depends on high-definition images, creating a ""speed vs. accuracy"" contradiction. Furthermore, the ""impossible triangle"" of computing power, latency, and accuracy is difficult to overcome with a purely on-device or cloud-based solution. Based on this, the R&D team designed a cloud-edge integrated image Q&A large model architecture specifically for the glasses, where different parts work together to solve the puzzle.

# On the Edge: Lightweight Model + Smart Cropping

A lightweight ROI (Region of Interest) detection model is deployed locally on the glasses. It performs complex calculations based on the user's intent, accurately crops the key area, and then transmits it to the cloud. The Bluetooth transmission latency is controlled to the hundred-millisecond level, meeting the need for instant feedback.

* **Key ROI Detection:** Using techniques like parameter reduction and model quantization, the model accurately identifies the user's area of interest with low computing power, balancing detection accuracy and resource consumption.
* **Intent-Based Smart Cropping:** Combining semantic understanding with the results of ROI detection, the cropping area is adaptively adjusted to remove redundant information and retain key content for transmission to the cloud. This ensures both transmission speed and lays the foundation for accurate Q&A from the cloud.

# On the Cloud: Trillion-Parameter Large Model for Precise Answers

After receiving the perceptual information from the edge device, the cloud-based large model, combined with the user's intent, calls upon multi-vertical, trillion-parameter multimodal large models for in-depth information analysis. It categorizes and answers the user's intent, enabling the user to directly ask about the scene they are seeing in natural language, achieving ""see it and ask about it"" smart interaction. The R&D team designed a multi-task learning model training solution that incorporates information from the edge device for this cloud-edge architecture.

* **Adaptive Enhancement Training with Edge Information:** By integrating edge information into the multimodal training data and designing targeted learning tasks, the model is trained to fully understand the edge information and automatically assess its reasonableness. This allows for the effective use of edge information while avoiding being misled by erroneous data.
* **Targeted Improvement Training for Difficult Images:** When training the visual encoder, difficult image samples such as blurry ones are introduced. Techniques like scaling and Gaussian blur are used to simulate challenging images from the edge device. The proportion of different difficult images is adjusted during training to enhance the large model's perceptual ability for such images.

This ""cloud-edge"" architecture not only overcomes hardware computing limitations but also achieves a balance between ""ultra-fast response + ultra-high accuracy."" Through this innovative technical architecture, smart glasses have transformed the concept of ""recognizing everything"" into a daily reality.

# AI Glasses Image Q&A: Core Scene Experiences

**Multimodal Translation/Reading: Wherever the Lens Goes, Language is No Barrier**

The AI smart glasses cleverly integrate OCR text recognition with a finger detection engine. In multimodal translation/reading scenarios, this achieves an interactive experience of ""lift your eyes to see the world, hear the answers in your ear."" When faced with a foreign language menu, the user only needs to issue a voice command like ""take a photo and translate."" The system will quickly and automatically complete the series of operations‚Äî""capture‚Üírecognize‚Üítranslate‚Üívoice broadcast""‚Äîproviding a real-time, accurate translation result and breaking down language and information barriers.

**Multimodal Scene Q&A: See Through the Mysteries of All Things at a Glance**

Want to quickly learn about an unfamiliar object? The AI glasses can recognize it at a glance. Relying on a database of millions of objects (covering vehicle models, plants, animals, electronic products, etc.), the AI glasses can achieve a recognition accuracy of over 95%, with support for real-time updates from the cloud. Whether encountering a rare sports car on the street or a peculiar flower in the park, the glasses can instantly provide an analysis, making ""everything is knowable"" a part of daily life.

From the precise interaction of ""only listening to the master"" to the ""8.6-hour"" battery life, and then to the intelligent experience of ""what you see is what you can ask,"" every technological breakthrough in the Xiaomi AI Glasses is a response to the user's deeper expectation for smart devices to be ""more understanding of their needs and more integrated into their lives.""

As smart devices evolve from ""functional tools"" to ""intimate assistants,"" the technical refinement in the details often determines the leap in experience. With hardware innovation as its foundation and algorithm optimization as its wings, the Xiaomi AI Glasses are accelerating the push of smart wearable devices toward their ideal form of ""natural interaction and seamless integration.""

If you're planning a visit from Boston, this guide will help you make the most of your time on the island.

I took a well-organized tour from Boston (booked here: https://athometouch.com/Martha-Vineyard) that made the whole experience stress-free. The journey starts early but it's worth it - you get picked up from your Boston hotel, take a comfortable bus ride to Cape Cod, and then catch a 45-minute ferry to the island.

Here's how I spent my day on Martha's Vineyard:

First Stop: Oak Bluffs
The famous Gingerbread Cottages were my first must-see. These colorful Victorian houses look like they're straight out of a fairy tale. There are over 300 of them in the Camp Meeting Association area. I spent about an hour walking around, taking photos, and learning about their history.

Mid-Morning: Edgartown
This is the island's most elegant town. The streets are lined with white-painted captain's houses and high-end boutiques. I grabbed coffee at Behind the Bookstore (locals swear by it) and walked down to the harbor. The Edgartown Lighthouse is worth checking out if you have time.

Lunch Break:
I used the discount card that came with the tour at one of the local seafood spots. Fresh lobster rolls are a must-try here. 

Afternoon Adventures:
I chose to take the optional island tour (totally worth the extra cost). It took us to places that would be hard to reach on your own in one day, like the Gay Head Cliffs and Aquinnah Lighthouse. The views are spectacular.

If you prefer to explore independently, you can:
- Rent a bike and ride along the coast
- Take the local bus (it's reliable and cheap)
- Rent a jeep to cover more ground
- Relax on State Beach between Oak Bluffs and Edgartown

Pro Tips:
- Wear comfortable walking shoes
- Bring a light jacket (it can get windy)
- Don't try to see everything - pick 2-3 main spots
- Book in advance during peak season (June-August)

The tour I took handles all the logistics - transport, ferry tickets, and timing. It's perfect if you want to avoid the hassle of planning everything yourself. You get about 6 hours on the island, which is enough time to get a good feel for the place.

From my experience, this day trip is ideal for anyone visiting Boston who wants to see one of New England's most beautiful islands. The tour I linked above regularly sells out, so I'd recommend booking ahead if you're interested.

One final tip: Have your camera ready on the ferry ride - the views of the coastline are amazing, and you might even spot some seals!",1,1753403588.0,TripWanderers,0,1.0,False

SPLASH.
Cue chaos. ‚òïüí•

Kira burst out laughing and accidentally dropped her script into the recycling bin. Penny gasped, ‚ÄúThat was majestic.‚Äù And Winfrey? Oh, she just sat there holding her notebook, blinking like a stunned owl, then wrote, ‚ÄúAmy‚Äôs Belly: Chaos Catalyst‚Äù at the top of the page.

Meanwhile, I was apologizing to the poor classmate whose pencils had been baptised in coffee. She was laughing too, thankfully, and said, ‚ÄúThat was the most entertaining rehearsal I‚Äôve ever witnessed.‚Äù

Even Mr. Holden, when he arrived (and sniffed his now-pencil-infused coffee), chuckled and said, ‚ÄúLet me guess‚Ä¶ early drama practice?‚Äù

I sheepishly nodded and mumbled, ‚ÄúMethod acting, sir‚Ä¶ with belly momentum.‚Äù

After that, the whole class was in a good mood. A few students even said they‚Äôre really looking forward to our performance next week.

And between you and me, diary, I think my belly‚Äôs going to become a local legend if it keeps making surprise appearances like this.

Anyway, lunchtime‚Äôs coming up and Penny says she brought snacks to share. Fingers crossed my belly doesn‚Äôt accidentally launch anything else today!

It feels like it‚Äôs easier to list off things my dad has done as he was overtly abusive, both physically and emotionally, but here it is:
- I was chubby as a kid and preteen, and I guess that made me appear curvy to both of my parents, but distinctly, I remember when I was 10 years old, I had woken up for school and was making coffee for my dad (as I had to, along with find him matching socks), and typically my dad would sleep on the couch, completely naked. Both my parents were abusive to one another, so it wasn‚Äôt unusual for him to be asleep on the couch. But while I was making coffee, my dad sat on dining chair (in the same place as the kitchen) and kept talking about how good I looked in my jeans. And he wouldn‚Äôt stop saying it. I remember him calling me ‚Äúbaby‚Äù in a way that didn‚Äôt feel right to me, even as a 10 year old. 
- around this age as well, I had to call my dad to pick me up from school because my shorts were ‚Äútoo short‚Äù and when he came to pick me up‚Äî-and I can‚Äôt remember exactly what he said‚Äî-but implied that I was dressed like a hooker (something he said to me before when I wore boots with a dress). Then he drove me to a house where his friend in construction was working and had me get out of his truck and spin around for his friend. I don‚Äôt know what the friend said, but I remember feeling really weird. Then my dad took me to an AA meeting (both my parents were recovering addicts, and both of my parents would take me to AA meetings almost every day.) and outside the building where the meetings were, he had me spin and then stand still while all of his friends talked about my shorts. I don‚Äôt know how long this lasted, but I never wore those shorts again. 
- when I started my period (also age 10, I don‚Äôt think this age is coincidental anymore. I think this is when I became aware that my father looked at me differently), I remember crying hard at night because I didn‚Äôt want my dad to be mad at me for getting my period. I had even cried to my mom that I was afraid that dad wouldn‚Äôt think of me as his little girl anymore. I don‚Äôt know where I got this idea. I know my dad didn‚Äôt look at me for several days after he found out I got my period. 
- when I was 12, my mom left my dad. I was alone most of the time and if I wasn‚Äôt, it was with my dad. I became the caretaker of both my father and house, despite not knowing how to. I distinctly remember cleaning the stovetop, and my dad came up from behind me, hugged me closely‚Äîhis pelvis on my rear‚Äîand he told me what a good wife I would become. I remember not moving and hoping that he would let go soon. 
- when I was 13, most of the physical abuse (in this context I‚Äôm talking about hitting) stopped. He was still verbally and emotionally abusive, but he stopped physically hurting me as punishment, until one night. I don‚Äôt know what I said or did to spark this reaction, but I remember I pissed him off and he was yelling at me, so I ran to my room. He barged inside and proceeded to flip me over on my bed and spank me over and over again. And he wouldn‚Äôt stop. At this point of time, my body was developing and it was even more noticeable than it was when I was 10. My ass got bigger, like my boobs. I remember the spanking not hurting as much as it used to and I remember after he left my room after minutes of spanking me, I cried a lot from shame, and I think, perhaps some form of arousal as during this time, I would some times watch porn on my phone. I remember masturbating and crying later that night because of shame. And to this day, I don‚Äôt really know how to cope with this memory. 
- I think around 13-14, my dad was sitting up‚Äî-I really don‚Äôt remember if it was his bed, my bed, or maybe a couch‚Äî-and I think I moved my leg and froze while my dad was talking to me. I felt the outline of his penis through the cargo shorts he was wearing. And he smiled. I don‚Äôt remember much. But I‚Äôve never told anyone about this besides my therapist and even then, I tried to push it off as soon as I mentioned it. Even now, I just don‚Äôt like it. 
- age 14, I don‚Äôt know why he did this, but I guess this could go for anything he did, I was lying on my bed, under the covers, and he came into my room, in a really good mood, and he placed one hand on my chest and the other directly over the mound of my vagina. I was clothed and still underneath the blanket, but I could still feel his hand and once again, I froze. He started to push me up and down on my bed. He may have done to me when I was a child. I don‚Äôt know. I thought maybe that‚Äôs why he did it, because he was in a good mood and wanted to do something he did when I was younger? I forced out laughs while he did it. I really fucking wanted him to stop. He only realized his hand was on my vagina until he was done. I don‚Äôt remember what happened to the blankets. And he apologized? And I felt like I had done something wrong because I could‚Äôve just told him. But I didn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know. These are some memories things I remember distinctly from him, even if some of the details are choppy. 

Moving onto my mom:
My mom would take me much longer to realize was incredibly abusive. She still is. While my dad would die when I was 16 (and by age 15, I would cut him off) from an aggressive form of cancer. I clung onto my mom who had entered back into my life at age 14. If it seems that I‚Äôm being vague about both of the physical and emotional abuse I faced at the hands of my mother and father, I don‚Äôt mean to be, just that it‚Äôs so much and I am still coping with all of this, even years after starting therapy. 
But here are distinct memories I have of my mother that I would like more clarification on the possibility of covert incest:
- at age 4, outside of an AA meeting, my mother told me about sex. The thing was, I knew what it was. I don‚Äôt know how and I‚Äôm frightened by that. I remember lying to her when she asked me, at age 4, if I knew what sex was. I gave her the answer of the storks and shit just to make her feel better because at some point, when she got to the part of penetration, she seemed‚Ä¶off? Scared? Disappointed? I don‚Äôt know. My mother has also faced a lot of sexual abuse in her life. I don‚Äôt think she had this conversation with me at the age of 4 because she wanted to know if anyone has or would do this me against my consent. As I get into more points, my mother is incredibly spiteful, especially towards me, her only daughter. 
- my mom would talk about her boobs a lot‚ÄîI think ever since I could remember, and she would tell me over and over again how I‚Äôm going to have big boobs like her. I don‚Äôt know why, I don‚Äôt know how I even got this in my head, especially as a really young child, but I would get really fucking scared. I mean, I would start yelling. I would scream ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù And she would laugh and taunt me over and over again. I don‚Äôt know if I formed a negative connotation with boobs because of something she told me or something else. I just know I hated it and this would ignite my mom to continue talking about my chest and eventual boobs from childhood to my teenage years. And the feelings of fear from childhood transformed into annoyance and discomfort when I became a teenager. 
- I think at age 9 when I started training bras, my mother would talk about my body, especially my budding breasts. If I wasn‚Äôt wearing the training bra, she would talk about how my breasts bounce and how it would trigger men. Then if I was wearing a training bra, she would snap my bra straps even when I asked her to stop, and she would make sexually charged comments about them‚Äî-how the boys are gonna love them. If they didn‚Äôt already. And like I was when I was younger, I would basically yell ‚Äústop!‚Äù Or ‚Äúno!‚Äù I think at some point she would imply that‚Äôs why I had a lot of boy friends? 
- my mother never had any respect for privacy and it was quite common for her to barge through my bedroom door. It didn‚Äôt matter what I was doing, changing or even masturbating, my mom would walk in even when I told her no or to give me a second. 
- throughout my life until the age of 10, my mom would take me everywhere with her. It didn‚Äôt matter if it was appropriate, like the AA meetings or if I wanted to. By the time I was 10, I started telling her no, I don‚Äôt want to go with her, especially with the AA meetings, which at the time, she went every day. She started to treat me so fucking bad after that. And because I didn‚Äôt know how to handle my feelings, I blamed myself. My mother also wouldn‚Äôt let me go outside. I was stuck indoors all day and if I snuck outside, she would punish me physically, like my dad. 
- my mom would not let me sleep in my own bed until I told her no at the age of 10. And I would sleep in there a few times after that to somehow mend our relationship. The same thing with showering together. I had stopped showering with my mom once I started growing pubic care, somewhere around 9-10 because my mom would comment on it. I didn‚Äôt want her to and I felt uncomfortable with her looking at my naked body. But did not stop my mom from trying to get me shower and sleep with her and walking in on me changing. Then she would make comments again and again. 
- my mom would frequently slap my ass as a kid and a teenager. I didn‚Äôt like it. I was spanked as punishment when I was a kid by both my parents. Sometimes it was with their hands. Sometimes with belts, a wooden paddle, hangers, or wires. I didn‚Äôt say no to when she would slap my ass (whether it was clothed or not) when I was a kid. It wasn‚Äôt until my teenage years that I told her no or to stop. 
- my mom would buy me bathing suits a size smaller than I was as a kid. I was a chubby child and despite my mother berating me for that, she would buy me bikinis that were too small for me. And then she would make me put it on for my dad, even when I told her I didn‚Äôt want to. He berated me as well, implying I was slutty or dressed like a hooker. I don‚Äôt know if my mother wanted to make feel embarrassed for my weight or if she implicitly knew that maybe the way my dad looked at me was not normal. I don‚Äôt know. 

- for the first 6-7 years of my life, my mom would call me ‚Äúmom.‚Äù Ex. If I asked a question, she would go ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, mom.‚Äù It‚Äôs confusing for me to type now as not only does she not remember this but because of the overlap between her sexualizing my body and using my younger self to support her emotional needs. I don‚Äôt know if she somehow viewed her own daughter as both a mom and a spouse, as my therapist and I have discussed the idea of her treating me as a pseudo spouse, especially during childhood. I think I am writing these points about my mom as both validation and as confirmation that maybe she did perform both of parentification and covert incest. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. 

-lastly, as I left the house and went to college, anytime I would come home, my mother would explicitly tell me about her sex life and the sexual traumas that she faced with a previous boyfriend. I didn‚Äôt ask for her to tell me this and I‚Äôm aware that this isn‚Äôt normal. But I did ask her to please wear a condom (as she kept going in graphic detail about yeast infections she kept getting). She has also accidentally sent me nude pictures of her. She didn‚Äôt realize until I texted What the actual fuck. While my mother does not purposefully walk in on me naked or masturbating anymore, she‚Äôs still the same. She barges in, disregards any boundaries I‚Äôve set in place and tries hard to get me to perform in the way I used to as a kid. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible for a possible covert incest relationship to perhaps diminish as I get older, or if the reason the symptoms of this possible relationship has been worn down by own strength of inputting boundaries and genuinely not letting her put me in uncomfortable situations anymore. I am still trying to find clarity on what exactly the relationship between me and my mother was when I was a child. I don‚Äôt know if these points fit into the definition of covert incest, but I would really appreciate input. 

Thank you for reading.

My clinician seems happy with my progress. I tolerate the meds really well with minimal side effects, and they work. They demonstrably work. My place is clean and tidy. The table is clear, the coffee table is clear. Laundry and dishes get done regularly. I empty the bins. I make my bed (I never made my bed before). I‚Äôve stopped snacking and am eating proper meals. Have given up alcohol because I simply don‚Äôt want it. 

No meltdowns, I can regulate my emotions now. Racing thoughts are absent in the daytime. I don‚Äôt interrupt people any more. I can sit still, which I never did before, and a lot of sensory issues I had have basically disappeared. 

But my QbCheck score barely shifted.

This has me a bit freaked out. When I did it as part of the pre assessment I hated the damned thing. I was crying after 10 minutes and trying to claw my face off after 15. This time I merely found it a bit tedious, although I was obviously making mistakes.

My clinician seemed unconcerned, as it‚Äôs pretty clear I‚Äôm getting a massive improvement in my quality of life. I‚Äôm wondering if this has happened to others though? Subjectively things are so much better, and I feel like the meds have given me my life back, but the evil red and blue shape CPT reckons very little has changed.

Stick to one task. I‚Äôve been doing timed sprints on just one thing, no distractions. Closing tabs and muting notifications help. Usually I‚Äôll say from now till X AM/PM I‚Äôm going to work on some particular thing. I end up having a bunch of these blocks during the day and I get a lot done.¬†

Clear space. A cluttered desk messes with my head so I try to keep things clutter free. I definitely notice a correlation between messiness and how frantic I feel.

To give every kingdom/republic/empire/trade union/city-state a ""fog of war"", so it can only be in contact with kingdoms that are already discovered and only if they have common sea/road etc, and only then they can actually send messages to each other. That would solve a problem of ""strange alliences"" and ""strange wars"" that occurs now when two civs that doesn't know about eachoter spontaneously ally/declare war on eachother.

# ‚õèÔ∏è New resource system ‚õèÔ∏è

To assign (or make player decide) finite resource to every biome and make kingdoms from one biome need resources from the other and some of them would do need it more desperately than the others

For example let's say we have one kingdom üéÉ in savanna biom, one in ü§† jungle and one in the üêß desert.

Hypothetical situation:

üéÉ produces wheat and beer, ü§† produces berries and coffee, üêß produces gold and spices.

üêß doesn't produce food, which means it has to import it, which means it has to either play the diplomacy with one of the kingdoms, or declare war on one of the kingdoms to gain the land that would be capable of producing food.

üéÉ Doesn't produce gold, which means it has to import it for the easier trade inside of itself (currency), and (let's say it's a big empire) it's subjects are quite fancy and they like a cuppa coffee every now and then and can't imagine their beers without masala (for some reason).

When subjects of üéÉ doesn't get what they want, they become reasonably upset and demand to overthrow the government (and possibly seize the means of production), so while ü§† and üêß has an option not to trade with üêß, it desperately needs their resources to keep afloat.

Notably, if there would be some fourth kingdom that could offer some of these resources, then ü§† and üêß would be weakened because of it, and it would be within their interest to declare war on the whatever country dared to invade their trade operations.

üêß would be harmed especially badly as without trade with üéÉ it would had no alternative but to trade with ü§†, which would lead to the monopoly on the resource, and ü§† would be able to export more of gold and spices out of üêß for less food, and then use same gold and spices to trade with üéÉ, and eventually get enough resources to fully conquer the üêß, or make it it's puppet.

# üí∞Influence of the map on the tradeüí∞

It's an Era of Ice and sea trades are frozen and some islands are now has to find out how to be self sufficient and balance of power drastically changes, as trade unions loses their power and influence and big governmental structures that seems more reliable gain power.

Or let's take mix with the previous example, there only üéÉ, ü§†, and üêß (E) (extra country).  
üéÉ is connected to üêß with a river that goes through (E) territories. Those territories are next to ü§† territories. ü§† Declares war on E and get's it's land, including the river. Then ü§† doesn't let through the ships from both sides, which gives ü§† economical advantage that we've discussed earlier.  
It would be an interesting decision because it would lead to military alliance between üêß and üéÉ to end economical exploitation.  
Just imagine having ""War for the end of an economical exploitation"", instead of ""War of blood"" that we have now.

That would be great if every war on the map would had a casus belli and a legitimate reason to attack. As for now they're just fighting for the land that might even be empty.

# üê´Trade routes and caravansüê´

Bandits now are just an aggressive mob and they have no structural purpose. With trade routes and caravans they would be a significant complication and cities would have to arm their caravans with legions/regiments/guards in order to secure safe trade.  
That also opens an opportunity for little bandit/pir–∞te civs located on the island for the sea trade and in the dens for the land trade. And then it opens even more opportunity for the big empires to negotiate with pir–∞te civs to hire corsairs.

Sea trade would also mean that we'd have to have more types of ships, some for transportation of goods, other for protection.  
And finally the roads.

I believe it'd be beneficial to differ those roads that are within cities, from those that are connecting the cities, from those that are connecting kingdoms.  
Each road would have 3 tiers of efficiency.

Towns and cities are responsible for the roads within itself, and they has to import resources from the other cities within kingdom to upgrade them.  
Roads between cities are the same as the roads in the capital, as it's federal/king's area of competence.  
And roads between kingdoms would also depend on the capital, but only within some reasonable range.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a whole house carbon water filter hinges on several key features that determine its performance and longevity. Understanding these technical specifications is essential for choosing the right system for your home.

**Filter Media Type and Capacity:** The type of carbon used and its capacity are crucial. Granular activated carbon (GAC) and carbon block filters are the most common. GAC is effective at removing a wide range of contaminants, while carbon block filters offer finer filtration and are better at removing smaller particles. The filter's capacity determines how long it will last before needing replacement, measured in gallons or months.

A High-capacity filter using coconut shell-based activated carbon offers superior adsorption properties. This type of media is extremely effective at removing chlorine, chloramine, volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), and other common water contaminants. Selecting a filter with sufficient capacity, typically measured in hundreds of thousands of gallons, ensures long-lasting performance and reduces the frequency of filter replacements. This is critical for those with larger households or high water usage.

**Flow Rate:** The flow rate indicates how quickly water can pass through the filter without significantly reducing water pressure. It's measured in gallons per minute (GPM). A low flow rate can result in noticeably weaker water pressure at faucets and showers, especially when multiple fixtures are in use simultaneously.

A Whole house carbon water filter should maintain adequate flow rate to meet your household's demands.Look for systems with a GPM rating appropriate for the number of bathrooms and appliances in your home.A higher GPM rating is preferable for larger homes or those with high water usage. Consider your peak water usage times to ensure the filter can handle the demand without compromising water pressure.

**Housing material and Construction:** The housing material needs to be durable and resistant to corrosion. Common materials include stainless steel and high-impact plastic. A robust and durable housing ensures the filter system can withstand pressure fluctuations and environmental conditions.

Stainless Steel housings provide superior corrosion resistance and longevity, especially in areas with harsh water conditions. High-impact plastic housings are a more cost-effective option that still provides adequate protection, but may not be as durable as stainless steel.Check for NSF certification to ensure the housing material is safe for potable water.

**Pre-Filtration and Sediment Removal:** Many whole house carbon filters include a pre-filter to remove sediment, rust, and other particulate matter. This extends the life of the carbon filter and protects it from clogging, increasing its overall effectiveness and longevity.

A Sediment pre-filter with a micron rating of 5 to 20 microns effectively captures larger particles,preventing them from prematurely clogging the carbon filter. This not only increases the lifespan of the carbon filter but also improves its ability to remove other contaminants. Regularly replacing the pre-filter is essential for maintaining optimal performance and protecting the main carbon filter.

Key features of whole house carbon water filters include:

*   High-capacity activated carbon for comprehensive contaminant removal
*   Adequate flow rate to maintain consistent water pressure
*   Durable housing material for long-lasting performance
*   Pre-filtration for sediment removal and extended filter life

## Core Benefits

A whole house carbon water filter provides numerous benefits,improving water quality and enhancing the overall living experience. These benefits extend beyond just drinking water, impacting various aspects of daily life.

**Improved Taste and odor:** Carbon filtration effectively removes chlorine, chloramine, and other organic compounds that cause unpleasant tastes and odors in water. This results in noticeably better-tasting and smelling water from every tap.

Enjoying cleaner-tasting water encourages better hydration and makes everyday tasks like cooking and brewing coffee more enjoyable.Removing chlorine and chloramine also eliminates the chemical taste that can linger after showering or washing your hands. This simple benefit can significantly improve your daily quality of life.

**Protection from Harmful Contaminants:** Carbon filters effectively remove a wide range of harmful contaminants, including lead, pesticides, herbicides, and VOCs. This protects your family from the potential health risks associated with these substances.

By filtering out these contaminants, you can reduce your exposure to harmful chemicals and heavy metals commonly found in municipal water supplies.This is especially important for households with young children or individuals with compromised immune systems. The peace of mind knowing your water is free from these contaminants is invaluable.

**Extended appliance Lifespan:** Filtered water reduces the buildup of scale and sediment in appliances like water heaters, washing machines, and dishwashers. This extends their lifespan and improves their efficiency, saving you money on repairs and replacements.

Scale buildup can significantly reduce the efficiency of water heaters and other appliances, leading to higher energy bills and premature failure. By preventing scale formation, a whole house carbon filter protects your investment in these appliances and ensures they operate at peak performance for longer.This provides long-term cost savings and reduces the hassle of appliance repairs and replacements.

**skin and hair Health:** Removing chlorine and other harsh chemicals from shower water can improve skin and hair health. Filtered water is gentler and less drying, reducing irritation and promoting healthier skin and hair.

Chlorine can strip away natural oils from skin and hair, leading to dryness, irritation, and damage.By using filtered water for showering and bathing, you can protect your skin and hair from these harmful effects, resulting in softer, more manageable hair and healthier, more hydrated skin. This is notably beneficial for individuals with sensitive skin or conditions like eczema.

## FAQs Section

addressing common questions about whole house carbon water filters can definitely help consumers make informed decisions. Here are some frequently asked questions and their answers.

**How frequently enough do I need to replace the filter?**

The replacement frequency depends on the filter's capacity,water usage,and water quality. Generally, a carbon filter should be replaced every 6 to 12 months, or sooner if you notice a decrease in water pressure or a change in taste or odor. Regular filter replacement is crucial for maintaining optimal performance and water quality.

**Is professional installation required?**

While some whole house carbon filters can be installed by homeowners with basic plumbing skills, professional installation is generally recommended, especially for those unfamiliar with plumbing. Professional installation ensures proper connections and avoids potential leaks or damage to your plumbing system.it also guarantees that the filter is installed according to manufacturer specifications, maximizing its effectiveness.

**Will a whole house carbon filter remove everything from my water?**

No, while carbon filters are highly effective at removing many contaminants, they do not remove everything. They are particularly good at removing chlorine, chloramine, sediment, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and other organic chemicals that cause taste and odor issues. However, they may not effectively remove certain heavy metals, minerals, or bacteria. For more comprehensive filtration, consider combining a carbon filter with other filtration methods, such as reverse osmosis or UV disinfection.

**What is the difference between granular activated carbon (GAC) and carbon block filters?**

Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) filters consist of loose granules of activated carbon, offering a large surface area for contaminant adsorption.They are effective at removing a wide range of contaminants, including chlorine, chloramine, and VOCs. Carbon block filters, conversely, are made from compressed carbon particles, providing finer filtration and better removal of smaller particles. Carbon block filters are generally more effective at removing lead, cysts, and other fine particulate matter. The choice between GAC and carbon block depends on the specific contaminants you want to remove from your water.

It's been a while, but I finally was able to catch up to the recent releases after a surprisingly fulfilling SAS (even if the scents were a bit hit or miss).  So, we did have one set released at the end of summer (well B&BW's timeline of seasons) and that was the Halloween set and then the releases that came out shortly after to kick of Fall releases!  Let's dive in!!



* **I Scream Float** (Fizzing Cola, Frightful Vanilla Float, Spooky Sugars) - Interesting to see them drop a cola scent for Halloween and considering we already have a vanilla scent that did come out for Halloween (Wicked Vanilla Woods), this is a bit of a brighter and slightly sweeter scent here.  I actually think they took the old 3-wick candle, Vanilla Cola Candy and turned it into body care and that's an interesting twist here.  I get a bit of the vanilla but a LOT of that citrus-y bite the cola usually tends to have.  Though it is a little light on me which is the only downside I feel like.  It's nice and super happy to see something like this show up, but needs more oomph to it.
* **Vanilla Cafe** (Smooth Espresso, Whipped Vanilla, Toasted Hazelnut) - FINALLY, we get a great warm coffee scent in body care with Vanilla Cafe!  It's smells rich, nutty, and deep.  My worry was that it was going to be another dupe of Vanilla Mocha Cafe/Vanilla Mocha Martini/Vanilla Mocha Cream but that scent smells a bit sweeter and the tonka bean stands out much more.  If anything, it's a much deeper version of Midnight Amber Glow with a stronger nutty note to it.  Definitely is my favorite coffee scent (though odd they released Espresso in the Wellness Collection at the same time, so it's kind of an odd decision).  Though this scent is a banger for me, great one!
* **Vanilla Ease** (Lavender Blooms, Creamy Vanilla, Soft Cedarwood) - Maybe it's just me, but I'm kind of exhausted from the lavender scents.  Especially the mix of lavender and vanilla as there's been quite a lot of them as of recent like Cozy Season, Cozy Sunday Morning, Lavender, and a few others.  They all share the common two notes, but this one actually kind of smells like a slightly sweeter Together Weather for whatever reason.  Still the lavender is a bit sharp for me and reminds of why I'm not the biggest fan of it, so this was not the best scent in the review...
* **Glazed Pumpkin** (Vanilla Glaze, Caramel Woods, Pumpkin Cream) - I mean besides the kind of boring name, Glazed Pumpkin is kind of a scent that I do like since it is quite a gourmand-y scent here.  It's funny because in ways it reminds me of Pumpkin Pecan Waffles, Pumpkin Swirl Cake, and even Pumpkin Cupcake, but like still manages to smell different because it doesn't have that UBER gourmand effect like PPW does, the toffee like PSC, or as sharp as Pumpkin Cupcake is.  It's a nice scent but I don't know...this is coming off as a basic scent to me for right now.
* **Book Loft** (Crisp Bergamot, Neroli, Cozy Woods) - Not technically a new scent, but new for body care, we get Book Loft whose debut last year was pretty noticeable if I remember correctly.  It smells really nice with the mixture of neroli and bergamot and the woods giving me a slight paper-y note to it?  Though on my skin, it does start to smell odd to me, maybe a bit too sharp and the citrus-y elements get thrown off (which I was expecting).  Definitely would like it as a room spray than actual body care IMO

  
**Fav to Least Fav:**

* Vanilla Cafe
* I Scream Float
* Glazed Pumpkin
* Book Loft
* Vanilla Ease

================================================

Getting into the Autumnal season, we did get one more surprise for Summer and that was the Summerween collection (which means the Halloween scents will be a part of the Summer review when I do the end of the year things).  Not surprised to see Vampire Blood, Ghoul Friend, and Wicked Vanilla Woods with the new scent I Scream Float (which wow, left Candy Apple Cauldron in the dust, though that came back in a few forms though).  

Then came the Vanilla collection which had the two new scents; Vanilla Cafe and Vanilla Ease paired with Vanilla Romance (which did not re-release as it was still being sold in stores and such and didn't get a new packaging).  It's not bad, but I'll probably end up forgetting about it (with the exception of Vanilla Cafe).  

Then there was the main collection of Fall 1 which is kind of getting through a few of the typical releases with Champagne Apple & Honey and Sweater Weather and two new scents in Glazed Pumpkin and Book Loft.  Also added was Sweet Cinnamon Pumpkin but for the 3rd straight year is an online exclusive.  Not a bad collection at least, but could've used maybe one more.  

Oh! and In the Stars got new packaging!

Am curious to see whats next for Fall 2!

maraschino cherries! so yummy, bright, and sweet. as it dried down i got more of the white florals. it does smell a bit like the one time i sampled TF lost cherry, so if you‚Äôre a cherry hater, this likely won‚Äôt convert you. i won‚Äôt be getting a larger size but it‚Äôs a fun, VERY sweet scent i could see wearing on a date or a night out.

**Alchemy of Desire: A scandalously sexy blend of sultry jasmine, gardenia, rose, heliotrope, carnation, rosewood, and musk. Please wear responsibly.**

i did not like this, which is a shame because i now have two 5ml bottles. i knew from the notes this wouldn‚Äôt be my thing. it‚Äôs very floral, very stereotypical ‚Äúold lady,‚Äù powdery and perfumey. i think i‚Äôll probably make a few sachets with one bottle and try the other bottle layered with caveau des innocents to deepen it. what do u guys layer with powdery florals? dirt maybe?

**Honored Ghosts: An offering of Earl Grey tea, black raspberry creams, rosewater-saffron syrup, cinnamon honey, white amber, and vanilla incense.**

the vanilla is pretty apparent, less earl grey than i wanted. a delicious non-foodie gourmand. it almost kind of smells like a lush product, but i can‚Äôt put my finger on which one. definitely not what i was expecting. delicious, soft, yummy, clean, but not something i‚Äôd full size.

**Silken Tent: Candied angelica, chrysanthemums, white flowering Nardo, clove flowers, jasmine-scented rice pudding, blonde caramel, infused with golden amber.**

i will be purchasing this in a larger size for SURE. a very creamy floral, not at all powdery, not too much vanilla to be cloying, and i think the amber deepens what could be a ‚Äúboring‚Äù flourmand wonderfully. very warm and ‚Äúgirly,‚Äù can pass for a (very good!) mainstream scent. i would wear this lightly on a first date or heavily for a nighttime activity. truly beautiful!

**Caveau des Innocents: The promise of erotic debauchery and elegant iniquity beckons... tabac, dark coffee, piquant cloves, rum soaked pears, candied citron, dark caramel, and star anise bathed in intoxicating swirls of opoponax, labdanum, hashish, benzoin resinoid, vanilla incense, and guaiac wood.**

very woody! when i first put this on i worried i over applied, but it faded pretty quickly. i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll be full sizing, but i‚Äôll use up the sample this autumn for sure during long study nights in the library so i can feel more cozy. i wish i had more to say about this one--maybe the more complex notes went over my head.

**Cidre d' Automne: Freshly pressed heirloom varietal fall apples delicately blended with subtle autumnal spices. Sweet, juicy, crisp and exquisitely mouth-watering.**

a very real apple! this one sits close to the skin. it‚Äôs not too sharp or artificial. my mother said it smells like cookies, which is probably how she interpreted the spices. i can see myself wearing this when i think i‚Äôll be in close quarters on a crisp autumn day.",8,1753402287.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

To give every kingdom/republic/empire/trade union/city-state a ""fog of war"", so it can only be in contact with kingdoms that are already discovered and only if they have common sea/road etc, and only then they can actually send messages to each other. That would solve a problem of ""strange alliences"" and ""strange wars"" that occurs now when two civs that doesn't know about eachoter spontaneously ally/declare war on eachother.  
If you're in favor of this feature, but don't feel like reading the rest, simply [support it with your vote](https://ideabox.featureupvote.com/suggestions/582911/advanced-economy-trade-routes-caravans).

# ‚õèÔ∏è New resource system ‚õèÔ∏è

To assign (or make player decide) finite resource to every biome and make kingdoms from one biome need resources from the other and some of them would do need it more desperately than the others

For example let's say we have one kingdom üéÉ in savanna biom, one in ü§† jungle and one in the üêß desert.

Hypothetical situation:

üéÉ produces wheat and beer, ü§† produces berries and coffee, üêß produces gold and spices.

üêß doesn't produce food, which means it has to import it, which means it has to either play the diplomacy with one of the kingdoms, or declare war on one of the kingdoms to gain the land that would be capable of producing food.

üéÉ Doesn't produce gold, which means it has to import it for the easier trade inside of itself (currency), and (let's say it's a big empire) it's subjects are quite fancy and they like a cuppa coffee every now and then and can't imagine their beers without masala (for some reason).

When subjects of üéÉ doesn't get what they want, they become reasonably upset and demand to overthrow the government (and possibly seize the means of production), so while ü§† and üêß has an option not to trade with üêß, it desperately needs their resources to keep afloat.

Notably, if there would be some fourth kingdom that could offer some of these resources, then ü§† and üêß would be weakened because of it, and it would be within their interest to declare war on the whatever country dared to invade their trade operations.

üêß would be harmed especially badly as without trade with üéÉ it would had no alternative but to trade with ü§†, which would lead to the monopoly on the resource, and ü§† would be able to export more of gold and spices out of üêß for less food, and then use same gold and spices to trade with üéÉ, and eventually get enough resources to fully conquer the üêß, or make it it's puppet.

# üí∞Influence of the map on the tradeüí∞

It's an Era of Ice and sea trades are frozen and some islands are now has to find out how to be self sufficient and balance of power drastically changes, as trade unions loses their power and influence and big governmental structures that seems more reliable gain power.

Or let's take mix with the previous example, there only üéÉ, ü§†, and üêß (E) (extra country).  
üéÉ is connected to üêß with a river that goes through (E) territories. Those territories are next to ü§† territories. ü§† Declares war on E and get's it's land, including the river. Then ü§† doesn't let through the ships from both sides, which gives ü§† economical advantage that we've discussed earlier.  
It would be an interesting decision because it would lead to military alliance between üêß and üéÉ to end economical exploitation.  
Just imagine having ""War for the end of an economical exploitation"", instead of ""War of blood"" that we have now.

That would be great if every war on the map would had a casus belli and a legitimate reason to attack. As for now they're just fighting for the land that might even be empty.

# üê´Trade routes and caravansüê´

Bandits now are just an aggressive mob and they have no structural purpose. With trade routes and caravans they would be a significant complication and cities would have to arm their caravans with legions/regiments/guards in order to secure safe trade.  
That also opens an opportunity for little bandit/pirate civs located on the island for the sea trade and in the dens for the land trade. And then it opens even more opportunity for the big empires to negotiate with pirate civs to hire corsairs.

Sea trade would also mean that we'd have to have more types of ships, some for transportation of goods, other for protection.  
And finally the roads.

I believe it'd be beneficial to differ those roads that are within cities, from those that are connecting the cities, from those that are connecting kingdoms.  
Each road would have 3 tiers of efficiency.

Towns and cities are responsible for the roads within itself, and they has to import resources from the other cities within kingdom to upgrade them.  
Roads between cities are the same as the roads in the capital, as it's federal/king's area of competence.  
And roads between kingdoms would also depend on the capital, but only within some reasonable range.

1m8km22,https://youtu.be/YS-utfO2PxE,4 Very Scary TRUE Rural Police Dispatch Horror Stories,"# ""Midnight Caller"":

I was at the station in Bronte, Texas, finishing paperwork on a quiet night. The clock showed just past midnight, when the phone rang, something in the dispatcher‚Äôs voice told me this wasn‚Äôt routine.

‚ÄúOfficer Daniels, we‚Äôve got a stranded motorist on Highway 277, a few miles south of town,‚Äù she said, her tone clipped. ‚ÄúSilver Ford F-150, out of gas. The driver made a 911 call, sounded real shaken up. Said he needs the cops, something about being in trouble. Can you head out?‚Äù

‚ÄúOn my way,‚Äù I said, grabbing my keys and heading to the patrol car. The night was dark, the kind where the stars seem to press down on you. Highway 277 stretches through empty fields and scrubland, with nothing but mesquite trees and the occasional jackrabbit to break the monotony. As I drove, my headlights carved a narrow path through the blackness, and I wondered what kind of trouble this guy was in.

Ten minutes later, I spotted the truck, its rear end jutting into the lane like it had rolled to a stop in a hurry. I pulled up behind it, flipped on my flashing lights, and stepped out. The air was still, heavy with the scent of dust and dry grass.

‚ÄúHello? Bronte Police Department. Anyone here?‚Äù I called, my voice echoing into the night. Nothing answered but the faint rustle of leaves. I shone my flashlight into the cab‚Äîempty. No keys, no driver, just a crumpled water bottle on the passenger seat. The fuel gauge needle sat firmly on empty, confirming the out-of-gas story.

I circled the truck, looking for signs of a crash or struggle, but everything seemed normal. Still, the 911 call nagged at me. Why did he need the cops? Was he hurt? Lost? I radioed dispatch. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm at the scene. Truck‚Äôs here, but no sign of the driver. Can you give me more on that 911 call?‚Äù

‚ÄúHold on, Daniels,‚Äù the dispatcher replied. A moment later, she played the recording over the radio. The voice was frantic, words tumbling over each other, distorted by bad reception. ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm in the middle of a field... we‚Äôre safe, we‚Äôre just pushing guys over... going towards Abilene on both sides... my truck ran out of gas... there‚Äôs one car here... a guy chased to the woods... please hurry.‚Äù

The operator tried to get him to repeat, but he cut in, voice rising. ‚ÄúThey will not talk things over. I accidentally ran into ‚Äôem.‚Äù Then, something about shooting the first guy, followed by a sharp sound that might‚Äôve been a gunshot. My pulse quickened. A shooting? Out here?

‚ÄúDispatch, did he say someone was shot?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what it sounds like,‚Äù she replied. ‚ÄúBe careful. We‚Äôre sending backup, but it‚Äôll be a bit. You‚Äôre out there alone for now.‚Äù

I gripped my flashlight tighter, scanning the darkness. The fields stretched out on both sides, dotted with clumps of trees and tall grass. If this guy was out there, finding him in the dark would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. And if there was a shooter, I was walking into who-knows-what.

Headlights appeared in the distance, and a pickup truck pulled up. A man stepped out, carrying a gas can. ‚ÄúEvening, officer. I‚Äôm Kyle Lawson. My brother Brandon called me, said he ran out of gas here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Officer Daniels,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYour brother‚Äôs not here. Truck‚Äôs empty.‚Äù

Kyle‚Äôs face tightened. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird. He called me maybe thirty minutes ago. Said he needed gas, and something about being chased. I thought he was messing around or maybe on something. He‚Äôs had issues before.‚Äù

‚ÄúChased? By who?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúHe said some guys, maybe Mexicans from the neighborhood, were after him. I asked if he was high, but he swore he wasn‚Äôt. He was heading to our dad‚Äôs place in Crowley, but it‚Äôs a long drive. I don‚Äôt know why he didn‚Äôt just find a gas station.‚Äù

I nodded, piecing it together. ‚ÄúHe called 911, sounded scared. Mentioned a field and someone chasing him. Did he say anything else to you?‚Äù

Kyle shook his head. ‚ÄúJust that he was in trouble. I grabbed the gas can and came straight here.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs look around,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúMaybe he‚Äôs nearby, looking for help.‚Äù

We started searching, calling out, ‚ÄúBrandon! It‚Äôs the police! Where are you?‚Äù The only reply was the wind whispering through the grass. Kyle‚Äôs flashlight beam danced across the field, catching the glint of a spider‚Äôs web or the eyes of some small animal.

After a few minutes, Kyle‚Äôs phone buzzed. He answered, hope in his voice. ‚ÄúBrandon?‚Äù His shoulders slumped. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs Ladessa, his girlfriend. She‚Äôs freaking out. Said Brandon tried calling her, but her phone was charging. She‚Äôs got no idea where he is.‚Äù

I radioed dispatch again. ‚ÄúAny chance you can trace his phone?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlready tried,‚Äù the dispatcher said. ‚ÄúNo signal. Either it‚Äôs off or out of range.‚Äù

Great. I turned to Kyle. ‚ÄúYou said he mentioned being chased. Did he sound like he was running?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, he was out of breath, like he was moving fast. Said he was in a field, bleeding a little, maybe from tripping or something.‚Äù

Bleeding? My stomach tightened. The 911 call‚Äôs mention of a gunshot echoed in my head. ‚ÄúWe need to check the fields. He might be hurt.‚Äù

We moved into the tall grass, the ground uneven underfoot. The darkness seemed to swallow the light from our flashlights, and every step felt like it could lead to a drop or a trap. I kept my hand near my holster, aware of how exposed we were. Highway 277 isn‚Äôt exactly a hotspot for crime, but you hear stories‚Äîdrug runners using backroads, drifters passing through. And Brandon had a warrant out for him, which might explain why he bolted when he saw my lights. But why call 911 if he was hiding from the law?

Kyle stopped suddenly. ‚ÄúYou hear that?‚Äù

I froze, listening. A faint murmur, like someone talking low, came from a cluster of trees ahead. ‚ÄúYeah. Stay close.‚Äù

We crept toward the sound, my heart thudding. The murmur grew clearer, but I couldn‚Äôt make out words. It was almost like someone was whispering to themselves.

‚ÄúBrandon? That you?‚Äù I called.

The sound cut off. Silence pressed in, heavier than before. We reached the trees, but there was nothing‚Äîno footprints, no broken branches, just shadows.

‚ÄúWind, maybe,‚Äù I said, but my voice lacked conviction. Kyle‚Äôs wide eyes told me he wasn‚Äôt buying it either.

We kept searching, moving deeper into the field. The grass scratched at my legs, and I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was watching us. Once, I thought I saw a shape move between the trees, but when I swung my flashlight, it was just a branch swaying. My nerves were frayed, the 911 call playing on a loop in my mind. ‚ÄúShot the first guy.‚Äù What did that mean? Was Brandon armed? Was someone else?

Backup arrived after what felt like forever‚Äîtwo officers from the next town over. ‚ÄúNo sign of him?‚Äù Officer Carter asked, stepping out of his car.

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHis brother‚Äôs here, says he was running from someone. The 911 call mentioned a possible shooting.‚Äù

Carter‚Äôs eyebrows shot up. ‚ÄúA shooting? Out here?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what it sounded like. We need to cover more ground.‚Äù

We fanned out, searching the fields and the edge of the woods. The darkness seemed to fight us, hiding anything that might‚Äôve been a clue. At one point, I stumbled over a root and nearly fell into a ditch, my flashlight beam catching the glint of something metallic. My breath caught, thinking it might be a weapon or a phone, but it was just an old beer can, rusted and forgotten.

Hours passed, and the sky began to lighten. We‚Äôd found nothing‚Äîno footprints, no blood, no sign of Brandon Lawson. Exhaustion weighed on us, and we had to call off the search until morning, when we could bring in dogs and volunteers.

  


# ""The Voice on the Line"":

It was April 9, 2004, a Friday evening. I was working the late shift at McDonald‚Äôs in Mount Washington, Kentucky. It‚Äôs a small town, and working at the local fast-food joint was just part of life here. The restaurant was bustling, as usual for a Friday night. Kids were flipping burgers, taking orders, and I was behind the counter, making sure everything ran smoothly.

Around 8:30 PM, the phone rang. I picked it up, expecting a customer complaint or maybe a delivery order.

‚ÄúMcDonald‚Äôs, this is Donna speaking. How can I help you?‚Äù

The voice on the other end was calm but firm, with an air of authority. ‚ÄúThis is Officer Scott from the Bullitt County Police Department. I need to speak with the manager on duty.‚Äù

Police? Here? ‚ÄúUh, that‚Äôs me, Donna Summers. Is there a problem, Officer?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam. We‚Äôve received a report of a theft at your location. A customer claims their purse was stolen, and we have reason to believe one of your employees might be involved.‚Äù

Theft? At my restaurant? ‚ÄúOh no, that‚Äôs terrible. Do you know which employee?‚Äù

The officer described a young woman‚Äîslightly built, with dark hair. My mind immediately went to Louise Ogborn. She was 18, had been working with us for a few months. Quiet girl, always on time, never caused any trouble. She fit the description.

‚ÄúI think it might be Louise,‚Äù I said, feeling a mix of relief and worry. Relief that it wasn‚Äôt one of the more experienced staff, worry because Louise was just a kid.

‚ÄúAlright, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù the officer continued. ‚ÄúI need you to detain her until we can get there. But since we‚Äôre short-staffed tonight, I need you to conduct a search first. It‚Äôs standard procedure in these cases.‚Äù

A search? Here? Now? ‚ÄúBut, Officer, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm allowed to do that. Shouldn‚Äôt you come and handle it?‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I understand your concern, but time is of the essence. The customer is very upset, and we need to recover the stolen property as soon as possible. I can guide you through the process over the phone.‚Äù

I hesitated. This didn‚Äôt feel right, but he was a police officer, right? He must know what he‚Äôs doing. My hands were sweaty as I gripped the phone. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll do it. What do I need to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúFirst, take Louise to a private area, like the office. Make sure no one else is around. Then, I need you to search her belongings and her person for the stolen items.‚Äù

‚ÄúHer person? You mean, like, pat her down?‚Äù

‚ÄúMore than that, ma‚Äôam. Since it‚Äôs a theft case, we need a thorough search. That might include asking her to remove her clothing.‚Äù

Remove her clothing? In my restaurant? With customers just outside? ‚ÄúBut, Officer, that seems‚Ä¶ invasive. Is that really necessary?‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I assure you, it‚Äôs standard procedure. We‚Äôve had cases like this before, and it‚Äôs important to follow protocol. Now, please, proceed with the search.‚Äù

I took a deep breath, my mind racing. Was this really how the police worked? I‚Äôd never dealt with anything like this before. ‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll get Louise.‚Äù

I called Louise over to the office, telling her there was a phone call for her. She looked confused but followed me. Once inside, I closed the door, the sound of the lock clicking louder than I expected.

‚ÄúLouise, there‚Äôs been a report of a theft, and the police think you might be involved.‚Äù

Her eyes widened, and she took a step back. ‚ÄúWhat? Me? I didn‚Äôt steal anything! I swear!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, Louise, but the officer needs us to search you. It‚Äôs just procedure.‚Äù

She looked scared now, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúSearch me? How?‚Äù

I relayed what the officer had said, my own voice shaking. ‚ÄúHe wants me to search your belongings and‚Ä¶ um, your person.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy person? You mean, like, strip search?‚Äù

I nodded, feeling my face flush with discomfort. ‚ÄúYes, I think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut, Donna, I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. This is crazy!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, but the officer says it‚Äôs important. Let‚Äôs just get this over with, okay?‚Äù

She reluctantly agreed, her hands fidgeting. I started by searching her bag, but found nothing‚Äîno purse, no money, nothing out of the ordinary. Then, the officer instructed me to have her remove her clothes.

‚ÄúLouise, I need you to take off your clothes. Fold them neatly and hand them to me.‚Äù

She started crying, her voice breaking. ‚ÄúDonna, please, I don‚Äôt want to do this.‚Äù

I felt terrible, my chest tightening. ‚ÄúLouise, it‚Äôs just for a few minutes. The police will be here soon, and they‚Äôll sort this out.‚Äù

She slowly began to undress, tears streaming down her face. I took her clothes‚Äîher uniform shirt, pants, and shoes‚Äîand, as instructed, placed them in a bag and took them to my car, locking them in the trunk. The walk to the parking lot felt endless, the bag heavy in my hands.

When I returned, Louise was standing there in just her underwear, shivering‚Äîboth from the cold and from fear. Her arms were wrapped around herself, trying to cover up.

The officer then told me to have her remove the rest of her clothing. I protested, my voice rising. ‚ÄúOfficer, isn‚Äôt this enough? She‚Äôs just a kid.‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, we need to be thorough. There could be small items hidden elsewhere.‚Äù

I sighed, feeling trapped. I told Louise to remove her bra and panties. She was now completely naked, covering herself with her hands, sobbing uncontrollably. I handed her an apron to cover up, but it barely helped.

The officer then asked if there was anyone else who could assist with the search, as it might be more appropriate for another female to be present.

I called in Kim Dockery, another assistant manager. Kim walked in and froze when she saw Louise naked in the office.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on, Donna?‚Äù she asked, her voice trembling.

I explained the situation, my words stumbling out. Kim looked as uncomfortable as I felt, her eyes darting between me and Louise. But the officer on the phone was persuasive, his voice steady and commanding, and we both proceeded to search Louise, following his instructions.

It got worse from there. The officer claimed that Louise might have hidden the stolen items internally and instructed us to perform a cavity search.

‚ÄúOfficer, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not right. We can‚Äôt do that.‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I understand your reluctance, but it‚Äôs necessary. If you don‚Äôt comply, you could be held liable for obstructing justice.‚Äù

I was torn. I didn‚Äôt want to do this, but I also didn‚Äôt want to get in trouble with the law. My mind was screaming that this was wrong, but the officer‚Äôs voice was so confident, so sure. Reluctantly, I agreed.

What followed was horrific. We were instructed to use a turkey baster and other items to search Louise‚Äôs body cavities. Louise was screaming, begging us to stop, her voice raw with panic. ‚ÄúPlease, Donna, I didn‚Äôt do anything! Make it stop!‚Äù

I wanted to stop, but the officer kept pushing, saying it was for her own good, that if we found the stolen items, she could clear her name. I felt like I was in a nightmare, unable to wake up.

Hours passed, and still, no real police showed up. Louise was exhausted, humiliated, and traumatized, curled up in the corner of the office, clutching the apron. Finally, Steve Maier, our maintenance worker, came into the office and saw what was happening.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on here?‚Äù he demanded, his face red with anger.

I tried to explain, my voice weak. ‚ÄúThe police‚Ä¶ they said we had to search her for stolen items.‚Äù

Steve wasn‚Äôt having it. ‚ÄúThis is wrong, Donna. You need to stop this right now.‚Äù

But the officer on the phone was still insisting that we continue. Steve grabbed the phone from me and started yelling at the caller. ‚ÄúWho is this? This is insane! I‚Äôm calling the real police!‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I realized something was terribly wrong. The caller hung up, and Steve dialed 911. Within minutes, real police officers arrived, their faces grim as they took in the scene. They took Louise to the hospital, and I was left to face the consequences of my actions.

In the days that followed, I learned that the caller was a prankster who had targeted numerous fast-food restaurants across the country with similar scams. His name was David Stewart, a prison guard from Florida, though he was never convicted. I felt sick to my stomach. How could I have been so gullible? How could I have allowed this to happen?

Louise sued McDonald‚Äôs, and rightfully so. She received a $6.1 million settlement, but no amount of money could erase what she went through. The trauma was etched into her eyes that night, and I‚Äôll never forget it.

As for me, I was fired, and rightfully so. I had failed in my duty to protect my employee. I had let fear and authority override my common sense.

Looking back, I wish I had questioned more, resisted more. But in that moment, I was just following orders, believing I was doing the right thing. I was wrong.

Sometimes, following orders can lead to the worst kind of horror.





# ""The Silence That Followed"":

It was a quiet night in the dispatch center, the kind where the silence feels heavy, broken only by the hum of computers and the occasional crackle of the radio. I was on the night shift, covering a rural county where houses are scattered miles apart, and help can feel like it‚Äôs a world away. The clock on the wall read 10:15 PM, and I was sipping my third cup of coffee, trying to stay alert.

The phone rang, sharp and sudden. I picked it up, my voice steady from years of practice. ‚Äú911, what‚Äôs your emergency?‚Äù

A woman‚Äôs voice came through, calm but edged with worry. ‚ÄúHi, my friend just cut himself really bad while chopping vegetables. There‚Äôs blood everywhere, and he‚Äôs holding his arm. I think he needs stitches or something.‚Äù

I leaned forward, fingers already typing. ‚ÄúIs he conscious? Is he breathing?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, he‚Äôs awake, but he‚Äôs in pain. I‚Äôve wrapped a towel around it, but it‚Äôs soaking through.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, stay calm. I‚Äôm sending an ambulance right now. What‚Äôs your address?‚Äù

‚Äú1234 Rural Road,‚Äù she said, her voice steadying as she focused on my questions.

I confirmed, ‚ÄúIs that correct? 1234 Rural Road?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe ambulance is on its way. It might take about 20 minutes since you‚Äôre a bit out. Can you keep pressure on the wound?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm doing that.‚Äù

‚ÄúTry to keep him calm and still. Don‚Äôt let him move around too much.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, thank you,‚Äù she said, and the line went quiet.

I dispatched the ambulance, noting the time and address in the system. Rural Road was out in the middle of nowhere, a winding stretch of gravel lined with dense woods. I‚Äôd handled calls like this before‚Äîaccidents happen, especially in kitchens‚Äîbut something about her tone stuck with me. It wasn‚Äôt panic, not yet, but there was a tremor, like she sensed something wasn‚Äôt quite right.

Fifteen minutes later, the phone rang again. Same number. My stomach tightened. I answered, ‚Äú911, what‚Äôs your emergency?‚Äù

Her voice was different now‚Äîhigh-pitched, frantic, like she was running out of air. ‚ÄúOh my God, he‚Äôs gone crazy! He grabbed the knife and started stabbing himself! Now he‚Äôs coming after me with it! Help!‚Äù

I heard her footsteps pounding, heavy and uneven, like she was sprinting across a wooden floor. Then a door slammed, and her breathing came in gasps. My heart raced, but I forced my voice to stay even. ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, where are you? Can you lock yourself in a room?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the bathroom! He‚Äôs outside, banging on the door! Please, send someone quickly!‚Äù

In the background, I heard a man‚Äôs voice‚Äîangry, slurred, shouting words I couldn‚Äôt make out. The banging was loud, rhythmic, like he was throwing his weight against the door. I pictured a flimsy lock, the kind that wouldn‚Äôt hold for long.

‚ÄúStay on the line with me,‚Äù I said, my fingers flying across the keyboard to alert the police. ‚ÄúThe police are on their way. Try to stay quiet and hide if you can.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying!‚Äù she whispered, her voice breaking. Then, a deafening crash‚Äîlike wood splintering‚Äîand she screamed, a sound so raw it made my skin crawl. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in! He‚Äôs in!‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, talk to me! Where are you now?‚Äù I shouted, but the line filled with chaos‚Äîgrunts, a scuffle, something heavy hitting the floor. Then silence. The call cut off.

My hands shook as I grabbed the radio. ‚ÄúAll units, critical situation at 1234 Rural Road. Possible assault with a deadly weapon. Suspect may be harming himself or others. Expedite response.‚Äù

I tried calling her back. The phone rang and rang, each unanswered tone like a punch to the gut. I stared at the screen, willing it to light up with her number again, but it stayed dark. The nearest police unit was 10 minutes out, maybe more on those winding roads. Ten minutes was an eternity when someone was fighting for their life.

I pictured her in that bathroom, barricaded behind a door that was no match for a man with a knife. I imagined the blood from his earlier cut, now mixed with something far worse. My job was to stay calm, to be the voice of reason, but inside, I was screaming.

The radio crackled. ‚ÄúDispatch, this is Officer Davis. We‚Äôre arriving on scene.‚Äù

‚ÄúCopy that, Davis. Be advised, possible armed subject and injured parties inside.‚Äù

The wait was torture. I kept replaying her scream, the crash of the door, the sudden silence. Had she gotten away? Was she hiding? Or was it too late?

Finally, Davis‚Äôs voice came through again. ‚ÄúDispatch, we have a male subject down in the living room with multiple stab wounds. He‚Äôs unresponsive. The female is in the bathroom, shaken but appears unharmed.‚Äù

I exhaled, my chest tight. ‚ÄúCopy that. Ambulance is en route; ETA 5 minutes.‚Äù

The ambulance arrived, but the man didn‚Äôt make it. They worked on him for as long as they could, but the wounds‚Äîdozens of them, they later said‚Äîwere too severe. The woman was taken to the hospital, physically okay but shattered by what she‚Äôd seen.

In the days that followed, I pieced together the story from the police reports. The man had a history of mental illness, and he‚Äôd stopped taking his medication. That night, something broke inside him. The cut from cooking wasn‚Äôt just an accident‚Äîit was the start of a spiral. He turned the knife on himself, then went after his friend, who barely escaped by locking herself in the bathroom. When he broke through, he collapsed, his body giving out from the self-inflicted wounds.

As a dispatcher, I‚Äôve heard a lot‚Äîcar accidents, domestic disputes, even the occasional prank call. But that night was different. It wasn‚Äôt just the violence; it was the helplessness of hearing it unfold, knowing I could only send help and pray it got there in time. Her screams still echo in my head sometimes, late at night when the dispatch center is quiet again.

This job teaches you to stay calm, to be the steady voice when everything else is falling apart. But it also shows you how fragile people are, how quickly a normal night can turn into a nightmare. I‚Äôm proud to do this work, to be there for people like that woman, but I‚Äôll never forget the fear in her voice‚Äîor the silence that followed.





# ""The Boy in the Box"":

It was February 25, 1957, a cold winter night in Philadelphia. I was working the night shift as a police dispatcher, sitting in the dimly lit dispatch center, surrounded by the hum of radios and the occasional crackle of static. The city was quiet, or so it seemed. I sipped my coffee, trying to stay alert through the long hours. The phone rang, breaking the stillness. I picked it up, expecting a routine call about a burglary or a drunk driver. But this call was different.

""Police department, what's your emergency?"" I said, my voice steady from years of practice.

There was a pause, then a young man‚Äôs voice, trembling and barely audible. ""I... I found something. It‚Äôs... it‚Äôs a body. A child‚Äôs body in a box.""

My stomach twisted. ""Where are you, sir?""

""I‚Äôm in the woods off Susquehanna Road. I was checking my rabbit traps, and I saw this box. I opened it, and... oh God, there‚Äôs a little boy inside. He‚Äôs dead.""

I scribbled the location on my notepad, my hand shaking slightly. ""Stay where you are, sir. Don‚Äôt touch anything. Officers are on their way.""

As I hung up, a wave of dread washed over me. Child deaths were rare, and this sounded particularly gruesome. I keyed the radio, my voice tight. ""All units, we have a possible homicide. Juvenile male found deceased in a cardboard box in the woods off Susquehanna Road. Proceed with caution.""

The officers arrived quickly and radioed back. ""Dispatch, we have a deceased juvenile male, approximately 4 to 6 years old, found in a cardboard box. He‚Äôs naked, wrapped in a blanket, multiple contusions visible. No identification on the body.""

I relayed the information to the sergeant, who ordered the crime scene unit and the medical examiner to the scene. The dispatch center buzzed with activity as more officers were sent to secure the area. My colleague, Tom, looked over at me, his face pale. ""What‚Äôs going on?""

""Child‚Äôs body found in a box in the woods,"" I said, my voice low.

Tom shook his head, his eyes wide. ""That‚Äôs bad. Real bad.""

As the night wore on, more details came in, each one more horrifying than the last. The boy had been severely beaten, his body covered in bruises. He was malnourished, his ribs protruding from his skin. His hair had been crudely cut, possibly after death, with clumps still clinging to his body. There were surgical scars on his ankle and groin, suggesting he had been in medical care at some point. The medical examiner later confirmed he had been beaten to death.

We didn‚Äôt know who he was. There were no missing children reports that matched his description. We started calling him ""The Boy in the Box."" His photo was distributed everywhere‚Äîflyers were posted on every street corner, included with gas bills, even mailed to every household in Philadelphia. The city was gripped by the case, but no one came forward to claim him.

The days that followed were chaotic. The phones rang constantly with tips, each one raising our hopes only to dash them. A woman called, claiming she had seen the boy playing in her neighborhood weeks earlier. ""He was with a man, tall, blond, maybe in his late twenties,"" she said. ""I thought they were family."" We followed up, but the lead went nowhere. Another caller swore he had sold a bassinet box like the one the boy was found in to a suspicious-looking customer. But that, too, led to a dead end.

The case became a mystery that haunted the department and the city. I remember overhearing two officers talking in the break room a week later. ""Who does that to a kid?"" one said, his voice thick with anger. ""Beats him, starves him, then dumps him like trash?""

""I don‚Äôt know,"" the other replied. ""But I can‚Äôt stop seeing that kid‚Äôs face.""

Weeks turned into months, and the case went cold. I retired a few years later, but the memory of that call never left me. Every now and then, I‚Äôd hear about new developments‚Äîa psychic claiming to know the boy‚Äôs identity, a woman confessing to knowing something about the case‚Äîbut nothing ever brought us closer to the truth.

Then, in 2022, I heard the news on the radio. After 65 years, they had finally identified him. His name was Joseph Augustus Zarelli. He was four years old when he died. DNA technology had cracked the case, tracing his relatives through genealogical databases. They found his family, but the mystery of who killed him remained unsolved.

I still think about that night, the call that started it all. The image of that little boy, alone in a box, abandoned in the woods, is burned into my mind. I hope that one day, the truth about who killed Joseph will come to light, and he can finally rest in peace.

(Part 1),"I swing the shovel down for a final time, officially flattening the dirt. I sledged the cross into the head of the grave. I took a step back, unable to acknowledge my handiwork due to the blurriness of tears coming on. I made sure the grave was facing South so that he could see both the sunrises and the sunsets. ""I love you, Ash."" I managed to say to the desolate patch. I hope his journey is easy.

Turning away while picking up the spade, shovel, and sledgehammer, I load them onto the back of the four-wheeler and head back down the wavy hill. It's weird to think that outside will now be his permanent home, given he has only run out a handful of times. The five-minute descent dragged like hours.

The evening sun danced through the trees on my right like someone had covered the sky with a fishnet. The Four-Wheeler tore through the calmness of the farm as I pulled into the garage out back. I left the tools and the gas can bungee-corded to the rack on the back of the ride, convincing myself that I'd be saving time by not putting them back where they belonged, but in reality, I didn't want to put the effort in. Inputting the code and letting the garage door shut behind me, I just barely tilt my head to see the little site at the top of the hill.¬†

My brain mentally snaps a picture of the scene. The fog of memory turns the vision into a watercolor smear. A streaked green hill, orange-red evening sun, the tiniest blotch of light brown that gradients to the dark brown beneath it, and behind that, the ever-expanding deep green woods that go just beyond the ridgeline. The ridgeline that gives it its pronounced shape on the land of Eastern Kentucky.

My stomach grumbles, reminding me that I'm still alive and there are still things that need to be done. The front door opens just enough for me to step through, my open hand down by the ground, ready to catch any futile attempt to get out. He has always wanted to go outside, darting at the door every chance he gets. I never let him, it posed far too much of a risk with him running off into the wilderness, and me unable to catch him. But he's not there to express his cravings for the outdoors. There is no longer a greeting when entering this home.¬†

While the air fryer ticks, I latch onto meaningless thoughts, tomorrow's shift, my chores, anything but reality. Oh yeah, that's something I can put my mind to. In the stillness of the dining room, I had to take some time to clear my thoughts before actually starting to type on my phone.¬†

* Do dishes
* Sweep and mop the kitchen
* Clean out the litterb-

The beeping of the air fryer interrupted my typing. I get up, empty my chicken onto my plate, and sit down to eat.¬†

I ate in peace. No little paws batting at the edges of my plate. No meows begging for food. Just the occasional sound of chewing. There's a lingering feeling of misplacement in my mind. Things just are not right. The never-ending feeling of anticipation to see a gray streak run through the house tricks my eyes. This stuff has its unique way of making a permanent home in your brain. Just a monkey brain with pattern recognition. Unfortunately, the patterns I failed to consciously take note of before today are coming back to harass my peripherals. I just still feel like he is still around, maybe just under the table, imagining my legs as his very own scratching post. Why would God allow this?

¬†I gift the sink my plate as I start my nightly routine, cutting my evening short. Brush my teeth, turn on the fan, and open the canned wet food for Ash. I hope it's empty by tomorrow morning. I hope I wake up with barely any breath in my lungs from him loafing on my chest. I pull the blanket over me and begin to hold my knees as close to me as I can. The chore list, going unfinished and unanswered, as does the can of wet food.

*I dreamed I was walking along the beach with*

*the Lord. Scenes from my life flashed across the sky. In*

*each, I noticed divots in the sand. Sometimes there were*

*Divots and footprints; other times, there were only divots.*

*During the low periods of my life, I could see only the divots,*

*so I said, ""You promised me, Lord, that you would*

*walk with me always. Why, when I have needed you most,*

*have you not been there for me?""*

*The Lord replied, ""The times when you have seen only the divots,*

*My child, is when I carried you.""*

*The Lord and I reached the end of our beach,*

*Arriving at my bedroom door.*

*The door rips through its cheap wooden trim.*

*The cross hanging on the door falls to the floor.*¬†

*We then turn to see me lying on the bed.*

*Sound asleep, unaware of the lord's palpi.*

I got up to my alarm, not to the usual headbutting of an attention-seeking companion. My face stuck to the damp pillow as I attempted to rise out from the comforter. Hopping out of bed onto the cold wooden floor, my feet hit with an almost silent meaty slap. ""Oh, good god,"" I muttered. The door's destroyed. Maybe I did it in my sleep. I've been stressed, but not like this. I finally remember my dream.

Upon the memory coming back, I check the entire house for a break-in just in case. Nothing. Jesus, the stress must be getting to me. I can't believe I would do that in my sleep. Sure, I've broken things before by being dumb and putting too much strength into it, but this is a new level. I made a silent agreement with myself that I would fix it when I got home, and I began to get ready for work. But upon grabbing my clothes out of my dresser, I stepped on the same cross that had fallen from the door. Rather than picking it up, I scooted it under the dresser with my feet. Sliding the symbol that used to resonate with me away into darkness as if it were a spent torch.

I hung that cross up originally when I was an avid churchgoer. I did all the things a Christian should: follow the word, spread the gospel, and treat everyone neighborly. Over time, though, shortly after getting saved, I lost my will to commit to it. I came to enjoy life more, and religion went onto the back burner.¬†

I finally got to work, and upon walking through the gate, I heard someone behind me say, ""Waddup, Eli."" I knew the voice immediately, along with who he was speaking to. I turned to see Chantz. Chantz is my lifelong friend whom I work with on a team. He is a little taller than I, with shoulder-length brown hair and a scruffy beard. Built more muscular than I am, he stands broadly before me, waiting for my response.

""Hello,"" I say in a cheery tone, yet I could feel the word lacking substance as it came out. I knew he could tell I was feeling different, and that look he gave me was a sign of what I knew he was about to ask. But before he even got the opportunity, I took hold of the conversation. ""Man, I am just not feeling this place today, but hey, I'm here.""

""I feel you, I almost called off but decided fuck it, might as well come in."" He said in his normal tone. Thank god he didn't pry anymore, crisis averted. I don't even want to think about yesterday; I simply want to go into autopilot and let my emotions dwindle.

The rest of the workday went as normal. I unloaded the trucks and got to leave at a decent time once all of the work was done. When walking outside, I was hit with the sun right in my face, causing my eyes to painfully contract. Once they got used to the outdoors, I realized that Chantz was standing next to where we usually park. Walking over and unlocking my car, I heard him ask me a question.

""Wanna hang out?""¬†

""Nah, not today, I still don't feel the best.""

""Alright then, I'll talk to you later, be safe."" He said as his car shifted into drive.

""You too."" I rolled up my window and began the journey home. Almost like a switch flipping, I felt the tears coming as I turned out of the parking lot. Though I didn't want to be a random dude crying his eyes out while driving, as traffic in the opposite lane could see me. I locked my face into place. I was back to normal. It hurts knowing I wasn't going home to him.. I pulled into the farm, I call it a farm despite having no animals other than him, as I'm allergic to everything. I simply built an immunity to Ash.

I went inside and walked to my room to put my phone on charge. I dove onto the unmade bed and connected my device to the wall. Chantz had already messaged me, asking if I got home safely. I told him I did, and he followed up with a simple ""Good."" I spend a lot of time just mindlessly scrolling on the phone when my stomach screams for nourishment.

""I guess I could get something to eat,"" I said to no one as I got up. Then I turned and saw it, which resulted in my heart feeling like it was being pulled apart. The wet food can was still full. Not even a single lick of the liquid was gone from it. Throughout last night and a good part of the day, I assumed he would end up eating his whole can of wet food. Ash didn‚Äôt continue our routine. Usually, when he finished, it would sit on the floor just next to where I slept. He'd sometimes even push it so far that it would end up under the bed. I always imagined it was his way of saying, ""I'm all done, another please!"" I got reminded of his fate all over again.

The air fryer still has residue from the chicken, so I instead opted for a can of Soup. The hill he's lying on top of is just barely in view through the large window in the same room as I. I only took a couple of bites before throwing the rest of the freshly made food away. The plate from yesterday gained a new roommate as I reassured myself that it can wait another day.

I did my nightly routine, brushed my teeth, turned on the fan, and stopped myself from grabbing another can of cat food. Lying down, I tried to force myself to sleep by replaying the memories of him jumping on the bed and joining me for slumber. With the bedroom circulating the air of the room temperature meat, I fell asleep.¬†

*Ash and I were sitting in church. The same Church I have always gone to. They must have changed it in the last couple of years since I've stopped going. They have gone for a more naturalistic design. We were in the fourth pew back from the front, and he was lying on my lap. Everyone, including me, was dressed in normal Church attire. At the head of the church, a preacher stood in front of the Altar rather than behind. The Preacher had a smooth yet covered face. It wasn‚Äôt smooth like baby skin, but as in a face that represented sanded wood that had fallen in honey. No eyes, no mouth, only a smaller-than-usual nose rested upon his head. With a wave of his hand, a gramophone started playing a sermon. The words of the sermon were lost on my ears as the gramophone did not speak, rather it portrayed. I felt the feeling of fear along with faith being intertwined in my soul when the record started spinning. Followed by a forceful mixture of anger and joy. These four emotions were tossed into the blender of my body and forced to coincide in a holy union. Once the emotions reached their homeostasis, the urge to pay attention to the preacher was overwhelming. All of the faces around me, all of whom I did not recognize, looked at the man up front, and I followed suit.*¬†

*He held his hands above his head to praise the awesome and righteous lord above. In his hands appeared a black and white yin and yang symbol that went from a concept to a physical disk in his hand. I then realized that it was the vinyl record that had been playing on the gramophone. He broke it into two pieces, both halves of the opposite color. The white piece matched his robes, while the black piece matched the altar behind him. In unison, we all lift our hands, palms out, towards the man, and we are all granted our own piece of the cruel and the compassionate. The black half sank into my left palm, not as a gift, but as a hot knife sat on top of cold butter. The white half floated just out of my right palm, never obtainable, no matter how far you reached.*¬†

*The preacher held the white piece towards the sky as an offering to god, who partook in all of our compassionate halves. The only thing keeping us from being evacuated upwards was the tendrils that extended from under the preacher's outfit, branching throughout the underbelly of the pews. That wrapped around our ankles like a professional arm wrestler. We avoided gazing upon the face of the holiest of holies, so we bowed our heads, still keeping our eyes open. Ash did not. He looked directly at the Alpha and the Omega, and as a result, he went still. My lap gained frostbite from how cold he fell. He was no more. God had looked upon all he had gained, and behold, it was very good.*

*I feel the corruption of the black half has been cleansed. It contained new life. A new story. A new beginning. Everyone followed the preacher's movements as the black half was pushed into our chests with our palms, thus returning us to The Great Shepherd's flock that we have strayed so far from. God's presence disappeared, as did the preachers. I felt the frostbite fade as heat returned to my friend. We have been united through God's will and our faithfulness. Ash purred in my lap. It was very good, for all things were created through Him and for Him. On the front of the altar, hung a crucifix that was recently hidden by the ophidian-like body of the leader of this ceremony. Jesus, fixed to the cross, has nails driven into only four out of his thirteen tentacles. His gaze did not break from the floor, and his gelatinous chest was still breathing.*

I didn't go to work today. It feels as if my motivation is a well that has been drained. Despite that, I still pushed forward to get out of bed. I must have had an allergic reaction to something while I was sleeping. My arm was covered in circular, rashy blotches. They were in groupings of an overly tall triangle, starting with big circles at the bottom and smaller circles at the top. They wrapped and swirled around my arm as if someone had hit me with one of those arm bracelets in school. The thought of being in this room for any longer is nauseating. I should really throw that can away, but the chance that he comes back to the smell of his favorite meaty nutrients overrides my disgust.

""I guess it's time to fix you,"" I say while looking at the busted door frame. I walk out to my garage out back and glance up at the hill. I make my best attempt to ignore the emotions bubbling inside. In the garage, I grab a bag of tools that should have a nail gun and some other handy stuff in it, and head back inside. I get to my bedroom door, drop down on the floor, and start digging through the toolbag. A ball-peen hammer, a box cutter, and finally, the nail gun wrapped in rope. Unwinding the rope, my face frowned as the heavy tool I handled was not a nail gun; rather, it was an air stapler. A sigh left my mouth as I placed the tool back into the bag and made a mental note to go back to the garage later to get the right one.

Everything's just been so blurry, so unimportant. I'm moving through a mental fog that I can't even see my own outstretched arm in. I need to snap back into it. I need something to change. So I call Chantz. We agreed to meet up and talk about some stuff at the gym. I didn't intend to work out, just going to get some things off my chest. Time to get ready.

When I arrived, he was sitting in his car. I knocked on his window to get his attention, which made him jump a mile out of his seat.

""Oh, brother, I'm so sorry I scared you.""

""It's all good, man,"" Chantz said as he regained his composure, ""what're you gonna work out today?""

""I'm actually not gonna do anything, I'm really only here to hang out and try to get through the funk that's got a grip on me.""

""Well, come inside and we‚Äôll talk about it,"" He said inquisitively. Once inside I told him, I told him all of it. I did a good job of saying everything matter-of-factly rather than letting the sobs consume my vocal cords. He was astonished, ""Why would you still plan on coming to work, you psychopath, take some PTO or something.""

He's right, I make it a point to never use my PTO, just letting it cash out at the end of the fiscal year. I ended the explanation by saying, ""The house is just so empty now, I feel like I'm being driven mad.""

""I don't know if this is the right time to offer you anything, but I'll just throw this out there. My sister's cat just had a litter of kittens not too long ago; she gave all of them away except one. She was planning on keeping the cat, but her husband is strict on their house being a one-pet household. Would you like it?""

His offer pinged in my head as if I just peeked out of a trench in World War 2. It feels almost disrespectful to offer a replacement for my friend this soon. Still taken aback by his offer, he continued.

""Or maybe you could just keep it for a little while? Just give her a bit of time to convince him, ya know? Kind of like a temporary home. I know you are a good pet owner, so I figured you would be the best person for it. Feel free to say no, though.""

I was contemplating my decision, meanwhile, Chantz had already started to text his sister asking for details about the cat. Before I could get another word out, he introduced me to the feline through his phone. ""His name is Savior.""¬†

""Sure, I'll home him.""

We agreed that I would follow him back to his sister's house to pick up the little one. Luckily, his sister is on my way home, so it's no big deal for me. I brought up the dream about the preacher to him, and he responded with an astonished laugh.

""Jesus dude, I didn't know you had such deep dreams. Mine usually consists of people in my life who have never met each other doing crazy stuff."" He smiles as he puts his gym bag in the locker.

""Do you believe God can talk to us like that?"" Upon hearing myself, I cringed; I sounded like a child.

""I don't think God is here anymore. I don't know how everything was created, but if he created a messed-up world like this one, I'd run away from it too.""¬†

Chantz and I have always been on opposite sides of religion. Despite us both growing up in religious households, my faith had lingered, while he viewed his as a burden. I quickly change the subject and we continue to talk between his sets of working out. The rest of the hangout was just a little blip in my mind, not significant enough to place in the timeline of my memory. Before I knew it, I was driving home. A little black and white replacement lying asleep on my thighs, causing my nose to run.

Opening the door with my hand leading in front of my feet, there was no resistance. My other hand contains the cat. He's cute as hell, but he isn't Ash. I show him around to his amenities, his food, and his litterbox. Right before sneezing, I sit him on the floor, free to explore his temporary residence. He immediately goes to the scratching post and digs his nails into it. Into Ash's scratching post. Resentment enters my system like a foreign body.

I needed something to calm me down, so I began to dig around in the closets. The first closet in the hallway had nothing but old vacation bible school drawings and crafts. The second closet had my college art supplies, which I knew for a fact had smokes in them. Back then, I couldn't be more stereotypical with smoking cigarettes and talking about the deeper meaning of the arts. I grab my pack of deteriorated cigarettes and head onto the back porch. Inside the pack, a black lighter is concealed. Sitting down in the chair, I flick the lighter on. I feel the tar attach to my lungs, and the nicotine puts some ease on my brain.

Some time goes by, I'm not sure how much though. Although I love the outdoors, it's getting close to evening, and I see a thunderstorm is on its way. Plus, I got an idea for an activity indoors. I went back to the closet, grabbed the art supplies, and sat down in the living room. The art supplies took up most of the coffee table, mostly pencils, sketch papers, and paint. Looking through my old drawings of mutilated monsters and other freaky things inspired me to pick up the pencil again. This time it wasn't to make scary stuff, but to print out a memory that had been ingrained into me onto the paper. I began to sketch the hillside, the sunset, the ridgeline, and the grave onto the blank paper.

When all was done, it looked decent, of course. Where it was a sketch, it looked a little all over the place, but it was good nonetheless. By the time I was finished, I looked up at the TV, which had stopped playing whatever music I had on. Instead, it was on the idle slideshow screen. Simply showing pictured memories, waiting for the remote to be interacted with again. I leaned back into the couch, causing the leather to rub together to make its unique noise, and enjoyed the memories.¬†

Then I see the first-ever picture I took of him. My stream of emotions runs easily with the serenity of Nostalgia, before being traumatically contaminated. From an innocent kitten covered in fleas and dirt, to my rambunctious, cuddly, and always curious friend. My friend, who had just days prior been resting still in the corner of the couch, waiting to be discovered, the fire of his soul already extinguished.¬†

Despair had ruined my evening. The sulking was combined with the sadness, which resulted in me relapsing back to just sitting there thinking. Wait, no, I'm not going to think, I'm going to do something to get my mind off things. I walk outside to take in the outdoor air. The lightning just lit up the living room as the storm was raging. I let the rain hit me as the humidity began to wage a war with the smog in my lungs from earlier.¬†

I wonder how Ash is doing. I mean, I wonder what he is going through. Is he just experiencing some kind of afterlife, or is he actually gone? Thinking about that, I remember my dream from last night. Can faith bring him back, or was that just another stress dream? Either way, I cast away any doubt I had about believing. Still drenched, I shifted to the couch just inside the door. Down on my knees, my elbows dug into the faux leather, making an imprint of my pleading pose. I prayed with all the faith I could muster up.

""God, my best friend had left a couple of days ago, and I'm just asking you to do something for me. Please watch over him and his journey to wherever he is heading. I'm not sure what type of afterlife he goes to, but please just allow him to get there safely and happily. God, if you‚Äôre feeling generous, I‚Äôd be willing to do anything to be reunited¬† with him again.""

My prayer was cut short by the instant drop in temperature. The air turned frigid, but my body turned into a furnace. It was as if boiling water was tossed into a snowstorm where I sat. I unwaveringly kept my eyes shut until I felt more than just the cold. I felt arms. The arms wrapped around me from behind as if a lover was begging a soulmate not to leave. The arms didn't even fully touch me. It felt like the goal of the hug was to show support to the peach fuzz on my body rather than my skin. The cold air hurt my nose as an aroma of a clean, floral scent submerged that sense. I felt‚Ä¶ Faith. As if my prayer did something. I realized what was happening, and fear overwhelmed the Faith. I spun around with my eyes shooting open, along with my fist gaining the torque of my torso, yet the fist never landed on a target. I was alone. ""Oh God.""

I can't breathe, I think I'm having a panic attack. I'm moving everywhere. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. I rush into the bathroom and rejuvenate my face with tap water. The warm water feels like a relaxed vacation to my pores. I catch my breath and lean against the counter with my head in my hands.¬†

Did God just reach out to me? I mean, I know about the bible and a lot about Christianity, but I have been very lenient with my commitment. Was that fear‚Ä¶ or something else? Vibrations echo into my shaking legs as Savior rubs against me. At the sight of the little creature consoling me, I pet the side of his head and begin to calm down.

Sleep calls me. I'm getting too overwhelmed for one night. I skip my nightly routine, no brushing teeth, the fan staying off, straight to the bedroom with a new goal before bedtime. I pick the cross out from under the dresser and hang it back up on the door. I slide into bed, my mind still trying to catalog everything that just happened. But before it could finish, sleep whisked me away.

*The cross I had carved used to stand as a header to his home. Confused, I peer around, taking in the surroundings. Perhaps I could find the culprit who did this. Straight ahead, behind the site, is the ridgeline. The smell of ammonia emanates from the trees that reach beyond Earth's gravity, acting as supports for the cosmos. Like splinters for some unfathomable behemoth, dormant beneath the permafrost of forgotten epochs. I shuddered at the thought of such a leviathan. The primordial titans from the glacial womb of the Paleozoic rising again to glut themselves upon the soft flesh of men, using these Appalachian monoliths to rake our bones from between their eldritch teeth. Drawn by compulsion or madness, I stepped over the ridgeline. The first move I make into the biome begins a chain reaction of tremors that shake the monoliths surrounding, scaring off any peering flesh in the process. I stand unevacuated. A Chthonian hut rises from the globe's jagged and warped skin. The hut, while small, seemed to be sculpted from obsidian frost that effused a vaporous purple. I cross the threshold of the structure and enter the tenebrous stomach of the woods. Inside was only void‚Äîno light, no sound, no time. A void that had always existed. That will always exist. Not mere absence, but a presence that consumes. An omnivorous nothingness, older than thought, deeper than death. I confidently embrace the absence, becoming atomized once fully enveloped.*

My eyes snapped open as I was flooded with a new curiosity I haven't felt since I was a child. Back when I was around 9, we moved into our new home, more towards the city. The house was a two-story building, the kind with the stairs that turn 180 degrees about halfway up. Every inch of the home, outside of the bathroom and kitchen, was covered in a new grey carpet that was comforting to lie on and play on. From the top of those stairs, I pushed a Lego semi truck over the edge and onto the stairs further down, closer to the first floor. When picking up the pieces, I discovered a little compartment underneath the side of the bottom steps.

Moving the thin wood that filled the slot, I discovered an entire area hidden under the stairs. The area was dark, other than the light I was letting in, so I went and grabbed a flashlight from my dad's toolbox. Once the light flicked on, I saw that the hidden area was covered in the same comforting grey carpet as the rest of the house. A place, discovered by me, where no one else thought to look. The feeling was an excited curiosity taking over my younger self. I felt the inner child make a comeback as I thought about the hut I saw in my dreams.

The timing worked out as today is my day off from work anyway. I attempted to roll out of bed, but there was resistance on my feet. My eyes barely peek over the comforter as I spot Savior sprawled across me, sound asleep. I waited a couple of minutes, and then a sneeze from his presence broke the silence of the room. He sprang up and leaped backwards to the other side of the bed. I took the opportunity to get up while I softly whispered, ""Sorry, go back to sleep, little guy.""¬†

Ash used to do the same thing, except he was closer to my waist rather than my legs. I would wake up and have to lie for so long, petting him before he decided it was time for me to start my day. His grey hair would be all over the comforter from how much he was stroked.

In the corner next to the dresser was the same can of half-opened wet food I had left out for Ash. It had changed. The label is missing circles all over it, as if someone has a dozen or so suction cups that rip the imagery off the can. Inside the can, though, it had been licked clean. I picked it up, only to have my hand be covered in what I assume was some type of thick spit. It emerged between my fingers when it finally clicked in me, and I tossed the can out of disgust.¬† I think Savior may have eaten the old meat and must've tried to spit it back out. The can slid under the bed from the launch, just barely scraping my bed frame with the popped-up tab. I couldn't count the number of times I've sliced my foot open with the serrated edge of the lid.

Too determined on my goal to care, I forget about the can and wipe my hands off on a towel from the laundry basket. I got my clothes on and myself mentally ready to head up the hill. I slide on my boots, attach my hunting knife to my belt, and walk out into the hallway.

The living room is left a mess from my freak-out last night. I'm surprised I didn't break anything. It's just resembling a receptionist desk that was abruptly left out of a long-awaited crashout. I pick up the papers and put them back on the coffee table, where my drawing from last night remains. Did I draw during the anxiety attack? Up at the ridgeline, it looks as if someone scribbled and then erased it. Scribbled and erased.

Scribbled and erased. Over and over. The paper is even weaker in this spot. That's not all. The bottom right of the picture, where an artist would sign their name, is not my name. Instead, it's marked with ""EXODUS 33:20"" in small, fine print. I pull up my phone and mutter the scripture out loud, ""Exodus 33:20 - You cannot see my face; for no man shall see me, and live.""¬†

The garage door makes its methodical movement upwards as it begins to open. The verse is still etching its place into my mind. The four-wheeler is just as I left it, ready to go. Wow, my laziness actually did save time. I pull out of the garage and start my ride towards the top. On the way, I keep reliving the trip I made a couple of days ago, but from a different perspective. Could there have been a hut up here the whole time? While my spade was boring into the Earth, could there have been this oddity just a couple of dozen yards away? Finally, I rise over the final lip of the hill and see my answer right before me.

It's actually there, I'll be damned. I click back into neutral, put the parking brake on, and the ride comes to a close. Hopping off the side and into the wet grass, I take in the sight. Just there, right inside the woods, is a hut. Maybe the size of your average kitchen. The walls are made of what looks like dirt, stone, and tree bark. It's as if a once-cobblestone hut had been decorated and rapidly aged by nature. I fully understand not seeing this structure the other day; it's practically camouflaged into its environment. The positioning is a perfect recreation of my dream. Approaching the hut, I make it a point not to stop, but to confidently strut inside and see what it holds for me.

It's incredibly empty. There are not even things scattered around; it is just empty. The walls are covered in moss, and the humidity in this stuffy room has to have at least jumped by 20%. The floor is squishy with a firm undertone from the stones peaking through the moist grass I walk on. In the center of the room, almost as if on cue, a stone falls in through the floor. My phone flashlight makes an appearance as I get down on one knee and look into the void. The light from my phone reaches no solid destination, only a fog. The vacant hole eats the light particles far before they ever land. Is there a basement to this hut? I take a deep breath through my nose to let out the most exaggerated sigh I could before being interrupted by my own bodily functions. I immediately started gagging as the air I just ingested came from this dirty, disgusting hole. It was like dirty dishes that had sat for a week, had sex with mildewed clothes, and gave birth inside a bag of Jack Links. Scrambling back to my feet, I paced out of the doorway, hoping never to experience that awful attack ever again.

Examining the hut further on the outside shows a lot of interesting stuff. Symbols are carved all over every rock and tree surrounding it. Not to mention the hut itself being tattooed with the same icons. Jagged edges and plentiful dots make up the symbols. I could not even fabricate an idea of what they mean.

My mind is trying to put together what this thing could be. What was its purpose? Who built it? Why is it on my property? Wait‚Ä¶ My property stops at the ridgeline. Realizing I have been trespassing, I walk back to my side of the hill, where I stand and stare some more before I finally realize what it is. I bet it's an all-natural toilet built way back when hunting was the only way to get food around here. That would explain why its materials started to be reacquired by nature and why it smells like- Oh god, I just realized I probably just smelled and looked into someone's ancient outhouse. Pushing those foul thoughts away, my eyes naturally looked back at the sad sight.

I sat in the grass next to the wooden cross representing him and just‚Ä¶ existed. I started to lean backwards, the blades of grass meeting my body from my legs, to my back, and finally to my head. Gravity has won its fight as I release the tension in my muscles. Staring into the sky while letting nature sing to me the hopes and despairs of the world. The endless azure stretches above me, within it, clumps of white reminiscent of frayed strings that move with methodical aimlessness. Just when I started to get a little too warm from the sun's display, the scent of petrichor overtook the odor that was stained in my nose as the wind began to blow. The smooth wind coursing through the wilderness like electricity in a far too advanced circuit caused an overwhelmingly distinct muffling of all other sounds around me. My autopilot ends. My brain molts into what it needs to be. I know how to see him again.

I could sleep here. I could sleep right here and let the Earth reclaim me as it is currently doing with what remained of my little buddy, just a couple of feet diagonally to me. I closed my eyes, not necessarily in prayer, but just to have a final word of reassurance.¬†

""Ash, you are the only family I have. You have been with me through my hardships. What kind of person would I be if I weren't with you through yours? I will travel with you through the afterlife as your guide. As your owner. As your family. All I need is a rope, and we will be linked forward and embrace what lies after.""

What sounded like hissing and a car driving over gravel screeched out behind me. I shoot up and spin to look at the hut. There's movement in there. I can't tell what it is exactly, but it's loud and vibrating. With my eyes only adjusted to the sunny outdoors, I only see shadows oscillating inside the dark room. Well, the only way to see what's happening is to venture forth.

I reappeared in the revolting hut, just standing barely in the doorway. From the hole in the floor, purple smoke fills the bottom inch of the room to heighten the arrival of its owner. The figure of greyscale static extended its single arm out of the chasm. Then the second arm followed, creating what looked like the shape of the letter M. Exodus 33:20 ran through my mind. My eyes locked onto my boots below me. On the off chance this thing was God, I'm going to take that verse as literally as I can just to be safe. What sounded like Velcro tearing assaulted my ears. The room grew darker, blocking out the doorway behind me with the thick vapor. The whole ordeal ended with what I can only describe as the noise a pimple would make popping under its own bloated pressure. My hands were shaking. Who was I in the presence of?

Silence was all that was spoken. I waited to hear my sins be told back to me in chronological order before I got damned. But nothing ever happened. No voice ever left the deity's breath as we stood in that standoff. My eyes were tracing the outline of my boots when, at the top of my peripheral vision, I could see His feet. I unintentionally locked eyes with them. I blinked at them, and from the biggest toe to the smallest, they blinked back. Fear holds hands with faith as I ask what I think I already know the answer to.

""God?"" No language came from him. However, there is a small hiss from him as the odorless smoke rises to my face. It smells of sweets along with a scent of burning. Reminding me of my past birthday parties, the smell brings me comfort. I'm going to assume that is a yes.

""What?"" The fog drops back down to reset the conversation between us. I catch my breath to ask a question, but my voice keeps trembling due to his presence.

""Do‚Ä¶ uh.. W-what do you want? Why are you here?"" The fog rises, and the smell of petrichor from the burial site reenters my nose from the fog.

""You want Ash, don't you? Are you going to escort him to the afterlife?"" The disgusting smell violates my senses again, making my eyes burn. This time, there's ammonia thrown in the mix.

Falling to the floor and covering my face with my hands, I can't catch my breath. Did I ask the wrong question? Why is the penalty so harsh if so? That was definitely a no. I stand back up, my eyes closed, teeth gritted together, and ask, ""Then what do you want with him?""

Without warning, the pungent aroma leaves. What replaced it was hope. My curiosity was stifled as I understood. I already knew his answer to my plea. We have the same goal. My prayer has been answered, and not even in a mysterious way, but in a way I can't deny. He has my faith now. Determined and with an unconcealed smile on my face, I leave the hut. A brew of amniotic fluid and afterbirth trails behind me.

Approaching the grave, I notice what looks like wet suction cups have been placed all over the top layer of earth. I took a handful of the dirt covering Ash and brought it back to the temple. I made sure to bow my head before entering. God is truly here. He's here and he needs my help with his plan. Mom always told me that Faith would pay off in the end. I lost it, but now I am reborn again. It was always God's plan to lead me to this point. I cast the dirt out from my palm in front of me. It hovers just beyond my hand's reach and gets pulled into his perfect being. He then closes the gap towards me, and I lose my breath out of awe at how fast he is. The smoke rises, covers my face, and results in me being disconnected from myself.¬†

My eyes open to the sight of my own eyes closed. I am looking at myself in the doorway. My back to the Holiest and my eyes set on his vessel. His hand of creation then pushes me back into myself, my face colliding without ever touching. The smoke levels back to the floor, and I am once again bowing my head to him.¬†

I don't know what I could have done to deserve this, but His Holiness embraces me. He's going to return my friend to me in this world, rather than me meeting him in the next. How compassionate! I am a receiver of the Father's unyielding love and care! His Divinity expelled the gas once more, and this time, it made me sneeze. ""As you command, Father."" There was only one thing I knew of that made me sneeze, the lost soul whom I welcomed into my home.",1,1753402108.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

(Part 1),"I swing the shovel down for a final time, officially flattening the dirt. I sledged the cross into the head of the grave. I took a step back, unable to acknowledge my handiwork due to the blurriness of tears coming on. I made sure the grave was facing South so that he could see both the sunrises and the sunsets. ""I love you, Ash."" I managed to say to the desolate patch. I hope his journey is easy.

Turning away while picking up the spade, shovel, and sledgehammer, I load them onto the back of the four-wheeler and head back down the wavy hill. It's weird to think that outside will now be his permanent home, given he has only run out a handful of times. The five-minute descent dragged like hours.

The evening sun danced through the trees on my right like someone had covered the sky with a fishnet. The Four-Wheeler tore through the calmness of the farm as I pulled into the garage out back. I left the tools and the gas can bungee-corded to the rack on the back of the ride, convincing myself that I'd be saving time by not putting them back where they belonged, but in reality, I didn't want to put the effort in. Inputting the code and letting the garage door shut behind me, I just barely tilt my head to see the little site at the top of the hill.¬†

My brain mentally snaps a picture of the scene. The fog of memory turns the vision into a watercolor smear. A streaked green hill, orange-red evening sun, the tiniest blotch of light brown that gradients to the dark brown beneath it, and behind that, the ever-expanding deep green woods that go just beyond the ridgeline. The ridgeline that gives it its pronounced shape on the land of Eastern Kentucky.

My stomach grumbles, reminding me that I'm still alive and there are still things that need to be done. The front door opens just enough for me to step through, my open hand down by the ground, ready to catch any futile attempt to get out. He has always wanted to go outside, darting at the door every chance he gets. I never let him, it posed far too much of a risk with him running off into the wilderness, and me unable to catch him. But he's not there to express his cravings for the outdoors. There is no longer a greeting when entering this home.¬†

While the air fryer ticks, I latch onto meaningless thoughts, tomorrow's shift, my chores, anything but reality. Oh yeah, that's something I can put my mind to. In the stillness of the dining room, I had to take some time to clear my thoughts before actually starting to type on my phone.¬†

* Do dishes
* Sweep and mop the kitchen
* Clean out the litterb-

The beeping of the air fryer interrupted my typing. I get up, empty my chicken onto my plate, and sit down to eat.¬†

I ate in peace. No little paws batting at the edges of my plate. No meows begging for food. Just the occasional sound of chewing. There's a lingering feeling of misplacement in my mind. Things just are not right. The never-ending feeling of anticipation to see a gray streak run through the house tricks my eyes. This stuff has its unique way of making a permanent home in your brain. Just a monkey brain with pattern recognition. Unfortunately, the patterns I failed to consciously take note of before today are coming back to harass my peripherals. I just still feel like he is still around, maybe just under the table, imagining my legs as his very own scratching post. Why would God allow this?

¬†I gift the sink my plate as I start my nightly routine, cutting my evening short. Brush my teeth, turn on the fan, and open the canned wet food for Ash. I hope it's empty by tomorrow morning. I hope I wake up with barely any breath in my lungs from him loafing on my chest. I pull the blanket over me and begin to hold my knees as close to me as I can. The chore list, going unfinished and unanswered, as does the can of wet food.

*I dreamed I was walking along the beach with*

*the Lord. Scenes from my life flashed across the sky. In*

*each, I noticed divots in the sand. Sometimes there were*

*Divots and footprints; other times, there were only divots.*

*During the low periods of my life, I could see only the divots,*

*so I said, ""You promised me, Lord, that you would*

*walk with me always. Why, when I have needed you most,*

*have you not been there for me?""*

*The Lord replied, ""The times when you have seen only the divots,*

*My child, is when I carried you.""*

*The Lord and I reached the end of our beach,*

*Arriving at my bedroom door.*

*The door rips through its cheap wooden trim.*

*The cross hanging on the door falls to the floor.*¬†

*We then turn to see me lying on the bed.*

*Sound asleep, unaware of the lord's palpi.*

I got up to my alarm, not to the usual headbutting of an attention-seeking companion. My face stuck to the damp pillow as I attempted to rise out from the comforter. Hopping out of bed onto the cold wooden floor, my feet hit with an almost silent meaty slap. ""Oh, good god,"" I muttered. The door's destroyed. Maybe I did it in my sleep. I've been stressed, but not like this. I finally remember my dream.

Upon the memory coming back, I check the entire house for a break-in just in case. Nothing. Jesus, the stress must be getting to me. I can't believe I would do that in my sleep. Sure, I've broken things before by being dumb and putting too much strength into it, but this is a new level. I made a silent agreement with myself that I would fix it when I got home, and I began to get ready for work. But upon grabbing my clothes out of my dresser, I stepped on the same cross that had fallen from the door. Rather than picking it up, I scooted it under the dresser with my feet. Sliding the symbol that used to resonate with me away into darkness as if it were a spent torch.

I hung that cross up originally when I was an avid churchgoer. I did all the things a Christian should: follow the word, spread the gospel, and treat everyone neighborly. Over time, though, shortly after getting saved, I lost my will to commit to it. I came to enjoy life more, and religion went onto the back burner.¬†

I finally got to work, and upon walking through the gate, I heard someone behind me say, ""Waddup, Eli."" I knew the voice immediately, along with who he was speaking to. I turned to see Chantz. Chantz is my lifelong friend whom I work with on a team. He is a little taller than I, with shoulder-length brown hair and a scruffy beard. Built more muscular than I am, he stands broadly before me, waiting for my response.

""Hello,"" I say in a cheery tone, yet I could feel the word lacking substance as it came out. I knew he could tell I was feeling different, and that look he gave me was a sign of what I knew he was about to ask. But before he even got the opportunity, I took hold of the conversation. ""Man, I am just not feeling this place today, but hey, I'm here.""

""I feel you, I almost called off but decided fuck it, might as well come in."" He said in his normal tone. Thank god he didn't pry anymore, crisis averted. I don't even want to think about yesterday; I simply want to go into autopilot and let my emotions dwindle.

The rest of the workday went as normal. I unloaded the trucks and got to leave at a decent time once all of the work was done. When walking outside, I was hit with the sun right in my face, causing my eyes to painfully contract. Once they got used to the outdoors, I realized that Chantz was standing next to where we usually park. Walking over and unlocking my car, I heard him ask me a question.

""Wanna hang out?""¬†

""Nah, not today, I still don't feel the best.""

""Alright then, I'll talk to you later, be safe."" He said as his car shifted into drive.

""You too."" I rolled up my window and began the journey home. Almost like a switch flipping, I felt the tears coming as I turned out of the parking lot. Though I didn't want to be a random dude crying his eyes out while driving, as traffic in the opposite lane could see me. I locked my face into place. I was back to normal. It hurts knowing I wasn't going home to him.. I pulled into the farm, I call it a farm despite having no animals other than him, as I'm allergic to everything. I simply built an immunity to Ash.

I went inside and walked to my room to put my phone on charge. I dove onto the unmade bed and connected my device to the wall. Chantz had already messaged me, asking if I got home safely. I told him I did, and he followed up with a simple ""Good."" I spend a lot of time just mindlessly scrolling on the phone when my stomach screams for nourishment.

""I guess I could get something to eat,"" I said to no one as I got up. Then I turned and saw it, which resulted in my heart feeling like it was being pulled apart. The wet food can was still full. Not even a single lick of the liquid was gone from it. Throughout last night and a good part of the day, I assumed he would end up eating his whole can of wet food. Ash didn‚Äôt continue our routine. Usually, when he finished, it would sit on the floor just next to where I slept. He'd sometimes even push it so far that it would end up under the bed. I always imagined it was his way of saying, ""I'm all done, another please!"" I got reminded of his fate all over again.

The air fryer still has residue from the chicken, so I instead opted for a can of Soup. The hill he's lying on top of is just barely in view through the large window in the same room as I. I only took a couple of bites before throwing the rest of the freshly made food away. The plate from yesterday gained a new roommate as I reassured myself that it can wait another day.

I did my nightly routine, brushed my teeth, turned on the fan, and stopped myself from grabbing another can of cat food. Lying down, I tried to force myself to sleep by replaying the memories of him jumping on the bed and joining me for slumber. With the bedroom circulating the air of the room temperature meat, I fell asleep.¬†

*Ash and I were sitting in church. The same Church I have always gone to. They must have changed it in the last couple of years since I've stopped going. They have gone for a more naturalistic design. We were in the fourth pew back from the front, and he was lying on my lap. Everyone, including me, was dressed in normal Church attire. At the head of the church, a preacher stood in front of the Altar rather than behind. The Preacher had a smooth yet covered face. It wasn‚Äôt smooth like baby skin, but as in a face that represented sanded wood that had fallen in honey. No eyes, no mouth, only a smaller-than-usual nose rested upon his head. With a wave of his hand, a gramophone started playing a sermon. The words of the sermon were lost on my ears as the gramophone did not speak, rather it portrayed. I felt the feeling of fear along with faith being intertwined in my soul when the record started spinning. Followed by a forceful mixture of anger and joy. These four emotions were tossed into the blender of my body and forced to coincide in a holy union. Once the emotions reached their homeostasis, the urge to pay attention to the preacher was overwhelming. All of the faces around me, all of whom I did not recognize, looked at the man up front, and I followed suit.*¬†

*He held his hands above his head to praise the awesome and righteous lord above. In his hands appeared a black and white yin and yang symbol that went from a concept to a physical disk in his hand. I then realized that it was the vinyl record that had been playing on the gramophone. He broke it into two pieces, both halves of the opposite color. The white piece matched his robes, while the black piece matched the altar behind him. In unison, we all lift our hands, palms out, towards the man, and we are all granted our own piece of the cruel and the compassionate. The black half sank into my left palm, not as a gift, but as a hot knife sat on top of cold butter. The white half floated just out of my right palm, never obtainable, no matter how far you reached.*¬†

*The preacher held the white piece towards the sky as an offering to god, who partook in all of our compassionate halves. The only thing keeping us from being evacuated upwards was the tendrils that extended from under the preacher's outfit, branching throughout the underbelly of the pews. That wrapped around our ankles like a professional arm wrestler. We avoided gazing upon the face of the holiest of holies, so we bowed our heads, still keeping our eyes open. Ash did not. He looked directly at the Alpha and the Omega, and as a result, he went still. My lap gained frostbite from how cold he fell. He was no more. God had looked upon all he had gained, and behold, it was very good.*

*I feel the corruption of the black half has been cleansed. It contained new life. A new story. A new beginning. Everyone followed the preacher's movements as the black half was pushed into our chests with our palms, thus returning us to The Great Shepherd's flock that we have strayed so far from. God's presence disappeared, as did the preachers. I felt the frostbite fade as heat returned to my friend. We have been united through God's will and our faithfulness. Ash purred in my lap. It was very good, for all things were created through Him and for Him. On the front of the altar, hung a crucifix that was recently hidden by the ophidian-like body of the leader of this ceremony. Jesus, fixed to the cross, has nails driven into only four out of his thirteen tentacles. His gaze did not break from the floor, and his gelatinous chest was still breathing.*

I didn't go to work today. It feels as if my motivation is a well that has been drained. Despite that, I still pushed forward to get out of bed. I must have had an allergic reaction to something while I was sleeping. My arm was covered in circular, rashy blotches. They were in groupings of an overly tall triangle, starting with big circles at the bottom and smaller circles at the top. They wrapped and swirled around my arm as if someone had hit me with one of those arm bracelets in school. The thought of being in this room for any longer is nauseating. I should really throw that can away, but the chance that he comes back to the smell of his favorite meaty nutrients overrides my disgust.

""I guess it's time to fix you,"" I say while looking at the busted door frame. I walk out to my garage out back and glance up at the hill. I make my best attempt to ignore the emotions bubbling inside. In the garage, I grab a bag of tools that should have a nail gun and some other handy stuff in it, and head back inside. I get to my bedroom door, drop down on the floor, and start digging through the toolbag. A ball-peen hammer, a box cutter, and finally, the nail gun wrapped in rope. Unwinding the rope, my face frowned as the heavy tool I handled was not a nail gun; rather, it was an air stapler. A sigh left my mouth as I placed the tool back into the bag and made a mental note to go back to the garage later to get the right one.

Everything's just been so blurry, so unimportant. I'm moving through a mental fog that I can't even see my own outstretched arm in. I need to snap back into it. I need something to change. So I call Chantz. We agreed to meet up and talk about some stuff at the gym. I didn't intend to work out, just going to get some things off my chest. Time to get ready.

When I arrived, he was sitting in his car. I knocked on his window to get his attention, which made him jump a mile out of his seat.

""Oh, brother, I'm so sorry I scared you.""

""It's all good, man,"" Chantz said as he regained his composure, ""what're you gonna work out today?""

""I'm actually not gonna do anything, I'm really only here to hang out and try to get through the funk that's got a grip on me.""

""Well, come inside and we‚Äôll talk about it,"" He said inquisitively. Once inside I told him, I told him all of it. I did a good job of saying everything matter-of-factly rather than letting the sobs consume my vocal cords. He was astonished, ""Why would you still plan on coming to work, you psychopath, take some PTO or something.""

He's right, I make it a point to never use my PTO, just letting it cash out at the end of the fiscal year. I ended the explanation by saying, ""The house is just so empty now, I feel like I'm being driven mad.""

""I don't know if this is the right time to offer you anything, but I'll just throw this out there. My sister's cat just had a litter of kittens not too long ago; she gave all of them away except one. She was planning on keeping the cat, but her husband is strict on their house being a one-pet household. Would you like it?""

His offer pinged in my head as if I just peeked out of a trench in World War 2. It feels almost disrespectful to offer a replacement for my friend this soon. Still taken aback by his offer, he continued.

""Or maybe you could just keep it for a little while? Just give her a bit of time to convince him, ya know? Kind of like a temporary home. I know you are a good pet owner, so I figured you would be the best person for it. Feel free to say no, though.""

I was contemplating my decision, meanwhile, Chantz had already started to text his sister asking for details about the cat. Before I could get another word out, he introduced me to the feline through his phone. ""His name is Savior.""¬†

""Sure, I'll home him.""

We agreed that I would follow him back to his sister's house to pick up the little one. Luckily, his sister is on my way home, so it's no big deal for me. I brought up the dream about the preacher to him, and he responded with an astonished laugh.

""Jesus dude, I didn't know you had such deep dreams. Mine usually consists of people in my life who have never met each other doing crazy stuff."" He smiles as he puts his gym bag in the locker.

""Do you believe God can talk to us like that?"" Upon hearing myself, I cringed; I sounded like a child.

""I don't think God is here anymore. I don't know how everything was created, but if he created a messed-up world like this one, I'd run away from it too.""¬†

Chantz and I have always been on opposite sides of religion. Despite us both growing up in religious households, my faith had lingered, while he viewed his as a burden. I quickly change the subject and we continue to talk between his sets of working out. The rest of the hangout was just a little blip in my mind, not significant enough to place in the timeline of my memory. Before I knew it, I was driving home. A little black and white replacement lying asleep on my thighs, causing my nose to run.

Opening the door with my hand leading in front of my feet, there was no resistance. My other hand contains the cat. He's cute as hell, but he isn't Ash. I show him around to his amenities, his food, and his litterbox. Right before sneezing, I sit him on the floor, free to explore his temporary residence. He immediately goes to the scratching post and digs his nails into it. Into Ash's scratching post. Resentment enters my system like a foreign body.

I needed something to calm me down, so I began to dig around in the closets. The first closet in the hallway had nothing but old vacation bible school drawings and crafts. The second closet had my college art supplies, which I knew for a fact had smokes in them. Back then, I couldn't be more stereotypical with smoking cigarettes and talking about the deeper meaning of the arts. I grab my pack of deteriorated cigarettes and head onto the back porch. Inside the pack, a black lighter is concealed. Sitting down in the chair, I flick the lighter on. I feel the tar attach to my lungs, and the nicotine puts some ease on my brain.

Some time goes by, I'm not sure how much though. Although I love the outdoors, it's getting close to evening, and I see a thunderstorm is on its way. Plus, I got an idea for an activity indoors. I went back to the closet, grabbed the art supplies, and sat down in the living room. The art supplies took up most of the coffee table, mostly pencils, sketch papers, and paint. Looking through my old drawings of mutilated monsters and other freaky things inspired me to pick up the pencil again. This time it wasn't to make scary stuff, but to print out a memory that had been ingrained into me onto the paper. I began to sketch the hillside, the sunset, the ridgeline, and the grave onto the blank paper.

When all was done, it looked decent, of course. Where it was a sketch, it looked a little all over the place, but it was good nonetheless. By the time I was finished, I looked up at the TV, which had stopped playing whatever music I had on. Instead, it was on the idle slideshow screen. Simply showing pictured memories, waiting for the remote to be interacted with again. I leaned back into the couch, causing the leather to rub together to make its unique noise, and enjoyed the memories.¬†

Then I see the first-ever picture I took of him. My stream of emotions runs easily with the serenity of Nostalgia, before being traumatically contaminated. From an innocent kitten covered in fleas and dirt, to my rambunctious, cuddly, and always curious friend. My friend, who had just days prior been resting still in the corner of the couch, waiting to be discovered, the fire of his soul already extinguished.¬†

Despair had ruined my evening. The sulking was combined with the sadness, which resulted in me relapsing back to just sitting there thinking. Wait, no, I'm not going to think, I'm going to do something to get my mind off things. I walk outside to take in the outdoor air. The lightning just lit up the living room as the storm was raging. I let the rain hit me as the humidity began to wage a war with the smog in my lungs from earlier.¬†

I wonder how Ash is doing. I mean, I wonder what he is going through. Is he just experiencing some kind of afterlife, or is he actually gone? Thinking about that, I remember my dream from last night. Can faith bring him back, or was that just another stress dream? Either way, I cast away any doubt I had about believing. Still drenched, I shifted to the couch just inside the door. Down on my knees, my elbows dug into the faux leather, making an imprint of my pleading pose. I prayed with all the faith I could muster up.

""God, my best friend had left a couple of days ago, and I'm just asking you to do something for me. Please watch over him and his journey to wherever he is heading. I'm not sure what type of afterlife he goes to, but please just allow him to get there safely and happily. God, if you‚Äôre feeling generous, I‚Äôd be willing to do anything to be reunited¬† with him again.""

My prayer was cut short by the instant drop in temperature. The air turned frigid, but my body turned into a furnace. It was as if boiling water was tossed into a snowstorm where I sat. I unwaveringly kept my eyes shut until I felt more than just the cold. I felt arms. The arms wrapped around me from behind as if a lover was begging a soulmate not to leave. The arms didn't even fully touch me. It felt like the goal of the hug was to show support to the peach fuzz on my body rather than my skin. The cold air hurt my nose as an aroma of a clean, floral scent submerged that sense. I felt‚Ä¶ Faith. As if my prayer did something. I realized what was happening, and fear overwhelmed the Faith. I spun around with my eyes shooting open, along with my fist gaining the torque of my torso, yet the fist never landed on a target. I was alone. ""Oh God.""

I can't breathe, I think I'm having a panic attack. I'm moving everywhere. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. I rush into the bathroom and rejuvenate my face with tap water. The warm water feels like a relaxed vacation to my pores. I catch my breath and lean against the counter with my head in my hands.¬†

Did God just reach out to me? I mean, I know about the bible and a lot about Christianity, but I have been very lenient with my commitment. Was that fear‚Ä¶ or something else? Vibrations echo into my shaking legs as Savior rubs against me. At the sight of the little creature consoling me, I pet the side of his head and begin to calm down.

Sleep calls me. I'm getting too overwhelmed for one night. I skip my nightly routine, no brushing teeth, the fan staying off, straight to the bedroom with a new goal before bedtime. I pick the cross out from under the dresser and hang it back up on the door. I slide into bed, my mind still trying to catalog everything that just happened. But before it could finish, sleep whisked me away.

*The cross I had carved used to stand as a header to his home. Confused, I peer around, taking in the surroundings. Perhaps I could find the culprit who did this. Straight ahead, behind the site, is the ridgeline. The smell of ammonia emanates from the trees that reach beyond Earth's gravity, acting as supports for the cosmos. Like splinters for some unfathomable behemoth, dormant beneath the permafrost of forgotten epochs. I shuddered at the thought of such a leviathan. The primordial titans from the glacial womb of the Paleozoic rising again to glut themselves upon the soft flesh of men, using these Appalachian monoliths to rake our bones from between their eldritch teeth. Drawn by compulsion or madness, I stepped over the ridgeline. The first move I make into the biome begins a chain reaction of tremors that shake the monoliths surrounding, scaring off any peering flesh in the process. I stand unevacuated. A Chthonian hut rises from the globe's jagged and warped skin. The hut, while small, seemed to be sculpted from obsidian frost that effused a vaporous purple. I cross the threshold of the structure and enter the tenebrous stomach of the woods. Inside was only void‚Äîno light, no sound, no time. A void that had always existed. That will always exist. Not mere absence, but a presence that consumes. An omnivorous nothingness, older than thought, deeper than death. I confidently embrace the absence, becoming atomized once fully enveloped.*

My eyes snapped open as I was flooded with a new curiosity I haven't felt since I was a child. Back when I was around 9, we moved into our new home, more towards the city. The house was a two-story building, the kind with the stairs that turn 180 degrees about halfway up. Every inch of the home, outside of the bathroom and kitchen, was covered in a new grey carpet that was comforting to lie on and play on. From the top of those stairs, I pushed a Lego semi truck over the edge and onto the stairs further down, closer to the first floor. When picking up the pieces, I discovered a little compartment underneath the side of the bottom steps.

Moving the thin wood that filled the slot, I discovered an entire area hidden under the stairs. The area was dark, other than the light I was letting in, so I went and grabbed a flashlight from my dad's toolbox. Once the light flicked on, I saw that the hidden area was covered in the same comforting grey carpet as the rest of the house. A place, discovered by me, where no one else thought to look. The feeling was an excited curiosity taking over my younger self. I felt the inner child make a comeback as I thought about the hut I saw in my dreams.

The timing worked out as today is my day off from work anyway. I attempted to roll out of bed, but there was resistance on my feet. My eyes barely peek over the comforter as I spot Savior sprawled across me, sound asleep. I waited a couple of minutes, and then a sneeze from his presence broke the silence of the room. He sprang up and leaped backwards to the other side of the bed. I took the opportunity to get up while I softly whispered, ""Sorry, go back to sleep, little guy.""¬†

Ash used to do the same thing, except he was closer to my waist rather than my legs. I would wake up and have to lie for so long, petting him before he decided it was time for me to start my day. His grey hair would be all over the comforter from how much he was stroked.

In the corner next to the dresser was the same can of half-opened wet food I had left out for Ash. It had changed. The label is missing circles all over it, as if someone has a dozen or so suction cups that rip the imagery off the can. Inside the can, though, it had been licked clean. I picked it up, only to have my hand be covered in what I assume was some type of thick spit. It emerged between my fingers when it finally clicked in me, and I tossed the can out of disgust.¬† I think Savior may have eaten the old meat and must've tried to spit it back out. The can slid under the bed from the launch, just barely scraping my bed frame with the popped-up tab. I couldn't count the number of times I've sliced my foot open with the serrated edge of the lid.

Too determined on my goal to care, I forget about the can and wipe my hands off on a towel from the laundry basket. I got my clothes on and myself mentally ready to head up the hill. I slide on my boots, attach my hunting knife to my belt, and walk out into the hallway.

The living room is left a mess from my freak-out last night. I'm surprised I didn't break anything. It's just resembling a receptionist desk that was abruptly left out of a long-awaited crashout. I pick up the papers and put them back on the coffee table, where my drawing from last night remains. Did I draw during the anxiety attack? Up at the ridgeline, it looks as if someone scribbled and then erased it. Scribbled and erased.

Scribbled and erased. Over and over. The paper is even weaker in this spot. That's not all. The bottom right of the picture, where an artist would sign their name, is not my name. Instead, it's marked with ""EXODUS 33:20"" in small, fine print. I pull up my phone and mutter the scripture out loud, ""Exodus 33:20 - You cannot see my face; for no man shall see me, and live.""¬†

The garage door makes its methodical movement upwards as it begins to open. The verse is still etching its place into my mind. The four-wheeler is just as I left it, ready to go. Wow, my laziness actually did save time. I pull out of the garage and start my ride towards the top. On the way, I keep reliving the trip I made a couple of days ago, but from a different perspective. Could there have been a hut up here the whole time? While my spade was boring into the Earth, could there have been this oddity just a couple of dozen yards away? Finally, I rise over the final lip of the hill and see my answer right before me.

It's actually there, I'll be damned. I click back into neutral, put the parking brake on, and the ride comes to a close. Hopping off the side and into the wet grass, I take in the sight. Just there, right inside the woods, is a hut. Maybe the size of your average kitchen. The walls are made of what looks like dirt, stone, and tree bark. It's as if a once-cobblestone hut had been decorated and rapidly aged by nature. I fully understand not seeing this structure the other day; it's practically camouflaged into its environment. The positioning is a perfect recreation of my dream. Approaching the hut, I make it a point not to stop, but to confidently strut inside and see what it holds for me.

It's incredibly empty. There are not even things scattered around; it is just empty. The walls are covered in moss, and the humidity in this stuffy room has to have at least jumped by 20%. The floor is squishy with a firm undertone from the stones peaking through the moist grass I walk on. In the center of the room, almost as if on cue, a stone falls in through the floor. My phone flashlight makes an appearance as I get down on one knee and look into the void. The light from my phone reaches no solid destination, only a fog. The vacant hole eats the light particles far before they ever land. Is there a basement to this hut? I take a deep breath through my nose to let out the most exaggerated sigh I could before being interrupted by my own bodily functions. I immediately started gagging as the air I just ingested came from this dirty, disgusting hole. It was like dirty dishes that had sat for a week, had sex with mildewed clothes, and gave birth inside a bag of Jack Links. Scrambling back to my feet, I paced out of the doorway, hoping never to experience that awful attack ever again.

Examining the hut further on the outside shows a lot of interesting stuff. Symbols are carved all over every rock and tree surrounding it. Not to mention the hut itself being tattooed with the same icons. Jagged edges and plentiful dots make up the symbols. I could not even fabricate an idea of what they mean.

My mind is trying to put together what this thing could be. What was its purpose? Who built it? Why is it on my property? Wait‚Ä¶ My property stops at the ridgeline. Realizing I have been trespassing, I walk back to my side of the hill, where I stand and stare some more before I finally realize what it is. I bet it's an all-natural toilet built way back when hunting was the only way to get food around here. That would explain why its materials started to be reacquired by nature and why it smells like- Oh god, I just realized I probably just smelled and looked into someone's ancient outhouse. Pushing those foul thoughts away, my eyes naturally looked back at the sad sight.

I sat in the grass next to the wooden cross representing him and just‚Ä¶ existed. I started to lean backwards, the blades of grass meeting my body from my legs, to my back, and finally to my head. Gravity has won its fight as I release the tension in my muscles. Staring into the sky while letting nature sing to me the hopes and despairs of the world. The endless azure stretches above me, within it, clumps of white reminiscent of frayed strings that move with methodical aimlessness. Just when I started to get a little too warm from the sun's display, the scent of petrichor overtook the odor that was stained in my nose as the wind began to blow. The smooth wind coursing through the wilderness like electricity in a far too advanced circuit caused an overwhelmingly distinct muffling of all other sounds around me. My autopilot ends. My brain molts into what it needs to be. I know how to see him again.

I could sleep here. I could sleep right here and let the Earth reclaim me as it is currently doing with what remained of my little buddy, just a couple of feet diagonally to me. I closed my eyes, not necessarily in prayer, but just to have a final word of reassurance.¬†

""Ash, you are the only family I have. You have been with me through my hardships. What kind of person would I be if I weren't with you through yours? I will travel with you through the afterlife as your guide. As your owner. As your family. All I need is a rope, and we will be linked forward and embrace what lies after.""

What sounded like hissing and a car driving over gravel screeched out behind me. I shoot up and spin to look at the hut. There's movement in there. I can't tell what it is exactly, but it's loud and vibrating. With my eyes only adjusted to the sunny outdoors, I only see shadows oscillating inside the dark room. Well, the only way to see what's happening is to venture forth.

I reappeared in the revolting hut, just standing barely in the doorway. From the hole in the floor, purple smoke fills the bottom inch of the room to heighten the arrival of its owner. The figure of greyscale static extended its single arm out of the chasm. Then the second arm followed, creating what looked like the shape of the letter M. Exodus 33:20 ran through my mind. My eyes locked onto my boots below me. On the off chance this thing was God, I'm going to take that verse as literally as I can just to be safe. What sounded like Velcro tearing assaulted my ears. The room grew darker, blocking out the doorway behind me with the thick vapor. The whole ordeal ended with what I can only describe as the noise a pimple would make popping under its own bloated pressure. My hands were shaking. Who was I in the presence of?

Silence was all that was spoken. I waited to hear my sins be told back to me in chronological order before I got damned. But nothing ever happened. No voice ever left the deity's breath as we stood in that standoff. My eyes were tracing the outline of my boots when, at the top of my peripheral vision, I could see His feet. I unintentionally locked eyes with them. I blinked at them, and from the biggest toe to the smallest, they blinked back. Fear holds hands with faith as I ask what I think I already know the answer to.

""God?"" No language came from him. However, there is a small hiss from him as the odorless smoke rises to my face. It smells of sweets along with a scent of burning. Reminding me of my past birthday parties, the smell brings me comfort. I'm going to assume that is a yes.

""What?"" The fog drops back down to reset the conversation between us. I catch my breath to ask a question, but my voice keeps trembling due to his presence.

""Do‚Ä¶ uh.. W-what do you want? Why are you here?"" The fog rises, and the smell of petrichor from the burial site reenters my nose from the fog.

""You want Ash, don't you? Are you going to escort him to the afterlife?"" The disgusting smell violates my senses again, making my eyes burn. This time, there's ammonia thrown in the mix.

Falling to the floor and covering my face with my hands, I can't catch my breath. Did I ask the wrong question? Why is the penalty so harsh if so? That was definitely a no. I stand back up, my eyes closed, teeth gritted together, and ask, ""Then what do you want with him?""

Without warning, the pungent aroma leaves. What replaced it was hope. My curiosity was stifled as I understood. I already knew his answer to my plea. We have the same goal. My prayer has been answered, and not even in a mysterious way, but in a way I can't deny. He has my faith now. Determined and with an unconcealed smile on my face, I leave the hut. A brew of amniotic fluid and afterbirth trails behind me.

Approaching the grave, I notice what looks like wet suction cups have been placed all over the top layer of earth. I took a handful of the dirt covering Ash and brought it back to the temple. I made sure to bow my head before entering. God is truly here. He's here and he needs my help with his plan. Mom always told me that Faith would pay off in the end. I lost it, but now I am reborn again. It was always God's plan to lead me to this point. I cast the dirt out from my palm in front of me. It hovers just beyond my hand's reach and gets pulled into his perfect being. He then closes the gap towards me, and I lose my breath out of awe at how fast he is. The smoke rises, covers my face, and results in me being disconnected from myself.¬†

My eyes open to the sight of my own eyes closed. I am looking at myself in the doorway. My back to the Holiest and my eyes set on his vessel. His hand of creation then pushes me back into myself, my face colliding without ever touching. The smoke levels back to the floor, and I am once again bowing my head to him.¬†

I don't know what I could have done to deserve this, but His Holiness embraces me. He's going to return my friend to me in this world, rather than me meeting him in the next. How compassionate! I am a receiver of the Father's unyielding love and care! His Divinity expelled the gas once more, and this time, it made me sneeze. ""As you command, Father."" There was only one thing I knew of that made me sneeze, the lost soul whom I welcomed into my home.",1,1753402069.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

(Part 1),"I swing the shovel down for a final time, officially flattening the dirt. I sledged the cross into the head of the grave. I took a step back, unable to acknowledge my handiwork due to the blurriness of tears coming on. I made sure the grave was facing South so that he could see both the sunrises and the sunsets. ""I love you, Ash."" I managed to say to the desolate patch. I hope his journey is easy.

Turning away while picking up the spade, shovel, and sledgehammer, I load them onto the back of the four-wheeler and head back down the wavy hill. It's weird to think that outside will now be his permanent home, given he has only run out a handful of times. The five-minute descent dragged like hours.

The evening sun danced through the trees on my right like someone had covered the sky with a fishnet. The Four-Wheeler tore through the calmness of the farm as I pulled into the garage out back. I left the tools and the gas can bungee-corded to the rack on the back of the ride, convincing myself that I'd be saving time by not putting them back where they belonged, but in reality, I didn't want to put the effort in. Inputting the code and letting the garage door shut behind me, I just barely tilt my head to see the little site at the top of the hill.¬†

My brain mentally snaps a picture of the scene. The fog of memory turns the vision into a watercolor smear. A streaked green hill, orange-red evening sun, the tiniest blotch of light brown that gradients to the dark brown beneath it, and behind that, the ever-expanding deep green woods that go just beyond the ridgeline. The ridgeline that gives it its pronounced shape on the land of Eastern Kentucky.

My stomach grumbles, reminding me that I'm still alive and there are still things that need to be done. The front door opens just enough for me to step through, my open hand down by the ground, ready to catch any futile attempt to get out. He has always wanted to go outside, darting at the door every chance he gets. I never let him, it posed far too much of a risk with him running off into the wilderness, and me unable to catch him. But he's not there to express his cravings for the outdoors. There is no longer a greeting when entering this home.¬†

While the air fryer ticks, I latch onto meaningless thoughts, tomorrow's shift, my chores, anything but reality. Oh yeah, that's something I can put my mind to. In the stillness of the dining room, I had to take some time to clear my thoughts before actually starting to type on my phone.¬†

* Do dishes
* Sweep and mop the kitchen
* Clean out the litterb-

The beeping of the air fryer interrupted my typing. I get up, empty my chicken onto my plate, and sit down to eat.¬†

I ate in peace. No little paws batting at the edges of my plate. No meows begging for food. Just the occasional sound of chewing. There's a lingering feeling of misplacement in my mind. Things just are not right. The never-ending feeling of anticipation to see a gray streak run through the house tricks my eyes. This stuff has its unique way of making a permanent home in your brain. Just a monkey brain with pattern recognition. Unfortunately, the patterns I failed to consciously take note of before today are coming back to harass my peripherals. I just still feel like he is still around, maybe just under the table, imagining my legs as his very own scratching post. Why would God allow this?

¬†I gift the sink my plate as I start my nightly routine, cutting my evening short. Brush my teeth, turn on the fan, and open the canned wet food for Ash. I hope it's empty by tomorrow morning. I hope I wake up with barely any breath in my lungs from him loafing on my chest. I pull the blanket over me and begin to hold my knees as close to me as I can. The chore list, going unfinished and unanswered, as does the can of wet food.

*I dreamed I was walking along the beach with*

*the Lord. Scenes from my life flashed across the sky. In*

*each, I noticed divots in the sand. Sometimes there were*

*Divots and footprints; other times, there were only divots.*

*During the low periods of my life, I could see only the divots,*

*so I said, ""You promised me, Lord, that you would*

*walk with me always. Why, when I have needed you most,*

*have you not been there for me?""*

*The Lord replied, ""The times when you have seen only the divots,*

*My child, is when I carried you.""*

*The Lord and I reached the end of our beach,*

*Arriving at my bedroom door.*

*The door rips through its cheap wooden trim.*

*The cross hanging on the door falls to the floor.*¬†

*We then turn to see me lying on the bed.*

*Sound asleep, unaware of the lord's palpi.*

I got up to my alarm, not to the usual headbutting of an attention-seeking companion. My face stuck to the damp pillow as I attempted to rise out from the comforter. Hopping out of bed onto the cold wooden floor, my feet hit with an almost silent meaty slap. ""Oh, good god,"" I muttered. The door's destroyed. Maybe I did it in my sleep. I've been stressed, but not like this. I finally remember my dream.

Upon the memory coming back, I check the entire house for a break-in just in case. Nothing. Jesus, the stress must be getting to me. I can't believe I would do that in my sleep. Sure, I've broken things before by being dumb and putting too much strength into it, but this is a new level. I made a silent agreement with myself that I would fix it when I got home, and I began to get ready for work. But upon grabbing my clothes out of my dresser, I stepped on the same cross that had fallen from the door. Rather than picking it up, I scooted it under the dresser with my feet. Sliding the symbol that used to resonate with me away into darkness as if it were a spent torch.

I hung that cross up originally when I was an avid churchgoer. I did all the things a Christian should: follow the word, spread the gospel, and treat everyone neighborly. Over time, though, shortly after getting saved, I lost my will to commit to it. I came to enjoy life more, and religion went onto the back burner.¬†

I finally got to work, and upon walking through the gate, I heard someone behind me say, ""Waddup, Eli."" I knew the voice immediately, along with who he was speaking to. I turned to see Chantz. Chantz is my lifelong friend whom I work with on a team. He is a little taller than I, with shoulder-length brown hair and a scruffy beard. Built more muscular than I am, he stands broadly before me, waiting for my response.

""Hello,"" I say in a cheery tone, yet I could feel the word lacking substance as it came out. I knew he could tell I was feeling different, and that look he gave me was a sign of what I knew he was about to ask. But before he even got the opportunity, I took hold of the conversation. ""Man, I am just not feeling this place today, but hey, I'm here.""

""I feel you, I almost called off but decided fuck it, might as well come in."" He said in his normal tone. Thank god he didn't pry anymore, crisis averted. I don't even want to think about yesterday; I simply want to go into autopilot and let my emotions dwindle.

The rest of the workday went as normal. I unloaded the trucks and got to leave at a decent time once all of the work was done. When walking outside, I was hit with the sun right in my face, causing my eyes to painfully contract. Once they got used to the outdoors, I realized that Chantz was standing next to where we usually park. Walking over and unlocking my car, I heard him ask me a question.

""Wanna hang out?""¬†

""Nah, not today, I still don't feel the best.""

""Alright then, I'll talk to you later, be safe."" He said as his car shifted into drive.

""You too."" I rolled up my window and began the journey home. Almost like a switch flipping, I felt the tears coming as I turned out of the parking lot. Though I didn't want to be a random dude crying his eyes out while driving, as traffic in the opposite lane could see me. I locked my face into place. I was back to normal. It hurts knowing I wasn't going home to him.. I pulled into the farm, I call it a farm despite having no animals other than him, as I'm allergic to everything. I simply built an immunity to Ash.

I went inside and walked to my room to put my phone on charge. I dove onto the unmade bed and connected my device to the wall. Chantz had already messaged me, asking if I got home safely. I told him I did, and he followed up with a simple ""Good."" I spend a lot of time just mindlessly scrolling on the phone when my stomach screams for nourishment.

""I guess I could get something to eat,"" I said to no one as I got up. Then I turned and saw it, which resulted in my heart feeling like it was being pulled apart. The wet food can was still full. Not even a single lick of the liquid was gone from it. Throughout last night and a good part of the day, I assumed he would end up eating his whole can of wet food. Ash didn‚Äôt continue our routine. Usually, when he finished, it would sit on the floor just next to where I slept. He'd sometimes even push it so far that it would end up under the bed. I always imagined it was his way of saying, ""I'm all done, another please!"" I got reminded of his fate all over again.

The air fryer still has residue from the chicken, so I instead opted for a can of Soup. The hill he's lying on top of is just barely in view through the large window in the same room as I. I only took a couple of bites before throwing the rest of the freshly made food away. The plate from yesterday gained a new roommate as I reassured myself that it can wait another day.

I did my nightly routine, brushed my teeth, turned on the fan, and stopped myself from grabbing another can of cat food. Lying down, I tried to force myself to sleep by replaying the memories of him jumping on the bed and joining me for slumber. With the bedroom circulating the air of the room temperature meat, I fell asleep.¬†

*Ash and I were sitting in church. The same Church I have always gone to. They must have changed it in the last couple of years since I've stopped going. They have gone for a more naturalistic design. We were in the fourth pew back from the front, and he was lying on my lap. Everyone, including me, was dressed in normal Church attire. At the head of the church, a preacher stood in front of the Altar rather than behind. The Preacher had a smooth yet covered face. It wasn‚Äôt smooth like baby skin, but as in a face that represented sanded wood that had fallen in honey. No eyes, no mouth, only a smaller-than-usual nose rested upon his head. With a wave of his hand, a gramophone started playing a sermon. The words of the sermon were lost on my ears as the gramophone did not speak, rather it portrayed. I felt the feeling of fear along with faith being intertwined in my soul when the record started spinning. Followed by a forceful mixture of anger and joy. These four emotions were tossed into the blender of my body and forced to coincide in a holy union. Once the emotions reached their homeostasis, the urge to pay attention to the preacher was overwhelming. All of the faces around me, all of whom I did not recognize, looked at the man up front, and I followed suit.*¬†

*He held his hands above his head to praise the awesome and righteous lord above. In his hands appeared a black and white yin and yang symbol that went from a concept to a physical disk in his hand. I then realized that it was the vinyl record that had been playing on the gramophone. He broke it into two pieces, both halves of the opposite color. The white piece matched his robes, while the black piece matched the altar behind him. In unison, we all lift our hands, palms out, towards the man, and we are all granted our own piece of the cruel and the compassionate. The black half sank into my left palm, not as a gift, but as a hot knife sat on top of cold butter. The white half floated just out of my right palm, never obtainable, no matter how far you reached.*¬†

*The preacher held the white piece towards the sky as an offering to god, who partook in all of our compassionate halves. The only thing keeping us from being evacuated upwards was the tendrils that extended from under the preacher's outfit, branching throughout the underbelly of the pews. That wrapped around our ankles like a professional arm wrestler. We avoided gazing upon the face of the holiest of holies, so we bowed our heads, still keeping our eyes open. Ash did not. He looked directly at the Alpha and the Omega, and as a result, he went still. My lap gained frostbite from how cold he fell. He was no more. God had looked upon all he had gained, and behold, it was very good.*

*I feel the corruption of the black half has been cleansed. It contained new life. A new story. A new beginning. Everyone followed the preacher's movements as the black half was pushed into our chests with our palms, thus returning us to The Great Shepherd's flock that we have strayed so far from. God's presence disappeared, as did the preachers. I felt the frostbite fade as heat returned to my friend. We have been united through God's will and our faithfulness. Ash purred in my lap. It was very good, for all things were created through Him and for Him. On the front of the altar, hung a crucifix that was recently hidden by the ophidian-like body of the leader of this ceremony. Jesus, fixed to the cross, has nails driven into only four out of his thirteen tentacles. His gaze did not break from the floor, and his gelatinous chest was still breathing.*

I didn't go to work today. It feels as if my motivation is a well that has been drained. Despite that, I still pushed forward to get out of bed. I must have had an allergic reaction to something while I was sleeping. My arm was covered in circular, rashy blotches. They were in groupings of an overly tall triangle, starting with big circles at the bottom and smaller circles at the top. They wrapped and swirled around my arm as if someone had hit me with one of those arm bracelets in school. The thought of being in this room for any longer is nauseating. I should really throw that can away, but the chance that he comes back to the smell of his favorite meaty nutrients overrides my disgust.

""I guess it's time to fix you,"" I say while looking at the busted door frame. I walk out to my garage out back and glance up at the hill. I make my best attempt to ignore the emotions bubbling inside. In the garage, I grab a bag of tools that should have a nail gun and some other handy stuff in it, and head back inside. I get to my bedroom door, drop down on the floor, and start digging through the toolbag. A ball-peen hammer, a box cutter, and finally, the nail gun wrapped in rope. Unwinding the rope, my face frowned as the heavy tool I handled was not a nail gun; rather, it was an air stapler. A sigh left my mouth as I placed the tool back into the bag and made a mental note to go back to the garage later to get the right one.

Everything's just been so blurry, so unimportant. I'm moving through a mental fog that I can't even see my own outstretched arm in. I need to snap back into it. I need something to change. So I call Chantz. We agreed to meet up and talk about some stuff at the gym. I didn't intend to work out, just going to get some things off my chest. Time to get ready.

When I arrived, he was sitting in his car. I knocked on his window to get his attention, which made him jump a mile out of his seat.

""Oh, brother, I'm so sorry I scared you.""

""It's all good, man,"" Chantz said as he regained his composure, ""what're you gonna work out today?""

""I'm actually not gonna do anything, I'm really only here to hang out and try to get through the funk that's got a grip on me.""

""Well, come inside and we‚Äôll talk about it,"" He said inquisitively. Once inside I told him, I told him all of it. I did a good job of saying everything matter-of-factly rather than letting the sobs consume my vocal cords. He was astonished, ""Why would you still plan on coming to work, you psychopath, take some PTO or something.""

He's right, I make it a point to never use my PTO, just letting it cash out at the end of the fiscal year. I ended the explanation by saying, ""The house is just so empty now, I feel like I'm being driven mad.""

""I don't know if this is the right time to offer you anything, but I'll just throw this out there. My sister's cat just had a litter of kittens not too long ago; she gave all of them away except one. She was planning on keeping the cat, but her husband is strict on their house being a one-pet household. Would you like it?""

His offer pinged in my head as if I just peeked out of a trench in World War 2. It feels almost disrespectful to offer a replacement for my friend this soon. Still taken aback by his offer, he continued.

""Or maybe you could just keep it for a little while? Just give her a bit of time to convince him, ya know? Kind of like a temporary home. I know you are a good pet owner, so I figured you would be the best person for it. Feel free to say no, though.""

I was contemplating my decision, meanwhile, Chantz had already started to text his sister asking for details about the cat. Before I could get another word out, he introduced me to the feline through his phone. ""His name is Savior.""¬†

""Sure, I'll home him.""

We agreed that I would follow him back to his sister's house to pick up the little one. Luckily, his sister is on my way home, so it's no big deal for me. I brought up the dream about the preacher to him, and he responded with an astonished laugh.

""Jesus dude, I didn't know you had such deep dreams. Mine usually consists of people in my life who have never met each other doing crazy stuff."" He smiles as he puts his gym bag in the locker.

""Do you believe God can talk to us like that?"" Upon hearing myself, I cringed; I sounded like a child.

""I don't think God is here anymore. I don't know how everything was created, but if he created a messed-up world like this one, I'd run away from it too.""¬†

Chantz and I have always been on opposite sides of religion. Despite us both growing up in religious households, my faith had lingered, while he viewed his as a burden. I quickly change the subject and we continue to talk between his sets of working out. The rest of the hangout was just a little blip in my mind, not significant enough to place in the timeline of my memory. Before I knew it, I was driving home. A little black and white replacement lying asleep on my thighs, causing my nose to run.

Opening the door with my hand leading in front of my feet, there was no resistance. My other hand contains the cat. He's cute as hell, but he isn't Ash. I show him around to his amenities, his food, and his litterbox. Right before sneezing, I sit him on the floor, free to explore his temporary residence. He immediately goes to the scratching post and digs his nails into it. Into Ash's scratching post. Resentment enters my system like a foreign body.

I needed something to calm me down, so I began to dig around in the closets. The first closet in the hallway had nothing but old vacation bible school drawings and crafts. The second closet had my college art supplies, which I knew for a fact had smokes in them. Back then, I couldn't be more stereotypical with smoking cigarettes and talking about the deeper meaning of the arts. I grab my pack of deteriorated cigarettes and head onto the back porch. Inside the pack, a black lighter is concealed. Sitting down in the chair, I flick the lighter on. I feel the tar attach to my lungs, and the nicotine puts some ease on my brain.

Some time goes by, I'm not sure how much though. Although I love the outdoors, it's getting close to evening, and I see a thunderstorm is on its way. Plus, I got an idea for an activity indoors. I went back to the closet, grabbed the art supplies, and sat down in the living room. The art supplies took up most of the coffee table, mostly pencils, sketch papers, and paint. Looking through my old drawings of mutilated monsters and other freaky things inspired me to pick up the pencil again. This time it wasn't to make scary stuff, but to print out a memory that had been ingrained into me onto the paper. I began to sketch the hillside, the sunset, the ridgeline, and the grave onto the blank paper.

When all was done, it looked decent, of course. Where it was a sketch, it looked a little all over the place, but it was good nonetheless. By the time I was finished, I looked up at the TV, which had stopped playing whatever music I had on. Instead, it was on the idle slideshow screen. Simply showing pictured memories, waiting for the remote to be interacted with again. I leaned back into the couch, causing the leather to rub together to make its unique noise, and enjoyed the memories.¬†

Then I see the first-ever picture I took of him. My stream of emotions runs easily with the serenity of Nostalgia, before being traumatically contaminated. From an innocent kitten covered in fleas and dirt, to my rambunctious, cuddly, and always curious friend. My friend, who had just days prior been resting still in the corner of the couch, waiting to be discovered, the fire of his soul already extinguished.¬†

Despair had ruined my evening. The sulking was combined with the sadness, which resulted in me relapsing back to just sitting there thinking. Wait, no, I'm not going to think, I'm going to do something to get my mind off things. I walk outside to take in the outdoor air. The lightning just lit up the living room as the storm was raging. I let the rain hit me as the humidity began to wage a war with the smog in my lungs from earlier.¬†

I wonder how Ash is doing. I mean, I wonder what he is going through. Is he just experiencing some kind of afterlife, or is he actually gone? Thinking about that, I remember my dream from last night. Can faith bring him back, or was that just another stress dream? Either way, I cast away any doubt I had about believing. Still drenched, I shifted to the couch just inside the door. Down on my knees, my elbows dug into the faux leather, making an imprint of my pleading pose. I prayed with all the faith I could muster up.

""God, my best friend had left a couple of days ago, and I'm just asking you to do something for me. Please watch over him and his journey to wherever he is heading. I'm not sure what type of afterlife he goes to, but please just allow him to get there safely and happily. God, if you‚Äôre feeling generous, I‚Äôd be willing to do anything to be reunited¬† with him again.""

My prayer was cut short by the instant drop in temperature. The air turned frigid, but my body turned into a furnace. It was as if boiling water was tossed into a snowstorm where I sat. I unwaveringly kept my eyes shut until I felt more than just the cold. I felt arms. The arms wrapped around me from behind as if a lover was begging a soulmate not to leave. The arms didn't even fully touch me. It felt like the goal of the hug was to show support to the peach fuzz on my body rather than my skin. The cold air hurt my nose as an aroma of a clean, floral scent submerged that sense. I felt‚Ä¶ Faith. As if my prayer did something. I realized what was happening, and fear overwhelmed the Faith. I spun around with my eyes shooting open, along with my fist gaining the torque of my torso, yet the fist never landed on a target. I was alone. ""Oh God.""

I can't breathe, I think I'm having a panic attack. I'm moving everywhere. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. I rush into the bathroom and rejuvenate my face with tap water. The warm water feels like a relaxed vacation to my pores. I catch my breath and lean against the counter with my head in my hands.¬†

Did God just reach out to me? I mean, I know about the bible and a lot about Christianity, but I have been very lenient with my commitment. Was that fear‚Ä¶ or something else? Vibrations echo into my shaking legs as Savior rubs against me. At the sight of the little creature consoling me, I pet the side of his head and begin to calm down.

Sleep calls me. I'm getting too overwhelmed for one night. I skip my nightly routine, no brushing teeth, the fan staying off, straight to the bedroom with a new goal before bedtime. I pick the cross out from under the dresser and hang it back up on the door. I slide into bed, my mind still trying to catalog everything that just happened. But before it could finish, sleep whisked me away.

*The cross I had carved used to stand as a header to his home. Confused, I peer around, taking in the surroundings. Perhaps I could find the culprit who did this. Straight ahead, behind the site, is the ridgeline. The smell of ammonia emanates from the trees that reach beyond Earth's gravity, acting as supports for the cosmos. Like splinters for some unfathomable behemoth, dormant beneath the permafrost of forgotten epochs. I shuddered at the thought of such a leviathan. The primordial titans from the glacial womb of the Paleozoic rising again to glut themselves upon the soft flesh of men, using these Appalachian monoliths to rake our bones from between their eldritch teeth. Drawn by compulsion or madness, I stepped over the ridgeline. The first move I make into the biome begins a chain reaction of tremors that shake the monoliths surrounding, scaring off any peering flesh in the process. I stand unevacuated. A Chthonian hut rises from the globe's jagged and warped skin. The hut, while small, seemed to be sculpted from obsidian frost that effused a vaporous purple. I cross the threshold of the structure and enter the tenebrous stomach of the woods. Inside was only void‚Äîno light, no sound, no time. A void that had always existed. That will always exist. Not mere absence, but a presence that consumes. An omnivorous nothingness, older than thought, deeper than death. I confidently embrace the absence, becoming atomized once fully enveloped.*

My eyes snapped open as I was flooded with a new curiosity I haven't felt since I was a child. Back when I was around 9, we moved into our new home, more towards the city. The house was a two-story building, the kind with the stairs that turn 180 degrees about halfway up. Every inch of the home, outside of the bathroom and kitchen, was covered in a new grey carpet that was comforting to lie on and play on. From the top of those stairs, I pushed a Lego semi truck over the edge and onto the stairs further down, closer to the first floor. When picking up the pieces, I discovered a little compartment underneath the side of the bottom steps.

Moving the thin wood that filled the slot, I discovered an entire area hidden under the stairs. The area was dark, other than the light I was letting in, so I went and grabbed a flashlight from my dad's toolbox. Once the light flicked on, I saw that the hidden area was covered in the same comforting grey carpet as the rest of the house. A place, discovered by me, where no one else thought to look. The feeling was an excited curiosity taking over my younger self. I felt the inner child make a comeback as I thought about the hut I saw in my dreams.

The timing worked out as today is my day off from work anyway. I attempted to roll out of bed, but there was resistance on my feet. My eyes barely peek over the comforter as I spot Savior sprawled across me, sound asleep. I waited a couple of minutes, and then a sneeze from his presence broke the silence of the room. He sprang up and leaped backwards to the other side of the bed. I took the opportunity to get up while I softly whispered, ""Sorry, go back to sleep, little guy.""¬†

Ash used to do the same thing, except he was closer to my waist rather than my legs. I would wake up and have to lie for so long, petting him before he decided it was time for me to start my day. His grey hair would be all over the comforter from how much he was stroked.

In the corner next to the dresser was the same can of half-opened wet food I had left out for Ash. It had changed. The label is missing circles all over it, as if someone has a dozen or so suction cups that rip the imagery off the can. Inside the can, though, it had been licked clean. I picked it up, only to have my hand be covered in what I assume was some type of thick spit. It emerged between my fingers when it finally clicked in me, and I tossed the can out of disgust.¬† I think Savior may have eaten the old meat and must've tried to spit it back out. The can slid under the bed from the launch, just barely scraping my bed frame with the popped-up tab. I couldn't count the number of times I've sliced my foot open with the serrated edge of the lid.

Too determined on my goal to care, I forget about the can and wipe my hands off on a towel from the laundry basket. I got my clothes on and myself mentally ready to head up the hill. I slide on my boots, attach my hunting knife to my belt, and walk out into the hallway.

The living room is left a mess from my freak-out last night. I'm surprised I didn't break anything. It's just resembling a receptionist desk that was abruptly left out of a long-awaited crashout. I pick up the papers and put them back on the coffee table, where my drawing from last night remains. Did I draw during the anxiety attack? Up at the ridgeline, it looks as if someone scribbled and then erased it. Scribbled and erased.

Scribbled and erased. Over and over. The paper is even weaker in this spot. That's not all. The bottom right of the picture, where an artist would sign their name, is not my name. Instead, it's marked with ""EXODUS 33:20"" in small, fine print. I pull up my phone and mutter the scripture out loud, ""Exodus 33:20 - You cannot see my face; for no man shall see me, and live.""¬†

The garage door makes its methodical movement upwards as it begins to open. The verse is still etching its place into my mind. The four-wheeler is just as I left it, ready to go. Wow, my laziness actually did save time. I pull out of the garage and start my ride towards the top. On the way, I keep reliving the trip I made a couple of days ago, but from a different perspective. Could there have been a hut up here the whole time? While my spade was boring into the Earth, could there have been this oddity just a couple of dozen yards away? Finally, I rise over the final lip of the hill and see my answer right before me.

It's actually there, I'll be damned. I click back into neutral, put the parking brake on, and the ride comes to a close. Hopping off the side and into the wet grass, I take in the sight. Just there, right inside the woods, is a hut. Maybe the size of your average kitchen. The walls are made of what looks like dirt, stone, and tree bark. It's as if a once-cobblestone hut had been decorated and rapidly aged by nature. I fully understand not seeing this structure the other day; it's practically camouflaged into its environment. The positioning is a perfect recreation of my dream. Approaching the hut, I make it a point not to stop, but to confidently strut inside and see what it holds for me.

It's incredibly empty. There are not even things scattered around; it is just empty. The walls are covered in moss, and the humidity in this stuffy room has to have at least jumped by 20%. The floor is squishy with a firm undertone from the stones peaking through the moist grass I walk on. In the center of the room, almost as if on cue, a stone falls in through the floor. My phone flashlight makes an appearance as I get down on one knee and look into the void. The light from my phone reaches no solid destination, only a fog. The vacant hole eats the light particles far before they ever land. Is there a basement to this hut? I take a deep breath through my nose to let out the most exaggerated sigh I could before being interrupted by my own bodily functions. I immediately started gagging as the air I just ingested came from this dirty, disgusting hole. It was like dirty dishes that had sat for a week, had sex with mildewed clothes, and gave birth inside a bag of Jack Links. Scrambling back to my feet, I paced out of the doorway, hoping never to experience that awful attack ever again.

Examining the hut further on the outside shows a lot of interesting stuff. Symbols are carved all over every rock and tree surrounding it. Not to mention the hut itself being tattooed with the same icons. Jagged edges and plentiful dots make up the symbols. I could not even fabricate an idea of what they mean.

My mind is trying to put together what this thing could be. What was its purpose? Who built it? Why is it on my property? Wait‚Ä¶ My property stops at the ridgeline. Realizing I have been trespassing, I walk back to my side of the hill, where I stand and stare some more before I finally realize what it is. I bet it's an all-natural toilet built way back when hunting was the only way to get food around here. That would explain why its materials started to be reacquired by nature and why it smells like- Oh god, I just realized I probably just smelled and looked into someone's ancient outhouse. Pushing those foul thoughts away, my eyes naturally looked back at the sad sight.

I sat in the grass next to the wooden cross representing him and just‚Ä¶ existed. I started to lean backwards, the blades of grass meeting my body from my legs, to my back, and finally to my head. Gravity has won its fight as I release the tension in my muscles. Staring into the sky while letting nature sing to me the hopes and despairs of the world. The endless azure stretches above me, within it, clumps of white reminiscent of frayed strings that move with methodical aimlessness. Just when I started to get a little too warm from the sun's display, the scent of petrichor overtook the odor that was stained in my nose as the wind began to blow. The smooth wind coursing through the wilderness like electricity in a far too advanced circuit caused an overwhelmingly distinct muffling of all other sounds around me. My autopilot ends. My brain molts into what it needs to be. I know how to see him again.

I could sleep here. I could sleep right here and let the Earth reclaim me as it is currently doing with what remained of my little buddy, just a couple of feet diagonally to me. I closed my eyes, not necessarily in prayer, but just to have a final word of reassurance.¬†

""Ash, you are the only family I have. You have been with me through my hardships. What kind of person would I be if I weren't with you through yours? I will travel with you through the afterlife as your guide. As your owner. As your family. All I need is a rope, and we will be linked forward and embrace what lies after.""

What sounded like hissing and a car driving over gravel screeched out behind me. I shoot up and spin to look at the hut. There's movement in there. I can't tell what it is exactly, but it's loud and vibrating. With my eyes only adjusted to the sunny outdoors, I only see shadows oscillating inside the dark room. Well, the only way to see what's happening is to venture forth.

I reappeared in the revolting hut, just standing barely in the doorway. From the hole in the floor, purple smoke fills the bottom inch of the room to heighten the arrival of its owner. The figure of greyscale static extended its single arm out of the chasm. Then the second arm followed, creating what looked like the shape of the letter M. Exodus 33:20 ran through my mind. My eyes locked onto my boots below me. On the off chance this thing was God, I'm going to take that verse as literally as I can just to be safe. What sounded like Velcro tearing assaulted my ears. The room grew darker, blocking out the doorway behind me with the thick vapor. The whole ordeal ended with what I can only describe as the noise a pimple would make popping under its own bloated pressure. My hands were shaking. Who was I in the presence of?

Silence was all that was spoken. I waited to hear my sins be told back to me in chronological order before I got damned. But nothing ever happened. No voice ever left the deity's breath as we stood in that standoff. My eyes were tracing the outline of my boots when, at the top of my peripheral vision, I could see His feet. I unintentionally locked eyes with them. I blinked at them, and from the biggest toe to the smallest, they blinked back. Fear holds hands with faith as I ask what I think I already know the answer to.

""God?"" No language came from him. However, there is a small hiss from him as the odorless smoke rises to my face. It smells of sweets along with a scent of burning. Reminding me of my past birthday parties, the smell brings me comfort. I'm going to assume that is a yes.

""What?"" The fog drops back down to reset the conversation between us. I catch my breath to ask a question, but my voice keeps trembling due to his presence.

""Do‚Ä¶ uh.. W-what do you want? Why are you here?"" The fog rises, and the smell of petrichor from the burial site reenters my nose from the fog.

""You want Ash, don't you? Are you going to escort him to the afterlife?"" The disgusting smell violates my senses again, making my eyes burn. This time, there's ammonia thrown in the mix.

Falling to the floor and covering my face with my hands, I can't catch my breath. Did I ask the wrong question? Why is the penalty so harsh if so? That was definitely a no. I stand back up, my eyes closed, teeth gritted together, and ask, ""Then what do you want with him?""

Without warning, the pungent aroma leaves. What replaced it was hope. My curiosity was stifled as I understood. I already knew his answer to my plea. We have the same goal. My prayer has been answered, and not even in a mysterious way, but in a way I can't deny. He has my faith now. Determined and with an unconcealed smile on my face, I leave the hut. A brew of amniotic fluid and afterbirth trails behind me.

Approaching the grave, I notice what looks like wet suction cups have been placed all over the top layer of earth. I took a handful of the dirt covering Ash and brought it back to the temple. I made sure to bow my head before entering. God is truly here. He's here and he needs my help with his plan. Mom always told me that Faith would pay off in the end. I lost it, but now I am reborn again. It was always God's plan to lead me to this point. I cast the dirt out from my palm in front of me. It hovers just beyond my hand's reach and gets pulled into his perfect being. He then closes the gap towards me, and I lose my breath out of awe at how fast he is. The smoke rises, covers my face, and results in me being disconnected from myself.¬†

My eyes open to the sight of my own eyes closed. I am looking at myself in the doorway. My back to the Holiest and my eyes set on his vessel. His hand of creation then pushes me back into myself, my face colliding without ever touching. The smoke levels back to the floor, and I am once again bowing my head to him.¬†

I don't know what I could have done to deserve this, but His Holiness embraces me. He's going to return my friend to me in this world, rather than me meeting him in the next. How compassionate! I am a receiver of the Father's unyielding love and care! His Divinity expelled the gas once more, and this time, it made me sneeze. ""As you command, Father."" There was only one thing I knew of that made me sneeze, the lost soul whom I welcomed into my home.",1,1753402032.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

We spent the night together and he was supposed to drop me off to my uncles place in the late afternoon next day When the next day came he said he‚Äôs going to drop me off in the morning which kind of bothered me. So then he said we can go out and eat breakfast in the morning together. I told him several times that I‚Äôm ready. He got up and just grabbed the coffee himself and showed up 30 minutes later. I was angry at him because I wanted to spend time with him and we were running out of time. He was on his phone and I think he didn‚Äôt listen. So I got mad and threw the coffee on the floor and yelled. He was mad but seemed ok because he started telling me how he‚Äôll marry me and tattoo our names and have kids with me. Two days later he broke up because of the coffee and apparently he didn‚Äôt like my body count. This was my first time throwing something and I did apologize to him. He also in the past cancelled several of my flights in the last minute which were his fault yet I still forgave him. Was this a good reason for him to leave me? ,1,1753401904.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

My storage is very far from the beach(I spend over an hour moving it if I get a flat tire), and I‚Äôve been pushing my coffee bike there every morning/evening. The thing is SO heavy + the tires keep going flat from me moving it so much, and the rain was drenching me, so yeah not ideal.



I‚Äôm trying to find a new indoor spot to sell my great coffee at, Just somewhere safe so I‚Äôm not dragging it back and forth so far every day but with a good amount of coffee buyers. I've been looking for ages but I can't find anything yet;/ Any ideas guys?

1m8kewk,https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerrunning/comments/1m8kewk/headaches_nausea_after_runs/,Headaches & Nausea after runs,"Anyone get headaches after runs?

I have been running consistently since May. I ran my first 10k a few weeks ago, and 7 miles last week. A few days a week, I run 2 miles in the morning and that takes me about 20 minutes. After my runs, 50% of the time I will develop a headache 5-6 hours later, which is around 11am/12pm.
By then, I would have had some breakfast like one of those Oikos protein yogurts with granola, about 0.5 L of water, and 1-2 cups of coffee or tea. Maybe the breakfast would have been 2 eggs with toast, or cereal with milk. I don't feel very hungry after my morning runs but I know I have to eat something for recovery.

The headaches are accompanied by gassy nausea and I have even less appetite then. My head gets foggy. I burp a little. I feel low energy and irritated at any stimulus. Since I sweat a lot when I run and it is very humid in the mornings, I figured it was electrolyte imbalance.

Here are some of the things I tried:
Drink more water, mix about 1/2 tablespoon of salt in my water, take a calcium/magnesium/zinc supplement, take a nap (only on weekends when I don't have work).

These helped slightly, but I still get the headaches and they still take me out of commission for the rest of the day. It really sucks and I almost want to quit running because I can't tolerate this. What else can I do?",1,1753401641.0,beginnerrunning,5,1.0,False

It was good the first year but the second year was torcher. It started half way through grade six and my stepmother got a call from my teacher saying I was behind in school work. When she got this news she talk with my dad and grounded me. This grounding lasted more then a yeah. The reason for this is that anytime I forgot too do something or did something wrong they would extend the grounding. Then seven months after the original grounding they sold my little sisters kitchen set ( she was three at the time and stop playing with it at the time). The next day the money they got from selling that and some of me and my little brothers old stuff( about 170 dollars cash which they put on top of the fridge) went missing. After my father got home and found out he said "" when I got out of the shower the money better be beside the coffee machine"". (For refernce my grounding at the time was doing a grade eight school textbook at the kitchen table all day long). When he got out of the shower and the money wasnt there he yelled at me immediately assuming that I stole the money.(to be clear after I said that I didn't take the money he calmly ask my siblings if they took the money. Witch they said no). For the next couple of weeks they would keep asking me and me only of i stole the money. Until one day my stepmother keep me home from school so we were the only two home. That day she pulled me out of the kitchen chair by my hair through me on the couch and started hitting repeatedly in the head and said"" tell me you stole the money or I'll beat you until you cant hear me yell"".  just so I could still hear I told her I did talk the money witch isn't true. When my father got home he talked to my step mother and came over to me asking me where rhe money was. My stepmother didn't tell him why I said that I took the money just that I told her I took the money all by myself. He didn't believe me after I told him what happened but after this she had her permission to punish me. ( these punishments included nealing on Gatorade bottle caps, being hit with a belt both the leather part and the metal buckle, and squatted against a wall for hours). This last for four months then when at school (I was in grade seven at the time) one of my biggest bruises showed from under my shorts and my two friends saw it. I beg them not to tell the teacher and told them I fell but they didn't believe me. As the weeks went on my bruises got blacker and bigger. Then my teacher saw us playing on my friends tablet and said that she was going to call my parents.witch caused me to have a mental breakdown in class. witch caused my friend to tell her later that day after she had called my stepmother. That day before I went home she made me tall her what was happening at home and she called cps without telling my parent. This caused the to hit me with the belt for a half hour. After this I didn't go to school for the rest of the year (they watched me do my school work on a tablet then after I was done they would take it. Then the cps called warning them that they would be there in two weeks. This was a mistake they had time to tell me and my siblings what to say, buy cteam that got rid of my bruises. They also told me that is cps took me away they would put me in a troubled boys home or in foster care and that people put there normally get set over seas in slavery or sex trade. (even boys). After cps finished and didn't see anything wrong my father patted me down and dropped me off at my mothers house. he said that he would be back after the weekend but that turned into 3 week but he didn't bring me back but brought my some clothes and left. After this he showed of 6 times in 3 years and he never gave back anything of my things. Thas is a true story what should I do.",2,1753401323.0,abusiveparents,0,1.0,False

1m8k9ka,https://www.reddit.com/r/selectivemutism/comments/1m8k9ka/i_need_help_and_advice_i_didnt_know_where_else_to/,"I need help and advice, i didnt know where else to go.","Hello, i am 16f. I just finished my gcses, which is really awesome, and that means i now move on to college/6th form. I have always struggled with social situations, speaking , etc, so I applied to my schools 6th form, so I can stay somewhere familiar with teachers and some people I know.

But, as my gcses are finished, I don't need to be in school, and so we are on an extended break until its time for us to start again in September, we came on break over a month ago now.

This is important, because over the past few years I've seen an increase in what I assume is anxiety, I'm also not diagnosed with anything, as my mother says its better to not be diagnosed than to be diagnosed, which I didn't understand, but it lead to an argument when I tried to push for a doctors appointment. She says it will be harder for me to get a job and things like that if I have a diagnosis? so, I'm just sticking with it, i suppose?

But, ever since we broke up from school, I've found I struggle to go outside greatly, and when i do, i find it almost, impossible to speak? almost as if it hurts to even try? Its like a feeling of worry and unfamiliarity, even if its somewhere I'm familiar with. I have a boyfriend of over 1 year, who is also 16, he goes to the same school and is obviously in the same year group, and ive found that when i go outside with him i can speak to him, though its very quiet and I still struggle to do even that much, it feels like im running out of words, in a way?.

This is embarrassing to admit, being 16 and all, but, often times when we go out, i bring my stuffed animal that ive had since the day i was born, obviously i hide it under my clothing (i wear a tight fitted long sleeve shirt and a baggy loose one overtop most times, if not its a hoodie) usually wedged underneath my arm so i can keep it in place, as i find it makes me feel alot less stressed, but, it still isnt enough. The times my boyfriend has convinced me to try without it i often lock in place, and struggle to move and speak if he isnt directly near me or holding my hand, and he well, obviously has to do all the talking for me as i cannot speak myself. I used to be really social and bubbly, and over the years i feel like ive shrunk, and im scared to even talk to teachers or even friends most of the time, that was before we split from school. But now, with being inside most of the time. Its not even like i was a bad student or got bad grades either, in all 5 years of school i got 2 detentions, only for homework, and on a scale of grades being 1 - 9, 9 being the best, i average at 6s and 7s, so i never had to ask for help in lesson, its just the teachers being friendly, and i struggle even to reply to that.

But, the main example i can think of, is me and my partner went to costa a few weeks ago, we walked there from my house, and, i dreaded even going outside, and the whole walk i was nervous, its a medium length walk through a forest, and even though there was nobody around, i still spoke quietly and struggled even to do so. But, when we got there, we went up to order, him taking charge and telling the sweet poor lady the order. I wanted a hot chocolate, my partner already knew that and so he asked for one, and a coffee for himself. We wait for a few minutes, this sweet lady looks at me and asks if id like whipped cream. I just stood there like a deer in headlights looking at her, and after a few seconds i just stared at the floor. I wanted to answer, i just couldn't. Its like the words ran away. My partner soon noticed and came to the rescue, telling the lady i didn't, and i felt so bad, when she turned to continue with the drinks i felt like i was going to cry, because i just couldn't even speak?. I even tried my best to shake my head but i dont think it was a noticeable enough shake because i could barely even move, and she carried on looking.

ive always struggled in social situations prior, i often used to cry if i was stressed and/or go silent, and the same if im upset or if there is an argument of any sort, it just felt like i would freeze up, almost as if i was just trapped?

And now i find that i cant speak to strangers, struggle to talk to friends unless my partner is present, dread going outside, and struggle to speak in any public setting if a person is even as much as in eyesight. It feels as if i just cant bear people being near.  Its as if they steal the words from me and it makes me feel so tense, so anxious?

ALSO!! i forgot to mention this, back around 5 all the way to 2 years ago when i was with previous partners, i used to go through what they both called nonverbal episodes, even around them id lose the ability to speak, and id struggle to move much aswell, which was strange 5 ish years ago as thats when i had less of an issue speaking, but it would happen. it intensified as the years went on, and intensified along with the feelings of anxiety and stress when in social situations or public at all. They have become much less frequent, they used to last a few hours, and  for the most part still often do, but i maybe see only a few a month, usually strangely short around my current partner, but sometimes when im alone (which is often as i dont go outside due to there being no school, and my family isnt the- greatest... so i dont spend time downstairs) just sat in my room, as there are days my partner obviously doesnt come, he comes once every 2 days with some exceptions, i often find myself being unable to speak, even when completely alone? its strange but, when im not around someone it still happens, which, doesnt make much sense really? but- im not an expert :,).

But, im now here to ask,

will this lead into selective mutism?

is this selective mutism?

What are the next steps?

How do i go about handling this in september when we return to school?

how do i explain this to teachers?

how do i make people understand?

Another point, there was a mute girl in my school a long time ago, for the first maybe 3 years? she was called lily. We were friends, but we didnt speak much, we were sat next to eachother in art class, and we used to speak on snapchat (i know, snapchat, ew, im 16 though, everyone is on there, nobody uses anything else :,). ) but, i remember she was always made fun of, picked on, teachers often forgot and read her name out on the register, and upon getting no reply would mark her absent, so i really need advice on what to do and how to make this easier for myself, do i email teachers? Do i carry around like, business cards that briefly explain it with a little sorry?? <- joking, obviously, unless that would do the trick...?

ANY ADVICE IS HELPFUL, PLEASE.

‚ÄúSo how bad was it?‚Äù JJ asked during the late breakfast, and Adam looked up at the sky for a second before answering.

‚ÄúOh, really bad. They tried the mother-father route. I‚Äôm sure they will spread that around.‚Äù Adam replied.

‚ÄúOh god. If they claim to be your parents in this sector, then some might take offence.‚Äù Evelyn said, and her parents looked confused at her.

‚ÄúHave you seen the ‚ÄòGalios lives‚Äô graffiti? ¬†Or hear anyone mention Galios?‚Äù

Maria nodded. ‚ÄúSome alien tried to give me a folder about Galios the Savior. I thought it was some sect.‚Äù

‚ÄúGalios is this guy that‚Äôs been prophesied to come and save the whole galaxy. He has many different names, but most just use Galios. And there are some idiots who think I‚Äôm him.‚Äù Adam said as he took a sip of his coffee. Both sets of in-laws look at their daughter.

‚ÄúNo, it's not some idiots; it‚Äôs a couple of trillion idiots spread around this sector. Anyway, this Galios guy is supposed not to have been born but made.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrillions? You're crazy, maybe a billion idiots,‚Äù Adam replied, and Maria crossed herself. Adam noticed and spoke softly to her.‚Äù I don‚Äôt believe this stupidity. I‚Äôm just Adam. It's just a stupid label they have put on me.‚Äù

She seemed to calm down, and JJ looked at him. ‚ÄúIs it because your‚Ä¶‚Äù He tried to find a way to sound sensitive but gave up. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have clones here?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, they have clones, and no, it's not just that. According to these prophecies, he is supposed to awaken a planet. I don‚Äôt know how you do that, and awaken gods. Then he would be killed.‚Äù

‚ÄúKilled? Oh my god. Are they going to kill you?‚Äù Maria looked worried, and Adam chuckled.

‚ÄúOh, they have tried a few times, managed once, but Evelyn saved me. She got her in the nick of time.‚Äù Adam commented.

‚ÄúWell, that was apparently also prophesied. So now everything he does turns out to be something that is prophesied. ¬†¬†¬†Free the slaves? Prophesied. Stop a war? Prophesied! Talk some sense into those who are still embroiled in a century-old civil war? Prophesied! Make the hyperlan safer for pirates? Prophesied!¬† Having twins? Prophesied! And do you know what I found out from¬† Monori?‚Äù She looked at Adam while her parents stared at them, shocked.

‚ÄúNo? What is she joking about now? Another prophecy?‚Äù Adam said, and Evelyn pointed her finger at the crib and the twins.

‚ÄúIt was prophesied that they would be born in the universe. In fact, all my ten children will be born up there!‚Äù

‚ÄúWait? ten?‚Äù Maria said, shocked, and Adam started to laugh.

‚ÄúYes, Mom, because these stupid prophecies also involve me and my kids. ¬†I‚Äôm supposed to have nine kids here and one last somewhere far from here. ¬†From her line come the heroes. From the nine other comes the royals of the Fuc.. of the Galaxy. Its ‚Ä¶.‚Äù ¬†She was getting upset now and then took a deep breath.

‚ÄúWow, and people believe this?‚Äù JJ asked, and Adam sighed as he nodded.

‚ÄúThey also believe Roks is a God of war. My whole council is supposedly filled with gods. I'm supposed to attract sleeping gods like bees to honey. None of us truly believes it. It's just annoying. Anyway, if those two idiots start spreading that they are my parents, then they might stir up some big problems. Actually, it's good you hear it from us first and not turn on the news and learn about it through one of those stupid debate programs.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou used to love them back on Earth,‚Äù JJ said, and Adm smiled.  
‚ÄúYes, I did, and I would love to debate ideas and silly things. But if I show up.. well, when I spoke to the galactic senate, the first question I got was ‚ÄòAre you Galios?‚Äô and I had informed them I had ordered a raid on a pirate base inside another kingdom's border. That question was more important than the raid.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if somebody believes them and comes after you for heresy?‚Äù JJ asked, his concern was showing.

‚ÄúI have never acknowledged that I‚Äôm Galios, never will. So if they believe them and claim it's not Galios, then they agree with my position on the matter.‚Äù Adam replied, but JJ seemed to still worry.

‚ÄúWhat if people start fighting over it? This is how religious Jihads and crusades start.‚Äù

Adam looked at him, and then it sank in. ‚Äúfuck.. Oh sorry‚Ä¶¬† Shh.. I need to make some calls. Please excuse me.‚Äù He got up and headed to the office to contact Monori and Arus. He could feel Evelyn's worry and hear her discussion as she tried to explain the matter further.

Monori answered from the library. Arus was working in the background. He told them he needed to speak with both, and if they could find Sig-San, that would also be beneficial.¬† Then he got a speeder and headed over as he checked the news. Nothing big, even the pirates kept quiet now, the biggest news was Jorks new park and his Kajiu drones.¬† Adam was glad there was nothing about him, and when he arrived at Sistun, he headed straight to the library, where Monorie was waiting with both Arus and Sig-San.

‚ÄúYou seem to be worried? Do we need to get Roks too?‚Äù Sig-San said, and Adam shook his head.

‚ÄúNo, I need you all for different reasons. I actually need¬† Monori to go through the ¬†prophecies and check if there is anything about somebody claiming to be Galios' parents.‚Äù

They all looked at each other, a little worried. ‚ÄúWhat? Don‚Äôt tell me.. shit, just tell me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, yes, there is the twin ‚Äòdragon‚Äô that will spew poison. A poison that almost starts a jihad, ‚ÄòThe jihad that never comes.‚Äô The dragon reigns for ten years, then is killed by Burimo.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait? What?‚Äù Adam looked shocked at her.

‚ÄúA dragon?¬† With two heads? What culture has this one?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Buskar tale mainly, but traces are in the Wossir and Scisya tales as well. Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúShit... My donors are the administrators of the Banking Colony. The Myr-88 system. They are probably going to change it.¬† They are the reason I‚Äôm buying up the other systems. I don‚Äôt want more people like them near me. Anyway, I had a meeting with them and they tried to play the mother and father act.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe two-headed dragon, shit. You are going to be busy.‚Äù Sig-San said, and Adam just agreed.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I think these prophecies are true, but my father-in-law warned me they could cause trouble with the religious zealots. And for that, I need you two to keep an eye on them and keep them distracted.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, they are your parents, right? I mean, you call them donors?‚Äù Arus asked, and Adam smiled.

‚ÄúThey cloned us from some hair and nail clippings. They didn‚Äôt even bother with a Blood sample. They got that reminding DNA from somebody else; we all have a different third donor, hence why we are a little different. So, calling them more than donors is a stretch. They didn‚Äôt raise us or care for us. I was, after all, only spare parts for them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is the third Donor?‚Äù Arus asked, and Adam shrugged.

‚ÄúNobody knows. It was never registered. Probably the cloner or something lying around. It's unimportant.¬† The important thing is that those two can cause something stupid by going around claiming they are my parents, because people might think I grew up with those bastards.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow many secrets do you have?‚Äù Sig-San asked, surprised. You're not a clone; you're engineered if there are three donors. We are going to Hara to find out just how you got put together!‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd how will that help?‚Äù Adam asked.

‚ÄúWell, if you have three different strands of DNA, then nobody can claim they are your biological parents. Humans are, after all, created by two. You're not Ghorts.‚Äù Monori said.

‚ÄúOkay? So how will that help? It will just fuel the stupid Galios prophecies.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou've got to choose now. Because saying nothing will aid their claim. Proving them wrong might stop them.‚Äù Arus said. ‚ÄúLook, we do this, and you do some interviews with the most popular debate programs. Yeah, I know you hate it. But you can calm people down and remind them how you don‚Äôt believe the prophecies. You must start refuting the rumors unless you want them to spread like wildfire. We can have you introduce Dirt on an interview with Yun Flysam. He is one of the biggest debaters out there, and an atheist, just what you need.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. Let‚Äôs get it done.‚Äù Adam said, but he knew Evelyn wouldn't like it. He didn‚Äôt like the options.

Arus called him a few hours later, telling him the interview was set up for the weekend, but he had to go to the hub. ¬†With the new gateway, it would be a ten-minute jump. He could spare a few hours for this madness. It will just be a short interview after all.

‚ÄúDamn six donors? You‚Äôre a fricking jigsaw!‚Äù Yun laughed as he drank the whiskey Adam had brought.

‚ÄúYeah, Hell, I didn't even know that. That‚Äôs much more than I thought, too. The guys who ordered me apparently gave me the looks. But that‚Äôs what happens when you order from scam artists.‚Äù Adam chuckled.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just weird, man. Do you know who the others are?‚Äù

‚ÄúNaw. I sent it back home to check the registration, but I don‚Äôt expect anything. I don‚Äôt think these donors were in the system.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know some will use this as proof that you are‚Ä¶ do I dare say it? Galios?‚Äù

Adam laughs. ‚ÄúThey made tons of us. There are over a hundred that were made by the same company and are just as big a jigsaw as mine. So by that accord, we all are Galios.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, but how many of them have died and come back just to get a sexy wife? I mean, I have seen your Queen.‚Äù Yun replied and took another sip of the whiskey. ‚ÄúAnd damn, this is addictive. I need a case of this.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat can be arranged as for being shot. Come on. You‚Äôre a Tufons. You know there is a difference between being shot and dying.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I know,‚Äù Yun pulls up his shirt, where there is a nasty-looking scar. ‚Äú A Haran almost pulled out my heart here and pulled up his pant leg. ‚ÄúShot by a Wossir pirate. God damnit, those were the days. Hey, I remember you jumped into the Caran at King Steinar's wedding party. What the hell were you thinking?‚Äù Yun asked.

‚ÄúThat I stood too near to the edge, and Roks is an asshole.‚Äù¬† Adam laughed. Yun burst out laughing as well.

‚ÄúYeah, he is truly a beast. Now I don‚Äôt believe in the gods, but damn. His fight? Or should I say fight? You have seen his fight with the former Karn, right?‚Äù Yun said, and¬† Adm shook his head.

‚ÄúNo, I was too embarrassed. We were guests, and he sent him to the infirmary.‚Äù

‚ÄúQuark.. play the hologram.. You got to see this... ¬†Look at that reaction, not flinching at the whip.‚Äù The hologram popped up, and Adam saw how Roks went berserk on Vorts father.

‚ÄúWell, he is quite impressive. I had no idea he was this strong when I met him.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did you guys meet?‚Äù Yun asked, and Adam started to tell the short version of the story. Yun kept digging as that story led to Dirt, which led to the building, volcanoes, ¬†and that led to the park, then back to pirates, slavers, and the colony status.

‚ÄúNow, I have heard you guys sent somebody into the deadlands with a ship that has a wormhole gate?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, a good friend of mine went. And yes, he had a gate with him, a small one with a range of a hundred light years. ¬†He is aiming for a system sixty light years away. ¬†If he is successful, then we have a gate through the desert.‚Äù Adam replied, and Yun looked at him curiously.

‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs on the other side?‚Äù

Adam winked. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we are trying to find out.¬† But, my guess is that there are more systems. Some are probably suitable for colonization. Probably some cultures as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have heard rumors that‚Äôs where the ancients live,‚Äù Yun said, and Adam smiled.

‚ÄúThen I hope they are nice and don‚Äôt judge us for some small mistakes. Kids make mistakes after all.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think they judge us?‚Äù Yun said, surprised.

‚ÄúI think that the older somebody gets, the more they cling to the past and live on memories. Forgetting their own wild sides, they scold younger ones for what they did themselves when younger. If people are like this, then why wouldn't cultures? Haran and Tufons tend to act as everybody‚Äôs big brother and sister.‚Äù Adam said, and Yun laughed.

‚ÄúYes, we do. You are absolutely correct. Damn, I would love to have you one with some of the religious experts. You are not what I would expect.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh? What did you expect? A holy man speaking in riddles?‚Äù Adam replied.

‚ÄúYeah, well, something more ‚Ä¶ I mean. ‚Äú he looked at Adam. ‚ÄúYou just got this strange vibe. I mean, it's like you‚Äôre a king but are totally chilled with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I am a king, not by choice, so I don‚Äôt really care about the title,‚Äù Adam replied.

‚ÄúYes, that might be it. It's just weird. I can see why so many feel relaxed around you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs a good thing, right? No point in starting trouble. I just want everybody to get along and be true to reach our full potential.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a noble goal. I wish we could talk for a few more hours, but your aide has been checking the time a couple of times here. We are already over a hour overdue.‚Äù Yun replied.

‚ÄúWe are? Damn, time flies. Yeah, he got me on a tight schedule. ¬†Besides, my wife would kill me if I came home too late.‚Äù Adam laughs as they both get ready to leave.

I‚Äôve been into the hobby for a few years now, I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to try a variety of different combinations of equipment and coffee types, and think I‚Äôm at a stage where I feel like I have a general idea of what I like.

90% of the time, what I make daily is a straight shot, typically the traditional 2:1 give or take a bit, and 1-2 v60‚Äôs. Generally, I‚Äôm buying med-light roasts, from a variety of roaster, lately I‚Äôve really enjoyed what I‚Äôve got from DAK. I think I fall somewhere in the middle of taste profile, I like the thick chocolatey syrup shots, but also clear fruit flavours. For pour overs I typically prefer something fruity, or an extremely clean well rounded and blended cup. I guess I appreciate and want both.

I‚Äôm looking to replace my DF64 Gen 2, as I‚Äôm not entirely happy with it. The two contenders for me right now are either the Lagom Casa (had one of the best cups ever with this thing) and a philos (seems like you get p64/Zerno quality coffee for less). I haven‚Äôt seen much in terms of comparison between the two, so I‚Äôm looking for opinions. I‚Äôm open to other suggestions though. I have an m47 and c40, so that‚Äôs swaying me towards the philos, mostly because I already have grinders with that conical profile, and don‚Äôt want to loose some of what the df gives me in terms of profile.

So happy!,"Trying to turn a recipe into something else is generally not a good idea and 9/10 times you're better finding a recipe that does the thing you want... but after a run of unsatisfying chocolate cake tests of a bunch of different highly rated recipes I was determined to convert my favourite vanilla cake to chocolate, and I am over the moon that I actually figured it out this time!

My favourite ever vanilla cake is this hot milk cake from KAF, with cake flour instead of AP and a little less salt than specified: https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/chef-zebs-hot-milk-cake-recipe 

I just love the technique so much, its so fast to make, no need for creaming room temp butter or buying sour cream. I always have everything on hand to make this.

I tried to convert it to chocolate in the past with quite blah results. Interestingly, I feel like things worked better this time around because I was a bit more risk taking with conversion rules. This is a big deal for me as I am massive stickler for rules and love the precision of baking for this reason, but definitely lacked confidence around recipe tweaking and experimentation as a result.

Normally people say to convert vanilla batter to chocolate by replacing 1/4-1/3 of the flour with cocoa but I had a feeling a 50% 50% mix would work and it did! I couldn't find clear rules on how much solid chocolate to add so I just put in an amount that was easy to measure, 1/4 the weight of the sugar in the recipe. Increased salt and vanilla, added coffee powder, cinnamon. Test 1 was a perfectly chocolatey cake, flavours way better than other recipes I'd made, just a little dense which wasn't surprising given the drying effect of cocoa and chocolate. I figured I needed to increase the milk and wondered if I should be conservative at first, but instead just doubled it because that seemed like the right vibe. And it was! Test 2 was a perfect texture identical to the fluffiness and lightness of the original vanilla version.

Just wanted to share this victory of baking intuition! I still think recipe reworks require a lot of caution and leaning on rules as needed if you even attempt them, but I also feel great that all the time I've spent baking means I have some intuitive understanding that can be put to use for adapting recipes!",3,1753400882.0,Baking,0,1.0,False

They‚Äôll say Anne Burrell died of ‚Äúacute intoxication.‚Äù They‚Äôll rattle off the chemicals like it‚Äôs a recipe: diphenhydramine, cetirizine, amphetamine, ethanol. But that‚Äôs not a cause. That‚Äôs a symptom. That‚Äôs the garnish on a plate of despair.

Anne died the same way too many in this industry do - not from drugs, but from accumulated silence. From being too good at pretending everything‚Äôs fine until the pretending becomes a permanent condition.

I worked in restaurants for over a decade. Not as a chef or a cook - I was a QA and expo, the middleman between the kitchen‚Äôs fire and the dining room‚Äôs fantasy. The translator. The pressure valve. The one who kept the plates coming, the servers sane, and the cooks from killing each other.

I also served. I‚Äôve bussed tables, memorized allergy lists, juggled side work, smiled through grief. I‚Äôve been screamed at by cooks and threatened by guests. I‚Äôve cried in the walk-in, slammed shots after a rough close, and kept coming back because that‚Äôs just what you do. How many times have we said we‚Äôre built for this shit?

And when I wasn‚Äôt on the floor? I was in classrooms. I have a Master‚Äôs degree in counseling. Trauma-informed. Violence-prevention specialist. Which is why I can say this with confidence:

The restaurant industry is a suicide machine with a soundtrack.

‚ÄîThe Kitchen Is a War Zone with a Dress Code‚Äî

It‚Äôs always hot. Always loud. Always urgent. The expo line is a tightrope - one foot in fire, one in ice. You hear the cooks cracking in one ear, the servers spiraling in the other, and you‚Äôre expected to smile while your own insides twist like overcooked pasta.

Everyone‚Äôs exhausted. Everyone‚Äôs high, hungover, or hurting. And the solution is always the same: keep moving.

You sprain your ankle? Shift‚Äôs still on.

You lose a friend? Grieve on break.

You‚Äôre suicidal? Have a shot and shake it off.

Anne wasn‚Äôt weak. She was a master at performance. Big voice. Big laugh. Big energy. The kind of presence that fills a room - and hides the emptiness just behind it.

So was Bourdain. Cantu. Violier. Strode. Cerniglia. Marks.

And so are thousands of others. Ones whose names we‚Äôll never know. Ones still showing up to make your birthday dinner, your anniversary special, your takeout order right.

‚ÄîThey Feed the World While Starving Themselves‚Äî

There‚Äôs rarely health insurance. No therapy. Little paid time off. You‚Äôre working doubles just to stay broke. You‚Äôre medicating with whatever‚Äôs around - coffee, coke, pills, Red Bull, fireball shots, adrenaline, approval. The Monster and a cigarette shift meal is more than a meme - it‚Äôs a reality. 

And when you finally sit still?
It hits.
All of it.
The pace kept it away. But now you feel how lonely you are. How bruised. How disposable.

And maybe that‚Äôs the shift you don‚Äôt come back from.

‚ÄîWhat I Know - As a Worker and a Counselor‚Äî

This isn‚Äôt about willpower. It‚Äôs about culture. Infrastructure. Trauma stacked on trauma until it becomes identity.

Most cooks are wounded healers. They feed others to feel useful. Worthy. Needed. Because the world hasn‚Äôt offered them much else. They nurture and show love with every single plate.

You can‚Äôt therapy your way out of a toxic job. Just like you can‚Äôt meditate your way out of poverty. This system is sick.

You don‚Äôt have to work the grill to get burned. Expo sees everything. Servers absorb trauma with a smile. Hosts get harassed. Bussers and barbacks go home invisible.

Substance abuse in restaurants isn‚Äôt a party - it‚Äôs anesthesia. Dying to live, as the song goes.

People don‚Äôt ‚Äúbreak‚Äù - they wear down. Like aprons too long in the wash. Like knives never sharpened.

‚ÄîSo What Do We Do?‚Äî

If you run a restaurant:
-Pay for therapy, or at least offer it. Mental health stipends over merch.
-Kill the ‚Äúwe‚Äôre a family‚Äù lie if you‚Äôre not willing to grieve like one.
-Train managers in trauma response - not just inventory spreadsheets.

If you‚Äôre a guest:

-Say thank you like you mean it. Your boorish comments and corny jokes can be saved for later.
-Don‚Äôt be the reason someone‚Äôs faking a smile while unraveling.

Would love any kind of critique, plus I think some people here might think it's pretty fun. Let me know what you think either way!





**NOVEMBER 27, 1998 - 5:30 A.M.** 



Nelson‚Äôs alarm clock went off before the sun had risen. He was already awake, though, and had been staring at the ceiling in anticipation. It was finally Saturday. He rolled over and hit the off button. 

In the dark room, he stood and began to throw on the clothes he had set aside the night before; a blue polo that breathed easily and a light sweater with khaki cargo pants and a pair of dockers. You have to wear dockers when going out on a boat, Mr. Faulkner had once told him. 

Before the red digital numbers on his clock read 6:00 he was grabbing the backpack in the kitchen of his parents' winter beach house. He had stuffed it full of Thanksgiving leftovers and drinks he had prepared for the journey that lay ahead. *Should hold us over well enough*, Nelson thought to himself. He scribbled a quick ‚ÄúLove you‚Äù atop the stack of post-its sitting next to the fridge and slid through the front door. 

He could see a maroon Honda swing around the bend in the predawn light and cruise towards him as he made his way down the stoop. Harvey came to a stop in front of him with Gayle in the passenger seat. ‚ÄúRise n‚Äô shine, Nelly!‚Äù he called across his girlfriend and through the open passenger window. 

Nelson slapped the roof of the car. ‚ÄúCoffee first, then shine all you want.‚Äù He opened the back door and ducked in with his bag.

‚ÄúThey have coffee at The Dockyard,‚Äù Harvey informed him, ‚Äúthink you can make it there.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI guess I can manage.‚Äù He nudged the back of Harvey‚Äôs seat and said, ‚ÄúDrive on driver.‚Äù

The Honda's belts squealed as Harvey brought them out of the relatively well-to-do neighborhood and brought them onto the highway towards the small supplies shop that was The Dockyard. 

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt all have to go in, do we?‚Äù Gayle asked.

Harvey shrugged. ‚ÄúWell, I guess you can stay in the car, but I think you should at least use the girls' room before we set off. You know you don't like using the bathrooms out on Ole Gate.‚Äù

She sighed. ‚ÄúI guess. I just don‚Äôt like being around the dude who runs it.‚Äù

‚ÄúMr. Faulkner?‚Äù Nelson chimed in from the back seat. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with him?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been really creepy this last year. Like staring at me in a weird way.‚Äù

Harvey laughed and grabbed at her leg. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cause you *hawt*.‚Äù

She let out a playful yelp and batted at his hand. ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù

Harvey persisted and continued to sing-song, ‚ÄúYou hawt, you hawt.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCut it out, Harvey!‚Äù She batted away more sternly, and he acquiesced. Gayle caught her breath and continued. ‚ÄúNot looking like that. He...I don't know. He almost looked sad.‚Äù

Nelson‚Äôs brow furrowed. He only saw the old man a few days every year, but he was a familiar face in a place far from home. 

‚ÄúHey now,‚Äù Harvey reached around and flicked Nelson‚Äôs knee. ‚ÄúNone of that. My dad‚Äôs letting us take the Cecilia out to Ole Gate, so no moping. This is gonna be a sick trip with beer and food and it‚Äôs gonna be awesome. Got it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, yeah I got it.‚Äù Nelson stowed his concerns away and idly checked his bag of supplies. *Sick indeed, Nelly*. He smirked. Here he was 22, with his friends, on his way to an island. What could go wrong?

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Harvey announced as they pulled into one of three empty spots at The Dockyard. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get your coffee, get some gas, and burn some ass.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat does that even mean?‚Äù Nelson asked as he unbuckled his seat belt.

Harvey thought for a moment and then said, ‚ÄúI dunno.‚Äù

They filed into the small shop single file with Nelson bringing up the rear. Before the door could close behind him, he could hear Faulkner‚Äôs booming, southern voice. ‚ÄúWell, lookit what the tide brought in. Here to gather up some materials for ya trip?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes sir,‚Äù Harvey answered and jutted a thumb behind him. ‚ÄúAnd to grab Nelly some coffee.‚Äù

Nelson made his way around the kiosk holding magnets and postcards and gave a small wave. ‚ÄúMorning, Mr. Faulkner.‚Äù

As the old man‚Äôs gray-blue eyes fell on him he saw the look Gayle had meant. They sagged at the sight of him, the crows‚Äô feet deepened as Faulkner‚Äôs eyebrows lowered. ‚ÄúAh, didn‚Äôt know they was bringin‚Äô you along. Thought your folks decided to stay down in Florida this year.‚Äù

Nelson shoved his hands in his pockets and shrugged. ‚ÄúWe were talking about it, but ya know how it is. This place is just too good to pass up.‚Äù He offered a good-natured smile

Faulkner did not return one in kind, but simply said, ‚ÄúYep.‚Äù He then turned his back and began to tinker with something behind the counter. 

Nelson shot Harvey and Gayle a look, but Harvey just shrugged and made a face, *eh, who knows*. 

Nelson decided to grab the coffee quickly and get back out to the car and away from the nadir of Mr. Faulkner. He made his way through the cramped aisles of t-shirts, Powerade, and candy bars to the two-pot coffee maker. He poured a cup and snapped the lid on. Before making his way back to the counter, he looked to see if Harvey could spot him for the coffee, but neither Harvey nor Gayle were anywhere to be seen. *Probably doing more than peeing in the restroom*. He rolled his eyes and headed to the counter, unhappy with being forced to interact with Faulkner while he was in such a foul mood.

Nelson preemptively grabbed his wallet and set his coffee on the counter. Faulkner keyed in his purchase without looking up. The old man was never one for idle chatter, but the full silent treatment felt oddly cold. Finally, Nelson broke the silence as his change was handed back. ‚ÄúYou ok, Mr. Faulkner?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep,‚Äù he said again, as if little more than a stranger. His light blue eyes flicked to Nelson‚Äôs and then away again. ‚ÄúY‚Äôall are headin‚Äô to Ole Gate, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYessir, we are.‚Äù

‚ÄúFog‚Äôs not gonna let up today.‚Äù Faulkner stared out the window into the dawning morning. 

‚ÄúHuh, I didn‚Äôt know it was supposed to fog up at all. Is that normal for this time of year?‚Äù

‚ÄúMhmm.‚Äù The old man continued to stare out the window. 

Nelson waited for Faulkner to elaborate. After the silence continued, he turned to leave.

‚ÄúYou a pray, son?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù Nelson stopped and looked back at Faulkner, whose steely eyes were now locked on him.

‚ÄúI said, do you pray?‚Äù

Nelson mulled the odd question over for a bit. ‚ÄúMaybe not as much as I should, but I'd say me and my folks are God fearing.‚Äù

A solemn moment hung between them. Finally, Faulkner said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more than God to be fearin‚Äô in those waters, boy.‚Äù



**7:00 A.M.**



They pulled into the marina, Gilded Shores, as the sun broke the horizon. Nelson shook his head as he stared over the murky chop of sea and into the hazy morning. As sure as the sun rose in front of him out East, fog had settled in. The Cecilia bobbed in the wake against the dock as water lapped up against the wooden posts. 

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll be damned,‚Äù Harvey said with his hands on his hips. He surveyed the thicker plumes of fog that sat away from the shoreline farther out to sea. ‚ÄúI guess the old man was right.‚Äù

Gayle wrapped her hands around his arm. ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs safe to go out still?‚Äù

He gave a proud chuckle. ‚ÄúOf course! Look, you can still see Ole Gate straight out.‚Äù He pointed out into the thickening soup of clouds. 

Nelson squinted and, after a moment of searching, the mass began to appear. He caught sight of the tree line first and then a faint hint of the shore below them, two or so miles away. He swallowed the nervous lump that had formed in his throat. For the past ten years he and his parents had flown to Minswhick, South Carolina for winter break. It had been a mainstay that he made the short trek across the straight to Ole Gate with Harvey‚Äôs family. Every year prior, the skies had been clear, the air crisp, and the sea inviting. This was not only the first time they were to make the journey without Harvey‚Äôs father at the helm, but also the first time Nelson had seen such dour weather greet them. 

His eyes wandered back down to the chop of the ocean. Shelves of foam broke over top of each other above a chasm of black marble water. The sea churned unto itself, back and forth from beneath the dock. Then a voice lit through his mind, *the darkness dances*.

Nelson was startled from his reverie by Harvey patting him on the back. ‚ÄúYou ok, bud? Not gonna go all landlubber on us, are you?‚Äù

Nelson quickly threw on a smile and shrugged. ‚ÄúNah, just thinking through everything I brought.‚Äù He slung his bag onto his shoulder and nodded towards the Cecilia. 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do it!‚Äù Harvey exclaimed.

Then a voice rang across the dock from behind them. ‚ÄúHey you all!‚Äù

They turned to see Richard Hoskins, the middle-aged, plump man who owned the Gilded Shores. He waved as he waddled his way toward them from his small office building across the way. 

‚Äú‚ÄòMorning Mr. Hoskins,‚Äù Gayle said as the man came to a wheezing stop before them. ‚ÄúAre you ok?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yes,‚Äù Hoskins replied as he wiped at the sweat forming on his brow with his sleeve. He nodded at Harvey and Gayle before letting his eyes rest on Nelson. He regarded Nelson with a darkness that recalled Faulkner earlier that morning. ‚ÄúYour daddy gave me the heads up that you two‚Äôd be heading out ‚Äòcross the straight today. Didn‚Äôt say nothin‚Äô about you?‚Äù

Nelson‚Äôs eyebrows raised. ‚ÄúOh? Is that an issue?‚Äù

Hoskins‚Äô mouth twitched into a smile and then resumed its downward tilt. ‚ÄúNot at all, not at all. Surprises are just...surprising is all.‚Äù

Nelson slowly nodded. ‚ÄúUh, huh. Makes sense.

A long silence stretched between them as Hoskins breathed heavily through his nose. His brow was furrowed deep in thought, as if considering some important sales proposition. Finally, he let out a sigh. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll leave you all to it. Harvey, you know what you‚Äôre doin‚Äô so just don‚Äôt get too cocksure in the fog, alright son?‚Äù

Harvey gave an enthusiastic thumbs-up. ‚ÄúYes sir.‚Äù

Hoskins gave a quick nod that made his second chin jiggle. He gave Harvey an assuring pat on the shoulder and began to walk back to his office across the lot. After a few steps he paused as a thought struck him and turned back to them. ‚ÄúDid y‚Äôall happen across anyone else this morning by chance?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe stopped at The Dockyard,‚Äù Gayle answered, visibly confused.

Hoskin‚Äôs eyes grew dark. ‚ÄúOh? Y‚Äôall have a chat with Mr. Faulkner?‚Äù

The three shrugged and exchanged a glance. ‚ÄúWell yeah,‚Äù she replied.

He nodded again. ‚ÄúRight, well best leave you to it.‚Äù Then he promptly turned and disappeared into his office.

The three remained in silence for a moment. Finally, Nelson spoke up. ‚ÄúSo is it just me or is everyone being kind of weird today?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, I guess?‚Äù Harvey said, nonplussed.

A shadow passed over Gayle‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúI told you Mr. Faulkner has been weird, but today was the first time I‚Äôd seen Mr. H like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Harvey grabbed their shoulders and squeezed. ‚ÄúQuit letting a couple of people bring the day down. We got this!‚Äù

Nelson sighed. ‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre right.‚Äù But deep in the pit of his stomach he wasn‚Äôt so sure. *Something is off this year*, he thought to himself, *and something bad is going to happen*. As his state of mind dipped, a chill ran up his spine. 

‚ÄúSo let‚Äôs go!‚Äù Harvey jumped aboard the Cecilia and set about unmooring the boat from the dock‚Äôs cleats. Gayle followed suit, but Nelson paused. For a moment, he hesitated to step from the assuredness of the dock across the darkness below. *It dances‚Ä¶*



**7:30 A.M.**



The Cecilia was a modest vessel as an 18 foot V-hull with four seats and a single engine. It was capable of making the run across the straight in no time under favorable conditions. The further they traveled from the mainland, though, the thicker the fog grew. Harvey had slowed the boat as he kept his eyes trained on Ole Gate‚Äôs tree line, now barely visible.

Gayle had taken the seat next to Harvey and both of their shoulder-length hair blew in the wind. It seemed that once they had made it into the water, Gayle had begun to relax while Nelson‚Äôs mind only raced more. He stared into the dark water and tried parsing out what Faulkner had said. *There‚Äôs more to fear*‚Ä¶

Nelson had made the trip across the strait every year with Harvey‚Äôs family; locals who had befriended his parents through business dealings. Never once had it been a matter to fear. The trip was only a few miles and the island was well kept up by the county. Yet as he stared into the murky depths speeding by below him, he couldn‚Äôt help but think there was some danger to be found. The water seemed malevolent, almost, as the boat cut through. It whispered back in its hiss against the hull, *this time you‚Äôre mine*. 

He clenched his jaw and slowly exhaled through his nose. *Quit psyching yourself out, Nelly. You‚Äôve grown up on the water*. Yet his mind whirled as he stared into the ocean. Normally it was a crisp and clear blue, but in the fog it hid secrets in its dark, *it dances*. The voice from the dock returned to his mind. *And you‚Äôll join in step, Nelly*.

‚Äú-Yo Nelly you awake?‚Äù Harvey's voice called from in front of him.

He looked up and saw they were approaching Ole Gate. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said, eager to be on solid ground again.

Gayle cocked her head as she looked at him, concerned. ‚ÄúYou feelin‚Äô a little sick?‚Äù

He shrugged, ‚ÄúMaybe. I think the fog is messing with me.‚Äù

She nodded in agreement. ‚ÄúYeah, kind of makes everything a little spooky.‚Äù

Harvey slowed the boat to a crawl as they approached the shoreline. He pulled the boat expertly into place and they began to bob in sync with the floating dock. It took only a few moments for Nelson to realize that there were no other boats docked with them and that they were presumably alone on the island. 

The chop slapped angrily against the boat and Nelson found himself staring into its depths once again. He envisioned himself stepping across the small gap and a flurry of teeth erupting up at him to drag him back below. 

‚ÄúEarth to Major Tom.‚Äù Harvey‚Äôs voice, once again, broke him from his thoughts. Nelson looked up to see genuine concern on Harvey‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúSeriously, are you ok?‚Äù

Nelson threw his bag onto the dock and rushed across. ‚ÄúYeah. I, um...I just have this odd feeling‚Ä¶‚Äù He looked into the sky as he trailed off. The fog had settled over any visible part of the island and only a few buildings stood out from the mainland across the strait.

‚ÄúWell, let‚Äôs just find a place to sit down and relax a little, right?‚Äù Harvey searched his eyes for a moment.

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Nelson agreed, laying his apprehension aside. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

They made their way inland on a trail of sand worn into the grass from frequent use. The treeline stood tall and dark in the fog. Nelson had made the trek for years. He knew that they would follow the trail into the forest to find a very well kept picnic area that hosted a large gazebo, a few grills affixed to the ground, and a set of public restrooms; a perfectly reasonable and even, at times, wonderful camping ground. As they submerged themselves in the thick green of foliage, though, he found the trees suffocating. What little sunlight had breached the unrelenting cloud cover was choked further into submission by the thick blanket of limbs and leaves above. Silence dampened the air around them the further they ventured in. Soon, even the hushed breaking of waves was gone and only the occasional snap of a twig below their feet remained.

The clearing appeared as they rounded a bend in the trail and, for a moment, Nelson was struck with confusion. Had they taken a wrong turn? Was that even possible as there were no forks in the trail to deviate from? They stood at the mouth of a large circle of open grassy space that resembled that of the normal camping ground, but instead of venues for cooking and playing horseshoes they found a large stone disk in the middle of the field. To their right an odd grouping of massive boulders laid against each other.

‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù Gayle asked. Manicness crept through her words. ‚ÄúDid we go the right way?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course we did,‚Äù Harvey snapped. He regarded her with a stern look, a state of mind Nelson had never seen him in. Then his eyes softened. With a much calmer tone he said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one way to get here.‚Äù He reached out to her, but she drew her arm away from his touch and walked to the stone disk. 

Nelson felt a tremor work its way into his hands and he clenched his fists against it. He walked slowly to the center of the field. The disk‚Äôs diameter looked to be nearly twenty feet and was perfectly round. Strange markings were carved into its circumference every five or so feet along with a line that stretched into its center. As his eyes followed the lines inward it adopted the uncanny effect of spinning. ‚ÄúIt looks kind of like a sundial.‚Äù

Gayle shuddered next to him. ‚ÄúIt makes me nauseous.‚Äù

He nodded his agreement. It tilted his gut just to look at it, but he continued staring into the spinning center of the disk. A maddening and wondrous warmth reached up from the pit in his stomach. 

‚ÄúHey guys!‚Äù Harvey‚Äôs voice rang out. 

Nelson turned and saw him standing atop one of the boulders at the far end of the field. He beckoned frantically and pointed down to the other side. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to come see this,‚Äù he called. 

They both ran towards him and joined him on the rocks. From the top, they could now see that there was a large ring of boulders surrounding an opening in the earth. They lined the pit like gargantuan, malformed teeth. Harvey picked up a stick and let it fall into the dark below them. After less than a second, it struck solid ground.

‚ÄúWell, it's not very deep,‚Äù Harvey said with a satisfied look on his face.

Nelson shook his head. ‚ÄúMaybe just where it happened to land. It's way too dark to know what it‚Äôs like down there.‚Äù

Gayle crossed her arms. ‚ÄúThere is no way in hell we‚Äôre goin‚Äô down there Harvey.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMaybe you guys aren‚Äôt, but I‚Äôm gonna check it out.‚Äù A strangely gleeful tone laced Harvey's voice. He was normally up for any amount of stupid adventures, but never so recklessly.

Nelson made a grab for his arm. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon man, that‚Äôs just stupid.‚Äù 

Harvey slapped it away. ‚ÄúWhat? You think just cause you‚Äôre not from here you‚Äôre smarter than me?‚Äù

‚ÄúWha...what?‚Äù Nelson blinked in confusion.

Harvey nodded. His gaze turned dark again, the shrill, excited tone now he had adopted only moments before now downturned into malice . ‚ÄúYeah, I know. Your family is richer and from somewhere a little fancier so you automatically think you know better.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy would you say something like that? You of all people know that‚Äôs not true.‚Äù Nelson took a step toward him and Harvey took a step back, closer to the edge. 

‚ÄúWe all got secrets, Nelly. And in the dark, they dance and dream.‚Äù A low ripple of laughter crept through his lips. 

‚ÄúHarvey, what are you talkin‚Äô about?‚Äù Gayle‚Äôs voice shook. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt sound ok.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut your trap, sow.‚Äù Harvey took another step towards the thick darkness below them. 

Nelson‚Äôs mind conjured visions of aquatic and terrible tendrils slinking out of the depths and wrapping around Harvey‚Äôs legs. They would drag him into the abyss, down to the dark where secrets dreamt and danced. He held out his hand cautiously. He wrestled with a deep longing and curiosity to plumb the depths of the maw within the boulders, but he knew that once they passed that proverbial faultline something irreversible would take hold. Harvey was not himself, but he was sure he could bring him back if they just got away. ‚ÄúHarvey, buddy,"" he said, ""I need you to come away from there. Let‚Äôs just go. This place isn‚Äôt right and we need to go, right now.‚Äù

Harvey pointed at him. ‚ÄúAnd I need you to sit back and shut your mouth.‚Äù His voice was no longer his own. The shape of the words and enunciations were all wrong.

Something in Harvey‚Äôs voice or the way he pointed shocked Nelson so that he tripped backwards, landing on his tailbone. His teeth clacked together and pain rocketed up his spine. It felt as if instead of a stern hand motion, Harvey had pushed him from three feet away. 

Gayle ran towards him. ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù She reached out to Harvey longingly. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong,‚Äù she pleaded as she wrapped her arms around him. 

He looked down at her, pitiless. ‚ÄúYou fucking slut. You want him, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù 

Her eyes welled with tears as she stared back in silence. 

‚ÄúFine. We all got secrets after all.‚Äù 

In a blur of movement, he hooked her with his arm and tossed her into the hole. There was no time to fight or respond before she was gone.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Nelson jumped to his feet and charged after Harvey. Below them, somewhere in the dark, Gayle began to scream.

‚ÄúWhat did you do?‚Äù Nelson stared into the velvet black as her shrieks peeled out into the light. 

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go and get her then? She‚Äôs waiting for you, too. She‚Äôs dreaming and waiting.‚Äù Another bout of deep laughter.

Nelson took a deep breath. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about,‚Äù he swung and, as his fist connected with the side of Harvey‚Äôs skull, pain shot through his hand and arm, ‚Äúbut you need to shut the fuck up.‚Äù

Harvey crumpled onto the boulder, smacking his head on the unforgiving rocky surface. Nelson waited a moment to make sure he was still breathing. Once satisfied, he looked down into the hole. Gayle‚Äôs screaming had fallen to whimpering.

‚ÄúAre you hurt?‚Äù he called down.

‚ÄúI...I don‚Äôt think so. Not too bad anyway.‚Äù Her voice was distant, far too distant for her to have fallen without breaking something. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt think I can get out. I can‚Äôt see anything and‚Ä¶‚Äù Her voice trailed off.

‚ÄúAnd what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs something down here, Nelson. Please help me.‚Äù Her words began to run together as she cried.

Nelson looked around, trying to find anything he could throw down to pull her up, but the field was empty save for their bags next to the strange stone disk. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be right back, I promise. It‚Äôll be ok.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease hurry,‚Äù she whimpered.

Nelson jumped down from the rocks and ran to where their bags were piled up. Frantically he searched through them, but there was no rope, no string, only the food and drinks they had brought. *The boat, there‚Äôs rope on the boat*. He scrambled towards the trail. 

*There‚Äôs something down here*...he didn‚Äôt know what that could mean, but he knew it couldn‚Äôt be good and that he didn‚Äôt have much time.



**8:20 A.M.**



Nelson stood at the edge of the floating dock and stared at the Cecilia as it bobbed in the lazy wake. The rope was well within reach, hanging off the side of the boat and dangling into the water. Something held him back from reaching across to it. He knew that he needed to get back to Gayle and Harvey, but the idea of extending his hand across the foot wide gap that separated him from the rope made his stomach drop. The same tendrils he had imagined emerging from the depths of the cave could just as easily materialize from the bottom of the ocean. 

*That‚Äôs insane. Just grab it!*

He knelt and threw his arm towards the rope. For a sickening pair of seconds, his fingers slipped below the surface. His heart jumped into his throat and his vision blurred. *This is it*, he thought, *down to the depths with Nelly it is*. But before any creatures from the abyss could snag him he snatched his hand back up, and the rope with it. His breath was short and frantic as he stood and began pulling the rest of the rope in.  

‚ÄúSee,‚Äù he told himself, his voice only a bit shaky, ‚Äúnothin‚Äô to it.‚Äù He spooled the rope around his arm, but not before letting himself glance into the water below the dock. 

There was darkness. Then four blueish green lights appeared. *Eyes*? They bent and ebbed with water. Around the lights a shadow began to emerge. It spread far beyond the width of the boat as well as the dock below him.

Nelson‚Äôs breath froze in his lungs and he could feel his heart beating against his ribs. And then the shadow and lights were gone. *If they had been there at all*. *Get a grip and get your friends out of her*e. He put the image away as much as he could and ran for the tree line. 

*It doesn‚Äôt matter what you think you saw in the water. You‚Äôre in a high stress situation and you need to get out of it. Can‚Äôt do that if you‚Äôre slipping Nelly.* 

The woods darkened around him as he ran. He kept his fixed ahead of him. Some irrational thought made way that if he looked into the shadows of trees and brush he would see the lights-

*-the eyes-*

\-watching him. That he would see the massive shadow spread out into the forest, as if the thing‚Äôs size was only limited by the context in which he saw it. 

*Stop slipping. Stop slipping.* He used the thought as a mantra to push him further down the trail. *Stop slipping.* He made the bend that led to the field. 

*Stop slipping.* 

Nelson stumbled past the tree line and saw that Harvey was lying in the middle of the stone disk. 

*And start dancing.* 

He lay spread eagle and his eyes were open, staring straight into the sunless, grey sky. Gayle stood next to the disk with her head bent to one side. 

Nelson stopped. The strong sensation to come closer washed over him. ‚ÄúHey, uh, Gayle?‚Äù

She stood still, silent.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù He glanced towards the boulders, but they held no answers. They stood as they had before, the massive teeth of a creature's mouth within the earth.

She answered without turning to him. ‚ÄúI danced my way out.‚Äù Her voice lilted dreamily towards him through the fog. ‚ÄúAnd he was very tired. No...she was very tired. I think we‚Äôre for her. But not you.‚Äù Finally, she turned to him. Her eyes were glazed over while her jaw hung slack.

Nelson took a step back. ‚ÄúGayle, we can go now.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm supposed to.‚Äù Her eyes looked straight through him, into a universe beyond. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre supposed to stay...for her.‚Äù 

The image of the shadow flashed through his mind. *Her*. ‚ÄúI say screw that, Gayle.‚Äù Against his internal judgement he dropped the rope and ran to her. She didn‚Äôt run from him or towards him, rather, she continued to stare past him into some unknowable. ‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù he yelled into her face. He saw the life breathe back into her eyes as air was sucked into her lungs.

‚ÄúOh..my...god, Nelson.‚Äù She crumpled to her knees. Tears began to stream from her eyes. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where I was, but it was so dark, and cold...like the ocean. But deeper than I could‚Äôve gone. It was everywhere. Haf was everywhere.‚Äù Her words flowed into incomprehensible sobs. 

Nelson pulled her back up by her shoulders and wiped a strand of hair from her face. ‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôm sorry, Gayle. But I really think we need to go now.‚Äù

She took a moment and swallowed down another sob, then nodded. ‚ÄúYeah, ok.‚Äù She wiped her nose with a dirty forearm.

‚ÄúOk. Let‚Äôs get Har-‚Äù 

They turned to the disk and saw Harvey standing in the center. A voice, too deep to be his own, emanated from his mouth as it hung open. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take what isn‚Äôt yours, now. These lambs are for Minswhick. And they will serve their purpose. You can leave. And you‚Äôll forget. She‚Äôll let you forget.‚Äù

Gayle whimpered next to Nelson. ‚ÄúWhat is he saying? Why does he sound like that?‚Äù

Nelson hooked his hand around her arm and took a step back. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but we should definitely leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt leave him, I love him!‚Äù she cried. 

Harvey took a step forward. ‚ÄúLove me forever. We will be so terrible and beautiful with her. In the dark, dancing and dreaming.‚Äù As his foot landed, his knee buckled and snapped backwards with a wet *SNAP*. He continued to stand, though, as his leg wobbled beneath him.

‚ÄúCome on, Gayle!‚Äù Nelson pulled at her arm, dragging her towards the tree line. They needed to get back to the boat before...before what, Nelson wasn‚Äôt quite sure.

Harvey took another step and his other leg contorted in a similar fashion to the first. He clumsily made his way forward as his knees bowed and hooked beneath him, but still, somehow, kept him upright.  The voice continued to spill from his open mouth. ‚ÄúCome dream and dance with me, for her. Haf.‚Äù

Gayle screamed and nearly tripped as she staggered backwards over her own feet. ‚ÄúOh god, no!‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Nelson yelled and pulled her with him into a full sprint down the trail. 

He hated having Harvey behind him; he could feel his presence as if he was only inches away, reaching to pull him back into the dark beneath the boulders. But he pushed on. He pounded his feet against the ground as the trees whipped by him. An awful cry of pain and anger sounded from behind. It echoed throughout the woods and wrapped around them. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look back,‚Äù he told Gayle, breathing heavily. ‚ÄúJust run.‚Äù

They broke free of the forest and continued towards the floating dock. The Cecilia bucked and rotated against the chop that had grown only angrier in the time since he had grabbed the rope.

‚ÄúI have the key,‚Äù Gayle said as they hopped aboard.

‚ÄúStart it!‚Äù Nelson unmoored the boat as the engine roared to life behind him. ‚ÄúGo, go, go!‚Äù Just as they began to move he unwrapped the final loop and let the tethers fall into the water. The shoreline of Ole Gate pulled away from them and began to fade back into the fog. For a moment, though, just at the edge of the trees, Nelson thought he could see Harvey with his crooked legs standing and watching them speed across the straight. He wasn‚Äôt sure, but it looked as if his jaw had unhinged and swayed like an open net.

Went to work. Im a TS/SCI intel analyst in a SCIF contracting for an agency. Logged in. Did some tasks. Went to grab coffee from the kitchen. Went back to my desk. Tried to log into the classified network. Password didnt work. 

Weird. Called tech support. They said to talk to security. Went to find security. They said my clearance has been revoked. My PM found out and said whelp, if you dont have a clearance you cant legally work here anymore. Debriefed me. Made me pack up my desk. And said per company policy theyll put me on LWOP for 4 weeks and if I cant find anything in that time, theyll consider me terminated. 

No reason given. No explanation. No notice. No warning. Just sorry. You dont have a clearance anymore. Bye. Wait for the US gov to send you a SOR explaining why you got fired. 

Mind you ive had my TS/SCI since 2007. Served 10 years in the military. No issues. Contracting for over 12 years. Top performer. Actually received a merit raise last quarter for how exceptional they thought my work to be. I manage a team. Have a lot of things that require daily updates that will now be dead cuz I was the only person doing that stuff or knew how. 

My team doesnt even know I left. Im still in shock. 

Just goes to show you that they wont fight for you. This administration is gonna see a massive security issue if this is how theyre RIFing their workers. 

Im no Snowden but the way they handled it, felt like I was some sort of criminal. I dont even know what I did wrong. Take too long to poop? I dont even bring up youtube at work. 

And the centuries of knowledge in the RIF‚Äôd work force with TS info saved up in their brains‚Ä¶ what do they expect us to do. Lay down and take the beatings?

So yeah. Just. Unsure what to do now. Ive lived the SCIF life my entire adult life. And now I have 3 months of savings left to figure out how to pay my mortgage going forward‚Ä¶

Been angry at myself because of the past mistakes I did. Anyways here's what actually stuck with me:

1. Make it obvious, not hidden. Stop relying on willpower and start designing your environment. I put my gym clothes next to my bed and my phone charger in the kitchen. Small changes, massive results.
2. Stack habits, don't isolate them. Instead of ""I'll meditate sometime today,"" I do ""After I pour my morning coffee, I meditate for 5 minutes."" Linking new habits to existing ones is like giving them a GPS.
3. Start stupidly small. I wanted to read more, so I committed to reading ONE PAGE per day. Sounds ridiculous, but I haven't missed a day in 8 months. Now I read 20-30 pages without even thinking about it.
4. Focus on identity, not outcomes. Instead of ""I want to lose 20 pounds,"" I started saying ""I'm the type of person who works out."" Every small action became evidence of who I was becoming, not just what I was trying to achieve.
5. Never miss twice. Life happens. You'll skip a workout or eat junk food. The key is getting back on track immediately. Missing once is an accident, missing twice is the beginning of a new habit.
6. Make it satisfying immediately. I created a simple habit tracker and checked off each completed habit. That little dopamine hit from marking an X kept me going when motivation died.
7. Environment beats willpower every time. I removed Instagram from my phone's home screen and put Kindle there instead. Guess what? I started reading more and scrolling less. Your environment is constantly voting for your habits.

What's one tiny habit you could start today that would compound into something amazing over time? i realized for me it was working out. I stacked my other habits from working out early in the morning thanks to this book.

Hope I motivate you to read the book as well.",49,1753400056.0,lifehack,1,0.98,False

I don't do high end duties since I don't know people and haven't tried to reach out to parties, but I'd be willing to try if there ever was an opportunity.

Other than that I have other games and consoles (PS5.XBX,NS2), I play PC mainly, and I'm very flexible with game genres. I'd be happy to try other games, I just don't have the motivation to play them solo.

Some recent games I've been playing lately are Fantasy Life i, Donkey Kong Bananza, and GTA3 DE.

As for some personal info, I'm a full time worker, so I'm usually available around 5-7am and 5-10pm CST weekdays.

I'm a very quiet person, and I think I open up after getting to know someone. But if I'm being honest, I don't seem to have luck in having friends or getting to know people. (If you think this is a red flag I completely understand).

Some personal interest are anime (dub as I can't just sit and read subs anymore), I'm starting to get into working out and kickboxing as I have a desk job and I am stationary for long hours (own my own home gym with minimal equipment), I'm trying to get back into reading fantasy novels (Terry Brooks, if interested), and I drink coffee like a madman. Because music is a common topic, I'll admit I don't listen to bands (don't really know many) but I enjoy videogame osts and I'm often playing SNES music on my background.

I'm bilingual, (English/Spanish), legally american but mexican by blood. And if it matters, I am M.

As for what I'm looking for, honestly just someone who can enjoy gaming, I live in North America, but for anyone willing, I don't mind what region one is from. I don't have any social/political opinions and really don't think much of any of it. I'm not worried to talk about it, but I don't know much of the subjects.

Yes, I'm probably socially awkward, so I'm probably just kicking myself in here but no harm in at least trying.

Thanks if you read any of this and feel free to reply or dm. Ask any questions if you're interested. I see the not posting about disc or gender but you can dm me about it. I think I've only posted one other time on reddit, so I don't really know what I'm doing.",0,1753399180.0,GamerPals,1,0.5,False

I have never dated or had my first kiss or anything and cannot date until all my surgeries are done, which sucks because my clock is ticking and I want to get married and have kids and all that jazz. But at minimum I am gonna be in my mid-late 20's by the soonest I can date and I don't want to end up alone in my 40's and neither do I want to settle with someone just because they tolerate me.

There are of course plenty of reasons I need those procedures done, but the central issue is that it affects basic relationships I am able to hold because even if someone sees me as a man, my brain doesn't, and I am repulsed by the idea of kissing someone while still being physically a woman in any way. I just wanna go on a boring movie date or an awkward coffee date with someone.

Well, my mother told me a couple of weeks back that she wants to rent a beach house for the three of us (myself, my little bro, and her) next summer. But I already told my doctors I am planning on getting top surgery and beginning bottom surgery next semester as my insurance will only allow me to do so after being on testosterone for 1 year. 

I hate interrupting my family's plans but I really need everything done before I turn 26. I want to be able to just get started actually living my life. I don't want to live like a priest forever.

Now, i wanted to ask what can I do on a fourth date: not only the place or where to take her out, but also what can I do. Can we hold hands on fourth date? Or a Kiss? On the last date we hold hands on iceskating but I guess it doesnt count (because we were too afraid of falling lol). 

I guess there is an interest in her, but we are both timid persons so im worried that Im too slow or quick on this. ",1,1753398620.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

## Key Features analysis

The Max Factor lipstick range boasts a number of innovative features designed to elevate the user experience.

**Hydrating Formula:** The lipsticks are infused with moisturizing ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and vitamin E, which work to keep lips hydrated throughout the day. This prevents the uncomfortable dryness and cracking often associated with long-wear lipsticks, ensuring a smooth and comfortable feel. Lips feel nourished and supple even after hours of wear.

**High Pigment Load:** The intensity of the color payoff is remarkable. One swipe delivers rich, true-to-shade color that doesn't fade or feather easily. The high pigment load ensures that even the lighter shades offer noticeable coverage, making them suitable for all skin tones.

**Long-Lasting Wear:** the advanced formula is designed to stay put for hours without the need for frequent touch-ups. Whether you're sipping coffee or enjoying a meal, the color remains vibrant and intact. This is a notable advantage for those who lead busy lives and prefer a low-maintenance beauty routine.

**Precision Applicator:** Many of the Max Factor lipsticks feature a specially designed applicator that allows for precise and effortless application.The shape of the applicator is frequently enough angled or tapered to perfectly follow the contours of the lips, ensuring a clean and defined finish. This is notably useful for achieving a professional-looking result, even without a lip liner.

**Wide Shade Range:** Max Factor offers an extensive selection of shades to suit every skin tone and personal preference. From classic reds and pinks to trendy nudes and berries, there's a color for every occasion and mood. The diverse range makes it easy to find your perfect match, whether you're looking for an everyday staple or a bold statement shade.

**Cruelty-free Commitment:** In line with growing consumer demand, Max Factor is committed to cruelty-free practices. The brand does not test its products on animals, offering peace of mind to ethically conscious consumers. This commitment aligns with a broader industry shift towards sustainability and obligation.

**Versatile Look Creation:** With its wide range of shades and finishes, Max factor lipstick allows you to create a variety of different looks, from natural and understated to bold and glamorous. This versatility makes it a valuable addition to any makeup collection, allowing you to adapt your look to suit any occasion.

## FAQs Section

**Are Max Factor lipsticks suitable for sensitive skin?**
Many Max Factor lipsticks are formulated with gentle ingredients, making them suitable for sensitive skin. However, it's always recommended to check the ingredient list for any potential allergens or irritants. Performing a patch test before applying the lipstick to your entire lips can also help to minimize the risk of adverse reactions.**How do I choose the right Max Factor lipstick shade for my skin tone?**
Choosing the right lipstick shade depends on your skin's undertones. For warm undertones, shades with golden or peachy hues tend to be most flattering. For cool undertones, shades with blue or pink undertones work best. Neutral skin tones can typically wear a wider range of shades. It's also helpful to consider the occasion and your personal preferences when selecting a shade.

**What is the best way to apply Max Factor lipstick for long-lasting wear?**
For long-lasting wear, start by exfoliating your lips to create a smooth surface. Apply a thin layer of lip balm and let it absorb fully. Then, use a lip liner to define the edges of your lips and prevent feathering. Apply the Max Factor lipstick in thin layers, blotting between coats to help set the color. You can also set the lipstick with a translucent powder for added longevity.
