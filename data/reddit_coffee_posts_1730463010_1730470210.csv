I descaled the machine last week and there was a slight improvement but still not quite right. 

Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this or is it time for a new machine? ü§°

We all graduated in 2018 and the majority ended up in their hometown mid west city with 4 of us ending up in different states for work. 

This friend, we'll call Greg, is one of the 8 who live in the same city they grew up in and he has never really moved past college. He still really loves going to tailgates/games and is someone who likes to rehash the 'good days' before being an adult and brings up drama from college every time we all get together or in our group chat. The rest of our group have tried to gently bring up the topic of moving on but he just seems stuck in the past with a lot of the time listening to the same stories of how this guy was a jerk and will comment on where they are at now in life. Because Greg is super active in this group most of our conversations are about college / years old topics and he will ignore people if we try to talk about anything else. 

Greg hasn't had the best luck in the job department and has been without work for over a year now which I think plays into the love of revisiting the past for him, but it has gotten to the point of where his core group is leaving him out of things because they don't want to hear the same story over and over/ we have all kind of navigated to our own lives with new things. 

Greg and I always try to grab coffee when I am in town because we did that all through college so it is a nice catch up for us. He was venting about being left out and that they should care about the things he wants to talk about even if it is 'ancient history' to the rest of the group. (mind you, this is not really drama with anyone in our group it is just personal things he has with other old friends etc).   
  
At coffee, I asked him if minded not bringing up college so often because, I'm not interested in rehashing the past all the time. I want to hear about his now and try and encourage him to find positives in living for the now. He got really irritated and said that I was being inconsiderate and was just as b\*tchy as our friend group and has not spoken to any of us in two weeks. 

On one hand I feel bad he wants to stay so buried in the past and on the other, I live states away from him and this friend group and don't really feel the need to stay close especially if all we chat about is college (and now we're all almost 30).

You didn‚Äôt even try to talk it out, you broke up with me over text. I‚Äôve never felt so worthless in my life. I felt like the ugly bad monster that everyone had to be nice to but nobody would blame you if you tried to shoot him and put him down. If I had died from your wound would you be paraded through the city as a savior? 

You‚Äôre easier to like than me anyways. You‚Äôre ‚Äújust a girl‚Äù and everything you do is excusable for that reason. I‚Äôm often positive that what I feel towards you is sheer hatred and disdain. I waited for you to change, for you to feel happy with yourself and stop living under the bs lies you tell yourself. It never happened and those same lies stole you away from me. I hate that you‚Äôve moved on so easily. We dated for 1.5 years and it felt like the cooking timer went off but I was dead to it, I would have keot us in this place together for a long time. 

They say people don‚Äôt run from great people, they run from the things in themselves they would have to heal in order to be with a great person. Nowhere in any of these metaphors does it say that it‚Äôs cool to just triangulate and hide behind your friend and text message breakup. You‚Äôre a fucking coward and I hope you find the courage to apologize, to turn back and make things right. Sometimes we miss a turn or two along the way back to our hearts, take it slow turn around and get it right.

If you do decide to circle back to the man that you completely destroyed, then you should know that he is not the same man that you once knew. I never asked you for anything for myself, I tried to delete all of my own needs and instead gave you jobs to do, help clean, help organize, help invoice and design‚Ä¶ all the while I was deprived of love and affection.

When I got mad. When I began doing my somatic healing. I was alone in my house. I would call you when I got scared, I would call you when I had a breakthrough, I would call you when I missed you, and I would call my mom for some of the same reasons. I had no friends to talk to. Everything I was feeling was simply too big to just write down and move on. I wanted to shout my answers from the rooftops. I‚Äôm so sick of being my own worst enemy I wanted to run over to the secrets of life chamber and dump in my new answers so I could speed up the healing journey and just get back to the love. There‚Äôs no rushing the process‚Ä¶ 

You asked for space before breaking up with me, it was very hard to give you the space you needed as I was in an abnormally low place anyways and already hadn‚Äôt seen you in weeks. I did my best and you said I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt respecting your need for space‚Äù by sending you a text‚Ä¶ well now you have all the space from me that you could want and more. No I will never reach out. You made it clear what you‚Äôre looking for. I don‚Äôt need anything from you. I liked the woman who wanted to be with me everyday and give me gifts and tokens if her affection. I don‚Äôt want this childish little show off people pleaser loser who can‚Äôt make a choice for herself and prefers living in other peoples shadows.

I bet you don‚Äôt even miss me yet. I bet you‚Äôre glad I‚Äôm gone and celebrate every night with your roommate. I bet you love doing the things we used to do together with other people. Parties, dancing, sweet treats, movie nights and going out, love making, back rubbing‚Ä¶ I bet you hate me, I bet you blame me for your problems. How long will it take you to see that you‚Äôre the one running and hiding in the shadows. Will it be years until your next relationship? Or will you be a serial dater and confirm to yourself that you‚Äôre not meant to start a family. Will you heal like you said you would? Or are you still pleasure seeking. 

Things I may never know. One thing I know is that when I see your face I want to explode. All that love I had for you is now a bomb. In my dreams I hate you. In my waking hours I hate you. In the quiet hours of the day I set you free and allow myself to enjoy the experiences I had and forgive myself for not knowing‚Ä¶ not believing that you would ever do something like this to me. Forgive myself for being so blind as to actually try to save some little girl who acted like she deserved to be saved. She don‚Äôt want to be saved.

If you‚Äôre reading this, save yourself. I don‚Äôt hold onto anything from our time together. All your letters have been burned. All you leftover clothes were donated. It‚Äôs sad that I can‚Äôt even give you your favorite things back‚Ä¶ you‚Äôd rather not talk to me and you missed out on a lot of gifts. I had one from your birthday I forgot to give. I have several letters I wrote to you. I had two of your favorite dresses a shirt that said ‚Äúput on your big girl boots and deal with it‚Äù, and you favorite belt. I took down the pictures and paintings you gave me and I put them all in the donation bin. I burned your photos and your letters. 

I detest you, you lied to me and made me believe I could trust you. It was a rude awakening and I cried everyday for a few weeks. But you? You were filled with joy. You rejoiced and smiled and laughed.. you even blew me a kiss the last time I saw you‚Ä¶ well the last time I saw you I was sitting at a coffee shop and you drove by. I glanced up after you passed to see you were caught in traffic. I could see your head whip around as you peeled out the window to see if it was me. How did it feel? I hope when you see my face it gives you hell as well‚Ä¶ I hope I‚Äôm able to forgive myself. I don‚Äôt think you deserve forgiveness.

1gh5vkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1gh5vkk/the_mother_of_all_daddit_advice_applying/,The Mother of All Daddit Advice - Applying Principles from The Art of War to Parenting,"While I was sipping my morning coffee pondering the usual questions of how to get closer to my mid-term goal of world domination I had an idea: Why not ask ChatGPT to give me advise from Sun Tzu's famous book on military strategy and how it can apply to parenting? So here goes, (without fact checking):

# 1. ""Know yourself and know your enemy""

* In parenting, this translates to knowing yourself, your strengths and weaknesses as a parent, and knowing your child‚Äôs unique temperament, needs, and motivations. Understanding both sides helps you prepare for challenges and choose the best approach for each situation.

# 2. ""All warfare is based on deception""

* In a playful sense, this can be applied by using a little ""strategic deception"" to encourage desired behavior. For instance, framing chores as a fun game, setting up reward systems, or creating structured choices can guide kids without confrontations. The idea is to use cleverness to shape situations without force.

# 3. ""Avoid what is strong and attack what is weak""

* This principle suggests focusing on areas where your child is open to learning and growth rather than areas of resistance. If a child is particularly interested in a topic, use that as a gateway to encourage good habits, responsibility, or curiosity. Similarly, addressing negative behaviors in ways that don‚Äôt trigger power struggles can be more effective than trying to assert control over everything.

# 4. ""Opportunism of flexibility""

* Sun Tzu emphasizes adaptability in strategy. In parenting, this means being flexible and adjusting tactics to match your child‚Äôs development and unique situation. What works with one child or at one stage may not work later or with another child. Embracing adaptability allows you to respond to their evolving needs and meet them where they are.

# 5. ""He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight""

* Not every conflict needs to be a battle. Pick your battles wisely, focusing on core values or behaviors rather than arguing over small things. When you choose not to engage in every small power struggle, you reserve your energy for the more significant teachable moments and also give your child the space to exercise some independence.

# 6. ""Management of many is the same as management of few""

* Whether you have one child or several, the key to harmony is clear, consistent routines and expectations. When expectations are clear, kids know what‚Äôs coming, and it reduces resistance. Just like in managing troops, good parenting is about setting systems that work regardless of the numbers involved.

# 7. ""Rewards and punishments""

* Sun Tzu talks about the importance of clear rewards and consequences. In parenting, this means establishing boundaries and sticking to them so kids understand the impact of their choices. Consistency is essential, as it reinforces the understanding that actions have predictable consequences.

# 8. ""The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting""

* In parenting, the best outcomes are achieved when you can guide children to make good choices without resorting to arguments or force. Often, this is about modeling behavior, creating a positive environment, and encouraging kids to take ownership of their choices rather than relying on strict commands or discipline.",0,1730469063.0,daddit,1,0.5,False

About a year ago I got myself a Frieling French press.  I am buying quality coffee that was roasted within the past few months.  I weigh my beans and grind in my Fellow Opus on 11(coarsest setting).  I don‚Äôt weigh my water, but I measure it in the same cup every time and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm within just a few milliliters.  I add Third Wave minerals to my water.  I heat the French press with hot water then discard.  I add the coffee grounds.  I do boil my water.  I know some say don‚Äôt, but I find it cools slightly during pouring and while the French press is pre warmed, it‚Äôs still cooler than the water and will cool the water down quickly enough.  I add the hot water to my coffee and give about 8 good stirs.  Then I let it set for 4 minutes.  After 4 minutes I gently stir the top of the coffee 4-5 times.  Then I set a timer and wait.  This is what I‚Äôm curious about.  My recipe pretty closely follows James Hoffman‚Äôs recipe for the perfect cup of French roast coffee.  In that video he says, after the second stir, to wait several minutes.  I think he says up to 9 or 10.  If I wait 10 minutes my coffee seems very under extracted.  I‚Äôve been moving up 1 minute per day for the last 5 days.  This morning I waited 15 minutes and it was the best cup I‚Äôve made yet.  I‚Äôm going to continue increasing the time until I reach the optimum flavor for me.  It just seems like that‚Äôs a really long time.  Is it normal for it to take that long to brew a great cup?

I have lived in my home for over 3 years as of today. It's 3000 sqft, single family home, big yard, new HVAC, 4 beds, 3 full baths, with a den, fenced backyard, and 3 car garage. It's in a good neighborhood and school district. Since this would be my first time as a landlord, I want to know everything I would need to consider before I start renting it out.

My monthly payment on the house including Mortgage, property tax, insurance and HOA is approximately $2700. I am on Illinois.

I am on a Visa, so I cannot actively manage the property, I am thinking of getting an agent to do the heavy lifting of advertising and vetting the applicants. My Fiance said he can take care of any day to day issues as we would be only 15 mins away. 

Some of the questions I have right off the bat are -
- how do I find out what should be the asking rent, comps etc. do I use apps like Zillow/Redfin etc? 
- do I include landscaping (mowing, fertilizing company etc ) or should this be the renters responsibility?
- anything else I should take care of as opposed to making that a renter responsibility?
- I might leave some basic furniture behind like bed frames, some coffee tables etc. should I even do that or clear out the house completely. I wouldn't care if they are not usable at the end of the renting.
- if I go with say an Redfin agent to do the groundwork instead of a property management company would that cost me more instead of going with a property management company from the beginning? 
- are there any property management listings I can find maybe on Google or is there some website dedicated for this?

Anything else I should think of when setting the rent pricing and overall process. What should I be aware of etc.

1gh5osw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PLHIVPH/comments/1gh5osw/plhiv_for_6_yrs_now/,PLHIV for 6 yrs now,"
Hey, I‚Äôm Carl, and I am a person living with HIV. Before I share my story, I realize not everyone will appreciate or understand this struggle. Feel free to ignore it, and please, leave no hateful comments. I finally have the courage to share my story. This is quite lengthy, so I beg your patience.

I was around 22 years old when I tested positive for HIV. Thankfully, it was detected early, and I had some prior knowledge about it. I‚Äôve always made it a habit to get checked almost every year. I started exploring my sexuality at a young age‚ÄîI was 16 when I had my first boyfriend. We were intimate, though not in ways we considered high-risk at the time. He was in the medical field, and I was an excellent student, so I had read up on safe sex.

Over the years, I had two or three boyfriends. I‚Äôve always been monogamous; I don‚Äôt engage in sexual activity unless I‚Äôm in a committed relationship.

In college, after going through some failed relationships, I began to explore sexually. I‚Äôll admit, I was a bit promiscuous. I met people on an app and had casual encounters, though never with an*l penetration. It was mostly just oral. I knew there was some risk, but I thought it was lower compared to other forms of sex, so I got complacent. This was around 2016-2017.

As a student, I was an achiever. I excelled in many areas, graduated high school with academic distinction, and finished college with Latin honors. Modesty aside, I was smart, driven, and felt unstoppable‚Äîuntil 2018 when my HIV test came back positive.

When I received the results, I didn‚Äôt know what to feel. It felt like my world had fallen apart. I was helpless, wanting to wake up from what I wished was a dream, but I knew it was real. There were flashbacks of times I could‚Äôve stopped myself, but then again I was complacent.

I immediately called my mom to tell her the news, then rushed to the nearest church to pray. To ask for forgiveness. I prayed that the confirmatory test would come back negative, but deep down, I knew that I had to move forward and accept my reality. A few minutes later, my mom, who knew little about HIV, came from work, hugged me tightly, and my tears just started to fall. ‚ÄúMom, I‚Äôm sorry. I made a mistake. I‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù

I told her not to tell anyone, but she couldn‚Äôt keep it to herself. She needed support to accept it herself, and she knew I needed love and understanding from our family. 

The next day, I went to the clinic and started treatment with my mom and sister by my side. The doctors gave us counseling on how the treatment works. All I had to do was stay healthy: eat well, exercise, abstain, and wait 6 months to a year to reach undetectable levels. During the counseling, my mom couldn‚Äôt hold back her tears. ‚ÄúDoc, my son is an honor student. He‚Äôll go far and travel the world. Is he going to die soon?‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, no,‚Äù the doctor assured her. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good that he got checked early. Early detection means early treatment. With a healthy lifestyle and taking his ARV on time, he‚Äôll live long. In fact, he could outlive the rest of us. That‚Äôs how advanced our medicines are now. Treating HIV is like treating diabetes.‚Äù

I saw a small sign of relief on her face.

Months later, I also had the courage to tell a few of my trusted best-friends. They were kind enough to just listen to my story. It was whirlwind of reactions from them, mostly worried for me. But they assured me that they will be there to support me no matter the cost. 

Fast forward a year, and my results came back undetectable (U=U). This means I can no longer transmit HIV to a partner. Although, it‚Äôs not a ticket to stop practicing safe sex. It just means I‚Äôm healthy and will not succumb to AIDS-related complications. AIDS is the advanced stage of untreated HIV, which carries high risks of complications.

The treatment was the hardest two years of my life. My body took time to adjust, and I felt uneasy and dizzy every time I took the medication. I had to sleep right after to avoid nausea. Every night felt like vertigo, and it was a surreal reminder of my status. Knowing that this disease would be with me forever made me feel depressed. I didn‚Äôt feel good about myself and was a mess. But I told myself it wasn‚Äôt time to give up‚ÄîI had to move forward.

Two years after beginning treatment, I met someone. We dated for a long time. He was a decent guy with a steady job. Eventually, I knew I had to tell him about my status. When I did, he simply smiled and said, ‚ÄúI accept you.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt expect that. There‚Äôs still a lot of stigma around HIV, and many of us feel outcast, cut off from opportunities, and stuck in self-pity. I never realized someone would accept me fully.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll educate myself on safe sex so I can be responsible with you,‚Äù he said.

So, we practiced safe sex, and both of us were monogamous. We promised to communicate openly and work through any misunderstandings. He made me feel safe. We went on dates to the movies and coffee shops. Every night, he reminded me to take my medicine. He knew the exact time, took care of me, shared playlists, recommended books, and even suggested series and movies to watch.

We were together for six years, the healthiest relationship I‚Äôve ever had. But, like many stories, it eventually ended. We decided to part ways and grow in different directions. It wasn‚Äôt a happy ending, but it‚Äôs a story worth sharing with others who are HIV-positive. Love is out there, along with acceptance and understanding.

I hope my story gives you something meaningful to reflect on. Today, I am very healthy. I go to the gym regularly, and my mental health has improved as I continue to navigate life. To all those living with HIV, I‚Äôm sorry for the challenges you‚Äôve faced. I know you didn‚Äôt choose this, and that many people will judge and criticize.

I once brewed coffee with my Braun coffee maker, and I noticed it didn‚Äôt taste as good as it used to when the machine was new. Since I didn‚Äôt have a specific coffee maker cleaner, I used white vinegar to clean it, then rinsed it with water. It seemed to help at the time.

A few months later, the coffee tasted awful again, so I tried the vinegar method once more, but now it tastes even worse. :(

Do you think using a proper coffee maker cleaner (like descaling powder) would help fix the taste?

Review of 4 night stay from the week of October 21st.

Transportation and Arrival
We used DiDi and booked our car after arriving in PVG. If you haven‚Äôt done this before the cars are generally quick and you can book right after you exit from customs with your luggage. You will need to go down to the basement parking level 2 either via elevator or escalator.

The ride at 5:30pm on a Wednesday took about 50 minutes. The entrance is off of WeiHai road and not directly on the street. That is you need to enter via one of the driveways which I felt throughout the stay was not particularly welcome to pedestrians. Given that the hotel is a block or so away from the intersection of 3 subway lines at West Nanjing Road station, you have to walk through these driveways and across parking garage entrances every time you leave and come in. (We used the subway for 90% of our transportation or just walked - weather was cool)

Arrival was pretty seamless and you take an initial elevator up from the arrival lobby to reception. We arrived after sunset and the hotel is pretty dark - not a criticism it certainly has a vibe. Still, after 4 nights I felt this dark tunnel feeling and often wondering ‚Äúam I going the right way.‚Äù

As an earlier review said there is nothing remarkable about check-in. Quick, efficient, a bit of registration as usual in China. We originally booked the Pavilion Suite King, and were upgraded on check-in to the Deluxe Suite King. No mention or explanation of any Globalist perks beyond this (no mention of breakfast specifically either) There was a nice lemon tart in the room on the first day. Don‚Äôt have anything to compare this room to other than the pics on the website but the room was great. Pics below.

Room
The suite was well laid out and as described. Some things I think of in my travels that may be helpful to others:
The outlets are all done as expected with a brand new remodel. The plugs can only handle China type plugs, however both USB A and C are in each outlet, which essentially obviated the need for a separate charger. (didn‚Äôt bring my laptop on this trip)
The bathmat‚Äôs are very plush - not just a small version of a towel. In fact, the carpet throughout the hallways is very nice a plush
There is no ironing board or iron - you need to call and request this as another reviewer said - I never did.
There is no shoe horn, which was surprising.
Extensive and nice quality toiletries
Minibar was never charged despite having some drinks each night

Housekeeping was generally good, we requested turndown service with extra water every night when leaving for dinner and they fully replenished the room and prepared evening tea with a full chrysanthemum blossom.

In-house dining
Throughout the stay we had each of the sets for breakfast - Shanghainese, Japanese and Western. Any changes were accommodated and the food was great. As with other reviews if you‚Äôre really hungry you will need to order more, which was never a problem. The buffet spread was really just pastries, meats and fruits. This really isn‚Äôt a buffet experience.
Coffee and drinks take a while at breakfast. We always got the correct order but 5-10 minutes for a coffee is just too long. I know I go against the grain here but I blame this on the over reliance of espresso machines and having to prepare each individually. My favorite coffee is at the Kowloon Shangri La - literally a carafe of brewed coffee placed on the table when you sit down. Fruit juices are available yourself or if you order them - water you have to order from the wait staff for each glass.

The Secret Room is a real point of pride at the Alila. At least half the time we emerged from the lobby elevator we were asked if we were going to the Secret Room. It‚Äôs a cocktail bar with terrace and a striking view of old and new architecture - especially at sunset. Never had a drink here, too much else to go do and see but stopped by to see the view. Certainly nice enough.

Gym
Unfortunately didn't take a picture of the gym, but it was pretty well equipped.

General Service and Observations.
Overall service was quite good. The guy who checked us in scanned our WeChat and we corresponded with him daily to help with restaurant reservations (since we have foreign phone numbers we cannot use dianping to reserve), which he was kind enough to indulge. The Assistant Butler Manager offer to do the same and helped us make bookings on the last night we were there.

In my experience whether at PH, GH or Shangri-La‚Äôs in China, you can‚Äôt escape the smoke. Luckily with the renovation and opening being so recent - we didn‚Äôt smell one bit. I have to say that was very refreshing.

Half the time we came into the lobby, a more senior staff greeted us and asked if they could help with anything, which was nice but never really necessary. Like anywhere there were clear senior staff members who were incredibly professional and on it - and others who seemed a bit green but again this hotel just opened a month ago. I was very happy and inclined to give them all the benefit of the doubt.
I will definitely stay again based on the hard product and location - I'm sure just slight minor service issues will be ironed out given how new the hotel is.

1gh5m0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gh5m0o/am_i_overreacting/,Am I Overreacting? ,"Not even two months ago my ex started having a ‚Äúweird feeling.‚Äù We were both going through a lot of life changes, me especially (new job, moved, new roommate, new friends, started grad school) a week later we were sitting in a coffee shop and they made a weird face. I asked them why they made a weird face and they said they made the realization that they didn‚Äôt want to flirt anymore and our relationship felt more platonic. This entire thing was a genuine shock to me because they had been talking about looking for apartment, moving jobs to be closer to me, etc. we never fought. When i asked why he genuinely didn‚Äôt have an answer. He said he was in denial though. In the breakup he said that we should wait until thanksgiving to talk but we could still send things on instagram.

I have sent about 2 things in the last several weeks. 1 was 2 nights ago. He reached out to me to tell me that not talking has been helpful for him and he wanted to know if we could stop all forms of communication. He then asked when I wanted to meet for thanksgiving.

I feel so utterly unimportant. He walked away from me so quickly, without even a second thought. I also didn‚Äôt think the few times I have sent cat memes on instagram have been so bad. But i feel guilty like I‚Äôm not moving on quick enough for him. But also it feels his text last night was saying that i couldn‚Äôt get out of his life fast enough. I don‚Äôt even understand what there is to talk about during thanksgiving or what the next three weeks are going to change. I don‚Äôt know how to shift my perspective because i just feel utterly helpless. ",1,1730468305.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I work at home as a freelancer - more of a Quality Assurance Evaluator/Specialist. My clients are US based.

As for my hobbies, I enjoy staying at home as I aged. I‚Äôm fine with binging shows or just sleep. On weekends, I normally would go to my parent‚Äôs house or have a bike ride. I also love to go out with few close friends and grab a coffee. I just recently got a cat so I‚Äôm spending time with her and my nieces. Am a travel enthusiast as well. Lastly, I enjoy all sorts of music but I‚Äôm into Kpop and I enjoy going to concerts.

I grew up as a Catholic and I intend to stay as one. I try to go to church every Sunday and first Friday mass. I have faith in God and I would love to have a partner who also has faith in the Lord. 

My dealbreaker would be someone who smokes of any kind and who doesn‚Äôt have work or income resources. Please understand that I am independent and can support myself. However, I don‚Äôt intend to do all the work for my partner. It would be nice if we work together. Also, someone taller than me, not on the *bigger* side (I apologize. I don‚Äôt mean to be mean) is what I prefer.

Attached are my photos. So please send me a message with your photo/s if you‚Äôre interested. 

PS. Im okay with LDR and up to relocate if needed..

1gh5i1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1gh5i1l/plhiv/,PLHIV,"
Hey, I‚Äôm Carl, and I am a person living with HIV. Before I share my story, I realize not everyone will appreciate or understand this struggle. Feel free to ignore it, and please, leave no hateful comments. I finally have the courage to share my story. This is quite lengthy, so I beg your patience.

I was around 22 years old when I tested positive for HIV. Thankfully, it was detected early, and I had some prior knowledge about it. I‚Äôve always made it a habit to get checked almost every year. I started exploring my sexuality at a young age‚ÄîI was 16 when I had my first boyfriend. We were intimate, though not in ways we considered high-risk at the time. He was in the medical field, and I was an excellent student, so I had read up on safe sex.

Over the years, I had two or three boyfriends. I‚Äôve always been monogamous; I don‚Äôt engage in sexual activity unless I‚Äôm in a committed relationship.

In college, after going through some failed relationships, I began to explore sexually. I‚Äôll admit, I was a bit promiscuous. I met people on an app and had casual encounters, though never with an*l penetration. It was mostly just oral. I knew there was some risk, but I thought it was lower compared to other forms of sex, so I got complacent. This was around 2016-2017.

As a student, I was an achiever. I excelled in many areas, graduated high school with academic distinction, and finished college with Latin honors. Modesty aside, I was smart, driven, and felt unstoppable‚Äîuntil 2018 when my HIV test came back positive.

When I received the results, I didn‚Äôt know what to feel. It felt like my world had fallen apart. I was helpless, wanting to wake up from what I wished was a dream, but I knew it was real. There were flashbacks of times I could‚Äôve stopped myself, but then again I was complacent.

I immediately called my mom to tell her the news, then rushed to the nearest church to pray. To ask for forgiveness. I prayed that the confirmatory test would come back negative, but deep down, I knew that I had to move forward and accept my reality. A few minutes later, my mom, who knew little about HIV, came from work, hugged me tightly, and my tears just started to fall. ‚ÄúMom, I‚Äôm sorry. I made a mistake. I‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù

I told her not to tell anyone, but she couldn‚Äôt keep it to herself. She needed support to accept it herself, and she knew I needed love and understanding from our family. 

The next day, I went to the clinic and started treatment with my mom and sister by my side. The doctors gave us counseling on how the treatment works. All I had to do was stay healthy: eat well, exercise, abstain, and wait 6 months to a year to reach undetectable levels. During the counseling, my mom couldn‚Äôt hold back her tears. ‚ÄúDoc, my son is an honor student. He‚Äôll go far and travel the world. Is he going to die soon?‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, no,‚Äù the doctor assured her. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good that he got checked early. Early detection means early treatment. With a healthy lifestyle and taking his ARV on time, he‚Äôll live long. In fact, he could outlive the rest of us. That‚Äôs how advanced our medicines are now. Treating HIV is like treating diabetes.‚Äù

I saw a small sign of relief on her face.

Months later, I also had the courage to tell a few of my trusted best-friends. They were kind enough to just listen to my story. It was whirlwind of reactions from them, mostly worried for me. But they assured me that they will be there to support me no matter the cost. 

Fast forward a year, and my results came back undetectable (U=U). This means I can no longer transmit HIV to a partner. Although, it‚Äôs not a ticket to stop practicing safe sex. It just means I‚Äôm healthy and will not succumb to AIDS-related complications. AIDS is the advanced stage of untreated HIV, which carries high risks of complications.

The treatment was the hardest two years of my life. My body took time to adjust, and I felt uneasy and dizzy every time I took the medication. I had to sleep right after to avoid nausea. Every night felt like vertigo, and it was a surreal reminder of my status. Knowing that this disease would be with me forever made me feel depressed. I didn‚Äôt feel good about myself and was a mess. But I told myself it wasn‚Äôt time to give up‚ÄîI had to move forward.

Two years after beginning treatment, I met someone. We dated for a long time. He was a decent guy with a steady job. Eventually, I knew I had to tell him about my status. When I did, he simply smiled and said, ‚ÄúI accept you.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt expect that. There‚Äôs still a lot of stigma around HIV, and many of us feel outcast, cut off from opportunities, and stuck in self-pity. I never realized someone would accept me fully.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll educate myself on safe sex so I can be responsible with you,‚Äù he said.

So, we practiced safe sex, and both of us were monogamous. We promised to communicate openly and work through any misunderstandings. He made me feel safe. We went on dates to the movies and coffee shops. Every night, he reminded me to take my medicine. He knew the exact time, took care of me, shared playlists, recommended books, and even suggested series and movies to watch.

We were together for six years, the healthiest relationship I‚Äôve ever had. But, like many stories, it eventually ended. We decided to part ways and grow in different directions. It wasn‚Äôt a happy ending, but it‚Äôs a story worth sharing with others who are HIV-positive. Love is out there, along with acceptance and understanding.

I hope my story gives you something meaningful to reflect on. Today, I am very healthy. I go to the gym regularly, and my mental health has improved as I continue to navigate life. To all those living with HIV, I‚Äôm sorry for the challenges you‚Äôve faced. I know you didn‚Äôt choose this, and that many people will judge and criticize. Keep going, and don‚Äôt let anyone define you. I know that beyond your status, there‚Äôs a good-hearted person with dreams and aspirations meant to inspire others. I‚Äôm rooting for you, always.",2,1730468011.0,OffMyChestPH,0,1.0,False
1gh5hid,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lufthansa/comments/1gh5hid/has_lufthansa_business_class_service_quality/,Has Lufthansa Business Class Service Quality Declined?,"I flew business class from Frankfurt to S√£o Paulo yesterday and faced a few unexpected issues. The flight started without a welcome drink due to an accident involving the catering truck. Not a problem, safety and the well-being of those involved take priority.

However, that was just the start. WiFi was down for the whole flight without any announcement. After 30 minutes of trying to connect, I finally asked, only to learn it wouldn‚Äôt be working at all. Then, my in-flight entertainment screen was malfunctioning, neither the touch function nor the remote worked reliably. Lastly, the coffee machine was broken, and we were left with cold filter coffee.

This isn‚Äôt my first experience like this, and it‚Äôs surprising. I pay nearly ‚Ç¨3,000 for a premium experience, yet the quality felt subpar. The crew seemed unfazed by the issues, and I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if this drop in service is becoming the new norm.

I‚Äôm a loyal LH Group flyer, with Senator status for the third consecutive year, but I‚Äôm genuinely concerned about the consistency in service quality. Has anyone else had similar experiences? And does anyone know if LH is acknowledging these issues or working on improvements? Otherwise, I‚Äôm questioning my loyalty here.",3,1730467969.0,Lufthansa,1,1.0,False

We tried dating briefly at the beginning of 2020, but the pandemic and a bit of distance created tension. He became distant, I ended things, and eventually, he started dating someone else. A few months later, he called & apologized for how things ended, and we reconnected as friends due to our shared industry, where burning bridges isn‚Äôt ideal.

Fast forward four years, and we coincidentally end up living in the same city. We kept bumping into each other at local coffee shops, chatting casually, and decided to reconnect as friends. Over time, we began hanging out more frequently, but it was purely platonic.

A couple of months ago, we were catching up, and he mentioned his dating experiences. How no one was catching his interest. Since we were talking relationships, I told him I‚Äôd been in an open relationship, which was getting messy. He just listened, and nothing came of it. A month or two later, I was fresh out of that breakup, though he didn‚Äôt know it yet. He then asked me out for drinks as a thank-you for a work favor I‚Äôd done for him.

In early October, we got those drinks and had an amazing night out ‚Äî cocktails, arcade games, a rooftop bar, and a lot of talking. He was noticeably flirty. I eventually confided in him about my recent breakup, but I asked him not to ‚Äúmake it weird.‚Äù He got even flirtier. We ended up back at his place, where he touched my legs a bit, but nothing happened. I fell asleep in his bed, and he took the couch.

The following week, I invited him over while I was house-sitting nearby. We stayed up until 2 a.m., watching my favorite movie I told him he HAD to watch. The whole time, he was being flirty, touching my legs, and eventually acknowledging, ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre both trying to figure out what we want here.‚Äù I told him I was down to hook up, but made it clear that, fresh out of a breakup, I wasn‚Äôt looking for romance. I wanted to set that boundary so he wouldn‚Äôt feel pressured into anything more than fun and friendship.

We hooked up that night. A few days later, he invited me to work with him at a coffee shop. He was casual, just talking like a friend. I asked if our hookup had made things weird and suggested that if it did, we didn‚Äôt have to do it again. He replied that he actually wanted to ‚Äúdo that a bunch more times.‚Äù So, a few days later, we met for drinks, talked, and kept things light. He asked what I was doing for Halloween and I said I was going as Olive from Easy A, and my ‚Äòfriend‚Äô was going to be the love interest Woodchuck Todd. He just was quiet at that. There was some talk of hooking up again. He emphasized that he wanted to make sure hooking up wasn‚Äôt the ONLY thing we did. So we didn‚Äôt that night.

Since then, he‚Äôs been texting pretty regularly. It‚Äôs flirty and fun, and he‚Äôs sent me songs with lyrics that hint at ‚Äúplaying it cool when you like someone,‚Äù which felt a bit pointed.

Our most recent hangout felt almost like a date. We grabbed chips and margaritas, went antiquing, flirted, and even made out a bit in the store. He slapped my butt a few times, and when I asked about his dating life, he claimed he wasn‚Äôt on the apps at the moment and seeing anyone (which I took with a grain of salt). He did ask if I liked the songs he sent, and I casually said yes, dropping the topic afterward.

Later, we ended up back at his place, hooked up, and then cuddled a bit. He asked for my opinion on his apartment decor as I walked around the place in his shirt, but soon left as he had to be up early for work. Afterward, he texted me saying, ‚ÄúSorry for the early night! Looks like you left me by my lonesome.‚Äù I joked that he ‚Äúkicked me out,‚Äù adding that I wouldn‚Äôt have minded staying over. He replied nervously with, ‚ÄúWell, the world‚Äôs our oyster! Who knows what the future holds üòÖ.‚Äù I told him to calm down, I‚Äôm just flirting. 

After thinking about it for a few hours, I realized I might actually have a crush on him. To avoid blurring lines further, I decided to be upfront. I texted him saying: ‚Äòidk if casual is for me. Not going to lie, I do have a crush. To keep things simple & stay friends, let‚Äôs take a step back, maybe pause on hanging out for a bit. Hope you understand.‚Äô

He responded: hi hi hi, sorry for taking so long to respond. I honestly think the friendship is a lot more important than the hooking up part, so if we need to take a step back and pause for a little while I‚Äôm perfectly OK with that. I‚Äôd rather keep the friendship intact, and I appreciate you saying all this.

I jokingly responded: Pardon my French, but why did I say ‚ÄòI like you‚Äô cryptically, & you politely said 'k' lol

I feel like I might have come across as needy. I‚Äôm not looking for a declaration of feelings from him, but I want to see if we‚Äôre on the same page about keeping things simple and staying friends. Part of me would be thrilled if he said he had a crush on me too, but I‚Äôm not expecting that.

I have progressed tremendously- last year this time I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to drive 15 minutes to therapy. Even sitting in therapy in person felt claustrophobic to me. My daily ‚Äúexposures‚Äù consisted of me driving to the gas station five minutes away for a coffee and on some days that felt impossible. 

I‚Äôve come to a point where I have done weekends away, driving highways ( with some limitations - distance is a big fear), meeting up with friends for coffee/lunch. I‚Äôve gone to weddings and rooftop events. I go to work every day, which part of my job is going to strangers homes for inspections. More or less back to normal with the main thing I‚Äôm working on now is driving the highway on my own more than 30 minutes (~an hr with someone with me)

Last year was the last straw, when I found out the night before that he had nothing planned at all. Instead, we were going to our nephew‚Äôs christening, which I already knew about, but my husband said there was a big surprise! Which was that his *brother and SIL* had a cake made for me and sang happy birthday at the christening party for their son. AND THAT WAS THE ENTIRE ‚ÄúPLAN‚Äù FOR MY BIRTHDAY. One my husband didn‚Äôt even come up with. I‚Äôm appreciative that my in laws did that for me because otherwise I would have just gotten nothing at all! 

I found out about this because I had asked him what we were doing for my birthday, and he just told me outright, with a happy tone of voice ‚Äî like it was such a great idea for me to celebrate my birthday at a toddler‚Äôs religious event with my husband and SIL‚Äôs family and *none* of my family or friends. He didn‚Äôt plan a dinner for the two of us or anything the preceding or following day.

The morning of my birthday, he woke me up with some store bought pastries and coffee. And this was only because I had gotten so mad at him the day before. But that was it, not even a card or flowers. We went to the christening and party as planned, and then just came home. I was so hurt and upset that I went to bed early and just slept, which was only possible because my mother in law was caring for our child.

This year, I did almost the exact same thing to him. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have a Brit Milah to take him to. But I got him a Walmart cake and a cup of coffee and nothing else. And every day after that, when he ate some leftover cake, he grumbled about how mediocre it was. Hahahahaha.

I know that he doesn‚Äôt have the self awareness to realize why this is happening and do better for my upcoming birthday, but I‚Äôm still satisfied. Not wasting any more of my effort for his birthdays or holidays!",18,1730467885.0,breakingmom,3,1.0,False

He asked what I was doing for Halloween and I said I was going as Olive from Easy A, and my ‚Äòfriend‚Äô was going to be the love interest Woodchuck Todd. He just was quiet at that. There was some talk of hooking up again. He emphasized that he wanted to make sure hooking up wasn‚Äôt the ONLY thing we did. So we didn‚Äôt that night.

Since then, he‚Äôs been texting pretty regularly. It‚Äôs flirty and fun, and he‚Äôs sent me songs with lyrics that hint at ‚Äúplaying it cool when you like someone,‚Äù which felt a bit pointed.

Our most recent hangout felt almost like a date. We grabbed chips and margaritas, went antiquing, flirted, and even made out a bit in the store. He slapped my butt a few times, and when I asked about his dating life, he claimed he wasn‚Äôt on the apps at the moment and seeing anyone (which I took with a grain of salt). He did ask if I liked the songs he sent, and I casually said yes, dropping the topic afterward.

Later, we ended up back at his place, hooked up, and then cuddled a bit. He asked for my opinion on his apartment decor as I walked around the place in his shirt, but soon left as he had to be up early for work. Afterward, he texted me saying, ‚ÄúSorry for the early night! Looks like you left me by my lonesome.‚Äù I joked that he ‚Äúkicked me out,‚Äù adding that I wouldn‚Äôt have minded staying over. He replied nervously with, ‚ÄúWell, the world‚Äôs our oyster! Who knows what the future holds üòÖ.‚Äù I told him to calm down, I‚Äôm just flirting. 

After thinking about it for a few hours, I realized I might actually have a crush on him. To avoid blurring lines further, I decided to be upfront. I texted him saying: ‚Äòidk if casual is for me. Not going to lie, I do have a crush. To keep things simple & stay friends, let‚Äôs take a step back, maybe pause on hanging out for a bit. Hope you understand.‚Äô

He responded: hi hi hi, sorry for taking so long to respond. I honestly think the friendship is a lot more important than the hooking up part, so if we need to take a step back and pause for a little while I‚Äôm perfectly OK with that. I‚Äôd rather keep the friendship intact, and I appreciate you saying all this.

I jokingly responded: Pardon my French, but why did I say ‚ÄòI like you‚Äô cryptically, & you politely said 'k' lol

I feel like I might have come across as needy. I‚Äôm not looking for a declaration of feelings from him, but I want to see if we‚Äôre on the same page about keeping things simple and staying friends. Part of me would be thrilled if he said he had a crush on me too, but I‚Äôm not expecting that.

Theres no chance of us ever getting back together, I just feel I need closure or whatever you call it.

After setting up the meet, I instantly felt better, nowhere close to where I was but better..

Do you guys think its a good Idea or not ?

I never had anxiety, depression or such, always had a very good self image, some would say too good, I was broken, I woke up this morning crying because of a damn dream.. 5:30 in the morning, I already struggle to sleep... got to end this shit feeling..

I'm here to share my experience, in the hope it can help somebody.
I'm not sure it counts as success story, I think it does, so anyway here it goes.
So, I've had some troubles since I was a teenager, but for the last 15y (i'm 39 now, almost 40), things got worse. I tried a lot of ""hacks"" from this sub (the recent post about probiotics reminded me to do tell my story) got disregarded by two diferent doctors, but nothing worked. The only thing I eventually discovered, from my own experience, was that dairy was not good for me, especially milk. Lactose free milk didn't work too, so I just keep off milk, and avoid other kinds of dairy most of time. However, this didn't solve my sudden urges to go to the bathroom I started getting at random hours for these last years since it got worse. Recently, I decided to try to keep off one other thing I noticed that I had introduced in my ""diet"" around the same time, and holy shit (pun intended), did it work. After a month off it and off milk and dairy, I suddently was able to have a normal life, go anywhere without worrying about having a bathroom close, not feeling gassy all the time, being with my friends without random awkward trips to the bathroom, or holding my gas all gases until they left, which was extremely unconfortable. It was the f-ing coffee! The worst part is I love coffee ;-;
Anyway, if you're reading this and never tried it, do it. Maybe you will get better too. Just remember it might take a whole month before your body's fully cleaned of it and notice any improvement.

1gh57w0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gh57w0/is_my_roomate_trying_to_get_me_kicked_out_after/,Is my roomate trying to get me kicked out after I've struggled with depression? [M29],"So I  have lived in this three bed property for around 6 years, I originally moved into this place with my ex and had two kids together before ending things almost 2 years ago amicably. After financialy struggling for 8 months after the split I offered someone I thought of as a friend if he wanted to move in and before to long he was set up in the room across the hall and started paying towards bills and rent.

Fast forward a fair bit of time and we stopped being friends and more just acquaintances who saw eachother on the off chance of bringing food back to our rooms, cooking or coming back from work. At this point I also have a new partner who is also living with me and paying her share however we have both recently been going through some very difficult situations both together and separately which has brought back alot of past trauma for us both resulting in a few months of being In a serious state of depression where unaliving seemed like a very viable option. 

The roomate has clearly been irritated with us struggling to clean up after ourselves which we have been trying to combat by just ordering takeaways so that we don't have to wash up apart from the odd cup for coffee. And even after my two kids come over on the weekend and the place gets messy we still get the place tidied up since we know he will say something.

The landlord is from an older generation and has absolutely no sympathy or understanding of mental health as she has proven in the past after doing ""inspections"" and complaining about not pulling up the weeds a month after I fell into another state of deep depression shortly after the initial breakup. She has also threatened to kick us out previously because the rubbish started to build up on the outdoor bins when I have been unable to get out of the house to move it to the street.

Today I received a message from the roomate saying that the landlord is coming to check on the leak coming from the ceiling in an hour and a half, the leak comes from the sealer around the bath coming away so when someone has a shower it leaks through. So we have been having baths to prevent this but I am aware the landlord definitely needs to fix the ceiling side sooner rather than later. She is aware of this as she has not long done an inspection and mentioned it then and to tell her if it starts doing it again. 

I have struggled to clean but have pushed myself to atleast try not to create more of a mess but the house does look loved in for sure and with how unsympathetic the landlord is It really would surprise me if when she came to check the ceiling she would comment on any imperfections and would consider kicking us out rather than fixing the ceiling which would result in me losing the property my kids grew up in and I'd struggle to find another place to live.

The roomate had been away for 4 days and only came back this morning to drop off his bag in his room and then go back out, that's shortly before I received his message about the landlord. The way I see it is he has seen that I haven't finished the washing up or tidied up some of the mess in those 4 days and as a way of lashing out at me without starting an argument he has asked the landlord to come and check the ceiling knowing that myself or my partner will panic and try to clean up the place before they come round. My partner struggles alot with mental health and this isn't the first time he has tried to manipulate her into cleaning up after him as a portion of the mess is his anyway.

So at the moment I feel like he has tried to go behind my back to the landlord. But I'm not sure if I'm just spiralling and thinking the worst of him or if he actually set all this up to try and get my kicked out. 

Also a side note that idk if I'm reading too much into and might seem minor but there were two washing up sponges on the side last night and after he came left this morning they have both disappeared. Part of me thinks he took them when he left after getting pissed off about the washing not being done but idk if he is that level or malicious/petty or not.

Any advice on if I am in my own head and thinking the worst of people or not would be appreciated. Thanks in advance

Obviously, since we‚Äôre still young and only two, we‚Äôre not doing great at managing all at once, so our house has been a total trash, the kitchen full of molding stuff, expired food, dirty clothes everywhere, and don‚Äôt even get me started with the living room (where my mom and my sister stay and sleep), the bathroom or just the scent of the house. 

We‚Äôve recently been on a fall break from school, and since the mold around the house made me sick so many time I decided that since I didn‚Äôt have to worry about school for two weeks, I could clean around, so I‚Äôve been deep cleaning the kitchen and doing the dishes everyday. The topic of the dishes used to be a vicious circle; since the dishwasher was already full of dishes, they‚Äôd led the dishes around, and if we let the dishes around piling up, the dishwasher would stay full of dishes when we have the little time to turn it on. It‚Äôs been a week and a half and I finally managed to get the kitchen back in order, so the dishwasher is free and I empty it as soon as the cycle is done so we can directly store the dishes inside and just turn it on once it‚Äôs full, which I‚Äôve managed well for a day already. 


Now the main thing is, my sister doesn‚Äôt help at all. While the dishwasher is empty, the sink too and the table too plus is clean, she keep putting dishes wherever there‚Äôs space and dirty everything. Whenever she‚Äôd cook something for herself, she‚Äôd let all the rest on the table, even though I repeated to her many time to tidy up after herself since there are flies anyway in our house (they won‚Äôt leave because nobody helps me throw the trash on a daily basis and they‚Äôve been accumulating since I started deep cleaning the kitchen), even if we‚Äôre literally in November. So, I just straight up told her I wouldn‚Äôt take care of her mess nor the dishes if she didn‚Äôt even try to keep the kitchen in order. It‚Äôs already been a day and the dishes are already starting to pile up on the table, and Im honestly scared that it will go back to its initial state since school starts again in a couple days and I wouldn‚Äôt have time to manage the dishes like during the holidays, though I want her to understand she can‚Äôt keep expecting me to clean after her and pick up her dishes wherever she left them. Not only the dishes are piling up on the table, but also on the coffee table in the living room, on her desk etc. 


And no, it‚Äôs not because of her mental state, she‚Äôs also been trying to get back on tracks, except she just focus on herself, sleep, eat and do whatever self care to her heart‚Äôs content while she‚Äôd leave me to deal with the rest, including taking care of our mother and making her food.

So, would I be in the wrong if I left the dishes? (Im so sorry I can‚Äôt stop blabbing there are while paragraphs for nothing but I wanted to add the context ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)",1,1730467150.0,WouldIBeTheAhole,0,0.99,False

We tried dating briefly at the beginning of 2020, but the pandemic and a bit of distance created tension. He became distant, I ended things, and eventually, he started dating someone else. A few months later, he called & apologized for how things ended, and we reconnected as friends due to our shared industry, where burning bridges isn‚Äôt ideal.

Fast forward four years, and we coincidentally end up living in the same city. We kept bumping into each other at local coffee shops, chatting casually, and decided to reconnect as friends. Over time, we began hanging out more frequently, but it was purely platonic.

A couple of months ago, we were catching up, and he mentioned his dating experiences. How no one was catching his interest. Since we were talking relationships, I told him I‚Äôd been in an open relationship, which was getting messy. He just listened, and nothing came of it. A month or two later, I was fresh out of that breakup, though he didn‚Äôt know it yet. He then asked me out for drinks as a thank-you for a work favor I‚Äôd done for him.

In early October, we got those drinks and had an amazing night out ‚Äî cocktails, arcade games, a rooftop bar, and a lot of talking. He was noticeably flirty. I eventually confided in him about my recent breakup, but I asked him not to ‚Äúmake it weird.‚Äù He got even flirtier. We ended up back at his place, where he touched my legs a bit, but nothing happened. I fell asleep in his bed, and he took the couch.

The following week, I invited him over while I was house-sitting nearby. We stayed up until 2 a.m., watching my favorite movie I told him he HAD to watch. The whole time, he was being flirty, touching my legs, and eventually acknowledging, ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre both trying to figure out what we want here.‚Äù I told him I was down to hook up, but made it clear that, fresh out of a breakup, I wasn‚Äôt looking for romance. I wanted to set that boundary so he wouldn‚Äôt feel pressured into anything more than fun and friendship.

We hooked up that night. A few days later, he invited me to work with him at a coffee shop. He was casual, just talking like a friend. I asked if our hookup had made things weird and suggested that if it did, we didn‚Äôt have to do it again. He replied that he actually wanted to ‚Äúdo that a bunch more times.‚Äù So, a few days later, we met for drinks, talked, and kept things light. He asked what I was doing for Halloween and I said I was going as Olive from Easy A, and my ‚Äòfriend‚Äô was going to be the love interest Woodchuck Todd. He just was quiet at that. There was some talk of hooking up again. He emphasized that he wanted to make sure hooking up wasn‚Äôt the ONLY thing we did. So we didn‚Äôt that night.

Afterward, he texted me saying, ‚ÄúSorry for the early night! Looks like you left me by my lonesome.‚Äù I joked that he ‚Äúkicked me out,‚Äù adding that I wouldn‚Äôt have minded staying over. He replied nervously with, ‚ÄúWell, the world‚Äôs our oyster! Who knows what the future holds üòÖ.‚Äù I told him to calm down, I‚Äôm just flirting. 

After thinking about it for a few hours, I realized I might actually have a crush on him. To avoid blurring lines further, I decided to be upfront. I texted him saying that I wasn‚Äôt sure casual was working for me, admitted I had a small crush, and suggested we take a step back and maybe pause hanging out to keep things simple and respect the friendship.

Now, he hasn‚Äôt responded, and I feel like I might have come across as needy. I‚Äôm not looking for a declaration of feelings from him, but I want to see if we‚Äôre on the same page about keeping things simple and staying friends. Part of me would be thrilled if he said he had a crush on me too, but I‚Äôm not expecting that.

Any advice on navigating this confusing FWB situation? Help!

UPDATE: he responded

‚ÄúHi hi hi sorry it‚Äôs taken so long to respond.

I honestly think the friendship is a lot more important than the hooking up part, so if we need to take a step back and pause for a little while I‚Äôm perfectly OK with that. I‚Äôd rather keep the friendship intact, and I appreciate you saying all this.‚Äù

1gh539p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gh539p/aita_for_consistently_asking_to_leave_work_early/,AITA for consistently asking to leave work early?,"I (21f) started working at a coffee shop around three months ago, and have committed more effort and responsibility to this job than any other I‚Äôve had. I consistently work 35-40 hours a week, cover dozens of shifts for my coworkers, and try hard to keep up with the duties associated with the workplace. I‚Äôm not perfect by any means, and in this lies the issue.

Within the past month or so, I‚Äôve built up a large amount of fatigue from working more than what I‚Äôm used to. This has, admittedly resulted in lower productivity in my workplace, and has also manifested in me often asking my manager and coworkers if it would be alright if I left around an hour prior to the end of my shift. I always caveat by saying I‚Äôm more than okay with staying if they still need me, but a recent incident this morning with my manager (22f) has put this pattern of behavior in perspective for me.

This morning around three hours after opening I experienced severe discomfort and was in the restroom for around twenty minutes. I eventually came out and asked my manager if I could leave early, telling her I felt sick. She then pretty dismissively said ‚Äúno‚Äù before clarifying after a few seconds that ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always asking to leave early, but it‚Äôs your job to finish your shift or let me know ahead of time that you‚Äôre sick or need someone to cover. If you really feel sick, I understand and you can go.‚Äù

Afterwards I went home where I had a discussion/argument with my stepmom (47f) where she said that my manager has every right to be upset with me, and that my behavior is clearly stressing her out and annoying her. I said I felt like I carry my weight and contribute a lot to my store, and that I could be afforded a little leeway. In retrospect now as I type this out, it feels clear to me that I‚Äôm acting in an irresponsible way. Am I the asshole?",1,1730466864.0,AmItheAsshole,21,0.56,False

My refiner wanted to charge ¬£¬£¬£ for a special service to do this and would not handle ‚Äúhuman remains‚Äù through the ordinary melt & assay service. Had I known that I probably wouldn‚Äôt have bought the teeth in the scrap parcel.
I am not able to burn the teeth out (don‚Äôt have the equipment) and am not prepared to smash them out with a hammer-which means I will need to dissolve the teeth.
Has anyone done this before and can advise on the process?
My first thought was Coca Cola but I think that will take too long and may not get the job fully done. Other ideas included descaler - the liquid you use to get timescale out of kettles and coffee machines, but I don‚Äôt know if this would be strong enough either. We use Troy acids to test metals and can get these acids but only in small quantities. I‚Äôm not sure which bottle is which acid (ie nitric/sulfuric/hydrogloric) and what exact strength it is.
Please can any share any advice from experience.

I am ready to upgrade from my baby gadget espresso machine. I‚Äôm looking at three options right now. I typically make three or less coffees per day, mostly lattes in the morning. I have been using Nespresso machines for over a decade and like their convenience, but have always felt unfulfilled with the coffee it produces. I also have a shardor grinder that seems to be doing the trick, for now üòâ

My first option is to go with a Gaggia Evo classic and add a PID module. I believe Gaggia makes excellent machines for home use. I also like its footprint as well as warm-up time since it has a smaller boiler. The Price point today on Amazon (WLL) is $400 for a new 2024 unit, can‚Äôt beat that.

My second option is the Rancilio Silva base model. I am impressed with the reviews about their durability as well as shot consistency. Plus I like the clean, simple look of the machine. There appears to be many used ones for sale and I came across this Rancilio set of Sylvia and Rocky grinder. Not sure how old this combo is but seems like a nice set up. It also seems the base Sylvia has changed much over the last 10 years. I could probably get it for about $500. Ideally, I love the XP pro (double boiler) but that is pretty much overkill for my volume and is a taller unit. Cabinet clearance is 15 ¬æ inches.

My third option is a used Rocket Apartamento. I know it‚Äôs a good machine and likely overkill as well but it‚Äôs so cool and simply a beauty to look at. I think I could get it for a little under $1300. 

I know this might seem all over the board, but in the end, I‚Äôm looking to make good consistent espresso without too much fuss, which is why I‚Äôm really set on a unit that has a PID or I would add one separately.  Looking at these machines and reviews is a little overwhelming. But I think I am getting there. 

Your help, comments, and guidance is greatly appreciated.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

# 50 [M4F] #Boston #Mass Romance and Face Sitting

>Hello my lovelies! Looking for love this crisp Autumn season? Well look no further! Me to! I‚Äôm a married dad of five wonderful kids and an amazing wife, but yes I want more. I guess I‚Äôm at that point in life where things just feel stale. Home life just feels so boring and I need an adventure, a hobby, something to add that spark to life!

>I‚Äôm a Caucasian man from the south side of Boston, 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 230 lbs (HWP), blonde hair, dad bod. I consider myself a romantic and also I‚Äôm into extreme kinks. Best of both worlds, really. I like to think of myself as a connoisseur of the anal arts.

>My hobbies include hiking, motocross, The Patriots, sex, and my competitive bowling league.

>I‚Äôm interested in females ages 25-40, preferably black or Hispanic but I‚Äôm open to all races. Must be HWP. Not super picky just be very kinky. Looking for something long term.

>I am new to this so I am looking for someone who has done this before and who has PATIENCE. I‚Äôm not the quickest learner but once I get it I got it.

>I have Kik to communicate if we move from this platform. If you like what I‚Äôm offering and want to message me, message me here! Would love to here from you!

# 22 F4M #London want to know what im missing out on

>Hiya, just gonna be honest, I've been with the same guy since we were both 14/15 in year 10 and he's to date the only guy I've ever been with, lost my virginity with him at 17 and to be honest I've always been really unsatisfied with how it is in bed between us. To be brutally honest, he's far too vanilla for me and he's pretty small down there. I like him a lot and see a future with him, but i wanna at least know what I'm missing.

>I just wanna at least know what it's like, to do stuff with a guy who isn't afraid to be dominant, to take the lead and take what he wants. Someone who wants to just bend me over and take me rough, rather than the same old boring slow paced missionary and unfulfilling experience, and preferably someone bigger than him down there.

>I'm 5""5' and around 7 and a half stone so on the smaller side myself, I'm a quarter asian and it kinda shows in my eyes but thats about it. Generally petite build.

>I'm happy to elaborate on any questions or anything like that in dms as well as share pics, but not post them to my account for obvious reasons in case for whatever reason he happens to see them. He follows my main too hence the throwaway account. I cant host either of course so we'll have to work around that. Please message if interested!

>I was standing in a single person unisex restroom (location not necessary, we both definitely remember it) when I started peeing all over the wall because you were banging on the door so hard and so loud that my heart skipped three beats. While trying to catch my breath and not pee on the ceiling (scared stiff mean anything to you?) you started screaming through the door that you were in the process of shitting your pants and begged me to leave. I was finishing zipping my pants as I went to unlock the door you kicked it in like a squad of SWAT team members and knocked my back into the room causing me to zip my penis. You quickly ripped down your pants and shot something out at supersonic speed. Horrified I ran out with my mini-me painfully looking at all the onlookers. I didn't get arrested. Thank god.

>I just want to meet you again under normal circumstances (ugh that word rings a little too close to home right now) because I think you were pretty hot and loved your assertiveness. You know who you are.

**Price Movement Recap**

[10\/31 Trading Day 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/2yyz6bf6x9yd1.png?width=1247&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba084b5e3140333279f63e49dc028f4ce1deea9)

So, indeed, traders seem to have come to the same conclusions I did in assessing Wednesday's price action, namely that momentum has shifted toward selling IV. The price show down off the open to our large positive gamma position at $22 and then abruptly reversed to the upside \*almost\* to $23 on what was essentially the main trade of the day. After a few attempts to see-saw the price in our upper VWAP channel, traders flipped back to selling Calls into the close. Overall, the day was mildly bearish and total options premiums spent dipped by about half versus our trading on Wednesday.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

Max Pain remains constant at $21 heading into this week's expiry as traders look primarily to be adjusting their positions to prepare for potentially calmer seas heading into November. 

[11\/1 OI Changes 10\/31-11\/1](https://preview.redd.it/vxdnbmkqw9yd1.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=f672bac073f90cdbe23aa642ac80f2b6fba1b708)

Unsurprisingly, we got a lot of profit taking, rolling, and loss cutting heading into today's trading. Closing predominates across our chain with only the $23 call and $21.5 put positions showing meaningful OI expansion, both of about evenly mixed bullish and bearish trades. 

[11\/8 OI Changes 10\/31-11\/1](https://preview.redd.it/ijht3vevw9yd1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=a82adea0deaa3e95627e66c707408e8e12a8a479)

Our nearest two expiries after this Friday, however, were rather light. With a few hundred contracts sprinkled across some key strikes. Major decisions on how to play 11/8 and 11/15 seem to be waiting in the wings, as the OI across these two strikes combined - despite the fact that November is a fast approaching monthly OPEX - does not equate to what is still open for today's trading despite all of yesterday's closures. 

[11\/15 OI Changes 10\/31-11\/1](https://preview.redd.it/g79zve11x9yd1.png?width=1060&format=png&auto=webp&s=59574b567b9e89d2ba1f11df0c062df70b3842f3)

If we look a bit farther out to 12/20 and 1/17, we saw very little activity yesterday. 

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/b7adw6orx9yd1.png?width=526&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc24f05ba676852fb9d3c00213b199f64ac69143

Our most likely trading range for the day, per MM gamma exposure, is between $22 and $23. Yesterday's trading affirmed support at $22 and set up the reversal principal trade for the day (which it looks like everyone and their mother took). $22 and $23 serve as highly volatility suppressant positions which will require some determined commitment to overcome or circumvent. 

If volume has some reason to pick back up today (some news or shorts closing positions opened during Wednesday's trading) and we work our way back down on the early side to $22, it's possible our elevated volume recreates some of the upward volatility conditions (with a lower ceiling) that we saw earlier in the week. There still does not appear to be any serious risk of major downside volatility.

**Technicals**

[7\/16-10\/29 1-Day Aggregation w\/ Doodle Projection](https://preview.redd.it/z2az6c7p4ayd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=3913b4e88110a985fc5eca6d84cc180651512111)

[7\/16-10\/31 1-Day Aggregation Actual](https://preview.redd.it/0ecmtlwk4ayd1.png?width=1486&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4aec98ff2054cfc6c28406c771633ce47923e81)

Probably the most important element for the continued stability of our just-emerging bullish uptrend is the integrity of $22 as a support level. Our positive MM Gamma exposure is in place today and into next week to coax traders to maintain $22 as a meaningfully supportive technical level. Perhaps we get another sizable reversal trade off of $22 like we did yesterday. Perhaps we dip to around $21.75 or so and reverse on a 'fake-out' 50-day SMA breach. It is difficult to speculate meaningfully from our technicals here, so I will only reiterate the importance of support around $22. Showcasing this type of elevated stability would likely inspire some options bets to insert closer to our current price levels and a larger leg-up into December earnings.

Another factor which might lead to some support in this regard is one I dug up from reviewing some of Keith's livestreams, tweets, and charts from the Q4 2020 run-up in the stock, namely concerning RSI values on the WEEKLY chart.

During the late 2020 uptrend, Keith specifically called out the weekly RSI overbought value (RSI > 70) as a key indicator on intra-trend reversals on the GME stock price. He also gestured to this in his edited RoryKittinger charts via his birthday livestream in June of this year. So I decided to take a look at GME RSI values for the past few years since the Sneeze. Take a look yourselves:

[11\/1\/2020 - 11\/1\/2024 1-Week Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/zkh0cnz77ayd1.png?width=1487&format=png&auto=webp&s=e01c7e0dee21c7e7b8385bcfa1371e273efdbb69)

If we look at trading year 2021, some technical elements stand out. 1) MACD stayed consistently above the accumulation line right until the end of the year. 2) RSI stayed ABOVE the neutral mark of 50 for the entirety of the year. Touches of the RSI neutral mark generally signaled bullish reversals in the stock price. You'll notice in particular that right up until the week of 11/29/21, the large bullish pennant on GME remained intact with higher lows and lower highs which corresponded to implicitly negotiated RSI levels. 

After 11/29/21, however, GME's RSI behavior FLIPPED. The pennant broke down on the stock and transformed into a 3-year bull flag. MACD crossover fell BELOW the accumulation line at 2021 year end and RSI neutral (= 50) became a RESISTANCE level, rather than a support level. As you can see on the chart above, all of these factors remained in place until...

...May 2024. At this point, RSI and MACD entered into flip mode, completely reversing their midline orientations.  Here are our RSI values over the past two months enlarged:

[Cross = RSI 50](https://preview.redd.it/6uwylqyi9ayd1.png?width=1486&format=png&auto=webp&s=911f28a12696744ac0992cb95a10fcca3cbdb1ab)

It took all the way from the May run until GME Q2 earnings on 9/10 for RSI to cool off from overbought (RSI > 70) and touch RSI Neutral. Each time this has occurred, the stock price has reversed, bringing RSI back over 50. Last week was our third dip below 50, midweek, and, like clockwork, this week we reversed.

Let me state that again more succinctly: GME triple-bottomed last week on its implicitly negotiated WEEKLY RSI support.

What does this mean?

I suspect that Keith - and possibly Cohen as well (Yolo, TITS) is telling us that this is the bullish signal of all bullish signals for a macro uptrend that will not correct until we re-enter RSI overbought on the weekly chart.

When will this begin?

It's beginning now.

When did institutions set up for this?

They have already been setting up for it and will set-up for it throughout November. 

When will the price start to walk up?

November 29, 2021 was the beginning of the macro bearish RSI flip after the Sneeze. It's possible this could have occurred via 3-year swaps or some similar can-kick derivative (no idea). This is also about two weeks prior to GME earnings (Charts say Dec 4, I think they will be released on Dec 11 and this is a fake-out to mess with trader calculations like the Sept 4 estimate). If this is correct, bullish price divergence leading into earnings would coincide with a substantial IV appreciation thump, which, if GME earnings are good, might cause an explosion into December OPEX... which is strangely a TINY, HIGHLY concentrated options chain whose calls do not exceed the $30 strike **unlike every other options chain we've seen for the entire year and which is available for the next two years.**

Maybe we start to grind up right away, maybe we look for daily support signals first. I don't know. This is TA, remember. But maybe I'm right here...

**IV Trends**

https://preview.redd.it/2hssleitbayd1.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=75b1e259e8f4879ddd1bc12d79b50467f41588f3

I suspect that IV will zig-zag down on a depreciative trend for a fair bit of November (as suggested above) before beginning an earnings-anticipatory trend around the end of the month. If options volume pulls back, we might expect traders and institutions to be getting cash ready to set themselves up to blow this thing out of the water in December after Q3 earnings. We will have to watch.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

Our daily and weekly outlooks are on the calmer side for now. The key points of observation: we look for support at $22, look to respect the 50-day SMA on the daily chart, and look to respect our RSI neutral support on the weekly chart. Not only do all these indicators roughly coincide with one another currently, but MM Gamma Exposure also offers substantial downside volatility suppression at $22 into the end of this week and next. Verdict? I'm tempering expectations for the short term, expecting some rinsing up and down our $22-$23 range, but, ultimately, watching and preparing for the requel. It's reality looks more and more likely with each passing day.

Cheers

""Fine. I'll do it myself.""

""OMG He's going for a requel!""

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER:¬†These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor.

1gh4qkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1gh4qkk/help_me_get_uninterrupted_sleep/,Help me get uninterrupted sleep!,"I would like help debugging my sleep issues. I believe and physically feel like sleep is the #1 determinant of my health and mental performance at work.

How do you think I could change in order to better? Should I be taken something, should I be changing my behavior / habits?

My main issue right now is that I don‚Äôt sleep uninterrupted through the night. I typically wake up at least once and it‚Äôs challenging to go back a sleep. I do not have issues falling asleep, but waking up through the night happens pretty much daily.

When I wake up in the middle of the night, I do not feel sleepy. I can tell I‚Äôm tired and do not have enough sleep, but I still feel alert. If I had to guess, it happens halfway through my goal of 8hrs of sleep. Last night, I woke up at 2am when I feel asleep at 10pm. I typically pee when I wake up, but I‚Äôm not certain this would be the cause. It may correlation, not causation.

Context on me:
I‚Äôm a 29 year old male software engineer working for what is essentially a startup. I‚Äôve worked mostly for startup sized companies since 22. 
Size 10-200.

 I‚Äôve never considered myself to necessarily gifted at sleeping as I think I‚Äôm pretty sensitive to noise or sleeping in places like cars. I can‚Äôt fall asleep in a plane without a heavy dose of THC üòÖ

I don‚Äôt feel like I particularly had trouble sleeping as a kid through high school, maybe some through college but not much. I think it‚Äôs mostly started in my professional career at age 22.

I use to drink 1 or 2 cups of coffee a day, but have since quit coffee all together. I‚Äôm a couple months clean.

I developed an autoimmune disease 1 year ago which has been linked to stress called Alopecia areata. Big motivating factor for quitting coffee.

Other things about me. I have a girlfriend, but we don‚Äôt live together yet and I‚Äôve lived alone for the past few years up until now, where I have one roommate that I found online. He‚Äôs pretty anti social.

My theory:
I think I‚Äôm generally an anxious person. I tend to worry about things. My programming job is intense with high expectations. I work from 8:30-5PM M-F and the expectation is to be really productive. I think that working intensely throughout the day causes this ‚Äúattention residue‚Äù where the default thing that I think and worry about after work is work. It feels really hard to get away from that. Working out or meditation doesn‚Äôt seem to quite cut it, although they help. I need something to achieve escape velocity from the gravity of work.

What I‚Äôve found most effective is to be in social environments outside with people who are chatting about unrelated topics. This allows my brain to sort of load a different program in memory and clear out the old one (work). Then the attention residue shifts to the activity I did or conversation I had.

Sleep hygiene maintained regularly:
- no phone use an hour before bed
- to eat dinner by 8pm if I‚Äôm going to bed by 10pm

Sleep hygiene experimented with:
- meditate once a day, potentially before bed. I have the ‚Äúinsight timer‚Äù app.
- try to get the morning sun in my eyes to set the circadian clock. Same with sunset. Not always possible
- I‚Äôve started practicing pelvic floor exercises somewhat irregularly to see if it allows me to hold in pee better so that having to pee doesn‚Äôt wake me up

Other sleep notes:
- I don‚Äôt regularly set an alarm, but I do try to get in bed at around 10pm or 10:30. I do not set an alarm because I do not feel confident in my ability to get good quality sleep by that time.

Exercise:
- I workout 2-4 times a week formally, it‚Äôs a bit inconsistent, I don‚Äôt have a routine.",1,1730465870.0,sleep,0,1.0,False
1gh4qkh,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1gh4qkh/here_are_all_of_the_fragrances_i_sampled_and/,Here are all of the fragrances I sampled and reviewed in October 2024.,"**Stora Skuggan Fant√¥me de Maules** Ghost roads converging on a cemetery, whispers of a green-cloaked figure vanishing into mist. Fant√¥me de Maules unfurls like a secret, a sylvan, spectral musk, dark green twilight gleaming through branches, hovering just above the skin. The green here isn't lush or vibrant, but austere ‚Äì the color of twilight filtering through pine needles. There's a whisper of lavender, more herbal than floral, and a hint of dry, shadowy spice ‚Äì prickly subterranean murmurs from some hidden place. I catch wisps of mossy flowers through the mist, their fragrance elusive and fleeting, obscured by that omnipresent veil of cool, verdant fog. It's beautiful, in a melancholy way, like stumbling upon abandoned ruins in a forgotten glade. The scent carries a weight of isolation, of time stretching endlessly through silent forests, the grass and loam of secret paths trodden by solitary feet. The bittersweet ache of chosen seclusion, of a world deliberately left behind. The gossamer soapy-powdery aspect feels like a fading remnant of civilization, washed away by years of woodland solitude. It's a fragrance whose presence is defined by absence, a mystery I'm not sure I want to unravel ‚Äì what's missing, or why it matters.

**Clue Warm Bulb** opens with a subtle but singular blend of fuzzed salinity combined with the scent of a heating element, evoking the imagined aroma of a Himalayan salt lamp covered in a fine patina of dust. I have several of these lamps, and mine don't smell like much of anything in particular, but this opening is always how I thought they would smell. It's the essence of warm, mineralized air, like you could smell the soft, pinky-orange glow emanating from rough-hewn salt crystals beneath a thin veil of settled particles. The fragrance makes me think of the lamp's alleged ability to ionize the air, creating an olfactory impression of a purified, slightly electric atmosphere tinged with a hint of neglect. As it develops, the scent undergoes an unexpected transition, as if a forgotten offering has been left near the lamp's warm glow: a small dried bouquet and a marshmallow, both altered by proximity to the salt lamp's warmth and accumulated residue. Imagine pressed flowers; their colors faded but still discernible, mingled with the powdery sweetness of a marshmallow slowly desiccating in the lamp's ambient heat, all covered by a ghostly layer of time's passage. Though not a scent that wildly excited me, Warm Bulb's quiet journey from dusty, electrified minerals to withered floral sweetness proved to be an interesting olfactory experience, even just to think about and write about, if not to wear.

**Crushed Fruits from Regime des Fleurs** shimmers and unfurls like an overripe reverie, fruit flesh and flowers awakening from brandy-soaked slumber; an ultraviolet tumble of plums, an infrared rush of raspberries, a kaleidoscopic cascade woven through the fold of a forgotten black velvet painting, glossy and dripping and beckoning with the urgency of a thousand hummingbird hearts. That 1970s canvas time-shifts into a 1990s dress, empire-waisted, bell-sleeved, phantom filigree choker at the throat, echoes of stompy boots, an ambery oxblood slash of Spice or Black Honey staining ghost-lips. A current of boozy bitterness and dusky incense, a smoky scent of hazy late neon nights bleeding into dawn, of kisses that taste like vintage lipstick from a dream you haven't had yet but always remember the moment before waking.

**Arcana Wildcraft Daydreams of Trees** is an olfactory landscape that defies botanical reality. Though violets are conspicuously absent from the listed notes, they emerge as unmistakable titans, ascending to arboreal majesty in a fantastical forest. In this otherworldly realm, violet blooms tower like gentle giants, their presence both awe-inspiring and benevolent. Colossal purple petals the size of skyscrapers, soft, velvety, and gossamer-thin despite their impossible scale, filter the sunlight, casting an ethereal glow that's mirrored in the scent's interplay of light and shadow. Beneath them, a tapestry of green unfurls - crisp, resinous, alive with the whispers of coniferous giants paying homage to their violet overlords. A cool breeze carries hints of herbal sweetness, mingling with the earthy richness of the forest floor below. These floral kaiju drift through the fragrance like benign Mothras, their movements sending waves of sweet, powdery aroma cascading through the air. The very essence of the forest seems to pulse throughout - a complex amalgam of woody warmth and floral opulence as if the boundary between tree and flower has dissolved completely. Daydreams of Trees is a perfumed dreamscape of quiet grandeur, a world where towering floral sentinels stand watch over a woodland transformed by their vast, violet shadow.

**Carnival Wax Deathtrap** is a smoky vanilla-incense-sandalwood-resin scent full of vaguely oracular pronouncements; it smells profound in some indefinable way. It wraps me in a nebulous aura of mystery and hazy hidden knowledge - though no one knows who hid this knowledge, why they bothered, or if anyone's actually looking for it. I go about my daily routine feeling like a walking enigma, a bearer of arcane secrets, while everyone else is probably just wondering why I smell like a dusty old pile of books or some such. Deathtrap transforms me into the keeper of a cosmic puzzle that nobody asked for; it has cast a spell on me, convincing me of its intense profundity while simultaneously robbing me of the ability to articulate why. Trying to explain its essence is like grasping at the fading wisps of a vivid dream. The words hover just out of reach, shimmering with meaning, only to dissipate the moment I open my mouth. I'm left with nothing but a lingering sense of having touched something mystically significant, even if I can't quite remember what or how.

**Cocoa Pink Paper Butterfly** is a lilting confectionary cradlesong of lightness, sweetness, and softness ‚Äì frosted tea cakes, sugary breakfast cereal milk, delicate pearls of vanilla musk, and wisps of phantom florals. But like all lullabies, it carries an undercurrent of melancholy beneath its gentle exterior. Why are the songs we sing to innocent babes so often tinged with sadness? And so, somehow, this sweetness and light immediately draws forth a wistfulness from deep within. It's a perfume that deserves its own entry in The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows ‚Äì

*Paperiperhonen /pa.pe.ri.per.ho.nen/ n.*

*-A state of being in which one finds comfort in gentle sorrow, like being wrapped in a lace shawl knitted from memories and dreams, a cocoon of bittersweet reverie.*

*-The paradoxical sensation of feeling most alive when embracing one's melancholy, finding unexpected depth and richness in the quieter, darker emotional landscapes.*

*-A moment of bittersweet clarity in which the veil between joy and sorrow dissolves, revealing that our deepest mirth and most wrenching tears spring from the same well of human experience*

This fragrance doesn't smell of sadness, but it smells like sadness feels ‚Äì soft, sweet, and strangely comforting. And now, as I finally explore this sample from earlier in the summer, I'm struck by a new wave of melancholy: it was a limited edition, no longer available. This realization adds another layer to an already complex emotional experience, embodying the very fleeting beauty it captures.

**Mihan Aromatics Mikado Bark** is a cozy, comforting scent without any of the typical hallmarks perfumes of coziness and comfort rely on. It's not rich or foody, and I would not say it's overly nostalgic in any particular way. It's a fragrance whose spicy, woody notes are all not exactly ghosts of themselves, but they've all been shushed and hushed, and all together, their muted echoes harmonize with exquisite subtlety. It's a perfume that hovers like a hazy veil, both grounding and uplifting in its gentle presence. It carries the softness of lamplight pooling in shadows at dusk, yet also evokes the fleeting warmth of sunlight piercing gloomy afternoon clouds. The scent invites introspection, smoothing sharp edges and muting bold tones into a delicate accord. It's as if familiar aromatic notes have been reimagined - their essence captured, then softened and warmed. The fragrance conjures the image of a lone verdant remnant amid a sea of faded crimson and rust as October yields to November's chill. Lingering in the air, it embodies the autumnal, contemplative spirit of hobbits, reimagined as a gremlincore playlist steeped in hauntological reverb.

Two fragrances from **Solstice Scents** immediately conjured some very specific imagery for me...!

**Devil's Tongue:** Beelzebub thunders into Bike Week, his presence a tempest of lime and leather. Ancient wings, creased like a well-worn jacket, flex as he grips chrome handlebars slick with condensation from his frosty margarita. The air crackles with a zesty electricity, mixing citrus sting with infernal heat in a heady cocktail. Beneath his wheels, the earth exhales a deep, earthy groan - a mix of smoke and unholy soil that speaks of vast, wicked subterranean realms. At the edge of town, he pulls into a ubiquitous coffee franchise, the aroma of seasonal vanilla latte cutting through the infernal haze. The barista, unfazed by the sulfurous fumes, squints at the order screen and asks with practiced cheer, ""Is that for Beelz, or is it Bub?"" The Lord of Flies accepts his steaming cup, his ""thanks, babe"" shrieking out in a voice that's part anglerfish daydreams, part chiropteran echolocation. With a final rev that sounds like the gates of hell grinding open, Beelzebub toodles off into the sunset, leaving behind a trail of vanilla-tinged brimstone and the faintest whiff of lime-kissed leather.

**Thornwood Thicket:** In the depths of the thicket, juicy purple orbs split open, birthing a swarm of cooing, jellied creatures that multiply with alarming speed. Sticky berry nectar drips from gnarled branches, transforming these chirping morsels into mischievous imps that skitter through the underbrush, their numbers doubling with each twig they snap. Ancient trees groan under the weight of the burgeoning horde, their woody sighs mingling with the fruity frenzy. The forest floor pulses, a living carpet of vegetation that shivers and expands, sprouting more berry-scented fiends with each quiver. Every breath draws in air thick with frenetic, fragrant energy as these jammy juggernauts overrun the woodland, their sweet symphony rising to a fever pitch. The once-serene grove twists into an ever-expanding maze of berry-fueled bedlam, leaving visitors dizzy in a haze of multiplying aromas and rambunctious, fruit-filled pandemonium.

***

Christopher avoided his bed that evening. He told himself that he simply wasn‚Äôt tired yet, that he was engrossed in the documentary he was watching, that he would go to bed in just a few more minutes. He said good night to his wife and stayed up in his chair, letting the flickering images from the television wash over him without really processing them at all.

He knew it was late. He was terrified to look at his phone and find that it was 12:15 AM. When he finally caved and took a look, it was both a shock and a relief to see that it was past 4 AM. It was far too late to pretend that sleep was still in his future. Christopher instead headed for the kitchen to put on a pot of coffee and begin his day.

As he rose from his chair, his left foot caught on something. He looked down and, for just an instant, saw railroad ties and tarred gravel in place of his carpeted floors. He panicked and yanked his leg away, only to stumble and nearly fall as he met no resistance.

The phantom train tracks were gone. Christopher had stepped on his own slippers, laying where he had kicked them off hours before. There was no train. There had not been for forty years.

He put extra grounds into the coffee, hoping an extra dose of caffeine would perk him up more fully. He had not consciously meant to stay up the entire night, but it was obvious that he had done so in an effort to avoid whatever was happening in his dreams, whatever was letting Jason attempt to break through.

It was also obvious that it had not been enough.

Perhaps it shouldn‚Äôt be. Was Christopher wrong to fight this? He‚Äôd gotten forty more years than Jason had. That was forever to a sixteen year old, an unimaginable stretch of time. It was more than he had ever deserved. Maybe he should just give up.

*You gave up on Jason that night*, his mind whispered. *Why pretend you‚Äôre something you‚Äôre not? Why fight now?*

Christopher swigged his coffee, wincing at the heat and the harshness. He tried to shove the thought away.

It refused to leave. His carefully sealed doors had been forced open. The thoughts would no longer be contained. They were streaming out into the hallways of his mind, crowding and shouting, filling it with clamor and distress.

A message buzzed on Christopher‚Äôs phone. It was marked ‚ÄúAndrew Hernandez.‚Äù It had the picture of Drew that had been displayed in his obituary.

*Meet me at the bridge.*

Another bubble popped up below it, just as Christopher finished reading the first one.

*Jason‚Äôs waiting.*

The messages vanished, leaving Christopher staring at that blinding image of the train headlight that had been set as his background. He poked desperately at the settings, trying to find out how to change it. As he opened menus and looked for the display, an unknown number called his phone. Christopher was already touching the screen and accidentally answered the call.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù said a man‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù he demanded.

‚ÄúThis is Sanderson Therapy, sir. Who did you mean to call?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äîthought you called me.‚Äù The number had popped up as an incoming call. He had seen it. He was sure.

‚ÄúMaybe it was a crossed line.‚Äù The polite lie was evident in his tone.

‚ÄúWait.‚Äù Maybe it was a cosmic coincidence, or maybe Christopher had called them after all. His mind was certainly playing enough tricks on him lately. ‚ÄúI need to make an appointment. A consultation? I don‚Äôt really know how this works.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a problem. When do you want the appointment?‚Äù

‚ÄúAs soon as possible.‚Äù

‚ÄúHm.‚Äù He heard the ticking of keys. ‚ÄúWe have an opening today, in fact. Are you free at 12:15?‚Äù

Christopher froze. After a moment, he choked out, ‚ÄúJust past noon?‚Äù

‚ÄúAM, sir.‚Äù There was no trace of sarcasm in his response. ‚ÄúDo you know where we‚Äôre located? It‚Äôs down by the old train bridge. I know you know the way.‚Äù

Christopher struggled to hang up the phone, to pull it away from his ear, to do anything but listen as he droned on. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll want to make sure that you‚Äôre there on time. The doctor is very punctual. And very thorough.

‚ÄúI guarantee that by the time he‚Äôs done with you, you won‚Äôt have any problems left at all.‚Äù

The phone slipped from Christopher‚Äôs nerveless hands and clattered to the table. The train headlight leered at him. There was no call showing on the screen.

Christopher flipped the phone face down and stared wide-eyed at the wall for several long minutes. Finally, he turned the phone back over and opened the call history.

There was a call logged, a number he had just called. The phone claimed that it had been a failed connection. No one had answered.

The area code was his old hometown. Sanderson had been Jason‚Äôs last name. Deep in the recesses of his memory, he recognized that number.

A wave of exhaustion washed over Christopher, too titanic for the coffee to touch. He left the mug and his phone on the kitchen table and stumbled to his bedroom. Melissa was still asleep, and did not rouse when Christopher fell into bed. Whatever his dreams might bring could be no worse than what was happening while awake.

He was asleep within seconds.

Moments later, Melissa was shaking him awake. ‚ÄúStill out? Come on, we‚Äôve got to get going.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a chance,‚Äù he groaned. He patted the bedside table, then remembered he had left his phone in the kitchen. ‚ÄúCan you get my phone? I‚Äôm calling out of work.‚Äù

‚ÄúWork?‚Äù Melissa sounded confused. ‚ÄúHoney, it‚Äôs the evening.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Christopher sat up and looked around. The sun was on the wrong side of the sky. What he had thought was dawn was dusk. ‚ÄúI slept all day?‚Äù

‚ÄúI would have let you sleep longer if it wouldn‚Äôt ruin our anniversary plans.‚Äù Melissa‚Äôs tone was both chastising and amused.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Äîwhat?‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt their anniversary. That wasn‚Äôt for months. Christopher was sure of it.

‚ÄúOur anniversary. We‚Äôre going out tonight. You need to get ready.‚Äù The amusement was rapidly dropping from Melissa‚Äôs tone.

Christopher hauled himself out of bed, still as dazed as if he had not slept. He was certain Melissa was wrong about this. Then again, he had been certain that he had only just gotten into bed. And for that matter, that it should still be the weekend and he should still be at his son‚Äôs house. Not to mention everything with his phone: the background, the phone call, the messages from a dead friend.

He had no real reason to believe that Melissa was wrong. He had every reason to doubt himself.

He shaved and dressed as the sun set. His face looked haggard in the mirror. The bathroom lights were blinding.

‚ÄúCome on, we don‚Äôt want to be late,‚Äù said Melissa. She was standing by the door, looking stunning. Christopher thought again how lucky he had been.

Was it their anniversary? He did not want to ask. He was afraid to reveal how lost he was.

He opened the door to let her into the car. He did not know where they were going. Instead he said, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the address?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got it in the GPS,‚Äù said Melissa, waving her phone at him. Christopher was relieved not to have to use his own. It might have taken him anywhere.

‚ÄúAll right, navigator,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou tell me when to turn.‚Äù

They chatted as they drove, about everything and nothing. Melissa intermittently told Christopher to make a left or a right, and he dutifully did so. Time slipped by without him particularly noticing. The sky darkened to full night, and still Christopher drove. He did not think to wonder about the time. Melissa was still giving directions. They were going where they needed to be. It was fine.

‚ÄúTurn into this parking lot,‚Äù said Melissa.

Christopher‚Äôs headlights spilled over a gravel lot at the edge of the woods. It was devoid of other cars. There were no buildings nearby.

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, park here. See that path?‚Äù Melissa pointed to an overgrown dirt trail leading into the woods. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs right through there.‚Äù

As Christopher opened his car door, a train whistle sounded in the distance. He stared at the woods. The path was familiar.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù said Melissa. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost time.‚Äù

They started down the path. Christopher turned on the flashlight of his phone to illuminate the uneven ground ahead of them.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need that,‚Äù said Melissa. ‚ÄúLook how bright the moon is.‚Äù

She was right. Even through the foliage, the moon was a blinding crescent lighting the path before them. The air was fresh and warm, with a gentle breeze stirring the leaves. It carried the distant smell of diesel.

‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù Christopher asked at last.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be silly,‚Äù said Melissa. He felt her hand on the small of his back, urging him along. ‚ÄúYou know where we‚Äôre going.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know these woods.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen you know where we‚Äôre going.‚Äù

Christopher‚Äôs watch beeped. He looked at the illuminated dial. He was shocked to see that it was midnight, but more so to see the day: Friday.

‚ÄúHappy anniversary,‚Äù said Melissa, though it was not her behind him. The voice was that of a man‚Äîor really, a boy. A teenager. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre almost there.‚Äù

The forest opened up ahead of them. The tracks were there, leading off to the left and the right. Christopher hesitated at the base of the embankment.

‚ÄúYou know where you‚Äôre going,‚Äù said Jason once more. ‚ÄúYou know where you have to go.‚Äù

Christopher followed the tracks off to the east, toward the bridge he knew was there.

The train whistle sounded again, closer this time. Christopher did not hear any footsteps behind him. He did not turn to look. It did not matter.

12:12 showed on his watch as Christopher stepped onto the narrow bridge leading over the ravine. There would be no room to avoid a train if one came at him. There never had been.

Christopher was in the middle of the bridge when the forest on the far side was suddenly lit by a brilliant light. The train came barreling around the corner onto the bridge, moving far too fast for any person to outrun. The light washed over Christopher. It cast a stark shadow on the empty track behind him.

The light filled Christopher‚Äôs entire world. The desperate shriek of the whistle drowned out reality. He added his own cry to it, one final act lost in the noise.

The light, the scream, and the scream. The way it always had to end.

I've watched a lot of reviews of the 54 and 64 gen 2, and I recently decided that if I'm going to get a grinder, it will be the DF54 mostly because of the price. Now I'm browsing through this sub and noticing a lot of people commenting about alignment issues, quality control and so on, and I'm a bit worried about purchasing it.

\- So a question to the people who have owned one for a while now; is it worth it?  
\- And to the ones that have had issues with it; How difficult is it to work around these issues? is it just a matter of keeping the grinder clean? Or would I need to tear down the whole thing every week?

Get the family out of here ‚Äì NOW!‚Äù,"In the days after the ‚Äúnot guilty‚Äù verdict, I could barely sleep. Barely eat. All I felt was a blind, all-consuming rage.

The system had failed us. *Failed her.*

The injustice of it was destroying me.

*Our daughter was dead*, and her murderer ‚Äì nicknamed the *‚ÄúGold-Toothed Killer‚Äù* by the media ‚Äì was free.

‚ÄúWe need to do something,‚Äù my brother whispered darkly, cracking his knuckles. Deep in a melancholic reverie, I hadn‚Äôt even realised he was there, but I knew he‚Äôd loved her deeply.

*‚ÄúI have his address.‚Äù*

Unable to respond, I simply nodded.

*Whatever it takes,* I thought. *But we have to be smart.*

First, we trailed him. We sat outside his apartment in the city, the rank smells of stale coffee and body odour filling the car as we watched him come and go for days on end. We learned his routines. His habits.

Then, we began following him on foot. *Poorly*. I wanted him to develop an inkling that we were onto him. That he wasn‚Äôt safe.

I wanted him to feel‚Ä¶ to feel how my daughter must‚Äôve felt.

We set up some blinky, noisy cameras in obvious places. Triggered them as he went by. One night, we watched as he launched a brick at the camera in the alley ‚Äì but we‚Äôd made our point.

Then, when he went away for a few days, we broke into his flat. We left barely a trace, but just‚Ä¶*disturbed stuff.* Scattered some papers. Knocked over a cereal packet. Pulled the drawer beside his bed open and cracked the watch face in there, which felt poetic. Left the door unlocked as we left.

Then, a couple of days after he returned, I confronted him in the alley beside his apartment block. It was pitch dark, but for the thin streak of light coming from the streetlamp at one end.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen the cameras, you stupid fuck!‚Äù the killer‚Äôs silhouette snarled. ‚ÄúI know it was you who broke into my flat. This is entrapment ‚Äì it‚Äôll never stand up in court!‚Äù

He seemed hesitant to get close to me.

Then, all of a sudden, he pulled a knife. His hands were shaking.

I smiled, grappling him towards me.

‚ÄúOh, it will,‚Äù I grimaced, yanking the killer‚Äôs knife-holding wrist towards my chest and stabbing myself repeatedly.

‚Äú*What the* ‚Äì *what the fuck are you doing!*‚Äù

Coughing up blood, I laughed weakly, gesturing at the broken camera dangling above me. ‚Äú*I never‚Ä¶ recorded‚Ä¶ a thing, dickhead.*‚Äù

The distant wail of sirens pierced the quiet of night.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good to hear,‚Äù my brother said, appearing from nowhere and placing a gun to the killer‚Äôs temple.

While I can‚Äôt relate to her upbringing, I can definitely relate to her mustering up the courage to take a different path in life than what was meant for her.

She started working pretty ‚Äúlate in life‚Äù. I think she was around 25 when she got her first job at the coffee house? I was the same age when I got my first job too (for different reasons than her).

She found her passion and followed it! Wasn‚Äôt afraid to put up boundaries when Ross got in the way of her personal growth.

She was this scared ‚Äúprincess‚Äù that went out on her own and figured it out.

I just love how serious and passionate she is especially at the beginning of her fashion career, when she first got a job at Bloomingdale‚Äôs.

The whole show was set on the premise of Rachel freaking out on her wedding day and deciding to set out on her own and find herself.

I just love that. Combined with the light hearted and cozy feel of the show in the earlier seasons, ugh it‚Äôs just magical!

I used to skip the earlier seasons when I was younger because the 90s felt too outdated to me. But now seasons 1 through 3 have become my absolute favorites!

It‚Äôs that nostalgia for the early parts of adulthood where you‚Äôre still figuring it out and it‚Äôs okay if you make mistakes.

1gh4f2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1gh4f2i/5day_paris_trip_report/,5-Day Paris Trip Report,"I wanted to pay things forward since I checked this subreddit a lot while planning for my trip. We (3 adults, 2 senior citizens) were in Paris for five days in mid-October before heading to Spain, and the trip was lovely. We‚Äôre already planning a return visit.¬†

**Food/Restaurants:**

* I honestly enjoyed everything that I ate during the trip. I had worries about things being bland, but I didn‚Äôt find that to be an issue at all. Boulangeries were great - croissants as lovely as advertised (lesson: avoid crescent-shaped croissants as they‚Äôre made of margarine, not butter ~~likely industrial-made~~), and it was a game changer to find out that you can buy half a baguette. The dessert that hooked me the most were macarons - bought mine from Pierre Herm√© & Jean-Paul H√©vin, and the flavors were much better than anything I‚Äôd tried before.¬†
* Highlight restaurants we visited were Le Colima√ßon in Marais and Granite (fine dining, course meal, 1 star Michelin). We made reservations for both and they were great. Highly recommend making reservations in restaurants that offer them as a lot of places are small, so lines get long quickly, and they do turn away people without reservations numerous times.
* If you‚Äôre near the area and have the time, I suggest making a stop at the Bastille market. We went there on a Sunday morning, and it was nice to have a casual look around and try many different things.¬†
* In general, dining out is more expensive in Paris. We went to Spain after and our restaurant bills in Paris, for the same amount of food ordered, were usually double the price of our meals in Spain! If you want to save, you can buy a lot of good wine and food from the supermarkets. For example, a glass of wine in Paris was around 8-10 euro a glass. In Spain, it was around 4-6 euros. Oat milk lattes in Paris would be around 7-8 euros. In Spain, it would be around 4-5.

**Attractions:**

* We bought our tickets in advance for the Louvre and for the Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay. For the Louvre, I recommend entering through the Porte des Lions entrance for a short line. Entering through here requires you to already have a ticket though, and check the website to make sure it's open on the day of your visit. A week before our trip, it was going to be closed since they had scheduled reservations. But when we checked the day before, apparently reservations had been postponed, so we were able to enter on the day of our actual visit. We arrived at around 8:45AM, and we were the second ones inside for our 9AM entry. From there, it‚Äôs a rush to the Mona Lisa as everyone aims to get there first, and the area fills up very fast. Take a look there first then appreciate the rest of what the museum has to offer.¬†
* Things are more casual at Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay, but it still does fill up at mid-day. It‚Äôs a bit confusing to get around though since the layout isn‚Äôt very consistent and some floors aren‚Äôt exactly level, but we started at the highest floor and made our way down from there. The impressionist works were beautiful and the larger paintings on the lowest floor were breathtaking.
* Seeing the Eiffel Tower up close gave me a greater appreciation for the monument. I‚Äôd also recommend trying to get an evening view of it, just to see it sparkle. Probably no need to get all the way up close for an evening view, but seeing it sparkle from Jardin des Tuileries in the evening was more impactful than I expected.¬†

**Grocery Shopping:**¬†

* Le Grande Epicerie in Le Bon Marche is its own separate building, and it's somewhat chaotic since there‚Äôs a lot of people. In terms of selection, I found the benefit of Le Grande Epicerie is that items that tourists would be interested in are all located in one area, but a lot of the things I saw there could also be found in different Franprix or Monoprix in the city. Yes, there‚Äôs a large section dedicated just for fancier butter, and the Le Beurre Bordier butter we bought there was pricey but worth it (we managed to bring it all the way through Spain and back home), but you can get the same brand at Galeries Lafayette Le Gourmet with a lot less trouble and a lot less people.¬†
* From our experience with Monoprix and Franprix in our area of northern Marais, I'd recommend Franprix more. Selections are more complete, staff is friendlier. The two Monoprix branches we went to all had low stocks, empty shelves, and so many people!
* Tip on buying butter - vacuum sealing happens after you‚Äôve paid for your items. This applies for both Le Grande Epiceries & Galeries Lafayette Le Gourmet. You need to tell the cashier that you‚Äôll have it vacuum sealed (they charge around 1 euro extra for this service), they‚Äôll put your butter in plastic, and then you‚Äôll bring it to the vacuum sealing counter afterwards.¬†

**Luxury/Department Store Shopping:**

* Between Le Bon Marche, Galeries Lafayette, and Samaritaine department stores: Lafayette has the most options and it‚Äôs also the most crowded. Personally found it overwhelming with how many people were there. Samaritaine had the fewest people, the fewest selection and mostly high-end brands. Le Bon Marche was an in-between of the two. I found it more enjoyable to just visit individual stores along Rue St. Honore instead.¬†¬†

**Tours/Experiences:**

* Marais Food Tour with Secret Food tours - while it doesn‚Äôt have a sit-down meal, you are taken to many different high quality places; a chocolatier, charcuterie and cold cuts, cheese store, boulangerie, and a wine shop is the last stop where you eat a lot of the things you bought in the previous stores! Our guide was really knowledgeable, and she gave us a lot of tips for shopping around Paris.
* Palais Garnier After Hours Tour with Manatour - I highly recommend this experience. It was a fantastic opportunity to see and appreciate everything free of any distractions. You can take dozens of great pictures without the crowds, and we were lucky enough to enter the actual auditorium as well. Incredibly memorable.¬†
* For casual experiences, bringing some coffee and pastries to a garden and chilling for a while was a nice and relaxing thing to do. Jardin du Luxembourg was beautiful on a nice Sunday morning, and I also spent a few hours just enjoying some sun at Jardin des Tuileries.¬†

**People:** Yes, this subreddit has dismissed a lot of the stereotypes of rude French people, but we managed our expectations all the same, and I'm happy to add onto the reports disapproving the stereotypes. Everyone we encountered was very pleasant. The consistent tip of starting off with ‚ÄúBonjour!‚Äù helps a lot. There were even some people who went out of their way to help when we were figuring out how to price tag our fresh fruit at Monoprix.

**Other:** Paris is a big and old capital city, so of course it‚Äôs not going to be the cleanest, but watch out for dog poop on the sidewalks! We went to different cities in Spain after Paris, and there was a marked difference in sidewalks.

That‚Äôs it! Happy to take any questions if there are any. :)¬†",6,1730464865.0,ParisTravelGuide,3,1.0,False
1gh4exk,https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/1gh4exk/why_high_inflation_is_painful_but_necessary_the/,Why High Inflation is Painful but Necessary: The Right Choice to Protect Our Future,"We‚Äôre all feeling the pinch of high prices right now. It‚Äôs understandable to be frustrated when filling up the gas tank or paying the grocery bill costs more than it used to. But if we look back to 2020, we can see why the decisions made then ‚Äì even with today‚Äôs inflation ‚Äì were necessary to protect something even more important: our jobs, our communities, and our future.

1. A Crisis That Called for Extraordinary Action

When COVID-19 hit, everything changed overnight. Millions of Americans were suddenly out of work, wondering how they‚Äôd pay rent or put food on the table. Local businesses ‚Äì the coffee shop where you get your morning cup, the restaurant that‚Äôs been in your neighborhood for years ‚Äì were on the brink of closure. It wasn‚Äôt just numbers in a report; it was our lives, our communities, and our families being turned upside down. This wasn‚Äôt a typical downturn where we could afford to wait and see. In 2020, the Federal Reserve and the government had to make a choice, and they chose to protect people‚Äôs livelihoods, even if it meant making tough trade-offs down the road.

2. Broad Support for Everyday Americans

There‚Äôs a reason the stimulus wasn‚Äôt just narrowly targeted. The pandemic affected all of us, not just those who lost jobs or closed businesses. Parents trying to balance work and home-schooling, healthcare workers risking their lives daily, essential workers keeping shelves stocked ‚Äì everyone felt the weight. That broad support didn‚Äôt just help those who lost jobs; it helped keep entire communities going. People were able to keep the lights on, put food on the table, and hold on to some sense of stability. The stimulus wasn‚Äôt just about economics; it was about helping real people through a time of deep uncertainty and fear.

3. Avoiding a Future Where Families Would Have Been Left Behind

Imagine if the response had been smaller, if fewer families had received support. Thousands of businesses might have closed permanently, leaving communities without local shops, restaurants, and services they rely on. Families who were barely getting by might have lost their homes. Our neighbors, friends, and family members who lost their jobs might have struggled to find work for years, their skills atrophying as they waited for opportunities to return. We could have faced years, even a decade, of people unable to rebuild their lives ‚Äì all while younger generations watched their dreams shrink and their hopes fade.

Choosing inflation over a collapse was about choosing a future where families can recover, businesses can thrive, and children can grow up with opportunities. Inflation is hard, but a collapsed economy would have left scars on our society that no one would want for their community or loved ones.

4. A Manageable Cost for the Greater Good

Yes, inflation is tough ‚Äì but it‚Äôs something we can manage. While prices are high, we‚Äôre still in a position where businesses are open, people are employed, and children are in school. Families may be stretching their budgets, but they aren‚Äôt facing the complete economic devastation that would have happened without support. We are still able to work toward a solution, because the economy, while strained, is standing. And that resilience, that ability to adapt, is something we would not have had if the economy had been allowed to spiral downward.

Inflation can be managed; jobs lost forever and businesses shuttered for good are much harder to fix. Choosing inflation was choosing the path that protected the most lives and futures. It was the choice that allowed us to keep pushing forward together.

5. Learning from History ‚Äì Acting to Protect Our Communities

We learned from past crises that delayed or moderate actions come at a high cost ‚Äì a lesson taught by the slow recovery after the 2008 crisis, where families waited years for job opportunities to return. This time, policymakers acted boldly. It wasn‚Äôt an easy choice, but it was a choice made with our communities, our small businesses, and our children‚Äôs future in mind. By acting decisively, the Federal Reserve and the government kept our communities going, ensured that when we recovered, we would all have a chance to rebuild.

6. A Brighter Future That‚Äôs Still Within Reach

Today‚Äôs inflation is real, and it‚Äôs a challenge. But because we avoided a total collapse, we‚Äôre in a position to address it. We still have jobs to go to, businesses to support, and schools where our kids can dream of bright futures. The sacrifices of the past were made to protect the future ‚Äì a future where we can recover from inflation rather than struggle to rebuild lives shattered by an economic collapse.

The choice was not perfect, but it was a choice made to protect our communities, families, and futures. Inflation is a burden, but it‚Äôs a burden we‚Äôre sharing together as we work to come out of this stronger. The cost of action was high, but the cost of inaction would have been even higher ‚Äì and that‚Äôs a price none of us would want to pay.",0,1730464853.0,FluentInFinance,21,0.22,False

""How do I call the ASOP terminal again? Is it F1? No, that's not it..."" he muttered, accidentally activating his medical gown instead of his flight suit.

""Need help there, Chris?"" Tony Z's voice crackled through the comms, his character model quantum traveling through multiple server shards simultaneously as he explained the intricacies of server meshing to bewildered passersby.

Suddenly, a fleet of moderator ships appeared through Hurston's atmosphere, their vessels adorned with the distinctive Spectrum badge and wielding the mighty ban hammer. Leading them was Nightrider-CIG, whose Drake Corsair was plastered with ""MOVED TO FEEDBACK"" stickers.

""Chris, you can't just stand there without proper elevator panel interaction etiquette,"" called out DiscoLando from his Consolidated Outland Pioneer (which somehow made it into the game early). ""That's a warning for breaking immersion.""

As Chris finally managed to spawn his Constellation Phoenix, he caught sight of her - a beautiful Spectrum moderator in a 400i, closing concern threads about the Legatus pack with graceful precision. Their eyes met across the ASOP terminals, and for a moment, he forgot about the Persistent Entity Streaming.

""I... I..."" Chris stammered over global chat, accidentally hitting the new surrender emote instead of his love confession. His character raised his arms in defeat while Jared ""Disco"" Huckaby captured everything in 8K for the next Calling All Devs.

Tony Z appeared again, this time quantum traveling between coffee cups: ""According to my dynamic economy simulation, there's a 42% chance of romantic success, factoring in the current price of Widow at Jumptown.""

The moderator approached in her 400i, but Chris accidentally pressed the new inventory system and dropped all his medical pens instead of offering her a drink. As his items scattered across the floor, he called out, ""I promise the inventory drag-and-drop will be smoother in beta!""

The moderator couldn't help but laugh, sending him a private message: ""Thread merged for duplicate item dropping. See you at IAE ‚ù§Ô∏è""

Meanwhile, Jared was already preparing the monthly report: ""LITERALLY the most romantic dev-mod interaction EVER! And it's not even a Thursday!""

The story ended with Chris trying to figure out how to use the new StarMap 2.0, while Tony Z calculated the probability of getting the cargo refactor working for their honeymoon.",1,1730464698.0,starcitizen_refunds,0,0.6,False

I have a 6-month-old lab who is very food motivated and, unfortunately, defaults to destruction when overtired. His favorite thing to try to destroy is his bed (which is actually convenient since it saves the rest of the furniture that he would otherwise go for like the coffee table or couch). He settles quickly in the crate and all of his naps have been enforced crate naps for quite a while now.  
I really want to try to train him to nap OUTSIDE the crate, since this would be a very useful skill when we go to friends' places and bars, etc. When he was younger he would eventually pass out when exhausted. Unfortunately, it seems impossible to get him to be exhausted anymore. The last few times he was out were pretty awful, trying to eat all furniture and biting the shit out of me.

  
I've been doing nothing but training Karen Overall's relaxation protocol, relax on a mat, and rewarding calm behavior on the bed for the last 2 weeks. He'll do all of this great before he's overtired and while the treats keep coming and then turn into a destructive mess that doesn't listen to commands. 

I don't have a playpen anymore because he hated it and would get up to the max destruction/trouble in the pen (which was actually worse than the trouble he gets up to without a pen). I can't ignore him because he'll eat and destroy the whole flat.

He's succeeded in falling asleep outside the crate exactly ONCE recently, after being awake for like 4-5 hours AND puppy class.  
I'm currently on hour 2.5 of trying to get him to nap through sheer perseverance and one bajillion redirections/corrections. He got a long walk in there, played with a bunch of other dogs, did some training, everything. He definitely gets adequate exercise and mental stimulation; too much if anything as he's often overtired/overstimulated.

If you‚Äôre trying to lose weight, **fiber** can be a game-changer. Fiber helps you feel fuller for longer, reducing the temptation to snack or overeat. Plus, it supports digestion, ensuring your body efficiently processes food and eliminates waste.

For many people, hitting the daily recommended fiber intake through food alone can be tough‚Äîthat's where **fiber supplements** come in. Supplements, like **psyllium husk** and **inulin**, provide an easy way to get the fiber your body needs without dramatically changing your diet.

## How Fiber Supports Weight Loss

Wondering how **fiber** aids in weight loss? It‚Äôs simple:

- **Fiber helps with appetite control**, digestion, and maintaining healthy blood sugar levels.
- When you consume fiber, it absorbs water and swells in your stomach, keeping you feeling full for longer. This means you're less likely to grab snacks between meals, naturally reducing your calorie intake without feeling deprived.
- It also supports digestion by promoting regular bowel movements, which prevents bloating and helps your body eliminate waste efficiently.
- Additionally, some fibers, like **psyllium husk** and **inulin**, act as prebiotics, feeding the good bacteria in your gut, which can positively impact your metabolism.
- Certain types of fiber can also **stabilize blood sugar levels**, which helps to avoid insulin spikes that lead to fat storage.
- If you're incorporating exercise into your routine, having stable energy from fiber can help you perform better during workouts, further enhancing calorie burn.

Fiber supplements are a great addition to a weight loss plan because they help you feel full longer, control cravings, and support digestion. Products like [**HourGlass Fit**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/hourglassfit.php) and [**PhenQ**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/phenq2.php) stand out for their effective fiber content, with HourGlass Fit providing glucomannan for appetite suppression and PhenQ using nopal cactus fiber to curb hunger and aid fat burning.

However, while [**ColonBroom Premium**](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1fdes2g/my_colon_broom_premium_review_colonbroom_premium/) is a popular fiber supplement, we at HealthTrendz don‚Äôt think it deserves a place on the list due to the availability of better options.

What is it?
Chromatica is like that friend who always remembers everyone's coffee order, but for colors. It's a color management system for After Effects that's smarter than your average palette and more reliable than your project manager's deadlines.

Why You Need It
- Because Math is Hard: Stop converting hex codes in your head. We're motion designers, not calculators with opposable thumbs.
- Because Time is Money: And you've spent way too much of both trying to match that ""sort of blue-ish but also kind of teal"" color across 12 different compositions.
- Because Consistency is Key: Your client will definitely notice that their brand blue is actually 17 slightly different blues. Trust us, they always do.

Features That Actually Matter
- Global Color Management: Like a color dictatorship, but the good kind.
- Preset Palettes: For when your creative juices are more like creative drought.
- Smart Color Linking: Because copy-pasting colors is so 2005.
- Random Palette Generator: For when the client says ""surprise me"" and you're all out of surprises.

The Good Stuff
- Click to Apply: Left click for linked colors, Shift+click for commitment issues.
- Alt+Click Color Picker: For when you need that perfect shade of ""not quite right"" to ""just right.""
- Palette Lock: Like putting your colors in witness protection.
- Multi-Composition Support: Because your colors should follow you everywhere, like a well-trained puppy.",14,1730464076.0,AfterEffects,2,0.95,False

1gh42oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gh42oo/being_reprimanded_professionally_for_personal/,Being reprimanded professionally for personal actions,"A couple of years ago, I (m late-20s) started dating Mary (f mid-30s). We knew each other from work and we were both going through divorces at the time. The relationship lasted only 6 months but it was intense. Things ended for a variety of reasons, not least that I moved to the international department of the company and I now live in a different country. 

Despite our separation and before my move, we stayed in touch. We‚Äôd see each other every month or so in a more friend/casual manner. She even left some of her expensive coffee at my apartment. 

The last thing I had from her, just before I left the country, was a letter saying if I ever wanted to speak to her or see her again, I should let her know. It was sad to know what could‚Äôve been had truly ended. 

When I moved out my apartment I saw her expensive coffee in my kitchen and made a conscious effort to keep it, knowing if I was ever back in the country I would return it to her. She was always on about how you could only get from one place in the world and how good it was. 

I happened to return home for a work related trip, in which I was visiting the campus she worked on. She lives just round the corner so I decided to drop the coffee off outside her apartment with a note saying I was around, I didn‚Äôt want to turn up unannounced, and that if she wanted to see me she could get hold of me. 

A day passed with nothing heard. Whilst on the work trip I am hunted down by her manager (I didn‚Äôt know it was her manager at the time). He invites me into an office in which I think we‚Äôre going to have a discussion about business I.e. the whole reason I‚Äôm in the country. Instead he tells me that I am banned from speaking to Mary, I cannot go to certain areas of the campus (where she works), and that he‚Äôs informed my manager of what I‚Äôve done. 

I‚Äôm a little shellshocked at this point and don‚Äôt really know what to say. It‚Äôs clear this was a professional telling off for a personal decision. I wanted to return something to an ex partner in a manner that was non-confrontational and put the power in her hands as to if she wanted to see me. I thought turning up unannounced after not speaking for 7-8 months would‚Äôve been unfair. Now I‚Äôve been required to have conversations with my management about my personal life and the whole background to this scenario; something I‚Äôd rather have kept private. 

I‚Äôm really ticked off with Mary‚Äôs manager, but at the same time it has me wonder: was I in the wrong? Should I have not bothered to return the coffee? AITAH?",6,1730463753.0,AITAH,15,1.0,False

1gh3uyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1gh3uyc/things_were_getting_more_and_more_interesting/,Things were getting more and more interesting with that man (part 4),"Ever since that encounter in the library, my mind was trapped by thoughts of him, like he‚Äôd left some invisible mark I couldn‚Äôt‚Äîdidn‚Äôt want to‚Äîerase. Everything about him called to me: his voice, his words, that constant feeling of danger surrounding him. I tried to go on with my life, focus on my studies, see my friends, but nothing distracted me. It was as if everything else had become irrelevant.

One afternoon, while wandering aimlessly through the streets, my phone vibrated with a message from an unknown number. Curiosity got the better of me, and I opened it immediately.

‚ÄúI hope you enjoy mysteries as much as last time. I‚Äôll be waiting for you at our usual caf√©.‚Äù

My heart skipped a beat. I didn‚Äôt know how he‚Äôd gotten my number, but somehow that only made it more intriguing. I tried not to seem too eager, but as soon as I was ready, I found myself walking to the caf√©, barely thinking about what I was doing. When I arrived, he was already there, sitting in a corner with a cup of coffee in front of him, as if he‚Äôd been there for a while.

I walked over, trying to keep calm despite the thrill I felt crawling up my skin. He greeted me with the faintest of smiles, that same smile that seemed to hide something he‚Äôd never say out loud.

‚ÄúYou like your coffee with a touch of sugar, right?‚Äù he asked, sliding a cup over to me like he already knew every detail.

I didn‚Äôt remember telling him that before, but somehow, it didn‚Äôt surprise me. It felt like he‚Äôd always known things about me, little details I wasn‚Äôt even fully aware of myself. I took a sip and looked at him, waiting for him to break the silence.

For the first few minutes, we stuck to small talk, as if both of us were trying to ignore the growing tension between us. But it didn‚Äôt take long before the conversation took a different turn. Almost without meaning to, he began talking about that book from last time, explaining how those ancient authors had ideas about love and attraction that went far beyond the conventional. He said that, for them, a real connection between two people had to be intense, dangerous, something that left you on the edge. His gaze didn‚Äôt leave mine as he spoke, and I felt like his words were meant for me, like he was describing exactly what I‚Äôd started to feel.

Every word he spoke pulled me in further. I felt trapped in his voice, the way he seemed to analyze me, studying my reactions. There was a moment when his hand brushed mine again, but this time, he didn‚Äôt pull away. Instead, his fingers slowly traced over mine, following a gentle path that made my skin tingle. I knew it was intentional, and I knew he enjoyed seeing how it affected me. And, somehow, I enjoyed it too.

It felt like the atmosphere in the caf√© had grown heavier, as if all the background noise was starting to fade. Everything focused on him, his voice, the warmth of his hand. He talked about how most people settle for shallow connections, while he was looking for something deeper, something more dangerous. He didn‚Äôt say he was looking for it with me, but I felt like that was the true implication.

After a few minutes of this game of words and glances, he leaned toward me, with an intensity in his eyes that left me breathless. There were only a few inches between us, and the heat from his closeness made every nerve in my body tense.

‚ÄúYou know this isn‚Äôt ordinary, right?‚Äù he whispered, his voice low and soft, like it was a secret just for me.

I nodded, unable to respond with words. I felt that if I tried to speak, anything I said wouldn‚Äôt make sense. I was caught in that closeness, in the slow rhythm of his breathing that seemed to sync with mine.

For a moment, there was absolute silence, where both of us seemed to be holding our breath. And then, before I could even react, I felt his fingers brush my face, just barely touching me. The softness of his touch made my whole body respond, like I was completely out of control. It was a silent invitation, a challenge, and I realized, somehow, he already knew I would accept.",12,1730463045.0,confessions,0,0.81,False
