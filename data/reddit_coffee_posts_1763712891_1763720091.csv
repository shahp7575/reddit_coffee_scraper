My Daughter's Wish
😍What happens next👉Click Here to read on👉

Chapter 1
On our daughter's birthday, my husband brought home the daughter of the love he could never forget.
That little girl wrapped her arms around his neck, pointing at me and asking, ""Daddy, who is she?""
He coaxed her gently, ""Baby, she's the nanny I hired for you.""
I stifled the pain in my chest, forcing a relaxed smile as I bowed respectfully. ""Mr. Bradley, could you settle my salary for the past seven years...""
He laughed in anger, ""So money is all you care about?""
Yes, I needed money. I was dying, and I had to plan everything for my daughter in advance.
***
Our daughter Sienna Bradley's fifth birthday marked the seventh anniversary of my marriage to Timothy Bradley.
Before he left for work that morning, I begged him humbly, hoping he'd come home early to celebrate Sienna's birthday.
As for our wedding anniversary, I didn't care if we celebrated it or not.
I'd never had a real one anyway.
He grunted in response, and I took that as a promise.
But by nine o'clock that night, he still hadn't come home.
I texted him, asking when he'd be back, but got no reply.
I called, and he hung up immediately.
Staring at my phone screen, I had mixed feelings.
I knew Timothy hated me. For seven years, he'd been cold and distant, and I'd never complained.
I deserved it for falling in love with someone I shouldn't have and being a woman's substitute willingly.
But our daughter was innocent. She didn't deserve this.
Sienna stared at the birthday cake on the table, her stomach growling with hunger.
Feeling sorry for her, I coaxed her, ""Sia, Daddy's working overtime. Let's eat without him, okay?""
As soon as I said that, I heard the door unlock.
""Daddy's back!"" Sienna's face lit up instantly, and she skipped toward the door to receive Timothy.
I stood up from the sofa, ready to head to the kitchen to reheat the food. However, looking up, I saw Timothy walk in, holding a strange little girl in his arms.
The girl wore a pink princess dress with delicate features like a doll. She was lovely, indeed.
As I sized her up, she was doing the exact same to me.
A moment later, she wrapped her arms around Timothy's neck, pointed at me, and asked, ""Daddy, who is she?""
My eyes flew wide. I stared at Timothy in disbelief.
Was this girl his daughter?
Who was her mother?
When was this girl born?
A flood of questions rushed into my mind, my head throbbing as if it would burst.
""Baby, she's the nanny I hired for you.""
Timothy's gentle voice hit my ears. I felt as if struck by lightning, frozen, unable to react.
What irony!
Having married Timothy for seven years, I'd borne his child, raised her, and cared for his elders. In the end, I was reduced to a ""nanny"" in his words.
My burning heart plummeted, turning cold in an instant.
""Mommy...""
Sienna ran over, hugging my thigh, her pretty face etched with grievance.
I stroked her hair, my heart aching for her.
When I first found out I was pregnant, Timothy had insisted I get an abortion.
I'd been stubborn, defying him, determined to give birth to Sienna.
That was why Sienna, like me, was never favored by Timothy.
In all five years since Sienna was born, Timothy has never held her, never kissed her, and barely spoken a word to her.
For a long time, I'd naively thought that Timothy just didn't like children.
Only now did I understand that he didn't dislike children. He disliked the child I'd borne him.
I let out a bitter laugh, bowing respectfully. ""Mr. Bradley, could you settle my salary for the past seven years...""
Timothy frowned, looking displeased. ""Didn't I just give you money?""
""Mr. Bradley, you mentioned living expenses and child support, and as a husband and father, you're obligated to provide for your wife and daughter.
""Now I'm asking for wages for working as your family's nanny for these seven years.""
Timothy was generous in his own way. He pulled out his phone at once, transferring 15,000 dollars to me.
""Is this enough?""
I laughed at myself, saying nothing.
I'd devoted seven years, and all I got was 15,000 dollars.
Of course, it wasn't enough.
The little girl in his arms frowned, her tone cold and sharp.
""Daddy, I don't like this nanny. Fire her!""
I stared at her familiar features, retorting, ""Funny, I don't like you either. Once your dad pays me what he owes, I'll leave on my own.""
""Leticia!"" Timothy snapped, instantly furious. ""Hallie is just a child. Do you really need to argue with her?""
""Yes, I do!"" I bit my lip, forcing back my tears.
""Timothy, I love you, but that doesn't mean I'll let myself be walked all over, and watch your illegitimate daughter flaunt herself in front of me.""
My words seemed to sting Hallie. She burst into tears, kicking and screaming in Timothy's arms.
""Daddy, I'm not an illegitimate child! I don't like her. Tell her to get out! I don't want to see her!""
I ignored Timothy's dark face, pressing on, ""I'm sorry, but this is my home. If anyone is leaving, it's you.""
Chapter 2
Timothy shot me a cold glance, carried Hallie, and retreated to his bedroom.
I lifted Sienna up to the coffee table, ready to finally celebrate her birthday.
Sienna suddenly looked up at me, asking, ""Mommy, does Daddy not like me?""
I didn't want to plant hatred in her heart, so I lied, ""Sia, you're such a good girl. How could Daddy not like you?""
""Then why won't he hug me?"" Sienna hung her head, tears welling up.
I kissed her cheek, at a loss for words to comfort her.
Silly child. In fact, your father once wanted to abort you. How could he hug you?
Tears spilled from my eyes again, dropping one by one on the back of Sienna's hand.
She held out her chubby little fingers, clumsily wiping my cheeks.
""Mommy, don't cry. I don't want Daddy anymore. It's my fault. I made you sad again.""
Timothy walked out of the bedroom, ignoring our tears, his brows furrowed with irritation.
""Leticia, we need to talk.""
I swallowed my sobs. ""Talk about what? Your illegitimate daughter? Or about getting a divorce?""
""Don't be ridiculous. Hallie isn't my child. She's Angie, and her ex-husband's daughter. Angie's having appendicitis surgery. She asked me to help take care of Hallie for a few days.""
His explanation did little to ease my feelings.
Angie. It sounded so dear.
No wonder Timothy, who'd always been cold and distant, was so gentle to a stranger's child.
It turned out that the little girl was his unforgettable former lover's daughter.
Seeing I didn't respond, Timothy went on, ""Hallie's father left her when she was born. She's never felt safe, so she has some psychological issues.
""Angie is worried she'll become autistic, so she begged me to pretend to be her dad. For heaven's sake, don't pick on Hallie all the time...""
I cut him off abruptly, ""Timothy, do you know what today is?""
""Sienna's birthday."" Timothy glanced at the cake on the coffee table, his tone flat.
I laughed in anger, ""Then do you know who Sienna is?""
Timothy nodded. ""I know.""
Sienna sat on my lap, her mouth pursed, holding back tears as if afraid to cry.
My heart ached fiercely, and I raised my voice at him. ""If you know, did you buy her a birthday gift? Have you even looked at her since you walked in?
""Hallie is all you ever talk about. Did you ever think about how Sienna feels?""
In seven years of marriage, I'd never lost my temper with Timothy.
Whether he ignored me or his mother berated me, I'd always played dumb, never fighting back.
Tonight, I couldn't hold it in anymore. So I finally snapped.
Timothy seemed stunned by my outburst. He looked at Sienna and mumbled, ""Sorry. I was too busy today, so I forgot to get you a gift.""
""It's okay."" Sienna's voice choked, surprisingly sensible. ""I don't need a gift. I just don't want you to quarrel, please.""
I took a deep breath to calm down.
""Sienna, we're not quarreling. Now that your Daddy's back, let's celebrate your birthday together.""
Timothy didn't say no, so I took it as agreement.
Just as I was putting the birthday hat on Sienna, Hallie pushed open the bedroom door and walked out.
""Daddy, my stomach hurts.""
Timothy stood up at once, striding over to her.
""I'll take you to the hospital.""
Without another word, Timothy lifted Hallie into his arms and headed for the door.
Hallie leaned against his shoulder, shooting me a provocative look.
I understood the message in her eyes clearly and couldn't help curling my lips in a cold smile.
Like mother, like daughter, truly.
As Angela's child, she'd inherited Angela's scheming ways at such a young age.
A competitive streak flared in me then. I couldn't beat Angela, but couldn't I outmatch her daughter?
I called out, ""Timothy, stay for five minutes. At least celebrate Sienna's birthday first before you go.""
Timothy froze, turning to glare at me as if I were heartless.
""Leticia, don't you know what you're talking about? Didn't you hear Hallie say her stomach hurts?""
I clutched my throbbing chest, laughing bitterly at myself.
How absurd!
I couldn't even stand up to a child.
Knowing I couldn't keep him, I fell silent. Numbly, I lit the candles on the cake, going through the motions of celebrating Sienna's birthday in a daze.
Chapter 3
The next morning, it was time to send Sienna to kindergarten, but Timothy still hadn't come home.
I'd thought, after last night, he'd stay away for weeks like he used to.
But I was wrong again.
When I got back, Timothy was on the phone with his mother, asking how to make mushroom soup.
Because Hallie had said she wanted it.
I witnessed this man, who'd never lifted a finger in the kitchen, bustled around in a pink apron, and my heart ached sharply.
Luckily, Sienna wasn't here.
If she'd seen this, she'd probably cry again.
Spotting me, Hallie jumped off the sofa, ran to the kitchen, and hugged Timothy's thigh.
""Daddy, I'm scared. That bad woman is back!""
Timothy bent down, lifting Hallie with one hand while stirring the pot with the other.
""Don't be afraid, Hals. I have a superpower, and I'll protect you.""
Timothy's care and patience for someone else's daughter stung my eyes. My tears welled up fast.
I walked to the kitchen door, leaning against the frame, and said sarcastically, ""Timothy, when you die, who do you think will grieve for you? Who will bother to visit your grave?""
It sure wouldn't be my Sienna.
She'd never gotten an ounce of fatherly love. Why should she grieve for him?
Timothy set down the spoon, turning to glare at me. ""Leticia, you're so cruel.""
I sneered. ""I've always been cruel. Is that new to you?""
Timothy no longer responded. Bored, I went back to my bedroom.
At ten o'clock, I headed to the hospital to pick up my test results.
The doctor looked at me gravely. ""Ms. Wallace, I'm sorry, you have terminal breast cancer...""
I couldn't believe his words, forcing a pale smile. ""Doctor, is there a mistake? I just have breast pain.""
""No."" He shook his head firmly. ""Prolonged pent-up anger and stress likely caused this. I advise you to be admitted to the hospital immediately.""
I couldn't hear the rest of his words. My mind was filled with only one figure: Sienna.
If I were dying, who would look after Sienna?
Her father didn't love her, her paternal grandma disliked her, and her maternal grandparents...
Clutching the wall for support, I stumbled out of the doctor's office and collapsed into a chair in the corridor.
I didn't snap out of it until my phone rang.
Glancing at the screen, I saw it was Sienna's teacher.
I answered quickly, ""Hello, Ms. Patton.""
""Mrs. Bradley, please come to the kindergarten right away. Sienna has a fever.""
After hanging up, I raced out of the hospital, hailed a taxi, and rushed to the school.
Sienna was lying on a small cot, her face bright red with fever. When she saw me, she whispered weakly, ""Mommy, I feel quite well... Don't worry.""
""I'm taking you to the hospital."" I lifted her into my arms, and my chest throbbed with pain again.
Having realized she wasn't favored from a young age, Sienna had always been excessively sensible.
Like me, she never acted coquettishly or knew how to fight for what she wanted.
This kind of temperament was destined to get her hurt.
But I didn't know how to teach her to act coquettish, feign weakness, or pretend to be ill like Hallie.
When we got home from the hospital, Timothy was holding Hallie, reading her the story of ""Cinderella.""
I stood there with Sienna in my arms and a pile of medicine in my hand, but he ignored us completely, as if we were invisible.
I felt like my heart had been torn to shreds. The pain was so sharp I could barely breathe.
In that moment, I regretted marrying Timothy.
I even regretted giving birth to Sienna.
I'd brought her into this world, yet couldn't give her happiness. That was my failure as a mother.
But there was no going back.
All I could do was love Sienna with every last bit of my strength for the time I had left.
I laid Sienna on the bed, tucked her in, and headed to the kitchen to make her something to eat.
She loved my home-made chicken sandwich, but there was no fresh chicken at home.
I turned to Timothy on the sofa, saying, ""Sienna's sick. Could you watch her for a minute? I have to buy some ingredients. I'll be right back.""
Timothy sat there like a statue, not uttering a word.
I was used to it and left the house without another word.
When I got back from shopping, I froze. Hallie was holding my lipstick, drawing turtles all over Sienna's face.
Rage surged through me. I shouted, ""Hallie! What the hell are you doing?""
Hallie jumped, bursting into tears.
Timothy rushed out of the bedroom, scooping Hallie up. ""Baby, don't cry. What happened?""
I pointed at Sienna's smudged face, roaring, ""What happened? Look at what she did!""
""The kids were just playing for fun. Do you really need to get so angry?"" Timothy frowned, his eyes blazing with irritation.
""Playing for fun?"" I glared at him. Chest pain was squeezing the air from my lungs. ""How about I draw turtles on your face? Give me a chance to play for fun.""
""Are you insane?"" Timothy snapped, turning to walk away with Hallie.
I was frantic, refusing to let him go.
""Yes! I am insane! I'm dying, Timothy. Are you satisfied now? You can finally be with your former lover. Are you happy?""
Timothy ignored me, cooing gently to Hallie, ""Baby, stop crying. I'll take you to buy toys.""
Chapter 4
Timothy must be happy. After all, he loved Angela so deeply.
Even seven years ago, when Angela abandoned him, a poor boy, for money, he never stopped loving her.
He adored her down to his very soul.
As his wife who'd walked with him from poverty to prosperity, I was merely an object for him to satisfy his needs.
Whenever he needed me, he'd wave me over. If not, he'd ignore me.
Yet he'd been the one to get on his knees and beg me to marry him.
Why did he treat me so cruelly after I said yes?
Thinking back, I was foolish.
Maybe he'd begged me only for the money I had.
Once he got it, he no longer needed me and naturally lost all patience.
Sienna suddenly woke up, her voice weak as an injured kitten. She was clearly unwell.
I pulled myself together, walking to the bed to comfort her.
""How are you feeling? Still hurting?""
""Not anymore."" Sienna shook her head. ""Where's Daddy?""
I stroked her soft hair, lying again, ""He went to work.""
As if on cue, Timothy walked in, holding Hallie in his arms.
Hallie ran to the bedroom door, clutching a Barbie doll, and boasted, ""My daddy bought this for me!""
Seeing the flicker of disappointment in Sienna's eyes, I clenched my fists, forcing down my anger.
""Sia, Daddy prepared a birthday gift for you, too. I'll go get it.""
Sienna's eyes lit up instantly. She nodded happily. ""Thank you, Mommy.""
I stood up, went to the cabinet, took out the gift I'd bought earlier, and placed it gently in her arms.
""Sia, open it. Do you like it?""
Sienna tilted her head, a bright smile spreading across her face. ""Did Daddy really buy this for me?""
""Of course!"" I smiled back.
Suddenly, Hallie rushed over, snatched the gift from Sienna's arms, threw it to the ground, and stamped on it fiercely.
""Hmph! He's my daddy, not yours! My daddy would never buy you gifts!""
Sienna burst into tears.
I stood up, grabbed Hallie by the back of her collar, and dragged her out of the bedroom.
Bullying my daughter right in front of me. Did she really think I wouldn't fight back?
""Let me go, bad woman! I'll make Daddy beat you up!"" Hallie's cries were louder than Sienna's.
Timothy walked out of the bathroom just then and saw Hallie crying. Without a word, he slapped me hard.
""Leticia, what are you trying to do?""
I clutched my burning cheek, shouting, ""I want her out of here!""
Anyone could bully me all he wanted, but I wouldn't allow anyone to bully my daughter.
Never.
""If anyone's leaving, it's you. Don't forget that I bought this house! It has nothing to do with you!""
Flames seemed to flicker in Timothy's eyes, but his words were cold as ice.
My throat felt choked, like something was stuck there. I couldn't say a single word.
Sienna climbed out of bed, hugging my leg tightly.
""Mommy, I don't want the gift! I don't want Daddy either! I can give everything to that girl. I don't want it anymore. Mommy, don't be angry.""
I stroked Sienna's head, tears streaming down silently.
Silly child, how could Mommy not be angry?
I was your mother. I can't stand by and watch you get bullied.
But the anger came with a price. My chest exploded with pain.
It was so intense that cold sweat soaked my forehead.
After a while, the pain finally ebbed.
I packed a few bags, took Sienna's hand, and prepared to leave.
Timothy was feeding Hallie, who was pouting and acting coquettish.
""Daddy, I don't want veggies. I want meat!""
""Good girl, eat more veggies, and you can grow tall.""
Timothy's voice was still so gentle.
But that gentleness had never belonged to Sienna or me.
As I opened the door, I still held a faint fantasy about Timothy.
Once he said just one kind word, I'd stay.
I didn't care if he treated Hallie better or anyone else.
I was dying, and all I wanted was to settle Sienna's future before I left.
Yet Timothy didn't even glance my way, let alone try to keep me stay.
Closing the door behind me, I felt my heart shattered completely.
Sienna cried until her eyes were red, but she never complained.
She held my hand in one small fist, her tiny suitcase in the other, following me aimlessly through the dark.
I found a nearby hotel and checked in.
As soon as we entered the room, my mother called for the first time in years, asking me to come home tomorrow.
Staring at the disconnected call screen, I fell into a daze.
It was the first time she'd contacted me since that incident eight years ago.
I'd thought they'd abandoned me forever.
My wounded heart felt a flicker of comfort.
I held Sienna in my arms, smiling softly, ""Baby, tomorrow I'll take you to Grandparents' house. You have two uncles. Be a good girl when you meet them, okay?""
Sienna nodded. ""Sure, Mommy. I promise!""
All through the night, I was lost in a fantastic dream.
I dreamed of returning home. Dad, Mom, and my two brothers were all smiling, eager to hold Sienna.
Sienna wore a floral dress, clutching a pile of gifts, grinning from ear to ear.
But dreams were just dreams.
When I brought Sienna to the Wallace's house the next day, I realized it was a trap.
It even sped up the end of my life.

I was treated with a single-dose antibiotic and thought it was completely gone. It was most likely triggered by sex. My boyfriend and I have been sexually active for 2 years, and this is the first time I’ve ever had UTI symptoms from it.

We last had sex on Nov 14, and I started having UTI symptoms on Nov 16. I drank a lot of water and the symptoms went away in about 2 days—no more dysuria, no pain. (I’m not sure if it was from sex or the caffeine since we drank both iced coffee and iced matcha that day)

But on Nov 20, I noticed blood in my urine (hematuria). The day before, I drank coffee, and I think that triggered it because my bladder felt irritated again. Today (Nov 21), all symptoms are gone again, and there’s no more blood after increasing my water intake.

I feel like my bladder is still sensitive from the previous UTI and reacts badly to things like caffeine. I’m financially unstable right now, so I’m not sure what I should do next.

I just want to ask if anyone has experienced something similar or knows how this works legally in the Philippines.

I went to a coffee shop in GenSan recently. When I was about to pay, I saw a GCash QR displayed right at the cashier counter, so I scanned it and paid. A few seconds later, the staff told me that the QR I scanned was “not for payment” and was only for display. Apparently, the real payment QR comes from their POS machine and isn’t the one that’s already displayed on the counter.

But the money was already deducted from my digital bank (I use MariBank/SeaBank).

I admit it might have been my mistake for paying impulsively, but at the same time… if you display a GCash QR at the cashier, wouldn’t any normal customer assume it’s for payment? There were no signs saying “not for payment” or “display only.”

I asked for a refund, but the staff said they couldn’t give one. They just told me to leave a note with my details. I messaged their Facebook page and asked for the status but there’s still no reply yet.

What else should I say to follow up? And if they don’t respond, what can I actually do?

Would appreciate any advice or if anyone here knows what laws or consumer rights apply in a situation like this.

""Is this enough?""
I laughed at myself, saying nothing.
I'd devoted seven years, and all I got was 15,000 dollars.
Of course, it wasn't enough.
The little girl in his arms frowned, her tone cold and sharp.

I stared at her familiar features, retorting, ""Funny, I don't like you either. Once your dad pays me what he owes, I'll leave on my own.""

Timothy walked out of the bedroom, ignoring our tears, his brows furrowed with irritation.
""Leticia, we need to talk.""
I swallowed my sobs. ""Talk about what? Your illegitimate daughter? Or about getting a divorce?""
""Don't be ridiculous. Hallie isn't my child. She's Angie, and her ex-husband's daughter. Angie's having appendicitis surgery. She asked me to help take care of Hallie for a few days.""
His explanation did little to ease my feelings.
Angie. It sounded so dear.
No wonder Timothy, who'd always been cold and distant, was so gentle to a stranger's child.
It turned out that the little girl was his unforgettable former lover's daughter.
Seeing I didn't respond, Timothy went on, ""Hallie's father left her when she was born. She's never felt safe, so she has some psychological issues.
""Angie is worried she'll become autistic, so she begged me to pretend to be her dad. For heaven's sake, don't pick on Hallie all the time...""
I cut him off abruptly, ""Timothy, do you know what today is?""
""Sienna's birthday."" Timothy glanced at the cake on the coffee table, his tone flat.
I laughed in anger, ""Then do you know who Sienna is?""
Timothy nodded. ""I know.""
Sienna sat on my lap, her mouth pursed, holding back tears as if afraid to cry.
My heart ached fiercely, and I raised my voice at him. ""If you know, did you buy her a birthday gift? Have you even looked at her since you walked in?
""Hallie is all you ever talk about. Did you ever think about how Sienna feels?""
In seven years of marriage, I'd never lost my temper with Timothy.
Whether he ignored me or his mother berated me, I'd always played dumb, never fighting back.
Tonight, I couldn't hold it in anymore. So I finally snapped.
Timothy seemed stunned by my outburst. He looked at Sienna and mumbled, ""Sorry. I was too busy today, so I forgot to get you a gift.""
""It's okay."" Sienna's voice choked, surprisingly sensible. ""I don't need a gift. I just don't want you to quarrel, please.""
I took a deep breath to calm down.
""Sienna, we're not quarreling. Now that your Daddy's back, let's celebrate your birthday together.""
Timothy didn't say no, so I took it as agreement.
Just as I was putting the birthday hat on Sienna, Hallie pushed open the bedroom door and walked out.
""Daddy, my stomach hurts.""
Timothy stood up at once, striding over to her.
""I'll take you to the hospital.""
Without another word, Timothy lifted Hallie into his arms and headed for the door.
Hallie leaned against his shoulder, shooting me a provocative look.
I understood the message in her eyes clearly and couldn't help curling my lips in a cold smile.
Like mother, like daughter, truly.
As Angela's child, she'd inherited Angela's scheming ways at such a young age.
A competitive streak flared in me then. I couldn't beat Angela, but couldn't I outmatch her daughter?
I called out, ""Timothy, stay for five minutes. At least celebrate Sienna's birthday first before you go.""
Timothy froze, turning to glare at me as if I were heartless.
""Leticia, don't you know what you're talking about? Didn't you hear Hallie say her stomach hurts?""
I clutched my throbbing chest, laughing bitterly at myself.
How absurd!
I couldn't even stand up to a child.
Knowing I couldn't keep him, I fell silent. Numbly, I lit the candles on the cake, going through the motions of celebrating Sienna's birthday in a daze.
Chapter 3
The next morning, it was time to send Sienna to kindergarten, but Timothy still hadn't come home.
I'd thought, after last night, he'd stay away for weeks like he used to.
But I was wrong again.
When I got back, Timothy was on the phone with his mother, asking how to make mushroom soup.
Because Hallie had said she wanted it.
I witnessed this man, who'd never lifted a finger in the kitchen, bustled around in a pink apron, and my heart ached sharply.
Luckily, Sienna wasn't here.
If she'd seen this, she'd probably cry again.
Spotting me, Hallie jumped off the sofa, ran to the kitchen, and hugged Timothy's thigh.
""Daddy, I'm scared. That bad woman is back!""
Timothy bent down, lifting Hallie with one hand while stirring the pot with the other.
""Don't be afraid, Hals. I have a superpower, and I'll protect you.""
Timothy's care and patience for someone else's daughter stung my eyes. My tears welled up fast.
I walked to the kitchen door, leaning against the frame, and said sarcastically, ""Timothy, when you die, who do you think will grieve for you? Who will bother to visit your grave?""
It sure wouldn't be my Sienna.
She'd never gotten an ounce of fatherly love. Why should she grieve for him?
Timothy set down the spoon, turning to glare at me. ""Leticia, you're so cruel.""
I sneered. ""I've always been cruel. Is that new to you?""
Timothy no longer responded. Bored, I went back to my bedroom.
At ten o'clock, I headed to the hospital to pick up my test results.
The doctor looked at me gravely. ""Ms. Wallace, I'm sorry, you have terminal breast cancer...""
I couldn't believe his words, forcing a pale smile. ""Doctor, is there a mistake? I just have breast pain.""
""No."" He shook his head firmly. ""Prolonged pent-up anger and stress likely caused this. I advise you to be admitted to the hospital immediately.""
I couldn't hear the rest of his words. My mind was filled with only one figure: Sienna.
If I were dying, who would look after Sienna?
Her father didn't love her, her paternal grandma disliked her, and her maternal grandparents...
Clutching the wall for support, I stumbled out of the doctor's office and collapsed into a chair in the corridor.
I didn't snap out of it until my phone rang.
Glancing at the screen, I saw it was Sienna's teacher.
I answered quickly, ""Hello, Ms. Patton.""
""Mrs. Bradley, please come to the kindergarten right away. Sienna has a fever.""
After hanging up, I raced out of the hospital, hailed a taxi, and rushed to the school.
Sienna was lying on a small cot, her face bright red with fever. When she saw me, she whispered weakly, ""Mommy, I feel quite well... Don't worry.""
""I'm taking you to the hospital."" I lifted her into my arms, and my chest throbbed with pain again.
Having realized she wasn't favored from a young age, Sienna had always been excessively sensible.
Like me, she never acted coquettishly or knew how to fight for what she wanted.
This kind of temperament was destined to get her hurt.
But I didn't know how to teach her to act coquettish, feign weakness, or pretend to be ill like Hallie.
When we got home from the hospital, Timothy was holding Hallie, reading her the story of ""Cinderella.""
I stood there with Sienna in my arms and a pile of medicine in my hand, but he ignored us completely, as if we were invisible.
I felt like my heart had been torn to shreds. The pain was so sharp I could barely breathe.
In that moment, I regretted marrying Timothy.
I even regretted giving birth to Sienna.
I'd brought her into this world, yet couldn't give her happiness. That was my failure as a mother.
But there was no going back.
All I could do was love Sienna with every last bit of my strength for the time I had left.
I laid Sienna on the bed, tucked her in, and headed to the kitchen to make her something to eat.
She loved my home-made chicken sandwich, but there was no fresh chicken at home.
I turned to Timothy on the sofa, saying, ""Sienna's sick. Could you watch her for a minute? I have to buy some ingredients. I'll be right back.""
Timothy sat there like a statue, not uttering a word.
I was used to it and left the house without another word.
When I got back from shopping, I froze. Hallie was holding my lipstick, drawing turtles all over Sienna's face.
Rage surged through me. I shouted, ""Hallie! What the hell are you doing?""
Hallie jumped, bursting into tears.
Timothy rushed out of the bedroom, scooping Hallie up. ""Baby, don't cry. What happened?""
I pointed at Sienna's smudged face, roaring, ""What happened? Look at what she did!""
""The kids were just playing for fun. Do you really need to get so angry?"" Timothy frowned, his eyes blazing with irritation.
""Playing for fun?"" I glared at him. Chest pain was squeezing the air from my lungs. ""How about I draw turtles on your face? Give me a chance to play for fun.""
""Are you insane?"" Timothy snapped, turning to walk away with Hallie.
I was frantic, refusing to let him go.
""Yes! I am insane! I'm dying, Timothy. Are you satisfied now? You can finally be with your former lover. Are you happy?""
Timothy ignored me, cooing gently to Hallie, ""Baby, stop crying. I'll take you to buy toys.""
Chapter 4
Timothy must be happy. After all, he loved Angela so deeply.
Even seven years ago, when Angela abandoned him, a poor boy, for money, he never stopped loving her.
He adored her down to his very soul.
As his wife who'd walked with him from poverty to prosperity, I was merely an object for him to satisfy his needs.
Whenever he needed me, he'd wave me over. If not, he'd ignore me.
Yet he'd been the one to get on his knees and beg me to marry him.
Why did he treat me so cruelly after I said yes?
Thinking back, I was foolish.
Maybe he'd begged me only for the money I had.
Once he got it, he no longer needed me and naturally lost all patience.
Sienna suddenly woke up, her voice weak as an injured kitten. She was clearly unwell.
I pulled myself together, walking to the bed to comfort her.
""How are you feeling? Still hurting?""
""Not anymore."" Sienna shook her head. ""Where's Daddy?""
I stroked her soft hair, lying again, ""He went to work.""
As if on cue, Timothy walked in, holding Hallie in his arms.
Hallie ran to the bedroom door, clutching a Barbie doll, and boasted, ""My daddy bought this for me!""
Seeing the flicker of disappointment in Sienna's eyes, I clenched my fists, forcing down my anger.
""Sia, Daddy prepared a birthday gift for you, too. I'll go get it.""
Sienna's eyes lit up instantly. She nodded happily. ""Thank you, Mommy.""
I stood up, went to the cabinet, took out the gift I'd bought earlier, and placed it gently in her arms.
""Sia, open it. Do you like it?""
Sienna tilted her head, a bright smile spreading across her face. ""Did Daddy really buy this for me?""
""Of course!"" I smiled back.
Suddenly, Hallie rushed over, snatched the gift from Sienna's arms, threw it to the ground, and stamped on it fiercely.
""Hmph! He's my daddy, not yours! My daddy would never buy you gifts!""
Sienna burst into tears.
I stood up, grabbed Hallie by the back of her collar, and dragged her out of the bedroom.
Bullying my daughter right in front of me. Did she really think I wouldn't fight back?
""Let me go, bad woman! I'll make Daddy beat you up!"" Hallie's cries were louder than Sienna's.
Timothy walked out of the bathroom just then and saw Hallie crying. Without a word, he slapped me hard.
""Leticia, what are you trying to do?""
I clutched my burning cheek, shouting, ""I want her out of here!""
Anyone could bully me all he wanted, but I wouldn't allow anyone to bully my daughter.
Never.
""If anyone's leaving, it's you. Don't forget that I bought this house! It has nothing to do with you!""
Flames seemed to flicker in Timothy's eyes, but his words were cold as ice.
My throat felt choked, like something was stuck there. I couldn't say a single word.
Sienna climbed out of bed, hugging my leg tightly.
""Mommy, I don't want the gift! I don't want Daddy either! I can give everything to that girl. I don't want it anymore. Mommy, don't be angry.""
I stroked Sienna's head, tears streaming down silently.
Silly child, how could Mommy not be angry?
I was your mother. I can't stand by and watch you get bullied.
But the anger came with a price. My chest exploded with pain.
It was so intense that cold sweat soaked my forehead.
After a while, the pain finally ebbed.
I packed a few bags, took Sienna's hand, and prepared to leave.
Timothy was feeding Hallie, who was pouting and acting coquettish.
""Daddy, I don't want veggies. I want meat!""
""Good girl, eat more veggies, and you can grow tall.""
Timothy's voice was still so gentle.
But that gentleness had never belonged to Sienna or me.
As I opened the door, I still held a faint fantasy about Timothy.
Once he said just one kind word, I'd stay.
I didn't care if he treated Hallie better or anyone else.
I was dying, and all I wanted was to settle Sienna's future before I left.
Yet Timothy didn't even glance my way, let alone try to keep me stay.
Closing the door behind me, I felt my heart shattered completely.
Sienna cried until her eyes were red, but she never complained.
She held my hand in one small fist, her tiny suitcase in the other, following me aimlessly through the dark.
I found a nearby hotel and checked in.
As soon as we entered the room, my mother called for the first time in years, asking me to come home tomorrow.
Staring at the disconnected call screen, I fell into a daze.
It was the first time she'd contacted me since that incident eight years ago.
I'd thought they'd abandoned me forever.
My wounded heart felt a flicker of comfort.
I held Sienna in my arms, smiling softly, ""Baby, tomorrow I'll take you to Grandparents' house. You have two uncles. Be a good girl when you meet them, okay?""
Sienna nodded. ""Sure, Mommy. I promise!""
All through the night, I was lost in a fantastic dream.
I dreamed of returning home. Dad, Mom, and my two brothers were all smiling, eager to hold Sienna.
Sienna wore a floral dress, clutching a pile of gifts, grinning from ear to ear.
But dreams were just dreams.
When I brought Sienna to the Wallace's house the next day, I realized it was a trap.
It even sped up the end of my life.

1p2uv1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/MastersOfRealityGame/comments/1p2uv1r/hello_world/,"Hello, world!","Aloha!

I am the solo developer behind **Masters of Reality**, an upcoming retro **fantasy idle browser RPG** which I have been quietly working on for some time. 

***My story***

I am a full-stack software engineer with almost 9 years of experience in web development, and an avid gamer. Some of my favorite games are **Oldschool Runescape**, **Factorio** and **Hearthstone**. 

***Motivation***

In the last few years, gaming companies have successfully tapped into our nostalgia by bringing back the MMORPG classics we loved as children. However, as I transitioned into adult life, I found myself no longer having the time these games require. MMORPGs often demand huge, ongoing time commitments. One morning, while drinking my daily coffee, I suddenly remembered the golden era of 2004–2008 browser games: **OGame**, **Bitefight**, **The Crims**, **Travian**, **Hattrick** and others. An idea began to form in my mind: what if we could recapture the fun of multiplayer browser games, but rebuild it using modern web technologies and deeper game systems.

***The Problem***

Modern games often miss the mark. They try to innovate too hard or add bloated systems that dilute the fun. Meanwhile, games that lean into retro aesthetics often lack substance, boiling down to basic mechanics and shallow loops. We live in an age where **nostalgia is powerful**, yet the games we return to from the 2000s era feel **clunky** and **outdated** compared to what we’ve come to expect in 2025.

On top of that, games today are too easy and too linear. With instant gratification at the forefront, players rarely feel a sense of progression, mastery, or personal achievement. And for adults balancing careers, hobbies, and social lives, traditional multiplayer games often demand **more time than they can give**, leading many to abandon the idea altogether. People want to play, but **on their terms**. Idle games offer a partial solution, but most of them are too simple or disconnected from meaningful narrative and depth.

And worst of all? Players no longer trust developers. Misguided updates and poor design decisions have ruined too many beloved titles.

***The Solution***

I am building a **retro-inspired browser MMORPG**, carefully adapted for the modern player. A game that borrows the soul of the games we loved: RuneScape, World of Warcraft, Mu Online etc., but with **modern tools and smarter design**. Think intricate questlines, worldbuilding, opt-in PvP, exploration, achievements, and seasonal world evolution, all wrapped in a format you can play in **short bursts** or **deep sessions**.

The design is centered around **smart time investment**. Players can engage in quick, satisfying daily tasks while gradually working toward deeper, more rewarding systems. It’s a game that **respects your time**, whether you have ten minutes or ten hours, and continues to grow even when you’re not online, thanks to **idle mechanics**.

The seasonal aspect of the game allows anyone to jump in without fear of being ""behind."" The world evolves, but **the playing field stays fair**.

And finally, it’s a **community-driven game**. Like the best parts of Old School RuneScape, **major changes are voted on by players**. No more patches/updates that ruin everything. This world isn’t just for you, it’s **shaped by you**.

This is more than just a game. It’s a return to what made games **good**, but finally built for how we live and play today.

***The Game***

**Masters of Reality** is set in a world trapped in repeating cycles of conflict and shifting realities. You begin as a **Warborn**, a warrior with no past and a **Codex** that records your actions, anchors you to existence, and quietly feeds an ancient force that shapes the world. Each season **rewrites reality**, and players help decide what the next world becomes.

The game blends exploration, hex-based travel, dungeons, dynamic skills, faction warfare, and an evolving seasonal world. It targets players who grew up with titles like RuneScape or World of Warcraft but now want progression, discovery, and meaningful choices without the pressure to play for hours every day. Short sessions are valid, and idle elements support that. The community also helps steer the game’s evolution through voting and feedback.

***The Future***

This subreddit will initially serve as the development home for the project. I will post regular DevLogs documenting progress, decisions, systems, and worldbuilding. The goal is to build openly and invite a community that enjoys seeing a world take shape from the ground up.

If you are interested in fantasy, seasonal worlds, or RPGs built around identity and discovery, you are in the right place.

Honestly… these things are ridiculous in the best way.  
  
First off—the size. “Big Ass” is not exaggeration. This thing is basically a piece of furniture. I put it on my coffee table and it instantly made the whole room feel like a fancy hotel lobby.  
  
Scent: I got the Santal Ember and Cedar Smoke. They’re way richer and more layered than normal candles. Not that cheap perfumey smell—more like a boutique fragrance room diffuser. My whole living room smells good even when it's not lit, which kind of shocked me.  
  
Aesthetic: The heavy glass jar looks insane in person. Feels like something you'd see in a luxury hotel or a designer’s house. It’s heavy enough to double as a blunt weapon if someone breaks in lol.  
  
Downside: Yeah, they’re pricey. More of a “treat yourself” or gift-type item. But the size + scent strength + how slow it burns actually made it feel like a better value than my usual $40 candles.  
  
Overall: If you’re into home scents or just want your place to feel like a high-end Airbnb, they’re 100% worth trying. Not an everyday candle, but absolutely a statement piece.

Before you start writing, it’s crucial to get yourself into the right mindset. You may be experiencing feelings of panic, feeling as though you don’t have enough time and you can’t do it. You may feel defeated before you’ve even begun. To be successful, however, you will need to banish these negative feelings. It’s vital to be positive, to try to relish the challenge, and to adopt a ‘can-do’ attitude. If it helps, imagine it’s a battle that you’re going to win. Give yourself a pep talk, and keep the end goal in mind: you’re going to do a great job and impress your teacher. You’re going to prove to yourself that you can take on this challenge, enjoy it, and write an essay in record time. Take a deep breath, remain calm, and start to attack the work systematically and logically.

# 2. Switch off your phone and social networks

The last thing you need when you only have a couple of hours to write an essay is to get distracted by your phone or social networks, which have a habit of eating away at your time without you even realising. Procrastination isn’t an option at this late stage, so it’s time to ban yourself from your phone, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, iPlayer, YouTube, and anything else you think might distract you. Sit somewhere quiet and put a Do Not Disturb sign on the door. If it helps, install a full-screen text editor onto your computer, such as Darkroom, to force yourself to look at your essay and only your essay. You can also get browser apps that keep you off social networks for a time period of your choosing.

# 3. Type your essay rather than handwriting it

Most young people these days type faster than they write by hand, so unless you’ve been told that you must handwrite your essay, type it. This will make it much easier to edit what you’ve written and change things around, and you’ll be able to get more words in through typing quickly. It’s probably also going to be easier for your teacher to read a typed document than your handwriting, and you won’t suffer an achy arm that could slow you down, so that’s an added bonus.

# 4. Read the question carefully

When you’re in a rush, it can be easy to skim over the question and think you’ve understood it – only for you to realise, after writing most of the essay, that you got the wrong end of the stick and it’s too late to change it. This is particularly hazardous when you’re under pressure, because your brain has a tendency to see what it wants to see; it may tell you that the title is asking a question that you want to answer, while the reality might be subtly but crucially different. So, start by reading the question very carefully and ensuring you’ve completely understood what it’s asking you to do. If it helps, underline key instructional words in the title, such as “compare” or “analyse”. This forces your mind to focus on the right kind of task, so you write the essay with this in mind.

# 5. Get your books ready

Prepare your workspace by opening the books you’ll need to use on relevant pages, or putting Post-It notes in them to mark where relevant information is. This means you won’t have to keep wasting precious time hunting through books to find the information each time you need to refer to it.

# 6. Sum up your argument in a sentence

To get yourself thinking clearly about what you’re going to be writing, see if you can sum up what your argument is going to be in a single sentence – a bit like an ‘elevator pitch’. If you can’t do this, the chances are that you don’t quite know what you want to say, with the result that you may end up waffling in your essay, thereby wasting valuable time. It’s important to set out with a clear idea of what your argument is, because then everything you write subsequently will be working towards the goal of getting this particular argument across. Of course, don’t spend too long on this and end up with not enough time to write the actual essay!

# 7. Write your notes directly into the document

When you’re in a hurry, your notes can double up as an essay plan, killing two birds with one stone. Start by typing your essay notes directly into the document you’ve created for your essay. This could be bullet points or one-sentence summaries of what you want to write in each paragraph. For each point, also include a line or two on what evidence you’re going to use in support. Once you’ve done this, organise the notes into a sensible structure by dragging and dropping paragraphs into an order you think works. This becomes your detailed essay plan.

# 8. Then rewrite your notes into an essay with an argument

You now have the outline of your essay in note form. You can now turn your notes into an essay by rewriting them into academic prose, complete with ‘filler’ sentences that glue it all together and help build your argument.

# 9. Save the introduction and conclusion for last

Perhaps surprisingly, the introduction and conclusion of an essay are often the hardest bits to write. So, save these for last. By the time you’ve written the body of the essay, the task of writing the introduction and a summarising conclusion should be much easier, as you’ll already have spent plenty of time on your argument and you’ll be very familiar with it.

# 10. Do the references as you go along

If you’re required to add references and a bibliography to your essay, do these as you go along to save time. Each time you quote someone, add in a footnote saying where the quote is from, and at the same time, copy and paste the details of the book into a bibliography at the end of your document.

# 11. Proofread as you go along

Save time on proofreading by checking over each sentence or paragraph for spelling, grammar and typos as you write it. When you’ve finished writing, it’s still worth having a quick final read through your essay for a sense check and to ensure that it flows well – but this should take less time now that you’ve already checked for errors.

# 12. Don’t be tempted to copy and paste

The internet is full of resources that probably exactly match what you’re going to be writing about, and when you’re in a hurry, there can be a strong temptation to copy and paste useful paragraphs into your essay. Don’t ever do this! Plagiarism is not only immoral, but it also means that you won’t learn the topic in as much depth – and the whole point of writing an essay is to consolidate what you’ve learned and prepare you adequately for future exams. Teachers can use Google too, and if they suspect that you’ve stolen someone else’s work by copying and pasting something off the internet, all they need to do is type one of ‘your’ sentences in Google and they’ll instantly find where you’ve got it from. It’s normally easy to spot copied work, because the style will be different from the rest of the essay. It’s just not worth the risk, as you’ll lose your teacher’s trust and this will probably be reflected in the quality of the reference they give you for university.

# 13. Try not to over-quote

A common tactic by students pushed for time is to use too many quotes – or very long passages – from other people (scholars, sources and so on) to bolster the word count and reduce the amount of writing they actually have to do themselves. Try to avoid doing this if you can; it’s a transparent tactic and shows that you haven’t fully mastered the subject yourself, so you have to resort to hiding behind the words of others. The vast majority of the writing in the essay should be your own. Short quotes here and there, accompanied by your commentary on them, are a good thing; lots of long quotes that take up much of the essay, with little explanation from you, are not.

# 14. Keep your style concise

You’re not going to have time for long-winded sentences, so keep your written style as concise as possible. There’s nothing wrong with being short and to the point in your sentences, providing it adequately conveys what you want the essay to convey. Being economical with words will ensure that you express yourself clearly as well as saving you time, so it’s a good idea all round.

# 15. Try a change of scene

If you’re struggling to concentrate on writing your essay in your normal work space, a change of scene might be just what you need to focus your mind. If you normally work at home, try heading to the library or a local coffee shop to see if you can work any better there. If you’re distracted by noise at home, try some noise-cancelling headphones or simply put some music on.

# 16. Take a break (but only if you feel you need one)

It sounds counterintuitive when you’re pushed for time, but taking short breaks from time to time will stop you running out of energy and keep you focused. If you have two hours to write the essay, for instance, take a break for five minutes after you’ve worked for an hour. That said, if you’re really ‘in the zone’ and working efficiently, and you don’t feel you need a break, just work straight through and take advantage of your spate of productivity for as long as it lasts.

# 17. Don’t bother with the usual tricks

Many students try to trick their teacher into thinking that their essay is longer than it really is by widening the margins, selecting a bigger font and using wider line spacing. Your teacher will see straight through this, and it might irritate them – so don’t bother!

# 18. It’s OK to use Google for quick research

While Google is no substitute for reading what you’ve been told to read, it can be useful for quick definitions or getting to grips with something you’re struggling with at the last minute. Don’t rely on it, by any means, but if you’re writing your essay and haven’t quite understood something in class, a quick Google search should enable you to acquire the level of understanding you need.

# 19. Keep hydrated and fed

Make sure you drink plenty of water while you’re writing, as this will help you stay alert. You may also want to equip yourself with some snacks to keep you going, as this can make the process of writing an essay more bearable as well as maintaining your energy levels.

# 20. Reward yourself

Give yourself something to look forward to once you’ve finished the essay, as this will help to motivate you to complete it. It could be a chocolate bar, the promise of watching an episode of your favourite television show, or an evening out with friends – anything that will provide sufficient incentive to get your essay finished.

1p2ul57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mildlynomil/comments/1p2ul57/update_mil_raising_my_blood_pressure/,Update: MIL Raising My Blood Pressure,"Posted here about a month ago about my MIL raising my blood pressure after I gave birth to my LO (can’t believe he’s almost 7 weeks old!).

Anyways, apparently she told DH she “feels terrible” about throwing my things away and nearly damaging my wearable electronic pumps. I don’t understand why she couldn’t tell me this instead of DH if she’s genuinely sorry!!! I didn’t even list out everything that drove me crazy to DH, and he surely sugar coated it to his mom so she only knows of a fraction of what drove me crazy. She did end up texting me to apologize about borrowing two hair clips and not returning them. Seriously? My over $300 wearable pumps were soaking in soapy water but you’re going to apologize about two 20 year old hair clips? It took about a month for us to find nearly everything that was lost or put in the wrong place (of the items that weren’t thrown away). Unfortunately LO’s hospital band was more than likely thrown away in the diaper pail (if not taken by my MIL) and coincidentally the snoopy pajamas I said were my favorite of his also went missing and have never reappeared 🫠 (I’m sure we’ll find some of LO’s things in many years among her things after she passes away).

So somehow word got back to my BIL (DH’s brother) and SIL about some of the things MIL did at our home during my first few weeks of postpartum and they both do not want her to help them when their baby arrives in late December (unfortunately this means she will be staying with us 😫). Glad my experience could at least warn them. Unfortunately DH still doesn’t see how his mom is the issue. He thinks I have unrealistic expectations and everything was a simple misunderstanding. I believe most of the things she did were actually mistakes because I have noticed she has a complete lack of attention to detail. I can tell her something more than three times in a week and she will still forget. I swear a squirrel has a better memory than her. And she does basic things so haphazardly (she loads a dishwasher like a drunk raccoon). Some things may have been intentional though, like LO’s things going missing.

DH is giving her the benefit of the doubt. He said next time she’s here we will give her a full tour of the house explaining how we do everything. I’m completely aware that this will not fix our issues though, because the main issue is she’s incredibly forgetful. But I’m planning on bringing up anything that really bothers me to DH and remind her of things. I just have a very hard time CONSTANTLY correcting her. Literally every little thing she does drives me crazy and DH thinks I’m too sensitive. But seriously, who takes dirty dishes and silverware from the sink, rinses them off and calls them clean, then puts them away wet!!! I shouldn’t have to explain bacteria and mold to a 63 year old woman.

I think if things continue to be bad I’ll be able to show a pattern of behavior to DH and we can enact some rules. I did spend a month asking him first where everything was, then insisting he contact his mom to ask her where she put things. I’m hoping this was enough communication for them to understand the disfunction and confusion she caused. He said he already told her it would be best for her to literally not throw anything away without permission. But I don’t understand her rearranging my things that have no reason to move. I understand grabbing a mug for coffee and putting it back on the wrong shelf, but why did a vase move from one end of the living room to the other and my potted plants in the front yard were all rearranged (I was actually sitting in the hospital in labor when I got a security camera notification and saw her moving all my potted plants of camera 🤨). I had to move them all back so I wouldn’t hit them with the stroller and so I could fully open a gate. Also I found a pile of pacifiers in the junk drawer. That was awesome because i had already bought their replacements.

Death is an expression. It's not one of anguish or anger. It's a jovial smile. The kind where the joke is on the living, and they hadn't just realized it yet. That they were the butt of it. Not until they see the turned-up lips of death's smile, do they realize they are the ones being laughed at. 

I was awoken to the ringing of my phone. In the past, I had always done the status quo. So after spelunking for a while, I got my official caving license. It seemed like the normal thing to do, although I never considered myself a true caver at heart. Calling myself a professional was out of the question. 

Yet, the call still rang. At the time, I wasn't aware who the caller was. if I'd known, I wonder if I would've picked up.  It was just someone's unknown number, so I had thought it was a wrong number, and I said that in my sleepy greeting. But the urgency of the caller's voice woke me up instantly. 

A newly discovered cave lay unexplored in the farmland of Tennessee. Stacy Winfry, a fifty-two-year-old woman, had fallen into a sinkhole nearby. The ground collapsed beneath her feet as she was taking photos of a few asphodel flowers that only surrounded a lonely cave. She was with her husband Richard at the time. Those two were a notorious caving duo, famous for thousands of photos taken inside the world's deadliest caves. This was supposed to be their last mission together before they retired from caving completely. 

What a cruel joke. 

I knew all too well that this was probably more of a body recovery mission than a rescue, but it was still being treated as a rescue. Nobody probably wanted to admit it. That she was dead. 

No one could get close to the edge of the sinkhole without the earth collapsing even more. So the only plan first responders could think of was to send a few people into the cave to see if they could find the bottom of the hole. I was one out of five with enough experience and close enough to get there in good time. 

I have been caving for years and usually wouldn't feel this nervous going in. The reason I was even in Tennessee was to see the lost sea inside Craighead's cavern. A well-traveled spot I hadn't been to yet, just because of how far it was from home. It was something I wanted to see with my own eyes. The lost sea, the largest underground body of water that humankind has discovered. I didn’t get into caving for the fun of it, it sort of found me. I consider myself a hobbyist at most. I am not a very physical person either. Most would describe me as the scrawny nerd type. 

So I had no idea why I was chosen. If I had any sort of reputation among cavers, it was the quiet guy who had struggles keeping up with the others. I have never been on a rescue, since I have never been asked to help that way before. My experience in new parts is limited, probably due other’s lack of interest in letting me tag along on their trips

There were four others the first responder’s had asked and they already agreed to help. So if I said no, I would be the only one. I didn't know who was on the team yet exactly. But word tends to spread, especially in a hobby like caving. I didn't want to deal with rumors when I already had issues finding people who I enjoyed caving with. I didn't want to lose this community either. They were the only people I spoke to these days. 

So against my better judgment I also agreed. Even though I knew this decision was stupid, I would be the weakest link. Although with rescues like this, the more people involved meant there was safety in numbers and a greater chance at success. So I could easily tell myself I was needed and wouldn’t drag anyone down. 

I got dressed and packed up my supplies. I checked out of the shitty motel in Sweet Water. I was heading towards Athens. Although the destination would be a cattle ranch vaguely between both cities, it wasn't exactly on the route. 

The hills and green land blurred into each other with every turn. A part of me wished I would lose signal and get lost in the back roads somewhere. But the last turn came abruptly as a long gravel driveway took me to the farmland where the cave was. A long line of emergency vehicles was parked outside, their lights still flashing blue and red. But no one was there. So the only noise was the turning of rocks beneath the car's tires. 

A lonely man sat quietly on his porch. His hands take a shaky drag from his cigarette. As I approached his house he stood up. 

I introduced myself, “Hello, I am Ryan Jesterlyn. I am here for the rescue. I’m one of the cavers.”

The older man gave a nod. “A lot of you folk have been coming back and forth this way.” 

He wobbled off the front porch and started to walk down a path that led behind his home. I stayed silent assuming I should follow him. I awkwardly tried to come up with something to say, but he spoke up first. 

“I was excited at first…finding that cave on my property. It's been me and the cows for a good while now. I thought it would bring people.” The homeowner said. 

“How did you find it?” I asked. 

I was a bit of curiosity how a cave could have gone unnoticed on land frequently used. Although, again I didn’t have to say anything. 

“I saw one of the calves stuck between two boulders. After getting it unstuck I saw that it was deeper than just that. Ya'know cows are always getting stuck in weird spots.” He answered. 

I didn't know but nodded. He walked a bit slowly through the farmland. It wasn't his fault, his whole body trembled with each step. I couldn’t tell if it was him being older or from the stress of the events from earlier that morning. He opened up a gate to a field overgrown with flowers and tall grass. 

Slowly I could see more people on the scene. One or two passed us walking back from where we came. A bigger group closer to the site were taking a smoke break. Probably discussing the rescue. 

“I wish I didn't call or it was one of mine instead.” The farmer said. “The cows are all I have left yet…yet… It's so terrible that it's someone. She seemed really nice.” 

I heard the guilt held within his voice. I felt bad for him, that was for sure. Nature took its turn and played a nasty trick, and he wasn't the one to blame for it. The other first responders probably had already told him that. I knew those thoughts well and they couldn’t be changed by a few words. I knew anything I could tell him wouldn’t change his feelings in the slightest. Whatever happened today would gnaw on our skulls for a very long time. \* 

“Can you save her?” He asked. 

“I'll do my best,”  was my reply. 

His question startled me. I wasn't about to become full of empty promises for temporary comfort. He nodded again before shuffling back to his house.

I scanned the group of first responders while walking closer awkwardly. I didn't know who was in charge or where to go exactly. Caution tape surrounded the large hole in the ground. Even from a distance I could sense its depth. There was a small creek flowing quietly. Just beyond that a few boulders stacked against each other that matched up the farmer's description. In the crook of them also seemed another much smaller hole in the earth. Which would have definitely been hidden by the tall grass if it wasn't trampled and cut already. 

An arm swung around my shoulder. “Ryan! It's great to see you here.” 

I felt two kinds of relief at once. I already knew someone who was coming on the mission, Noah Leigh. He was a good guy and I don't say that much. But the other relief I felt is that I had agreed to do this. If I had said no it wouldn't just have strangers I was letting down. He was the reason I was even here in the first place. 

“Its great to see you too.” I said. 

“Well once we're in we can catch up a bit, let me bring you to the others,” Noah said. 

Noah was smiling like his usual self. Dirt already covered his freshly shaved face. His blonde hair blended into the sunlight as I followed him. I squinted because it was too bright and he was too cheerful for this morning. Especially when the weather channel forecaster said it would rain today.

 The group of the three other cavers stood out from the rest. They were geared up and their attitudes were of determination rather than the worried looks others on the scene gave. They seemed deep in discussion. Richard Winfry was the focus of it. I could recognize his appearance from the magazines. His overgrown white beard and overalls made him look like he belonged more at the farm than the actual owner. 

 

“It's okay to stay out of this one. It would be a lot to handle.” The only woman of the group said. 

She had long dark brown hair and eyes to match. She was pretty petite as well. So she was an important member of the team, being able to go where us bulkier men couldn't. I wondered why she was the only woman aboard this mission. It would be better if everyone here was as short as her. I guess I half counted. I wasn't that tall either. 

“I'm going in.” Richard's voice was firm. 

“Well I think it's a good idea,” the last man of the group said. He sounded full of it and he looked the part too. He was tall, fit, and handsome. Seemed to be from head to toe in name brand gear. “We need his experience.” 

Richard ignored the two and walked over to us. The handsome man who I hadn’t gotten the name of yet, beamed with excitement. Probably from the opportunity to cave with Mr. Winfry. The woman just rolled her eyes at him. 

“My name is Richard Winfry,” the man with no introductions necessary said. “Thanks for coming out today. We could really use any help on this rescue.”

Richard shook my hand. I assumed he already had met Noah before I had arrived. Since he didn’t shake his after mine.  

“Its no problem at all, we are glad to be able to help.” Noah said. I nodded to look like I was agreeing with my friend. 

Richard nodded approvingly. “That one there is Nathan Shields, the short one is Kimberly Heathren. Looks like you already know Noah”  

Richard pointed at them without looking back. Kimberly waved and Nathan gave a smug stare. I waved back awkwardly. Nathan scoffed while Kimberly smiled politely. 

“Yeah, thanks. I do know him. My name is Ryan Jesterlyn.” I said. I felt like a fool with the way my words came out. 

“There isn't much of a plan. But just going in and seeing if we can find her. “ Richard said. Instantly changing the subject away from introductions. 

So the plan was the just the good old ‘go fuck around and find out’. I knew it was going to be like this but somehow I still felt uneasy by the thought. Richard left us to continue his efforts by double checking our supplies. 

Soon enough we made it to the cave entrance, it was a hole just big enough for a person to squeeze through. There were tall white flowers littering the ground by the cave. None of the first responders went past the creek. A visible border for those of us willing to risk death I suppose. 

“I hope we can save her and come out of this as heroes,” Noah whispered into my ear with excitement. 

Noah had been a hero for a while. He was too dense to have realized. I didn't reply and he elbowed me. I just nodded back. I could never be seen as a hero even if we returned with Stacy alive. 

Kimberly was going to be the first one to go in. Since she was the smallest it would be the easiest for her to get in and out. I watched her say goodbye to her mother. Her mom hugged her and tied a red scarf around her daughter's neck more snugly, before saying goodbye. My mouth went dry seeing that. 

She went in pretty easily.  We could hear the rolling of a few rocks. But she shouted from below that she was fine and it was safe. We went in one after the other. I was the last in. A stream of water connected to the one outside, also followed us down as we skidded across the gravel. Once at the bottom I heard the howling and barking of three dogs. There weren't any I saw earlier so they must have just arrived. Another pointless venture in the rescue. 

The first chamber wasn't too huge. But we weren't uncomfortable standing there. The small stream led down a tunnel wide enough for two of us to walk side by side. It seemed pretty steep, as it was going deeper into the earth. It seemed that to make any progress forwards towards the sinkhole, the deeper we had to go. Stacy wasn’t here of course. We assumed she landed somewhere else inside of the cave. But a part of us all hoped it was that easy. I knew I was disappointed in figuring out that we probably had to go far inside. 

The cave walls were the color of sand. They bent and curved in an alien type shape. There was no moss growing on the sides of the cave. Despite it looking pretty damp. The ground wasn't entirely flat either, it almost looked like water permanently stuck in movement. Using my flash light to follow it, there were stripes of a redder brown rock flowing through it. 

Kimberly had already set up a safety line. It was a bright orange so we could easily see it to follow our way back. It was tied to a stalagmite. Scanning with our lights we made our way carefully. 

“I promise we'll find her.” Kimberly said to Richard. She was walking next to him while taking the lead. 

“Don't worry Robbie, we all promise to find her together.” Noah said cheerfully. 

Noah was walking right next to me and Nathan walked behind us. He self proclaimed himself as the next best experienced. Which was true, I had heard his name mentioned a few times for being an upcoming talent within spelunking. He took the rear just in case something happened from behind. 

“Don't call me that ever again,” Mr Winfry said. 

Noah elbowed me. Probably to egg me on to make a fake promise as well. 

“I promise to do my best to find her.” Nathan said. He was brimming with confidence. 

“Me too..” I said quickly.

 Richard just sighed and continued in silence. For the entrance zone of this cave and for the outside to be brimming with life there were no small critters or fauna to be found. It was utterly lifeless in an environment that many creatures could call home.

I looked at Noah a few times. We have caved together enough for him to know that meant I had something to say to him. Even in the dimmed light I could sense his eyebrows raised with curiosity. 

“I’m kind of nervous.” I said quietly so hopefully only he would hear me. “I haven't done a rescue before like this.” 

“I'm here with you. “ Noah said, patting my shoulder. I heard the loudest whiniest sigh from behind me. 

“So who's bright idea was it to bring the newb?” Nathan asked. 

I didn't think he was necessarily wrong for having a concern. But the way he said it made me feel even more awkward. I was already growing to dislike him. 

“Don't be so rude. He isn't, we do tons of caving stuff together.” Noah instantly came to my defense like a dog would defend its master. Nathan scoffed like he was about to make a retort. 

“Shut up and focus.” Richard said.

 We continued in silence yet again. We came across our first fork in the road. The tunnel we were in split apart into two separate directions. 

“I'll take Noah and Ryan down this way. Kimberly and Nathan will go that way” Richard pointed down a tunnel towards the left where the little stream continued down for us to follow him. 

While he pointed towards the tunnel on the right for Nathan and Kimberly to go down. Kimberly gave a thumbs up. She connected another rope to the one we were already using and she handed the original one to Richard. 

“See you guys later then,” Kimberly said. 

Nathan smiled and gave a casual salute paired with a wave. Before following Kimberly into the darkness. I was glad to see him go. Some of my anxiousness would wear off with him out of sight. Richard was already a few paces ahead of us. Our helmet head lamps and flash lights still provided enough light so there was enough visibility still. 

“After all this we should all get Denny's"" Noah said. “I know I'll be famished.” 

“Sure why not.” I replied. 

Noah was just trying to keep a good mood during this stressful caving rescue. He only ever offered to eat out after he was feeling that way about a cave. Seldom happened, but was something I picked up on long ago.  

“I could really go for cheap pancakes right now.” Noah said. 

“Or another cup of coffee.” I replied. 

“Dude, look at your eye bags. Any more caffeine and I fear you'll stay up until you hear God or some shit,” Noah said before stumbling a bit on the unsteady ground. I grabbed his arm and pulled him back so he wouldn't crash into Richard.  

“Oops-” before Noah could even properly apologize Richard shot him a glare.

“Let's be quiet now.” Richard said. 

We both stayed quiet after that. Noah gave me a guilty look. He wasn't very good at reading the room but he always had good intentions. I could see Richard's irritation  with his attitude. I was the same way when I first met Noah. While I couldn't imagine how Richard was feeling and thinking right now, I was in a pretty dark spot as well when I first met him. Maybe Noah's tenacity will eventually cheer up Mr. Winfry like it had for me. 

We entered the second chamber. Something was wrong with the stalactites; they were all too uniformed hanging from the ceiling. But I didn't have time to fully take a look. We suddenly could hear the panicked voices of Nathan and Kimberly echoing through the chamber and all of us rushed over towards the noise.

Kimberly was in the new chamber with us, apparently both tunnels connected back together again. On the other hand Nathan was stuck half way between the tunnel and chamber. The tunnel had gotten more narrow the closer to the end it got. Only Kimberly could slip through easily. Now the entrance Kimberly came through was a Nathan and rock sandwich. 

“I knew your fat ass wouldn't fit. “ Kimberly complained. “I told you to turn around and meet up again with the others, idiot.”

She pointed back at us, which happened to land on me. The look Nathan gave me because of it, made my skin crawl. I already could tell that he didn’t like me that much. The added bonus of his embarrassment sure didn’t help. Kimberly insisted Noah and I each grab a limb and pull to dislodge him. 

I felt unsettled in this part of the cave. It wasn't just the newness of rescue or normal cave jitters anymore. I could tell out of my corner of my eye and with the limited light something looked so off. It was all too smooth, the stalactites I mean. I grabbed Nathan's leg and Noah grabbed his arm. 

Richard stood off to the side impatiently.  Although his eyes remained on us. Like he was there just in case one of us tripped. Kimberly could be louder than I thought as she counted to help us time when to pull. I felt like we barely managed to pull him out. Nathan gave a barely noticeable thanks, but Noah was already saying no problem to Nathan's ignorance.

Finally with no one in immediate danger we could finally look where the cave took us. Stalactites covered the ceiling. At least, that's what they looked like at first. They were either oddly round or square. Eventually a few in even more bizarre shapes like crosses and angels came into view of my flashlight. The stalactites weren't any sort of natural forming ones. They were gravestones jutting from the ceiling of the cave in a faux display of stalactites. 

This didn't make any sense. Upon quick glance they even had names and dates. But there was no possible way we were the first ever humans in this cave. 

“I’m not the only one seeing things?"" Kimberly asked the first to break the silence.

 We all exploded into conversation after that. It wasn't like we were even really speaking to each other but more of echoing each other's shocked statements. I personally, was muttering what the fuck under my breath. That's until my flashlight landed on one certain grave. I went silent. 

*Abel Jesterlyn Jan.23 1992 - August 2nd 2019* 

It was my brother's grave. What the fuck. I couldn't let the others see this. Did they somehow know and this was a bad prank? I would deserve the humiliation if true. I stumbled the furthest away I could from that particular grave. 

I was hoping for a cheerful word from Noah. Some way to turn the situation brighter than what it was. But Noah didn't crack any. 

“Let's go.” Noah sounded terrified. 

“We will keep going in. “ Richard said. “It's obvious the land owners had at least been this far in. So it should be safe to continue.” 

Noah looked to me like I was somehow supposed to object. I shrugged at him trying to make it seem like I didn't just see a replica of my brother's grave. I knew it couldn’t have been the old man I had met earlier. I wasn't going to say it out loud either, any possibility for the graves seemed illogical. 

“We'll stick together from how on.” Richard said. 

“Let's just follow the stream, it should be heading somewhere, right?” Nathan asked. 

Nathan was one of the only ones not disturbed by our findings. He probably checked the exits and our surroundings in better detail. While we were busy exploring the oddity and letting it get to our heads. I at least could praise him for being level headed. Even if I already found other aspects of his personality annoying. 

 “I checked there are three other exits to this chamber but two seem to be dead ends.” Nathan said. 

Nathan shouldn't have gone on without us. Being alone in a cave is dangerous. Although none of us complained. It meant we didn't have to waste our time and have to turn around back to this chamber.

Richard led us deeper into the cave. 

We were now in the twilight zone. I could hear the rushing of a bigger stream of water up ahead. Each step took us closer towards it. We would probably find the end of the little stream pretty soon if we kept on in our journey. ",1,1763718658.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

1p2ujpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Monitors/comments/1p2ujpt/best_laptop_screen_extender_for_work_travel/,Best Laptop Screen Extender for Work & Travel: Cevaton N2 Review,"I used to think ""laptop screen extenders"" were just optional tech gadgets—until I got my hands on the Cevaton N2. Turns out, it’s a total game-changer for office workers! With its 16-inch high-def screen and thoughtful design details, it solves every frustration of working on a tiny laptop display. Once you use it, you’ll never go back. I genuinely want to recommend it to anyone tired of endless tab-switching.

https://preview.redd.it/va4am9kwuk2g1.png?width=797&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b0a717f5cf60677adc3bc5cd13a67cc313feb93

Part 1: Working on a Small Screen Is Pure Torture

Before the N2, I struggled with my laptop’s tiny display every single day:

• When writing proposals, I’d have research tabs open on one side and my draft on the other—constantly hitting Alt+Tab to switch. Half the time, my train of thought would break, turning a 1-hour task into a 2-hour slog.

• Excel spreadsheets were a nightmare: too many columns to fit on the screen, so I’d scroll back and forth nonstop. My eyes would strain, and I’d often mix up data.

• Reading long documents like theses or contracts? The horizontal screen made text too small, and adjusting windows to vertical mode was a hassle. Hunching over the screen left my neck sore—even neck patches didn’t help.

I picked up the Cevaton N2 on a whim, and suddenly, all these headaches vanished. Working smoothly? It turns out it’s possible!

# Part 2: 16-Inch Big Screen + IPS Quality = Visual Bliss

The N2’s biggest surprise is its 16-inch screen—with a 16:10 golden aspect ratio, it’s way roomier than my 14-inch laptop. The visual space doubles instantly.

Now, when writing reports, I keep reference docs and spreadsheets on the N2, while focusing on typing on my laptop. No more tab-switching, just a steady workflow. I finish 1-hour tasks in 30 minutes flat. Excel is a breeze too—I can see two extra columns at once, no more scrolling, and data checks are faster and more accurate.

It also uses an IPS wide-viewing-angle panel with 45% NTSC color gamut. Colors are vibrant and true-to-life—whether I’m working on PPT charts or sneaking in a show during breaks, the画面never looks dull or distorted. The 300cd/㎡brightness is a lifesaver too. My desk is by a window, and even with direct afternoon sun, the screen doesn’t glare. Unlike my old extender, which turned washed-out in sunlight, I never have to rearrange my workspace.

# Part 3: Detail Lovers Rejoice! These Features Get Office Workers

The N2’s small details hit all the right notes—every design feels intentional and useful:

• The magnetic stand is amazing! Just snap the screen into place, and it’s secure. It rotates 360°, so I flip it to portrait mode for long docs—text is way bigger, no squinting. The height adjustment is smooth too; I hover it above my laptop, aligning both screens at eye level. No more hunching, even after hours of report-writing.

• Type-C one-cable connection is a game-changer! One cable handles both display and laptop charging. My desk used to be cluttered with chargers and wires, but now it’s neat and tidy—I even wanted to post a photo on social media.

• Storage is a breeze. The stand folds flat, and the screen detaches to fit into a protective case. At just 1.27kg, it slips into my backpack easily—perfect for occasional on-the-go work. The PC+ABS shell with Kevlar texture is tough too; I’ve used it for half a year, and there’s not a scratch on the edges. Way more durable than the cheap extender I had before.

# Part 4: Honest Experience: It’s Not ""Optional""—It’s a Necessity

At first, I thought ""I don’t *need* an extender."" But after six months with the N2, I realize: it’s not a nice-to-have—it’s something you can’t live without once you try it.

Now, the N2 is my go-to for proposals, spreadsheets, theses, and online meetings. My productivity is up by at least 30%, my neck doesn’t ache, and my eyes feel less strained. Several coworkers saw my dual-screen setup, asked for the link, and now they all say, ""I wish I bought one sooner—why did I suffer with a small screen for so long?""

If you’re an office worker stuck with a tiny laptop display, or a student who deals with long docs and spreadsheets, do yourself a favor and try the Cevaton N2. For just $129, you get doubled productivity and a more comfortable work experience. It’s way better than wasting money on coffee that’s gone in 10 minutes.

Oh, and one last win: it’s plug-and-play. No complicated drivers to install. I’m tech-illiterate—I don’t even know where to update graphics drivers—but I got it working in seconds.

If you’re tired of small-screen struggles, the Cevaton N2 is a lifesaver. Give it a shot!",1,1763718525.0,Monitors,1,1.0,False

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

1p2udlq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p2udlq,Skincare for KP,"Hi guys, this is my first time posting on this subreddit. Please be kind. 

I wanted to ask for some advice on routines or products that could help reduce my keratosis pilaris on my arms and back. I’ve had KP since I was around 11–12 (currently 26) and honestly never paid much attention to it, but lately I’ve been wanting to know what smooth skin even feels like because I don’t think I’ve ever experienced that (at least not in my conscious memory). My skin tone on the arms are also a bit patchy and I am not sure why. 

I have attached from photos here, forgive my very weird angles I was trying to do this on my own. 

What I’m currently doing:
-I use a regular body wash.
-I exfoliate with a basic coffee scrub once or twice a week, been doing it for a while now, maybe a year? 
-I shower at night because I wake up way too late to do anything but run to work.
-I’m not consistent with sunscreen on my arms since they’re usually covered.
-I was gifted the Paula’s Choice salicylic acid body lotion (purple tube) and the small SA toner. I use them, but the lotion feels greasy on my skin. I live in a very humid climate so I sweat easily and it sometimes causes small pimples under clothing. You can see the scars of a couple in the later photos where I sort of scratched my arms. Before that, I wouldn’t get pimples on my arms often unless I use some sort of greasy/heavy lotion. 
-To moisturise I currently use a light Nacific AHA/BHA toner because I read people with sweaty/oily skin may benefit from that if lotions or moisturizers are making you sweat. 

I haven’t really explored much skin care for KP yet so that’s why I would like to request if y’all have some suggestions or what worked for you. 

Can you recommend any non-greasy and effective alternatives to SA/AHA lotions/bodywashes/whatever else is there for KP, or other ingredients I could try? Also open to routine suggestions. I don’t have access to a derm where I live currently. ",5,1763717847.0,IndianSkincareAddicts,2,1.0,False

I had an ex who would drive me around when I needed it or when he felt like it, he would wait til my class ended in the parking lot or coffee shop while he works then have dinner. He bought me stuff and stayed at home with me some days of the week. He used booked us some trips and we usually drove around Pampanga or Tagaytay. 

We used to be okay not until my aunt died, he was with us so nadala pa namin sa hospital while he drove, on the day of her funeral, he came once when were setting it up but he didn’t come for the rest of the days with reasons na “sakit ulo ko”or “nakatulog ako after maglaro”. I let those slide not until the last day, I messaged him calmly pero nakalagay naman dun na “siguro alam mo naman na ginawa mo, bakit now ka pa magdadahilan when you know you should be here…” he was also close dun sa tita ko, he came late and lunch na lang and magliligpit. 

The following week, he also was indecisive in picking me up kasi naglaro siya and he wanted me to wait outside for him to pick me up na byahe around 1 hour. I didnt ask naman masundo kasi i can book my own angkas or grabe pero most ng sundo niya he was the one who insisted kaya pinagawayan namin to. 

The weekend after that, nasa outing kami with his married friends, and he still took the time to take me sa important school thing ko, I brought up marriage kasi we used to talk about it at the start of the relationship and I just saw how happy his married friends were. He got mad at me saying na hindi ko daw iniisip mga kapatid ko na nagpapaaral sakin, which clear naman sa kanila na I have plans 3-5yrs from now na magpakasal since I’m turning 30, hindi din daw ako pwede sa “okay” lang na wedding kasi i told him ayoko dati “cheap” wedding kasi capable naman ako and family ko, then the last is “hindi mo alam nakakapressure kasi yan sa lalake”. 

The week after that nagkaroon uli kami discussion, I opened up to him na baka sana kako pwede i-plan ahead nila inom nila ng friends niya kasi I also want to have planned dates with him na kami lang, then after that nagsabi siya na iinom sila. Which I told him na kakausap lang namin, if aalis siya, siya masaya, pano ako, and if magstay siya, di rin naman ako magiging masaya” pero sabi ko umalis na siya. Siya pumili magstay. 

The week after, he went with a different group of friends to Elyu and before that I saw their gc, “hanapan na ng babae si *bfs name*” then yung binili niyang flowers sinend niya sa gc with the tagline “investment”. Then when they were in elyu, nag vc siya and hinarap ako ng friend niya “maghiwalay na nga kayo”. He said “uy wag” then ended the call. 

Nung una binibiro ko pa “sabi friend mo hiwalay na tayo?” Sa chat. He didnt react, proceeded lang magupdate, then biniro ko uli “pero sabi friend mo single ka na?” Kasi ayoko siya awayin eh. Sabi niya “gusto mo patulan ko joke mo?” Thats when i said na hindi man lang niya ako dinefend and they didn’t respect the relationship, apparently him too. Ang sagot sakin “di ko ba dinefend” then the next day he came and when I told him nasaktan ako (i didnt shout or scream, i was teary eyed kasi sakit eh) he broke up with me. I tried to ask na wag, i begged na ayusin kasi yun lang naman ang issue, I just needed a simple sorry na nasaktan ako sa ginawa ng friends niya. His reason is fed up na raw siya and napagod. 

And i cant help but think, ano nagawa ko mali? Was i ungrateful? Was i asking too much?Mahirap ba hingin yun mga yun like respect, accountability, emotional support. It was only a 4 weeks since namatay tita ko nun and I don’t understand what changed. Sunod sunod na naging away and he left. It’s been a month since he discarded me. No communication, no sorry. Ako pa nagsorry kasi I really wanted to fix it.  

If you ask me ano nagawa ko for him, inaasikaso ko rin po siya especially when were together, physical hind po kulang, affection hindi rin po, pinagluluto ko po, pinaghahanda breakfast when he is with us, always present din po when he needs me or wants to see me. I think I gave what a gf could give naman. Not monetarily but all the care that I can. Hindi rin po ako bungangera pero direct po ako magcommunicate with no mura. No tampo words, just as is kung ano ginawa niya and how he should make it better.

I wish I hadn't bought into all the misinformation around them for so many years!!!,"I'm 38. Diagnosed this year. I've known for years that SOMETHING was not right but I avoided medical treatment because I just had this idea that ""all medication is bad, you'll just be worse off being dependent on meds."" This idea is so pervasive in the damn fitness podcast space, everyone wants to demonize ""big pharma"" and promote bullshit scams. 

I finally hit my breaking point earlier this year, went to a psychiatrist, and was diagnosed with ADHD. Makes total sense now looking back at my life. Executive dysfunction is the story of my life, and periods of hyperfocus are the only times I've been able to get anything done. 

My last few years, really post covid have just been a long brutal slog of basically never having dopamine in my brain. The habits I'd painstakingly built just weren't working. My workouts suffered greatly, meditation routine fell apart, ate so much more sugar and junk, wasn't able to get to sleep, couldn't stay off the internet/phone. 

That classic executive dysfunction where you'll waste your whole day on your phone and not even be able to watch movies or play video games and at least enjoy some leisure time.

# Been taking 10mg ritalin this week. WOW! The effects are so not what I was expecting, but exactly what I needed.

* Executive dysfunction is just gone. I can just do what I want to do without the hours long grueling process of ""just checking reddit one more time before I go workout"". I can simply move from task to task.
* And then when I'm done with my responsibilities I can just move to reading a book or playing a game. 
* I can READ ON MY PHONE FOR AN HOUR WITHOUT CLICKING OVER TO REDDIT!!!
* I was doing some bank paperwork and instead of getting frustrated, I just read the instructions! 
* My mind is so quiet. 
* I am tired and asleep by 10pm!!!! This is huge. I'm never tired at night. I always needed to listen to a podcast for 1-2 hours before falling asleep. Now I'm out! Best sleep ever.

This is all SO different than what I was expecting. I was expecting a rush of energy, euphoria, like I'd feel from a strong cup of coffee. I was expecting jittery energy, like coffee. Instead I'm calm, and focused, and my mind is quiet. I don't feel a rush of energy that MAKES me NEED to do anything.

Instead, I can just move through my to-do list. Amazing!

And all my old hard-fought habits are back and it's SO EASY. This week I've meditated for half an hour everyday. I've exercised, everyday. I have zero desire for sugar or junk food. I can check social media when I want now and not get stuck in it like I was before.

This morning it was 29 degrees outside and I just went outside and ran. It wasn't even a debate in my head. That's what I wanted to do, so I went and did it.

1p2ua4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/1p2ua4y/whats_your_best_motorcycle_riding_hack_post_a/,What's your best motorcycle riding hack? Post a picture of your bike :),"Well here are my cents:

1、Loosen your grip on the bars. You need enough to steer the bike, not choke the chicken. It’s going to lessen the possibility of the dreaded “tank slapper.” If you can’t flap your arms, you’re holding on too tight. Practice this in the straights. It will let you know exactly how much pressure you need to apply. Learn that feel. Intimately. Road imperfections and bumps won’t be nearly as jarring once you do.



**2、Non-latex gloves**. Throw a couple pairs in your pocket. You’ll barely notice them, but if it gets cold(er) during your ride, they’ll give at least 10–15 degrees of warmth to make it to where you’re going without numb fingers. (It’s also a much better solution that putting your hands on your exhaust pipe. *Yes, that will work in a pinch, but it also shortens the lifespan of your gloves and good ones aren’t cheap.*)



3、If you’re going to pass a semi/bus/large vehicle, wave a hand into the lane you plan to switch over into…it’s not much, but they’ll appreciate it and give you the requisite space to get your boogie on.  This helps in two ways—one, it helps to let them know where you intend to go, and it also lets you know that if you are *unable to do so*—don’t. They can’t stop half as fast as you can. If you don’t have time to perform this simple maneuver, don’t change lanes. You’ve been warned.



4、Carry a small repair kit. Don’t bring the entire garage, but just enough to tweak what you need to if trouble strikes.



5、Rain gear. Carry it, and at a minimum, rain pants. Rain sucks. Riding wet **and** cold is particularly miserable. If you’re wearing gear it’s at least water resistant. Leather works unless it’s a straight downpour. Again, I’m talking a few ounces of extra weight here and not much bulk.

6、Murdered out (all black) looks cool, but *try* make sure that you’re visible at all times. Whether you do that with colors that pop, reflective piping, strips, whatever. Make sure people **see** you. *I guarantee they’re not paying attention either way*, so the best bet for you is to make sure they do.



7、If filtering (moving to the front of traffic at a stop) is an available option, **do it**. It’s just a little more protection against someone slamming into the back of your bike.



8、Use your rear brake in slow-moving traffic. Yeah, I know they told you to do that in your MSF class (you **did** take it, *right*???) but it works wonders in stop-and-go/city traffic. Learn how to feather that rear brake and you’ll be glad you did. It even works on bikes that don’t have rider aids.

9、If you’re tired. Stop. Just stop. Grab a cup of coffee. Warm up (or cool off), relax, whatever you need to do. Drivers can afford (not really) a second or two of inattention, you cannot. Make it safely.

10、If you’re going to ride around with your visor up, know that insects will fly into your helmet. It’s definitely a thing. Be prepared.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events. The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

""Never, never, never give up."" The words echoed in my mind, a relentless epizeuxis that fueled the protagonist's journey against insurmountable odds. In the dystopian world I crafted, where hope was a rare commodity, the power of repetition became a beacon of resilience.

For a thousand words, I immersed myself in the protagonist's struggle, exploring the emotional depth of the epizeuxis as a mantra against despair. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry, a whispered promise that carried the weight of a shattered world on its shoulders.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

Amidst the rolling hills of Harmony Valley, where the soft hum of nature's symphony echoed through the meadows, a mysterious traveler arrived, bringing with them a melody that resonated with the delicate assonance of a forgotten tune. The townsfolk, captivated by the harmonious vibrations, felt an inexplicable connection to the stranger.

As I explored the narrative, the assonance became a musical thread weaving through the story, emphasizing the emotional cadence of the characters' experiences. The traveler's words, laced with vowel-rich verses, carried the echoes of a distant melody, leaving an indelible impression on the hearts of those who listened.

Through the lens of assonance, I delved into the subtle interplay of sounds that defined the atmosphere of Harmony Valley. The lyrical quality of the narrative mirrored the town's collective journey, where the resonance of shared moments and emotions harmonized with the traveler's enigmatic presence.

**Response to Prompt 7: Onomatopoeia**

In the bustling city of Metropolis, where the rhythm of urban life played out in a cacophony of sounds, a peculiar street performer emerged. Armed with an array of unconventional instruments, he orchestrated a symphony of onomatopoeic brilliance that echoed through the crowded streets.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars. The city, typically drowned in noise, became a canvas for this auditory artist.

As I delved into the story, the onomatopoeic symphony became a language of its own. The characters communicated through the vibrant echoes of everyday sounds, fostering a unique connection between the performer and the people of Metropolis. The narrative danced to the beat of onomatopoeic creativity, transforming the mundane into a dynamic celebration of city life.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed—a pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

As the narrative unfolded, the stark contrast between the city's cutting-edge architecture and the serene beauty of the Zen Garden became a metaphor for the characters' internal conflicts. The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

The story unfolded with the metonymy acting as a symbolic gateway into the complexities of governance. The Iron Throne Statement, while seemingly straightforward, carried the weight of a thousand debates, negotiations, and betrayals. Its impact rippled through the lives of citizens, shaping their destinies in ways they could scarcely fathom.

Through the lens of metonymy, I delved into the layers of meaning hidden within this political shorthand. The characters grappled not only with the literal implications of the Iron Throne Statement but also with the overarching themes of power, ambition, and the sacrifices demanded by political gamesmanship.

**Response to Prompt 24: Understatement**

In the picturesque town of Serenity Springs, where the days flowed like a lazy river and the nights were adorned with a blanket of stars, an unexpected event transpired—a subtle disruption that the locals described as ""just a minor hiccup."" Little did they know that this understatement concealed the unraveling of a cosmic anomaly.

The narrative unfolded with the charm of understatement, as the townsfolk continued their routines, blissfully unaware of the cosmic storm brewing beneath the surface. The serene descriptions of everyday life served as a stark contrast to the impending upheaval that threatened to reshape the very fabric of Serenity Springs.

Through the lens of understatement, I explored the characters' nonchalant reactions to the unfolding events. The once quiet river became a conduit for interdimensional travel, and the night sky, adorned with stars, transformed into a celestial canvas of possibilities. The charm of Serenity Springs became a poignant backdrop to the understated drama that unfolded, emphasizing the profound impact hidden within the simplicity of daily life.

**Response to Prompt 25: Cliché**

In the small town of Nostalgia Haven, where memories lingered like whispers in the wind, a peculiar phenomenon occurred—the resurgence of clichés. As the narrative unfolded, the once-endearing phrases like ""time heals all wounds"" and ""love conquers all"" took on a literal dimension, shaping the lives of the townsfolk in unexpected ways.

The story immersed itself in the world of clichés, where the seemingly predictable phrases became living entities with the power to alter reality. As characters grappled with the clichés that defined their lives, they discovered that beneath the familiarity lay profound truths and unexpected consequences.

Through the lens of cliché, I explored the characters' journey to navigate the clichéd landscapes of their existence. The town, once steeped in predictable routines, became a stage for the extraordinary. As clichés transformed into tangible forces, the residents of Nostalgia Haven embarked on a quest to unravel the mysteries hidden within the clichéd fabric of their reality.

**Response to Prompt 31: Epanalepsis**

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded introspection. As I embarked on the freewriting journey, the repetition of this existential inquiry became a rhythmic pulse, guiding the exploration of diverse

perspectives on life's purpose.

For a multitude of words, the epanalepsis led me through a kaleidoscope of reflections. From the philosophical musings of scholars to the simple yet profound revelations of everyday individuals, each recurrence of the question served as a gateway into the vast tapestry of human contemplation.

Through the epanalepsis, I navigated the labyrinth of existential ponderings, unveiling the unique responses that individuals had forged in their quests for meaning. The relentless repetition became a literary heartbeat, mirroring the universal rhythm of humanity's collective pursuit of purpose and significance.

The narrative wove through the lives of characters, each grappling with the epanaleptic inquiry in their unique ways. Whether seeking solace in the grandeur of the cosmos or finding meaning in the simplicity of a shared moment, the epanalepsis remained a constant companion, echoing the perennial quest for understanding.

**Response to Prompt 36: Anadiplosis**

In the futuristic city of Quantum Heights, where technology intertwined with daily life like a seamless dance, a viral message spread—a mantra that echoed through the cybernetic veins of the metropolis. ""Create the code, the code creates reality. Reality shapes destiny, and destiny is but the code.""

The story unfolded with the rhythmic cadence of anadiplosis, each line flowing into the next, creating a recursive loop of ideas. The mantra became the heartbeat of Quantum Heights, influencing the lives of its denizens as they navigated the intricate balance between the virtual and the tangible.

Through the lens of anadiplosis, I delved into the interconnectedness of code, reality, and destiny. The lines blurred as characters harnessed the power of programming to shape their fates. Quantum Heights, once a mere city, transformed into a living algorithm, where the repetition of the mantra echoed in every pulsating byte.

**Response to Prompt 38: Asyndeton**

In the dystopian city of Emberfall, where the remnants of a fallen civilization lay entwined with the shadows of despair, a lone figure emerged—a rebel determined to dismantle the oppressive regime. The narrative unfolded with the rapid pace of asyndeton, omitting conjunctions to mirror the urgency of the protagonist's quest.

Through a cascade of words, the asyndeton propelled the reader through the city's decaying alleyways and towering citadels, each sentence building upon the last. The disjointed rhythm captured the relentless momentum of the rebel's journey, emphasizing the magnitude of the challenges faced in their struggle for freedom.

As the narrative unfurled, the absence of conjunctions served as a narrative device, intensifying the sense of urgency and desperation that permeated Emberfall. The rebel's asyndetic odyssey unfolded against a backdrop of shattered hopes and whispered rebellions, culminating in a crescendo of defiance against the oppressive regime.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The mantra echoed in the desolate wasteland of Endless Sands, a barren landscape where hope was as scarce as water. Through the repetition of epizeuxis, the protagonist's internal resolve became a resounding anthem, a defiant roar against the relentless challenges of survival.

For a multitude of words, the relentless repetition of ""never"" served as a lifeline, propelling the protagonist through the harshest of environments. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry against the oppressive silence of Endless Sands, a declaration that reverberated across the vast expanse.

Through the lens of epizeuxis, I delved into the depths of the character's determination. The harsh environment became a character in itself, challenging the protagonist to defy the odds with unwavering persistence. The echoes of ""never"" transformed into a symbol of resilience, a beacon of hope that cut through the desolation of Endless Sands.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
**Response to Prompt 50: Acrostic**

Amidst the starlit expanse of Cosmos Haven, where galaxies danced in celestial choreography, a cryptic prophecy emerged—a message written in the stars. As the narrative unfolded, I embarked on a cosmic journey guided by the acrostic hidden within the constellations.

For a cascade of words, the initial letters of key phrases illuminated the path of destiny for the characters. Each sentence unfolded with intention, revealing a hidden message that transcended the boundaries of time and space. The acrostic became a celestial guide, leading the protagonists through the intricate tapestry of their interconnected fates.

Through the lens of acrostic, I explored the cosmic forces that shaped the destinies of Cosmos Haven's inhabitants. The celestial bodies became storytellers, each constellation contributing a verse to the epic narrative written across the cosmos. As the characters deciphered the acrostic, they unraveled the mysteries of their existence, connecting the dots between the stars and their own profound journeys.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

Sunlight blasted through the window of a tiny bedroom. Steve quickly shot up off of his pillow, immediately realizing his alarm clock had failed to ring. It was one of those days he figured. He began to make breakfast just to find that his toaster oven, and coffee maker, were also not working. It had appeared that there was some type of electrical shortage. His breaker was fried. Turns out, there was a power outage around the whole city. He began his day and was rude, or at least short, to most of the people he ran into. He was drained. One of the people he encountered, Lan, was having a splendid day. So this rudeness was taken lightly, and transformed into an act of kindness. A city dog had crossed Lan’s path on her route home from work, weak and panting. Fortunately, Lan was on a hydration kick, so from her excessively sized water bottle, the dog drank, and Lan continued on. The dog then moved through the city until it came across a nice looking bush, and began to urinate, as dogs do. The night set in, and the bush couldn’t make sense of how it felt. It stayed up all night, and all of the next day thinking about what had just happened to it. In fact, the bush stayed up for the next several years, just thinking about the dog. Soon enough, the bush’s memory was all that remained of the dog, and the bush finally went to sleep. In the next day, Cat woke up and felt well rested.

He was used to it, but something told him it would be the last time that he would experience this. He started his day as usual and began his route to work. He took a train across town, and at the 3rd stop, a girl had gotten on the train. He watched as she stepped onto the train. She paused, and began to look for a seat. He gazed. He started at her feet, as his eyes made his way up to her knees. Then to her waist. Which was oddly shaped he had thought, but in a way that was, fine. Good. As she traversed the maze that was the seating arrangements of any train, in any city, Russ’ eyes sharpened.

15 July 2023

Here is the story how I met Bejoy.

So it happened Manali, I know one rider from Madhya Pradesh through Instagram. Bejoy happened to be his classmate in Bhopal. Bejoy’s native is in Alleppy Ambalappuza. Some how he ended up in Bhopal during his childhood.

They both were meeting in Manali on June 12th. Instagram rider agreed to meet me in Mall Road and there I met Bejoy. He happened to be a rider in Kerala. He also have plenty of knowledge about bicycles and coffee.

We exchanged numbers and I messaged him on the day I reached Ochira. That’s it Bejoy rode the next morning and we met at the rendezvous point at Amballappuza cross roads.

It was a memorable 40km marine drive ride. That short ride with him was in fact an important and much needed company that Kerala sent for me, on a day that I was in a low and discouraged mindset.

We had breakfast in the Breakfast Village beach house in Alleppy.  Bejoy hates if he is served with sugar coffee. His point is coffee with sugar is tasteless.

He inspired me in many ways, clarity, quality, and the way of his research. I do not want to end our meeting with just a thanks. Because someday we are gonna ride together on a rough and tough terrain.",8,1763717010.0,india_cycling,0,1.0,False

Am I being unreasonable to expect him to buy these?,"Me (22F) and my boyfriend (22M) have been together for nearly a year. He lives about a 45 minute drive from my house in a smaller seaside town. I live in a small city which has more nightlife, shops, and public transport etc. Since the start of our relationship he has usually travelled to my house to stay. He usually stays about 2 nights a week (weekends) but more recently I’d say 3-4 nights. I have stayed at his house, when we first started dating it was more often (still only once or twice a month) but over the past 5 months, I’d say it’s been about only every 2 and sometimes 3 months I stay. I enjoy staying but the past 2 times I’ve stayed I’ve had to ask him if we can stay at his for a change, he never asks me really. This is also due to different things we’ve had on like he was working abroad for 2 weeks and holidays etc. So we typically stay here as there’s more to do for dates etc, but a big factor of this is due to him usually having band practice and attending university in the city I live in. 

A few months ago we had a discussion about how I felt him staying on the nights when he had band practice was unreasonable (with the occasional one being understandable), 
as he is out from from 5-9pm so was just basically getting dinner and then sleeping, which he agreed to and arranged to stay at his dads in the city.

I find just the general ‘hosting’ responsibilities a bit tiring, I still like to clean up a bit before he comes, thinking about and cooking tea, buying groceries or little treats for us, doing laundry, having clean towels etc.. but I’ll go into a more detail about the specific things that bug me.

I usually cook us a meal, and I still live at home with my mum and siblings (I do pay board) so my mum will occasionally make us something or get a takeaway for us also. He used to often offer to make breakfast in the mornings, or dinner for us at night (which he’d buy the groceries for) but he honestly hasn’t been doing this for the last couple months either. Which upsets me in two ways, that it’s just me cooking, and because it was also something I liked about him when we started dating. Usually it’s myself or my mum have bought groceries that I use to make meals, although occasionally I will ask him to grab something from the shops (1 or 2 ingredients) and he is happy to do so but doesn’t offer much, although has offered in the past if I need anything.
He also does not offer to do the dishes (tbh as I live at home I don’t do them much myself but whenever I’m at his house I do offer). Even when I tell him we need to do the dishes he only dries! And I have to ask him! He also has made comments like ‘I’m the guest’ which he passes off as a joke but I honestly think he feels like that. 

Due to this, which may be wrong of me, is that I find myself expecting him to pay for other little bits here and there such as weekend coffees or lunch (not every weekend but maybe twice a month). Although I often find myself waiting for him to pay or just not offering to pay half, but I almost feel like he expects me to pay half or pay for it. I don’t offer to pay for it as I’ve cooked bought groceries etc. 

He does treat me to a nice dinner out every other month, and he always buys me flowers and will bring me cakes sometimes. Which I appreciate so much so I don’t want to seem ungrateful but I feel that is almost separate to this issue? Although I don’t take him out for dinner as a treat, but I do pay half most meals out and I will buy little treats. 

There are other little things he also does which I think is why it has built up so much, such as leaving his laundry for me to do when he goes home (and the one time I left one pair of pyjamas at his house he asked me if I wanted him to wash it? Like obviously). He also uses my shower gel which is fine, but he expects me to replace it when it runs out. E.g. he uses shampoo and my brother don’t so there was an old men’s shampoo which I gave him. It run out and he was telling me almost complaining, so suggested he buys another shampoo then, and he still hasn’t. He also has a higher paying job (he’s worked hard for) than me and definitely doesn’t struggle for money as is always traveling and speaks about his savings for a house etc which I don’t have.

This has came up as recently we went on a weekend away with my family which he drove me and him too and we paid 50/50 for all meals etc and he paid extra for the petrol but he brought up the money he paid for petrol, although I bought us and extra coffee and paid for parking, and my mum also bought groceries etc and bought us a cake and coffee.

Aside from this my boyfriend is honestly lovely and wants to do the best by me but I feel he is just maybe not even thinking about all the little things I do and how it could get to me. We get on really well but I think we may have a difference in how we see finances and expectations. I think that we both live at home could also come into it. I’ve not been in a long term relationship like this before so I’m worried that I’m being too harsh about this situation and I don’t know how to bring it up. Maybe I am also more upset about it as I don’t have as much money as him. I’m also aware I’m more sensitive than most people so wanted to check in before I bring things up to him. I feel like I’m almost analyzing everything, and I’m really struggling to not be too much. I also still want him to feel comfortable and at home here, I don’t want him to be walking in egg shells or feel uncomfortable.

What should I say to him and how should I approach this without offending him or making him feel bad, or being to over the top?

What would your expectations be?

I also want to mention when we got together only 3 months after he broke up from his ex (of 3 years), which I find to soon and openly told him this however saying that I do believe he is over his ex. She also lived in my city and I’m starting to wonder if this is maybe why he wanted a girlfriend again due to convenience but honestly I think that’s just my overthinking and a bit of a stretch.

TL;DR: My boyfriend stays at my house 2-3 nights a week, and I have to cook the meals,  pay for groceries, do his laundry and do the dishes. We both stay at home with our mums and siblings. He doesn’t do much to help and I feel it’s not fair. He also sometimes just stays when it’s convenient to him and we’ve spoke about this before. I stay at his house every 2-3 months and he doesn’t invite me there much but I would like to stay there more. The last few times I’ve stayed is only because I’ve asked.

No friends nothing. Since I did not had many friends , I always wanted to explore new places  but every time I found myself searching the same question 'is this place safe to go', should I visit there alone, is there sufficient lightning , how safe is for women etc. I tried asking my seniors, all answers were just based on 'vibes' and everyone gave different answers.

I noticed this was not the case with me, but almost all students who travel for studies. Google reviews are just too generic telling how good coffee is. Why can't we rate places based on safety ? People post there experience but they got buried in some large communities. Picture perfect places are sometimes not really that 'perfect'.

So to solve this me and my friend started building a product called 'Safe or Not', very simple product just type in the location and boom you get everything at one place I said above!

So, I just wanted your feedback, we are not perfect, started this a month ago!

Freelance gigs have been covering rent but I miss having an actual team and surprisingly even the Slack noise lol.. I tried applying before but it has become really unorganized and I have lost track of them.

This morning I made coffee, opened my laptop, created a spreadsheet to track applications and forced myself to apply to five jobs. I cleaned up my files and inbox, rebuilt my portfolio with the recent projects I made and researched further companies on job sites like LinkedIn, Glassdoor, JobCat, etc.. It sounds small but seeing a little progress again made things feel less like shouting into a void.

Im not expecting quick results. I just want the next month to feel like momentum again. I also prepared a weekly to-do list so I could measure my progress.. Id appreciate some thoughts or suggestions TIA

I'm walking along Long Reef Beach, it's hot, the waves are crashing, coffee in hand from a thermos. And then I see: two steps from the water, a normal golf course. People in flip-flops and T-shirts are calmly hitting the ball, and all around is the same ocean and sunset.  
  
I thought, ""Is this some kind of joke?"" Turns out, it's not. I simply went to https://longreefgolfclub.com.au/, asked, ""Can beginners come?"" They gave me clubs to rent, and within 10 minutes I was swinging a driver overlooking the waves. No membership, no white pants and ties-just come and play.  
  
For me, who in Europe only knew golf as a ""rich guy's sport,"" this was absolutely wow. I played 9 holes, lost 4 shots, but had an incredible time.

1p2tukt,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIREUK/comments/1p2tukt/today_i_woke_up_without_an_alarm/,Today I woke up without an alarm,"Today I woke up without an alarm. After a long slog in a career that never excited me (56m) but certainly stressed me, yesterday was my last day. A little bit of back story. 5 years ago I was made redundant from a public sector job (good payoff) and got divorced (she got the house, I got to keep my pension). I’ve worked the last 5 years on contracts earning good money. My final role put me on the Board of a major public body as an interim, and convinced me that I did not want that level of stress. They were keen for me to apply for the permanent role but I knew that was not the right thing for me. I’m done with corporate life. I saw out my contract, handed over to the new guy, gave in my laptop, collected assorted gifts and headed off into the sunset.



I’m not going to talk about my numbers too much because they’re not really relevant. I’ve worked them through a thousand times to convince myself it can work, and it can. I live modestly and have enough. I’ve had this in mind throughout the last 5 years and have been saving substantially into SIPP, ISA and retaining profits in my Ltd company. My original plan was to go at 60, but I’m ready now.



I have enough retained profit in my company to continue to pay myself the same amount as I am now for 18 months, maybe 24 if I adjust down a bit. I then have a SIPP that I can access which is augmented by a DB pension that kicks in at 60. Full state pension at 67. Crucially the DB + SP will be enough to live on modestly so that’s a permanent inflation-proof income stream.



Funnily enough, continuing to receive income from my Ltd company is making the transition easier psychologically. I still have a ‘salary’, this is still money that I have earned, the same as the income I received last month. I don’t feel retired this morning, just freer. A huge weight has lifted.



Everyone at work has been asking what I am doing next, where my next job is. That’s the standard thing that you ask. I’ve just said that the first thing I’m going to do is take some time out, and then in the new year focus in on my coaching work, look at some Non-Exec Director roles, maybe do some advisory stuff, but nothing full time. I might volunteer or work in a bar/coffee shop. I shall see. All those are options but crucially they are optional. I have the freedom to choose.



This isn’t retirement, it’s a reboot. The start of new stage which is based around what I want, not what work wants. I feel great.

**Food:** I ordered the **lamb burger** — solid choice. Juicy, flavourful, and genuinely enjoyable. Would order again.  
**Ambience:** Nice vibes overall. Good lighting, pleasant atmosphere… the kind of place that *looks* great when you walk in.  
**Seating:** This is where it dipped for me. The seating wasn’t very comfortable. Either the chairs or the layout just felt off. Not ideal if you're planning to sit for a while.  
**Service:** Just okay. Not rude, not great — somewhere in the middle. Could definitely be a bit more attentive.

# Overall:

Theo’s is worth visiting for the **coffee and burger**, and the ambience is pretty solid too. If they improve the seating and service a bit, it could easily be a top-tier café experience.

1p2ttma,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1p2ttma/aitah_for_getting_my_ex_arrested_after_he_crashed/,"AITAH for getting my ex arrested after he crashed my brother's wedding drunk, even though he was just trying to apologize for cheating on me on our anniversary?","My boyfriend stood me up for our anniversary dinner because he turned off his phone to have dinner with his ex, then when I confronted him he admitted they slept together, so after I dumped him he showed up drunk at my brother's wedding.



We'd been together for two years. Our anniversary was last month and I made reservations at this nice Italian place we'd been talking about going to for months. I confirmed with him three times that week that we were still on for Saturday at seven.



Saturday comes and I get to the restaurant. I text him that I'm there. No response. I wait twenty minutes. Nothing. I call him and it goes straight to voicemail. I'm sitting there looking like an idiot while the hostess keeps asking if my party is coming.



After an hour I left. I was furious and worried something happened to him. I drove to his apartment and his car was there. I knocked on the door, no answer. I used my key and let myself in. Empty. His phone was on the counter, turned off.



I sat in my car and waited. Around ten thirty he pulls up in an Uber. With his ex. They're laughing and she's touching his arm. I got out of my car and he saw me and his face went white.



I said ""Where the hell have you been?"" His ex looked between us and said ""Oh. I should go."" She walked away quickly. My boyfriend said ""Babe, I can explain."" I said ""You turned off your phone and missed our anniversary dinner to hang out with your ex?""



He said they ran into each other at the coffee shop earlier that day and decided to catch up over dinner, that he lost track of time and forgot about our plans. I said ""You forgot our anniversary?"" He said it technically wasn't our exact anniversary, that was Tuesday, so it wasn't that big of a deal.



I asked why his ex was at his apartment. He said he was just giving her a ride home but she needed to use the bathroom first. I said ""Her Uber dropped you both off here."" He stammered and said okay fine, they were going to watch a movie.



I asked him point blank if he slept with her. He said no. I stared at him and said ""Tell me the truth right now or we're done."" He broke down and admitted they'd hooked up earlier that evening before dinner.



I took off the necklace he'd given me for my birthday and threw it at him. I told him we were over and to never contact me again. He tried to grab my arm and said it was a mistake, that he still loved me, that his ex meant nothing. I got in my car and left.



He spent the next two weeks blowing up my phone from different numbers because I kept blocking him. He'd show up at my work. He sent flowers to my house with notes saying he was sorry and wanted another chance. My friends told me he was messaging them asking them to convince me to talk to him.



Then came my brother's wedding three weeks ago. It was a big wedding, two hundred people, really beautiful venue. I was a bridesmaid. I specifically made sure my ex wasn't invited and told security at the venue his name just in case.



Halfway through the reception I'm at my table when I hear yelling. My ex is at the entrance arguing with security. He's clearly drunk, stumbling, shouting my name. My brother sees what's happening and goes over there. My ex starts yelling about how I ruined his life, how I won't talk to him, how I'm being dramatic about one mistake.



My brother tells him to leave. My ex tries to push past him to get inside. Security grabs him and my ex takes a swing at one of them. He misses because he's so drunk but that's assault. The cops were called. My ex is still yelling my name, saying he loves me, causing this massive scene.



The police arrested him. He spent the night in jail. But the damage was done. My brother's wedding got disrupted, people were recording it on their phones, my sister in law was crying because her special day got ruined.



Now my ex's friends are messaging me saying I'm heartless, that he was just trying to apologize and I got him arrested. His mom called me saying her son made one mistake and I'm destroying his life, that I should drop the charges and give him another chance. Some of my own relatives are saying I should've just talked to him privately before the wedding so he wouldn't have felt desperate enough to show up.



But I did nothing wrong. He cheated on me on our anniversary after I sat alone at a restaurant for an hour. I broke up with him and he turned into a stalker. I didn't tell him to crash my brother's wedding drunk and try to fight security.



My brother says it's fine and he doesn't blame me but I can tell my sister in law is upset. My parents think I should've handled the breakup differently somehow so he wouldn't have escalated like this. Was I supposed to give him closure or something? Did I make this worse by ignoring him?",4,1763715680.0,FoundandExpose,3,0.83,False

1p2tqrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/InterntionalTendors/comments/1p2tqrg/the_turning_point_how_a_businessman_found_his/,The Turning Point:  How a Businessman Found His Path to Growth," Rajiv was a man of numbers , disciplined, determined, and endlessly hopeful. For ten years, he had been running his mid-sized electrical equipment company. The first few years were golden; local projects flowed in, his team expanded, and confidence soared.

But as the market became crowded, growth slowed. New competitors emerged overnight, undercutting prices and winning deals that Rajiv once took for granted. By 2022, he found himself sitting in his office late one night, staring at the sales chart that refused to climb.

“Maybe this is it,” he thought. “Maybe my business has hit its limit.”

The next morning, over coffee, he overheard two entrepreneurs discussing something unusual  *government tenders.* One of them mentioned how global procurement projects were helping small and medium businesses secure long-term contracts. The other talked about a website called[**TendersOnTime**](https://www.tendersontime.com/how-it-works/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) a global platform listing tender opportunities from over 240 countries.

Rajiv had never heard of it. Curiosity took over. That evening, he explored the site and discovered something remarkable governments, agencies, and corporations were posting **tens of thousands of tenders daily**, seeking everything from IT services to electrical equipment like his. It wasn’t about luck; it was about access.

He registered, set up his alerts, and within days, opportunities started flooding his inbox. Projects from Kenya, the UAE, and even small municipalities in Europe matched his products. One tender a government electrification project caught his attention. It felt far beyond his reach, but he decided to try.

With clear documentation, detailed guidelines, and examples of previous contract awards available on TendersOnTime, Rajiv carefully crafted his proposal. Weeks later, he received an email that changed everything: **“Your bid has been accepted.”**

It wasn’t just a win  it was a turning point. That contract opened doors to new regions, built credibility, and restored his faith in global possibilities.

Today, Rajiv often tells his peers, *“The opportunities were always there  I just wasn’t looking in the right place.”*

Sometimes, growth doesn’t come from reinventing your business; it comes from **finding the right platform that connects you to the world**.

And for many modern businessmen, that platform is quietly, effectively  **TendersOnTime**.

1p2tmve,https://i.redd.it/uzn29spfpk2g1.jpeg,How to build a journaling habit,"Look, I’ve started and abandoned more journals than I care to admit. The bullet journal people, the morning pages cult, the “write 3 pages every day or you’re a failure” crowd – all of it made me feel like shit when I inevitably dropped the ball.

So I stripped it down to the absolute dumbest, laziest version possible and… it’s working. Going on for 15+ years now without missing a day :)

Here’s the dead-simple system I wish someone had slapped me with years prior:

1. **Start small** \- One or two sentences. That’s it. If you feel like writing more, cool. If not, you’re done. No guilt.
2. **Set a routine** \- Attach it to something you already do every single day. I do mine right after I plug in my phone at night. Zero brainpower required.
3. **Be authentic** \- This is private. No pretty prose, no life lessons for your future biographer. Write the ugly truth, the petty shit, the “I hate everyone today” rants. No filter.
4. **Experiment & enjoy** \- Some days I just voice-note while walking the dog. Some days I drop a photo and one line. Some days I use a prompt. Make it feel like play, not homework.

That’s literally all there is to it.

Starting stupidly small killed the perfectionism that was murdering every attempt. The habit grew on its own once the pressure was gone.

* Promo runs **Sept 15–Nov 30, 2025**
* You need to **register first** (this is the step most people miss!) - can be done via SMS, eGC Hub, or Oh My Deals! App
* Minimum spend per transaction: **₱1,000 straight**
* Three spend tiers = up to **₱5,000 eGCs**
* You can earn **bonus eGCs** through category spending + installment purchases
   * Up to ₱1,000 for BPI Visa Signature
   * Up to ₱600 for BPI Amore and Amore Platinum
* Excluded spend? Yep—mobile wallet cash-ins, cash advances, gambling, etc.

What I love most?  
You can redeem your eGCs from LOTS of brands: Shopee, Lazada, Mercury Drug, H&M, Abenson, Bo’s Coffee, GrabFood, S&R, and more.

Personally, I prefer to have my rewards as cash. To do so, I choose ShopeePay under Services when I redeem my eGCs. Rewards are claimed in ₱500 denominations and each transaction comes with a ₱15 charge. The fees add up, but I'm fine with it, I guess. 🤷‍♀️

Ok onto my issue. For almost 5 years now I’ve had “ibs” caused by an overuse of antibiotics, I was given far too many antibiotics which destroyed my stomach and led to where I am now. basically I eat any sort of food and my body has differing responses to it.

I eat:

Carrot/cucumber = stomach pain
Coffee = diarrhoea
Toast = Chest pain and muscle tightness and lethargy.

I’m relegated to basically chicken and rice for almost the past 6 months. Obviously I eat other things like salmon and such, but chicken and rice is unfortunately my bread and butter. 

Due to this I went to see my gp who referred me to a gastrologist, on a report that for the past few years when I do a blood test my liver lfts are “deranged” they are slightly “abnormal”

I waited 4 months for a gastrologist appointment. Fast forward to yesterday. I had the appointment to which I mentioned my issues, and was promptly told I have anxiety and to go deal with it.

I’m now completely lost as to what to do. 

I do have anxiety but it IS caused by my stomach, if I eat the wrong food I get a physical response that results in anxiety.

My main question to this sub or the doctors within it. Is what the hell do I do?

I have plans to setup a psychiatrist to deal with my anxiety issues, but I’m still absolutely no closer to dealing with my stomach issues that are frankly ruining my life. My stomach issues cause me such stress that I find it hard to leave the house sometimes.

Most doctors when I visit them, just write me off as anxietal and never actually help me. I just need actual help. I have a stomach problem and I don’t think anybody is taking me seriously for it. I’m at my wits end. Any help would be appreciated. ",0,1763714250.0,AskDocs,1,0.5,False

1p2tdsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_creativeorion/comments/1p2tdsk/logo_design_trends_to_watch_in_2025/,Logo Design Trends to Watch in 2025,"The world of branding keeps changing, and 2025 is bringing fresh, bold, and creative logo design styles. Whether you are a startup or an established brand, keeping up with trends helps you stay relevant and modern. A professional **logo design company in India** closely studies these trends to create designs that match today’s market expectations. Let us explore the top logo design trends that will shape 2025 in a simple and easy way.



# 1. Minimalism With Meaning

Minimalist designs have been popular for years, and in 2025, this trend will become even more powerful. Brands now prefer simple logos that are clean, clear, and easy to recognise. But minimalism is no longer just about removing details — it is about keeping only what truly matters.

A clean design improves readability, looks great on digital screens, and works well across different marketing materials.



# 2. Dynamic and Motion Logos

As video content dominates the internet, dynamic or animated logos are becoming essential. Instead of a static image, many brands now use motion-based logos for:

* Social media
* Websites
* App interfaces
* Digital ads

These motion logos make brands look modern and engaging. A skilled **logo design company in India** can create smooth, creative animations while keeping the core identity intact.



# 3. Retro and Vintage Comeback

Old-school designs are making a big return in 2025. Vintage fonts, classic badges, and warm color palettes remind people of authenticity and trust. This trend works perfectly for:

* Coffee shops
* Clothing brands
* Handmade product businesses
* Local stores

Retro-styled logos bring nostalgia while still feeling stylish in the current era.



# 4. Bold Typography

Typography-focused logos are rising in popularity. Brands want their name to speak loudly and confidently. In 2025, expect to see:

* Thick, bold font styles
* Customized lettering
* Geometric shapes inside letters
* Playful typography

This trend works great for brands that want a strong, powerful identity.



# 5. Gradient and Neon Color Effects

Gradients are becoming more vibrant, energetic, and futuristic. Using multiple shades adds depth and makes logos visually appealing. Many brands are also using neon-like colors to look young, exciting, and innovative.

This trend is popular among tech companies, entertainment brands, and lifestyle businesses.



# 6. Nature-Inspired Organic Logos

Sustainability is becoming a major priority worldwide, and brands want to reflect that. In 2025, expect more:

* Leaf-inspired symbols
* Earthy colors
* Soft, rounded shapes
* Eco-friendly themes

These logos build trust and connect with nature-loving customers.



# 7. 3D Logos with Modern Depth

3D designs are leveling up with soft shadows, smooth gradients, and realistic textures. They help logos look premium, detailed, and future-ready.

This trend works especially well for digital platforms, tech brands, and gaming companies.



# 8. Custom Illustrations and Hand-Drawn Styles

Hand-drawn logos bring uniqueness and personality. Instead of using ready-made icons, brands now prefer custom illustrations that reflect their story.

This trend makes the brand feel friendly, artistic, and original.



# 9. Adaptive Responsive Logos

With so many screen sizes today — mobile, tablet, desktop, smart watch — logos must fit everywhere. Responsive logos automatically adjust by:

* Simplifying the design
* Changing size
* Removing extra elements

A professional [logo design company in India](https://creativeorion.com/logo-designing-company-in-india/) ensures the logo looks perfect on every platform without losing identity.



# Conclusion

Logo design in 2025 is all about clarity, creativity, and connection. Brands want designs that look modern, express personality, and work on every platform. Whether it’s bold fonts, motion graphics, minimal styles, or retro inspiration, these trends help businesses stay ahead.

If you want a fresh, trend-ready identity, choosing the right **logo design company in India** can give your brand the modern and memorable logo it deserves.",1,1763713944.0,u_creativeorion,0,1.0,False
1p2tdax,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelRelated/comments/1p2tdax/how_i_actually_find_travel_buddies_online_as_a/,How I actually find travel buddies online as a solo traveller (guide + real talk),"I travel solo a lot, but I do not always *want* to be alone. Sometimes I want someone to split a rental car with, hike a trail that feels safer in a pair, or just have a mate to laugh with when the train goes in the wrong direction. 😅

The problem: trying to find travel buddies online can feel like a mix of dating app energy, dodgy DMs, and people who say “let’s travel!” then vanish the day before you meet. So I wrote a full guide on how to do it in a way that is actually safe, realistic and respectful of your solo time.

Here is the short version.

# Where I actually find people

I mix a few different things rather than relying on one magic app:

* Travel buddy / backpacker apps and hostel apps with built-in chat
* Couchsurfing-style events and hangouts
* Facebook groups for solo travellers, digital nomads, destination-specific communities
* Reddit (r/solotravel vibes) for date/location posts and low-key meetups
* Meetup-style platforms for hikes, language exchanges, board games, coworking
* Small group tours, walking tours and day trips as “low-risk” ways to meet people

I treat all of these as *filters*, not guarantees. The platform just gets people in front of you - you still need to read the vibe.

# What I put in my posts/profile

Being vague attracts chaos. Being specific attracts people who travel how you do. I include:

* Rough dates and where I am heading
* Budget level (hostel vs mid-range vs “let us treat ourselves”)
* Pace: early starts vs lazy mornings
* What I actually enjoy (museums? hikes? food? nightlife?)
* Clear non-negotiables (no heavy partying, no sharing a room with strangers, etc.)

Stuff like:

>

Way better than “anyone in Europe?”

# Safety things I actually do

I am not perfect, but I have a few hard rules now:

* Video call at least once before meeting
* First meetup is short and in a busy public place (coffee, free walking tour, hostel bar)
* I keep my own room and my own booking until I properly trust someone
* I never send money, deposits or card details to a stranger “booking for both of us”
* A friend at home has my rough plans and I check in with them

If my stomach tightens when I read a message, that is a “no”, not something I talk myself out of.

# Matching travel style so you do not hate each other

The fastest way to turn a promising buddy into a nightmare is to skip the “how do you actually travel?” chat. I always ask:

* What does “budget” mean to you in numbers?
* Are you happy with hostels or do you prefer private rooms?
* How many hours walking is normal in your day?
* What do evenings usually look like for you? Bars? Netflix? Late nights?
* How much alone time do you usually want?

If someone will not talk about this stuff, I do not plan anything big with them.

# Using tours, events and classes as friend-finders

I have met some of my favourite travel friends on:

* Free walking tours
* Group hikes / day trips
* Cooking classes
* Language exchanges
* Hostel bar quizzes or games nights

I treat the activity as the “safety net”. If the social vibe is weird, I still got a tour/hike/class out of it. If the vibe is good, we grab food or plan something for the next day.

# For introverts & anxious solo travellers

You do not need to turn into the hostel extrovert who talks to everyone. My introvert-friendly tweaks:

* One small meetup every few days, not daily
* One-to-one coffee or a walk, not huge bar crawls
* Single rooms when I can afford them, to recharge properly
* Being honest in my profile: “I like chill hangs, I might leave early if I am tired”

Weirdly, being open about that has helped me find people who feel the same.

# When it goes wrong

It *will* be awkward sometimes. People are flakier than they sound online, and occasionally someone is just rude, drunk or intense. My rules now:

* I always have a backup plan I am genuinely happy to do alone
* I give myself permission to say “I am heading off, enjoy the rest of your trip” and leave
* I block/report people who push my boundaries
* I treat it as a lesson, not proof I should never meet anyone again

The aim is not to avoid all weirdness forever. The aim is to avoid situations that are unsafe, and stop the annoying ones ruining your whole trip.

# Full guide if you want the details

I put everything into a long-form guide on my blog, including:

* Example profile wording
* Green flag vs red flag table
* Extra safety ideas
* Thoughts on group tours, apps and local events
* Gentle tips for introverts

1p2tc86,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1p2tc86/poker_face/,Poker Face,"Class 2-A’s dorm living room was quiet one early weekend evening. This occurrence was rather rare. As Katsuki Bakugo had once so eloquently put it, UA’s hell class didn’t know how to shut the ever-loving fuck up. Tonight was the first weekend of the month, which meant poker night. Now, 2-A never bet money. Hell, most of them rarely had the fiscal responsibility to rub ten yen together any given week. No, the stakes were much, much higher. 

The couch and chairs had been pushed away and the dining table had been made the living room’s sole piece of furniture alongside the array of chairs from dining to desk arranged around it. The teenagers were all elbow to elbow around it with a few looking on further back, drinks in hand. The center of the table was piled high with snacks. Boxes and bags of local, luxury, and foreign snack foods. Salty, sweet and savory, with a few sticky notes to account for the bets that were of the frozen variety. 

Only two players still remained this hand. Everyone else having long since folded or cashed out, or just opted not to play. Iida looked between the pair nervously. He never played, calling gambling uncouth behavior ill befitting the honorable men and women of the prestigious hero academy. So he was relegated to dealer as he was both too honest, and clumsy to be any kind of danger to the game. It was also a role he took deadly seriously if his little green card cap was any indication. 

From either end of the table Momo Yoayarozu and Izuku Midoriya met each other’s neutral gazes with the steely sort of resolve that buzzed electric between them. Normally poker nights weren’t met with such a rapt audience or even ended between this sort of struggle. Yet for the last twenty minutes Class 2-A’s vice rep and its freckle cheeked cinnamon roll dueled to the metaphoric death with strategic bets, expert bluffs and steely poker faces. 

On a normal poker night Momo often walked away with a sizable amount of snackage. She wasn’t a shark by any means, but it was well known by now that her poker face was unbeatable. She had no tells, no ticks. Simply put Momo could tell you the sun was silver and the sky green under a cloudless day without batting an eye. By now the game would be winding down and she’d be collecting her small sugary fortune while graciously doling out some of her winnings to the losers. Tonight saw her patience tested and her magnanimous victory stymied. 

Izuku’s bright green eyes glinted over his cards, a small pile of snacks at his side. He’d come in like a hurricane, wrecking the delicate ecosystem of 2-A’s poker night. He arranged his cards, and seemed to consider them before pushing a bag of watermelon fruit snacks forward. Someone sucked in their breath. Momo loved watermelon. His uncharastic smirk eben had the audacity to unnerve, and even excite her a little. 

“Raising One snack.” He regarded her with that innocent gaze that set her teeth on edge. 

Momo’s eyes flicked down to her cards. She had a pair of queens and an ace. Her eyes met his, still staring unimpeded. 

“Call.” She pushed a bag of mexican candy, mango suckers dusted with some spicy mixture over them. They’d been added to her haul courtesy of Sero who watched with his arms folded nearby. 

“You better fucking win this hand Izuku!” Bakugou screeched from nearby. 

“Shush!” Denki and Kirishima muttered batting at the blonde from either side of him. All three and the whole room seemed to lean forward collectively. 

Momo’s eye almost twitched. Even the blonde himself was in attendance, forgoing his strict sleep schedule, watching with everyone else. He was also the cruel architect of this particular nightmare. You see, Izuku Midoriya was both frugal and utterly devoted to his diet. He never ate overly sugary food and kept to his routine of high in vitamin and protein meals. What little snacks he ate were dried fruits and vegetable chips. Needless to say he never had anything anyone would want, nor would he likely eat anything offered in turn if he won. 

He often acted as Uruaka’s or Bakugou’s cheerleader. 

Imagine everyone’s surprise when he asked to be dealt in with snacks he’d never eat himself but a certain blonde would happily scarf down. Bakugou rarely lasted more than a few hands. He bet big and lacked any semblance of a poker face. Sure he got lucky, but Momo learned quickly when to halt her bets when that happened. She was rather shocked he’d allow his rival turned friend to play for him, acting as a proxy. It would seem everyone underestimated his desire to win and his craftiness to see it happen. Worse, the blonde bombshell had some All Might figurine in its pristine packaging in his lap. It crinkled suggestively, and Izuku offered Bakugo a rare glare before flicking back to Momo. 

“Well darn,” he hissed. “I think you may have me.” Momo almost felt her heart soar. He set his cards down and the table gasped while her stomach plummeted to her fuzzy panda slippers. “I mean unless you can beat a full house.” 

Two kings, three aces stared up at her. Her poker face broke to abject despair. Bakugou began cackling and spinning in his chair like a man possessed. The reatvof the room either cheered, oooohed, or patted Momo’s shoulders sympathetically. Momo schooled her expression l, set the cards down and nodded. She stood and offered the green bean a handshake which he accepted, albeit with a sheepish look. Bakugo took his opportunity to look at “his” winnings while sliding the toy over. Midoriya slyly took a firm hold of it. 

“It was a good game Midoriya,” she said honestly. “That has to be the first time since junior high I was met with such a worthy opponent.”

“Thanks Yoamomo,” he thanked with a small smile. “Umm sorry.”

She waved off his apology. “It was fun, I mean it.” 

The green haired boy picked up the watermelon snacks. Despite the “Hey” from Baguko, Midoriya handed them over. “I won’t eat them and Kaachan doesn’t like them. I had fun too!”  

“You really don’t have to. You won the fair and square.”

“It’s really okay,” he said. “I want you to have them. Sides Given how close you were to thrashing me the entire game I think you earned them.” 

“Oi we had a deal Izuku!” Bakugou growled, to which Midoriya promptly ignored. 

“Oh take the snacks Yoamomo,” Jirou chimed, looking at the exchange like she would a kitten playing with string. “Green’s bold enough to invite Bakugou’s ass kicking to flirt with ya.”

Izuku went red while the girls and Denki and Yuga all went “Ooooh”. 

Momo took the snacks, only glaring briefly at her friend and smiled at him. “Thank you.” She was a little red in the cheeks. 

The next day Momo found herself up early, despite her best efforts to induce a food coma. Sunday mornings were dead as their classmates slept in or hit the gym. Golden sunlight filtered from the kitchen windows as Momo enjoyed a rare moment of quiet with a contended sigh. She’d donned an eggshell blue overlarge sweater and a pair of old leggings. She warmed her hands with a hot cup of coffee utterly drowned in sugar and cream. It was then Midoriya walked in from his morning run. He was sweaty and only panting slightly. 

“Oh good morning Yoayarozu,” he said with a little surprise. “How did you sleep?” 

“Quite well thank you,” she said. “Would you like some coffee?” 

Midoriya shook his head. “No thank you. Caffeine makes me jittery.” They lapsed into awkward silence before he started toward the showers. “I’m gonna go get cleaned up. Umm good morning again.” 

She nodded. After a bit of fussing with her sleeves she stood and started getting the skillet down and the eggs out of the ice box. When Midoriya returned, clean of sweat and his fluffy green hair slightly damp she waved at him. Momo rolled her eyes at the shirt that had ‘pants’ printed across it he wore, his idea of humorous clothing. 

“I hope you don’t mind. I took the liberty of cooking.” She hadn’t made a mistake but simply wished to return his kindness from the night before. 

“Oh that’s umm-“ he stuttered out. 

She met it with a warm smile. “I know I didn’t have to but I haven’t had breakfast yet and I kept to your strict meal schedule. Call it payment for the watermelon snacks.”

She’d cooked with lean fish, some eggs and some plain rice. It was a simple meal and respected Midoriya’s diet. While Momo was no Bakugou or Sato in the kitchen she could manage simple things. Nothing like the hopeless case she was when they’d first moved into the dorms. Bakugou and Sati still looked either nervous or annoyed when she so much as opened the ice box. 

“Well umm thank you,” Midoriya said with a beaming smile. “I’ll get the plates down and then.” 

He set about getting the dishes ready and setting the table. Soon they were tucking into a simple but nice breakfast together. She rather enjoyed the comfortable silence but something had made her curious. 

""I have to ask,” she said. “Where did you learn to bluff like that?”

Her question caught him off guard. Midoriya choked on a piece of fish and managed to stymie his coughing fit with a drink of his orange juice. 

“Umm kinda just…” he trailed off. She grew concerned at his silence before he sighed. “It’s a skill I picked up during childhood. I was… bullied pretty badly growing up. Sometimes the best way to deal with it was to ignore it, not let them know I was bothered.” 

Momo’s eyes widened. “I’m so-“

“Don’t,” Midoriya interrupted, perhaps a little harsher than he meant. He winced. “Sorry, but it’s fine now. I’ve put it behind me and things are better now. A lot better. I’ve made peace with it and…” He trailed off again. “It’s just fine.” 

Momo saw him in a little bit of a new light. She always knew he’d been strong, had seen it first hand in the war, but now she saw the quiet dignity she’d all but missed. He stood and started picking up his dishes. “Thank you for the meal Yaoyorozu.” He quickly cleaned up and left her to her thoughts.

In August 2024 I met this man. He was just visiting my hometown on holiday but we struck up a nice and deep convo from the moment we matched on the app, followed by some more conversations and flirting and then the day before was to leave to go back home (different country) we decided to meet for coffee. We had so many topics to talk over we joked we'd need 600+ cups. We spent some 9 hours together,.mostly walking and talking, last three heavily making out in my car. 

We kept in touch, first messaging each other almost non stop,  for hours every day including countless voice notes and some phone calls.  From day 1 I wasn't naive, I didn't wanna get into something that had no chance of developing due to distance. I expressed that to him, knowing I tend to attach quickly when the connection is so deep and fulfilling but he acknowledged th distance issue but also wanted to give it a chance. Besides it was way to early to talk about any real relationship since we barely knew each other after 1 week, right?

But the connection deepened and I can't describe it as anything than absolutely magical- intellectual and emotional resonance, same energy matching, sense of humour, conversations never losing the flow, and sexual chemistry off the charts - he said it was special and he hadn't experienced such depth in a very very long time. And also expressed that i  as different and rare and he just couldn't even believe I was real. And he wasn't love bombing, that's not the type, he was sincere in what he said. And I never looked for him for validation, for me it felt very healthy, organic, natural bond and my affection for him grew. We inspired each other for growth and to be better people. We challenged each other sharing our individual world views and it was just the deepest, most special and fulfilling connection I had ever experienced in my 30 years. He imprinted himself deeply on me.

This went on for about two months, although at the end of September the intensity on his side lessened a bit and we would still talk for 2-3 hours at a time but sometimes with two days of no talking in between. He said he was busy with work but I could also tell he was not as romantic as in the beginning when he would talk about coming back, potentially even moving to my country with us being the top reason for that. 

I think he quietly made his decision sometime in mid autumn that distance was too much for him.i know it was an issue for him from the beginning because he said so openly but also considered a relationship for some time until he decided against it. Still, we kept in touch, and then as we made plans (I was supposed to visit him in his country since it was also where I was going for holiday) I could already tell it'll probably end there with us meeting one final time. 

Earlier, we said we'd have a conversation about ""us"" when we met but somehow when I expressed how I felt, he was a bit evasive, a bit unclear but also happy to talk in person and said we were probably both on the same page. Fast forward to early November (three months since we first matched on the app and met) we (he) ended things. He said he couldn't do long distance. But he also said he wasn't ready to say goodbyes and asked me to stay close friends since the bond was so important and meaningful to him. I could tell he was hurt by his reaction when I said I couldn't stay just friends after all we shared (sex and romance were a big part of our connection, too though it was only a ""tip of something much deeper""- his words in one of our final messages.

He respected my request for a clean break and we didn't say a word till late January. He sent me Xmas message, I sent him birthday message in early January and then we met in person again as I was in his hometown again (not for him but because I was already making plans to move there regardless) . We spent some 7 hours together again, talking in a bar till 2-3am and I could tell he still held some affection for me by how attentive and even a little flirty he was. He then asked me again to stay close friends. We then had a phone call when things turned very emotional because he told me in a light way about his dating life and that he slept with one girl during his business trip and I know it was while we were still involved,in mid October, before we had the in person conversation about ""us"".

 It broke me so much and the emotional talk caused all my romantic feelings for him to resurface. We spoke for some two hours and he turned defensive but then very sweet and caring and we ended on a cordial note, saying our final goodbyes since it was clear we couldn't stay in touch given how much I felt for him which he only seemed to realise the depth of then. I know he felt something real for me too, he almost used a word ""love"" once in a message back in early autumn but he also told me in that last conversation that he had to put his feelings aside and he just couldn't do long distance (it was before I  visited his country- Italy and made plans to actually move there which could have been a game changer). 

Anyway, it was very clear in late January that while he still held affection for me, he had romantically detached. Fast forward to late May (we didn't speak in between), he messaged me on my birthday with a very heartfelt, long message saying I was very special and he wishes me every happiness and that this year was very meaningful and important to him because of what we shared. And that he'll always carry the memories.

 I responded shortly and then followed up sharing something from my life. We talked politely for a day or two, exchanging several messages and he seemed genuinely curious and even happy to hear more from me but we were also both guarded and I didn't shared my plans of moving in detail,and overall I was a bit cold (to protect myself). In reality I'd love to have continued the conversation but he took a few hours between his responses (even if they seemed warm and more than detached one liners) so I figured he wasn't too much into this and when the topic exhausted itself, I just liked his last message when he wished me well again and that was it. It hurt me so much because I still loved him but what was the use of staying in touch? Especially since I wasn't sure he wanted to, even as friends anymore

I had also unfollowed him on social media, and then in September removed him from my followers too, since he was still following me. 

Anyways, a few days ago, still haunted by the memory of what we shared and how irreaplacable it was (and I dated and slept with some men since but and talked to like a 50 or 100 on the apps but nothing even scratched the surface of what I shared with him) I decided that at least I'll see if he still feels some warmth for what we both shared and be open to being friends or just reconnecting briefly, especially since I have since moved to close to where he lives (Rome, if you have to know). I messaged him, not to reignite anything romantically but just to see if he still considers our bond as something special and we could at least talk again, deeply about life and all, as we used to. So I sent a short message saying that I know a long time has passed but I just wanted to say 'hi"". And I told him to feel free to respond or not.
And I genuinely meant that. And I also wanted to stop living in hope and get final clarity if there was anything left. 
Well, he didn't answer. And it cracked me open, the indifference. There's no other explanation for that but that he just doesn't feel anything anymore, not even a flicker of warmth of nostalgia for what he said was so rare and special and went way beyond the surface and physical attraction (and trust me, we were so into each other). His words again.

I guess I have the clarity I needed to finally close this chapter for good but nothing ever hurt me. I didn't get into details but I was never so heartbroken in my life (and I'm 30).  I couldn't eat and sleep for days and weeks, couldn't focus on reading or watching TV for months. And I was so whole and not desperate for a relationship when I met him, I wasn't even sure I wanted to get into one when we met. I just felt so connected and intrigued talking to him I decided to meet him in his person and it all followed from there. I have a very full life, meaningful job, my move to a new country alone took my focus off him for a while, learning a new language, making friends, I have rich inner life, hobbies and I am comfortable being alone.

But I just can't stop grieving this. It feels so endless and the worst is that I really loved him and love him still though he also hurt me more than anyone every had. It seemed to me we were both in this together, and then he quietly withdrew at some point and I was left carrying it all myself and now I'm reeling from the imbalance because whatever he felt for me, was temporary while my feelings for him remain, in the pure sense, too, because even though I cried buckets and went through emotional pain I never thought was even possible, I still at my core, wish him well and want him to be genuinely happy. 

As one song says 'I was a footprint in the snow to you, the snow left and you left too. To me you were a footprint in wet concrete and it solidified on me"".

I'm scared I'll never stop loving him, even the  thought of becoming indifferent hurts because it was so meaningful to me and so transformative to me personally. Nobody ever touched me that deep and left such a deep and lasting mark. It's as if he reached past my skin and nerves and left his fingerprints imprinted into my bones. 

In many ways the acute pain has lost its edge and turned more into a dull ache and quiet missing him. I still cry every now and then but I also live my life and I'm excited for the future. But my heart still holds space only for him. I know the wound will close eventually, maybe in another year but what if I'll always carry a piece of him and never open up and experience what I had with him with anyone else? :(

The previous heartbreak I went through (and I loved the guy) lasted some 3-4 months but this is different. The most all encompassing, mature,  exciting in every way (oh my gosh, the sex part..) electric but simultaneously safe connection that felt like home in my life. I never tried hard, put on any mask, I sent him makeup-less selfies from day one, never tried to be someone he might like, I was fully myself with him and I felt so seen. And he said he was safe and free to be fully himself, too. It was like we mirrored parts of each other. Of course I felt anxious when he first pulled away but I never chased him and just readjusted my own investment accordingly. I was not even aware of the depth of my feelings till it came to an end.

What to do? How to move forward? I'm 30, I'd like to have a family someday and yet my time is running out and I'm not even in space to date seriously again, Im afraid I won't stop loving him and I'm emotionally unavailable to others now. And I can't even imagine this magic again on all levels again , it was so rare, and we both recognised it. Can you expect for the lightning to strike twice in a lifetime?

-

I feel like I've arrived at my last hurdle with my relationship with video games. I didn't play any for about 3-ish months and read, no joke, 23 books (and then some as there were a few I didn't like so I dropped them, and some I started then decided I actually wanted to read another series first). I quite literally had never felt better. I was eating perfectly, getting set up to switch over what language I was learning as I finally found one that really clicked with me, finding shows to occasionally watch in said language to help me with pronunciations, getting back into history, getting back into drawing while considering getting back into writing, had a good exercise schedule... then bam. I was scrolling one day and found a write up about two characters from a game that had this incredible backstory that I absolutely wanted to see play out. I wasn't consciously quitting video games, it just happened on its own, so I had no issue with downloading a free game and seeing how these character stories played out while keeping sessions relegated to days off like I always in my adult life.

If you know anything about gacha game stories, then you already know what I had to find out the hard way: it is not rare that they give you just enough to be interested in these characters only for the vast majority of their stories to be hidden in random item descriptions, especially if it's a dynamic between two characters. I started playing only to realize this was the case, and the two of them were maybe on screen together in about 3-4ish scenes even after this last update. So, I dropped it. About six times now.

It is way too easy to install the game, reactivate your account or make a new one. People telling others to just uninstall have no idea how hard it is to leave it like that when you have a budding addiction (if not a full-blown one) and it's insanely easy to get your source back. I delete the account, I spend all the pulls on there beforehand, I delete the email it's attached to, but it's so incredibly easy to reactivate all of that.

The main issues for me are wanting to see if they actually do something with those characters as well as the gameplay loop lighting up that part of my brain that sees the shiny rewards and feels good. On one hand, you can tell the artists and writers put so much thought into those character stories. On the other, it's all stuck in item descriptions and notes in a game that wants you to care about an overarching story that is primarily word salad with little emotional impact because it has to introduce multiple new characters every patch so they can make more money, ensuring no one gets properly fleshed out. As for the gameplay, I only enjoy it in short bursts, yet the way things are structured, the game can easily keep me there for 10+ hours (I am not proud to admit this) because of how it's structured, having me come out of it not enjoying even half of the time spent.

What prompted me to type this up was a couple days ago, I spent money on it for the first time. It was only $11, so not horrible by any means, but it still hit me hard when it sunk in. My justification the whole time had been it was (in my opinion) extremely easy to be free to play for main story content, yet I went and spent money because I wanted to get more pulls on a banner I didn't even care about. I was aiming for one of the other five stars you could get if you lost the 50/50, and I didn't even get him. I actually ""won"" each 50/50. There's something really funny about that, honestly.

Even worse, I want to re-download it and play again, but I know the moment I do, I'm going to get bored or irritated whenever I have to enter combat or read the insane amout of filler text about the larger story I've convinced myself I'm TOTALLY interested in (spoiler: I'm not. Because I started the game for two characters I found out were barely relevant). It's also really difficult for me because one of the characters I want to see looks like he's about to be relevant to the story again and it got leaked that he's getting a new banner likely early next year, so that's making it even harder to quit because my brain is going nuts, thinking, ""!!! Maybe there will finally be some amount of payoff for these two!!!"" even though these games are specifically designed for there to be no true payoff! Only just enough to keep you going! And I know this!

I don't know what to do. I sat here and typed all this negative stuff about the game, talked about how upset I am over spending $11 on it, yet all talking about it did was make me want to re-download it more. Even worse, the email I deleted isn't able to be recovered, the email with the game I spent money on, and I still want to just make a new one and do it all over again. I feel like I'm nuts. No game has ever done this to me, and I've been playing games for as long as I can remember. I could binge play games for absurd amounts of time, but it didn't need to be a constant thing. It was a fun thing to do on a day off without it interfering with other things I wanted/needed to do on those days. I treated it like you'd treat eating at a restaurant. It was a treat. Gacha games, however, are not designed to be a treat.

My current strategy is to tell myself since I have no upcoming characters I care about to wait to see if the character I like actually does become relevant in the coming updates before I jump at the chance to make a new account. My hopes are I'll get over it in that time. I get the feeling he probably won't actually be relevant (and am kind of hoping he won't be for my own sanity lol), so hopefully that last blow will make it click with my brain that it's time to move on, and when I do, I'm never playing another game. In the meantime, I'll be doing everything I can to keep myself away from news/videos/art/etc. of the game to limit cravings. I also plan on starting a series I DESPERATELY want to read in the hopes my brain will remember how good it feels to actually get a payoff in a coherent story.

I'm not looking for a fix, I know I'm the only one who can fix what I did to my brain after innocently downloading a silly little game, but I just want to feel some kind of solidarity. Has anyone else kicked their gacha game(s)? I knew they had a reputation for being addicting, but I don't normally fall into things like that. The fact I did opened my eyes to just how crazy addictive they are. They really do give you just enough to string you along while somehow managing to do the same thing with every demographic. It's insane.

I think a lot of people (me included) assume that bad sleep is just part of life stress, screens, too
much coffee, whatever. And yeah, that’s part of it. But your actual sleep setup plays a way
bigger role than most of us realize.
If you're waking up tired, sore, or just not rested, it might not be you, it might be your bed quietly
ruining your life. Here’s a breakdown of the main things I’ve found are worth rethinking if you're
trying to actually feel rested when you wake up.
1. Mattress: Your Foundation Is Probably Lying to You
If your mattress is more than 7–10 years old, sags in the middle, or makes your back sore?
That’s your first red flag. You don’t have to go luxury but you do need something that supports
your spine and doesn’t overheat.
Why it matters: Your spine alignment during sleep affects everything back pain, shoulder
tension, even how deeply you stay asleep.
Options to check out:
* Zinus Green Tea: budget memory foam option that works surprisingly well if you're
upgrading from an old spring mattress.
* EGO White Memory Foam Mattress: good mid range pick that doesn’t trap heat and
has a balanced, medium firm feel.
* Avocado Green: if you want something more eco conscious with natural latex.
2. Pillow: The Unsung Hero of Neck Pain (or Relief)
The pillow you sleep on affects your neck, shoulders, and even jaw. If your pillow goes flat,
bunches up, or forces your head into a weird angle, it’s going to mess with your sleep no matter
how good your mattress is.
Why it matters: Proper neck alignment = deeper sleep, fewer headaches, and not waking up
feeling like you got hit with a frying pan.
One that gets recommended a lot:
[Honeydew Classic Scrumptious
Pillow](https://d1vsa0evaa8kw9.cloudfront.net/?q=DXMM1131) : This one comes up
constantly in sleep threads, and for good reason. It’s designed specifically with back and
stomach sleepers in mind, which already narrows the field (most pillows tend to favor
side sleepers). The fill is a cooling copper gel blend, and what makes it stand out is that
it’s fully adjustable you can remove or shift the fill to get the height just right for your neck
and sleeping position.It’s not cheap but people who’ve tried a bunch of options and still
struggle with neck pain or waking up uncomfortable tend to land on this one as a long
term fix. The shape is also slightly curved which helps keep your head and spine aligned
if you sleep flat or switch positions during the night. Doesn’t hurt that it comes with a
matching pillowcase that actually fits it properly too (rarely the case with oddly shaped
pillows). (linked it cos its from a small business so you might have trouble finding it)
3. Bedding & Sheets: Breathability Over Thread Count
You don’t need 1,000 thread count sheets. You do need sheets that let your body breathe and
regulate heat. If you wake up sweaty or tangled, it’s probably not just you your sheets may be
trapping heat or sticking too much.
Why it matters: Your body needs to cool slightly to enter deep sleep. Overheating literally pulls
you out of it.
Things that work well:
* Brooklinen Classic Percale Sheets: crisp, breathable
* Quince Linen Sheets: slightly more textured, good airflow
4. Duvet/Comforter: Heavier Isn’t Always Better
Lots of people use thick duvets or comforters that are better suited to winter camping than
actual sleep. Look for something temperature regulating and seasonally appropriate.
Why it matters: Like sheets, your comforter plays a huge role in whether you overheat or sleep
comfortably through the night.
Popular picks:
* Buffy Breeze: lightweight and cooling
* Down Alternative Comforter by Utopia: budget-friendly and washable
* Weighted blanket : not for everyone, but some people swear by it for calming anxiety
and improving sleep quality
5. Mattress Topper (If You’re Not Replacing the Whole Mattress)
If a new mattress isn’t in the budget, a topper can actually make a big difference in support and
comfort especially if your current mattress is too firm or too soft.
Why it matters: It's the fastest fix if your bed is actively working against you.
Solid options:
* Viscosoft Foam Topper: adds plushness and reduces pressure
* Lucid lavender Infused Topper: budget-friendly with cooling features
Final Thoughts
None of these things are magic fixes on their own, but they add up. If you’ve never paid
attention to your bedding setup before, starting with any one of these can make a bigger
difference than you’d expect. I didn’t think I’d care about sleep gear now. I kind of want to give
my past self a shake for just accepting bad sleep for so long.
