1l14zwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1l14zwu/rebirth_protocol_bk1_ch_1_blood_memory/,Rebirth Protocol - Bk1 Ch. 1 - Blood + Memory,"Nick Valiente stumbled through the dim alleyway, the rough burn of cheap whiskey lingering on his tongue, his pulse a jagged beat in his ears. Neon lights from distant clubs painted murky rainbows over wet pavement, colors smudged by the drizzle. The city's noise felt distant, a dull roar muffled by the betrayal that still churned raw in his gut.

*And isn't that just perfect?* Nick thought bitterly. *One moment you're the golden boy with the perfect girlfriend, and the next you're the idiot stumbling through piss-scented alleys.*

Every time he blinked, the image seared into his mind resurfaced: Sarah, tangled in the sheets with Matt, his so-called best friend.

Earlier that evening, he'd finished class early, a rare occurrence. Eager to surprise her, he had practically jogged to her apartment. Instead, the surprise had been his. The weight of their actions settled deep, carving out something raw and jagged inside him.

Nick stumbled, numbness wrestling with fury as he navigated the alleyway. It smelled of urine and rot, darkness punctuated by the flickering neon signs of nearby bars. Each step was heavier than the last, grief and anger slowing him, numbing the ache.

A sharp pain erupted in his side, sudden and brutal.

The blade slid between his ribs with a sickening wet sound, cold metal transforming instantly to white-hot agony. His breath caught, eyes wide as he staggered back. A hooded figure, little more than a shadow, twisted the knife free from Nick's torso with a nauseating squelch, sending him sprawling into a filthy brick wall that scraped his palms raw.

His legs gave way, the world spinning and shifting, blood hot and slick between desperate fingers. Its copper tang filled his mouth, his heartbeat thundering in his ears like a distant storm.

His vision blurred, the alley tilting, his senses dulling. His body trembled, the creeping cold gnawing at his limbs, starting at his fingertips and climbing steadily toward his core.

*So this is how it ends?* he thought, a strange calm settling over him despite the panic. *Not in battle, not fighting for something meaningful—but alone, bleeding out in a filthy alley, a victim of chance.*

His breath grew shallow, each inhale a struggle against the weight crushing his chest. Darkness crowded the edges of his vision, like ink spilling across paper. His mind drifted, slipping beyond the pain, beyond the present. And then—weightlessness. Suspended in a vast, endless void.

A light beckoned in the distance, warm and inviting, pulsing with energies he somehow recognized yet couldn't name. It would be easy to follow. To let go.

But then—memories. A flood of them, crashing into him like a tidal wave.

Not just his life as Nick Valiente, but another. A warrior's life.

*Arlize Dentragon.*

The greatest swordsman and techno-magician of the Aurilia Empire.

The memories of Arlize Dentragon cascaded through him—a life lived centuries ago in another world. A master swordsman, a gifted magician who could channel arcane energies through crystalline conductors embedded in his blade. He could feel the weight of Arlize's enchanted sword in his hand, the cool metal humming with stored power, ready to unleash devastation at the briefest touch of his will.

He recalled precise incantations that could manipulate the elements—formulas and equations as much as spells, the perfect fusion of mathematical precision and arcane power. He remembered creating glowing sigils in the air that burned with blue-white intensity, runes that obeyed the same laws as complex circuit diagrams.

And he remembered the faces of friends who had plunged daggers into his back during the Great Aurilian War. Their duplicity had been calculated, precise—just like the mana-tech that had defined their civilization.

But how? Why did he remember a life from what seemed like a fantasy world? The connection felt impossible yet undeniable—the same soul experiencing being double-crossed across different planes of existence.

Nick struggled to make sense of it all. Was Arlize just a character from a game he had once played? A story he had read? Yet the memories felt too real, too detailed to be fiction. He recalled the sensation of channeling magic through his fingertips, the precise mathematical formulas that governed the flow of mana through techno-arcane constructs, remembered the exact moment Arlize had discovered his lover and his general plotting his demise.

The treachery. The battle. The moment of death.

Perhaps he was hallucinating, his dying mind creating elaborate fantasies. Or perhaps... perhaps there was a connection he couldn't yet understand. If he had been given a second chance after Arlize's death, was he now being given a third after Nick's?

Whatever the truth, one thing was clear—this cycle of betrayal had to end.

The faces of those who had turned against him. The sting of treachery ran deep in both lives, two fates cruelly intertwined. Rage surged through him, shattering the numbness.

*No.*

*Not again.*

Nick gritted his teeth, forcing himself to stay, to resist the pull of the void. He would not walk into the light. He would not accept another bitter end.

If fate had denied him peace, then he would carve his own path.

A third chance.

This time, he would not be weak. This time, no one would betray him. This time—he would take control of his own destiny.

The void trembled, the darkness shifting. Something was changing.

Nick Valiente, Arlize Dentragon—whoever he was—opened his eyes.

Sunlight filtered through the blinds, casting soft patterns across the dorm room walls. His body jolted upright, heart hammering in his chest. His hands gripped the sheets, solid and real beneath his touch.

He knew this place.

Heart racing as he sat up sharply, clutching his unharmed abdomen in disbelief. Everything was exactly as he remembered: his freshman dorm, textbooks neatly stacked, his laptop sitting idle.

Nick reached for his phone on the nightstand, clicking it on with trembling fingers. The date glared back at him: August 24, 2026. Freshman orientation day. His gaze darted to the wall calendar with its red circle around today's date and ""FIRST DAY"" written in his own handwriting.

He exhaled sharply. Two years. He had two years before that fateful night in the alley.

He stood, moving slowly to the mirror. A younger reflection stared back—eighteen years old, tousled brown curls, sharp green eyes, rich brown skin, allmarks of his mixed Black and Colombian heritage. He was back, two years before the bitter end, memories from two lifetimes intact and vivid.

*Two years before my death. Two years to change everything.*

""Unbelievable,"" he whispered, flexing his fingers. For a moment, he swore he saw a faint blue shimmer tracing the lines of his palm—the same cerulean glow that had surrounded Arlize's hands when channeling mana through tech-enhanced weapons.

Nick frowned, concentrating. He tried to recall the sensation of drawing power from within, the mathematical formulas that Arlize had used to shape raw magical energy into precise, devastating effects. He focused on his palm, imagining energy flowing from his core, down his arm, and—

A tiny spark, no larger than a firefly, flickered briefly in his palm before vanishing.

Nick staggered back, his heart racing. ""Holy shit,"" he whispered, staring at his hand. It had worked. It had actually *worked*.

His mind raced. If he could access even a fraction of Arlize's abilities in this world, the implications were staggering. But he needed to be smart about this. Careful. Methodical.

*One step at a time,* he thought. *Master the basics, then build. Just like training with a new weapon.*

The opening ceremony would begin soon. He dressed quickly, his mind sharper than it had ever been. He would no longer be the fool, the so-called 'stupid jock' they had mocked behind his back. No, now, he would be the top of his class. He would rise to become valedictorian.

And if his suspicions were correct—if he could truly wield Arlize's techno-magical abilities in this world—he would become something far more.

The path ahead was clear. He wouldn't waste a second. He had a second chance—and he would seize it with everything he had.

The university's grand auditorium hummed with restless energy as students poured in, their excited chatter filling the air. Rows of polished wooden seats stretched toward the towering stage, where faculty members sat in a practiced formation, their faces a mix of authority and detachment.

Nick slouched in the back, arms crossed, watching it all unfold with quiet detachment. The constant buzz of smartphones and tablets around him triggered a memory of Arlize's world—where communication devices had been embedded with mana crystals, allowing instantaneous connection across vast distances.

*Different tech, same principle,* he thought, eyeing a student's glowing phone. *I wonder if modern electronics could be enhanced the same way...*

He recognized the expressions on the faces around him—wide-eyed freshmen, brimming with optimism, oblivious to the trials ahead. He had been one of them once. Hopeful. Naive.

*Look at them,* he thought with a sardonic smile. *All excited for 'the best years of their lives.' If they only knew how quickly it all goes to hell.*

Sarah and Matt were somewhere in the crowd. He wasn't ready to see them. Not yet. Not until he had a plan.

The chancellor took the stage, delivering the same speech Nick had heard before—platitudes about ambition, seizing the future, carving one's own path.

*Carve your own path,* Nick thought bitterly. *More like get carved up in an alley while the people you trusted most betray you.*

He barely listened. His future wasn't something to be seized; it was something to be built, brick by brutal brick.

When the ceremony ended, the auditorium doors swung open, releasing a flood of students into the courtyard. They formed clusters, shaking hands, exchanging names they would likely forget by morning. Nick kept his head down, moving with purpose through the crowd. Socializing wasn't on his agenda. If he was going to dominate his classes, he needed to start now.

His dorm was a single-occupancy unit—quiet, no distractions. Just the way he wanted it. Tossing his backpack onto the bed, he pulled out the thick textbooks for his first classes and settled in at the desk. He had coasted through school before, relying on natural ability and charm. That wouldn't cut it this life.

Before diving into his studies, Nick stared at his palm, concentrating again on the sensation he'd felt earlier. Closing his eyes, he visualized the complex equations Arlize had used—formulas that combined mathematical precision with arcane principles.

*Let me see if I can...*

He traced a pattern in the air with his finger, a basic circuit design that Arlize had used for simple illumination spells. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, an azure line of light followed his fingertip, lasting only seconds before fading.

Nick's pulse quickened. There was definitely something there—a connection to abilities he shouldn't possess in this world. Abilities that might give him the edge he needed.

Hours passed, the world outside fading into irrelevance as he studied both his textbooks and experimented with small manifestations of his newfound power. Numbers and formulas blurred together, but he pressed on. Every problem solved, every concept mastered, and every small flicker of mana was another weapon in his arsenal.

A sharp knock on the door yanked him out of his focus.

Nick frowned. He hadn't ordered anything, and wasn't expecting anyone. He hesitated before standing and pulling the door open.

A tall red haired guy with glasses stood on the other side, hands shoved into his hoodie pockets. He looked relaxed, easygoing.

""Hey, I'm Jordan,"" he said with a grin. ""I live across the hall and figured I'd introduce myself. You're Nick, right?""

Nick studied him for a moment. Most people didn't go out of their way to meet their neighbors anymore.

""Yeah,"" he said, leaning against the doorframe, quickly assessing if Jordan could be useful to his plans or a potential threat.

""Cool,"" Jordan said. ""Just going around meeting people on the floor. Figured it'd be good to know who's around.""

Nick wasn't sure if he admired or distrusted that level of friendliness. But Jordan seemed harmless enough.

""Nice to meet you,"" Nick said, keeping his tone neutral.

Jordan nodded, then glanced past him into the room. ""AC/DC and Nirvana? Solid taste, man.""

Nick smirked. ""Better than half the crap people listen to these days. Though I'd bet good money you have no idea who pioneered that sound.""

Jordan chuckled. ""No argument there. Anyway, I'll let you get back to it. Just wanted to say hey.""

Nick watched as Jordan strolled back across the hall to his own room, closing the door behind him.

He turned back to his desk, gaze flicking to his schedule. His workload was stacked, but that was fine. He had time. Financially, he was covered for a few months, thanks to the trust fund his grandparents had set up. But that cushion wouldn't last.

Now, he had a plan.

He glanced at his palm once more, concentrating until the lines that danced across his skin.

Tomorrow, the real grind would begin.

Nick's alarm buzzed at 5:30 AM, cutting through the silence of his dorm like a blade. He inhaled deeply, pushing away the remnants of sleep. The old Nick would have snoozed the alarm until the last possible second.

He threw off the covers, stretched, and got dressed in athletic shorts and a hoodie. Before the campus had fully awakened, he was already at the gym, pushing his body to its limits. Strength, endurance, discipline—he would need them all. His past self had coasted on talent and youth. That version of him had failed. This time, he would build himself from the ground up.

Alone in the corner of the gym, Nick paused between sets, concentrating on a dumbbell. Drawing on Arlize's memories, he focused on the metal, attempting to sense its composition, its structure. For a moment, he swore he could see faint blue lines tracing the contours of the weight—quantum pathways that Arlize would have used to enhance weapons with mana.

*Interesting,* he thought. *The principles of mana-tech seem to apply here too. Different world, same underlying principles.*

By 7 AM, he was back in his dorm, showered, and seated at his desk, reviewing notes for his first classes. Biology 101, Calculus B, Statistics, and Intro to Business—the core of his academic journey. The old Nick had struggled with math, leaning on others to help him through. That wouldn't happen again. He would master it himself.

A knock on his door pulled him from his focus. He glanced at the clock—7:45 AM.

""Yeah?"" he called out.

The door cracked open, and Jordan peeked in. ""Dude, do you ever sleep?""

Nick smirked. ""Not when there's work to do. Sleep is just evolution's way of making sure we don't accomplish too much in one day.""

Jordan stepped inside, rubbing his eyes. ""I was going to ask if you wanted to grab breakfast before class, but it looks like you're already in overdrive.""

Nick considered it for a second. The last time he had gone through this, he had been too casual about forming connections. But isolation hadn't done him any favors either. Strategic alliances could be useful.

""Yeah, let's go,"" he said, closing his notebook.

The dining hall buzzed with the sounds of students waking up, some lively, others barely conscious. Nick grabbed a plate of eggs, toast, and fruit, opting for fuel over indulgence.

Jordan, still bleary-eyed, sipped at his coffee like it was his lifeline. ""So, what's your deal, man? You just built different?""

Nick chuckled. ""Something like that. Let's just say I've seen how this all plays out before. Not interested in repeating past mistakes.""

They found a table near the window, the campus coming to life outside. Jordan scrolled through his phone, then looked up. ""So, what classes you got?""

""Calc B, Bio 101, Stats, and Intro to Business,"" Nick answered between bites.

Jordan groaned. ""You're in my Calc and Stats classes. Guess I picked the wrong friend if I wanted to slack off.""

Nick grinned. ""Guess so. Though I might be able to help you pass if you're useful.""

As they finished up, Nick checked the time. *My first class starts in twenty minutes.*

""Gotta head out. First class is starting soon,"" he said, standing.

Jordan looked up with a mouth full of eggs and waved goodbye as Nick walked away.

Nick's schedule was structured to give his week balance. Mondays and Wednesdays were for Biology and Calculus, a demanding but logical pairing. Tuesdays and Thursdays were for Statistics and Intro to Business, focusing more on applied skills. This structure gave him enough time to master each subject properly while maintaining his routine.

Today was a Monday, meaning he had Biology first. The class was held in a sleek, modern lab with rows of long black tables. The professor, a middle-aged woman with a sharp gaze, launched straight into a lecture on cellular respiration.

As she described the intricate processes of energy transfer within cells, Nick found himself drawing parallels to the mana-tech systems of Arlize's world. The mitochondria's conversion of chemical energy reminded him of how crystalline mana conductors transformed raw magical energy into usable power.

*Same principles, different medium,* he thought, scribbling notes with new interest. *Energy conversion, pathway optimization, feedback loops—it's all connected.*

Nick absorbed every detail, writing down notes meticulously. The old him had never cared much for this subject, but now, every piece of knowledge felt like a weapon.

After Biology, he had a break before Calculus, so he grabbed lunch from the cafeteria. The dining hall was quieter than it had been during breakfast, with students scattered around eating or studying. He opted for grilled chicken, brown rice, and steamed vegetables—fuel that would keep him sharp for the rest of the day.

Once he finished eating, he headed to the campus library to review his notes before Calculus. Settling into a quiet corner, he opened his notebook and focused on cellular respiration, reinforcing what he had learned earlier.

Glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain—the three major steps of how cells generate energy. He sketched out diagrams of mitochondria, tracing the path of glucose as it was broken down, ATP molecules forming in the process.

Beside his notes, he carefully added another diagram—one that wouldn't make sense to anyone else. It showed the parallel structure of a mana circuit, the way Arlize would have designed it to channel and amplify magical energy. The similarities were striking.

The sheer efficiency of cellular respiration fascinated him. He had never given much thought to these details before, just memorizing enough to pass exams. Now, though, he found himself wanting to truly understand it. This knowledge was the foundation of biology, and he refused to be anything less than exceptional.

With Biology reviewed, he checked his email and saw a message from his Calculus professor. The subject line read: 'First Day Quiz – Be Prepared.' Skimming through, he saw that the professor expected them to have a basic understanding of limits and continuity and had attached a set of practice problems.

He turned to Calculus. Since the professor had emailed them in advance about the quiz, Nick wasn't caught off guard. It was meant to gauge where students stood, and he was determined to ace it. He worked through problems on limits and continuity, reinforcing his understanding of derivatives and their applications. He solved practice questions on differentiating functions and understanding rates of change, making sure he grasped the concepts before they were introduced in class.

*The old me would have panicked at this quiz,* he thought with a thin smile. *But now, it's just another step toward dominance.*

Heading to class, Nick arrived ten minutes early, finding a comfortable seat in the second row, directly in front of the professor's lectern. Calculus B was held in one of the expansive lecture halls designed to accommodate large groups of students, especially during the bustling first weeks of the semester.

As the clock moved closer to 2:00 PM, students trickled in, filling seats around him—some chatting excitedly, others groggy and barely awake.

At 1:58, Jordan walked into class, eyes half-closed and hair slightly disheveled. Spotting Nick, his expression brightened immediately, and he made his way over.

""Hey man,"" Jordan greeted, dropping his backpack heavily onto the floor and sliding into the seat beside Nick. ""How was your first class?""

""Good. Professor Godrudson is teaching my bio class, so it should be interesting,"" Nick replied, mentally comparing the chaos of students settling in to the disciplined ranks of mage-engineers at Arlize's academy.

Jordan chuckled. ""Lucky you. I'm glad I avoided bio this semester. But anyway, I'm guessing you're pretty organized since you picked a seat right up front.""

Nick shrugged. ""Just trying to pay attention. How about you? First class of the day?""

""Yeah, I'm not a morning person,"" Jordan admitted, rubbing his eyes.

Nick smirked. ""Yeah, I figured. You look like you just woke up, again. Though to be fair, consciousness is overrated in college. Some people graduate without ever achieving it.""

""Haha, hilarious,"" Jordan retorted with a playful eye-roll.

At exactly 2:00, the professor strode in, commanding attention immediately. He was a wiry man with sharp, alert eyes behind thick-rimmed glasses, giving him an appearance that hinted at a rigorous approach to teaching. Without much introduction, he began handing out quizzes.

""Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you've reviewed the pre-course material,"" he announced briskly. ""We're starting today with a quick diagnostic to gauge your grasp of foundational concepts.""

Jordan groaned quietly, casting a worried glance at Nick.

Nick quickly dove into the test, writing methodically. As he worked through complex derivatives, he found himself drawing on Arlize's knowledge of arcane equations. The mathematical principles that governed mana flow had surprising applications to calculus, offering him insights and shortcuts he'd never considered in his previous life. It was kind of weird that even across world, math remained the same.

Halfway through, Jordan leaned over, whispering, ""Dude, you actually understand this stuff?""

Nick kept his eyes on the paper but smiled slightly. ""Doing my best.""

Jordan sighed in defeat. ""Alright, well, if you don't mind explaining some of this later, I'd owe you big-time.""

""No problem,"" Nick whispered back reassuringly, returning his focus to the test.

The quiz took the entire two-hour class period. At the end, the professor gathered the quizzes, reminding students to review their syllabus and brush up on the basics for the next class.

Exiting the lecture hall, Jordan looked at Nick with relief. ""Seriously, thanks for agreeing to help. That quiz was rough.""

""No worries, we'll get through it,"" Nick said confidently.

As they walked toward the exit, Nick noticed familiar faces waiting outside: Matt and Sarah, talking quietly together, standing near the entrance.

Nick's jaw tightened slightly, his heart seizing painfully at the sight of them. Sarah’s smile once brought warmth; now it twisted his gut with quiet rage. He could almost admire its perfect deceit. Matt's easy confidence, once admirable, now read as arrogance.

A complicated storm of emotions surged through him. Beneath his anger lay a deeper, more insidious pain. Despite everything, a part of him still remembered loving her. Remembered trusting him. Phantom feelings from a timeline he was determined to erase.

For a brief, disorienting moment, Nick felt his resolve waver. Would it be so terrible to try again and forge a different path together?

But then the memory of his own blood pooling on concrete flashed vividly in his mind. The searing pain of the knife. The cold realization in his dying moments that he'd wasted his life chasing people who never truly cared for him. Whatever had happened between Sarah and Matt hadn’t been just a one-time incident—something in his gut told him there was more to it, connections he hadn't seen before.

*No,* he thought, his resolve hardening. *There will be no reconciliation. Only justice. Calculated, methodical justice.*

He forced his expression into a neutral mask, burying the conflict beneath a carefully constructed facade, staying focused on his conversation with Jordan.

As they walked out, Sarah noticed him first, her face lighting up. ""Nick!""

Matt grinned. ""Damn, man, you disappeared after the ceremony. What's up?""

Nick kept his expression neutral. ""Busy getting ahead.""

Sarah tilted her head. ""That's new. Since when does Nick Valiente care about academics?""

He shrugged. ""Figured I'd try something different. Amazing what a brush with death will do for your motivation."" The words slipped out before he could stop them, a cryptic reference to a future they couldn't possibly understand.

Matt laughed, clearly missing the implication. ""Are we still on for Friday? Couple of the guys are throwing a thing at the Alpha Phi frat house. You want to come?""

Nick already knew how that would play out. He'd go, get drunk, let his guard down, and everything would slowly unravel. The first step toward his eventual demise.

""Not really my scene anymore,"" he said smoothly.

Matt blinked. ""For real? Who are you and what have you done with Nick Valiente?""

*If you only knew,* Nick thought darkly. Out loud, he just smiled. ""Just focused. Catch you later.""

He turned, walking away before they could probe further. Jordan caught up to him, eyebrows raised. ""Dude, you okay?""

Nick nodded, ""Yeah, I’m fine.""

Jordan frowned but didn't press. ""Well, come on, man. Let's get out of here.""

Nick exhaled, pushing away old ghosts.

Two classes down. A lifetime of change to go.

Nick pushed open the door to the campus café, holding it open for Jordan, who sauntered in behind him, hands stuffed deep in his pockets. The tantalizing aroma of fresh pizza and grilling burgers filled their senses, mingling with laughter and chatter from other students unwinding after the day's classes.

""So, Matt and Sarah, huh?"" Jordan said with a raised eyebrow as they lined up to order. ""What's their deal?""

Nick gave a dry laugh, bitterness touching the edges of his tone. ""Long story. Let's just say I've seen enough déjà vu for a lifetime. Some people show you who they really are when they think you're not looking.""

Jordan shrugged lightly. ""Fair enough. You good, though?""

""Never better,"" Nick replied, glancing at Jordan briefly. Still wary, but Jordan hadn't yet given him reason to act.

They ordered their meals—two fully loaded burgers with sweet potato fries—and found a quiet table by the window. Nick's mind raced as he picked at his fries, thinking about Matt and Sarah. Anger simmered beneath his calm facade, sharpening into a cold calculation. He was done being played by them, but revenge required patience and careful planning.

Across the table, Jordan flipped through his tablet, pulling up notes from the calculus quiz they'd taken earlier in the day. ""Professor Ellis definitely didn't go easy on us. Those derivatives were brutal.""

""Yeah,"" Nick replied absently, eyes skimming through the notes. ""Chain rule caught me off guard.""

Jordan nodded thoughtfully. ""Same here. Should we review the first couple chapters from the book tonight?""

Nick hesitated briefly, sizing Jordan up once more before finally giving a reluctant nod. ""Makes sense.""

Their review session was tense yet productive, each absorbed in their own work, occasionally exchanging insights on tricky problems. Despite his initial wariness, Nick grudgingly acknowledged Jordan's genuine focus and determination. Yet he reminded himself sternly—trust was a luxury he couldn't afford.

As they were going over a particularly tricky equation, Jordan's eyes grew wide and he had to speak up.

""Hold on,"" Jordan said, frowning at Nick's solution to a particularly complex derivative. ""How did you know to solve it this way? That wasn't on the quiz answer key Professor Ellis sent us.""

Nick froze, realizing his mistake. He'd worked through these problems in his previous life—struggled through them for weeks with a tutor. Now the solutions came naturally, muscle memory from a future that hadn't happened yet.

*Careful,* he warned himself. *Don't give away too much.*

""I... studied ahead,"" he said, choosing his words carefully. ""Did some research online about calc methods.""

Jordan's eyebrows raised. ""Pretty advanced stuff to just 'research online.' Where'd you learn to think like this?""

Nick shrugged, trying to appear casual. ""I've always been good with patterns, just never applied myself before. Being a jock was easier—less expected of you academically.""

""Well, it's impressive,"" Jordan said, though his expression remained thoughtful. ""You sure you haven't taken this class before?""

The question hit uncomfortably close to the truth. Nick forced a laugh. ""First time. Promise.""

Jordan nodded, but Nick noticed him watching more carefully as they continued working. He needed to be more cautious—intelligence was an asset, but drawing too much attention too quickly could become a liability.

Still, he couldn't help feeling a dark satisfaction. The professors and students who had dismissed him as just another athlete would soon discover just how wrong they had been.

After finishing their food and notes, they stepped out into the cool evening air. Campus lights illuminated their path, casting soft shadows across the pavement.

""Gym?"" Jordan asked, stretching his arms overhead.

Nick matched his stride cautiously, giving a short nod. ""Yeah.""

Inside the gym, familiar sounds of weights clanging and machinery humming filled the air. Nick dove into his workout routine methodically, his body moving through each exercise while his mind raced ahead, strategizing. He glanced periodically at Jordan, who seemed genuinely engrossed in his own workout. Nick reminded himself firmly—everyone had their secrets, and he wasn't about to blindly trust another stranger.

When he finished his last set of bench presses, Nick sat up, wiping sweat from his brow. Alone in his corner, he stared at a dumbbell lying nearby, concentrating intensely. Drawing on Arlize's memories, he tried to sense the metal's structure, its composition. For a brief moment, faint lines appeared, tracing the contours of the weight, revealing quantum pathways that only he could see.

*It's getting stronger,* he realized with a surge of excitement. *Whatever connection I have to Arlize's abilities, it's growing.*

Wiping his forehead, Nick glancing over to Jordan, who was eyeing the pull-up bar. ""I'm done for tonight. You staying?""

Jordan nodded, already positioning himself under the bar. ""Yeah, got some more left. I'll see you later.""

""Sure,"" Nick responded quietly, grabbing his towel and heading out.

The walk back to his dorm was silent and filled with thoughts of revenge and suspicion. Matt's smug expression lingered in his mind, fueling a growing determination. Sarah's false smile irritated him further, igniting a cold fury he carefully controlled.

As he passed the science building, his attention was caught by a strange flicker in the air—a brief flicker of blue-white energy around the building's electronic security panel. Nick stopped, staring at it. For a moment, he could see delicate lines of power flowing through the circuitry, just as he'd once seen mana flow through the enchanted weapons of Arlize's world.

*The Arcadian System,* he thought suddenly, the name appearing in his mind unbidden. That's what Arlize had called the network of mana-tech that had powered his civilization. But why would he see traces of it here, in this world?

Curious, Nick approached the panel cautiously, glancing around to ensure no one was watching. He extended his hand toward it, not quite touching, and concentrated. The blue lines brightened slightly, responding to his presence. When he traced a simple rune in the air—one of the first circuit designs Arlize had learned—the security panel beeped softly, its status light flickering from red to green momentarily before cycling back.

Nick withdrew his hand quickly, stunned. He wasn't just remembering Arlize's abilities—he was actually accessing them. And they weren't just magical fantasies; they appeared to have real, tangible effects on technology in this world.

*This changes everything,* he thought, his mind racing with possibilities. If he could harness this connection fully, develop this strange fusion of mana and modern tech, what couldn't he accomplish?

Back in his room, Nick showered quickly and slipped into bed, checking his phone. A new message from an unknown number appeared: *Hey, great seeing you again today! We should catch up properly soon. - Sarah*

Nick's jaw tightened, anger flaring through him sharply. His mind shifted immediately into calculation, considering how best to use this interaction to his advantage. After a moment, he deliberately set the phone aside without replying.

Sarah and Matt had underestimated him once—he wouldn't let it happen again.

Before sleep, he practiced one more time, focusing intensely on his palm. A perfect sphere of pale blue light formed above his hand, hovering for nearly ten seconds before dissolving. It was small—no bigger than a marble—but stable, controlled.

*Progress,* he thought with grim satisfaction. *The Arcadian System exists here, somehow. And I'm going to master it.*

As he lay in darkness, revisiting the day's calculus problems in his mind, he felt a grim satisfaction settle over him. Trust was dangerous, but strategy was key. And now, he had an advantage no one else could possibly understand.

Think if Instagram had a baby with yelp and instead of following Kylie Jenner, ESPN Highlights, and coworkers, you were following your favorite venues and events that people were posting User generated photos and videos for? Imagine following Madison Square Garden or Coachella and getting to see people’s posts there without needing to follow them. Imagine if Yelp remembered your preferences and gave you better suggestions than just “coffee near me”

And that’s just the user experience. 2nd pillar is the benefits Venues get for joining the platform. Mind you this is a 3 legged stool so we can’t skip over what a hot bed this would be for advertisers with users volunteering their preferences.

A lot has happened in the past six years since Chris and Kenny met Gabriel and Javier. Chris and Kenny have grown a lot closer, bonding over their losses of family and what they’ve had to do to survive. Chris has begun to think of Kenny as a father figure, but he’d never say that out loud.

Javi and Gabe are close, but their relationship has definitely strained over the years. Javi tries to teach him things and to give him tips, but Gabe doesn’t want to listen. Instead, he keeps talking about how Javi isn’t his dad and he shouldn’t be acting like it. He also sometimes has small fits of anger, which has definitely pissed Chris off more than once. Either way, they’ve all been surviving together for the last few years, and no matter how much they argue or fight, they intend to keep it that way.

Currently, they’re all walking down a long road leading into a small town. They’re low on food again and they need to start scavenging, especially since there’s four of them and winter will be approaching soon.

“Why are we doing this? Heading into the walker-infested city is stupid,” Gabe comments as his boots drag along the roughness of the road. Javi nods, agreeing with him but choosing to explain anyway.

“It’s stupid, but we need to do it. We’re four men and we barely have any food left, Gabe,” Javi explains as he holds his metal bat over his shoulder while all of them continue walking down the long, narrow road.

“Yeah, we ain’t gonna survive the winter like this. Long nights, ice hiding underneath inches of snow, all the animals hibernatin’. The only good thing that comes from this is the walkers startin’ to freeze. Plus, we gotta get you a new jacket. You wear it so much there’s holes in it,” Kenny points out, glancing over at Chris’s jacket. It’s just a regular army green jacket, but it was Michael’s and Chris won’t put it down no matter how dingy it gets.

“Just because you get me a new one doesn’t mean I’m gonna wear it, Kenny,” Chris states, pushing his hands deeper into the pockets of his jacket. As much as he’d like to just let it go, he can’t.

Their boots continue trailing down the road as the chill breeze drifts through the air, whipping all of their faces with a hard smack. Even if they have jackets, any skin exposed is still cold and they’re trying to make it back to the house by nightfall. Eventually, the men manage to come up on a gas station leading into the city.

“Let’s check the gas station first. If there’s food in there, we can skip the city for now and head back tomorrow so we’re not freezing our asses off,” Chris suggests, heading towards the gas station alone. However, before he can get too far, he feels Kenny grip his upper arm, pulling him back to the group.

“Why would there be food in there that hasn't already expired?” Kenny asks while Chris looks back at him with a stubborn gaze. He’s only trying to look out for him, even if Chris doesn’t always listen.

“He’s right, Chris. How many gas stations have canned food on their shelves?” Javi asks the younger man, trying to get Chris to think this through. Chris sighs as he wiggles his arm from Kenny’s grasp, trying to understand while also wanting to at least check out the place.

“Listen, I get it, but I’m going in. Everything’s pretty much expired now and we can’t really pass this up. Gabe, you coming with me?” Chris asks, glancing over at the taller man. Gabe nods, his knuckles turning white as the grip on his handheld axe tightens. Kenny nods, staring back at the gas station and over at Chris again.

“Alright, kid. Fine. If you see anything, holler. Javi and I will wait for you,” Kenny reassures Chris. Chris nods, flashing Kenny a small smile, happy that the older man’s trusting him.

“Thanks, Kenny. We won’t take long, I promise. Also, Javi, behind you,” Chris points out as the rest of the group stands on guard, turning around to look at what’s behind Javi. Instead of a walker that’s about to bite his head off, like they were expecting, it’s just a cold, slow walker that’s barely within ten feet of him. As Gabe and Chris begin walking towards the gas station, they’re able to hear the crack of the walker’s skull getting hit by Javi’s metal bat.

“Hey, thanks for coming with me. I know we’re not, like, best buds or anything, but… yeah. Thank you,” Chris tells Gabe as they continue approaching the small gas station, hoping nobody’s holed up in there.

“Don’t thank me. Let’s just get some food so Kenny and Javi can get off our asses,” Gabe complains in a low tone as he pushes on the door handle, trying to get into the gas station, but it doesn’t let him in. After he pushes a few more times, he comes to the realization that it just isn’t going to open.

“What the hell? Who locks a gas station?” Gabe complains, slamming his boot up against the metal below the door, kicking it in anger. As both men stare at the door, Chris manages to come up with an idea. He begins shuffling his jacket off, leaving himself vulnerable in the cold with only a white shirt underneath.

“What’re you doing?” Gabe asks, staring at him. Chris refuses to answer as he drapes the jacket against the glass of the door, staring up at Gabe.

“Be ready,” Chris warns Gabe as he glances back at the glass.

“What? Why?” Gabe asks in a worried tone, hoping that Chris isn’t as psychotic as he seems. Instead of giving him an answer, Chris slams his elbow up against the glass behind the jacket, causing it to shatter and break a hole through the door. The sound vibrates into the air while Chris shakes out his jacket. Tiny glass shards fall onto the ground as Chris slides it back on.

“Come on.” “Are you serious?” Gabe argues, but watches as Chris crouches through the hole anyway. His boots crunch on the broken glass layered on the smooth floor as he steps into the gas station. The scent of Fritos, fresh paint, and blood linger through the air. Before Chris deepens himself into the gas station, he stares out of the glass door, his gaze setting on an anxious Gabe.

“What are you doing? Come on,” Chris insists, needing someone to back him up. However, Gabe shakes his head, refusing.

“Hell no. You can do that by yourself. I’ll keep you covered out here,” Gabe tells Chris, waiting by the doors. Instead of arguing like they always do, Chris just shakes his head and grumbles under his breath.

“What a great help you are,” he mutters to himself as he begins cautiously walking around the gas station with his hunting knife in hand.

Chip bags, energy drink bottles, coffee cups, and empty cigarette packs lay across the floor, almost lining the aisles like a trail. There are small droplets of fresh blood near the counter, but there are no signs of any bodies. No decaying smell, no groans, no cries for help. The only suspicious thing Chris is able to find is a white paint bucket sitting near the register. As Chris carefully goes to check it out, he finds words painted in white behind the counter.

“For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

“Well, that’s fucking creepy…” Chris mutters, wondering who could’ve been here before them. Instead of taking his time and standing there, he decides to hurry up and get the hell out of there. He reaches over the counter and swipes one of the plastic bags, beginning to swiftly search the aisles for anything edible.

While scanning the shelves, making sure to check his surroundings, he’s able to find canned chicken noodle soup, a few hard candy packs, coffee beans, and beef jerky. It probably tastes bad, but any type of meat sounds good. After Chris finishes, he rushes over towards the entrance, slipping back through the hole in the door. He can see Gabe still waiting by the doors, his axe in hand.

“What’d you get?” Gabe asks as both men start walking back over to Javi and Kenny, their boots marching on the icy ground beneath them. Chris smirks as he hands the bag over to Gabe.

“Go ahead and check. I can’t believe you were so scared to go into an abandoned gas station,” Chris teases, pushing his hunting knife back into his sheath. He hears Gabe scoff beside him as they make it back to Kenny and Javi. Javi’s stretching his arms above his head while Kenny holds his hand out, trying to see what’s in the bag.

“You find anything?” The older man asks in his thick southern accent. Chris smirks and nods while Gabe hands Kenny the bag. As Kenny opens it and searches through, a huge grin appears on his face. He pulls out the package of coffee beans and shows it off like it’s a trophy.

“Well, shit! Look at that. I haven’t had coffee in years.” “That could definitely get us through the winter,” Javi jokes as Kenny tosses the coffee beans back into the bag. Chris watches as Kenny’s gaze sticks to the road leading past the gas station. Part of him wants to go into the city, not knowing what tomorrow brings, but they’re safe for now. Maybe they should just be happy nothing happened.

“Kenny. We always have tomorrow,” Chris reassures him, laying a hand on the shoulder of Kenny’s jacket. Kenny sighs and nods, adjusting the hat on his head.

“Yeah… You’re right. Turn back. We’re lucky anything was in that gas station at all,” Kenny states as he turns his body around, walking back up the road. The group follows after him, sick of standing out in the cold.

—

After about an hour of walking, they make it back to the house. They sneak in through the basement since the front door has a bell system set up, just in case any walkers or strangers come inside while they’re sleeping. As the men make it to the living room of the house, they all sit in a circle on the rug, dropping the bag down in the center.

“So, who’s turn is it to tell a story tonight? I think Chris has run out at this point,” Javi comments as Kenny opens the bag of beef jerky. Chris shakes his head and scoffs, feeding into Javi’s playful nature.

“It’s not my fault I was eight when the apocalypse began, and I think it’s Gabe’s turn,” Chris tells the group as Kenny takes a piece of the jerky before passing the bag to him. Javi sighs as he nudges Gabe with his elbow, teasing him.

“I know all of Gabe’s stories. I’ve been with him for most of his life,” Javi complains with a smirk, but Gabe’s eyebrows furrow as he moves away from Javi.

“Whatever. There’s stuff I went through that you weren’t there for.” “Bullshit. Oh, actually… Maybe you should tell them about your first crush,” Javi suggests, and Gabe hides his face in his beanie while Kenny and Chris’s eyes glow in amusement.

“Crush? How the hell did you meet a girl? I haven’t seen one in twelve years,” Chris says in a joking tone, being completely serious as he bites into one of the pieces of jerky. It tastes like plastic and it’s super tough, but it’s not terrible. He holds the bag open, offering a piece to Javi, but he declines.

“It was before we rebuilt Richmond. There was a girl around my age that helped us get out of the situation we were in. It was stupid, but… she was cool,” Gabe mutters, staring at the floor in embarrassment. Chris smiles as he hands the jerky bag to him.

“I didn’t know it was possible for you to compliment people, Gabe.” “Fuck off,” Gabe hisses as he begins eating the tough jerky in the bag.

“Well, don’t be shy. What’d she look like?” Kenny asks as he drapes his arm over his knee, trying to get more info from Gabe. However, everyone can clearly tell that Gabe’s embarrassed and doesn’t want to talk about a crush he had years ago, so Javi chimes in instead.

“She was short, had brown hair with a blue hat. Honestly, kinda impressive she kept it for that long,” Javi comments, but Chris glances over at Kenny and can see his eyes glow when he mentions a blue hat.

“Blue hat? What happened to her?” “Uh… We went our separate ways. We stayed in Richmond and she went to go search for a kid she lost. I think his name was AJ?” Javi explains, sounding a bit uncertain. A silence lingers over the men as Kenny just stares at Javi in disbelief, his jaw practically on the floor. Javi glances around in uncomfort, not exactly sure why Kenny’s staring at him like that.

“Hey, Kenny… Are you okay?” Chris asks, shaking his shoulder a bit. Kenny snaps out of whatever trance he was in as his eyebrows furrow, immediately getting angry.

“You’ve known us for years and this is the first time you’ve ever brought up Clementine?!” Kenny shouts, standing up from the rug. As Chris stands up along with Kenny, trying to calm him down, Javi tries to defend himself.

“How was I supposed to know you knew her, man? I mean, you never said a name,” Javi tries to explain, but Kenny just shakes his head.

“Kenny… Does this have anything to do with the girl you were talking about when we first met? The girl you sent into Wellington with the baby?” Chris asks, wanting to be completely sure. He feels a bit left out that they happen to know the same person and Chris doesn’t know anything, but that’s the way life goes.

“Yes! But now I know that these assholes have known her the entire time and just sent a kid on her way. Alone!” Kenny explains, clenching his jaw as he stares down at the other two men.

“Whoa, whoa. Trust me, she knew how to handle herself, pal. Out of our entire group, she was probably the most capable, and we couldn’t stop her from going,” Javi continues trying to explain, but it just keeps pissing Kenny off.

“Kenny, maybe she just changed, man. People change with age, and it sounds like you guys knew two different versions, right? You knew a little girl that you had to protect and watch over, and they knew a strong teenage girl. Can we just drop it? Please,” Chris begs, trying to avoid the arguing. It takes a moment, but Kenny nods.

“Yeah… Fine. Just-… Goddammit!” Kenny punches the wall as he storms into the other room, needing to be alone to cool off. Chris stares down at Gabe and Javi as he takes a deep breath, placing his hands on his hips.

“Well… We’re done with story night,” Chris comments, being a smartass. Gabe nods as he closes the bag of beef jerky, throwing it back into the plastic bag.

“Yeah… Obviously,” he mutters, pushing his beanie over his eyes. Instead of speaking up, Javi just keeps his mouth shut and refuses to talk, not wanting to start anything else.

“Okay then… I’m gonna go take a piss. I’ll be back. Make sure Kenny doesn’t try and punch any more holes in the wall, please,” Chris states as he walks out of the living room and jogs down the stairs to the basement. As he reaches the dark, cold room underneath the house, he makes his way over to the awning window in the corner of the basement. As he carefully slides it open, he jumps up and slips through the small space.

Leaves and branches crunch under his weight as he makes it outside. While his hand hovers over his knife sheath, he deepens himself into the trees behind the house, scanning the area for walkers.

Once he deems the area safe, he begins unbuckling his belt. While he struggles, he realizes something just feels… off. Like someone’s watching him. It’s a different feeling than when walkers are behind you. Walkers are loud and sloppy and they make sure you know they’re there, but with people, it’s different. They’re calculated. They know what they’re doing.

Instead of just believing it’s paranoia, Chris sticks with his gut and swiftly takes his hunting knife from the sheath on his leg, turning around. Before he can successfully do anything, the man waiting right behind him catches his arm and twists it behind his back, pressing him up against the tree.

“Fuck…” Chris groans as the taller man restrains him, holding him in place. The man behind him has a mask on and he’s wearing all white. The mask has a bunch of fake eyes placed on it so you can’t tell where the man’s watching you from.

“Drop the knife. Now,” the man orders as his grip on Chris’s arm gets tighter. A small grunt escapes from Chris’s mouth as he nods his head, dropping the knife onto the ground. Chris struggles, trying to get the man to loosen his arm, but it only causes the man to put more pressure on it.

“How many people are in the house?” The man asks, his tone low and his voice gravely. As the bark of the tree begins forming lines into Chris’s face, he lies to the man, trying to protect the group.

“Nobody. It’s just me…” Chris manages to say as he tries to steady his breathing. A guttural laugh comes from the man, not gullible enough to fall for Chris’s lies.

“Then why were there four pairs of footsteps leading back here?” The man asks, interrogating Chris. Chris continues struggling, his brain not processing what to do in this situation. He can’t go for his gun and yelling for anyone will probably get him killed. As the man holds him against the tree, Chris is able to hear other men flood the house behind them. Gunshots go off, but it doesn’t sound like anyone’s screaming in pain.

“May God be with you,” the man says as he quickly shoves a rag over Chris’s face, forcing him to breathe in whatever the rag’s coated with. Panic begins to set in for Chris, but it doesn’t last long. Before he knows it, his eyes close and he passes out, hitting the cold ground.

1l14q6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1l14q6f/we_were_all_alive_and_all_pitiful/,We Were all Alive and All Pitiful,"When Dylan’s wife Mara told me he’d died, I instantly knew three things:



One, it was suicide.



Two, it led back to Fall Creek Water Plant—where we killed Julian Verrett.



And three, the game Verrett started with us still wasn’t finished. Not even after twenty years.



You would’ve known kids like us: Cameron, Felix, Dominic, Dylan, and me.



Cameron, who got locked in closets for anything less than an A-minus.



Dom, who liked eyeliner, but enjoyed minor arson, and strong cigarettes even more.



Felix, fluent in three languages and in handcuffs just as many times.



Dylan, who never stopped playing the game—not even after we killed Julian Verrett.



And me. The quiet kid who transferred schools in November and lied about it being because of my dad’s job. 



You think anyone was going to connect the dots?



Not when Julian Verrett’s death was ruled accidental.



Not when Ricky Boyce took a thirty-year plea for kidnapping and manslaughter.



Not when four of Verrett’s former math students left school midyear for “nervous exhaustion.”



I slept in my parents’ room for two years. I didn’t step outside alone for another three.



Cameron finished school at home with a team of elite tutors. Felix vanished—until I got a call from boot camp, his voice practically giddy that he was free from his parents.



We never talked about what happened in the sub-basement.



And we never, ever mentioned what we saw happen to poor, doomed Dominic.



Not out loud, anyway.



Our parents went silent. And though I swore I’d tell the truth someday, I didn’t. I followed their lead.



That was before Dylan hanged himself with a dog leash.



And any chance at excuses ran out.



# Turn 1:

Dylan left a box for us. 



Mara told us he’d been collecting it his whole adult life. “Trying to figure out what happened to you guys as kids,” she said.



Everything he’d been working on was in a big black-and-yellow Costco tub in their basement. Mara told us we had two hours before Dylan’s family got in. 



Tomorrow they were burying him at Our Lady of Peace cemetery. Before then, she wanted the box gone forever. 



Felix was pacing. Cameron went quiet. I opened it. The smell hit us immediately.



Verrett’s Winston brand cigarettes, the mildew funk of wet paper, the stench of sulfur gas from the municipal water treatment reached out and wouldn’t let go.



Felix splashed puke into the downstairs sink. Cameron stared at the contents. An odd, sunny-day breeze swirled around the basement 



“Are those…is this from Fall Creek?” he whispered.



They were. 



I hadn’t seen the cards from The Sylvan Shore in twenty years—but they still slithered through my dreams, gold-edged and mold-slick, every week since I was fifteen. 



I never even knew how the game ended, except that the body count was three and rising. 



I picked up the rubber-banded stack of cards. I went dizzy. The smoke and mold and water smell bloomed. Felix spasmed and dry-heaved. 



I waved cigarette smoke out of my eyes. The odd warm breeze changed direction. I didn’t understand where I was. 



I was in a basement.



Yes. It was today. Right before the funeral. 



No. 

# Turn 2:

It was twenty years ago. I could feel Verrett’s long yellow fingernails on my neck. 

  


It started a quarter mile from the State Fairgrounds. 



We turned off Keystone and into the cracked-up Fall Creek Water Plant under the faded sign that proclaimed:



EVERYTHING THAT GROWS NEEDS WATER.



We hustled through the padlocked bay door.



Scrambled down the stairwell past the locked fire door.



Slipped through the dead-bolted steel slab marked:



BACKWASH CHAMBER SUB B1.



The sub-basement reeked. Mold, chlorine, and chain-smoked cigarettes pervaded. 



But here we were. 



Felix yanked, shook, and cracked a beer from a cooler packed with ice, and said this was exactly what the fuck we needed. Verrett said congratulations were in order.



We clapped for Ricky—he’d really set the place up.



Ricky grinned bigtime as he helped Verrett with his coat. Verrett lifted his good shoulder as Ricky gently pulled the sleeve past the bad one. 



Verrett’s shirt got hung on the butt of a revolver. I must have been staring right at it, because Ricky winked at me and covered it with a flick of Verrett’s flannel shirt.



Verrett was our advanced math teacher. He wore these huge steel-rimmed glasses, and always had one hand tucked inside a pocket. Students would whisper he’d been in a mental institution. That he was fucking loaded. That he had a false hand, and he'd cut the old one off himself. 



Verrett understood us. He understood that everyone in our little group  only got the wrong kind of attention from adults. For most of us, he was the first male adult who wasn’t constantly shouting at us.



“Before he was in my class, Ricky couldn’t even factor a trinomial. Now look at him, setting up our critical event with personal grace. I’d clap, ah, if only I was able.” 



Ricky was all smiles as he rolled up a sticky joint.  He ran our Dungeons and Dragons games, his plots drip-filtered from weekly LSD swan-dives. 



Dominic and I passed the joint pinch-to-pinch, exhaling thick cones of cannabis indica smoke. A week ago Dom and I dyed our hair—Lunar Tides Eclipse Black—over his moms chipped kitchen sink. 



Ricky said we should be really excited. He said he played Verrett’s game just one time and it changed his whole life. All that was left for us to do was  playtest the final prototype. And in return, all the weed, beer, and Dungeons and Dragons we could stand. We were all virgins but Dominic, and it was heaven. 



“Credit?” Felix asked. “You said we get credit?”



“Each one of your names, in Sylvan Shores Game Manual, on the very first page.” Verrett said. 



“For what, exactly?” I asked. 



“For refining the game.”



“So we’re just…unpaid labor?” Dominic asked. 



“On my teacher’s salary, this…is the best I can do.”



Dominic rolled his eyes. “So you’ll be the designer, writer, person who gets all the credit and money?”



“No.” Verrett laughed. His breath stank like coffee and mold. “Just the Translator.”



“Ricky said you invented it. What, did you and Ricky discover it on some acid trip?” Dylan giggled. 



“No. Oh, no.” Verrett said, tapping the front of his skull. “I just translated as it was spoken to me and the rules were placed into my head one-by-one.”



Everyone eyeballed each other. Is this shit for real? 



“By who?” Dominic scoffed



Verrett sighed, closed his eyes. He leaned back and sighed. “The **Goddess**.”



Some of the other guys laughed. 



I didn’t. 



A fist of ice squeezed my stomach as I thought about Verrett, the gun, and those three locked doors. 



# Turn 3:

This was how the game started. 



This is how every tick of the clock for twenty years was another turn, until Dylan waved the flag when he hanged himself next to his Toyota Camry. 



See, Verrett worked for the water company. Indianapolis needed an expert on pipes, flow, and pressure. So, you get Julian Verrett.



That’s how he had his accident. That’s how he saw the **Goddess**. 



His memory of it was just two distinct noises. Angry groaning from the lathe as it snatched his cuff, then one wet snap as his arm shattered, and his shoulder pried out of socket.



Verrett said the lathe whipped all the clothes off. He was cold and naked as his head slammed over and over against the hard metal saddle of the machine.



By the time most of his teeth were gone, and he was blind from his own foamy blood, well, that was when he finally met the **Goddess**. 



“She reached down, with one slender hand, from above the bubbling red death and clicked off the machine.”



He looked us each in the eye and reached a short, shaking arm out. “I could have never reached that button on my own, boys.”



He said the **Goddess** saved him with one hand, and placed a vision into his mind with the other. 



They scraped what was left of him off the lathe and got him to Methodist Hospital with twenty-two fractures, a cranium fracture, and one arm that would be little more than dead weight at best.



He said the game could pierce the inexplicable veil and that he, Julian Verrett, would be the one to bring the truth of the **Goddess** across this chasm.. 



He shuffled the cards plk-plk-plk. 



“Each one of us has the same odds. Every card is a moment in life moving forward from this point in time. Every play, a lifetime in miniature. You put your will to the test and win, or succumb, to the whims of the **Goddess**. Time to experience your future.” 



Pretty cards. Black White Gold Blue Red. Their names glinted and tantalized. The Twilight Bay. The Question of Seashells. Dashed against the Rocks.



A strong, warm wind blew through the chamber. Verrett gasped as they freckled the dingy floor.



 I picked one up - The Undertow. Gold fingers grasping just above the waves grasping for something already gone, catching only an ocean breeze. 



“Jesus, this looks unpleasant.” I said. 



Ricky lit a joint. “Tell em, Julian.”



“Some take all. Some give all. Only one card wins.”



“What does this one…do?” Dylan said, poking the edges of “Dashed against the Rocks”. He traced a woodcut image of a man battered, his body painting jagged rocks crimson as the seafoam below curled pink. 



“Instant death.” Ricky said. “The player is removed from the game. No further turns are taken.”



Julian cleared the table off. He unfolded a thick black game board in front of us, thin slots sunk to stand the cards up nicely. 



“But it has already been proven before I even start.” Julian began stacking out piles 1-2-3-4-5 for each of us. 



“Each card is destiny, sure as the tide. What will happen, has happened, and is always happening. But only I will arrive at the Sylvan Shore.”



Dom rolled his eyes and scoffed. He couldn’t possibly be sold. 



Verrett used his good hand to lift the gun from its holster. The room got so quiet all you could hear was the cigarette paper smoldering. 



“If anyone thinks they can stop what has started. ” Verrett said. 



“Bullshit.” Said Dominic, as Verrett moved the gun less than a foot from his face. 



“First turn. See what the **Goddess** has chosen for you.”



“Are you going to kill me, what if the game says I win?”



Verrett tapped out Dominic’s cards.



“Dominic, let’s find out.”



“They don’t mean anything.”



“Oh, they certainly do. You’ll see exactly what the **Goddess** has in store for each of us.”



“It’s a toy.”



Verrett raged. “Pick it up! The **Goddess** demands it!”



Dominic pursed his lips. He picked the top card off his pile. With a glance, he went pfffft, and flicked the card over his shoulder. 



Ricky leaned to catch a glance of it. “Uh oh.”



Verrett didn’t take his eyes off Dom. He asked what the card was.



“Dashed against the Rocks.” Ricky said. 



Verrett pulled the trigger an inch away. Long dark strands of his hair smoldered onto the game board. His head made a terrible sizzling noise as he tilted straight back. 



Verrett slid the barrel of the gun across our faces and shouted that we better stop crying. 



He told Ricky to clean up the mess. The odd warm breeze started up again as Ricky yanked Dom’s jacket up past his shoulder. 



Verrett stared right down the gun barrel. I tried to shout, but only dry yelps escaped. 



Verrett tugged a tight knot across Dom’s soaked head, jamming the denim deep into the hole in his forehead. 



Ricky grunted and shoved Dominic’s body over the rails and into the huge backwash pool beneath us. We watched the gray water grind away and churn red before the ringing in our ears stopped. 



Verrett said in a merry tone that it was my turn at the card. 



I froze, cell by dreadful cell. I remember wishing Verrett would push the barrel into my hair and pull the trigger. End this now. I’ll take my chances with the inconceivable. 



But this suffering was Verrett’s plan. 



In phone-jammed subfloors beneath the city, he held a smoking gun and the only keys to daylight.



We were going to play this game until we were dead or insane.



One turn at a time.



# Turn 4:



We were in the deepest waters. 

  


We had played for days—maybe more. Time collapsed under the weight of turns, rules, and the proclamations of the **Goddess**. I wandered card-born landscapes: colossal dunes that required my deepest secrets to escape, inlets that forced me to wade in early memory, a mangrove forest that rooted me to the tide until I shouted what I feared the most. 



We were all alive and all pitiful. We told Verrett and the **Goddess** everything, clinging to whatever frayed thread of self we still had.



Verrett cackled that the **Goddess** was drawing near. You could feel her, he said, in the saltwater breeze that spun through the basement like a warning.



Only Dylan and Verrett had cards left to turn. I saw Dylan muttering, lips moving without sound, like he was rehearsing something he’d never get to say.



Verrett was shaking, sweating, a vein on his forehead throbbing like lightning. 



“You’ll see the path she has for me. A moonlit passage to the Sylvan Shore.”



Ricky fiddled with another joint.  He’d taken control of the pistol while Verrett stared in ecstasy at the cards. 



“I don’t want to play this anymore!” Dylan said.



“It will happen whether you want to or not.”



“No, no, please, I’m all done, it’s too much!” Dylan was sobbing now.



Ricky looked up, coughing, his head wreathed in smoke. 



Verrett was shouting. “ You have to see the path the **Goddess** has laid out for you!” He was up on his feet now, jabbing his finger at the board.



Felix got next to Ricky. Me, Cameron, Felix locked eyes. It was right now or never ever. 



“Hey Ricky, can I uh, you mind if I hit that?”



Ricky peered at Felix, his red eyes thin as coin slots. “Ah, sure man.”



Verrett’s fingers tapped at Dylan’s card. “You’re only delaying the inevitable,” he hissed. 

Cameron was staring at me. Pleading. *I saw. I understood. I’ll kill if I have to.* 



Felix shot smoke across Ricky’s face. Ricky gagged, blinked, and Felix jammed the hot tip of the joint onto Ricky’s upper lip. Ricky yelped and Verrett turned to shout “Knock it off right now!” 



Then we killed him.



Cameron swung at the back of Verrett’s head. Verrett wobbled and went to the floor.



Felix growled and pounded his fists into Ricky’s face until his knuckles were stripped to the bone. Ricky moaned somewhere subconscious. 



Dylan jogged and swung his sneakers towards Verrett’s jaw. Yellowed teeth sprayed. 



Ricky went limp. I took the gun. 



Verrett was unsteady on his knees. Cameron and Dylan dragged him wriggling to the rails over the backwash. I put the gun under his jaw. I couldn’t squeeze the trigger. My breath caught. 



Verrett clawed his fingernails around my neck. 



Verrett moaned “Please just turn the cards!”



Cameron peeled the pistol from my hand. Hammered Verrett between the eyes. His eyeglasses burst into lenses and little specks of frames. 



“Come on! Come ON!” Felix shouted. His hands spooled blood. Cameron sneered as he and Dylan clamped down on Verrett’s leg. 



Verrett spasmed and kicked the table. Dylan’s final card fell to the floor— a man bound by chains and vines. 

  


Verrett arched his neck to see it, the blood running hot from where his eyeglasses raked off. 



I knew right then how to finish this. 



Verrett’s last card sat face down. His ticket to eternity.



I slid it from the table and, hiding the face, tucked it into my pocket.

  


Verrett saw me. His eyes went wide and wet. He sobbed.



Felix and Dylan held him down, rough. 



Cameron punched the pistol into Verrett’s face, hard. The rest of Verrett’s teeth hit the floor before his body did. 



With the four of us lifting, Verrett was a light body. He was easy to drop over the rail and into the churning water below. 

  
  
  
  


# Turn 5:

I was in Dylan’s basement. Cameron was shaking my arm. Felix had the sink taps cranked up, churning the water to wash away his vomit. 



I could still feel Verrett’s fingernails. Still hear the shot and the bodies splashing. 



I looked down. My hand was shaking. The card’s edge was digging into my thumb.



Cameron said we needed to see who Dylan had been writing to. 



Cameron tapped the envelope.  The return address RICKY BOYCE INMATE 957762 MICHIGAN CITY INDIANA. 

  


\---



I stared at it. Felix stared at it. Cameron went on and on about a sick fucking joke. 



Ricky Boyce had some memory. He’d re-written the entire Sylvan Shores Game Manual on gray prison paper and two inch pencils. All sixty pages. 



Cameron grabbed the pages and flipped to the front. He knew what was coming. 



“There’s no way,” he said. “No goddam way!”



Our names were there. Credited, as promised, under: *Playtesters* and *Extra Thanks*. 



I flipped through the pages. Card descriptions fluttered past my eyes. I saw and read out loud the hell that bound us. 



**BOUND WITNESS**

*(Effect:)* The game enters a suspended state. No further turns until this player dies. When resumed, all pending effects resolve immediately.



“The suspended state? Have we…we been?” Felix asked. 



“Shut Up Felix!” Cameron shouted. 



I screamed to let him say it. Let him say what we’ve all known for two decades. 



The same thing I knew when I woke up in the dark. When I felt the odd warm breeze from nowhere. When I realized we never left the basement. Not until Dylan let us go. 



“Fuck you Seth, it’s not-”



“It’s just a game, Cameron! It’s just a game we’ve been playing for twenty one fucking years and we didnt even know it!” 



“All pending effects resolve.” I said. 



“What’s the last card?” asked Felix. “What was Verret’s card?”



“There’s no more effects, Felix. We’re here, we’re alive, it’s over.” Cameron said. 



I flicked out the card I’d been holding for 20 years. Their eyes went shockout white. Lights were on but nobody was home. 



“Verrett’s?” Cameron asked. 



I nodded. 



“We got out, didn’t we Seth?-” Cameron said. I grabbed prison stationary to read what I already knew. 



**MOONLIT CROSSING**

*(Effect:)* When revealed, the player becomes the **Goddess’** chosen messenger. They are granted passage to the Sylvan Shore, and are declared the winner. Congratulations!

  


Felix laughed. Cameron went pale and his lips turned into thin blue lines. He asked if it meant, oh my god, did it mean what he thought it meant.



Felix told him to just look upstairs. Take a look in the garage. 



—-

The air in the garage smelled sweet—an herbal, perfumed blend that didn’t belong here. I swept the bolt rails with my phone light. There—red nylon fibers, snagged and fraying, where the dog leash had cinched around his neck.

Below it, there was an altar.

A crescent of mismatched candles—fat, thin, jarred, and melting—encircled a piece of featherlight driftwood and a scatter of seashells. 

Carved into the driftwood, crudely but carefully, with the jagged edge of a shell:

“Where He Became Unbound.”

“Oh, hey there,” someone said from behind.

I turned. A man in a light windbreaker and hiking boots stepped into view, holding white, soft shells in his hand. “Didn’t mean to startle you. Usually I’m the only one here.”

“I…” I was at a loss. “I just wanted to see where it happened.”

The man held a smooth blue shell in his palm. “If you’d like, I have an extra…”

# Turn 6:

I held the Moonlit Crossing card all through his funeral. It burned like charcoal in my palms and heavy in my pocket. I knew I had to ask Mara about it, about Dylan, about everything. 



The calling at Flanner Buchanan was full of strangers. They smiled and whispered. The men wore gold pins on their lapels and the women on thin little chains. 



The small gold pins featured cresting waves. Others had elaborate seashell designs. They sobbed and bawled and I couldn’t get an inch of Mara’s time. 



They shook hands with Dylan’s family. They hugged Mara and everyone patted everyone back. 



I followed her home. I waited. I had to ask her. I gave her ten minutes and I felt like I would burn. It weighed a thousand pounds, it blistered my skin, I could barely walk upright holding this thing another instant. 



She was unloading midwestern feasts from a cardboard box into her fridge. Casserole cheesy potatoes, a platter of deviled eggs, brownies and blondies squashed flat and divided by wax paper. 



She asked if what we found in the box gave us closure. She asked if Cameron and Felix felt the same way I did. I felt for the dire card in my pockets.



I told her closure was always a long path. I said something stupid about the first step being the hardest. Mara nodded, absently rubbing her gold necklace. 



“You’re right, Seth. Finding closure can sometimes be the only way to move forward.”



She slipped a deviled egg into her mouth and stared through the window. Not a leaf or blade of grass swayed in the still and sunny air. 



“Look at those trees. Wow, would you look at that breeze?”



She grinned. She took a towel from the countertop to wipe the corners of her mouth before laying it flat next to the shells laying there to dry. 



Purple-spotted, yellow-striped, pale-blue, the distant shells were still half-slick in the drying light. They looked like exotic soap-suds on the counter, their ocean grit and sand clogging the sink.



“Mara, where did these shells come from?”



“Seth, I’m not afraid to say it. I’m doing extraordinarily well. I found a new path, and I’m not going to apologize for saving myself.”



“Did Dylan find these?”



Mara nodded. 



“He thought he might find something else, but all he came home with were those seashells.” She said. 



“Can I see where?”



Mara handed me her phone like a gift.  
  


A video was playing.



I felt it before I saw it—this breeze didn’t belong in a closed house, curling past my ankles like it had crossed an ocean to find me.



Verrett stood on a dark shoreline under a full moon, arms raised, water lapping around his ankles. 



The trees behind him bent into the breeze. The light of the full moon spun across him, flesh and robe fabric indistinguishable, as if he were emerging raw from the night’s pale chrysalis.



“He found it,” Mara said softly. “He crossed. And now he’s building us a bridge to the Sylvan Shore.”



I stared at the screen, unable to look away.  
  


 Verrett turned slowly—toward the camera.



Mara leaned close.  
  


 “Dylan told me something, you know. Just before he died.”



Her breath was deviled egg sour.



 She smiled, eyes glassy. “He said that Verrett would be proud of him.”



Tears were welling Mara’s eyes as a mute Verrett droned “Thank you, Thank you, Thank you” on repeat.   
  


 “For letting everyone finish the game. Oh, what a weight on Dylan, knowing that all he would ever find was just….”



A high whine and gurgle shimmied under the kitchen and launched out the sink. 



The drain bubbled once and blasted saltwater, black sand, shell grit across the kitchen. It sprayed and sprayed, until dark rain dripped from the drywall ceiling. 



Mara shouted. I asked her where the shutoff was. She was already moving towards the basement. 



Black sand flecked my body and saltwater burned my nostrils. 



The spray screamed tea-kettle ferocious and shattered a window. I was heaving at the stink of rotting kelp and algae.  



The walls dripped sludge and shattered shells as the spray eased off. I heard Mara shouting and laughing from downstairs. 



An ocean breeze cut right in through the broken window. I finally put it together.



Downstairs Mara was talking, laughing. I could hear her, and another, splashing in the shallow waters of the basement.



Mara called for me to come downstairs. There’s someone you need to meet in the water, she said. He was important, she said, I already knew him. 



They were talking, laughing, the voice alongside her all too familiar. The pieces finally fit.



Maybe I could join them. Maybe I would never have to worry again. I could just sink beneath the waters…



The card’s edges cut my finger. It was damp along the edges. For twenty years I’d kept it pristine. The ink was running now, the beautiful images warped.



I splashed water across the hideous thing as Mara kept calling for me.



The ink bled first. Words and symbols ran with the dust and shell ridges.



The paper softened and peeled to curls in my hands.



I let the last piece of the game go.



I just hoped it let go of me.

1l14ov8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1l14ov8/hr_we_were_all_alive_and_all_pitiful/,[HR] We Were All Alive and All Pitiful,"When Dylan’s wife Mara told me he’d died, I instantly knew three things:



One, it was suicide.



Two, it led back to Fall Creek Water Plant—where we killed Julian Verrett.



And three, the game Verrett started with us still wasn’t finished. Not even after twenty years.



You would’ve known kids like us: Cameron, Felix, Dominic, Dylan, and me.



Cameron, who got locked in closets for anything less than an A-minus.



Dom, who liked eyeliner, but enjoyed minor arson, and strong cigarettes even more.



Felix, fluent in three languages and in handcuffs just as many times.



Dylan, who never stopped playing the game—not even after we killed Julian Verrett.



And me. The quiet kid who transferred schools in November and lied about it being because of my dad’s job. 



You think anyone was going to connect the dots?



Not when Julian Verrett’s death was ruled accidental.



Not when Ricky Boyce took a thirty-year plea for kidnapping and manslaughter.



Not when four of Verrett’s former math students left school midyear for “nervous exhaustion.”



I slept in my parents’ room for two years. I didn’t step outside alone for another three.



Cameron finished school at home with a team of elite tutors. Felix vanished—until I got a call from boot camp, his voice practically giddy that he was free from his parents.



We never talked about what happened in the sub-basement.



And we never, ever mentioned what we saw happen to poor, doomed Dominic.



Not out loud, anyway.



Our parents went silent. And though I swore I’d tell the truth someday, I didn’t. I followed their lead.



That was before Dylan hanged himself with a dog leash.



And any chance at excuses ran out.



# Turn 1:

Dylan left a box for us. 



Mara told us he’d been collecting it his whole adult life. “Trying to figure out what happened to you guys as kids,” she said.



Everything he’d been working on was in a big black-and-yellow Costco tub in their basement. Mara told us we had two hours before Dylan’s family got in. 



Tomorrow they were burying him at Our Lady of Peace cemetery. Before then, she wanted the box gone forever. 



Felix was pacing. Cameron went quiet. I opened it. The smell hit us immediately.



Verrett’s Winston brand cigarettes, the mildew funk of wet paper, the stench of sulfur gas from the municipal water treatment reached out and wouldn’t let go.



Felix splashed puke into the downstairs sink. Cameron stared at the contents. An odd, sunny-day breeze swirled around the basement 



“Are those…is this from Fall Creek?” he whispered.



They were. 



I hadn’t seen the cards from The Sylvan Shore in twenty years—but they still slithered through my dreams, gold-edged and mold-slick, every week since I was fifteen. 



I never even knew how the game ended, except that the body count was three and rising. 



I picked up the rubber-banded stack of cards. I went dizzy. The smoke and mold and water smell bloomed. Felix spasmed and dry-heaved. 



I waved cigarette smoke out of my eyes. The odd warm breeze changed direction. I didn’t understand where I was. 



I was in a basement.



Yes. It was today. Right before the funeral. 



No. 

# Turn 2:

It was twenty years ago. I could feel Verrett’s long yellow fingernails on my neck. 

  


It started a quarter mile from the State Fairgrounds. 



We turned off Keystone and into the cracked-up Fall Creek Water Plant under the faded sign that proclaimed:



**EVERYTHING THAT GROWS NEEDS WATER.**



We hustled through the padlocked bay door.



Scrambled down the stairwell past the locked fire door.



Slipped through the dead-bolted steel slab marked:



**BACKWASH CHAMBER SUB B1.**



The sub-basement reeked. Mold, chlorine, and chain-smoked cigarettes pervaded. 



But here we were. 



Felix yanked, shook, and cracked a beer from a cooler packed with ice, and said this was exactly what the fuck we needed. Verrett said congratulations were in order.



We clapped for Ricky—he’d really set the place up.



Ricky grinned bigtime as he helped Verrett with his coat. Verrett lifted his good shoulder as Ricky gently pulled the sleeve past the bad one. 



Verrett’s shirt got hung on the butt of a revolver. I must have been staring right at it, because Ricky winked at me and covered it with a flick of Verrett’s flannel shirt.



Verrett was our advanced math teacher. He wore these huge steel-rimmed glasses, and always had one hand tucked inside a pocket. Students would whisper he’d been in a mental institution. That he was fucking loaded. That he had a false hand, and he'd cut the old one off himself. 



Verrett understood us. He understood that everyone in our little group  only got the wrong kind of attention from adults. For most of us, he was the first male adult who wasn’t constantly shouting at us.



“Before he was in my class, Ricky couldn’t even factor a trinomial. Now look at him, setting up our critical event with personal grace. I’d clap, ah, if only I was able.” 



Ricky was all smiles as he rolled up a sticky joint.  He ran our Dungeons and Dragons games, his plots drip-filtered from weekly LSD swan-dives. 



Dominic and I passed the joint pinch-to-pinch, exhaling thick cones of cannabis indica smoke. A week ago Dom and I dyed our hair—Lunar Tides Eclipse Black—over his moms chipped kitchen sink. 



Ricky said we should be really excited. He said he played Verrett’s game just one time and it changed his whole life. All that was left for us to do was  playtest the final prototype. And in return, all the weed, beer, and Dungeons and Dragons we could stand. We were all virgins but Dominic, and it was heaven. 



“Credit?” Felix asked. “You said we get credit?”



“Each one of your names, in Sylvan Shores Game Manual, on the very first page.” Verrett said. 



“For what, exactly?” I asked. 



“For refining the game.”



“So we’re just…unpaid labor?” Dominic asked. 



“On my teacher’s salary, this…is the best I can do.”



Dominic rolled his eyes. “So you’ll be the designer, writer, person who gets all the credit and money?”



“No.” Verrett laughed. His breath stank like coffee and mold. “Just the Translator.”



“Ricky said you invented it. What, did you and Ricky discover it on some acid trip?” Dylan giggled. 



“No. Oh, no.” Verrett said, tapping the front of his skull. “I just translated as it was spoken to me and the rules were placed into my head one-by-one.”



Everyone eyeballed each other. Is this shit for real? 



“By who?” Dominic scoffed



Verrett sighed, closed his eyes. He leaned back and sighed. “The **Goddess**.”



Some of the other guys laughed. 



I didn’t. 



A fist of ice squeezed my stomach as I thought about Verrett, the gun, and those three locked doors. 



# Turn 3:

This was how the game started. 



This is how every tick of the clock for twenty years was another turn, until Dylan waved the flag when he hanged himself next to his Toyota Camry. 



See, Verrett worked for the water company. Indianapolis needed an expert on pipes, flow, and pressure. So, you get Julian Verrett.



That’s how he had his accident. That’s how he saw the **Goddess**. 



His memory of it was just two distinct noises. Angry groaning from the lathe as it snatched his cuff, then one wet snap as his arm shattered, and his shoulder pried out of socket.



Verrett said the lathe whipped all the clothes off. He was cold and naked as his head slammed over and over against the hard metal saddle of the machine.



By the time most of his teeth were gone, and he was blind from his own foamy blood, well, that was when he finally met the **Goddess**. 



“She reached down, with one slender hand, from above the bubbling red death and clicked off the machine.”



He looked us each in the eye and reached a short, shaking arm out. “I could have never reached that button on my own, boys.”



He said the **Goddess** saved him with one hand, and placed a vision into his mind with the other. 



They scraped what was left of him off the lathe and got him to Methodist Hospital with twenty-two fractures, a cranium fracture, and one arm that would be little more than dead weight at best.



He said the game could pierce the inexplicable veil and that he, Julian Verrett, would be the one to bring the truth of the **Goddess** across this chasm.. 



He shuffled the cards plk-plk-plk. 



“Each one of us has the same odds. Every card is a moment in life moving forward from this point in time. Every play, a lifetime in miniature. You put your will to the test and win, or succumb, to the whims of the **Goddess**. Time to experience your future.” 



Pretty cards. Black White Gold Blue Red. Their names glinted and tantalized. The Twilight Bay. The Question of Seashells. Dashed against the Rocks.



A strong, warm wind blew through the chamber. Verrett gasped as they freckled the dingy floor.



 I picked one up - The Undertow. Gold fingers grasping just above the waves grasping for something already gone, catching only an ocean breeze. 



“Jesus, this looks unpleasant.” I said. 



Ricky lit a joint. “Tell em, Julian.”



“Some take all. Some give all. Only one card wins.”



“What does this one…do?” Dylan said, poking the edges of “Dashed against the Rocks”. He traced a woodcut image of a man battered, his body painting jagged rocks crimson as the seafoam below curled pink. 



“Instant death.” Ricky said. “The player is removed from the game. No further turns are taken.”



Julian cleared the table off. He unfolded a thick black game board in front of us, thin slots sunk to stand the cards up nicely. 



“But it has already been proven before I even start.” Julian began stacking out piles 1-2-3-4-5 for each of us. 



“Each card is destiny, sure as the tide. What will happen, has happened, and is always happening. But only I will arrive at the Sylvan Shore.”



Dom rolled his eyes and scoffed. He couldn’t possibly be sold. 



Verrett used his good hand to lift the gun from its holster. The room got so quiet all you could hear was the cigarette paper smoldering. 



“If anyone thinks they can stop what has started. ” Verrett said. 



“Bullshit.” Said Dominic, as Verrett moved the gun less than a foot from his face. 



“First turn. See what the **Goddess** has chosen for you.”



“Are you going to kill me, what if the game says I win?”



Verrett tapped out Dominic’s cards.



“Dominic, let’s find out.”



“They don’t mean anything.”



“Oh, they certainly do. You’ll see exactly what the **Goddess** has in store for each of us.”



“It’s a toy.”



Verrett raged. “Pick it up! The **Goddess** demands it!”



Dominic pursed his lips. He picked the top card off his pile. With a glance, he went pfffft, and flicked the card over his shoulder. 



Ricky leaned to catch a glance of it. “Uh oh.”



Verrett didn’t take his eyes off Dom. He asked what the card was.



“Dashed against the Rocks.” Ricky said. 



Verrett pulled the trigger an inch away. Long dark strands of his hair smoldered onto the game board. His head made a terrible sizzling noise as he tilted straight back. 



Verrett slid the barrel of the gun across our faces and shouted that we better stop crying. 



He told Ricky to clean up the mess. The odd warm breeze started up again as Ricky yanked Dom’s jacket up past his shoulder. 



Verrett stared right down the gun barrel. I tried to shout, but only dry yelps escaped. 



Verrett tugged a tight knot across Dom’s soaked head, jamming the denim deep into the hole in his forehead. 



Ricky grunted and shoved Dominic’s body over the rails and into the huge backwash pool beneath us. We watched the gray water grind away and churn red before the ringing in our ears stopped. 



Verrett said in a merry tone that it was my turn at the card. 



I froze, cell by dreadful cell. I remember wishing Verrett would push the barrel into my hair and pull the trigger. End this now. I’ll take my chances with the inconceivable. 



But this suffering was Verrett’s plan. 



In phone-jammed subfloors beneath the city, he held a smoking gun and the only keys to daylight.



We were going to play this game until we were dead or insane.



One turn at a time.



# Turn 4:



We were in the deepest waters. 

  


We had played for days—maybe more. Time collapsed under the weight of turns, rules, and the proclamations of the **Goddess**. I wandered card-born landscapes: colossal dunes that required my deepest secrets to escape, inlets that forced me to wade in early memory, a mangrove forest that rooted me to the tide until I shouted what I feared the most. 



We were all alive and all pitiful. We told Verrett and the **Goddess** everything, clinging to whatever frayed thread of self we still had.



Verrett cackled that the **Goddess** was drawing near. You could feel her, he said, in the saltwater breeze that spun through the basement like a warning.



Only Dylan and Verrett had cards left to turn. I saw Dylan muttering, lips moving without sound, like he was rehearsing something he’d never get to say.



Verrett was shaking, sweating, a vein on his forehead throbbing like lightning. 



“You’ll see the path she has for me. A moonlit passage to the Sylvan Shore.”



Ricky fiddled with another joint.  He’d taken control of the pistol while Verrett stared in ecstasy at the cards. 



“I don’t want to play this anymore!” Dylan said.



“It will happen whether you want to or not.”



“No, no, please, I’m all done, it’s too much!” Dylan was sobbing now.



Ricky looked up, coughing, his head wreathed in smoke. 



Verrett was shouting. “ You have to see the path the **Goddess** has laid out for you!” He was up on his feet now, jabbing his finger at the board.



Felix got next to Ricky. Me, Cameron, Felix locked eyes. It was right now or never ever. 



“Hey Ricky, can I uh, you mind if I hit that?”



Ricky peered at Felix, his red eyes thin as coin slots. “Ah, sure man.”



Verrett’s fingers tapped at Dylan’s card. “You’re only delaying the inevitable,” he hissed. 

Cameron was staring at me. Pleading. *I saw. I understood. I’ll kill if I have to.* 



Felix shot smoke across Ricky’s face. Ricky gagged, blinked, and Felix jammed the hot tip of the joint onto Ricky’s upper lip. Ricky yelped and Verrett turned to shout “Knock it off right now!” 



Then we killed him.



Cameron swung at the back of Verrett’s head. Verrett wobbled and went to the floor.



Felix growled and pounded his fists into Ricky’s face until his knuckles were stripped to the bone. Ricky moaned somewhere subconscious. 



Dylan jogged and swung his sneakers towards Verrett’s jaw. Yellowed teeth sprayed. 



Ricky went limp. I took the gun. 



Verrett was unsteady on his knees. Cameron and Dylan dragged him wriggling to the rails over the backwash. I put the gun under his jaw. I couldn’t squeeze the trigger. My breath caught. 



Verrett clawed his fingernails around my neck. 



Verrett moaned “Please just turn the cards!”



Cameron peeled the pistol from my hand. Hammered Verrett between the eyes. His eyeglasses burst into lenses and little specks of frames. 



“Come on! Come ON!” Felix shouted. His hands spooled blood. Cameron sneered as he and Dylan clamped down on Verrett’s leg. 



Verrett spasmed and kicked the table. Dylan’s final card fell to the floor— a man bound by chains and vines. 

  


Verrett arched his neck to see it, the blood running hot from where his eyeglasses raked off. 



I knew right then how to finish this. 



Verrett’s last card sat face down. His ticket to eternity.



I slid it from the table and, hiding the face, tucked it into my pocket.

  


Verrett saw me. His eyes went wide and wet. He sobbed.



Felix and Dylan held him down, rough. 



Cameron punched the pistol into Verrett’s face, hard. The rest of Verrett’s teeth hit the floor before his body did. 



With the four of us lifting, Verrett was a light body. He was easy to drop over the rail and into the churning water below. 

  
  
  
  


# Turn 5:

I was in Dylan’s basement. Cameron was shaking my arm. Felix had the sink taps cranked up, churning the water to wash away his vomit. 



I could still feel Verrett’s fingernails. Still hear the shot and the bodies splashing. 



I looked down. My hand was shaking. The card’s edge was digging into my thumb.



Cameron said we needed to see who Dylan had been writing to. 



Cameron tapped the envelope.  The return address RICKY BOYCE INMATE 957762 MICHIGAN CITY INDIANA. 

  


\---



I stared at it. Felix stared at it. Cameron went on and on about a sick fucking joke. 



Ricky Boyce had some memory. He’d re-written the entire Sylvan Shores Game Manual on gray prison paper and two inch pencils. All sixty pages. 



Cameron grabbed the pages and flipped to the front. He knew what was coming. 



“There’s no way,” he said. “No goddam way!”



Our names were there. Credited, as promised, under: *Playtesters* and *Extra Thanks*. 



I flipped through the pages. Card descriptions fluttered past my eyes. I saw and read out loud the hell that bound us. 



**BOUND WITNESS**

*(Effect:)* The game enters a suspended state. No further turns until this player dies. When resumed, all pending effects resolve immediately.



“The suspended state? Have we…we been?” Felix asked. 



“Shut Up Felix!” Cameron shouted. 



I screamed to let him say it. Let him say what we’ve all known for two decades. 



The same thing I knew when I woke up in the dark. When I felt the odd warm breeze from nowhere. When I realized we never left the basement. Not until Dylan let us go. 



“Fuck you Seth, it’s not-”



“It’s just a game, Cameron! It’s just a game we’ve been playing for twenty one fucking years and we didnt even know it!” 



“All pending effects resolve.” I said. 



“What’s the last card?” asked Felix. “What was Verret’s card?”



“There’s no more effects, Felix. We’re here, we’re alive, it’s over.” Cameron said. 



I flicked out the card I’d been holding for 20 years. Their eyes went shockout white. Lights were on but nobody was home. 



“Verrett’s?” Cameron asked. 



I nodded. 



“We got out, didn’t we Seth?-” Cameron said. I grabbed prison stationary to read what I already knew. 



**MOONLIT CROSSING**

*(Effect:)* When revealed, the player becomes the **Goddess’** chosen messenger. They are granted passage to the Sylvan Shore, and are declared the winner. Congratulations!

  


Felix laughed. Cameron went pale and his lips turned into thin blue lines. He asked if it meant, oh my god, did it mean what he thought it meant.



Felix told him to just look upstairs. Take a look in the garage. 



—-

The air in the garage smelled sweet—an herbal, perfumed blend that didn’t belong here. I swept the bolt rails with my phone light. There—red nylon fibers, snagged and fraying, where the dog leash had cinched around his neck.

Below it, there was an altar.

A crescent of mismatched candles—fat, thin, jarred, and melting—encircled a piece of featherlight driftwood and a scatter of seashells. 

Carved into the driftwood, crudely but carefully, with the jagged edge of a shell:

“Where He Became Unbound.”

“Oh, hey there,” someone said from behind.

I turned. A man in a light windbreaker and hiking boots stepped into view, holding white, soft shells in his hand. “Didn’t mean to startle you. Usually I’m the only one here.”

“I…” I was at a loss. “I just wanted to see where it happened.”

The man held a smooth blue shell in his palm. “If you’d like, I have an extra…”

# Turn 6:

I held the Moonlit Crossing card all through his funeral. It burned like charcoal in my palms and heavy in my pocket. I knew I had to ask Mara about it, about Dylan, about everything. 



The calling at Flanner Buchanan was full of strangers. They smiled and whispered. The men wore gold pins on their lapels and the women on thin little chains. 



The small gold pins featured cresting waves. Others had elaborate seashell designs. They sobbed and bawled and I couldn’t get an inch of Mara’s time. 



They shook hands with Dylan’s family. They hugged Mara and everyone patted everyone back. 



I followed her home. I waited. I had to ask her. I gave her ten minutes and I felt like I would burn. It weighed a thousand pounds, it blistered my skin, I could barely walk upright holding this thing another instant. 



She was unloading midwestern feasts from a cardboard box into her fridge. Casserole cheesy potatoes, a platter of deviled eggs, brownies and blondies squashed flat and divided by wax paper. 



She asked if what we found in the box gave us closure. She asked if Cameron and Felix felt the same way I did. I felt for the dire card in my pockets.



I told her closure was always a long path. I said something stupid about the first step being the hardest. Mara nodded, absently rubbing her gold necklace. 



“You’re right, Seth. Finding closure can sometimes be the only way to move forward.”



She slipped a deviled egg into her mouth and stared through the window. Not a leaf or blade of grass swayed in the still and sunny air. 



“Look at those trees. Wow, would you look at that breeze?”



She grinned. She took a towel from the countertop to wipe the corners of her mouth before laying it flat next to the shells laying there to dry. 



Purple-spotted, yellow-striped, pale-blue, the distant shells were still half-slick in the drying light. They looked like exotic soap-suds on the counter, their ocean grit and sand clogging the sink.



“Mara, where did these shells come from?”



“Seth, I’m not afraid to say it. I’m doing extraordinarily well. I found a new path, and I’m not going to apologize for saving myself.”



“Did Dylan find these?”



Mara nodded. 



“He thought he might find something else, but all he came home with were those seashells.” She said. 



“Can I see where?”



Mara handed me her phone like a gift.  
  


A video was playing.



I felt it before I saw it—this breeze didn’t belong in a closed house, curling past my ankles like it had crossed an ocean to find me.



Verrett stood on a dark shoreline under a full moon, arms raised, water lapping around his ankles. 



The trees behind him bent into the breeze. The light of the full moon spun across him, flesh and robe fabric indistinguishable, as if he were emerging raw from the night’s pale chrysalis.



“He found it,” Mara said softly. “He crossed. And now he’s building us a bridge to the Sylvan Shore.”



I stared at the screen, unable to look away.  
  


 Verrett turned slowly—toward the camera.



Mara leaned close.  
  


 “Dylan told me something, you know. Just before he died.”



Her breath was deviled egg sour.



 She smiled, eyes glassy. “He said that Verrett would be proud of him.”



Tears were welling Mara’s eyes as a mute Verrett droned “Thank you, Thank you, Thank you” on repeat.   
  


 “For letting everyone finish the game. Oh, what a weight on Dylan, knowing that all he would ever find was just….”



A high whine and gurgle shimmied under the kitchen and launched out the sink. 



The drain bubbled once and blasted saltwater, black sand, shell grit across the kitchen. It sprayed and sprayed, until dark rain dripped from the drywall ceiling. 



Mara shouted. I asked her where the shutoff was. She was already moving towards the basement. 



Black sand flecked my body and saltwater burned my nostrils. 



The spray screamed tea-kettle ferocious and shattered a window. I was heaving at the stink of rotting kelp and algae.  



The walls dripped sludge and shattered shells as the spray eased off. I heard Mara shouting and laughing from downstairs. 



An ocean breeze cut right in through the broken window. I finally put it together.



Downstairs Mara was talking, laughing. I could hear her, and another, splashing in the shallow waters of the basement.



Mara called for me to come downstairs. There’s someone you need to meet in the water, she said. He was important, she said, I already knew him. 



They were talking, laughing, the voice alongside her all too familiar. The pieces finally fit.



Maybe I could join them. Maybe I would never have to worry again. I could just sink beneath the waters…



The card’s edges cut my finger. It was damp along the edges. For twenty years I’d kept it pristine. The ink was running now, the beautiful images warped.



I splashed water across the hideous thing as Mara kept calling for me.



The ink bled first. Words and symbols ran with the dust and shell ridges.



The paper softened and peeled to curls in my hands.



I let the last piece of the game go.



I just hoped it let go of me.

1l14mtb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1l14mtb/i_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_of_7_months_because/,"I broke up with my girlfriend of 7 months because I found out she is poly, but now I'm conflicted.","I (M30) just broke it off with my girlfriend Jen(F33) I met last year after I found out that she is polyamorous, this should be cut and dry, but here's the kicker. I am asexual.

I met my girlfriend last year and immediately fell hard for her. We met at a bar after a concert and hit it off quickly. We had everything in common, and connected like I never had before with anyone.  We arranged to meet up again and began seeing each other quite frequently. 

I work late in a resaurant, so we were restricted to coffee and lunch dates at parks and art shows for the first month. When it was obvious things were going to be intimate I explained that I am asexual, and completely neutral towards sex. I'm not sex repulsed or anything, just don't care for it, and will never initiate or read the ‘signs’. I'm still willing to do it for someone else if I care about them enough. I maybe should've revealed it earlier but being ace has been a majority of reasons past relationships didn't work, and I'm still nervous about telling people in person (mainly because they have so many questions).

Fast forward half a year and things are going great. We are dating, staying at each other's houses, sleep together occasionally (only when she very specifically asked) and met each other's friends. She would do lovely things like make unique art for me, share music & TV with me, and even bought me a graphic novel by my favorite writer because she remembered such a small detail like my favorite writer which no one else seems to remember. 

So I get off work, drop into my friends bar just after midnight and after a little while I hear my name. “You're nattyhawkeyebum, I'm Jim, I saw some pictures of you on Jen's phone.” Ok, wierd I've never met him before, but thought she might've been sharing our dates. Then I'm completely blindsided when he says he's been dating her for 4 years! My face dropped, and he noticed quickly. He muttered something like “wait, you didn't know?” and trailed off. I couldn't even speak, so he said goodbye or something and quickly left. 

I stepped outside, phone her, and she admitted to everything. She's poly, has multiple partners, and has for many years. She said it wasn't a big deal because I was ace so we don't sleep together much anyways. I immediately broke it off with her on that phone call, and said I needed space so please don't message me for a while. 

It's now been a couple weeks, I'm hurt as I think I was in love with this woman, but this has changed everything for me. My friends say I should give it a chance because we worked so well together, but I think they just don't want to see me sad. 

Now I'm just numb, and don't know how to feel. I've been cheated on multiple times in the past often because I was ace, but this feels different. I fluctuate between never speaking to her again, trying to make it work, and maybe trying to simply be friends.

I'm sorry if this was long, I tried to give lots of info so I don't have to answer too many questions or updates to clarify. This probably won't come up on the pod, but this community has a wide range of opinions, and I really need to hear some of your thoughts. Love this community, and never thought I'd post on it, but here I am. Looking for answers.

1l14mg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AccountingDepartment/comments/1l14mg5/small_tools_equipment_where_does_it_go/,Small Tools & Equipment - Where does it go??,"I have gotten a couple of solidly different answers about this, and I am still unsure which to go with:

My company is classified as an ""entertainment"" company. We started designing and constructing escape rooms in 2016, but we have expanded to design and build other interactive art projects. For example, we own a ""coffee shop run by robots,"" which is an actual coffee shop, but also an interactive experience. And when I say we design and construct it, I mean everything. My partner printed the robot pieces, built them, wired them, and programmed them. We build most of our furniture, design all of our signs, etc.

The problem with this is that it has been difficult to determine how certain things should be organized, specifically small tool & equipment inventory. We seem to be an amalgam of 3 different business types (retail, food, & service). Here is how I currently have our inventory set up to record, followed by two questions:



Balance Sheet: Current Assets: **Project Inventory** (Raw Materials, WIP, Finished Goods)

Balance Sheet: Current Assets: **Inventory** (for resell, like Restaurant Inventory and Retail Merchandise Inventory; reflects in COGS once consumed)

Balance Sheet: Fixed Assets: **Large Tools & Equipment** (depreciated over 7 years into Fixed Asset Depreciation, then expensed, carried on the balance sheet)

Balance Sheet: Fixed Assets: **Furniture & Fixtures**

Income Statement: COGS: **COGS** (Restaurant Inventory Used, Retail Inventory Sold, Finished Goods Sold)

Income Statement: Expense: **Tools & Equipment Depreciation Expense**

Income Statement: Expense: **Small Tools & Equipment Expense**

Income Statement: Expense: **Building Materials & Supplies** (basically all consumable construction materials)

Income Statement: Expense: **Consumable Inventories** (for things like cleaning supplies, office supplies, etc)



1. Because the things we make are not intended to be sold, but used to generate service revenue, should I be moving the cost of each completed project to Long-Term Fixed Assets rather than Finished Goods, given that they will never actually be sold? If so, should I depreciate and expense them off when moving to Fixed Assets? (I feel like this wouldn't work because I have just expensed all construction materials, up to this point)
2. I have been expensing all of our small tools (anything under $500 that is used for construction; i.e. hammers, hand saws), then tracking them on a separate spreadsheet of ""non-consumable inventory"" to retain their value in the business market value, for any potential future sale. I need to know - is this correct? Everything in me wants to track them on the Balance Sheet, but I don't know where I would balance them, if I did. Some sources say, yes, tally them as Small Equipment and Supplies asset. Others say, no, expense them and assume you threw them away or they broke.

I really appreciate any input. These two small things have bugged me to death - they seem simple, but I can't land on what I think is the right answer. Thanks!",1,1748824763.0,AccountingDepartment,0,1.0,False
1l14mfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/x_Bloom/comments/1l14mfl/convince_me_to_pull_the_trigger/,Convince me to pull the trigger,"Greetings Folks,



Please convince me to either pull the trigger and get a xBloom or spend my money on other equipment. 



While I’m not a complete newb to the pour over world there are still lots of things I don’t know a ton about the more technical like grind fines and what not. My current setup is the OXO grinder that runs about $100(sorry I cannot remember the model), KINGrinder K6, and P1, Hario V60 and the Switch, AeroPress, Kalita Wave 185, Chemix and a Cosori Electric Gooseneck Kettle, and for espresso I have Breville Barista Express. Plus some various scales and timers. 



Essentially, the xBloom is an appealing option to hopefully upgrade my kettle, grinder and free up some counter space. At work a co-worker brought in a Fellow Stag and Kinu M47, the Fellow pours a bit more controlled than my Cosori and Kinu should be much nicer than “cheap” OXO grinder. I can say with the same beans my coffee at work comes out just tad better than at home. The xBloom might allow me to put most of my current setup in storage, ideally maybe just keeping the AeroPress around when I’m in that mood and the Chemix if it would fit under the water spout and allow me to do a batch brew with the xBloom. 



A bit more about my coffee drinking, I have the K6 dialed in for espresso, for messing with beans I don’t keep in the Breville(I keep Stumptown Holler Mountain and have the breville grinder dialed in for those beans). My OXO is my daily grinder for pour overs and I use the P1 while I travel. I am primarily a light roast drinker, and I like to try a variety of beans. 



So, some of the feedback on the xBloom I am hearing is giving me some hesitation, primarily what I am reading out customer service and one user getting a possible used unit sold to them as new. I love the idea of the xBloom, but I’m worried they are not going to be around as long as I would like and the xBloom is very dependent on IoT, if their servers go down, I’m worried this thing might become eWaste. 



I’m kinda starting to lean towards a DF64 grinder, I read that light roast does a bit better with flat burrs. Then maybe a better kettle with more control or something like the Fellow Aiden, even though the Aiden does not look as pretty as the xBloom. I also like that the burrs in the DF64 are pretty easy to upgrade if I ever wanted to. I could use the DF64 for my one off espresso grinds too, and in theory it would be nicer than the conical grinder of the xBloom. Maybe Idk, that’s what I want y’all to help me with. 

thanks!

Now that the new week has rolled over, I tried re-rolling for 4 times for Desserts in OGPP, but to no avail. I got Salads, Curries, Salads, and finally Salads.

At this point, I am frustrated and I decided to operate normally for the event next week. Instead, I'll try to focus on getting the ingredient mons I still need. Though such a huge waste on the bigger pot size.

so there’s a REALLY handsome guy at this place i frequent - let’s call it a coffee shop. he’s pretty chatty with most customers but for some reason doesn’t seem to speak beyond basic customer service with me. Im starting to wonder if it’s because I’m doing something wrong or being a stressful customer somehow? Or I don’t know if maybe it’s because he’s mirroring my nerves or thinks that IM the one who wants to be left alone (I’m quite shy myself and try not to take up much space/ keep to myself)

so I’m wondering, how can i shoot my shot without making things awkward? I don’t want to leave him with my number straight away - as I’m a regular and that might make things awkward in the future. I want to test out the waters before doing that but I’m not too sure how. 

also if he’s not talking to me but talking to others does that mean he wants to be left alone by me? I’m so scared that I’m doing too much by showing up frequently and that my interest is going to “leak” out of me and make me look desperate and creepy. 

how should i break the ice so he can get used to me and warm up to convo with me instead of keeping me at arms length professionally?

Two years ago I met a girl off of a dating site. She’s poly and partnered and I knew that going in. I’ve dated poly women before and it didn’t work out for various reasons.. most related to their NP changing their mind about being okay with keeping the relationship open. 

Well, when I met her I knew I was in trouble. She was gorgeous, funny, intelligent, incredible smile, the bubbly energy that can’t do anything but make you smile, too. We had amazing conversation and the hours would just pass so easily. Meeting for coffee in the afternoon turned into midnight in no time at all. We got along well, there was intellectual and sexual chemistry. We did home projects together and it felt like such a partnership. We didn’t do a whole lot with her NP but I’d met him and we got on well enough. Sometimes it would bother me that I would be so eager to help her with her home repairs and he would just stand by not volunteering to help even though he lived there, but I didn’t feel it was my place to say anything. 

In the beginning she was so eager to be with me. She would make comments about how we should go away together for a weekend. She made plans for the future with me and would say things like “this time next year we will..” or “when I travel for work maybe you can come along” “when we go camping this summer” etc etc. It was nice. I enjoyed my free time and when we got to be together it was wonderful. When we started dating and she told me initially about being poly, I told her it doesn’t bother me but the only thing that was important to me was being safe and not sharing my body with someone that was sleeping with multiple people. In that moment, she told me she was interested in dating just me and her NP and she was super eager about it. 

I really don’t know where things went wrong. Winter came and we both dealt with SAD. She was with me for some really difficult times (I had to put my soul dog down and she stayed with me through it). She didn’t seem to be super comfortable sleeping over at my house. I don’t know why, but she expressed a lot of stress about that. I don’t really like sleeping at other people’s homes either, but for me it just means I like to be comfortable where I am. Idk. We had a really intentse, emotional “love” session? After the emotional day from having to let go of my pup. And after that I felt her start to slip away slowly. 

Throughout the whole time we were together she would once in a while ask for some space and I would give it to her. Afterward, she would come back and tell me how she does enjoy me, and she does look forward to being with me, she just needed time to process. She was still hyped for Christmas but in Christmas Eve we spent some time together. The love making was different. Still good - always good. I remember her laying next to me smiling so big and telling me “You’re a Goddess” and I’ll never forget that. But after that things got more distant. We had tickets for a Broadway show she bought for us because she knew I’d never been and always wanted to. The day before the show she cancelled and sent me the tickets, told me I should still go. And she broke it off with me.

She told me I deserve more than she can give me and she can’t keep up with my level of affection. That I shouldn’t wait for her or read into it. That it’s nothing I’ve done and nothing wrong with me. She wants to stay in my life as my friend and see where life takes me but that she wishes we had started out as friends first. 

After this we still saw eachother regularly. We were kind of like best friends - running errands or I would stay at her bnb and do some work around there for her. Pet sat while she was out of town and we would do other cool classes or outdoor stuff. We would intermittently have these awkward moments where it was the end of the night and we would have a longer than normal hug and then kind of just stare into each others eyes. I felt a lot like she was waiting for me to make a move but because she broke up with me I didn’t want to violate that. So I didn’t. 

A month after the split we had a conversation because I was spending a lot of time with her and having a hard time not being with her. She said she needed time and she had a lot of growing to do. That she worries what other people will think about her “having her cake and eating it too” when it’s not fair to me to not have a full relationship. 

Anyway.. this continued on, us just being friends in limbo for a few months. Awkward moments where a touch or a stare would linger between us. Over the summer I mentioned to her again that I’d like to be her second or be fwb. She seemed really interested but hesitant and told me she would feel better about that if I was dating other people too. Edit: she was worried about my feelings but also what if she caught feelings for me and I met someone I wanted to be mono with? What would happen to her then? And I told her we would just talk everything through. She said “I’m not saying no, but let’s keep talking about it.” We never talked about it and we would get into conversations that started to get flirtatious- and just as they did she would shut down and stop replying. 

We went on a weekend outting in August. It was her, her NP and I and it felt like we were partners again. Minus the sex. There were some awkward moments for sure. Like people calling me a third wheel jokingly and me feeling badly about it and having to step away. But she was so tender and like herself again that weekend.. 

Since then, she’s slowly drifted. Around Christmas I got her a ton of things she loved. But I also gave her her sweatshirt back that I told her I was keeping when she broke up with me. I gained some weight and it didn’t fit as well. And it made me sad to look at. We hadn’t seen each other in a while after the holiday and then out of the blue she shared an event with me that’s coming up. I asked her if she wanted to go and she said yes but then when I was buying my ticket and asked if we were sitting or standing she said she wanted to go alone. I was hecka confused. Why share an event with me that you know I’m going to love and go to, and say you’re going to go to the same event, but not together?? 

Anyway.. I met up with her a month ago. My mental health is in a really good place right now as I’ve done a lot of therapy and medication adjustments. We had a really good time (I thought) and super open conversation. It was the first time we had seen eachother in 5 months. She told me how’s she’s dating someone new who is poly and married but it’s a guy. I was taken aback for a moment but I’m happy she’s happy. I so enjoyed having good conversation with her again and felt like we could finally reconnect and work toward friendship.

When it was time for her to go, I could feel the energy shift. We went from exchanging laughs and stories to her rushing to get home. Now it’s been a month since we’ve spoken. We are still friends on social media but she hasn’t responded to my text since that day and I haven’t sent another one. 

I wish I could stop missing her but I’m a spiritual person and I can’t help but feel like I’m not meant to leave her behind. Anyone else I’ve dated, I’ve been able to cut them out and not look back. With her? I don’t want to close the door but I don’t know why and I wish I could understand why she’s been so hot and cold. Like she catches herself having fun with me and then has to quickly change her mind frame?

Why say you want to be friends but you’re not being a friend? Why invite me to an event then tell me you’re going but alone? Why stay my friend on social media if you don’t want to have me in your life?

Has anyone gone through this with someone who is poly? I was for sure monogamous for majority of my life but now I’m dating as someone who is looking for a poly situation. I’m looking for a primary basically but anywho.. sorry for the story book. I just do so well for so long and suddenly she pops back into my head and I can’t escape it.

I got out of the military in 2018 weighing 240 lbs at a little over 6' 4"". While in recieved multiple TBIs resulting in memory loss, PTSD, anxiety, depression, headaches, and migraines.

      Now fast forward to January 2025. I got VA disabiIity after the joys of the years long processes. They recently built at new VA facility near me and started cold calling veterans in the area. I couldn't make excuses not to set up an appointment when they called. I weighed in at 452 lbs during my first VA checkup. My care team told my I was borderline pre diabetic. I think having them tell me finally woke me up.

     For the last six months I have been drinking only water. No cheats like coffee or ""flavored water"". I cut out everything that wasn't from my local butcher except obviously eggs and basic spices like salt and pepper. No bagged meat or meals that you can buy in the freezer isle. No preservatives, sugars, or weird chemicals. Purely chicken breast, steak, porkchops, or my personal favorite liver. No carbs.

    It sucked for the first couple weeks. Went through a lot of meat. I had my fridge filled and was constantly snacking. But after the first month I had already lost 25 pounds. I think it was a lot of water weight and all the clean meat I was eating instead of chemicals.

   After the first month it got alot easier. Having more or less flushed out all the garbage in my body I realized I wasn't as hungry anymore. I had a lot of energy. Wasn't sluggish after eating. As more time went on and the months passed I have cut my food intake to 1/2 Ib of liver for breakfast, snacking on chicken or pork during lunch, and 12 oz steak for dinner. And I feel fuller than ever before.

   I have kept strictly to the carnivore diet and I workout daily. Today I weighed in at 348 lbs. I plan on continuing and striving for 299 by the end of the year. My goal is 260 and then I plan on having surgery to remove excess skin to get me to 240.",7,1748823928.0,carnivorediet,1,1.0,False

Would like honest thoughts and insight.,"I just wanted some honest thoughts and insight regarding a situation with a girl I had a first date with. I'll do my best to recap everything that has happened. Regrettably, I believe I am just a validation/ego boost to her. There were mistakes that I may have done to have caused me to be placed in this position. But, I'd like to reflect and learn from this unfortunate experience. 

**\[Matching/Talking\]**

Sometime in early April, I matched with this girl 2 hours after sending a like. The conversation on the app was pleasant. She put energy into her replies. It eventually transitioned into me getting her number and we ended up planning a date for next week . I figured at this point the communication would slow down and we would end up talking on the first date. However, that was not the case. We ended up texting daily and even had a few late night phonecalls. This was nice, because this level of communication wasn't so common for me. A lot of matches don't lead to anything. I was happy, even if we both may have took a few hours to reply to our texts due to work during the day.

**\[First Date\]** 

So first, I got there a few minutes early. She was about 10-15 minutes late. She said she had forgotten about her nieces art show that she had to attend to. I was pretty chill about it and just patiently waited indoors. I had the flower concealed under my jacket at the time. When she got in, she awkwardly waved at me. Which I then smiled at her and as she got close I had asked how she was doing. She asked me how my drive was and I said long lol. I think after I told her I had something for her. Which I then revealed the flower and she thought it was sweet (While handing it to her I told her that I thought she deserved it since I appreciate how communicative she was. Which is Funny/Ironic looking back now on how things ended up.). I think after I let her use my phone to look at the menu. As her phone was slow. Which after she selected something. I went ahead and ordered our coffees. Once we got them we began to drink and talk. I mainly kept topics around trying to get to know her and just random topics. Such as her wanting a dog, how she wants to move to \[City\], how she is looking for a new job related to the degree she is pursuing, what type of town she would want to move into after her twenties, etc. And she had asked me questions as well. Such as how my job works, where I would like to go after being a Banker, what type of town I would like to live in, She also asked me if both my parents were together(She brought up that her parents were split.), etc. We stayed for around 50 minutes to an hour talking. As we were getting ready to finish up. I brought up something that we had texted about. Which was taking a photo together. She said that she wasn't photo ready. Which I took this as her letting me off easy. So I took the hint and said we can skip it while smiling. I then threw away our coffees once we were done. And we both got out of the building. I offerred to walk her to her vehicle. Which she declined due to her vehicle being nearby. As we began seperating to walk to our own vehicles. She said Thank you. And I said yeah, take care before walking in my direction. Once I got in my vehicle I figured that the date was solid at best. I thought maybe she wasn't into me and was surprisingly okay with that. I celebrated the victory that I did get which was getting a first date and getting her to invest some of her time with me. Once I got home, I basically just ate dinner and tried intaking a lot of calories to meet my calorie intake goal for the day. She ended up messaging me sometime later telling me that she hopes I drove home safely. Which I then figured that maybe the run wasn't dead yet. So I responded with just teasing her about her worrying about me. And even brought up that I missed hitting her with a compliment and hoped my small flower made up for it(When we were talking on the phone she mentioned how she liked it when men weren't afraid to compliment her by calling her cute on a date). Which I completely forgot to do. I did think she was cute. Which she responded with ""It works lol"" ""sorry if I was nervy at timessss"". I ended up replying back with letting her know that it was okay and that I thought it was cute. And told her that we should plan something for next time. That I would like to see her again. Regrettably, she never responded to this. The date was on Thursday I believe.

**\[Couple Days After The First Date\]**

The following monday, I decided to test the waters and reach out. I sent her a text telling her that I hope she had a great weekend. Regrettably, she stayed silent. The same day in the evening, I noticed that she switched out one of her profile pictures. I figured she had moved on and I deleted our text conversation and unmatched to start to get over her.

**\[A month Later\]**

Regrettably, one night I was feeling a little low and I decided to send out a message to her. Not expecting anything. Basically just asking why she had reached out after the first date? And that I noticed that the vibe was different in person in comparison when we were texting and on phonecalls. So I figured she wasn't really interested in me. I was curious and told her to not feel pressured to respond and that I would leave her alone and take the hint. 

The next day, I noticed that she left me on read. Which I figured she wasn't going to respond and had made my peace with that. It wasn't until a week later where I randomly received a message from her at 12 :00 AM. Where she basically told me that she wanted to finally get back to me and apologised for not responding. She said that it was honestly because she didn't feel like we clicked and she didn't know how to acknowledge that. She felt no connection. She added that it was so early to tell, but she didn't know. It was just a feeling like maybe it wouldn't work out. Especially since we seemed different in our long term plans. 

I ended up responding with telling her I appreciate her getting back to me. I asked if she would like to end things here. I added this part simply because I didn't want to live in regret. From the text message, she didn't seem very firm and slightly uncertain. So I shot my shot. And told her that I was willing to make things work out between us. Especially since we were both looking for something long term. However, I would respect her decision and wished her the best. To add context, our life plans weren't too different. I think the only conflict we had is that I preferred to live in a smaller town and she wanted to live in the city for the remainder of her twenties. Which I don't see as much of a conflict, because I could easily adjust due to my work. But, I can see this being used to lighten the blow. She ends up going silent on me. And I take this as her answer that she would not like to pursue things. And I make my peace with it.

**\[A Week Later\]**

She ends up texting me hi randomly sometime around 1:00am. I don't see the message until the morning and respond after getting ready for work. I simply respond with a ""hi, how have you been?"" She responds later that evening saying ""i've been good hbu"". At the time I wasn't busy just at the gym. So I responded a few minutes later. with ""Honestly, better than I deserve. Was there something on your mind? Kind of surprised me when I saw your text this morning."". She responds a few minutes later with ""wdym by that first part"". She evaded the elephant in the room. However, I answered her question and tried to see what was on her mind. My reply was ""Just got lucky at work is what I mean. Getting sales have dried up earlier this month and it kind of picked up for me towards the end of may."" ""But what's on your mind? I'd like to understand you if I can."" At this point it is Friday. And she goes silent. Only sending me another random message on Sunday morning at 2:00AM. ""hi hi"" ""sorry I keep texting late"". I don't see the notification of her sending me a text until the morning when I wake up. I had a 2nd date planned with a different girl. And I didn't want to sour my mood as I didn't expect anything meaningful out of her texts given her pattern of behaviour after the first date. So I told myself I wouldn't view them after this date. Unfortunately, the girl I was going on a date with asked us to reschedule. So without any reason to delay. I opened them. And yeah, it was what I was expecting. Her ignoring the elephant in the room. At this point, I assume she is rage baiting, or using me as validation. I decided to respond kindly. As I personally, would regret lashing out. I respond later that afternoon with ""Hey, it's okay. When would you be free to talk? I just don't know where you stand."" ""Sorry to double text, but if it would make it easier. I can tell you where I stand first."" She responds maybe half an hour later, ""sure thing, go ahead."". I thought her response was cold, but I kept my word and replied. ""To tell you the truth, I did care and I am open to reconnecting. If you truly would like to. I still wish you the best though. Even if the feeling isn't mutual. Maybe two hours after sending this, she opens it and leaves me on read. Which she usually leaves me on delivered. It is the current day when this had occurred.

**\[Reflection\]**

Given her pattern of behaviour, I don't expect anything out of this. I don't expect a reply and if I do get a reply, I expect it to be minimal and distant. Perhaps she wants me to end things or lash out for whatever X, Y, and Z is. Which is regrettable, because it could have much easily ended if she just stuck with ghosting with the amount of times she disappeared. By far this has been the toughest experience I have had with dating. Some mistakes I have done and why the outcome may be my fault.

\-I didn't Present the best version of myself on the first date. Regrettably, I got comfortable. I wore my glasses, my chin got irritated from shaving and so it was visibly red and dry. Additionally, I should have wore my shoe lifts. She wore platforms and she was nearly matching my height. I was only 3 inches taller than her naturally. Since then, I adjusted some things. I got eye contacts, I wear shoe lifts which allows me to no longer be short. Like with them on, I no longer carry that curse of being short. 5'10. And I started a skin routine and my skin has never looked better. It literally glows. With these changes, I did better on my following date and finally got a chance at a second date. 

\-Perhaps, I moved too fast on being sweet as well. The most damming part, is that I knew this wasn't a thing women loved. Yet, I got comfortable and did it anyway.

\-I shouldn't have reached out a month later after the first date. Due to this, perhaps this caused the current situation. 

I would appreciate thoughts. Thanks for reading this post. I expect to be fully roasted. ",1,1748823900.0,self,0,1.0,False

(FOR CREATIVE REFERENCE ONLY)*  

GALLBERRY COUNTY, Ala. — By Samuel R. Benton, Staff Writer, The Montgomery Ledger

Part of the ongoing series “Shadowlands: Dispatches from a Vanishing Alabama.”



The Screech Owl’s Driver

On a frost-skinned October dawn, Clara Eloise Bledsoe guided Gallberry County’s oldest school bus—children call it the Screech Owl—along the rutted ribbon locals know as Peach Orchard Curve. The 63-year-old driver, her hair the color of storm-cloud cotton, has spent two decades tracing that same serpentine route, “hauling tomorrow’s hope in yesterday’s tin can,” as she tells it.

Yet it was what Bledsoe met in the middle of the road last fall—not whom— that compelled me, 140 miles south of the Ledger’s newsroom, to sit across from her at a Formica kitchen table still speckled with biscuit flour.

“He lifted a hand like he was blessing the bus,” Bledsoe began, palms pressed flat on the tabletop, as though to still their tremor. “Only the blessing felt backwards, like a toll-gate curse.”

“He,” she explained, was Eustace Parrish, a reclusive former school custodian turned caretaker to his dying father on a remote tract of bogland locals nickname the Sump. By the end of the week, three children were missing, one was maimed, and Parrish would be carried from those same woods in irons, raving about a debt of eight lives a generation.



Silted Histories

Gallberry County lies two counties west of the Florida line, a place where red clay seeps rust into everything from pickup undercarriages to the pulp of wild persimmons. Its folklore, older residents say, is the region’s real bedrock, porous enough to swallow facts and exhale fables. The Sump, a peat-bog slough fed by tannin-dark creeks, is Gallberry’s deepest exhalation.

Legends—the sort found on back-porch swing nights and, lately, in the subreddit r/GallberryCountyTales—speak of a Sump Witch: a thing neither spirit nor beast that “tastes sin in the dirt” and calls for tribute when blood in the soil runs thin.

Sheriff’s records, however, point to a human lineage of darker appetites. Roscoe Parrish, Eustace’s father, was questioned—never charged—in three disappearances between 1979 and 2004. Neighbors alleged the elder Parrish performed “water-dowsing rites” in exchange for jars of creek mud. Deputies found no forensic evidence, and the cases petrified in storage boxes.

“Roscoe’s plot is the sour heart of the county,” says Deputy Harold Durrance, now sheriff, who helped search the property in 1989. “It’s the kind of land that rots boot leather in a week and hope a little quicker.”

Roscoe died last March. Two months later, children began disappearing again.



The Vanishing Week

Ledger access to the case file confirms:

	•	Oct. 27, 8:02 p.m. — Corbin Maye (13) fails to return home. Backpack located on a fence post bordering the Parrish property.

	•	Oct. 28, 6:44 a.m. — Three siblings, Hallie, Jase, and Lisa Lenox (ages 9, 7, 6) do not board Bledsoe’s bus.

	•	Oct. 29, 7:15 a.m. — Bledsoe’s bus stalls at Peach Orchard Curve. Mud lettering across asphalt reads FEED THE SUMP.

	•	Oct. 30, dusk. — Volunteer search party (two teachers, a cafeteria cook, and Zay Hawkins of Volunteer Fire-Rescue) discover a clearing on Parrish land. Hallie Lenox recovered alive, missing lower left leg. Parrish apprehended on-scene.

	•	Oct. 31, 3:33 a.m. — Authorities rescue Jase and Lisa Lenox from a hog-wire cage beneath the Parrish root cellar. Corbin Maye and a fourth child, Emerson Rose (11), found deceased.

What the file cannot convey is the texture of that clearing or the resonance of what Eustace Parrish carved into his own torso—glyphs like coiled sinkholes, each line crudely scabbed.

Hawkins, the county’s part-time arson investigator and a familiar hero of Gallberry lore, remembers pinning Parrish facedown in six inches of sludge while Bledsoe freed Hallie Lenox.

“I’ve pulled burn victims cleaner than him,” Hawkins tells me outside Station 2, his turnout coat reeking faintly of creosote. “He smelled like sump-water. Like the ground had started drinking him back.”



Eight or Drown

During a taped competency hearing obtained by the Ledger, Parrish spoke in measured monotone:

“Daddy tol’ me you keep the flood down with eight gifts each turning o’ the worm moon. He done taught me ’bout jointing so the Sump can savor. If I don’t finish the eight, Gallberry’s gonna drown black.”

Psychiatrists declared him acutely psychotic, yet one detail haunts investigators: Parrish had indeed abducted five children. Legends claim each generation must offer eight.

Parrish never reached trial. Three weeks into his commitment at Bryce Hospital in Tuscaloosa, staff found him split sternum-to-groin, chest cavity filled with wet soil alive with carrion beetles. Surveillance footage showed no breach. Official cause of death remains “self-inflicted evisceration with unknown implement.”

Gallberry folk say the Sump called its tithe back.



Chewing Under Asphalt

Bledsoe, who resumed her route six days after the search, now taps the Screech Owl’s dash twice whenever she rounds Peach Orchard Curve.

“Some mornings that asphalt shivers,” she says, staring into her chipped coffee mug. “As if the earth itself has teeth.”

She keeps an emergency kit behind the seat—tourniquet, flares, and one coal shovel. “Not for burying,” she clarifies, “for fighting.”

The county burned the Parrish home, excavated the cellar with backhoes, and poured gravel into the deepest pits. Yet every few months, silver paint or pond-slime script reappears on the curve: FEED THE SUMP. The road department removes it by dawn; no suspect has been seen.

Sheriff Durrance assigns the vandalism to teenagers. Still, he has petitioned for state funds to widen the shoulder and install lighting—gallows poles of halogen to chase off folklore.



Survivors and Reckonings

Hallie Lenox, now ten, wears a carbon-fiber prosthetic emblazoned with neon butterflies. At physical therapy in Dothan she tells other children she was “bitten by the woods.” Her mother declined formal interview but allowed one written question:

Ledger: What do you want people beyond Gallberry to understand?
Mother’s reply (hand-written, returned by mail): That evil can bloom in a man the same way kudzu covers a barn—quiet at first, then unstoppable if you don’t cut it back.

Cutting back, in Gallberry, often means story-telling. The subreddit’s top post this month is Bledsoe’s own account, transcribed by a neighbor and tagged #TrueCrime #SouthernGothic. Fourteen thousand upvotes, hundreds of comments.

“I wanted it out there before memory went murky,” Bledsoe says. “So folks can weigh it themselves—decide if what’s chewing under the asphalt is myth or man.”



An Unsettled Ledger

Driving north out of Gallberry at dusk, I pulled onto the shoulder at Peach Orchard Curve. There, faint as bruise-ink in the dying light, three damp words glistened: FEED THE SUMP. County crews had sprayed solvent; the letters persisted like lichen. For a moment I thought I heard a slow, deliberate chewing—water on rock, or perhaps night insects testing the air.

I tapped my rental’s dash twice—habit not yet mine—and steered back toward the highway. Behind me, the curve bent out of sight, a hungry comma in a sentence Gallberry County insists is not yet finished.

Whether the ledger of eight lives has balanced or still runs in red ink, no one here will hazard aloud. Yet in every interview, the story ends the same way Clara Eloise Bledsoe ended hers, voice low enough to settle dew:

“If the bog ever comes to collect,” she said, “remember we pay only in fear. And I’ve got little of that left.”

She has this dog Duke a big golden retriever with eyes that don’t blink right. At first I thought it was just me. But every night, Duke would sit in the hallway and stare into my room. Not like a normal dog. No tail wag. No panting. Just still.

Then I started hearing things scraping under the floorboards, breathing when I was alone. Duke never barked. Not once. I looked into it. There are stories. Skinwalkers, shapeshifters they use dogs sometimes. Test your boundaries. See if you notice.

Last week Duke stood upright for a second. I swear on my life. No one believes me. My sister laughed. Said I was being dramatic. But I know what I saw.

It was the third night without sleep. I’d set up a lawn chair in the hallway with a flashlight, a notebook, and a pot of black coffee I kept reheating in the microwave every 30 minutes. Duke would sit at the other end, just outside my room, eyes glowing faint off the nightlight.

I kept notes on his posture. His blinking. When he moved, how far. But around 3:14 a.m., something changed. I remember because I looked at the clock right as the fog started seeping under the front door.

Duke stood up. Not like a dog getting to its feet he rose, slow and stiff, like a man waking from a long sleep. His front legs didn’t bend right. His back arched and stretched until his silhouette touched the top of the doorframe.

And then he looked at me.

Not with dog eyes but human eyes with no soul.

He didn’t speak. He didn’t bark. He just tilted his head, and I heard something inside my headlike a voice under my thoughts, whispering in a language I didn’t know but felt like I’d heard before.

Then he walked back down the hallway, calm as ever, and the fog went with him.

1l1479z,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1l1479z/it_hurts_so_much_to_lose_her/,It hurts so much to lose her.,"Gabby and I met when we were 22. We'd both recently graduated from college. We were housemates, in a chaotic little house crammed full of people.

That first summer, Gabby and I used to sit together on the couch. I was studying to take a grad school entrance exam, and Gabby decided she'd join me and do the same. But we usually just ended up watching TV.

I remember Gabby's 23rd birthday. It was hot and sunny. We all threw water balloons at each other in the backyard, did tequila shots, went out to a bar, got too high and came home. At one point, at the bar, I looked across the table and Gabby gave me a huge smile.

I felt like there was something special there, but I ignored it because Gabby had a girlfriend. I didn't try to get closer with Gabby and Gabby didn't try to get closer to me. But it was nice being friends and housemates with her. I tried dating, but didn't meet anyone I really liked. To be honest, Gabby was always in the back of my mind.

Almost two years passed. Gabby's girlfriend moved away, they tried long distance for a bit, but quickly broke up. Gabby and I got together immediately. It felt so natural. We already knew that we shared a lot of values. I had a lot of trust in Gabby based on what I'd already seen from her. There was a physical aspect but the physical wasn't the most important. It felt more comfortable, relaxed, caring.

I thought Gabby was so special - she was funny, kind, smart, strong, independent. She liked to find the humor in things. She had her own unique perspective and wasn't afraid to be different. Gabby took our relationship really seriously too, told me that she wanted to be with me forever. I thought we'd be together forever, too.

As we got into our mid/late 20s, our lives changed. We stopped partying so much. We had more financial stability and lived in a better environment. We moved out-of-state so that Gabby could go to grad school. We didn't grow apart. We still had a lot in common, we still understood each other, we still spent a lot of quality time together. We still had shared values.

But something started happening. Gabby would absolutely lose her shit on me. Her triggers were: worrying about my health and safety, or feeling that I was choosing other people over her. For example, if she thought I wasn't eating enough, she'd demand I eat a granola bar right then, and she'd yell at me for hours until I did it. She'd call me names, make fun of me, sometimes throw stuff.

I think this was related to PTSD from Gabby's childhood. She talked about the things she'd been through as a child and how that shaped her. But she also felt like the way she treated me was normal, OK, necessary, not nearly as bad as what she went through. In a way, I wonder if she wanted to know that I could really love her, including the bad things.

I tried different things to address her concerns or de-escalate her anger, but nothing worked. It started happening more and more. I also started doing more and more to try to avoid it. Sometimes, I avoided things that I thought would trigger Gabby. Sometimes, I'd do those things and lie about it, which I didn't like doing. Sometimes, I'd do those things and accept that I was going to take a hit.

The triggers were things like: going for a bike ride, getting a coffee with a friend, eating a salad for lunch. This stuff didn't trigger her 100% of the time, but I had a sense of when she was more or less on edge. I was always doing a calculation in my head. Would she get triggered? Was it worth it? Could I feasibly lie about it?

This started to change the way I felt about Gabby. I didn't take what she said when she was mad seriously, because I knew she didn't really mean it. I started to see it as just meaningless noise. Just something I had to sit through until it was over. I started tuning her out even at peaceful times, like I literally wouldn't hear her when she was talking to me. I wanted to spend more time away from her. I saw her as something to deal with too. I kept thinking ""You're such an obstacle"". I started to resent her, because I was working so hard to try to deal with this, while she refused to do anything different.

I met someone else who I quite liked, and I didn't set boundaries. I didn't cheat on Gabby, but I was actively getting closer with this other person and having lots of thoughts and feelings for them. I was honest with Gabby because I didn't want to mess with her head or give myself space to cross the line.

I didn't understand why I wasn't choosing Gabby over this other person. I'd tried, too. I'd cut them out for months, tried to reconnect with Gabby, but still missed the other person. Eventually, I was in such a bad place that I just...broke up with Gabby. I didn't really understand why. I was just miserable and I knew I couldn't keep going. I still don't know if that was the right decision, or if I was just straying for someone else.

A while after, I broke it off with the other person too (to be clear, nothing physical ever happened). There were a lot of reasons why. They were in a serious relationship, too. There was a power dynamic, which I didn't like. I was upset and confused about my breakup with Gabby. It all seemed messy and I didn't like how they'd handled it. I also didn't like how I'd handled it, but I was trying to change that.

After the breakup, Gabby attempted suicide 5 times. The first time, she was with me, and I stopped her. She got committed involuntarily to a psych facility. She made it through the worst of it and she's getting her life back on track now. She has a lot to work through, even just to get back to being mostly OK. If she's ever going to address the types of problems that happened in our relationship, it's a long way down the road.

I'm still torn up about it. It's been over a year since the breakup. I still miss her. I miss being with someone who I shared almost all of my 20s with. I haven't met anyone else I like, how I liked her. I want to make her smile. I want to hold her when she's scared. I wish that I could have everything except the yelling. I really did love her as a person, and I think she really did love me. I would even take some yelling if she'd acknowledge it was a problem and work on it.

But when I go back and look at old photos, I feel scared. Looking at her facial expression, I can see the anger and I can see what's coming. I can't let myself be treated like that, and nothing short of breaking up was going to change anything. But it fucking sucks, man.",2,1748823536.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

I’m in the planning phase of our second trip to Japan for myself, husband, 5y/o and 2y/o for March/April 2026. We want to do 3-4 weeks, and are considering the following path: Tokyo > Kyoto > Hiroshima > Kyushu (cities TBD). Considering day trips or shorter visits to Kamakura, Onomichi, Nagoya. 

Last time we went it was myself (26 weeks pregnant), husband and 2.5 y/o. We spent 19 days in Tokyo > Kanazawa > Takayama & Shirakawa-Go > Kyoto > Osaka. We loved our stays in Tokyo (Ebisu), and Kyoto (Higashiyama). We did all the touristy things you’re “meant” to do when you visit Japan, but preferred to wander and explore the city by foot than rush around to different attractions.

I’d love to get some input on the “vibes” of the cities and areas we’re considering visiting. I’ve tried to look online but am often presented with lists of attractions rather than how the city feels to walk around and explore. Is there a good food culture? Nice cafes? Cool parks? Residential or business focused? Fast paced or slow & relaxed? Fun people? Nice to just wander? Like how you might differentiate between Sydney (beautiful, beachy, busy) vs Melbourne (arty, amazing coffee/food culture)

Sorry this post is a bit vague, I’d love for you to describe the vibe or experiences you’ve had in various cities or areas that aren’t a checklist of attractions to see. Obviously each person has their own experiences and bias but would love to hear them nonetheless!

1l145r0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l145r0/it_hurts_so_much_to_lose_her/,It hurts so much to lose her.,"Gabby and I met when we were 22. We'd both recently graduated from college. We were housemates, in a chaotic little house crammed full of people.

That first summer, Gabby and I used to sit together on the couch. I was studying to take a grad school entrance exam, and Gabby decided she'd join me and do the same. But we usually just ended up watching TV.

I remember Gabby's 23rd birthday. It was hot and sunny. We all threw water balloons at each other in the backyard, did tequila shots, went out to a bar, got too high and came home. At one point, at the bar, I looked across the table and Gabby gave me a huge smile.

I felt like there was something special there, but I ignored it because Gabby had a girlfriend. I didn't try to get closer with Gabby and Gabby didn't try to get closer to me. But it was nice being friends and housemates with her. I tried dating, but didn't meet anyone I really liked. To be honest, Gabby was always in the back of my mind.

Almost two years passed. Gabby's girlfriend moved away, they tried long distance for a bit, but quickly broke up. Gabby and I got together immediately. It felt so natural. We already knew that we shared a lot of values. I had a lot of trust in Gabby based on what I'd already seen from her. There was a physical aspect but the physical wasn't the most important. It felt more comfortable, relaxed, caring.

I thought Gabby was so special - she was funny, kind, smart, strong, independent. She liked to find the humor in things. She had her own unique perspective and wasn't afraid to be different. Gabby took our relationship really seriously too, told me that she wanted to be with me forever. I thought we'd be together forever, too.

As we got into our mid/late 20s, our lives changed. We stopped partying so much. We had more financial stability and lived in a better environment. We moved out-of-state so that Gabby could go to grad school. We didn't grow apart. We still had a lot in common, we still understood each other, we still spent a lot of quality time together. We still had shared values.

But something started happening. Gabby would absolutely lose her shit on me. Her triggers were: worrying about my health and safety, or feeling that I was choosing other people over her. For example, if she thought I wasn't eating enough, she'd demand I eat a granola bar right then, and she'd yell at me for hours until I did it. She'd call me names, make fun of me, sometimes throw stuff.

I think this was related to PTSD from Gabby's childhood. She talked about the things she'd been through as a child and how that shaped her. But she also felt like the way she treated me was normal, OK, necessary, not nearly as bad as what she went through. In a way, I wonder if she wanted to know that I could really love her, including the bad things.

I tried different things to address her concerns or de-escalate her anger, but nothing worked. It started happening more and more. I also started doing more and more to try to avoid it. Sometimes, I avoided things that I thought would trigger Gabby. Sometimes, I'd do those things and lie about it, which I didn't like doing. Sometimes, I'd do those things and accept that I was going to take a hit.

The triggers were things like: going for a bike ride, getting a coffee with a friend, eating a salad for lunch. This stuff didn't trigger her 100% of the time, but I had a sense of when she was more or less on edge. I was always doing a calculation in my head. Would she get triggered? Was it worth it? Could I feasibly lie about it?

This started to change the way I felt about Gabby. I didn't take what she said when she was mad seriously, because I knew she didn't really mean it. I started to see it as just meaningless noise. Just something I had to sit through until it was over. I started tuning her out even at peaceful times, like I literally wouldn't hear her when she was talking to me. I wanted to spend more time away from her. I saw her as something to deal with too. I kept thinking ""You're such an obstacle"". I started to resent her, because I was working so hard to try to deal with this, while she refused to do anything different.

1l13wst,https://www.reddit.com/r/recoverywithoutAA/comments/1l13wst/finally_went_to_a_smart_meeting/,Finally went to a SMART meeting.,"Some background: I’m almost 18 months sober. I came out of a pretty insane spiral of abuse of alcohol and other drugs while living alone. Working from home. It was bad. Repeatedly quitting and starting again for years. The cycles of shame and loneliness would trigger me over and over. I thought, repeatedly, that my failure to maintain sobriety was reason to continue drinking. “Might as well get another bottle.” Was my attitude.

And that sort of followed me into sobriety. 

I’ve spent the last 1.5 years living with two family members who are both recovering addicts. Both dogmatic supporters of NA and AA. And I admit I wouldn’t be here without their support and their allowing me to live with them for this time. They have both been so accommodating and so consistent in creating a living environment where I don’t even have the remotest temptation to drink. 

That said, they have both been very insistent that I attend AA meetings. And I was, on and off, for a long time. But The Program always just felt… off. 

What’s maybe funny is that my aunt and uncle were taking me to meetings in the beginning pretty regularly. At and the end of every. Single. Meeting. They assured me that meetings weren’t normally that bad or “like that.” They didn’t realize they’d said that every time at every meeting. 

It’s always the same to me. Meetings for AA always feel bad. From the very beginning, a huddle of people outside chain smoking and downing coffee, then inside, a sort of social club where I never felt any connection with anyone because I never felt like anyone was being genuine. Everyone is performing what they’ve been assured is the correct attitude toward sobriety. Everyone taking turns one-upping each other in their virtue signaling. It really felt like my time in Scientology as a child. So many broken and vulnerable people desperately huddling together with some mystical belief in what recovery is supposed to look like. 

Anyway, this whole experience turned me off of the idea of group meetings entirely. How could they ALL feel this bad? So, I just gave up genuinely trying. I kept attending meetings a few times a week. I used them as an excuse to get exercise walking to/from the venue. But ultimately I was attending to humor my aunt and uncle, and my family more generally.

Periodically, I’d look up a SMART meeting near me. And I’d sort of wave it off as being inconvenient, partially because I expected more of the same. 

So this weekend, my friend went out of town and asked me to watch her place. Nice little break for me from my aunt and uncle, as much as I love them. Lo and behold, that familiar feeling popped back up. I’m going to be alone and nobody to account to—might as well get a bottle. It’s so frustrating. 

Anyway, I was reminded of my trigger—loneliness and boredom. I need people to account to. I need something planned on my schedule.

All this is to say, I decided to just go to a SMART meeting since this was my first real urge in a long time. Found one nearby the girl’s apartment. Attended a bit apprehensively. Outside felt sort of the same. Venue felt familiarly humble and dingy. Walked into a room and found coffee and donuts and chairs arranged in a circle. Almost left but an attendee introduced himself. I appreciated being recognized as a newcomer because it implied the group is tight. 

Meeting felt very similar to AA at first. But I could immediately recognize the difference in attitude and language. Holy shit. These people are reserved, thank god, but genuine. No trauma dumping, but the sharing made me feel way less alone in my addiction. We basically just shared what’s going on in our lives. There was no language policing. No telling anybody to not share that they are able to drink sometimes. 

That’s all. Sorry for rambling. Just wanted to share my experience for anybody else also feeling apprehensive about trying other meetings. AA is ass. But meetings to feel grounded don’t have to be.",5,1748822676.0,recoverywithoutAA,0,1.0,False

#1 – Some stories are based on true historical events or inspired by real people the author has met and;

#2 – The author fought hard with the editors to help them understand the experience of transitioning—especially for the story Halo's Golden Circle and;

#3 – These books are available in English, German, Portuguese, Romanian, French, and Spanish and;

#4 – The stories were written to bring a fairy-tale-like romanticism to gay love and;

#5 – Each love story includes a moral lesson about love and/or dating and;

#6 – The stories blend cultural norms and expressions of love from around the world and;

#7 – They are now available as audiobooks, which means even non-readers (like my partner) can enjoy them and;

#8 – Russia used the book in its propaganda campaign to support anti-gay legislation, so FUCK YOU RUSSIA and;

#9 – These are feel-good stories with happy endings (and no, not the massage kind!) and;

#10 – They make great coffee table conversation starters, gifts, or prize giveaways for Pride events and;

BONUS #11 – Icon Empire Press is a proudly gay-owned publishing house in Canada. Supporting LGBTQ+ businesses matters!",3,1748822480.0,gaybrosbookclub,0,1.0,False

I simply stood up, froze, took a deep breath, walked to get a large towel, and started mopping up the damage. As I was trying to soak the most out of my notes, I began reflecting on how even a couple of years ago I would've started cussing, ten years ago I would have taken a few shots while yelling at the sky.

This started because I put a pencil into my electric sharpener and it didn't come out quite right which threw my hand into my studio mic stand which tipped over the mic which then somehow catapulted my red Swingline stapler two feet right into the side of my fresh cup of coffee. It's ending with me sharing how incredible the SOBER Method has rewired my brain. I'm personally stunned how calmly I handled everything. That included pouring a fresh cup of coffee, sitting down, and hammering out this share to you all.

It's easy for you to get caught up in the moment. To embrace the emotions that rush into your blood without warning yet the consequences are rarely good. Right? I'm trying to recall good that came from loss of control. Didn't happen. Step one in these situations is to freeze. Literally stop moving. Assess everything. Is anyone dead? No. Is there risk to my own life? No. Ok, now, what's the worst thing that just happened? For me it was waterlogged notes. Noting huge, I'll just pretend I'm working from handmade paper from the 1400's for the next week. Deep breath. Ok, let's clean this mess up. 

Freezing is the most important first step. Try it next time you think you're going to lose it. You just might surprise yourself with how good it feels to maintain calm control. Let me know how it goes!",1,1748822446.0,sobermethod,0,1.0,False

My letters are done and packed with each book. I'll send them off tomorrow. The most annoying part was cutting them down to size.

The letters still do bulge because I could only cut so much off without cutting off part of the letters but so what if they're not perfect? Nothing that's in that package is. Perfectionism is a parallel road to procrastination. I just need to accept when it is done enough. I said I would send them during June and unless the strike fully shuts everything down, that is exactly what I'll do.

The weather is still annoyingly windy and cold. It's supposed to warm up dramatically the rest of the week.

I’m 6 months PP with a full time job work from home and I don’t have the budget for a full time nanny. I wake up with LO 2-3 times a night and she uses my nipple as a pacifier (tried sleep training but don’t have the support or time needed to do that, I’d rather get broken sleep while she uses my boob to sleep). I go straight to work in the morning, get off at 5 and then straight to taking care of baby until next morning, rinse and repeat. Weekends I wake up at 6:30-7:30 because that’s when she wakes up. 

Her dad is not in the picture right now. I’ve done all night feedings since her birth and then also wake up with her in the morning at 7ish. Sometimes if I’m lucky my mom will take her and I’ll get a one hour of uninterrupted sleep before work. 

I don’t have time for anything for myself so I’m just a robot pushing on empty. I’ve been wanting to work out but finding the time or energy is a joke, I can’t even have a hot cup of tea or coffee. Sometimes I want to cry but I don’t have much time, so I give myself thirty seconds to shed some tears and then keep it moving. 

I can’t keep doing this and also be a good mom at the same time. I find myself hoping she’ll nap more (only contact naps) or sleep early so that I can at least sit still even though I can’t sleep. I don’t interact with her as much as I used to and I feel my patience slipping. Today I didn’t even have the energy to take her on a walk like I usually do in the evening so I put her to watch some TV so I can type this. 

I didn’t have PPD or PPA but I might be slipping into depression now, I have preexisting bipolar disorder that has surprisingly been at bay until recently. 

I love her but someone please tell me when I get to stop and enjoy some of this because right now I’m just a zombie and I’m starting to hate my life. I have nothing to look forward to except more work and sleep deprivation. ",4,1748821970.0,beyondthebump,2,1.0,False

I was a little nervous after seeing some of the reviews and comments, so I wanted to share our experience to add more of a positive perspective!

TLDR: It was the best vacation of our life



We are a childless couple and booked a balcony room, Fantastica Level, and booked the internet and drink package at the time of booking.

Our room was beautiful! We were on the tenth floor and had an immaculate view. 

The whole ship feels so modern with many bars and hangout spots. We loved the English-style pub called the Brass Anchor. We didn’t order any food but the drinks were amazing! My husband noted the good pours in his cocktails and mixed drinks, definitely not watered down. I don’t drink alcohol but enjoyed so many good mocktails on board. 

We also were impressed with the quality and variety of options in the Marketplace Buffet. It is always busy, but we never experienced long lines; lines moved quickly. We ate all of our dinners in the complimentary dining room and had a great experience! The food was delicious and service was great. We had a 9:00 PM dining time, and we were able to easily change it to earlier by speaking to the maitre’d on the first day. We did notice that there were potential long wait times depending on the night for those that had pick-your-own time, but we never had a wait.

We were both surprised with the Browse internet speed.

We read complaints about the service levels. We had the opposite experience. Everyone was so friendly and did such a great job. We didn’t pass anyone in the hallways, stairs, etc., without them saying hello.

We did not book any specialty restaurants and do not feel like we missed out on anything by not doing it. We did get gelato two days and it was so good!

We pre-booked a couple’s massage, and it was amazing. We loved the experience in the Aurea Spa. There was not any upselling until the end when they recommended specific products for us, but they respected it when we said we were not interested. (Generally - it felt like zero to no upselling on this trip. The photographers were not pushy when you walked by, helpful but respectful team members working in the shops, etc.)

Our trip sailed from Brooklyn with stops in Port Canaveral, Nassau, and Ocean Cay. The only “excursion” we booked was an umbrella rental at Ocean Cay. We walked to the beach at Port Canaveral and spent the day shopping in Nassau. We did not feel like we were missing out by not booking excursions. 

Ocean Cay was everything! There are so many beaches that it does not feel overcrowded. We walked to one of the northern beaches and it was really quiet in the area where we sat. I would 100% recommend renting an umbrella (cost us $20 pre-booking) due to the sun. The best part is the drink package extends to Ocean Cay and there are many bars set up across the island.

We did not book any speciality shows but did attend many of the free shows. There is a good variety of entertainment on board, and we enjoyed each of the shows we attended.

We drove in and parked at the terminal. Expensive - yes, but cheaper than plane tickets to fly to Florida as we’ve had for previous cruises. Easy to park, plenty of space, and easy to get out the day of disembarkation.

An anecdote that I think sums this experience up: on our first sea-day, my husband and I brought back coffee from breakfast to our room. We sat out on our balcony with our coffee, reading our books, and said to each other that it could not be any more perfect. Not five minutes later, the couple on the balcony next to us proceeded to air their grievances about the trip: the 90s decor of the ship (we thought it was modern), complaining about the ship’s schedule, complaining about the amount of people near the pools, etc. We were nervous for our trip after reading some reviews but here is our takeaway: it will be what you make it. We could not have asked for a better experience. Our experience was not everyone’s experience, and it may not be perfect, but it can be extraordinary. If you are considering booking Meraviglia, I could not recommend it more.

We previously have done four Carnival cruises so happy to share more of a comparison if that is useful.",10,1748821799.0,MSCCruises,6,1.0,False

[Bambino Plus & ESP]","I've recently got myself a Bambino Plus & ESP grinder (my first espresso machine, so I'm a newbie)..... I started off grinding enough beans to fill the basket, so once I had tamped, and then used the razor tool, it would just skim the top off the coffee by a small amount.

I didn't have any scales at this point and being a newbie I didn't really have any idea what ratio I was getting out, and not being an espresso drinker as such (mainly milk based drinks), going on taste was also difficult.

I have since got myself some scales to help with dialling in and I'm going on what seems to be the common starting point of 18g of beans,  aiming to get 36g out in around 25-30 seconds or so. I'm checking there are 18g after grinding, as well as once they have been tamped in the portafilter/basket.  However, I'm now noticing that if I check with the razor tool, there is a small gap between the bottom of the razor tool and the top of the coffee, so possibly less coffee going in?

So, should I therefore be aiming to get the height of the tamped coffee to be as it was before so the razor tool just skims the top again, or stick with what the scales are showing and ignore the razor tool?  Now I have the scales I'm getting about 36g out in around 28 seconds and the espresso tastes OK, as much as I would know anyway (before I had thr scales, so.e were nasty lol), just not sure if I would be better to add more coffee to end up with slightly more in the filter and it turn get a better result?",1,1748821571.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

We're considering trying again, but I'm in a new connection M32 that feels real, and can't do a hinge relationship with my ex. I'm doubting every decision rn. Can something even work here?","Soo... this is going to be quite the story that has been going on for a while now, I'm not a great storyteller, so it's a bit all over the place.. It's a long list of a lot of things that happened. And I'm aware some of it might sound CRAZY. It was. I'm conflicted and honestly a bit out of my depth.



I (27F) have been in a relationship with my 'former' partner (30M) for 7 years. Let's call him Jonas. We met in 2017 through similar friend groups and bonded over text. I had a boyfriend at that time, and things were going well, in the sense that I felt happy. Skip over a few months, and I lost my dear mother. Life was never the same after this, as we can all imagine. This is the time when I started to get closer to A. I'm torn and I don't think there's a ""Right"" answer, but I'd appreciate thoughts from people who have walked similar paths, especially around polyamory, healing, and navigating love after emotional entanglement.



We both had rough times, and it felt safe being together. I must admit that during my grief, I did skim over a few red flags, of my own as well as his. Let's just say we were your typical trauma bond relationship, bound by a need for someone. We were there for each other when we needed someone the most. Jonas and I loved each other deeply, but also ended up in some unhealthy patterns. There were moments when neither of our boundaries were respected. Mine especially around physical intimacy, money, and hanging out with friends. I stayed, forgave, and tried to grow with him. But in the end, it felt like I was erasing myself to stay close to someone I couldn't trust anymore. I have a few examples of emotional drainage.



A few things: For one year he helped me with my grief, depression, and financial issues. (Not with everything, I've had really good help from a friend who managed to help me clear my debts.) For another year I lived together with him and his dad. (His dad who was mainly away 5 days a week, we had a house we lived in and cared for.) Then I found a home, and the agreement was for me to live there by myself. But eventually he kinda, just, lived with me. For the last 4 years, I have financially supported us, as he did not have a job in the entirety of our relationship. I have only had a steady job, which I love, in the past 4 years.



I was never shy to speak my mind. In our first carried, I have openly said that I might be polyamorous and that was something I'm willing to explore when the possibility opened.

,

We opened up our relationship 4,5 years ago due to some struggles in the bedroom from mainly on my side. The decision was mutual, and we both were very inexperienced with open monogamy. The rules were transparency and clear communications, regular check-ins, but there were some instances where he kept pushing my boundaries to have me say yes to something he wanted. He in total had four sexual partners throughout these years. Whereas I had the possibility of three. I say possibility because each time something serious could happen, he was feeling very insecure. This, of course, is very much okay to say. So I severed my ties with the man in question and continued to support him and myself. I asked him if he could find out what was bothering him with me doing the same thing he was, and the answer remained ""Something about him feels off. I think he's manipulating you.""



The second man in question, I kissed, which Jonas was fine with. He didn’t express any major concerns, but what followed was a constant need for affection that started to feel clingy. I obliged, believing this was what love is.



And then I met Theo (M32), someone who feels like a breath of fresh air. He’s been in our social circle for a while and always made me laugh. One of our first interactions is still burned into my memory. As he became more involved in our community, we started hitting it off.



He asked very politely if he could flirt with me, and I responded, “If it stays as flirting, I’m okay with it.” He interpreted that as a boundary, a soft no. And so, he respectfully stopped. We remained friends. Then, a year later, I realized: I was drawn to him. His presence made me feel weightless. I liked his mind, his calm, his silliness, his honesty. He challenged nothing in me that wasn’t already ready to grow.



In August 2024, we began flirting more openly. Around the same time, Jonas was connecting with someone else playfully, flirty, and casually. It seemed, at the time, that we were both exploring.



Jonas saw the connection between Theo and me grow stronger. At first, he said he understood we even had a few sincere conversations about it, especially because at that time, I was feeling so disconnected. Our intimacy had dwindled to almost nothing, and we had both, in our way, made peace with that. I was broken, and we couldn't do anything about it. I remember writing to him that I felt like a ghost in the same room, and he told me he noticed that too. That it hurt him, but he didn’t know how to reach me either.



But after Theo and I kissed for the first time, the atmosphere shifted. Jonas's messages became more fragmented, more reactive. He said things like, “I’m not mad, just confused,” and “I thought I could handle it, but it feels like you’re slipping away.” He was scared, and instead of being able to hold that with care, I felt guilty. Even when I hadn't broken any rules that we had in place. The opposite even, when the first signs of doubt came to light, Theo and I spoke out about stopping whatever we had going on, but we weren't allowed to do so. Yes, we even said we're stopping, and it made Jonas mad. Those were terrible weeks.



To Jonas, it must have looked like I was leaving piece by piece. But from my perspective, I had already been drifting alone inside a relationship that had stopped reaching for me. Even when we were together, days on end, I felt emotionally isolated. Theo became someone I could talk to without carrying the entire room on my back. It wasn’t just about attraction, it was about relief. About being seen without having to justify my grief, my boundaries, or my joy.



Where it went wrong: Jonas asked for more access, more reassurance, more control. Eventually, he wanted Theo to step back. I wanted equality. He wanted to know who I loved more. I wanted to explore polyamory, to move forward without choosing between honesty and affection. He wanted me to shut down my connection to feel safe in ours. And I get it. I really do. But I can't go back to a dynamic where love means contraction or contradiction. Where trust has to be negotiated through guilt. Especially after my privacy was repeatedly violated. There were days I couldn’t even grab coffee with Theo without rehearsing answers in my head, terrified of what emotional storm I might walk into at home.



We(Jonas and I) had to end it after months of trying. The final straw? For the fourth time, Jonas asked me to erase someone I loved. This time, Theo. Jonas had gone through my WhatsApp messages without my consent. He set traps to test whether I'd come home when I said I would. And those were just the instances he confessed to. There’s love. But love can’t survive when it’s forced to prove itself through fear.



What complicates things further is that Jonas and Theo exist in overlapping social circles. We all belong to a tightly knit community, shared friends, mutual events, and even some professional intersections. When things were going well, this closeness felt comforting. But now, the tension bleeds into those spaces. People have started taking sides, even if quietly. Some ask me cautiously how Jonas is doing. Others visibly light up/look in disgust when Theo walks into the room with me. No one says it out loud, but I know they're watching, guessing, choosing.



It’s made me feel like I’m being split in two, performing calm and maturity for one half of the room, and joy and lightness for the other. I find myself hyper-aware of every gaze, every joke, every silence. Theo feels that, too. He’s told me, vice versa with Jonas.



Theo, for his part, tried to stay neutral. He avoids gossip avoids drama in his way. But he’s also firm: he won’t pretend to be okay with being cast as the villain in someone else’s emotional story. He wants to protect his own space, his dignity, and I respect that deeply. They hurt each other badly, and it means that any possibility of them being on good terms seems further and further away.



I’m caught in the middle of what used to be a shared life and what could be a different kind of future. Every decision feels like it risks losing someone. And yet, staying frozen risks losing myself.



Theo treats me with gentleness, presence, and consistency. I’ve started to come back to myself in this relationship. We don’t have the long history Jonas and I had, but we have something I’ve rarely had: peace. Mutual emotional safety.



Jonas and I have started talking again. There’s still love, real, honest, deep love, and he says he wants to rebuild. He sees where things went wrong. And part of me still loves him, even after everything. I believe people can change. I believe we can grow. And I don’t want to cut off something foundational to who I’ve become.



But…



I cannot be in a hinge dynamic. I don’t have the emotional bandwidth to mediate between two people who don’t trust each other.



Theo has no desire to interact with Jonas. He’s seen what I’ve been through and wants no part in “being patient while Jonas sorts himself out.” He respects my autonomy, but if I go back to Jonas, he’ll walk away.



Jonas, on the other hand, has said that if I “choose” Theo, he’ll respect that and remove himself, but it’s clear he’s hoping I’ll come back, and every conversation has an undercurrent of emotional tension.



And emotionally, I just don’t know if Jonas and I can build something new without falling back into our old power dynamic.



So I feel stuck.



If I choose Jonas, I’m risking losing Theo, someone who’s treated me with respect.



If I choose Theo, I’m letting go of a 7-year connection that, despite its pain, still holds a piece of my heart.



And I can’t “choose both,” because that’s not emotionally safe for me, and I think neither of them wants or can be in any kind of metamour situation. They don’t trust each other, and I don’t trust myself to be the bridge between them.



Being with Theo will result in not being able to attend a lot of social gatherings with people I hold dear.



On top of all that, Jonas believes Theo was part of why our relationship ended. That adds a layer of guilt, even though I never cheated or acted dishonestly. I just started to realize what it felt like to be seen, and maybe that made it impossible to keep pretending our relationship was okay.



So Reddit, what would you do with this?



How do I move forward when I love two people and feel like choosing either one means grieving the other?

Is it ever possible to return to an old love without betraying the version of you that finally learned to breathe?

How do you hold space for love without compromising your healing?

How do you navigate love when the stakes are not just personal, but communal?

How do you make space for healing without letting guilt become your compass?

And how do you honor both connection and selfhood when the room is watching?



I’m not looking for someone to decide for me, I’m just tired of feeling like the villain for trying to love.

But it felt hollow—rehearsed. As if he were playing the role of a businessman in a dream someone else was having. His shirt was pressed, his coffee exact. But he stared into the cup like it held answers, and all it reflected was hesitation.

The clock struck ten.

A knock.

He didn’t rush. He knew who it would be.

When he opened the door, there she stood. B.
The same B from the apartment, the same B from the blush on the couch and the almost-kiss. She wore a forest green hoodie, her hair up in a no-nonsense tie, her eyes already scanning the space behind him.

“You’re early,” he said, stepping aside.

“You left a note,” she replied, walking in. “I figured if I waited too long, I might miss whatever this is.”

He smiled. “And what do you think this is?”

She shrugged. “A project? A job? Something secretive.”

“That’s not wrong,” Mr. A replied, guiding her toward the table where two mugs of coffee already waited.

She took a seat. “So, what’s going on, Mr. A?”

He exhaled. “I’ve recently secured… backing. Quiet investors. People who see potential in unconventional ideas. I pitched them something new—a business that doesn’t exist yet, at least not in any traditional sense.”

“Okay…” she said slowly. “And you thought of me?”

“I never stopped,” he said without flinching.

She blinked but didn’t look away.

“I’m not offering a job,” he continued. “Not yet. What I’m offering is an invitation. To be here, at the beginning. To help shape something that might become more than either of us expects.”

She leaned back. “You know, when you talk like that, it sounds important. Almost too big.”

“It is,” he said. “But it’s also real. I’ve got resources. Support. And a network I didn’t have a week ago.”

She raised an eyebrow. “And you trust these investors?”

Mr. A gave a cautious smile. “Let’s say I trust what they’re giving me, and I understand what they expect in return.”

She studied him. “Sounds like a lot.”

“It is,” he said, then added, “But I have a portfolio now. And a client.”

B straightened. “Already?”

“She’s coming later today. Referred by one of my… contacts. She’s been overlooked. Underpaid. Ridiculously overqualified.”

“What’s the catch?”

“No catch. Just the first thread in a web I want to build.”

“And I’m not the client?”

“No,” he said, and his voice softened. “You’re the first invitation.”

B stared at him. Her defenses didn’t lower, but they shifted—like a door unlocked, even if not yet open.

She nodded once. “Alright then. Let’s meet your client.”

Mr. A underlined her name in his notebook.

Then flipped the page to prepare.

1l13bnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l13bnw/aitah_for_getting_into_an_affair_with_my_local/,AITAH for getting into an affair with my local pastor?,"About six months ago (January), I (M20) decided to volunteer at a nearby Baptist church to earn community service hours, which I hoped would improve my chances of receiving scholarships for next year. I talked to the head pastor (M39), and he agreed to have me help. At first, all he had me do was just set up tables, clean up the pews, and serve food at events, and it was only something that I would do once every week or so. I had a small crush on him at first, but I quickly found out he was married and had two kids, and as far as I knew at the time, he was a straight man, so I kept it to myself. 

However, I grew to like him platonically, he wasn't a harsh boss at all; he let me play my music, with my headphones and even out loud when I did cleaning. He would always say that I was doing a good job and tell me how hard of a worker I am, which made me feel good. He also let me have a free serving of whatever food was being prepared and even let me do homework in one of the offices when I was done cleaning. One day, he told me that if I ever wanted to talk to him about something, I'm more than welcome. Seeing that he was a pastor, I thought I might as well. So, one day, after a church bingo clean-up, I asked him if I could get some things off my chest. He said of course, and we sat down in his office. One of the things I asked him was, How would he feel if I were gay? He said that he would accept me, and I was still one of God's children. With how homophobic my parents were, that felt so healing and validating to hear. Another thing I talked to him about was how I can overcome how lonely I felt. He, of course, said that God was always someone I could count on and he would always be there for me, and of course, that there are people out there who would be more than happy to be my friend. But he also said that he would be happy to be my friend, that I could hang out with him and talk about whatever I want with him whenever I wanted. To be honest, I didn't have any friends in my university or any since middle school, and I cut contact with my parents for two years at this point...so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to have someone who genuinely seems to care about me. I figured he was just doing his job as a pastor, but it still felt really good. 

So after whatever task I would do, he and I would spend a couple hours in his office, drinking coffee, eating lunch or dinner, I would chat about the music I like and how my classes went and he would talk about what he's planning for his next sermon and how things were going with his wife, and his son and daughter and how they're doing in elementary school. He would also give me help on my homework and on how to socialize in school. However, it felt a tiny bit odd that he was only doing this with me and not anyone else in the church, but I wasn't exactly one to complain; again, he was my only friend. 

But, last Friday, I had just finished putting up flyers for an upcoming church fundraiser, and I came up to him to tell him. He seemed nervous about something and told me to come to his office. I was scared at first that I was in trouble for something. But he told me that he needed to confess something to me. I let him go ahead, and he said that...he was gay. I was shocked because I could've never in a million years thought he was anything but straight. I didn't get a chance to say anything as he also said that, he married his wife out of pressure from his parents. I told him I felt sorry for his situation but then he continued. He said that, he found me attractive. My jaw was on the floor, never in my life has anyone ever called me attractive and I'm not exactly someone you'd see on a magazine. But before I could really respond, he popped the question...""Do you wanna be boyfriends""? Almost reflexively, I said yes, and with that, he hugged me tightly and told me ""thank you"", about 60 times. Again, he was the very first person in my life to ever make me feel like I was beautiful, that I was smart, and he's one of the first people in a long time that I could call a friend and he is now the first person to make me feel loved. However, shortly after that, he told me that I could never tell anyone about our relationship, that if anyone found out, he would not only lose his marriage, but also his church and be outed as a gay man. And so I agreed to stay quiet. And he asked if he could kiss me, and I said yes...and so, I had my very first kiss.

  
After I left the church that day, I just felt joy. Not only do I have a best friend but now he's also my boyfriend. However, I've just spent more time thinking about it these past few days and...I don't know what to think anymore. His wife seems like a very sweet person, and I feel terrible that I agreed to betray her trust like this. But on the other hand, I finally feel like I have someone who genuinely cares about me, and it would hurt me to not only ruin his marriage but also to possibly have him scrutinized by the rest of the congregation and lose the church he worked hard to keep for so long. But as of now, I'm officially dating him, and I'm supposed to see him again next Friday. But I genuinely have no idea what to do or feel anymore.",0,1748820997.0,AITAH,11,0.5,False

Hey everyone,

I’ve got a 9-hour layover in Bangkok coming up — landing at BKK around 5pm and flying out around 2am the same day. I’ll have carry-on only, and I’m keen to make the most of my time in the city rather than sitting around in the airport.

Looking for recommendations on:
	•	Things worth seeing/doing with limited time
	•	Great spots for food or coffee
	•	Any local experiences you’d suggest that don’t require a ton of travel
	•	What area I should base myself around for those few hours
	•	Realistic timings (how long to get through immigration, transport to/from city, etc.)

I’ve never been to Bangkok before, so open to any tips — especially from anyone who’s done a similar layover!

Thanks in advance 🙏

1l13aw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/suppreview/comments/1l13aw1/why_your_joints_still_suck_even_when_youre_taking/,Why your joints still suck even when you’re taking supplements,"You foam roll.

You stretch.

You hit your mobility drills.

You even take joint support supplements with all the “right” ingredients.

So why do your knees still sound like bubble wrap every time you squat?

Why do your ankles still feel stiff after long walks?

Here’s what most people miss—and why your stack might not be doing what you think it is.

# 1. You're treating inflammation like it’s the only problem

Most joint blends throw everything at inflammation—turmeric, boswellia, MSM.

And sure, that stuff matters.

But inflammation isn’t the only thing that causes stiffness or pain.

Cartilage wear, weak connective tissue, poor synovial fluid, imbalances in movement patterns—all of those play a role.

If your stack only targets one angle, you’re probably leaving results on the table.

# 2. You're underdosing without realizing it

Look at the label.

500 mg of glucosamine? 100 mg MSM?

Looks good at first glance… until you realize most clinical studies used triple that.

Supplement companies like to list 10 “clinically studied” ingredients, but barely dose any of them properly.

It’s like taking one sip of coffee and wondering why you’re still tired.

# 3. You expect pain relief instead of better function

Joint support isn’t the same as painkillers.

But a lot of people expect to feel instant relief.

The real benefit often shows up in smaller ways:

* Smoother lunges  
* Less creaking when getting up  
* Better range of motion over weeks, not days  

If you’re looking for a magic pain off-switch, joint supplements will always disappoint you.

# 4. You’re ignoring the movement side

You can’t out-supplement terrible mechanics.

If your knees cave on every rep, or your hips are locked tighter than a bank vault, no supplement is going to magically unlock that.

Most people feel better when they fix form first.

The supplement is just backup, not a replacement for doing the actual work.

# 5. You’re using ingredients your body doesn’t absorb well

Turmeric is a classic one.

On its own, curcumin is poorly absorbed.

Same with generic boswellia or collagen if it’s not hydrolyzed or paired with the right co-factors.

If your joint stack is using basic forms without any absorption support, you’re probably just making expensive urine.

# 6. You’re expecting short-term results from a long-term tool

This is the big one.

Most joint supplements aren’t built for “feel something in 5 days.”

They’re built for people trying to keep lifting or hiking 5 years from now.

If your mindset is “fix my knees this week,” you're setting yourself up for disappointment.

But if you think long-term, like compound interest for your joints, you’ll actually start noticing the shift.

# TL;DR

* Most joint stacks underdose the ingredients that actually work  
* Inflammation is just one piece of the puzzle—function matters too  
* Don’t expect painkiller effects from long-term support tools  
* You still have to move well, not just swallow capsules  
* Real progress = subtle at first, then obvious when you stop hurting",1,1748820937.0,suppreview,0,1.0,False

4. I didn’t think I could be someone worth loving until they showed me how.
5. He wasn’t supposed to fall in love with his rival, but the line between fury and desire had always been thin.
6. ""You were the first person who didn’t ask me to choose between who I am and who I love.""
7. They didn’t need to say “I love you”.  The way they stitched each other’s wounds said enough.
8. Her heart ached in ways she didn’t have words for, until \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_touched her hand and everything clicked.
9. I didn't mean to fall in love with them. It just happened somewhere between Tuesday coffee and the way they said my name.

12. ""They called me confused, but I’ve never been more certain than I am when I’m with you.""

I’m always late by 5-10  min. Sometimes 15.

I’ve started prepping my coffee the night before. I also shower and pick out my outfit the night before.

I feel like the coffee makes me more tired and I think I’m “lolligagging.”
Sort of just so groggy and not fully awake.
But I look forward to my coffe because it’s relaxing and tastes good..

The road I’ve always taken to work is also becoming a pain in the ass. And takes so much longer. But my brain thinks it will take the same amount of time.

So my question is:
I have an iPhone and I tried to set my iPhone clock back 20 minute so I could trick myself. This would have worked except it ended up making me 20* minutes late. I know for a fact I set it back 20 minutes. 

I don’t really understand what happened and now I’m scared to try it again lol.
I think this could really work… (if I could get it to work)

Thank you :)

I’m her primary caregiver and her favorite person.

As we were finishing up with lunch, she said, “I have to tell you, I feel like you’re completely overpowering me, like I’m a baby or something. I’m an adult! A nearly 91 year old woman!” we talked through it- and I apologized for her feeling that way, explained that there’s different stages in life and she’s been an amazing woman, but now as a nearly 91 year old woman recovering from this fall, she’s frail and needs more care to be safe.

Said see you in 10 minutes and kissed her on the cheek. She appreciated it and felt better. Does anyone have tips or favorite phrases that they like to use with their dementia loved ones when loss of independence becomes upsetting?

I feel like we’ll be having more of these emotional outbursts because prior to this accident I was washing her in the shower and helping with a multitude of other tasks, but she was toileting independently although not wiping well and regularly wetting depends. They’ve had her in adult diapers that fasten on the sides because it’s easier to not have to take pants off and wiping for her in transitional care. I can tell she’s been having a hard time losing the small bits of independence she had left, but she’s not supposed to be bending over with spinal precautions and needs help with a lot more things that were hard but doable previously.

1l13301,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianRelationships/comments/1l13301/marriage_expectations/,Marriage expectations,"My boyfriend (28M) and I (27F) have been together for almost 4 years. About a year ago, I encouraged him to talk to his parents about marriage. This led to several months of back-and-forth discussions, primarily around horoscope mismatches and cultural differences. One concern his mother had was that my kundli showed signs of anger issues.

Eventually, they agreed to meet my parents but wanted me to spend time with them first. The first day went fine. On the second day, however, during lunch, they began asking me a series of serious, personal questions, such as:

“Will you be able to manage a household given the cultural differences?”

“Will you be willing to move wherever he goes?”

“Would you be ready to settle in our city?”


I answered honestly, and for some, my responses didn’t align with their expectations. During this conversation, his father asked my boyfriend to step away to get coffee, which left me feeling uncomfortable. My boyfriend later said this was normal parental caution and added that his parents noticed a change in my behavior, which they linked to the earlier kundli concern.

When they met my parents the following day, the situation remained tense. Due to language barriers, I had to mediate much of the discussion. His mother asked if I would be ready to perform Puja according to their customs. I responded as politely as I could that I might find it overwhelming since I wasn’t raised with those practices. She interpreted this as disrespecting elders. My boyfriend stayed mostly silent throughout, and the meeting ended early due to discomfort on both sides.

Despite this, we reconciled a few weeks later. He admitted he’d been unsure about marriage at the time and had gone along mainly due to my insistence. After 3–4 more months of dating, he again expressed readiness and spoke to his parents. This time, they raised new concerns: they felt I wasn’t very family-oriented, that I wouldn’t talk to his mom much, that I wasn’t social enough, and that I might not be willing to take care of the household so he could focus on earning.

From my side, I’ve always said I want to work and be independent. I’ve had the same basic job for five years, with no real career progression, but I still value working. My boyfriend, who is more career-driven and earns significantly more, felt I could consider a low-pressure job that would allow me to handle more household responsibilities. 

Eventually, he told me that continuing would require me to mend relationship with his mother. Given the earlier experiences, I didn’t feel comfortable doing that. When I asked for a clear decision, he said he couldn’t go ahead without his parents’ approval and felt that our ideas of marriage didn’t align.

Now, I’m left wondering: were these just temporary hurdles, or are these signs of deeper incompatibility? I also struggle with whether my reluctance to reconnect with his parents is unfair — or simply self-protection after a difficult experience. Even if I give it another try, I worry that this family dynamic might continue to create stress in the long run.",1,1748820309.0,IndianRelationships,2,1.0,False

You came into my life like an accident I didn’t see coming — fast, unexpected, and unforgettable.

It started with harmless chats on Reddit. You replied to my rant about loneliness with a simple “same,” and that somehow led to 3-hour calls, late-night comfort talks, and random “ingat ka, ha” messages that made my chest feel warm for the first time in a while.

You weren’t like anyone else. You remembered the little things — how I liked my coffee, the name of my cat, the way I always said “haha” even when I was clearly not okay.

You made me feel chosen in a world where I always felt second best.

And so, I fell. Hard. Quietly. Stupidly.

But just when I was starting to believe maybe — just maybe — I mattered to you too… you disappeared.

No goodbye. No warning. Just silence.

It hurt. But I convinced myself maybe life got in the way. Maybe you were overwhelmed. Maybe we just had bad timing.

Smiling beside you. Wearing the same hoodie I said looked best on you. Holding the hand I used to fall asleep imagining.

You weren’t mine.

You were never mine.

I was just the secret you kept entertained while she wasn’t looking.

I spent 8 years of my life here. I blinked my eyes, and now it’s over.

I came here as an 18-year-old kid moving into the old dorms that had no AC. Despite my newfound freedom, I hated it. Charlottesville was small and ugly. The endless construction and random abandoned buildings were an eyesore. My friends and family weren’t here. How could they be? No one would seriously live in a place as boring as this. The city felt isolated and lonely.

But having Bodo’s wasn’t so bad. And at least there were lots of trees and birds around. It was actually kind of peaceful without the congestion and noise of other cities. I could walk most places, but driving wasn’t impossible either. I came to dislike it less over time. Gradually, I even began to like it.

I mean, come on. Somehow this small city packs in the Blue Ridge, wineries, nature parks, arts and music, and coffee/pastries/restaurants that punch way above their weight. It's just big enough to find something you like yet small enough to find community. The red and yellow speckled trees in fall are surreal. The skyline is always blue. The colors here genuinely light up your life. Even the rainy days feel cozy. Charlottesville is so much more than UVA or downtown. If you stare long enough into the horizon, it nearly looks like heaven on earth. To me, it looks like home.

An interesting byproduct of the city centering around one continuous street (univ ave/w main/water st) is that I unknowingly moved linearly down the road over the years. On my last day, I quite literally got to take a trip down memory lane in chronological order. Nearly a decade of my life is cemented in these roads. So much has changed. People and places and things have come and gone, including me now. This quiet little city nestled in immutable mountains and rolling hills is dynamic and alive at its core. Only when you’re inside it can you truly feel that.

To anyone that moved here and is worried about ""what even is there to do in Charlottesville?"" - this is for you. This place is not perfect, but it's far from boring. If you're lucky enough to still be here, stop and take a moment to look around you. There’s a lot to be grateful for!

I hate the idea of counting calories or cutting out carbs. But lately I've been reflecting on my relationship with food. I was trying to eat more intuitively, listening to hunger cues and eating until I feel full. It wasn't working. I felt hungry all the time and I was eating past the point of satiety regularly. 

I've tried a few things recently and have lost some weight with no added excersise (that's a separate challenge) and without starving myself or withholding food. There's two things that I've figured out work for me:

1. Cutting down sugar!! For me, it's sugary drinks in particular. I love soda and sweetened coffee, etc. what I notice is that if I start my day with something sugary, whether it's a drink or food, I get hungry again faster and the hunger I feel is INTENSE. I feel shaky and sometimes nauseous so I have to eat immediately. I suspect it's because having a lot of sugar at once spikes blood sugar and the crash feels like hunger. I notice if I have a protein heavy, low sugar breakfast, I don't get that panicked hunger feeling after 3-4 hours. I do get hungry, of course, but I can manage and make better decisions when I don't feel physically ill. I haven't cut out sweet drinks or desserts completely but I avoid them in the morning and it's made huge difference. 

2. Learning to distinguish the feeling of hunger from the anxiety associated with it. Like I said, when I feel hunger it often feels intense and urgent. I've learned to associate that panick/anxiety with hunger. Sometimes I eat what feels like enough food and yet I still have that gnawing feeling in my body. So then I overeat. I've been paying attention to what hunger feels like and what it doesn't. Sometimes I eat enough food and if I still feel ""hungry"", I go for a walk with my pup or drink water (it's also really easy to confuse thirst for hunger). Usually the anxiety passes and I notice I don't actually feel hungry anymore. Every once in a while i actually feel hungry still so I have a snack or a second portion. My goal is not to under eat, but to learn what is enough food for my body without going overboard.  



ADHDers have a hard time with interoception so it makes sense that we struggle with things like hunger and thirst cues and rely on other sensations that may not be as accurate. I hope this gives someone a new perspective on their own relationship with food. ",2,1748820000.0,adhdwomen,7,0.67,False

1.Although it seems like forever… it’s only been 6 years of the Stew Crew.  Documenting every single second of their lives makes it seem so much longer… and this newest in-your-face-over-the-top version is the hardest one to take.  Carlin shows off her wedding pictures and uses AI to write an over the top anniversary post to Evan.  Kelly Jo also wishes them happy anniversary and thanks them for sharing their life with the world and bringing so much joy.  Carlin spends the rest of her special day selling the God cartoon app on the couch with Layla.  Layla watches Carlin read her script intently, and then attempts to mimic her mom when it’s time for her lines.  We see the Stewarts ready for church, and Carlin is pushing a link to her $40 Amazon dress.  It’s cheaper than almost anything for sale at BSB.  Evan also uses AI to throw some generic adjectives Carlin’s way on their anniversary.  He says he is so proud of the life they have built.  He really means the kids they created who are paying their bills and propping up this whole dog and pony show.  Carlin thanks Kelly for her post and says she has learned so much from her mother… you don’t say?  Carlin spends most of this week dropping content from Layla’s dance recital.  There’s a reel of Layla being surprised by her grandparents… except she isn’t really surprised at all, and only seems to be excited about this recital when the camera is on her.  In a sobering moment, Layla refuses to guess what her surprise may be bc she doesn’t want to be wrong… says she only wants to say the right thing.  What 5 year old fears that? Only one who has been forced to take multiple takes of a situation.  Carlin shares footage of Layla on stage dancing and someone comments that there was a no recording rule… obviously that doesn’t apply to the Stew Crew.  Carlin films while applying a full face of makeup on Layla for this recital and Layla says she is so ready to grow up and be married.  Sigh… the bar is in hell. We see Gil at the recital and he’s definitely lost weight. He fights through a conversation with Zade while Evan yells in the background as a translator… it’s obvious Gil has no clue what Zade is saying. Carlin is wearing another frock from Amazon and this one is $30.  Does this woman own a boutique or not?  For 2 weeks the Stewarts had to walk a slippery slope of keeping up engagement, while not selling anything out of respect to her granddad… and now they have to play catch up.  They do this by dropping an extra vlog in the middle of the week.  This one is fully sponsored by frozen bread that is outrageously expensive and Carlin eats it outside beside the pool that they go to great lengths not to show.  It’s just more recital stuff and about 20 minutes of Evan playing golf for Warden’s birthday.  They are at a janky muni course with Gil and Trace. Evan brags about his one golf club costing $600 and the commenters say he needs to buy Gil a nice club for Father’s Day.  They film a cookout at Zach’s house that happens the second Whitney leaves.  We see Evan taking Zade to buy “powpow” (flowers) for Layla’s recital.  In this vlog you can clearly see BOTH Carlin and Evan filming at the same time.  Carlin has to do most everything one handed bc the iphone is permanently attached to the other hand.  Evan admits that Layla was only on stage for about 60 seconds and she tells her dad she doesn’t know the dance at all, but just plans to watch the instructor.  As a reminder… Layla is 5 so every time Evan says “at this age” and “oh she’s growing up” or carries her around on his hip… he is not talking about a tiny little toddler.  Most 5 year olds can handle an entire dance recital, not just a short little blip of a feature.  The overuse of AI makes most of their canned content even more generic.  I don’t think they have had an original thought in months.  Maybe Chatgpt is handling Zade’s speech therapy these days, bc even though they get hundreds of questions from people asking about it… they refuse to mention it.  Carlin is forced to head to the boutique one day with Whitney for what they call “Content Day”.  This is when they film a bunch of things that will be dropped over the next few months to make it seem as though they are hands on and working hard at that shop… they are not.  Carlin can barely be bothered to even like the posts, and she barely wears the fashions.  Her new idea on Instagram is to share stories of fans watching their vlogs.  She seems ok with grown folks tagging her kids and watching them on big screens all over America… in fact, she celebrates it.  Carlin shares both Layla and Zade asleep in their beds… even shows their stuffed animals and it seems like such an invasion of privacy.  There isn’t one second of their lives that are private.  Evan has a paid sponsorship of the same countertop water filter that Zach was hawking last week.  This thing is $200 and after Evan fills 2 small water jugs, it’s almost empty.  Why would anyone want or need this?  In any case, he makes a reel of he and Carlin in bed to shill the thing.  If this family is at home… they are on set of the modern day QVC.  The selling doesn’t stop.  Carlin films herself fake crying about Layla’s recital a full week after the event has happened, and shares a link to a local spa where she is having a massage. 
 
 


 
 
2.Katie and Travis are heading home from Washington State which means lots of airport footage which is exactly like the last airport footage.  Back at home means back to the content mill and Hailey has a job singing to her baby brother while mommy films it all.  Katie shows Hailey singing when Harvey was a newborn and then her singing now, when Harvey is so very old… 7 months.  At least Hailey can sing her lines without the need for subtitles, so that’s something… I guess.  Katie takes a big step this week and wears an actual color… well, it’s a pale yellow, but it’s enough of a change for people to notice and comment on it.  Anything to break up the whitewashed monotony of her content.  She is slinging links for a fancy jewelry line that has hooked her up with birthstone earrings… and of course, an angel wing pendant monogrammed with her granddad’s name.  This is exploitive no matter which way you look at it, and super distasteful.  After filming the ad, it’s off to mid-week service at church where she films her baby… sleeping during the service.  Reminder that the Clark kids have to catch sleep whenever and however they can.  Katie drops a mini vlog of the family packing up to head to New Jersey.  It’s beach week with the Clark family, plus Travis’ sister is due to give birth to a little boy at any minute.  They are driving a rental mini-van bc the new SUV is in the shop after Travis was in a minor accident.  Katie tries to explain it, but Trav gets super sensitive and snaps that she made it sound like it was his fault but in reality he was parked and was hit by a drunk driver.  Originally they said it was very minor, but that doesn’t sound minor at all.  Regardless, no one was injured and the car’s sensors just need to be fixed.  All of this same content is shared in their weekly vlog, along with Kelly coming over to see their newly decorated screened porch.  Of course there isn’t a lick of color to be found and Katie over explains that the white furniture won’t be a problem bc they bought a stain removal package.  Remi the dog greets Kelly, and on her hind legs, the dog is just as tall as she is.  Kelly and Addee are going to be house sitting while the Clarks are at the beach.  Isn’t it odd that KJ is staying at her daughter’s house alone for the week?  Probably feels like a vacation compared to the dump that is the big house.  For about the 5th time Travis calls Katie “dumb” when they are laughing about something.  Wonder when that will stop being funny?  “Katie… you’re so dumb”… shut up Travis.  Katie takes all of the footage from the vlog and turns into a reel showing off the new porch.  If you comment, you are entered to win $500.  She says it isn’t sponsored by anyone, but it’s just another influencer trick.  They do this to get their engagement numbers up so they can use those numbers for a big ad buy in the future.  Everything they do is as fake as the muted greenery all over that house.
 
 


 
 
 
3.The Balkas are finally off on their next tropical content trip.  This time it’s Hawaii, and they’ve come along with the entire Balka clan so that they have ample babysitters to help them out while they set up their camera at various locations and dry hump each other.  It all starts with a mini vlog of Josie getting up at 3am to link everything she is taking with her and to tell everyone that this is the last trip Kelton took with his mom before she passed away.  Way to pull on the heartstrings while slinging sponsorships Josie.  She is so excited to feature her new $160 LuLuLemon viral long dress and says she will be wearing it her entire pregnancy.  In another vlog she shows the girls in their swimsuits at the beach with Kelton.   They go snorkeling and we see the grandparents and great-grandparents on the beach.  She’s selling the suits, the sunscreen… hell maybe even the sand at this point.  Back at the house it’s their night to cook and Kelton is complaining that the rental house doesn’t have any of his fancy kitchen gadgets and he is having to make do while grilling half a cow.  There’s lots of content of open windows with curtains floating in the breeze, coffee shops and snowcones.  We get a grid post of Baby Miles finally walking.  Josie says he waited to have the perfect backdrop to take his first steps.  Of course it isn’t a proper vacay unless Josie films a GRWM while she is in a super duper hurry.  She has just ten minutes to throw her pool noodle in her super long, dry hair but guess what yall?  After a few quick edits… she somehow manages to get full volume curls.  She also ends up with a flawless full face of makeup and the perfect bodycon dress for her date night with KTron the sexy.  She shows off her fully cooked sushi and then they head to the beach to film themselves basically making a baby… even though they already have… made a baby.  Carlin and Evan seem like siblings compared to these 2.
 
 
 


 
 
4.Alyssa Webster is the OG influencer in this family and don’t you forget it.  Even after quitting YouTube, disabling comments on all of her socials…. And filtering the actual body parts off of herself and her family… she was STILL able to score a free weekend getaway for the Webster clan.  She says it was to celebrate their 11th wedding anniversary but let’s be honest… it was really just bc someone agreed to give her the keys.  The home rental place forced her to turn the comments on to promote them, and this time, she isn’t overtaken by bots.  In fact, her comment count was super low so Alyssa was forced to go respond to each and every comment left to up the engagement.  The girls all clocked in and acted appropriately excited about a modern home in Boca with a pool and a swing set…. Pretty much exactly what they already have.  John bounced a ball around with his kids for exactly 3 minutes and Allie seems to be doing a good job caring for Rhett… he even eeked out a few smiles.  Of course, both Rhett and John are still wearing the sad hats… do you think they just pull a new one out of the box every day?  After their quick trip to Boca, Alyssa is back to living life through her “clean” filter and shows off what is probably a pink smoothie by the pool.  The filter makes it look like a large glass of frothy diarrhea and I don’t think she will ever truly understand how awful that filter is.  Anyway, she’s excited to have a “girl’s night out” in the broad daylight with a church friend.  Her over bleached hair is looking like straw these days and there just isn’t a filter to help that.   Someone comments on her rental reel asking if that house is really $1200 a night and how she expects folks to afford that… the comment doesn’t get a response from Alyssa…. Instead it gets deleted.  She wraps up the week by pushing a link for a protein shake after a 2 mile walk where she’s sweaty but in full makeup… I think what we are seeing is that Alyssa will sell anything, anytime, anywhere… and that means that as much as she may hate it….she is for sure a Bates.
 
 
 


 
 
5.Whitney Bates wraps up her girls trip by sharing pictures from Siesta Key.  We get all of the usual girly things like a boat ride, matching outfits, heart hands on the beach and the platitudes of already missing each other.  Back at home, Zach continues the heavy lifting of influencing by dropping a reel on Memorial Day featuring his hot dog chili.  All was going good until he decided to film himself eating the hot dog.  No one needs to see all that.  He also wants you to buy a $180 wooden cutting board that has to be oiled with a $50 oil kit before use.  This board has terrible reviews but when has that ever stopped a Bates??  Whitney says they are preparing for their yearly trip to Folly Beach and plan to stop by to check in on Janie on the way.  Zach has another recipe reel to share… this one he calls potato skins… maybe you have heard of it?  It’s a baked potato with butter, sour cream and cheese.  I wonder if he has 100 pound blocks of orange cheese.  Seriously, they should just buy a cow… of course with the amount of beef that they eat… never mind, never mind.  The weekly vlog features Kelly again.  This is supposed to be a q and a, but it is really just 30 minutes of Zach and Kelly Jo talking over each other and telling the same stories over and over.  All of the questions are either food related, or about Papa Bill and there’s just nothing new to say.  Kelly says Trace is the pickiest eater of all and won’t even walk in the kitchen if onions or garlic can be smelled.  She also says Carlin was her quickest and most painful birth.  Carlin is still quite painful today, actually.  Jackson was her longest birth at 30 hours.  She also says that most of the cooking at the big house is handled by Callie these days. They also say that they will still go check on Janie, but she has lots of other family around and that she is looking forward to being able to get out and travel some now.  Before ending the week in Charleston, Zach tries to wring out the last of the Lake Havasu content by showing himself attempting to golf on the putting green at their rental.  If I see a family of 7 with big cameras and microphones clipped to their shirts this week in Charleston… I will let y’all know.
 
 
 


 
 
6.Poor Lydia Bates is being forced to carry a pregnancy to full term and her content can’t hardly handle it.  She’s been saying she was at the end since she was 7 months, and she’s pretty much just out of things to say at this point.  She just films a day at home in the tiny house with Ryker and the cat most days… and of course, lots of gym selfies.  They head to parrot mountain for a vlog where Trace knows the owners and they get a VIP tour.  The last time they went, they got pooped on… so this time they are gun shy.  Ryker is traumatized and scared to death of the birds, but Trace soldiers on, filming it all.  He sounds like a voice over for a local TV ad promoting this place.  They let Ryker pick a stuffed bird to take home and of course he chooses the white cockatoo.  In a sea of colorful stuffed parrots… he instinctively knows to pick the white one.  Lydia’s job is done.  At her weekly doctor appointment, she musters up the nerve to leave her iphone rolling, but it’s pointed at her shirt.  I wonder if her doctor consented to being filmed.  If Lydia wants to be as big as Carlin and Evan, she has to get over that fear and stick the phone right in the doctor’s face! In another vlog, Lydia and Trace sit in the kitchen and talk to the camera while Maui the cat climbs around behind them on their countertops.  They say she is 38 weeks pregnant and the baby could come anytime.  They are naming the baby Kaia Rae.  Her name means “pure” which we know is the highest compliment in all of fundie world.  Remember when Trace told us that in their marriage he has the final say on all big decisions?  Well, here they tell us that Lydia wanted to wait until after the baby was born to announce her name, but he wanted to announce now… so they did.  The vlog is sponsored by yet another protein powder.  If you shake Trace Bates a cloud of protein powder would fluff up all around him. Lydia heads to her sisters’ dance recital and then spends the rest of the weekend curb walking, desperately trying to go into labor before it is time to drop another vlog.
 
 
 


 
 
7.Michael and Brandon are riding the high of their last vlog that is well on its way to 200,000 views.  Michael even gets to sling a link this week, so their influencer dreams are definitely coming true.  Brandon may be out of that warehouse before he knows it.  She is selling Alani drinks by tagging them on top of a picture of her foster child’s hands… while saying how blessed she is.  In a grid post, she wraps up her May… there are lots of pictures of Zach and Whit’s kids, so now we know who kept the 5 of them while their parents vacayed in MAGA land.  People are clamoring for more information on the new babies in her comments, but her lips are sealed.  Rest assured though… when she CAN show them… she WILL.
 
 
 


 
 
8.Lawson and Tiffany must really need to feather their nest bc they have dropped 2 YouTube vlogs in less than 2 weeks.  Even with all of that footage, they are still running about 2 months behind.  The first vlog is all about Lawson singing at the Tennessee baseball game and that has just about been beaten to death.  He also shows the house that is being renovated near the big house and solves the mystery surrounding that project.  Lawson says it is a small house that was left behind when Gil purchased the initial 30 acres.  They have wanted to remodel for quite some time and are now getting it done.  They never say who it is for, but it is a good ways away from the big house and higher up on the mountain.  On Memorial Day he stands under his American Flag for a photo with Baby Will who is in the ever present backpack.  Tiffy shows off some gross salmon dinner she cooked and the salmon is actually weeping over the green pesto pasta it’s sitting on top of.  They spend all week teasing a huge life update that never comes.  Both of them are now full time pregnancy baiting and every time they turn the camera on it’s “2 under 2” or some other mess.  Of course Tiffany films several cringe inducing reels, including ones where she says she and Lawson used to be lovers but are now just nursery coworkers, and another where she shows old footage of her on a set and says the names that she has been called.  Her favorite is “TiffyTaffy” and that should tell you all you need to know about this try hard.  She shows herself in 2017 working as an actress holding a snake, and how she is today… frumpy on the couch with a baby.  The girl seems to be having something of an identity crisis… I imagine being married to Lawson would cause all sorts of self doubt. Lawson shows himself working on vlog number 2 and says that Tiffany has served him all of his favorite snacks while he “works so hard”.  Anyway, the second vlog is a q and a.  He has a dog treat sponsor for this one which means Duke the dog is front and center… so convenient.  They sit at the piano and face the camera.  Behind them, taped to the big letter B, are ultrasound pictures.  It’s obviously meant to bait the audience as Lawson has to point out that it’s there.  They talk around all of the real answers, including saying that Tiffany has a house in California that is part of her “real estate management”.  They both say big changes are coming this year and that they may live part time in California bc Tiffy doesn’t like the cold Winters.  He shows a question about how they make their money… and doesn’t answer it.  The entire time they both tease a pregnancy… Lawson even says that he called the 5 Bates pregnancies happening this year, and wouldn’t be surprised to learn there is a 6th.  He plans to teach Will to play piano himself.  They show Lawson recording his Grandpa song and show I Love You Day but who can stand to sit through that again 4 months after it happened??  He says he has encouraged his parents to write a book so that may be on the horizon.  In current time, they are in California where Tiffy films herself getting off the plane with Will in that dern container again.  Let the kid be free!
 
 
 


 
 
9.Erin is back on IG this week reposting her mom’s repost of their last vlogs.  She also shares a sermon from Preacher Chad about how good is the enemy of best.  Christians shouldn’t accept “good” and should strive for “best”… why does it always seem that these sermons are pointed directly at her siblings?  She’s down at it selling her beef fat lotion and even though it was just on sale, she puts it on sale again and says she doesn’t do this very often.  In a new YouTube vlog filmed just after they announced their pregnancy, Chad and Erin explain that they didn’t get to tell their kids they were expecting… bc the kids figured it out.  They seem shocked by this fact.  They claim that Carles told them the siblings had been meeting privately to pray for another sibling and now Erin believes that is why she was blessed with another baby.  Sure, Erin, whatever you say.  It had nothing to do with not using birth control and being bored as hell.  Michael is there helping with the children and she comes up with the idea of gifting them all nesting dolls with the gender of the new baby inside the smallest doll.  The kids all line up like dutiful little statues and follow directions meticulously…. Except the dolls are hard to get into and Chad ends up ripping them all open and they scream and holler in disbelief that baby #7 is a boy.  Erin has 4 little sistermoms to help with the 3 boys.  Life is good.  They call Lydia, Alyssa, Josie, Gil and Kelly Jo (separately), Katie and Tori to share their excitement.  No one really seems shocked. The vlog has 93,000 views in just 12 hours so it is pretty obvious that Chad needs to get out of Erin’s way and let her be the YouTube queen she is meant to be.
 
 
 


 
 
10.Bits and Bytes…Nathan is flying some serious big money businessmen all around the world and those connections netted him and Esther an invitation to a huge MAGA wedding of a SpaceX engineer held at the base of the rocket.  Esther got to wear a prom dress and Nathan had a perma grin plastered on his face….Kelly reposts Zach’s lemonade pie recipe and then Zach reposts the repost…On Memorial Day we get a picture of JebJud standing on the roof of a truck waving an American Flag.  The big house is in the background, still decked out with Christmas lights…Tori’s son Slade turns one and Kelly Joe says he has an army of siblings to love and care for him.  No mention of a mother or a father…
 
 
Do you know how the men in this family hold their pants up?  With a BIBLE BELT!  Have a great week friends!

Also incredibly complex, even in its base form. (I’m on console for now) I’m 40 hours into my second attempt at a Sandbox session. AI, Pirates, Traders all ON. Man, there is a lot to do.

I feel like I’m just getting started at 50k Population, 10 Islands, 10k Investor Population, $300Million in the bank and $300k/min Income. I’ve wiped out 2/3 AI countries and am preparing to take over the 3rd. (Arthur)  Here are my current Questions --



1. What is defined as “End Game” on base console edition. 

2. What happens when I wipe out the 3rd AI? Can I keep playing?

3. I don't utilize Items (with the exception of naval) I’ve gotten my economy to work without them and I prefer to save the influence points for my Military. Is this going to hurt me in the long run? 

4. What items do you guys buy from traders regularly Mid Game? (Coffee/Sewing Machines/Chocolate?)

Anything helps! Didn’t realize this franchise had such a big community online. Cheers!

Carlin shares both Layla and Zade asleep in their beds… even shows their stuffed animals and it seems like such an invasion of privacy.  There isn’t one second of their lives that are private.  Evan has a paid sponsorship of the same countertop water filter that Zach was hawking last week.  This thing is $200 and after Evan fills 2 small water jugs, it’s almost empty.  Why would anyone want or need this?  In any case, he makes a reel of he and Carlin in bed to shill the thing.  If this family is at home… they are on set of the modern day QVC.  The selling doesn’t stop.  Carlin films herself fake crying about Layla’s recital a full week after the event has happened, and shares a link to a local spa where she is having a massage. 
 
 


 
 
2.Katie and Travis are heading home from Washington State which means lots of airport footage which is exactly like the last airport footage.  Back at home means back to the content mill and Hailey has a job singing to her baby brother while mommy films it all.  Katie shows Hailey singing when Harvey was a newborn and then her singing now, when Harvey is so very old… 7 months.  At least Hailey can sing her lines without the need for subtitles, so that’s something… I guess.  Katie takes a big step this week and wears an actual color… well, it’s a pale yellow, but it’s enough of a change for people to notice and comment on it.  Anything to break up the whitewashed monotony of her content.  She is slinging links for a fancy jewelry line that has hooked her up with birthstone earrings… and of course, an angel wing pendant monogrammed with her granddad’s name.  This is exploitive no matter which way you look at it, and super distasteful.  After filming the ad, it’s off to mid-week service at church where she films her baby… sleeping during the service.  Reminder that the Clark kids have to catch sleep whenever and however they can.  Katie drops a mini vlog of the family packing up to head to New Jersey.  It’s beach week with the Clark family, plus Travis’ sister is due to give birth to a little boy at any minute.  They are driving a rental mini-van bc the new SUV is in the shop after Travis was in a minor accident.  Katie tries to explain it, but Trav gets super sensitive and snaps that she made it sound like it was his fault but in reality he was parked and was hit by a drunk driver.  Originally they said it was very minor, but that doesn’t sound minor at all.  Regardless, no one was injured and the car’s sensors just need to be fixed.  All of this same content is shared in their weekly vlog, along with Kelly coming over to see their newly decorated screened porch.  Of course there isn’t a lick of color to be found and Katie over explains that the white furniture won’t be a problem bc they bought a stain removal package.  Remi the dog greets Kelly, and on her hind legs, the dog is just as tall as she is.  Kelly and Addee are going to be house sitting while the Clarks are at the beach.  Isn’t it odd that KJ is staying at her daughter’s house alone for the week?  Probably feels like a vacation compared to the dump that is the big house.  For about the 5th time Travis calls Katie “dumb” when they are laughing about something.  Wonder when that will stop being funny?  “Katie… you’re so dumb”… shut up Travis.  Katie takes all of the footage from the vlog and turns into a reel showing off the new porch.  If you comment, you are entered to win $500.  She says it isn’t sponsored by anyone, but it’s just another influencer trick.  They do this to get their engagement numbers up so they can use those numbers for a big ad buy in the future.  Everything they do is as fake as the muted greenery all over that house.
 
 


 
 
 
3.The Balkas are finally off on their next tropical content trip.  This time it’s Hawaii, and they’ve come along with the entire Balka clan so that they have ample babysitters to help them out while they set up their camera at various locations and dry hump each other.  It all starts with a mini vlog of Josie getting up at 3am to link everything she is taking with her and to tell everyone that this is the last trip Kelton took with his mom before she passed away.  Way to pull on the heartstrings while slinging sponsorships Josie.  She is so excited to feature her new $160 LuLuLemon viral long dress and says she will be wearing it her entire pregnancy.  In another vlog she shows the girls in their swimsuits at the beach with Kelton.   They go snorkeling and we see the grandparents and great-grandparents on the beach.  She’s selling the suits, the sunscreen… hell maybe even the sand at this point.  Back at the house it’s their night to cook and Kelton is complaining that the rental house doesn’t have any of his fancy kitchen gadgets and he is having to make do while grilling half a cow.  There’s lots of content of open windows with curtains floating in the breeze, coffee shops and snowcones.  We get a grid post of Baby Miles finally walking.  Josie says he waited to have the perfect backdrop to take his first steps.  Of course it isn’t a proper vacay unless Josie films a GRWM while she is in a super duper hurry.  She has just ten minutes to throw her pool noodle in her super long, dry hair but guess what yall?  After a few quick edits… she somehow manages to get full volume curls.  She also ends up with a flawless full face of makeup and the perfect bodycon dress for her date night with KTron the sexy.  She shows off her fully cooked sushi and then they head to the beach to film themselves basically making a baby… even though they already have… made a baby.  Carlin and Evan seem like siblings compared to these 2.
 
 
 


 
 
4.Alyssa Webster is the OG influencer in this family and don’t you forget it.  Even after quitting YouTube, disabling comments on all of her socials…. And filtering the actual body parts off of herself and her family… she was STILL able to score a free weekend getaway for the Webster clan.  She says it was to celebrate their 11th wedding anniversary but let’s be honest… it was really just bc someone agreed to give her the keys.  The home rental place forced her to turn the comments on to promote them, and this time, she isn’t overtaken by bots.  In fact, her comment count was super low so Alyssa was forced to go respond to each and every comment left to up the engagement.  The girls all clocked in and acted appropriately excited about a modern home in Boca with a pool and a swing set…. Pretty much exactly what they already have.  John bounced a ball around with his kids for exactly 3 minutes and Allie seems to be doing a good job caring for Rhett… he even eeked out a few smiles.  Of course, both Rhett and John are still wearing the sad hats… do you think they just pull a new one out of the box every day?  After their quick trip to Boca, Alyssa is back to living life through her “clean” filter and shows off what is probably a pink smoothie by the pool.  The filter makes it look like a large glass of frothy diarrhea and I don’t think she will ever truly understand how awful that filter is.  Anyway, she’s excited to have a “girl’s night out” in the broad daylight with a church friend.  Her over bleached hair is looking like straw these days and there just isn’t a filter to help that.   Someone comments on her rental reel asking if that house is really $1200 a night and how she expects folks to afford that… the comment doesn’t get a response from Alyssa…. Instead it gets deleted.  She wraps up the week by pushing a link for a protein shake after a 2 mile walk where she’s sweaty but in full makeup… I think what we are seeing is that Alyssa will sell anything, anytime, anywhere… and that means that as much as she may hate it….she is for sure a Bates.
 
 
 


 
 
5.Whitney Bates wraps up her girls trip by sharing pictures from Siesta Key.  We get all of the usual girly things like a boat ride, matching outfits, heart hands on the beach and the platitudes of already missing each other.  Back at home, Zach continues the heavy lifting of influencing by dropping a reel on Memorial Day featuring his hot dog chili.  All was going good until he decided to film himself eating the hot dog.  No one needs to see all that.  He also wants you to buy a $180 wooden cutting board that has to be oiled with a $50 oil kit before use.  This board has terrible reviews but when has that ever stopped a Bates??  Whitney says they are preparing for their yearly trip to Folly Beach and plan to stop by to check in on Janie on the way.  Zach has another recipe reel to share… this one he calls potato skins… maybe you have heard of it?  It’s a baked potato with butter, sour cream and cheese.  I wonder if he has 100 pound blocks of orange cheese.  Seriously, they should just buy a cow… of course with the amount of beef that they eat… never mind, never mind.  The weekly vlog features Kelly again.  This is supposed to be a q and a, but it is really just 30 minutes of Zach and Kelly Jo talking over each other and telling the same stories over and over.  All of the questions are either food related, or about Papa Bill and there’s just nothing new to say.  Kelly says Trace is the pickiest eater of all and won’t even walk in the kitchen if onions or garlic can be smelled.  She also says Carlin was her quickest and most painful birth.  Carlin is still quite painful today, actually.  Jackson was her longest birth at 30 hours.  She also says that most of the cooking at the big house is handled by Callie these days. They also say that they will still go check on Janie, but she has lots of other family around and that she is looking forward to being able to get out and travel some now.  Before ending the week in Charleston, Zach tries to wring out the last of the Lake Havasu content by showing himself attempting to golf on the putting green at their rental.  If I see a family of 7 with big cameras and microphones clipped to their shirts this week in Charleston… I will let y’all know.
 
 
 


 
 
6.Poor Lydia Bates is being forced to carry a pregnancy to full term and her content can’t hardly handle it.  She’s been saying she was at the end since she was 7 months, and she’s pretty much just out of things to say at this point.  She just films a day at home in the tiny house with Ryker and the cat most days… and of course, lots of gym selfies.  They head to parrot mountain for a vlog where Trace knows the owners and they get a VIP tour.  The last time they went, they got pooped on… so this time they are gun shy.  Ryker is traumatized and scared to death of the birds, but Trace soldiers on, filming it all.  He sounds like a voice over for a local TV ad promoting this place.  They let Ryker pick a stuffed bird to take home and of course he chooses the white cockatoo.  In a sea of colorful stuffed parrots… he instinctively knows to pick the white one.  Lydia’s job is done.  At her weekly doctor appointment, she musters up the nerve to leave her iphone rolling, but it’s pointed at her shirt.  I wonder if her doctor consented to being filmed.  If Lydia wants to be as big as Carlin and Evan, she has to get over that fear and stick the phone right in the doctor’s face! In another vlog, Lydia and Trace sit in the kitchen and talk to the camera while Maui the cat climbs around behind them on their countertops.  They say she is 38 weeks pregnant and the baby could come anytime.  They are naming the baby Kaia Rae.  Her name means “pure” which we know is the highest compliment in all of fundie world.  Remember when Trace told us that in their marriage he has the final say on all big decisions?  Well, here they tell us that Lydia wanted to wait until after the baby was born to announce her name, but he wanted to announce now… so they did.  The vlog is sponsored by yet another protein powder.  If you shake Trace Bates a cloud of protein powder would fluff up all around him. Lydia heads to her sisters’ dance recital and then spends the rest of the weekend curb walking, desperately trying to go into labor before it is time to drop another vlog.
 
 
 


 
 
7.Michael and Brandon are riding the high of their last vlog that is well on its way to 200,000 views.  Michael even gets to sling a link this week, so their influencer dreams are definitely coming true.  Brandon may be out of that warehouse before he knows it.  She is selling Alani drinks by tagging them on top of a picture of her foster child’s hands… while saying how blessed she is.  In a grid post, she wraps up her May… there are lots of pictures of Zach and Whit’s kids, so now we know who kept the 5 of them while their parents vacayed in MAGA land.  People are clamoring for more information on the new babies in her comments, but her lips are sealed.  Rest assured though… when she CAN show them… she WILL.
 
 
 


 
 
8.Lawson and Tiffany must really need to feather their nest bc they have dropped 2 YouTube vlogs in less than 2 weeks.  Even with all of that footage, they are still running about 2 months behind.  The first vlog is all about Lawson singing at the Tennessee baseball game and that has just about been beaten to death.  He also shows the house that is being renovated near the big house and solves the mystery surrounding that project.  Lawson says it is a small house that was left behind when Gil purchased the initial 30 acres.  They have wanted to remodel for quite some time and are now getting it done.  They never say who it is for, but it is a good ways away from the big house and higher up on the mountain.  On Memorial Day he stands under his American Flag for a photo with Baby Will who is in the ever present backpack.  Tiffy shows off some gross salmon dinner she cooked and the salmon is actually weeping over the green pesto pasta it’s sitting on top of.  They spend all week teasing a huge life update that never comes.  Both of them are now full time pregnancy baiting and every time they turn the camera on it’s “2 under 2” or some other mess.  Of course Tiffany films several cringe inducing reels, including ones where she says she and Lawson used to be lovers but are now just nursery coworkers, and another where she shows old footage of her on a set and says the names that she has been called.  Her favorite is “TiffyTaffy” and that should tell you all you need to know about this try hard.  She shows herself in 2017 working as an actress holding a snake, and how she is today… frumpy on the couch with a baby.  The girl seems to be having something of an identity crisis… I imagine being married to Lawson would cause all sorts of self doubt. Lawson shows himself working on vlog number 2 and says that Tiffany has served him all of his favorite snacks while he “works so hard”.  Anyway, the second vlog is a q and a.  He has a dog treat sponsor for this one which means Duke the dog is front and center… so convenient.  They sit at the piano and face the camera.  Behind them, taped to the big letter B, are ultrasound pictures.  It’s obviously meant to bait the audience as Lawson has to point out that it’s there.  They talk around all of the real answers, including saying that Tiffany has a house in California that is part of her “real estate management”.  They both say big changes are coming this year and that they may live part time in California bc Tiffy doesn’t like the cold Winters.  He shows a question about how they make their money… and doesn’t answer it.  The entire time they both tease a pregnancy… Lawson even says that he called the 5 Bates pregnancies happening this year, and wouldn’t be surprised to learn there is a 6th.  He plans to teach Will to play piano himself.  They show Lawson recording his Grandpa song and show I Love You Day but who can stand to sit through that again 4 months after it happened??  He says he has encouraged his parents to write a book so that may be on the horizon.  In current time, they are in California where Tiffy films herself getting off the plane with Will in that dern container again.  Let the kid be free!
 
 
 


 
 
9.Erin is back on IG this week reposting her mom’s repost of their last vlogs.  She also shares a sermon from Preacher Chad about how good is the enemy of best.  Christians shouldn’t accept “good” and should strive for “best”… why does it always seem that these sermons are pointed directly at her siblings?  She’s down at it selling her beef fat lotion and even though it was just on sale, she puts it on sale again and says she doesn’t do this very often.  In a new YouTube vlog filmed just after they announced their pregnancy, Chad and Erin explain that they didn’t get to tell their kids they were expecting… bc the kids figured it out.  They seem shocked by this fact.  They claim that Carles told them the siblings had been meeting privately to pray for another sibling and now Erin believes that is why she was blessed with another baby.  Sure, Erin, whatever you say.  It had nothing to do with not using birth control and being bored as hell.  Michael is there helping with the children and she comes up with the idea of gifting them all nesting dolls with the gender of the new baby inside the smallest doll.  The kids all line up like dutiful little statues and follow directions meticulously…. Except the dolls are hard to get into and Chad ends up ripping them all open and they scream and holler in disbelief that baby #7 is a boy.  Erin has 4 little sistermoms to help with the 3 boys.  Life is good.  They call Lydia, Alyssa, Josie, Gil and Kelly Jo (separately), Katie and Tori to share their excitement.  No one really seems shocked. The vlog has 93,000 views in just 12 hours so it is pretty obvious that Chad needs to get out of Erin’s way and let her be the YouTube queen she is meant to be.
 
 
 


 
 
10.Bits and Bytes…Nathan is flying some serious big money businessmen all around the world and those connections netted him and Esther an invitation to a huge MAGA wedding of a SpaceX engineer held at the base of the rocket.  Esther got to wear a prom dress and Nathan had a perma grin plastered on his face….Kelly reposts Zach’s lemonade pie recipe and then Zach reposts the repost…On Memorial Day we get a picture of JebJud standing on the roof of a truck waving an American Flag.  The big house is in the background, still decked out with Christmas lights…Tori’s son Slade turns one and Kelly Joe says he has an army of siblings to love and care for him.  No mention of a mother or a father…
 
 
Do you know how the men in this family hold their pants up?  With a BIBLE BELT!  Have a great week friends!

1l12wzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1l12wzw/two_week_peru_trip_check/,Two week Peru Trip Check,"Hi, I’ll be in Peru for two weeks from Aug 29th-Sep 13th for a Salkantay trek and was hoping to get some feedback on my itinerary, packing, and general questions. I’m looking to stay at hostels like Viajerro/Pariwana/Black Llama with a combination of private rooms and sleeping pods. I love being around a bit of a party vibe but also want to have some privacy/down time to read when I need to recharge.

My PTO/international flights/Salkantay trek are locked in but I have a lot flexibility for my last 2 full days and I’m debating staying around Cusco or going down to Arequipa.

  
**Questions**

* For a spa day in Cusco, I’d love to go to Palacio Del Inka since they don’t require a hotel stay to book at their spa and I don’t mind splurging $100-150ish considering I don’t get to travel too much. Part of me is also debating about staying a night at the hotel itself because it looks incredible but I’m not sure if I want to spend $400 plus the spa cost for just one day/night. Has anyone stayed there that could vouch for it being worth the cost?
* Is it worth leaving Cusco and the Sacred Valley for two days in Arequipa? I like that it sounds a bit more off the beaten path for a city and less touristy than Cusco but not sure if it’s worth spending more time and money at airports. 
* If I do stay in the extra two days around Cusco, has anyone stayed at Wolf Totem in Pisac? It looks gorgeous and a nice place to recharge for a day or two with great views of the valley. The reviews sound amazing and the host sounds like a character I’d enjoy as well. 
* Does anyone have recommendations for a tattoo artist in Cusco? I’d love to get some more ink once I finish hiking!

**Packing List** I have a 42L kelty redwing bag that everything *might* fit into including an 18L REI bag that rolls up. I’ll also have a crossbody bag for daily use. I’m flying with American so they might try to force me to check my bag if I really pack that bitch so I’m trying to avoid that if possible. The trekking company will provide me with a duffel they’ll transport to the campsites so I only need to hike with my smaller bag to hold water/snacks/rainjacket. The weather for early September seems relatively mild so I’m not sure if I need just a down puffer vest or a full down puffer jacket when hiking or spending time around Cusco. 

* 2 wool longsleeve base layer shirts
* 3 regular hiking tshirts
* Fleece sweatshirt
* Puffer vest/jacket -  I live in a warm climate so I need to buy one, probably just going with the cheapest option from REI
* Rain jacket (early september still gets rain so I’m not sure if just a rain jacket will suffice or if I also need rain pants)
* 4 pairs of wool socks
* 1 pair of hiking pants - also buy a pair of convertible hiking pants? 
* 1 pair of athletic shorts - can also be used for swimming and spa day
* 1 pair of sweatpants
* waterproof hiking shoes - I love my Oboz boots (and the ankle support) but want something lighter for longer hikes like Altra, Brooks, or Salomon if the comfort is worth sacrificing stability. My feet pronate quite a bit so I’m leaning towards the Altra Olympus or Salomon X Ultra 5
* Crocs for showers and camp shoes
* sun hat
* beanie
* light gloves
* buff

**Itinerary** 

Aug 29th - evening flight from Austin to Lima

Aug 30th- Lima - land around 5 AM, get cash/pharmacy run/drop off my bag at Viajerro Barranco (love the old mansion and seems like a good balance of fun and nice amenities.

1l12w5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1l12w5n/disappointed_by_the_girl_with_the_dragon_tattoo/,Disappointed by *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*,"I had been wanting to watch The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo for a very long time ; first because I love Fincher (Se7en is one of my favorite movies), second because I already read (or rather devoured) the Millennium trilogy by the late Stieg Larsson (TGWTDT is, let’s not forget, an adaptation of the novel of the same name).

Well…

I’m disappointed.

Imagine over 1,000 pages of investigation, introspection, analysis, and scheming. Now imagine a film adaptation of those 1,000 pages that barely lasts two hours. See where I’m going with this?

This movie feels like a summary. Steven Zaillian (the screenwriter) bulldozed through the original plot. Everything is shortened, to the point where it gets a bit confusing (if I hadn’t read the book, I think I would have struggled to understand what was going on).

For example, take the scene where Henrik Vanger meets Mikael for the first time and explains all the ins and outs of the Harriet Vanger mystery. In the book, this scene spans dozens of pages. In the movie, it lasts no more than five minutes.

Ow, and I found two performances off the mark : First, Stellan Skarsgård (who plays Martin Vanger). You can tell he’s a psychopath from his very first appearance in the film (and no, this has nothing to do with me having read the book). His coldness, his gaze… you raise an eyebrow at him right away. In the book, Martin is infinitely more warm and charming. At no point do you suspect him of even killing a fly—until Mikael unmasks him, and then he reveals his true nature.

Second, Daniel Craig (who plays Mikael Blomkvist). I found him too cold, too robotic (too James Bond). The Mikael in the book is far more human—passionate about his work (or should I say obsessed), about women, about simple things like a cup of coffee… None of that is well represented in the film.

And Millennium?! One of the best aspects of the book is the slow rise of this small newspaper, held together by a handful of passionate people. In the film, this aspect is completely botched. Barely a few minutes are dedicated to it, and I would have preferred if they hadn’t bothered at all. The staff is large (which is odd, considering the paper is supposed to be on the verge of collapse), dull, cold (they celebrate their revenge on Wennerström with crossed arms and austere expressions)… In one word : depressing.

All that said, the film does have its strengths, particularly Cronenweth’s cinematography and Reznor’s score, which effectively highlight Hedestad’s cold and eerie atmosphere. Also Rooney Mara's remarkable performance. She was terrific as Lisbeth. 

Is it a bad movie? No. Is it a masterpiece? Definitely not, especially after reading the excellent novel by the late Stieg Larsson.",0,1748819777.0,TrueFilm,7,0.27,False

1l12tnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/HyundaiSantaFe/comments/1l12tnp/forward_assist_warning_issues/,Forward assist warning issues,"Hi. I test drove a 25' Santa Fe XRT yesterday and I was impressed with it much more than I thought I would be. My husband had already started looking up putting a lift on it for me with bigger tires and I was looking through pictures on here getting ready to tell him that I wanted to go back today and buy it. Then I saw comments/posts about people having issues with the forward assist features. I drive 280 miles to work on AZ freeways during rush hour, the thought that my vehicle could constantly beep at me for my sunglasses, when I take a drink of coffee, my hand placement isn't correct or the worst brake on me is very concerning. I texted the sales person and his reply was a very canned salesperson reply.....

Good morning. The system is designed to monitor awareness of the driver. There have been studies by other manufacturers & the IIHS about this very thing. Some systems are more sensitive in their reading than others, but overall, the feature has been proven to help drivers recognize when they are becoming sleepy or just plan not paying attention to traffic, which is the biggest case here in the USA. Hyundai equips their vehicles with the option to turn that system off if not wanted. I don’t have my activated simply for the reason of the crazy drivers and tight road construction conditions here in Phoenix. My eyes are on a swivel…lol.  There has not been any accidents or incidents on a national scale reported.  Hyundai is at the very top of innovation when it comes to advanced safety systems and customer confidence. 

From what I've read you can't shut it off, but for some it will go off no matter what the driver is doing. I feel like I'm talking myself out of this vehicle the more I think about the ""what if"". Not wearing a hat while in cruise control isn't that big of a deal, but something beeping at us constantly because I live in AZ and the sun is always in your face or looking at the radio a few seconds too long could be a deal breaker. I would love to hear from owners who are not experiencing any issues with their forward assist features and those who have and found remedies. Thanks!",2,1748819583.0,HyundaiSantaFe,19,1.0,False

I really need help understanding this…","My English isn’t very good. But I will carefully read every comment you write and do my best to respond.

There’s something that’s been weighing on me for a long time, and I want to finally write it down here. I’m a 22-year-old man. Living in Turkey. In terms of appearance, I’d rate myself around a 6 or 6.5 out of 10. As for my social skills, general knowledge, ability to hold a conversation, and how much I’ve worked on myself—I’d give myself a 6.5 to 7. I’m empathetic, polite, honest, and respectful. Believe it or not, I’m still amazed at how quickly people trust me when we meet. Within just two weeks of getting to know someone, they’re often crying and telling me their most heartbreaking, deeply buried secrets. I’m genuinely surprised at the level of trust I seem to inspire.

I’ve heard stories of failed suicide attempts, struggles with drug addiction, psychological disorders, gambling problems, and even someone who had to flee their country due to political crimes. And most of these people know almost nothing about me. Actually—nothing at all. Yet, somehow, compared to many others in their lives, they quickly form a bond with me and share their deepest struggles. About 80% of these people are women. Some are 18 or 19, others 28 or 29.

Just six days ago, a girl I had just met invited me to her place, where she lives alone. She made me coffee and let me play with her cat. I thanked her for the coffee and the nice conversation and then went home. Another girl got horribly drunk while I was at her place and was triggered by memories of her suicide attempts. She fell asleep, and I was so scared she might hurt herself that I just sat next to her for four hours, listening to music and doing nothing else. Then I got in a taxi and went home.

Friends, I don’t have romantic feelings for these people. But here’s what I don’t understand: over the past two years, despite so many people placing this deep trust in me, not a single one of them has tried to form a romantic connection. Don’t get me wrong—I have no intention of taking advantage of anyone’s situation. But I truly don’t get it. Why is it that I can come across as such a good, trustworthy, comforting person, and yet no one ever sees me in a romantic light?

What exactly is the issue here, people? Why does no one look at someone who makes them feel safe and comforted with romantic interest?",5,1748819489.0,Advice,19,0.86,False

Had a family outing, drank a milkshake I *later* figured out to be, uh, more or less my entire day's worth of calories.

I could fast the rest of the day sure, but I'll be hangry and I do have work tomorrow lol! I barely had breakfast since I figured I'd eat out today, but I sure didn't budget for >1k via a drink lmao. So I haven't had any fulfilling meals today, just a few bites at things, coffee, and the milkshake. 

So as far as impromptu over-eating meals, how do you handle it? Skip a meal, much smaller meals until the numbers balance out again, or just eat like normal to not disrupt routine? I have trouble with ""ah well today's ruined anyway, time to pig out!"" which helps nobody. 

TLDR: Ate all of my calories in 1 snack accidentally, do I skip, reduce, or continue on with my meals? Thanks! ",29,1748819428.0,loseit,18,0.84,False

Tired of crypto payments being “coming soon” forever?

**AEON launched with a global merchant network** — both offline and online.  
That means you can already:

🛒 Pay in crypto  
💳 Merchant gets fiat (or crypto, if they prefer)  
📱 Use your wallet like a real payment method  
🌎 Access real shops, not just dApps

Behind it is a modular protocol that supports:

* EVM chains (ETH, Arbitrum, etc.)
* Solana, TON, and others
* Fiat rails and PSP integrations
* Merchant dashboards, QR terminals, refunds

And this isn’t just in crypto hubs. AEON has signed merchants across LATAM, SEA, and Europe — with **retail, F&B, and online services** already testing or accepting.

It’s the closest I’ve seen to Stripe + Alipay for Web3.

If you could pay with crypto anywhere IRL, where would you start?

Coffee shop? Co-working space? Uber driver?

The thing is, for a long time I’ve been feeling like they’re purposely excluding me from their lives and it’s really bothering me.

We met at school ten years ago and have always been very close. We know each other's families, we've spent vacations and holidays together, and we've had some great group experiences. Before I go any further, I want to mention that I'm gay, have been out since before I met them, and they both have long-term boyfriends, so I'm absolutely certain this issue has nothing to do with conflicted feelings or anything like that.

Since we started college we obviously couldn’t spend as much time together as when we were in high school, but over the years we’ve only been able to see each other like once a month, with most of our friendship being maintained through text. I wasn’t really comfortable with that little contact so until last year I tried to take them out as much as I could, inviting them to coffee shops and different activities numerous times, with me paying for it. Things seemed to be going well but I noticed that they rarely contacted me first, and almost all our conversations consisted of me reaching out and they answering later.

I tested if they would reach out if I stopped messaging first, but the results were really discouraging, Misty hasn’t texted me in three months, and Lyla and I have had very little interaction; we also haven’t seen each other since February. The thing is, every week, at least two or three times, I see Lyla posting Instagram stories hanging out with Misty and more people at her place. It happens religiously every week and multiple times a week. I haven’t been invited to a single one of this reunions.

A month ago I messaged Lyla telling her that I was feeling left because we’ve been so distant lately, to which she said that she regretted I felt that way, but that it wasn’t her intention to exclude me and that she just happened to not be the kind of person who keeps constant/permanent contact with people (which I know is not true, since, as I stated before, she hangs out with more people numerous time a week at her place). We just left it at that and later she added me to a group chat with information about her upcoming birthday party. I decided I didn't feel comfortable attending a party I felt invited to out of pity or obligation, so I messaged the group that I couldn't go, wished everyone a good time, and left the group chat. I later messaged her again to wish her a happy birthday, but she hasn't responded, and it's been two weeks, so I'm starting to wonder if I did something wrong or mishandled the situation. AITA?

(I want to clarify that I have absolutely no problem with them having other friends, and I know they have the right to attend gatherings without me being invited. My problem is being consistently and protractedly excluded despite my constant efforts to maintain our friendship.)",2,1748819365.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

My 1 year old and got out of a seriously bad situation with my ex and was put here,  at first I was excited becasue I knew the area well and knew the bus system since I can't drive, and yet from there it's all down hill.

Most reviews on this hotel say that the homeless here are drunks or drug abusers, however most of us are single parents relying on this place for warmth and to keep our children in a protected environment. 

However the staff here make us feel far from that, this is my 3rd night here and I know the saying is beggers can't be choosers, however for the 3 nights iv been here my key hasn't worked once in my door... 

I have had to bring any valuable items with me whenever I leave the hotel and the staff treat us as second class citizens, we are looked down on and they refuse to help or talk to us unless we latterly are begging them to help.

today they took my key away from me when I finally proved it didn't fit my door, the receptionist refused to give it back and now they want me to tell them every time I leave so they can lock and unlock my door when i get back... I have never felt more uncomfortable in my life and to be honest it reminds me of being my ex partner who rarely let me out the house with out the guilt tripping.

It's like the reception staff here don't want us to leave so we are not seen exiting the building, like they are embarrassed for housing us, most of us here didn't want to be homeless, it wasn't our choice and yet here be are being glared at, snarled at and over all treated like dirt that they just stepped in..

All I have to protect my son and I in this room a slim chain on the door and doors don't lock on the inside to make it worse, not that I have to key to lock it even if I wanted to.

The cleaning team only clean the hallway, they don't hover the room at all so I don't know why the step foot into my room and then lock it becasue it looked the same as I left it, I always remove my own rubbish and child's nappies, I even had to clean the bath and sink when we first moved in here, the water was brown and had black bits in it and I had to run it for 10 minutes.

 All 3 taps were the same with disscusting water, if you are a paying customer of the hotel side, you will be given a TV, and tea and coffee facilities as well as a kettle, however even if you are paying for a room whilst being homeless or if the council is paying for you, you get nothing, so if you have a baby they just shrug at you and tell you to go find something to heat their bottle with..

It's honestly discussing and not that I want to complain but like i said its been 3 days and I'm already worried for my sons safety here...

I'm in the middle or getting a new job. I'm just waiting for the start date and it's a place where I can bring my child with me so I dont have to worry about childcare.

It's not like I'm sat on my but waiting for the council to do something and yet I'm still being treated as rubbish... even the housing agent who's on my case had ignored me for 5 days straight before dumping my child and I here.

the only reason we're are even here in the first place is becasue at first she wanted to move us very far away and with my anxiety and being a single mother, being so far from my family wouldn't of helped us at all.

Honestly I just feel like such a bad parent and on somedays I wonder if it would have been better to stay with my ex ... at lest my child had his own room and comforts...

So here I am writing this as my son sleeps, becasue no one I'm in contact with is taking me seriously other than my family and they can't do much for our situation.",1,1748818911.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False
