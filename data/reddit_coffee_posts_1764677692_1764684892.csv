1pc9h69,https://i.redd.it/d3wi7qxwts4g1.jpeg,My wife built an app to generate photo captions,"Hello Reddit users! I want to share a cool app that my wife has been developing recently. Since she’s not a Reddit person, I’m making this post on her behalf.

The idea for the app was born pretty spontaneously. My wife loves Instagram, and most of her posts are photos rather than videos. To bring more story to a photo, she spends time writing a good or funny caption for each one. Later, ChatGPT came into play, but it has limitations on how many images you can process per day. So one time we were sitting, drinking coffee, and it hit us: it would be great to create an app that simplifies this whole process of posting photos to Instagram.

Over the next few weeks, we brainstormed how to make this app actually useful, not just another AI wrapper, but something with real value for users. As a result, the app using the latest ChatGPT model was born (believe it or not, not all the cheap models can do this job well).

What makes it different from a simple AI wrapper? Well, you can apply styling to your captions directly in the app, use custom fonts (which is pretty cool), easily reuse your previous captions, and start quickly with predefined moods. And last but not least, you can easily share your social media ready content, download it, or use the captions as stickers.

Personally, I don’t post on IG very often, but once I tried the app even me, an introvert, found it surprisingly fun, especially when generating captions in “Fuct Hunter” or sarcastic mood.

So if you find it interesting, give it a try. Sorry to Android users the app is currently available only on Apple devices.

The app has free trial so you can try it to use it without any commitments.

1pc9gk7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pc9gk7,Bardic: a Python-first Interactive Fiction engine for complex game state with visual graph-based story editing and live passage preview,"Hello! I've been working on Bardic, a new IF engine/language that bridges the gap between interactive fiction branching narrative and the power of a full programming language. If you've even been tinkering with a macro or function in Twine or Ink and thought ""I wish I could just import custom Python classes into my story to handle all of this!"", Bardic might be for you.

I was building a game that required lots of complex game state modeling and got frustrated with primitive variables in Ink, and all the macros (and whitespace handling) in Twine, so I made Bardic.

* Bardic lets you write stories with real Python objects and code, not just primitives. You can import your own classes, functions and methods into the story and use them.
* It also has parameterized passages you can use (perfect for shops or NPC conversations) that accept parameters just like function arguments. You can pass around data behind the scenes easily.
* The engine handles auto-serialization of your entire game state, including your custom Python objects, automatically. The game also compiles to JSONs so it's portable and easily readable by just about any system.
* It's frontend-agnostic. It produces structured JSON data (just like Ink!) and the engine ships with templates for NiceGUI, Reflex, and React+FastAPI. You can choose one of these frontend stacks, or bring your own, as long as your chosen stack can run Python!
* The syntax is clean and Ink-inspired, so it's mostly there to get out of the way while you write. BUT you can drop into pure Python blocks inside the narrative files, whenever you need it!

Development experience:

* 60-second setup with the built-in `bardic init` \- you get a working browser-based game *immediately*.
* VSCode extension with code highlighting and folding, snippets, and a *full interactive node graph of your story* that you can click on to navigate to passages in the .bard source file. (This is similar to Twine's visual editor!)
* VSCode extension also has a *live preview from any passage* feature that allows you to preview the rendering and appearance of any passage (even deep into the story) while allowing you to inject game state variables as needed. It's been great IME for quick debugging and QA in long stories.
* CLI tools for compilation to JSON and terminal play (mostly for testing things out as you develop the game).
* Clean syntax with `~` one-liners and `@py:` blocks for full code.

An example of the syntax:

    # Import your own Python classes, just like in a .py file
    from my_game.character import Player
    
    :: Start
    # Create a new Player object
    ~ hero = Player(""Hero"")
    
    Welcome to your adventure, {hero.name}!
    You have {hero.health} health.
    
    + [Look around] -> Forest
    + [Check your bag] -> Inventory
    
    :: Forest
    The forest is dark and spooky.
    ~ hero.sprint() # Call a method on your object
    You feel a bit tired.
    
    + [Go back] -> Start
    
    :: Inventory
    # Use Python blocks for complex logic
    @py:
    if not hero.inventory:
      bag_contents = ""Your bag is empty.""
    else:
      # Use list comprehensions, f-strings...
      item_names = [item.name for item in hero.inventory]
      bag_contents = f""You have: {', '.join(item_names)}""
    @endpy
    
    {bag_contents}
    
    + [Go back] -> Start

My Use Case:

I build a narrative card-reading game as a sort of ""proof of concept"" (80k+ words of .bard files) where players influence their clients' lives through interpretations and their own choices. Every card in the deck is a Python object with properties and methods and the narrative needed to interact with them naturally. (You can find it here: [https://katehlouie.itch.io/arcanum](https://katehlouie.itch.io/arcanum) )

How to get started:

I've got a quickstart guide in my repo's [frontpage readme](https://github.com/katelouie/bardic) but here's a quick guide:

    pip install bardic[nicegui]
    bardic init my-game # defaults to nicegui template
    cd my-game
    bardic compile example.bard -o compiled_stories/example.json
    python player.py

And then your game runs at localhost:8080! That's really all you need to do to get up and running!

Tutorials:

I wrote a *full* tutorial series to get you started (with separate paths for: people who know python, and for people who have never touched python in their lives but want to write a game).

Check it out here: [https://github.com/katelouie/bardic/blob/main/docs/tutorials/README.md](https://github.com/katelouie/bardic/blob/main/docs/tutorials/README.md)

I would really love to know what the community thinks, and if you're interested! I'm happy to answer any questions about design or technical details, or how to get started writing with Bardic. Also very interested in feedback about anything -- engine, language, feature set, dev tools like the VSCode extension, the tutorial series, etc!

**Ditched the 9-to-5, Now What? 🧘‍♂️ Finding My Purpose Post-40 (And It's NOT Golf!)**

So, you’ve done it. You’ve broken free. You stared down the Monday morning dread and said, ""No more!"" You traded in spreadsheets for… well, *something* else. Congratulations! But if you're anything like me, you might be thinking, ""Okay, awesome… now what EXACTLY am I supposed to *do* with all this newfound freedom?""

It's a legit question. The golden handcuffs are off, but now you're standing at a fork in the road. One path leads to endless rounds of golf (tempting, I admit!), and the other... well, that's the one we need to figure out.

Finding purpose after 40, especially *after* a career, isn’t about checking off boxes. It's about reigniting that spark. It's about feeling *alive* again. And it definitely doesn't have to involve wearing plaid pants. Here’s what's helped me:

*   **Embrace the 'Experiment Phase':** This is *not* the time for a 5-year plan. Think short bursts. Try a pottery class. Volunteer at an animal shelter. Learn to code. Remember that passion project you always put off? Now's the time to give it a shot. The key is to *try things*. Don't worry about being ""good"" at them right away. Just enjoy the process. Remember that trip to Machu Picchu you always wanted to take? Start planning!

*   **Reconnect with the ""Inner Child"":** What did you *love* doing as a kid? Before the world told you what you *should* be doing? Did you love drawing? Building things? Writing stories? Go back there. Even if it seems silly, tapping into that original source of joy can unlock some amazing new paths.

*   **Redefine ""Success"":** Are you still measuring success by your salary? Time to ditch that metric. What *really* matters now? Is it spending more time with family? Making a difference in your community? Creating something beautiful? Define success on *your* terms.

*   **Get Comfortable with Discomfort:** Growth happens outside your comfort zone. Pursuing a new purpose can be scary! You're going to feel awkward, maybe even a little lost. Embrace it. That's where the magic happens. Imagine your grandkids asking what you did with all that free time. Would you be proud of the response?

*   **Check Your Financial Foundations** It’s easier to explore your purpose when you know you're secure. **“You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.”** [https://mavely.app.link/e/KY8k65O9EXb](https://mavely.app.link/e/KY8k65O9EXb) Maybe a little financial clarity can help you sleep better and allow you to explore more without monetary restrictions.

I knew a guy who spent 20 years as an accountant. Hated every minute of it. Now, he restores antique motorcycles. Is he making as much money? Nope. Is he happier? Absolutely.

This isn't about finding the *one true calling* that will suddenly make everything perfect. It's about creating a life that feels meaningful, fulfilling, and aligned with who you are *now*. It's about waking up each day with a sense of excitement, even if that excitement is just for a really good cup of coffee.

So, what's next? Maybe it's time to start wondering.

Given how much is riding on novelty for patents, I wanted to sanity-check whether that’s actually safe, so I sat down with an AI Engineer and our IP team to dig into what really happens to your prompts and how that interacts with patent law and UK GDPR.

For context: I work with inventors at a UK product design and IP consultancy, so we see both sides, the tech and the patents, and we’ve recently written this up in more detail.

TL;DR

\- Consumer AI chatbots (like ChatGPT Free/Plus, Claude, Gemini and others) may use your prompts to improve their models unless you opt out or use a business or enterprise plan.

\- For patents in the UK and Europe, novelty is critical. Any non-confidential disclosure before filing can put your rights at risk.

\- Treat public chatbots as a crowded coffee shop. They are fine for general questions, not for the secret mechanism that makes your idea unique.

\- Use AI for high-level research and drafting, but keep your core invention details for confidential conversations with human experts under NDA, or for properly governed enterprise AI setups.

I have a 1/4"" compression shutoff in the wall, nominally for our refrigerator ice maker. Right now that's connected directly to the refrigerator using standard 1/4"" compression to 1/4"" compression braided hose.

The problem is I need to hook up our coffee maker, which has a 1/4"" flare (male) on the back of it (which is not changeable). So I was hoping to find a tee that will allow me to connect both the refrigerator and the coffee maker, but I'm having a hell of a time figuring out what parts I should use.

So basically I need to connect 1/4"" male compression shutoff (at the wall) to both a 1/4"" compression male (at the refrigerator) and a 1/4"" flare male (at the coffee maker).

1pc97a3,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmptyContinents/comments/1pc97a3/memory_of_the_old_republic/,Memory of the old Republic,"*2134 - Costa Serena, Marche, Italian Republic*

The little girl grinned awkwardly at her teacher, under the judging eyes of her classmates. 

Miss Tonina, who had just witnessed a frankly disastrous presentation about the port of Firenze Marittima, pondered for a couple seconds on the vote she should have given to her student, especially considering that this was the first major assignment of this semester for the 5th years of the Gianni Nannini elementary school.

The elderly woman sighed and conceded a passing grade.

""Look, Giada. The historical section is mostly wrong, Firenze Marittima being established without permission from Palermo is the main reason for the start of their conflict with the government. Getting that wrong invalidates most of your analysis of the monuments in the port. Still, you did a great job describing the architecture and techniques used, so I'm gonna let you with a 6+.

Put more effort on the context next time.""

Definitely happy with barely passing, Giada returned to her seat.

Tonina looked back at her student list. 5 done, 17 to go. It will probably take another week or two to finish, but she was glad that the class had been fairly creative with their picks for a research on Italian monuments.

Last year she could swear that at seven different students had brought the Palermo cathedral.


""Lorenzo?"" she called, seeing a boy from the back row come to the school laptop and put in his pen drive. Archaic stuff, really, but Tonina wasn't surprised at the school buying equipment relegated to the 2040s.

The projector soon displayed a flag, half blue and half white, its heraldry mostly covered by the title: ""San Marino Remembrance Monument"".

Given the puzzled looks of his classmates, Lorenzo waited from the teacher's approval to begin. Tonina nodded and reminded the class that they were allowed and encouraged to ask questions.
Lorenzo coughed a bit and looked at the projection, pressing a button to move to the next slide. 

""The San Marino Remembrance Monument is a monumentary complex built first in 2075 and later slowly expanded until 2120. It is located inside the former territory of the Republic of San Marino, which is roughly an hour and half from her-""

""What's a San Marino?"" another student asked, quickly raising his hand after asking the question.

""Well... uh-"" Lorenzo frantically pressed forward to later slides where he had written the history section, accidentally overshooting and having to go a few slides backwards.

""It's- It was a pre-Vanishing Republic based on Monte Titano, founded by San Marino himself - he was a Saint - in 301. He had gone to the mountain to escape persecution from the Roman Empire because he was a Christian. 

But! This is only a legend, tradition. There was a town there since the times of Marino, but the republic was probably born in the 1200s, when it enam- emamp- emancipade- declared independence from the Papal States.""

""Papal States? Like what, the one in Palermo?"" asked a second voice.

""N-no, those were in Rome- and also here. That's why they declared independence, as they did not want neither the Roman Pope or the Holy Roman Emperor not to intervene in their government. And they stayed independent until the Vanishing.""

Another little hand rose from the back of the class.

""Why didn't we conquer them? It looks like a city and an half at most.""

""Well, they helped us during the First Unification and we were grateful and we didn't conquer them.""


A bit reductive, Tonina thought, but to be fair, she wasn't sure if her History colleague had reached the Risorgimento yet, so she let it go.

""It was under an oligarchy for most of its time, but became a proper democratic republic later, with the Captains Regent. I think there was some sort of crisis in the late 2020s, but I couldn't find much about it.""

Much to his general dismay, Lorenzo stood for a little bit in front of the silent class, only speaking again after the teacher had gestured him to continue.

""Okay, so..."" muttered Lorenzo, returning to the first slides of his presentation. 

""As I was saying before, the San Marino Remembrance Monument is a monumentary complex and museum built in 2075 in the territory of the former San Marino. The museum is well-known in the continent and sometimes collaborates with the Arno Zeeb Museum of Lost Cultural History for tour guide-""

""Arno? Like the Arno from Giada's thing?"" asked another student.

""No, that's a river. This is a guy. A guy with the same name of a river, but it's not weird because he wasn't Italian, so the name wasn't weird for him.""

""That makes sense."" the voice replied.

""It does."" Lorenzo confirmed, before trying to return to his presentation. ""So, so, so... well, let's start from the beginning.""

Lorenzo moved to the next slide, which showed a satellite image of the barely urbanized hinterland, with Rimini Nuova on the top right and a red outline of the country in the center.

""San Marino was one of the few countries that completely vanished... in the Vanishing. The first documented sign of the disappearance was an official statement from President Mattarella on the 13th of June, when he declared that the Italian Republic had verified the disappearance of both the Republic of San Marino and the Holy See. This news, although concerning, got quite buried by the chaos that would happen in the following years.""


Lorenzo moved on the next slide, which showed a photo of an old man, his long white beard a contrast to his dark blue suit. Next to the photo was written ""Antonio De Angelis (2013 - 2089)"", a name actually somewhat familiar to the class, whom most certainly heard it being cursed to by their grandparents at least a couple times.

""This is Antonio De Angelis. He's a man from Rimini Nuova and you have probably heard of him for his activity as a diplomat during the conflicts between Costa Serena and Rimini Nuova before Unification.
While he is mostly known for that, he is also the founder of the San Marino Remembrance project, which built the Monument.

Now, it might seem weird that a Riminese to do this, but there is a reason for it.""

With another click on the keyboard, another slide appeared, with a grainy, blurry picture of a young girl's face.

""This was De Angelis' girlfriend at the time of the Vanishing, Giovanna Meli. I'm sorry if it's not really... well, clear, but I think this is the only photo we have? I had to cut it from a larger one in the Facebook Archive and-

Let's... not digress, no. Well, thing is, Giovanna was from San Marino. And while De Angelis survived by going on a swim that day, she did not.

She was... in the mainland. Despite the general mess of the directly post-Vanishing Italy and the heavy rebuilding needed for Rimini Nuova to grow, De Angelis has said to have tried searching for her, taking part in some exploration missions in the hinterland.""

Much more focused, Lorenzo pressed forward again, this time showing a slide containing the photos of three old people, two men and a woman.


""De Angelis never got over Giovanna, he never married or got engaged with anyone else. Although he said to have had the idea for a while, the whole project started only in 2068, when he was staying in Palermo for diplomatic talks about the integration of Rimini Nuova in the Italian Republic.

On the 20th of May, he sat down at a bar to have some coffee and chatted with Rita Casadei, the owner."" Lorenzo said, pointing at the old woman in the slide.

""Eventually the whole diplomatic thing became a topic of conversation and, hearing of Rimini, Rita mentioned that she used to go there in the summer as a little girl, as that was the only really good beach place near San Marino. Of course, De Angelis became interested, as he had taken for granted all the Sanmarinese had died in the Vanishing. They talked about it for a while, then he left Rita his contacts and went back to diplomatic work.
Rita and De Angelis continued to talk to eachother, and eventually Rita mentioned that she had been in contact with another Sanmarinese, a man living in Caltanissetta by the name of Astolfo Casadei- and no, they weren't related, it was a common surname."" Lorenzo continued, pointing at the old man on the right.

""It was only then that De Angelis properly introduced Rita to the idea of the Remembrance Monument, an idea he had thought of years prior, but also put aside due to a lack of resources and time. He also told her of Giovanna, who was the main reason behind his desire to bring back at least something of the old Republic and so, well, of her. Rita was instantly supportive of the idea and informed her friends, including Astolfo, of the project. 

Thanks to that, and thanks to De Angelis being already a fairly known person in Italy, the idea of the Remembrance Monument became famous in Italy, concerning the government. So, after he had finished the deals between Italy and Rimini Nuova, De Angelis started working on his project with Rita and, later, Astolfo.

After doing some research, he discovered that three Sanmarinese citizens had survived the Vanishing in Italian Territory. Rita, Astolfo and Mauro Gasperoni."" And he pointed at the old man on the left, whose photo was definitely taken from some sort of tombstone.


""Unfortunately, Mauro, who lived in Mamoiada, Sardinia, was already quite old when the Vanishing happened, being 85, unlike Rita who was 12 and Astolfo who was 20. So when De Angelis had found informations about it, he had also discovered of his death in 2035.

Despite that, he would still go to Mamoiada to interview the workers in his retirement home and the other old people of the town to get as much information as possible about him.""

With another click, Lorenzo moved to a slide named ""Phase 1"" and overfilled with text, which he followed verbatim in some parts.

""So, for the first phase of the project, De Angelis went on to collect as much as he could from the two citizens and from people with Sanmarinese descent. While he could find the best accounts on the history of San Marino from the libraries that had survive in Sardinia and Sicily, he wanted more. He wanted those folklore tales, those lullabies that are passed from grandpas to grandkids, those silly anecdotes that remains in the circles of your local city.

He thought that those too made a place... well, that specific place. What gives it soul. So for the following three years he wrote down all that he could find. He wanted to visit New York too, since some of Sanmarinese descent lived there too, but apparently the post-Vanishing chaos had made it impossible to track them, especially after the rationing from the Provisional Government. They did not all die, though. Some reached for the museum in the monument after its founding, although all after De Angelis' death.""

Lorenzo clicked again, predictably reaching a slide named ""Phase 2"".

""After that, De Angelis had to get actual authorization to build the Monument. There was a problem: he wanted to build it in San Marino, but the status of the territory was rather unclear. By the end of 2029, Italy had officially claimed all land within their previous borders. This made the territory of San Marino unclaimed, but just going there and building would have made a scandal. There was a small scandal when some farmers built a deposit in the former territory of Vatican City during the reconstruction of Rome, and well, De Angelis didn't want that, especially after his efforts for the good relationship between Italy and Rimini Nuova.

So he created a petition, got a ton of people to sign it and presented it to the government. Of course, with all the legal stuff necessary, I didn't really get that... well, at the end of the day, the Italian Government conceded a permission to build the Monumental Complex, protection by the Italian army in the border territory and some funds for the project. So now it was time to build the buildings themselves and- I think I can go to the architectural section, right, miss Tonina?""


The teacher nodded, and Lorenzo went on to explain all the necessary details that went into construction, design philosophy... maybe too many details. As he had been in the history section, Lorenzo went a little too verbose in the architectural one as well.

While Tonina appreciated the research done, the realization that Lorenzo had occupied most of her hour wasn't exactly pleasant to her. It probably was for her students, of course, considering that their presentation had to be postponed for another day.

Lorenzo noticed it too, as he glanced at the clock to his left and read the time, dangerously close to lunchtime.

""Oh- okay I'll skip the music hall and the post-VVV attack renovations and wrap it up, is that okay?""
Tonina nodded again, and the boy moved to his last slide, which featured a large obelisk, with the statue of an old man on top.


""This section of the complex is just named The Tombstone. It is a cenotaph, which is a tomb where there's nobody inside, it's symbolical.

The Tombstone was made with local rocks and hand-sculpted, because San Marino himself was a stonemason. On top of the obelisk there's a statue of him.

On the bottom, there is a carved drawing of the coat of arms of San Marino, which has its three towers, represented by three light poles in the Monumental Complex in their exact location and can be seen from The Tombstone. On the bottom-bottom, there are the three photos of the last three citizens, with their dates of birth and death. Finally, below the coat of arms, there are also two dates. The first is 301, the mythological date of founding. The second is 2092, when Rita died in Palermo.

While it may seem weird and sad, it was on purpose. De Angelis knew that the country he had researched for years was dead.

He said once to have made a-"" and he quoted the text on the screen ""- 'very, very elaborated funeral'. It's the same reason on why it's called a Remembrance Monument, you do a Remembrance for someone who's dead. Some say it was to make some peace with the world that had been lost, and I think that makes sense.""

A couple of seconds of silence followed, until miss Tonina resumed talking. 


""Done?"" she asked.

""Done."" Lorenzo nodded.

The teacher fixed her glasses and turned back at the class, who was getting ready to go to lunch.

""Well, that was pretty good, Lorenzo, although maybe too verbose, you should work on summarizing for your term papers this year. Although, I didn't ask at the start like the others, so I'll do it now. Why did you choose this monument for the presentation today?""

Lorenzo turned back to his teacher, as he was getting his pen drive back.

""Well, it's... complicated. At first it was because it was near here and maybe I could and see it, but I wasn't able to. Then it sort of- how do I explain it? It kinda makes me sad of think of the old days. I like history but... I will never be there. It's gone for me, for us.

You read about it, you can study it, if you're lucky you can visit, but that's it. I think this monument in a way, gets that. Does that make sense?""

""I can understand that."" The teacher agreed, before sketching a number on the register. 

""I'll let you go with a 8½. Again, work on your summaries next time.""

Tonina then turned to the rest of the class and declared it dismissed, watching her students run out of the class.

She smiled, took her bag and left as well.

- Biological female 
- 5’2” on a good day
- Straight 
- Christian
- Single. Never been engaged nor married. 
- No human kids 
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size
- Easy on the eyes
- No tattoos 
- Not a DDS and BBM supporter

I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning 🩺). During my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from a bookstore.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and going around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie chzz haha. I also enjoy for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely! 💯 

Currently, I’m on a mission to shed some pounds —starting with daily brisk w@lks during sunset, which has been refreshing but feels like I’m being chased by regrets (or carbs 😂). I’m considering joining a gym soon, but I believe in taking it one step at a time. I hear having a cute fitness buddy boosts motivation... so, you in? 😉 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my fun and talkative side 😂

What I’m looking for… A **SINGLE** guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, respectful, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, **26-37 years old** , someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you are:
- well dressed: clean, stylish, and just the right amount of classy 👌🏻
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a **CENOMAR** when we meet 😂)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)
- Love and/or have dogs
- Enjoy spontaneous long drives
- Can appreciate the charm of bookstores and late-night cafés
- From **Cebu City  or Mandaue City** (easier for coffee dates and spontaneous drives). 
- Not a DDS and BBM supporter

1pc8y03,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1pc8y03/follow_your_dreams/,Follow Your Dreams,"“Follow Your Dreams –  A Message from the United States Government” flickered on the digital billboard as Ellias Vance pulled out his buzzing phone. “Late Notice – DRS” flashed across his screen. The bus rattled down the road past the remnants of a once-booming downtown. The smell of burning rubber rose as the tires screeched across the asphalt before stopping in front of a weathered brick apartment building with bars bolted over the windows like prison bars. A large hiss exhaled as the door opened. Ellias stepped off onto the fractured sidewalk and entered the dim lobby of the building.


Down the hallway, a package was pressed right against his apartment door. His heart began to race, palms now cold and damp. He stopped, letting silence settle around him; the world seemed to hold its breath. He waited in stillness, feeling the weight of the moment, an undeniable sense of dread constricted him like a spider swathing its prey. With his eyes closed, he took a deep breath, trying to steady his nerves. Would he ever sleep soundly again? In front of his apartment door lay a package no bigger than a shoebox, a coffin for his peace of mind. The postage was labeled ""DreamViewer Plus – Omni Dreamer"".


He brought the package inside and placed it on the nightstand next to his bed. A letter from the Dream Revenue Services – DRS titled ""Ad-supported supplemental program"" lay next to it. Ellias sat on the edge of his bed, a tear running down his cheek. He held the letter in his hand, reality settled in. 


> Dear Mr. Vance,
> 
> Due to your outstanding balance and in accordance with the Dream Tax Act of 2032, Section 3.7.4, you have been enrolled in the ad-supported supplemental program sponsored by Omni Dreamer. This program will inject advertisements from your exclusive partner into your nightly dreams. You will be required to log in to your DreamViewer Plus account every night before you sleep. Failure to do so will result in prosecution to the fullest extent of the law. Maximum penalty: Up to 10 years federal prison plus fines.

Ellias sat on the edge of his bed, procrastinating sleep like a teenager on a Sunday night. Time ticked away, his eyelids grew heavier and heavier. Before he was swept away to sleep, he slid on his DreamViewer Plus and tapped the power button. A British woman’s voice infiltrated his ears, no, his mind. He wasn’t sure which. “Welcome, please keep your eyes open wide for login.” A blinding red light flashed, scanning his pupils. “Login confirmed: Hello Ellias Vance.” An eerie chill ran down his spine. “Please close your eyes and rest your mind. Goodnight,” the British lady said as he struck his best shavasana pose and drifted to sleep.  


The smell of burgers and hot dogs filled the nippy fall air. A football sailed over his head. He turned his eyes to follow, but the ball disappeared into the crowd of tailgaters. As he searched for the ball, the crowd dispersed like Moses parting the Red Sea, creating a pathway to a large stadium. A massive screen spanning the width of the stadium hung above the entrance. “NEW YORK STATE VS NEW ENGLAND STATE: BUY YOUR TICKETS TODAY” crawled across the screen. A man in a suit stepped away from the crowd, now all staring intently at Ellias. “Season tickets, season tickets,” he yelled at Ellias. “Buy early for next season, let's talk now; discounts!” A thunderous bang roared over him as fighter jets flew over his head, leaving a cloud of condensation that descended around him. As the cloud dissipated, he found himself sitting in the stadium looking down at the field. The field displayed “New York State +3.5” and a list of prop bets such as *will the ball hit the FG post on any kicking play* – things suckers bet on, he thought. A loud whistle pierced his ears. He tried to open his eyes, but they resisted him. “Good morning,” the British lady said in the same monotone voice. “Please review your dream summary before waking up,” a screen filled his vision. On the screen, a list of options appeared: 


* NEW YORK STATE VS NEW ENGLAND STATE TICKETS - ADD TO CART!
* NEW ENGLAND STATE SEASON TICKETS - ADD TO CART!
* THE TAILGATER PACKAGE by TARGET - ADD TO CART!
* NEW YORK STATE +3.5 - MAKE YOUR BET NOW!


He scrolled past all of this before declining each of the options. He checked off the box acknowledging that he is declining a one-time, limited offer. “Have a nice day,” the soon familiar voice signed off.


This became the new normal for Ellias Vance, like millions of other Americans these days. Every night he started the dream ad-supported supplemental program. He felt a sense of hopelessness. He hated how quickly he grew accustomed to this. *You will own nothing – not even your own mind.*


He put on his DreamViewer Plus; another sleepless night. He found himself at a diner, sitting at a bar top. A lit cigarette hung from his mouth, smoke drifting from his nose funneling into his cup of black coffee as if he were in the painting *Nighthawks.* Jazz music played on a jukebox, suddenly interrupted by an ad promoting the *Spotify – Dream Package.* He took a deep puff on the cigarette and placed it in the ashtray, holding his breath. He exhaled, and smoke filled the room like a college frat house on Saturday night. The bartender leaned over, refilling his coffee when he vanished. Ellias flew back out of his chair, a bag was thrown over his head, compressing against his face, leaving him breathless. His arms were pulled behind his back. The rope tightened around his wrists, cutting into his skin. The euphoric sensation of oxygen deprivation spread throughout his body. White light filled the corners of his eyes as life faded away; it felt oddly too easy.


He woke to a roaring ocean wave pelting his face as a car sped through a puddle on the side of the street. He looked down at his wrists; the raw skin burned from where the rope was tied. Across the street was an abandoned factory, spray-painted across the dilapidated brick veneer “WAKE UP” with an arrow pointing down. A DreamViewer Plus lay fractured in pieces. An envelope lay next to the broken headset. Inside the envelope was a simple note.

It happens more often than you'd think. Before you toss it in the trash, there are actually some ways to fix it depending on what's wrong.

**Check What's Actually Broken**

First, figure out what the problem is. Sometimes the dividers just come loose, which is super easy to fix. Other times, the plastic might be cracked or the whole thing is warped from heat or weight. If it's just loose pieces, you're in luck.

**Quick Fixes That Work**

For loose dividers, strong glue like E6000 or a hot glue gun can do the trick. Clean both surfaces first, apply the adhesive, and hold it together for a few minutes. Let it dry completely before putting anything back in.

If the plastic is cracked but still holding together, clear packing tape on the underside can reinforce it. It's not pretty, but if the organizer sits in a drawer, nobody sees it anyway.

Warped organizers are trickier. You can try using a hair dryer to warm up the plastic and gently bend it back into shape, but honestly, this doesn't always work great.

**When It's Time to Replace**

Here's the thing - some desk drawer organizers just aren't worth fixing. If the damage is extensive, you'll spend more time and money on repairs than getting a new one. Cheap plastic organizers tend to break easily, so upgrading to something sturdier makes sense.

You can find better quality options that'll actually last at [this collection of desk drawer organizers](https://athomewave.com/desk-drawer-organizers). They've got different sizes and materials, so you can pick something that fits your drawer and actually holds up.

**Prevention Tips**

Don't overload your organizers. Just because a compartment exists doesn't mean you should cram it full. Heavy items like staplers and tape dispensers can warp plastic over time.

Keep hot items away from your desk drawers. Coffee mugs or anything warm can warp plastic organizers faster than you'd think.

Clean them occasionally. Dust and debris can actually make plastic more brittle over time.

**The Bottom Line**

Minor repairs work fine for small issues, but if your organizer is seriously damaged, you're better off replacing it. A good quality desk drawer organizer isn't expensive and will save you the headache of dealing with broken compartments and scattered supplies.

Check out [these desk drawer organizers](https://athomewave.com/desk-drawer-organizers) if you're ready for an upgrade. Sometimes the smartest fix is just starting fresh with something that'll actually last.",1,1764683307.0,hubproducts,0,1.0,False

She told me that she is very interested in “plant medicine“ or Ayawaska and frequently does Ayawaska ceremonies and hangs out in those communities with people who are very involved in this kind of thing. This is a bit of an unknown topic for me although I’m open minded to things like that. She seems to do Ayawaska almost every week or every other week and is involved in hosting ceremonies. I don’t know if I’m overthinking or not but it feels to me like it may be a red flag? I don’t know why but it just seems a little like a bit of an overuse? 

While, I could see myself trying Ayawaska it does seem to me that if doing Ayawaska is such a huge part of a person’s identity it could lead to some kind of issues? she says that it has helped her through her healing journey because she has gone through many traumas however, I can’t help but wonder when does the healing journey end? It may or may not cause an actual problem in the relationship, but it’s such a foreign territory to me that I don’t really know what to make a bit. Iowa Aska has always seen me like a thing that people probably just do a couple times in their lifetime and travel to Peru or something like that. Doing it on a weekly basis while hanging out with all these polyamorous hippie people seems to open itself up for some trouble but then again maybe I’m just being too conservative and overthinking something?

Aside from this, she also shared with me the fact that she has HSV2 a.k.a. herpes. This also freaked me out a little bit because I’m not so familiar but she did tell me that she takes medication for it to keep it in remission and is very on top of this. I have not really thought about herpes in years because I haven’t even heard the word in a while, but she told me that more people have it than I am aware of and as long as people Stay in control of it, it’s easy to stop from showing with a partner 

If anybody can give me their opinion on either the Ayawaska usage or the herpes issue, it would help me out a lot. Like I said the connection is really good and I could see the potential but I also am a little freaked out about contracting herpes but then again maybe it’s not that big big deal and more people have it than I really know of? It’s certainly a green flag that she told me. Even if she has a fully functional life while using Ayawaska is it possibly a little too much usage of a psychedelic substance? I have never done it so please forgive me. Just looking for some advice.

And I remember being upset because Florida was cold and I was obviously trying to get away from the cold lol.  Even the animals outside of the place I was staying at— they were acting strangely and just coming up to people. 
Anyways there was a lot of stuff that I can’t seem to remember in between… next thing I do remember is I was walking down the street after escaping this persons house— this lady wanted me to stay at her house and was being weird and overbearing I had to get out of there— especially since they weren’t paying attention to what was going on outside— anyways I was walking down the street and  taking pictures with my phone of the beautiful sky! It had suddenly turned a beautiful shade of pink (all over) I remember standing in front of a store that had a small crystal chandelier in front of it hanging above their entry door. The sun with the pinks and the chandelier made for some sweet colors.  I remember crying it was so beautiful. 
As I was taking pictures these two girls noticed me and looked mad at me… like they realized I was there or something??? So I started reassuring them that I’m not a threat…soon as I did that the sky got dim and I noticed planes were coming with  messages trailing behind them… I wish I could remember what they said!!! They were warning messages for sure… like “get somewhere safe” etc… after they were gone a bunch of chemtrails spread across the sky… I was trying to tell people something was coming but they were too busy living their lives like normal. Shopping… not caring.

Sister in laws, cousins, his family, his ex and the whole town.
Nobody knew me or even tried to get to know me.
 I couldn't shop for groceries,  we have one grocerie store and we had to travel an hour away for everything. I couldn't get a hair stylist for both my daughter and I.  I couldn't join any groups because his ex and sisters in laws told the whole town that he cheated on her with me and I forced him to leave her , but we met a year after his separation?
Forced him, how I wonder... 
I couldn't join any excerise classes, I was talked about and ignored no matter where I went. Doctors, hospital, pharmacy, for a walk in town, coffee shops. Day in and day out for 7 years.
We stay home, we both dont leave our yard. We dont talk to or about anyone. We keep all our business to ourselves no matter if its good news or bad..
Now, this is affecting my daughter even more. She is having a hard time finding work because of all the lies and gossip.  Her supervisor found out who my daughter was, now she is being harassed  by her supervisor by telling my daughter that her mom is a disgusting horrible person and she has heard many things about me, but yet hasn't talked to me once.  her hours got cut to 10 hours a week. 
My husband wanted to move away , but he has a great job and my daughter was in school so we disnt want to make her start all over

Joined gyms I never used. Started programs I quit after a week. Felt like my body was just broken.

Then I stopped overcomplicating it and focused on 5 simple things. Now I actually look forward to working out.

Here's what actually worked:

1. You need a program, not random workouts I used to just ""do some weights"" with no plan. Zero progress. Then I followed an actual 3-day program - push, pull, legs. Knowing exactly what to do each session removed all the guesswork and excuses.

2. Protein isn't optional I wasn't eating enough protein and wondering why I looked the same after months. Started hitting 0.8g per pound of body weight. My body finally had the building blocks to actually change. Get a protein shake if real food feels like too much.

3. Progressive overload is the only thing that matters If you're not lifting slightly heavier or doing more reps than last week, you're just maintaining. I started logging every workout. Each week I tried to beat last week by even just one rep. That's how you force your body to adapt.

4. You don't need 6 days a week I burned out trying to go every day. Now I do 3-4 days consistently and I've seen better results than when I was trying to be a gym rat. Consistency beats intensity. Every time.

5. Walking is underrated as hell I added 30-minute walks daily and lost more fat than when I was doing cardio that I hated. Walking doesn't drain you, doesn't make you hungry, and actually helps recovery. Plus you can listen to podcasts or music.

The diet part (super simple):

* Eat protein with every meal (chicken, eggs, Greek yogurt, protein shakes)
* Cut out liquid calories (soda, juice, fancy coffee drinks)
* Eat carbs around your workout for energy
* Don't try to be perfect, just be consistent 80% of the time

Mistakes I made early on:

* Comparing myself to people on steroids or who'd been training for years
* Changing my program every 2 weeks because I wasn't seeing results fast enough
* Doing too much too soon and burning out

The mental shift that changed everything: I stopped asking ""What's the perfect workout?"" and started asking ""What can I actually stick to for 6 months?""

An okay program you follow beats a perfect program you quit.

Start with 3 days a week. Full body or push/pull/legs. Doesn't matter which. Just pick one and don't change it for 8 weeks.

Track your workouts. Eat more protein. Walk more. Sleep 8 hours.

That's literally it. You'll see changes in 8 weeks if you just don't quit.",2,1764683012.0,TheImprovementRoom,0,1.0,False
1pc8rvs,https://i.redd.it/ekg8dp9los4g1.png,I built my own Reddit posting engine for $0.,"I know there are dozens of tools to automate social media these days.

But being a builder at heart, I created my own Reddit posting engine.

**Cost: $0** 

**Time to build: <2 hours** 

**Technical skills needed: Minimal**

Here's exactly how I did it (no gatekeeping):

**The Stack (All Free Tiers)**

→ Composio: Connects to Reddit's API without dealing with OAuth headaches 

→ Google Gemini: Generates subreddit-specific posts (free tier = 60 requests/min) 

→ Python: \~100 lines of actual logic

**What It Does**

1. Reads my content files (product info, tweets, notes)
2. Picks a random subreddit from my target list
3. Uses AI to craft a post that fits that community's vibe
4. Posts it automatically

One command. Done.

**The ""Secret"" That Isn't Secret**

Most people think automation requires:

* Complex APIs
* Expensive tools
* Engineering teams

Reality: Modern AI tools have democratized this.

Composio handles the Reddit authentication. Gemini handles the content generation. Python just connects the dots.

**My Workflow Now**

Morning coffee → Run script → Post goes live → Move on with my day

No scheduling tools. No monthly subscriptions. No learning curve.

**The Real Value**

It's not about the automation itself.

It's about understanding HOW things work.

When you build your own tools:

* You control the output
* You learn the underlying systems
* You can customize endlessly
* You're not dependent on any platform

**Want to Build Your Own?**

Here's what you need:

1. A Composio account (free) - [composio.dev](http://composio.dev)
2. A Google AI Studio key (free) - [https://aistudio.google.com/](https://aistudio.google.com/)
3. Basic Python knowledge (or Opus to help you)

The entire script is \~100 lines.

If you can copy-paste and follow instructions, you can do this.

**Why I'm Sharing This**

Because I believe builders should share their tools.

1pc8q3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hashimotos/comments/1pc8q3m/introduction/,introduction,"Hello everyone!

TLDR is just my journey with Gout and figuring out how I most likely have pre-hashimoto's and steps I've taken this year to improve. Other than the gout and a few typical labs, this was all under the radar - never tested.

\--

I'm somewhat ""self-diagnosed"" early hashimoto's / autoimmune thyroiditis here - have suffered with gout for 5.5 years. My dr has consistently tested heart, lipid, uric acid and once a 24 hour urine test in this time period. My dr has only ever focused on my gout and never told me for sure I had dislipidemia and would ask me if I had any ""dry skin"" but never tell me why. I've always been skeptical of my 10 minutes with a dr and have tried to find answers and resolution without ULT - for now.

I spent years reading and chasing wisdom on inflammatory pathways and how to reduce the load. And ChatGPT, while needing to be cautious, has been incredibly useful at providing interesting tidbits I can research after.

In late 2024 I did a chat with my insurance and they told me additional tests would be up to the discretion of my dr and most are not authorized. So I sought additional testing via function health and tested in April and learned of some thyroid concerns, omega-3/omega-6 ratio issues, etc. Most of my labs were normal but some concerns:

low T (total/free/DHT), Low PSA %, apo A1, HDL

elevated CRP, homocysteine, Apo B, fibrinogen, triglycerides, IGF-1, MMA (fixed with b-complex supplement), Arachidonic Acid, TgAb 23, TPO 522, TSH 4.75.

I've been following a pretty strict WFPB diet the last 7+ weeks but have had a lull with Thanksgiving. I'm back now and I use ChatGPT to help give me recipe ideas and connect dots in inflammatory pathways and other systems. I did most of this just before my followup blood work (just before Thanksgiving) and my CRP, homocysteine, Apo B, LDL, non-HDL, Arachidonic acid, and MMA made modest improvements. I still have work to do and takes time to fix years of issues.

One huge revelation I've had with this is that the compensated hypothyroidism causes slow renal excretion of uric acid which I believe is part of why I have gout on occasion. Fasting also affects this (learning just today skipping dinner 1-2x a week is safe) as the kidneys prioritize ketones over uric acid.

Most of my focus in my recipes has been around omega-3 and vegetables, fruits, oats, fiber, minerals, spices, etc. And have only started a few key supplements that I hope to remove as I fix these things.

Another interesting tidbit about me - I quit coffee in early October 2024 and have had more energy than the years before (major fatigue the last few years there) and found that coffee and tea made my gout flares way worse - had a flare in March 2025 that I couldn't beat and had just recently started drinking rose-hip / hibiscus / ashwaghanda / and other ""supposed to be great for gout"" type teas. I learned that they're also diuretic in nature which competes with uric acid.

My goal with my labs is to take them to my dr and tell them that they need to authorize testing and monitoring for a while and at least once every 5 years. To me, this would be a noble effort of the red cross to gain participants in donating blood - look at inflammation and other ghost symptoms. If they come back normal - great! but maybe they'd gain more lifelong donors.

Does anyone else utilize WFPB to treat their hashimoto's? For me this was under the radar and may have never broken the surface or been tested for from what I've read.

the excuses are always the same. ""im so tired i cant,"" ""something came up sorry,"" ""not really feeling up to it today."" and i get it, sometimes stuff happens. but then ill see her instagram stories later that same night and shes out at dinner with other people or at some party. so clearly she wasnt too tired.

last month i drove 25 minutes to meet her for coffee and she texted me when i was literally in the parking lot that she ""wasnt feeling great"" and had to cancel. i was already there. and then that evening she posted a photo at target with her sister.

i stopped suggesting plans but she kept reaching out wanting to hang out. so i started saying yes and then canceling last minute with her exact excuses. verbatim. ""so tired today cant make it."" ""something came up sorry."" ""not really feeling up to it.""

did this maybe 3 or 4 times over a few weeks.

she finally texted me yesterday all pissed off saying its ""really rude and inconsiderate"" to keep canceling on her and how she ""makes time in her schedule"" for me. i was like yeah it IS rude isnt it. thats exactly what youve been doing to me for months.

The pay was bad, the work was boring, and the highlight of my day was timing my coffee break just right. To keep my brain from melting, I started devouring everything I could about SEO and digital marketing online—blogs, YouTube tutorials, you name it. It was just a hobby, a way to feel like I was learning something useful.

One Sunday at a family dinner, my uncle was venting about his plumbing business. He'd been a plumber for 20 years, was amazing at his job, but was getting crushed by bigger companies online. He complained that his phone just wasn't ringing anymore. I took a look at his website later that night, and… yikes. It looked like something from the dial-up era and had zero chance of ever being found on Google.

Trying to sound way more confident than I felt, I told him, ""Hey, I've been learning some of this marketing stuff. I think I can help you show up when people in town search for a plumber."" He just kind of laughed and said, ""Sure, kid. Go for it. Just don't break anything."" He gave me $200, which I'm pretty sure he considered a donation to my 'little hobby.'

I spent the next month completely rebuilding his site on WordPress, rewriting all the content, and setting up his Google Business Profile properly with pictures and service areas. I started a small blog for him, writing articles like ""3 Signs Your Water Heater is About to Fail."" It was slow at first. Crickets. I started to think I'd just wasted my uncle's money. Then, about two months in, he called me. ""I don't know what you did,"" he said, ""but the phone rang three times today from the website. That's more than I got all last month.""

That was the turning point. That little taste of seeing my work *actually* help a real person and a family business was more satisfying than any praise I'd ever gotten at my office job. The calls kept coming in for him, and it gave me the tiny seed of confidence I needed to eventually quit my job and pursue this for real. It all started with a skeptical uncle and 200 bucks.

Chapter 110: Date (JereMike and DoriMike)1989/11/29,12/02,12/03

Summary:

1989/11/29, 1989/12/02, 1989/12/03

---

A few days ago, Doris and Jeremy’s reactions failed to convince Michael that they weren’t flirting or seeing each other in private. So, a few days later, Michael decides to invite them separately to a café and see how they react.

One morning, he puts his plan into action.

“Jeremy, you free to grab a coffee with me sometime?” Michael asks casually in the middle of small talk, eyes still on the paperwork.

“Sure! Sure! When? I’ll clear my schedule!” Jeremy lifts his head from his documents immediately, answering with a pause between each phrase, each one delivered with force. Honestly, the guy’s kind of like a big dog.

Michael rubs his brow, looking exasperated. “Are you free this Saturday—don’t clear other things for me.” The “don’t” comes out especially sharp.

“Yeah, I’ve got the whole afternoon free!” Jeremy smiles brightly, a little shy, looking genuinely happy.

Michael watches him, the corner of his mouth curling up slightly.

After talking with Jeremy, his next step is to test Doris.

At lunch, during their usual banter when Doris is pestering him, he throws it out casually:

“Didn’t you ask me about going to a café last time? I’m free this Sunday.”

Doris pauses mid-ramble, blinks.

“…It’s rare for you to ask me out! I’m happy, hehe.”

She grins, and that dazzling smile makes Michael’s chest ache.

“…What time are you free?”
He looks away, not wanting to keep staring, forcing the words out.

“All day! Breakfast at ten, coffee at noon, park walk at three, dinner and a movie at six—how’s that?” Doris looks even happier, smiling wide enough to show both dimples and the liwo by her lips, counting on her fingers like she’s been waiting for this kind of conversation for ages.

Michael taps her on the head. “I only said coffee.” But he’s smiling—eyes included—and Doris notices.

“Aww… then tell me if you’re free the rest of the time.”

She gives him big, watery eyes, full of hope and a hint of “how could you trick me” stubbornness.

“…Fine.” Michael’s tone loosens, his smile turning a little helpless. He gently rubs the spot he tapped earlier—his way of apologizing.

Doris leans into the head rub.
And when Michael pulls his hand away, she presses it back.

“Can you… keep going?” she asks, blinking up at him.

Michael pulls his hand back.

“Don’t push your luck.” He rolls his eyes.

But his gaze flicks to the hand that just touched her head.

That lunch passes in that kind of mood.

The day of the date…

Jeremy’s turn

Jeremy wears a pale yellow shirt with a light blue undershirt, khaki pants, a white belt, and white sneakers.

With his blond hair, amber eyes, white teeth, and fair skin, he looks like he’s glowing. When Michael arrives, he waves enthusiastically, smiling wide enough to show a faint pair of dimples, cheeks slightly flushed.

They go to a bookstore café—a place perfect for whiling away an afternoon with a book.

Jeremy picks mostly short story collections. Sometimes, when he likes a scene, he shares it with Michael.
Some stories Michael likes, earning a comment:

“Not bad.”

Others… not so much, and he forces out:

“…It’s fine.”

Luckily, after the third time Michael shows zero interest in romance plots, Jeremy stops sharing them.

Same with crime files—Michael already knows William, thanks. Just thinking of that old man makes him queasy.

When Michael takes too long picking a book, Jeremy comes over:
“Having trouble? What kind of books do you like? I know this place better—let me help.”

“Thanks.”
Michael doesn’t refuse, and with Jeremy’s help, he picks a few.

When Michael decides to put some back, he frowns. “I forgot where these go.”

“No problem, I’ll check the call numbers.” Jeremy takes the books naturally and returns them to the right spot.

Back at their seats, Jeremy says nothing—he’s already figured out that Michael hates being interrupted while reading. The only break he makes is when Michael’s almost done with his coffee, refilling both cups even though his own is still half full.

They spend a quiet, pleasant afternoon, learning more about each other’s tastes.

Michael feels relaxed.

Testing further? That’d be stupid.

But Jeremy’s gaze is too warm—it stings.

Doris’s turn… Sunday, 10 AM

In Michael’s imagination, girls usually dress up a little.
In reality…

She overdoes it.

Her hair:

Her usual blue is already eye-catching, but today she’s sprayed on “light blue” highlights. And clipped in a blue starry-cat hairpin.

Her makeup:

Normally barefaced—
Now she’s wearing pale blue eyeshadow on her double-lidded eyes, a shadowed lift at the corners making them sharper, a thin sweep of orange-tinted blush, and even pale blue lipstick. On Asian skin, surprisingly, it works.

None of these are mainstream tones…
She’s put more effort into this than I’ve ever put into drawing animatronics in my nightmares.

Her clothes:

It’s the first time Michael’s seen her in a skirt—and it’s not what he expected.

A blue-purple starry crop top with fringe at the hem, high-waisted denim skirt-short hybrids down to mid-thigh, loaded with metal charms. Long fingerless gloves with her left hand covered in rings.

The familiar blue dreamcatcher she bought when they went for tea last time.

Her legs… Michael swears he wasn’t staring.

Mismatched blue long and short socks with garters, somehow perfectly balanced. Black-and-blue crossbody bag. Chunky-heeled long boots, maybe three centimeters.

Metal star hair clip on her boots—for theme consistency, damn it.

The bag is crowded with pins, jingling charms, and even a tiny blue plush bear.

In the 80s, who else could pull off looking like a 202X anime geek? Michael rolls his eyes but doesn’t say it.

Doris catches it—feels the sting—but hides it.

“Looks good?” She keeps smiling, spinning for him.

“…Yeah. Looks good.”
Damn it, it really does.

It suits her—like a blue star that won’t change for anyone.

During the date, Michael feels people’s eyes sticking to them wherever they go, but Doris doesn’t seem to notice. She even buys two scoops of chocolate ice cream from a passing truck and asks Michael if he wants one.

“No thanks. Will you still have room for breakfast after that?” Michael sighs, but seeing her oblivious, goofy look, the corners of his mouth curl up.

“Boss, I’ll pay the difference—can you change it to one scoop each?”

“Sure thing,” the vendor says cheerfully.

“…Thanks, hehe.” Doris says thank you, but eats her ice cream a little subdued, quietly biting into the scoop.

Then they realize something.

They both eat ice cream the same way.

Biting the cone is common, but biting directly into the ice cream? That’s rare.

They exchange a glance, then burst out laughing like it’s the funniest thing in the world, tears streaming down their faces. People around them move away.

After that, they walk to the breakfast place with their ice cream.

Doris orders a waffle-and-salad set with milk tea, packing up the extra two waffles.

Michael watches her tear into the salad, shoving lettuce into her mouth without pause. With only a little left, she picks up the plate to eat the final bites.

Does this person even realize she’s on a date? Her lipstick’s already smudged away.

Michael feels like he’s losing his mind, but it only shows in the deeper furrow of his brow, his expression carrying a hint of distaste.

With a resigned look, he wipes Doris’s mouth with a napkin. Doris grins—brightly, fully.

It’s not the first time Michael’s noticed she has dimples, but…

the left one is deep, the right one lighter—and on that same right side, there’s also a small hollow tucked closer to the corner of her mouth. A dimple and a liwo, together.

He’s certain Doris isn’t the type to get cosmetic work done. This family’s genes are ridiculous.

“What’s wrong, Michael?” Doris tilts her head slightly when she catches him staring, her cheeks flushing.

She’s shy? Michael always thought her skin was impenetrable.

While he’s still frozen, Doris leans forward, pressing her forehead to his.

“A little warm, but you’re probably not sick…”

It doesn’t feel dangerous, so he doesn’t move away.

Close. Too close—her lips.

Wait—did she just say warm?

Michael turns to the window’s reflection and realizes his face is bright red.

“I’m fine. You did that on purpose, didn’t you? Salad destroyer.”

“Salad’s delicious…” Doris huffs into her milk tea, her cheeks puffing up around the straw. Soft—probably would cry if squeezed.

Michael doesn’t try.

“You’re not going to eat those two waffles?” he asks, nodding at the bag, eyes on her slim hands.

“Can’t finish them,” she mutters.

“You’re too thin.” Michael frowns, glancing at her waist—not unhealthy-thin, even with faint abs, but still…

He remembers her saying she’s five-foot-four and about a hundred and nine pounds.

How does she carry heavy work stuff?

“You don’t have to pretend to eat less around me. I’m not the kind of guy who’s turned off by a girl’s appetite.” Michael crosses his arms, not pleased.

“I’m naturally like this. I eat small meals more often—by the time we get to the café later, I’ll probably be hungry again. Perfect for lunch,” Doris says like it’s a life hack.

Michael’s not convinced.

At noon, they go to a wooden, cozy café with relaxing sofas, a nice view, and a few books. Huge windows look out onto a yard with ducks, cats, and dogs. Inside, cats roam freely.

“The owner loves taking in strays,” Doris explains, crouching to scratch a cat’s chin.

This is basically a future cat café, Michael thinks.

He has to admit, it’s relaxing. Over coffee, Doris becomes a climbing post for cats, and she shares some cat treats with Michael.

“So… that day, you really were just talking work with Jeremy?” Michael asks idly while Doris is playing with a cat.

“Oh no, we were talking about you. You’ve noticed he likes you, right?” Doris drops the line like a bomb.

“…Huh?” Michael’s sudden voice scares off the cat.

“I just wanted to make you jealous. Jeremy just wanted to chat. It worked, hehe.” She sticks her tongue out.

Michael feels defeated, but relieved.

“Wait—you talk about me? Aren’t love rivals supposed to fight?”

“Secret, hehe.”

“Hehe what?” Michael messes up her hair in revenge, but she enjoys it, not even caring when her hairpin falls.

He clicks his tongue, picks it up, and clips it back in.

Hopeless. She’s got him completely.

At three, they walk in the park. Her lipstick is mostly gone, but she can’t be bothered to reapply.

They stroll by the lake, chatting, close but without crossing lines.

At six, Doris buys street food, telling the stall owner:

“The usual, but two servings—out on a date with a friend today.”

“Who goes on a date with a friend? Is this young man your boyfriend?”

“Still in the flirting stage.”

“Oh? Be careful not to get tricked. I’ve watched you grow up—here, today’s date gets a discount.”

“Thanks, you’re the best!”

Michael’s used as a bargaining chip. The exchange is so fast he doesn’t get a word in.

They eat the street food for dinner, then watch… not a romance movie, but a true-crime serial killer documentary.

“That severed hand’s fresh enough to do a finger dance,” Michael mutters, frowning.

“I know, right? Looks so fake.”
She agrees?

“How do you know?” he asks, surprised, keeping his voice down.

“I went to med school for a year for… reasons. I’ve seen real specimens.”

Michael’s starting to think Doris is kind of dangerous.

When it shifts to R18—but not R18G—scenes, Doris covers her ears.

“Michael, tell me when this part’s over, or I’ll get embarrassed.”

It’s not embarrassment, it’s non-consensual, Doris…

He opens his mouth, then shuts it, deciding to just watch the movie.

He’s used up his snark quota for the day.

Afterward, on the way to drop Doris off, they chat and pick apart the bad parts of the film.

The past two days feel full—like a dream.

Not the kind of life Michael Afton is supposed to have.

1pc8hm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnitarianUniversalist/comments/1pc8hm5/should_i_just_accept_that_i_do_not_fit/,Should I just accept that I do not fit?,"I have been a member of my church for a decade. I attended regularly pre covid because I had a kid in RE. I am back to attending most Sundays now. I help with the Fellowship committee and making coffee.

My kid has since graduated and is almost done with college. She still attends church, but has joined a different UU congregation. 

I have never felt like I belonged in this church. It is the closest church to me, but is in a very specific “neighborhood” and if you aren’t part of that neighborhood you are an outsider. It is a very wealthy area, but it isn’t impossible for people of all income levels to make it their home if you want to rent or live in a flat. I like owning a house with a yard, so that area is out of my budget. The schools are really good there and it is often implied that parents who don’t send their kids to the best school they can are doing a disservice to their kids. My kid dealt with the snobbishness better than I did, TBH. She is now very active in her inner city congregation. I could list in detail some of the backhanded comments we have heard over the years.

Is there something I can do to get past this? I feel like this is really about my own self confidence and my issues with growing up very poor. I am very financially secure in my lower middle class suburb. I have a home I love. 

I am too embarrassed to offer to hosts friends from church for anything though. I only live about 20 minutes from the church, so not too far for most people I would think, but it seems that way. My house is better set up for out door events, so I was thinking of having some people over for tea in the spring. Does this seem like a good idea? 

I am sure this is about me and my own insecurities, but it does make me wonder if maybe I need to find a new spiritual home that embraces me as I am.

I did try other churches in the area, I might look into UCC, because I still consider myself a Christian. I have visited a lot of churches I have liked, but they are all very far away (I attend one in Florida a couple times a year and another is almost 2 hours away).",5,1764682250.0,UnitarianUniversalist,3,1.0,False

The cinammon bun was very balanced and the cream cheese frosting gave it a nice kick. I enjoyed the whipped, fluffy texture of the accompaniment as well as the fact that it wasn't diabetically sweet but just right. 

The bun was £4 and whilst it may seem to be on the higher side. It's understandable for a cafe that's next to the station (Holloway Road).

I wouldn't rate them as highly as scenery but Rua is just another example of how strong London's cafe scene is.

1pc8akh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1pc8akh/how_do_i_lose_weight_in_this_situation_with_gout/,How do I lose weight in this situation with gout and insomnia(when on calories deficit diet),"Hi everyone,

I really need some guidance about weight loss and diet. 

I will try to explain point wise.

1. **Past weight loss**
   * I used to do intermittent fasting for many years.
   * I was on around 1800 calories per day, calorie deficit.
   * It worked well earlier. I went from 84 kg to 68 kg once (around 16 kg loss).
   * Then I slowly gained back the weight.
2. **Low carb phase and problems**
   * Around 5–6 months back I started low carb along with intermittent fasting.
   * Not super strict keto, but I reduced normal wheat and rice.
   * I was eating chapatis made from emmer wheat / ragi / bajra / jowar, and less regular wheat/rice.
   * Weight loss was happening, but suddenly my sleep got totally messed up.
   * I got almost complete insomnia. I was going crazy, could not understand why.
   * I went to doctors, they told me take sunlight, morning walk, ashwagandha etc.
   * I even took sleeping pills for some time, but still my sleep was very bad.
   * Along with that I started getting very bad headaches.
   * It continued for 2 months, and they were like the worst days of my life.
3. **Flu + change of diet**
   * Then I got flu and at that time my headache was next level.
   * When I coughed, my head used to feel like it is exploding, extreme pain.
   * At that point I decided to stop all “dieting” and just eat normal Indian food.
   * I started having things like poha with eggs in the morning, normal chapati, some rice etc.
   * Within a few days I noticed my sleep improved a lot (maybe 80 percent better).
   * Headache also went down a lot, still like 10–15 percent remains, but much better than before.
4. **Current situation (weight and sleep)**
   * Right now my weight is around 82 kg.
   * Sleep is still not 100 percent okay, maybe 80–85 percent.
   * Headache is also still there at a low level.
   * Because I am scared of that insomnia and headache coming back, I am not able to go into strict calorie deficit again.
   * So I am slowly gaining or at least not losing weight.
5. **Gout and uric acid issues**
   * I have high uric acid and gout in my knees.
   * If I eat meat (chicken, mutton etc) regularly, my knees start paining badly.
   * Even pea / pea protein can trigger a gout attack for me.
   * So I cannot do a typical “high protein” diet like others suggest.
   * I can eat eggs but not many in one sitting. I try to spread them out.
6. **What protein I can take**
   * I can tolerate milk and whey protein.
   * So I use milk and around 15–20 g whey to manage some protein.
   * I am able to reach around 70–80 g protein per day.
   * My current weight is 82 kg, so I know it is not very high protein, but if I increase too much, my gout starts troubling my knees.
7. **Exercise limitations**
   * Because of gout and knee pain, I cannot run or do jumping / high impact exercises.
   * Before Covid I used to run on treadmill at high speed, I was quite fit.
   * Now my knees feel weak and I am scared to push too much.
8. **My current daily food (rough idea)**
   * Morning: Poha with one large egg (free range) + chai.
   * Afternoon: Milk coffee (motherdairy pro milk) + 3 emmer wheat rotis + seasonal sabji.
   * Evening / night:
      * 1 serving whey protein (15–20 g) with milk.
      * Later, sweet potato + 2 boiled eggs (one with yolk, one without yolk).
      * 1 glass hot chocolate milk.
   * For sweetness I mostly use erythritol / allulose or very little sugar (like 1/4 teaspoon per glass).
   * I try to keep overall sugar low.
   * I take multivitamin+probiotic+magnesium supplements
9. **My main questions**
   * Why did my sleep almost disappear and why did I get such bad headaches when I was in calorie deficit + low carb, even though I had been dieting earlier also without such big issues?
   * Is it possible that low carb or too much restriction was causing this insomnia and headache for me, even if doctors did not directly say it?
   * In my situation (gout, knee pain, limited meat, limited eggs, only milk + whey, pollution, low exercise), how can I lose weight in a safe way without destroying my sleep again?
   * Is 70–80 g protein per day okay for 82 kg person who is not very active, or should I somehow push it more even with uric acid issues?
   * Are there any other Indians here with gout / high uric acid who managed to lose weight without high meat / high protein diet? What kind of food and routine worked for you?
10. **What I am looking for**

why am i not able to do low calorie diet, also how to fix my remaining 15% headache and 20% sleep, i am afraid, if i'll eat more, i'll gain a lot of weight. I am in very ""don't know what to do"" kind of state now. Is there any mistake i am doing?

Any advice or suggestions will really help. Thanks a lot in advance. 🙏

The thing is though, we seem to have fallen into taking each other for granted, feeling too comfortable, lack of effort has now pushed way to feeling a little invisible, plus we have older kids who will probably fly the nest within a few years, and so im unsure how we'll navigate just being a couple.*

**Things that i like:**  
*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

**Things i dont like:**  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

**My bad points:**  
*Over thinking, i have been called intense before, and i have a tendency to take things to heart.*

**Fun fact:**  
I was once called for jury service, and i would love to do it again. 

*I make no apologies for being who i am, the older i get, i seem to care less about what people think or say these days. I'm more comfortable in my skin than ever before and i know what i like and what i dont like. I'm straight up honest and will say what's on my mind but at the same time, im empathic (sometimes it's a curse, and yes it's contradictory) and wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm prone to over thinking and sometimes worry about the little things in life, because the little things are actually really important.*

Lawson will release Coffee Whipped Bread, priced at 181 yen. It is filled with coffee whipped cream and topped with roasted almonds. The savory flavor of the coffee cream and the crunchy texture of the almonds make a great combination.

Looks tasty. I want to try it once.

Anyone else wake up feeling like a rusty tin man some days? 😩 I swear, some mornings I creak more than my front porch swing! Getting older is awesome, but let’s be real, the stiffness is a *thing*.

Lately, I've been trying something new, and honestly, it's made a HUGE difference. It's literally just a 5-minute morning routine. I know, sounds too good to be true, right? But trust me, even that little bit can get things moving (literally!).

So, what’s the secret sauce? No crazy contortions or sweat-inducing workouts here. Just some gentle movements to wake up those sleepy muscles:

*   **Neck Rolls:** Super simple. Just gently roll your neck from side to side and front to back. Feels amazing, especially if you sleep funny.
*   **Shoulder Circles:** Forward and backward. Helps loosen up those tight shoulder muscles. Imagine you're swimming!
*   **Torso Twists:** Standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, gently twist from side to side. Don't force anything – just go as far as feels comfortable.
*   **Leg Swings:** Hold onto a chair or wall for balance and swing each leg forward and backward. Think of it as gently waking up your hips.
*   **Ankle Rotations:** Rotate each ankle clockwise and counter-clockwise. Sounds minor, but it helps with balance and prevents those awkward stumbles!

Seriously, that’s it! Takes less time than brewing my morning coffee. 😉

The other day, I was chatting with my neighbor, Carol, about this (she’s a whiz with gardening), and she was saying how much harder gardening was getting because her back felt so tight. We talked about this little routine, and a week later she practically skipped over to my house to tell me how much it had helped! ""We believe in strongest people."" and you can start by getting your free guide on how to increase your body agility: [https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts](https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts)

I'm not saying this will cure all your aches and pains, but for me, it's been a game-changer. It's amazing how much difference just five minutes can make.

What are some things you do to combat morning stiffness? Is there a particular stretch or movement that really helps you? I'm always looking for new ideas! Maybe we can all learn something from each other. 🤔",1,1764681357.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

My recommendation: OPTION 2 (Sell + Minimal Move)

Action Plan:

    - Nextdoor

# 🏘️ LOCAL MOVING HELP RECOMMENDATIONS

For Loading/Unloading Help:

* 2 hours of work typically

1. Craigslist/Nextdoor ($25-40/hour)

* Local helpers
* Often cheaper
* Cash payment

1. College students ($20-30/hour)

* Check university job boards
* Strong and willing

For 3rd Floor Stairs:

* Budget 2-3 hours for 2 people

# 📊 STORAGE OPTIONS (If Needed)

If you decide to keep furniture temporarily:

Public Storage/Extra Space:

* 5'x10' unit: $100-150/month
* First month often discounted
* Climate control: +$30/month

Reality check:

* 3 months storage = $300-450
* Better to sell $500 furniture for $200 than pay $300 to store it!

# 🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATION

Best choice: Sell the sofa, dining table, and TV stand. Keep the 55"" TV, desk, chairs, and personal items. Rent a cargo van for $100, pack carefully, drive yourself, and buy replacement furniture in SoCal.

Total cost: \~$100-200 (after selling furniture)

This approach:

* ✓ Saves the most money
* ✓ Less stress (smaller load)
* ✓ Fresh start in new place
* ✓ IKEA furniture loses value anyway

Alternative if you want to keep everything: Labor + Truck for \~$2650 total.

I’ve been to many coffee shops around here in Davao, and I usually only drink their sweet drinks, specifically their matcha drinks (if not, cookies and cream). I like my matcha sweet and milky and unlike the other matcha lovers that love the authenticity of matcha (aka the bitter tastes). However, okay naman may bitterness as long as magdominate talaga ang sweetness. My budget for coffee shops are usually less than 200, however I’ve made exceptions. I’ve been to coffee shops such as Kaos Cafe, Steep Kohi, Habitat Coffee, and Headspace Coffee.

Since I can’t list all the coffee shops I’ve been to, here is the list na pupuntahan ko pa. Pwede paki-rate if worth my money ba dito based sa standard ng matcha that I mentioned above?

• Brew Lane Coffee
• Chi Lifestyle Lounge
• Kiks Coffee
• Ana & Anna
• Blank Space
• Thrive Bakery and Cafe

NOTE: Now, last time I checked, abot pa sa budget ko ang Blank Space and Kiks Coffee. However, as of recent, I checked again and beyond na siya sa budget ko for coffee shops. A&A abot beyond 200 naman but willing ako to taste it kasi laki naman ng serving and sarap tingnan.

The stupidity in question is all mine. Feel free to rake me over the coals for it. And for my apparent need to seek validation from subpar men. That can be its own treatise, but I digress.

The other day I posted about ending things with an AP (does it still count as an AP if they run for the hills after one sexy meetup?) Feeling sad and vulnerable, and following the advice of a fellow adulterer who said to call up the next batter, I responded to an ad \[Stupidity Counter:001\]

This guy was local; very local, so I overlooked something in his ad that should have made me block him right then and there. He referred to himself as a term that is extremely eye roll inducing and also screams that he says shit like ""I'm an alpha male"" unironically. \[Stupidity Counter: 002\]

I hit ""send"" on my response and within 30 seconds, he replied. Raised the ""hmmm"" sensors, but I continued. We exchanged the usual ""what brings you here"" chit chat and he suggests we head to Telegram. A little quick, but Reddit messaging is terrible, so I agree. \[Stupidity Counter:003\]

I then get hit with message after message after message. Even a couple of ""hello?""s if I didn't respond right away. I had to send a ""I'm not glued to my phone"". We're still only an hour or so in. \[Stupidity Counter:004\]

He wanted to do a selfie swap. Again, about an hour in. I agree because I can use the disappearing photo feature \[Stupidity Counter:005\]. He was attractive, I'll give him that. He then asks if I can meet up *that day* for coffee. He was very close, and I was free so I hesitantly agreed, again following the advice from a fellow adulterer who said they like to get meet ups done early on, instead of waiting. \[Stupidity Counter:006\]. He sends me the location, and we agree on a time about 4 hours from then. 

However, once that's done, he asked for a video of my body, and sent me one of him shirtless, flexing his pecs. Yes, that really happened. I declined, but I didn't block then and there, so \[Stupidity Counter:007\]

He continued to bombard with messages, each one getting more sexual and more inappropriate. I sent ""Just to be clear, I'm not fucking you today, or anytime soon, until I at least get to know you"" He said ""I know, I just like to talk"" and then asked if he can kiss me at the meet up. And yet, I still didn't block and delete. See previous comment re: needing validation. \[Stupidity Counter:008\]

About 15 minutes before I was set to leave, he sends ""Since we're both married and need to be discreet, do you just want to meet at one of our cars?""   My response ""Instead of in the coffee shop? No.""  Him: ""Okay. we'll meet in there, but there really isn't any seating, so we can then head to one of our cars.""  Me: ""Nah, let's just call it off. I'm not sitting in a car with a man I've never met and have literally been texting for three hours"" And that was when I finally came to my senses and blocked and deleted.  JFC.

So according to Amazon:

> “Your package was handed to a resident / left at your front door or veranda.”



According to reality:

My new “front door or veranda” is… my garbage can.
Not next to it. Not behind it. Not discreetly tucked somewhere safe.
Nope. Full ceremonial burial inside the bin, under a cozy layer of paper waste like it’s being prepared for recycling in the afterlife.

At this point my mailbox is basically unemployed while the wheelie bin has been promoted to “Prime Locker #TR4SH.”

Highlights of this innovative logistics solution:

Weather protection? 10/10, as long as collection day isn’t the same day as delivery.

Security? Perfect. No thief will ever think: “Let’s go treasure hunting in the bio-hazard stew of an overfilled bin.”

Customer experience? Nothing like digging through yesterday’s coffee grounds and junk mail to find that one cable I needed.


I guess I should update my address:

\- Age & Height: 28, 176 cm  
\- Age range I would want in a prospect: 23-33  
\- Location: Germany. I plan to stay here for a couple of years more.   
\- Ethnicity: Turkish   
\- Open to mixing  
\- Marital status: Single  
\- Ideal marriage timeline: When agreed, without being unnecessarily late  
\- Current job status: Working (not in a career job)  
\- Do I want kids? Yes.

**Important characteristics I look for in a prospect:**  
\- Natural inclination to learn and understand more about things. God, oneself, life, world, people etc.  
\- Desire to improve our own relationship with Allah continuously, keeping in mind that we're full of flaws and will always somehow make mistakes.  
\- Seeing marriage as a dynamic partnership that feeds on some effort from both sides, not as an accustomed situation breeding stagnancy.  
\- I'm very close with my parents and I value my relationship with my relatives as well as close friends highly. I want to maintain these relationships so a similar mindset or understanding in this regard would be great.  
\- Compassion & open-heartedness. I deeply dislike rudeness in general and specifically the instant panic/pushback/judgment/rejection/disdain/hostility I see from some people in face of a challenging or novel idea, question, person, situation etc.

**My level of religiosity:**  
I pray 5 times a day and more. I fast in Ramadan. I have one or two scholars I especially admire and everyday I try to read, watch or listen to their work. I'm trying to improve my deeds.

**My level of education and what I'm looking for:**  
I hold a master's degree in law. I care about compatibility in terms of intelligence rather than degrees.

**Things I do in my spare time:**  
\- I like taking a peaceful walk outside and cycling.  
\- I follow sports. Mainly football, tennis and basketball.  
\- I enjoy any kind of creative and informative work that affects me positively, whatever it may be.  
\- I love writing when I feel like writing.

\- I probably most enjoy having tea/coffee while sitting together and chatting with people I love.

**Something Interesting About Me:**  
\- My enneagram type is 4w5.  
\- I was told that I have ADHD by a medical professor, if that still means anything.  
\- I had 9 months to write my master's thesis. I wrote it in the last 2-3 weeks and submitted it on the deadline day. No proofreading, no supervision, no plagiarism check. It got published.

**Notes:**  
\- Since he represents a breaking point in Islamic thought, I'd like to mention that my religious views are closer to al-Ghazali and following big names who adopted his framework than they are to those who opposed him. May Allah be pleased with all believers.  
\- I feel like when faced with a dilemma I'd rather first look into Quran and Sunnah, research various scholars' opinions, take the necessities of our time and conditions into consideration before acting than simply copying what people have happened to be doing.

I think yesterday I had a sandwich and the bread had poppy seeds? It wasn’t large it was just a slice of bread and after that I got McDonald’s and coffee and then a monster energy drink. (It’s early in the morning now)

Idk I was unable to sleep and had weird mood changes and decided to take a test. 
And I had some weird almost pure joy? Euphoria? I was hyper. Totally. 
Eyelids idk I keep checking them I have huge anxiety issues and if I pinch my leg or slap it it doesn’t hurt like it should. My pupils are acting weird could be anxiety

I wasn’t able to sleep and thought the night there were weird smells some of which seemed burnt almost? (I’m not good at figuring out this, however it reminded me of incense alot ) 
So I freaked out and decided to use a drug test. 
I’ve also had a bunch of paranoia that I was finding needle marks near veins and like ??? 
I have weird mood swings along with weird crashes where I just feel meh 
Something triggered me to be hyper again and I blamed sugar consumption cause I’ve gone overboard with that(and maybe I just have whatever mental health predisposing me to that) but I don’t overindulge at all). 

I don’t think anything I ate over thanksgiving had a noticeable amount of poppy seeds, just occasionally making toast with bread that had it. Should I test again in like a few days and not eat any more of that bread? (The bread itself was a few inches long not a huge piece). But the day before I think I did eat multiple slices of that bread. 
So hopefully it’s just that? The smell lingered in the house for a while, wasn’t a hallucination since it went away after I closed my nose for a couple seconds ",0,1764679986.0,nursing,29,0.11,False
1pc7nd5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pc7nd5,I built a tool to simulate your financial future and track your progress to FIRE,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been into FIRE (Financial Independence) for a while, but I kept running into a wall.

I have apps that tell me I spent too much on coffee or subscriptions last month. That’s fine, but it doesn't help me answer the questions that actually keep me up at night.

I wanted to actually simulate my path to FIRE. I needed to visualize how my net worth would evolve over the next 10-20 years, factoring in market variance and my own life choices.

I couldn't find a tool that handled this well without demanding my bank passwords, so I built Asset Prism.

It’s a native iOS app that focuses on projection and simulation rather than just tracking expenses.

The main focus is building a realistic model of your future wealth.

To do that accurately, you can't just assume a straight line of savings until you're 40. Real life is messy. So I built a system where you can plug in ""Life Events"" to see how they reshape your curve.

For example:

- “How does buying a new car now impact my net worth in 2030?”
    
- “Can I afford a gap year without derailing my plan?”
    
- “What happens to my FIRE date if I switch to a lower-paying startup job?”
    

You add these variables, and the app runs the math locally (Monte Carlo simulations) to show you if you're still safe.

How it works:

1. Set a Goal: Define your FIRE number and target date.
    
2. Simulate: Add your assets and layer on future Life Events.
    
3. Check-in: Occasionally update your current balance to see if you are ""on track"" with the simulation.
    

No cloud, no accounts, no selling data. Just a tool to help you make decisions.

I’m polishing up the MVP for TestFlight right now.

I’m curious:  
When you think about your financial goals, do you plan for specific big purchases/events, or do you just try to save a flat % every month?

I'm in a relationship with a [43F] which I work with. She is constantly surrounded by guys that want something from her, in my opinion. There is an individual that she knows for 10 years, that now is single. I've seen him roaming around looking for her, I've seen them spending over 45 mins discussing things... Confiding in each other, having coffees in private with each other, daily texts and a few more other things... Everything give me a very unsettling feeling, basically whenever I'm not next to her is either this guy or another texting or chating to her. My problem is we can't make our relationship public due to the fact that we work together so I have to ""understand"" for her these conversations are nothing but she stills entertains them...

*Company believes that its operating capabilities and infrastructure are well suited to support a viable industry in Texas*

MARFA, Texas, Dec. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Village Farms International, Inc. (“Village Farms” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: VFF) today reaffirmed its commitment to the Texas cannabis industry after receiving notice that it was not awarded a conditional medical license as part of the Phase I license awards granted by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) on December 1, 2025. The Company is not yet aware how its application was scored by DPS, but plans to review the licensing process and scoring methodologies with advisors as more information becomes available. The Company’s application will be considered again during the Phase II round of conditional license awards in April of next year.

Michael A. DeGiglio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Village Farms commented, “We remain committed to supporting the Texas cannabis industry, as the outcome of Phase I awards has zero impact on our financial performance, outlook or strategy. We’ve proven that we don’t need first mover advantage to be successful, and will continue pursuing other opportunities to activate our Texas assets for cannabinoid production in the future. We believe our operational capabilities and infrastructure are well suited to support a viable industry in the State of Texas, and will continue working with policy makers and regulators to advocate for commonsense reform that enables safe access to affordable products.”

Village Farms owns 2.2 million square feet (50 acres) of greenhouse assets in West Texas, the same amount of operational cannabis acreage the Company expects to have in production at its Delta, BC greenhouses by the end of 2026. The Company also owns 950 acres of unoccupied farmland in Marfa, Texas, a site that was selected by Village Farms in the early 1990s as one of the most favorable growing climates for controlled environment agriculture (CEA) in the United States.

**About Village Farms International, Inc.**

Village Farms leverages decades of experience in Controlled Environment Agriculture as a large-scale, vertically-integrated supplier of high-value, high-growth plant-based Consumer Packaged Goods. The Company built a strong foundation as the leading and longest-tenured fresh produce supplier to grocery and large-format retailers throughout the US and Canada, and now focuses its agricultural expertise on high-growth cannabinoid opportunities while maintaining strategic optionality through remaining produce assets.

In Canada, the Company's wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, Pure Sunfarms, is one of the single largest cannabis operations in the world (2.2 million square feet of greenhouse production), a low-cost producer and one of Canada’s highest quality and best-selling brands. The Company owns an incremental 2.6 million square feet of greenhouse capacity in Canada for future expansion, and also owns 80% of Québec-based, Rose LifeScience, a leader in the commercialization of cannabis products.

Internationally, Village Farms is targeting selected, nascent, legal cannabis opportunities with significant growth potential. The Company exports medical cannabis from its EU GMP certified facility in Canada to international markets including Germany, the United Kingdom, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand. The Company is expanding its export business to new countries and customers, and making select investments in international production assets. In Europe, wholly-owned Leli Holland has one of 10 licenses to grow and distribute recreational cannabis within the Dutch Coffee Shop Experiment.

In the US, wholly-owned Balanced Health Botanicals is one of the leading CBD and hemp-derived brands and e-commerce platforms in the country. Subject to compliance with all applicable US federal and state laws and stock exchange rules, Village Farms plans to enter the US THC market via multiple strategies, leveraging its Texas-based greenhouse assets (2.2 million square feet of existing greenhouse capacity and 950 acres of owned, unoccupied land for future expansion).

The first was rather spontaneous as we’d just moved off hinge and swapped numbers. We grabbed drinks and the vibe and chat was great. Really seems like we’re both on the same page with what we’re looking for too. We ended up staying out pretty late together and there was lots of flirting which led to kissing. He said he was keen to see me again soon so we planned a daytime date a few days later.

Inbetween the dates we texted a lot but I got ill and almost had to cancel but I ended up going. The vibe was definitely different without alcohol and with me being under the weather but we got a coffee and went for a long walk, which was nice. It’s just very easy with him and he even brought up a third date. When we were saying goodbye, he said he wanted to kiss me but didn’t want to get sick, which was fair, so we hugged instead.

Both of us are busy so we have a full week to wait until our next date. There’s a good chance I’m overthinking this but the vibe seems to have changed over text. He’s way less chatty and his answers to my texts are shorter and less conversational. I’m definitely a big texter and I don’t mind if people aren’t, as long as there’s open communication in person, I tend to match their texting habits. But it’s the switch up between the amount of texting after the first date and now that’s making me confused.

I brought up plans for the third date after some time and he did suggest a time and location and said he’d book it. I think I’m getting in my head too much that he’s losing interest, but should I see what happens in person again? ",0,1764679234.0,dating_advice,3,0.5,False

These are my secrets and how you can do it too.,"I’m writing this from a coffee shop at 9am on a Tuesday. That sentence alone would’ve been impossible 67 days ago.

67 days ago I was waking up at 4pm in my parents’ house, unemployed, no friends, spending every waking hour gaming or scrolling, convinced I was going to be stuck like that forever.

Today I have a job. I have my own apartment. I wake up at 7am naturally. People who knew me two months ago genuinely don’t believe I’m the same person.

This isn’t motivation porn. This is what actually happened when I stopped trying to rely on willpower and started following a structured system for 60 days straight.

**Where I actually was**

25 years old. Dropped out of college 3 years ago. Hadn’t had a job in over a year. Sleep schedule was completely destroyed. Bed at 6am, wake up at 4pm. Spending 14+ hours a day either gaming, watching porn, or scrolling social media in bed.

Eating one meal a day, always junk food delivered to my door with my parents’ money. Hadn’t exercised in years. Room smelled bad. Hadn’t seen actual sunlight in months because I kept my curtains closed 24/7.

Zero friends because I’d ghosted everyone. Zero skills. Zero money. Zero future. Just existing in this loop of instant gratification and self hatred.

My parents had stopped talking to me about my life. They’d just leave food outside my door sometimes. I could see the disappointment in their eyes whenever we crossed paths.

**The breaking point**

My younger cousin graduated college and got a job offer at some tech company. He’s 22. I’m 25. In the three years since I dropped out, he finished his entire degree and started his career. And I had accomplished literally nothing.

My aunt asked me at a family dinner what I’d been up to. I had no answer. Just mumbled something about “figuring things out” while everyone awkwardly changed the subject.

Drove home that night and realized I’d wasted three entire years. And I was on track to waste the next three the exact same way. At some point I’d be 30, then 35, then 40, still living in my parents’ house with nothing to show for my life.

That night I couldn’t sleep. Just sat there thinking about how everyone I knew was moving forward and I was completely stuck. And I made a decision. Either I was going to actually change this time or I was going to accept that this was my life forever.

**What I did differently**

I’d tried to “turn my life around” probably a hundred times. It never worked because I’d always make the same mistakes. Get a burst of motivation, create some insane plan to wake up at 5am and work out twice a day and meditate and read and be perfect, burn out in 48 hours, feel even worse about myself.

This time I spent almost a week just researching how people actually successfully change. Read through scientific studies on habit formation, hundreds of Reddit posts from people who’d transformed their lives, books about behavior change.

The pattern I kept seeing was that everyone who actually succeeded did it gradually with structured progressive systems. Not through motivation. Not through willpower. Through systems that built momentum slowly over 60-90 days.

I needed a plan that would start where I actually was (waking up at 4pm, zero exercise, terrible diet) and gradually build up week by week. Small enough changes that my brain wouldn’t freak out and sabotage me.

**The 60 day structure**

I was scrolling through Reddit at 3am desperately looking for anything that could help when I found someone mention this app called Reload in a thread about breaking gaming addiction. It creates personalized plans based on your current level with three difficulty modes.

I picked easy because I was starting from absolute rock bottom. Week one looked like this:

Wake up at 11am (not 6am, just 11am instead of 4pm)
Work out for 15 minutes twice a week
Read 5 pages twice a week  
Drink 2 liters of water daily
Limit screen time to 6 hours a day
Journal twice a week

It felt almost too easy. But that was the point. I needed wins. Needed to prove to myself I could follow through on something.

The app gave me daily tasks based on which week I was on and blocked all my time wasting apps during productive hours. This was huge because it removed my ability to escape. When TikTok and YouTube literally won’t open, you can’t procrastinate.

**The actual timeline**

Week 1-2: Everything sucked. My body was so used to the 6am bedtime that waking at 11am felt impossible. The 15 minute workouts almost killed me. My brain kept screaming at me to quit. But I didn’t. First time in years I’d actually followed through on something.

Week 3-4: Tasks increased slightly. Wake at 10:30am, work out 3 times for 25 minutes, read 5 pages 3 times a week. My body was adapting. Sleep schedule starting to normalize. Still hard but manageable.

Week 5-6: Wake at 10am, work out 4 times for 40 minutes, read 10 pages 4 times a week. This was the turning point. Routines becoming automatic. Wasn’t fighting myself as much. Could see actual physical changes. Had more energy.

Week 7-8: Wake at 9am, work out 5 times for 60 minutes, read daily. Things that seemed impossible two months ago were just normal now. Working out was enjoyable. Reading was relaxing. My brain had rewired.

Week 9: Wake at 8am, work out 6 times for 90 minutes, read 20 pages daily. Looked in the mirror and didn’t recognize myself. Had visible muscle. Clear skin. Actual light in my eyes.

**What actually changed**

I wake up at 7:30am now without an alarm. My body just naturally wakes up at that time because my sleep schedule is fixed.

I work out 6 days a week and genuinely look forward to it. Lost 23 pounds of fat, gained visible muscle. Look completely different physically.

I’ve read 12 books in the past two months. More than I read in the previous 5 years combined.

I got a job at a logistics company. Not my dream job but it pays well and gets me out of the house.

I moved into my own apartment last week. First time living alone. Still can’t believe it’s real.

I’ve made 2 new friends through the gym. We grab food after workouts sometimes. Feels good to have actual social connections again.

My relationship with my parents is completely different. We eat dinner together when I visit. They don’t look worried about me anymore. My dad told me he’s proud of me last week. Almost cried.

**The honest reality**

I need to be real because I don’t want this to sound like some perfect transformation story.

I relapsed multiple times. Had days where I slept until 2pm. Days where I skipped workouts for three days straight. Days where I gamed for 10 hours and felt like I’d destroyed everything.

Week 4 I had a complete breakdown and almost quit. Felt like nothing was changing and I was just forcing myself through pointless routines.

Week 6 I watched porn after going a month without it and spiraled into self hatred for two days.

Week 8 I ordered fast food three times in one day and felt disgusted with myself.

But here’s the difference. I didn’t let one bad day destroy everything. Old me would’ve used one relapse as proof I was hopeless and quit entirely. New me just acknowledged it sucked and got back on track the next morning.

The structure kept me from completely falling apart. Even on my worst days, the system was still there. The habits I’d built didn’t disappear from one relapse.

**Why this actually worked**

External structure instead of willpower. The app told me exactly what to do each day and blocked distractions. Didn’t have to rely on motivation because the system forced me forward.

Progressive difficulty. Changes were gradual enough that I never felt overwhelmed. Going from 4pm wake time to 11am is manageable. Going from 4pm to 6am would’ve failed immediately.

Accountability through competition. The app has a leaderboard where you compete against other people. Weirdly motivating for my gamer brain. Turned self improvement into something I could track and compete at.

No negotiation. When apps are blocked and tasks are due, you can’t talk yourself out of doing them. Removed my ability to make excuses.

Measurable progress. Could see exactly how I was improving week by week. Kept me going on days I wanted to quit.

**Day 0 vs Day 67**

Day 0: Woke at 4pm, gamed 14 hours, ate McDonald’s in bed, no exercise, unemployed, lived with parents, hated myself

Day 67: Woke at 7:30am, worked out 90 minutes, cooked healthy breakfast, worked 8 hours, live in my own apartment, proud of myself

Completely different person in the same body.

**If you want to actually do this**

You need 60 days of commitment. Not perfection. You’ll have bad days. Just get back on track the next morning.

You need structure that starts at your actual level. If you’re waking at 4pm, week one is waking at 11am, not 6am.

You need to remove escape routes. Block apps. Delete games. Make bad habits require effort.

You need external accountability. Something outside your head enforcing rules because you can’t trust yourself yet.

You need to track progress so you can see you’re moving forward even when it doesn’t feel like it.

Accept that weeks 1-3 will suck. Weeks 4-6 are hard but manageable. Week 7+ it starts feeling natural.

60 days is 8 weeks. Two months. You could be unrecognizable by spring. Or you could still be exactly where you are now, just older.

I wasted 3 years before I figured this out. Don’t waste another day.

67 days ago I was a complete failure with no future. Today I have a job, my own apartment, actual friends, and a life I’m proud of.

If I can do it from where I was, anyone can.

What’s actually stopping you from starting today?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",6,1764679060.0,getdisciplined,1,0.88,False

1pc7bga,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1pc7bga/the_same_right_place/,The same right place,"We lived under the red star, and the star never blinked.

My name doesn’t matter. In the village they still call me by my father’s name, and that is enough.

I was nine the year the older boy hit me with the pipe.

Third grade, morning shift. Classes ended at 13:30 because the factory needed the mothers and fathers for the second rotation. Four kilometres of cracked asphalt and dust between the school and the block of flats. No buses; petrol belonged to the State. Children walked alone. That was the rule.
He stepped out from the poplars that lined the irrigation canal. Fourteen, maybe fifteen. Eighth-grade uniform, red Pioneer scarf knotted like a noose. He didn’t speak. Just raised the iron pipe—cut-off scaffolding, the kind we stole from collective farms to fix our balconies—and brought it down on the exact same place a guard in Siberia had once broken my grandfather’s skull.

I remember the sun flashing on the metal. Then the world went red. I stayed behind, watching him walk away without a care. Blood mixed with my tears, hands pressed to my head while I asked the empty air, 

“Why? Why did you hit me? What did I ever do to you?” The feeling of impotence was overwhelming. He was too big, too strong. I cried because I could do nothing else.

I made it home by walking in the ditch so nobody saw the blood. Told my mother I’d fallen off the parallel bars. She looked at me once, saw the lie, and beat me anyway for ruining the shirt. The Party gave us one new shirt every two years, so I had really done it this time.

I never told anyone who did it. Informing was for dogs.
Six years later I was fifteen. The country still wore grey, but the grey had begun to rot at the edges.
The older boys were doing their two years of “patriotic service.” They came home on Sunday passes drunk with power and plum brandy, uniforms too big for the men they hadn’t become. I was buying cigarettes behind the bus station with coins I’d stolen from the factory collection box when I heard his voice—older, thicker, but the same laugh.

He was telling his friend they would meet two girls at the old path above the hidden beach. The path the border guards had stopped patrolling after the minefield was laid farther north. Thirty metres straight down to rocks and black water. I knew every stone. That was the place I grew up—where we hid to smoke, where we made campfires when the militia was someone we knew or just a lazy communist.

Hearing that voice reopened a wound that had never truly closed. That night the rage came back, colder than the day it happened. I remembered my mother’s beatings, and the scar on my scalp still ached. I went down to the basement, took the same kind of pipe (still there, still rusted, heavy and cold), and walked to the cliffs. I hid just metres from the path, crouched in the bushes. Outside it was already dark, and a warm spring wind pushed the salty breath of the Black Sea into my face.

The girls arrived first, scarves pulled low, whispering about university exams they would never be allowed to take. They passed two metres from me and smelled of cheap lilac water.

A few minutes later the boys came along the same path.

I stood up behind them.

The first swing found the exact same place where he had scarred me. He dropped like a sack of maize. His friend screamed once—a thin, useless sound swallowed by the sea—and ran.

I hit until the pipe was soft with hair and the rocks underneath were wet. A strange feeling of freedom and relief surged through me. Blood boiled in my veins. I was not scared. I felt no remorse.

Then I ran.

It was 22:30 when I reached the block. Blood had dried into a second skin, but I hadn’t realised I was covered in it.

My mother opened the door, saw me, and dragged me into the kitchen by the hair. When she realised the blood was not mine, she went quiet—the way people go quiet before a storm. 
Then she started hitting. Not slaps; closed fists, the way her own father had taught her after crawling back from Siberia missing four toes and all mercy. She used the wooden spoon the Pioneer committee had awarded her for “exemplary ideological education of the child.” She slammed my head against the walls. I felt warm blood running down my back. 
I didn’t defend myself—she gave me this treatment every week. 
I only hoped one day she would hit hard enough that I never got up again. 
Pain had lost all meaning. Life had never had any value for me until that night.

My father came in barefoot, eyes still red from the night shift. He tried to pull her off. She bit his wrist. He struck her once—the way men hit under communism when words are no longer enough. She fell between the table and the stove and stayed there.

The kitchen smelled of blood, coffee, and fear.

My father washed my face in the sink, water running pink into the drain.

“What did you do? Why did she do this? Tell me.”
Fear I had never seen before was painted across his face.

I told him everything. 
The pipe when I was nine. 
The laugh behind the bus station. The sound the skull made when it finally gave.

He listened without blinking. Then he sat for five, maybe ten minutes, staring at the blank wall.

“Tell me exactly where this happened. Tell me everything again.”

I told him again. 
“Behind the last train station on line 201. Just fifty metres farther.”

“And the pipe?”

“I threw it in the garbage container at the station.”

He stood, carried my mother to the bedroom, closed the door, and came back.

“Shower. Put all the clothes in a bag. And go to sleep.”

I stood under the water until my skin wrinkled. I thought about the window—fourth floor, quick. Thought about the belt—quiet. Thought about swimming out until the cold took me and the militia wrote “accidental drowning,” the way they did for everyone who disappeared. 

I decided the sea would be cleaner.

I never slept.

At 05:47 the front door opened again.
My father came in alone. His boots left half-moon prints of wet sand and black earth across the linoleum. He smelled of salt, pine disinfectant, and something sweeter—the chemical they used in the morgue when bodies waited too long. He went to the bedroom first. Stayed a few minutes. I could hear him speaking low to my mother. He came out with his eyes empty.

He started the coffee.
I walked in.

“No school today.”

I nodded.

“This is the biggest mistake you will ever make in your life.”

“I’m sorry, father.”

“Too late.” 
He lit a Carpați with fingers that wouldn’t stop shaking.
 “His parents will never see him again. The army will write ‘desertion.’ Nobody will ever know what happened to him. You will never speak of this—not to your wife, not to your children, not in the confession booth, not on your deathbed. Never.”

He drank the coffee standing up, put on his factory jacket, and left for the morning shift.

Just another Tuesday under the red star.

Mother woke around noon.

She came into the kitchen without a word, face swollen on one side, the print of Father’s hand still purple across her cheek. 

She lit the stove, put water for coffee, and sat opposite me—the same chair where she had beaten me hours earlier.

I waited for the screaming to start again.
It never came.

Instead she stared at the cracked table and spoke so quietly I had to lean in.

“Your grandfather crossed a river once,” she said. 

“January. Forty-nine below. The guards shot the dogs first so the barking wouldn’t carry. He walked on the bodies of men who had fallen before him. Ice broke. Water took his boots, then his toes, one by one. When he reached the other side he had no feeling left below the knees, but he kept walking because the Russians were still behind.”

She stirred the coffee and let her gaze drift toward the Black Sea through the thin window.

“He came home in 1954. Skinny, grey, eyes like holes. The first night he slept in his own bed he woke screaming that the guards were dragging him back. My mother tried to calm him. He beat her unconscious with the same fists that had carried him across the ice. Said if she was soft the Russians would smell it on her and come for all of us.”

She looked at me then. Really looked.

“I was seven. He made me stand in the yard in February with no coat until I stopped crying. Said tears freeze and give your position away. When I came inside he beat me with the belt for shivering too loud. Every time I flinched he said, ‘Good. Remember this feeling. It will keep you alive.’”

The coffee boiled over. She didn’t move.

“That is what they taught him in the camp. Pain is a language. If you speak it first, nobody can use it on you.”

She tapped the spoon against the cup. Tap. Tap. Tap. Like bones.

“I thought I was teaching you to survive,” she whispered. “I thought if I made you hard enough, the world would leave you alone.”

Her voice cracked on the last word. Not tears—she had none left. Just the sound of something inside her finally breaking after forty years.

“I was wrong,” she said. “The world doesn’t leave you alone. It just waits until you’re the one holding the pipe.”

She stood, walked to the window, and stared out at the grey blocks, the laundry lines, and the red star still painted on the water tower even though nobody believed in it anymore.

“Go to your room,” she said without turning. “Your father will say what needs to be said when he comes home tonight.”

I went.

That was the only time she ever told me about her father.

The only time she ever came close to an apology.

Later, when the regime fell and people burned portraits in the streets, I understood: the guards never left Siberia. They just came home inside the people who survived them.

And some of us learned the language so well we started speaking it to our own children.

Forty-three years passed.
The regime died choking on its own flags. I married, had children, watched them grow up in a country that pretended it had never been afraid.

My father died first. Heart attack on the exact spot of the hidden beach where he once buried a boy. They found him face-down in the sand, one hand clutching a brown hat he had kept since 1956.

At the wake my mother pulled me into the same kitchen. She was eighty-three, thin as a winter branch.

“He wasn’t dead when your father got there,” she whispered. 
“Barely breathing, but the eyes were still moving. Your father pressed one heavy hand over the boy’s mouth and nose until the eyes stopped moving. Carried him farther down the cliff and covered him with rocks, sand, and quicklime from the collective. He went back three nights to make sure the dogs didn’t dig.”

She lit one of his old cigarettes with a match that trembled the way his hands had trembled every morning for forty-three years.

“He saw that boy’s face every single night until the day he died. Every night. Even after the wall came down. Even after they gave us passports and blue jeans and Coca-Cola. That face never left him.”

She inhaled until the coal burned her fingers.
Then she stubbed it out on the same table where she had once beaten me for bleeding.

Three days after the funeral my mother placed a small wooden box on the kitchen table.

Same table. Same cracks. Same ghosts.

“Open it,” she said. “He wanted you to have this when I was gone too.”

I lifted the lid.

On top lay a yellowed newspaper from 1962. Front page. A grainy photograph of a young man in uniform, headphones around his neck, fingers flying over a Morse key. The headline screamed in red ink:
BEST TELEGRAPHIST OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC – AN EXAMPLE FOR THE YOUTH!

His name underneath. My father at nineteen.
The same eyes that could freeze a room without a word.

Under the paper: an Orex automatic watch stopped forever at 03:17. 
A stack of black-and-white photos. 
Father as a boy near the Russian border, barefoot in the snow, holding a dead hare twice his size. 

Father in Moscow, 1964, standing stiff beside Red Square, medals he never wore again. 

Father drunk at a wedding, smiling in a way I had never seen in life.

And at the bottom, folded small so it wouldn’t tear, the medical report from 1955.

I knew the story, but never the paper.

He was fifteen. Working the collective fields up north, near the Soviet border where winters eat men. A tractor turned too sharp. The driver didn’t see the boy behind. The blade caught him across the head and peeled the scalp clean off like the skin of an orange.

They carried what was left of him home on a door. The doctor told the family:
 “Prepare the hole.”

They dug it that same evening. Carved a wooden cross. Wrote his name, the dates 1940–1955.

Three nights later he opened his eyes.

He never spoke about the dark he saw. Only once, drunk on plum brandy when I was twelve, he told me the cold had felt like home. 

After that he drank every day, but never raised a hand. 

The anger lived in his eyes instead—grey, flat, impossible to meet for more than a split second. People crossed the street when he walked. Even the militia looked away.

He spoke Russian and French like a native, could solve equations in his head faster than the engineers at the factory, but he chose the dirtiest job on the line. Twelve-hour shifts, oil up to the elbows, far from any Party office that might remember the newspaper photograph.

He wanted to disappear.

The regime had made him a hero once. He spent the rest of his life running from the medal.

I turned the watch over. On the back, scratched with a nail decades ago:

Я ВИДЕЛ (Ya videl)
I saw.

Mother watched me read it.

“He learned Russian in Moscow,” she said. “Six months attached to a signals unit. They taught him the language and how to hate it. When he came home he never spoke it again—except when he was drunk and crying in his sleep. Then it was always the same two words.”

She took the newspaper, smoothed it with her palm as if she could still flatten the past.

“He never hit you,” she said. 

“Never. Even when you deserved it. Even after that night on the cliff. He carried enough for both of you.”

I closed the box.

That evening I walked to the cemetery. The grave was fresh, the earth still black. I opened the Orex, wound it once, twice. The second hand jerked, then moved.
03:17 became 03:18.

Somewhere under the soil he was still counting.

I left the watch on the mound.
Let time keep walking for him now.

When I got home the wind had come in from the sea, carrying the smell of salt, pine, and something metallic underneath.

I stood on the balcony and listened.
For the first time in forty-three years I heard two sounds at once:
the pipe finding the exact same place,
and a telegraph key tapping out a message no one would ever answer.

I go to the cliffs sometimes. The path is overgrown now. Tourists come for the view and never know that a young man lies dead beneath their feet.

I still wonder why he did it. What demons made him grab that pipe and break my head? 

I know my demons sleep now, but they visit me in my dreams.

Are his parents still alive? Does anyone else still think of him?

Or am I the only one left carrying him?

When the wind is right I still hear it: the sound a pipe makes when it finds the exact same place twice.

Under communism we learned that some debts cannot be paid.
They can only be passed on.

And the red star is gone.
But the night remembers everything.

1pc76ao,https://i.redd.it/j9f94m10bs4g1.png,Review of HiBREW Automatic Burr Mill Electric Coffee Grinder with 31 Gears for Espresso American Coffee Pour Over Visual Bean Storage G3,"[](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c45Zu6dn)

[**View The official Product Page**](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c45Zu6dn)

The eye-catching 64 % discount on a $220 coffee grinder immediately raises the question: what exactly is being sacrificed to hit a $79 price point? The listing shows 7,246 orders, so the product is clearly moving, but the math is brutal: either the original price was fantasy, or the build quality has been quietly downgraded.

The description promises ""31 grind settings"" and ""automatic"" operation, yet the photos reveal a plastic body and a suspiciously small grounds bin, suggesting the motor and burr set may be the first place the manufacturer economized. At this price point, the most likely scenario is that the burrs are a cheap ceramic knock-off rather than the hardened steel or titanium-coated burrs that justify a $200+ price tag.

The 7,246 orders do suggest that buyers are either unaware of the compromise or are simply attracted by the discount. The question for them is whether the grinder will hold up long enough to be a good value, or if the savings are going to be eaten up by the need to replace it in a year or two.

In short, the listing is a good reminder that if a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is. The discount is coming from somewhere, and it's probably not the seller's profit margin. The question is whether the buyer is getting a bargain or a headache.

The brewery was closed for the night, lights dimmed, the aroma of brewing hops still floating through the halls. Inside CJ’s apartment — tucked behind the brewery’s back corridor — the Champion and his team sat around two laptops and a large monitor.

CJ leaned over Caleigh’s shoulder.
Matt paced behind them like a restless Houndoom.
Charmeleon sat on the couch, tail flame glowing.
Pichu sparked every few seconds.

Caleigh clicked into another document.

Caleigh:
“Look at this—Cyclones changed ownership the same year Team Rocket took over Coney Island.”

CJ’s eyes narrowed.

CJ:
“Before that, nothing was abandoned. The rides were open. The boardwalk was alive. The breweries, bars, arcades—everything was running.”

Matt stopped pacing.

Matt:
“And right after the NEW Cyclones owners took control…
they shut everything down.
Convenient timing, huh?”

CJ felt the pieces clicking together.

CJ:
“So Maria Jones takes over… Rocket arrives… the island collapses.”

Caleigh nodded slowly.

Caleigh:
“She didn’t just buy land—she bought silence, tourism, ownership rights, zoning contracts… all right before Rocket started pushing people out.”

Matt clenched his fists.

Matt:
“When I was with Rocket, I saw her.
Maria Jones was in Giovanni’s private meetings.
She wasn’t wearing Rocket gear…
but she WAS giving orders.”

CJ stepped back from the screen.

CJ:
“Then she’s not just a businesswoman—she might be funding the whole operation.”

Caleigh pulled up another file.

Caleigh:
“And whatever proof Rocket has?
We need it.”

Matt nodded.

Matt:
“They store their financials and donor files in a secure vault at the Manhattan base.
If we get those files, everything becomes exposed.”

CJ checked the wall clock.

CJ:
“6 PM.”

He tightened his gloves.

CJ:
“Rest until 9.
Gear up at 9:30.
Infiltration starts at 10.”

Matt cracked a grin.

Matt:
“I never thought I’d break into Rocket wearing their uniform… for the good guys.”

⸻

🕛 Scene 2 — Gear On, Ready to Move

By 9:30 PM, CJ’s apartment looked like a field base.
	•	Tactical belts on
	•	Rocket grunt uniforms fully zipped
	•	Fake IDs clipped
	•	Hats tilted low
	•	Supplies packed
	•	Charmeleon’s flame dimmed for stealth
	•	Pichu riding in a sling pack
	•	Mew hovering silently, ready to teleport

Caleigh secured her gloves.

Caleigh:
“Feels weird wearing this.”

CJ looked in the mirror — Rocket hat, black vest, fake badge.

CJ:
“Yeah. But it gets us in.”

Matt adjusted his own uniform, the only one who looked completely natural in Rocket gear.

Matt:
“Alright. Mew, Starbucks — one block from the Manhattan base.”

Mew chirped softly, glowing sky-blue.

CJ took Caleigh’s hand.

Matt touched Mew’s paw.

And—

FLASH.

⸻

☕ Scene 3 — Behind a Manhattan Starbucks

They appeared behind a dumpster, the stench of stale coffee and bakery trash hitting them immediately.

Caleigh gagged.

Caleigh:
“Oh my—this is worse than a Gulpin’s breath.”

Matt smirked.

Matt:
“Welcome to Midtown.”

CJ peeked around the corner.

Across the street:
A steel, windowless fortress with armed guards pacing outside.

CJ:
“That’s the base?”

Matt:
“Level 4 Manhattan Operations.
Home of Rocket’s financial servers.”

They were about to move toward the alley when—

A sharp voice cut the air.

???:
“You’ve GOT to be kidding me.”

They turned.

Leaning against the wall, arms crossed, wearing an annoyed smirk—

Trish.

Matt:
“…Of course.”

Trish walked forward, heels clacking against the concrete.

Trish:
“You idiots actually came back here.
In Rocket uniforms.”
(she snorted)
“Matt, you grow a conscience and suddenly think you’re unstoppable?”

Matt stepped forward.

Matt:
“Move, Trish.”

She grinned.

Trish:
“You know the rules.
If you want through MY territory—
you battle me.”

CJ rubbed his forehead.

CJ:
“Seriously?”

Caleigh whispered:

Caleigh:
“She’s REALLY doing this?”

Matt cracked his neck.

Matt:
“Fine.
Two on two.”

⸻

⚔️ Scene 4 — Matt vs. Trish: Midnight Alley Battle

Trish threw her Poké Balls high.

Trish:
“Houndoom!
Roserade!
Light up the alley!”

Black flames burst.
Petals sliced through the air.

Matt tossed his Poké Balls lazily.

Matt:
“Slaking.
Swampert.
Handle it.”

🔥 Houndoom vs Swampert

Houndoom shot a roaring Flamethrower.

Swampert sprinted THROUGH the flames—
grabbed Houndoom by the jaw—
and slammed him into the concrete.

KO.

🌿 Roserade vs Slaking

Roserade danced forward, firing Razor Leafs.

Slaking didn’t flinch.

Then—

BOOM!
One Hammer Arm sent Roserade flying into a pile of cardboard boxes.

KO.

Trish stared, jaw dropped.

Trish:
“…I hate you.”

Matt grinned.

Matt:
“You always did.”

Trish crossed her arms and sighed.

Trish:
“I never saw you.
You were never here.
I’m going home.”

And she vanished into the shadows.

Caleigh blinked.

Caleigh:
“…Did she just… help us?”

Matt:
“No.
That’s her way of pretending she’s not helping.”

CJ adjusted his Rocket hat.

CJ:
“Alright.
Let’s get inside.”

⸻

🏢 Scene 5 — Entering the Rocket Base

They crossed the street calmly, blending in with a group of real Rocket grunts heading in for a shift.

Matt swiped his old keycard.

BEEP — ACCESS GRANTED.

Door one opened.

A second door scanned their badges.

BEEP — ACCESS GRANTED.

Door two opened.

Now they were inside:

Long metallic hallways.
Ceiling cameras rotating.
Rocket banners hanging like flags of a dictatorship.

Matt whispered:

Matt:
“Stay close.
This place is a maze.
Vault’s down three levels and behind two security checkpoints.”

Caleigh tightened her bag strap.

Caleigh:
“Then let’s move before someone checks the cameras.”

CJ nodded.

CJ:
“Let’s find the data that takes Maria Jones down.”

They stepped deeper into the base.

Lights flickered.
Footsteps echoed.
The doors sealed shut behind them.

And the real mission began.

1pc716j,https://www.reddit.com/r/EckhartTolleTV/comments/1pc716j/eckhart_tolle_answers_question_about_depression/,Eckhart Tolle answers question about depression and antidepressants (Prozac),"And this way, the pain body becomes fuel for consciousness. This is why many of the wisest, most enlightened men and women on our planet once had a heavy pain body, you say. So what I wanted to ask is that so many people today medicate themselves.

Any uncomfortable feelings that you have, you go to a psychiatrist or counselor, remember, the first thing they do is prescribe medication (antidepressant) for you. Does medication (antidepressant, tranquilizers, etc ) get in the way of using the pain body as fuel for enlightenment? [Speaker 1 : Eckhart Tolle ] (7:35:53 - 7:37:08)

To a large extent, it does. There may be certain extreme cases when medication , antidepressants, tranquilizers, etc -- is necessary. And for people who already are on antidepressants medication, it's certainly not advisable to go off medication without the advice of a doctor.

So if you feel that it's time for you to get off, talk to a doctor who is relatively conscious and can help you gradually to get off the medication. So it's really a question of not giving in to this culturally conditioned behavior that says whenever you feel some discomfort inside yourself, emotional disturbance, immediately to seek some external help in the form of a substance that you ask your doctor to give you. Rather, learn to be with inner discomfort that arises, learn to be with emotional pain that arises rather than wanting to eliminate it.

Learn to accept it. Acceptance is one of the main focal points of this teaching. Learn to accept whatever emotion arises in you rather than run away from it or wanting to eliminate it.

[Speaker 2] (7:37:08 - 7:37:26)

But why? This is the thing, Eckhart. Why would I want to accept it?

That's why people are medicating themselves. That's why people eat, they gamble, they overwork themselves, they live in denial, they become unconscious because they don't want to deal with the pain. That's what we're all trying to get away from, is the pain.

[Speaker 1 : Eckhart Tolle ] (7:37:26 - 7:38:40)

Yes, yes. Now, if you medicate it with antidepressant, it doesn't actually go away. It dulls the pain so that you're not conscious of it anymore.

It's still there in the background. It's the same thing for many illnesses. For example, I had a heavy cold a couple of weeks ago.

Yes. I didn't take anything, but some people take things so that the symptoms are suppressed of the cold. It doesn't suppress the cold.

The cold is still there. So why accept it? It's because it is here at this moment.

So it's part of bringing this inner yes to whatever arises in the present moment. It is part of becoming friendly with the present moment, even if on the surface, the present moment doesn't look that great. So we are bringing, and this is where the awareness begins to come into the emotion.

If we bring acceptance to whatever we feel at this moment, rather than not wanting to feel it, the equivalent of that would be an external situation that arises, and then I resist it because I don't want this situation to be as it is, but it already is.

Questioner to Eckhart Tolle:

I take half of the smallest dose of Fluoxetine (Prozac) , an antidepressant medication. I have done without because I have a belief it will keep me from awakening. However, I have greater clarity and seem to hold presence more consistently when I continue with this small amount.

Eckhart Tolle answers:

A related question asks, do you think the huge increased consumption of antidepressants in recent years points to the ego's effort to suppress emerging consciousness? Of course, antidepressants drugs are there because the emotional pain gets too much, the pain of living, somehow an escape from the pain, dull the pain in some way. And eventually you have to face the pain and then realize that it's not as big as it seemed.

You've been running away from a monster. And if you really look at the monster, it's not such a big monster anymore. Facing it through presence, allowing that pain, whatever you want to call it, existential pain, the fear associated with it, the heaviness, allowing it to be there.

It may come in waves and then you watch the arising and subsiding of a wave of pain in whatever form. Antidepressants make it harder to be present. If you're on this very small dose, a time will come when you won't need that anymore and it may be very soon.

Some, it is often the pain body that manifests, as I described, the energy field of pain body, some energy field, some pain bodies have the energy field of heaviness, great heaviness to them. And they arise periodically. I had that.

My (Eckhart Tolle) pain body was predominantly heavy, a weight I couldn't live with, a dull pain, continuous in the background. I (Eckhart Tolle) might still be on antidepressants if I had taken antidepressants at the time. Somehow I must have allowed the pain to be there without knowing anything about allowing.

With presence growing and accelerating in you, face the pain that arises with that intense presence. And acceptance. And any state that arises, accept and watch it so that it doesn't turn into a self, an unhappy self.

If you accept and watch, any state arises is just that state now. That field, that energy field, that particular manifestation, that particular content arises. No self in it anymore.

The perpetuation of inner states is through them becoming a self, a me. Then they go on and on. You feed them.

You feed them. And you take time away, just what is now. So that whatever the emotional state is, the feeling state doesn't use your mind because if it uses your mind, you're back in time and you will be in past and future, which are both heavy.

And immediately the me arises out of that. So for that, you need the intensity of presence. Take a picture of an Isagadatta and look at that to get the quality of intensity.

Or the picture of a Zen, a painting of a Zen master, but better a photo of a master. And then see the uncompromising quality of presence. But it allows.

Uncompromising doesn't mean it doesn't allow. Uncompromisingly, it allows. It's uncompromising and allowing.

And anything that's faced will undergo change. We know that from dreams. We've all had dreams, running away from some monster or you're being pursued by some presence, some monster.

And when you finally face it in a dream, it's not that horrible. And often this is the myth. It becomes transformed actually into a benign figure, an ancient myth.

The famous, the dragon turns into something else or the frog turns into something, a prince. But you have to kiss the frog. Look.

Of course, you have to reduce very slowly if you are on entity presence, then careful and very alert and very carefully do it. Check within yourself, see if there's any waiting for the next question or this or that. Or whether there's such intensity of aliveness throughout your entire being that this moment is good enough as it is and more than good enough.

Is there a flight into thought as you sit there, which means into time, which means away from this, away from now, away from the aliveness, the intensity of this moment and the peace of this moment. What is the role of vision in creating a new world? Does vision arise out of presence?

Vision meaning you see something before it has manifested externally. The good thing is that you don't have to create a new world. It creates itself through presence. So you don't have to do it. There is no, in that sense, it's truer to say there is no free will. You are no more than an opening and the totality, the one consciousness expresses itself through you.

Is that the relief? You don't have to create a new world, but it'll create itself perhaps through you. And through presence, you may suddenly see what's needed.

Insight and realization comes, it's not egoic. There's no struggling and no effort in it. You will always know when there's effort, then there's no alignment with presence.

There's some ego involvement there. I need to get somewhere. I need to create a better world.

And so there'll be struggle. Effort means needing to get to the future. That's effort.

It doesn't mean that there may not be intense energy behind what you do, but it's not the energy of effort. Effort means you're being pulled towards future. But when something, when action arises out of presence, there may be great intensity and passion, you could say, but not the passion that needs you to reach the future.

The doing itself, it's the doing that arises is sufficient unto itself and there's joy, aliveness, and passion in the doing. It doesn't need the goal. Of course, in time, there's time in the phenomenal world, the doing will result in certain forms arising, new forms arise externally.

You don't need any of those for your salvation. You're not looking to the future for salvation. That means there's no effort anymore, but perhaps great intensity and great passion and great aliveness.

That's how the new world creates itself. So you may pursue a goal, but the arriving is not all that important. Not a goal that is going to free you, not a goal that is going to enhance your sense of self or your sense of importance.

Not in that sense. A good sign is when anything that arises out of presence, it means this moment is not a means to an end. The doing is fulfilled and fulfilling in itself, every moment.

You're no longer reducing the now to a means to an end, which is the old consciousness. And then very often you create, because you have a vision of heaven, and in pursuing your vision of heaven, you're creating hell. That's often happened.

There have been many visions of heaven and utopia. And in pursuing that, we need to get there, there. This is the ideal image.

Once we get there, we'll be fine. We'll be free. We will be whatever we will be. In the meantime, we need to adopt certain means towards getting there. Okay. We need to eliminate all those who don't believe in this goal to start with.

The madness continues. And this works on the smallest levels to observe any kind of doing in your life, movement from here to there, walking from here to there. Is it a means to an end, or is there a sense of completeness in the doing?

And you will notice the qualitative difference is tremendous between any action that's a means to a future end and an action that is not a means, but there's a sense of completeness to it. And yet there may be great energy there. We talked about eating.

Why many people lose consciousness when they eat is it's a means to an end. I need to get this food in through the body. There's no quality, no presence.

Even making a cup of tea or a cup of coffee, is that a means to an end? The tiniest things using them to see if you can be present with what is. It's never, the illusion in the old consciousness is the next moment is more important than this one.

Always, always the next moment is more important than this one. It does not mean that you have to slow down a lot, presence arising. We talked about that film I saw where those beings, everything they do is very slow.

And sometimes when presence arises, at first people try to do everything very carefully. And then there's a little bit of self-consciousness still there. Okay, I'm trying to be present.

And then you see, that's not quite it either. They're simple, reaching for glass. The glass is traveling to your mouth.

It looks like just a normal, just a normal action. And yet it's not a means to an end. And then a sense of presence pervades the entire energy field around you.

So any action that becomes a vehicle for presence, it's a vehicle for presence. And I think that's the beauty of the tea ceremony. As you know, they developed the tea ceremony in Japan originally so that basically means every movement is sufficient unto itself.

You're not moving towards the end result. You're just with what is. And that is the beauty.

It is possible that later it becomes a ritual and no longer works, there's certain deadness after a while that comes into a ritual and they may be performing the ritual, every movement is correct, but the presence is no longer there, that is possible too. But you will know that anybody with the slightest presence can tell the difference between somebody performing something like the tea ceremony or Tai Chi that requires intense presence. And you will know, I haven't learned Tai Chi, but I can watch Tai Chi and I know whether they're simply going through the movements and it may look fine on the surface, but the field of presence isn't there.

And somebody else going through the same movements and they see it emanates presence. And so that's the beauty of Tai Chi is that no movement is a means, you're not, when the arm moves from here, they're probably masters of Tai Chi here, so what am I talking about? But all I know is presence.

The hand moves from here to here and usually in your mind, you're already there. So the intervening movement or time period is a means to an end because the movement will have completed itself when it reaches there. So you're already mentally there and the hand is lagging behind.

So there's no presence, there's the projection of future that you're trying to get to. And then there's the possibility of moving in a way that at any stage of the movement, there's no movement into the future, there's continuous, you're not trying to get anywhere, just, and there's, that's the quality of presence flowing into it. And you could perform the same movement outwardly correctly, but you would have a mental projection there and the master would be able to tell or anybody, even if they know nothing about Tai Chi, would be able to tell that it doesn't, the emanation of presence isn't there.

But I, my feeling is that, I don't know anything about it, but my feeling is that presence, Tai Chi originated as spontaneous movement, presence expressing itself through a human being, in spontaneous, very slow kind of dance. And no movement was planned before. Nothing is, there's no, it moves with total nowness.

And simply one way in which presence can express itself, it can flow into. And so there was this, perhaps it was an old woman or an old man, or who knows, a young woman or a young man, suddenly moving and the few people around them saw, this is beautiful. What's he doing?

What's she doing? It was totally spontaneous. And then they said, this is so beautiful, we need to learn this.

And then gradually they started to see, okay, now he's lifting his right leg and then he holds it up for five seconds and then it goes down. So you can, you learn it by watching the spontaneity. Of course, now it becomes something learned, but even that can take you into presence.

It's not how it arose originally, my feeling is. And they, so they observed and then it became a technique, so to speak. But even the technique can work.

Although originally it came the other way around. Presence came and then it resulted in the movement. Now you perform the movement and the movement results in presence, if it works as it's meant to.

So we don't need to create a new world, that's good. Don't need to worry about that. Maybe I'll have one more question.

Thank you for choosing to share, choosing it in quotation marks. Thank you, it's good. Thank you for choosing to share your realization.

[Speaker 6] (8:54:30 - 8:55:17)

My question is around the issue of psychiatric medications and awakening. We have talked about this issue on ETT Forum. It is an issue in my life situation and the life situation of many others on the Forum.

Some believe they need to go after medications to awaken, and others say without the medication, they would not have enough clarity to even begin to bring presence in their lives. My question is, can a person take psychiatric medication and still awaken? Will psychiatric medication hold a person back or slow down the awakening process?

[Speaker 1] (8:55:19 - 8:55:39)

Thank you. Thank you. May I ask a personal question?

Are you on medication?

[Speaker 2] (8:55:40 - 8:55:40)

Yes.

[Speaker 1] (8:55:41 - 9:07:16)

But you're also here. That is already part of the answer. Because for you to be here, there must be some inner recognition of awareness.

And so despite whatever the medication is, or whatever their condition, your condition is, there is an arising of awareness. So it's easier for me to answer this question because you are standing there than an abstract question. You are living proof.

I'm not saying necessarily you don't experience periods when you are taken over by whatever patterns there are in the mind. But there is an opening into awareness, which is not the case with many people who are not on medication or who are considered normal. They are not standing here.

Many of them are not and wouldn't be. In them, there is no opening. So one cannot say categorically under this or that condition, awareness cannot arise, awakening cannot happen.

As a general rule, before anybody seeks help of that kind, I would advise to explore other possibilities. If you wish to gradually become free of medication, which in many cases can obscure the awareness that wants to arise, you would need to do it with a physician who is relatively conscious. There are some.

There are maybe twofold questions. One question is, with medication, is awareness able to come through? And of course, that depends what kind of medication, or over what period of time, and other factors.

But in some cases, I believe it is. In other cases, it's not. It can obscure the awareness.

The other question is, a certain mental, what is diagnosed as mental illness, can awareness arise there? And again, that depends on the nature of the illness. Sometimes in the West, shifts in consciousness are misinterpreted.

If they happen suddenly, they can be misinterpreted and misdiagnosed by a physician. And Western physicians, because they're conditioned by the Western system, have no idea of shifts in consciousness. It's not part of the medical model.

There are no shifts in consciousness in psychiatry. You can either, you are normal, but normal, of course, is insane, but they don't know that. Or you are illness, you're diseased, the mind is ill.

There are people who are put on medication, unfortunately, children sometimes, in increasing numbers, in whom there may simply be a change in consciousness happening. There are children who, for the most absurd reasons, are put on medication just to keep them quiet. And people like who in India, Ramana Maharshi, the Indian sage, who when he was 17, 16 or 17, suddenly did something that in the West would have been regarded as a sign of severe mental illness.

He left his home, he went to, took a train, and he sat down by a temple and stopped doing anything, didn't even put food in his mouth, just sat. And of course, in the West, they would have put him away. And in India, they respected it and allowed him to sit there and fed him, people came.

And after a few years, he started to speak again. And it turned out that he was awakened, he had awakened. But the shift was so sudden that he became dysfunctional for a while, from a normal viewpoint, became dysfunctional, couldn't operate anymore in the world.

So this can happen to people sometimes, and it's totally misinterpreted. So often, what is called medical psychiatric illness, not always can be a misdiagnosed shift in consciousness. At other times, there is actually a condition there with which it would be very difficult to live.

Many types of so-called schizophrenia, again, schizophrenia is a huge term which can be applied if you don't know what exactly is wrong, you call it schizophrenia, it's almost like that. The same way in the physical body, it's a viral infection, they don't really know, but this is a term that covers a lot of things, it's a viral infection. Oh, now I know what it is.

And then schizophrenia, now I know what it is. In many cases, it is true that in mental illness, the very cause of the illness can be total identification with certain mental movements, lack of awareness. I've had limited success when I worked with people one- on-one some years ago.

I had some people who had forms of schizophrenia who came to see me who were on medication, and by sitting with them and pointing to the possibility of awareness, they were able to become free and eventually also become free of the medication. For example, I remember one case, a woman came to see me who had severe auditory hallucinations, so-called voices. And again, we don't even know whether the entities actually are talking to her, it's possible, but it really comes to the same thing, whether it's thoughts in her head that take the form of a voice that she hears, the voice tells her to do something, it's very insistent, or several voices sometimes, very insistent, telling her to do this, do that, and enormous energy behind that voice.

And the way I approached it was to point out the possibility of not giving, not paying attention to the content of what the voice says, but simply to be aware that there is a voice speaking and that it is a voice in the head, it is a thought, I called it a thought, maybe it's something else, but it comes to the same thing. It's a thought, it's a voice, whatever it says, you say there's a voice, be the awareness for the voice, don't fight it, be the awareness so that the voice, you don't do what the voice says because you disregard the content. So if the voice says, you are God, say thank you, there's a voice again.

If the voice says you are the devil, thank you, there's the voice again. You are the awareness for the voice, disregard the content. Then gradually the voice lost its power because she disregarded the content of the voice, awareness grew.

So ultimately the healing in any case is awareness. So awareness can arise in the strangest circumstances and to people you would never have predicted could arise to, and that includes even people who have a so-called psychiatric disorder or who are on medication, it can happen. Nobody can categorically say that it cannot happen.

In some cases, those people are closer than normal people. As you know, there was a movement in psychiatry in the 60s and 70s where they, it was called anti-psychiatry, where it was recognized that often psychiatric conditions are really something else. So it's really, it is simple in your case that obviously despite the medication, you are here and something, a shift is happening inside you.

Nothing can stand against the power of awareness ultimately because the power of awareness is the power of the evolution of the universe itself. So nothing really that, it will, it seeks the slightest opening and it can come through that. So I would say that trust that as it's happening, it will continue to happen for you.

And there may be a point when with help, the medication won't be needed anymore as awareness grows, but you need somebody who is conscious to help you with that, a physician who is conscious to help you with that. It's wonderful to see that it is working.

Mother woke around noon.

She came into the kitchen without a word, face swollen on one side, the print of Father’s hand still purple across her cheek. She lit the stove, put water for coffee, and sat opposite me—the same chair where she had beaten me hours earlier.

I waited for the screaming to start again.
It never came.
Instead she stared at the cracked table and spoke so quietly I had to lean in.

“Your grandfather crossed a river once,” she said. 

“January. Forty-nine below. The guards shot the dogs first so the barking wouldn’t carry. He walked on the bodies of men who had fallen before him. Ice broke. Water took his boots, then his toes, one by one. When he reached the other side he had no feeling left below the knees, but he kept walking because the Russians were still behind.”

She stirred the coffee and let her gaze drift toward the Black Sea through the thin window.

“He came home in 1954. Skinny, grey, eyes like holes. The first night he slept in his own bed he woke screaming that the guards were dragging him back. My mother tried to calm him. He beat her unconscious with the same fists that had carried him across the ice. Said if she was soft the Russians would smell it on her and come for all of us.”

She looked at me then. Really looked.

“I was seven. He made me stand in the yard in February with no coat until I stopped crying. Said tears freeze and give your position away. When I came inside he beat me with the belt for shivering too loud. Every time I flinched he said, ‘Good. Remember this feeling. It will keep you alive.’”
The coffee boiled over. She didn’t move.
“That is what they taught him in the camp. Pain is a language. If you speak it first, nobody can use it on you.”

She tapped the spoon against the cup. Tap. Tap. Tap. Like bones.

“I thought I was teaching you to survive,” she whispered. “I thought if I made you hard enough, the world would leave you alone.”

Her voice cracked on the last word. Not tears—she had none left. Just the sound of something inside her finally breaking after forty years.

“I was wrong,” she said. “The world doesn’t leave you alone. It just waits until you’re the one holding the pipe.”

She stood, walked to the window, and stared out at the grey blocks, the laundry lines, and the red star still painted on the water tower even though nobody believed in it anymore.

“Go to your room,” she said without turning. “Your father will say what needs to be said when he comes home tonight.”

I went.

That was the only time she ever told me about her father.
The only time she ever came close to an apology.

Later, when the regime fell and people burned portraits in the streets, I understood: the guards never left Siberia. They just came home inside the people who survived them.

And some of us learned the language so well we started speaking it to our own children.
