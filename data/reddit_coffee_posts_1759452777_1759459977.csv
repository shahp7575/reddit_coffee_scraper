1nwnqpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1nwnqpn/struggling/,Struggling,"I have always tried to put myself out there when it comes to making friends but I‚Äôm really just at a loss at this point and have no idea why I‚Äôm always in this position.

I always wind up having to be the one who suggests making plans, planning everything, etc. I also tend to be excluded and truly have no idea why. It just seems to be getting worse the older I get. I just turned 53 (I don‚Äôt look like it or have the mindset that I‚Äôm ‚Äúolder.‚Äù I‚Äôm not a partier but I like doing fun things). 

Several examples of what I keep running into: 

A woman I met for coffee numerous times and thought I was becoming friends with has ignored my birthday entirely for 2 years while I went out of my way to buy her favorite cake and candles just as a mini celebration at coffee last year. I didn‚Äôt do it to get something in return, but to me, if you view each other as being on the same friendship level, she would have at least said happy birthday because she cared.

A nextdoor neighbor I‚Äôve had for over a decade will go through periods where she ghosts me for months other than saying hi in passing. I‚Äôve never understood it. We‚Äôve rarely done more than text or talk outside. She asks to borrow things regularly or for me to do things for her that inconvenient (I never ask for anything). She hasn‚Äôt asked me to go anywhere for years and when I ask her to do anything she declines unless it‚Äôs just to sit outside and drink. We‚Äôve always exchanged bday and holiday gifts and I‚Äôve always put more effort and thought into hers (she knows I‚Äôm gluten free and can‚Äôt tolerate scented products and she‚Äôs forever giving me things with gluten and perfume that I can‚Äôt use). We have a new neighbor and we all get along. Now I‚Äôm being excluded from sitting outside and only realize they‚Äôre out there when I hear noise. The new neighbor and I went hiking last week (we both know my next door neighbor won‚Äôt hike so we never asked) and my Nextdoor neighbor called her a couple times while we were on the trail to see if she wanted to go shopping. They didn‚Äôt have plans but 1. It felt like she was trying to rush us so the new neighbor could hang out with her, and 2. She knew I was there and never asked if I wanted to come, too.

I‚Äôm just really not sure if this is the new norm where people are just super self involved and only want to flit around to whoever is convenient at the time, or if this is just the people in my area who I run across who behave this way?

( I think it was really popular in the '70's, '80's and early '90's. )

 I wasn't a listener, but the host, Garrison Keillor, was very popular. as an Author, Voice-Actor and Humorist, he blended these warm entertaining stories with humor and music (I think). All very ""folksy"" & entertaining. 

(And there was also the late Dave Berry. EXTREMELY funny! And always kept it real) ‚ô•Ô∏è

Here's your *hint* Rosie: I know TWO people in Rose's Park who both worked with me when we wrote for Unsolved Mysteries from 1993 to about 2011. (Don't try to guess my name, I won't tell you, even if you do guess! Nothing personal). And a lot of us used ""pen-names"", including ""CC"", one of my oldest friends. (The only time that ""CC"" used her real name was when she was published in magazines. And, trust me, those checks added-up nicely).üëç

So, why am I posting this? 

Rose described what she did on Tik Tok as ""like Garrison Keillor and his radio show"". You know, ""some singing, some story-telling, and selling some items from Tik Tok shop"". 

It sounded not that different from all of us selling magazine articles on the side, and promoting books (and such) on talk radio.

 And ""CC"" didn't judge, she knew Rosie was on disability and drove Lyft. 

But what a surprise to find out the lies! The scamming, the ENTITLED rude behavior!

  Now, I still can't get her to post in this group. But, we'll see.

Oh, and to address ""money & gifts"" when it came to us? Our Moral Code(s) ?

 We had fans that would send us cute little ""posties"" from different places. Like Candy, homemade bracelets , fragrant soaps, nothing more than a few dollars American. And we ALWAYS returned in kind. 

A Coffee mug, a T-shirt, a signed magazine issue. That was how it is supposed to be done.

How offense, how insulting, that someone (like Rose), would have the nerve to call herself a ""Content Creator"", would DARE to compare herself to a professional like Garrison Keillor, and would dare to lie and abuse the public on Social Media! 

Of her many sins, this is up there with the unforgivable one.

Just my opinion.

1nwn8zk,https://i.redd.it/mdbopjlx4tsf1.jpeg,Daily makeup bag pans (with reviews),"I love project panning because it allows me to give so much love to favorite products instead of always chasing what‚Äôs new. 

L to R:
* Paula‚Äôs Choice Skin Recovery toner - this my 2nd or 3rd bottle. I have a two pack of rice toner to use, but if that isn‚Äôt blowing me away I will be right back to this toner! I have dry, rosacea prone skin and this is a soothing and hydrating step in my simple routine (4 steps). 

* Charlotte Tilbury setting spray - I love this stuff. Doesn‚Äôt irritate my skin, when combined with powder my makeup stays all day and doesn‚Äôt break up around my nose like usual. I have a large bottle and will refill the little one from it.

* Colourpop Supershock shadow in Ripple - love this lilac blue shimmer so much! I get more compliments on this than any other makeup product I‚Äôve ever owned. It‚Äôs about 18 mos old, so I added some Duraline to see if I can revive it; if not I will repurchase after checking my powder shadows to make sure I don‚Äôt own anything similar.

* Merit Blush Balm in Stockholm - perfect neutral pink blush for me. I opened it 9/24/24 so it‚Äôs just over a year old. It‚Äôs almost flat on top now and the center has a hole, so I expect to use this up by December or so. I have another ready to go in another shade I love it so much! 

* Colourpop Supershock Highlighter in Lunch Money - no idea why I bought other highlighters. It doesn‚Äôt highlight texture, is soft, and you get a lot of product for a few bucks.

* Summer Fridays Lip balm in Iced Coffee - these are so popular for a reason! I bought this in April I think and it‚Äôs got maybe 10-15% left with very regular use. 15 g of lip balm is a LOT, so get the mini sets at the holidays if you want different flavors.

* Charlotte Tilbury setting powder (mini) - I have NEVER liked powder before as someone with dry skin. I dusted this on top of my skin tint or foundation to make it last longer and it‚Äôs perfect for that. I have the full size too and it also has a dip in the center so I expect I‚Äôll hit pan in that this year.

* Wyn Skin Tint - criminally underrated!! It has SPF but doesn‚Äôt dry me out, it doesn‚Äôt have any white cast, and it doesn‚Äôt get oily by the end of the day. It also doesn‚Äôt have any fragrance. since it‚Äôs on clearance, I plan on buying one bottle.

* Rare Beauty Lip Liner - the color and formula of this are lovely, but it just does not stay. Like a lot of other lip liners being released recently, it‚Äôs more like a satin lipstick, but poured into a tiny mold. I like other Rare Beauty products, but this one is a miss for me!

‚ÄúYou look like the cat who ate a canary.‚Äù Julienne Picard, sitting across from me at the mountain safehouse outside Julpe Alto, made the comment so seriously that it rattled me from my staring contest with an old map of Nuevo Mundo that looked ancient based on the brittle look of the paper. 

She was dressed in a black jacket with a dark blue double-layer T-shirt underneath. Right next to her was the redheaded Madeleine Picard, the middle child of the Picard sisters. Josette, the baby of the family, was sipping a cup of coffee.

I simply looked up, not trusting myself to speak. Atlas, who was being patched up by a rebel medic, looked at the Picard sisters, but also remained silent. 

It was only after the rebel finished patching Atlas up that I spoke. ‚ÄúSo, Picards, what brings you three to Bolivia?‚Äù

In response, Julienne slid over a photograph of a heavyset woman with a Mohawk.

A woman I recognized immediately. Before I could voice my observations, however, Julienne spoke. ‚ÄúLenora Kastner. Her organization, Prime Eight, has been linked to a series of murders in Bolivia. We don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs up to, exactly, but we have reason to believe the kidnapping of Camille Girard is connected somehow.‚Äù 

Josette spoke next. ‚ÄúWe were digging for Intel on Lenora‚Äôs whereabouts in Bolivia when we saw the ambush in Julpe Alto.‚Äù 

I nodded slowly. ‚ÄúAllyraine is not going to like this.‚Äù When the Picard sisters gave me quizzical looks, I quickly clarified. ‚ÄúAllyraine is Phalanx Cyber Security‚Äôs corporate lawyer.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see,‚Äù Jock said, mulling over my words. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure why Phalanx would ask a couple guys from DedSec to escort Bernard‚Äôs family to Inca Camina.‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúI had the same question. All Allyraine told me was that there had been an assassination attempt on Bernard nine months ago.‚Äù

All three Girard sisters and Jock look at each other, concern written on all their faces.

Noticing my confused look, Vedette spoke next. ‚ÄúAllyraine didn‚Äôt tell you? Bernard has been banned from traveling to Bolivia.‚Äù

Now I was really intrigued. ‚ÄúBanned? Why?‚Äù

Josette offered Vedette her own mug of coffee. Accepting, Vedette took a sip before speaking. ‚ÄúThe story I heard from Bernard‚Äôs business partner Adolfo was that he had started supporting the rebels in their fight to free Bolivia. Santa Blanca found out somehow  and they used their connections in the Bolivian government to kick him out of the country. He was given seventy two hours to leave Bolivia, except Bernard ended up refusing to leave. That was when the cartel tried to kill him.‚Äù

My jaw dropped. Just like that, a piece of the puzzle had started falling into place: Allyraine telling me about the assassination attempt on Bernard nine months earlier, the proposition to fly Vedette and Camille to Nuevo Mundo.

But that left one question: why attempt to kidnap Vedette and Camille? 

Atlas spoke next. ‚ÄúIf the plan was to assassinate Bernard, why go after his sister and daughter?‚Äù

 ‚ÄúI heard it through the grapevine that after Bernard was booted from Bolivia, he made arrangements for his sister and daughter to take over rebel support operations,‚Äù Jock replied. ‚ÄúSanta Blanca somehow found out about that too, so I‚Äôm guessing the kidnapping was intended to send a message.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow does Lenora fit into all this?‚Äù I asked. 

The confused looks returned. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been trying to figure out too.‚Äù Jock said. ‚ÄúSo far, no leads.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut one thing is clear,‚Äù Madeleine said. ‚ÄúWhatever Kastner is doing, it‚Äôs connected to the plot against Phalanx.‚Äù

1nwn6x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1nwn6x4/pregnancy_impossible_to_hide/,Pregnancy Impossible to Hide,"For starters my husband, daughter, and I all live in the basement of my parents house. My mom is always super nosy anyways, but I wanted to keep this pregnancy quiet, just to make sure we‚Äôre actually having a baby this time around (unfortunate TFMR for the last one). I‚Äôm 6 weeks currently.

Well, I went to my first appointment last week and when they went to draw blood, they couldn‚Äôt get a vein, but left me with these massive bruises that I now have to try to hide üò≠ I usually tell my mom every little detail, especially if I have a doctor‚Äôs appointment so making up a lie isn‚Äôt the easiest to do if she sees it.

Because they couldn‚Äôt get a vein, they just told me to come the next week (this week). I meant to go on Monday to get it out of the way and just take my daughter to the park and use that as an excuse as to why I was out, but of course I got hit with the worse case of ragweed allergies that put me in bed for 3 days on top of my husband working late and the starting up of morning sickness.

So I went today, and was just going to use grocery shopping as an excuse, which wasn‚Äôt a complete lie and I was going to do that after. The lab is usually not busy at all, but of course today it was. 

After it was all said and done we finally finished shopping and my mom texted me asking what was taking so long. I said a log truck had flipped and traffic was bad (actually true, but we found another way around), we got food (also true), and went to Walmart and I got my glasses repaired while I was there because I needed to do that anyways lol (also also true). I just left going to the lab part out so I thought I was safe.

I got home and my mom immediately starts questioning if I‚Äôm pregnant üò≠ I already kinda suspected she was on to me because she was already being extra nosy, but her reasoning doesn‚Äôt even make sense to the actual reason she should‚Äôve suspected me lmao

She said first that two weekends ago we had guests and that I ‚Äúfreaked out‚Äù about wanting to clean the bathroom. I did mention that I wanted to clean the bathroom instead, but it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt like the way she does it and I had to clean with extra steps because I had to clean all my daughters bath toys from mold and stuff anyways.

The second thing she said is because my dang husband told her that he was getting me Tylenol one of the days I was sick when I usually take Advil/ibuprofen. It‚Äôs a good suspicion, but my husband usually takes Tylenol so it makes sense that he would get me that for a headache even if I weren‚Äôt pregnant.

So it‚Äôs not because of the large bruises on my arms, not because I‚Äôm randomly out for long periods of time, and not because I‚Äôve almost practically stopped drinking caffeine when I drink like 3 cups of coffee usually lol ü§î

I was going to announce it for Halloween. We‚Äôre going to be skeletons this year and the outfit I have picked out is a onesie, but since it‚Äôs supposed to be a skeleton you can see there‚Äôs a baby skeleton on the belly. 

It‚Äôs so cute but nosy mom might ruin it üò≠üò≠ I‚Äôm just hoping she‚Äôll forget about it. It‚Äôs only one month!

PLEASE be my moral compass for this one.

So, here's the story from the beginning:

Back when I was in high school, I (currently 20F) met my ex boyfriend (currently 22M). Let's call him Peter. The story of our relationship was peculiar and is kind of complicated to sum up, but essentially, he went to live in another country and we alternated through periods of considering ourselves a couple and not considering ourselves a couple. We really liked each other but the distance made it very hard to have a solid relationship. Over the course of two years we talked for hours every day, had hopes and dreams of one day being together for real, and spent a couple of months together during vacations, when he came to my country or I went to his. At the same time during this period there were moments when we decided to have a sort of ""open relationship"" and were with other people as well (never in other relationships, I mean just hookups). 

Anyway. Around the end of 2023 we started having more problems, we felt that we both had changed quite a bit as people and decided to have an official breakup. It was partly due to the distance and partly due to these changes I've mentioned. Anyway it just kinda stopped working and we officially began to recognize each other as friends. But we never had a big argument or anything like that, of course we were hurt by each other in certain ways, and we did argue over certain things, but there was never a ""goodbye I want you to disappear from my life"" moment. Obviously we started to talk less, began to lead our own lives more emotionally distantly from each other and the feeling eventually died out. But we always kept in touch, told each other what was new in our lives, everything in a very friendly note. In July 2024 I traveled to the country where he lives (for academic purposes) and we saw each other again, officially just as friends. At the time he was dating another girl actually. We literally slept in the same room for a week (in separate beds, it's a long story, I was in his country but not in his city, and yes his girlfriend allowed this lmao) and nothing at all happened. The feeling literally died, I saw him as nothing but a friend. And to this day it is just like that. We call each other sometimes, tell each other what's new, we have interests in common so we talk about them, but we are not romantically interested in each other. We don't talk every day of every week, but we keep in touch. It's a friendship. It's not really that complicated.

Anyway, life went on, and as of October 2024, so nearly a year ago, I started dating my current boyfriend (21M). Let's call him Henry. Henry and I have since then been in a great relationship. We love each other very much and get along really well. We study at the same university so I see him every day. He is friends with my friends and I am friends with his. We never argue, we have gotten to the point of sometimes being worried by the fact that we never argue (like, shouldn't couples argue at some point?). With Henry I've had my first stable and, let's put it like this, real relationship (an ""I-have-the-key-to-his-house relationship""). It's great and it works out great. 

Henry knows about Peter. He knows the story, knows that we talk sometimes and that we consider each other friends, and, although he of course kind of hates the guy, he's alright with it. Like, it never brought us any real problems. I am not particularly jealous of his exes either, I even consider a girl who was his ""school crush"" to be kind of my friend (she now dates another friend of Henry's lol). NOW TIME FOR THE ISSUE. Basically a couple months ago Peter told me that he was going to come to my country to visit his family. I told Henry about this and we kind of talked about it throughout the months, but it was a sort of distant reality, so never too seriously. However one week ago or so the reality became not so distant. I had kind of forgotten about the whole thing but then Peter reminded me that ""oh hey, I'll be in town next week, want to grab a cup of coffee?"". 

Well, shit. What now? I hadn't seriously thought about it. Now, some of you will probably be mad at me for this one, but in my mind, ""grabbing a cup of coffee"" with Peter was not at all that big of a deal. YES I KNOW, ""he is my ex so it has to be a big deal"". Except in my mind it kind of isn't. I never saw it as ""I am going out with my ex"", to me it was simply ""I will say hello to an old friend of mine who is in my city after literal years"". Just very simple.

But then when the time came for me and Henry to really talk about it, all hell kind of broke loose. That's when I realized that the jealousy he felt towards Peter wasn't a light thing or a joke, but rather something real and honest. He REALLY hated the idea of me seeing him, being in the same space as him. He wasn't angry at me or mad about it, but he got really upset and hurt at the fact that I'd sort of have the audacity to grab that HEINOUS cup of coffee. I swear to God that it was only then that my perspective sort of shifted and I was like, ""ah shit, it kind of IS like I'm going out with my ex, huh?"". But at the same time, I CAN'T SEE IT AS BEING THAT BIG OF A DEAL. My feelings for Peter are long gone, his feelings for me are also long gone, we would be simply friends having coffee because it's convenient to have coffee with a person who you haven't seen in a year. 

So now what the hell was I supposed to do? I talked to some friends of mine and they all told me that although they understood where I was coming from, they had to side with Henry ‚Äî it really is weird for a person who is in a relationship to go out for a one-on-one conversation with their ex. But at the same time, he isn't simply ""my ex"", he is a person who I consider my good friend! I talked to Peter about how everyone was reacting and he was just as surprised as me. He also sees me as a friend rather than as ""his ex"". Maybe this is because our breakup wasn't so harsh? Or are we simply lunatics? I don't know at this point. Peter told me that he wouldn't be angry if we couldn't see each other and that he didn't want to cause me any problems, but at the same time he sort of expressed that he'd be disappointed because we had been planning on meeting and after all we are just friends having coffee.

Now I feel like I'm in a position where no matter what I do I will offend someone. On the one hand, if I don't meet Peter like the etiquette of friendship sort of obliges me to, it feels like I'm sending a message of ""I am excluding you from my life"". It feels to me like an offensive thing to do to just sort of say ""sorry I cannot be in the same room as you"" to someone. It would be honestly sad to me to cut off a friendship with a person who I've been through a lot with and who, like it or not, is a special person in my life (I MEAN THIS IN A FRIENDLY WAY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. SERIOUSLY). On the other hand, I love Henry so much and I don't want to create distrust between us or do something that would hurt him. After many conversations he has expressed to me that he is fine with me and Peter meeting each other (also because we'd meet with other people present, not just us two) and that he doesn't want me to give up friendships because of him. But I can sense that he still feels upset about it. 

Is this really a ""you have to give one person up"" situation? Really??? Over something this --- in my opinion --- small and stupid? I never expected this situation to turn so frustrating and complicated. Honestly I don't know how to solve this without hurting anyone.

Whoever you are, I wanted to start off by telling you that you are loved, appreciated and cared for. The reason why I wanted to start a blog is because, I am a 21 year old girl who craves real, deep friendships, not just surface level. I was never meant for small talk. After graduating high school in 2022, I have always struggled to make friendships, and I mean true friendships. I have made countless of surface layer friendships, It is completely exhausting. I am not a surface layer friend, It is a facade and It feels robotic. All of my friendships have been fostered at work, forced proximity, and while I do enjoy my friendships, I dream of having a group of friends where I feel like myself. I want to go to the beach, your favorite coffee shop, I want to cry together and feel vulnerable. I don‚Äôt want to talk about how my weekend went, I want to ask about your family, talk about your annoying siblings and complain with you. I want to go to the gym together, and complain about how I want to leave and go get smoothies. My problem is that I am afraid of putting myself in spaces where I can nurture new friendships. I find it difficult to be vulnerable with new people because of my past friendships. There has been many occasions where I have been authentically myself, and people use my vulnerability against me. My partner of six years is in a fraternity in one of the most social Universities in my city, while I do not particularly yearn to take part in Panhellenic , I envy his ability to communicate with others. He is quite interested in Philosophy and I have learned a few ideas from him. Such as not comparing my own life to others, especially lives that I see on Youtube or TikTok, or even in my other-worldly fantasy books. I guess it is just difficult to apply when I am 21 years old, living in 2025, where everything is perfectly fabricated online and made with the intention of making someone‚Äôs life seem picture-perfect. As a woman, I believe that everyone should have female friendships, women are the backbone of most families, they are the creators of mankind, those who have been blessed with tight-knit families can understand that your family would be nothing, without your mom. It is a superpower, being a mother, they are inherently good at taking care of others. I have had the privilege to be raised by both of my biological parents, grandparents, and a sister who is nine years older than me. I would assume that my longing for female friendships stem from the lack of affection from my mother, but who am I to self read. There is a saying that I have heard quite frequently as I grow older. It is ‚ÄúIt is better to be alone, than in bad company‚Äù. While I completely agree, it can get lonely. I have diagnosed OCD, ADHD, and an Anxiety Disorder which means that I struggle daily with unwanted thoughts, I tend to blame myself and question my own character for my lack of friendships, or just for being simply who I am. I am grateful for my partner, who makes me feel that I am not alone, even though he does not always express his gratitude and appreciation for me, I feel it. Apologies for the ramble, I am heavily caffeinated, but with this I shall end my first blog with saying, if anything I have said in this post has resonated with you, then please share your story. I would love to hear how you escaped out of the shackles that is feeling alone. Again, you are loved, appreciated, and cared for.",1,1759457127.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1nwmtvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1nwmtvd/first_crush_ever_help/,First crush ever! Help!,"Hello I (19F) have only ever had a crush one time. It‚Äôs been 3 years since then and I now have an intense crush for this guy who is a coworker. This feeling is such a burden. I feel disgusting and uncomfortable about it (this stems from my lack of self esteem) I think about him all the time and I don‚Äôt know how to get out of it or how to tell if I have a chance or not. Sorry it‚Äôs kind of long and if I look insane (I‚Äôm going insane!!!!) 

The most humiliating part of all of this is that he asked my friend out around March. I despised him and was annoyed. But anytime he spoke to me, I came back. So effing embarrassing for me. Now I am even deeper than ever. It is so infuriating knowing I will never have a chance. I am taking the L and just waiting for the day I leave and never see him again. Anytime he talks to me I tense up and go blank. God I am so fucking awkward. I have so much more to say too. I say all of this but I still believe I have a 40% chance with him. Even a sliver of hope keeps me going. I remember almost every interaction I have had with him. 

Every interaction: ‚ÄúHello :)‚Äù ‚ÄúHi‚Äù ‚ÄúGood Morning‚Äù then one day he asked out of the blue if I liked a specific coffee. Why did he ask me that? I still have no clue. I‚Äôd like to think it was to start a conversation but he is too awkward lol. I thought that was so cute‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I mean, maybe he noticed I have coffee with me usually? Maybe‚Ä¶ just maybe‚Ä¶ he is curious about me? We smile when we make eye contact, and giggle a bit sometimes too. One time I went up the elevator to pick up one of my elderly coworkers, we bumped into each other when I was getting out. He started laughing and I did too. The woman was talking like how an old person usually does and he started laughing more and more and so did I. What a weird interaction. He‚Äôs asked me the date before, which is weird because usually don‚Äôt you just look at your phone? That has to mean something right? Usually, I avoid eye contact with him because I am shy and I do the opposite when I like someone. I don‚Äôt say anything first either, just observe from afar. It was half the day in, no interaction at all between us yet. He said ‚ÄúHi (my name)!‚Äù I said ‚Äú hi ??‚Äù back because it caught me off guard. He left and yelled ‚ÄúHi (my name) !!‚Äù I was so confused by that. I cannot tell for the life of me if he is making fun of me or not. He asked me if I was going to this associate event and I said yes why? I couldn‚Äôt hear his answer but I said he should go and that it would be fun. He asked me where and said ‚Äúthank you :)‚Äù He ended up going! I was so excited. Me, him, and my friend and another coworker all sat together and played games. I made a lot of jokes and he was laughing so much. Boosted my ego lollll. He then left abruptly because he didn‚Äôt win anything and I was so sad :(. I wanted to hang out more. He then was gone for three weeks and during that time I was in shambles. I wanted to see his face again so desperately. 

When he came back he said NOTHING. GOD WHAT THE EFF!!!!!!!! He only said Hi when I walked into the clock out room for lunch and that was it. The next day though, I made it a mission to say good morning to him. I waited for him to say it but he walked right past me! I said good morning when he came back and he said it back. Sometimes he makes mistakes and I laugh a bit and he does too. Anyway later in the day, my friend (the one he asked out üò≠üò≠ she doesn‚Äôt like him at all btw) helped me. We vaguely talked with him, laughed a bit, and got his instagram for a ‚Äúwork groupchat‚Äù wink wink. That was it though. Now I am on my day off and thinking about all of this. Those specific interactions give me hope but some days he doesn‚Äôt say anything and just stares blankly. But then I think. Well, I mean how was I that day? I probably look like I am not interested. Also we NEVER actually have long conversations, only hellos, and looks, that's it.  

God I hate this. I want my suffering to end. Another part of me thinks he‚Äôs just making fun of me and this is all a huge prank. Or just so he can get closer with my friend. Like what if he thinks she is interested in him now? Ughhh‚Ä¶Anyway I don't know what to make of all of this. I stalked his instagram and it's just prolonging my feelings. Save me please !!!!

It's my first time renting an airbnb where the host \[also M, looks to be in his 30s\] is staying on-site - it's a 1 bedroom apartment, where I'll get the bedroom and he'll be sleeping in the living room. Apparently the living room has a screen that he pulls shut to sleep, for some privacy. He's got a bunch of good reviews so it all seems legit.

Anyway - first time as an airbnb guest where the host will be staying on site. I wanted to ask what the etiquette is in shared spaces? His rules say it's a shared bathroom, no cooking in the kitchen but welcome to use it for tea/coffee. And I messaged him to check if I can have breakfast in the kitchen and he said that's fine and that ""it's a chill house"".

* I wake up pretty early - if I'm up before my host is awake (while his living room screen is closed), should I be tiptoeing around if I need to use the kitchen/bathroom?
* Should I be like telling him when I'm leaving/when I'll be home? Assuming I'll have a key as normal.
* What's etiquette like for dress code in shared spaces? e.g. walking from the shower to my room, do I need to get fully dressed in the bathroom or can I just walk out in a towel to get to my room?

Am I overreacting by taking these things as hints? 

I was recommended a real estate agent by a friend. At our first meeting, I was kind of floored by how attractive this woman is. But that was it. I‚Äôm not there to hit on someone, meet someone, etc, and she is a professional, and this is a professional relationship. So after the initial ‚Äúwhoa, she‚Äôs gorgeous‚Äù I didn‚Äôt give it a second thought. I am guessing at her age. She could pass as low as like 27-28 looks wise but based on context she has to be at least 30, probably mid 30s.

I thought she ghosted me after I had been trying to get information on some properties, so I emailed the company she works for and asked if someone could help me out, and mentioned that I had not heard from her.

I got a text from her shortly after, apologizing and explaining that she had not been receiving any messages from me, that her phone or email provider was having issues. So we met up to go over some properties, chit chatted a little, and made a lot of progress. Then she kind of just kept talking about non work things for a bit, then had to go. I stood up and she hugged me, then quickly was like ‚Äúoh, I‚Äôm a hugger, hope that‚Äôs ok.‚Äù I was like ‚Äúof course.‚Äù

The next time, we met to look at a specific property. I texted her way too last minute because I forgot I needed her to open the doors- I was actually meeting a contractor. But she made the time but told me she had a meeting like 45 minutes later.

So she met us, we got the info we needed from the property, and the contractor left. She asked me if I had tried this coffee shop around the corner, we had talked about it before. I was like no but I do plan on it soon. She said ‚Äúyou want to?‚Äù Yes duh obviously. And this was already about the time she was supposed to have a meeting. I asked if she was good time wise and she was like yeah, no worries.

So we got drinks and just hung out for like half an hour, not much business talk. Another hug and we left. She texted me like 3 minutes later to give me a lunch suggestion and laugh reacted my response.

So. Are these like obvious hints?? Or is this fairly normal in real estate interactions? I‚Äôm not going to ask her out or something, but I absolutely would date her, she‚Äôs actually an awesome person. But I am not going to risk making the professional relationship weird, but also don‚Äôt want to imply that I‚Äôm not interested. Because I am IF she is.

Update: I typed and tried to post this like 8 hours ago. Since then I kinda put a low key feeler out. Texted her about a property question then transitioned it to something related to a local festival. She responded to both, and I just liked or laughed at the response or something. Then about 20 minutes later she texted me about non business stuff. Just about me. So we‚Äôve gone back and forth a little.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

Was homeschooled pre-k through 11th grade, went to high school my senior year. I'm 21 and in university now.... but for a bunch of reasons I have to take this year off. 

Since coming to college I have left my dorm/apartment as soon as I'm dressed in the morning and not come back until I have to go to bed. This works great when I'm actively in school because I can sit around on campus and do whatever I want. Campus feels more like home than my home does because I can be comfortable there and if I get sick of sitting in one spot I can just get up and move. 

I hate, hate, hate spending time in my apartment. There's nothing wrong with my apartment, it's a nice place, it's comfortable, I've decorated my room and everything, I'm good friends with my roommates and love being around them. But if I don't have at least the option of being somewhere else through the entire day every day of the week my mental health gets so bad so quickly. Just having a one-off ""lazy saturday"" where I don't have an excuse to leave the house makes me feel a little miserable. All 3 summers I've worked a full time job and it hasn't been enough to stop me from feeling like a caged animal the other 40 waking hours of the week. The claustrophobia is intolerable. It makes me want to scream. It feels like I'm getting eaten by acid from the inside out. The constantly overscheduled college campus squatter lifestyle is my favorite way to live and I haven't really adjusted to adult life outside of that.

Anyways, point of post- I'm withdrawn from university until next fall, and I can't go on campus to just sit and exist where there are other people. I have been leaving the house for errands etc, work, grocery shopping, the gym, but it is not enough to get the feeling to go away. I am already so miserable and it's only been a week without school. I can't deal with it. The weather where I live is too bad to go to parks, etc. in the winter. I can go to the public library, but that's only one place, and I know I'll get just as sick of it very quickly. I can go sit in coffee shops but I don't have the money to do that every day.

Does anyone have advice on how to get better at coping with being home? or suggestions for other places I can go to get away from my bedroom and kitchen and living room? Idk how to get through this year. Or the rest of my life after I graduate.",1,1759456339.0,HomeschoolRecovery,0,1.0,False

She never would accept that she was wrong or accept criticism without an argument. It was not really self-advocacy, but I believe it was rooted with that intent due to being mistreated her whole life growing up by her family and peers. It was a learned behavior to become very defensive and protective of herself when she got to that point to finally use her voice. At times, though, it can simply just escalate out of control in ways that may seem unnatural or not helpful. I did not ever want to hurt her with my words, but I felt like no matter what I was unintentionally going to and it was going to lead to her trying to fight. If I shut down and walked away, suddenly I did not care about her anymore and we needed to break-up. I understood her trust issues and her desire to be heard and believed she was in the right when she was constantly told growing up she was always in the wrong. That type of toxic childhood environment I understood in some ways because of my own homelife. It is very ostracizing and fuels self-loathing. I never got to the point of self-advocating for myself, so I still would shut down when she would want to argue about things. I always just let her win, like I let my family win. But ultimately we always came back together, drawn back together, because there was always a piece we shared that understood each other in a way no one else could. It just sometimes took some reflection to remind ourselves of that. 
I never would have abandoned her like all the others in her life did, or so I thought, but things changed with Kyle. The hormones were raging and she had to start taking different medications to help for her mental health that she was told should not harm the baby, which meant stockpiling the ones that did help and would hurt the fetus in the medicine cabinet. She would beg for them at times for those old medications, when the emotional, mental, and physical pain was too much to bear. She could care less about the consequences of taking them when she already wanted to die and kill her child. This started fights. How could she selfishly put our own child in danger by trying to get these toxic medications that could hurt him for her to just have a temporary sense of relief? She was stronger than that, I thought. But I became too harsh, too critical. I did start fighting. And when fighting follows suit with distancing, it makes it much harder to return to one another and say ‚Äúsorry‚Äù. It is even harder when it is the tenth time doing it because the words soon just become only that, words, not action to change. But when her words only were about hurting Kyle and cutting him out of her womb, it was debilitating to hear. I could not understand how any mother could say that about her unborn son. I felt the pills were just a scapegoat for her cruelty of not wanting to be on bedrest due to issues she created by taking her old medications the first few weeks of pregnancy unknowingly. Or maybe it was also a scapegoat for her anger towards not having the daughter she really wanted. The fault with these statements is that I was using my own ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù analysis to create false narratives to feed myself an answer I felt was reasonable without truly trying to get the issue addressed. It only fueled my anger and resentment towards her, while leaving her to only feel isolated as she suffered lacking any sense of control over her emotions and thoughts to a point, I find out now through her diary, that actually scared her. It was a cry for help, yet my biased anger dismissed it. 

Bargaining

Now I can help her. I can help her get down from these rafters and bring her back home. I found a stool offset to the corner. I reached into my pocket to pull out my utility knife. I tried to position the stool away from the saturated floorboards so that I felt more secure to put my weight on the stool itself. I gradually lifted myself atop the stool, but lost some footing in the process. My arms reached out to brace myself and ended up wrapping around the decay of her shoulder blades. I could feel her skin start to slide off the bone and the bugs crawl from underneath onto my own forearm. And though I was completely in disgust by the atrocity of the maggots and flies and rotten human meat that leaked its juices onto me, I knew in the same breath that she had just saved me from falling. She had embraced me. I felt forgiveness. I slowly pulled myself back upright as I followed the umbilical cord and made it to right above her head where it dangled her body from the weeping rafter. I held the cord with my left hand and flipped the Swiss Army knife‚Äôs scissors open with my right hand where I was able to grip it between my fingers and my thumb in the loop of the scissors and raise it to the exposed umbilical cord. I snipped at the umbilical cord, through its now rubbery elastic flesh, and worked my way across its midsection until it reached its final bit of flesh that held onto her body with all its might. I snipped it clean and let her fall. Her body hit the floor like a sack of potatoes and her limbs contorted underneath her in a way that was not natural. She was now a helpless rag doll just wanting to go home, looking for her child. I stepped back down off the stool and walked over to her swollen body and pondered how heavy she would be to lift in my arms. The fluid that had built up inside her was beyond my ability to lift along with the dead weight it also carried. I had to figure out another plan to help her escape. That is when I thought about the floorboards. Maybe just removing more of the floorboards could allow me to gently lower her to the freedom of the floor below. 
I attempted to use different instruments of my utility knife to help pry the nails off of the more soggy floorboard pieces. I pried off four more that had been soaked in fluid and were able to be hoisted. When all four floorboard pieces were removed, I carefully watched my footing and  went to grab her ankles to try to bring her feet closer to the opening. I drug myself on my hands and knees, the seeping body fluid began coating my hands, forearms, and legs. I had no time to be bothered by this though, and the vile smell only became a distant memory. I pulled more upward on her calves and saw how her clothing was allowing me to slide her more easily. She had been draped in a silk nightgown, whose smooth texture helped with the transitioning of her body. I finally pulled her forward enough where I was able to maneuver her feet into the gaping hole in the floor. The way her skin slid on its surface made it hard to not cause any further damage to what had already been done, but it was all soon going to be over. Once her calves were extended down into the hole, I was able to get behind her body and try to push her into an upright position. The moment I put pressure on her back a chunk of maggots fell from beneath her gown and wriggled on the floor before me. It was the life she created and for that I could not be upset. It would go down with her. I pushed the pile of maggots off to the side and scooped them in my hands to throw them down the hole. I then proceeded to sit beside her with my own legs hanging over the edge, kicking my feet like a child. 
‚ÄúYou first,‚Äù I stated. ‚ÄúI want to make sure you can be lowered safely, and I will be behind you.‚Äù
I began to use my left hand and arm to push against her lower back to help scoot her bottom forward, while using my right hand to help keep her from leaning too far over. As she scooted, a stain of bodily fluids, murky brown, trailed behind her like a snail. When her bottom got so far off the edge, I could tell one more push and she would be able to fall below. I thought I was ready for this, but when I gave her the final nudge with my left arm, my right hand would not release. The abrupt weighted fall of her swollen corpse sharply pulled me forward to where my forehead hit the floorboards in front of me and I quickly in a panic gripped with all my might with my left hand onto the floor boards above, digging my already peeled and broken nails yet again in between the crevices of the boards and eliciting such sharp excruciating pain that no sound could leave my voice when I screamed. My forearm was still laying above on the floorboards and I knew I could not hold on much longer. Panicked, I knew that I did not want to crush her on the fall down, so I knew I had to let her go. But I was not ready. How could I ever be ready? I slowly loosened my grip on her hand and felt as each of her fingers slipped through, feeling some skin tear in the process. Suddenly she was gone. I did not want to land on top of her and so decided to throw my right arm up now and use my bit of upper body strength left to raise my torso slowly back up little by little onto the attic floor. Once I was able to finally get to my feet again, I looked down the hole and expected to see her body laying there waiting for me, when I suddenly realized that I had made a grave mistake. She had landed right in the middle of the red sticky pool on the kitchen floor that formed perfectly around her body, almost as if it was morphing to her shape, and slowly was pulling her within its grasp. 

Depression

I could feel my heart suddenly become thwarted with intense panic and fear. I could not understand how I could have been so careless and dumb. Just as in her life I am also in her death, a mistake. I quickly ran out the attic and down the winding stairs. I pushed open the cryptic door of doused dreams and tumbled down the upper hall to the steps where I scurried to the main floor. By the time I had turned left to get to the kitchen, I watched as the red puddle of goop now only surrounded her head, her face simply peering above it. It was receding as it was pulling her within. I was losing precious time. That panic began to ignite within me, only to freeze me in my steps. I watched as suddenly the swollen decay of my wife‚Äôs face started to wash away and her youth and life pushed back through. Her skin became tighter as maggots and fluid were pushed out. Her epidermis simultaneously healed to where it was just that smooth milk tea tone with even a slight rosey flush to her cheeks. Her swollen tongue shrank back into her jaw and her lips slowly pressed shut flushed pink. Even though her eyes were shut, I had half expected them to open up and for her to talk to me one last time. 
‚ÄúI love you Gloria,‚Äù I uttered from the deepest depths of my twisted stomach out through my shattered chest and aching heart. 
Upon the utterance of her name, she immediately was swallowed below where the red pool now squeezed itself only into a small spot of crimson much similar to the size of a penny. 

Acceptance 

I suddenly hear a ‚Äúmeow‚Äù reverberate off the walls and see Charlie come stomping around the corner of the dining room and into the kitchen, jumping up to his favorite spot on the counter. 
‚ÄúMommy loved you very much, you know that right,‚Äù I told Charlie. 
Charlie happily purred and licked his right paw as he sat before me quite content. 
‚ÄúShe loves us, Charlie,‚Äù I rephrased. 
Charlie looked up and angled his face in a way that I swore he was smiling as his front fangs hung low over his bottom lip. 
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get some food and treats,‚Äù I stated as I went over to the pet cabinet that I had been neglecting for so long that I felt sick to my stomach. I poured a large scoop of food into his cat bowl and his serving size of 12 treats and proceeded to get him some fresh water. Some water spilt on the counter as I maneuvered the bowl about. I first placed Charlie‚Äôs bowl down on the ground and then went over to the towel drawer to grab something to wipe the water up. When I opened the drawer I noticed sitting on top was a white hand made doily Gloria had made when she first was put on bedrest. She told me how her grandmother taught her how to make them when she was younger and it was a fond memory she had together with her. I grabbed the doily with its intricacies in my left hand and a towel in my right. I used the towel to wipe up the water and laid it over the handle of the stove. 
I looked at the doily in my hand and fidgeted with it between my fingers, unsure of what I wanted to do with it, but knew it was one of the last things she made for me and I just didn‚Äôt want to let it go. Charlie started to try to grab it from my hand as I reached up in a cabinet for a coffee mug. With one quick swift movement he pulled it through my fist and dangled it over the edge of the counter before shaking his paw so that it fell to the ground. I quickly turned around and, as I had expected, it had landed right on that small droplet of red that was still left on that kitchen floor. But the red simply absorbed into the doily and spread across its intricate line work as it patterned like a snowflake. It absorbed until the spot of red was off the floor entirely. 
I picked up the doily and cocked my head to analyze it and ponder what just happened.  Charlie mimicked the same gesture of thought. 
‚ÄúMaybe this is not too bad after all,‚Äù I said to Charlie. ‚ÄúI think I will keep this close to me.‚Äù 
I tucked the small doily stained in red inside my back jeans pocket where I realized that the diary of Gloria‚Äôs was still secure in the back of my pants. I pulled the diary out once again and held it in my hands, closing my eyes in meditation. Charlie came up to the counter‚Äôs edge and started trying to rub my hands and purred. I flipped open to a random page and decided to open my eyes and see what it said. 
It read, 

   ‚ÄúI know I drive you crazy. We drive each other crazy. I always push you away. But I love you, baby. We are going to have a beautiful family together. It will all be okay. I just got to get through these next 4 months. I can do this.‚Äù 

She proceeded to decorate flowers all around the page‚Äôs edges with hearts interlocked around our names forever together.  Right below was drawn one big smiley face with names listed below, 

‚ÄúMr. Stephen and Mrs. Gloria Staples and baby Kyle Stephen Staples. ‚Äù

I took a heavy sigh, ‚ÄúWe were so close.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt worth reflecting on too much at the moment. I had a furbaby needing some cat nip and cuddles and comfort. We all missed Gloria. She will always be with us, because love never dies, but we must learn to still live for those who are still actively in our lives, including ourselves. Life unfortunately continues forward, but I live for her now and for Kyle, and I will not ever let her down again, even though I know she will always love me till the end.
 I glanced back up at Charlie and noticed beside him that her Smiley face mug was gleaming happily back at me.

I have the opportunity to spend the entirety of February 2026 in San Fransisco at a pretty good AirBnB deal, however I still hesitate because it gets in the way of my ""saving up money"" goals. I especially hesitate since i know I'm bad at cooking for myself in temporary homes like this; I'll most likely try to prepare myself lunch/breakfast each day and then bail a week in because I'm weak-willed.

So basically: if you subtract housing expenses from the equation, and take in the fact that I'll be going car-free, how much more expensive is daily life in San Francisco compared to upstate New York? Or in other words, when people from California tell me that an iced coffee in San Francisco costs $12, are they telling a truth? Because I ain't paying that! I once told a Californian that i bought a bacon egg and cheese bagel for ""just"" $6, and he was astonished at how cheap that was.

EDIT: After writing this post I realized that my real question here is if you guys have recommendations for cheap restaurants/cafes in the city, and other budget-managing tips in general.

""Each chapter gets darker.""

Chapter One: The Disappearance

The last time anyone saw Mariah Lopez was on a quiet Thursday night in Ridgeway, Utah, a town so small it prided itself on knowing everyone‚Äôs business before the news made it official.

She left the Neon Cactus, a dim-lit bar wedged between a pawnshop and an abandoned laundromat, just past midnight. Witnesses remembered her laughing, her voice sharp enough to cut through the stale country song on the jukebox. She told her friends she was walking home, it was only a mile and a half, and she hated waiting for rides.

The street cameras caught her at 12:07 a.m. turning onto Maple Avenue, her pink jacket glowing under the sodium lights. At 12:13, another camera spotted her crossing the empty intersection near St. Bridget‚Äôs Church. By 12:18, she was gone. No more footage. No more trace.

Her roommate, Cassie Rhodes, woke to find Mariah‚Äôs bed untouched. By morning, the police were notified, though in Ridgeway, ‚Äúmissing‚Äù didn‚Äôt carry urgency unless twenty-four hours had passed. Still, the town buzzed. People whispered in the grocery store aisles and lingered outside the bar, retracing Mariah‚Äôs final steps with nervous fingers pointed toward the shadows.

What unsettled everyone most wasn‚Äôt just her disappearance, but the silence that followed. Mariah was loud, unpredictable, magnetic. She didn‚Äôt just vanish quietly; she left a void that hummed.

That day, Cassie sat in the kitchen staring at Mariah‚Äôs phone, which had been left charging by the coffee maker, screen cracked and buzzing with unanswered messages. One new text lit the display:

Unknown Number: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wait up. Midnight.‚Äù

1nwmdva,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yosemite/comments/1nwmdva/housekeeping_camp_experience_oc/,Housekeeping Camp Experience [OC],"There were mixed (and really helpful!) reviews of Housekeeping Camp, so I thought I would add my positive one to the mix (1st time posting).

I stayed 2 nights/3 days earlier this week and loved it!

I had only tent-camped and yurt-glamped before this, and my biggest concerns going in were 1. the ""shower curtain"" 4th wall and fears that all the bugs, rodents, bats, and bears would be coming in to snuggle (none did!), and 2. the noise-level, since I'm a really light sleeper (no issues!).

The location of this campground is incredible - walking a few feet from the unit to the Merced River beach and drinking coffee while looking at Half Dome at sunrise?!

Disclaimers:

* Everyone around my unit observed the food storage and quiet hour rules.
* Not all the units were rented each night, so not at full capacity.
* I was in the D section (D202) which is an outskirt area near the river, which I heard is quieter than more central sections.
* The campground closes mid-October, and once Labor Day weekend passes, it isn't as busy (mid-Sept to mid-Oct visit is probably very different from peak/summer).

Here are tips I appreciated:

* Bring with:
   * Fitted sheets, then use sleeping bags or actual bedding on top of that.
   * Fragrance-free alcohol wipes (I found some from Honest brand) and wipe everything down when you arrive and each morning.
   * String lighting to decorate (it seemed like most units did this).
   * Round table cloth for the picnic table - easier to clean and not lose smaller items through the table holes.
   * Toilet paper and soap - the communal restrooms and showers can run out.
   * Small zip ties to better secure the privacy curtain (mine only had hooks through every 3rd hole, which gapped when a storm came through).

I will definitely stay there again!

Opening a new caf√© or restaurant is risky, and one of the biggest unknowns is whether the location will actually work. My idea is to build an **AI-powered tool that analyzes potential locations** using data like:

* **Rental history of the location (**what business was the location rented out before, vacancy turnover, feedbacks on the landlord...)
* **Foot traffic** (how busy the area is at different times of day)
* **Nearby businesses** (other cafes, restaurants, offices, hotels, schools, etc. within a certain radius)
* **Points of interest** (parks, tourist spots, transit stops, etc.)
* **Competitive density & demand gaps** (e.g., 10 coffee shops but no bubble tea place nearby)

The output would be a simple, easy-to-understand **report** for entrepreneurs, landlords, or investors ‚Äî helping them decide whether a spot is a good bet or not before committing to a lease and compare between locations.

I‚Äôm curious:

* Would this kind of tool be useful to you (if you‚Äôre in F&B or even thinking about it)?
* What features would make it most valuable?
* Do you think people would actually pay for this?

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

I think this is driven by a few different factors (in no particular order):

1. Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Our fundamental needs, at least in richer countries, are met for the most part. However, there is a crisis of purpose for many. Fitness can help fill that void.

2. The proliferation of Social Media. We've become inundated with photos and videos of what ""perfect"" bodies should look like. This has fostered a desire in people to try and achieve that for themselves.

3. GLP-1 drugs. Adoption of these drugs will rise rapidly in the years to come. With it will come a desire to ramp up exercise, in order to justify both the results that people are getting from these drugs and their high cost.

4. Protein centric marketing. Starbucks just added protein infused coffee to their menu. ""Protein"" really is the marketing buzzword of the day.

1nwlrmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingAlone/comments/1nwlrmz/the_holidays_are_coming/,The holidays are coming ‚ù§Ô∏è,"Hi you guys! I‚Äôm a 29 year old woman living on my own with my dogs in the Bay Area. I have no friends or family and I just wanted to come on here and shed a bit of light if you‚Äôre navigating things on your own also. I‚Äôve been on my own, almost entirely with no contact with my parents since last June. The holidays are coming and I know it can be triggering for some of us but I wanted to share what it‚Äôs like. I spent the holidays entirely alone last year and as we enter the final quarter of the year, I‚Äôm looking ahead at the same reality for me this season. 

So, what‚Äôs it like? It‚Äôs actually not that bad, lonely, of course, but it‚Äôs not that bad truthfully. I thought I would be in pieces last year when the holidays came. Not a single call or text from anyone. No Christmas gifts to exchange, nothing. I was entirely on my own but I‚Äôm most grateful for that experience because it prepared me for the reality. I am more than happy to open up more and talk about it 1:1 if anyone needs support through the holidays. 

I‚Äôm highly untrusting and distant from other people. I don‚Äôt see other people as comforting to me honestly, I often feel judged and unwelcome in many spaces. Often like I‚Äôm an outsider everywhere I go. I attempted to open up and create a TikTok account last year. I really ramped up my engagement on there this year, after my mom‚Äôs passing, divulging all my business‚Äîall in an effort to be fully transparent and connect with others. I ended up getting a ton of weird vibes from people irl and it made me even more untrusting of others than before. So I retreated and now I don‚Äôt care to really engage with others altogether. Since I am entirely on my own, I have a very difficult time trusting others. Living alone is beautiful, yes, but a reality for some of us living alone is that some of us have no one at all. So anyways, with the holidays coming, I wanted to shed a bit of light because I know it can be emotionally difficult for some of us on our own. 

I have pieces of my life kinda scattered all over my coffee table if you will. I have a piece that doesn‚Äôt find comfort in others, I find the greatest comfort within solitude honestly. I feel so relaxed and all my tension goes away when others are not present. Of course, that‚Äôs not a reality any of us can live in as other people are naturally present within our day-to-day lives but I am. I am deeply introverted. Another piece I have on my coffee table is learning how to lean into other people and feel safer, more trusting of others. It‚Äôs really super hard when you are not figuratively on your own but quite literally on your own. There are days, like today, I just wish I had someone to talk to. There are days, like today, when the world just feels super heavy and I wish I had someone I could trust to just hear me speak. It‚Äôs really hard honestly. 

I‚Äôm so extremely grateful for my life. I am normally a happy, jovial, enthusiastic bubble of energy but lately I have been feeling weighed down by feeling everyone‚Äôs judgement and perception of me. It feels unescapable. In my neighborhood, because of my failed effort to ‚Äúopen up‚Äù, I garnered a lot of people who see me, know of me, but still don‚Äôt want to engage with me so it‚Äôs hard to even feel comfortable at home now. Truthfully, I feel naked in every sense of the word and I actually don‚Äôt mind being naked. I don‚Äôt mind being unfiltered, all the things. I‚Äôm pretty outgoing and happy honestly, but there is no feeling more unsettling than the feeling of being observed and unsupported by others. Nonetheless, this is my reality and I know it‚Äôs the reality for someone else as well.  With the holidays coming, I‚Äôm actually looking forward to it. This will be the first holiday without my mom but I wanted to post this for anyone living alone, who might not be looking forward to the holidays. 

I come from a small family, just my mom, my sister and I. That was it every holiday season and this has always kind of been normal for me. And even with feeling observed and ‚Äúnaked‚Äù in a sense, I still look forward to the holidays because there is so much joy to experience. 

Something that helps me through my days being entirely alone without friends or family, is that I know there are other people like me, even where I live. Please don‚Äôt ever feel alone, some of us are born into small families. Some of us are older and our family members have gone home, for some of us, the cards just worked out that way. 

I‚Äôve worn many different hats over my years and when I was 18 I worked for a nonprofit that helped marginalized communities. I saw so many people struggle with seasonal depression and it was hard to see. I feel blessed in a sense because I have continuously been prepped with the emotional tools to navigate my very reality of being on my own. So anyways, I wanted to send a little bit of happiness your way if you‚Äôre frowning at the thought of the holidays approaching! 

Being on your own during the holidays can indeed feel very lonely. Please, if you‚Äôre someone like me without a partner, without friends or family, don‚Äôt look at the holidays as a bad thing. There is still so much beauty to experience as the seasons change into Fall and eventually winter! Something I want to leave you with is please, and I mean pleaseeeee!!!! Do not compare yourself or your lack of connection to family, romantic interest or friends to anyone else. We are all on this journey called life and all of our stories are unique. Every one of us experiences season‚Äôs of our lives at different times. My failed attempt at ‚Äúopening up‚Äù and divulging myself to others on TikTok may not have created the outcome I wanted and it is okay! Personally, I am still navigating through the grief process of losing my mother on my own (I can help you with that too if anyone is struggling with grief) and it‚Äôs tough going through it alone. If you‚Äôre looking at the holidays coming up with sadness or longing that things were differently for you, please, give yourself grace! Go out and enjoy the holiday festivities! Decorate your home and feel the holiday joy alongside families, couples, friends that partake in the festivities! I still have a ways to go with trusting others and in due time I know things will turn around for me but please, don‚Äôt rob yourself of joy simply because you are alone. Life is beautiful! It is beautiful with the presence of other people, with friends, family, love! And it can also be beautiful without the prescense of any of that as well!

Coffee made me focused and energetic, but it was anxious energy, and it was 50/50 if I gained a benefit out of it, or just had really bad anxiety. 

I stopped drinking coffee immediately when making the decision to start Prozac 6 weeks ago. It killed me a little bit as I love coffee, and am a daily drinker who also works in the food industry around some very high quality coffee, which is free!

The first week was hard, and paired with the initial side effects of severe anxiety from Prozac and caffeine withdrawal/anxiety, I nearly lost my mind. 

2-3 panic attacks and borderline getting admitted into mental health care later and it had been 3 weeks. I was now started to level out a bit, but still felt very strange. 

Then I thought, tea has caffeine, but obviously much less, why don‚Äôt I give it a try?

I got some generic black tea bags, and made some tea with honey and milk, and it basically done nothing for me. 

I was committed to try something else, and opted for some stronger British black tea, that has now become my favourite tea ever. Again with milk and honey, it‚Äôs like having a small weak coffee, but since Prozac affects how your body process caffeine, it lasts a long time, and it significantly boosts my mood and motivation!

Tea also has a very different makeup on its caffeine/delivery than coffee. It‚Äôs obviously much less intense and doesn‚Äôt affect my bowel movements negatively like coffee can. 

So my point is this! 

If you love coffee and gave it up or you are still drinking coffee but having a rough time, switch to a weak black tea and work your way up to a strong black tea and see how you go! It gave me that tiny boost I need to start my day without feeling like I had no energy.

We got married on a Saturday in September in Chicago. Everything went great on our wedding day and we were so happy with all of our vendors. Happy to answer any questions or give you vendor names if you message me!

**Total Budget:** $72k total ($58k wedding, $14k welcome dinner/party)

**Guest Count:** 112 invited, 100 attended (60% out of town guests)

**Venue: $9,894** \- This included the venue, tables, chairs, 1 night access to a 2 bedroom airbnb upstairs at the venue, card box, table numbers, and miscellaneous other props you could use. The venue coordinator was amazing and the space was beautiful, so we did not need much extra decorations.¬†

**Food: $19,574** \- We went with a local caterer with an urban farm. The food included 4 passed apps during cocktail hour and dinner of salad with bread and butter and plated entree (choice of beef, salmon, or pasta) as well as coffee. A family member made all the cakes and mini desserts, so we did not need desserts from the caterer. We also ordered pizza for late night snack, so did not get that from the caterer either. That said, the caterer handled serving of the desserts and pizza. This price also included all plates, silverware, table linens, napkins, dessert trays, etc. The caterer also made dinner menus for every seat, as well as drinks/dessert signage and a card box sign.¬† This was a bit of a splurge, but it was so worth it. The food was great and the service was even better. They took all of our notes into account and executed so well on the day of.¬†

**Alcohol: $6,080** \- This was through our venue. Our venue allowed BYOB, but we ended up using their bar package so we did not have to deal with buying anything ourselves. We splurged for the highest tier and it was essentially a full bar. This included 2 bartenders, all glassware, mixers (you can request specific ones), 6 top shelf liquors, several beers, seltzers, 5 wines, wine service at dinner, full open bar during dinner, and so much more. We had 2 specialty cocktails and 1 mocktail, but they also were able to make pretty much any basic cocktail you could think of (negroni, dirty martini, margarita, etc.). They also had after dinner drinks including cold brew martinis, white russians, bailey‚Äôs, etc. This was another splurge but felt so worth it.¬†

**Dessert: $0** \- A family member made everything.

**Photography: $4,600** \- This included a 2 hour engagement shoot and 8 hours of photos on wedding day. Also included some film in addition to digital. We got a great price for a very experienced photographer.¬†

**Florals: $4,004** \- This included a bridal bouquet, a boutonniere, cake flowers, flat lay flowers, big floral arrangement for the ceremony, bud vases, tea candles, and 5 taper candles per table. We found a small business that does not have any minimums. She was great to work with and everything turned out beautiful. It‚Äôs worth noting that this was the cheapest florist I could find. I was shocked at how expensive flowers are.¬†

**DJ: $3,750** \- This included music for the entire day (pre-ceremony through reception), upgrade to turntables, and 12 uplights. We went with a larger DJ company where you can listen to different DJ‚Äôs mixes and choose the one you want. We were so happy with our decision. He mostly stuck to our playlists for pre-ceremony, cocktail hour and dinner, but the dance floor was a mix of songs we sent and songs he picked. He did an incredible job keeping the dance floor going and everything went smoothly in terms of ceremony and all announcements.¬†

**Stationary: $687** \- Invites and Save the Dates from Minted. Seating chart and place cards designed on Canva then printed at Chicago Printworks (highly recommend). Caterer did the food, bar, and dessert menus. We did not have a welcome sign, program, or any other stationary.¬†

**Day of Coordinator: $2,250** \- The best money we spent. She came in about 3 months out to help build out our timeline and start coordinating with vendors. She ran everything the day of and packed up all our stuff at the end of the night and put it in the airbnb for us, so we did not have to worry about a thing. The day was truly stress free in large part because of her.¬†

**Bride‚Äôs Attire: $4,656** \- Dress was $2,700 and alterations were $1,300. Earrings were $450 and shoes were $130. Veil was $20 off Amazon.

**Groom‚Äôs Attire: $280** \- he wore a tux he already had, but did buy an extra shirt and pocket square. Extra shirt was very necessary as he sweat through the first one by dinner.¬†

**Hair: $420** \- used a large company that did not have any minimums. This included trial and day of updo for bride only. It ended up working out, although my first trial did not go well. Luckily they assigned me a new stylist and let me do a second trial.¬†

**Makeup: $0** \- Bride did make up herself.¬†

**Day of lunch: $500** \- Bride hosted brunch at her apartment. We did not have a wedding party.

**Hotel: $0** \- Stayed at our apartment.

**Late night food: $700** for pizza.

**Welcome Dinner: $10,000** \- We hosted dinner for our families (45 people) at a nice restaurant prior to drinks. This included a very large family style meal with an open bar for 2.5 hours.¬†

**Welcome Drinks: $3,977** \- All guests were invited, but we had about 70 show up. This was in the same place dinner was, but the restaurant was able to flip the room and clear out some tables. Open bar for 2.5 hours. I think this came in cheaper than budget because our families were too full to really drink that much at this point.¬†

**Welcome Drinks Attire: $580** \- $500 dress, $40 shoes and $40 purse. I was hesitant to include this since I know I will rewear everything.

**After Party: $0** \- The week of the wedding we stopped into the dive bar down the street from the venue and asked if they could reserve a few tables for us for after the wedding. They saved tables for about 30 people without any charge and let us bring leftover pizza and dessert into the bar. It could not have worked out better.¬†

After a few months of pondering, and processing your guys advice on my previous post(much appreciated) im moving forward with a more refined(and realistic) game plan focusing on importation and jump starting production on the family farm.

Updates

* Went to LA Coffee Fest.
* Getting quotes from shippers and freight forwarders
* Going to Colombia in a week
* Talk to fam, local farms, and coops, get samples
* Start preparing farm land and plant a couple of hectares
* Planning to go SD World of Coffee

Questions

1. Other than having a farm, and family involved in producing, i don't have any 'connections' to the coffee business.¬† Recommended way to approach local roasters/cafes?
2. What the most important factor when buying for roasters?(certifications, cupping score, price, traceability....etc)
3. What do you typically pay for single origin/lot Colombian coffee?
4. Any horror stories dealing with small importers?",3,1759453504.0,coffee_roasters,0,1.0,False
1nwll13,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1nwll13/transform_your_life_simple_daily_optimizations/,Transform Your Life! üöÄ Simple Daily Optimizations for Massive Growth. ‚ú®üå±üí°,"Hey Maximizame crew,

Ever feel like ""transforming your life"" is this giant, impossible mountain to climb? We see these massive success stories and think we need to make huge, seismic shifts overnight. But honestly, that's a recipe for burnout.

The real magic, the kind that actually sticks, is in the **small, daily optimizations**. It's not about revolution; it's about evolution.

Think about it. Massive growth doesn't come from one giant leap. It comes from hundreds of tiny, consistent steps forward. It's about optimizing the 1% here and there.

What could that look like?

*   **The 5-Minute Morning:** Instead of grabbing your phone first thing, spend just five minutes stretching, journaling one sentence about your day's intention, or just sitting with your coffee in silence.
*   **""Productive Procrastination"":** Waiting for a meeting to start or for the microwave to finish? Instead of scrolling, do 10 squats, read one page of a book, or organize the files on your desktop.
*   **Upgrade Your Commute:** Swap out the radio for an audiobook or a podcast that teaches you something. You're turning dead time into growth time.
*   **Evening Brain Dump:** Before bed, write down everything buzzing in your head on a piece of paper. This simple act can dramatically improve your sleep quality, which is a massive performance enhancer.

It sounds almost *too* simple, right? But these things compound. That 5-minute journal habit builds a foundation of mindfulness. Those 10 squats a day become 3,650 squats a year. You're literally building a new version of yourself, one tiny choice at a time.

Of course, the journey isn't always just about a new habit. Sometimes the biggest block is feeling emotionally stuck or overwhelmed. Building a better life means building emotional resilience, too. Having a structured way to handle those feelings can be a total game-changer. I found that a solid framework, like the one in **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)**, can make a huge difference in staying on track when things get tough.

current rating and review

1. Deathbox

fucking amazing love the synth (coffee machine?) the whole thing is brilliant

2. Fox Holes

had a really crap sounding recording that I've listened to since it was first perfomed live over a year ago, had a big grin whilst listening also Joes scream, enough said

3. Scoundrels

the prechorus is infectious with this one, can see why Will cant wait to play this one live that outro is * chefs kiss

4. Perfect Blue 

love the bass riff and Wills vocals on this

5. Fatal

kinda reminds me of Portrait but better, also throws a really interesting curveball reminicent of Wills solo stuff and Golden Hour

6. Baptism

fantastic opening track, the outro to this one is also fire as fuck

7. Monochrome

a brilliant crescendo to the album, I like the guitars on this one

8. Pay and Display

really catchy tune, should have been the lead single in my opinion, the bridge in this is great and Wills vocals and the guitar riff really stand out

9. Common Touch

love the noisy chorus on this also the mother theresa, theresa line has been stuck in my head for the last couple days

10. White Shark Cafe

Marks drumming and the Guitars are so good here as with the whole album, put this at 10 as I didnt know where else to put it, this album is basically all killer no filler 

11. With Rob As My Witness

I've struggled to understand this song since it released back in june, it makes more sense with P&D and WSC before and after, the chorus is great, but the best bit goes to the breakdown.

honourable mention: Wasted Summer

I can understand why this was taken off the album now, all of the songs are so fucking good, it kinda pales in comparison, not saying its bad its just missing whatever these tracks have

1nwlhrn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nwlhrn,Starbucks Drinkers: Why?,"I was sipping my Nescaf√© Gold Cafe in my office while drowning with endless excel sheets. A thought raced through my head, why do Malaysians even go to Starbucks? I‚Äôm not talking about the person that goes to Starbucks maybe once or twice an every few months to try out their new frappe flavours, but the people who go there on a regular weekly basis.

Let‚Äôs break down the cost. An average Starbucks Latter cost RM16.90. Add another RM1 for Venti. That‚Äôs RM17.90 for a bloody Latte. I work in Australia for about 10 months in the year but come back for 2 months to manage family affairs and business. 

1 AUD = RM2.77 
1 Starbucks coffee = $6.44 AUD

Just for a comparison, an average cup of latte in Australia is $6-$7 AUD

The difference to me in just startling. Even in Australia I save on cost by making my own coffee, and I‚Äôm a huge coffee nerd. I only reserve coffee for a weekend enjoyment when I‚Äôm out with friends. Presuming someone goes to Starbucks twice a week, they‚Äôre spending at least RM34 per week, RM136 a month, RM1632 a year. And that‚Äôs just for mediocre coffee! 

As a point of comparison, if someone spends $6.50 for coffee 5 times a week in Australia, with the same crude calculation, that‚Äôs $32.50 per week, $130 a month, $1560 a year. 

I guess this comes down to my question, Starbucks drinkers, what makes Starbucks attractive to you? Is it the branding, the ambiance, the specialty flavours? Please share because I‚Äôm bored at work after completing my work project üòÇ

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

I've been using both mug warmers and thermoses for years, and I thought I'd share my experience to help others decide which option might work better for them.

I used to be a die-hard thermos fan until I discovered mug warmers. Don't get me wrong - thermoses are great for keeping drinks hot when you're on the move, but they have their limitations. After about 4-6 hours, even the best thermos will let your drink cool down. Plus, once it's cold, you're stuck with it.

That's where I found mug warmers to be game-changing. I got mine from https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer, and it's been a total life-saver for those long work-from-home days. The best part? Your drink stays at the perfect temperature for as long as you want. No more microwaving your coffee five times a day!

Let's break down the main differences:

Portability:
- Thermos: Great for commuting and outdoor activities
- Mug warmer: Better for desk work and home use

Temperature Control:
- Thermos: Gradually loses heat over time
- Mug warmer: Maintains consistent temperature

Convenience:
- Thermos: No power needed, but can't reheat
- Mug warmer: Needs electricity, but provides endless heat

Price-wise, they're pretty comparable. A good thermos costs about the same as a quality mug warmer. I actually ended up getting my mug warmer from https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer during a sale, and it was totally worth it.

What really sold me on the mug warmer was how it changed my daily routine. Instead of rushing to finish my coffee before it gets cold, I can take my time and enjoy it throughout the morning. It's especially great for tea drinkers who like to steep multiple cups from the same leaves.

The only downside I've found with mug warmers is that you need to be near a power source. But for home office or desk work, that's rarely an issue.

Pro tip: If you're like me and want the best of both worlds, use a thermos for commuting and outdoor activities, and keep a mug warmer at your desk. That way, you're covered in any situation!

I've found this combination works perfectly for my lifestyle. The thermos handles my on-the-go needs, while the mug warmer keeps my drinks at the perfect temperature when I'm working or relaxing at home.",1,1759453079.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
1nwlek6,https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/1nwlek6/ios_game_marketing_tips/,iOS game marketing tips?,"Admittedly a lot of the non-development, app outreach related questions here are typically about regular apps rather than games.

Other than trying to optimize ASO, what options are there for getting word out there about an indie game that a solo developer has released? 

I've posted about mine in a few subreddits, a few discord servers, linkedin (lol), and twitter so far.

I got a couple thousand clicks through to the app page in the store the first couple days but it's quickly tapered off, and at this point half my downloads are from promo codes and half are actual purchases (\*). Of course since it's not totally free I'm not expecting tons of acquisitions but I've only gotten about one every other day or so. And at that, maybe half the real purchases are friends refusing a promo code and wanting to buy it to support me lol. So purchases aren't very representative at this point.

I've only got two 5 star ratings and no reviews so far, despite having the in-app Apple prompt to rate/review the game as well at the end of play sessions (up to 3x max per year or whatever the rule is).

For the game's app page I have a trailer app preview and screenshots, it's compatible with iPhones, iPads, and Macs even as a Universal Purchase. Game Center integration. 

Are ads my only choice? 

Again fwiw I'm not expecting it to get popular; it's only my first game and I'm not great at design, so it's not \_super polished\_ but very playable in its current state. I was originally thinking 1-5 purchases a day would be sufficient; just enough to cover the developer program membership and a coffee or two lol.

\* it's a premium game without ads or IAPs at a modest price",1,1759452989.0,iOSProgramming,0,1.0,False

1nwlckq,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMFST/comments/1nwlckq/hockey_season_is_upon_us_again_if_only_we_had_a/,Hockey season is upon us again! If only we had a primer...,"Good evening, gentles and ladymen.

Tyler and Mark.  Last year, I stepped up in the community episode and challenged Tyler to both pick an NHL team and to come up to experience the BAL SAC.  Mark was also challenged to face down the BAL SAC but his poor weak body could not get it up over the San Gabriel Mountains to get to Sacramento, so he must live with that shame for the rest of his days!  Since the season is coming around again, I challenge the sportly duo to pick and cheer for a hockey team this year, as well as provide regular updates on your team's scores and progress through the season!  Tyler picked the Utah Hockey Club last year and may continue with them (Utah Mammoth) this year if he so chooses.  

MARK.  You must select a hockey team with which to give us updates and NEWS from!  Unless you mean to tell me that your level of going even further beyond only amounts to being able to get up and make a cheese sandwich while also leaving one of Amy's coffee mugs in your office!

I throw the gauntlet down at you!",3,1759452835.0,GMFST,2,0.81,False
