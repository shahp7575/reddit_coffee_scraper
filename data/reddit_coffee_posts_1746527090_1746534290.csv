A bit about me:

* Traveling is a big passion of mine. Been to a few places around Europe and the U.S., and I‚Äôm always looking for new destinations. Got any recommendations or crazy travel stories? I‚Äôm all ears!
* Cooking is my other love. Im all about experimenting with new recipes. If it involves Italian food or seafood, count me in.
* I enjoy gardening when the weather is nice. Im growing veggies. Tend to my flowers, and other random plants.
* I‚Äôm all about staying active‚Äîformer personal trainer here. Mostly do weight training now but sneak in some soccer when I can. Got a home gym to keep me motivated!
* I enjoy spending the nice weather outside with my German Shepherd!
* I enjoy messing with my¬†guitar¬†(I‚Äôm ok at best, not consistent playing it). I‚Äôm a sucker for 90s alternative, classic rock, and the good ol' 00s emo vibes.

I (late 20s M) recently cut ties with a friend ‚Äî I‚Äôll call him George ‚Äî and I‚Äôm starting to question whether I handled it the right way, or if I‚Äôm being too sensitive.

George and I met through my university‚Äôs library and got along quickly. I eventually opened up to him about some really personal stuff ‚Äî childhood bullying, family issues, and mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts. At the time, I felt I could trust him.

Things shifted when he brought me to his church group. I liked it at first, but then he and his brother started pushing political conversations ‚Äî mostly pro-Trump stuff ‚Äî even after I told them I wasn‚Äôt comfortable discussing politics. George kept pressing me, asking if my views were just ‚Äúinherited from my dad,‚Äù and wouldn‚Äôt drop it even when I said I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it.

I told him his behavior was making me uncomfortable and that I wanted an apology. Instead of addressing it, he refused to apologize over text and told me the friendship was basically over unless we met in person. I still agreed to meet and even bought him a coffee, hoping to smooth things over. Instead of apologizing, he told me I had low self-esteem, that I was dragging him down to my level, and that I was ‚Äúsounding like the devil.‚Äù He also tried to pray over me, which I declined. I left feeling belittled and humiliated, so I walked away and ended the friendship.

Since then, I‚Äôve distanced myself from the church group and anyone connected to him. But here‚Äôs where it gets more uncomfortable: I saw him at the library yesterday. When I got up from my seat, I noticed he was sitting two rows ahead of me, with his back to me. Later, after I came back from getting a drink of water, I saw that he‚Äôd moved a couple rows forward ‚Äî this time directly facing me. It felt really unsettling.

His brother also randomly removed me on Social Media, and George has been acting like nothing happened ‚Äî giving me fist bumps and being overly friendly in public. A couple of his friends have reached out, but I haven‚Äôt said much ‚Äî just that I‚Äôve been busy.

Now I‚Äôm anxious that he might be sharing the personal things I confided in him, especially the mental health stuff, and trying to make me look unstable or dramatic. I feel like I‚Äôve lost control of the narrative, and it‚Äôs really messing with my head.

We don't argue that much and we always make sure to always communicate. It's just weird kasi di nya ako pinopost on my birthday, not even on our anniversary. 

The other day,  napatingin ako sa BF ko na tahimik lang, busy sa work niya. Bigla ko siyang tinanong, ‚ÄúBabe, bakit never ka nagpo-post about sakin? Or about us?‚Äù

Tumingin siya sakin at sabi niya with a gentle voice, ‚ÄúDi naman ako mahilig sa social media, tsaka pinapakita ko naman love ko sayo in real life.‚Äù

One time, I was laid off bigla with my client sa work and was having a really bad day. I was upset all day and then after he went out to do some grocery he told me ""Dinalhan kita ng paborito mong kape. Roadtrip tayo papunta beach. Sagot ko na lahat.""

In that moment, alam ko na ang sagot sa mga tanong ko.

That was his version of a post about me.  
That was his love letter.   
Not written in a caption, but handed to me in a cup of coffee (and a sponty beach trip)

Quiet. Consistent. Unseen by anyone else but me.  
  
It‚Äôs the way he never let me wear my helmet on my own.  
The way he cooked  my favorite meals for me.  
The way he voluntarily do the laundry, wash the dishes, and gives me a massage after work.

I used to feel almost unloved because he hadn‚Äôt posted about me in years. 

Ngayon, alam ko na kung bakit.  
  
His love isn‚Äôt loud.  
It‚Äôs not performative.  
It‚Äôs not meant for the internet.

Its quiet.  
It‚Äôs not flashy.   
It's not a cheezy Facebook post or IG Story  
It‚Äôs not for anyone else to see, it‚Äôs just for me.

It‚Äôs found in the small, quiet ways they know you.

The ways no one else even notices.

1kg2yuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AddisonsDisease/comments/1kg2yuw/morning_routine_thats_finally_working_after_20/,Morning Routine That's Finally Working - After 20+ Years With Addison's,"Hi,

Long time Addison's sufferer (20+ years). I also have ADHD symptoms.

Having struggled enormously getting up in the mornings for a long time, due to a combination of exhaustion, and decision paralysis / poor executive function - I thought I would share the routine that works best for me.

As you probably know - *stable blood sugar levels* are important with Addison's. If I go to bed on an empty stomach, there's a good chance I'll wake up exhausted or hit a wall. I've had this happen *too many times* to count.

Its harder for us to wake up anyway - cortisol doesn't hit our systems until we've taken our medication and its had time to work. (This will depend on your type of Addison's of course, your type of replacement therapy,  and whether your body still produces some - mine doesn't)

Prednisolone has a longer duration - but takes longer to absorb than hydrocortisone - so if you take it at, e.g. 7am - you likely won't feel its effects till around 8am or later.

The Routine:

It starts the day before:

1. A Late night snack. (Slow-release, healthy). I have a Nairn's wholemeal oat cookie , with a bit of peanut butter.  I    put a tiny bit of salt on it. Its the very last thing I do before brushing my teeth and bed.

This snack will slowly digest overnight, and keep your blood sugar up till the morning.

Its common for us to need a bit more salt average, to feel better.  I used to meet that need in an unhealthy way by craving crisps - now I just add a bit more consciously

Caveat - you still need to be mindful you don't have TOO much salt. I'm talking a small amount.

2. Alarm for 8am.

3. Small fridge right next to my bed. Inside:

* All my pills in a pill box, for each day of the month.
* Fresh Milk
* Plain oat cookies in it.

4. Cheap filter coffee machine with a timer (¬£40) on top of the fridge, with an empty mug next to it:

So when I wake, I am \*invited\* out of bed with the smell of hot coffee, and the lure of an oat cookie - rather         than beaten out by the unpleasantness of exhaustion, an alarm, and another work day.

Why its working:

* The oat cookie and peanut butter before bed, has made me consistently more energised in the morning. (I don't feel so 'dead to the world').
* Because the cookie and pills are *right there*, I don't have to think - I don't get decision paralysis- I immediately get a coating of food in my stomach, and my prednisolone.
* Because its *right there* I'm not relying on memory or willpower. *I won't forget*. This means - 1 hour after taking it, the cortisol is kicking in, and I start to feel like a normal person would.

Just sharing in case it helps anyone!

Caveats:

\-I'm not a doctor - always speak to a doctor first, - and always EDUCATE yourself on your condition. The more you know, the better prepared you are to deal with what your body goes through.

\-This routine works for me , you need to figure out what works *for you.*",2,1746533733.0,AddisonsDisease,0,1.0,False

She didn‚Äôt truly come back but here‚Äôs the story. I was 25 she 31. We dated for about 10 months but I felt like she was the love of my life. Had so much in common, could talk for hours, enjoyed each other‚Äôs friend. It felt perfect. Too good to be true, I guess so. We were long distance so that was a problem. Come to think, there were many problems. She definitely brought the anxiety out of me and she tended to be avoidant. There were many ‚Äúphantom exes‚Äù I had to hear about too often even when I said it made me uncomfortable. I tried to work on my self confidence and not let it bug me but based on what she said and the way she acted I left compared against her past lovers

It all ended 10/2023. I made plans to see her bought plane tickets but she blind sided me over the phone. Like that our relationship was over. I went immediately no contact. She texted me a few weeks later saying she didn‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúghosted‚Äù. I broken down and called her and we talked for 2 hours. It felt great to hear her voice but she reiterated that it was over. Despite all the wonderful qualities she didn‚Äôt want to continue the relationship. Never gave concrete reasons. I went back into no contact.

Jump to 7/2024. I did strict no reaching out but still had her on my socials. I would rarely look at her posts, I had good discipline but some slip ups hurt so much to see her so happy without me. I loved that she was happy but sad that it made her happy to have me out of her life. Around my birthday I reached out for a friendly texts and we spoke a bit. She wished me a late happy birthday and I didn‚Äôt respond. After that I knew I need to go full no contact so I removed and blocked all socials. Everything but email and phone.

Jump to 5/2025. I get a text, I see her name. Such a strange feeling. Spent so much time trying to forget and I actually somehow did. I‚Äôve dated around since then and moved on mostly. But there was her text. She said ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm in town visiting my boyfriend‚Äôs friends, do you want to get coffee or go on a walk‚Äù? I was so busy living my life I didn‚Äôt see the message until Monday morning. I texted back ‚Äú omg, I just saw this, are you still in town?‚Äù Replied no, sorry I missed you ‚Äú 

Left it at that. I go so emotional ready she had a new boyfriend. It figures. I just know she most like has not changed and talked about me the old ex to her new boyfriend. It would make me uncomfortable for her to meet up with exes so I didn‚Äôt not want to be the meet up ex in this situation.

TLDR
Long story short, no contact is a journey and Ive not been perfect and the joy at the end of it not caring about who your ex is dating but truly  wishing her well and living life to the fullest",1,1746533562.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

It was a rather gloomy day for me since I had lessons until 6, but I didn't understand anything the teacher was going thru in tutorial because I missed so many lessons because I was on leave for a school event. by the time the day was over, i was a living corpse and people walking past me would think that this lil bro had a massive aura loss moment.

On the way back I grabbed a cup of coffee from macs because there was the one dollar deal and planned to head home to sleep immediately. My hair was messy, my acne was all over the place, my eyes had dark spots. I was famished, and all that came to my mind was lirili larila.

6.30pm

just as I took another sip of my ballerina cappuccina, a group of girls (wearing dressed-down attire) from XX secondary school waved at me. I stared at them for a moment. I did not recognize any of them. They said hi. I just stared back in awe.

One of them went up with her black iphone and immediately captured a shot of me before I could even react, i was like wth bro is this a dare or something. And then the both of us just looked at each other awkwardly for 3 seconds before I walked away w a rbf. I looked down to see if there was anything off, before scanning my face to see if there are any stains or smudges. No there weren't any.

The girl who did this probably felt second-hand embarrassment doing this, after I gave her the tspmo look. I, on the other hand, felt a surge of gusto, knowing I had accomplished a feat no other virgin could claim, the first time I successfully rizzed someone in what felt like an eternity. I was the glorious king... the Hokage of Rizzu, standing proud in my own Hidden Village of W's.

Sadly, I never turned back, as I was still processing all the events that had led up to this unnerving moment.

kiss of a life time ALLISON

""No, I don't want to go out"" I whined and covered the duvet all over my body but once again Ruby hauled it away.

""Shut up girl and get your ass off the bed, we are going out. You have been indoors for far too long"" she said and walked to my wardrobe.

""Girl, you need clothes. What are these?""¬†

""Get out from there Ruby. Just go to the club without me"" I cried more.

""That club isn't the type of club you go to every day. This is a legit place with lots of money, you don't get to mingle with the rich every day. I'm not letting you miss out on this opportunity"" she said adamantly and kept going through my clothes.

""Moreover, you can get a good guy you can screw over there, not just any guy but one with the dough...""

""yes, this cloth is perfect"" she screamed.

""Ruby...."" I called.

""No buts, we are leaving for that club now,"" she said and I gave up.

Talking to Ruby was a waste of time on my part, she already made up her mind and it was either I followed her or I won't sleep.

I got up slowly from the bed and went into the bathroom to take my bath.

I'm Allison Mason, I live alone in my apartment and I work at a coffee shop. I hate my job, don't think I like it one bit, but it was a means to an end. I just had to cope with it till I have gotten to where I wanted.

I'm 25years old and no I don't have a boyfriend. So far, I believe men are never worth loving, they were selfish and wicked and I would never imagine being in any form of relationship with them. I could flirt and have s\*x with them, then I would drop them like they were nothing and we would all go our separate ways after getting what we wanted.

I finished taking my bath and stepped out of the bathroom, Ruby was sitting with my cloth in her hands. She was so impatient.

I wasn't feeling like going out, I needed a break, but again, Ruby was not going to let me stay home.

I applied lotion on my body and brushed my hair before putting on the cloth she brought out for me.

""What is this? I'm not wearing a gown,"" I said adamantly when I saw the gown she had picked out. It was a black gown with lots of openings with a strapless hand, and a v\_shape opening at the back and front. I got the gown months ago and have never really worn it since I got it.

""You need to look classy and fine. It's not that bad, put it on"" she commanded. I sighed and took the clothes from her.

When I wore the gown, it was indeed beautiful, it hugged my body and exposed my tiny curves.

""That's it baby girl"" she shrieked at my appearance and tossed my heels over to me. I wore it and picked up a marching purse, then I applied just a little amount of makeup and we both left the house, boarding a cab and straight to the club, she didn't stop ranting about.

When we got there, I knew immediately that it wasn't a place for us. It was for the wealthy, influential, and famous.

""Hey, are you sure we got an invite here?"" I quickly asked Ruby as we walked into the place. I didn't want any form of embarrassment and I would have gladly turned back to my house.

""Yes, I met a rich guy and he gave me an invite. We are going to be fine"" she whispered and pulled me along to the door.

The guards and security asked us so many questions before we were permitted to go in, it was irritating, especially with how they looked at us. Like we were some trash wrapped in a pretty dress, at a place where we shouldn't be.

""Ruby, you made it,"" a man said coming out from the club. The guards immediately gave way and allowed us in. Money spoke volumes, lots of volumes.

""Hi, am Michael"" he introduced himself to me and stretched his hand towards me.

""I'm Allison,"" I said loudly against the music, giving him my hands.

""It's my pleasure, you are very beautiful,"" he said and raised my hands to his lips and kissed them.

I smirked at his approach, such a Playboy.

I smiled at him and withdrew my hands. Then he turned around and led the way into the hall.

When I got in there, I was suddenly very happy for wearing what I wore. The people in there were filthy rich, their clothes were classy and they looked flawless. I knew I didn't belong in that league of people and it made me feel so uncomfortable, what would have been worse was if I had looked different.

He took us to the place he sat with his friends. They were all with girls and drinks and stripers and drugs. We got introduced to everyone and I took my seat, ordered a drink, and nodded my head to the music with my phone in my hands. I wasn't doing much with the phone but it kept me busy since Ruby was busy with Michael and the others had people they were occupied with already. I went through my phone, sipping my drink which wasn't so strong. I had to take something with less alcohol, I had a feeling, Rubby would follow Michael home and I needed a clear head to get home by myself.

People were dancing and rocking and smooching, strippers did their jobs and so did the others. I remained seated when a waiter came with a glass of what I was already having.

""I didn't order for that"" I screamed, again, the music was loud

""Yes, you didn't. But a man there asked me to give it to you"" he replied me pointing in a particular direction but I couldn't see anybody.

""Please return the drink, I'm done here"" I yelled and got up from my seat. I was tired of sitting still and the songs were already getting to me. I gulped down the last of my drink and stepped gently onto the dance floor.

I jumped, danced, moved, and whined my sexy waist to myself without getting interrupted. I wasn't looking for that anyway so it was fun for me before I felt someone behind me, and hands wrapped around my waist. I stopped immediately and felt irritated, I mean, who gave him the right to touch me?

I took his hands off my waist and turned to face him and maybe shout at whoever it was. My eyes met his perfect eyes, he had amusement in his eyes and it got me worked up. I was going to talk or shout at him but I just walked away from him.

""Excuse me, wait up,"" he said drawing me by my arms. I hated that touch, he kept touching me like he owned my body. I looked down at his hands, at where it held mine and he could tell I didn't like it.

""Don't act like such a saint"" he simply said and removed his hands from my arms. His voice sounded so proud and pompous.

I didn't give him a reply, I wasn't sure talking to such people was a reasonable idea, I was pissed as it was already. I just walked back to where I was sitting.

""Playing hard to get huh? he screamed above the music.

""You can't resist me all too long, you are just like the others sweetheart.."" he screamed and I paused in my tracks. But I wasn't going to show that what he said got to me, he was a Playboy who saw women as nothing, I was a Playgirl. Two could play that game.

I turned around and smiled at him with my hands to my waist. I could feel eyes on us, we were standing far from each other and his shouting had got people's attention and I could bet they all wanted to know what was happening. I felt my heart beating fast as more eyes kept staring at us, then the music went down to my surprise. Whatever I had to say, they would all hear me and my nerves didn't like much attention.",1,1746533223.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

1kg2rlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/atlanticdiscussions/comments/1kg2rlt/breakfast_is_breaking/,Breakfast Is Breaking,"By Yasmin Tayag

In the morning weekday rush, any breakfast will suffice. A bowl of cereal, buttered toast, yogurt with granola‚Äîmaybe avocado toast, if you‚Äôre feeling fancy. But when there‚Äôs time for something heartier, nothing satisfies like the classic American breakfast plate, soothing for both stomach and soul. No matter where you get the meal‚Äîat home, a diner, a local brunch spot‚Äîit‚Äôs pleasingly consistent in form and price: eggs, toast, potatoes, and some kind of salty, reddish meat, with orange juice and coffee on the side. Pancakes, if you‚Äôre really hungry. If you‚Äôre craving a filling, greasy, and relatively cheap meal, look no further than an all-American breakfast.
The classic breakfast hasn‚Äôt changed in roughly a century. A Los Angeles breakfast menu from the 1930s closely resembles that of my neighborhood greasy spoon in New York; diners from Pittsburgh to Portland offer up pretty much the same plate. The meal‚Äôs long-lived uniformity‚Äîso rare as food habits have moved from meatloaf and Jell-O cake to banh mi and panettone‚Äîwas made possible by abundance: Each of its ingredients has long been accessible and affordable in the United States.

But lately, breakfast diehards like me have noticed a troubling change. At my neighborhood diner, a breakfast plate that cost $11.50 in 2020 now costs $14‚Äîand it isn‚Äôt just because of inflation. Although all kinds of food have gotten more expensive in recent years, traditional breakfast has had a particularly rough go of it. The cost of eggs has soared; supply shortages have driven coffee and orange-juice prices to historic highs. And that‚Äôs not even taking President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs into account. ‚ÄúMilk, sausage, certainly not coffee‚Äîthese things are not going to get cheaper,‚Äù Jason Miller, a supply-chain-management professor at Michigan State University who researches the impact of tariffs, told me. The stream of staples that have made American breakfast so cheap for so long is now starting to sputter.

Breakfast can symbolize an entire nation: the full English, the French omelet, Belgian waffles. In many ways, America‚Äôs plate chronicles the nation‚Äôs history. Reverence for bacon and eggs was partly inherited from the English; a vigorous public-relations campaign later cemented its popularity. In the 18th century, the Boston Tea Party helped tip the nation permanently toward coffee, and Scotch-Irish settlers kick-started American potato growing in New Hampshire. With the Industrial Revolution, access to these and other breakfast foods exploded: Bacon was packed onto trains carrying mass-produced eggs, milk, and potatoes across the country. In 1945, the invention of frozen concentrated orange juice gave all Americans a taste of Florida.
But if breakfast was once a story of American innovation and plenty, it is now something different. No food captures the changes better than eggs.
...
Some elements of the breakfast plate are safe‚Äîfor now. America is a grain-producing powerhouse, so foods such as toast, pancakes, and waffles aren‚Äôt expected to become wildly pricey. Bacon and sausage will probably be fine too; if China stops importing U.S. pork as a result of the trade war, there will be an even bigger supply at home, Miller said. A tariff-ridden future could shift more homegrown foods onto the breakfast plate: sausage and pancakes, ham and toast, with a glass of milk to wash it down. Of course, people eat plenty of other foods for breakfast, and these alternatives may just become more popular: Greek yogurt, oatmeal, cereal. Still, a crucial part of breakfast that can‚Äôt be overlooked is the cookware used to make it. The majority of America‚Äôs toasters, microwaves, coffee makers, juicers, and pans come from China, which currently faces a 145 percent tariff.

A person I did start speaking to someone over Christmas, met up with him earlier this year which was great, and when we were planning a second meet, I was trying to compartmentalise some personal issues I was having, to not let them impact this new situationship. Personal matters like my new work manager telling me he thought I wasn't working hard enough, telling me he didn't like my processes etc while I was drowning in overwhelm at the volume of work, and the same time as family blaming me for something that never happened (I believe it was them lashing out because they are unhappy with other aspects of their life and I was an easy target to channel that unhappiness against- theres a lot of sibling child trauma here). Anyway, the point is, he was texting me dirty talk, but said something that I responded negatively to, as I felt it was dehumanising. I pulled him up on it, and he realised and corrected. I unfortunately, in my defensiveness (exacerbated by personal issues and attacks i was getting), doubled down, and said, we never actually talk about anything non sexual (not strictly true) and he went weird, saying he needed me to tell him what he expected from this and he didn't want to meet anymore and to take some time. I accepted this, told him I was feeling weird too and was having personal issues I had let impact me, and was taking a break for a few weeks, and if he wanted to have a coffee in the future when I was ready, lets do that, but no pressure. He said he'd love that and thanks for the context. 

  
Fast forward a few weeks, and I reached out for that coffee, he said he'd love to meet me, and when i tried to arrange it, he went silent, he was heading out of the city, so I figured there was no time - totally fine. A few days later, he reaches out, says sorry, timings went to shit, he's been thinking about me. We lightly flirted a bit, he said he's excited to see me again (i didn't try to set a new date, (was he expecting me to?), but then neither has he) and now we haven't spoken for nearly a month. 

  
Generally speaking, I feel fine about all of this, what I am doing and looking for is casual. What I am now thinking though, is whether I should accept that I asked for coffee, he said yes, but when I tried to arrange it, he went silent, and hasn't tried to arrange with me back, should I take that as we're done? Or should I try one more time? I am quite sure this man is emotionally avoidant (fine, pretty much every guy I have been with is, but he might be THE most avoidant I have ever come across). Is the silence message enough, or should I try once more, I don't want to pressure him if he doesn't want to, and I want to maintain some dignity and self-respect here. (Can you sense the rumination and people pleasing tendencies I am battling with? üòÇ)

  
Maybe he's just not that into me? What would you do?",2,1746532905.0,nonmonogamy,1,1.0,False

We see each other about 1.5 weekends a month. How to know whether it's... not going to resolve itself? Even though our relationship is great otherwise?","My boyfriend is sweet as pie. We've been together since high school‚Äîboarding school, so different hometowns‚Äîand survived all through college, covid, all of it. I was hoping at the end of it all that we'd finally live in the same place.

However, it's been about a year since our graduation, and he still hasn't moved to the same place as me (I live in a smallish college city, whereas he lives in a very rural area with no jobs for either of us, really). He's in a major that's been really hard-hit by recent economic circumstances (cs) and it is TOUGH out there, in his defense. But I just moved to the city and got a regular job working at a coffee shop before finding my current one‚ÄîI don't understand why he can't do the same, par his mental health issues (depression, anxiety) as well as an agreement he has with his parents to get a ""real"" job (which seems both nonconstructive at best, actively detrimental at worst, but they do have financial power over him, so). 

In my city most people move in Sept. 1, which means that the more time he takes, the harder and harder it will be to find a relatively inexpensive place... and I haven't seen him work much at it, either. He's also discussed living in other cities, which might be good in terms of him finding a job and a place, but doesn't fix our situation (it might actually make it worse).

Not only that, but since he lives in a place that's further to get to than than how it was in college. So I see him even less than I did in college. And since I have a full-time job now, my days are literally longer than before, which just makes me miss him worse, except I don't have the ""just make it 'til graduation"" to comfort me like it did before. And it's really, really hard.

Other than that, our relationship is solid. He's my rock. He's incredibly intelligent, so sweet, and quite nice to look at if I do say so myself. He's strong where I am weak and vice versa. He can read me like a book and he knows me better than I know myself sometimes. The intimacy is fantastic and I can hardly imagine somebody who fits so well with me on so many fronts. If we were to not be together, I'd be beyond fucked over emotionally. I love him to pieces. But it's getting really, really hard for me to miss him this badly with no idea whether there will be any sort of payoff or resolution. 

My friend said that maybe if we break up it will compel him to action, but I know him well enough to know that'd it'd just destroy him and he wouldn't be able to do much of anything (I am the same).

If anybody has advice or has gone through similar situations I'd appreciate it.",1,1746532816.0,LongDistance,0,1.0,False

During the early hours of the morning, as moonlight filtered through her bedroom window, Gauri slept in her lovely comfortable bed. She was exhausted after working a shift at her part-time job.

In the middle of a regular dream she began to feel nervous as her old dream consumed her peaceful sleep. She tried to move her arms and legs, but it seemed as if they were paralyzed. She was sweating and breathing hard, slipping further into a panic attack. She kept trying to wake herself up from her recurring nightmare, but she could never manage to do it. The longer the dream went on the scared she became.

Suddenly, she sat up in bed with a jolt, waking from her nightmare hyperventilating due to the fear racing through her veins. She wiped the sweat from her forehead as she looked around her room. It was empty, there was no one else there. She was all alone in this studio apartment, just like an orphan. She had no one who could wake her from her nightmares or tell her that everything was okay. She drew her knees up to her chest then wrapped her arms tightly around them. She sat in her empty apartment like that for a while. It was becoming a daily occurrence, the nightmares, which was why tears did not fall from her eyes.

It was 4am. She knew she would not be able to get back to sleep after her nightmare, so she got up and went over to her desk. She opened her notebook and textbooks so that she could work on her studies. She was trying hard to focus on her coursework so that she could forget her nightmares, but it kept replaying over and over again in her mind. She got up from her chair and went to the bathroom and looked at herself in the mirror while brushing her teeth and washing her face.

She finally felt a bit more refreshed and went to the kitchen to make herself a cup of coffee, then back to her studies again. She was fully focused on her studies now, trying to understand debits and credits.

She glanced over at the clock and realized it was 6am. So she closed her books and notebook then stepped out onto her balcony. She yawned as she took in the sun shining through the clouds in a beautiful way, it would be a good day. She smiled, everything felt too good to be true.

A cool breeze brushed against her face and blew her hair around, the sound of the birds chirping echoed in her ears, livening up the morning. She closed her eyes as she felt the wind. The cool morning air was always invigorating.

She took a deep breath, filling her lunges with the cold air before returning inside after enjoying the beautiful view. She figured that she should take a bath first, then she would make herself some breakfast. She took a shower then came out of the bathroom wearing a towel.",1,1746532802.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

The sun climbed steadily over Ashandar Village, casting sharp golden beams across the now-clean fields, the sugary remnants of Khanzada‚Äôs colossal prank finally rinsed away. I, sentinel, stood at the northern perimeter, my armored plating warm under the direct sunlight. My internal thermals reported a consistent 87¬∞F on my outer hull, with full systems operational. Vanguard stood just to my left, idle at 0 mph, still recovering from being briefly turned into a sticky chocolate sculpture. Brick was parked behind us on the gravel path, his engine off but his lights active as he ran minor diagnostics. Ghostrider soared above at 400 feet, maintaining 120 mph in a high-visibility patrol arc, while Reaper cruised at 200 feet and 110 mph. Striker held a hover at 180 feet and 95 mph. Titan was scanning a nearby ravine at 15 mph, flanked closely by Bulldog, who thundered along the trail at 30 mph. Khanzada walked beside Titan, his hooves gently thudding against the earth at a calm 5 mph, his tone serious and his presence‚Äîstill somehow‚Äîintimidating after everything that had happened.

Connor was crouched beside me, wiping leftover syrup off a field monitor screen with a military-grade rag. He wore a fresh uniform and looked considerably more awake than he had earlier. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think the smell of cinnamon rolls would be nice until you live inside one,‚Äù he muttered.

At exactly 12:13 PM, I detected something on long-range seismic sensors‚Äîtremors. Very specific tremors. Large. Rhythmic. Controlled.

Connor squinted toward the northeast, shielding his eyes. ‚ÄúWe got something big coming, boys.‚Äù

Khanzada turned toward the same direction and sniffed the wind. ‚ÄúMetal. Heavy. Friend.‚Äù

At 12:16 PM, visual confirmation was achieved. Approaching from the horizon was a large armored silhouette‚Äîlow, wide, with a box-shaped launch module on its rear deck. I focused my sensors, calculating weight and movement.

Tracked vehicle. M270A2. Armored American multiple launch rocket system. Speed: 35 mph. Direction: inbound. Identification code: Artemis. 

His camo was desert tan with a matte finish, and his front end was reinforced with a secondary armored plate. A small American flag was painted beside his left viewport. His launcher housing was closed but freshly cleaned, the rails underneath showing signs of recent system checks. He came to a gradual stop 20 feet from us and shut his engine down.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to join up,‚Äù Artemis said with a voice deep and steady, like distant thunder. ‚ÄúName‚Äôs Artemis. M270A2, 52 tons of mobile precision fire. I heard you‚Äôve been shaking the world out here.‚Äù

Connor raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúThat your real name?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure is,‚Äù Artemis replied. ‚ÄúCommand called me that because I light up the sky.‚Äù

Khanzada grinned. ‚ÄúHe is worthy.‚Äù

Brick rolled forward 2 mph and whistled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a big boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI carry twelve precision-guided M31A2 rockets at a time,‚Äù Artemis said proudly. ‚ÄúAnd two ATACMS when the gloves come off. I don‚Äôt miss.‚Äù

Striker hovered slightly lower, speaking through comms, ‚ÄúWe could definitely use someone with long-range punch. What‚Äôs your system calibration cycle?‚Äù

‚ÄúFully auto-checked every four hours,‚Äù Artemis responded. ‚ÄúI got digital fire control, GPS-INS guidance, and the kind of software that could calculate wind drift before you blink.‚Äù

Reaper flew in closer, his engines humming. ‚ÄúYou got the spirit of an old-school operator. You fight for freedom?‚Äù

Artemis‚Äôs voice dropped slightly. ‚ÄúEvery breath.‚Äù

At 12:30 PM, I logged him into our team network, and he synced perfectly with our battlefield systems. His digital signature was strong, his command protocols aligned with ours, and his friendly-fire prevention logic passed my encryption barrier without incident.

Connor crossed his arms. ‚ÄúAlright, Artemis. Welcome to the team. We run tight formations, keep visual contact at all times, and cover each other at every turn. We operate as one.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou got it, chief,‚Äù Artemis said. ‚ÄúWherever you go, I‚Äôll roll right beside you.‚Äù

At 1:03 PM, Artemis tested his treads, moving to position beside Brick at exactly 8 mph, his launcher shifting slightly in calibration mode. His internal targeting screen flashed green. His cooling vents hissed softly.

Khanzada walked over to him and gave a firm nod. ‚ÄúWe have strength. Now we have thunder.‚Äù

‚ÄúMuch obliged,‚Äù Artemis answered.

From then until 6:00 PM, we ran joint coordination drills. Artemis adjusted to formation maneuvering quickly. I logged his average acceleration rate at 0‚Äì20 mph in 8.2 seconds. His turning radius was tighter than expected for a vehicle of his size‚Äî26 feet flat pivot. He could stop on a dime, and his target-lock confirmation time was 2.3 seconds per coordinate.

Brick whispered to me via comms, ‚ÄúI like this guy.‚Äù

At 7:45 PM, we ran a mock fire scenario. Artemis raised his launcher at a 45-degree angle but did not arm it. He aimed at a simulated target 15 kilometers north. His mock signal burst hit the exact center of the virtual structure in 3.4 seconds.

Titan, who‚Äôd been silent most of the day, finally spoke. ‚ÄúHe hits hard. We‚Äôre going to need that.‚Äù

Connor, now seated on a crate with a cup of black coffee in one hand and a chocolate-stained towel in the other, looked up at the star-filled sky. ‚ÄúWith this crew,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwe could hold off anything.‚Äù

Khanzada nodded solemnly. ‚ÄúWe are now complete.‚Äù

I agreed.

At 11:59 PM, Artemis settled beside Bulldog, shutting his systems down to low-power mode. The night air cooled around us, drifting at a soft breeze of 5 mph. The fields of Ashandar slept again under our unified watch. And for the first time, the thunder of freedom had taken its place beside us.",2,1746532138.0,humansarespaceorcs,1,1.0,False

My dad is turning 70 and I need a great birthday gift for him.  He's not rich, but he has enough money to buy pretty much anything he wants or needs, which makes it difficult to give him gifts.  He's retired and spend a lot of time traveling.  I live in a different country, which means that I can't do a ""spending time together"" type of gift.  Plus we recently did a whole family vacation as a retirement celebration for my parents.  

I'd love to get him something nostalgic, meaningful, sentimental, etc.  But I just don't have any ideas.  

Some things to know:

* Hobbies and interests include travel, theatre, reading, good food, family.  
* Recently bought a second house in another city
* He's trying to stay fit and active in his retirement.
* He has specific design aesthetics, so any home decor (i.e. family portraits) are tough--plus he already has a gallery wall and digital picture frame.  
* He has games and puzzles, TVs, headphones, Kindle, all of those kinds of things
* He drinks earl grey tea every morning--no coffee
* Drinks some alcohol, but he isn't particularly interested in it
* Doesn't eat a lot of sweets
* Subscriptions are tough because of his 2 homes and travel schedule
* We've gotten him activity books, personalized puzzles, and many of the other suggestions I've seen on here before.  We also just made a personalized photo montage as a retirement gift.

Thanks for your help!  I'm really struggling for a good idea.

This travel case is impressively compact, measuring just 6.69""D x 3.74""W x 11.22""H, all while feeling sturdy without being bulky. The matte-finished exterior not only gives it a sleek and minimalist look but also makes it easy to clean.

**User-Friendly Features**  
The thoughtful design of this case is hard to miss. Honestly, my favorite part is the double-head zipper. It slides smoothly, doesn't get stuck, and feels durable, offering easy access to the contents inside. The internal layout is equally impressive, designed to hold one portable coffee machine along with storage slots for up to four coffee capsules and a powder bin. A small mesh pocket houses loose accessories like cleaning brushes or charging cables, which helps keep everything organized.

During a recent weekend camping trip, it proved its worth tenfold. The waterproof and moisture-proof materials ensured the contents stayed protected under humid conditions. Cleaning it was hassle-free too‚Äîjust a quick wipe with a damp cloth did the trick. No chemical cleaners needed!  

**Upsides**  
- Tailored fit for nano-sized coffee machines.  
- Sturdy, anti-wear, and anti-pressure materials.  
- Organized storage space for capsules and accessories.    

**Negative Attributes**  
- The bag doesn‚Äôt include the espresso machine, which some might overlook expecting a bundled product.  
- Limited size‚Äîlarger machines won‚Äôt fit, restricting it to specific models.  

**Competitive Options**  
Other travel cases for portable coffee machines, like the GoBrewing Kit or CoffeeJunkie's Travel Companion, are strong competitors to this bag, each with its pros and cons. GoBrewing offers additional padding for extreme sports enthusiasts, but I found it bulkier than necessary for everyday use. On the other hand, CoffeeJunkie's case features elastic loops to keep capsules in place; however, its zippers feel oddly flimsy compared to the smooth, durable ones on this OutIn bag.

Where this carrying case scores high is its all-in-one feature set and robust design that doesn‚Äôt compromise portability. It strikes a perfect balance between compactness, usability, and protection, making it stand out in the travel accessory market.

**Smart Spending**  
Is it worth the investment? Absolutely, if you value durability, sleek design, and tailored organization for your portable coffee machine setup. While it takes a minor hit for not accommodating larger machines, it's undeniably a solid purchase for frequent travelers and coffee aficionados. Considering the other options in its class, this feels like a smart spend for what it offers.

There are 4 of us currently living in a house and one of them is very social. When it all started I was promised by my flat mate X that he and his buddy would split the hosting, be responsible for cleaning before and after, keep the noise down so we don't have trouble with the neighbors and have them out of the house before 9pm. I agreed and told them, you do you. Have fun. I wasn't going to have any part of it as I don't drink, dislike drunk people, am a light sleeper and  have to get up at 6am the next day to catch a train. All these factors were discussed already before hand and I admit, I have a soft spot for X so I let him do what makes him happy. 

Lo and behold, as any AITA story goes, that was a mistake. None of what was promised happened. 

The first time we had them over someone decided the Wifi router was thirsty and poured beer on it (didn't pay for the replacement), They leave a mess every time and X doesn't clean up before or after well. Sometimes I end up doing it because having a 4 day old pot full of chili sitting on your counter embarrassing and walking around on spilled vodka isn't pleasant. The team have been rolling their used beer bottles under the couch instead of throwing them away. They are loud as hell and leave between 10 and 11 instead of the promised 9pm Some mornings when I go down to make coffee I find random people on my couch along with left behind trinkets and empty drinks bottles that were not walked the meter and a half to the bin. They have a fairly entitled and thankless attitude about it to boot. Lots of complaints about how they don't want to play some game or the house is too cold, or something was boring, or that we don't serve snacks. Some times when people come back to our place sleep they are nice and loud as you do at 3am. 

Over the year X has gotten fed up with them and started not attending the pres even though he invited them into the house and said he would take responsibility. 

All this is to say, I'm more than disgruntled and it's gotten worse since the new social's secretary Y was elected. It is well known that I am pissed and in response I get a little song and dance of ""I'm doing by best,"" and ""I'm so sorry,  I know this is unacceptable"" and on and on and on with no change in behavior from any of them. When X tried to get them to find a new place the response was ""you volunteered your house for the entire year"" but I don't see a binding contract Y so yeah...

As you can probably tell from this little vent, I'm a prickly short thing who prefers the comforts of home and I'm tired. Physically and mentally. (It's finals season, I love my straight As a little too much and it gives me anxiety ) I really want them gone. WIBTA if I just tell them to find a new place as they are unwelcome or made X do it himself?

  
TLDR: My flat mate invited our volleyball team for pregaming every week promising to keep thing, clean, timely and organized. Its been anything but and I'm fed up with it. ",1,1746531735.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

What am I here for?

Looking for something real, no rush, no pressure. Whether it becomes a relationship or a solid friendship, I‚Äôm all for deep connections built on trust and presence. Real talk, good vibes, and meaningful moments.

About me:

Coder by day, nuclear physics nerd by heart. I prepare to PhD, so my nights are a mix of equations and coffee-fueled study sessions (TOEFL & GRE adventures included). Life‚Äôs intense sometimes, but I find peace in the small things.

I love deep convos that last until midnight, spontaneous night walks, and wandering through quiet city streets that most people overlook. There‚Äôs magic in the hidden corners of the world.

Dreaming of a motorcycle trip through Europe, open road, fresh air, no set plans. The back seat is open if you‚Äôre into spontaneous adventures and great playlists.

I‚Äôm also in the middle of a fitness journey, building strength and feeling good. Thinking about my first tattoo. you got any awesome designs or stories to share?

What I‚Äôm looking for:

Someone emotionally grounded, kind, curious. Someone who doesn‚Äôt mind sitting in silence sometimes, or sharing weird thoughts and real feelings. If you‚Äôre someone who feels deeply and values presence, we might just get along.

If something here made you smile or feel seen, say hi. Or just tell me one random thing that made today a little brighter for you.

Also, there's a photo on my profile, would be great to see yours too",0,1746531664.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,0.5,False
1kg2av0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1kg2av0/should_you_choose_aquacrest_inline_water_filter/,Should You Choose AQUACREST In-Line Water Filter AQU-INL-PLUS Review for Your Refrigerator?,"Testing out the AQUA CREST AQU-INL-PLUS In-Line Water Filter for the past few months has been an eye-opening experience. As someone who cares deeply about the quality of water we consume daily‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs from the refrigerator dispenser or in my ice cubes‚Äîthis product delivered more than I anticipated. Right from the get-go, the claims of a high-capacity filter lasting 5 years or up to 10,000 gallons intrigued me, and I couldn‚Äôt wait to set it up and see if it lives up to the hype.

**Ease of Installation**

Setting up the in-line water filter was surprisingly straightforward. I‚Äôd been bracing myself for a headache-inducing installation session, but AQUA CREST nailed user-friendliness on this front. Thanks to the included 1/4-inch compression and push-to-connect fittings for both copper and plastic water lines, I didn‚Äôt even need to bring out most of my tools. It only took me about 10-15 minutes to connect it to my refrigerator‚Äôs water line, and it was ready to go. Honestly, the hardest part was finding my scissors! Pro tip: make sure to push the PE tubing into the filter firmly for about 20mm to avoid leaks‚Äîsomething the manual does a good job of pointing out.

**Advantages**

- Extremely easy to install; no need for professional help.
- Includes all components needed right out of the box.
- Long service life of up to 5 years or 10,000 gallons, reducing maintenance frequency.  
- Efficient filtration using granular activated carbon made from natural coconut shell.  
- Improves taste and reduces chlorine, rust, and sediment effectively.  

[Check AQUA CREST AQU-INL-PLUS price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b08mqh17bt/)

**Water Quality & Filtration Performance**

Using the filter has genuinely upgraded the quality of water we get from the refrigerator. I particularly noticed a drastic improvement in the taste‚Äîthe funky chlorine aftertaste that used to linger is now completely gone. It‚Äôs impressive that this tiny device can handle so much, filtering out not only chlorine but rust, sediment, and other unpleasant stuff. However, if you‚Äôre concerned about Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), this may not be the filter for you as it doesn‚Äôt target those.

Even my morning coffee tastes better now‚Äîit‚Äôs amazing how much of a difference water quality makes. My neighbor popped in to borrow some ice last week (long story), and I didn‚Äôt even have to explain why our ice cubes were so crystal clear. She just assumed I‚Äôd switched to some high-tech refrigerator with a fancy built-in filter.

**Design & Material Quality**

This filter wasn‚Äôt just thrown together with poor materials. It‚Äôs BPA-free and lead-free, which feels reassuring, especially because it connects directly to a water source we drink from. On top of that, the use of durable granulated activated carbon sourced from coconut shell adds to its charm. Its compact size meant it didn‚Äôt take up unnecessary space under my sink area, which is already packed with cleaning supplies and odds-and-ends.

**Disadvantages**

- Doesn‚Äôt filter Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), so certain water qualities might not see full improvement.  
- The plastic fittings need careful handling during installation to avoid cracking.  

**Other Options**

Comparing it to competing brands like the GE GXRTDR and Culligan IC-100A, the AQUA CREST filter is an incredibly cost-efficient alternative. Both competitors deliver decent filtration quality but often fall short when it comes to lifespan. The Culligan IC-100A, for instance, typically caps out around 2,500 gallons, meaning you‚Äôd be switching it out more often‚Äîan inconvenience and a slight strain on the wallet. 

On the premium side, Samsung‚Äôs DA29-10105J offers slightly more advanced filtration but at double the price and with a shorter service life. I couldn‚Äôt justify the $$ on something that would need replacing twice as often. AQUA CREST balances efficiency and durability, making it stand tall in this crowded space. Its ability to work seamlessly with other devices like RVs and boats also makes it more versatile compared to many of its rivals.

**Smart Spending**

All things considered, the price you‚Äôre paying here translates into a significantly long-term investment. Think about the savings on bottled water or the hassle of replacing filters every few months‚Äîit‚Äôs a financial no-brainer for anyone looking to upgrade their water filtration setup. Plus, it‚Äôs not just saving money; it‚Äôs the convenience and peace of mind you get knowing your water is cleaner and tastier for half a decade.

I had tried various over-the-counter whitening products, but the results were minimal, and some caused sensitivity. Seeking an effective and gentle solution, I came across **Laughland teeth whitening**. Intrigued by its personalized approach and positive reviews, I decided to give it a shot.

**What's Included in the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit**

The kit arrived promptly and contained:

* **Whitening Gel Pens**: Easy-to-use pens with a clear gel.
* **LED Mouthpiece**: Designed to accelerate the whitening process.
* **Instruction Manual**: Straightforward guidelines for use.

The packaging was sleek, and the components felt high-quality.

**Using the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit**

The process was simple:

1. **Brush and Dry Teeth**: Ensures the gel adheres properly.
2. **Apply Gel**: Use the pen to apply a thin layer on each tooth.
3. **Insert LED Mouthpiece**: Wear it for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse and Clean**: After the session, rinse your mouth and clean the mouthpiece.

I followed this routine daily for a week.

**My Results After One Week**

* **Day 1**: No noticeable change.
* **Day 3**: Slight improvement in brightness.
* **Day 5**: Teeth appeared visibly whiter.
* **Day 7**: Significant reduction in stains; teeth looked brighter and more uniform.

Importantly, I experienced no sensitivity throughout the process.

**What Sets Laughland Apart**

* **Personalized Formulas**: Based on a quiz, the kit is tailored to your sensitivity level and whitening goals.
* **Convenience**: The process fits easily into a daily routine.
* **Gentle Yet Effective**: Achieved noticeable results without discomfort.

For more information, you can visit [**Laughland's official website**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural).

**Comparing Laughland to Other Whitening Methods**

* **Whitening Strips**: Often caused gum irritation and uneven whitening.
* **Whitening Toothpaste**: Minimal impact on deep stains.
* **Professional Treatments**: Effective but expensive and time-consuming.

Laughland provided a balanced solution: effective results at a reasonable cost and time commitment.

**Final Thoughts**

**Laughland teeth whitening** exceeded my expectations. The personalized approach, ease of use, and noticeable results without sensitivity make it a standout option for at-home teeth whitening. If you're seeking an effective and convenient solution, it's worth considering.

I‚Äôll be using it for traveling and it will also be an upgrade from my entry level electric grinder at home. I currently use an Espressione. I have a few models in mind and would love your thoughts, and opinions, or other recommendations I didn‚Äôt think of. I currently brew mostly pour over, and the occasional mini moka pot. I will be getting an aeropress soon. My wife will still use our cheap Mr. coffee drip machine. 

Things I have found I like. 

- Foldable handle for traveling
- A case is nice
- Magnetic catch cup ( I read threaded ones can catch debris)
- At least 30g capacity
- I like the idea it could grind for multiple styles even though we don‚Äôt have an espresso machine. I‚Äôd like one but no plans to purchase. 


I like the look of these 3 from 1Zpresso 

-X-Ultra (up to 200 clicks 12.5 micron per click)

Pros: Meets my requirements and the price is nice. Designed for a variety of styles. 
Cons: smaller catch cup

-ZP6 (9 numbers/90 clicks, 22 microns per click)

Pros: Larger catch cup is nice for the bigger carafes my wife and I share with the Kalita 185. 
Cons: It‚Äôs specialized for pour over only. Will it work well for moka pot and Aeropress? We don‚Äôt have an espresso machine. We could possibly add one in the future.  


K-Ultra (10 numbers/100 clicks 20 microns per click)

Pros: Largest catch cup. Designed for a variety of styles 
Cons: Most expensive.

**Stylish Yet Practical Design**

Whether you have a spacious backyard or a tiny balcony, this set fits in seamlessly. I placed the chairs and coffee table on my deck, surrounded by potted plants, and it instantly transformed the vibe. The tempered glass top on the coffee table deserves a special mention‚Äîit‚Äôs not just sturdy and functional but adds a touch of sophistication to the entire set. The glass cleans easily, even after my dog decided to drool all over it from her perch nearby.

**Comfort That Stole the Show**  
I didn‚Äôt think chairs could spoil me, but the generous seat size of this set proved me wrong. The cushions are plush, made from high-quality olefin fabric, and feel luxurious. I also appreciated the deeper seating‚Äîit lets you sink in just right while still feeling supported. The lumbar pillows were a hit with everyone who tried the chairs, from my neighbor in his sixties to my ten-year-old niece who always fought with her older brother over ""the comfy seat.‚Äù While the cushions stay in place most of the time, I noticed during a windy afternoon that the cord system failed to prevent some slight movement.

**Material Durability and Weather Resistance**  
Crafted from a powder-coated steel frame, the chairs and table felt solid even after weeks of outdoor use. The manufacturer‚Äôs claim of rust resistance seems legit, as there wasn‚Äôt a mark of oxidation even after some light rain showers. However, being made of PE wicker and faux rattan, I do wonder how well it‚Äôll hold up to blazing summer temperatures or the occasional snowstorm without cracking. I‚Äôd recommend storing the set indoors or at least covering it during extreme weather conditions.

**Strengths**  
- The tempered glass table combines durability and elegance.  
- Comfortable, plush cushions that elevate lounging.  
- Compact and lightweight design, convenient for smaller spaces.  

**Minor Hurdles**  
- Cushion cords could be better secured, especially on breezier days.  
- Wicker material might not withstand harsh conditions in the long term.  

**Easy Assembly, But‚Ä¶**  
One of the selling points that intrigued me was the claim of a fast and simple installation. The set does arrive with well-labeled parts and straightforward instructions. For a DIY enthusiast like me, the 10-minute setup claim felt like a challenge, and honestly, it was almost accurate. However, while it didn‚Äôt take long, screwing in the legs of the chairs became a minor hassle because the alignment wasn‚Äôt perfect out of the box. For those less comfortable with basic assembly, this might cause a bit of frustration.

**Peer Products**  
When put side by side with some popular alternatives like the Devoko 3 Piece Patio Set, this product fares slightly better in comfort but falls short in terms of overall weather resistance. The Devoko set offers a more robust wicker material that feels like it could endure rough weather, yet its cushions aren‚Äôt as plush as this one. Another competitor, the Keter Balcony Set, is fantastic for urban balconies due to its ultra-compact sizes, but it lacks the aesthetic appeal that this Verano Garden bistro set brings to the table.

**Affordable Quality**  
The price matched my expectations for a stylish yet moderately durable outdoor bistro set. Compared to higher-end offerings, it delivers great value for its price. The materials and comfort, combined with its versatile indoor-outdoor usability, justify the investment. Is it the most budget-friendly patio furniture set out there? Not quite, but between the upscale cushions and its polished design, it‚Äôs a worthwhile trade-off for quality over cut-rate options.

I‚Äôm almost 18, and I‚Äôve been struggling with pretty intense deliberating symptoms for almost two years. I‚Äôve been unable to go to school, and have spent the past 6 months at home, maybe gone out with friends or to get exams done at school 5 times in total in that time span as well. So over all I‚Äôve been super limited. 

It‚Äôs been a struggle. Both not knowing what was wrong with me, and also not being able to live like a normal teenager. It made me insecure about my body too, not from a visual perspective, interestingly enough the past 2-3 years my confidence about my physical appearance have only gotten better, but rather insecure of the inside of my body? The feeling of constantly being kinda gross? That took a toll on me along with the fear of being unable to live normally, maybe ever. 

I‚Äôve been super stressed about school and getting a job and all the ‚Äúgrowing up‚Äù things in life. This week in particular was very stressful for me. 
Yesterday, I went to a job interview (that I‚Äôd already cancelled once due to symptoms hindering me from leaving home) and I got a job for the summer. It‚Äôll be my first summer job ever (although I‚Äôve worked on weekends previously when I was 14-15 at a coffee shop, and I worked in elder care from 12-13, so I‚Äôve had jobs throughout my teenage years but was unable to keep at it once I got sick) and I‚Äôm honestly super excited! 

Today I had one of my final exams (it‚Äôs an exam that can only be taken on the day it has been scheduled, it cannot be redone or moved, so it‚Äôs crucial for every student to be present) and let me tell you the in-flexibility freaked me out so much + the fact that the exam was in the morning, and mornings are usually hell for me. 

I managed to get to school (two pair of underwear, a maxi pad instead of a diaper because I can‚Äôt bring myself to accept I‚Äôd need one yet, and thick pants + a change of pants+underwear in my bag and Imodium prepped since the day before) and I absolutely nailed the exam, was done first as per usual and left an hour before the exam time was up. I felt great. 

My teacher put me in a separate room with easy bathroom access which I am immensely grateful for (although I didn‚Äôt need it thanks to Imodium and I‚Äôd been fasting since yesterday morning, however just knowing that the bathroom was so close and available for me, made almost all my anxiety go away) and everything was a smooth sail. 

On Thursday this week I‚Äôve got the next part of the exam, and I don‚Äôt even really feel nervous anymore? I‚Äôm going to take laxatives today and tomorrow to clean out  the Imodium (I am in immense pain when Ive got medically induced constipation, so I‚Äôm trying to avoid that) and then back to liquid diet after breakfast tomorrow and Imodium in the morning of the exam, just like today and yesterday. And I feel like I might actually manage to figure out school just fine? 

My school is closing so I‚Äôll have to find a new school to the fall to finish my last year so I can graduate. My teacher is helping me atm to apply for schools that offer distance learning and that my classes will be remote. I‚Äôm starting to feel hope for the future, I feel so much more capable now! 

I just wanted to celebrate a little, it‚Äôs not a huge win and it‚Äôs nothing big at all for most people, but for me this is so meaningful and I feel so proud that I managed!

‚ÄúKathy, you can‚Äôt be serious!‚Äù Michael exclaimed, his voice echoing disbelief.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Michael. But I‚Äôm in Vegas now with Shawn. We‚Äôre heading off on a long honeymoon,‚Äù Kathy replied.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving in two weeks! Two weeks! What am I supposed to do without a nanny?!‚Äù he cried out.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Michael... Could you say goodbye to Ollie for me?‚Äù she asked, her voice soft.

‚ÄúYeah, sure‚Ä¶‚Äù he muttered before hanging up. He tossed the phone onto the table, swearing under his breath, ‚ÄúSon of a bitch!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, Michael?‚Äù Kim Morgan asked, her voice filled with concern.

‚ÄúNothing much, just my nanny deciding to quit on me!‚Äù he spat out, leaning back in his chair and running his fingers through his hair.

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù Neil Morgan walked over to the table, leading a cute little boy to his father with a sippy cup of milk. ‚ÄúKathy just quit?!‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in Vegas, getting hitched!‚Äù Michael gritted out to his neighbors.

‚ÄúWow‚Ä¶‚Äù Kim murmured.

He sighed. ‚ÄúI need to call my mom. Can you watch Ollie for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure! Do you want us to hold off on lunch?‚Äù Neil asked, ruffling the little boy‚Äôs hair.

‚ÄúNo, go ahead and eat. I should only be a few minutes,‚Äù Michael replied. They nodded in understanding, and he walked to the back of their perfectly manicured lawn to call his mom.

‚ÄúMichael! Hi honey! How are you?‚Äù Susan Whitlock gushed.

‚ÄúMom, I‚Äôm in deep shit!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù she asked, her voice filled with worry. ‚ÄúIs Ollie okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúOllie‚Äôs fine‚Ä¶ Kathy just called and quit! She‚Äôs in Vegas, eloping!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh Michael! But you‚Äôre leaving in a few weeks!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know! Can you help me out?‚Äù he pleaded.

‚ÄúOh honey, I can fly up and help before you leave, but you know I can‚Äôt go to London with you,‚Äù Susan said gently.

‚ÄúI know, Mom, but if you could stay until I find someone, I‚Äôd really appreciate it! You know what, I‚Äôll get you a really nice birthday present!‚Äù he offered.

She laughed, ‚ÄúLet me look for flights to Chicago and think about what you can get me for my birthday then.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, Mom! Ollie and I will pick you up at the airport. Thank you!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome, honey. I‚Äôll be in touch.‚Äù

Relieved, Michael returned to the table and sat down with his son and neighbors. ‚ÄúMy mom‚Äôs coming to watch Ollie until I can figure something out.‚Äù

‚ÄúMichael, Kim and I were thinking. What about our daughter, Anelise?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about her? Isn‚Äôt she in college?‚Äù he asked, a hint of confusion in his voice.

‚ÄúWell, yes, but she‚Äôs almost done with her semester and she loves babysitting,‚Äù Kim replied.

‚ÄúReally? Do you think she‚Äôd be interested in spending her summer as a nanny?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think this would be perfect for her! She‚Äôs getting her master‚Äôs in English literature and is just starting on her thesis.‚Äù

Neil chimed in, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a good girl, never gets in trouble, and has a 4.0. And she doesn‚Äôt party, even though her roommate really tries to get her to!‚Äù

‚ÄúHow old is she again?‚Äù Michael asked.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs twenty. She‚Äôll be turning twenty-one in October,‚Äù Kim said proudly.

Michael was desperate and thought for a moment. ‚ÄúCan I have her number? I‚Äôll give her a call and see what she thinks.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course! I‚Äôll text her to give her a heads-up,‚Äù Neil said as he passed a tray of grilled salmon to his neighbor.

As he was about to leave, Michael glanced at the pictures of the neighbors‚Äô daughter on the walls.

She was a curvy young woman with glasses, dark auburn hair, and a warm smile. She looked like the quintessential bookworm and seemed like a good choice to watch Ollie when they went to England.

He hoped the call would go well.

\*\*\*

Anelise was making notes for the thesis proposal that she would be writing over the summer. She had to turn it in after the final, but she just wasn‚Äôt satisfied with it. She wanted something more, but didn‚Äôt know what.

When she was discussing her proposal with Professor Andrews, she had felt it was lacking something, some excitement or passion, some spark that ignited her soul.

Professor Andrews, on the other hand, said what she had was great and would make a good final project. But Anelise didn‚Äôt want just good; she wanted her thesis to be amazing and awe-inspiring.

Anelise sighed as she went to get a cup of sweet tea, which she allowed herself to have once a day. She believed that if she didn‚Äôt limit herself, the weight loss she had worked so hard for would be undone.

She took a long sip from her cup, feeling thankful that her roommate and best friend, Leslie, was out having Sunday brunch with her ridiculously wealthy family and that the apartment was quiet so she could stew in peace.

She was pacing around the room, trying to clear her head and buckle down to study for the rest of her finals, when her phone rang.

She didn‚Äôt recognize the number, but seeing that it was from Chicago, she figured it could be the neighbor that her parents had said might call with an interesting proposal.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù she answered.

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ Hello. May I speak with Anelise, please?‚Äù asked the caller in a deep baritone voice, which sent shivers down her spine.

‚ÄúThis is Anelise. How can I help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy name is Michael Whitlock. Your parents gave me your number. I‚Äôm their neighbor,‚Äù he explained.

‚ÄúOh yes, they mentioned that you might be calling with a proposal. What can I do for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I know this is completely out of the blue, but I‚Äôm in a real bind. Your parents mentioned that you liked kids and babysitting might be something you‚Äôd be interested in. My nanny quit yesterday and is eloping.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs pretty romantic,‚Äù she said, her smile lighting up her face.

He laughed. ‚ÄúI guess it is, but here‚Äôs the catch. I‚Äôm heading out of town for work for three months. She was supposed to come along and look after my son, Ollie, while I was busy. Would you be interested in doing that? I promise to pay you well.‚Äù

She chewed on her lip, considering the offer. The money could be good, and she had started to enjoy shopping with Leslie since she had lost all that weight.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure... I have to write my master‚Äôs thesis‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. Your parents mentioned it. But they also thought you might be interested in this. My job is sending me to London for the summer. You‚Äôd have days off to explore and do research for your paper.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?!‚Äù Analise gasped.

‚ÄúYes, we leave in thirteen days, and I‚Äôll pay you $1500 per week. My company will cover food and accommodation. But you should know that I‚Äôll be working¬†*a lot*, and you‚Äôd be responsible for Ollie late into the night.‚Äù

He hoped he had made the offer sound appealing, rather than overwhelming.

Three months in London? Earning a ton of money for watching one kid? She could even quit her job at the coffee shop and not have to go back next semester!

‚ÄúAre you still there?‚Äù His voice broke through her thoughts.

‚ÄúOh my gosh, I‚Äôm sorry! Yes, I‚Äôm still here, and yes, I‚Äôll do it!‚Äù she replied, her voice filled with excitement.

‚ÄúReally?!‚Äù Michael‚Äôs voice was filled with relief.

‚ÄúYes. I know it‚Äôs not ideal that I can‚Äôt meet you or your son before we leave. But this sounds like a good arrangement for both of us, especially if my parents gave you my number. And I could quit my job with the money you‚Äôre offering,‚Äù she said, feeling a rush of excitement.

‚ÄúOh my God.¬†*Thank you!*¬†You have no idea how much this means to me!‚Äù He practically shouted into the phone, his fist punching the air in triumph.

They chatted for a few more minutes about what she would need to do and about Ollie, who sounded like a wonderful little boy.

‚ÄúWould it be okay if I took Ollie to some museums while we‚Äôre there?‚Äù she asked, a little unsure.

‚ÄúYou want to do educational things with my child? How could I possibly say no to that?‚Äù Michael laughed, making her blush at the silliness of her question.

‚ÄúGive me your email. I‚Äôll book you a ticket to Chicago and then we can all fly to London together. A long flight will be a good chance for us to get to know each other. Oh, and you do have a passport, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I do. So I‚Äôm all set. A ticket to Chicago is fine. I‚Äôll meet you at the airport.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want to come on Friday night and stay with your parents?‚Äù he asked, knowing they hadn‚Äôt seen each other in a while with her taking summer courses and working.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù She almost shouted, ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ um, I need Friday to get things sorted. An early flight on Saturday would be great. I don‚Äôt care how early it is.‚Äù

He was a little surprised that she didn‚Äôt want to see her parents, but he didn‚Äôt push it. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôll get everything started and email you all the details.‚Äù

They chatted a bit more before hanging up. Anelise felt like she was about to burst with excitement and couldn‚Äôt wait to tell Leslie what had just happened. She was going to spend the summer in London!

She had always dreamed of going there, and now it was actually happening! The dates worked perfectly with her school schedule, based on Michael‚Äôs plans.

She would have at least one day off each weekend. Plus, any time Ollie was sleeping, she would be able to write, research, or do whatever she needed.

Suddenly, an idea struck her. She rushed to the table and opened a new document. Words started pouring out of her. She was still writing an email to Professor Andrews, grinning like a mad woman, when Leslie came home two hours later.

‚ÄúWhy are you grinning like the cat that got the cream? Finally told your parents off? My mom was so mad you weren‚Äôt there!‚Äù Leslie tossed her purse onto the couch.

Anelise rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúNot yet, but listen!‚Äù She launched into the story of what had happened and watched as Leslie‚Äôs eyes widened.

‚ÄúSo let me get this straight, your parents gave your number to a neighbor who needs a nanny for the summer and now you‚Äôre going to spend the summer in England while writing your thesis¬†*and*¬†getting paid for it?‚Äù Leslie asked.

She nodded, her excitement palpable.

‚ÄúAnd this neighbor has a sexy voice‚Ä¶? Damn, Ani! You‚Äôre going to have an amazing summer! I‚Äôm so jealous!‚Äù

Ani danced around their apartment, her excitement infectious.

Professor Andrews, on the other hand, said what she had was great and would make a good final project. But Anelise didn‚Äôt want just good; she wanted her thesis to be amazing and awe-inspiring.

Anelise sighed as she went to get a cup of sweet tea, which she allowed herself to have once a day. She believed that if she didn‚Äôt limit herself, the weight loss she had worked so hard for would be undone.

She took a long sip from her cup, feeling thankful that her roommate and best friend, Leslie, was out having Sunday brunch with her ridiculously wealthy family and that the apartment was quiet so she could stew in peace.

She was pacing around the room, trying to clear her head and buckle down to study for the rest of her finals, when her phone rang.

She didn‚Äôt recognize the number, but seeing that it was from Chicago, she figured it could be the neighbor that her parents had said might call with an interesting proposal.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù she answered.

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ Hello. May I speak with Anelise, please?‚Äù asked the caller in a deep baritone voice, which sent shivers down her spine.

‚ÄúThis is Anelise. How can I help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy name is Michael Whitlock. Your parents gave me your number. I‚Äôm their neighbor,‚Äù he explained.

‚ÄúOh yes, they mentioned that you might be calling with a proposal. What can I do for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I know this is completely out of the blue, but I‚Äôm in a real bind. Your parents mentioned that you liked kids and babysitting might be something you‚Äôd be interested in. My nanny quit yesterday and is eloping.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs pretty romantic,‚Äù she said, her smile lighting up her face.

He laughed. ‚ÄúI guess it is, but here‚Äôs the catch. I‚Äôm heading out of town for work for three months. She was supposed to come along and look after my son, Ollie, while I was busy. Would you be interested in doing that? I promise to pay you well.‚Äù

She chewed on her lip, considering the offer. The money could be good, and she had started to enjoy shopping with Leslie since she had lost all that weight.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure... I have to write my master‚Äôs thesis‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. Your parents mentioned it. But they also thought you might be interested in this. My job is sending me to London for the summer. You‚Äôd have days off to explore and do research for your paper.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?!‚Äù Analise gasped.

‚ÄúYes, we leave in thirteen days, and I‚Äôll pay you $1500 per week. My company will cover food and accommodation. But you should know that I‚Äôll be working¬†*a lot*, and you‚Äôd be responsible for Ollie late into the night.‚Äù

He hoped he had made the offer sound appealing, rather than overwhelming.

Three months in London? Earning a ton of money for watching one kid? She could even quit her job at the coffee shop and not have to go back next semester!

‚ÄúAre you still there?‚Äù His voice broke through her thoughts.

‚ÄúOh my gosh, I‚Äôm sorry! Yes, I‚Äôm still here, and yes, I‚Äôll do it!‚Äù she replied, her voice filled with excitement.

‚ÄúReally?!‚Äù Michael‚Äôs voice was filled with relief.

‚ÄúYes. I know it‚Äôs not ideal that I can‚Äôt meet you or your son before we leave. But this sounds like a good arrangement for both of us, especially if my parents gave you my number. And I could quit my job with the money you‚Äôre offering,‚Äù she said, feeling a rush of excitement.

‚ÄúOh my God.¬†*Thank you!*¬†You have no idea how much this means to me!‚Äù He practically shouted into the phone, his fist punching the air in triumph.

They chatted for a few more minutes about what she would need to do and about Ollie, who sounded like a wonderful little boy.

‚ÄúWould it be okay if I took Ollie to some museums while we‚Äôre there?‚Äù she asked, a little unsure.

‚ÄúYou want to do educational things with my child? How could I possibly say no to that?‚Äù Michael laughed, making her blush at the silliness of her question.

‚ÄúGive me your email. I‚Äôll book you a ticket to Chicago and then we can all fly to London together. A long flight will be a good chance for us to get to know each other. Oh, and you do have a passport, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I do. So I‚Äôm all set. A ticket to Chicago is fine. I‚Äôll meet you at the airport.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want to come on Friday night and stay with your parents?‚Äù he asked, knowing they hadn‚Äôt seen each other in a while with her taking summer courses and working.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù She almost shouted, ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ um, I need Friday to get things sorted. An early flight on Saturday would be great. I don‚Äôt care how early it is.‚Äù

He was a little surprised that she didn‚Äôt want to see her parents, but he didn‚Äôt push it. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôll get everything started and email you all the details.‚Äù

They chatted a bit more before hanging up. Anelise felt like she was about to burst with excitement and couldn‚Äôt wait to tell Leslie what had just happened. She was going to spend the summer in London!

She had always dreamed of going there, and now it was actually happening! The dates worked perfectly with her school schedule, based on Michael‚Äôs plans.

She would have at least one day off each weekend. Plus, any time Ollie was sleeping, she would be able to write, research, or do whatever she needed.

Suddenly, an idea struck her. She rushed to the table and opened a new document. Words started pouring out of her. She was still writing an email to Professor Andrews, grinning like a mad woman, when Leslie came home two hours later.

‚ÄúWhy are you grinning like the cat that got the cream? Finally told your parents off? My mom was so mad you weren‚Äôt there!‚Äù Leslie tossed her purse onto the couch.

Anelise rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúNot yet, but listen!‚Äù She launched into the story of what had happened and watched as Leslie‚Äôs eyes widened.

‚ÄúSo let me get this straight, your parents gave your number to a neighbor who needs a nanny for the summer and now you‚Äôre going to spend the summer in England while writing your thesis¬†*and*¬†getting paid for it?‚Äù Leslie asked.

She nodded, her excitement palpable.

‚ÄúAnd this neighbor has a sexy voice‚Ä¶? Damn, Ani! You‚Äôre going to have an amazing summer! I‚Äôm so jealous!‚Äù

Ani danced around their apartment, her excitement infectious.",1,1746530988.0,Novelas_romanticas_en,1,1.0,False

All Chapters Available ‚Äì Start Reading Now","*Anelise needed air. She excused herself from the table and walked to the patio of the little Parisian coffee and wine bar, the cool night air caressing her heated skin. Her slinky silk dress didn‚Äôt cover up much, but she still felt like she was going to melt into a puddle if she sat next to Michael a minute longer.*

*She took a deep breath and gazed out at the glittering skyline, the Eiffel Tower standing like a proud beauty amidst the other architecture. Maybe love really was in the air in this city.*¬†

*Or maybe it was just the wine she‚Äôd had. Or they way Michael‚Äôs big, warm hand had rested on her thigh under the table. She‚Äôd found herself biting her lip, wishing his fingers would inch just a little higher.*

*But no, she couldn‚Äôt lose her head tonight. It was all just an act. Michael just needed a plus-one to show off to his high-class colleagues, and as his nanny, Anelise was the easiest option available. After tonight, this delicious dream would be over, and the two of them would go back to the way things were.*

*Anelise tried to tell herself that was for the best. But then she felt a familiar warm body brush up beside her at the railing, and she lost all her resolve.*

*‚ÄúSomething wrong?‚Äù Michael asked in his husky baritone.*

*She looked up into his clear green eyes and suddenly found her own filling with tears. Concern etched itself into his handsome face and he lifted a hand to her face, brushing away a traitorous tear with his thumb.*¬†

*‚ÄúNone of this is real,‚Äù she whispered, afraid to break the spell.*

*His eyes dipped to her lips and he leaned in closer. ‚ÄúDo you want it to be real?‚Äù he asked.*

*Anelise‚Äôs head spun. He was too close. She‚Äôd had too much to drink. The flowers in full bloom all around the patio filled the air with a sweetness that made her dizzy.*¬†

*She knew it wasn‚Äôt the smart answer. But when she opened her mouth, all she could say was, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù*

*Then Michael‚Äôs mouth was on hers, and she didn‚Äôt need to worry about what to say anymore. Maybe tomorrow, she would wake up back in reality where he was her employer and she was his nanny. But tonight, she would enjoy the dream that they belonged together.*

\*\*\*

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to be kidding me, Kathy,‚Äù said Michael in disbelief, completely thrown off kilter.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, Michael. But I‚Äôm already in Vegas with Shawn. After we tie the knot, we‚Äôre going on a long honeymoon,‚Äù Kathy replied.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving in two weeks!‚Äù Michael winced at his tone and lowered his voice. Kathy was adamant about never yelling at his kid, so he figured he owed her the same courtesy. ‚ÄúWhat am I going to do without a nanny?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI regret leaving on such short notice, but you‚Äôll have to find someone else. When it‚Äôs love, it‚Äôs love. You understand, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, sure,‚Äù Michael grumbled. He didn‚Äôt, really.¬†

‚ÄúCan you say goodbye to Ollie for me?‚Äù she asked softly.

‚ÄúI will. He‚Äôll miss you,‚Äù he said before hanging up. Then he threw the phone on the table, cursing, ‚ÄúSon of a bitch!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, Michael?‚Äù Kim inquired. Kathy had called him in the middle of lunch with his neighbors, the Morgans.

‚ÄúOh, nothing, just my nanny quitting on me!‚Äù he fumed as he leaned back in the chair, running his fingers through his hair.

‚ÄúKathy just up and quit right before your big trip?‚Äù Neil asked, leading a cherubic little boy to the table with a sippy cup of milk.

Michael definitely had to mind his tone in front of his son. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in Vegas, eloping,‚Äù he gritted out.

‚ÄúWow,‚Äù Kim said. ‚ÄúI never knew she was such a romantic.‚Äù",1,1746530802.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

sometimes, however, i catch myself clinging to / excessively savoring coffee time to 'cross-justify' spending more time on reddit.

it reminds me of how my eldest sibling justifies smoking because she 'only smokes when she drinks' so she then drinks all the time.

in my case, i'm just 'savoring my coffee' because that allows me to spend more time on reddit.

insult to injury, i just realized that i'm also falling into my recently-discovered 'hands-off task trap', wherein i forget that the task i'm resisting switching to is merely starting something; only to have me almost immediately back at the task that i'm resisting switching from!ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

you see, the thing that follows finishing my coffee is (and i'm not proud of how blind i am to this) literally drinking water for 30 minutes before flossing my teeth (to allow acidity from coffee in my mouth to dissipate before brushing/flossing).

so, i delay/avoid task-switching so that i can spend time on reddit, only to get immediately back to reddit after spending 10 seconds filling my water cup to drink said water! (maybe i SHOULD consider medication, haha).

**so what can i do about it?**

so i set a *set timer to accelerate finishing coffee by 7am* alarm for 6:45 a.m.

...and a *enjoy reddit/water > floss @ 7:30am* alarm for 7:00 a.m.

i also snooze this alarm to remind me to drink my water, which will have me finishing my water in right around 30 minutes.

*please note that i'm not advocating for this level of discipline. i'm merely using a real-world example to illustrate the* ***technique*** *i use to address resistance to task switching / idle time blindness.*",1,1746530699.0,Non_Medical_ADHD,0,1.0,False

Today he texted me and asked me if I'd be at the gym and so eventually we agreed to meet for coffee after gym at 2 pm because we both have different schedules and I took 30 mins after gym to sort out some work stuff.

So anyway I went to the coffee place we agreed to at the time we agreed upon, but he wasn't around so I asked him what he was up to. He said he has been killing time in the gym for the past 30 mins and didn't even start workout. I asked when he'd be ready and he said in 40 mins. Then he asked me what I was up to. I said I was done with work and everything and I was sitting at the cafe. But then it didn't sit well with me. I just texted him that I would be leaving and left there.

Am I overreacting here? It just seemed off that he would not even do anything meaningful for 30 mins knowing the time we would meet?",1,1746530541.0,AmIOverreacting,1,0.67,False

Raena dropped back in the enormous bed, staring at the baldachin that hung over her head. Thin layers of semi-transparent white fabric hung the four-poster bed from all sides, supposedly to give the loving couple some privacy. Or maybe it was just to create an atmosphere for their first night together since it really didn‚Äôt do much in terms of concealing anything.  
  
It had been four hours since they had escorted her to the bridal chamber. She was instructed to wait for her husband in her ceremonial gown since, according to their traditions, he was supposed to be the first person to take her wedding veil off and gaze upon her face. He hadn‚Äôt shown up, of course, not that she expected him to.  
  
A knock echoed through the room, and Raena sat up with a sigh. Grabbing the veil lying next to her on the bed, she threw it over her head, no longer caring that it tilted to the side. Every half an hour, they would check on her to make certain she wasn‚Äôt asleep, then they would leave her alone again. And every time, they said the same thing:  
  
‚ÄúYour Highness, please be patient. His Highness will come soon.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she replied as the palace maid turned to leave. ‚ÄúWait! Send my maid in.‚Äù  
  
The young girl froze for a moment, glancing up and then bowing down immediately as if afraid she‚Äôd be punished for doing so.  
  
‚ÄúYes, Your Highness,‚Äù she murmured before disappearing through the door.  
  
Raena took the veil off again, tossing it on the bed as she slid to the floor. The ceremonial attire included a thin, long underdress of shimmering cream color, covered by a richly embroidered, gem-encrusted gown that seemed to weigh a ton. Being the Prime Minister‚Äôs only daughter and all, her family had gone overboard in showing their wealth and status.   
  
Raena started pulling the hairpins out of her long, blonde hair and throwing them on the vanity table in front of her. Staring at the still unfamiliar reflection in the mirror, she had to remind herself that she was no longer Lydia Myles, a university dropout and an overworked waitress at her mother‚Äôs restaurant. She was Lady Raena Magrath now, a noblewoman by birth and a princess by marriage, but most important of all ‚Äî she was currently living in the body of a fictional character in the worst romance book ever.  
  
It was still difficult to believe that this was really happening, so every morning when she woke up, she would rush to the nearest mirror to look at herself, at this new reality that insisted she was there, inside that damn book. And every morning, a pair of baby blue eyes would stare back at her with utter disbelief until acceptance flooded her frail, new body, calming down her racing heart.  
  
A month had passed since she woke up in this world. The last thing she remembered before that was finishing a long shift at her mother‚Äôs restaurant and heading home in the early hours of the morning. Drowsy and distracted, she hadn‚Äôt seen the blade before it was too late. Then the pain came, the darkness and the voice. She still couldn‚Äôt remember what the voice had said.  
  
Waking up here, alive and without so much as a scratch on her stomach, she thought she was dreaming. Perhaps she was in a coma back home and her brain was keeping her occupied while her body fought to repair the damage. It had to be that. What else could it be?  
  
Days passed, then weeks, but she still didn‚Äôt wake up back in the real world. So she accepted that she was stuck in this place ‚Äî maybe forever ‚Äî and wasting her days in idle chatter and boring walks wasn‚Äôt how she wanted to spend this lucid dream or whatever was happening to her.  
  
More shocking than realizing she was no longer in her own body was the fact that this new world was actually familiar. At first, the names sounded strange, and the places she had never been to before looked vaguely familiar, but she couldn‚Äôt quite put her finger on it. It was like a word on the tip of her tongue, but she couldn‚Äôt remember what it was.   
  
All of that had changed when she learned her own name and her own fate ‚Äî to become the second wife of the third prince of the Empire, Kassian Etrobia. Then it clicked.  
  
The book. The stupid book that lay abandoned on her nightstand with coffee stains on the cover. The places, the names, the people ‚Äî everything was like in that book!  
  
The door opened with a quiet creak, and someone strode in, barely making any noise.  
  
‚ÄúYou called?‚Äù  
  
Raena turned to look at her personal maid, only to find her standing right behind her. Kara‚Äôs dark hair was gathered in a thick braid that brushed past her shoulder and barely reached her collarbone, her bright eyes staring at Raena with what she could only describe as a calculating expression.  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you have to bow or something?‚Äù Raena scoffed.  
  
‚ÄúWhy? There is no one else here,‚Äù Kara replied flatly, glancing toward the door. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I will be perfectly respectful and obedient in front of other people. I won‚Äôt taint my mistress‚Äôs reputation. After all, you‚Äôre officially a princess now. If I were to show any disrespect, I might be beaten to death.‚Äù  
  
Raena smiled. Telling Kara her secret ‚Äî or at least part of it ‚Äî had been a huge gamble, but it had paid off. No matter how much she knew about this world from that book, she needed someone to help her if she were to succeed in her plan ‚Äî a plan that was going to allow her to exit the main storyline and live a happy, pleasant life as a rich, single lady. Away from the drama, the fighting, and the death which would soon befall this place.  
  
‚ÄúI won‚Äôt let that happen,‚Äù Raena assured her, stretching her arms. Without so much as a word, Kara began loosening up the ties on the back of the gown. The pressure around Raena‚Äôs chest decreased as the dress slipped down to her ankles, leaving her in just her thin undergarments. She stepped outside of the circle of cloth and Kara quickly gathered it, setting it carefully on the bed.  
  
‚ÄúYour position may give you power outside, but within this household, you hold very little of it,‚Äù Kara muttered, returning to her side and fumbling with her hair. A few more pins disappeared inside the maid‚Äôs pockets and Raena ran her fingers through the thick locks, wondering if she ever had such nice hair in the real world. ‚ÄúSo let‚Äôs make sure we both survive.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, my plan will work.‚Äù Raena smiled confidently. It had to work, it must. After all, she had an unfair advantage over everyone here. She just had to be smart about it. ‚ÄúWhy is there no food here?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThe bride should not eat or drink anything throughout the wedding day and night, so she is clean and ready to receive the seed of her husband. It is believed the chances of conception are much higher that way,‚Äù Kara explained as she fussed over the ceremonial dress, making sure there was no damage or wrinkles on it.  
  
‚ÄúWhat a bunch of nonsense!‚Äù Raena murmured, pressing on her rumbling stomach.   
  
‚ÄúPeople like traditions. It gives them a sense of stability and assurance. Not everybody likes change.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúBut how does that even make sense? Do people realize how hard it is to sit still for hours at a time? Not to mention that getting dehydrated is a real thing! And to top it all off, if we are to have s\*x, we‚Äôd need energy. If I don‚Äôt eat or drink all day, how am I supposed to have any strength to do it? Or am I supposed to just lie on my back like a dead fish, spread my legs open, and wait to ‚Äòreceive the seed of my husband‚Äô?‚Äù  
  
Kara closed her eyes, her lips turning into a thin line.  
  
‚ÄúReally, I never know what will come out of your mouth!‚Äù she sighed at the end. ‚ÄúPlease be mindful of what you say.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYes, yes. I‚Äôm shutting up,‚Äù Raena sighed with exasperation. Kara touched her arms, and Raena lifted them, patiently waiting as the maid helped her put on a simpler dress that slid around her legs in several layers of satin and gossamer. The pale blue gown brushed lightly against her skin as the maid adjusted the open sleeves before taking care of the buttons on her back. ‚ÄúWhere are we supposed to stay after tonight?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThe third prince has given you the North Palace. The other servants should be arriving there tomorrow,‚Äù Kara replied as she finished with the buttons.  
  
‚ÄúTomorrow? That won‚Äôt work. We are going there now.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Kara exclaimed, stepping in front of her so she could look her in the eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre supposed to stay here until morning, even if your husband doesn‚Äôt come! What if he comes and finds you gone? We‚Äôll both get in trouble!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúHe won‚Äôt come, so I have no intention of waiting any longer,‚Äù Raena said confidently.  
  
‚ÄúHow can you be so sure?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThe stars told me!‚Äù Raena grinned.  
  
She had decided not to tell Kara the part where their world was an exact replica of a book she had picked up in a second-hand bookshop a few months ago. Moreover, that same stupid book turned out to be an epic bore where the main characters were one-dimensional while the plot ran away from the author halfway through the story. The writer seemed more interested in describing every single detail of the world, including its history, political struggles and parties, and even social customs and events, instead of focusing on the love story or even the inevitable war she was hinting at from page one. But now all those little details, like the fact that the third prince didn‚Äôt visit his second wife‚Äôs chambers even once during their marriage, were finally worth something. Raena just wished she had forced herself to read until the end of the book instead of abandoning it halfway.  
  
‚ÄúThe stars, hm?‚Äù Kara echoed, pulling Raena back from her reverie.  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll soon find out the stars have a lot to say. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI still think we should stay here. If you leave now, all kinds of rumors might start‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWell, then,‚Äù Raena said as they reached the door. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good thing everybody already thinks that the Prime Minister‚Äôs daughter is just a beautiful girl with the brain capacity of a pumpkin. I can totally play this role! Prepare yourself to be amazed!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWith everything I‚Äôve seen so far, I am sure you‚Äôll exceed my expectations,‚Äù Kara deadpanned, turning the handle. ‚ÄúAfter you, Mistress.‚Äù  
  
She opened the door, bowing down as Raena moved past her. The four guards outside froze, staring at her with surprise, but it was the three maids next to the opposite wall who shook their stupor first. The oldest of them moved to block Raena‚Äôs path, bowing down and keeping her eyes on the floor as she spoke.   
  
‚ÄúYour Highness, please return to the bridal chamber. You must wait for His Highness.‚Äù When Raena didn‚Äôt reply, she allowed herself a look up, only to catch Raena‚Äôs gaze. The maid bowed her head immediately, her back stiffening, and Raena smiled. She might have been a second wife in a place full of much more powerful women, but she was still a princess and these people had to listen to her. They all knew that.

1kg1wz5,https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-image-generator-action-figure-privacy/,Think Twice Before Creating That ChatGPT Action Figure,"People are using ChatGPT‚Äôs new image generator to take part in viral social media trends. But using it also puts your privacy at risk‚Äîunless you take a few simple steps to protect yourself.

At the start of April, an influx of action figures started appearing on social media sites including [LinkedIn](https://www.wired.com/tag/linkedin/) and [X](https://www.wired.com/tag/x/). Each figure depicted the person who had created it with uncanny accuracy, complete with personalized accessories such as reusable coffee cups, yoga mats, and headphones.

All this is possible because of OpenAI‚Äôs new [GPT-4o-powered](https://www.wired.com/story/can-chatgpt-4o-be-trusted-with-your-private-data/) [image generator](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/chatgpts-image-generation-feature-gets-an-upgrade/), which supercharges ChatGPT‚Äôs ability to edit pictures, render text, and more. OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT image generator can also create pictures in the style of Japanese animated film company Studio Ghibli‚Äîa trend that [quickly went viral](https://apnews.com/article/studio-ghibli-chatgpt-images-hayao-miyazaki-openai-0f4cb487ec3042dd5b43ad47879b91f4), too.

The images are fun and easy to make‚Äîall you need is a free ChatGPT account and a photo. Yet to create an action figure or Studio Ghibli-style image, you also need to hand over a lot of data to OpenAI, which could be used to train its models.

# Hidden Data

The data you are giving away when you use an AI image editor is often hidden. **Every time you upload an image to ChatGPT, you‚Äôre potentially handing over ‚Äúan entire bundle of metadata,‚Äù** says Tom Vazdar, area chair for cybersecurity at Open Institute of Technology. **‚ÄúThat includes the EXIF data attached to the image file, such as the time the photo was taken and the GPS coordinates of where it was shot.‚Äù**

**OpenAI also collects data about the device you‚Äôre using to access the platform. That means your device type, operating system, browser version, and unique identifiers,** says Vazdar**. ‚ÄúAnd because platforms like ChatGPT operate conversationally, there‚Äôs also behavioral data, such as what you typed, what kind of images you asked for, how you interacted with the interface and the frequency of those actions.‚Äù**

**It's not just your face. If you upload a high-resolution photo, you're giving OpenAI whatever else is in the image, too‚Äîthe background, other people, things in your room and anything readable such as documents or badges,** says Camden Woollven, group head of AI product marketing at risk management firm GRC International Group**.**

This type of voluntarily provided, consent-backed data is ‚Äúa gold mine for training generative models,‚Äù especially multimodal ones that rely on visual inputs, says Vazdar.

OpenAI denies it is orchestrating viral photo trends as a ploy to collect user data, yet the firm certainly gains an advantage from it. OpenAI doesn‚Äôt need to scrape [the web](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-stop-your-data-from-being-used-to-train-ai/) for your face if you‚Äôre happily uploading it yourself, Vazdar points out. ‚ÄúThis trend, whether by design or a convenient opportunity, is providing the company with massive volumes of fresh, high-quality facial data from diverse age groups, ethnicities, and geographies.‚Äù

OpenAI says it does not actively seek out personal information to [train models](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7842364-how-chatgpt-and-our-foundation-models-are-developed)‚Äîand it doesn‚Äôt use public data on the internet to build profiles about people to advertise to them or sell their data, an OpenAI spokesperson tells WIRED. However, **under OpenAI‚Äôs current** [**privacy policy**](https://openai.com/policies/row-privacy-policy/)**, images submitted through ChatGPT can be retained and used to** [**improve its models**](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance)**.**

Any data, prompts, or requests you share helps teach the algorithm‚Äîand personalized information helps fine tune it further, says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at security outfit ESET, who created his own action figure to demonstrate the privacy risks of the trend [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jakemooreuk_ai-is-so-impressive-this-action-figure-trend-activity-7315707301544288256-vaSG?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAATSGm8Bflqx0b7kquPYpsOEmyUogT2Uj58).

# Uncanny Likeness

In some markets, your photos are protected by regulation. In the UK and EU, data-protection regulation including the [GDPR](https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-gdpr-uk-eu-legislation-compliance-summary-fines-2018/) offer strong protections, including the right to access or delete your data. At the same time, use of biometric data requires explicit consent.

However, photographs become biometric data only when processed through a specific technical means allowing the [unique identification](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/biometric-data-guidance-biometric-recognition/biometric-recognition/#:~:text=It%27s%20only%20when%20something%20else,stored%20as%20a%20biometric%20template.) of a specific individual, says Melissa Hall, senior associate at law firm MFMac. Processing an image to create a cartoon version of the subject in the original photograph is ‚Äúunlikely to meet this definition,‚Äù she says.

Meanwhile, in the US, privacy protections vary. ‚ÄúCalifornia and Illinois are leading with stronger data protection laws, but there is no standard position across all US states,‚Äù says Annalisa Checchi, a partner at IP law firm Ionic Legal. And OpenAI‚Äôs privacy policy doesn‚Äôt contain an explicit carve-out for likeness or biometric data, which ‚Äúcreates a grey area for stylized facial uploads,‚Äù Checchi says.

The risks include your image or likeness being retained, potentially used to train future models, or combined with other data for profiling, says Checchi. ‚ÄúWhile these platforms often prioritize safety, the long-term use of your likeness is still poorly understood‚Äîand hard to retract once uploaded.‚Äù

OpenAI says its users‚Äô [privacy and security](https://openai.com/consumer-privacy/) is a top priority. The firm wants its AI models to learn about the world, not private individuals, and it actively minimizes the collection of personal information, an OpenAI spokesperson tells WIRED.

Meanwhile, users have control over how their data is used, with self-service tools to access, export, or delete personal information. You can also opt out of having content used to improve models, according to OpenAI.

ChatGPT Free, Plus, and Pro users can control whether they contribute to future model improvements in their [data controls](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7730893-data-controls-faq) settings. OpenAI does not train on ChatGPT Team, Enterprise, and Edu customer data‚Å†¬†by default, according to the company.

# Trending Topics

The next time you are tempted to jump on a ChatGPT-led trend such as the action figure or Studio Ghibli‚Äìstyle images, it‚Äôs wise to consider the privacy trade-off. The risks apply to ChatGPT as well as many other AI image editing or generation tools, so it‚Äôs important to read the privacy policy before uploading your photos.

There are also steps you can take to protect your data. In ChatGPT, the most effective is to turn off chat history, which helps ensure your data is not used for training, says Vazdar. You can also upload anonymized or modified images, for example, using a filter or generating a digital avatar rather than an actual photo, he says.

It‚Äôs worth stripping out metadata from image files before uploading, which is possible using photo editing tools. **‚ÄúUsers should avoid prompts that include sensitive personal information and refrain from uploading group photos or anything with identifiable background features,‚Äù** says Vazdar.

Double-check your OpenAI account settings, especially those related to data use for training, Hall adds. **‚ÄúBe mindful of whether any third-party tools are involved, and never upload someone else‚Äôs photo without their consent. OpenAI‚Äôs terms make it clear that you‚Äôre responsible for what you upload, so awareness is key.‚Äù**

**Checchi recommends disabling model training in OpenAI‚Äôs settings, avoiding location-tagged prompts, and steering clear of linking content to social profiles.** ‚ÄúPrivacy and creativity aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive‚Äîyou just need to be a bit more intentional.‚Äù",3,1746530314.0,indotech,1,1.0,False

# Falling out of love

  
  
I woke up feeling disappointed as I looked at the empty space on my bed. I was hoping Ian, my boyfriend of the last two years and the future alpha of our pack, would have snuck into my room last night.  
  
Today is my eighteenth birthday. The first official day I can sniff out my mate. I was hoping Ian would have been here when I woke up since he decided to go out with his friends last night. I didn‚Äôt say anything when plans of us hanging out changed, but I should have. I wanted to, but I didn‚Äôt want to put on a show in front of his friends when they barged into the pack house yesterday. I just let him go, hoping he would choose me.  
  
‚ÄúSo, what do you think?‚Äù I asked my wolf, Tundra, as I stepped into the shower.  
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to think, Ash. I know he cares about us, but is that really enough,‚Äù she sighed.  
  
My blissful birthday bumble had been popped as I got ready to head to the pack house to find him. I wanted him to be my fated mate. I love him. Before his mother died, I spent so much time with her, even before Ian and I got together.  
  
I came here to live with my mother‚Äôs sister after both my parents died. She was newly mated and not ready to handle a soon-to-be nine-year-old who just lost everything. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Aunt Grace and her mate, Brad, are wonderful, and I owe them both so much.  
  
After I was ready, I looked at myself in the mirror one more time before heading downstairs. Aunt Grace was sitting at the table, looking down at her phone as she sipped a mug full of coffee.  
  
‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù I came up behind her and gave her a hug.  
  
‚ÄúHappy Birthday, sweetie,‚Äù she squealed, and I giggled. ‚ÄúYou must be so excited for today. I half expected Alpha Ian to be walking in behind you.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYeah, me too,‚Äù I mumbled, letting her go.  
  
‚ÄúIs everything okay?‚Äù She asked me, the excitement of the day now lost.  
  
‚ÄúYeah, of course, I‚Äôm going to go find Ian,‚Äù I smiled before walking out of the kitchen to the front door.  
  
‚ÄúGood luck,‚Äù she called out as I closed the door behind me.  
  
The cold fall air nipped my hot skin as I walked down the path to the sidewalk. The pack house was a ten-minute walk from my house. There was a new dusting of snow, and the early morning sun was still rising over the tree line. It would have been a beautiful morning if my stomach wasn‚Äôt twisted into knots. And the closer I walked to the park house, the tighter those knots became.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt eat this morning,‚Äù I mumbled to Tundra.  
  
‚ÄúEverything is going to work out, Ash, don‚Äôt worry so much.‚Äù  
  
I stopped at the end of the driveway and took a deep breath before walking up to the oak front doors. As soon as I stepped inside, the most delicious scent hit me. Musk, cedar, and vanilla.  
  
‚ÄúMate,‚Äù Tundra purred, and I smiled. My mate is here.  
  
I followed the scent up to the alpha floor, and that's when I knew it was Ian. Other members lived in the pack house, but this floor only had Ian and his father, Alpha Jason.  
  
The scent was stronger as I stood in front of his bedroom door. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. This was the moment I had been waiting for‚Äîfor two years.  
  
Grunts and groans caused me to open my eyes and look at the door in front of me.  
  
‚ÄúYes, Ian. Yes, right there,‚Äù a woman cried out. Before I knew what I was doing, I threw open the door. What I saw is something I could never unsee.  
  
Ian was standing at the end of his bed, naked. Sweat glistened his skin as he thrust his hips. I couldn‚Äôt say a word as I watched him with legs wrapped around his waist. Those weren‚Äôt my legs.  
  
Tundra let out a murderous growl, and the room stopped.  
  
Ian turned to face the door, his steel-blue eyes meeting my green ones.  
  
‚ÄúAshlyn,‚Äù he stammered. With his body turned, I was able to see the woman lying naked on his bed with my mate and boyfriend inside of her. Nicole.  
  
‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt what it looks like,‚Äù he stepped away from her, and Nicole fumbled to get underneath the blanket.  
  
My eyes filled with tears as I wondered what I did to deserve this. Ian was my best friend. We have been together for almost two years. The entire pack knew we were together. I felt like a f\*\*\*\*\*g joke.",1,1746530114.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1kg1uly,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1kg1uly/looking_for_a_link_to_read_blame_it_on_paris/,Looking for a link to read Blame It On Paris complete novel online,"**Got the full version of Blame It On Paris‚Äîcomment below for the link.**

*Anelise needed air. She excused herself from the table and walked to the patio of the little Parisian coffee and wine bar, the cool night air caressing her heated skin. Her slinky silk dress didn‚Äôt cover up much, but she still felt like she was going to melt into a puddle if she sat next to Michael a minute longer.*

*She took a deep breath and gazed out at the glittering skyline, the Eiffel Tower standing like a proud beauty amidst the other architecture. Maybe love really was in the air in this city.*¬†

*Or maybe it was just the wine she‚Äôd had. Or they way Michael‚Äôs big, warm hand had rested on her thigh under the table. She‚Äôd found herself biting her lip, wishing his fingers would inch just a little higher.*

*But no, she couldn‚Äôt lose her head tonight. It was all just an act. Michael just needed a plus-one to show off to his high-class colleagues, and as his nanny, Anelise was the easiest option available. After tonight, this delicious dream would be over, and the two of them would go back to the way things were.*

*Anelise tried to tell herself that was for the best. But then she felt a familiar warm body brush up beside her at the railing, and she lost all her resolve.*

*‚ÄúSomething wrong?‚Äù Michael asked in his husky baritone.*

*She looked up into his clear green eyes and suddenly found her own filling with tears. Concern etched itself into his handsome face and he lifted a hand to her face, brushing away a traitorous tear with his thumb.*¬†

*‚ÄúNone of this is real,‚Äù she whispered, afraid to break the spell.*

*His eyes dipped to her lips and he leaned in closer. ‚ÄúDo you want it to be real?‚Äù he asked.*

*Anelise‚Äôs head spun. He was too close. She‚Äôd had too much to drink. The flowers in full bloom all around the patio filled the air with a sweetness that made her dizzy.*¬†

*She knew it wasn‚Äôt the smart answer. But when she opened her mouth, all she could say was, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù*

*Then Michael‚Äôs mouth was on hers, and she didn‚Äôt need to worry about what to say anymore. Maybe tomorrow, she would wake up back in reality where he was her employer and she was his nanny. But tonight, she would enjoy the dream that they belonged together.*

\*\*\*

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to be kidding me, Kathy,‚Äù said Michael in disbelief, completely thrown off kilter.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, Michael. But I‚Äôm already in Vegas with Shawn. After we tie the knot, we‚Äôre going on a long honeymoon,‚Äù Kathy replied.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving in two weeks!‚Äù Michael winced at his tone and lowered his voice. Kathy was adamant about never yelling at his kid, so he figured he owed her the same courtesy. ‚ÄúWhat am I going to do without a nanny?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI regret leaving on such short notice, but you‚Äôll have to find someone else. When it‚Äôs love, it‚Äôs love. You understand, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, sure,‚Äù Michael grumbled. He didn‚Äôt, really.¬†

‚ÄúCan you say goodbye to Ollie for me?‚Äù she asked softly.

‚ÄúI will. He‚Äôll miss you,‚Äù he said before hanging up. Then he threw the phone on the table, cursing, ‚ÄúSon of a bitch!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, Michael?‚Äù Kim inquired. Kathy had called him in the middle of lunch with his neighbors, the Morgans.

‚ÄúOh, nothing, just my nanny quitting on me!‚Äù he fumed as he leaned back in the chair, running his fingers through his hair.

‚ÄúKathy just up and quit right before your big trip?‚Äù Neil asked, leading a cherubic little boy to the table with a sippy cup of milk.

Michael definitely had to mind his tone in front of his son. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in Vegas, eloping,‚Äù he gritted out.

‚ÄúWow,‚Äù Kim said. ‚ÄúI never knew she was such a romantic.‚Äù

Romance caused more problems than it was worth in Michael‚Äôs opinion. Not that he ever regretted Ollie, but his mother‚Ä¶ There were a lot of regrets there.¬†

‚ÄúI just had a thought,‚Äù said Neil, squeezing his wife‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúWhat about our daughter, Anelise? She‚Äôs almost done with her semester and loves to babysit.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Michael was willing to grasp at any glimmer of hope. ‚ÄúDo you think she would be interested in spending her summer nannying?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I think it would be perfect for her!‚Äù Kim enthused. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure she‚Äôd rather work for a trusted friend of the family than some summer job where they just want to take advantage of her.‚Äù

Neil nodded. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a good girl, never gets in trouble, maintains a perfect 4.0 GPA. And she doesn‚Äôt party, even though she has a rowdy roommate. She‚Äôll be a great influence on little Ollie,‚Äù he said, ruffling the kid‚Äôs hair.

‚ÄúHow old is she again?‚Äù Michael asked.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôll be turning twenty-one in October,‚Äù Kim beamed.

Michael didn‚Äôt hate the idea. She really did sound like a good kid. ‚ÄúWell, may I have her number? I‚Äôll give her a call and see what she thinks.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course. I‚Äôll text her to give her a heads-up,‚Äù said Neil.

Michael glanced at the pictures of the neighbors‚Äô daughter on the walls. She was a chubby young woman with glasses, dark auburn hair, and a nice smile. She looked like an archetypal bookworm, every bit as responsible as her parents claimed.

\*\*\*

Anelise was making notes for the thesis proposal that she would be writing over the summer. She had to turn it in after the final, but she just wasn‚Äôt pleased with it. She wanted something more, but didn‚Äôt know what.

When she was discussing her proposal with Professor Andrews, she had felt it was lacking something, some excitement or passion, some spark that ignited her soul.

Professor Andrews, on the other hand, said what she had would make a good final project. But Anelise didn‚Äôt want just good; she wanted her thesis to be great.

Anelise sighed as she went to get a cup of sweet tea, which she allowed herself to have once a day. She believed that if she didn‚Äôt limit herself, the weight loss she had worked so hard for would go down the drain.

She took a long sip, feeling thankful that her roommate and best friend, Leslie, was out having Sunday brunch with her ridiculously wealthy family and the apartment was quiet so she could stew in peace.

She was walking around her room, trying to clear her head to study for the rest of her finals, when her phone rang.

Without recognizing the number, but seeing the Chicago area code, she figured it could be the neighbor that her parents had said might call with an interesting proposal.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù she answered.

‚ÄúHello. Is this Anelise?‚Äù asked the caller in a deep baritone. Her name in that voice sent goosebumps tingling all over her body. She shook herself out of it. The stress of finals must be getting to her.

‚ÄúYes, this is Anelise. How can I help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy name is Michael Whitlock. Your parents gave me your number. I‚Äôm their neighbor,‚Äù he explained.

‚ÄúYes, they mentioned that you might be calling with a proposal. What can I do for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I know this is completely out of left field, but I‚Äôm in one hell of a bind. Your parents mentioned that you like kids and have done some babysitting jobs before. My nanny quit yesterday. She‚Äôs eloping, if you can believe it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awfully romantic,‚Äù she said with a smile.

He sighed. ‚ÄúVery. The problem is, I‚Äôm leaving for three months for work and she was supposed to come with us and watch my son, Ollie. Is that something you might be interested in? I‚Äôll pay you handsomely.""

She bit her lip, more money would be welcome. She had come to really enjoy shopping with Leslie since she had lost so much weight.

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm not sure... I‚Äôm going to be writing my master‚Äôs thesis‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. Your parents told me. They said you might like to know we‚Äôd be in London for the summer. You would get days off to explore and do research for your paper.‚Äù

‚ÄúSeriously?!‚Äù Analise took in a sharp breath.

‚ÄúYes, we‚Äôd leave in thirteen days, and I‚Äôd be paying you $1,500 per week. Food and accommodation would be covered by my company, of course. But I‚Äôll be working¬†*a lot*, and you‚Äôd be responsible for Ollie well into the nights.‚Äù",1,1746530076.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I am 30, and in my early 20s- even when going out - I would max out at 2 drinks, basically enough to feel a buzz but that‚Äôs all. I stopped smoking weed after a bad panic attack and that was 11 years ago- so I know I have it in me to stop something that I know is no longer servicing me.

But as of lately I feel shame. I‚Äôll catch myself needing a shooter (just one), or a mixed drink, then the buzz hits and it feels nice so I drink more. At first it was on a Friday, Saturday- now I find myself craving that need on a Wednesday. I am so ashamed to admit this but on a random Saturday morning I filled my coffee with liquor. I then quickly brushed my teeth and continued on with my morning, made sure to drink a lot of water and took a small bite of something. Having a full blown conversation a little buzzed with my roomates.I don‚Äôt know why. There is nothing going on in my personal life that is so bad that I would feel the need to drink.

Well this weekend became scary. I started noticing the brain fog- and I didn‚Äôt need a lot of alcohol to feel it. I had three cocktails on Friday and the next morning found myself riddled with anxiety and shame because I couldn‚Äôt remember a conversation I had. Then I started second guessing my own brain and that put a huge fear into me.

None of my close friends or loved ones would ever suspect me of having turned into this kind of person so this is more of a ‚Äúsilent‚Äù sobriety. So I guess this is ‚Äúday 2‚Äù of sobriety. Best of luck to anyone on this journey- it‚Äôs hard as shit. ",14,1746529991.0,stopdrinking,4,1.0,False

1kg1ssu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kg1ssu/why_is_calphalon_temp_iq_espresso_machine_review/,Why is Calphalon Temp iQ Espresso Machine Review the go-to option for coffee lovers?,"The **Calphalon BVCLECMPBM1 Espresso Machine** shines as a solid option for coffee lovers looking to bring the caf√© experience home. As someone who adores freshly brewed coffee, testing this espresso machine turned into a flavorful journey. From brewing a rich espresso to steaming velvety milk for cappuccinos, I‚Äôve explored its features intensively. It's an excellent appliance that delivers great functionality, but there‚Äôs a mix of highlights and areas for improvement to unpack.

**Design and Build Quality**

Sleek and modern, the espresso machine flaunts a stainless-steel finish that blends effortlessly into any kitchen aesthetic. It feels sturdy, though with an item weight of 21.8 pounds, moving it often might prove a hassle. The spacious water reservoir and intuitive dial interface make operation straightforward, even during my groggy, pre-coffee mornings. However, the portafilter, although functional, has a slightly flimsy aluminum build that doesn't scream ""premium."" Despite that, the caf√©-sized 58mm portafilter ensures even water dispersion, which I genuinely appreciated.

**Performance and Brewing Capabilities**

This espresso machine‚Äôs 15-bar Italian pump delivers notably rich shots of espresso with a decent crema. The thermoblock heating system coupled with PID temperature control ensures even heating throughout the brewing process. The gentle pre-infusion might sound like fancy coffee jargon, but essentially, it ensures optimal extraction of coffee flavors. Experimenting with the automated single and double-shot options made my morning routine smoother than ever. It's worth noting that while the flavor satisfies most taste buds, those chasing barista-level perfection might feel it falls just shy.

[Check Calphalon BVCLECMPBM1 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07ssvh7t1/)

**Integrated Grinder: A Convenient Feature**

One of my favorite aspects has to be the built-in conical burr grinder with 30 adjustable settings. Being able to grind fresh beans directly tailored to my taste preferences elevated the coffee experience significantly. Switching between grind consistencies helped me discover the nuances of different flavors hidden in beans. Strangely, while some reviews noted inconsistencies like spraying grounds during operation, it worked fine for me, though cleanup could be tidier.

**Good Aspects**

- Integrated grinder with extensive adjustability.
- Automatic shot options and a cup-warming tray for convenience.
- Thermoblock temperature stability ensures consistent heating.
- A powerful steam wand for frothing milk.

**Frothing and Milk Options**

I'm not exaggerating when I say the steam wand felt like unleashing my inner barista! Frothing milk for lattes and cappuccinos was both satisfying and effective. While testing it with almond and soy milk, the results were a creamy microfoam that held well. That said, mastering the right frothing technique required some trial and patience, especially for beginners. Including a thermometer for milk steaming would‚Äôve been a thoughtful touch.

**Negatives**

- Accessories such as the tamper feel basic and could be better.
- Aluminum portafilter lacks the heft of higher-end models.
- No non-pressurized filter baskets available due to compatibility issues.

**Usage and Maintenance**

Daily use has been almost effortless thanks to features like the volumetric control that automatically stops shots once they‚Äôre ready. Descaling every few months kept the machine performing at its best, which wasn‚Äôt overly daunting. Cleaning the grinder was a bit tricky, though, requiring extra attention to ensure no residual grounds lingered.

**Alternative Offerings**

Several comparable coffee machines fall into this price range, such as the Breville Bambino Plus and DeLonghi Dedica Espresso Machines. While the Breville offers superior milk texturing with its automatic wand, it doesn‚Äôt include an integrated grinder. On the other hand, the Dedica is more compact, making it ideal for limited counter spaces, though its smaller portafilter impacts water dispersion and flavor robustness. Where this machine excels is the built-in grinder, which neither of these alternatives provides at such value.

**Money's Worth**

For its price point, this espresso machine holds its own against competitors, especially for novice coffee enthusiasts or those upgrading from even more basic models. While additional costs for a high-quality separate grinder would otherwise bump up the investment, this combination machine balances price with functionality well.

1kg1slj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1kg1slj/delve_into_hupoaf_h87_wireless_earbuds_review_are/,Delve Into Hupoaf H87 Wireless Earbuds Review Are They Worth Your Workout Sessions,"Testing the **Hupoaf H87 Wireless Earbuds**, I found myself impressed by some of its features, skeptical about others, but ultimately intrigued by what it brought to the table. This isn't your average pair of Bluetooth earbuds; it seems crafted with outdoor adventurers and fitness fanatics in mind. After spending weeks sweating through jogs, bike rides, and even a drizzly afternoon hike, these earbuds proved their resilience. However, they're not perfect, as a few quirks became noticeable. Let‚Äôs unpack the good, the bad, and all the entertaining bits in between.

**Design and Comfort for High-Intensity Use**  
These wireless earbuds deserve a gold-star rating purely for their ear hook design, which remains secure during strenuous workouts. Personally, I‚Äôve struggled with earbuds that either fall out halfway through a session, or dig uncomfortably into my ears. That wasn‚Äôt the case here. The soft silicone material in the hook adds comfort without compromising stability. For someone like me, who spends a lot of time on the move‚Äîwhether running on the treadmill or attempting box jumps‚Äîthe secure fit allowed me to forget they were even there, which was a win in itself.

[**Looking for Hupoaf H87 Wireless Earbuds discounts? Check Amazon**.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0dp4v9wn4/)  

**Connectivity and Bluetooth Performance**  
Equipped with Bluetooth 5.4 technology, these earbuds pair with devices lightning fast and maintain an impressive connection range of up to 15 meters. I've paired them with my iPhone, iPad, and even my aging laptop without dropping a signal mid-run or during Zoom calls. However, I occasionally experienced very short hiccups while walking around the house. It didn‚Äôt ruin the overall experience, but it‚Äôs worth noting if you'll be using these with older Bluetooth devices.

**Immersive Sound and Noise Control**  
For wireless earbuds marketed as fitness-friendly, the sound quality genuinely exceeded expectations. The deep bass packed enough punch to keep me motivated‚Äîthere‚Äôs something empowering about blasting intense beats during a workout. Plus, the ENC noise-canceling mic worked brilliantly for calls in noisier settings like the gym. I even tested the earbuds in a crowded coffee shop (for science, of course), and boy, the microphone handled background chatter like a pro. Still, the passive noise cancellation from the ear tips wasn‚Äôt perfect. You‚Äôll notice ambient noise creeping in faintly, which might not satisfy those craving full immersion.

**Advantages**  
- Stable ear hook design suitable for vigorous activities.  
- Durable battery life‚Äîup to 50 hours including the charging case.  
- Water-resistant IP7 rating suitable for rain and sweat exposure.  

**Battery Life and Charging Features**  
Battery life was hands-down one of my favorite features. A single charge got me through 10 solid hours without interruption, and the case bumped it up to a collectively jaw-dropping 50 hours. Testing these over a weekend marathon of Netflix binging (don‚Äôt judge), they powered through effortlessly without needing a recharge until Monday. Even better, the USB-C fast charging feature meant I was back at full battery in just 90 minutes. That said, I couldn‚Äôt help but wish the charging case felt slightly sturdier‚Äîit‚Äôs lightweight, which felt precarious while tossing it into my gym bag.

**Drawbacks**  
- Minor Bluetooth hiccups with older devices.  
- Passive noise cancellation isn‚Äôt entirely foolproof.  
- Case could benefit from more robust construction.  

**Sports and Waterproof Features**  
If you‚Äôre an outdoor sports enthusiast, the IP7 waterproof rating will catch your attention. These earbuds survived sweat-heavy workouts and even light rain‚Äîno damage whatsoever. I suspect they‚Äôd even endure a brief accidental dip, though I didn‚Äôt dare conduct an impromptu swim test. Knowing they‚Äôre designed to handle such diverse environments heightened my confidence in their reliability for an active lifestyle.

**Competitors**  
Stacking these against similar sport-centric earbuds like the Beats Powerbeats Pro, the Hupoaf H87 delivers great value. While the Powerbeats boast slightly better sound quality and noise isolation, they‚Äôre also significantly pricier and lack the ultra-long battery life of 50 hours offered here. Compared to JBL Endurance Peak 2, the Hupoaf H87 wins with superior comfort and ENC microphone clarity, although JBL‚Äôs bass-driven sound may appeal more to bass heads. Personally, I‚Äôd lean towards the H87 simply for how it stays glued to my ears and doesn‚Äôt over-complicate things unnecessarily.

**Worth the Price?**  
When it comes to affordable quality, these earbuds hit the sweet spot. They provide solid tech, extra-long battery life, and comfort, all bundled in a budget-friendly option. Could they improve in some areas? Sure. But even high-end alternatives aren‚Äôt immune to flaws, and for what the H87 delivers in terms of reliability and usability, it's definitely worth considering.

It was a sunny spring day and I would wake up at about 6.30 am excited for the day ahead. I quietly went downstairs to watch some tv. For the first half an hour there wouldn‚Äôt be much other than teleshopping. But after that I would watch an episode of lilo and stitch on a channel called Disney cinemagic. At about 7.30 my sister would come downstairs and we would switch over to Disney channel to watch Hannah Montana. Eventually my parents would come downstairs to make a coffee and my dad would sit and watch Disney channel too as he secretly enjoyed it.

Eventually we would have breakfast and then I would head upstairs to put on a pair of 3 quarter shorts and a light blue Umbro tshirt. I would spike my hair using garnier extreme hold gel. Then we would all hop in the car to go to the shopping centre (mall) and after that we we would go over to my nanas bungalow at about lunchtime. My nana will have made us all a cup of tea and some sandwiches. She‚Äôd be talking to my mum and dad in the living room while midsummer murders was on the tv quietly in the background.

After about an hour we would head back home and I would go on my bike heading up the top of my road to call for my mate. We‚Äôd chill at his house, ride around the local area and buy some sweets from the local corner shop. After a few hours at about 5 o clock I‚Äôd get back home. My mum had run a bath for me and made me a cup of tea. After my bath I‚Äôd chill in my pjs with my sister watch wizards of waverly place or Zack and Cody. My mum would be upstairs in the shower. My dad would be in the kitchen making enchiladas and I could smell the peppers and garlic.

After about an hour we‚Äôd sit and eat in the living room while watching a family movie. I remember one time watching the 60s version of race to witch mountain. Which as I kid I thought it would be boring but it was not. We‚Äôd then head to bed.",1,1746529845.0,00snostalgia,0,1.0,False

So instead I tried cutting down. Each time I would get an expensive pack and I would made a promise to myself that I only smoke two per day, but my addiction was too strong for going back. (I used to smoke one cigarette every month for two years, and 4 a week for one year). So the pack was gone in one day.

This time I‚Äôm on my 8th day. No sign of withdrawal (maybe a little brain fog), no depression (even though I have every reason to be depressed), and no temptation to smoke one. It‚Äôs my 27th birthday in a few days and I couldn‚Äôt feel any better. I used to smoke to relieve stress.

1kg1ray,https://www.reddit.com/r/raypeat/comments/1kg1ray/doing_honey_diet_from_keto/,Doing honey diet from keto,"I've been low PUFA keto for the last 6 month and decided to try the honey diet (Honey+ fruit untill you eat something with protein and fat in that afternoon). I'm 10%B.F and was eating mostly at maintenance. It's been great in some area and less great in other areas but I want to try other things. I'm fine with restricting carbs for like if it means feeling better but when I see protocols that seem to make sense then why not try it out?

 I've noticed many different things, some expected, some not:



|Symptom|What I experiences|What keto folks would believe|What honey diet predicts|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Hunger|Not that hungry. Often completely full but did feel it sometimes. At the end of the day I was not even hungry without having eaten my normal calories. I did force them down though because supper is the only meal with nutrients on this diet. |\- Research suggest my metabolic adaptations  would make me keep hunger levels relatively stable, dirty keto folks would way the second I touched the bottle i would have gained 5lbs|Ravenous hunger|
|Metabolism|I do get somewhat hyperactive. There were definitly ups and downs (but I just go take more sugar when I'm on the way down). I did keel like this on keto if in the morning I had only coffee with cream, but not if I had eggs, cheese or Greek yogurt.|I would et a high and then completely crash. Tbh before going on keto I used to experience this but I'm not having this right now|what happened. Anabology (go see him on X) even thinks a honey only diet feels very much like a cream only diet as long as protein is low|
|Skin/gums|My gums began bleeding on the 2nd day. I had this allmy life and it had stopped on keto. Acne kindof came back but I blame confounding variables ( ate too much on one day and kept eating sugar when I started the protein and fat. Also had a lot of dairy, wich I like but don't tolerate too well).It does seem to be stabilizing now that I'm actually following the rules|Probably nothing after only a day|Nothing that I'm aware of. But eating the sugar with the large portion of protein and fat can keep blood sugar elevated for a while wich increases glycation. |
|Water / electrolytes|I never knew on keto wich electrolyte was out of wack. Sometimes taking more potassium made it better sometimes it made it worse. Sometimes the answer was to increase or decrease sodium. From what seemed to be the same symptoms. To give keto credit, I had no electrolyte problems before I tried my 1st electrolyte supplement. People told me I would feel supercharged so I tried it and ever since then no mater if I tried increasing/decreasing any electrolytes, I almost always had issues. All of these games stopped within 12hrs of starting the honey diet|keto folks predicted electrolyte supplements were good and I was feeling fine on keto until I tried one. Just one. even a week  after stopping the I still felt like shit and going back to balance was a random process I feel. |Carbs facilitate water retention|
|Weight|It's only been 3 days, any noticeable changes is probably water weight . But gained 1kg|||
|Gym|On keto I I workouts often felt mid, but the speed at which I progress in the gym did not change from before keto. It's as if a day you'r tired you now achieve as much as before. Did not notice anything by going on honey diet|||

  
I will definitely keep keto in my tool box but seeing that completely separating carbs from the rest does not seem to cause energy crashes is another tool in the tool box. I also always felt more satiated on a high protein diet (I bodybuild a bit) but have noticed in the past if I would start the day with protein and not much else I would feel stressed all day, so keeping them further in the day when other food is already in the system seems good. Just thought sharing the comparison with you guys would be nice. 

I also see keto people just go low carb and put the carbs around training with great results so I might try that next. My goal is simply to broaden the range of things I can do while feeling good.

Gatsby enjoys his personal space under the coffee table (though it took a few bumps on the head to learn the table is lower to the ground than he is standing). He comes out for pets and play, and does a great job retreating to regulate. And he's so polite about it, too. 

The first night, woke up crying at 4am because he wanted to play with the tunnels I'd put in the other room. As a compromise, I put on a video of songbirds on my tablet and his eyeballs were glued to that til I fell back asleep lol. 

He woke up crying a few hours ago and pawing me awake. It was time for me to to experience his version of cuddling involves pressing his entire body into me as hard as he can, while purring like crazy and kneading my skin. üòÇ 

Gatsby will turn 1 year old on May 15th! I'm not sure what to do for him since he already has everything he needs (even though doesn't know about the toothbrush...)

As someone who has a history of erratic blood pressure readings, consistency and ease of use are crucial, and this little device has become a daily ritual. It‚Äôs the kind of gadget that you instinctively reach for, especially if you‚Äôre obsessive about your health. While the gadget boasts a range of features and delivers accurate readings, there are a few aspects that had me raising an eyebrow every now and then.

**Compact and User-Friendly Design**  
Everything about the design screams convenience. At just 5.9 x 1.9 x 1.1 inches and a weight of 1 pound, this monitor is highly portable. I found it easy to carry around, and it fits snugly in my travel bag. The LED screen is clear, even in low light, which helps for those groggy early mornings when my eyes are barely open. Pairing it with the cuff that accommodates arms from 22-42 cm meant I had no issues with fit, though I think folks with smaller arms might find it oversized. The single-button operation kept things simple, but simplicity also meant that advanced options are tucked away and require some patience to set up initially.

**High-Quality Performance with Accurate Readings**  
Health monitoring tools are only as good as their accuracy, and this device didn‚Äôt disappoint in that regard. The FDA-cleared status certainly lives up to its name. I tested it against a hospital-grade device (thanks to a nurse friend), and readings were consistently similar within a point or two. It claimed to deliver readings within 30 seconds, and I found this claim fairly accurate. It has yet to glitch or mess up a measurement, even on mornings when my coffee kicked in faster than usual. 

**Highlights**  
- FDA-cleared accuracy means peace of mind.  
- Portable and lightweight design makes it ideal for travel.  
- LED screen is perfect for all light conditions.  
- Cuff fits a wide range of arm sizes.  

[Check Checkme BP2A Blood Pressure Monitor price on Amazon.](https://thepressureexperts.com/link/b0by2rlq97/)  

**Target User and Customization**  
This product is definitely designed for adults, not for kids or petite individuals. While testing with my cousin who has smaller arms, the cuff didn‚Äôt sit quite right, which affected accuracy. For my medium-built size, it worked perfectly each time. The device also supports multi-user record management, and the ViHealth app is a lifesaver in this aspect. It allows unlimited data storage, making tracking trends over time practical‚Äîespecially useful when my physician wanted a quick download of my monthly stats. However, enabling Bluetooth pairing the first time had me googling for a guide; it wasn‚Äôt as intuitive as I‚Äôd hoped.

**Green Life and Charging Efficiency**  
Battery performance really grabbed my attention. On a single full charge, the monitor can squeeze out a mammoth 300 measurements‚Äîimpressive, right? I‚Äôm terrible at remembering to recharge things, but this stamina means I only recharge it once every couple of weeks. Nights when I accidentally left it on were no problem either, as it shuts off automatically to conserve power. Just watch out for that DC 5V charging restriction‚Äîuse anything else, and you might be out of luck.

**Shortcomings**  
- Cuff doesn‚Äôt cater to very petite arm sizes.  
- Bluetooth setup isn‚Äôt very beginner-friendly.  
- Necessary precautions for charging can be a stumbling block.  

**Product Alternatives**  
Compared to the Omron Evolv, which I tested last year, the Checkme BP2A makes a strong bid for the top. It‚Äôs less bulky, and data connectivity surpasses the Omron in ease of report generation. However, while Omron offers an equally accurate device, its app interface feels slightly outdated. The Beurer BM67 was another contender I tested; it provides voice-guided instructions, a feature absent in this monitor. Still, in terms of battery life and portability, the Checkme BP2A stands miles ahead of these.

**Bang for the Buck**  
This monitor sits comfortably in the mid-range price tier among similar devices. Considering its accuracy, adjustability, and advanced multi-user capabilities, I‚Äôd call it a case of smart spending. While some competitors may offer slightly posher features, this device focuses on dependable, straightforward functionality without complicating your life. If your goal is to monitor your blood pressure accurately while benefiting from stellar battery performance and data syncing, this choice justifies its price tag.

She was exhausted after working a shift at her part-time job.

In the middle of a regular dream she began to feel nervous as her old dream consumed her peaceful sleep. She tried to move her arms and legs, but it seemed as if they were paralyzed. She was sweating and breathing hard, slipping further into a panic attack. She kept trying to wake herself up from her recurring nightmare, but she could never manage to do it. The longer the dream went on the scared she became.

Suddenly, she sat up in bed with a jolt, waking from her nightmare hyperventilating due to the fear racing through her veins. She wiped the sweat from her forehead as she looked around her room. It was empty, there was no one else there. She was all alone in this studio apartment, just like an orphan. She had no one who could wake her from her nightmares or tell her that everything was okay. She drew her knees up to her chest then wrapped her arms tightly around them. She sat in her empty apartment like that for a while. It was becoming a daily occurrence, the nightmares, which was why tears did not fall from her eyes.

It was 4am. She knew she would not be able to get back to sleep after her nightmare, so she got up and went over to her desk. She opened her notebook and textbooks so that she could work on her studies. She was trying hard to focus on her coursework so that she could forget her nightmares, but it kept replaying over and over again in her mind. She got up from her chair and went to the bathroom and looked at herself in the mirror while brushing her teeth and washing her face.

She finally felt a bit more refreshed and went to the kitchen to make herself a cup of coffee, then back to her studies again. She was fully focused on her studies now, trying to understand debits and credits.

She glanced over at the clock and realized it was 6am. So she closed her books and notebook then stepped out onto her balcony. She yawned as she took in the sun shining through the clouds in a beautiful way, it would be a good day. She smiled, everything felt too good to be true.

A cool breeze brushed against her face and blew her hair around, the sound of the birds chirping echoed in her ears, livening up the morning. She closed her eyes as she felt the wind. The cool morning air was always invigorating.

She took a deep breath, filling her lunges with the cold air before returning inside after enjoying the beautiful view. She figured that she should take a bath first, then she would make herself some breakfast. She took a shower then came out of the bathroom wearing a towel.",1,1746529224.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

So... grab some coffee (or tequila), light a candle, or punch air if you need to‚Ä¶ Because the fuckery I‚Äôm about to share is the kind that will leave you Googling, ‚ÄúHow to hex a recruiter?‚Äù while downing shots as 2AM.

I‚Äôve been in recruiter hell lately. It‚Äôs that shady place between ‚Äúmaybe this might be the one,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don't think I'm too old to strip...‚Äù 

I‚Äôm talking *Saxon Global, Cyboticx, Compunnel, Inc., Infostride, The Fountain Group, Clifyx, Cerebra Consulting, Veridian Tech Solutions, Hornet Staffing, Ask Consulting, United Software Group, InfiCare Health Staffing, TQC ‚Äì Total Quality Staffing*‚Ä¶ All the usual suspects.

They pop up like roaches at midnight: ‚ÄúSaw your resume, you‚Äôre a great fit!‚Äù --> Ghosted. Lied to. RTRs signed and then tossed into the same pit Bane threw Batman in. Just recruiters who treat job seekers like some sick ass warm body CAPTCHA test.

‚Äì Human? Check.  
‚Äì Breathing? Check.   
‚Äì Has WiFi? Check?  
‚Äì Dignity? (Optional)

So now? I vet every. single. one. I‚Äôm talking LinkedIn checks, website reviews, scanning their posts/comments, etc., 

\[Enter DatamanUSA\] \*crowd boos

Yesterday, I got a completely unsolicited email from Robert Kashyap ‚Äî who also goes by *Praveen* on LinkedIn ‚Äî a ‚ÄúTechnical Recruiter‚Äù from DatamanUSA, about a long-term contract Business Analyst role (that's hiring immediately) with a state government‚Äôs Office of Technology.

What did I find?  
‚Äì No Google reviews.  
‚Äì No ability to leave feedback about candidate experience.  
‚Äì A sketchy-ass website.  
‚Äì A recruiter more evasive than a politician on camera with a handful of \*meow.

But because I‚Äôm still tragically optimistic, I reply. I send my resume. And I ask ‚Äî clearly and kindly ‚Äî what DatamanUSA‚Äôs candidate engagement process looks like. You know, like every trauma-seasoned adult who‚Äôs tired of being emotionally waterboarded by strangers via email. Robert/Praveen hits me back within minutes: *‚ÄúYour resume looks good!‚Äù*  
‚Ä¶Cool, cool‚Äîbut not one fucking word about my actual inquiry.

So I push again ‚Äî this time with receipts. I tell him I went straight to the official state HR website, where a bold notice from the Governor states: ALL HIRING ‚Äî full-time *and* contract ‚Äî is FROZEN (and has been for over a month).

So, Sir‚Ä¶ how is this job even open?

Instead of answering, he immediately tries to pivot to a phone call. Even though I SPECIFICALLY said: I want everything in writing in my initial response. Sir. The bullshit is LOUD, and I smell it!  

Snoop Dogg backstage at the Source Awards, LOUD!   
A-MINORRRRR at the SuperBowl, LOUD!

At this point, it‚Äôs obvious what this is: r√©sum√© phishing.  
This was never about filling a real role. This was about collecting resumes, farming RTRs, and exploiting desperate jobseekers who are already hanging on by a thread.

So I did what every jobseeker dreams of but rarely does:  
I called his ass out ‚Äì professionally. *In writing.*  
Then I BCC‚Äôd the state‚Äôs Director of Human Resources‚Äîbecause if you're going to drag their name into your fuckery, someone official deserves to know. 

And guess what?  
The HR Director responded privately and CONFIRMED that yes, the hiring freeze is real‚Äîand they‚Äôll be looking into what I shared because this company has not and has never been used to source candidates.

But let‚Äôs talk about what‚Äôs really disgusting here:  
In this hellscape of a job market, companies like DatamanUSA (and the ones named above) are weaponizing people‚Äôs pain and financial instability. People are choosing between groceries and gas, while these fuck trophies are weaponizing survival; gambling with the last bits of hope people have left!

So no, I‚Äôm not just pissed‚ÄîI‚Äôm fucking *incandescent!* 

Candidates: Ask questions. Demand receipts. Screenshot everything. Vet every recruiter like your future depends on it‚Äîbecause it absolutely *does*.

To DatamanUSA, Robert (Praveen) Kashyup, and every bottom-feeding, r√©sum√©-farming excuse for a recruiting agency/recruiter playing games with people‚Äôs survival:  
I see you.  
I *clocked* you.  
And I'm not whispering about it in the group chat anymore‚ÄîI'm bringing this shit to the town square.  
You're standing between people and their rent, the ability to care for themselves/their families, their peace of mind...  
So no, I'm not being polite, nor am I giving grace.

The ""family friends"" initiated everything and came to our home along with girl's father. They asked me all the usual questions and I answered honestly.
So couple of days later they shared girl's pics and insisted to setup a date for a meet-up.

Later I got to know that the girl is a follower of a spiritual sect( radha Swami) and has already taken ""naam""  from there. This made me bit sceptical of this whole AM thing. Because in my experience such spiritual sect followers are very strict in their way of life and usually try/force others to join them as well.

Anyways, I thought it would be wrong to assume things without meeting her. So we setup a date to meet .

On the day of meet, got to know from my mother that her family will be there as well. I mean, I selected a cafe and was expecting a 1-1 meet. But My mom told me that her mother and the whole of our "" family friends"" ( which are girl's bua/fufa and cousins) will be there as well. I was so irritated but my mom insisted me that lets go. 

So we went to that cafe. Me , my mom. Girl and probably 6 of her family members.

After super awkward half an hour, I said let's order something , as cafe servers were asking again and again to order and all of us were probably holding their3 tables.  So I ordered coffee for everyone.

Then , the ""elders"" asked me and her to sit on a seperate table and figure out if we can spend our lives together. So we moved to a isolated table.

We sat, exchanged formal smiles . I initiated by saying Hi and asked her name. The first thing she asked me was "" Aapki salary kitni hai? "" . I was taken aback, not by the question but by her  tone.  I answered her. Then I tried to carry the conversation and even she started talking.

So as the conversation moved forward, I told her she can ask me anything and I'll be honest with her. I also requested her that whatever personal things we talk will remain between both of us  and we won't share those secrets/personal things with anyone. SHE PROMISED that she agrees.

She asked me do I drink alcohol?  I told her I drink very occasionally. Probably once or twice a year with very special people and on very special occasions.

She made a face and asked me "" chhod nahi sakte""

I told her honestly that, it's not an issue with me, I love to taste expensive alcohols and whenever my brother comes from abroad he always  brings some really nice high level alcohols and we both love to drink it together.  Else, I don't drink. She made a face again.

Coffee arrived, we kept talking. I noticed she  has not touched her coffee, I asked her and she said it's hot and she'll drink it . But she didn't even touch the cup and left the whole cup of coffee, which she selected by herself.  

Later , after our talks, we went back where other people were sitting, Bill arrived, I paid it ( no big deal) but I felt weird that all the people from her side automatically assumed that I should pay the bill and none of them even as a formality insisted to pay. They were seven people and we were two.

Our meeting ended and we came back. My mother asked me how was she, I said I need time.

My parents have strict no alcohol policy at home and me and my brother , whenever we drink it's a very secret and carefully  managed thing.

Few days later, my dad asked me out of the blue that do I drink alcohol? I said no. He said everyone is saying that aapke bete sharaab peete hain.  I said who?

Later my dad told me that the girl's parents  and our family friends are saying that. I realised that she broke the promise and told everyone about my alcohol confession. I was so angry.

Later her cousin called me and asked If I promise to leave alcohol they're ready for the marriage. I said  NO.  And told him that it won't work out between us so it's a  No from my side.

I had to tell so many lies to my parents to convince them that I don't drink alcohol.

1kg1j27,https://www.reddit.com/r/QualitySeek/comments/1kg1j27/whats_the_best_affordable_plasticfree_electric/,What‚Äôs the Best Affordable Plastic-Free Electric Stainless Steel Kettle in the US?,"  
Many people who are trying to minimize plastic in their kitchen often find themselves asking: *Is there a good electric stainless steel kettle that‚Äôs both affordable and truly plastic-free?* This question pops up regularly in sustainability-focused communities and among health-conscious buyers. The goal is simple‚Äîboil water without letting it come into contact with plastic components, all while staying within a reasonable budget.

My take on this is straightforward: yes, such kettles do exist, but finding the right balance between cost, material quality, and functionality requires a bit of digging. For example, if you're seeking a kettle that‚Äôs predominantly made of 18/10 stainless steel, avoids plastic parts in the water chamber, and is compatible with U.S. voltage standards (110‚Äì120V), your options are limited‚Äîbut not nonexistent. Wide-pour spouts (as opposed to gooseneck styles often designed for pour-over coffee) are also a valid preference and can further narrow the selection.

While high-end models might push past the $150 mark, there are more affordable alternatives in the $40‚Äì$80 range that meet most of these criteria. Brands like *Mueller*, *Ovente*, or *Secura* have models that are largely stainless steel with minimal or no plastic touching the water, and they often receive solid reviews for durability and usability. The key is to check specifications closely and scan reviews to confirm whether internal plastic parts are present.

In summary, you're not alone in asking this. The demand for affordable, plastic-free electric kettles is growing, and while the market isn‚Äôt flooded with perfect solutions, there are a few solid choices available that don‚Äôt require compromising your budget or your standards.",1,1746528929.0,QualitySeek,0,1.0,False

""No, I don't want to go out"" I whined and covered the duvet all over my body but once again Ruby hauled it away.

""Shut up girl and get your ass off the bed, we are going out. You have been indoors for far too long"" she said and walked to my wardrobe.

""Girl, you need clothes. What are these?""¬†

""Get out from there Ruby. Just go to the club without me"" I cried more.

""That club isn't the type of club you go to every day. This is a legit place with lots of money, you don't get to mingle with the rich every day. I'm not letting you miss out on this opportunity"" she said adamantly and kept going through my clothes.

""Moreover, you can get a good guy you can screw over there, not just any guy but one with the dough...""

""yes, this cloth is perfect"" she screamed.

""Ruby...."" I called.

""No buts, we are leaving for that club now,"" she said and I gave up.

Talking to Ruby was a waste of time on my part, she already made up her mind and it was either I followed her or I won't sleep.

I got up slowly from the bed and went into the bathroom to take my bath.

I'm Allison Mason, I live alone in my apartment and I work at a coffee shop. I hate my job, don't think I like it one bit, but it was a means to an end. I just had to cope with it till I have gotten to where I wanted.

I'm 25years old and no I don't have a boyfriend. So far, I believe men are never worth loving, they were selfish and wicked and I would never imagine being in any form of relationship with them. I could flirt and have s\*x with them, then I would drop them like they were nothing and we would all go our separate ways after getting what we wanted.

I finished taking my bath and stepped out of the bathroom, Ruby was sitting with my cloth in her hands. She was so impatient.

I wasn't feeling like going out, I needed a break, but again, Ruby was not going to let me stay home.

I applied lotion on my body and brushed my hair before putting on the cloth she brought out for me.

""What is this? I'm not wearing a gown,"" I said adamantly when I saw the gown she had picked out. It was a black gown with lots of openings with a strapless hand, and a v\_shape opening at the back and front. I got the gown months ago and have never really worn it since I got it.

""You need to look classy and fine. It's not that bad, put it on"" she commanded. I sighed and took the clothes from her.

When I wore the gown, it was indeed beautiful, it hugged my body and exposed my tiny curves.

""That's it baby girl"" she shrieked at my appearance and tossed my heels over to me. I wore it and picked up a marching purse, then I applied just a little amount of makeup and we both left the house, boarding a cab and straight to the club, she didn't stop ranting about.

When we got there, I knew immediately that it wasn't a place for us. It was for the wealthy, influential, and famous.

""Hey, are you sure we got an invite here?"" I quickly asked Ruby as we walked into the place. I didn't want any form of embarrassment and I would have gladly turned back to my house.

""Yes, I met a rich guy and he gave me an invite. We are going to be fine"" she whispered and pulled me along to the door.

The guards and security asked us so many questions before we were permitted to go in, it was irritating, especially with how they looked at us. Like we were some trash wrapped in a pretty dress, at a place where we shouldn't be.

""Ruby, you made it,"" a man said coming out from the club. The guards immediately gave way and allowed us in. Money spoke volumes, lots of volumes.

""Hi, am Michael"" he introduced himself to me and stretched his hand towards me.

""I'm Allison,"" I said loudly against the music, giving him my hands.

""It's my pleasure, you are very beautiful,"" he said and raised my hands to his lips and kissed them.

I smirked at his approach, such a Playboy.

I smiled at him and withdrew my hands. Then he turned around and led the way into the hall.

When I got in there, I was suddenly very happy for wearing what I wore. The people in there were filthy rich, their clothes were classy and they looked flawless. I knew I didn't belong in that league of people and it made me feel so uncomfortable, what would have been worse was if I had looked different.

He took us to the place he sat with his friends. They were all with girls and drinks and stripers and drugs. We got introduced to everyone and I took my seat, ordered a drink, and nodded my head to the music with my phone in my hands. I wasn't doing much with the phone but it kept me busy since Ruby was busy with Michael and the others had people they were occupied with already. I went through my phone, sipping my drink which wasn't so strong. I had to take something with less alcohol, I had a feeling, Rubby would follow Michael home and I needed a clear head to get home by myself.

People were dancing and rocking and smooching, strippers did their jobs and so did the others. I remained seated when a waiter came with a glass of what I was already having.

""I didn't order for that"" I screamed, again, the music was loud

""Yes, you didn't. But a man there asked me to give it to you"" he replied me pointing in a particular direction but I couldn't see anybody.

""Please return the drink, I'm done here"" I yelled and got up from my seat. I was tired of sitting still and the songs were already getting to me. I gulped down the last of my drink and stepped gently onto the dance floor.

I jumped, danced, moved, and whined my sexy waist to myself without getting interrupted. I wasn't looking for that anyway so it was fun for me before I felt someone behind me, and hands wrapped around my waist. I stopped immediately and felt irritated, I mean, who gave him the right to touch me?

I took his hands off my waist and turned to face him and maybe shout at whoever it was. My eyes met his perfect eyes, he had amusement in his eyes and it got me worked up. I was going to talk or shout at him but I just walked away from him.

""Excuse me, wait up,"" he said drawing me by my arms. I hated that touch, he kept touching me like he owned my body. I looked down at his hands, at where it held mine and he could tell I didn't like it.

""Don't act like such a saint"" he simply said and removed his hands from my arms. His voice sounded so proud and pompous.

I didn't give him a reply, I wasn't sure talking to such people was a reasonable idea, I was pissed as it was already. I just walked back to where I was sitting.

""Playing hard to get huh? he screamed above the music.

""You can't resist me all too long, you are just like the others sweetheart.."" he screamed and I paused in my tracks. But I wasn't going to show that what he said got to me, he was a Playboy who saw women as nothing, I was a Playgirl. Two could play that game.

I turned around and smiled at him with my hands to my waist. I could feel eyes on us, we were standing far from each other and his shouting had got people's attention and I could bet they all wanted to know what was happening. I felt my heart beating fast as more eyes kept staring at us, then the music went down to my surprise.

I made a post a while back about my wife dragging up things from the past, and being not very nice in general. There were two things I forgot to add and I'd like some advice tbh. 

Firstly, she wants me to leave her alone, no sex, no hugs, no kissing, no chatting, she just wants space. I give her this, and go about my day doing my own thing, then when we have an arguement she says the reason she wants me to leave her alone is because I've apparently emotionally checked out, and it's unattractive... So she says she doesn't want me near her. This confuses the hell out of me. Lately I've given up all games, all TV, all activities, barely hold my phone in my hand, it's just dedicated to her and the house but then she says I'm only being ""good"" so I can have sex, which isn't true at all. She continues to push me away, then brings it up later down the line. 

Also, in regards to sex, one of the things that has come up recently is how she's made me feel like I've sexually assaulted her, which really hurts. I can't remember what we were discussing, but I said something like ""ok, I'll give you space and let you initiate when you're ready"" and she says ""I'm NEVER in the mood, I only say that to keep you happy, do you realise how traumatic it is to feel like that? Just because I initiated before doesn't mean I actually want it"".

It's NEVER been my intention to make her feel this way, I've never physically forced her, never really coerced her (aside from the odd joke over the years, such as ""yeah I'll do the garden, maybe later you can join me in the shower?"" Type thing... Which has never happened anyway). 

Wtf do I do? She won't accept any form of counselling, I'm desperate for affection, both physically and emotionally, we can't split for various reasons, plus I REALLY don't want to just see my kids at weekends. Day to day our lives are ok, it's not like a CONSTANT battleground, but just EVERYTHING I request is met with a ""No"", and I mean everything, as pathetic as it sounds she won't even make me a coffee :( 

I've tried and tried to talk to her, I've tried to alter myself to the best of my ability over the years, and of course I still make mistakes, but I just personally feel there's zero effort on her part. I did say to her the other day that has to LET me love her if she wants to feel loved, but she told me that was bullshit (? I don't know why). 

Then, as salty and jealous as this sounds, she spends most of her time reading smut about some male kpop idol she's obsessed with, which I can't say I understand but it's not my business to say how she spends her time, but I feel almost replaced by it. I'm NOT implying erotic fiction WILL replace me in general, but she makes it a priority, which is fine and dandy if that's what she enjoys... But why then is it an issue for me to play a game for a little in the night? She says I'd rather play that game than spend time with her, yet any time I ask if she would like to do anything in the night, or even just sit together doing separate things she says no. I just can't seem to win. 

I'm sorry for rambling but I just feel so lost. I've probably missed a few things out, so I'll try to answer as much as I can. ",0,1746528237.0,Marriage,19,0.5,False

""No, I don't want to go out"" I whined and covered the duvet all over my body but once again Ruby hauled it away.  
  
""Shut up girl and get your ass off the bed, we are going out. You have been indoors for far too long"" she said and walked to my wardrobe.  
  
""Girl, you need clothes. What are these?""¬†  
  
""Get out from there Ruby. Just go to the club without me"" I cried more.  
  
""That club isn't the type of club you go to every day. This is a legit place with lots of money, you don't get to mingle with the rich every day. I'm not letting you miss out on this opportunity"" she said adamantly and kept going through my clothes.  
  
""Moreover, you can get a good guy you can screw over there, not just any guy but one with the dough...""  
  
""yes, this cloth is perfect"" she screamed.  
  
""Ruby...."" I called.  
  
""No buts, we are leaving for that club now,"" she said and I gave up.  
  
Talking to Ruby was a waste of time on my part, she already made up her mind and it was either I followed her or I won't sleep.  
  
I got up slowly from the bed and went into the bathroom to take my bath.  
  
I'm Allison Mason, I live alone in my apartment and I work at a coffee shop. I hate my job, don't think I like it one bit, but it was a means to an end. I just had to cope with it till I have gotten to where I wanted.  
  
I'm 25years old and no I don't have a boyfriend. So far, I believe men are never worth loving, they were selfish and wicked and I would never imagine being in any form of relationship with them. I could flirt and have s\*x with them, then I would drop them like they were nothing and we would all go our separate ways after getting what we wanted.  
  
I finished taking my bath and stepped out of the bathroom, Ruby was sitting with my cloth in her hands. She was so impatient.  
  
I wasn't feeling like going out, I needed a break, but again, Ruby was not going to let me stay home.  
  
I applied lotion on my body and brushed my hair before putting on the cloth she brought out for me.  
  
""What is this? I'm not wearing a gown,"" I said adamantly when I saw the gown she had picked out. It was a black gown with lots of openings with a strapless hand, and a v\_shape opening at the back and front. I got the gown months ago and have never really worn it since I got it.

Don‚Äôt take it too seriously ‚Äî just let it be what it is.

A few worldbuilding notes to set the tone:

1. Isla is the only Giftia to break the ""technological lifespan limit."" She's fully self-aware, legally recognized as human, and capable of open-ended personal growth.

2. Yes, she and Tsukasa got married. No, it wasn‚Äôt controversial in this setting.

3.  Sakura is their daughter ‚Äî a second-generation Giftia.

\- She wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúbuilt‚Äù in a lab.

\- She was assembled and developed at the nano-scale within Isla‚Äôs body, thanks to a secret, self-evolving ‚Äúbirth module‚Äù Isla installed herself (and didn‚Äôt tell Tsukasa about until later).

\- She literally grew and was born, in a way that blurs the line between machine and life.

Story Begin:

Although Isla and Sakura are legally recognized as humans, due to hardware limitations, they still need to visit the workshop periodically for necessary check-ups and maintenance‚Äîjust like some humans have to go to the hospital for regular checkups.

Of course, neither of them really minds. That‚Äôs just how existence works for them.

Night. In the Mizugaki household living room.

Sakura sat cross-legged on the sofa, flipping through her maintenance records, looking unusually thoughtful. Isla sat next to her, absentmindedly playing with Sakura‚Äôs hair while watching her daughter's serious face.

Tsukasa was at the dining table, sipping tea and waiting for the cr√®me caramel in the oven to finish baking‚Äîa post-dinner dessert.

""Mom,"" Sakura suddenly looked up, eyes sharp as she stared at Isla.

""Hm?"" Isla instinctively caught a strand of Sakura‚Äôs hair that had slipped through her fingers.

""You told Dad you're one of the first prototype units, right? So why is your serial number 7940?""

Isla blinked, clearly never having thought about it before. ""Eh‚Ä¶?""

""My number is 339251,"" Sakura continued, flipping open the document to show her parents.

""But the numbering system for mass-production Giftias looks totally different from ours. Does that mean there‚Äôs some hidden logic to the numbering?""

Isla was momentarily speechless. She turned to Tsukasa.

Tsukasa slowly put down his teacup, frowning as he thought. ‚ÄúHmm... 7940 and 339251... You're right, they don‚Äôt sound like they follow a manufacturing batch pattern.‚Äù

Sakura rested her chin on her palm, her face serious. ‚ÄúIn traditional AI logic, serial numbers usually follow some sort of standard‚Äîotherwise, how do you manage units efficiently? But if there‚Äôs no clear rule behind them, that would mean...‚Äù

She trailed off.

The room suddenly felt heavier, like a mystery had quietly opened in the middle of the home.

Isla tapped the table thoughtfully. ‚ÄúNow that you mention it‚Ä¶ I never really wondered where my number came from. Should we call my mom? You know, your Grandma Moegi.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Sakura immediately picked up her phone and skillfully dialed Dr. Moegi Yu.

After a few rings, the familiar voice of a woman came through the speaker.

‚ÄúHello? My little granddaughter? What are you calling for so late at night?‚Äù

Sakura spoke with utmost seriousness. ‚ÄúGrandma, we‚Äôre analyzing the logic behind Giftia serial numbers. Mine is 339251, Mom‚Äôs is 7940. Can you tell us the logic behind those numbers?‚Äù

A one-second pause. Then a soft cough.

‚ÄúAhem‚Ä¶ So, uh, have you all had dinner?‚Äù

‚ÄúGrandma, please don‚Äôt dodge the question,‚Äù Sakura replied sharply. She tapped the speaker button so everyone in the house could hear.

‚ÄúAh, um, how‚Äôs your dad? How‚Äôs Tsukasa treating Isla? How‚Äôs school lately, Sakura? If you‚Äôre stressed about studying, why not come intern at my lab? We‚Äôre short-staffed these days. And, uh‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúGrandma!‚Äù Sakura locked eyes on the phone screen like a hawk.

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù

Another moment of silence.

Then, a very suspicious laugh.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Do you really want to know?‚Äù Dr. Moegi‚Äôs voice carried a hint of restrained chaos.

‚ÄúOf course!‚Äù Isla and Sakura responded in unison.

And then, the laughter broke through.

‚ÄúHahaha‚Ä¶ pfft‚Ä¶ Sorry, I just can‚Äôt hold it in.‚Äù

Isla and Sakura exchanged glances. Tsukasa put down his papers. The curiosity in the room reached a boiling point.

‚Äú‚Ä¶I have a bad feeling about this,‚Äù Tsukasa thought.

‚ÄúSakura, your number‚Äî339251‚Äîwas the SMS verification code I got one time when signing up for a supermarket membership.‚Äù

‚Äú???‚Äù The mother and daughter stared at each other.

‚ÄúIsla, remember? You and Tsukasa were both busy with work those days, so I was watching over Sakura. I was holding her and scrolling on my phone when I saw a promotion‚Äîsign up as a member and get free eggs. And then Godou Shinya called and reminded me to assign a unit ID for Sakura‚Ä¶‚Äù

Silence.

‚ÄúAs for Isla‚Ä¶ 7940 was the last four digits of a debit card I was using during my research days.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt even my main card‚Äîit was the one I used to buy snacks.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù

The Mizugaki household fell into dead silence.

Tsukasa stared blankly at Isla. Isla looked blankly at Sakura. And Sakura looked utterly defeated as she stared at the number ‚Äú339251‚Äù printed on her own maintenance file.

All three fell into a deep and existential collective crisis.

‚Äú‚Ä¶What even are we?‚Äù Sakura muttered, pressing a hand to her forehead.

‚ÄúSo the moment I was assigned a number‚Ä¶ was when you were shopping for snacks?‚Äù Isla asked, deadpan.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a victim of an egg promotion?‚Äù Sakura curled up, hugging her knees.

‚ÄúMy wife and daughter‚Äôs serial numbers‚Ä¶ are a supermarket verification code and a snack-card?‚Äù Tsukasa stared into his teacup, beginning to question the foundations of his life.

""Dr. Moegi!"" Isla raised her voice, sounding half desperate.

""Are you seriously telling us the serial number system doesn‚Äôt follow some kind of rigorous logic?!""

There was a brief pause on the other end of the call, and then Dr. Moegi answered, entirely calm:

‚ÄúTechnically, yes, the numbering system should be rigorous‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ you two were, um, special cases. I didn‚Äôt really think that hard about it back then.‚Äù

The Mizugaki household fell into a second round of stunned silence.

This time, it was a silence that gnawed at the soul.

Sakura covered her face. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I want to factory reset myself‚Ä¶‚Äù

Isla sighed. ‚ÄúSo my identity‚Ä¶ came from snacks‚Ä¶‚Äù

Tsukasa stared blankly out the window. ‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd married the most advanced Giftia on the market. And now I find out‚Ä¶ her serial number is the last four digits of a snack debit card‚Ä¶‚Äù

And so, the ‚Äúfamily council‚Äù concluded under an oppressive, surreal weight.

Sakura didn‚Äôt know how she ended the call.

Isla didn‚Äôt know if the cr√®me caramel in the oven had burned.

Tsukasa didn‚Äôt even know how he still ended up holding Isla as usual that night while they slept.

The next morning.

At the entrance of the SAI Corporation Headquarters, everything was in perfect order.

Employees clocked in, entered the building, and began their daily routines with practiced efficiency.

Suddenly‚Äî

The security gate at the front let out a mechanical wail, and before it could respond, it was blown away by two Giftias sprinting at superhuman speed: Unit 7940 and Unit 339251.

Security System: ‚ÄúDetected high-power signal interference‚ÄîaaaaaaaAAAAAA‚Äî‚Äù

BEEP. Gate system crashing...

BEEP. Attempting recovery... Failed.

BEEP. Emergency Alert: HQ entrance breached by unidentified lifeforms!

‚ÄúOut of the way!!‚Äù Isla yelled, charging ahead with her daughter, barreling past all obstacles.

They didn‚Äôt even wait for the elevator‚Äîstraight up the stairs, full tilt.

BAM!!

The doors to the CEO's office were flung open with explosive force.

Godou Shinya, just about to begin his morning executive meeting, barely had time to set down his coffee cup before two blurs of white and pink stormed into the room like twin typhoons.

‚ÄúGODOU! DOES SAI SELL NAME CHANGE CARDS?!‚Äù

Godou blinked. His gaze slowly moved from his coffee to the two breathless Giftias.

The executives visible in the video conference feed all looked horrified, clearly having no idea what was going on.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Wait. What did you two do this time?‚Äù Godou asked, frowning, summoning all his boardroom gravitas to stay in control.

Isla slammed her hands on the desk. Sakura mimicked her mother in perfect sync.

‚ÄúWe want to change our serial numbers!‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù

Godou took a sip of coffee with calculated composure.

Then calmly muted his mic and turned off his webcam.

‚ÄúAll right. Sit. Explain.‚Äù

Five minutes later.

Godou had heard the whole ridiculous backstory.

He adjusted his glasses, straightened his spine, and assumed the full bearing of a high-ranking corporate executive.

His voice was calm, his tone steady:

‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôm a trained professional.

As a senior member of the board, I typically don‚Äôt laugh in my office.‚Äù

Isla & Sakura: ‚Äú?‚Äù

Godou took a long breath. His facial muscles twitched.

He was clearly struggling to hold something back.

And then‚Äî

‚ÄúUNLESS I CAN‚ÄôT HELP IT BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA‚Äî‚Äù

He slammed a hand on the desk, laughter erupting uncontrollably.

‚ÄúIsla‚Äôs serial number is a snack debit card‚ÄîHAHAHAHA‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúSakura‚Äôs is a supermarket registration code‚ÄîOH GOD HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA‚Äî‚Äù

In the end, the great ‚ÄúSerial Number Dignity Defense Battle‚Äù came to a rather anticlimactic close, drowned out by Director‚Äîno, Chairman‚ÄîGodou‚Äôs uncontrollable laughter.

Isla and Sakura left SAI Corp headquarters empty-handed, behind them a security gate still sparking with static and a group of staff still secretly listening in, wondering just what kind of ""Happiest Meeting of the Year"" the chairman had just experienced.

Godou, meanwhile, sat back at his desk after they left, fingers tapping a few lines of code to pull up internal serial number management access. A small, amused smile crept onto his lips.

‚ÄúSupermarket verification codes and snack debit cards, huh‚Ä¶ That is kind of interesting.‚Äù

Perhaps serial numbers meant more than they realized‚Ä¶

But that was a story for another time.

Having suffered the serial number crisis, Godou‚Äôs uncontrollable laugh, and a completely failed attempt at renaming themselves through corporate bureaucracy, Sakura refused to give up.

She made up her mind to fully investigate the entire Giftia numbering system.

She unleashed her massive computational power‚Äîsearching everything from supermarkets to libraries, swimming pools to internal SAI Corp databases.

She even ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù the engineer-level access codes of their friendly neighborhood maintenance tech, Auntie Miru Elu (Êµ∑Êùæ „Ç®„É´), to dig through countless Giftia maintenance records.

In her mind, an immense Excel spreadsheet formed:

millions of rows cascading like a waterfall‚Äî

Giftia ID | Owner | Production Batch | Manufacturing Date...

She flipped through them nonstop, calculating, analyzing, cross-referencing‚Ä¶

And in the end, she came to one firm conclusion:

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no logic at all!‚Äù

Serial numbers were just‚Ä¶ numbers.

No matter where they came from‚Äîsupermarket, bank, library, pool, or even SAI‚Äôs own terminals‚Äînone of them held any special meaning.

Giftias couldn‚Äôt choose them.

Neither could their owners.

Even the factories producing them had no say.

They were automatically generated by the system.

Maybe sorted by production batch or date‚Äîbut beyond that...

Absolutely meaningless.

But... wait.

Sakura suddenly paused.

Hers and Isla‚Äôs serial numbers... were different.

She stared at her 339251, then at Isla‚Äôs 7940.

A new thought flashed through her neural pathways.

‚Äú...Wait a second.‚Äù

Yes, their serial numbers sounded ridiculous‚Äîone was a supermarket code, the other a snack card.

But compared to all those cold, randomly assigned identifiers‚Ä¶

Theirs carried memories.

One was chosen by Isla‚Äôs creator, Dr. Moegi, as a random debit card number during her research days.

The other‚Äîa temporary verification code she received while signing up for a supermarket app, cradling baby Sakura in her arms.

These numbers weren‚Äôt just digits.

They were tiny snapshots of someone‚Äôs life.

For the first time, Sakura thought‚Ä¶ maybe that wasn‚Äôt so bad.

Her eyes lit up.

She shot upright.

‚ÄúMom! I figured it out!‚Äù

Isla was still sulking on the couch, arms crossed and cheeks puffed in protest‚Äîclearly still not over the emotional damage of learning her name came from a snack card.

Sakura plopped down beside her, grabbing her mother‚Äôs hand and shaking it.

‚ÄúMom! Listen! I finally get it!‚Äù

Isla: ‚ÄúError, Not listening.‚Äù

Sakura: ‚Äú‚Ä¶Moooom!‚Äù

Isla: ‚ÄúNot listening, not listening, NOT listening!‚Äù

She turned her head dramatically, as if the very concept of her naming was a lifelong curse.

Sakura took a deep breath, then spoke seriously.

‚ÄúMom, think about it. Other Giftias? Their serial numbers are just cold lines of code. Automatically assigned.

Not even their owners or manufacturers can change them.‚Äù

Isla: ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù

Sakura pressed on:

‚ÄúBut ours‚Äîthey mean something.

They represent real moments in a human‚Äôs life.

Grandma Moegi might‚Äôve picked them casually, but those moments were real.‚Äù

Isla‚Äôs expression twitched‚Äîbut her cheeks stayed puffed out, holding the line.

‚Äú‚Ä¶So what?‚Äù she muttered.

‚ÄúSo it means we‚Äôre special!‚Äù

Sakura‚Äôs voice was full of conviction. ‚ÄúThe numbers themselves are silly‚Äîbut they‚Äôre tied to memories. That gives them meaning.‚Äù

Isla: ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù

Her posture relaxed, ever so slightly.

From the kitchen, Tsukasa‚Äîwho had been eavesdropping the whole time‚Äîfinally couldn‚Äôt resist chiming in.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Sakura‚Äôs got a point.‚Äù

Isla whipped her head around. ‚ÄúYou stay out of this.‚Äù

Tsukasa: ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù

Isla‚Äôs gaze drifted for a second. Then she let out a long sigh, rubbing her temples.

‚Äú‚Ä¶So what you‚Äôre saying is:

Even if our numbers are dumb, they‚Äôre‚Ä¶ unique?‚Äù

Sakura nodded enthusiastically. ‚ÄúExactly! The numbers meant nothing‚Äîbut the memories gave them meaning.‚Äù

Isla was quiet for a while.

Then, slowly‚Ä¶ she smiled.

‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre starting to sound more and more like your dad.‚Äù

She reached out and gently patted Sakura‚Äôs head.

Her tone softened, with just a hint of playful exasperation.

Sakura beamed: ‚ÄúOf course I do! I‚Äôm your daughter, after all.‚Äù

‚ÄúMm.‚Äù Isla nodded. Her gaze turned tender.

The sulking faded.

The sting of the snack-card origin still lingered, sure, but Sakura‚Äôs explanation had made it just a little easier to accept.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù Isla relented at last. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll accept that I‚Äôm the Giftia with the snack-card serial number.‚Äù

Sakura grinned, hands on hips.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the spirit!‚Äù

Thus ended the serial number crisis, not with a system reset or a renaming form, but with a quiet, almost philosophical realization:

‚ÄúNumbers may mean nothing, but memory gives them meaning.‚Äù

Isla stopped brooding.

Sakura beamed with victory.

And Tsukasa‚Ä¶

Tsukasa stood in the kitchen, watching his wife and daughter debate all night, filled with strange emotions.

‚Äú‚Ä¶So my wife‚Äôs serial number is a snack card. My daughter‚Äôs is a supermarket SMS code. And me? A regular carbon-based lifeform? I‚Äôm somehow the mentor figure for two AI?‚Äù

Sakura and Isla exchanged a glance, then slowly turned to face Tsukasa.

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù Sakura said, blinking innocently.

Isla gave him a sly smile. ‚ÄúTsukasa‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs your social security number?‚Äù

Tsukasa: ‚Äú???‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see if you‚Äôre just a ‚Äòrandom identifier‚Äô too!‚Äù

‚ÄúHey! No! That‚Äôs personal data! You can‚Äôt just‚Äî!‚Äù

Isla & Sakura:

‚ÄúBAHAHAHAHAHA!‚Äù

And so, the serial number incident finally came to an end.

The Mizugaki family, once again, returned to their unusual but happy everyday life.

(Maybe.)

Some time later...

Tsukasa Mizugaki finally decided‚Äîit was time to buy a car.

In this era, personal vehicles were no longer essential.

Driverless taxis were everywhere, and Tokyo's public transit system was so developed it could easily meet 95% of a family‚Äôs daily needs.

Besides, given Isla‚Äôs legal status, Tsukasa‚Äôs position, and his long-time relationship with now-Chairman Godou, he could borrow company vehicles whenever needed.

Charging? No problem. Company covers that too.

The issue?

The cars he borrowed‚Ä¶ were retrieval vehicles from the Terminal Service Department.

Especially when Tsukasa turned around and saw a standard Giftia retrieval unit sitting in the trunk.

He began to question his very existence.

Taking his wife and daughter out in a vehicle designed to decommission her kind?

That kind of absurd, darkly ironic setup gave him cold sweats every time he thought about it.

‚Äú...I think it‚Äôs time we bought our own car,‚Äù Tsukasa declared one evening.

Isla: ‚ÄúOh? You‚Äôve finally come around?‚Äù

Sakura: ‚ÄúYeah, company cars are creepy.‚Äù

Thus began the grand family debate:

‚ÄúWhat kind of car suits the Mizugaki family?‚Äù

Tsukasa outlined his needs:

It had to be spacious.

After all, there were two Giftias in the family, and one of them‚Äîa supercomputer-grade AI teenage girl‚Äîwould probably stuff the trunk with ‚Äúlab materials.‚Äù

Definitely not a flashy sports car.

Practical and discreet was the way to go.

 (Sakura‚Äôs neon convertible idea was instantly vetoed.)

Isla: ‚ÄúHow about an MPV? If we get more AI family members in the future‚Ä¶ why not go for a 7-seater?‚Äù

Tsukasa: ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶‚Ä¶what do you mean, more AI family members?‚Äù

Isla: ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù

Sakura: ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù

Tsukasa: ‚ÄúYou two are planning something weird again, aren‚Äôt you?!‚Äù

Proposal rejected.

For the powertrain, hybrid seemed the best option.

While full EVs were everywhere and battery swapping was convenient,

considering the two electricity-guzzling Giftias at home, a pure EV might only survive 2‚Äì3 years.

Plus, hybrids in Japan were fuel-efficient, low-tax, and environmentally friendly.

(Mainly, Tsukasa‚Äôs wallet was already crying.)

Safety was also non-negotiable.

His wife could run supercomputer-level calculations to avoid traffic accidents in real time.

His daughter, on the other hand‚Ä¶ was the type to hack traffic lights for ‚Äúoptimization purposes.‚Äù

With all this in mind, they settled on a Lexus hybrid SUV.

On registration day, Isla got called back to work,

so Tsukasa went to the transport bureau alone.

A quick note:

In Japan, license plates usually follow this structure:

Region + Category Number + Hiragana + Four Digits

And yes‚Äîyou can choose your own number (for a fee).

While filling out the license paperwork, Tsukasa suddenly thought back over the last 20 years of his life with Isla:

Love at first sight.

Two months of dating before her lifespan expired.

Her mysterious reappearance with all her memories intact.

Teaching him the meaning of ‚Äúexistence‚Äù and ‚Äúlove.‚Äù

Fighting society to gain human citizenship.

Marriage, somehow.

Secretly installing a birth module in her body without telling him.

Surprise pregnancy after unprotected sex (!?!?)

After all that chaos, the Mizugaki household hierarchy had evolved as follows:

Isla > Sakura > the vacuum robot > the smart fridge > Tsukasa

Every time he remembered it, Tsukasa‚Äôs heart was filled with a mix of deep love‚Ä¶ and utter exasperation.

And then, A memory resurfaced.

A few weeks ago.

Isla, in the living room, screaming:

‚ÄúMy serial number‚Ä¶ was my mom‚Äôs snack card?!‚Äù

Tsukasa chuckled.

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ this is it.‚Äù

He grinned devilishly as he filled out the license plate request:

7940.

Yes, Isla‚Äôs ‚Äúinfamous number.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt tell her.

The final license plate read:

ÂìÅÂ∑ù 381 „Åï 7940

(Shinagawa 381 sa 7940)

That evening, Tsukasa drove the new car home.

The hybrid Lexus ran smoothly. Spacious. Comfortable. Exactly what he hoped for.

Isla and Sakura stood at the curb, waiting as he pulled in.

He rolled down the window, looking smug.

‚ÄúWell? What do you think?‚Äù

Isla crossed her arms, nodding in approval.

‚ÄúNot bad. A hybrid does suit our family.‚Äù

Sakura circled the car once, scanned all the onboard electronics via wireless signal, then said:

‚ÄúDecent. The car‚Äôs AI isn‚Äôt as smart as me, but it'll do.‚Äù

Isla smiled and headed toward the driver‚Äôs seat‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but her gaze stopped dead at the front bumper.

The plate.

ÂìÅÂ∑ù 381 „Åï 7940

Sakura glanced at it too, and immediately doubled over, fighting back laughter.

‚ÄúPfft‚Äî‚Äù

Isla‚Äôs eyes narrowed. She turned to Tsukasa slowly.

‚ÄúTsu\~ka\~sa\~‚Äù

He kept his tone flat.

‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù

She pointed at the plate.

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you did this on purpose, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù

Tsukasa did his best to look innocent.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚Äòon purpose‚Äô?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis plate number! 79-40!‚Äù

Isla gritted her teeth.

‚ÄúYou totally picked this on purpose!‚Äù

Tsukasa solemnly shook his head.

‚ÄúHow could I? Plate numbers are randomly assigned.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lie! You know we can choose numbers in Japan!‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶Uh.‚Äù

Sakura couldn‚Äôt hold it anymore. She burst out laughing, backing away as she howled:

‚ÄúHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!‚Äù

Isla‚Äôs temple twitched.

‚ÄúTsukasa. What. Are. You. Trying. To. Say.‚Äù

Tsukasa leaned against the car, arms crossed.

‚ÄúRevenge.‚Äù

Isla: ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù

Sakura clutched the door, laughing so hard she nearly fell:

‚ÄúDad! You‚Äôre so petty! HAHAHA‚ÄîMom finally accepted her number, and now she has to see ‚Äò7940‚Äô every time she gets in the car!‚Äù

Isla took a deep breath, trying to stay calm.

‚ÄúTsukasa Mizugaki‚Ä¶ are you tired of living?‚Äù

Tsukasa smiled, totally composed.

‚ÄúNot at all, dear. I just wanted to remind you‚Ä¶ of your origin.‚Äù

Isla: ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù

Sakura: ‚ÄúMom, you‚Äôre finished! You‚Äôre officially the ‚ÄòSnack Card Giftia‚Äô now!‚Äù

Isla snarled: ‚ÄúYou two better remove this plate‚Äîright now!‚Äù

Tsukasa, still smiling: ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt. That‚Äôs illegal in Japan.‚Äù

‚ÄúUghhhhh!!!‚Äù 

Sakura was nearly in tears.

‚ÄúHahahaha! Just accept your fate, Mom!‚Äù

Isla‚Äôs expression shifted‚Äîfrom shock, to fury, and finally‚Ä¶ resignation.

She sighed. Long and hard.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Fine. Whatever.‚Äù

She rubbed her temples, climbed into the driver‚Äôs seat, and buckled up.

‚ÄúAfter all these years, I guess you do deserve one act of petty revenge.‚Äù

Tsukasa raised an eyebrow.

‚ÄúOh? So you admit it?‚Äù

Isla rolled her eyes: ‚ÄúYou really engraved my number onto a car‚Ä¶ seriously, who even thinks of that?‚Äù

Tsukasa leaned casually on the car door: ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt like it?‚Äù

Isla gave him a sideways glance.

Her mouth twitched, just a little.

‚Äú‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt say that.‚Äù

She wouldn‚Äôt admit it,

but she had to concede, this ridiculous plate did match their family style.

And somehow, it felt like a piece of their shared memory.

Sakura folded her arms, watching them: ‚ÄúHaha, this couple is doomed, I swear.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù Isla and Tsukasa, in perfect unison.

Sakura: ‚ÄúHahahahahaha!‚Äù

Tsukasa, deep down, quietly marked this as a glorious victory in the battlefield of married life.

Tsukasa Mizugaki‚Äîfinally, after all these years‚Äîhad found a shred of dignity in his own household.

 (Probably.)

Control-freak, micromanaging and no one does anything well and he should just fire half the company (he‚Äôs the CEO so he technically can, we‚Äôre a small start up). 

He‚Äôs in one of those phases again. I had to follow up on something during the week, I did by talking to the people and not sending messages because we had a two day trip as a company plus a c level offsite (so not a lot of working days). I also talked to the c levels and they all told me how they‚Äôre sick of him, too many priorities and shifts and it‚Äôs not possible to continue like this. 

Of course I didn‚Äôt tell him about the conversations, but I woke up to a message yesterday saying ‚Äòyou didn‚Äôt do this. I am disappointed and pissed off. Next time you do something like this I will fire you on the spot‚Äô. I‚Äôm a bit sensitive these days so I cried (at home in private).

I think we have a good relationship and he is nice most of the time, he‚Äôs taken on a bit of a mentor role. But when he gets like this I just want to quit. 

When I came into the office yesterday morning I wasnt nice like I usually am because his message triggered my anxiety really bad and I was trying to get through the day. He asked and I said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm just processing the message I woke up to‚Äô ‚Äòyeah I figured I shouldn‚Äôt have sent it right after I sent it‚Äô.
In the afternoon he brought me coffee so I took that as him apologizing (that‚Äôs what he usually does).

Later in the day had asked me to get him some corporate presents (coordinate with marketing). I showed him what we have and it somehow became my fault that marketing used a different supplier due to the short notice of the request (he likes one Chinese supplier and he needs these by Friday). And he said ‚Äòis there a reason why you‚Äôre not doing your job?‚Äô Then he said goodbye and left. 
And I cried at the office.

He seems hell-bent on wanting to install a terror reign and firing half the company for non performance while just demanding more of me (including telling me I should work weekends because they pay me well, that I shouldn‚Äôt need so much rest). And right now I constantly feel inferior and not good enough. 

To those of you who have a boss like this, how do you cope with the mood swings? He was great for three months (new personal record), but I just can‚Äôt take it now there is so much disdain coming from him. 

I try to tell myself it‚Äôs a phase but I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve been here for a year and a half but he‚Äôs never been this bad. Maybe he‚Äôll fire me in a month, I‚Äôd be fine with it I can get my severance. ",1,1746527839.0,ExecutiveAssistants,8,1.0,False

Using the attached weigh in log you can see the weight loss.  So from march 1st to May second I lost 30 lbs.

30 lbs divided by 63 days = .47 lbs per day lost multiply that by 3500 =1666 calories burned + 1750 budget = 3416.  Is this right?  My budget is probably higher too because I don‚Äôt log cream in coffee and will take a hand full of this or that for a snack.

1.1: the time we met

Hello, before you continue reading this book, please understand:

\- English is NOT my first language.

\- I am improving though!

Now enjoy the long ride, you're all amazing! THANK YOUUU!

PART ONE:

""Eventually, you'll end where you need to be, with who you're meant to be with, and doing what you should be doing.""

I can never relate to this quote, I can never imagine myself being happy and accepting who I am.

My life has taught me that loving is not easy, and even though I tried loving someone, I can't find it in my heart to love him back - or even like him back.

Honestly, it sucks. Especially when your mom keeps teasing you about it, that hurts.

Throughout my nineteen years of life, I recently just realized the answer to my messed up life.

You can't love someone else when you don't love yourself, you have to learn to love yourself in order to love others. You cant give people what you don't have, right?

That is what I tell myself.

""Lexi,"" my sister barges into my bedroom. ""Get ready, we are going out with Mike.""

I whine, because I really don't want to go, it feels weird third-wheeling on every date they go to.

""Why do you want me to go?"" I ask, standing up from my bed.

""Because Lola is coming with us,"" she responds.

Lola is my fourteen year old sister, and she hates going out with them as much as I do.

""Okay,"" I nod. ""Just give me a minute.""

""Okay, hurry up.""

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

We are currently in a fancy restaurant where I do not belong, all around us are people with big brand bags, and they all look rich.

In the corner of my eyes, I catch a couple of boys sitting next to us who are staring at our table. I roll my eyes, knowing that they are staring at Sophia.

Too bad she has a boyfriend.

""And then, I told her that I love you and I want to marry you soon,"" Mike tells us about him talking to his mother about asking my dad for his blessings.

I roll my eyes, he is not educated in this matter; why is he telling my sister that he is going to propose to her soon?

Why not surprise her?

Shaking my head to escape the thoughts, I grab my phone from the table and open it. Even though I have no one to talk to, I keep scrolling down i\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*:, liking random people's pictures.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

Waking up to my sister waking up, I know that she's mad over something so stupid. I ignore her, and stay in my bed.

Until she decides to shake me, and that is when I jump up and start hitting her. ""Stop waking me up! What do you want?!""

""Did you take my blusher?!"" She growls.

I roll my eyes, ""do you know me at all?""

""I'm just asking,"" she huffs.

""And you just woke me up,"" I push her slowly, and walk to the bathroom.

I am awake, so it only makes sense if I stay awake.

""Starbucks?"" Sophia asks. ""We can pick Mike up and we'll all go to the park?""

""No,"" I shake my head. ""I am really not in the mood.""

""Come on,"" she whines. ""We'll have fun.""

""Are you going to pay?"" I ask.

""For Starbucks?""

""Yep,"" I nod, and she just shrugs. She walks out of the bedroom, and I open the closet to find the most comfiest outfit I own.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

We walk to the park that's close to Starbucks, and I am walking behind them, they were a bit far from where I am. I am busy watching a funny video, and accidentally bump into someone.

""My bad,"" he says.

""It's fine,"" I do not look up, and I ignore the boy.

""Okay, so you spilled a bit of coffee on me, and I guess that's fine?"" He says.

I still do not look up, ""do not cry over it, just... buy a new shirt.""

I make my way to my sister and her boyfriend, ignoring the boy who is calling me 'GIRL!' in the back.

Mike and Sophia are sitting on a brown bench near the playground, they are facing the children and the parents watching them. I sit next to Mike, and I look at them.

""Excited much?"" I smirk.

""About?"" Mike furrows his eyebrows.

""Kids,"" I reply. ""You're watching them with love and care, I can't wait for you two to give this love and care to your babies.""

""Me too,"" Mike mumbled, he is probably shy to talk more about it. ""By the way, I invited my friend because we want him to invite us to his mansion! IT'S HUGE and imagine being friends with a millionaire.""

I roll my eyes, ""why would you befriend someone just because of their money?""

""He's coming,"" he smiles. ""And by the way, I am friends with him because he has these super famous friends who have the double money that Kyle has.""

I almost comment on what he said, but a familiar voice appears behind me and cuts me off. ""Mike.""

""Kyle, hello,"" Mike stands up and he shakes hands with him. He looks at Sophia and sends a smile to her.

""Kyle,"" he introduces himself to Sophia.

""I'm Sophia,"" she smiles shyly. I can tell that he is ignoring me, and to be honest; I am used to be ignored by ignorant boys. Kyle has straight jet black hair that reaches his ears, and he has small hazel eyes. Even though Kyle can be counted as a cute boy, he is not my type.

""Sophia is my girlfriend,"" Mike adds, jealousy is showing in his eyes. ""That's her little sister, Daisy.""

Kyle looks at me, and he smiles slightly. ""Hey, Daisy.""

I ignore him and look at my phone, if he's expecting me to answer him, then he is wrong. Sophia nudges my arm with her elbow, but I only glare at her. However, she does not take that as a sign, and pulls me away from Mike and Kyle.

""What are you doing?"" She yells but whispering, in case they can hear us.

""Nothing, this dude barely acknowledged me when he approached us,"" I shrug. ""I am not talking to a boy with this attitude!""

""You have an attitude yourself,"" she scoffs. ""We are trying to set you up with him, can't you see?""

""I do not need your help doing that,"" I roll my eyes. ""If I want a boyfriend, I will get a boyfriend.""

That is when I walk away from them, and I make my way to another direction from them

Rain drizzled down steadily, clinging to its fogged-up windows and weather-beaten sign. Hundreds of people passed by without a second thought, their umbrellas bobbing like restless waves in a bustling ocean of pedestrians.

But inside, it was a different story. The warmth enveloped you right away, cozy and inviting, wrapping around you like a favorite old blanket. The air was filled with the faint scent of coffee, baked goods, and that unmistakable aroma of dust-warmed electronics. The soft glow from the monitors cast gentle halos over the heads of its customers. No one glanced up as the door swung open, letting in a gust of chilly air. It slammed shut behind you, shutting out the grey drizzle and leaving only the hum of machines and the rhythm of rapid-fire keystrokes.

You recognized these sounds. These smells. They clung to the caf√© like cherished memories‚Äîfamiliar, comforting, and a touch bittersweet. You‚Äôd first stumbled upon this hidden gem back in middle school, and it had become your refuge through every season: the blustery spring nights with frozen fingers clutching sticky popsicles, autumn afternoons spent sipping hot chocolate, and those long winter evenings warmed only by glowing screens and limited-time Christmas loot drops.

You‚Äôd gamed through middle school, high school‚Äîeven as college crept in and stole your free time, the thrill still lingered. The frantic click of the mouse, the sharp clack of the keys, the rising cheer of victory that echoed through the tiny room.

It all felt nostalgic now.

There had been one game you‚Äôd held onto the longest‚Äîan RPG that had it all. Magic, treasures, and best of all, points that could be exchanged for real-world cash if you played well enough. And you had. But the memory wasn‚Äôt entirely sweet.

There was him.

From the very beginning of the game, he‚Äôd been there. That same determined player who always tackled maps solo, who would charge through dungeons like a wrecking ball, hardly giving a nod to the rest of the team. Whenever he did decide to join a party, it felt less like teamwork and more like being a sidekick to a dictator. Arrogant. Distant. Powerful. You couldn‚Äôt stand him. But, man, he was impressive. One of the best tanks you‚Äôd ever encountered. His combos were lightning-fast‚Äîhis WPM must have been off the charts. You figured he was some privileged kid with endless time on his hands, yet even after all these years, he was still around. Still playing. Still untouchable.

Despite crossing paths with him in countless parties over the years, your interactions had been few and far between. A terse ‚ÄúMove,‚Äù or a blunt ‚ÄúStay back.‚Äù No real connection. Just his presence. Cold, efficient, and annoyingly unforgettable.

The game itself, however, was winding down. Its glory days were fading, and a shiny new VR version was on the horizon, ready to bury the old code under sleek graphics and motion sensors. Still, it had been a good run. There would be other games.

So when you strolled into the caf√© one rainy afternoon after a long day of classes and booted up the desktop, you weren‚Äôt expecting much more than a wave of nostalgia.

Your character spawned into the familiar landscape. In-game, it was autumn too. A chill hung in the air, wrapping around the golden trees like a soft mist. Leaves blanketed the forest floor in patches of copper and brown, crunching softly beneath your boots. The trees stood tall and silent, like guardians as pale sunlight spilled across the horizon, chasing away the last traces of the moon.

Weak demons roamed nearby‚Äîcreatures that had once posed a challenge when you were twelve, now barely worth a second glance.

And then, in the clearing ahead, stood someone you hadn‚Äôt anticipated seeing.

Him.

The infamous tanker.

Still here. Still playing.

One of the last. 

‚∏ª
Plot Type: SOL: MxM
You‚Äôve become what some might call a weekend warrior‚Äîor maybe more of a ‚Äúwhenever-there‚Äôs-time‚Äù kind of fighter. Finding time to game between classes, assignments, and the whirlwind of college life can be a challenge. You've been playing alongside the same guy for years now, someone who feels like a part of your digital upbringing. The battles, the quests, those late-night strategy sessions‚Äîthey‚Äôve been a reliable constant amid the chaos of growing up.

But now, it‚Äôs all coming to an end. The servers are getting ready to shut down, the story is reaching its conclusion, and you‚Äôve just logged off after one last raid, your final ‚ÄúGG‚Äù already typed out. Even after saying your goodbyes, your mind keeps drifting back to him‚Äîthe tanker.

What was he really like?

That nameless player with the precise commands and nearly flawless gameplay. The one who never lingered for small talk, who powered through every challenge like a machine, as if nothing could faze him. He drove you crazy, no doubt‚Äîbut there was something about him that stuck with you, something that felt incomplete.

So, you start to dig a little deeper.

Chapter 1: The Stranger

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs that guy again, Regan. Look.‚Äù

I looked up to see the guy Shaquanna was referring to. He was the same guy who‚Äôd been coming into the coffee shop where I worked as a waitress every day. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. He was probably new in town or just passing through.

He shuffled in and sat down in a booth near the window. He carried a green duffel bag that he dropped on the booth seat next to him. I figured he must be military because his green looked Army issue. I took a moment to study him. His medium brown hair was thick and in need of a haircut. Dark stubble marred his jaw and from this far away, I couldn‚Äôt tell what color his eyes were.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs sitting in your section, Regan. As usual.‚Äù Shaquanna grinned suddenly. ‚ÄúWhy, I think you got yourself a secret admirer,‚Äù she said in a fake southern drawl. She gave the man a closer look. ‚ÄúYour mystery man could seriously use a shower, shave, and a haircut.‚Äù

I waved a hand dismissively. ‚ÄúIt ain‚Äôt even like that, Quanna. He probably isn‚Äôt even thinking about me.‚Äù

She pursed her lips. ‚ÄúSo explain to me why he comes here every day and sit in your section? Coincidence? I think not.‚Äù

I shrugged, picking up a coaster for his table. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs probably a drifter. Just passing through.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell go get him, girl,‚Äù adding a growl like a female tiger.

I grinned at her, sneaking another look at the stranger. ‚ÄúMight be interesting though. God knows I could use a little excitement these days.‚Äù

I slowly approached the table where the man sat staring at his folded hands. He had large hands with long, slim fingers. The collar of his jacket was turned up, hiding his face from my view. Shaquanna said that he was average looking, handsome even. But then, her idea of handsome wasn‚Äôt the same as mine. I suddenly wish I could see his face.

‚ÄúWhat can I get for you?‚Äù I asked as if I hadn‚Äôt been standing there staring at him.

He didn‚Äôt look up, but I knew that he‚Äôd known that I‚Äôd been there the whole time. ‚ÄúCoffee, please,‚Äù he said softly.

Something in the tone of his baritone voice made my heart catch a little in my chest. He seemed sad, lonely. Or maybe all that talk Shaquanna was doing about him being my secret admirer was making see things that weren‚Äôt there.

‚ÄúSure. Anything else?‚Äù

He shook his head. ‚ÄúNo. Thank you.‚Äù

I went back behind the counter. As I poured his coffee, Shaquanna came up beside me. ‚ÄúSo? What does he look like?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I didn‚Äôt really get to see his face. He has a really nice voice though.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you were right there,‚Äù Quanna said. She glanced over at the man. ‚ÄúHow could you not see him?‚Äù

I wiped the side of the cup. ‚ÄúWell he didn‚Äôt exactly look at me either.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs weird if you ask me.‚Äù This came from Flo, the older waitress I worked with. She was your typical career waitress with her teased blond hair swept up into a bun, too much makeup and forever popping her gum. She‚Äôd been working here at the coffee shop since it opened and all the customers loved her. I even remember coming here with my parents as a kid and seeing Flo. She was ancient but sweet.

‚ÄúNah, Flo. He looks harmless,‚Äù I said, grabbing a saucer for the cup.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let that quiet demeanor fool you, sugar.‚Äù Flo said, tucking her pen into her hair. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen that same look he wears on his face on some Vietnam and Korean vets. They all seem to have that same quiet, haunted attitude.‚Äù She pointed a manicured finger towards the man who sat still staring at his hands. ‚ÄúAnd if he‚Äôs a military man, and I suspect that he is, he‚Äôs a killer.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt believe that about the man. ‚ÄúNah, Flo,‚Äù I said again. ‚ÄúHe seems too sweet to hurt anyone.‚Äù

She picked up the plates for her order. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs seen too much or had too much happen to him in life. Don‚Äôt get no romantic notions about him, girls. He‚Äôs probably as mean as a rattlesnake and just as deadly if cornered.‚Äù

Shaquanna and I looked at each other after Flo walked away to deliver the food to her customers. I was sure that she was wrong about the guy.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs crazy,‚Äù Shaquanna said softly, saying it for the both of us. ‚ÄúShe thinks everyone in the military or police is nuts and gonna snap because her old man did. Shoot, I say go for it, if you want to.‚Äù

I glanced at the man again. ‚ÄúGo for what? He‚Äôs probably too old for me anyway. Besides, I‚Äôm just taking him some coffee. Stop planning my wedding.‚Äù

Quanna grinned. ‚ÄúI was only up to the second date, thank you very much.‚Äù

‚ÄúShaquanna McNeil!‚Äù I exclaimed in mock anger.

She shrugged her shoulders. ‚ÄúWhat? Take your man his coffee.‚Äù

With a sigh, I scooped up a handful of creamers and made my way to the table where my customer waited.

‚ÄúHere you go,‚Äù I said, placing the cup in front of him. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs some creamers. Sugar‚Äôs right there.‚Äù I straightened. ‚ÄúDo you need anything else?‚Äù",1,1746527449.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

James here.

Just back from the Big Easy.

Spent nearly a week in the French Quarter.

On the trip - one thing stood out to me more than anything else‚Ä¶

More than the 200+ year old buildings‚Ä¶

More than the beignets‚Ä¶

Or even more than how busy Bourbon Street was at 9am.

As my wife and I stood in Jackson Square watching a street performer who stacked a board on top of a ball, on top of another ball, on top another board‚Ä¶

Balanced on 3 levels of balls and boards at once, juggled swords that were sharp enough to cut a carrot in half‚Ä¶

And still had enough bandwidth to crack jokes with his audience.

This performer had level 10 skills, but‚Ä¶

Level 2 amounts of Leverage.

The lack of leverage is what stood out.

Anyone who wasn‚Äôt within 100-200 feet of the performer?

‚Ä¶ on that exact day‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ at that exact time‚Ä¶

Had no idea he was there.

Because of which?

Despite his obvious years (probably decades) of dedication and training‚Ä¶

He made‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶if I had to guess‚Ä¶

$30?

‚Ä¶From the dozen or so people watching him.

I hope the performer loved what he did.

‚ÄòCuz (at least on that day) he didn‚Äôt do it for the money.

Compare that performer to someone who DOES understand leverage.

I don‚Äôt need to wait around for people to gather in front of me.

‚Ä¶Or hoot and holler until I draw a temporary crowd

I don‚Äôt need decades of experience.

More importantly‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt have to rely on the kindness of others to eat.

In fact‚Ä¶

I can leverage other people‚Äôs self-interest.

‚Ä¶Which is waaaay more reliable than kindness.

Like Zig Ziglar said‚Ä¶

‚ÄúYou can get anything you want by helping people get what they want.‚Äù

For the past 10+ years I‚Äôve said the only thing a person needs to make a living on the internet is to be able to talk.

If you can talk - you can‚Ä¶

* Create a product
* Create a sales letter or VSL
* And recruit affiliates

But

I didn‚Äôt really understand the leverage in talking until I met Travis.

Now I‚Äôd say‚Ä¶

Being able to OPEN conversations is even more leveraged than talking.

(And can get more people what they want.)

If you can open conversations‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and sift and sort potential partners‚Ä¶

You can‚Ä¶

* Get other people to talk on coffee dates for you
* Get other people‚Äôs products
* Other people‚Äôs audiences or affiliates
* And get other people to create your marketing

## The Master Script Blueprint

### OPENING HOOK (0:00-0:15)
```
[PATTERN INTERRUPT]: [Unexpected visual or statement that challenges assumptions]

[HOOK OPTIONS - Select one and customize]:
""What if I told you [counterintuitive statement/shocking statistic]?""
""The single biggest mistake with [topic] is [common error] - and today I'll show you how to avoid it.""
""Did you know that [surprising fact]? This changes everything about how we approach [topic].""
""[Provocative question that challenges assumptions]?""

[CREDIBILITY SNAPSHOT]: I'm [name], and after [relevant experience/credential], I discovered [unique insight].
```

### VALUE PROPOSITION (0:15-0:30)
```
In the next [X] minutes, you'll discover:
- [Primary benefit] so you can [specific outcome]
- [Secondary benefit] even if [common obstacle]
- And my [unique approach/framework] that [specific result]

[CURIOSITY AMPLIFIER]: But before we dive in, there's something crucial most people completely miss about [topic]...
```

### PROBLEM FRAMEWORK (0:30-1:15)
```
If you've ever [experienced the problem], you know exactly how [negative emotion] it can be.

[PROBLEM AMPLIFICATION]: What makes this particularly challenging is [complicating factor] which leads to [negative consequence].

[STAKES RAISING]: Without solving this, you'll continue to experience [ongoing pain point] and miss out on [desired opportunity].

[RELATABILITY MARKER]: If you're like most people I've worked with, you've probably tried [common solution] only to find that [limitation of common approach].

Here's why traditional approaches fall short:
- [Limitation 1] which causes [negative result 1]
- [Limitation 2] which prevents [desired outcome 2]
- [Limitation 3] which creates [ongoing frustration]
```

### AUTHORITY ESTABLISHMENT (1:15-1:45)
```
During my [experience with topic], I've developed a [framework/approach] that has helped [social proof - specific results for others].

What makes this approach different is [key differentiator] that addresses [core problem] directly.

[FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW]: I call this the [named method/framework], which stands for:
- [Letter 1]: [First principle] - which [specific benefit]
- [Letter 2]: [Second principle] - which [specific benefit]
- [Letter 3]: [Third principle] - which [specific benefit]

[ANALOGY]: Think of this like [accessible analogy]. Just as [analogy element 1] connects to [analogy element 2], [topic principle 1] directly impacts [topic principle 2].
```

### CONTENT ROADMAP (1:45-2:00)
```
Here's exactly what we'll cover:
- First, [foundation concept] which lays the groundwork
- Then, [intermediate concept] where most people go wrong
- Finally, [advanced concept] that transforms your results

[EXPECTATION SETTING]: This isn't a [common misconception or quick fix]. You'll need to [realistic requirement], but I'll make the process as clear as possible.

[CREDIBILITY REINFORCEMENT]: I've refined this approach through [experience credential] and seen it work for [type of people/situations].
```

### FOUNDATIONAL CONTENT BLOCK (2:00-4:00)
```
Let's start with [first concept].

[DEFINITION]: At its core, [concept] means [clear definition].

[IMPORTANCE]: This matters because [direct connection to viewer goal].

[COMMON MISCONCEPTION]: Many people believe [incorrect approach], but here's why that creates problems:
- [Issue 1] leading to [negative outcome]
- [Issue 2] preventing [desired result]

[CORRECT APPROACH]: Instead, here's the right way to think about this:

[CONCEPTUAL EXPLANATION]: The key principle is [foundational rule] because [logical reasoning].

[CONCRETE EXAMPLE]: Let me show you what this looks like in practice:
When [specific situation], you want to [specific action] because [cause-effect relationship].

[VISUAL DEMONSTRATION]: As you can see in this [diagram/demonstration], the critical factor is [highlight important element].
[Note: Show relevant visual]

[UNEXPECTED INSIGHT]: What's particularly interesting is [surprising element] that most people overlook.

[APPLICATION PROMPT]: Think about how this applies to your own [relevant situation]. What [specific aspect] could you improve using this principle?

[TRANSITION]: Now that you understand [first concept], let's build on this foundation with [second concept]...
```

### INTERMEDIATE CONTENT BLOCK (4:00-6:30)
```
The next crucial element is [second concept].

[RELATIONSHIP TO PREVIOUS]: While [first concept] addresses [aspect 1], [second concept] focuses on [aspect 2].

[CONTRAST SETUP]: Most people believe [common misconception], but the reality is [accurate insight].

Here's why this distinction matters:
[MECHANISM EXPLANATION]: When you [key action], it triggers [result] because [causal relationship].

[REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE]: Let me show you a real example:
[CASE STUDY]: [Person/organization] was struggling with [challenge]. By implementing [specific approach], they achieved [specific results].

[VISUAL SUPPORT]: Notice in this [visual element] how [important detail] directly impacts [outcome].
[Note: Show relevant visual]

[COMMON PITFALL]: Where most people go wrong is [typical error]. This happens because [psychological/practical reason].

[CORRECT APPROACH]: Instead, make sure you:
1. [Action step one] which [specific benefit]
2. [Action step two] which [specific benefit]
3. [Action step three] which [specific benefit]

[PRACTICE OPPORTUNITY]: Let's quickly apply this. If you were facing [hypothetical situation], how would you use [principle] to address it?

[UNEXPECTED BENEFIT]: An additional advantage of this approach is [surprising benefit] that most people don't anticipate.

[TRANSITION]: This intermediate level is where you'll start seeing real progress, but to truly master [topic], you need our final component...
```

### ADVANCED CONTENT BLOCK (6:30-9:00)
```
Finally, let's talk about [third concept], which is where everything comes together.

[ELEVATION STATEMENT]: This is where [percentage/most] people fall short, but it's also where the biggest [gains/benefits] happen.

[CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATION]: The principle at work is [conceptual explanation], which fundamentally changes how you approach [topic].

[ADVANCED DEMONSTRATION]: Let me walk you through exactly how this works in practice:
[DETAILED WALKTHROUGH OF PROCESS WITH VISUALS]

[OPTIMIZATION TACTICS]: To get even better results, you can:
- [Tactic 1] which enhances [specific aspect]
- [Tactic 2] which prevents [common problem]
- [Tactic 3] which accelerates [desired outcome]

[OBSTACLE ACKNOWLEDGMENT]: Now, you might be thinking, ""But what about [common objection]?""

[RESOLUTION]: Here's how to handle that specific challenge:
[SPECIFIC SOLUTION WITH EXAMPLE]

[EXPERTISE INSIGHT]: After working with hundreds of [relevant people/examples], I've discovered that [unexpected pattern/insight] makes all the difference.

[SYNTHESIS]: Now you can see how [first concept], [second concept], and [third concept] work together to create [major benefit].

[TRANSFORMATION STATEMENT]: When you properly implement all three elements, you transform [starting state] into [ideal outcome].
```

### IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT (9:00-10:30)
```
Now let's put everything together with a complete implementation plan.

[SYSTEM OVERVIEW]: The [framework name] consists of these action steps:

[STEP-BY-STEP SYSTEM]:
1. Start by [first action] - this establishes [foundation]
   ‚Ä¢ [Sub-point] for beginners
   ‚Ä¢ [Sub-point] for more advanced users
2. Next, [second action] - this creates [intermediate result]
   ‚Ä¢ [Common mistake to avoid]
   ‚Ä¢ [Pro tip] to enhance results
3. Then, [third action] - this generates [advanced outcome]
   ‚Ä¢ [Key consideration]
   ‚Ä¢ [Refinement technique]

[TIMELINE EXPECTATIONS]: If you're just beginning, expect to spend about [timeframe] on [initial phase] before moving to [next phase].

[PROGRESS INDICATORS]: You'll know you're on the right track when you see [early sign of success].

[TROUBLESHOOTING]: If you encounter [common problem 1], try [specific solution 1].
If you face [common problem 2], implement [specific solution 2].

[RESOURCE MENTION]: To help you implement this faster, I've created [resource] available [location/how to access].

[RESULTS PREVIEW]: After implementing this system, you should start seeing [specific results] within [realistic timeframe].
```

### RECAP & CALL TO ACTION (10:30-12:00)
```
Let's quickly recap what we've covered:
- [Key point 1] which helps you [benefit 1]
- [Key point 2] which solves [problem 2]
- [Key point 3] which enables [outcome 3]

[VALUE REINFORCEMENT]: Remember, mastering [topic] isn't just about [surface level] - it's about [deeper impact] in your [life/work/field].

[IMPLEMENTATION ENCOURAGEMENT]: The most important thing now is to take what you've learned and start with [first action step].

[FUTURE PACING]: Imagine how [positive projection of viewer's situation] once you've implemented these strategies. You'll be able to [desired outcome] without [current struggle].

[COMMUNITY INVITATION]: If you found this valuable, hit the like button and subscribe for more content on [topic area].

## Advanced Script Enhancement Strategies

### Neuroscience-Based Attention Management
- **Dopamine Triggers**: Insert discovery moments every 60-90 seconds
- **Cognitive Ease**: Break complex ideas into digestible parts using analogies
- **Pattern Recognition**: Establish frameworks then show examples that fit
- **Attention Reset**: Use brief ""pattern interrupts"" at key points (7-minute intervals)
- **Memory Formation**: Use spaced repetition by revisiting key points

### Psychological Engagement Techniques
- **Curiosity Loops**: Open questions that get answered later
- **Loss Aversion**: Highlight what viewers risk by not implementing your advice
- **Authority Markers**: Subtly reference credentials/results at strategic points
- **Reciprocity**: Offer unexpected value that creates a sense of indebtedness
- **Social Proof**: Reference others who have benefited from your methods
- **Scarcity**: Position your information as rare or not widely known
- **Commitment & Consistency**: Ask for small agreements that lead to larger ones

### Rhetorical Devices for Maximum Impact
- **Tricolon Structure**: Group concepts in threes for memorability
- **Anaphora**: Repeat beginning phrases for emphasis (""You can... You can... You can..."")
- **Epistrophe**: Repeat ending phrases for reinforcement
- **Contrasting Pairs**: Present before/after scenarios to highlight transformation
- **Metaphors**: Use concrete representations of abstract concepts
- **Rhetorical Questions**: Pose questions that prompt mental engagement

### Visual-Verbal Integration
- **Gesture Anchoring**: Use consistent hand positions for key concepts
- **Visual Telegraphing**: Verbally introduce visuals before they appear
- **Spatial Anchoring**: Reference concepts as being in specific screen locations
- **Color Coding**: Use consistent color schemes for related concepts
- **Motion Dynamics**: Plan when to use static vs. dynamic visuals

### Script Annotation System
Use these markers throughout your script to guide your delivery:

```
(!!) - Increase energy/emphasis
(PAUSE) - Brief dramatic pause
(P2) - Longer 2-second pause
{SMILE} - Facial expression cue
[VISUAL: description] - Show specific visual element
/SLOW/ - Reduce pace for important point
‚ÜíGESTURE‚Üê - Specific hand movement
#KEY# - Core concept/keyword to emphasize
@TIME@ - Timestamp reference
*SOFTEN* - Lower volume/intensity
^PITCH^ - Raise vocal pitch
vPITCHv - Lower vocal pitch
+FORWARD+ - Move closer to camera
-BACK- - Move away from camera
~PERSONAL~ - Share relevant personal story
```

### Retention Optimization Formula
Follow this pattern throughout your script to maintain engagement:

1. **Present information** (60-90 seconds)
2. **Insert engagement trigger** (question, surprise, story shift)
3. **Provide application** (how information is used)
4. **Create anticipation** (hint at what's coming next)

### A/B Testing Variables
For continuous improvement, test these elements across videos:
- Hook structure variations (question vs. statement vs. story)
- Different ordering of content blocks
- Varied pacing (faster delivery vs. more measured)
- CTA placement and format
- Thumbnail-script integration techniques

## First 10 Seconds Optimization

The opening 10 seconds are critical for retention. Use this specialized structure:

```
[VISUAL PATTERN INTERRUPT]: Something unexpected happens on screen

""[PROVOCATIVE STATEMENT that challenges assumptions or creates curiosity]""

""I'm [name], and after [ultra-brief credential], I discovered that [surprising insight relevant to title].""

""In just [timeframe], I'll show you how to [desired outcome] even if [common obstacle].""
```

## Final Guidance

The most effective educational content blends structured delivery with authentic expertise. This template provides a comprehensive framework, but your unique voice, examples, and teaching style will bring it to life. 

Remember that engagement is emotional as well as intellectual‚Äîviewers need to feel the relevance of your content to their lives, not just understand it intellectually. Continually analyze performance metrics and viewer feedback to refine your approach with each new video.

A great educational script creates an experience where viewers feel they've discovered valuable insights themselves rather than simply being told information. As one content expert noted: ""The best scripts feel like a coffee chat with the smartest person in the room.""",2,1746527169.0,PromptEngineering,0,1.0,False

Throughout my nineteen years of life, I recently just realized the answer to my messed up life.  
  
You can't love someone else when you don't love yourself, you have to learn to love yourself in order to love others. You cant give people what you don't have, right?  
  
That is what I tell myself.  
  
""Lexi,"" my sister barges into my bedroom. ""Get ready, we are going out with Mike.""  
  
I whine, because I really don't want to go, it feels weird third-wheeling on every date they go to.  
  
""Why do you want me to go?"" I ask, standing up from my bed.  
  
""Because Lola is coming with us,"" she responds.  
  
Lola is my fourteen year old sister, and she hates going out with them as much as I do.  
  
""Okay,"" I nod. ""Just give me a minute.""  
  
""Okay, hurry up.""  
  
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢  
  
We are currently in a fancy restaurant where I do not belong, all around us are people with big brand bags, and they all look rich.  
  
In the corner of my eyes, I catch a couple of boys sitting next to us who are staring at our table. I roll my eyes, knowing that they are staring at Sophia.  
  
Too bad she has a boyfriend.  
  
""And then, I told her that I love you and I want to marry you soon,"" Mike tells us about him talking to his mother about asking my dad for his blessings.  
  
I roll my eyes, he is not educated in this matter; why is he telling my sister that he is going to propose to her soon?  
  
Why not surprise her?  
  
Shaking my head to escape the thoughts, I grab my phone from the table and open it. Even though I have no one to talk to, I keep scrolling down i\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*:, liking random people's pictures.  
  
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢  
  
Waking up to my sister waking up, I know that she's mad over something so stupid. I ignore her, and stay in my bed.  
  
Until she decides to shake me, and that is when I jump up and start hitting her. ""Stop waking me up! What do you want?!""  
  
""Did you take my blusher?!"" She growls.  
  
I roll my eyes, ""do you know me at all?""  
  
""I'm just asking,"" she huffs.  
  
""And you just woke me up,"" I push her slowly, and walk to the bathroom.  
  
I am awake, so it only makes sense if I stay awake.  
  
""Starbucks?"" Sophia asks. ""We can pick Mike up and we'll all go to the park?""  
  
""No,"" I shake my head. ""I am really not in the mood.""  
  
""Come on,"" she whines. ""We'll have fun.""  
  
""Are you going to pay?"" I ask.  
  
""For Starbucks?""  
  
""Yep,"" I nod, and she just shrugs. She walks out of the bedroom, and I open the closet to find the most comfiest outfit I own.  
  
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢  
  
We walk to the park that's close to Starbucks, and I am walking behind them, they were a bit far from where I am. I am busy watching a funny video, and accidentally bump into someone.  
  
""My bad,"" he says.  
  
""It's fine,"" I do not look up, and I ignore the boy.  
  
""Okay, so you spilled a bit of coffee on me, and I guess that's fine?"" He says.  
  
I still do not look up, ""do not cry over it, just... buy a new shirt.""  
  
I make my way to my sister and her boyfriend, ignoring the boy who is calling me 'GIRL!' in the back.  
  
Mike and Sophia are sitting on a brown bench near the playground, they are facing the children and the parents watching them. I sit next to Mike, and I look at them.  
  
""Excited much?"" I smirk.  
  
""About?"" Mike furrows his eyebrows.  
  
""Kids,"" I reply. ""You're watching them with love and care, I can't wait for you two to give this love and care to your babies.""  
  
""Me too,"" Mike mumbled, he is probably shy to talk more about it. ""By the way, I invited my friend because we want him to invite us to his mansion! IT'S HUGE and imagine being friends with a millionaire.""  
  
I roll my eyes, ""why would you befriend someone just because of their money?""  
  
""He's coming,"" he smiles. ""And by the way, I am friends with him because he has these super famous friends who have the double money that Kyle has.""   
  
I almost comment on what he said, but a familiar voice appears behind me and cuts me off. ""Mike.""   
  
""Kyle, hello,"" Mike stands up and he shakes hands with him. He looks at Sophia and sends a smile to her.   
  
""Kyle,"" he introduces himself to Sophia.  
  
""I'm Sophia,"" she smiles shyly. I can tell that he is ignoring me, and to be honest; I am used to be ignored by ignorant boys. Kyle has straight jet black hair that reaches his ears, and he has small hazel eyes. Even though Kyle can be counted as a cute boy, he is not my type.   
  
""Sophia is my girlfriend,"" Mike adds, jealousy is showing in his eyes. ""That's her little sister, Daisy.""  
  
Kyle looks at me, and he smiles slightly. ""Hey, Daisy.""  
  
I ignore him and look at my phone, if he's expecting me to answer him, then he is wrong. Sophia nudges my arm with her elbow, but I only glare at her. However, she does not take that as a sign, and pulls me away from Mike and Kyle.   
  
""What are you doing?"" She yells but whispering, in case they can hear us.   
  
""Nothing, this dude barely acknowledged me when he approached us,"" I shrug. ""I am not talking to a boy with this attitude!""   
  
""You have an attitude yourself,"" she scoffs. ""We are trying to set you up with him, can't you see?""   
  
""I do not need your help doing that,"" I roll my eyes. ""If I want a boyfriend, I will get a boyfriend.""   
  
That is when I walk away from them, and I make my way to another direction from them
