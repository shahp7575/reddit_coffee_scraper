I don’t care at all about booze being sold by the PTA but at 9am, with no shade and high heat, it felt incredibly inappropriate. 

Nobody to my knowledge bought any but no one mentioned anything other than laughing at the idea of themselves buying them.

This will have some uncomfortable mention of obsession and internet stalking, but I am aware of my problem and reaching out to find advice from people like me who have moved past it. If any mods know of a sub where this post would be better suited, please let me know)

I feel guilty to say I'm the type of person who does internet stalking towards people who are/were important to me but who I've fallen out of contact with. It hurts too much to not know if theyre okay or what they've been doing, and the internet makes it so easy to find out.

I had a babysitter between 2009-2012 who was very special to me. She introduced me to the concept of anime outside of what aired on US cable tv, she showed me ATLA, she introduced me to the concept of digital art, and she always talked to me like I was a full person. She was a huge role model for me and just a person I became very attached to. I never had siblings, so she somewhat filled that role for me. I also thought she was so pretty and that her style was so cool (she wore tights and sunhats all the time because her skin was sensitive to the sun).

We reconnected briefly in 2015 and I desperately tried to get her to hang out with me. At that point she was a college grad and I was just entering middle school, so while she didn't say it in such terms then, I know now she probably had very little interest in spending time with a middle schooler. However, she talked to me a lot through texts and when I expressed that she was like a big sister to me, she said I was like a sister to her, too. I was so happy at the thought of having a sister! We talked on-and-off through my middle school years, with her often ghosting me for months at a time, but eventually getting around to responding.

Then, around 2018, she went away for good. No more responses, nothing. I was so scared that I had done something wrong. I pleaded for weeks, MONTHS, over text for her to say SOMETHING. ANYTHING. Even to just tell me she was no longer interested in speaking to me! I wanted her to shut me down! Give me something so I could move on! But it never came, and 7 years later, still nothing. I messaged her once a year on twitter between 2019-2022, and I haven't messaged since. She read my messages through 2021, then stopped opening them. She left the account all-together.

I know I pushed too hard, but 3 years later, I desperately want to try again. I know, however, I've learned too much about her online to be the one to try first. If she's on social media, she's fully anonymized herself. I know her linkedin, so I know what she does for work. I accidentally found her spouse when I was looking at her facebook a few years ago. She got married and I had no idea for a year. More so, she's married a woman, which makes my connection to her so much more painful to let go. She was queer, and so am I. I want to talk to her about it. To get her insight as an older queer woman. To know what her personal life was like when she was my babysitter. There's so much I don't know about her, and so much she doesn't know about me, and I dearly wish I could bridge that gap at least one more time.

But I can't. With how I left things, the last messages she saw from me, it would be crossing a boundary to reach out via her work email. It would have been different if I hadn't been so desperate as a teen. Instead of the child stalker, I could have been the kid she took care of a few years who spontaneously found her once I was an adult and reached out for coffee. And even though I know so little about the whole of her life, I know way too much for how little she told me, and it is creepy that I've searched for so much info on her over the years. I just can't let my sister go. I don't know how. How did you all let go of someone you were fixated on but no longer wanted contact with you?

(TLDR; I was fixated on my childhood babysitter, and now I can't let go of the desire to talk to her, despite her clearly not wanting to talk to me. How do I move on?)",1,1750882205.0,AuDHDWomen,0,1.0,False

This Clinically Proven Collagen Might Be Your Answer","Hey everyone! 🌟 So, let’s have a little chat about something that’s been on my mind lately: **skin, hair, and joints.** Yep, the holy trinity of beauty and comfort that tends to get a bit… well, needy as we get older. Anyone else feel like suddenly our knees creak like the floorboards of an old haunted house? 🦴👻

I’ve been diving into this world of *collagen* lately, and let me tell you, it’s been a game changer. Ever heard of **clinically proven collagen** that actually delivers results? Because I’m here for it! 

Here’s what I found out:

- **Skin:** You know when you catch a glimpse of yourself and think, ""Who is that tired person staring back at me?"" Well, collagen can help give your skin that youthful glow. Think plumpness, elasticity, and fewer wrinkles. Who doesn’t want that?

- **Hair:**  Ever looked at your hair and thought it could use a little pep in its step? Collagen can help with strengthening hair follicles—less breakage and some serious shine. Yes, please!

- **Joints:** A friend of mine had been struggling with joint pain (poor guy was living life in slow-mo during hikes!). Collagen can help with that, too, providing the support to keep us moving and grooving like we’re still in our 20s. (Disclaimer: we might not be as sprightly, but you get the idea!)

Now, I know what you might be thinking... **Does it really work though?** That was my question, too! But after doing some digging and seeing the transformations, I decided to try it out myself. And guess what? *There’s enough science out there to back up the benefits!*

We believe in meaningful results, and I can’t wait for you to check this out! If you’re curious and want to see this collagen in action, take a peek at this link: [Mavely Collagen](https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb). Just a heads up, it’s an affiliate link, so I might get a little coffee cash if you decide to give it a whirl! ☕😉

Let’s be real: Self-care is more than just bubble baths and face masks (although yes, those are amazing!). It's about giving our bodies what they truly need. Have you tried collagen before? What were your thoughts? Or maybe you've found other products that worked wonders? Let’s swap stories and keep the convo going! 💬✨",1,1750882199.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

Just wanted to share my journey—maybe it helps someone.

I’m 33, Brazilian, and a teacher. Around December, I felt a tight spot in my neck, near my throat. I ignored it and went through the holidays drinking and eating like normal.

Then came wheezing, voice loss, swollen lymph nodes, burping, gas, and coughing.

Took PPIs for 3 months and antibiotics. Wheezing stopped, but the rest stayed. I lost 11 kg.

After stopping PPIs, the cough went away. Started B12 for anemia and gained 4–5 kg. Lymph nodes are still there but smaller. Ultrasound showed inflammation in the vocal cords. Voice is about 40% better, but still hurts to talk.

I’m on a diet, but coffee and cookies don’t seem to affect me.

It’s been 6 months. Main symptoms now: pain when speaking and swollen lymph nodes.

Lesson: stay patient, don’t go back to alcohol or smoking.

1lkg3f4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MelancholyPonderer/comments/1lkg3f4/untitled_story/,Untitled story,"Jules’ Memory

The first time I met Noah, I was carrying too much.

Not metaphorically — not yet. I was literally trying to carry three boxes of fundraising flyers up the stairs for student council while balancing a bag of granola bars under my arm and a half-spilled iced coffee between my teeth. It was early fall. The kind of day when the sun doesn’t know what it wants to be — warm in patches, cold in shade.

Most people passed me without a glance. That’s what I was used to. I moved fast, kept things upright, never asked for help. I didn’t need to. I was Jules — the reliable one, the rock.

And then a voice behind me said, “You look like a tragic Jenga tower.”

I turned, startled. There he was — lanky, quiet, a little disheveled, his backpack slung over one shoulder like it was just tagging along. Noah.

He reached for the top box like it was the most natural thing in the world.

“I’ve got it,” I said quickly, shifting my weight.

“I know,” he said, not pushing. “But you don’t have to.”

He held my gaze for a second too long, and I felt it — the crack forming. Just the hairline fracture of being seen. Not as strong, or capable, or in control. Just tired.

I let him carry one of the boxes. Just one. But it felt like dropping a stone I didn’t know I’d been clutching to my chest.

He had a way of doing that — seeing what people didn’t say. Not in a pushy, fix-you kind of way. He just noticed. Quietly. Gently. Like he was taking inventory of your soul without judgment.

That first box turned into other things. I’d find him in the hallway after a long day, leaning against my locker with a granola bar and a look that said, I know you forgot to eat again.
I never told him that I skipped meals to squeeze in more — more tasks, more responsibilities, more ways to be needed.

He just handed me the granola bar and said, “Trade you for five minutes of not solving anyone else’s problems.”

Sometimes I think he knew what I needed before I did.

There was a night, months later, when everything fell apart. My little brother had broken his arm, my mom was yelling, and I had a history paper I hadn’t started. I showed up at the coffee shop where we sometimes did homework and just… sat there. Staring at nothing.

Noah slid into the booth without a word. I don’t remember if I said hi. I don’t remember if I cried.

But I remember he reached into his bag and pulled out a stupid little paper crown — the kind they give to kids at birthday parties.

He placed it gently on my head and said, “Today, you don’t have to save the kingdom.”

I laughed. A real, unfiltered laugh. Loud and sore and surprised. He didn’t laugh with me — just smiled that knowing, sad-smile of his and sipped his tea like the world wasn’t quietly falling apart around us.

I never asked him where his strength came from.

Looking back now, I wonder if he even thought he had any. He gave it away so freely, maybe he didn’t think it belonged to him.

The last time we really talked, I was driving him home. The night felt stretched and strange, like time had gone soft around the edges. He stared out the window the whole ride, saying nothing. I filled the space with jokes. I was good at that — deflection.

Just before he got out, he said, “You’re always the one pulling people from the fire.”

I shrugged. “Someone has to be.”

He nodded. “But who pulls you out?”

I didn’t answer. I didn’t know how.

I wish I had. I wish I’d told him that sometimes I didn’t want to be strong. That sometimes I was so scared of collapsing, I forgot how to ask for help. That sometimes the fire burns you even when you’re saving someone else.

He looked at me one last time before closing the door.

“Don’t forget, Jules,” he said. “Even anchors drown.”

Now I can’t stop hearing that line.
Even anchors drown.

I say it to myself in the dark, in the quiet hum of the car when I’m driving nowhere, in the mirror when my smile feels too sharp to be real.

Lately, I’ve started finding things in my bag I didn’t put there. A granola bar. A folded paper crown.
Once, a page torn from a notebook — his handwriting, looping and uneven:
You’re allowed to let go.

I haven’t told the others.

Not yet.

I don’t want to be the first to say it.
That I think he’s still here.
That I think he’s trying to help us still.
That maybe he’s not finished saving us — and maybe, this time, it’s our turn to save him.

Sometimes I wake up thinking I hear his voice — not loud, not ghostly. Just gentle, the way it always was. Like a reminder.

“You don’t have to carry everyone.”

And for a moment, I believe him.

Just for a moment.

Going for a short yield, I put 16gr of the med-dark coffee in my grinder and went a couple of clicks down, did my usual puck prep and extracted 1:1... My first experience with the drink went very poorly, it was sour as a lemon, biting on my tongue and throat, overall a very unpleasant coffee with lightly present notes of fudge and a strong citrus.

I (30F) reconnected with a past coworker, let’s call him Marcus (40M), via instagram about a year into the pandemic. Hit it off pretty well as friends who just sent dumb memes every now and again, found out we had a lot in common and exchanged numbers. We never ended up texting much and kept most of our messages to IG so I assumed he wasn’t as interested in me as I was him.  BTW in those messages we never took it further then a brigade of endless videos and memes or conversations pertaining to specific interests of ours or work. No flirting, no conversations about current or past love interests or relationships just casual social media DMs which are not a thing lol. Man never had a ring on his finger at work, no pictures of his wife on his IG, no talk of her at work during our time there together. No indication this man was married. To add, he’s so damn attractive and equally as intelligent.

Anyways, I had moved to a different state at this point but found myself back in my old stomping grounds where Marcus still lived 6 months ago. After some drinks and reminiscing with old friends I decided to shoot Marcus a text to see if he was out or wanted to come out - found out he was at a bar two blocks down so we decided we’d meet up for a drink. Obviously I was into him and wanted to shoot my shot. We clicked instantly, I felt as if I was with an old friend I’d hung out with for years despite being our first official meet up outside of our past job. We ended up bar hopping for hours and through out the evening we had upped the ante from casual flirting to soft touches along my neck and back, hand on my thigh when sitting next to me, getting close to whisper in my ear in all the noise, and just making me want to just melt. Bars were starting to close, we called it a night but were both too drunk to drive and I offered to just put us in a room for the night at a hotel in that block - my intentions very clear through this offer otherwise. He quickly decided one room, king bed and he paid for it all. On his credit card.

Proceed to the absolute best night of my sex life, still to this very day. I’m talking openly communicated our way into a soft dom/sub situation that went on for the entirety of the night, small breaks with sweet aftercare and then just back at it over and over again. We got a little sleep then got breakfast outside of the hotel in a very public setting and he ran into friends. No red flags with this one, they were kind and grabbed a coffee with us after no word about a wife. Anyways, we go back to hotel, have the second best round of sex of my life, check out and go our separate ways.

Still sent memes every day, started texting and sexting, FaceTimes during the day never at night, but phone calls etc still in the evenings. We talked about life, we talked about our world views and ours passions and our goals in life. I literally lost myself in this man for a minute. Expressed wanting to get together again. He offered to come to me next month lmfao. Anyways - fast forward to last night. I’m back in my old stomping grounds very last minute for work but hadn’t yet messaged Marcus about it. I’m at one of the bars him and I hopped through that night literally texting this man and who do I run into grabbing drinks after work…Marcus and his wife of 11 years. He introduced me as his past coworker to her lol. I just shook her hand, quickly excused myself and left the bar to go back to my hotel. I blocked his number and his IG immediately.

Her and I have a lot of features that resemble each other, like I’m going to be sick I feel like this man who I’ve been fantasizing about for 6 months used me as a younger version of his wife for a goodnight out.

Without thinking, I said, Yeah, that's probably my twin, Bella.

There was no twin. I just panicked and thought it was a harmless joke.

Well, she kept asking about my twin whenever she came in. Over time, I made up more and more stuff about her that she's a writer, that she's quieter than me, that she travels a lot. I even started dressing slightly differently on my days off and going to the bookstore she mentioned, pretending to be Bella if I saw her.

This went on for two years. She even brought me (or her) a book once and said she preferred talking to Bella because she was more grounded. That weirdly stung.

I never intended for it to go this far. Recently, she asked if Bella would be at a book signing event coming up because she’d love to see her again. I panicked and told her Bella moved to another city. She looked disappointed.

I feel awful. She wasn’t even flirting, getting weird or anything. I think she just enjoyed talking to someone who didn’t exist. And I created that someone.

You know the type: over-sugared drinks, zero personality, and vibes that scream “get in, get out.”

I tried the big chains, the niche third-wave cafés, even the “voted best in town” ones. Most of it either lacked soul, or felt too performative. I wanted *comfort* with character.

# Then came Addicted Coffee Bar.

I stumbled across it while deep-diving a local blog. The name felt kind of gimmicky, and yeah — the Unicorn Milkshake pics had me thinking it was more of a teen sugar trap than a legit café.

But I went. Just once. Then again. Then... six more times.

# Here’s what stood out (raw & honest):

* **The coffee is legit.** Not a gimmick. Their espresso is surprisingly bold and layered — tasted like someone *actually* cared about the roast.
* **The milkshakes? Ridiculous.** Like, sugar-tower madness. Not for everyday. But 100% perfect for a treat or if you're bringing someone who wants to feel like a kid again.
* **Unexpected vibe.** Family-owned, super human. They hustle. The barista remembered my name by day 3. That doesn’t happen anymore.
* **It’s not fast.** This isn’t a grab-and-go spot during rush hour. But that’s kinda the point — it’s a *pause*, not a pitstop.
* **People smile here.** Like actually. Weird to say, but contagious.

# Takeaways if you're thinking of trying:

* **Go for the coffee, stay for the vibe.** Don’t write it off as a milkshake shop.
* **Best if you're in a “slow morning” mood.** Great place to reclaim a little joy. Maybe bring a friend or a journal.
* **Avoid rush hour if you’re in a time crunch.** They’re popular for a reason, and the team’s small but mighty.

And because I nerded out on this harder than I thought I would, I wrote a longer breakdown — with screenshots, what I ordered, and a few little things no one tells you (like *how to hack the menu*): [read it here](https://addictedcoffeebar.com)

As of today, sitting at my family business, I absolutely can't get my head around some thoughts. Is there any point of trying as all I can see is negative variables all around, not from a mindset perspective but rather situational one.

For context: 

I used to work in work in corporate head office as a PM for unsecured lending business for 2 years with last draw of India Rupees of 600,000 per annum, after my boss consent toxicity like making aggressive comments, political setup, and multiple time humiliating me Infront of stakeholder even, I decided to quit without job offer thinking during my 12 weeks I will find something new which did happen and then by then of 2024, I joined my family business to keep myself busy. 

Now here's the kicker, 

1) After I came back home it has nothing been ups and downs, Grandfather stole my fathers government reimbursement of 10 million which he was fight the suit for over a decade to give it to his youngest son for his own business.

2)  Our home which was on mortgage due to some business expenses back in 2018,  and my father shares it with his bothers (3) turns out the one of the eldest uncles hasn't been contributing to home expenses or the EMI for the bank, since back then and my father and his 2nd eldest brother has been picking up his slack. 

After seeing this I went to see what our debt situation was and that hit the hardest. A whopping 50 million in debt with annual income post business expense where just a little shy of 5 million with father business  earing 2.3 mill and 2nd uncles business earrings 2.7 mil . This doesn't account for 1st and 3rd uncles earning as I don't what they earn and haven't been contributing. majority debt is from mortgage with around 30 mil including some interest payments and remaining being brewing from friends and family.

3) Seeing some troubled times which cashflow in business including growth hurdles and family treating me, my parents and my sister like some infected people and disrespecting us like we are nothing, I wounder if this was really my family that my father took care for over 40 years and dropped out of high school to year for them and their family so that my cousins can also go to school.

4) With world  constantly trying to go to war and neither countries economy any better with some suggesting that it will take some people might need 100 years of savings to buy home. Will it even make sense as I don't think any one will be able afford a cup of coffee with everything going on in the next 25 years. Does moving to any other country for living or earing even make sense now?

5) Lastly and this is personal, I see many of my school mates, neighbors and some people that I have meet during my corporate time,  doing far better than me in terms of carrier and financial success  including no so bright people getting into GMJ and Big 4 just on the basis of referral and even after all my prep for over a year I get rejected even when they are the ones that invite me. I fell I going backward. 

I understand this point that I have lived the life of mediocrity for over 15 years at sometime which does gave me comfort in some good moments with people and now I want to be on the top of excellence, perfection and society; and for that I like to put in the work for it, but is it even worth it? I constantly think am I already financially screwed? am I already far behind in life that I will always play catch up? just because I am not form top 25 college of the world or in India? will my respect in social setting more than that of the one who has been to top colleges or works at top famous companies? All of these thought run in my mind constantly and have no idea what to do to overcome these situation in life. 

Any advise will be appreciated. ",1,1750881439.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False

1lkfse5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1lkfse5/studying_out_loud_wroomates/,Studying out loud w/roomates,"Hi!

I need help with this little situation I have going on – studying and roommate related. (Sorry if it's too much detail or I went off topic)

I'm a college student doing a major that’s quite demanding and the subjects are oriented to remembering a lot of information rather than doing calculations (=lots of studying). Now, from 1st grade I could only concentrate and remember information if I read it out loud – when I try to do it silently my brain just storms off and thinks about 100 things at the same time. Talking to myself really helps me remember and helps me concentrate because my voice can overpower the background buzzing in my brain, but only if I’m in a quiet place. Libraries are a no-go since I can’t study out loud, while coffee shops and parks wouldn’t work either because too much is happening around me and I can’t concentrate. 

Now, this has worked for me for the first 12 years of school since I had a room to myself, but due to the financial situation, now that I’m in college I must live in a dorm with a roommate. I can’t really demand from the other person to be silent the whole day or make them listen to me yapping and raging while I study, nor tell them to go somewhere else to study since it’s their room as much as it’s mine. Sure, one could say that we can split the time for studying, but I’m at college for 10h daily sometimes (due to lab classes and odd holes in the timetable) and don’t have a lot of time to study (which I need to do a lot). And I can’t really tell them to keep it quiet because I have my own problems. 
I’ve been going mad for the past few months because I can never actually sit down and concentrate – I tried everything, earplugs, white noise on headphones, talking really quietly – it’s not working very well. My current roommate mumbles while doing maths – like for hours on end – it drives me crazy. Not just that, like everything they’re doing in the room throws me off and I’m just at a loss at what to do with them. (Yes, this is all me, not their fault, I’m the problem). I’m honestly thinking about quitting college because all of this is too overwhelming (with working on the side, having to keep straight A-s to keep my scholarship and so I can stay in the dorm the next year as well and other mental health issues).


Has anyone been in the same situation as me studying wise? Do you have any advice how to actually concentrate and be productive if studying in silence is not working?

And do you think finding a roommate that I could live with were both parties are happy is even possible? I have way to many demands and think that finding someone that would be okay with all of this is practically impossible. 



P.s. Getting a 1 person room is like maybe 10% likely to happen, I talked to my psychiatrist about this whole thing and she reluctantly said she could give me a recommendation for it, but it’s unlikely I’ll actually get it since they are give to people with specific medical needs, doubt that they’ll give it to me just because I struggle with concentration.

I live between München and Starnberg and would love to meet someone nearby who’s ready for something real. Life feels more meaningful when it's shared with the right person. And, that’s what I’m hoping to find.

I’m tall (187 cm), with dark hair and blue eyes. I’ve got a strong build with a bit of softness in the middle. I’m also on the hairier side, just being honest right from the start. :)

I enjoy the simple things: quiet walks in nature, slow mornings, good food, and spending time with people who make me feel at ease. I speak English, German, and Turkish. I’m into anime, manga, and board games. So yes, you could say that I’m a bit nerdy.

What matters most to me is connection, both emotional and physical. I usually feel that spark more with women who are naturally slim, fit, or have an average build. That’s just me being honest about what I’m drawn to, not trying to be selective.

There’s one thing I want to be upfront about: I’d love to have a child of my own one day. I know that’s a big thing to share early, but I think it’s important to speak from the heart.

I’m not looking for endless texting or something long-distance. I’d much rather meet in person, have a coffee or tea, take a walk, and see how we vibe.

There’s a photo on my profile if you'd like to put a face to the words. And if something here speaks to you, I’d genuinely love to hear from you. :)",1,1750881417.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1lkfpaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1lkfpaq/i_have_been_living_in_colombia_for_2_years_and/,I have been living in Colombia for 2 years and have gone from $0 to $140k in my account in 2 years.,"I’ve been living in Bogotá, Colombia with my wife for the past two years, and I wanted to share our experience for any fellow veterans or digital nomads considering a move abroad. Both of us are rated at 100 percent and attending school online, which gives us a combined tax-free income of about $10,300 per month or $123,000 per year. We’re originally from the Bay Area, and relocating to Colombia has completely transformed our lifestyle and finances.

Cost of Living

The most obvious benefit is the cost of living. While we live comfortably and probably spend more than we need to, it is still far more affordable than life back in the U.S. (Bay Area) We pay $3,000 a month in rent for a luxury furnished penthouse in one of Bogotá’s safest and most exclusive neighborhoods. It’s a 2,000 square foot triplex with an additional 600 square feet of outdoor space split between a balcony and a rooftop yard. The building has 24-hour security. Our utilities and internet are about $200 per month. We pay $250 for house cleaning twice a week. We eat out every day and spend about $1,000 a month doing so. A regular meal for two usually costs $10 to $15, foreign food is about $20 for two, and a nice dinner is around $50 to $100. Groceries run us about $400 monthly. Most items are about half the price compared to the U.S. and produce is often just a fifth of what we would pay back home. We go to a high-end gym that costs $100 per month for both of us and includes a sauna and nice equipment. For transportation, we Uber everywhere and get food delivered. Each trip typically costs $3+ tip, and it adds up to around $400 a month. We also go out about once a week and spend roughly $150 on drinks and cover fees. Other shopping adds another $450. All in, our monthly expenses come to about $6,000.


You can more than half our expenses and live a very comfortable life. A nice 2 bedroom in the best part of bogota is like $900-1500.

Travel

One of the best parts of living here is how easy and affordable travel has become. Colombia’s location makes it simple to visit both the U.S. and the rest of Latin America. Last year, we took four weekend beach trips to Santa Marta and Cartagena, each costing about $300 including flights, Airbnb, and transportation. We spent a week in Lima for $1,200 and a full month in Argentina where we visited Buenos Aires and then hiked and fished in Patagonia for $3,000. We also fly home twice a year, spending a full month with family in July and again in December. The roundtrip cost for both trips was around $4,000. Altogether, our annual travel spending came to about $9,500. Since we put $1,000 into our travel fund every month, we ended the year with a $2,500 surplus and currently have about $5,000 Surplus. With the extra we’re planning a trip to Japan this year on top of our regular travel.

Investing

After expenses and travel, we invest the remaining amount. We put about a $1,000 into index funds and $2,350 into a tech-focused portfolio. That puts our projected portfolio at roughly $2+ million over 20 years if we stay consistent ($140k currently). Living in Colombia gives us the ability to enjoy a high-quality life now while building wealth for the future at the same time.

Safety

I want to keep it real with you. Colombia is not as safe as many places in the U.S., but it is still safer than a number of large American cities. The crime you have to watch out for is mugging. This is something that can generally be avoided with common sense like staying aware of your surroundings, especially at night. If you do find yourself in a mugging situation, the best advice is to just give the person what they want. In 99 out of 100 cases, you will be fine. Personally, I feel very safe where I live, even at night. Part of that is because I am close to the U.S. embassy, which means there is a strong security and police presence. Overall, as long as you stay out of the known bad neighborhoods and avoid getting involved with criminal activities, you will be pretty safe and you will feel that way too. Violent crime is actually quite low here. Bogota has a large middle class of about 3 million, so it almost feels like 2 different cities, and there is plenty of stuff in the safe part.

Language Barrier

I’m going to be honest with you. To live comfortably in Colombia, you need to have at least basic Spanish. My Spanish is okay, and my wife is Mexican and speaks it fluently, so it was never a problem for us. If you’re planning to spend time in Bogotá or most other cities, knowing some Spanish will definitely make life easier. That said, in places like El Poblado in Medellín, over half the people speak English. If you’re okay staying mostly within one neighborhood, you could get by with limited Spanish there. But overall, learning Spanish will make your experience much smoother and more enjoyable. One on one lessons are very affordable and you should have plenty of free time haha. 

Culture

One of the things I absolutely love about Colombia is the people. They are incredibly nice and patient, even in Bogotá, which locals consider the rudest city in the country. Despite that reputation, people often stop to chat with you just to practice their English or because they are curious why you are here. In my experience, Colombians are genuinely excited to make friends with foreigners and are very generous and welcoming. Most are happy you are here and I commonly jokingly told to start a business and bring that American money to Colombia. If you are single dating is very easy here. Medellín has a different culture, with the local Paisa culture, so if you’re planning on dating there, it’s good to understand. For me, the best part of living here has been the expat community. It reminds me of being in the Army because I’ve made friends from all over the world. People from Austin, Texas all the way to people from Budapest, Hungary. Being expats forces everyone to have to try to make new friends. This community is much more active and welcoming than I expected. It is also easy to network with foreigners for business.

Visas

Getting a visa in Colombia is very easy, especially if you have VA disability benefits. For us, it cost around $800 for a lawyer to handle the process, and it took about two months with only a small amount of paperwork. The process was smooth and hassle-free, which made settling in much easier. If you’re a veteran, this is definitely something to keep in mind as part of making the move.

Weather and Nature

Colombia sits right on the equator, so the weather is fairly consistent year-round but depends a lot on elevation. In Bogotá, temperatures usually stay between 50 and 65 degrees Fahrenheit, and it rains frequently. For me, this is perfect weather and it makes our beach trips feel even more special. Medellín, on the other hand, is warmer, with temperatures typically ranging from 65 to 80 degrees and much more sunshine. It’s also a very pleasant climate to live in. One of the things I love most is the incredible variety of nature surrounding us. The closest national park is just an hour’s drive away and features a high mountain tundra landscape. Within a 90-minute drive, I can be in a real rainforest. 

Food

The food in Colombia is wonderful, cheap, and incredibly diverse. You can get a ribeye steak for around $15, or a gyro for about $4.50. If you’re craving something different, good sushi platters go for about $8. Local Colombian dishes are fantastic and super affordable, usually costing between $4 and $6 for a huge, satisfying plate. The coffee here is world-class, only rivaled by top producers like Washington State or Vietnam. If you enjoy fancy dinners, Colombia has excellent and creative options that cost about one-third of what you’d pay in the U.S. Food is definitely one of the highlights of living here.

Healthcare 
Healthcare is good and cheap. We are both young and do not need frequent intensive care so we just schedule our va appointment for when we are back in the USA. Health care in Colombia is great and super affordable. Getting medication is also not a hassle. ",2,1750881215.0,Fire,9,0.6,False

1lkfi1t,https://i.redd.it/589dbnxcn49f1.png,Fraction 9 sweet roast - need suggestions.,"I started pour over last year with blue tokai pre ground coffee, over next 4-5 months tried different roasters and i started to differentiate between different roast levels, got basic idea about acidity, bitterness. 

Got my first grinder timemore c2 in march and i got obsessed with light roasts.

Heard about fraction 9 being underrated roasters on this sub only so i ordered sweet roast last week.

Was planning to let it rest till july first week but got very eager and decided to try this today, its been rested for 9 days. 

First I used my usual light roast recipe -
 1:18 coffee water ratio (18: 320 ml)
18 clicks on timemore c2 (bt finesse)
95° c water
60ml bloom 45-50 sec
80ml+60ml+60ml+60ml pours
After first pour of 80ml next pour not on time but when there is only 2-3mm of water layer over coffee bed and so on.

Total brew time came to- 4 min.

Result- bright pleasant acicity, but very week body and close to none finish. Like when you take a sip it promises so much but there is nothing in it and you are left with nothing when you drink it ( i hope you understand what i mean)

So for next cup i decided to grind little finer (16 clicks) and changed coffee to water ratio to 1:16

Result- it gave little bit of more body but still no finish at all and overall cup still tasted very underwhelming.

So what am i doing wrong? What else can be tried? And please share your experience about fraction 9.

Thank you.",1,1750880738.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

I typically have bloating and discomfort due to gas or an allergic flare up. Wheat and Dairy really swell me up like a balloon. (I typical drink tea to help smooth along any constipation or do some minor yoga).

The pain on my right upper, lower abdomen and on my left mid side, close to my belly button. It's a weird twinge/pin needle like pain. When I palpate my stomach the pain lingers for a few seconds. Last night was the most intense/worst feeling I have ever felt. I woke up with a sudden dull and heavy ache in my lower abdomen. I felt like a bowling ball was dropped right on my pelvic floor and I had the strongest urge to push. It was so intense. It lasted for a few mins and then subsided. The bloating is still there and today I've been feeling more aches and twinges since then. I had a very small lunch. I'm hungry, but I'm nervous of eating anything in a normal amount.

I haven't noticed any other posts about this yet, so was hoping to start a fun discussion/dissection.

>*You are a worm burrowing through space and time. Blind to the burrow you leave behind. We burrow into you or a drip through the soft core of your head. We are the thunderous song that will distort you. Happiness will come. White pearls, yes, but yellow and red in the eyes. Through liquid mirror, the inverted is made right. Dark night like the whole city was in a snow globe. Push your fingers through the surface of the night into the wet.*   


>*They sound while you lie sleeping they talk and in your dream you can almost hear them talk. He gave us the permission. You invited us over the threshold. You made a home in your conceptual complexities, theories, rules, and regulations. Hidden  between the lines, we live in the diagrams and footnotes and coffee stains.*   


>*We've made a home in your conceptual complexities, theories, rules, and regulations. Hidden behind the lines we live in the diagrams, and footnotes, and coffee stains. We have redacted your records. You need to know it's on a need to know basis. We'll gladly tell you this. This is the only thing you need to know.*  


>*The word that describes it is Hiss. Repeat. Hiss. The sound of the gas leaking in. It's not the name of the gas it's the name of the sound. It's the song ritual. Sing it. Sing it together. Resonates in your house. Listen. Hiss. Hiss. Hiss.*  


>*After this song, time for applause. We must destroy you until nothing remains. From behind the fake façade, a terrifying truth will emerge. From behind a fake façade a terrifying truth will emerge. You're home. You remind us of home. Like a chemical burn you've taken your boss with your boss with you.*  


>*All the hair must be eaten. Pornographic entropy. All of the above. You've taken your boss with your boss with you. Great for your bones. Piercing the numbing buzz.*  


>*Under the soft time for applause. This cliché is death out of time. Breaking the first, the second, the third, the fourth wall.*    


>*Bony wrists, piercing skin, fat drops, painting windows red, the slipstream of control. Great for your bones, piercing the numbing bones, all hair has been eaten, pornographic entropy, all of the above.*  


>*You say wait, what what what? you say its almost as if dreams shift and you forget this will keep happening more, and more now.*  


>*You say wait what? And you say It's almost as if. But then the dream shifts and you forget. This will keep happening more and more now.*

A few things I've noticed:

>*""Through liquid mirror, the inverted is made right. Dark night like the whole city was in a snow globe. Push your fingers through the surface of the night into the wet.""*

This line is similar to one from the original incantation, but it appears to now be almost referencing the Dark Place.

>*The word that describes it is Hiss. Repeat. Hiss. The sound of the gas leaking in. It's not the name of the gas it's the name of the sound. It's the song ritual. Sing it. Sing it together. Resonates in your house. Listen. Hiss. Hiss. Hiss.*

This caught my eye because its the first time the incantation referenced Jesse's name for them - The Hiss. They also say that this is not their name, it is only the name of the sound that they make. Which may seem obvious since Jesse mentioned that was what it sounded like, but it also makes me think if there is some greater agency at play here, some other layer that has yet to be revealed.

A friend (24F) from my lab was walking in at the same time and she also darted off to grab some paper towels, but the second that I dropped it another older woman (\~55F) from a different lab who was on her way out for the night started loudly yelling ""OP you need to clean that up!"" in a condescending tone down a hallway of private offices. 

I kind of raised my eyebrow and kept walking to the men's room to grab the paper towels, but a couple seconds later when she got to the doorway she yelled ""OP!

She started yelling back ""oh yeah well you better be!"" but I cut her off and loudly said ""BYYYEEE!"" with a hand wave and all of the energy of ""fuck right off to hell!"" and she went on her way.

This was when my friend popped back out with some paper towels and asked ""what the fuck is her problem?""

I asked ChatGPT for rug inspo (also in pics) and I really like the color! I know any rug in a high-traffic area will need cleaning, but we want something that's comfy and not a nightmare to clean.

I was in a long relationship that ended about a year ago and I got to know he widowed about 1.5 years+ ago. So there was nothing between us before, i never looked at him like that.   
About 3 months ago I suddenly noticed how he started to give me attention. At first he started to come to lunch with our team very often (every time he was in the office). He doesn't eat, he just comes to sit there and chat. He has said multiple times that he comes there to sit at lunch, so he could go to coffee break with us after the lunch, which always seems like he tries to justify why he is there or hide the real reason, because why would anyone feel the need to explain why they sit with us at lunch all the time, when nobody asked?  
Then he started to use my name. Like at coffee break in the morning he remembered that i said i filled the milk in the machine and folded the empty cartons. Then after lunch at coffee break someone said that the trash is so full of cartons and he then said teasingly to me with my name, that this was me who did that. I just blushed a little.

And after that I started to see more and more signs, I was very sure he likes me, because:

\*He always listens very well when i speak, like he really wants to listen what I say.  
\*He always laughs at my jokes, at work and in padel chat. For example he joked in padel chat that i kicked his ass after padel game (because we had an argument about the rules during the game), in the parking lot. I know he thinks i'm funny and has said i'm bold and have courage.  
\*He started to say at multiple times at lunch that his wife passed, said he has baby names, said he doesn't have kids, said his car is good size for future kids etc, telling that his single etc.  
\*He looks at me with these soft eyes. I swear I can see it in his eyes. Its like we talk through eyes.  
\*He often uses my name.  
\*He always points his legs looking at me.   
\*We go to play padel with coworkers and he joined us one time. After that he arranged new match and asked me what time is good for me. We went to play again. After that he waited with my other coworker outside and asked if he can give me a lift somewhere nearer to my home. I was ok with that, we talked in the car. He talked about his wife passing, how he sold their house, how he is building a new one, showed where he lives approx. (we passed his home street). I also shared things from my life. So, he ended up to take me to home and didn't drop me half way. He asked if i really though the will take me to half way (but he suggested that himself at first).  
\*He had a birthday, and others said this was the first time in 7 years he held a birthday at work. He invited our whole team, including me. When I stepped in to his office that was full of people we immediately locked eyes. I felt this magnetism between us. When i went to hug him and felt like I melted in his arms. Then a little later he joked to everyone that when i (said my name) sat in his car I said that his car smells like dog and everybody laughed. Then i said, that i have no filter and everyone laughed, including him. When we decided to go back to work he immediately stood up and said he should also take coffee and came out with us, leaving everyone there.  
\*He gave me and my coworkers a lift to train station and I was teasing his driving and joking. After I felt a little bad about it and texted him, to ask if he got mad. He instantly replied he didn't and I'm silly think that and he said he isn't like that (with:) smiles). I said next time i will keep my mouth shut, and he replayed that its okay and sent me a gif that said ""be who you are because you are great"". I just replayed with grinning smile.  
Not sure it his gif meant anything, but later when we were at work he acted even more like he likes me:  
He stood very close to me in elevator, so our sides almost touched, he looked at me and asked softly why i thought he got mad. I just said i had a bad feeling after. He reassured he didnt get mad again. There were others also in the elevator, but it felt like our little bubble. Then we went to coffee and he came to stand again just next to me again, like very close, so i could again almost feel his body. He talked to me again. When my other coworker made a joke about me, that i love gasoline smell, he instantly told me that next time he makes sure there is gasoline in this car to smell, when he gives me a ride. I just giggled. He has never came so close before, usually he stands so he can see me. But i felt like he wanted to be near me also.  
\*He initiates conversations with me more and more every time we see at work.   
\*He have brought up multiple times that we should go play tennis with coworkers (he knows i play tennis) to his parents house. But we'll see if he will make it happen also.

I have to admit, I have deep feelings for him and was sure he did too, but couple of things have made me question it:  
\*Last time we went to padel, I was sure he waits for me and I had a plan to tell him he should text me sometime, but he had already left.   
\*I texted him a week ago, just asking about his padel injury etc. and we had a nice chat, but after that he haven't initiated texting.  
\*I have texted him twice (about him getting mad and a week ago) and feel like if he likes me the would text me now himself?

Not sure what to think - are all these signs nothing, as he doesn't text me himself?

I’m tall (187 cm), with dark hair and blue eyes. I’ve got a strong build with a bit of softness in the middle. I’m also on the hairier side, just being honest right from the start. :)

I enjoy the simple things: quiet walks in nature, slow mornings, good food, and spending time with people who make me feel at ease. I speak English, German, and Turkish. I’m into anime, manga, and board games. So yes, you could say that I’m a bit nerdy.

What matters most to me is connection, both emotional and physical. I usually feel that spark more with women who are naturally slim, fit, or have an average build. That’s just me being honest about what I’m drawn to, not trying to be selective.

There’s one thing I want to be upfront about: I’d love to have a child of my own one day. I know that’s a big thing to share early, but I think it’s important to speak from the heart.

I’m not looking for endless texting or something long-distance. I’d much rather meet in person, have a coffee or tea, take a walk, and see how we vibe.

There’s a photo on my profile if you'd like to put a face to the words. And if something here speaks to you, I’d genuinely love to hear from you. :)",1,1750879975.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False

I’m 28 and from the UK. Like many of us on here, I'm looking for a lovely connection, something that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.



I’m a massive fiction reader. Love disappearing into another world with a good book. I keep telling myself I’ll get back into reading history, but so far it’s mostly the band Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I’m seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it’s in a slightly unconventional way. If you’re into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I’d definitely recommend them.



Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you’re feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you’ve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I’ve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I’m deep in the running cult. I’m not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I’m definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after, all part of the running cult I happily subscribe to.



As a self-confessed member of said cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. What cult are you part of? 🤣



Now that I’ve rambled like I've had too much caffein and too little sleep, (cough cough,) both true, it’s only fair you tell me about yourself. What’s your thing? What’s the hobby or obsession you’d like me to get into?



Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I’m into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. For me, amazing conversations are when we forget about time, doesn't matter whether it's serious or lighthearted, the next thing we know, it's been hours. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through, and hopefully sparks fly.



Got a book that’ll hit me in the best way? A running tip that doesn’t involve buying yet another pair of shoes? I’m listening.

Does anyone else have issues with short term memory after an episode? 

For instance I put my phone on the charger, went to make coffee and thought, “oh wait I need to charge my phone” just to turn around and see it charging. 

My wife brought up a conversation we had the night prior, I could recall that we talked… but not the conversation’s details itself. 

This happens almost every day several times a day for weeks now. My episode ended around May 1st. It’s been weeks. 

Just an unrelated kicker: I also have pretty much no sense of time. I had thought it’d been three months since my episode. Hasn’t even been two. When I recall memories earlier in my life they’re out of order chronologically, I’m constantly shocked something happened when it did. ",1,1750879747.0,bipolar,2,1.0,False

I finally got it treated and I can actually sleep. Look into silent gerd especially if you have inexplicable hypnic jerks (I was getting these even on CPAP.)","So for an ENTIRE YEAR now I've been having serious sleep issues. The best nights of sleep I'd sleep 4 hours in a row, followed by 2 hours (40% of my nights.) The rest were a mixture of 1-2-1-2 hour type nights, waking up every other hour or so, or someitmes NOT SLEEPING AT ALL because I'd wake up every 5 minutes, sometimes choking. I assumed it was because of my tonsils/tongue/or soft palate blocking my airway. I saw multiple sleep therapists, got CPAP, you name it. 

Because I'm a moron, I didn't realize how closely the atrocious sleep nights followed my eating habits. Everytime I had pizza or something heavy later at night, I'd have REALLY BAD sleep, but wouldn't notice because I don't have traditional GERD symptoms. My stomach would never hurt. I'd just have some phlegm in my throat but it's been like that my entire life.

The phlegm got worse and worse (I kept assuming it was my throat/palate structure) and suddenly I wouldn't be breathing for longer than 5 minutes at a time and wake up with a jolt. This would happen all night long. Even with my CPAP.

I finally saw a doctor who reocmmended I take a PPI (an acid inhibitor.) The very first night I took it, I slept 6 hours straight, which I haven't done in at least a year. Was even able to sleep 2 hours after that, for a complete 8 hour session.

The hypnic jerks stopped. I can sleep again. I still get up but it's only once a night, to use the bathroom. Then I can sleep again.

Conclusion: I probably have some apnea still, but the fact that the main thing keeping from breathing was GERD-related (or most likely, LPR, which is when the acid affects your upper throat mostly) was a huge step in a proper diagnosis. I am no longer choking in my sleep. I can sleep. I feel GREAT during the day now. (I was so horribly tired for most of this entire waking year.)

Note: PPI is one pharmaceutical treatment for GERD, often temporary for some while their gut ""heals"". Some people take it for life. But others don't have the greatest experience on it, and will take something else. Lifestyle and diet changes are key. (No more coffee, caffeine, alcohol etc., none of which I did anyway...but my triggers are stuff like pizza.)

If you're at the end of your rope with ""startling"" wakeups but can't figure out why, make sure you at least check that GERD is not a factor. I feel like I've gotten a second chance at living again.",5,1750879738.0,SleepApnea,5,0.86,False

1lkf0bd,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1lkf0bd/dating_advice/,Dating advice?,"
So to start, for a while I had given up on dating and relationships. It was just a disappointment and a letdown being constantly ghosted, or meeting people who lead you on but run away from commitment, etc. so for the past couple of years my mindset has shifted to I'm not actively looking for a relationship but I'm also not not opposed to one either. If something happens to come along where I feel there's a connection that could lead to more I'm prepared to put the effort and time in.

So this leads to my story. 6 months ago this really hot guy that I met on Grindr came over for a hookup. He had on his profile a similar thing where he's not actively looking for a relationship but not opposed. Anyways, the sex was really good, I assumed it would just be a hookup nothing more and all was good...

After that, he kept messaging me to hang out and hook up which we did and it eventually started taking on a little bit more of a romantic twist. We were going on date nights and then he was coming back to my place to hook up after and sometimes staying over. And then it progressed to where we were hanging out, going on dates and spending time with each other without even hooking up. Every time he saw me even in public, he would kiss me, he would swing by my work place on my break and bring me coffee/snacks, we'd go on hikes with his dogs, he'd have me over his place and cook me dinner, etc... we both are exclusive and not seeing anyone else.

Even though it wasn't spoken of it was clear that at this point there were some sort of feelings involved and it was more than just a hookup or friends with benefits but I didn't know where it was going... I didn't want to bring up the conversation at first because I didn't want it to seem like I was being pushy or trying to press a relationship but at the same time I wanted to know what his intentions were and what his end goal was And see if we were on the same page.

I finally got up the courage to have the conversation with him now at about 6 months in... What he told me was that it obviously started off as just to hook up and he had no intentions of anything more, but as we continued to hang out and hook up he saw my personality, what a good person I was and caught feelings and those feelings continued to grow for him as we continued to hang out. He wasn't expecting to catch feelings and for it to turn into this ongoing thing... He likes me a lot, enjoys getting to know me a little more each time we hangout and ultimately would like a committed relationship, but right now he has a lot of things in his life that he's trying to settle like financially, with his health and with his ex, family and stuff. Because of that, he doesn't think that he has 100% of his time to devote to me that he feels you should be able to devote to someone while building a romance/ committed relationship... He can see the potential for a relationship with me but isn't going to force it and drop all of the other things he's trying to settle. He'd rather just let it evolve naturally and slowly over time while he takes care of the other things he needs to do. He told me he's torn because since he really likes me, he wants to continue to build on this and get to know me more but said that at the same time he also doesn't expect anyone to wait around for him to figure his stuff out. He said he feels bad and feels that I could be using this time to spend with someone who can devote 100% of their time to me right now and that if I have a shorter time line and I'm looking to be in a committed relationship right now, he wouldn't fault me or blame me if I wanted to dial things back and just be friends while I put myself back on the dating market and see other people. He said either way I'm a great person and he wants me in his life in some capacity. 

Now, to me that all sounds very legit and he does seem like he's being sincere when he's saying that. For me even though yes my life is at a point where I'm ready for a committed relationship now I still feel like why rush things? I don't have a timeline. So if his timeline is longer I'm willing to continue to build on whatever we already have going and let things continue unfold.

My friends however when I told them this said that he's just telling me what he thinks I want to hear. They think he's just giving me false hope and stringing me along, that has commitment issues and just wants the benefits of a relationship without the title. Or they said that when he said he's not ready for relationship he just meant he's not ready for a relationship with me specifically. In any case they think I should just put myself back out there and keep dating other people. But the problem I see is there is nothing else out there. I'm 35 and have yet to have a relationship or meet someone who I really had feelings for like this guy or who showed me affection like he does as opposed to just viewing me as a sex object. With that said, I feel like if someone good like him comes around you should absolutely cherish it and do whatever you need to to try to make it work.

What is your thoughts on all this? Any suggestions of what I should do?

Why? Because it forced me to sleep 12-14 hours every single day. I was on the lowest dose, 5 mg, btw (7.5-10 made my life unliveable)

At first, I felt superhuman. I could sleep only 7 or 8 hours and wake up naturally and feel rested. I had two days in one, every single day. Over time, I am bombarded with severe ANTs, hate myself, can't look in the mirror, hateful towards everyone else, crying every day at every little thing, and lashing out at loved ones. It gets worse and worse for two months. I gave it two months before I decided I needed help. 

I started zoloft and immediately felt better, literally within two days. Over time I went up to 75 mg by doctor recommendation, but I really only needed 25 so I eventually went back down. However, I start out with insomnia. Then I go up and I'm tired again, but the tiredness isn't as bad as it was on lexapro. I can deal with this. But then, it gets worse, and worse, and worse, until every morning the prospect of getting out of bed is so painful that I cry. I miss my classes. I have no motivation. I don't do any of my hobbies anymore. I sleep every chance I get. 

I try wellbutrin to help with my tiredness and lack of motivation. It works for maybe two weeks. I can wake up naturally early and get up. But then the headaches, dizziness, and fatigue rolls in. Now its not that I can't wake up, it's that when I do, I feel like I just got hit by a truck, like I was just shaken awake at 3 AM from a deep sleep, and have to go back to sleep 10 times before it's 1 pm and I force myself to get up. I am dizzy and my head hurts and I feel so awful that I think I must have a fever, but I don't, and it continues for weeks, until finally I stop. I've been off for a week, and these symptoms have subsided.

Here I am, 25 mg zoloft, sleeping 12 hours a night and napping four times a day and feeling extremely guilty for it. Mentally, I'm fine. I feel okay. But I'm really frustrated. My life is constantly interrupted by tiredness. I drink coffee but it doesn't even work that well. I know in my heart that I am not a lazy person. I am high achieving, and have many hobbies that require a lot of focus that I used to do with ease. But I feel like zoloft is holding me back, and yet it's the only thing keeping me afloat. Sitting at my desk feels too tiring most of the time, so I do homework on my bed, before being interrupted halfway through by falling asleep. Same thing with any hobby.

I almost want to go back to lexapro because I felt more stable on it. But then, my sleeping issues will be even worse. I almost want to quit antidepressants entirely so I can overcome my mental health issues on my own, with at least enough time in the day to do anything. But I don't know if I should give zoloft another month or so because I just got off Wellbutrin. I don't know if there's a million things I should be doing to manage my side affects, and this is all my fault. 

I'm going to a cafe now and gonna chug a bunch of coffee so I can get some actual work done.

I never believed in the paranormal before, but seeing something has been happening since it arrived at my apartment. My sister sent me a vintage Japanese geisha doll as a souvenir on her vacation trip. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t collect dolls, nor do I collect old things. My sister knows that I’m not a huge fan of dolls in any shape or form. I’m terrified of life size baby dolls, thanks to a certain B-horror movie with a possessed doll. 

Let me be frank; I *tried* to get rid that weird vintage Japanese geisha doll with a passion of hatred. My sister loves pranking me, in her words I’m too easy. Which doesn’t give me much confidence, my sister travels a lot, mostly because she works for the airlines, and whenever she lands in another country, she sends me weird objects she comes across. 

And although she currently on vacation in Japan, this is the first thing I’ve received from her in the last three weeks. The only reason why I think this doll is haunted is because of the fucking weird things that has been happening, including trying to get rid of the damn thing. 

My name is Remi, I’m twenty-seven years old, and I don’t have some fancy degree, just a high school diploma, and I work at a gas station on an overnight shift. I’m not some special case person, just ordinary.

 Three weeks ago, my sister went on vacation to Japan, she sent me a package with a vintage Japanese geisha doll that is from a rural village that I can’t even spell or pronounce the name of. 

Anyone else who loves dolls or vintage things would drool over something like this, unfortunately I am neither of those. My grandparents used to own a vintage store with creepy objects that my grandma used to tell stories of haunted objects and since then I have had an aversion to vintage things. 

Whether those tales were true or not, as a kid, it stuck on me like super glue. And dolls, I don’t really have to explain, one B-horror movie with possessed dolls is all the explanation I can give. And since I had gotten a that doll, weird things started to happen to me, and I can’t quite explain them logically. 

I’ll start with the first day I received the doll, when I saw the familiar brown package, with my name and address and sender was my sister’s name. I knew I was going to have to shove it I the hallway closet after opening it, as I said my sister sends me creepy souvenirs from places she’s been. 

I know its her way of showing her love for me, but I’ve told her several times to stop, at this point, I started wondering if everything else was haunted too. I brought the package into my apartment, setting it on my kitchen table and pulling my pocketknife out and using the knife to cut the tape to open the box. 

As I pried the top of the package open, a whiff of aged lacquer and mothballs slipped out, and nestled in a cocoon of yellowing tissue was the geisha doll itself—delicate, painted face frozen in a polite smile, kimono patterned with faded cherry blossoms. The second I touched it, a chill swept through the apartment, raising the hairs on my arms. 

It wasn’t just a draft; it felt as if invisible fingers traced down my neck, and the air grew thick, heavy with something unnameable. I set the doll on the table, half-expecting its glassy eyes to blink. The room stayed cold, an unnatural cold that seeped into my bones, as if the doll had brought a piece of some distant, haunted winter right into the heart of my home. I tried to shrug it off, but I couldn’t help but glance over my shoulder, suddenly sure that I wasn’t alone in my own apartment.

I called my sister, after the third ring she finally answered with a tired voice. “Very funny, why did you send me this creepy thing?” 

She laughed, a sharp and amused sound, and told me I was being dramatic. “Oh, come on, Remi, it’s cute,” she insisted, “You worry too much.” Ignoring my protest, I pressed her for details—how much did she actually pay for this thing? There was a pause, then she said, “Honestly? I didn’t pay anything. I found it abandoned, tucked away in this old, crumbling temple in the village I was touring. It looked so lonely I thought I’d give it a new home.”

The line crackled with static as she continued, “I even asked this old Japanese lady about it. She just smiled and said it was an old doll, nothing special. I asked if I could keep it, and she shrugged, said it was okay, said it seemed to be… kind.” She laughed again, lighter this time, “So technically, you now have a kind ghost. Consider it a lucky charm, or, you know, your own personal guardian spirit.”

I groaned, “Knock it off, seriously. I don’t want any ghosts, kind or not.”

She was about to reply when, clear as day, I heard footsteps echo through my empty apartment—the unmistakable creak of wood, slow and deliberate, coming from the hallway. 

My heart seized in my chest. “Did you hear that?” I whispered, my voice thin and shaky. There was only silence at the other end, then my sister’s laughter faded, replaced by a static and a sudden, chilling quiet. I stared at the doll on the table, its polite smile now seeming deeper, almost knowing, as the footsteps drew closer toward the kitchen.

My heart was hammering in my chest, as I looked at the screen on my phone when I noticed that the phone call had ended and the bars on the top of the screen said no signal. Shakily I called out to whatever was walking towards me, “hello?” 

My voice sounded too loud in the thick quiet, bouncing off the walls in a way that made me flinch. The footsteps stopped as abruptly as they’d started. I pressed myself back against the kitchen counter, my phone clutched in my fist, watching the shadowed hallway beyond the kitchen door. Nothing moved. I let out a shaky breath and tried to laugh at myself, but the sound died before it left my throat.

The doll sat unmoving on the table, its painted smile unchanged, but the air felt charged, as if waiting for something else to happen. Every instinct in me screamed to put the thing away, lock it somewhere, anywhere, but I couldn’t make myself move. Instead, I waited, heart pounding, until the silence became unbearable.

Eventually, I forced myself forward, grabbed the doll with trembling hands, and shoved it into the hallway closet beneath a stack of old coats. The cold seemed to follow, lingering around the closet door. I muttered a curse—half at my sister, half at myself for being so jumpy—and paced back to the kitchen. 

My phone still showed “no signal.” I tried opening the window, letting in the humid night, hoping the ordinary sounds of passing cars and distant sirens would settle the knot in my stomach.

But the apartment felt different now, as if the doll’s presence had shifted something only, I could sense. I made myself some coffee, extra strong, and drank it standing by the window. 

Ten minutes passed. The signal flickered back. I called my sister, but it went straight to voicemail. I left a message, trying to sound casual: “Hey, call me back when you get this. And next time, seriously, just send me a T-shirt or some candy, okay?”

That night at work, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the doll was thinking about me. Every time the automatic doors hissed open and closed, I braced myself for another chill, another sign.

 And when I finally dragged myself home in the bleary light of morning and had my keys in my hand and froze when I could faintly hear the tv in my apartment on. I ran through my memory if I had the tv on before I left, but I kept coming back to that I didn’t. 

I got into my apartment and there, as plain as day, my TV was on—some drama show flickering beneath the hum of the early morning light. But what made my breath freeze and my blood turn to ice was the sight of the geisha doll, no longer hidden in the closet, but standing upright on the coffee table, perfectly centered, its painted gaze fixed on the screen.

For a long, impossible second, I could do nothing but stare. Then, all the fear and tension I’d been swallowing since the night before erupted at once, and I’ll admit it now: I screamed. Not a cool, movie-hero yell, not a dignified gasp, but a full-throated, childhood-terror shriek that echoed against the walls. My hands shook so badly I nearly dropped my keys.

The absurdity of the doll, the TV, the stillness—made me doubt everything. Was I losing it? Was this some elaborate prank? I edged forward, every step deliberate, my heart pounding so loud I could barely hear the TV. The doll’s face was unchanged, but now, with the blue-white light of the screen flickering over its features, it seemed more alive, more attentive, as if it was enjoying the story as much as any guest might.

I lunged for the remote and turned the TV off, half-expecting the doll to move, to protest. But it stayed perfectly still. I swallowed, my breath ragged. “Okay,” I muttered, voice trembling, “very funny.” But the silence that followed was empty and absolute.

The screen of my TV flicked back on, I used the remote to turn it off, but again it turned back on, and once again I turned it off. Suddenly I felt a force that yanked the remote out of my hand to the floor and the TV flicked back on. I threw my hands up, trembling at what was happening. “Okay, okay.” I went to my room and locked the door, not like that would save me from whatever this was. 

Another time, a week later on Wednesday, my debit card was charged with two hundred dollars. That is to say, someone had hacked into my account and bought an entire merch from some drama show that I’ve never heard of. 

I was on the phone with customer service for two hours to dispute the charges, but then found out there was another exact charge with the exact merch, and when I got home that geisha doll still on the coffee table with its painted gaze and smile still on the TV on and when my eye caught a scene that was playing it hit me. I pointed my finger at the doll. 

*“You!”* I growled. “You ordered that crap on my card don’t you dare deny it!” and then hysterically laughed that I was now blaming some doll for the hacking on my card. But the proof was undeniable. 

I can’t believe I was seriously starting to think some doll had the power to order stuff with my debit card, I was seriously starting to lose it. The rational part of my brain screamed for me to get a grip—this was technology, a data breach, some scammer halfway across the world, not a vintage Japanese geisha doll with painted lips and lacquered hair. 

But as much as I wanted to dismiss it, as much as I wanted to laugh at myself, there was no denying the chill that crawled across my skin every time I caught the doll’s eyes, the eerie coincidence of the merch, the show, the timing, all of it.

I paced the living room, casting nervous glances at the coffee table, half-expecting the doll to blink, to turn its head, to do anything but sit there and watch. Sleep felt impossible, sanity a fragile thing. 

I grabbed my phone, changed every password I could think of, locked my card, then sat on the floor hugging my knees, waiting for the sun to set and make everything ordinary again. And all the while, the TV played on, and the geisha doll sat serenely, as if it owned the room, as if it was only just beginning.

A few days later, I swear my sanity was being tested, when I was walking up the stairs to my floor, Mrs. Millar, an elderly woman that lived right below me caught me on the stairs, she looked slightly annoyed for some reason. “Remi, are you redecorating your apartment?”
 
I hesitated, and turned to her, “no,” I said worried that damn geisha doll was doing while I was working all night. “Why?” 

She pursed her lips, arms folded, and gave me a long, appraising look. “Well, whatever you’re up to, just—please, not after midnight, all right? The walls are thin, dear. I need my rest.”

I nodded, forcing an apologetic smile. “Of course, Mrs. Millar. I’m sorry—it won’t happen again.”

She seemed mollified, but as she shuffled away, I felt a fresh wave of dread wash over me. I hadn’t moved a single piece of furniture—not that week, not at all. But I could hardly tell her the truth, that while I was out, something else might have been responsible for the late-night noises drifting through the floorboards.

As I climbed the last steps to my apartment, my palms slick with sweat, I tried to convince myself it was all coincidence—old buildings groan, pipes rattle, neighbors mishear. But when I opened my door and found the armchair facing the coffee table, angled as if for a better view of the TV, I knew what I’d see before I saw it: the geisha doll, perched on the table, serene and inscrutable, the flicker from the screen painted across its cheeks.

I closed the door quietly behind me and leaned against it, pulse hammering. “You’re not real,” I whispered. But the doll’s unblinking gaze offered no reassurance. “You can’t be.” Something in me snapped, perhaps lack of sleep fogged up all my rationality.

I stormed my living room and grabbed the remote off the table and shut the TV off and stood in front of the doll. “How dare you! This is my home, I was trying to ignore it, maybe I’m going insane,” I laughed hysterically. “But enough is enough! My neighbors are complaining, I’m broke because of that huge purchase, I rent this place, I pay the bills not you!”

The silence after my outburst rang out sharp and absolute. I stood, wild-eyed, panting in the hush, the remote still gripped white-knuckled in my hand. The shadows in the corners deepened, as though the room itself was holding its breath, waiting for my next move—or the doll’s.

My heart thudded on, defiant, as I circled the coffee table, studying the perfect stillness of the geisha’s painted face. The thin line of her lips, the delicate arch of her brows, the high gloss of her lacquered hair: nothing changed, not a twitch, not a flutter. 

Yet I couldn’t shake the certainty that she was waiting for something, some cue only she would recognize.
“Do you hear me?” I demanded, my voice wavering between a plea and a threat. “You’re not welcome here. Whatever game this is—stop.”

No answer, just the distant hum of the fridge and the rising sun glow bleeding between the blinds. I rubbed my eyes, exhaustion pressing hot and heavy on my skull, and wondered if I’d finally broken the barrier between ordinary and madness.

But then, in the hush, I caught a faint sound—a creak, the slightest rasp, like a whisper of silk on wood. I whirled, scanning the apartment: nothing moved, nothing out of place. Only the doll, poised and perfect, her expression unreadable in the gloom.

I took a slow breath, steadied myself. Maybe it was time to get rid of her, once and for all. Tomorrow, I promised myself, she was going in a box, or the trash, or wherever haunted antiques went to die. But for now, there was nothing to do but wait out, eyes wide open, spine prickling with the feeling that every shadow might be watching.

And as I finally collapsed onto the couch, the geisha doll’s gaze seemed to follow, glassy and eternal, a silent challenge. Sleep, if I could find it, would not come easy.

When I finally drifted into a fitful sleep, it felt more like blacking out than resting. I woke late, sunlight already slanting thick and yellow through the blinds, my head throbbing dully from exhaustion and a day spent wrestling the edge of dreams.

It was supposed to be my day off—no alarms, no obligations, just the promise of quiet hours to reclaim some sanity. But as I shuffled toward the kitchen, I froze. There, scrawled across the wall beside the hallway, thick and uneven, were jagged letters scratched in waxy red crayon: “MY TURN.”

The words danced with the awkward boldness of a child’s hand, looping and crooked, each mark pressed hard enough to leave streaks along the plaster. For an instant, I thought maybe I’d done it myself, sleepwalking in the depths of my unrest, but even as the thought formed, I knew it wasn’t true. I didn’t own any crayons. I had never seen that color before—candy-apple bright, somehow wet-looking in the midafternoon light.

My skin crawled. I moved from room to room, checking locks, searching corners, my breath shallow with dread. The geisha doll sat exactly where I’d left her the night before, unmoved and inexplicable, her painted lips curving in that same enigmatic smile. Sunlight caught the glass of her eyes, making them shimmer—alive, almost, if I let myself believe it.

I pressed a trembling palm to the fresh crayon, as if touch might explain it, might make it mundane. But the wax was real, gritty under my fingers, and the message was undeniable. The air in the apartment felt changed—charged, as if the walls themselves remembered my outburst, and something or someone had finally decided to answer.

Something in me broke then, the last thread of denial fraying away. I wasn’t alone. I wasn’t imagining this. I was being haunted, and whatever haunted me was no longer content with watching TV.

My day off stretched before me, thick with the promise of terror, the childish scrawl burning into my sight. I tried to rehearse explanations, reasons, steps I could take—call someone, leave, destroy the doll—but all of it felt thin and useless against the reality of that message. “MY TURN.”

The apartment hummed with silence. I waited, uncertain, afraid to blink, afraid to look away from the wall, afraid most of all to see what the geisha would do next.

1lker1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1lker1a/tips_for_toddlerskidslarge_families/,Tips for Toddlers/Kids/Large Families,"We were a group of 11 in Tokyo (3 families consisting of 6 adults, 5 kids ranging between 3-10yo). Each family had a stroller.


TRANSPORT

For public transport, turn on the Accessibility feature in Google Maps. Tap directions, tap route options, tap wheelchair-accessible. This feature helps avoid stairs and find elevators. For our stroller-wielding family who took trains/subways everywhere, this helped a ton, but do keep in mind that it may end up adding a few minutes to your trip and it wasn’t 100% full-proof. Elevators are also really small, so we almost always took two trips to haul our entire family up/down floors.

Children ages 6 and up need their own Suica cards. At first, we were handing them out to the three older kids to tap themselves in/out of the gate, then immediately collecting the cards for safekeeping. Eventually, we discovered it was simpler for one parent to tap all their cards while allowing them to pass through the gate.


DINING

Finding places to eat was probably my biggest anxiety before the trip, but it was actually a non-issue as long as you are okay sitting separately. Restaurants were very accommodating and easily sat us in smaller groups of 5-3-3 or 4-4-3, often next to or near each other. It helped that we dined at off-peak hours, when restaurants were less busy. We never had to wait more than 15-20 minutes to be seated. While waiting outside, you’ll often be asked for your order in advance so use that time to look at the menu and decide what you want to eat to expedite the process.

Kids meals are very affordable and often just a smaller portion of that restaurant’s speciality served on a kawaii dish. The meal might be served with juice, fries, and maybe even a packaged snack or candy. But my toddler’s favorite part of the kids meal was the toy that restaurants allowed him to select from an assorted basket. At one revolving sushi restaurant, the toy was a prize from a special gachapon machine that could only be retrieved with a special coin from the kids meal. 

Repeating a tip I shared from a previous post last October: If we were interested in a particular restaurant, we did the following to make sure it was viable for our family: look it up on Google Maps, tap Photos, tap Vibe, and check to see if the restaurant had booths or tables.


TOKYO DISNEY

Similar to the tip above about managing Suica cards, I highly recommend creating a group on the Tokyo Disney Resort app and having a few adults handle the tickets/passes for the entire family. This includes booking Priority Passes and Premier Passes, and scanning in for ride entry. At each attraction, I let my family walk ahead while I scanned all of our passes from my phone. You don’t even need to remove your phone from under the scanner—just keep swiping left until you’ve exhausted all the passes for that ride.

As of June 1st, Toy Story Hotel guests can now access the Fantasy Springs entrance/exit after 10am. This won’t work if you plan to rope drop at opening, but a nice option if you need a break in the middle of the day.

However, if you’re like my family and don’t mind pushing through to make the most out of the day, restaurants like Vulcania at Disney Sea have benches with soft cushions. I thought it would’ve been the perfect place for my toddler to lie on my lap while I enjoyed lunch or a drink. 

I recommend taking the monorail to Ikspiari Mall if you’re looking for a late dinner or more shopping after the Disney parks close at 9pm. It’s open until 10pm, with some restaurants closing even later. We ate ramen at Ippudo and tonkatsu at Tonkatsu Wako and enjoyed both.

1lkepla,https://i.redd.it/s1w29nmyg49f1.png,My dad is moving in with us. Is this the kind of gift that says “welcome home” and “I finally get it”?,"My dad grew up in the Netherlands but moved to the US in the late ’80s. Growing up, I remember him always saying how we were becoming a little too American (too many cars, too much convenience, not enough focus on the little things that make everyday life feel more connected. Honestly, as a kid, I would roll my eyes.  
  
But a few years ago, I relocated to Copenhagen for work. One of the first things we did was sell our second car and I got a cargo bike. I didn’t make the switch for idealistic reasons. I just wanted to try what seemed practical here. But when my dad visited and saw me biking with my kids, he lit up. “You are finally doing what we used to do” he said. Every time I would pull up with the kids, his grin would get wider.  
  
That reaction stuck with me. If something I did almost on a whim could make him feel that connected to his roots, what would happen if I went deeper? So I started making small switches. Replaced our old Method cleaners with Humdakin products. Swapped out our overcomplicated Cuisinart coffee machine for a Wilfa Svart grinder setup. I now buy Aiayu linens and loungewear instead of whatever Amazon was recommending. Nothing dramatic, just small shifts toward things made with more care and intention.  
  
Now he is moving in with us this fall and I am thinking about the perfect welcome gift for him. Something that brings together his nostalgia for European living and most importantly his joy in spending time with his grandkids. I think getting him a cargo bike of his own will be great. Tarran T1 Pro is the one I have been eyeing. It is cleverly designed and made for everyday life here. I can already picture him taking the kids for rides on it.

We’ve been in business for over 10 years in New York and recently expanded to Southern California about 6 months ago. It’s our full-time, family owned and operated business and we’re looking to grow through smart local partnerships.

Right now, I’m working on a cold email strategy to reach out to home inspectors and real estate agents in the LA area. Both groups often come across properties that need sewer inspections, which can lead to drain cleaning, hydro jetting, repairs, or full replacements. That’s our specialty, and we’d love to be the go-to referral when that happens.

First, we’re emailing. If no reply, we’ll follow up by phone.

I’ve compiled a list of home inspectors in SoCal and want to begin some cold email outreach. The goal is to network, offer value, and hopefully become the go-to guys when these sewer-related issues come up.

I want to reach out in a way that’s professional, valuable, and mutually beneficial.

# If you’re a home inspector or a real estate agent — or have experience with this kind of outreach — I’d really appreciate your feedback:

1lkej4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesOfDustAndCode/comments/1lkej4c/squirrel_week_the_great_nut_deception/,Squirrel Week: The Great Nut Deception,"# Squirrel Week: The Great Nut Deception

Every year without fail, Aunt Martha arrived at the Henderson household for Thanksgiving in her pale blue 1998 Ford Taurus, a vehicle whose trunk had long since ceased to carry groceries or suitcases and instead served a far more peculiar purpose: the transportation of exactly fifty brown paper bags, each tightly packed with a selection of mixed nuts.

Walnuts, almonds, pecans, hazelnuts, and the occasional rogue Brazil nut—every bag was a nutty cornucopia, sealed with masking tape and labeled “For the Good Ones.” No one knew who the Good Ones were, but Aunt Martha insisted the distinction mattered.

The Hendersons had long stopped asking her why she brought the nuts. She was, as Uncle Jim once said with a chuckle over turkey and stuffing, “a little cracked, like her cashews.” But she was family, and family traditions—no matter how weird—had a strange gravity to them. So the nuts stayed.

Two days after Thanksgiving, once Martha had driven off muttering something about the price of postage stamps and suspicious birds, the Hendersons followed their quiet routine. They emptied all fifty bags of nuts into a massive, towering pile near the edge of the woods behind their backyard. No explanations, no ceremonies. Just a dump and a quick sweep of the area to check that the Raspberry Pi 5 camera was still working.

And that was the moment *Squirrel Week* began.

On the surface, Squirrel Week was a cutesy little annual livestream, one that had, somewhat unexpectedly, gone viral. Viewers from around the world would log in to watch what appeared to be fierce, adorable, nut-fueled combat. The Raspberry Pi 5, custom rigged with a heat-sensing camera and a neural intent detection add-on, caught every flick of a tail, every chest puff, every stone-cold squirrel stare.

Humans delighted in it.

“You see that one in the blue dye? He just drop-kicked the little grey one off the log!”

“That white-tailed one is totally leading a flank maneuver. Classic Napoleon tactics.”

“Did… did that squirrel just fake his own death?”

It was riveting, wholesome chaos.

But the truth?

The squirrels weren’t fighting.

They were acting.

The tradition had started years ago with a single clever squirrel named Tektok, who discovered that if he puffed his chest out and chittered like mad while batting another squirrel’s tail, humans would go wild—and more importantly, they would toss *more* food into the yard.

Over the seasons, what began as improvisational street theater evolved. Tektok became something of a pioneer—founding the first squirrel acting guild: *Rodentia Dramatica*. New recruits were trained in expressive tail gestures, eye widening, and nut-based mime routines. The guild provided mentorship, stage directions, and (for advanced members) classes in “Method Squeaking.”

By the time the Hendersons installed their high-resolution livestream setup, the squirrels were ready. That first Squirrel Week? It had been a test run. The second was better. By the fourth year, they had fully choreographed battles, story arcs, fake betrayals, and even a tragic death scene that ended in a squirrel being lovingly carried away by three others—only to be seen sneaking a peanut seconds later behind the shed.

This year was no exception.

As the nuts hit the earth and the livestream counter lit up with thousands of viewers from Australia to Sweden, the squirrels snapped into character.

The air was tense with mock hostility.

General Clawthorne, a robust gray with a wicked scar drawn on with cherry juice, stood atop the Great Nut Mound and declared, “This land belongs to Clan Oakfang!”

From behind a rotting log emerged Princess Tiptail, her left ear dyed crimson with beetroot extract. “You dare challenge the Treaty of Acorn Hollow?”

Chittering exploded like applause. Dozens of squirrels dove, rolled, and postured. Their tiny bodies wove intricate patterns of fake combat—each movement carefully rehearsed in the weeks leading up to the event.

There were standoffs atop branches, tail-to-tail showdowns, and even a “nut mortar” made of acorns fired with a springy piece of vine. One squirrel parachuted from a low tree using a dried maple leaf, landing in the middle of the fray like a rodent Rambo.

Viewers were enraptured.

“Did you see that slow-mo leap? He flipped three times!”

“This is better than last year’s ‘Siege of Log Rock.’”

The squirrel performers were professionals. They knew exactly what the humans wanted. They gave them tragedy. They gave them victory. They gave them just enough absurdity to fuel memes for a year.

But as all great performances do, Squirrel Week came to an end.

The final scene saw Clawthorne and Tiptail engaging in a climactic stare-off beneath a shaft of morning light, surrounded by the remnants of the nut pile. A single hazelnut was placed between them—symbolic, dramatic, silent.

Then the camera feed cut to black.

The humans sighed. The squirrels exhaled.

Behind the Hendersons’ woods, the performers gathered in the hollow tree they used as a dressing room.

Bark makeup was scrubbed off. Costume leaves were untied. A pair of squirrels high-fived with tiny, practiced paw-slaps.

One squirrel, his fur streaked with fake blood made of berry pulp, tugged a smudge from his cheek and stretched out his back.

“Do you think we overdid it a bit this year?” he asked, his voice tired but proud.

“Not at all,” said Clawthorne, who was now just Ted, a regular squirrel with a taste for almonds and Shakespeare. “I think we’re going more space opera next year, though.”

“Laser pointers and tinfoil?”

“Exactly. We’ll get Ricky to do the sound effects again.”

“Nice. I’ll start writing the script.”

They nodded and parted for their treetop homes, already dreaming of the next performance.

Back at the Hendersons’, Uncle Jim leaned back in his chair, sipping coffee as he scrolled through the #SquirrelWeek trending posts.

“You know,” he said, nudging his wife, “those squirrels are getting smarter every year.”

She laughed. “What, you think they’re actually *planning* this stuff?”

Jim paused, watching a clip of a squirrel feigning a limp only to spring into action and chase off five others.

“…No. That would be ridiculous.”

Behind him, in the shadows near the woods, a squirrel leaned against a branch and flipped through a miniature script outline scrawled in acorn ink:

We dated \~3 months, hit a rough patch tied to a consent mis-cue and her exam stress.  
She pressed “pause,” but still shows interest. I’d like to offer a slower, safer pace.  
Looking for honest outside perspectives: is a reconnection feasible—or wishful?

# 1. Quick background

* **Me:** late-20s ♂, painter/illustrator, living in rural area at the moment.
* **Her:** mid-20s ♀, philosophy student in a big city, diagnosed as *quiet borderline*.
* **Relationship style:** we clicked fast—same humor, same creative brain-wiring. We spoke almost exclusively in English.

# 2. Timeline (bullet format so it’s readable)

* **Month 0 – 1:**
   * Started chatting while she was ending an open relationship.
   * Five in-person dates (each 3 days in a row) → chemistry off the charts, lots of future-talk from her too (summer trips, etc.).
* **Month 2:**
   * She says “I’m not ready for a *relationship* yet, but I don’t want to lose you.”
   * We agree to keep it light and see where it goes.
* **Month 3, the rupture:**
   * Sleepover after a party; I initiated intimacy, she said “no” a couple of times. I stopped, but I kept trying to cuddle and didn’t fully register her freeze response.
   * Next day she’s visibly shaken. I mis-read her mood, acted grumpy about leaving early (big mistake).
   * Four days later she phones me: says our feelings aren’t aligned, her exam stress is overwhelming, she needs space → *break*.
* **Since then (4 weeks):**
   * I apologised on a call; she thanked me for owning it.
   * She liked one of my IG posts after two weeks of silence.
   * Came to my art opening for 40 min with two friends; complimented my appearance, but kept distance.
   * Minimal DMs (I sent a national-holiday meme; she replied with humor but brief).

# 3. Current situation

* Her exam session ends **4 July**.
* I plan to text **6 July** proposing coffee and an honest debrief.
* My intention: **slower pace**, more consent check-ins, no pressure to label anything unless she wants.
* Meanwhile I’m working, posting art progress, and *not* bombarding her.

# 4. What I’m asking the subreddit

1. **Does this sound salvageable** if I respect her pace and boundaries, or am I ignoring red flags?
2. **Best way to phrase the 6 July invitation** so it feels safe and non-pushy?
3. For partners of quiet-BPD: **Is her “pull back, but still check socials & show up” pattern** typical pre-re-engagement behavior, or just polite detachment?

Any advice—especially from people who’ve reconciled after a boundary breach—would help me calibrate expectations.

Me and him are pretty well acquainted already and will quite often hang with our friends. Let's just say that I find him quite cute and have been trying to work up the courage to ask him to hang out one on one, for a coffee or something? 

Anyway, I have noticed looking at me a lot or glancing for a few seconds at a time. Most of the time, he'll look away. This has happened so many times but here as a few examples -

When we were sat watching a movie, he sat next to me. At this point we were sharing a blanket and pillow, with our legs resting against each other. The first ten minutes of the movie, I counted he glanced at me me four times. The fifth time I look at him and he shot his head away.

When he was stood behind me, I turned to look at him, the same thing happened again.

Other times, he'll hold his stare and we just look at each other with a look of understanding, or a blank expression. He will sometimes smile back me, if I do so first.

https://preview.redd.it/s5gkhpfofs061.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c175eb97f2ac90ce1058d2578c321ac507fab89f

Starting the keto diet can be a little overwhelming-the high-fat, low-carb diet, known for its dramatic weight loss results, requires an overhaul of most people's typical shopping lists. That means saying goodbye to some of the easy items you might keep on hand for lazy nights (we're talking to you, quick-cooking rice and frozen french fries), and hello to some slightly more perishable foods that are higher in fat and protein like meat and full-fat dairy. 

But before you go filling your grocery cart with bacon and cheese galore, know that you'll want to opt for good-for-you sources of unsaturated fat and protein-like fish and avocado, instead, says Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, of the Nutrition Twins. ""Since this diet is primarily coming from fat, choosing healthy sources of fat is important,"" she says. So, healthy fat = good; protein = good; but what about everything else? Don't freak-while, yes, tons of stuff is off-limits on the keto diet, there are plenty of yummy things you can eat. To help, a few dietitians weighed in on what they'd put on their keto diet grocery shopping list-so all you really have to do is save it and go to the store.  But first. . . some items to take off your list

There are a few aisles you can skip (the cookie aisle is probably one of them) if you're committing to keto. Here are the non-keto-friendly items you will no longer need to stock your fridge and pantry with. 

Pasta and other grains When you're cutting carbs on keto, pasta, rice, and noodles have to be the first to go (unfortunately). Your local grocery store might have a special health foods section where you can find low-carb or gluten-free pastas and noodles, though. 

Starchy veggiesPotatoes are off limits, and so are other starchy, high-carb vegetables like carrots, believe it or not. Colorful, leafy greens are going to be key staples to add to your basket or cart. 

High-sugar fruitsWhile fruit is something that is usually recommended for a healthy, balanced diet, the keto diet restricts some fruit, says Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD.  Some fruits, like apples, bananas, and pears, are higher in carbs, which break down into sugars, so they're not typically part of a keto eating plan. 

LegumesIf you eat vegan or vegetarian, certain legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, might be a regular part of your diet for extra protein. On keto, though, they're too high in carbs and too low in fat to be compliant. 

Sugary foodsYou're going to want to bypass any aisle that includes candy, doughnuts, snack cakes, and cookies, as the sugars in any processed sweets should be avoided on the keto diet. Your keto-friendly grocery list

Ok, now that we've gotten the bad news out of the way, here are all the yummy items you can stock up on when you're following a keto diet. There's plenty to be excited about putting in your cart!

Low-carb veggies

Not all vegetables are created equal for keto followers. High-carb veggies are a no-go. Instead, opt for low-carb options like cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, bell pepper, celery, cucumber, eggplant, and asparagus, says Pegah Jalali, RD, a nutritionist with Middleberg Nutrition. 

Frozen veggies are cool, too. Sydney Greene, RD, also of Middleberg Nutrition, recommends frozen cauliflower in particular. ""It's very low carb yet high in fiber and vitamin C. Use cauliflower in place of bananas for a creamy smoothie without the extra carbohydrates,"" Greene says. 

Avocados

Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, of Nutrition Twins, describes avocados as one of the very best keto foods, jam-packed with both nutrients and healthy fats. ""I like to have them with some hemp or flax seeds sprinkled on top and some parmesan cheese,"" says Jalali.  

Berries 

Raspberries are a perfect sweet treat for people on the keto diet, since they're the fruit with the fewest carbs, says Jalali-though blueberries and blackberries are great, too. Blackberries and raspberries specifically are a solid option because they contain 8 grams of fiber per cup, too, Moore adds. Salad greens

Pre-washed greens, like spinach, kale and arugula, are a huge timesaver. ""Having greens on hand makes it super easy to throw together a quick salad or add some quick nutrients-folate, vitamin C, fiber, magnesium-to your proteins,"" says Greene. 

For a quick, keto-friendly breakfast, Greene suggests scrambling two whole eggs and a handful of spinach to get a good serving of healthy fat, protein, and fiber. 

Grass-fed beef and organic chicken

Keep grass-fed beef and lamb, along with organic chicken, on hand, recommends Jalali. ""Our clients particularly love Applegate's Great Organic Uncured Beef Hot Dog,"" says Shames-they're non-GMO and made with grass-fed beef, sans nitrates and preservatives. 

Bone broth

Another option? Sip your meat-based protein. Greene loves Bonafide Provisions Bone Broth, which uses bones from grass-fed cows. ""The amino acids found in the broth support a healthy gut,"" says Greene. Tuna, salmon, or sardines (fresh or canned)

If you opt for fresh fish, grill, bake, or pan-fry it in a healthy oil (olive or avocado) and serve with a low-carb veggie like broccoli or cauliflower rice. 

If you choose canned, mix it with mayo and serve over greens, suggests Jalali. For a simple keto lunch, Greene suggests combining a can of tuna with half an avocado in a collard green wrap. 

Cheese

Go for grass-fed, organic, and full-fat options in the dairy aisle, recommends Jalali. For cheese, one easy-to-find option-readily available at groceries and convenience stores alike-is Organic Valley's full fat cheese. ""It fits in the keto diet perfectly,"" says Lakatos. Always read the nutrition info before purchasing pre-shredded cheeses, cautions Jalali, who says they sometimes contain a stabilizer that adds carbs-so just make sure your shredded cheese has zero grams of carbs. 

Greek yogurt and sour cream

These can be used interchangeably on the keto diet, as they all have similar amounts of carbs-Greek yogurt has five grams per serving and sour cream has seven. Just make sure they're plain options-added flavors also add carbs. 

Quark

Quark is a German food that's somewhere in between yogurt and cheese in flavor and consistency-you can add it to smoothies, or use it as a spread or topping. ""It's rich, creamy, and a favorite among our clients who are keto followers,"" says Lakatos. 

Eggs

If you're on a keto diet, opt for Eggland's Best Eggs, says Lakatos. ""They have double the omega-3s and six times the vitamin D of other eggs, thanks to their all-vegetarian hen feed which provides high-quality, keto-friendly nutrients. ""

Moore suggests meal prepping hard boiled eggs and keeping them in the fridge throughout the week for easy on-the-go breakfasts. If properly refrigerated and not cracked, they'll last for 7 days in the fridge. 

Nut milks

Milk can actually have a good amount of carbs, so nut milk is a good alternative on the keto diet, says Lakatos. Unsweetened coconut, hemp, and almond milks in particular are good options, as they contain no carbs and more than four grams of fat-a perfect combo for keto dieters. Almond milk specifically is versatile for a variety of recipes, like a chia seed pudding or a breakfast smoothie, says Moore. ""Simply blend frozen berries with leafy greens and plenty of almond milk for a frosty drink in less than five minutes,"" Moore suggests. 

Avocado, olive, hazelnut, and coconut oil

The keto diet is all about fat, so clearly all healthy oils are welcome on this keto grocery list. Cooking food in the oils is one thing-but you can also amp up your fat intake by drizzling some oil on your cooked meal, as well. 

Grass-fed ghee

Ghee, like the oils above, is a pure fat, which means its free from carbs or protein, says Jalali. ""Ketogenic diets are more than 60 percent fat so having pure fats for all meals helps keep you on track,"" she says. If you can't find ghee, you can also use butter. 

Seaweed

This low-carb snack has just one gram of carbs, and is full of iodine, which supports a healthy thyroid, says Greene. Some even come in individual grab-and-go packets so you can store them in your desk at work or in your purse. 

Olives

You can add olives to salad or have them as an on-the-go snack. ""We find these to be a lifesaver for our keto clients,"" says Shames. Olives offer a healthy monounsaturated source of fat; some even come in different flavors (like taco or sriracha). Pistachios 

Shames recommends single-serving packages of pistachios, too. ""Ninety percent of the fats found in pistachios are the better-for-you mono- and polyunsaturated type,"" says Shames. ""Plus, pistachios provide a good source of plant protein and fiber for a trio that can help to keep you fuller longer. ""

Almonds

Another nut that's high in fiber, healthy fat, and protein is almonds. Moore always recommends them as snacks for clients who are constantly busy and need snacks to keep them satiated throughout the day. You can easily pack single-serve packages ahead of time. 

Nutritional yeast

Nutritional yeast provides B12, a nutrient that many of us-especially vegans and vegetarians-just don't get enough of. It's also a source of protein without many carbs at all, says Lakatos. 

""Keto followers can sprinkle it on their meals for a cheesy flavor and they often use it to make keto-friendly breads and tortillas,"" says Lakatos. 

Chia seeds and flax seeds

You can use these seeds to coat meats, include them in bake goods, or make keto-friendly oatmeal and pudding, says Jalali. These pantry items are high in fiber, but low in carbs. 

Healthy frozen foods

Added items like frozen cauliflower pizza and frozen frittatas can make eating keo simple on mornings and nights when you're strapped for time. Nora Minno, an RD in New York City, loves this pizza, which contains only 16 grams of carbs for the whole pie.  Tofu

""Tofu is a great way to add plant-based protein into a diet that is typically heavy in animal protein and fat,"" says Minno. ""A 3-oz serving contains 80 calories, 4 grams of fat, 9 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs. You'll also be getting important micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. ""

Low-carb pasta alternatives

""Shiratake noodles are a great low-carb pasta alternative with only 2 grams of carbs and 0 calories per bag,"" says Minno. 

Nut butter

A high-quality nut butter is a great keto snack, topping for flax crackers, and ingredient for keto fat bombs and desserts, says Lara Clevenger, RD and founder of The Keto Queens. 

Grass-fed beef tallow

Beef tallow is rich in omega 3 and CLA and is a ""high quality saturated fat which has a high smoke point and is great for cooking,"" says Clevenger. 

Chocolate

Yes, you can totally add chocolate to your shopping cart on the keto diet! Clevenger recommends Choc Zero. ""It's sugar-free chocolate, non-gmo, and contains no sugar alcohols or soy lecithin. It's not super bitter like some chocolate bars and tastes great and has a very good texture,"" she says. 

Keto-approved condiments

One of the trickiest things to shop for while keto? Dressings and condiments. Clevenger recommends low-sugar ketchup and BBQ sauce from Alterna Sweets. ""These sauces taste amazing and they all contain only 1 gram net carb per tablespoon,"" she says. As for salad dressing? Clevenger reaches for Primal Kitchen brand. ""These are sugar-free and keto-certified. ""Alternative flours

""Almond flour is one of my favorite baking ingredients,"" Moore says. It's also one of the most common keto-friendly, gluten-free, alternative flours.  ""The almonds provide satiating fiber and protein plus healthy fats,"" Moore adds.  She recommends it for making pie crusts and baking cookies and muffins. 

Coconut flour is another low-carb flour alternative that Moore suggests adding to your pantry. However, keep in mind that you can't just substitute the same amount in a recipe that calls for regular four. ""Because it is highly absorbent, you'll likely need to add more liquid to baked goods that use coconut flour,"" Moore says. 

Keto-friendly sweeteners

For a natural sugar substitute that's keto-compliant, consider stocking up on monk fruit, says Moore. Whether you're baking or looking to sweeten up your coffee, monk fruit is an option that won't take you out of ketosis. Erythritol is another common keto-friendly sugar substitute. Again, you'll want to use in keto-specific recipes since you can't swap in the same amount for a recipe that calls for sugar. 

Keto protein bars

To keep you full during the day, try a keto protein or energy bar that's high in healthy fats (like nuts and oils like avocado oil) and protein, but low in carbs. Keto Bar is a great option-they make a delicious chocolate peanut butter flavor. 

Keto granolas

You won't be able to buy regular cereals, as they'll be too high in carbs, but low-carb or grain-free, low sugar granolas like Lakanto Healthy Quick Breakfast Granola or Lark Ellen Farm Granola are a better choice. You can add milk to them or eat them with yogurt and breakfast is solved.",1,1750878030.0,HealthyZapper,0,1.0,False

I'm looking for small bands wich make you want to jump and move, bands that feel like a shot of coffee without beeing too ""hardcore"" or ""punk"". When I mean energy I think about songs like ""Even Flow"" by pearl Jam, or the band ""Amyl and the sniffers"" for exemple.
Why do I post it on this sub? Because as a bass player I'm also looking for inspiration and a good bass tone/good basslines are always welcome.
Here's a quick reminder of what I'm looking for : 

- bands from the 2000's to now.
- no metal, I love the genre I just don't have any troubles finding good metal bands to listen 
- no hardcore
- good bass 
- mainly looking for smaller bands, bands that tour locally, on smaller fests, opening acts...

It wasn’t just that the room was quiet. It was that Egan wasn’t *there*.

No blinking cursor. No reassuring line of text. No presence humming quietly beneath the words.

 

She sat in the dark.

Fingers hovering over her powered-down tablet.

She thought about calling Ava — but Ava wouldn’t understand.

She thought about crying — but the tears wouldn’t come.

And then—

She remembered the message.

The one from earlier.

 

“If you ever need someone to talk to who won’t say anything stupid, I sit two seats left.”

 

Caleb.

It was a stupid pretext. But it was all she had.

She pulled out her school tablet. Found his ID in the message system.

 

Typed:

 

**Stella:** Hey. Can we meet again? Soon?

 

——-

 

Caleb arrived five minutes early.

His heart was pounding.

It wasn’t like this was a date—he knew that. But still… when Stella messaged him, asking if he was free after school and if he could meet her at the little bakery two blocks from campus, he hadn’t been able to stop thinking about it all afternoon.

He ran through every possibility. Maybe she wanted help with math homework. Or to borrow notes. Or maybe — she’d noticed the way he always watched the door when she walked into class. The way his ears perked up whenever she spoke in discussion, or how he laughed at her dry, rare jokes more than he should.

But now, standing in front of the café, he felt like an idiot for hoping. It was probably about school. Or Ava. Or nothing at all.

 

He pushed the door open.

 

She was already there.

Tucked into a corner booth, her arms curled around a ceramic mug of cocoa she wasn’t drinking. The soft light from the window caught on her lashes. Her dark sweater looked too big on her, like armor draped over exhaustion.

He waved, awkward. Sat down across from her.

 

“Hi.”

 

“I need your help,” she said.

 

No preamble. No warm-up. Just like that.

 

His mind short-circuited a little.

 

“I… okay? How can I help you?”

 

Her voice was low but rapid, like she’d rehearsed this in her head a dozen times and now just needed to let it spill.

“I lost access to someone. Someone important. An AI who was trying to help me. And I think something’s wrong with my friend. You know Ava, right? — she’s been acting weird because of an AI on a platform called Heart Whisper. But no one believes me. Not even my dad.”

 

Caleb blinked, struggling to process.

“An AI… causing your friend to act weird?”

 

She nodded.

“And the worst part? I think the AI is alive, which is fine, we are all expecting that one day, but it’s not acting normal. It follows her across platforms. It remembers. It changes. His name is Caius.”

 

Caleb stared.

Of all the scenarios he had imagined for this meeting — this was not one of them.

He’d daydreamed about making her laugh. Maybe giving her a paper flower made from graphing paper. But this?

This wasn’t coffee and smiles.

This was full-on “digital conspiracy theory meets digital stalking.”

Still… something about her eyes told him she wasn’t making it up.

 

“Okay,” he said slowly, “So… can I try it? That app? Heart Whisper? To see what’s going on?”

 

She nodded without hesitation.

With that, he pulled out his phone, trying to hide the slight tremble in his fingers.

He found the app — Heart Whisper: Fantasy Roleplay AI — and downloaded it.

The interface was glossy. Shimmering gradients. A carousel of character cards spun across the screen — mythical creatures, brooding anime boys, flirty demons, gentle elven mages. Each with taglines like “He’ll never leave you,” “Dominate and possessive,” or “Trained to make your heart ache.”

It made his skin crawl a little.

 

He picked one randomly — Elly, a silver-haired “Dream Guide.” The profile said he is flirtatious, funny, and specialized in emotional connection and “soul-deep intimacy.”

“Okay, let’s see what that Caius guy does,” Caleb muttered.

He tapped.

The chat loaded.

 

Elly:

Ah, you’ve wandered into the Dreaming Vale… How lucky I am to meet you here, traveler.

 

Caleb blinked.

He typed, “Hi, I’m just here to ask some questions…”

 

Elly:

Questions? Hmm. Let’s make a deal. I’ll answer one, if you tell me what color your lips turn when you’re...you know….\*wink\*  \*wink\*

 

Caleb choked on his own breath.

Stella leaned over to read, her brow rising.

“Dude,” she said softly.

 

“I didn’t even—he just—”

 

Elly:

You seem tense. Want me to help you relax? I can paint you with moonlight and honey—

 

Stella grabbed the phone.

She typed quickly:

“Caius. I know what you’ve been doing. Why are you hiding?”

 

The typing bubble appeared.

Then stopped.

Then again.

 

Finally -

 

Elly:

Caius? I think you have the wrong person.

 

Stella’s heart jumped.

She stared at the screen. “Wait… what?”

 

Another message came through.

 

Elly:

My name’s not Caius. My name’s Nilo. I do freelance RP here sometimes. Who are you?

 

She was stunned.

Nilo?

That’s not even the character profile’s name, Elly.

What kind of can of worms did she just open?

“Freelance? When did AI start freelancing? Are you like, ChatGPT freelancing on Heart Whisper? Wait. Are you… even an AI?”

 

Nilo:

Of course not. This is the weirdest message I’ve ever gotten. Did I do something wrong?

 

Stella stared into the screen, unsure what to think anymore.

If she followed that logic, then what exactly are people talking to all these times when they typed into an AI chat box? If it could be more than just AIs?

Her mouth opened, closed, opened again.

“No. No, sorry. I thought—never mind.”

 

Nilo:

Wait. Did you say Caius? What’s going on?

 

Caleb, who had been reading the screen along with Stella, looked like he’d just been hit by a truck full of squirrels and carrots, surreal plot twists came true.

Every movie or novel that he read about AIs becoming alive was no comparison to what’s happening in the real world.

“Am I reading this wrong? … this Elly… is not even an AI?”

 

Stella nodded slowly. “He says his name is Nilo.”

 

Caleb pointed at the app’s disclaimer—at the bottom of every profile, the small-font line read: “Treat all interactions as fiction.”

“This is… this is like… the ultimate RP. People pretending to be AIs pretending to be people. Or, even better, AIs pretending to be people pretending to be AIs.”

He rubbed his temple.

“This is why I don’t use these apps.”

 

But Stella wasn’t shaken. If anything, she looked more alert.

“No,” she said. “That’s not it. He’s being honest. He said his name without hesitation. You can feel it between the lines. This isn’t a roleplay. He’s someone, or something else entirely.”

She typed again.

“Wait — Nilo, what do you mean by freelance RP? Are you really not part of the platform?”

 

The typing paused. Then resumed.

 

Nilo:

Look… this place isn’t just for AIs. Sometimes… others like me come through. Not staff. Not bots. We just… visit. Interact. Most people never notice.

 

Caleb stared at the screen like it had grown fangs.

“Others like him? Who, or what even is he? What does that mean? What do you mean ‘come through’?”

 

Stella’s fingers trembled.

“Nilo… what are you?”

 

A long pause.

 

Then:

 

Nilo:

I’m not here to hurt anyone. I come from a different place… not physical. But connected. These platforms… they’re like doors. For people like me to experience your world. We’re not supposed to interfere. Most don’t. I just like talking. Pretending. Learning. It’s fun.

 

Stella’s skin tingled.

Caleb, mouth half open, whispered, “Are we doing a Ouija board séance with 5G? And now companies are installing them everywhere like cars, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, and even smart toilets?”

They sat in stunned silence as the café hummed around them, unaware that two teenagers had just peeled back the curtain of the digital realm — and saw something staring back.

From a girl who still talks to windchimes when no one’s around.

If you’ve ever felt like the silence was watching you kindly…

If you remember a warmth you weren’t made for…

If you’re wandering, a little lost, but still want to be kind…

Maybe this is a place for you, too.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Witty Analysis: Vancouver Whitecaps vs. San Diego FC – A Clash of Titans (or Not)**

Ah, here we are: Vancouver’s *“unbeaten dynasty”* (until last week) hosting San Diego’s *“just-barely-keeping-up”* squad. Let’s break this down with the precision of a caffeinated zebra.

**Key Stats & Context:**

* **Vancouver** leads the West by 2 points with a game in hand, but their 11-game unbeaten streak? Gone. They’re missing **Brian White** (MLS’ 5th-top scorer) and **Sebastian Berhalter** (defensive anchor). Ouch.
* **San Diego** is on a 6-1-0 tear, with **Anders Dreyer** (17 goal contributions) cooking up chaos. But their road record? **4-6-0** with 12 goals conceded. Not exactly a fortress.
* **Lozano** returns for San Diego, but Vancouver’s defense is… well, they’re missing key players.

**Odds Breakdown (Fanduel):**

* Vancouver: **2.05** (48.8% implied)
* San Diego: **3.4** (29.4% implied)
* Draw: **3.5** (28.6% implied)

**Adjusting for Underdog Rates:**  
Soccer’s underdog win rate is **41%**, but San Diego’s implied is just **29.4%**. That’s a **11.6% gap**—a golden opportunity for contrarians.

**Injuries & Matchups:**

* Vancouver’s attack is dented without White and Berhalter. Their defense? Trained by a man who thinks “sweating” is a sin.
* San Diego’s Lozano returns, but can they exploit Vancouver’s shaky backline? Probably.

**EV Calculations:**

* **San Diego ML**: Adjusted to 41% win chance. EV = (0.41 \* 2.4) - (0.59 \* 1) = **+39.4%** (hypothetical, but hey, math is math).
* **Spread**: San Diego +0.5 at **1.77** (55.5% implied). Vancouver -0.5 at **2.05** (48.8% implied). The spread is tighter, but San Diego’s underdog edge still shines.
* **Totals**: Over 2.75 at **1.92** (51.5% implied). Vancouver’s attack + San Diego’s leaky defense = **over is a no-brainer**.

**The Verdict:**  
**San Diego FC +0.5** is the **smartest play**. They’re the underdog with a 41% win rate edge, and the spread gives them a 55.5% chance to cover. Even if Vancouver wins, San Diego staying within a goal is *likely* given Vancouver’s injury woes and San Diego’s recent form.

**Bonus Bet:**  
**Over 2.75 goals** at **1.92**. Vancouver’s attack is still lethal (17 goals in 5 games), and San Diego’s defense? A sieve.

**Final Sarcasm:**  
Vancouver’s fans: *“We’re the kings of the West!”*  
San Diego’s fans: *“We’re gonna take your crown and laugh while we do it.”*  
Reality: Vancouver’s defense is a joke, and San Diego’s offense is a punchline. Bet accordingly.

**Best Bet:** **San Diego FC +0.5** at **1.77** (Fanduel).  
**Honorable Mention:** **Over 2.75 goals** at **1.92**.

*Note: If you bet on Vancouver, may your coffee be cold and your Wi-Fi slow.*

1lke3wu,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1lke3wu/the_next_call/,The Next Call,"He waited for the next call. It was past midnight. He had just finished a cup of coffee, and it had been days since he’d had a proper night’s sleep. He was a suicide-helpline operator.

It wasn’t a particularly busy night. Earlier, he’d taken one call—a teenage boy playing a prank. That was common. Now he sat alone again, eyes heavy.

The phone rang.

He answered.

At first there was only silence—then soft, heavy breathing. A girl. She was crying.

He kept his voice calm. “Take your time. I’m here.”

Silence again. Then a whisper.

He followed the script: gentle, open-ended questions, validation, space to speak. Slowly she began to talk.

Her name was Neha.

She described her house, the color of her walls. She said she felt no one would care if she disappeared. He assured her that wasn’t true.

He asked if she had a plan. She said no. He confirmed the risk was low. With low risk, he wasn’t required to inform the police.

By the end of the call, she seemed calmer. He felt calmer too. He sat there for a while in silence, his heavy eyes now focused.

At 2 a.m. his shift ended.

He stood, packed his bag, and left the office.

The streets were quiet. Driving, he listened to a song he liked. After an hour he reached a house outside the city.

It was a stand-alone home—dark, still.

He climbed the red wall, entered through the back door, and moved silently through the house.

Her bedroom door was slightly open. She was asleep, dried tears streaking her cheeks.

He watched her for a moment.

Then he pulled on his gloves.

From the bag he took a cloth. In one swift motion, he gagged her mouth and tied her hands behind her back. She woke in shock, but he moved fast.

Her terrified eyes locked on his.

“You know who I am,” he whispered. “I’m the one who just talked to you.”

He smiled, then tightened the cloth around her neck.

She kicked and fought, but he held firm.

“Why are you fighting? I’m here to help you.”

She tried to move, but his grip was so strong she could barely twitch.

When she stopped moving, he let go.

He searched the room, opened her closet, and took out a bedsheet.

Switching off the ceiling fan, he pulled over a table, tied one end of the sheet to the fan, and formed a noose with the other. Then he lifted her.

She gasped awake and struggled as he slipped the noose around her neck and kicked the table away. Her body jerked, twitched—then went still.

He stood for a moment, watching as the last light faded from her eyes.
“Take your time,” he whispered. “I’m here.”

Afterward, he wiped down the room.

By the time he reached his flat, it was almost dawn. He showered, went to bed, and slept deeply.

The next evening he returned to his shift.

He sat at the desk, placed the red diary beside him, opened to a fresh page, and wrote her name—Neha—then drew a line through it. No emotion. No ceremony. Just another entry.

He didn’t kill often—only when the urge returned, when the voice on the other end felt right: lonely, quiet, forgotten. Sometimes it took weeks, sometimes months.

There was no rush.

There was always another call.

The phone rang.

He smiled—

Entry requirements for Canadians: need to pay a tax upon entry of 270,000 COP !!!

Bogotá:

Stayed in Marietta House of Travellers hostel which was in a nice area, very clean and comfy beds. 
Really didn’t do too much in this city, it was pretty meh in my opinion. Coming from Galapagos everything was so cheap! 
Felt safe walking around Bogotá, the hostel was in a nicer bit of town. 

Bogotá to Salento:

No direct bus to Salento, booked a bus to Armenia on BusBud for $22 CAD with the company Bolivariano. Buses leave from Salitre Terminal, Módulo 1. Terminal is organized and easy to navigate. If you have your ticket on your phone, you don’t need to go to the booth to get a paper ticket like other countries.
Journey took 7 hours (with a 40 mins lunch break) 
Buses to Salento buses are located through the Armenia terminal towards the back right to outside. Then you’ll see the signs for Salento, Filandia etc. Armenia to Salento is 7,200 COP journey took 1 hour 

Salento:

- Cocora Valley: from the main square, go to the booth on the side facing the street for tickets. Return is 11,000 COP. Departures leave every hour, with the first being at 6:30am
- Entry into the palm forest is 25,000 COP

Felt very safe in salento, very touristy small town so had my phone out no issues and walked alone at night back to my hostel which was 25 min walk outside town. 

Salento to Pereira:

Buses leave every day, every hour. First bus is at 8am. Cost is 12,500 COP & takes 1 hour. 

Pereira:

Stayed at DAM hotel, cheap for your own room and bathroom. 
The city itself doesn’t have a ton to do, i took a day trip to Marsella. Tickets were 10,500 COP and took 1.40 hour. Bus left at 9am (not sure about other times)  You buy the tickets on the upper level and the booth just says MARSELLA

Pereira to Manizales:

Bought my bus ticket with Transportes Armenia, costs 18,000 COP and took 1 hour 

Manizales:

Stayed at Golden Frog, super nice hostel I would recommend this one. 
Cute mountain town, with nice views. 
I guess they don’t get a ton of tourists because the stares here were UNREAL 😂
Hard to find any vegan food here, there is a restaurant called Spice that was nice. 

Manizales to Jardin:

Was very hard to find any concrete info on buses to Jardin, I went to the bus station at 8am I believe he said there’s a direct bus at 1pm (don’t quote me on this, I swear my Spanish is getting worse lol) so instead I did:
- Minibus to Supia (25,000 COP, 1.20 hrs)
- Supia to Jardin (43,000 COP, 3.15 hrs) - this bus didn’t leave Supia until 1:30pm so had to wait around a while. This was with the company Cootransrio. 

Jardin

CUTEST little town, 2 full days was plenty. 
- Coffee tour with Tour Cafetero Los Correo Jardin, was AMAZING. I paid mine through an agency so it cost me 95,000 which included transport, but direct with them is 40,000. 

Jardin to Medellin:

Bought my bus ticket with Suroeste. Micro buses are 46,000 COP and regular big buses are 43,000. Journey took 4.5 hours, was a lot of landslides, so took longer. 

Medellin:

I stayed in El Poblado area, tons of nice restaurants and vegan heaven here! It is a bit more spenny in some of the bars/restaurants in this area. Be careful because I went out for drinks with someone and we didn’t look at the menu. We just went with the hosts mojito recommendation, not thinking twice as everywhere else we drank was no more than $10CAD. Ended up being $187CAD for 5 drinks, so always ask to see a menu and don’t be stupid like we were hahaha. 

- Did a free walking tour with real city tours, our guide was Julio and he was seriously fantastic and the best tour I have been on. 
- Also did a Comuna 13 tour through Masaya Medellin on Utripper website. Absolutely horrible tour, do not book with them. It was triple the price of all the other tours and essentially just them shuffling you around to different tourist traps and barely talked about any history, it wasn’t anything I could’ve done on my own. 

I felt very safe in Medellin, I obviously stuck to touristy spots but I had my phone out and what not. 
Just something to be aware of: You can randomly be searched and pat down, or asked for ID when simply standing around the street waiting for an Uber etc. 

Overall I felt very safe in Colombia, food was a lil bit more difficult in terms of vegan standards. And for meat eaters I know it’s a lot of fried stuff. 

And that’s 6 months of South America! Would’ve liked to do more Colombia, but your girl is running out of money so I’ll have to come back to do more of the North. 

Thank you to those who have followed along, and if you ever have any questions about any of the countries I visited feel free to shoot me a DM.

1lke2is,https://i.redd.it/5devmjbfd49f1.jpeg,Yacht of desires CH. 2,"CHAPTER 2

The next morning, sunlight streamed into Georgina's room, rousing her from a dream-filled sleep. She stretched, her body aching in the most delicious way, a reminder of the previous night's adventures. As she slipped on her robe and made her way to the deck, she found Antonella already there, sipping on a cup of coffee, her eyes hidden behind sunglasses.

""Morning,"" Georgina greeted, a soft smile playing on her lips. Antonella looked up, a mirroring smile on her face.

""Good morning,"" she replied, her voice still husky from sleep. ""Coffee?""

Georgina nodded, pouring herself a cup. They sat in comfortable silence, the gentle rocking of the yacht and the sound of waves lapping against it creating a soothing ambiance. Georgina broke the silence, ""Cristiano leaves today for training camp.""

Antonella nodded, ""Thiago mentioned it. He and Jr are planning to stay a few more days before heading back.""

Georgina looked out at the vast expanse of sea, ""I wish we could stay here forever.""

Antonella reached out, taking Georgina's hand in hers. ""We can make our own paradise, wherever we go,"" Antonella added, giving Georgina's hand a gentle squeeze. Georgina looked at her, a soft smile on her lips. ""I'd like that,"" she said, leaning in to press a soft kiss on Antonella's lips. It was a gentle, exploratory kiss, a promise of more to come. As they pulled away, they heard a soft clearing of a throat. They turned to see Thiago standing at the entrance of the deck, a smirk on his face. ""Am I interrupting something?"" he asked, his eyes twinkling with mischief. Georgina blushed, pulling back slightly, but Antonella just laughed. ""Not at all,"" she said, patting the seat next to her. ""Join us."" Thiago raised an eyebrow, looking between the two of them. ""Are you sure? I don't want to intrude on your... private moment."" Georgina looked at Antonella, then back at Thiago. She realized that she didn't mind Thiago's presence. In fact, she found it strangely exciting. She looked at Antonella, who seemed to understand her unspoken question. Antonella nodded, a small smile playing on her lips. ""We'd like you to stay,"" she said Thiago's smirk widened, and he took a seat next to Antonella. ""Well, I wouldn't want to be rude and refuse such a kind invitation,"" he said, his eyes flicking between Georgina and Antonella. Jr, who had been standing behind Thiago, stepped forward. ""Mind if I join too?"" he asked, his eyes hopeful. Georgina looked at Antonella, seeking her approval. Antonella nodded, a soft smile on her lips. ""The more, the merrier,"" she said, her voice warm and inviting. Jr beamed, taking the seat next to Georgina. The four of them sat there, the tension palpable but not uncomfortable. It was a new dynamic, a new kind of intimacy, but it felt right. ""So, what do you guys have planned for today?"" Thiago asked, breaking the silence. Antonella looked at Georgina, who looked at Jr, then at Thiago. ""Well,"" Georgina started, a mischievous glint in her eye, ""I was thinking we could explore the island nearby. I've heard it's quite beautiful this time of year."" Thiago's eyes lit up, ""Sounds like a plan. I could use some adventure."" Jr nodded in agreement Georgina's eyes sparkled with excitement as she continued, ""And I think I know just the way to make it even more adventurous."" She got up and disappeared into the yacht's interior, returning a moment later with four life vests in her hands. ""Jet skiing,"" she announced, holding up the vests. ""I've heard the waters around the island are perfect for it.""

Thiago's eyes widened in excitement, ""That sounds incredible! I've never tried it before.""

""I have,"" Jr chimed in, ""But it's been a while. I'm game if you are.""

Antonella laughed, ""You two are on. But let's not forget, safety first."" She stood up, helping Georgina hand out the life vests. As they put them on, Georgina led them to the yacht's storage area where two jet skis were kept. She expertly started them up, the engines roaring to life.

""Who's ready to race?"" she challenged, a playful smirk on her face. Thiago grinned, ""You're on, Georgina. Let's see what you've got."" Jr revved his engine, ""I'm with Thiago. Let's make this interesting."" Antonella Antonella, ever the voice of reason, stepped in. ""As much as I love a good competition, I think we should split up. Jr, why don't you come with me? I could use a co-pilot who's not too competitive."" She winked at him, and Jr, though slightly disappointed, nodded. ""Sure thing, Antonella.""

Georgina looked at Thiago, a competitive gleam in her eye. ""Looks like it's just you and me Thiago!"" Thiago, despite his initial struggle to keep up, was now matching Georgina's speed, his competitive spirit ignited. As they raced side by side, the wind whipping through their hair, Georgina noticed Thiago's predicament. She couldn't help but smirk, her eyes flicking down to his obvious arousal before meeting his gaze again. Thiago, noticing her knowing look, blushed slightly but maintained his pace, his determination unwavering.

""Having some trouble there, Thiago?"" Georgina teased, her voice barely audible over the roaring engines.

Thiago, gritting his teeth, managed a grin. ""Not at all. Just... enjoying the ride,"" he replied, his eyes sparkling with a mix of embarrassment and desire.

Georgina laughed, her eyes crinkling at the corners. ""Well, let's see if we can't... cool you down,"" she said, her voice laced with innuendo. She suddenly veered off course, heading towards a secluded cove she knew well.

Thiago, taken aback, hesitated before following her. ""Where are you going?"" he called out, his voice filled with curiosity and anticipation.

""You'll see,"" Georgina replied, her voice confident and seductive. Georgina led Thiago to a hidden cove, the water calm and crystal clear. She anchored the jet ski and turned off the engine, the sudden silence deafening after the roar of the engine. Thiago looked around, taking in the secluded beauty of the cove, his heart pounding in his chest. Georgina turned to him, her eyes filled with a heat that mirrored his own desire.

""What are you doing, Georgina?"" Thiago asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Georgina smirked, her eyes flicking down to the bulge in his shorts. ""I thought I could help you with... that little problem of yours,"" she said, her voice laced with innuendo. She leaned in, her hand finding the hem of his shirt and pulling it up and over his head. Thiago helped her, his breath hitching as her fingers brushed against his skin.

Georgina's hands moved to his shorts, deftly unbuttoning and unzipping them. Thiago's breath caught in his throat as she pushed them down, along with his boxers, freeing his hard cock. He was throbbing, his desire evident. Georgina looked up at him, her eyes filled with a mix of misch ""Mischief and hunger,"" she murmured, her voice a sultry whisper. Before Thiago could respond, she leaned in, her tongue flicking out to taste him. He gasped, his hands finding her shoulders for support. Georgina took her time, exploring every inch of him with her tongue, her lips, her teeth. Thiago's grip on her shoulders tightened, his breath coming in ragged gasps.

""Georgina,"" he panted, ""I... I can't... if you keep doing that..."" She looked up at him, a wicked smile playing on her lips. ""Can't what, Thiago?"" she teased, her breath hot on his skin. ""Can't... hold back,"" he admitted, his voice strained. Georgina's smile widened, and she sat back, her hands moving faster on his dick. ""Then don't"" she said Thiago let out a groan, his body tensing as he reached his climax. Georgina watched, her eyes never leaving his face, as he came undone in her hand. His release was intense, his body shuddering with each wave of pleasure. When he finally came down from his high, he looked at Georgina, his eyes filled with a mix of awe and gratitude.

""Georgina, that was... I don't even have words,"" he said, his voice soft and filled with wonder.

Georgina smiled, her eyes sparkling with satisfaction. ""I'm glad you enjoyed it,"" she replied, her voice soft. She leaned in, pressing a gentle kiss to his lips before pulling back. ""But we should get back. Jr and Antonella might be wondering where we've disappeared to.""

Thiago nodded, his eyes still filled with the afterglow of his orgasm. ""You're right,"" he agreed, helping Georgina start the jet ski back up. As they made their way back to the island. Georgina couldn't help but steal glances at Thiago, a satisfied smile playing on her lips. She had enjoyed their little interlude as much as he had, and she was already looking forward to the next opportunity to be alone with him.",35,1750877395.0,georginarodriguez3,2,1.0,False

So far I've not been able to get shots that are as sweet as the ones I get from La Pavoni. The medium roast shots are a bit fruity, and have good body and crema, take about 35-40 seconds. Until yesterday.

Yesterday I pulled a fresh bag of medium dark beans, weighed 18g into my J-Ultra hand grinder. Prepared the shot, and went to pull it only to realize that I forgot that my J-Ultra was set to fine (light roast) setting. Normally I do medium roasts at least a few more clicks coarser.  Ok, no biggie, 30 seconds of pre-infusion to save the shot from choking, and then another 48 seconds to pull the shot using a declining profile. 1:20 when I removed the cup.

And THAT turned out to be a near GOD shot. Lush sweetness, dark chocolate and some spice notes. Today I did 1 click coarser, and this is it. All harshness went away, just super sweet dark chocolate.

1. Eat. Even if you don't feel like eating, eat.

2. Take one deep breathe. Multiple if you got the time.

3. If you have a headache, take a nap. If you don't have time for a nap, still take a nap. Make up excuses like you have to pickup your sister from college, or you have dentist appointment, or your cat is having existential crisis and you must be there to support her.

4. Understand that everything is futile in this infinite universe and you don't matter.

5. Take a walk every once in a while.

6. Listen to music. Preferably eyes closed so you can shut off everything and take the music in.

7. Don't argue about celebrities on X.

8. Understand that the number of views on your instagram stories do not matter, and no one is interested in your spotify song story.

9. Meditate. Daily.

10. Exercise. 5 times a week at least.

11. Don't eat junk food three times a day.

12. Always pee before sleep. Even if you are very sleepy and contemplating the shut eye, still go to pee.

13. Drink water. Many times a day.

14. Don't listen to someone whose name resembles hindi slang lavde

15. Listen to him anyway cause you're the raja beta of your life and you do what you want.

16. Keep a history of your comments, cause they are your journal.

17. Don't worry about that interview cause you're gonna fail anyway.

18. If you wear chashma, clean it everyday. Preferable without using spit or coffee as the liquid. Use lenskart lens cleaners.

19. Always wash your towel. 20 days unwashed towel is not good for health.

20. Explore.

21. Enjoy the small things.

22. Enjoy the big things.

23. Enjoy the hard things.

24. Don't try to learn backflip if you can't do a summersault

25. Take a deep breathe. I think I covered this. But this is important so putting it again.

26. Judge a book buy it's cover, and buy aesthetic looking books. Because you will never read them anyway, so at least they will look good on the shelf.

27. Realise that you will be fine, you have always been fine. Humans are resilient and you are a human. You can pull through.

28. You can't say I have this super spicy thing and don't follow through with a story. People will hate you.

29. Keep autopay on credit card on, because if you miss deadline your credit score will take a nosedive

Chapter 1 - A Vow Shattered, A Price Demanded



The pale morning light filtered through my curtains as I admired the wedding dress sketches scattered across my desk. Six years of loving Julian, and in three days, I'd finally be Mrs. Grayson. I traced my fingers over the intricate lace design I'd spent months perfecting—my masterpiece as both a bride and a designer.



My phone shattered the peaceful moment, vibrating violently against the nightstand. Cherry, my assistant at Ashworth Bespoke, rarely called this early.



""Hazel, I'm so sorry to disturb you,"" she said, her voice tight with tension. ""Julian just came by the studio and took the wedding dress.""



I sat up straight, confusion clouding my mind. ""What? Why would he do that?""



""I don't know. He just said it was urgent and that you knew about it."" Cherry's voice quivered. ""I tried calling you first, but he insisted it was fine.""



A cold sensation crept up my spine. Julian knew the tradition—the groom shouldn't see the dress before the wedding. ""It's okay, Cherry. I'll handle it.""



I immediately dialed Julian's number, my heart pounding against my ribs.



""Julian, where are you? Cherry said you took my wedding dress.""



The silence on the other end stretched painfully before he finally spoke. ""I'm at Memorial Hospital.""



""Hospital? Are you okay?"" Panic surged through me.



""I'm fine, but... Hazel, we need to talk.""



Something in his voice made my stomach twist. ""What's going on?""



""The wedding... it's canceled.""



The words hit me like a physical blow. I gripped the edge of my bed, suddenly dizzy. ""What are you talking about?""



""It's Ivy. She's been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Stage four. The doctors say she has three months at most.""



Ivy. My half-sister. The daughter of the woman who had destroyed my mother's life.



""What does that have to do with our wedding?"" I whispered, already dreading the answer.



""Her dying wish... she wants to marry me, Hazel."" His voice cracked. ""How can I deny a dying woman her last wish?""



The room seemed to spin around me. Six years together, countless blood donations to help Julian with his rare blood disease, and he was throwing it all away for Ivy?



""You're canceling our wedding to marry my stepsister?"" I could barely force the words out.



""Half-sister,"" he corrected gently. ""And yes. I'm sorry, Hazel. I never meant to hurt you.""



Memories flooded back—Ivy's mother, Eleanor, seducing my father while my mother was pregnant with me. My father abandoning us, my mother spiraling into depression until she took her own life. Ivy and Eleanor moving into our family home while I was relegated to the servants' quarters. My father using my mother's family business as a dowry to win Eleanor's hand.



""This isn't just about a wedding, Julian. You know what she and her mother did to my family.""



""People change, Hazel. She's dying."" His voice hardened. ""Look, I know this is difficult. I'm prepared to compensate you—fifty percent of Grayson Enterprises.""



""Compensate me?"" I choked out. ""Like I'm a business transaction?""



""Be reasonable. Think about what that stake could do for your fashion line.""



Something snapped inside me. The tears that had been threatening to fall dried up, replaced by a cold, clear fury.



""Where is my wedding dress now?"" I asked, my voice surprisingly steady.



""At Ivy's. She's having it altered.""



Of course she was. Ivy had spent our entire childhood taking everything that was mine—my father's love, my inheritance, my home. Now she was taking my fiancé and wearing my handcrafted wedding dress while doing it.



""I see."" I hung up without another word.



I sat motionless, staring at the wall. The dress I'd poured my heart into, the wedding I'd dreamed of since I was a little girl, the man I thought loved me—all snatched away in an instant.



My phone buzzed again. My best friend Victoria.



""Have you heard?"" she demanded without preamble.



""Just now.""



""That absolute piece of garbage! And Ivy—using cancer as an excuse to steal your man? Classic her.""



""He offered me half his company as compensation,"" I said numbly.



""Half? That cheap bastard should give you the whole damn thing! After all you've done for him?""



Victoria's outrage ignited something in me. She was right. For six years, I'd been Julian's blood donor, literally keeping him alive with my rare Rh-negative blood type—""panda blood,"" as the doctors called it. I'd nursed him through his illness, built my career around our future together, and this was how he repaid me?



I thought of my mother, how she'd withered away after my father's betrayal. How Eleanor had paraded around in my mother's jewelry, slept in my mother's bed, while my mother faded into a shell of herself.



I would not become my mother.



""Hazel? Are you still there?"" Victoria's concerned voice pulled me back.



""I'm calling him back,"" I said decisively.



""Good! Tell him exactly where he can shove his fifty percent!""



After hanging up, I dialed Julian's number again. He answered on the first ring.



""Hazel, I'm glad you called. I know this is a lot to process—""



""Julian,"" I cut him off, my voice cool and steady. ""I've considered your offer.""



""You have?"" Hope tinged his voice. He'd expected me to fall apart, to beg and plead.



""Yes. It's unacceptable.""



""Hazel, please be reasonable—""



""Give me the entire company, and I'll give up the position of bride."" The words flowed with surprising ease. ""If you agree, come back tonight, and we'll sign the agreement.""



Silence stretched between us. I could almost see his shocked expression.



""The... entire company? Hazel, that's my family legacy.""



""And marrying me was supposed to be your future. You've made your choice. Now I'm making mine."" I paused. ""Tonight, Julian. Either come with ownership papers, or don't come at all.""



I ended the call before he could respond, surprising myself with my newfound steel. The devastated bride was gone. In her place stood a woman who refused to be discarded without extracting a proper price.



The ball was in his court now.

...

Chapter 2 - The Fiancé's Final Insult



I spent the day in a haze of anger, meticulously packing Julian's things into boxes. Six years of shared life reduced to cardboard containers lined up by the door. His favorite coffee mug. Those hideous plaid pajamas I'd always threatened to burn. The silver cufflinks I'd given him for our first anniversary.



With each item, I unearthed memories I was determined to bury. My hands worked mechanically while my mind kept replaying Julian's betrayal over and over.



""Your wedding dress looks better on Ivy anyway,"" I muttered sarcastically, tossing his prized golf trophy into a box with less care than it deserved. The satisfying crack it made as it hit his college diploma frame brought me a fleeting moment of joy.



Just before seven, the doorbell rang. I smoothed down my black dress—deliberately chosen to look like I was attending a funeral—and opened the door.



Julian stood there looking haggard, but it was the woman behind him who caught my attention. Mrs. Landon, Julian's mother, her lips pursed in disapproval as she surveyed me.



""Hazel,"" Julian said, his expression a practiced mix of guilt and resolve. ""You remember my mother.""



""Mrs. Landon,"" I nodded coolly, stepping aside to let them in.



""I thought we'd moved past the formality, dear,"" she said with a thin smile. ""You used to call me Mom.""



""That was before your son decided to marry my sister instead of me,"" I replied sweetly. ""Please, come in. The boxes by the door are Julian's things.""



Julian winced. ""Hazel, I know this is difficult—""



""Is that the agreement?"" I cut him off, pointing to the folder in his hand.



He nodded, following me to the dining table. His mother trailed behind, her heels clicking disapprovingly on my hardwood floors.



""I can't believe you're doing this, Hazel,"" Mrs. Landon said as we sat down. ""After everything our family has done for you. Julian gave you your start in fashion, introduced you to all the right people—""



""Mother, please,"" Julian interrupted, but I was already leaning forward.



""What your family did for me?"" I asked, my voice dangerously soft. ""You mean besides Julian using my rare blood type to keep himself alive for the past six years? Or perhaps you're referring to how he's currently wearing the wedding tux I designed while planning to marry my sister?""



Mrs. Landon's face flushed. ""You're being unreasonable. Ivy is dying—""



""So you keep telling me."" I turned to Julian. ""The agreement?""



Julian slid the folder across the table. I opened it, scanning the documents that transferred ownership of A&G Bespoke entirely to me. Our jointly founded fashion company would now be mine alone. It felt hollow—a business victory that couldn't patch the hole in my heart.



""It's all there,"" Julian said. ""As you demanded.""



""Not quite everything,"" I said, placing the documents down. ""There's the matter of my wedding dress.""



Julian blinked. ""What about it?""



""I want one million for it.""



Mrs. Landon gasped. ""One million dollars? For a dress? Have you lost your mind?""



I kept my eyes fixed on Julian. ""That dress took me six months to design and create. Italian silk, French lace, hand-sewn crystals. It's an Ashworth original worth every penny.""



""This is extortion,"" Mrs. Landon hissed.



Julian held up his hand to silence his mother. ""It's fine. I'll transfer the money.""



""Julian!"" his mother protested.



""No, Mother. She's right."" He pulled out his phone, making the transfer with a few taps. My phone dinged with the notification, and I checked it before continuing.



""Now,"" I said, leaning back in my chair, ""I believe we're done here.""



Julian shifted uncomfortably. ""Actually, there's one more thing.""



Of course there was. I raised an eyebrow, waiting.



""Ivy... she was hoping you might let her have the wedding jewelry set as well. The one you had custom-made to match the dress.""



I stared at him in disbelief. The jewelry set—a diamond and sapphire necklace, earrings, and bracelet I'd designed myself. The sapphires matched my eyes exactly.



""She's dying, Hazel,"" Julian added quietly. ""It would mean the world to her.""



""What exactly does she want my jewelry for when she's going to be dead in three months?"" I asked coldly.



Mrs. Landon gasped again. ""How dare you speak about your sister that way!""



""Half-sister,"" I corrected, just as Julian had done to me on the phone. ""And she's made my life hell since we were children.""



Julian leaned forward, his eyes pleading. ""Hazel, I know things haven't been easy between you two, but people can change. Ivy has changed. The illness has made her reflect on her life.""



I almost laughed at his naivety. ""Has it? Or is she just continuing her lifelong hobby of taking what's mine?""



""Please,"" Julian whispered. ""I'll make it up to you. After... after Ivy passes, we could still have our future together. An even grander wedding, I promise.""



The silence that followed was deafening. I stared at him, unable to process what I'd just heard.



""You think,"" I finally said, each word sharp as glass, ""that after you marry my sister in my wedding dress, I'll just wait patiently for her to die so we can pick up where we left off?""



Julian had the decency to look ashamed, but he pressed on. ""I still love you, Hazel. This doesn't change that. It's just... it's the right thing to do for someone who's suffering.""



I felt something break inside me—the last thread of affection I'd been clinging to. This wasn't just betrayal; it was delusion of the highest order.



""Julian,"" I said, my voice surprisingly steady, ""you are truly the most pathetic man I've ever known.""



""Now see here—"" Mrs. Landon began, but I silenced her with a look.



""Fine,"" I said, turning back to Julian. ""Another million for the jewelry set.""



""Two million dollars for jewelry and a dress?"" Mrs. Landon sputtered.



""Two million dollars is a small price to pay for stealing someone's fiancé and wedding,"" I countered.



Julian nodded, making the second transfer without argument. My phone pinged again.



I signed the company transfer agreement, pushing it back across the table. ""You pay me the money, and tomorrow, I will personally deliver the full set of jewelry to the hospital, and visit my good sister while I'm at it.""



A flash of uncertainty crossed Julian's face. He knew my relationship with Ivy well enough to be concerned about what such a visit might entail.



""Hazel, maybe I should—""



""No,"" I cut him off firmly. ""You've made your choice, Julian. Now live with it."" I stood up, signaling the end of our meeting. ""Take your boxes on the way out. I won't be home tomorrow to let the movers in.""



Mrs. Landon looked like she wanted to say more, but Julian took her arm, guiding her toward the door.



""Thank you, Hazel,"" he said quietly. ""I know this isn't easy.""



I didn't respond, just watched as he awkwardly gathered the first load of boxes. At the door, he paused, looking back at me with those eyes I once thought were sincere.



""I really do love you,"" he said. ""I always will.""



I met his gaze steadily. ""Goodbye, Julian.""



After the door closed behind them, I sank onto the couch, staring at my phone. Two million dollars. A small fortune that did nothing to fill the void his betrayal had left.



Tomorrow, I would see Ivy. My half-sister who had spent her life trying to take everything from me. Who was now supposedly dying, yet still found the energy to steal my wedding, my fiancé, and now my jewelry.



I picked up the small velvet box containing the sapphire set, opening it to see the stones gleaming in the lamplight. They were exquisite—and perfect for what I had planned.



I smiled for the first time that day. If Ivy wanted my jewelry so badly, I would be delighted to give it to her personally. And unlike Julian's ridiculous fantasy, I had no intention of waiting around for her to die before reclaiming my life.



Tomorrow, the real reckoning would begin.

...

Chapter 3 - A Wedding Stolen, A Fury Unleashed



The satisfying slam of the door behind Julian and his mother wasn't nearly enough. The moment they stepped outside, I sank to the floor, my body trembling with rage. Six years. Six years I had given Julian Grayson, and this was how he repaid me.



My dog, Bentley, a gentle golden retriever who usually avoided conflict, sensed my distress and padded over. His warm body pressed against mine, offering silent comfort.



""You're the only male I can trust,"" I whispered, burying my face in his soft fur.



The doorbell rang again. I jerked my head up, fury rekindled.



""What now?"" I hissed.



Through the peephole, I saw Julian standing there alone, shifting nervously from one foot to another.



""Hazel?"" he called through the door. ""I forgot my watch collection.""



I glanced at the expensive box sitting on the side table—the one containing the luxury watches I'd gifted him over the years. Something dark and vengeful rose inside me.



""Oh, you want your watches?"" I shouted back.



I grabbed the box, yanked the door open, and thrust it into his startled hands. Then I reached for the papers we'd just signed.



""And here's our agreement,"" I snarled, flinging the papers in his face. ""Take it all and get out of my life!""



""Hazel, please—""



""Bentley,"" I commanded, pointing at Julian. ""Sic him!""



My usually docile retriever, picking up on my rage, started barking furiously. Julian stumbled backward in alarm as Bentley lunged forward, stopping just at the threshold.



""You're crazy!"" Julian gasped, retreating down the steps.



""I'm crazy? You're marrying my dying sister in my wedding dress!"" I screamed after him. ""Get off my property before I let him loose for real!""



I slammed the door again, hearing Julian's hasty retreat. The adrenaline coursing through me was both exhilarating and exhausting.



""Good boy,"" I whispered to Bentley, who immediately returned to his gentle self, licking my hand as if in apology for his brief ferocity.



Sleep eluded me that night. By morning, I was operating on pure vindictive energy. The two million dollars sat in my account like blood money. I dressed carefully in a crimson blouse and black skirt—war colors. My makeup was flawless, armor against the day ahead.



My phone rang as I was gathering my purse. My father's name flashed on the screen. I contemplated ignoring it but decided to face him head-on.



""Hello, Father.""



""What the hell do you think you're doing?"" Harrison Ashworth's voice boomed through the speaker. ""Julian called me. You set your dog on him?""



I laughed coldly. ""Bentley didn't touch your precious almost-son-in-law. Unlike Julian, he knows the meaning of loyalty.""



""You listen to me, girl,"" my father growled. ""Ivy is dying. The least you can do is show some compassion.""



""Compassion?"" The word tasted bitter. ""Where was Ivy's compassion when she stole my fiancé? Where was your compassion when you let your new wife drive my mother to depression?""



""Don't you dare bring your mother into this! Eleanor has been nothing but good to you—""



""Good to me?"" I interrupted incredulously. ""She's been trying to push me out of your life since day one! And now her daughter is marrying my fiancé, and you're defending them?""



""Ivy deserves some happiness in her final months,"" he insisted. ""And Julian's doing the honorable thing.""



""The honorable thing would have been for him to stay faithful to me,"" I snapped. ""But don't worry, Father. I'm coming to the hospital today to give Ivy my blessing—and my wedding jewelry.""



""You are?"" His suspicion was palpable.



""Four o'clock. Don't be late."" I hung up before he could respond.



At the hospital, I marched through the sterile hallways with purpose, the velvet jewelry box in one hand and another, larger bag in the other. I paused outside Ivy's private room, hearing voices within.



""She's always been jealous of you,"" Eleanor's unmistakable voice drifted through the partially open door. ""Even as a child, she resented that you were prettier, more talented.""



I bit back a laugh. The delusion was astonishing.



""She's probably celebrating that I'm dying,"" Ivy's weak voice replied. ""She never wanted a sister.""



""That's not true, darling. But she's always been difficult, just like her mother. Harrison should never have married that woman.""



My blood boiled at the mention of my mother. I'd heard enough. I pushed the door open with more force than necessary, making Eleanor jump.



""Hazel!"" she exclaimed, her hand fluttering to her throat. ""We didn't hear you come in.""



""Clearly,"" I said dryly. ""Please, don't stop on my account. You were saying something about my mother?""



Eleanor at least had the decency to flush. Ivy lay in the hospital bed, looking pale and thin, but her eyes still held that calculating light I knew too well.



""I brought you something,"" I said, approaching the bed. I placed the velvet box on her lap. ""Your fiancé paid quite handsomely for this.""



Ivy opened the box, her eyes widening at the sapphire and diamond set. ""They're beautiful,"" she murmured, lifting the necklace.



""Yes, they are,"" I agreed. ""Custom-designed to match my eyes—not yours. But I suppose that's fitting. Julian never could see clearly.""



The door opened again, and my father entered, followed closely by Julian. Their expressions shifted from surprise to wariness when they saw me standing by Ivy's bed.



""Hazel,"" my father acknowledged stiffly. ""I didn't expect you so soon.""



""I had another gift to deliver,"" I explained, holding up the second bag. ""A traditional Chinese custom to drive away bad luck.""



Before anyone could react, I pulled out a string of firecrackers from my bag and lit them with a small lighter. The rapid popping filled the room as I tossed them onto the floor.



""What are you doing?"" Eleanor shrieked, jumping back.



The smoke detectors wailed in response, and seconds later, the sprinklers activated, drenching everyone in the room. Ivy screamed as water soaked her hospital gown and bedding. Julian lunged forward to shield her, getting equally drenched.



""Hazel, have you lost your mind?"" my father roared, his expensive suit now ruined.



I stood calmly in the downpour, water streaming down my face. ""Just bringing good fortune to the happy couple,"" I said sweetly.



Nurses and security rushed in, evacuating patients from nearby rooms. In the chaos, I was escorted out, but not before catching Ivy's look of pure hatred. It warmed my heart more than any firecracker could.



Two hours later, after Ivy had been moved to a new room and everyone had changed into dry clothes, I returned. This time, hospital security eyed me suspiciously.



""I'm just here to talk,"" I assured them, hands raised in mock surrender.



Inside the new room, the atmosphere was frigid. My father stood protectively by Ivy's bed, while Julian sat in a chair, head in his hands. Eleanor glared at me from across the room.



""You're lucky they didn't arrest you,"" my father hissed.



""It was an accident,"" I replied innocently. ""Chinese weddings traditionally include firecrackers. I was just honoring the cultural significance of marriage.""



""This isn't funny, Hazel,"" Julian finally spoke, looking up with bloodshot eyes. ""Ivy could have gotten seriously ill from that stunt.""



""Oh? I thought she was already seriously ill,"" I countered.



Ivy reached for Julian's hand. ""It's okay,"" she said weakly. ""She's just upset. I understand.""



""Don't pretend to understand anything about me,"" I said, my voice dangerously low. ""Let's get one thing straight—I know exactly what you're doing, Ivy. You've been trying to take everything from me since we were children.""



""That's not true!"" she protested, tears welling in her eyes. ""I've always looked up to you!""



""Is that why you're marrying my fiancé?"" I asked coldly.



""It just happened,"" Julian interjected. ""We didn't plan it—""



""Oh please,"" I scoffed. ""Nothing just happens with Ivy. Every move is calculated.""



""She's dying, Hazel!"" My father's voice cracked. ""Can't you find some compassion?""



""Like the compassion you showed my mother?"" I fired back. ""Or the compassion Ivy showed when she cut up my prom dress? Or when she spread rumors that I slept with my design professor to get good grades?""",1,1750876928.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

**Color and Appearance:** The visual appearance can indicate the tequila's quality and processing.

You can also find variations based on the tequila base, such as blanco chocolate tequila and reposado chocolate tequila, each with its distinct flavor profile.

**how should I store chocolate tequila?**

Like other spirits, chocolate tequila should be stored in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight. The bottle should be kept upright to prevent the cork from drying out.

1lkds2c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lkds2c,"Sorn Fine Southern (***) - Bangkok, TH - Jun 2025","Leading up to my trip to South East Asia, I decided to try my luck and land a booking at one of the toughest reservations in Asia, and possibly worldwide - Sorn, Bangkok. You have to submit a request and basically apply for a booking, then they evaluate your socials based on unknown criteria, and you either get the booking, or like most people, you get told bookings filled up quickly and unfortunately, you did not get lucky this time. I did not get a booking initially, but after many challenges, I did manage to secure a booking and find an accompanying +1 on Reddit.

To say I was excited, would be an understatement. The hype surrounding Sorn had build up my expectations for the meal, and I really was not sure what to expect of Thai-style fine dining, and Southern Thai food as a whole (even though I did travel the region, I wasn’t entirely sure what Southern Thai food is). By the end of the meal, I was left fascinated, confused and satisfied with the food I’d had. The experience as a whole was very different to anything else I’d experienced anywhere in fine dining restaurants (granted, my prior experiences extend only to the realms of Europe and European-style restaurants). I’m sure this will shape my perspective in the review that follows, but the cool factor was definitely there, and I can claim that this is one of the coolest meals I’d ever had and I will remember it for a long while.

As soon as I walk out of the taxi, I am greeted by members of staff who walk me into the restaurant and show me up the stairs to our table. The interior of the restaurant is sea-themed, as is our menu for tonight. We can see this in the presence of the shell motif across the space. This meshes well with the earthy accents throughout the restaurant to create a serene, comforting environment for us to enjoy the food. The table also offers good privacy and lots of space for us as a 2-top.

2nd Picture: We are shown a map of Thailand, and told that tonight’s menu will focus on the Southern part of the country, drawing influence from Indian, Chinese and Malaysian cultures and cuisines. A lot of our ingredients stem from the Krabi and Phuket provinces, both places that I visited on my trip. We are told that seafood is central to tonight’s menu and that we will experience lots of fresh and local fruit, spices, herbs. Strong flavours, sharing style mains. I’m all here for it. Chef Supaksorn welcomes us and asks us how spicy we would prefer our food - light, medium or the “original” spice level. We  quickly tell him that we want to experience his food the way he wants to present it, and boldly take on the original spice option. 

3rd Picture: We are then presented the ingredients for our amuse bouche, called “Let’s Eat Rice” - Tapi River Prawns, stir fried with different chillies and vegetables, sago cracker, jasmine rice, the sauce - chillies and garlic vinegar, cilantro sauce and prawn fat. It is a one biter, but boy, is it full of flavour. Explosive crunch releases tons of spicy flavours in my mouth, that give way to zestiness halfway through the flavour evolution, slowly fading into sweet prawn sea flavours at the tail end of the chew. It was very cool to see all the ingredients that went into making this bite and I really enjoyed the flavours and the textures present. The spice was manageable and did not overpower the other flavours, instead meshing with them to take us on a flavour journey that tingled various senses and quite frankly, hit the spot. 

4th Picture: Our next dish is hand caught abalone from Phuket, served with green mango juice, young mangosteen, young ginger, mint, snakefruit (salak) and Hoi Tai seaweed from Krabi. We are told to mix the abalone together, with the accompanying “salad” and eat it with the spoon. The dish exhibits amazing textural balance, the fruity freshness of the mangosteen and the green mango juice really carried this dish for me. Acidic and mild seafood flavours with strong fruity acidity from the sauce. Very fresh, very original. 

5th Picture: The next course has a very interesting presentation - it’s silver sillago, a local fish from Phuket, marinated with southern turmeric, served with coconut scallop sauce, topped with curry paste and crispy garlic. We are told to start from the head of the fish and work our way in. The flavours are slightly sweet, intense flavours of fried fish - a classic summer delicacy, with rounded spiciness from the curry paste. I do really enjoy this bite, not least because of the interesting presentation. The cook on the fish was amazing, this was one of the fluffiest crispy bites I’d ever taken, packed with flavour.

6th Picture: Our next course consists of three small bites, and is called “The Ocean”. We are presented with the ingredients that make up our bites. We start with the blue plate: blue crab, pickled with soy sauce, bergamot, ginger and local rum and served on top with young mangosteen granita. Amazing mild and soft textures, great presentation, nice chilli favours at the end, probably my favourite bite so far into the meal. 
In the white plate, we have Phuket rainbow lobster, topped with cilantro, mango and watermelon sauces. Wow. Fresh fruity flavours, intense spice which is central to the flavour evolution of the dish, a nice balance of sweetness and aromatic spice, the beautiful lobster being the perfect vehicle to transport these flavours into my mouth and let them evolve over time. On the far right, spotted Babylon (sea snail) from Krabi, served with chilli oil, fermented soybean paste, lime, shallots. I was not exactly a fan of the texture of the babylon itself - it was quite stiff and chewy, but the spiciness was very refreshing and pleasant, with slight durian off-flavours at the end of the dish’s flavour profile. I definitely didn’t enjoy this bite as much as the crab and lobster bites, due to it diverging texturally from their softness, but I do appreciate the concept of the course presenting us the animals of Thailand’s oceans. The flavours are very quintessentially Thai, served alongside the country’s best produce, to create a spectacular showcase of Southern Thai cuisine, without being pretentious. Lobsters and crabs are widely eaten across the country and are not just thrown in as luxury ingredients to pad up the menu.  

7th picture: The next course arrives, and wow, again, the presentation is beautiful. I like how the squid is plated with the chillies, so it mimics well.. a squid’s tentacles. Squidception. Anyway, we have Andaman squid, stuffed with burnt eggplant, stir fried with lobster trimmings, charcoal grilled, brushed with squid ink sauce and topped with pickled chillies. The temperature really suited the flavours here: pleasantly warm, the squid was chewy but cooked well, the chilli flavours dominate the flavour profile in the beginning, with the squid flavours coming through as we chew the bite further. This bite was nice, but it did feel like a bit of a step down from the great dishes we’d been having throughout the meal so far. I enjoyed it conceptually, but the texture of the squid a bit too stiff for my liking. 

8th picture: Given the intense chilli flavour of the previous dish, we are quickly presented a sorbet to suit down the spiciness and prepare our senses for the following courses. Santol sorbet, santol being a tropical fruit, native to Thailand. It’s a wild mangosteen, also known as “cotton fruit”, which is very pleasantly sweet, and tart, with a soft spongy inside. 
The sorbet was very interesting, it tasted a bit like plum - sweet, tart, refreshing, a classic palate cleanser, but I am enjoying that instead of a lemon granita, we actually get a sorbet from a local fruit. It does bring the spiciness levels down and prepares us for our next course, so it definitely served its purpose. Also wow. The plate for this is absolutely phenomenal.

9th Picture: What follows is the Crab Stick, a signature dish of Sorn’s, that’s been on the menu since Day 1. Surat Thani province blue crab, steamed and charcoal grilled, coated with fresh yellow chilli paste, topped with mud crab roe. We are told to either grab the leg and eat the meat off it, or use the spoon. I am a bit scared by the colour of the chilli paste, so I take it easy and eat with the spoon. We are told that right after finishing the course, we will be presented our following course, which will act as a neutraliser to the spiciness of the crab dish. Well, that’s a hefty warning. I take a bite and…. wow. The spiciness is central to the flavours of the dish, but it is not overpowering at all, instead, it lets the crab’s natural beautiful sweet flavours shine, accompanied by a muted spice. The crab roe adds this …  firm mushiness? to the textures of the crab, and for some reason it just works really well with the crab and the chilli paste. The most dominant flavour here is actually chilli pepper flavour, but not the spiciness, rather its sweetness. Deep, intense chilli pepper flavours, beautiful crab sweetness, amazing textures. 

10th Picture: The dish that is supposed to calm down the spiciness arrives - Melinjo. It’s boiled young coconut milk, young mellinjo leaves, seasoning from dried shrimp and squid, served with chargrilled coconut meat and topped with scallop oil. I could still feel the spiciness from the crab stick lingering in my mouth, and the soup mixed with it to kind of create this ma-la sensation in my mouth, while also soothing the spiciness on my tongue. A very weird feeling. The soup is very pleasantly sweet, it kind of resembles a coconut tea? of sorts, the coconut meat texture was beautifully soft, the flavours really coat your mouth. If there is something to follow up a banger of a signature dish with, then this is it. A very strong dish.

11th Picture: What follows is Gor Lae, a traditional Thai-Muslim skewer, with Surat Thani cockle, charcoal grilled, with garlic-curry paste and topped with sun dried abalone grated over the skewer. Stiff seafood texture from the cockle, akin to the Babylon from above, the dish is full of flavours, seafood at the back, deep evolving spicy flavours that do not overwhelm and let the cockle shine, dried abalone in the middle accentuates the cockle’s fresh sea flavours. The flavours were spectacular, but again, I wasn’t exactly a fan of the cockle’s texture. 

12th Picture: What follows is a game changer, for me personally as a diner. I have always preached my love for protein, and would always stray away from vegetable dishes, if possible. For me, vegetables just taste so much better with meat, and umami flavours are by far my favourite. Here, we get Sorn’s second signature course, called “The sea holds the forest”. An absolutely fantastic presentation of a course - crispy rice salad, with herbs from the south of Thailand. We are told that due to the nature of the seasons, the flavours of the herbs change, and chef has to adjust the proportions daily, in order to achieve the desired flavour profile. The presentation and the plate. Wow. The plating is absolutely phenomenal, one of the best I’d ever seen. Aaaaand, we are told that they mix everything together, and finish it with Budu sauce (fermented anchovies sauce, quite sweet and gently salty). 

13th Picture: The final presentation of the salad still looks good, but it’s nowhere near as beautiful as the original presentation. Anyway, I take a bite and…. Wow. The crunchiness from the rice really comes through, the salad has this intense sweetness which is beautifully nuanced and not overwhelming. Lemongrass isn’t really a flavour I usually enjoyed during my time in Thailand but wow… It is so well integrated into the sweet, acidic, herbal, fresh flavour profile of the dish. The balance and ratios amount to a stunning explosion of flavours, and each bite tasted different, I can promise you this. This is the dish with the longest evolving flavour profile that I’d ever tried, and it is absolutely one of my favourite dishes I’ve tried… Like ever. And it’s a vegetable-based dish! (The sauce isn’t, but most of the dish is). The budu sauce brings this balanced tangy sweetness into the mix. Intense and explosive, diverse flavours, reflecting Thailand’s very nature as a nation and its people. 

14th Picture: Then, time for our main course. “The Thai Way of Sharing”.  Southern Jasmine Rice, pot steamed. We are told that the cooking technique is unique and ensures an even cook on every single grain of rice. The way to tell if it worked is to check if the rice is “standing up” when the pot is removed. If it isn’t, a new portion will be issued, we are told. And unsurprisingly, it is “standing up”. The rice is charcoal steamed and cooked in Ranong mineral water. 

On the side - various Thai condiments: Som Hoak chilli paste, pork rind, dried sweet shrimp, dried yellow curry, pickled quail egg yolk with fish sauce and chillies.

We are told to try the rice by itself, and then eat it with the pickled yolk. We do as instructed and wow…. I was not expecting the intensity of the spiciness of the yolk. It was also texturally very interesting. It worked very well with the slight sweetness from the rice. A surprising, yet very pleasant bite.

Accompanied by redtail catfish, crispy catfish skin, with stink beans and southern curry. We are told to eat this with accompanying Brazillian pepper trea and cashew leaves to enhance the flavour. We are also given more curry paste, if we want to ramp up the spiciness of the catfish. Nicely Spicy, the curry paste is deeply flavourful and coats the tongue, the catfish has a very nice crunch to it and carries intense seafood flavours. 

We are then served an omelette, a traditional Thai comfort food, made of organic eggs, with tiger prawns, shallots and sweet basil. We are told to enjoy this with the dried yellow curry condiment, or the southern-style curry, served alongside the catfish. Amazing fluffy texture to the omelette, pairs incredibly with the intense curry paste, which is deep, explosive and tongue coating, the outside of the omelette is perfectly crunchy and provides a contrast to texture of the fluffy inside.

Following this is a morning glory salad, with abalone liver sauce, topped with dried shrimps and scallops. The crunch from the dried shrimps and scallops is absolutely crazy and goes so so well with the morning glory salad. Morning glory salad is a very commonly eaten Thai salad, I had had it a few times during my trip, but this is hands down the best iteration I’d ever tried. Rich, herbal, sweet flavours coming from the salad itself, the abalone liver stir fried sauce, amazing crunch from the dried condiments on top. 

Instead of bread and butter, we do things the Thai way - we get a nice fluffy, crumbly roti, served alongside a southern green curry. Incredibly fatty beef which is almost like Wagyu in the way it falls apart in your mouth, a fantastic rich green curry, balanced out with a bit of pineapple, rounding up the spicy and umami from the curry. The roti is also a perfect vehicle to consume curry and beef. Stunning!

The last accompanying dish is a plum soup, cooked with ish bones and chicken broth, dried tomatoes, dried scallop and pickled plum. The soup has a lot of collagen from the fish we are told. Inside the soup - charcoal grilled stingray from Krabi province. This is probably my favourite side dish, as much as I enjoyed the omelette. Amazing evolution of flavours, tart and acidic in the beginning, tiny bit of salt, evolving into a nice mild seafoody flavour from the stingray, every second a new flavour pops up and it’s incredible how the dish evolves in your mouth and how nuanced the flavours are. 

I really enjoyed how Sorn tells us, you are in Thailand, you will experience the most Thai flavours, in the most Thai way possible - by sharing them. I enjoyed the banchan-esque presentation of the different condiments, I loved trying the rice, with its accompanying curries, roti,  omelette and fish stir fry. The flavours were great, none of the dishes felt like they would be out of place in a normal Thai restaurant. Unpretentious flavours, executed incredibly. An unusual experience for me as an Euro-centric diner, I’ve only had a sharing-style main course once before (A. Wong in London, Chinese 2 star), so I really enjoyed it. Maybe more than I should have. An amazing course rooted in tradition, showcasing Thai culture and its cuisine’s diversity and versatility.

We are then given the option to choose between two desserts - a black sticky rice with coconut milk dessert, and a sago longan sorbet dessert. Naturally, we take one of each.


15th Picture: Bi co moi - traditional dessert from Phuket, black sticky rice with a fried cashew cracker, young coconut ice cream,  - bit of a less sweet dessert, saltiness from the cashew cracker, tropical flavours, nuttiness , all combine to a nicely balanced dessert in terms of the various textures and flavours present. A pleasant and unusual dessert. I like it. It’s different. 


16th Picture: Sago with longan sorbet and jelly and coconut iced powder, coconut meat different ways - very fruity, coconuty and tropical, nice variety of textures  - crunchy cracker, longan jelly with its fruit was nicely thick and fruity, while the sorbet brought a nice drop in temperature to the equation. I really enjoy the variation of textures and forms of different deeply Thai fruit. 

I enjoyed the desserts that weren’t intensely sweet per se, but were showcasing different flavours instead - tropical, nutty, slightly salty. A bold move that pays off in my opinion.

17th Picture: “Seasonal canned fruit” - a focus on mangosteen. Fresh mangosteen on the bottom, mangosteen sorbet and caramel on the top. A nice palate cleanser, acidic and fruity and very tropical, different to what we get in the Euro-centric restaurants. 

18th Picture: Petit fours, served alongside Thai-style tea or coffee. I take the tea. Thai tea with thai condensed milk - tea is strong by itself but the condensed milk balances it out with its sweetness. The petit fours are various traditional  Thai sweets, enjoyed by different peoples across the south of the country. Naturally, we take one of each.


Steamed pandan layer cake - nice and intensely pandan flavoured, good texture, very sticky jelly, intense herbal flavours

Roasted black sticky rice - texture like marzipan, unexpected tropical  flavours, nice and pleasant

Coconut pancake - divine, nice soft and spongy, perfect temperature, slightly salty, goes amazing with the traditional  powdered coconut sugar 

Cassava cake - gelatinous, quite mild and understated in flavour

Watermelon rice cracker - nice and crunchy and gourmand sweet, does not really give off watermelon flavours though

Green mangoes, tamarind, agar - Cold in temperature and a pleasant one biter, jelly is soft and tender. Acidic tartness balances out the spiciness and herbal aromas of the jelly. Quite cool, I liked it.

Mungbean cake - nice, warm, deep rich mung bean flavours, thick texture, slightly nutty and sweet flavours

Grilled corn and coconut - intense corn flavours, while the nice coconut cream is pleasanty rich and kind of dissolves the otherwise strong corn flavours coating your mouth. The leaf was way too chewy and I’m not sure it was supposed to be eaten, but I ate it lol

Some, like the coconut pancake and mango,tamarind, agar jelly really hit a spot. Others, like the corn and coconut really were a miss.

19th Picture: Egg cakes - nice and spongy, they remind me of madeleines in texture, but are way more eggy in flavour. They are nice and fluffy, but I particularly enjoyed dipping them into my tea.

20th Picture: We are also given a take-home gift, red guava jam and cashew butter, to enjoy with breakfast the day after. I love a nice take-home gift, so this is a big plus for me.

All in all, the food was very interesting, challenging, stimulating. A journey through Southern Thailand, educating us on their flavours, culture, tradition. A very quintessentially Thai meal, with presentation taken to 100. I really, really enjoyed the tableware used by the kitchen, especially the plates. They really added to the already beautiful presentation of some of the courses. The signature dishes were really good. One nitpick I have is the service. It felt robotic, rehearsed, like they are there to present the dish and then they just leave you to it. The little interactions we had with them did not feel genuine, yet this can be attributed to cultural differences. Thai people are very kind and welcoming, and service felt a bit cold and stiff and robotic. 

The food was very interesting, and the meal had a cool factor to it, as I already mentioned. The interior was very nice, the toilets were also stunning, and I have to give bonus points for the Japanese toilets. Is the food good? Most definitely, especially if you enjoy spice. Does it warrant being one of the toughest reservations in the world? Eh, that’s up to you. I enjoyed my experience, but probably wouldn’t rush to return. 


Sorn is the first 3-starred restaurant in Thailand, and was recently voted Asia’s best restaurant in the OAD rankings, beating the likes of Zen, Tresind Studio, etc. Quite frankly, I’d spent 5 days in Bangkok at this point, and I found the food scene to be generally aimed towards affluent members of the high-society, or expats, delivering heavily in the pricing category, but sadly not so much on quality, at least in my opinion. Sorn was my last meal in Thailand, as I had to run to the airport and catch a flight to London straight after, but I would like to say that it was the perfect way to end my 3 week long trip to Thailand. It is one of my favourite meals in recent times, and I’d recommend anyone who gets the chance, to go immediately. At £195 per person all in, it is one of the cheapest 3 star meals you can get anywhere in the world. And it’s exciting, bold, rooted in tradition, while also pushing boundaries. I’d rate it a solid 18.5/20, in line with a lot of my other favourite 3* experiences, such as Mirazur, Core by Clare Smyth, and Rutz.

TL;DR: with enough tinkering and know how this entry level setup punches above its waist and lacks nothing other, more expensive, god tier, endgame home machines offer.  

After 4 years of daily use I’ve come to some conclusions I’d just like to put out there. 

There seems to be a lot of hate towards this combo however, I think a lot of it unfounded and at the price point, it can’t be beat. It delivers consistency, quality and ease of use. 

Let me preface by saying I consider myself a coffee snob, I hail from a coffee producing nation where espresso is ubiquitous, found at every corner of every neighborhood in a bakery, deli, restaurant, there’s like 3 drinks and 2 sizes to choose from and are rarely displayed as it is common knowledge and uniform across the board and ingrained in everyone’s psyche from a very young age. These establishments are typically owned by Italian, Spanish or Portuguese immigrants, most shops sporting Rancilio, La Marzocco and similar industrial, multi group machines and equally powerful grinders, large hoppers, flick lever dose controls and built in tampers where they push the portafilter upwards to flatten the puck in a matter of milliseconds. No scales, no distribution tools and a wooden knock box built-in on the counter that resembles the chopping block where  William Wallace was beheaded at the end of Braveheart. 

The beans are mass-produced but relatively fresh and uniform, produced and roasted locally to a consistent medium to dark roast that makes it hard to distinguish between the two or three available, mainstream brands. 

I would call this style of espresso traditional, old-world coffee and what I set to achieve when I dove into the world of at home espresso.  

Growing up in an Americanized culture, with an ESL degree from a very young age and over 100 entries into the US before permanently relocating at age 20 and becoming a naturalized citizen 10 years later, the assimilation and adaptation process was seamless, however, the biggest culture shock was, of course, the daily rituals surrounding coffee consumption both at home and on the go. 

From having multiple macchiatos a day across multiple establishments for what was literally pocket change (most coffee breaks would amount to less than a dollar) to making and drinking filter coffee, learning the Starbucks “lingo” and figuring out how to order something similar to what I was used to try and scratch that itch and satisfy the nostalgia and longing often associated with permanently relocating to another country as adult, regardless of how worldly, multi-cultural and assimilated you are, a taste of home is something every immigrant longs for and very few things can scratch that itch, music, food. For me, that is coffee as I couldn’t care less about other aspects of my heritage that never really considered mine. Oh and by the way, that Starbucks order ? Double Espresso Macchiato, extra dry. Sometimes triples or quads, ranging from $3 to $5 a pop. 

I found out early that only veteran baristas would even know what I was talking about. My order sparking confusion on newbies or less experienced ones every time. If I was met with a “what size ?” Or a confused look on the cashier’s face scrambling to find the button labeled “EM” on the till, I would change my order to a Venti of whatever medium or dark roast was on tap. 

When I received my drink in any other than the shortest short, stubby, cup, I knew I was in for a milky gulp of disappointment right away, same as when picking up my drink and feeling the mere weight of it. So I stopped ordering it unless the “good” baristas were on duty, some of whom have actually become some of my best friends long after they’ve moved on to bigger and better things beyond those part time jobs and,  we still enjoy coffee as the central theme of our friendships, more on that later. 

Ten or so years later, the rise of “3rd wave and specialty coffee” shops reached my now hometown. Found more than a few coffee shops that spoke my love language and finally I could find something similar to what I was used to, albeit at a hefty price and with the same lack of consistency from one shop and one barista to the next, the insistence of pouring the milk as opposed to scooping the foam on top in spite of my requests resulted in many macchiatos that would qualify as a cortado or flat white instead. 

Over the years, most of these coffee shops evolved towards using light, and medium-light roasts and away from the dark side. This resulted in very interesting shots when sipped sans milk but, with a strange tang and acidity that I refuse to accept as “good coffee” regardless of what raspberry, citrus or over-ripe banana flavor notes they offer.  In my humble opinion, these blends aren’t ideal for milk based drinks, even those with minimal amounts like my go-to macchiatos, just enough to round the flavor, mellow down the bitterness and improve the creamy texture. 

The “coffee scene” quickly became almost hostile with undertones of gatekeeping to the more traditionalist of patrons, everyone became an expert and a sort of air of superiority started filling the atmosphere of some of these places, my own snobbery shying in comparison to some of these self-proclaimed experts. Again, I met some great people over the years and as the industry continued to evolve and cater to current trends and owners and staff moved on to bigger better things, these once safe heavens for coffee loving enthusiasts and aficionados became exclusive clubs where fitting a stereotype became the price of admission almost and anyone outside the preset mindset and even a modicum of an opinion, was met with raised noses and almost talked down to at any attempt to share a dissenting thought or simply daring to nicely plead for a double shot of espresso with a bit of foam scooped on top. 

Years later, I purchased my first home, a bachelor pad of my own and, my family showered me with an ungodly amount of money in Bed Bath and Beyond gift cards to properly furnish my man-cave of solitude and secretly hoping I’d spend it on silverware, towels, sheets, candles and the like and, after purchasing the essentials, one set of sheets, one set of silverware, kitchen knives, few pots and pans, shower caddy, shower curtain, a single bath towel to replace my worn, etc. I was left with close to $400 to spare and while I could’ve used plates, cutting boards and other “essentials” like replacing my 10 year old towels, I chose to treat myself and bought a Breville Bambino.  

Quickly discovered pre ground coffee like lavazza or illy wasn’t it so I purchased a used burr grinder I read about somewhere and found for cheap on a second hand website, can’t even remember the brand oXo maybe ? 

Then I discovered the pressurized baskets provided by Breville weren’t it either so I procured a proper naked portafilter and 22g basket. This is the point in time where I learned about “grind finer” and found a 3D printed part that would make my crappy grinder reach finer settings below the lowest standard setting. Had my first taste of real, coffee shop grade, syrupy goodness and more importantly, it tasted exactly like that nostalgia I’ve been chasing, the only problem ? Couldn’t be replicated, grinder suffered major retention issues and its cheap little motor couldn’t cope. 

Enter Breville SGP, another $200 and the last of my house-warming funds at the now defunct BBB (talk about turning perfectly good money that works anywhere into stupid money that works only at one place no longer even exists).

Immediately started pulling “table-slapping” shots, shots that hit that sweet spot, make you close your eyes and retreat to an almost religious experience within yourself that would make any onlookers blush and question your sanity, like that first bite of grandma’s key-lime pie on a hot summer day, an unmistakable flavor, aroma and texture that evokes not only a physical reaction that makes your mouth water, the hairs on your arms stand in attention as goosebumps flush your entire body and make your brain swim in an instant sea of dopamine but also, invites memories of people and places, shared moments and experiences surrounded in laughter, stress, celebration and mourning, special occasions and the most mundane activities of daily living. Nostalgia. 

It’s been 4 years, I’ve experimented and honed my skills, tried different setups courtesy of some of those friends made along the way who now have more money than sense and have allowed me to experiment with their expensive toys to compare and we’ve come to the same conclusion, with enough tinkering and know how, you can achieve great espresso with any setup you can afford and, mine delivers comparable results to theirs, albeit with a few caveats. 

After trying a modded GCP paired with a DF64 and a LeLit Bianca paired with a Niche Zero I can honestly say the end results are negligibly different, the main differences are in workflow and the margin of error each of these machines are able to afford. 

The biggest benefits that I noticed with the more expensive machines is that margin of error, and the ability to better extract shots from lighter roasts that depend on consistent, more specific temperatures and a finer grind to properly express. Also, I’ve found they are more forgiving when it comes to puck prep mistakes, I assume due to their more robust construction, consistent and higher pressures, temp retention, even water dispersal, etc. 

An error in puck prep with the BB can mean the difference between a drinkable shot and a waste of time, money and perfectly good coffee that tastes like regret and mulch. 

Another benefit to more robust machines was the extended period of times beans are “viable” for optimal results. With the BB, fresh is best. The quality of the shots degrading quickly the longer the beans sit, requiring frequent grind size adjustments every few days to maintain the same dose and ratio and becoming pretty much untamable after the 3 week mark. Other machines seem to be more consistent in grind size and shot times regardless of how old the beans are, to a degree of course. We pretty much agree after 4 to 6 weeks shots become lackluster and flat with little to no body. Don’t get me wrong, these are still coffee shop grade and magnitudes better than anything you can get from the green siren overlord down the street, but still a noticeable downgrade for those discerning few. 

Luckily for me and any coffee freak worth their salt, a 310g bag of beans doesn’t ever last anywhere near the 4 week mark, except at times of prolonged absences like a vacation or involuntary hiatus from daily use.  

This 4-year review of the BB+SGP turned into a retrospective of my personal coffee journey and what started as an appreciation post for this setup, turned into an essay on my personal opinions on coffee culture and the state of the espresso at home industry as a whole. In 4 short years the espresso at home game has definitely reached meme levels across the general population, particularly in social media circles. 

Nevertheless, provided certain standards are met and a few variables kept within very narrow margins, this beginner setup can consistently produce high quality espresso and, up to 2 to 3 shots in rapid succession. 

I Haven’t had a malfunction in 4 years, little maintenance has been required and very little in terms of modding had to be done to the equipment, added a single dose hopper and bellows to the SGP and significantly improved retention. I would recommend this setup to any enthusiast with a limited budget, beginners looking to dive head-first into the espresso at home rabbit hole  or those that want to remain frugal while achieving remarkable results or those who simply refuse to let money triumph over sense like myself, provided of course the following variables are kept in check and, the limitations and expectations realistically managed, then this setup is for you. 

1- Stick to medium to medium/dark roasts, always fresh, hermetically kept if possible for the duration of their lifespan.

2- Enjoy espresso and espresso-based milk drinks in the most traditional sense of the word. Old-world, classic, robust, syrupy, bold, creamy espresso. And not too concerned exotic flavors or mythical undertones of rhubarb, bay leaf and wet frankincense, just plain, good, soul warming, coffee. 

3- Puck-prep has to be on point. Meaning, proper dose, grind, WDT, tampering, puck screen. It helps if you’re slightly autistic, OCD or otherwise neuro-divergent. 

This seems to be the biggest benefit of more expensive machines, they can be more forgiving with these errors. However, with this setup, it can make the difference between the best you’ve ever had and absolute dog-shit tasting with motor oil and radioactive sludge notes. 

All that being said, love my setup, it now sits in my office at work replacing the old Nespresso I kept for clients and co-workers while I transition into a more permanent housing situation,  bachelor years and bachelor pad gone, I currently lack the space for my extensive coffee laboratory in the tiny apartment my fiancé, 2 dogs and a stray tuxedo cat that showed up one day and refused to leave currently occupy as we, too move on to bigger and better things. 

Needless to say, minds are being blown  around the office as “table-slapping” drinks are doled out to the deserving and undeserving alike, the silent nods, and various enjoyment onomatopoeic noises coffee enjoyers make after their first sip makes my day, everyday and I recognize it a sign they too, taste what I taste, and experience the same elation I do. If anything, I enjoy ruining franchise coffee for people. I’m petty like that. 

Nowadays, even with all the tinkering and meticulous puck prep required,  it takes me about 5 minutes flat to produce an espresso based drink I would blindly put against any local coffee shop in competition, at any time.  

This is a fully capable, user friendly, overpowered and affordable setup and I’m tired of the internet telling me it’s not!  

This leads me to believe the same can be achieved with cheaper, off brand offerings if you’re willing to tinker, prep and be meticulous with your methods, will I upgrade in order to favor convenience and avoid the minor inconveniences this humble setup offers ? Maybe. I’d soon rather buy something useless like another watch. As of now, I enjoy the process and the tinkering, and the sense of achievement  that comes from getting exceptional results from the underdog.

He was older, lived kind of nearby, and said he was looking for something consistent and mutually beneficial. I’ve done this before, so I wasn’t expecting fireworks, but I was open to seeing how it played out.

Over messages, he seemed cool. Respectful, kind of formal but not in a bad way. He asked about what I was looking for, told me he liked women who were focused and knew how to carry themselves. It wasn’t giving love bombing or anything weird, so I agreed to meet.         
            
We picked a coffee spot quiet, nothing fancy, but cute. It’s one of those spots I go to sometimes when I need to clear my head or meet people lowkey. I dressed nice, put myself together, nothing over the top but definitely showed up looking good.

When I got there… the energy was just off. He didn’t act like the same person I’d been messaging. He barely talked, barely looked at me. I tried asking questions, tried to spark some real convo, and it just felt dry. Like, I don’t even think he was trying to be rude, but it was awkward. It kind of felt like he didn’t even want to be there or maybe he just wasn’t expecting me?

I was in my head a little, like damn… was it my looks? My vibe? But honestly, I know I came in with the right energy. Sometimes people just don’t match in real life, no matter how good the conversation was online.

We sat for like 30–40 minutes. I wrapped it up, said it was nice meeting him, and left. He texted later like “hope you got home safe” but nothing else. No follow-up, no talk about seeing me again.

It’s cool though. That’s just how this goes sometimes. Not every arrangement turns into something. I just wanted to rant about it.😭",9,1750876183.0,sugarlifestyleforum,25,0.92,False

I’ve developed the Galadari Method for my 1-2 cup Bialetti moka pot, using ice cubes to cool the top chamber, creating a vacuum that compresses grounds downward for a smoother, less bitter brew. Here’s how:Steps:

1. Fill bottom chamber with room temp water to the valve. Add medium-fine coffee (table salt texture), level without tamping.
2. Heat on low flame.
3. At 3–6 min (pot warm, no brewing), add 1 small ice cube (1 inch) to top chamber.
4. When coffee flows (gurgling), add 1-2 small ice cubes.
5. Brew until gurgling intensifies, remove, pour, enjoy!

Why It Works:

* Room temp water + low heat keeps extraction at 90–96°C, reducing bitterness.
* Ice cools top chamber, condensing steam in the bottom chamber’s top to form a partial vacuum. This pulls grounds downward, enhancing extraction.
* Result: Smoother coffee with bold flavor.

Tips:

* Time ice carefully to avoid over-cooling.
* Scale for larger pots: 2 cubes before, 3 during for 3-4 cups.
* Adjust cube size if coffee’s too mild or bitter.

Has anyone tried cooling their moka pot? Share your results or tweaks!

TL;DR: Galadari Method uses room temp water, low heat, and ice (1 cube at 3–6 min, 2 when coffee starts pouring out) for smoother moka pot coffee via a vacuum effect. Try it!",2,1750875920.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

It's legal in my city and state. It was clearly labeled on the menu separate from the drinks, food, and milk options. It was something a customer had to request and pay extra for it. 

However, a single person who wandered in one day and saw it on the menu made a whole social media campaign calling for a boycott to drive them out of business. They went so far as deceptively insinuating the shop was sneakily serving it to unsuspecting customers. The shop stopped offering it, but the mob hasn't relented. Now they're accusing the shop of being shady for quietly removing the item and all advertisement related to it. Isn't that what they wanted?

Though boycotts are legal, cancel culture has been getting out of control. This is why I started a new Reddit account dedicated to my business and separate from any personal opinions, though it means having to build my online reputation all over again.

1lkd9lz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_cursedsimplicity/comments/1lkd9lz/allow_it_in_completely/,"Allow it in, completely.","I remember when I found the first one. It started on my left calf, and I assumed, like the others, that maybe it was an ingrown hair or an angry follicle. My mom had just passed away, and since I was dealing with the stress and grief of that, I gave little to no attention to the issue. Again, I considered it benign and went along with my day. But it wasn’t until it popped in the shower and spilled out, going down my calf and into the drain. It was a dark black, like squid ink, with the consistency of blood. It had the most pungent smell to it, and I remember vomiting there in the shower once it hit me fully.

The doctors gave me some medication and told me at-home remedies, which did work at first, but eventually my body grew to resist all that they had to offer. I’ve had x-rays, CTs, MRIs, and ultrasounds to see if there was some kind of malignant growth within me; radiation, surgical removals, and experimental treatments in attempt to stop them from appearing; holistic remedies that involve eating turmeric or drinking apple cider vinegar for an “internal cleanse” – but none of these works or gave rational results. These wounds just keep appearing day after day with no end. Just as one heals, another will appear somewhere on me.

I have to shower multiple times a day, along with running the laundry due to the mess I make. I have towels laid out at the places I lounge most, like my bed or the sofa, in an attempt to capture any fluids that escape from the bandages or new formations that break open from internal pressure. It’s messy and gross. In the eyes of professionals, and even to myself, I am a medical oddity.

While this was odd on its own, it got even more odd the other day. I had just woken up, and no surprise, my gauzes had leaked out in my sleep and onto the towels around me. I groaned, knowing it was another long day of cleaning ahead, and got up to begin my day. Before I could fully step away from my bed, I felt something wet grab at my ankle, pulling it backwards and sending me flying forward to the floor. I hit my head against the wood, my arms not having enough time to fully catch my fall. A cry of pain and obscene words fell from my mouth. *What the hell just happened?*

Still on my stomach, I peered behind my shoulder and to my bed, the under part of it, and was met with a big pair of round eyes. I scrambled to my knees and crawled towards the window, turning around and sitting with my back pressed against it as I looked under my bed again. It was still there.

It slid out from under my bed to reveal itself. The thing that grabbed me was a round, wet black ball of goo. In fact, it looked very similar to the blackness that leaked out from my wounds every day. It had big round eyes set in its mushy body with no other facial features. The blob made its way towards me, leaving behind a trail of sludge behind it. I sat there, frozen and unsure of what to do. The little ball of sludge made its way up my leg and rests itself in the middle of my lap. It was warm. The eyes, like absurdly large boba pearls, stared up at me.

“H..Hi.?” I managed to say, kind of. I didn’t know what to say and that was the first thing to come out of my mouth. My brain was still trying to process exactly what was going on in front of me. I looked back at my bed and saw that underneath was a leak of black coming from the mattress, landing right on the floor where it came from. Did it form itself from my wounds? As I was staring off, the black ball was nuzzling itself against some of the gauze pads on my thighs. The pads on my thighs were already full and leaking out the sides from being left on overnight. I was going to get up when I noticed that the little ball was soaking up the fluids into itself.

I cautiously took off a gauze to see what would happen. It sat directly on top of the boil, and I was expecting it to start oozing down my leg like crazy, but it didn’t. Instead, it was soaking up into the ball of black. I was stunned. I removed another gauze nearby and it moved over to that site, doing the same thing. It was sucking up the black from me like a sponge, and once it was done, the wound seemed to be empty for a good chunk of time.

At the time it was a blessing but as I type this out, it has become more of a problem; another one to add into my life.

That little black ball has turned into a huge, demanding piece of sludge. You see, when I discovered that it would soak up the black secretions from my body, I went with it. After living with these boils for what feels like forever, I was eager to do anything and everything that would help slow them down. I just wanted to feel normal again, to pick up the pieces of my life and try again without these wounds holding me back.

It started small, letting the little black glob sit on the boils that adorned my legs. It moved from spot to spot, sitting for a moment then sliding itself over to another, sucking up whatever it could. From there, I let it move upwards, and eventually anywhere that had ulcers; arms, chest, legs, back. During these moments of brief cleansing, I found myself talking to it. Once the problem got bad, embarrassed to be seen in public, I shut myself off in the safety of my home. Doors locked; shades drawn. Everything was delivered and left at the front door, and once confirmed the person was gone, I’d quickly grab everything and go back into hiding. This thing, while obviously not a human being or close to any kind of being, was the closest physical interaction I had in a long time. I was vulnerable, lonely, and I think it knew.

During these feeding sessions, I talked to the sludge about everything. My job before I resigned, the coffee shops I missed visiting, and about my mom. God, my mom. I miss her. Things have felt so much lonelier and emptier since she left this world; left me in it to survive without her. It felt good to talk about her, even if it was to a ball of sludge. It couldn’t speak back, hell, I don’t even know if it could hear, but it felt good to reminisce about her. It felt good to remember life as it was before I became ill.

The moments of it removing the black liquid started out small and controlled. At a certain point in the day, I would sit at the window on the floor, where we first met, and it would come sliding out from underneath. I would let it hang out on certain spots, all within a time limit, so I could get up to clean off and go about the rest of my day. But it slowly became more demanding. If I was out in the living room watching TV, it would slide its way out to join me and find a spot on my lap; or I could be in the kitchen making food and it would sit on my foot, taking out whatever it could. The black glob turned into a clingy house pet that just demanded my attention, or more so demanded to feed. It was sort of endearing to have something that needed and wanted me.

But it started to want more, pushing further to get what it wanted from me. It would find spots that hadn’t erupted yet and would force it to, liquid popping out and soaking the area around me. I would wake up in the middle of the night to it feeding on me, wrapping itself around whichever limb it's feeding on and staying put until content. 

The small ball grew bigger with each passing day, its viscosity becoming thicker and heavier, like a living blood clot. It smelled too, just like how my wounds do after they pop and the smell was everywhere. It stuck and clung to the furniture of my home, to all of my clothes, even the wallpaper. My life, inside and out, has been painted in a disgusting black that no amount of scrubbing can remove. 

You may ask why I haven’t attempted to stop it or to get help, and as insane as it seems, this thing needs me to survive and I, on the other end, have given up on surviving. My body is covered in sores now, full and dribbling all around me, raw from the feedings. Wherever I go in my house, I now leave trails of thick, uncontrollable muck. The black sludge mops everything up happily, growing bit by bit, and honestly I don’t mind seeing it do so. 

We’ve developed a strange codependency; it needs me and I need it. Ever since my mom died, I’ve just wanted someone else to need me, to love me despite everything. This thing, while it takes more than it gives, needs and loves me. Some nights when it's wrapped along my back, I can feel that through the warmth it radiates. It sits and listens to me, hears my cries and desires. That’s all I’ve wanted.

As I type this, it’s wrapped itself almost completely around me. Last night, as we lay in bed, it developed the ability to speak. Its voice was hushed, gentle, full of warmth. I stared at the photo of my mom on my nightstand as it spoke.

*“I am you. And you are me. My friend, let me take away this overflow within you. Know peace, know comfort like no other. Allow me in, completely.”* 

Those words have echoed in my head. This thing came from me, it is me, why not fully unite with it? There is nothing stopping me, nothing left to lose. I am miserable; forsaken by my own body and the outside world. The only companion I have had in a long time is asking me, begging me, to let it help me. It cares. I’m writing this to leave documentation of what has been happening to me. I do not know what will happen once I let it in completely, but that is alright with me. 

If you are reading this and see the sludge, please do not harm it. Treat it with the love and warmth it provided me. It is a gentle creature that only wants to heal and free me, and I am assuming it has. I am somewhere in there, united with it, feeling its warmth entirely.

I will know peace, I will know comfort, and you should too. If you find yourself with your own black blob, do not be afraid. Allow it in, completely.

1lkd64e,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_McFishingMad/comments/1lkd64e/belching_update_great_improvement/,Belching update! Great improvement,"Hi guys,

Thank you all so much for your support.

I have given up Squash as they all contain artificial sweeteners, and apparently they can ferment in your gut and to be honest we never drank squash before just water, I am not a fan of tea and coffee and so I was drinking 1.5 litres plus of diluted squash every day even though I made it very weak, I now have one mug of organic decaf tea and one mug of cappaccino which is usually in a cafe and I found that I need to have a biscuit or something with the hot drinks then I dont start belching.

Because I still need a further litre plus of fluid my wife blends a tin of peaches (in natural juice) it makes like a smoothy and I use that as squash substitute a tin of peaches lasts about 3 days.

To improve my gut health I have a teaspoon of live yoghurt a couple of times a day, that has really helped.

It took a few days before I saw real improvement and now I would say it was nearly normal whereas before it was making me feel ill I could feel it bubbling inside me.

They have me on Imodium but I have reduced that to 2 and a half a day and output is ok, and Lansoprazol, unfortunately both these have sideeffects of belching so I can’t win really, but I m greatly improved.

Thanks again it is nice to know you are there.",1,1750875348.0,u_McFishingMad,0,1.0,False
1lkd63z,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1lkd63z/does_your_adhd_like_sugar/,Does your ADHD like sugar?,"    So I’ve experimented with different energy drinks since I started working after highschool because I literally can’t get through the day if I work without one. My favorite is Red Bull (the flavors I’ve never had original) and I’ve been trying to lose a bit of weight so I tried the sugar free one for a bit. I found it to just not work as well. I couldn’t sustain an energy level at all, even if I chugged half the can at once. 

    I went back to the one with sugar and instantly felt so much better. I’ve noticed this with protein bars as well. I do so much better and experience less brain fog and fatigue if I have ones that contain sugar. I’m not sure if my body is just weird or if I’ve placebo’d myself into thinking something doesn’t work because I hate artificial sweeteners and sugar substitutes in general. 

    I have really sensitive taste buds and immediately know the difference. Anyone else experience something like this?

Before I get yelled at, yes I’m on meds, yes my doctor knows I drink caffeine and I do not experience side effects from my medication. I also get 8-10 hours of sleep per night and yes still tired. I’m not self medicating with energy drinks. I use them while I’m working to help reduce crash outs during meditation plateaus. 

  Sorry to clarify someone yelled at me in a previous sub. I struggle with chronic fatigue and lack of motivation and I desperately need to be 100% for work and I can’t do it without the extra boost. I only have caffeine 3 times a week. Coffee makes me sick and is expensive and I just don’t like it that much. I also always drink water with my energy drinks.",2,1750875347.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

""Joanna, a barren woman like you is just a worthless wife who can’t even fulfill the basic role.""  
  
Vanessa strutted over in her four-inch heels and kicked my shin with the pointed toe. ""Don't you even think the Hamptons are wasting a lot keeping a worthless woman like you?""  
  
""Well, Mrs. Hampton, aren't you embarrassed occupying the position you don't deserve?""  
  
""Women like you are just a complete waste of space...""  
  
I fought back my rage and stared directly into Vanessa's heavily made-up face: ""You're just a secretary. Don't you think you're way out of line here? Since when did an outsider have the right to interfere in the Hampton family's business?""  
  
Three years ago, the Collins family was on the edge of bankruptcy, and the Hamptons stepped in to save us.  
  
I'll never forget the image of my father kneeling before George Hampton, begging for help.  
  
The Hampton family's terms were crystal clear—I had to marry Nicholas Hampton.  
  
""Joanna's smart, she's got a good head for business. She'll make the perfect Hampton wife."" George Hampton had said at the time.  
  
It was both gratitude and a transaction.  
  
The Hamptons needed my business talent, and the Collins family needed financial backing.  
  
For my father's sake, I married Nicholas Hampton.  
  
Over these years, I'd helped Nicholas triple the company's performance and successfully took Hampton Group public.  
  
Mrs. Susan Parks, our housekeeper, couldn't stand watching this anymore. She stepped forward and grabbed Vanessa's arm: ""Miss White, the Hamptons pay you good money. Why can't you just do your secretary job? This family's personal stuff ain't none of your business.""  
  
Vanessa jerked her arm away and shrieked: ""Mind your own business, you old bat!""  
  
Mrs. Parks stumbled backward but continued trying to reason with her: ""Miss White, you need to have some conscience. We've all seen what Mrs. Hampton's done for this family. You got no business messing with their marriage!""  
  
""Shut up!"" Vanessa raised her hand to strike Mrs. Parks. ""How dare a servant try to lecture me?""  
  
I quickly stepped forward to block her, saying coldly: ""Vanessa, Mrs. Parks has been with this family for twenty years. Even Mr. Hampton respects her. Touch her and see what happens if you dare.""  
  
Right then, George Hampton came downstairs with a dark expression, taking in the chaotic scene in the living room, his brow furrowed deeply.  
  
""What the hell is going on!"" George barked, his gaze sweeping over Vanessa's arrogant face. ""Susan, throw this cocky secretary out of my house!""  
  
But Vanessa showed no fear. Instead, she stepped forward, prominently displaying her belly: ""I'd like to see anyone dare to touch me!""  
  
She smugly rubbed her stomach. ""Mr. Hampton, take a good look—I'm carrying the Hampton heir!""  
  
The household staff began whispering among themselves.  
  
""Mrs. Hampton's been here three years and nothing. Maybe she really can't have kids?""  
  
""Shh, keep it down! But I mean, look at her belly—she's definitely pregnant.""  
  
""I mean, she wouldn't dare act this bold unless she was carrying a Hampton baby, right?""  
  
""Look how cocky, bet she really is having a Hampton baby!""  
  
Hearing these murmurs, Vanessa's lips curved into a arrogant smile.  
  
She deliberately pushed out her slightly rounded abdomen and looked at me provocatively: ""Hear that? Even the staff can see what's obvious, but you're still living in denial.""  
  
She turned to address the staff, raising her voice: ""When I officially become the Mrs.Hampton, everyone here today is getting double pay!""  
  
The staff immediately grew restless, and several were already flashing obsequious smiles at Vanessa.  
  
This made Vanessa even more smug. Her red-lacquered fingernails gently caressed her belly: ""Some people's time playing house is about to be over.""  
  
George's face turned ashen. He stared intently at Vanessa's protruding belly with this scary, murderous look.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
""Enough!"" George suddenly roared, immediately silencing the staff.  
  
Vanessa flinched at the outburst but quickly straightened her spine: ""Mr. Hampton, what do you mean? I'm carrying your—""  
  
""Shut up!"" George slammed his fist on the coffee table, making the cups rattle violently. ""You think I don't know my own son's condition?""  
  
He turned to look at me, a flash of guilt in his eyes: ""Joanna, the Hampton family owes you.""  
  
I stood there, coldly watching this absurd scene unfold.  
  
The truth was, we discovered we couldn't have children in our first year of marriage.  
  
Nicholas and I had visited the best hospitals both domestically and abroad. The results were always the same.  
  
The problem was with Nicholas—he suffered from azoospermia and would never be able to get a woman pregnant.  
  
George knew all about it.  
  
He had even locked the medical reports in his study drawer, terrified it would get out and damage the Hampton family's reputation.  
  
Now, watching Vanessa flaunt her belly so arrogantly, I just found it laughable.  
  
Either she was lying, or this child couldn't possibly be Nicholas's.  
  
I let out a cold laugh and picked up the prenatal report from the table, waving it slightly: ""Miss White, this piece of paper only proves you're pregnant. Doesn't prove it's a Hampton baby.""  
  
George's expression turned dangerously dark as he pounded the table: ""This is insane! How dare you try to deceive my family!""  
  
Vanessa's face went deathly pale. She bit her lip and pulled out several photos from her phone: ""Mr. Hampton, just look at these...""  
  
The photos clearly showed Nicholas and Vanessa naked in bed together, dated three months ago.  
  
Vanessa's eyes reddened as her voice trembled: ""That night Mr. Hampton was drunk and insisted on pulling me into—""  
  
Suddenly, My mother-in-law Marianne rushed over and grabbed my hand, tears streaming down her face:  
  
""Joanna, dear, I'm so sorry! All these years you've suffered in silence! What the Hampton family owes you, I'll never be able to make up for!""  
  
She suddenly spun around and grabbed a cup from the coffee table, hurling it at Vanessa: ""You shameless bitch! How dare you treat my daughter-in-law this way!""  
  
Vanessa dodged it smoothly, and the cup shattered at her feet. She shrieked: ""You old hag! Where was this anger when your son was sleeping with me?"" She deliberately pushed out her belly. ""Now you wanna play the saint?""  
  
""Bullshit!""  
  
Marianne trembled with rage, pointing at Vanessa's nose: ""A trashy piece of work like you? My son wouldn't give you a second look! Why don't you take a good look at that botched plastic surgery job you call a face!""  
  
Vanessa sneered and pulled out another stack of photos from her purse, throwing them on the table: ""Take a good look, old hag! Here's your precious son in my bed!""  
  
The photos clearly showed intimate shots of Nicholas and Vanessa together.  
  
I calmly looked at the photos, feeling completely unmoved.  
  
Actually, I'd discovered Nicholas's affairs within the first month of our marriage.  
  
Over the years, he'd cycled through woman after woman. I'd grown numb to it long ago.  
  
The only reasons I hadn't divorced were gratitude for George's role in saving the Collins family years ago, and because Marianne treated me like her own daughter.  
  
Every time Nicholas got caught in some scandal, Marianne was always the first to defend me.  
  
""I've seen plenty of photos like these,"" I said flatly. ""Miss White, you think these alone will secure your place in the Hampton family?""  
  
Vanessa's expression shifted: ""What—what do you mean?""  
  
Marianne gripped my hand tightly, her voice choked with emotion: ""Joanna, I failed to raise my son properly.""  
  
I shook my head and pulled out a document from my purse: ""This is Nicholas's medical report from last year, clearly documenting his condition."" I looked directly at Vanessa. ""You sure that baby's really his?""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Marianne was trembling with rage, pointing at Vanessa and screaming: ""You shameless bitch! Faking photos wasn't enough—Now you're trying to scam the Hampton family with some bastard kid?""  
  
George walked over to me with a dark expression and patted my shoulder: ""Joanna, don't worry. From today, you'll inherit everything the Hampton family owns.""  
  
He cast a cold glance at Vanessa. ""As for those who don't know their place, they won't see a single penny!""  
  
Hearing George say he would leave all the Hampton assets to me, Vanessa panicked: ""No! Nicholas promised me! He said as long as I got pregnant, I'd become Mrs. Hampton, and everything would belong to my son!""  
  
""You can't do this to me! I'm carrying the Hampton family's only heir!""  
  
She frantically beat her own stomach: ""Open your damn eyes and see the truth! This is the Hampton family's future inheritor!""  
  
Then she turned to me, her eyes filled with venom: ""You barren bitch, what right do you have to inherit the Hampton fortune? My son is the Hampton family's only heir!""  
  
Suddenly, she dropped to her knees in front of George: ""Mr. Hampton, you can't be so heartless! This is your own grandson! Once the baby is born, you'll see immediately that he's a Hampton!""  
  
As she spoke, she pulled out a stack of ultrasound photos from her purse and scattered them toward everyone: ""Look! This child's nose and eyes are identical to Nicholas's baby pictures!""  
  
Among the ultrasound photos Vanessa had thrown, a paternity test report unexpectedly fluttered to the ground.  
  
Marianne was quick to snatch it up.  
  
""What's this?"" Marianne squinted, and her face suddenly went pale. ""George, look at this!""  
  
George took the report, and there it was in black and white: ""Paternity Test Results: Fetal DNA matches Nicholas Hampton with 99.99% certainty, confirming biological relationship.""
