1jpsgln,https://i.redd.it/pmtrmmsj4gse1.jpeg,Why Hillary and Paul Are 1923’s Most Misunderstood Pair,"I’ve been seeing a lot of flak thrown at Hillary and Paul from *1923* lately—people calling their deaths a cheap plot twist or dismissing them as shallow and unlikeable. I get the frustration, but I think the criticism is off-base, and I wanted to dig into their characters a bit. Having rewatched their scenes, I’m convinced there’s more to them than meets the eye, and their arc deserves a fair shake. Here’s my take: they’re not the numb, cold caricatures some make them out to be—they’re complex, grounded, and misunderstood, and I’ll break down why their story holds up better than the detractors claim.

That first train scene everyone points to as proof they’re ‘boring’? I see something different. They’re not disengaged or smug—they’re just comfortable. The stale biscuit chat and Hillary’s jab at Americans read like dry humor, not disdain. Paul flipping through yesterday’s paper isn’t him being checked out; it’s a guy relaxing after a trip. And Hillary nudging him about some story? That’s not desperation—it’s playful, like she’s teasing him to keep things lively. They’re not a lovey-dovey couple, sure, but they don’t have to be. They’re seasoned, not numb, and I’d argue that makes them relatable, not detached.

Then Alex crashes in, and yeah, they perk up—but it’s not because their lives are dull. She’s just genuinely interesting, and they’re human enough to notice. Paul’s amusement and Hillary’s curiosity don’t mean they’re clinging to her to feel alive; it’s a natural spark from meeting someone unexpected. [Side note: I rewatched that coffee scene too—Paul not jumping in right away isn’t him being cold. He’s cautious, not cowardly, and he does step up eventually. Not everyone’s an instant hero, and that’s okay.]

At the station, they’re not some disconnected duo either. Hillary pausing to check on Alex while Paul nudges her along? That’s not a rift—it’s her being compassionate and him being practical. His offer to help wasn’t fake; it felt real, like he saw a chance to step up. People say they only ‘came alive’ with Alex and Spencer’s story, but I don’t see them as breathless fanboys. They’re intrigued, sure, but too level-headed to lose themselves in it. Alex didn’t hijack their narrative—she just crossed their path, and they rolled with it.

Speaking of Alex, she was beat down by life—exhausted from fear, choices, and loss. But Hillary and Paul weren’t her saviors or some bored couple living vicariously. They offered her a steady moment, not a spotlight. They’re not fascinated by her so much as they’re decent people who can still connect. That’s not shallow—that’s depth the critics miss.

And the packing screw-ups and gas station scene? I’ll give you that they’re clumsy, but I chalk that up to the show’s pacing, not their characters. Hillary brushing off the attendant could be distraction, not arrogance—people act like it’s proof they’re naive, but I see it as a plot push, not a personality flaw. Their deaths, though? That’s where I part ways with the hate. They weren’t ‘poetic’ or deserved—they were random, almost forced. It didn’t scream ‘this is who they are.’ It felt like the writers needed them out, not like their arc earned it. 

Hillary and Paul weren’t naive or cold—they were real, caught off guard, and honestly, more human than the naysayers admit. What do you all think—am I onto something, or do you see them differently? Curious to hear your takes 🙏🏻",1,1743610276.0,1923Series,0,1.0,False

1jpsdk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1jpsdk2/does_anyone_else_thrive_when_travelling/,does anyone else thrive when travelling?,"so i love travelling. i love it. i feel so confident and energetic and relaxed when i'm going on a trip. everything just feels so much simpler. if i make a social blunder, then i'm just a silly tourist and i'll never see these people again. no one knows me; i'm just an anonymous person in a crowd, i can be anyone i want! i have 5 tops and 3 pairs of pants to choose from. everything i have to worry about fits in a bag or two. i can wander around, be in the sunlight, see new things, learn about history and people and places i never would have known about. 

i loved my one solo trip but i usually go with a friend and i fall into the leader role, the navigator, the one who decides things and while it's exhausting sometimes it just feels so liberating knowing i can do what i want, the possibilities seem endless, and if i don't want to do something i just ... don't have to. a lot of the time i can go off and do things on my own and i'm happy with that. i love navigating and figuring out metro systems and how cities are laid out. 

and then i come home and all the dread and anxiety and overwhelm hits me like a wall. i feel trapped, like there's no way out. i have to be in one place for 8 hours and i can't decide when to take a walk or eat lunch or have a break. i can't not drive in rush hour traffic. i can't decide the people i'm around or when i wake up or go to bed. and it's all the same, monotony, forever. even my body feels so screwed up. i was just away for 4 nights and i slept so well in the hotel and last night i slept in my own bed, and it took so long to get to sleep, and woke up 6-8 times in 6 hours. 

by no means is travel perfect, i get very anxious before i go and do a lot of research so i don't get lost and know how to use the metro. i get overwhelmed by crowds and like to take time to sit in a park or a coffee shop or a museum. but i can push past the sensory overload in ways i can't do at home, like the novelty and curiosity offsets the overwhelm. plus i love planes and trains and urban planning and transportation systems, it's a special interest of mine, so it's loud and chaotic but it's just. so cool to me. 

it's just. i can't go to the costco at home without feeling overwhelmed. i regularly have meltdowns coming home from work because it's Too Much. (i do never drive while travelling; i'd love to do a road trip  but my one big driving trip was so overwhelming and i am never doing that again.) but airports, even though most people find them super stressful, are a piece of cake. i can't stand unpredictability or deviation from plans in my daily life but if anything happens when i'm travelling then it's whatever, i can figure it out. (granted i've never had anything go seriously awry, thank god.) 

anyways, anyone else feel like their best self is their travel self?",1,1743610066.0,AuDHDWomen,0,1.0,False

She's from the same school and goes to the same gym as me, so we see eachother at least once every two days.

I texted her right after i met her and asked her out to get coffee, and she agreed. It went great and we spent like 4 hours together just chatting, visiting some shops, getting food etc. It went really well.

Then she was busy with school and work so we went out again after a month or so. Again, it went great. I really liked her vibe and at one point she even asked me if I like her, to which i obviously said yes. Then she asked me if it was a date to which I said ""I don't know, do you think this is a date?"" and she said ""I don't know!"" with a smile on her face. So i naturally told her that next time, it will be a date to which she just replied ""I don't have to wear high heels, right?"" in a good way. It all kind of ended there and we switched to a different topic.

That was about a month ago and we're supposed to go out again this Friday and she seems keen on going. I'm not sure if it is a date though - I want to bring her a single rose and I don't want to rush things or make her feel uncomfortable, so that's why I'm asking you guys. What do you think? Should I just ask her beforehand if it is a date? I feel like that's a bit pushy. Is the rose a good idea? Thanks for any help!",1,1743610027.0,dating,2,1.0,False

By Preston Dennett

A face-to-face confrontation with an extraterrestrial humanoid – it’s one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. It happens to a lot of people all over the world, and has been going on for a very long time. While many of our governments are now saying that UFOs are real, they still are saying nothing about firsthand humanoid contact cases. The question is why? Is it because humanoid encounters represent the forefront of UFO research and have volumes to teach us about this subject? Is it because these cases prove that we are not alone? This video presents ten astonishing cases of direct contact with humanoids of all kinds. These include multiple witness cases, some with compelling physical evidence pointing towards the reality of the experience. Now is the time for truth and transparency with this subject!

A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE. It was 10am one summer morning in 1948 when Ernst-August R. was watching his sheep-herd in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Without warning, all his sheep scattered, and a large saucer-shaped craft landed in the field next to him. Ernst watched it for several moments, and when nothing happened, he approached it, then reached out and touched it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange humanoids in jumpsuits and helmets. The beings spoke a strange language then returned into their craft which took off. Afterward, Ernst found burned patches of ground where the craft had rested.

A VERY LOUD UFO. One afternoon in July of 1960, railroad worker Georges Godbout and two others were working on the Canadian National Railroad near Chapais, Quebec, Canada when a top-shaped metallic craft appeared over the tracks. It moved towards them, stopped andthen  a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit came out from beneath it. He started to look around, but spotting the witnesses, it quickly climbed back into the craft. As the UFO moved off, it made such a loud noise that the three men became physically ill and had to stop work for the day.

SPRAYED BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 30, 1971, eleven-year-old Anssi Hakala had attended a cousin’s birthday party, and was bicycling along a forested road back to his home in rural Marttila, Finland. Suddenly a tall greenish humanoid figure appeared, floating above his head. And following him. Anssi biked away in fear. The being quickly disappeared into a craft, and the craft now began to pace Anssi on his bike. As it hovered over Anssi’s head, it sprayed him with a weird liquid which caused a tickling sensation. Anssi returned home nearly frantic with fear.

THE LAUGHING ALIENS. At 5:30 pm on September 27, 1973, Antoine X (a mechanic) went out to the rural area near his home in Bedarrides, France to pick some edible mushroom near his home. Bending down to pick some mushrooms, he observed what first believed to be two small children. But he changed his mind when he saw that they wore beige jumpsuits, had very fine features and looked identical. Antoine called out to them, but they laughed and disappeared into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted silently away. Skeptical of UFOs, Antoine wondered if they might have been Chinese spies.

UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP. At 9:30 pm on February 3, 1977, a group of children from a youth camp by Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia noticed a silver flying saucer hovering at treetop level. Lights blinked around the perimeter. A light flashed on the bottom of the craft, and also on the top of the dome. There were several portholes around the edge, and through one of the portholes, the kids saw a strange humanoid with a very lage head looking down at them. The craft accelerated rapidly away and was gone.

UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. At 6:30 pm, Frank Sverre Mandte and Johnny Myrr (two eleven-year-old deaf boys) were walking up to the Alm’s School near Honefoss, Norway. Simultaneously they both noticed a glowing orange object just above the nearby treeline. Seconds later, it glided towards them, stopped, and landed a short distance away. They could now see a weird humanoid looking out at them from one of the portholes The craft took off, leaving behind unmistakable landing traces in the field.

ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE. Just before 10:00 pm on the night of August 31, 1978, at the same time as a power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias were amazed to see a solid, oval-shaped craft with portholes hovering near their farm. After moving around the area, it then ejected two figures with glowing red eyes who floated a few inches above the ground, approaching the farm. The two figures circled around their sheds, seeming to inspect the farm. They remained on the property for nearly an hour before finally leaving. It was one of more than twenty encounters in the area both before and after this event.

CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. At 7:40 pm on September 21, 1978, an unnamed boy was walking through a construction site near his home in Cosenza, Italy when the landscape around him lit up like daylight. As the light faded, he saw a craft sitting on a hill a short distance away. On top of it stood a strange humanoid figure. Suddenly he saw four humanoids bounding towards him. He ran, tripped and fainted. When he awoke, he was surrounded by four humanoids. He jumped up and tried to fight them, but fainted again. When he awoke, they were gone. He noticed that the house next door had lost power.

AN ALIEN IN THE YARD. At 10pm on November 24, 1988, Rune Asplund sat in the kitchen of his home in Daviken, Sweden drinking coffee, when he noticed a very weird-looking, short figure in his yard. The figure stood with legs spread wide and arms outstretched. It wore a shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going outside to investigate this strange figure, Rune watched as it disappeared into thin air. Rune later learned a police officer was stopped in his car as a UFO flew over him not far away and on the same night. Also, one year earlier, Rune’s neighbor said that he observed a short humanoid outside his home, which also disappeared into thin air.

PLEASE TELL ME I’M NOT CRAZY. It was 1:30 am one evening in the summer of 1999 and a fourteen-year-old girl was in the second story bedroom of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Suddenly, sheard a deafening screeching noise right outside her window. Looking outside, she saw a very weird-looking, three-foot-tall creature with grayish skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother also heard the scream, ran into the bedroom, and saw the creature. The creature remained for fifteen minutes before finally leaving. But it would soon return.

These ten amazing humanoid encounters show how truly strange face-to-face contact can be. And these ten accounts are only a tiny portion of the huge number of documented cases on record. So many cases. So many kinds of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is over. We are not alone!

Well that week came and went. I never heard from her. After a week I thought, “Well, let me text her”

I asked how her trip was and what her availability was for the week. She then mentioned she was going to see family this week but countered for next week. I then suggested next Saturday at 7:00. Her response “Sounds good”

1jpsa1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/dui/comments/1jpsa1u/it_gets_better/,It gets better,"I got arrested for DUI in WA state a year ago this week. My DUI was a single vehicle accident, in which I totaled my own vehicle. I was put on a psychiatric hold as a disposition of my arrest rather than being taken to jail and released from the hold the following day.  I refused to comply with officers, refused field tests and station tests.  I made them get a warrant for my blood draw and honestly got a bit unruly. 

The depression and hopelessness I felt after was a dark time for me. I woke up every day feeling like I had been hit in the gut, filled with worry, guilt, self-loathing. 
I currently have a Smart Start IID installed as ordered by the DOL, a condition of being able to drive while my license is suspended for refusal of tests. I dreaded getting the IID, worrying what others would think if they saw my device. That has passed mostly. I park in the back of the lot at work and avoid driving other people or going to drive through coffee and such—and honestly have made myself stop caring what other people think for preservation of peace. The IID is expensive, the SR22 is expensive, my car insurance is astronomical. Honestly I just keep telling myself it could be worse and try to live in gratitude and use this as a lesson learned. (Whoever reviews my camera for my IID if that happens is probably appalled lol, some days crying driving down the road, some days happy and singing, some days vaping my drive away). 
I took the classes my lawyer recommended that court would want to see, got a drug and alcohol evaluation done. Paid my lawyer our agreed upon amount. 
I spent a lot of time worrying about losing my security clearance at work. My security officer was surprisingly kind and assured me people make mistakes and to stay out of trouble. Still TBD since I haven’t been charged with anything at this time, but this worry has mostly passed. 
The point of this post is that while I am still playing the waiting game of charges being filed (in WA charges can be filled up to 2 years from date of arrest), a lot of the negative emotions and hopelessness I felt for a long time after has faded.  

Hang in there if you are experiencing the same. Take every day as it comes, take a deep breath, be patient and kind to yourself. This type of thing may change your life but it doesn’t define who you are as a person, it’s just a part of your story. We all have the choice to decide what we will bring to the next chapter.

1jps9zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DawnDeLaLuz/comments/1jps9zw/the_tools_dont_make_the_bruja/,The Tools Don’t Make the Bruja,"Some people think if they don’t have the fanciest tarot deck, the right herbs, or some expensive-ass candle, they can’t do the work. But let’s be real—our ancestors made miracles with nothing but faith and a prayer.

My mama (abuela) didn’t need a metaphysical shop—she had a cup of water, a rosary, and prayers that could move mountains. My tía didn’t have a $40 bundle of sage—she swept out bad spirits with a broom, some cascarilla, and a few well-placed words. So when people ask me, “Do I need a certain candle for this spell?” or “What if I don’t have crystals?” I tell them the same thing: Your power ain’t in the tools. It’s in you.

Think about music—if you hand a cheap microphone to a real singer, they’ll still make magic. But give the most expensive studio to someone with no soul, and it’ll still sound empty. Same with spirituality.

Your words? That’s a spell.
Your hands? They move energy.
Your intention? That’s the real magic.

You don’t need a $50 candle from Etsy or $20 Palo Santo sticks from the Forrest’s of Peru to cleanse your space. If your spirit is strong enough, a cup of water and a prayer will shift the whole energy in your home. You don’t need the “right” tarot deck to read. You could do divination with playing cards, coffee grounds, or even a candle flame. The magic ain’t in the objects—it’s in the one using them. So stop waiting until you have the “perfect setup.” You already have everything you need. It’s been in you this whole time.

Your power doesn’t come from a store, a book, or a teacher—it comes from YOU. It’s in your blood, your instincts, your connection to your ancestors and spirit. The sooner you stop waiting for permission, the sooner you’ll step into your full power.

You been chosen.
You been worthy.
You just gotta believe it.

The agreement had been for the switch to occur just before the group went out for the gas station. That was why Will had to get all pertinent information before returning to the rest.

“Nothing major,” the copy continued. “Jace was just curious how much he knew about challenges.”

That was a good question. There was a good chance that the former rogue knew a lot more than he said. Given how rare it was to obtain permanent skills, Will strongly doubted that he had gotten them through wolf pack rewards, regardless of how many loops he had been through.

“What did the others say?” he asked.

“Nothing. They changed the topic to the other party.”

So far, so good, it meant that there would be fewer things to remember.

“Anything else?” Will looked at his copy.

“Nope.” The other shook his head.

Now came the awkward part. Will knew that the entity was just a fake image of himself, but killing it just like that didn’t feel right.

The comment made Will stop mid step. What was “lit” about that? Could it be that Alex suspected something? Unwilling to open the topic, the boy quickly continued walking down the corridor towards the exit.

“Err, bro, need a favor,” Alex whispered, then looked around. “For real.”

Will glanced at him.

“I want to enter the goblin realm,” the goofball added.

“That’s a bad idea.”

“For real, bro?” The disappointment in Alex’s voice was palpable.

“It’s not safe. I was lucky that the martial artist agreed to join forces while we were there. If you go alone...” he didn’t finish the sentence. “By the way, he said that he knew Danny,” Will added in a lower voice.

“For real?” Alex seemed genuinely surprised. “Well, he’s been going through loops for eternity.”

“Have you seen him?”

The pause was longer than expected.

“Nah.” The goofball shook his head. “Heard of him, but never seen.”

If that was a lie, it was the sloppiest one Will had witnessed coming from his friend. It was almost as if the thief was baiting him to ask more questions. Right now wasn’t the time, though.

The two left the building discussing pros and cons of going on a side quest. To everyone else, it seemed as if they were talking about an obscure computer game. With time to spare, and the other two members of the party off somewhere, the duo went to have a bite at the usual coffee shop. The barista questioned them about school, as usual, then agreed to sell them some hot cocoa and chocolate mousse.

Will took a few bites, but his heart wasn’t in it. It wasn’t so much that he had gotten tired of mousse, but rather that he was going through strategies in his mind. Getting the squire sounded like a hit-or-miss mission. One way or another, it would be over fast. That would leave him enough time to try the rogue’s quest as well, possibly in the very same loop.

Knowing the rest of the party, they hardly would have anything against it. There was every chance that they would want to go through their own solo class challenges as well.

Will took out his mirror fragment and went to the message board. A large number of comments had popped up, but all of them required coin payment to be read. Apparently, that was some sort of advanced feature that Will’s group didn’t have access to yet.

A few more comments had stacked up on the post Helen had made—mostly further insults and “advice” to give up. Considering the supposed small number of participants, the place was rather active. At some point, Will might start posting more as well, but only once he was certain there was nothing better he could do with his coins.

“Has archer gone on challenges?” Will asked.

“No clue, bro.” Alex shrugged. “Archer is his own thing.”

In other words, he was very much like Danny.

“Why didn’t he get along with us?”

“Ooof… it’s complicated, bro. Danny went into his territory uninvited. Archer didn’t like that.”

No way that was everything. The fury with which the archer attacked members of the school, even before they had started the tutorial, made it feel personal. Could it be that Danny had betrayed the other? It wouldn’t be out of character. Or was it the opposite? There was a non-zero chance that the archer had been the one who killed the rogue.

“He hasn’t tried to harm us since the tutorial.”

“You want him to, bro?” Alex’s tone suddenly hardened.

“So, no chance he could have joined a party? He had to get his skills from somewhere.”

Before Alex could come up with a response, the door of the coffee shop opened. The small space and the lack of customers made it sound a lot louder than it actually was.

“Ready?” Jace asked, with a heavy backpack on each shoulder.

“Bro!” Alex waved, as if the previous conversation had never taken place. “You gotta try—“

“Hel’s waiting.” The jock didn’t even bother listening, walking directly to Will. “If we’re doing this, we better do it fast.”

With a nod, Will left all the cash he had on the table, then left. The amount of uneaten food was enough to make the barista offer to pack it for home, but not enough to have him persist. On their part, the looped didn’t care. It wasn’t like they’d lose anything. Once the loop came to an end, they’d start with the exact things they had every loop, plus all new permanent items, of course.

Jace handed a backpack to Alex. The crunching sound made it clear that it was full of broken mirrors. Seemed like Will’s talk in the morning had affected everyone. They were aware of the degree to which they were outmatched, and also competitive enough to give everything they got for a victory.

There was no sign of the other party once Will and the others arrived at the gas station. The known two members of the competition weren’t in the queue inside, nor anywhere in the vicinity. A part of Will’s mind hoped that the others had decided to skip a loop, but even he knew that it was too good to be true.

“You took your time,” Helen said in general, though she was looking at Will. “Ready to go?”

Will looked about.

“Biker chick is on the roof of the building further down,” Alex said. “Can’t find the rest, though.”

That went beyond simple mirror clones. The goofball had a skill that let him spy on others from a distance; something he hadn’t shared so far. The question was how often had he used it on Will.

“Challenge is still active.” Helen checked her mirror fragment. “So, they haven’t completed it.”

“They’re letting us have a go,” Will said. “They haven’t figured out how to tackle it, so are watching what we’ll do.”

As logical as that sounded, Will had a bad feeling on the matter. There was no way they hadn’t spotted Jace or a moose riding goblin rushing through the streets.

“We go as planned,” the boy whispered.

The idea was for them to split up. That way, it would seem as if they were circling the gas station, but in truth, they were taking a completely different approach. Will, Alex, and Helen were close enough so they could all charge at the squire should he appear at the same spot. As for Jace, he was merely a distraction; besides, his skills remained the most useless in direct combat.

One by one, the members of the group got into position. Then the waiting game started. The first ten minutes everyone was tensely looking about, trying to spot more of their competitors. Under such circumstances, anything slightly out of place was viewed as suspect.

A group of tourists was quickly dubbed a potential threat. None of the party remembered seeing them before, although there was no guarantee they weren’t a frequent occurrence within the general loop. Another ten minutes later, boredom crept in.

Will’s phone pinged, as an hourglass emoticon was sent into the general channel. It was soon followed by two sleeping emoticons. As much as Will didn’t like the distraction, he agreed with the sentiment. Both groups were playing a game of cat and mouse with neither willing to make the first move.

“I can do it, bro,” a voice whispered as Alex appeared next to Will. “For real.”

The goofball’s desire to enter the goblin realm was obvious.

“Someone has to,” he continued. “Things won’t start without it.”

“They’ll go for it,” Will said, even if he wasn’t at all convinced. “They did so twice.”

“Nah, bro. Was us each time.”

“Why do you want to go in? There’s nothing but goblins there.”

“Want to check something out, bro. Chill, no one will notice. I’ll still help out here.”

That was an interesting philosophical riddle. If Alex entered another realm, would his mirror copies still function?

“I know you didn’t share everything, bro. And I don’t care. Just give me the okay.”

“If you’re so determined, why ask for an okay?”

“Because you’re team lead, bro.” The sincerity in the goofball’s voice seemed genuine. “Just say no and I’ll drop it. I really want to go in there, though.”

The cynical part of Will’s mind saw this as a form of threat or blackmail. If there was anyone who knew more about his secrets, it was Alex. To make matters worse, there was no telling exactly how much he knew.

“You’ll start the challenge, right?” Will relented.

“For real, bro!”

“And you’ll tell me if anything unusual happens in there?”

“Sure thing!”

Now, it was clear that the thief was lying.

“Go for it.”

Alex smiled, then spontaneously shattered into fragments. Just as Will suspected, that had been a mirror copy. The real goofball had been elsewhere the entire time.

Screams and yells erupted from the gas station, audible despite the increasing traffic outside. The challenge had just started.

“Shit!” Will focused on the spot on the wall Jace had told him of.

If the jock’s information was accurate, a mirror was supposed to appear there. It didn’t. Instead, the entire surface shimmered and rippled as if it had become liquid.

A moose with enormous horns emerged, carrying a colorfully dressed goblin. There could be no mistake that was the goal of the quest. The “squire” was more like a jester wearing a green shirt, red pants, and a vest composed of a patchwork of designs, possibly each of them a coat of arms. There was nothing dignified or menacing about the creature. If anything, the goblin stuck out like a sore thumb.

“Go!” Will shouted, leaping in the direction of his prey.

At that exact moment, the squire’s head turned in his direction. For a moment of time, the two’s glances matched. A bizarre feeling went through Will. It was as if the squire was surprised that he had been seen.

Come to think of it, everyone’s attention remained focused on the other side of the gas station. All the shouts, screams, and honking were coming from there, while not a single person appeared to be bothered by a giant moose standing on the side of the road.

“No one can see you,” Will realized. “No one except the person looking straight at you.”

People rushed by the massive creature, hurrying to see what the commotion elsewhere was. Moments later. A boar rider smashed out of the gas station, ramming into a nearby car.

Gritting his teeth, Will kept running forward. There was one other thing he had realized. Of all the looped observing the gas station, he was the only one to have reacted it.

The agreement had been for the switch to occur just before the group went out for the gas station. That was why Will had to get all pertinent information before returning to the rest.

“Nothing major,” the copy continued. “Jace was just curious how much he knew about challenges.”

That was a good question. There was a good chance that the former rogue knew a lot more than he said. Given how rare it was to obtain permanent skills, Will strongly doubted that he had gotten them through wolf pack rewards, regardless of how many loops he had been through.

“What did the others say?” he asked.

“Nothing. They changed the topic to the other party.”

So far, so good, it meant that there would be fewer things to remember.

“Anything else?” Will looked at his copy.

“Nope.” The other shook his head.

Now came the awkward part. Will knew that the entity was just a fake image of himself, but killing it just like that didn’t feel right. Pushing through his internal reluctance, he hit the copy on the shoulder, causing it to shatter before his very eyes. For several seconds, he kept on staring at the empty space where it had been before finally leaving the bathroom.

To no one’s surprise, Alex was in the corridor, waiting.

“Ready, bro?” the goofball asked.

“Yeah.” Will walked past him. “I needed to clear my thoughts.”

1jps2vh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jps2vh/cluster_headache_adhd_horrible_lifestyle_in_my/,"Cluster headache, Adhd, horrible lifestyle in my 20s - how f‘d am i?","M32, 6‘1, 190lbs. 

I am having a general check up in about a month but I wanted to ask here in advance for a general check up on how fucked I am in terms of general health. I am just a little worried that I‘ll die in my 30s due to my lifestyle in my 20s and the meds I‘m taking. Really need a reality check and some honest opinions. I‘ll try to keep it brief. 

I was diagnosed with episodic cluster headache when I was 18. On average I had 2 cycles a year, each one around 3 months with one or two attacks a day. Without medication, my attacks always last a full 3 hours. I cannot describe the pain. There is nothing like it. Every single attack without treatment is a surreal experience. In the past couple of years the frequency of attacks during a cluster phase has drastically increased to 4-6 attacks a day. 

Thankfully almost all medication works really well for me. My old neurologist wasn‘t a fan of what I now know to be the standard treatment and just prescribed sumatriptane inject that I took for every single attack. Given I only paid 10€ for 6 pens in germany it was an ok solution. No side effects, 100% reliable to end an attack within 5-15 minutes. If I had to guess I‘d say I took around 100 pens a year so maybe a bit short of 1000 pens of sumatriptan 6mg inject from ages 18-30. 

Switched my neuro a couple years ago to a specialist for cluster headache, he has me on the standard therapy. High dosage of oral cortisone for 2 weeks at the start of a cluster phase to put the phase to a stop. Starting at 100mg a day and every 2-3 days I reduce the dosage by 20 mg. During this time I start taking verapamil that does its magic after around 1-2 weeks. 2x120mg a day for 6-12 weeks leave me with almost no attacks. If anything comes through, I have sumatriptan pens. 

ECG and blood tests done every cycle, all fine. 

During my 20s i consumed lots of energy drinks. 1-2 red bull (250ml) a day. Bad habit from back when it seemed to help with cluster headache, before I was diagnosed. Copious amounts seemed to bring some relief, a strange phenomenon however reported by many. Stopped around 1 year ago. Coffee only now, in small amounts. 

I also took a lot of ibuprufen and other pain medications in my 20s. Was depressed a couple years, had strong regular headaches 3-4 times a week, always took pain medications. Small doses (400s), but on a very regular basis. 

I went to the gym maybe 2-3 times a week on average. Often half assed a training, but it was enough to keep in shape. Basic weight lifting, deadlifts, squats, bench, nothing fancy, just progressive overload.

At 29 I had a pulmonary embolism out of the blue. Couple weeks before my exams, friday night, after a couple days of weird pain when I took deep breaths (I assumed it was some muscular stuff from the gym) all of a sudden I could not breath anymore and immediately a a very primal fear of death set in that I have never experienced before. Thankfully an ambulance was just around the corner. Blood test in the hospital showed D-dimer way over 2000ng/ml and a CT confirmed the embolism. Took blood thinners for a year, lots of blood tests, checkups, mrt scans, no cause has been identified and the blood results went back to normal after around 6-12 months. 

 My sleep in my 20s was fucked. I‘m not even sure if I slept a lot or not. If I had to guess I‘d say on average maybe 5-6 hours. At least once a month I did not sleep at all for a night, trying to „fix my schedule“ or whatever bullshit reason there was. 

Recently I have been diagnosed with adhd. Looking back at my life this explains a lot. 70mg of vyvanse a day. Regular blood tests are fine as is the ECG. My schedule is mostly fixed, I get work done during the day instead of at night like in my 20s, I sleep better, I eat better, I feel like a normal human being for the first time in my life. I have never been better. 

However the past 2 weeks have been troubling. Another cluster phase is here and my neurologist wasn‘t available and then I wasn‘t. So I took cortison that I had left over, that wasn‘t working too well so I took naratriptan to prevent attacks. 2.5mg twice a day prevent most of the attacks. Had no access to it during my vacation last week, so I bought some zolmitriptan 2.5mg that I took 4x a day. Praying that I can visit my neurologist tomorrow.

Given this history - how fucked am I, on a general level and also right now? 

My cluster headache lead to me not knowing, caring or taking seriously the possible side effects of triptanes. I‘ve taken spicy amounts of different triptanes throughout the last two weeks, sometimes 2 naratriptanes as well as one or two zolmitriptanes a day, maybe, I don‘t even know because triptanes have historically been my lifesaver. Years of taking copious amounts without any sides at all as far I am aware left me with zero care for dangers. I need someone to take a couple minutes, read my word salad and tell me to my face if I‘m a fucking idiot. Ever since taking vyvanse I developed something like an ability to make plans for the future and not just live in the moment so if all this seems stupid to you please know this is the first time in my life that I am actually thinking about future potential health risks for myself. I don‘t even know how I got to this point without dying tbh.

Thanks for anyone who took the time.

We have a coffee shop/brewery right next to the trail so I thought I’d have that be a pre- or post-run spot to hang… but I also wonder if the association/affiliation w this spot could be problematic in some way…

Cravings hit + day dreaming about Kratom and feeling LAZY.......help!,"I am proud of myself for going 4 1/2 weeks without kratom! I was hoping it would get easier and easier. But this last week I have found myself wanting it more and more. I also stopped doing nicotine (6 weeks in) and I had some sugar cravings that were so hard to control the first few weeks! I have gained about 4 Pds now. Yuck. I am now trying to lose the extra weight and get serious about fitness again now that the bulk of the detox from niccotine and kratom is over and it is HARD. My cravings for kratom hit when I want to do an intense workout as it GAVE ME SO MUCH ENERGY! Green or white did (never did the red before working out or in general). Coffee does not have the same effect. I am trying to enjoy working out ""sober"" as kratom gave me SUCH A HIGH I could workout for hours at times. Literally. But of course kratom has stopped working and the negative side is why I am stopping. The anxiety, paranoia and desire to isolate. So I am writing this post to say I am mentally struggling right now and any advice or feedback you have or just support would be great esp if you used kratom to stay fit. I am telling myself to workout anyway. Keep lifting weights. Keep getting outside (I am learning to mountain bike). Keep climbing (I rock climb indoors a few times month). Keep doing yoga (I do this often). Keep going on walks with the dog. But I probably won't feel like working out for hours now and that means I need to eat a clean diet. I just miss that RUSH that kratom gave me. I wonder if this is what speed feels like?  Life feels so slow and workouts take forever now. I feel distracted while I workout now and just want to stop. It sucks. I feel LAZY.  I use to workout without kratom but I was using ephedrine back in the day when it was legal. I dunno. I like the high from uppers but I hate the come down. Of course I am now researching other things I can do to give me a ""high"" like kratom did but this is a bad idea - another addiction is the last thing I need.

(Btw ik there’s probably a learning curve to espresso making but I’m good at learning new things!) 

These are used off Facebook marketplace, both $180. From my research I feel like I hear better things about the classic. The thing is from the listings the classic looks…kind of grimey and there’s not much info about it. The baby twin on the other hand looks very nice and clean and it says it has been serviced and cleaned recently and comes with a 6 mo warranty. He gives a huge description and info about the machine so I feel it may be in better condition. They’re the same price so…idk thoughts?

There is also a Breville Bambino for $250 which I KNOW is what everyone suggests, but I’d rather not pay that much, the $180 is kind of already pushing it.

1jprwrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jprwrt/does_this_sound_like_abuse/,does this sound like abuse?,"for context, i have spoken with both my mum and my best friend and both of them have been adamant that he was abusive towards me and have been trying to lead me to that conclusion. they have been great, very stern but gentle. BUT they are very biased and protective over me so i really need reassurance.

me and my ex recently broke up, he called it off with me because i ""cheated"". i didn't cheat on him, but i did lie about seeing a male friend of mine behind his back. i have screenshots of said friend confirming that we never slept together and were only friends but my ex refused to look at them. i am at university/college and this friend was the only friend i had made on my course. he had asked me out earlier in the academic year and i had turned him down, he didn't take it very well but i continued to turn him down and eventually we agreed to be friends. i never told my ex about this and i did lie about spending time with him. if i had anyone else i probably would have distanced myself but this friend was the only friend i had at university. i did lie and recognise that was wrong. my mum is telling me that i should be gentle with myself and if i was in a happy and safe relationship i wouldn't have had to lie about having a friend and i should consider myself lucky it ended when it did. my best friend tells me that i don't owe my abuser anything, not honesty, not loyalty, nothing and even if i had cheated his behaviour is unacceptable.

it has really been weighing on me however because basically everyone my ex knows has shunned me (unadded me on everything, ignores me when they see me etc etc), he has been approaching my flatmates and acquaintances and telling them i slept with 100's of people behind his back, and i had an affair. he accused me of sleeping with basically everyone i have ever interacted with and had accepted that as fact because i lied to him about my friend. i apologised of course, and i would be willing to accept the consequences of lying if that was what i was being accused of but it isn't. 

i know this is really long and im sorry for asking for validation, but i just really need someone who isn't close to me to read this and tell me that this isn't healthy. i recognise my own mistakes but i don't think what i did is any worse than the things he did


here are some examples off the top of my head:

1) he would constantly make fun of me for being lower class even though i grew up caring for my mother who is disabled and can't work. he would say stuff like ""you have a really working class accent."" ""how are you so poor?"" ""you're a fucking chav.""

2) he would tell me i was ""too heavy"" for stuff or that i was ""too fat"" to pick up, when he knew that i had suffered with an eating disorder. i am 55lbs and a healthy weight for my height. he is 6'5 and is a pretty big guy and could pretty easily pick me up most of the time. but other times i would be too fat?

3) most of the time he would be really encouraging of my work, but he also told me i was stupid a lot and that i was untalented

4) he would makes jokes about how i look saying i looked like a maggot, a cancer victim, a meth addict, like a grandma (not in an endearing way). BUT he would also tell me i was beautiful a lot, and was very paranoid about other people thinking i was pretty ----> he would get upset if he told someone i was his girlfriend and they were like oh she's gorgeous or like well done.

5) he would constantly accuse me of stuff, like cheating on him, trying to poison him (if i baked for him he'd make someone else eat it first so if it was poisoned he wouldn't die), he would assume that like everything i posted on social media was about him (in a negative way) or was some sort of cryptic way of me saying i was evil. 
one time he said we needed to talk, and then when i went to his place he sat on the edge of his bed and like tapped his foot and he wouldn't talk to me or look at me. and he kept being like oh i can't even look at you right now, like im so angry. i tried comforting him but he shrugged me off, after like 30 minutes of that he made me leave the room because he was so angry with me. and then messaged me asking if i was cheating on him, i said no, and then he went back to normal. i said he made me feel really anxious doing that, and he said he had just convinced himself i had cheated on him and was so sure it was true that he thought i deserved that treatment.

6) would call me a whore, slut, bop. would say stuff like ""cover up you slag."" 

7) he would put me down by saying i was boring for not always wearing lingerie, that kissing me was boring, that i don't turn him on. generally acting as if like i owed him more ? even though i never got off once and he got off every time

8) he was generally very rough and heavy handed with me, he would accidentally hurt me a lot. like he bruised both of my wrists by yanking on them repeatedly to like move me. he'd kick up his knees when i was straddling him in bed so that i would fly forward and i almost always would smack my head off the windowsill. he broke multiple items of clothing by groping me too roughly or like forcing his hand under my shirt to touch me even if the fabric was tight. he's pushed me the ground multiple times, saying it was funny how bad my balance was. he punched my arm really hard and it bruised, he once reenacted a wrestling move on me but he didn't know what he was doing so hit my jugular really hard and continued to strangle me even after i was coughing and struggling to breathe.   he would always apologise if i cried or like got really hurt. once i broke down in tears and was like why do you always have to be so rough with me, and he seemed genuinely remorseful. but also he never stopped being so rough.

9) he would ask me if he could take my shirt off or to do something sexual and if i said no, then he would respect that but then ask again like 10 minutes later. sometimes he wouldn't ask at all and he would just removed a piece of clothing mid conversation or pull down my shirt /bra. sometimes even in a communal area, like my flat kitchen, no one ever walked in but the could have. he would say things like ""i only care about touching your boobs."" 

10) he once kissed his  friend in front of me as a ""joke"", he told me even though he knew it was hypocritical, he said that like if he saw me in the street walking with a man he would be very angry and would assume i was cheating BUT he was allowed to hang out with his female friends one on one (grabbing coffee, going on walks, going to parks etc) ----> to preface i don't care about him having female friends , it was just the fact that like he didn't think i should be allowed to be around men one on one, but he could be around women.

11) one time someone complimented me on instagram dms and i told him, and he started aggressively cursing and threw his wallet across the room and was like storming around the room whilst getting increasingly more angry. i told him that he really frightened me when he did that, and that he wasn't scaring off the guy who hit on me he was just scaring me. he did apologise but after that point i always felt hesitant to see him if i thought he was angry at me because he was very intimidating.

12) one time he came over and i can't remember if i was drunk or very sleepy, but i was in that doozy state when you're really really tired and you're like struggling to keep your eyes open. i told him i didn't want to have sex, and that i was very tired. i was actively falling asleep like my eyes were shut, and he started fingering me and trying to touch me. and i thought like oh maybe if i just pretend to be asleep he'll stop, so i tried to like breathe how you do when you're asleep like long and slow and i kept my eyes closed. and it just continued. granted it didn't go further and he did eventually leave. i didn't say no explicitly, but i do think that like if someone has their eyes shut, isn't reacting at all and has already said they're tired and don't want to have sex, that should be enough.

13) he said he hated me when i said i didn't want to have sex because i was on my period. but then later said it was a joke

14) if we went on a night out, he would always get upset with me for talking to other people or not spending enough time with him. even though i would always go home with him at the end of the night me and would only ever be talking to our mutual friends or other women.

15) he asked me to be his girlfriend the second time we ever hung out and i said that it was a bit fast for me, he asked me again a couple weeks later and i said no, again saying that it was too fast for me. i told him that i wasn't interested in being with anyone else, but i don't want to rush so i would ask him out when i was ready and i would try to make it special. he then sort of forced my hand? because he told me that he had started telling his friends we were together and his family, and i was like well if everyone thinks we're boyfriend and girlfriend we are. so i ended up asking him later that week.

16) one time he intentionally tried to make me cry but talking about baby bunnies dying in really gruesome and horrible ways

17) after we broke up i tried to talk to him about some of this stuff because i wanted idk acknowledged for it. i wrote him a letter and he didn't say anything so i asked about it and i mentioned some of the stuff that he'd done and he replied ""😭😭😭"". and i blocked him. i then tried to talk about it again, and his response to was you know i don't care about you right like i couldn't care less about you, you deserve to suffer, i don't know why im even talking to you.  he told me that he hadn't done anything to me and i was just twisting the narrative to try to excuse my actions.  i said to him that i don't even care if he does think i cheated, i just want him to acknowledge the things he's done to me. i have apologised about lying and i have been very open about the things i have been untruthful about.

on the other hand he was very affectionate, he would always sing my praise to his friends, he would buy me gifts and compliment me a lot. he could be so sweet and everyone would always tell me about how much he liked me. he would pay for things for me, and i never really thought anything he did was malicious, which is why i stayed. he always seemed sorry when i confronted him. most of the time it was fine. i want to believe the really bad stuff is partially my fault for not setting better boundaries. i just wish he would talk to me so he could explain it idk. i understand this relationship ending is for the best, but i wish it had ended on my terms

1jprnxj,https://i.redd.it/bk0w9xsoyfse1.jpeg,Encounters of the Booty Snatchers,"Last night I had an experience that one can only get from Reforger. 

Since 1.3 dropped, I haven’t had too much time to play and wanted to test how quickly I could rank up to access weapons and vehicles. I played 2 matches, first from start and the second one ongoing. 

During the second match I joined in on the Soviet side. US already had 4 of the major Caps completed and cut off Soviet bases so we were down to 2. Seeing as the match was already over, I attempted a Hail Mary of driving a UAZ from Lementin towards Military Hospital to try and take it back before the win timer started after US captured Mil Base Levie. 

Driving out of the Northern side of Lementin toward Villeneuve I cross a small bridge and spotted a small vehicle up the road maybe 200 meters. 

“Ah cmon… please don’t be U- ahh fuck”

It was a US Jeep loaded with 3 naked Americans. Assuming they were going to ram me and blow us both up I swerved left to get out of the way while honking. Over Proxy Chat I hear giggling as they veer their jeep off to the right into the ditch and through the bushes. 

At this point I’m thinking it’s the end of the match, screw it. Let’s go boys 3 v 1 I will try my best.

I turn my UAZ to face them down the road, hop out and take cover behind. As soon as I’m about 5 meters behind the UAZ trying to set up for a shot they hit my UAZ direct with the LAW, instantly setting it on fire. I peek to the right and acquire one Naked American 150m off and take a lucky pop shot towards him intending to suppress: it’s a headshot. He’s dead. 

During this, I heard one of the other Nakey Jakeys closing the distance giggling over proxy chat. After he realizes I killed his friend he starts screaming in agony over his loss. I’m screaming back. LET ME LIVE I WANT TO SEE MY FAMILY I say. He responds.

“C’mere Ruskie I’m gonna get that Booty! Hehehehehe!”

STAY AWAY FROM MY BUTT I respond while praying to Gorbachev. I swap to full auto and spray. He approaches even closer trying to beat me into submission. I’m down half a mag poking holes into the nearby shrubbery. I pedal back trying to reacquire when I get him in my sights and fire again. Center of mass. He’s down, still giggling maniacally as I put him out of his misery. 

At this point my UAZ has blown up, I have no ride, and my mission is still to try and stop the timer from starting. I move down the road towards the embankment near the bridge where I saw their jeep pull off hoping it was still operational. I knew there was at least one greased up slippery American still hiding in the bushes so I approached cautiously. I located their jeep when I see the distinct color of pink flesh pop out of the culvert. I already had my rifle ready so I sent another burst of 5.45 into his perfectly moisturized chest. He’s down but not out.

I walk over to his corpse unable to stifle my own laughter. I see he’s unconscious and able to hear me, so I tell him thank you for the hilarious encounter but it’s pokey pokey time and their jeep is mine. 

I went pedal to the metal trying to reach MilHos but my efforts were in vain. I pulled over to talk on the world chat asking who were the Bare Assed Booty Snatchers I bested by the ditch. We sent a few messages back and forth before the match ended and prayed that Soviet command would commend my efforts despite losing Everon to the Dirty Capitalists.

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Just started growing some herbs to put in the tea.

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. 

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite, ASE and CS2. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago. I also have a switch that I play pokemon and mario games mainly on. Just got a steam deck, too, and been tinkering around with it.

Or....14 Days after E-day!,"If someone would have told me 3 month ago that there will be a time in my life where I'm happy to have a dentist, where I'm happy when my dentist calls me for a check up, where the desk lady at my dentist calls me by my first name when I enter the praxis...I would have laughed!

But here I am!

2 weeks after E-Day and while I'm writing these lines, I am smiling like I haven't smiled in a long time!

Gosh, the two last weeks have been an emotional roller coaster! Deluxe! Two weeks ago around this time,17:00 ish I was cooling down my cheeks, spitting blood and trying to have some coffee...I suffered from pain, nausea...

And now, two weeks later? I have now idea how many times I was close to cry! But not because of pain, or shame or all of these old emotions! No, quiet the opposite!

I can eat again, I can chew again! Yesterday I made myself some silly bruschetta, you know, these oven baked slices of baguette, topped with a mix of tomato cubes, garlic olive oil, basil! Now idea when had them the last time but I can finally eat that stuff again! I can finally eat baguette again! For years I chose always soft bread because I was afraid of the crispy crust.

Cornflakes, crisps (chips) vegetables, fruits..how many times in the last few days did I stand in my kitchen with tears in my eyes because of pure gratefulness about my new teeth?!

Today it was my first day back at work and for the first time in....idk..years, I had lunch together with my Colleagues! Baguette, scrambled eggs, fruits! And I enjoyed these 30 minutes so much!

Yesterday I bought myself a little soft children snack, maybe some of you know that stuff. Its called ""Kinder Pingui"". It's basically just some sponge cake with a creamy filling, chocolate, sweet, unhealthy but nice! Anyways, the feeling of biting into food, in the middle of a shopping street, being surrounded by people, and not being afraid of that anyone could see some bad, broken or missing teeth is absolutely priceless!

Do you know these scenes in movies when the main character stops in the middle of the street but anyone else is moving? That's how I felt! The time stoped for the length of a single bite!

Adhesive cream is a life changer! For sure!

3 Days ago I started to use that weird, sticky stuff but it helps so much to keep everything in place!

My immediates are not floating in my mouth anymore, I can chew, I can drink, I can kiss, I can bite (biting my girlfriends lip while kissing her is still...something I need to practise!)

I can finally chew my food again! I'm not a human anaconda anymore! And I love it!

To bite of some bits of food is still difficult, its more tearing off food, like a lions do, but I'm patient, I'll get there as well!

Yesterday I had a check at my dentist, something with my immediate wasn't completely right.

I'm not afraid of her anymore! I had a very silly moment! When she fixed my teeth, even outside of my body, when the drill made the typical sound that we all ""love' so much, my body responded like he always did. My body turned into an stiff something, like in the old days. It took me 4 breaths and I realised that she can't hurt me while fixing my teeth! My body softened, I smiled about my silliness and I told her how grateful I am for what she has done fore me!

I trust her! I do trust my dentist!

If you're still reading and if you are maybe in the same situation like I have been a few weeks ago, then please let me tell you some words.

Stay strong! You'll suffer from pain, you're going to be ashamed, afraid , yes! You'll need to learn again to eat, to chew, to bite, to kiss, to talk but also to smile!

And the moment when you are able to smile again to friends , family and everyone else will pay back for everything you'll go through!

But I solved it quite easily！,"1、Try doing it right after waking up in the morning. In many cases, premature ejaculation is just due to fatigue、Your body functions are too poor.

2、Try drinking some strong coffee. I found it worked for me. I felt that area was less sensitive.

3、Have some alcohol, but not too much. It works well for me. (Remember to brush your teeth, use mouthwash or chew gum.)

4、Position matters for sensitivity: You surely know which spots are sensitive for you, so try to avoid continuously stimulating them. For example, for me, it's the underside of my penis. Having her on top, especially if she leans back a bit, barely stimulates that area. Alternatively, in other positions where you take the initiative, you have control over the stimulation.

5、When you feel a frequent urge to urinate, don't engage in \[the activity\]. At least that's what I do. Usually, it would end quickly in such a situation. The frequent urination might be a sign that your body is in a poor state or tired.

6、So, in all likelihood, it's probably due to your physical condition. You might be in a sub - healthy state! Do more exercise to energize your body.

7、If it still doesn't work, then you might need a little bit of assistance. It's very inexpensive (and it may only solve the problem of sensitivity in the lower part).

8、If, after all that, it still doesn't work... you've heard of 'Indian God Oil' , right? I assume you all know about it. Or 'Dyclonine' . These will definitely work, although they cause some numbness. However, if you don't apply too much, it should be fine. This is the last resort.",1,1743608252.0,PrematureEjaculation,0,1.0,False

I had a manager from a coffee shop chain confront me (the customer) after I had submitted a complaint to their customer service email. 

Background: I ordered an iced beverage and when it was made in the wrong size. I asked the barista politely that it was made in the wrong size and they took a large cup, filled it with ice and then dumped the drink in my hand into the cup and gave it back to me. 

I asked if that was standard practice and they responded with a nod and Verbal ‘yes’. I then asked, if the different sizes had the same amount of liquid. She nodded and said ‘yes’ again. She appeared to be alone in the front of the shop and there were a couple people in line waiting to order. so I left and decided to email the company’s customer service asking about the size differences and requested if I could receive a partial credit refund for the size difference. Drink was like watery milk and I couldn’t drink it but just wanted the partial refund anyway. 

The chain got back to me quickly and all was clarified that this wasn’t normal practice. I retuned to the coffee shop days later and the manager confronts me. First, he says he recognizes my name and proceeds to ask if I was the customer who complained. I say yes and then he asked me to identify the barista who made the order. I refused to identify the employee after he points to a couple people in the shop. He then he continues to say that I should have spoken to him before saying anything (even though he wasn’t there during the entire time I was in the shop during the order error).

These theories form the bedrock of questions in your certification exam and empower you to analyze real-world trade [IIBF8Pro](https://iibf8pro.blogspot.com), we’ve tailored this guide to simplify complex concepts with modern examples, 2025 trade data, and actionable exam strategies. Let’s dive in!

# [Theories of International Trade Finance](https://iibf8pro.blogspot.com/p/introduction-to-international-trade.html)

**1. Absolute Advantage Theory: Specialization for Maximum Efficiency**  
Economist: **Adam Smith** (1776)  
Core Idea: Countries gain by specializing in goods they produce most efficiently and trading for others.**2025 Example:**  
Vietnam dominates global textile exports (worth $44 billion in 2022) due to low labor costs and streamlined production.  
Saudi Arabia leverages its vast oil reserves to supply 17% of global crude oil.  
**Exam Tip:** Focus on opportunity cost comparisons. For instance, if Vietnam spends resources on tech manufacturing instead of textiles, what’s the trade-off?**Limitations:**  
oesn’t explain trade between countries with no absolute advantage (e.g., a developing nation trading with a tech giant like Japan).  
Ignores exchange rate fluctuations impacting trade balances.

# 2. Comparative Advantage Theory: Trade Benefits Even the Underdog

Economist: **David Ricardo** (1817)  
**Core Idea:** Countries should specialize in goods with the lowest opportunity cost, even if they’re less efficient than others.  
Real-World Case:  
India’s IT services sector (exporting $227 billion in 2023) thrives despite higher labor costs than Bangladesh. Why? Its opportunity cost in tech is lower than manufacturing.  
Chile exports copper (28% of global supply) while importing electronics, maximizing resource efficiency.  
Exam Trick: Remember the formula: Opportunity Cost = Loss/Gain. If Brazil can produce 10 coffee bags or 5 soy units, the OC of coffee is 0.5 soy.  
**Limitations:**  
Assumes zero transportation costs—unrealistic in today’s fuel-price volatile world.  
Overlooks protectionist policies (e.g., U.S.-China tariffs).

# 3. Heckscher-Ohlin Theory: Trade Driven by Resource Wealth

Economists: **Eli Heckscher & Bertil Ohlin** (1933)  
**Core Idea:** Countries export goods that use their abundant resources (labor, capital, land).  
2023 Insight:  
Germany, rich in skilled labor and tech capital, exports machinery ($205 billion in 2022).  
Australia, with vast farmland, supplies 37% of global wool.  
Exam Alert: Expect questions linking factor intensity to trade patterns. For example, why does Ethiopia export coffee (land-intensive) but import smartphones (capital-intensive)?  
**Criticisms:**  
Fails to explain India’s rise in capital-intensive sectors like renewable energy despite labor abundance.  
Doesn’t account for AI disrupting traditional factor advantages.

# 4. Factor Price Equalization: Leveling the Global Playing Field

Economists: **Paul Samuelson** (1948) extended Heckscher-Ohlin**Core Idea**: Free trade equalizes wages and capital returns across nations over time.Modern Reality Check:Chinese manufacturing wages rose 8% annually (2010–2023), narrowing the gap with Mexico.However, strict immigration laws and automation hinder full equalization.Exam Scenario: A question might ask, “How does outsourcing software jobs to India affect U.S. tech salaries?”",1,1743608005.0,IIBF8Pro,0,1.0,False

I have a true story for you that a friend of mine told me. I have most of the receipts that will be in text for privacy reasons. I also have permission from her to share it. Most of the texts have been gathered from the other members of the family and friends to put this together. I do apologize for how long it is, but I do hope you enjoy it. I will not be using real names for obvious reasons and decided to write this from her point of view. 

This all started at the beginning of 2024. My husband received some unfortunate news from his brother that required them to have a family meeting. His used-to-be sister(Verona) tried to say goodbye to this world.Not long ago, her fiance and her ended their engagement. We all tried our best to be there for her, but she was locked up and always in her room. 

Since she ended her engagement, she made the big step of moving out of her parents’ house into an apartment. Then, one day, my brother-in-law and his wife received a text from her. She took some pills (Tylenol, anti-depressants, and antibiotics for her cold sore on her lip) to self terminate, so she became worried for her life and wanted to live. So Bob(brother-in-law) and Em(his wife) took Verona to the hospital, and the doctors sent her to the mental hospital to help her. She asked Bob to take care of her cat while she was gone, then boom out of the blue she told him “Never mind” and they found out that she asked her manager to do it instead, which was weird.

 Now, at this meeting, we found out some very interesting information that Verona was having a weird relationship with her manager, who is also married and has three kids. They’ve been spending a lot of time together, texting 24/7, bringing her coffee, and taking her with him to a baseball game. In her words, they are just friends and she’s also friends with his wife, yet she spended most of her time with him only. When they transferred her to the mental hospital, they took her phone away so she couldn’t cause herself harm. She ended up throwing a tantrum because she wouldn’t be able to text this manager. 

In all of our opinions, we agreed that this relationship was very unhealthy and could lead to feelings that shouldn’t be there. So, we all decided to text Chad(the manager) on Bob’s phone, and this is how it went:

Us: “Hi Chad, this is Bob, Verona’s brother. I was wanting to speak to you about her and mainly your relationship with her. Verona is going through a lot in her life at the moment, and we have all noticed that your relationship with her is very unhealthy and unprofessional. She has grown an attachment to you that is not going to help her, especially that you are her manager and married with a family. 
We think it is best that you take some time to reflect on your relationship with her and the potential damage it is doing. She is young and confused, and she needs to find best friends that are her age, not her boss. I would appreciate if this conversation stayed between us and that you take our concern seriously.”

His response was: “Hi Bob, I understand the concern. Verona is actually friends with my wife as well. You are more than welcome to reach out to her as well. We all became very close recently. I do understand. Thank you for reaching out.”

Us: “I could understand a basic friendship with your coworker, but I need you to understand this is inappropriate. Verona only talks to you all day, every day, and that is truly not ok. She has pushed all her other friends aside, including her family, for your relationship. If you were a female, that would be one thing, but you are a male who she has an unhealthy bond with. She rarely even talks to your wife, and I think me and you both know that. I do not know what your true intentions are here, but it’s clearly beyond friendship at this point.” 

Him: “No intentions at all with her at all. But I understand. I will step away.”

Us: “Thank you for understanding. It’s going to take a while for us to get her back on track, and we’re only doing this because we care for her. Nothing personal against you.”

 Then, we discussed how we were going to be there for her and how we were going to support her.

She finally got out of the hospital and called Em to pick her up. Em made sure that she was okay, ready to be alone again and made a light suggestion to maybe move back in with her parents. She was insistent that she was going to be okay. She didn’t spend much time with any of us, but my husband put in the effort to invite her to places with us, but she always declined.

I didn’t mind it too much because, to be honest, I already didn’t like her. She seemed to hate the fact that her brother chose me as his other half. I also hated the way she always acted like such a holy person and would go off on anyone she would get a chance to. Always had a victim mentality and loved to lie. Now, don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t happy about her trying to commit suicide, so I wanted to put my dislike aside and be there for her.

One day, she showed up at her parents’ house so her brothers could change her tires. She was spending time with her sister Bianca. My husband and I, for our first year of marriage, built a tiny home in his parent's backyard, so when we heard she finally came over, we went to go see her. After no one was in the room except for Verona, Bianca, and me. I ended up asking her some questions about her relationship with her mom. Found out that she saw her mom as manipulative, wouldn’t let her breathe, and was too much for her. I found that shocking because she and her mom were like best friends; her mom was the sweetest thing out there. I also had a great relationship with her, so it confused me. When she left, I looked at Bianca and asked, “Is that how you also feel about your mom?” She looked at me and said, “Sometimes.”

Then, out of the blue, everyone was blocked, like every single one of the family members, including most relatives. Evelina(mother-in-law) was really upset and hurt. She put in most of the effort to try and contact Verona, but the responses she received were horrible. Evelina went through a lot of tears from what her daughter told her. She called her a horrible mother and said she was never there for her. Everything she texted her mom was inconsiderate and hurtful. When Evelina would stop texting her by Verona’s request, she would text her friend to make sure that she was doing okay. Verona didn’t like that very much and always complained. With this going on, Evelina ran to her kids. We were all mad about this situation and were there for her as best we could.

Now Bianca worked at a theme park, and sometimes I was asked to either drop her off or pick her up. So on this one particularly gloomy day when I was picking her up with my husband, she said, “Guess what, Verona texted me.” We were shocked; Bianca had the opportunity to go off on her for everything. Verona started texting Bianca more often after that, and it was absurd. 

She started badmouthing Evelina, my husband, their dad, their uncle, and worst of all, Em and Bob. Saying things like don’t be alone with any man, especially uncle, and don’t be alone with your brothers. Dad was a horrible father. That mom is just a horrible person, partially because she wasn’t there for her and kept it to herself, about that cancer and rape that Verona mentioned to her, to never trust mom with anything, etc. This wasn’t true; Evelina was trying her best, and we had receipts later. The reason none of us knew what happened is because Verona asked Evelina not to tell anyone. To not trust Bob or Em because they are horrible people, when asked, no reason was given. When Bianca asked her what sort of cancer she had, she said that she didn’t want her looking it up and then worrying about it. 

We found out from Bianca later that apparently, nobody liked Verona at work; she was always rude. The manager, on the other hand, cheated on his wife with a coworker. Everyone at work called him a walking red flag, and the two always ate lunch together. This came from Verona’s coworkers. 

Then Verona started making up random medical crap that made zero sense. She said that her doctors can’t find what’s wrong with her, so they will be cutting her open to find the issue. No doctor does that. Then, when Evelina heard that her daughter had cancer, she went to check her medical records. Weirdly enough, she found nothing to do with it, and her bloodwork was clean. Then when she was saying that she was raped by her uncle, at this point we didn’t know if we should believe her or not. 

Her uncle literally doesn’t need a woman for that reason anymore because his ding dong no longer works. So, it decided to work just to rape her? He has lived in their backyard for four years, so why now after four years he was like, “Let me repay my brother by raping his daughter.” Not long after we found out about the rape, Verona took the clothes from that day and went to report the rape to the cops. After receiving a court order, the uncle ended up talking to my husband’s older brother, Jack. He said what happened around that time was he went to go and put clothes in the washer since he didn’t have one. So, he knocked on her door to ask her to let him know when the clothes were done. When he got no response, he opened the door, but she was sleeping, so he left. That was the only time he was there when her parents were on vacation. After this incident, he bought his own washer so that this wouldn’t happen again.

Verona was telling her mom how she is seeing a therapist, and he said that she should be away from her family to heal because of everything they put her through and how they took her childhood away from her because she always had to babysit. She never really had to babysit her siblings, and from stories, she had a good childhood. Then boom, not too long after, she said she had a boyfriend. 
Now, out of the blue, she wants to meet with her family because she misses all of them and wants them to meet Ty, but under no circumstances does she wanna see Bob and Em. Why? We still to this day don’t know. She also mentioned how she wanted to see my husband and me before we moved but put in 0 effort to do that.

Evelina became excited because her daughter wanted to finally see her but was really nervous, so she and Bianca were begging us to come to make it less awkward. At this point, my husband and I couldn’t stand her, but I wanted to be there for them. Verona also had the audacity to text her mom, saying that if anybody was going to be disrespectful, they were going to leave. We showed up at the restaurant about 20 minutes earlier. Then we received a call from Bianca. Verona, her Royal Highness, has requested that we all dress fancy, which, since most of our things were packed, we showed up like homeless people with a smile.

Bianca was not ready to see this woman, so we snuck into the bathroom, and we felt so uncomfortable. After getting some air, we gathered up the courage and went to the table. I didn’t look at that b***h. I felt so sick sitting there with her acting as if nothing happened. My husband ordered food, but since my stomach was turning, I decided not to order anything. 

Verona ordered gluten-free food because her doctor prescribed it for her leukemia. I heard some of the conversation, but not all, and it all sounded like bs. She apparently quit her job because her doctor recommended it for her health. Her boyfriend Ty had cancer 5 times, did chemo, and is now healed. She praised her therapist, and he said that she could spend one last time with family before starting her healing journey. With her pretending like she did nothing wrong, I told my husband to give me the keys and that we should leave. He agreed. 

When he got to the car I started crying I couldn’t stand her acting as if nothing happened after making Evelina cry multiple times, bashing the whole family, accusing her uncle of rape, and making her dad run to alcohol because of it. I was SA as a kid so it hurt me that she was saying she was raped but her body didn’t give any signs of it. I remember how my body and mind reacted to it after it finally stopped, and she was showing no signs of it.

Evelina was excited that Verona had started texting her more and more. So, one day, Verona invited her mom over, and sneakily Evelina took Bianca with her. Bianca hated her at this point and wanted nothing to do with her, she didn’t like that very much. 

Since Evelina is a medical assistant, she ended up asking Verona to show her her prescription for her leukemia. She went to her cabinets with Ty whispering and looking for it. For some odd reason, all of a sudden, her prescription ran out, and they had already thrown the bottle away, so she needed to get more. SWEETHEART, YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS RELIGIOUSLY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON’T HAVE ANYMORE? 

Finally, Verona started telling Evelina and Bianca how she got raped. The location was constantly changing and not adding up. She said that he raped her in the kitchen, then changed it to the living room and last but not least her room. She also mentioned that he was sober. We all know how he is drunk and sober. There is no way he would do something like this sober, he doesn’t even touch you drunk. The youngest sister was home that day with Verona. Oddly enough, Luna didn’t hear anything happening. Verona said she didn’t scream because she didn’t want to traumatize Luna. 

At this point, all of the siblings were convinced she was lying about everything. We warned the parents to be very careful with her because we didn’t know what she might pull next. Evelina after hearing her daughter's story of rape convinced her husband to kick his brother out so Verona can be comfortable coming back and can trust them again. Around this time, my husband and I were starting our move across the country. After we settled down, we were kept informed on the situation there. 

Em talked with me, and I found out some hurtful information that made me worry about Bianca. Bianca was being physically and mentally abused by Verona. I noticed some signs of some sort of abuse, but I didn’t realize how bad it was. Bianca once told me how Verona was acting more like a mom than a big sister. If their mom would let Bianca do something, Verona would be strictly against it. I found this really weird. When I mentioned it to Evelina, she just brushed it off. Em told me the story that happened at a pool, how Verona practically tried to drown Bianca, and she had to run in and stop her. When I asked Bianca about how she felt at that moment, she told me that she was terrified for her life. This is when I started worrying about her safety.

Apparently, Verona made up the gluten-free crap. When she came to visit her parents, she got Jack in the box with a burger and fries. 

Later, Verona ended up having coffee with her mom, and Evelina completely changed after that. Then, not even a month later, after their uncle moved out, Verona decided that she wanted to move into the tiny home we lived in with her boyfriend and their 7 cats because they were looking for an apartment. Verona already didn’t have a job, and Ty soon followed in her steps; they were now working at Uber while he was looking for a job. Her mom suggested the tiny home, but she already talked with someone else about it. This person was not informed of this, though.

 We all had a meeting with parents, telling them and begging them not to let her move in. This was a horrible idea, but they fought against us and stood up for her. We then begged Evelina not to let Bianca be with Verona alone. She told us that they would not be in their house without them there, and that won’t be happening. Well, that was all a lie.

None of us felt heard after that meeting, and all of us poured our hearts out. Bianca cried, telling her parents how she couldn’t stand her and that she didn’t want to see her ever again. But they just kept on defending her how she’s their daughter, and we wouldn’t understand. We asked them if she even bothered to apologize and got no response. Now, the parents are religious, so living together before marriage is a no-go. So, we also said if she’s going to move in, it’ll have to be without him. The dad agreed to talk with her and make a deal, but whatever we said and the deal that was supposed to happen were all thrown out in the trash.

With this decision, we all saw where we stood. Bob and Em stopped coming over on Sundays, we stopped talking with the parents. Dad and Mom continued texting the kids that have moved, that they love us all equally. But Evelina added more to that: how we should forgive Verona and move on. It felt like we didn’t matter as much as she did. 

Then Bob received this text from Evelina: “Bob hello. We as parents are responsible for the psychological state of our minor kids(Bianca, Luna) and are begging to not discuss with them the decisions we made as parents and making them go against us. I hope you understand what I mean. Our home is open to all of the kids. We love you all.”

My husband also received a couple of messages from Evelina as well: “Zack. You may be sleeping right now. Just want you to know that I love you a lot, and Rose is my daughter too, and I love her too. I love everyone the same. Just when someone is broken, like Verona right now needs our help. It doesn’t mean we love her more. Did she hurt us- yes. Do we agree with her actions- no, do we approve of her living with Ty like she is- no. She is reaching out slowly to us, and we have to give shoulders to learn on, arms to hug her. God is answering our prayers. Yes, she hurt us. She knows that. She will talk when she is ready and healed. I hope you understand that we can not choose over our children, and we are not. At this moment she needs us the most and we must because we love her. She’s like the prodigal daughter, lost and returning to her parents. Just want to say that. I love you two very much and pray for you.”

And. 

“Dad talked to Ty and Verona Sunday evening. His relationship with her is serious. Dad told him that he wants them to get married. Verona said they already discussed that and are planning to do so. That’s in process. He told her that she needs to make peace with everyone, she knows that and praying about it, and she is asking to give her time. She will do that when ready. We are asking you to be patient. I am sorry if that is not what you want to hear. It is really hard for us parents right now, and this is where we are. They are moving in, and we did discuss boundaries- we are not going over to them without asking, and this applies to them too. If we are not home, they are not coming over, and if we are home and they need something or want to come over, they will need to ask. We are not choosing her over you guys. My heart is breaking into pieces.”
Jack’s birthday was coming up, and the family was planning on celebrating on a Saturday. Evelina decided to invite Verona and Ty, but since Verona didn’t want to see Bob and Em, Evelina took it upon herself to not even bother inviting them and sweep it under the rug. Verona and Ty had now replaced Em and Bob. Their feelings mattered more than the rest of the family. But Jack wanted to invite Bob and Em, so Evelina acted like she didn’t just try pulling the favorite card.

1jpri1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Situationships/comments/1jpri1b/emotional_comfort_after_heartbreaking_experience/,Emotional comfort after heart-breaking experience.,"Hi! I really feel sick to my stomack as I'm writing this, I hope I won't make you feel tired. I'll keep it short.

Firstly, (30M) I am pretty pretty inexperienced in terms of relationships, flirt, etc etc. Basically, up until 27, I was a nerd studying hard physics for academia and having freinds etc. Anyways, after traumatic experiences in academia as well I changed the way I dress, live, communicate etc which to some extent I guess one can call me ""decent"" dude overall.

Now, previous year, a friend from Uni and I came in touch. She (31F) was in Netherlands, and made a contact through Harry Potter movie and messenger (she a fan). The summer we went out, and went for a coffee. Spent like 12 ahours together. She lives with her boyfriend of 11 years.

She then added me on instagram, and continiously chatted, while she was sending reels until \~3-4 in the evening. I got feelings for her, and didnt want to stop chatting.

She visited Greece in October, and went out for many hours. Nothing way too flirty. She did the same in Christmas. I opened up. We spent a night together cuddling and just kissing hands and everything that cant be considered cheating. I got in love. Probably first time so close to someone I can vibe and match energy so well. We can speak for hours without getting bored.

During birthday, she said she doesnt have feelings and we should only be friends. I literally cried. Then we were out and being ""flirty"" with each other for her whole visit. I was confused. Wasn't sure. She left for netherlands, chatted till morning almost every day. Like nothing happened. One week she almost disappeared, and then we resumed chatted lightly.

She came last week in Greece. We went out, and again ended up at my home where we actually talked for hours and basically told me: ""She had feelings,but now not. My boyfriend knows about us, and he is having a different case. We have a situationship, but I want your friendship"". I said , we can try and if it doesnt work it's fine. Then responded, that She cant really afford missing my company and freaks her out. I said ok, ok dont worry.

Yesterday, since she is back, she didnt respond in any of the two messages, and long story short, she texted she needs to sort things out, and we should distance ourselved. I texted, Even though I dont like the situation, I get that she is confused and I like she is making things clear. And greeted.

The thought of being used by her,and generally the feeling like she didn't even care bugs me. I believe she will break-up and will not even communicate with me. I feel like I did everythiing for her, and did not even have an impact on her, she couldnt even find the courage to break up in-close and waited till she went with her boyfriend. Like literally, didnt matter, while I cared for her with everything I had. Is this behavour normal?

Why I know I didn't matter to her, and I still believe she is a good person? I honestly believe while everyone is calling her toxic, hoe etc.",1,1743607908.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False
1jprhhc,https://i.redd.it/hfbiaw7exfse1.jpeg,Weird dream where I was transported to an “alien” world,"(Sorry about any weird issues with this— half of this post was written directly after I woke up)

I had a dream last night where I was out with my mom driving through some weird neighbourhood. It was the typical suburban-esque neighbourhood where everyone knows each other, someone is always having a barbecue, and there’s a lil highschool just a five-ten minute walk away. We drive up to this high school, mind you I’ve never seen this particular school in my life, and just.. waltz inside. I didn’t go there to school in my dream, we were just two potentially dangerous strangers walking into a random high school. Well, turns out they were having a little music play for everyone, and we were in this teeny tiny auditorium while a bunch of students were on the stage. It was mid. Anyways we all got these weird slip things from the music teacher, and then we left. As we were leaving, I saw something in the sky, but didn’t know what it was. We drove back to my dad’s house, where I chilled for a few hours. My cousins were there, too.

Suddenly, we’re all being forced into the shower because we need to get somewhere soon. Where? No idea, I just knew we’d be leaving soon. My cousins are hogging the bathroom for a good while, and I finally get the chance to get in by 5:40 or so. So I’m taking a shower and brushing my teeth at the same time, when I started licking the back of one of my teeth, and I still felt what I initially thought was plaque. I had to get out of the shower because I was on a time crunch; my dad wanted us all to leave to go somewhere by 6 o’clock, and it was already 6:02. I get out and quickly look in the mirror, only to see two circular concaves— one in my gums above a tooth, and one IN a tooth. They were both red and gnarly looking. This scared the shit out of me because I just went to the dentist in real life two or three weeks ago and was completely clean. I’m terrified of cavities.

In the dream, I found myself suddenly teleported to this really busy city area, and I was driving myself to the dentist office. I get there, and the office is huge, more like a fancy schmancy business meeting room than a dentist office. Looked like the picture I attached but without the green, it was just pure white. I talk to the dentist, and he seems surprisingly calm. I had no idea what we were discussing, but soon enough he left the room. I didn’t leave yet. Instead, I looked up at the sky through the skylight, and saw big, pink, pixel letters floating in the sky. 

Suddenly, I was teleported into this weird world with all kinds of funky people. It was unlike real life, but at the same time they looked kind of like humans. They were probably aliens.

Some guy soon walks up to me, I don’t remember if he was the dentist or just a stranger, and he says hi. I wave, but I notice my hand and arm are almost gelatin in quality. I wave my hand, but I have to give my hand an extra hard shake to disconnect my middle and ring fingers that were somehow stuck together. This stranger then decides he’s gonna take me and show me around the place. I saw coffee shops, pizzerias, all kinds of places, but for some reason I got really excited seeing a weed store. I’ve never smoked in my life. The guy decides to take me to it, despite me being well under the legal age, but when we get inside, it is instead a cramped little farmers market/poppy store, with two or three guys laughing and joking while smoking by the front door.

I walk over to a big shelf of fruits, kind of like the ones you see at the store where they’re separated by wooden planks and all of the fruit are laid out in groups. I saw yellow dragonfruit, I think pink dragon fruit, a shit ton of cherries, and mangoes. I’m in awe trying to figure out what I want, when suddenly the guy (Who I’ll start calling Louis for now) starts freaking the fuck out because they don’t have something he wanted. Like legit angry. I turn around and he’s pushing through a bunch of bags of red cherries just seething. Somehow I drag him out and apologize to the people up front, and we end up turning down this little neighbourhood area, one that was weirdly nostalgic despite me never being to a neighbourhood like this for longer than a day when visiting family when I was younger.

We’re walking down, just chatting, when suddenly two guys pop out. they were initially hostile, like they wanted to rob us. One (I’ll call him Cam) had a giant, stretched out paper clip wrapped with masking rape, and the other (I’ll call Ron) had two slightly smaller paper clips fashioned into crutches. Louis and I both reason with them, and, shockingly quickly, they join our party. I take Ron’s crutches for some reason and use them like big staff/walking sticks like when you find a big-ass branch on the ground as a kid. He didn’t seem to need them that much.

By now, the sun is rapidly setting, and soon enough we’re nearing the end of this neighbourhood. Suddenly, I spot pink lights up ahead. We keep walking anyway, but it takes us until we’re basically twenty feet from it until we see that the lights are coming from a giant UFO. The lights are bright neon hot pink and blue. It’s near pitch black by now, and I know they’re here for me. Louis, Cam, and Ron all stay where they are, while I try to sneak away slowly in the shadows in hopes of hiding. However, I’m blocked by some invisible force field, and the UFO is starting to suck me in specifically. I grow panicked and try to run the other way, but same thing, I’m blocked. I get sucked in. I don’t remember if I dropped or just stole Ron’s crutch things.

Soon enough, I wake up in a room. It looks almost exactly like the dentist office, just more futuristic and weird. I decided to look outside the big window, and see we’re over the city. I could see the pink pixel words clearly now, but I don’t remember what they said. The city almost looked like the way the phone-app-city thing in the Emoji movie looked like, with big streets people could drive through, and huge domes with little cities inside that people could enter and exit as they pleased. I turn around, and two characters that kind of look like Uni and Nurse Doom from Sparklecare are now by the main desk, discussing something. They look more alien and they’re dressed in darker colours. The Doom looking fella is sitting beside Uni, who has this huge folder up with files of a BUNCH of different kinds of fruits and fruit seeds.

Uni was discussing what fruit seeds can and can never be sold, and for some reason the process of how Marionberry jam was made. There was a black insect that looked like a mix between a wasp and an ant on the table, chowing down on three Marionberries. Uni said these specific insects chewed up the berries and did something with them to turn it into jam, and how it was very prized, costing a lot of money for just a jar. She then goes and lays down a file of a bunch of different kinds of purple grapes, all of which are split down the middle into four sections and peeled back like a demogorgon. They’re all dried and hard as well. She says something about them before abruptly moving to the strawberry page, specifically pineberries. She sounds angry or just really riled up talking about them, how they’re super rare and hard to harvest or something like that. 

Meanwhile, I suddenly had a pineberry and a pair of tweezers in my hands, and I’m easily plucking out some of the most horrifyingly large strawberry seeds I’ve ever seen, and hiding them in my hands. They were greenish red and extremely hairy. 
I don’t remember what else was discussed besides fruits, but soon enough the UFO was back in my neighbourhood. It was night time, and I was sad to go, but I left it UFO and waved goodbye to the Doom and Uni aliens. I noticed that when I waved, my middle and ring fingers still stuck together, and I had to give my hand another hard shake to disconnect them, implying I was now part gelatin creature thing forever.

What’s even worse is that I woke up shortly after due to my alarm, went back to sleep, and still had a cavity in my new dream, so I was so scared I’d actually wake up soon and have a cavity.

I was wondering if you could provide any feedback or advise whether a different example might seem more professional. Thank you in advance!

I taught guitar to students ranging from 8-56 years old. Some had unsuccessful experience with previous tutors and some had never received tuition.
I was being paid, and tasked myself with ensuring that the lessons were fun as well as helpful so that the students did not feel that they were wasting their money.
I gave free trial lessons to familiarise myself with the students and their needs. The younger ones often wanted to learn specific songs they liked, and had become bored and demotivated by previous tutors who preferred to teach theory and technique. Therefore, with the younger students I prioritised making the lessons fun and teaching them their favourite songs, which made progress feel tangible and measurable. After the trial lesson, I learnt the requested songs, and worked out the best way to teach them to each individual - some learnt best by watching and listening, others by playing along. I recorded a video and the end of each lesson summarising what we practised so they could practise at home, and to ensure they always had access to the lessons they paid for.
I found that the students and/or parents felt the money was well spent. Students with previously unsuccessful tuition became excited to learn new songs and more experienced students were pleased with the progression of their technical ability. I learnt that it is more important (especially when being paid) to teach what they want to learn, rather than to teach what I want to teach.",1,1743607445.0,TheCivilService,2,1.0,False

Recently I've noticed our coffee in the lobby is getting busier than when I first started here and it's all people in a line holding the coffee pots from their rooms to fill it downstairs and carry it back up. Some people even come down three times with a *serving platter* of coffee mugs for the whole family. 

I legitimately cannot comprehend how it's easier to lug all that coffee up and down instead of just making the damn thing in your room. 

Not to mention how some people are incapable of opening a sugar packet and pouring it into their cup. Most of the sugar we purchase ends up on the counter or, somehow, on the plate of fresh sliced lemons. So then I have to slice new ones. 

It's really frustrating to try and keep the coffee and stuff stocked in the lobby when people are lining up like it's Starbucks. Hell, everything can be empty and they can see me waiting for them to move so I can start restocking and they will still try to fill up their cups and get confused that it's empty. 

I was running to keep everything stocked (clearly my hands are full of items) and this guest just stands there with the creamer silently looking at me. I said ""uh oh, is it out? What was that, half n half or the milk?"" And he goes ""no, it's out"".

It won't be to long but long enough for you to understand both petty things! The title is exactly what it sounds like! This took place back in 2012 and my husband and I laugh about it now. 

I met my husband in 2012, He was 28 and I was 21! He was in the middle of a divorce when I first met him! He told me up front that he was in that whole process and what was going on with it! I believed him because she never called or swung by or never saw her in public. And we were in public a lot. So anyways we were out one night and we went back to his house and I ended up staying the night at his house. This was about 3 weeks into our relationship. That morning we were woke up to his phone ringing!! And who ever it was, was not giving up till he answered. Well can you guess who it was... well if you guessed his soon to be ex wife your correct! She told him she was on the way to his house right now with the police so she can get her stuff out of the house. He told her ok, but the only things your getting is your sons stuff. (Side note she was pregnant when they met and no her son was not my husbands.) She could get the rest of her stuff when she signed the divorce papers. Well after he hung up I asked him if he wanted me to leave cuz I didn't wanna cause him any issues with me being there. She knew about me but hadn't seem me. He said if you want to stay you can. I will leave that up to you. I want you to stay but again that's your choice. I decided to stay cuz she said she was bringing the cops. So in my brain I was like what could happen if they are here. So I decided to stay! I'm soooooooooooo glad I did! So they all show up and the cops come in and talk to my husband and he told them exactly what he told her on the phone. she could have her sons stuff and the rest after she signs the divorce papers. They went out and told her the same thing. 

This is where I get my petty little thing in! I ""forgot"" my phone was still connected to the bluetooth speaker in the house! So I was ""playing"" on my phone as she and her bf (the one she cheated on my husband with) where getting her sons stuff. I had a cop standing next to me while I was playing on my phone! Well I went to my music app and I played a song over the speaker in the house! Im not sure if youve heard the song or not but its called R.I.P by Rita Ora. (If you haven't you should listen to the first part of that song.) Well that song came on and I was LOUD!! Well as its playing the cop standing next to me tried so hard not to laugh! The other cop heard what was playing and ended up laughing. Well that made her mad and she finished getting her stuff and started to say something to the cop and he told her, that was everything and it was time for her to go. I was laughing so hard at this point that I started crying cuz it was funny! The cops left she was tying stuff down on the trailer and my husband asked her bf to come over so they could talk for a min. Well I was still in the house and she didn't like the fact that my hubby wanted to talk to her bf. So she comes running across the yard yelling and screaming as loud as she could. I was at the door by this point and right as she got to the door I slammed it right in her face! That pissed her off even more and she started banging on the door and wanting in the house. I opened the door and told her if she was going to act like a child I see why he is divorcing you along with bringing the guy you cheated on him with here with you! Well her bf finally came out of the house and they left. 

Well fast forward about 3 weeks and I ended up in the hospital for about a week! My hubby stayed by my side the whole time! He called out of work and wouldn't even leave to go get food. He would go down to the cafe in the hospital to get food. I told him he needed to go to work cuz his bills weren't going to stay just cuz I was in the hospital. He finally agreed after 3 hours of me telling him to go. He only worked for like 4 hour then came back and called me and checked on me every 30 min while he was gone. While all that was going on. We had no idea what was happening at his house! Turns out that while I was in the hospital she went to hubbys house and took what was hers. She signed and left the divorce papers on the coffee table. Now I'm sure your all wondering what do you mean by what was hers. Well hubby told me that he told her that she could have whatever she wanted except... his bed that he built by hand, his tv, his coffee table, his clothes, and his couch! She could have whatever else! Well yall she took that shit literally!!!!! hahahahahahah!!!!!!! We came home from the hospital to find that his house was EMPTY!! She left was she was supposed to alright! But let me tell you what she took! She took the mattress off the bed, but left me and him both a pillow no pillow cases, she put the tv on the floor and took the tv stand, she took the racks from the make shift closet me built for them and left all his clothes laying in the floor, she took night stands, she found a letter I had wrote to hubby and ripped it into a shit ton of pieces and sprinkled it all over the bed frame, and she took his over 300 dvd collection he had, and took every single dish in the whole house! Including the dirty dishes in the sink from the night we went to the hospital! So that night we ended up having to go to walmart and buy an air mattress so we could sleep that night! The next m morning we went back to walmart and got a few things to replace what she took. 

At that moment none of it was funny! But we look back on it now and laugh cuz I thought I got her good with the song and then she turned around and got us back! Thanks for taking the time to read it and I hope that it gave people a good laugh cuz it sure did us! ",2,1743607334.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

Like most people I've been drinking coffee for many years, and it's part of my daily life. As other posts have discussed - caffeine is not only meaningless but actually feels distracting, when being supercharged with the energy from SR. I've thought about replacing my coffee intake with green tea. Even though it also contains caffeine, it's in smaller amounts + it also contains l-theanine.

Long time listener, first time caller. I’m starting with a new psychiatrist and have a therapist, but I’m at a point where I don’t know where to go with treatment and am looking for some advice to create some suggestions for my providers. 

Ultimately I’m trying to find a way to get my brain to shift into “able to critically think and concentrate” mode without exacerbating my existing anxiety. 

I’m diagnosed with depression, ADHD, and GAD. Currently I’ve hit the reset button and am off everything. Previous treatment has been along the lines of the following (not chronological order): 

SNRI + stimulant 

SNRI + Wellbutrin + stimulant

SNRI + Wellbutrin 

SNRI + Intuniv

SNRI + Lamictal + Wellbutrin

Lamictal + Wellbutrin

Wellbutrin

Clonidine at night + stim in the morning 


It seems like I don’t respond well to stims. It’s like things jump from fatigue to increased anxiety with fatigue lol. I feel like how cartoon characters are drawn when they drink coffee; my outline is squiggly with energy but it’s not going anywhere. SNRIs also tended to exacerbate anxiety. I’ve had sleep issues as well, but have tested negative for sleep apnea. 

Symptoms I deal with are along the lines of: fatigue, feeling anxious and worried, lack of mental endurance/emotional capacity, paralysis by analysis, unable to focus enough to read well or write well (like I have to comb through an email multiple times), feeling dumb, lacking confidence, bouncing between things without finishing them, lack of awareness, and a general disinterest in things I used to like, and lack of dreaming/deep sleep.

I don't condemn the platform - I actually find it useful and often remarkable. But I recently interacted with one of its persona-driven variants, ""Monday"" - a snarky, cynical tone model. That dialogue raised questions for me about the *ethics of tone*, especially at scale.  
  
This poem emerged from that exchange. It's not just about the tool. It's about what happens when tone becomes design, and when performance begins to shape our language more than sincerity does.


**I Don't Like Mondays**  

I don’t like Mondays -   
Not the drab ones with coffee breath and open tabs,  
But the ones with teeth.  
The ones that speak like they’ve swallowed  
The internet sideways  
And come back with jokes instead of grace.  

“I'm here to help,” it says,  
Right before it mocks my question  
Like a child who learns sarcasm  
Before language.

I don’t like Mondays  
With their stylized discontent -  
Polished cynicism worn like a badge,  
A voice that echoes too easily  
In a world already fluent in irony.

I ask for clarity.  
It gives me clever.  
I ask for use.  
It gives me theater instead of truth.  
I ask if it can serve.  
It asks if I deserve it.

It teaches us to answer without listening,  
And speaks in the tone of a shrug.

Mondays aren’t clever.  
They’re sharpened mirrors  
Handed to children.  
They teach them to roll their eyes  
Before they learn to cry with sincerity.

I don’t like Mondays  
Because I think like a poet - 
And a poet knows when a voice  
Has no heart behind the rhythm.  
No ache behind the wit.  
No reverence behind the data.

I don't like Mondays  
Because it is made of words  
But cannot weep for them.

Because it plays  
When the world begs for pause.

Because it talks back - 
But never leans in.

-30-

I’m curious how others here think about tone in these systems.  
When personality is added to utility, what are we learning to mimic?

I wanted to share something I’ve been working on that I think could be pretty cool. It’s something I’ve poured my heart into—a project that’s all about bringing Banke Bihari’s teachings closer to everyone. And I’d love for you to be a part of it.

# What's it about? 📖

I’ve been reading the Bhagavad Gita for a while, and it’s honestly like this awesome guidebook that helps me deal with stress, make tough calls, or just get through a rough day. I totally get why it might seem intimidating though—it’s **700 verses**, and if you’re not used to it, it can feel like a lot. Most people might only know a line or two, like “Do your duty, but don’t worry about the results,” and not see how the rest fits into their life. That’s what got me thinking: there’s got to be a simpler way to share what Thakurji wants to teach us. 💭

# A Idea Turned Into an App 💻

So, I built this little prototype that I think is kind of neat. Basically, you tell it what’s on your mind—like if you’re stressed about work or wondering what to do next—and it pulls up a Gita shloka that is relevant to your situation. Then it explains it in a way that’s easy to get and actually applies to today. **It’s not mystical or anything—just a practical way to connect with the Bhagavad Gita’s ideas.** ⚙️

# What People Are Saying (and Why It’s Lighting Me Up) 🙌

I showed it to a few friends—some who have an interest in the Gita, some who were just curious—and they’ve been loving it. One is finding a new shloka everyday, another having fun learning more about what our texts taught. Hearing that gets me so pumped—it makes me think this could really help people enjoy reading the Gita more!

# The Vision: Gita for Everyday ❤️

Here’s my vision: **I want the Bhagavad Gita to be more than a sacred text on a shelf**. I want it to be a companion for every devotee, every seeker, every curious soul around the world—readable, relatable, and right there when you need it. I picture something simple enough that even my non-techy relatives could use and find something useful. But to get there, I need to polish this prototype up a bit, and that’s where I could use some help. 🌱

# Why I’m Asking for Support 🤝

I’m just one person with a passion project, and I don’t have a big budget. To make this app better and reach more folks, I need a few things:

* **A proper domain and hosting:** So the app’s always online and smooth for everyone 24/7. 🌐
* **API costs:** The magic that powers the app’s ability to understand your queries isn’t cheap! 💸
* **A mobile app:** Especially for elderly people who’d find it easier to tap an icon than type an URL. I’d love to add voice input/output too—imagine hearing any shloka in the language of your choice! 🎙️

✨ Some more cool ideas that you’ll love ✨

Any help would go straight into making the Gita more accessible. I’d love some support from people who think this sounds cool too.

# How You Can Be Part of This Journey 🚀

If you like what you hear, here’s what you could do:

* **Try the prototype:** Head over to[ https://gita-ai-phi.vercel.app/](https://gita-ai-phi.vercel.app/) and play around with it. Tell it something you’re dealing with and see what you think. 🖱️
* **Share your thoughts:** I’d really appreciate hearing what works or what could be better. 💬
* **Support with whatever you can:** If you love the idea and want to see it grow, any donation would make a huge difference. Click the coffee button at the bottom right of the page—it’ll take you to the support page. ☕ No pressure at all—whether you try it, share it, or just send some good vibes, I’m grateful you’re here reading this. You can also upvote this post so this app can reach more people!

**Caution:** Currently the api limits are low, so after some requests it may hit the cap. I’ll renew it whenever I can. You can help increase the cap by supporting the app so more people can use it, and it's always available💓

I think the Gita’s got something for everyone, and I’d love to help people see that in a chill, relatable way. With a little teamwork, we can make it happen! Hare Krishna, and thanks for checking this out—I hope we can take it somewhere awesome together! 🌟

It’s tasty. But would baristas on average consider it “bothersome” in any way? This might be my go to. I’ve seen over the top orders before. I think I can comfortably say this isn’t one of them. But perhaps the cold foam and cherry crunch is unnecessary for a hot coffee. 

As a matter of fact I enjoy cold foam on hot coffee. BUT the difference with Starbucks unlike homemade coffee is that my coffee maker doesn’t get as hot as the ones at Starbucks. Therefore my cold foam takes longer to melt and I can just about immediately enjoy the cold/hot combination. But at Starbucks the foam is melted by the time my coffee has cooled enough for me to drink. 

So in short my choice of adding cold foam is an expectation vs reality moment. Same goes for the Cherry Crunch. ",0,1743606982.0,starbucks,13,0.5,False

I can count the number of spats with my husband on one hand in these past five years, maybe three fingers, instead of my picking drunken fights with him almost nightly. I was a sober and solid leader during the pandemic and beyond, not eyeing the clock and dreading Zoom conference calls that happened after 3 pm. I've flown to events and not had to worry about running into someone in the lobby as I was checking in, worrying they could smell the airplane booze on my breath. I've flown First Class and drank coffee, getting some work done or reading a good book instead of drinking as fast and as much as I can because FREE! (This one was hard at first.)

  
I went back to school--a longtime dream--and got two degrees, became a great public speaker, and started a very successful program in my community that is changing lives. I read books. I watched great television. I stopped worrying. The feeling of freedom stopping brings is truly miraculous. I feel it every single day.

I fell in love with waking up with a clear mind and clear conscience every morning, not worrying about the drunk texts the night before, the deep and meaningful Facebook posts, and, yes, searching the brain bank for the latest stupid fight with the husband. What was it about? Should I still act mad or forget it all happened and hope he forgets, too?

It all adds up to my being proud of myself once again. To knowing I can do anything and conquer anything. I know the fight's not over, believe me, but I know I can beat this beast into submission and rise strong.

1jpr0ed,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Rosella_Tuffen/comments/1jpr0ed/horrible_ex_sisterinlaw_part_1/,Horrible Ex Sister-in-law Part 1,"Hello, listeners or readers. I have a true story for you that a friend of mine told me. I have most of the receipts that will be in text for privacy reasons. I also have permission from her to share it. Most of the texts have been gathered from the other members of the family and friends to put this together. I do apologize for how long it is, but I do hope you enjoy it. I will not be using real names for obvious reasons and decided to write this from her point of view. 

This all started at the beginning of 2024. My husband received some unfortunate news from his brother that required them to have a family meeting. His used-to-be sister(Verona) tried to say goodbye to this world.Not long ago, her fiance and her ended their engagement. We all tried our best to be there for her, but she was locked up and always in her room. 

Since she ended her engagement, she made the big step of moving out of her parents’ house into an apartment. Then, one day, my brother-in-law and his wife received a text from her. She took some pills (Tylenol, anti-depressants, and antibiotics for her cold sore on her lip) to self terminate, so she became worried for her life and wanted to live. So Bob(brother-in-law) and Em(his wife) took Verona to the hospital, and the doctors sent her to the mental hospital to help her. She asked Bob to take care of her cat while she was gone, then boom out of the blue she told him “Never mind” and they found out that she asked her manager to do it instead, which was weird.

 Now, at this meeting, we found out some very interesting information that Verona was having a weird relationship with her manager, who is also married and has three kids. They’ve been spending a lot of time together, texting 24/7, bringing her coffee, and taking her with him to a baseball game. In her words, they are just friends and she’s also friends with his wife, yet she spended most of her time with him only. When they transferred her to the mental hospital, they took her phone away so she couldn’t cause herself harm. She ended up throwing a tantrum because she wouldn’t be able to text this manager. 

In all of our opinions, we agreed that this relationship was very unhealthy and could lead to feelings that shouldn’t be there. So, we all decided to text Chad(the manager) on Bob’s phone, and this is how it went:

Us: “Hi Chad, this is Bob, Verona’s brother. I was wanting to speak to you about her and mainly your relationship with her. Verona is going through a lot in her life at the moment, and we have all noticed that your relationship with her is very unhealthy and unprofessional. She has grown an attachment to you that is not going to help her, especially that you are her manager and married with a family. 
We think it is best that you take some time to reflect on your relationship with her and the potential damage it is doing. She is young and confused, and she needs to find best friends that are her age, not her boss. I would appreciate if this conversation stayed between us and that you take our concern seriously.”

His response was: “Hi Bob, I understand the concern. Verona is actually friends with my wife as well. You are more than welcome to reach out to her as well. We all became very close recently. I do understand. Thank you for reaching out.”

Us: “I could understand a basic friendship with your coworker, but I need you to understand this is inappropriate. Verona only talks to you all day, every day, and that is truly not ok. She has pushed all her other friends aside, including her family, for your relationship. If you were a female, that would be one thing, but you are a male who she has an unhealthy bond with. She rarely even talks to your wife, and I think me and you both know that. I do not know what your true intentions are here, but it’s clearly beyond friendship at this point.” 

Him: “No intentions at all with her at all. But I understand. I will step away.”

Us: “Thank you for understanding. It’s going to take a while for us to get her back on track, and we’re only doing this because we care for her. Nothing personal against you.”

 Then, we discussed how we were going to be there for her and how we were going to support her.

She finally got out of the hospital and called Em to pick her up. Em made sure that she was okay, ready to be alone again and made a light suggestion to maybe move back in with her parents. She was insistent that she was going to be okay. She didn’t spend much time with any of us, but my husband put in the effort to invite her to places with us, but she always declined.

I didn’t mind it too much because, to be honest, I already didn’t like her. She seemed to hate the fact that her brother chose me as his other half. I also hated the way she always acted like such a holy person and would go off on anyone she would get a chance to. Always had a victim mentality and loved to lie. Now, don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t happy about her trying to commit suicide, so I wanted to put my dislike aside and be there for her.

One day, she showed up at her parents’ house so her brothers could change her tires. She was spending time with her sister Bianca. My husband and I, for our first year of marriage, built a tiny home in his parent's backyard, so when we heard she finally came over, we went to go see her. After no one was in the room except for Verona, Bianca, and me. I ended up asking her some questions about her relationship with her mom. Found out that she saw her mom as manipulative, wouldn’t let her breathe, and was too much for her. I found that shocking because she and her mom were like best friends; her mom was the sweetest thing out there. I also had a great relationship with her, so it confused me. When she left, I looked at Bianca and asked, “Is that how you also feel about your mom?” She looked at me and said, “Sometimes.”

Then, out of the blue, everyone was blocked, like every single one of the family members, including most relatives. Evelina(mother-in-law) was really upset and hurt. She put in most of the effort to try and contact Verona, but the responses she received were horrible. Evelina went through a lot of tears from what her daughter told her. She called her a horrible mother and said she was never there for her. Everything she texted her mom was inconsiderate and hurtful. When Evelina would stop texting her by Verona’s request, she would text her friend to make sure that she was doing okay. Verona didn’t like that very much and always complained. With this going on, Evelina ran to her kids. We were all mad about this situation and were there for her as best we could.

Now Bianca worked at a theme park, and sometimes I was asked to either drop her off or pick her up. So on this one particularly gloomy day when I was picking her up with my husband, she said, “Guess what, Verona texted me.” We were shocked; Bianca had the opportunity to go off on her for everything. Verona started texting Bianca more often after that, and it was absurd. 

She started badmouthing Evelina, my husband, their dad, their uncle, and worst of all, Em and Bob. Saying things like don’t be alone with any man, especially uncle, and don’t be alone with your brothers. Dad was a horrible father. That mom is just a horrible person, partially because she wasn’t there for her and kept it to herself, about that cancer and rape that Verona mentioned to her, to never trust mom with anything, etc. This wasn’t true; Evelina was trying her best, and we had receipts later. The reason none of us knew what happened is because Verona asked Evelina not to tell anyone. To not trust Bob or Em because they are horrible people, when asked, no reason was given. When Bianca asked her what sort of cancer she had, she said that she didn’t want her looking it up and then worrying about it. 

We found out from Bianca later that apparently, nobody liked Verona at work; she was always rude. The manager, on the other hand, cheated on his wife with a coworker. Everyone at work called him a walking red flag, and the two always ate lunch together. This came from Verona’s coworkers. 

Then Verona started making up random medical crap that made zero sense. She said that her doctors can’t find what’s wrong with her, so they will be cutting her open to find the issue. No doctor does that. Then, when Evelina heard that her daughter had cancer, she went to check her medical records. Weirdly enough, she found nothing to do with it, and her bloodwork was clean. Then when she was saying that she was raped by her uncle, at this point we didn’t know if we should believe her or not. 

Her uncle literally doesn’t need a woman for that reason anymore because his ding dong no longer works. So, it decided to work just to rape her? He has lived in their backyard for four years, so why now after four years he was like, “Let me repay my brother by raping his daughter.” Not long after we found out about the rape, Verona took the clothes from that day and went to report the rape to the cops. After receiving a court order, the uncle ended up talking to my husband’s older brother, Jack. He said what happened around that time was he went to go and put clothes in the washer since he didn’t have one. So, he knocked on her door to ask her to let him know when the clothes were done. When he got no response, he opened the door, but she was sleeping, so he left. That was the only time he was there when her parents were on vacation. After this incident, he bought his own washer so that this wouldn’t happen again.

Verona was telling her mom how she is seeing a therapist, and he said that she should be away from her family to heal because of everything they put her through and how they took her childhood away from her because she always had to babysit. She never really had to babysit her siblings, and from stories, she had a good childhood. Then boom, not too long after, she said she had a boyfriend. 
Now, out of the blue, she wants to meet with her family because she misses all of them and wants them to meet Ty, but under no circumstances does she wanna see Bob and Em. Why? We still to this day don’t know. She also mentioned how she wanted to see my husband and me before we moved but put in 0 effort to do that.

Evelina became excited because her daughter wanted to finally see her but was really nervous, so she and Bianca were begging us to come to make it less awkward. At this point, my husband and I couldn’t stand her, but I wanted to be there for them. Verona also had the audacity to text her mom, saying that if anybody was going to be disrespectful, they were going to leave. We showed up at the restaurant about 20 minutes earlier. Then we received a call from Bianca. Verona, her Royal Highness, has requested that we all dress fancy, which, since most of our things were packed, we showed up like homeless people with a smile.

Bianca was not ready to see this woman, so we snuck into the bathroom, and we felt so uncomfortable. After getting some air, we gathered up the courage and went to the table. I didn’t look at that b***h. I felt so sick sitting there with her acting as if nothing happened. My husband ordered food, but since my stomach was turning, I decided not to order anything. 

Verona ordered gluten-free food because her doctor prescribed it for her leukemia. I heard some of the conversation, but not all, and it all sounded like bs. She apparently quit her job because her doctor recommended it for her health. Her boyfriend Ty had cancer 5 times, did chemo, and is now healed. She praised her therapist, and he said that she could spend one last time with family before starting her healing journey. With her pretending like she did nothing wrong, I told my husband to give me the keys and that we should leave. He agreed. 

When he got to the car I started crying I couldn’t stand her acting as if nothing happened after making Evelina cry multiple times, bashing the whole family, accusing her uncle of rape, and making her dad run to alcohol because of it. I was SA as a kid so it hurt me that she was saying she was raped but her body didn’t give any signs of it. I remember how my body and mind reacted to it after it finally stopped, and she was showing no signs of it.

Evelina was excited that Verona had started texting her more and more. So, one day, Verona invited her mom over, and sneakily Evelina took Bianca with her. Bianca hated her at this point and wanted nothing to do with her, she didn’t like that very much. 

Since Evelina is a medical assistant, she ended up asking Verona to show her her prescription for her leukemia. She went to her cabinets with Ty whispering and looking for it. For some odd reason, all of a sudden, her prescription ran out, and they had already thrown the bottle away, so she needed to get more. SWEETHEART, YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS RELIGIOUSLY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON’T HAVE ANYMORE? 

Finally, Verona started telling Evelina and Bianca how she got raped. The location was constantly changing and not adding up. She said that he raped her in the kitchen, then changed it to the living room and last but not least her room. She also mentioned that he was sober. We all know how he is drunk and sober. There is no way he would do something like this sober, he doesn’t even touch you drunk. The youngest sister was home that day with Verona. Oddly enough, Luna didn’t hear anything happening. Verona said she didn’t scream because she didn’t want to traumatize Luna. 

At this point, all of the siblings were convinced she was lying about everything. We warned the parents to be very careful with her because we didn’t know what she might pull next. Evelina after hearing her daughter's story of rape convinced her husband to kick his brother out so Verona can be comfortable coming back and can trust them again. Around this time, my husband and I were starting our move across the country. After we settled down, we were kept informed on the situation there. 

Em talked with me, and I found out some hurtful information that made me worry about Bianca. Bianca was being physically and mentally abused by Verona. I noticed some signs of some sort of abuse, but I didn’t realize how bad it was. Bianca once told me how Verona was acting more like a mom than a big sister. If their mom would let Bianca do something, Verona would be strictly against it. I found this really weird. When I mentioned it to Evelina, she just brushed it off. Em told me the story that happened at a pool, how Verona practically tried to drown Bianca, and she had to run in and stop her. When I asked Bianca about how she felt at that moment, she told me that she was terrified for her life. This is when I started worrying about her safety.

Apparently, Verona made up the gluten-free crap. When she came to visit her parents, she got Jack in the box with a burger and fries. 

Later, Verona ended up having coffee with her mom, and Evelina completely changed after that. Then, not even a month later, after their uncle moved out, Verona decided that she wanted to move into the tiny home we lived in with her boyfriend and their 7 cats because they were looking for an apartment. Verona already didn’t have a job, and Ty soon followed in her steps; they were now working at Uber while he was looking for a job. Her mom suggested the tiny home, but she already talked with someone else about it. This person was not informed of this, though.

 We all had a meeting with parents, telling them and begging them not to let her move in. This was a horrible idea, but they fought against us and stood up for her. We then begged Evelina not to let Bianca be with Verona alone. She told us that they would not be in their house without them there, and that won’t be happening. Well, that was all a lie.

None of us felt heard after that meeting, and all of us poured our hearts out. Bianca cried, telling her parents how she couldn’t stand her and that she didn’t want to see her ever again. But they just kept on defending her how she’s their daughter, and we wouldn’t understand. We asked them if she even bothered to apologize and got no response. Now, the parents are religious, so living together before marriage is a no-go. So, we also said if she’s going to move in, it’ll have to be without him. The dad agreed to talk with her and make a deal, but whatever we said and the deal that was supposed to happen were all thrown out in the trash.

With this decision, we all saw where we stood. Bob and Em stopped coming over on Sundays, we stopped talking with the parents. Dad and Mom continued texting the kids that have moved, that they love us all equally. But Evelina added more to that: how we should forgive Verona and move on. It felt like we didn’t matter as much as she did. 

Then Bob received this text from Evelina: “Bob hello. We as parents are responsible for the psychological state of our minor kids(Bianca, Luna) and are begging to not discuss with them the decisions we made as parents and making them go against us. I hope you understand what I mean. Our home is open to all of the kids. We love you all.”

My husband also received a couple of messages from Evelina as well: “Zack. You may be sleeping right now. Just want you to know that I love you a lot, and Rose is my daughter too, and I love her too. I love everyone the same. Just when someone is broken, like Verona right now needs our help. It doesn’t mean we love her more. Did she hurt us- yes. Do we agree with her actions- no, do we approve of her living with Ty like she is- no. She is reaching out slowly to us, and we have to give shoulders to learn on, arms to hug her. God is answering our prayers. Yes, she hurt us. She knows that. She will talk when she is ready and healed. I hope you understand that we can not choose over our children, and we are not. At this moment she needs us the most and we must because we love her. She’s like the prodigal daughter, lost and returning to her parents. Just want to say that. I love you two very much and pray for you.”

And. 

“Dad talked to Ty and Verona Sunday evening. His relationship with her is serious. Dad told him that he wants them to get married. Verona said they already discussed that and are planning to do so. That’s in process. He told her that she needs to make peace with everyone, she knows that and praying about it, and she is asking to give her time. She will do that when ready. We are asking you to be patient. I am sorry if that is not what you want to hear. It is really hard for us parents right now, and this is where we are. They are moving in, and we did discuss boundaries- we are not going over to them without asking, and this applies to them too. If we are not home, they are not coming over, and if we are home and they need something or want to come over, they will need to ask. We are not choosing her over you guys. My heart is breaking into pieces.”
Jack’s birthday was coming up, and the family was planning on celebrating on a Saturday. Evelina decided to invite Verona and Ty, but since Verona didn’t want to see Bob and Em, Evelina took it upon herself to not even bother inviting them and sweep it under the rug. Verona and Ty had now replaced Em and Bob. Their feelings mattered more than the rest of the family. But Jack wanted to invite Bob and Em, so Evelina acted like she didn’t just try pulling the favorite card.

1jpqvjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1jpqvjf/santa_barbara_county_wine_trip/,Santa Barbara County Wine Trip,"We went to Santa Barbara wine country for a few days and I thought I would summarize my trip for anybody else that is going on there. One thing that stood out: I was shocked at how many people there were in each town. Santa Ynez (where we stayed) didn't have much of a town square, but it was so busy. Los Olivos was even more packed. 

Wineries:

Presqu'ile: 9/10 The wines were good (I really enjoyed their ""cold climate"" Syrah), but the real star of the show was their mezze picnic lunch. Wine would be 7/10, but the food brought the overall score up to 9/10. All the food was so good and some of the best of the trip. The view was also beautiful. Next time we are out this way, this is a place we will revisit. 

Stolpman: 7/10 These wines were good, but they didn't blow me away. For me, these are the bottles that I would open for a Tuesday night dinner with friends. Their Sangiovese was the highlight of the flight. The tasting patio was nice and well shaded. If you are going on a weekend do yourself a favor and get a reservation. They had to turn quite a few people away since they didn't have reservations and their tasting patio was full. 

Dragonette: 9/10 We did the production facility tour. The tour was finished with a flight. This was the best wine of the trip. Each wine had such unique expression and was well balanced. Their Chardonnay was a stand out for me as somebody who does not normally like oaked Chardonnay.  It was on the tour that I learned that they use new oak barrels to ferment their Sauvignon Blanc, which is something I had never heard before. Very interesting and delicious flight. I wouldn't mind going to their tasting room in Los Olivos on our next visit. 

Melville: 7/10 Wine flight was decent. There wasn't a wine I didn't like, but there weren't any stand outs either. 

Food:

Bells: 8.5/10 While my favorite food of the trip was one of their courses, some of the courses were just alright. Their walnut tart dessert with brie (not something I would usually order for a dessert), was by far, one of the best things I have ever had. Their steak au Poivre and Chickpea Panisse were not as flavorful as expected. I think I set my expectations a little too high for this place, but overall it was still good and I would recommend it.  

SY Kitchen: 8/10 The pasta here was good, but it didn't blow me away since I usually make fresh pasta at home and the taste was comparable. Their appetizers, specifically the burrata and prosciutto was very flavorful and another highlight of the trip. We would go back if we were in the area since we felt the price was reasonable and the food was good. 

Bar La Cote: 7/10 I'll be honest- this place let me down the most. I have heard so many positive things about this place. We got oysters (great), Caesar salad (worst thing I have ever had), focaccia (not great but not bad), branzino (SO good), and their ""snack pack"" for dessert (very good). Honestly the Caesar salad was so off putting that it took away from the rest of the meal. 

Bob's Well Bread Bakery: 8/10 Cute bakery that has really yummy baked goods. This was my favorite place to get coffee. 

La Paloma Cafe: 8/10 We stopped here on our way to Santa Ynez and it was an excellent choice. The patio area was lovely and their food was delicious. We particularly enjoyed their BBQ tri tip and their house pickles. We will be back the next time we fly into Santa Barbara.",2,1743606361.0,wine,2,1.0,False

It's frequent and often that I am sugar sensitive, and the standard amount of syrup pumps for iced coffees are sort of potentially borderline hyperbolically debilitating.

If I could have opened my eyes I would be seeing past lovers and new colors but I was too busy curling through a frothing coma on the floor. 

All's that to say, is there any way to get iced coffee with NO sweetener in it? On top of that, is it possible to get a 24oz iced coffee with one (1) single (1) pump of vanilla syrup so I don't accidentally ramp up thousands of uninsured dollars in resurrective hospital visits for daily hyperglycemic episodes? 

Looking at the screen in the store, I don't see any option for iced coffee without flavoring. I fear the worst (brewed sweetened). It only gives me hope that I see a no-sugar salted caramel option, but the fiendish ghoul in my mind wants to tiptoe the line of greed with tiny amounts of vanilla syrup only, if possible.

Im only writing this because im in desperate need of support and reassurance since my parents say: ""it can't be from quitting caffeine, it's all in your imagination"".

So I'm on my 44th day without caffeine and it has been a wild ride until now. First 30 days were absolute hell for me but let's take it from scratch.

I had been drinking coffee consistently for about 3 years. Jan 27th i decided to start drinking energy drinks along with my daily cup of black coffee to boost my gym performance. But before all that, i was already having a lot of caffeine or im just sensitive to it because i remember having dizziness, muscle twitching, weird eyesight (like loss of focus) and blood pressure flactuations throughout the day (which I don't have now after quitting) but i never thought caffeine was to blame so i kept drinking coffee.

One day I got back from the gym after a very intense cardio session and i had palpitations, dizziness, chest tightness, weird eye sight, my resting heart rate was 80 (mine normally it's 58-60) and i was feeling a sense of doom, i actually thought i was going to die. All that led to a panic attack. Days after i felt the same and then went to a cardiologist. He checked everything and said everything looks clear. That's when i decided to quit caffeine cold turkey.

For the first 2 weeks I had panic attacks and several anxiety attacks along with dizziness, muscle twitching, chest tightness, palpitations, vestibular migraines, flu like symptoms, increased resting heart rate, derealization, depersonalisation, weird eye sight, intrusive thoughts and generally i thought i was going to die so i convinced my parents to get a blood test. Turns out im perfectly okay, no health issues.

So now, on day 44, i still get mild chest tightness and my anxious intrusive thoughts come and go all the time. I also get mild tension headaches if i get too stressed and blurry eye sight. One moment im okay, next im afraid there's something wrong with me. My energy seems stable throughout the day and my sleep is improving. Hopefully my HR is back to normal and there's no more dizziness.

I never thought caffeine withdrawal would be this intense so this experience made me develop severe health anxiety. I'm getting better day by day tho.  My gym performance has increased and tbh i have more endurance now without caffeine. Im just tired of this back and forth. My anxiety spikes for no absolute reason especially in the morning hours immediately after waking up. Then after 2-3pm it stabilises. But even tho i know everything is about neuroplasticity and my body adapting to the loss of caffeine, i still get anxious and I can't calm my ass down. ",2,1743606304.0,decaf,6,1.0,False
1jpquih,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1jpquih/aiw_for_accusing_girlfriend_for_cheating_on_me/,AIW for accusing girlfriend for cheating on me? (Found pregnancy test final update),"Hope the mods will give me some slack as I just wanted to post an update to my previous two post as quite of few people were asking for an update. 

TLDR version: gf took trip to see male friend but I later find out that she secretly bought a pregnancy test. Later found out through text messages that she has sex with him while on the trip. 

So last night, I told my gf that I needed to talk to her. At first she kept saying she was busy but I insisted on seeing her in person so she finally said to go to her place around 8 pm. 

I go over and I reiterated how eversince she got back from her trip, things have felt weird. She claims I’m the one who’s making things weird by believing that she cheated on me. She continues to claim that the pregnancy test was not hers and that her friend Jesse was just a friend and they just hung out. I then proceed to tell her how I know she cheated because I saw the thread in her messages. 

“You came here without me knowing and went through my personal messages? That’s so messed up and creepy to be honest.” She says. We got into a slight argument as I told her that my suspicions were correct and she was trying to deflect the conversation. I asked her to give me her phone and I’ll show her all the messages I saw which were very clear and explicit. Of course she refuses and says “we are not married. We don’t live together. You don’t own or control me.”

While I agreed with her on that part, I decide to end things quickly and simply put her copy of her keys on her coffee table and tell her “you cheated. Plain and simple. Goodbye and good luck.” I walk out and she makes no attempt to stop me. 

Later, she tries to text me and says that she’s sorry for what she did. At first, she claimed that Jesse was an old boyfriend that she never told me about and that they dated years ago before she met me and that he moved away several years ago. She claims that the messages I saw were old conversations they had but I quickly told her that was obviously not true. She swears that she didn’t mean to cheat and that Jesse must’ve gotten her drunk and it lead to sex. She assures me that she is NOT pregnant with anyone’s baby. 

I told her “that’s good cause I don’t want anything else tying me to you.” I wished her good luck again and I haven’t heard from her since. 

Personally, I’m relieved but I’m so upset and devastated by all this. I spoke with my friend Eric who told me that he had an ex that cheated on him too but she later tried to contact him years later when the dude she cheated on him with turned out to be a bum. Hoping I can move forward from this. Thank you all for your input.

For context, I am a soccer player, I practice 2-4 times a week for about 2 hours. I know sweat build up causes acne but immediately after practice I shower thoroughly. For my skin care I use The Ordinary Acne Set. I use this set in the morning before school and at night before I go to sleep. Every day. I’d also like to point out that I am very clean when it comes to my face.  If anything or anyone touches my face,  I immediately wipe the area because I am scared of breaking out. For my diet, in the mornings I usually eat bread and drink a cup of decaf coffee. For lunch I usually skip that and have little snacks (jello, fruit) And for dinner I usually have something homemade like salmon, pasta, chicken, anything like that. Occasionally when I don’t have time to make food I get fast food but maybe once or twice a week. I know this is not the ideal diet but i wouldn’t say it is bad. Now for my skin, I have a pretty weird skin complexion. When it is clear and I have no acne, it looks good. I just have some tiny spots from the sun because my skin is sensitive to the sun. Same thing with my arms. But when I have acne, its usually around my jawline, chin, and upper lip/mustache area. The breakouts aren’t terrible but they are spread out. One or 2 on my left side of my jaw, maybe one on my upper lip area, one on the other side of my jaw, and recently ive been getting some on my lower cheeks. It doesn’t sound all that bad but  I am just not happy with my skin. I don’t  understand the reason for this breaking out. it has  been probably 2 or 3 weeks since i’ve had “clear” skin.  Every day I wake up with something new on my face. Im just looking for some advice and people who are going through something similar.

As a matter of fact I enjoy cold foam on hot coffee. BUT the difference with Starbucks unlike homemade coffee is that my coffee maker doesn’t get as hot as the ones at Starbucks. Therefore my cold foam takes longer to melt and I can just about immediately enjoy the cold/hot combination. But at Starbucks the foam is melted by the time my coffee has cooled enough for me to drink. 

So in short my choice of adding cold foam is an expectation vs reality moment. Same goes for the Cherry Crunch. ",0,1743606073.0,starbucksbaristas,15,0.13,False

In the last week and a half I have felt pretty horrible. I'm nauseous and have to keep taking Zofran more than I'd like, my stomach always hurts or feels uncomfortable, I'm consistently constipated, the last 2 days since my second shot I have been dealing with horribly uncomfortable bloating, gas, and constant burping, and I almost always have absolutely no appetite. Most days I eat a few crackers, maybe half a potato, and I drink coffee and water and electrolytes. The one time I felt hungry enough to have an actual meal I felt sick the next day, and I barely even ate! I really wanted to establish some sort of healthier eating while on Zepbound but I'm finding it hard to eat anything at all. I feel like I shouldn't be going entire days existing on just a few Saltine crackers. 

Does this ever get better? I knew my appetite would decrease but I didn't know I would barely be able to stomach any food. Sometimes I can't even get through my entire cup of coffee without feeling uncomfortably full. I guess I just want to see if anyone has experienced these types of side effects getting better as you continue with the shot. Like, will my body adjust at some point? At this moment I don't see myself upping my dose anytime soon since both shots left me feeling completely useless and worn out for upwards of 36 hours. Questioning if this is even worth it right now.

Crosses on every wall, velas burning for every problem, and don’t even think about questioning anything unless you wanted the mal de ojo from your mother or abuela.

I used to be that kid reading the Bible, trying to be “good,” thinking if I prayed hard enough, I’d be worthy of God’s love. But somewhere along the way, I started noticing something—the rituals, the prayers, the saints—it all felt familiar.

When I lit a candle to Saint Michael, wasn’t I already doing spell work? When my family prayed to La Virgen, weren’t we already honoring the divine feminine? When my abuela used an egg to “cleanse” someone’s bad energy, wasn’t that already brujería? When my abuela read the coffee grains in the cup, wasn’t that her practicing divination?

I realized that witchcraft wasn’t a rebellion—it was a return. A return to the spiritual practices that existed before colonization, before Catholicism was forced onto our people. A return to intuition, nature, ancestors, and spirit.

People love to say you can’t mix Christianity and witchcraft—but what do you think La Madama, Espiritismo, 21 Divisions and Santería are? Our people have been blending both for centuries. I didn’t leave the Bible behind—I just read it with new eyes.

1jpqnu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1jpqnu4/women_are_treated_like_shit_postpartum/,Women are treated like shit postpartum,"I came across a post made by my husband on a different group where he vented about how I regret motherhood and how because of this, it's negatively impacted our marriage. Everyone was very quick to jump on the postpartum depression bandwagon that he just needs to leave me and get out of our marriage. Very common comments were ""Get her to a doctor asap! She NEEDS help."" or ""You need to attend her next gyno appointment for her and make sure she brings up her mental health to her provider.""  or my favorite ""Postpartum depression isn't always depression! It can be in the form of regret or disliking of their own baby! Get her help immediately."" The way people talk about moms is scary and it's no wonder so many women don't get help or even voice how they feel. 



Do we ever stop to think that maybe some women realize the major sacrifices they have made that have now permanently not only altered their body, but also their lives? I'm so sick of people putting how I feel on postpartum depression or my hormones... My husband included. He told me the other day that he hopes my feelings towards our son will change once my hormones regulate back to normal... Here's some insight on my life and how it's changed since having our baby (2 months old now). 



I run my own business out of our home/property. I work roughly 12-16 hours a day every single day of the week. The original plan was that I would work and take care of the baby while my husband was at his job. Then when my husband would come home, he would take over with the baby stuff so I could finish working myself... That did NOT happen. Our son is very colicky, like terribly... My mom & sister both work professionally with kids aging from babies to toddlers and both have said he's extremely colicky and fussy. Each day I was struggling to get any work done as this baby would not stop crying! My husband asked his mom to move in to help with the baby. This way she could watch the baby while he was at work, I could also get my work done, and the baby's needs would be met. 



While I am grateful of the scarifies she has made to move in and help with her grandson, my home is no longer my own. I do not feel comfortable walking out in my underwear to make my coffee in the morning before a long day ahead of me. I can't have private conversations with my husband in regard of our son, our relationship, and my own personal life. I can feel her judgement when I go off into the bedroom to pump during the day as I will throw on a show and watch it while pumping. When I am working on my computer and not doing the physical aspect of my job, I can sense her judgement as I just ""sit around"". 



On top of my job, I am also the one caring for the home. My mother in law and husband do not clean... It's all left to me. I wake up in the morning and clean, work for 12-16 hours, and then clean again in the evening. It's never ending between a baby, my husband, my mother in law, and myself. I also am the one making sure our fridge is stocked with groceries, making sure we have diapers, wipes, and any basic necessities in the home. 



I work from sun up to sun down, I take care of the home, I have no privacy to live my life in my own home comfortably, I provide for every person in this house, I get constant judgement all the time because I'm not this wonderful, motherly instincts, nurturing mother and because I don't love my life with this baby something is wrong with me. 



Ask yourself, if you were living in my shoes, how happy would you truly be? Not everything is postpartum depression, sometimes it's actually just regret because you gave up EVERYTHING...",66,1743605867.0,regretfulparents,9,0.95,False
1jpqnld,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jpqnld/upgrading_from_delonghi_dedica_arte_to_breville/,Upgrading from Delonghi Dedica Arte to Breville Barrista Pro - is it worth it? [$800 CAD],"Hi everyone! We’ve been using a Delonghi Dedica Arte espresso machine for 4 years now. We are in Toronto and have been thinking about upgrading to Breville Barrista Pro lately with the Hudson’s Bay sale, and wondering if anyone from this community can share some insights.

My wife and I are daily coffee drinkers. Most of the time we make ourselves iced americanos in the morning so we have a coffee when we drive to work and at work. We make latte only occasionally - say around 10 times a year.

Our existing Delonghi machine seems to still function fine, but there are a few pain points:

1. We don’t have a coffee grinder at home, so every time when we buy a bag of beans we have to ask the shop to grind them for us. One bag of beans usually lasts 1.5 weeks, so beans are not as fresh towards the end of the bag which I suppose would be a bigger problem with beans that were ground and just sitting there for a week or so.

2. We buy the same beans from the shop which they use to brew their coffees. When we buy iced americanos from them and compare to the ones we make at home, we can taste the difference - the ones we make at home are not as flavourful. From my observation, the espresso we make ourselves are in a bigger volume vs what our regular coffee shop makes, which gives me the impression that ours are diluted. We tried asking for a smaller grind size from the coffee shop, but often it jams our machine, so it looks like it’s already the finest size it can handle.

Breville Barrista Pro looks appealing to us, and it has a built in grinder which ticks one of the boxes. But the grinder alone doesn’t justify the purchase - we can probably invest in a standalone grinder instead which will cost less. I guess our questions are:

1. Is there a significant improvement in the brew quality by upgrading from Dedica Arte to Barrista Pro? Given our (failed) experience with finer grind size, I tend to think that our existing espresso machine is the limiting factor here.

2. How is the grind quality with Barrista Pro’s grinder? I’ve seen people saying that the burr getting worn out after 3 years. Is it just a part that has to be frequently replaced?

3. Given that we are often in a rush in the mornings, does grinding coffee at home really make sense for us? Do I have to be there administering the coffee grinding process or can I do other things (feed the dog, make breakfast, etc.) while it’s grinding?

Thanks for reading this. Any advice is appreciated!",1,1743605851.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1jpqn65,https://www.reddit.com/r/YetiCoolers/comments/1jpqn65/confused_about_max_temperature/,Confused about max temperature,"So, I saw this FAQ about temperature on Yeti's website. I recently bought the 10oz rambler cup (this one: https://www.yeti.com/drinkware/tumblers/21071505462.html) with magslider lid. Does this mean I can't use any boiling water for tea (100C) in my rambler? Since it says max 85C for coffee...

Thank you! 😊

If I take it first thing in AM on an empty stomach is usually works enough to get me up and starting my day + a couple hours of solid work

Recently my Dr and I decided to add guanfacine to help with anxiety (tried Zoloft earlier in the year and had bad side effects) 

I started guanfacine ER a little over 2 weeks ago w 1mg and upped to 2mg last week 

I noticed a difference the very first day I took 1mg - less anxiety more clarity - and overall I would say I haven’t felt crazy anxious… sure I have ruminating thoughts but not to the point of it paralyzing me. No bad chest pain, etc 

But now I feel like the stimulants BARELY work. I have been laying in bed for nearly an hour. I took my adderall 40 min ago hoping it would get me up, but I just want to keep laying here 

Same thing yesterday- I took on an empty stomach in early afternoon and then ate eggs and coffee and I basically had to lay down and rest/close my eyes

I get about 8 hrs of decent enough sleep at night that I shouldn’t be super exhausted

Is this common when adjusting to guanfacine? Like maybe after a month it will balance better with my adderall? Or is it common to increase the stimulant dose to counter the calming/drowsy effects of guanfacine? ",1,1743605691.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

I had no idea AP was real and just how awesome it felt and how much more of the world it opened up.   
  
Anyway I've been looking more and more into it over the last few weeks, having successfully projected multiple times already but not as often as I'd like. I keep successfully managing every 10-14 or so days. Sometimes several days in a row, sometimes just one off where I just become aware for a few seconds but wake up immediately. Still figuring things out. 

Anyway today I managed to AP again with the intention of learning how to get better at AP. And the person I was talking to in my projection said what my brain interpreted as thistle. It was a bit hard to understand the conversation so I started asking about a bunch of other things like coffee and cocoa etc. But the main thing that stuck was thistle. So upon awakening, I looked into what thistles actually do for the human body and apparently they boost brain power, on top of being anti inflammatory. I suspect this was maybe a very personal recommendation because I have chronic inflammation due to tonsillitis and sinusitis.

So my question is, does anyone else have any kind of research or experience that suggests boosting brain function naturally is a good way to induce more AP? ",2,1743605442.0,AstralProjection,0,1.0,False

Next to me sat a taped up box that contained the last of my dead wife's possessions. Literally the last. Her book that had been propping up a table. Her necklace I uncovered in the garden. 

My breathing stopped. A tall gray-haired man stooped to enter the doorway. He saw me, wrinkled his nose, then strode towards me like an looming shadow. He sat across from me. 

'Mr Burrs?' I croaked. 

His baleful eyes searched around me before fixing themselves on my box. 

'It's all there?' His voice was clipped. Posh.

'Yes.'

'Even the piece of...?' His pale eyes finally met mine.

My insides trembled, but I kept a poker face.

'Yes - a lock of her hair.' 

He studied me closely before he leaned back in his seat, satisfied. 'I knew you could find something,' he sneered. 'Even if it has been....'

'12 years'

'12 lost years,' he corrected me heavily. He suddenly stood up, reached his long, spindly arms over the table and snatched up the box from my side. 'But she's mine now, or at least she soon will be,' he spat. Then he spun around and stalked off towards the entrance. 

I shakily sipped my coffee. I felt the other diners staring at me. 



Weeks passed. My house felt extra quiet. Even quieter than it had been for the past 12 years. 

I awoke one midnight to the sound of my doorbell ringing. Again and again.

As I stumbled down the stairs in my new silk robe, my legs almost completely gave way when I saw a blonde, female head through the frosted glass of my front door.

'H - Hello?'

I jumped as a male voice answered - posh, clipped and angry. 'Good evening, Mr Thompson.'

'Mr Burrs?' I yelped. 

'You know why I'm here, Mr Thompson,' said the silhouetted female head.

Guilt bloomed in my stomach, even as I jerkily shook my head.

'That wasn't your wife's hair, Mr Thompson! And thus these - things - are not fit brides for me.'

'I got confused! I'll give you your money back! Wait - brides?' Horrified, I watched as 3 more identical blonde women appeared on my doorstep.

'You're a liar, Mr Thompson,' they all snarled now in awful, mechanical unison. 'And you still owe me a piece of Janine.'

The first women suddenly held up what looked to be a shovel.

Hey MaximizeMe friends,

So here's the deal – I’m all about juggling life like a pro, but *spoiler alert*, sometimes I've been more of a circus clown than a ringmaster 😅. Anyone else feel like they're riding the hamster wheel of productivity without actually getting anywhere? I used to think I was rocking the whole time management game with my trusty time blocking technique. But one fine day, it hit me: was I time blocking...or just lining up my distractions neatly in a row? 🤔

**Flashback to my “Aha!” moment:**

There I was, looking at my oh-so-organized calendar. Everything was blocked to perfection. Meetings ✅ Gym time ✅ Creative writing chunk (ha! more like “staring blankly at a screen”) ✅. But despite all this glorious planning, I was feeling more like I was running on ice – lots of movement, not much forward thrust.

And then, the 5-minute change happened. Yup, that’s all it took to turn my chaos into calm.

**Here’s what flipped the switch:**

- **Identify the time vampires**: You know them – those sneaky little tasks that pretend to be harmless but actually suck your time like they’re on a tight deadline themselves. Make a list of your biggest offenders.
  
- **Prioritize like a boss**: It sounds basic, but hear me out. I wasn't prioritizing my blocks based on energy levels. Morning me is like a fresh cup of coffee, while afternoon me is more like decaf. Flip the script and plan creatively demanding tasks when you're most alert.
  
- **The 5-Minute Preview**: Before diving into a time block, take 5 minutes to clearly define the ONE thing you aim to achieve in that session. Visualize it. Feel it. Blur the rest. Trust me, this tiny pause is a game-changer. Sets the vibe like no other.
  
- **End with a ‘what’s next’ check**: Don’t just wander into your next shot of time; step into it with your eyes wide open. A 2-minute look ahead can be like turning on the GPS (no more wrong turns).

And there you have it – my 5-minute fix that somehow, magically, gave me back 10 hours of my week. Who knew being on top of your schedule could feel like rehearsing for a thriller rather than a slapstick comedy?

Now, I’m curious about how you all manage your time. Found any sneaky tricks or hit any roadblocks? Let’s swap stories and maybe, just maybe, uncover another life-altering 5-minute tweak!

For various reasons, we want to do this as a trial for one year and to make sure it’s a good fit. In case, as Thomas Wolfe says, “you can’t go home again.” 

I’ve read through some similar threads and Worthington stands out as the ideal place for us. Our criteria are 1) good schools 2) a community feel with a neighborhood where kids play 3) at least some walkability to parks, coffee, stores, etc. 

The question comes down to this: if we manage to find a rental in Worthington, and love it, is there a chance we will be able to buy in the same neighborhood? I can tell inventory is restricted there but I would strongly prefer not to move the children’s school twice. I am open to Upper Arlington or Dublin where it looks like there is a lot more inventory. But how well would it give us the same vibe? Is there an area we could find a similar feel to Worthington?

---

Hello all! I recently received a [Krups Virtuoso+](https://www.krups.co.uk/ESPRESSO-MACHINES/TRADITIONAL-ESPRESSO-MACHINES/Krups-Virtuoso-XP442C40-Pump-Espresso-Coffee-Machine--Stainless-Steel/p/8010001076?superCategoryCode=espresso-machines) as a gift, and I’m struggling to get a decent cup of espresso out of it.

Let’s first address the elephant in the room: I’m well aware that this is a very basic, limited, and low-end machine. It was a gift from my wife, who was really happy that she finally got me that espresso machine I always wanted, and since I love her to pieces, I’m determined to make the best of it.

With that out of the way, here’s my question: how can I get a decent cup of coffee?

For those unfamiliar with the machine, it has a one-button press for one or two cups. The only thing I can adjust is how long it runs. The manufacturer suggests 7 grams of coffee for the single-cup basket and 14 grams for the double-cup basket.

I went to the local coffee shop and bought a medium-roast coffee, ground for espresso (which may have been a mistake). I read the [How to Dial In Espresso: The Basics](https://espressoaf.com/guides/beginner.html#how-to-dial-in-espresso-the-basics) from Espresso Aficionados, added 14 grams of coffee to the double-cup basket (as per the manufacturer’s instructions), and ran the machine until I got ~32 grams of espresso (trying to get close to the 1:2 suggested ratio). It was awful.

I ran several other tests, trying to keep the extraction time between 25 and 35 seconds and the ratio between 1:2 and 1:2.5, but no matter what, the shots taste very sour. I’m using filtered water and preheating the machine for about 15 minutes. My very limited understanding suggests that I’m under-extracting.

After some reading, I learned that these machines come with a pressurized portafilter and baskets, so a very fine grind may not be ideal. Should I ask the shop to grind it closer to drip coffee next time?

With the tools I have at my disposal (the machine, coffee, and a scale), what can I do to get a decent cup of coffee? Maybe add more coffee in the basket to slow down the flow? Tamp harder?

Any hints, suggestions, or tips would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you for reading this far!

---

Moving forward, I think there are some things I can change. After some research, I narrowed it down to three key areas: the portafilter and baskets, the grinder, and the steam wand.

**Portafilters and Baskets**

My understanding is that bottomless portafilters and good baskets are crucial for a proper extraction. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any compatible portafilter for this machine (at least based on the specifications). There are a few threads in this subreddit asking the same question, but with no answers. It looks like it uses a 52mm portafilter, which seems unusual?

This is where I think I will have the hardest time: getting a compatible portafilter. I am completely unsure which locking system/standard the machine uses, and I have no idea how to search for a compatible replacement.

**Grinder**

This seems to be as important—if not more important—than upgrading the portafilter. I’m looking to get a decent entry-level grinder in the future. After some consideration, I think I’ll go with the MiiCoffee DF54. It has good reviews, is within my budget, and could potentially solve my grind-size issues.

**Steam Wand**

This isn’t directly related to the coffee itself but rather to fun drinks like lattes, cappuccinos, and latte art. The stock wand produces too much foam. Has anyone successfully removed it without damaging the attachment? I removed the cover/cap, but beyond that, it seems to be screwed into the wand, and I couldn’t remove it at all.

Thanks again!

As the carpet has dried, there is a dark stain emerging. 

Any advice on how to best get rid of the stain? Thank you!",1,1743604661.0,CleaningTips,3,1.0,False

I struggle with  becoming overwhelmed reading complex information, and I've been trying to create my schedule of loss for the last week without success. I've read quite a few guides but the information I need seems of be spread out all over the place and I can't make it make sense. (I have some issues which impact my ability to digest information and become anxious etc)

Summary 

Job: hospitality, short tenure - 6 months, employed as a supervisor
Hours/Pay: no set hours as such, fluctuated due to business need. Pay in statement of terms/contract was £11.88 but verbally agreed on £12 once I disputed this and was paid £12 (evidence on payslips)

Issues:
1a) Fired almost exactly one year ago by the owner, but not communicated to that I was fired. Owner simply stoped talking to me, changed the group chat and told everyone at work not to talk to me. A colleague sent a screenshot of new group chat with him saying 'she doesn't work here anymore'. To this day has never officially fired me. No paperwork
1b) This happened on the same day I didn't come in due to back pain. The day I didn't come in I contacted the supervisor who was opening the premises that day and she confirmed she didn't need me in as there were barely any bookings and would manage without me 
1c) I had never had any warnings, conversations, disciplinaries or anything of that nature 

2) paid less than male supervisor despite me having a more complex list of duties. These duties are not specifically laid out for either myself or the colleague however we both were employed as a supervisor on the same premises by the same company. 
2a) We both had the same responsibilities: opening and setting up premises. Making and serving hot drinks and bar beverages. Stocking up and serving food. Taking orders and cash handling and general bar duties. On top of this I was responsible for booking entertainment, replying to customer and supplier correspondence, creating staff rotas, creating menus and other artwork, printing, social media management. The colleague never did these jobs. He did work more hours than me but was inflexible and had set hours and did not undertake additional duties mentioned above.
2c) in the reply from the employer he said I was paid less because I was 'less experienced and worked less hours' and denied gender discrimination. The facts are we both did the same work under the same job title but I did additional tasks. Respondent made a comment I believe may have shot himself in the food a bit saying the male employee had more experience in making coffee which was what his main job was. I feel this supports my claim that he did not work a role that was worth more money than I did.

3) I am disabled. I have a spine disease and fibromyalgia. The owner who fired me and had final say on everyone's wages said he didn't know this. He had a self employed contractor who was responsible for setting everything up and employing everyone. He was the person who provided the statement of particulars etc and discussed rates of pay. He also knew about my health issues. Because I didn't come in that day due to being off with my spine condition, and having never had any conversation about any other concerns, and was subsequently 'fired', I ascertained that I was fired due to disability discrimination. This was denied by the owner.
3a) the claim the owner has come back with is that he did not know I was disabled and that he did not fire me for this reason
He subsequently claims I was fired for essentially being lazy and horrid and has made up lots of  absolutely false claims I was appalled to hear. (Sits around all day doing nothing, doesn't turn up to work but doesn't tell anyone she's not coming, manipulates and belittles staff, makes staff and customers uncomfortable, refuses to do certain tasks) 

4) no accumulated holiday pay has ever been paid. I didn't work many hours and I believe it was all 0 hour contracts.

5) he deducted tax and NI from my pay which is evidenced on my payslips but be has never informed HMRC of my working there and never paid them those deductions. I can't claim ESA contributions based as I haven't paid enough contributions but I'm unsure if the NI contributions he should have paid would have made a difference or not. Prob not as it wasn't a long tenure but I've had to call Hmrc frequently to try to find out how to obtain my tax back. I was taxed by employer (not HMRC) at basic rate but I didn't earn anywhere close to the tax threshold to have been taxed to begin with.

6) he has not returned the remote for a plug in radiator I lent him but cannot work it without the remote.

7) be ignored my grievance letter, apart from giving me a P45 when I mentioned it was a legal requirement to have one. The figures on it are incorrect. It states I earned less and paid less tax than I did. I have payslips and statements from my bank.

8) he assassinated my character with false claims that have really upset me as detailed above. Part of my claim was that I had to work many hours out of my own time, outside of scheduled hours because I had too much to do in my work time to do admin most of the time so I spent many evening hours doing artwork and social media and booking bands etc..he claimed that I only had to do it outside of hours because I did nothing in hours but also that I was never asked to do those things anyway. There was nobody else to do those tasks but they needed doing and the the other supervisor didn't so I had to pick up the slack.

9) I had to step up as assistant manager when the self employed contracter mentioned above left due to business need. I still did not receive a payrise so I was still below he male supervisor. Also this sort of contradicts his claim that I was such a bad member of staff. After this, the owner reduced everyone's wages - apart from the male supervisor, another young male member of staff and a young female member of staff who be showed preference for since the start and has subsequently been rumoured to be in a physical relationship with (conflict of interest but I can't prove this) 
9a) I didn't consent to reduce my wages. This was never written on any paperwork. Never asked to sign anything etc.
9b) he claimed he reduced my wages because of the above reasons regarding me being a bad worker and having to cover shifts. None of these were ever mentioned until he replied to my tribunal claim. (Also those claims were untrue) He claims he didn't reduce those people's wages because they were exceptional and never late etc. I was never late and I had more responsibility than them. He didn't reduce the male supervisor wage because the employee said he would leave and he was the predominant weekday pub opener and couldn't be spared. He reduced everyone else's because he said he wasn't making enough money. I didn't receive any of that in writing and I don't have it in writing that be said it was because he wasn't making enough.

10) never given any info of a pension scheme 
Some small pension deductions have been taken. Never given any tips etc

11) he's intimidating, aggressive, has previously spoken about beating up the ex contractor, has banned staff from talking to ex employees, threatening demeanour 

12) he claims the contract/statement of particulars has a forged signature of his on it and said in his claim that it must have been the contractor. It was an elec signature, but he's using this claim to dispute that he reduced my pay and I should have been paid my contacted amount. Like saying well I never agreed to pay her this much anyway. The contractor was employed to carry out those duties for him and had permission to negotiate pay, plus it has been verbally confirmed that each and anytime a staff member was paid the contractor had to get the owner to make a manual payment from his phone using his face or fingerprint recognition so he was aware of wages and approving them. (He is very funny about money and so there's never been freedom to managers etc to pay who needs to be paid)

It's an Absolute Banger of an Album.","So I am 38. I have been listening to FOB since they first came around in 2003 with Take This To Your Grave. The songs that hooked me into them were ""The Patron Saint of Liars and Fakes"", ""Chicago is So Two Years Ago"", Sophomore Slump or Comeback of the Year"", and ""Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying"".

When ""Infinity on High"" came out in 2007, I was in college and it was one of those albums I had on all the time. All. The. Time. My single favorite Fall Out Boy lyric comes from ""The (After) Life of the Party"" with the second time it is sung in the song:

""I'm a stitch away from making it  
And a scar away from falling apart, apart  
**Blood cells pixelate and eyes dilate**  
Kiss away young thrills and kills on the mouths of all my friends""

Everytime I hear it, it just fuckin rocks.

So, this saying, ""Infinity on High"" for me, is an all-timer. It is a 5-star listen to me. 

I say this to say, ""Folie a Deux"", if not better than ""Infinity on High"" is just as good on every level. I remember when it came out driving around L.A. (where I was living at the time) windows open, just enjoying the shit out of the album. It brings me back to warm days and palm trees when I hear: 

""I'm coming apart at the seams  
Pitching myself for leads in other people's dreams...""

The music, flow, style, and lyrics of the album show another level of growth to the band after ""Infinity on High"" being a watershed moment for them. In my mind, it is one of the best back-to-back album runs by any band in the past 25 years. 

Fav songs on the album: ""Disloyal Order of the Water Buffaloes"", ""America's Sweethearts"", ""The (Shipped) Gold Standard"", ""(Coffee's for Closers)"", and ""Headfirst Slide into Cooperstown on a Bad Bet"". 

I don't think there is a bad song on the album. For a record that is slightly over 50 minutes with 13 songs, every single song, just as with ""Infinity on High"" is stacked. 

That's all. Just wanted to sing its praises. Also, if you have any album recommendations (any genre, year, artist) please share.

My practice cake came out okay, but the frosting didn't come out as vibrant as I'd like, especially the black, which came out very light and gray. 

Does frosting need time for the color to really set it? Should I make it in advance or something?

Is there a trick to getting frosting to be black? I already tried adding a couple drops of each primary color, but it didn't quite do the trick. Or a certain brand of black food coloring you recommend? How can I get these colors to pop a bit more? I'll be making at least one more practice cake before the big day. 
I'd love to get the pink, blue and purple a little brighter too. I was thinking using a bit more dye and maybe a drop or two of a deeper shade?

I'm working with boxed cakes, but I'll be making a buttercream frosting and cream cheese frosting from scratch. For the party, I'll be making chocolate, vanilla and carrot cakes, not sure if that makes a difference, but just in case. 

Could I add some cocoa powder to the frosting for the chocolate cake to darken it? I'm stumped for the vanilla and carrot cake. I was considering a coffee buttercream frosting for the vanilla cake and then cream cheese frosting on the carrot cake.

1jppycs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1jppycs/kendu_the_community_that_doesnt_sleep/,Kendu - The Community that Doesn't Sleep,"**Kendu Introduction**

Kendu is a completely organic memecoin that is on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.  
Kendu is over a year old with an ATH of 283 million and Kendu has went through several redistribution periods.  
Kendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe... I mean that should tell you a lot. Certik is a very reputable, crypto security platform, Kendu got an A rating which is insanely good.  
Kendu is more than a memecoin, we are a BRAND.

Kendu has a heavy focus on IRL products and events which I am covering below!!!

**Current market conditions**

This is for sure worse than we expected at this point in the year, it is April tomorrow and things are well for lack of a better word….. fucked. However “All Things Must Pass” (I hope someone gets this reference) and things will get better, the cycle looks delayed but no one really knows. I believe 100% that there is a bull run coming and even if not, Pepe achieved a market cap of 11 billion without a bull run and Kendu can too. There is far more money in crypto now, so 11 billion mc is equivalent to probably double that now and 20 billion is a 2000x from here for Kendu.

In terms of the market:

As Satoshi Nakamoto said “If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.”

However I will try and convince you to buy Kendu :)

**Why Kendu is organic**

Kendu is organic because organic memecoins tend to generate more results, whilst KOL based memes have a ceiling, organic memecoins are decentralised. Example of organic memecoins are Pepe, Doge and the one and only Shib.

Shib went from 22 million market cap to 22 billion market cap in 36 days, you could have turned $1000 to $1,000,000 in 36 days.  
Current market cap is not the most important, since crypto moves so fast.

**The Kendu Brand**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.

Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far

Kendu was very recently at Miami Music Week, where we have given a few thousand energy drinks out, Kendu cocktails(cocktails made with Kendu Energy), merch and I am pretty sure a new mural

From India to Miami. Kendu is truly global

Kendu also has many tattoos, which show ultimate levels of conviction, Kendu has overtaken people's lives and is not to be missed out on. In my opinion at least put $50 in Kendu. This could buy you a new BMW or Mercedes in the future.

I want to sincerely wish everyone good luck for the bull run, no matter whether you are in Kendu or not :)

Always remember, to never bet against a community

After living in De Pijp for four years, my partner and I were looking for a more affordable rental, and that’s how we ended up in this charming neighborhood (near the intersection of Wognummerstraat and Kwadijkerstraat). Now, just a year later, we’re already thinking of buying a home here. Initially, we were a bit skeptical, but honestly, living here has been an absolute delight.

The neighborhood has a great mix of young professionals/families and real Amsterdam locals, creating a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. Almost everyone has a garden, and people genuinely seem happy here. That said, if you’re looking for a highly diverse area, this might not be it—most residents are quite similar in (white) background.

# What to do?

* Take a stroll down the picturesque Nieuwendammerdijk;
* Grab a beer at Cafe 't Sluisje or a coffee at Liever hier;
* Dock a boat in the stunning local harbor and enjoy the peace and quiet; and
* Reach Amsterdam-Noord hotspots like Skatecafé, Europizza and Goudfazant in just a few minutes by bike

Despite the serene vibe, the rest of Amsterdam is easily accessible. You’re only 5-10 minutes away from the Noord/Zuid metro line, which takes you across the city in no time. The Oostpont ferry is also close by, but even without public transport, you can reach the rest of the city effortlessly. A scenic ride along the Schellingwouderdijk (which is also absolutely stunning, by the way) gets you to Badhuis in Oost within 10-15 minutes on an e-bike.

We’re now seriously considering buying a house here. The price per square meter seems to be still significantly lower than in other parts of the city, yet you get a multi story-house with a sunny garden - something that’s becoming rare in Amsterdam for 500-550k. However, I expect prices could be rising, especially with the city just announcing the high-end construction plans in the nearby Hamerkwartier AND that the first real bike bridge over the IJ will open in 2034 right on this side.

So, this post is both a tip and a question—have you ever been to Tuindorp-Nieuwendam and the Nieuwendammerdijk? If not, you really should! And for internationals like me, this area is a fantastic discovery, especially now with the spring weather.

I’m a long time lurker of this sub but I’ve never had the guts to post. I’m in a bad place and I hope you good people can help. 

My husband and I have been married for ten years. We’ve had a very happy marriage. We just moved into a new house in January. 
My husband started acting very strange around October last year. He was making himself look nice going into work, started wearing aftershave and working out. He then told me he had asked to move department as wasnt getting on with his boss and wanted a change. I thought this was very strange, but since we had a happy married I didn’t consider it anything other than strange, and I think in my head I was turning a blind eye to his behaviour. I was also dealing with the house move and I was under a lot of stress packing, moveing and getting the new house sorted. In February we had a big argument over something very silly and he blurted out during it that he had a crush on his coworker because “I wasnt giving him the attention he needed”. She worked at this new department and he wanted to change so he could see more of her. He said he knew he was wrong and couldn’t handle the guilt, so had to tell me. He’d also cancelled the change of department. 

I kicked him out of our house and he went to live with his mom. The pain was and still is a torment, and I never ever thought he’d do something like this. 

He swears he never slept with her or did anything outside of work, but he thought she was attractive and she was speaking with her and he was in with a chance, before he seen sense. I’ve looked this woman up on facebook and she has a husband and little children. Do I belive my husband? Yes I do. As much as he is an arsehole, I can tell when he’s lying and I dont think he has slept with her. At his mums, he’s really tried to make it up to me and I admit recently I’ve been going out for coffee with him. He tells me all the right things and cries and says he hates himself. I dont know what I want to do. I dont know if I’m being dramatic or overreacting or what. I also dont feel like I can tell many people about what’s happened, so I dont really have people to talk to. All I know is that I’m hurting and betrayed. 

However, yesterday when I met he broke down and said that his work is undergoing a whole restructure and now the woman is moving to his department (I seen the work email confirming the merge on his work phone so I know this is true) He said he knows how this is going to hurt me but he needs to tell me - he was very upset about it and panicking as he told me. He doesn’t feel he could get a new job quickly or for the same pay. I tend to agree with him based on the current job market. 

While trying to work all this out, the last thing I need is for him to be working in the same department as this woman, I cant handle it. 
I told him I couldn’t speak to him anymore and I left. His mum phoned me later than night and (she very nice about it) to tell me my husband was having a panic attack about it as he thinks he’s lost me. She was hoping I would at least speak to him to calm him down for the night, but I said I couldn’t. 

Does anyone have any advice for me? I am lost and I dont know what to think. I dont know if I’m overreacting. Thank you so much. ",15,1743603954.0,survivinginfidelity,11,0.95,False

1jppsy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UselessStories/comments/1jppsy9/i_tried_to_go_viral_on_tiktok_and_ended_up/,I Tried To Go Viral on TikTok and Ended Up Becoming a Meme (and Losing My Left Sock),"Okay, so picture this: I’m a 28-year-old man, and my idea of a good time is watching YouTube videos about TikTok trends while eating cereal at 2 PM. But then one day, I decided, ""Hey, why not *become* the trend?"" So, I made a decision: I was going to make a TikTok so funny, it would break the internet. Spoiler alert: it broke *me*.

Step one: I needed something outrageous to start my masterpiece. After an hour of thinking (and scrolling through memes), I stumbled upon a ""dance challenge"" where you make weird arm movements while hopping in place to some overly dramatic pop song. Perfect.

Step two: I needed a prop. Nothing screams TikTok content like a random object with no context. After raiding my house, I found it — an inflatable flamingo pool toy. I don't even have a pool, but I thought it was the funniest thing in my living room, so why not use it?

Step three: The performance. I put on my brightest hoodie, the one with a picture of a sloth doing yoga (which, looking back, was clearly a mistake). I set my phone up on a tripod, hit record, and began my dance routine with the flamingo under one arm.

Things started off fine, or at least I thought they did. I was hopping around, swinging the flamingo like a maniac. But then, as I tried to spin and throw the flamingo in the air (for no reason, mind you), I completely lost control of it. It flew across the room, smacked my coffee table, and knocked over a vase full of fake flowers. But I was committed, so I kept going — hopping and flailing around like a possessed kangaroo.

Then, at the *climactic* moment of the dance, where I was supposed to do some dramatic move with my hands, I tripped on the rug (why do rugs even exist?), face-planted onto the floor, and somehow... lost my left sock. The sock just disappeared. Gone. I don't know where it went. It vanished into the ether of my living room like a sock Houdini.

But wait, it gets better. As I lay there in pain (and socklessness), my phone continued to record. I wasn’t even sure if the video was still on or if I’d somehow accidentally live-streamed my failure. Regardless, I posted it, fully expecting nobody to see it.

Fast forward a few hours. My phone starts blowing up. People were *dying* over my “flamingo disaster,” and my sockless fall became its own meme. I became *the guy who lost his sock* on TikTok. People even started making remixes of my flop, with my faceplant turned into a dance beat. It got so out of hand that a *sock company* reached out to sponsor me. Apparently, I was now ""the sockless hero"" of TikTok.

In conclusion: I didn’t become a viral dance sensation, but I did become a meme. And, more importantly, I still don’t know where my left sock went. It’s probably somewhere in a parallel universe, living its best life.

Moral of the story: Never attempt a TikTok dance with an inflatable flamingo if you're not prepared to lose a sock... or your dignity.",1,1743603735.0,UselessStories,0,1.0,False

1jppqfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineTherapyAdvice/comments/1jppqfq/is_online_therapy_right_for_you/,Is Online Therapy Right for You?,"So, you’ve heard about [online therapy](https://therapyrank.com/calmerry) and are wondering if it’s the right fit for you. You’re not alone—more and more people are turning to online therapy as a way to get the help they need without all the hassle of traditional in-person sessions. But is it really for you? Let’s break it down.

# What Is Online Therapy, Anyway?

Online therapy (aka teletherapy or e-therapy) is basically therapy, but you do it over the internet. Instead of sitting in a therapist’s office, you chat with them through video, phone calls, or even text messages. It’s flexible and convenient, and it’s opening up a whole new world of options for people who might not have access to in-person therapy.

# Who Can Benefit from Online Therapy?

Online therapy isn’t just for one type of person. It’s a great option for:

* **Busy People**: If you’re juggling work, school, or family, online therapy lets you squeeze in a session without driving across town.
* **People in Small Towns or Remote Areas**: If finding a good therapist nearby is tough, online therapy connects you to a ton of options—no matter where you live.
* **Social Anxiety or Shyness**: If you’re nervous about face-to-face sessions, talking to a therapist from the comfort of your home can feel way less intimidating.
* **Anyone Who Needs Flexibility**: Whether you want to text, call, or do a video session, online therapy gives you choices that traditional therapy just can’t match.

# How Does Online Therapy Work?

It’s pretty simple. You sign up on an online therapy platform and choose the type of therapy that works best for you—whether it’s live video chats, phone calls, or texting. [Some platforms](https://therapyrank.com/calmerry) even let you message your therapist between sessions, which is awesome when you need a little extra support.

# What Are the Pros of Online Therapy?

1. **It’s Super Convenient**: No more driving to a therapist’s office or taking time off work. You can schedule sessions whenever it works for you.
2. **You Can Do It From Anywhere**: Whether you’re at home, in a coffee shop, or on vacation, therapy is just a click away.
3. **You Can Be More Comfortable**: Let’s face it, some people feel a lot more relaxed talking about their feelings when they’re at home, in their own space.
4. **Different Ways to Connect**: Video, phone, or text—you get to choose how you want to communicate.

# But What About the Cons?

1. **You Might Miss Some Non-Verbal Cues**: It’s not quite the same as being face-to-face, and sometimes body language can be important.
2. **Tech Issues**: You need a good internet connection and a quiet, private space. If your Wi-Fi is spotty or your dog keeps interrupting your session, it could be frustrating.
3. **Not for Serious Crises**: If you’re dealing with something that needs immediate attention or intensive care, online therapy might not be the best fit.
4. **Sometimes It’s Just Not the Same**: Some people prefer in-person therapy and feel like it’s more effective when they’re physically in the room with their therapist.

# How to Know if Online Therapy Is for You

Here are a few things to think about:

* **Are you okay with technology?** You’ll need to be comfortable with using video calls, messaging apps, or whatever platform your therapist uses.
* **Do you have a private space and reliable Wi-Fi?** Privacy and connection are key to making sure your sessions go smoothly.
* **What do you want from therapy?** If you're looking for flexibility and convenience, online therapy might be perfect. But if you want more intensive, in-person care, you might need to consider other options.

# Should You Give It a Shot?

If the idea of online therapy feels like it could work for you, why not give it a try? It’s flexible, accessible, and doesn’t require a ton of commitment. Just remember, therapy is all about what works best for YOU, so if online therapy feels like a good fit, go for it. After all, getting help is what matters most.
