1gyb4or,https://www.reddit.com/r/Newsletters/comments/1gyb4or/what_john_cleese_taught_me_about_creativity/,What John Cleese taught me about creativity,"*John Cleese* is a comedian, actor, writer and producer. His many achievements include being a founding member of the iconic comedy troupe *Monty Python* and co-writing and staring in *Fawlty Towers*. His book, *Creativity: A short and cheerful guide*, provides a glimpse into the mind of this creative genius.

Here’s one story *John* shares. *If I wrote a sketch by myself in the evening, I'd often get stuck, and would sit there at my little desk, cudgeling my brains. Eventually I'd give up and go to bed. In the morning I’d wake up and make myself a cup of coffee. Then I'd drift over to the desk. Almost immediately, the solution to the problem I'd been wrestling with the previous evening became quite obvious to me! So obvious that I couldn't really understand why I hadn't spotted it the night before. But I hadn't.*

*John Cleese* said, *Learning from something or someone you admire is not stealing.* So, I have permission to share a few of his ideas.

# Creativity is a skill

>Creativity is not a talent. It is a way of operating. - *John Cleese*

Creativity isn’t an innate talent but a skill that can be developed with practice and the right mindset. It’s accessible to everyone, not just *creative types*.

When young, I had no idea I could be creative. *Maths* was my thing. Now, I love building tools for colleagues, designing apps and writing. Creativity is a skill I’ve learned.

# Open and closed modes

>The open mode is a relaxed, expansive and playful state of mind that is essential for creative problem solving. The closed mode is more linear, logical and focused. This is good for execution but bad for generating ideas. - *John Cleese*

For creativity, it important to make time and space to enter the open mode.

Daily walks along my local canal and river provide space for me to come up with ideas.

# Embrace playfulness

>The most creative people have this childlike facility to play. - *John Cleese*

Playfulness is a key ingredient in fostering creativity. Approaching problems with a sense of humour and curiosity often leads to innovative solutions.

I had an idea to repurpose the dried-out body of a frog I found in my garden. I placed the frog in a cup, peering over the edge, on a colleague’s desk. My colleague became aware of something staring at him. Naturally, he assumed it was plastic. Then he realised it wasn’t. Play was a big part of our office culture.

# Accept uncertainty

>Nothing will stop you from being creative so effectively as the fear of making a mistake. - *John Cleese*

Creativity involves embracing uncertainty and resisting the urge to jump to conclusions. Staying with problems longer can lead to more original ideas. Risk and failure are part of the creative process.

I try to accept that there is little I directly control in life. I can control my attitude and the actions I take, but not whether this leads to a successful outcome. However, as the common refrain has it, *The harder I work, the luckier I get.*

# Subconscious mind

>We don't know where we get our ideas from. What we do know is that we do not get them from our laptops. - *John Cleese*

Often, the best ideas emerge when the conscious mind takes a break. Sleep on problems or take a step back to let the subconscious work on solutions.

When my older brother was studying for *A Levels*, he played recordings of textbooks while he was asleep, on the basis it would sink in over night. He went on to get a degree, undertake a doctorate then became a professor. So, maybe, it worked.

1gyb4g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gyb4g7/i_found_someone_who_is_perfect_in_every_way_but/,I found someone who is perfect in every way but got separated due to visa gap :( Should I give in or wait it out?,"In July, I officially met my best mate's (R) new friend (N) who I clicked with pretty quickly that evening. It was Rs birthday dinner and they wanted to continue to a pub but I had stitches in both my feet I decided to cab it even tho I didn't wanna leave. This guy goes onto offer me a piggyback to the pub so I could continue the night and have fun since I didn't get out that much. I really appreciated this chivalrous gesture.

Fast fw August end, R was leaving the country so I threw him a surprise farewell party and got helped by his gf and N. After the day was over I felt like I was into N. 

We continued to chat as friends even after R left and we hung out again which was just as I'd wanted it to be. We get along pretty well intellectually, spiritually and emotionally. 

I asked him out to go see a show with me; we had a wonderful time again. But unfortunately that day I had to tell him that my visa is expiring and my PR approval had not come through so I booked tickets for oct end so I don't become an illegal immigrant lmao. However I have heaps of chances to go back it'll just require waiting.

We were pretty bummed but continued to talk everyday and decided to go on a bushwalk. He asked me if he could crash on my living room couch a night before as he had a footy game close to mine and I had sports too that night. 

Anyway, he came over on and we ended up chilling in my room after hanging out normally as friends and I'd massaged his back/knee injuries (nothing sexual I'm trained to do it). He then asked if he could just crash with me which I was obviously fine with since I had grown to like him a lot more than I had intended to originally. 

I was first away but then we got closer and he told me he'd kiss me because he likes me but I was flying away in a week's time. I said I just appreciate him telling me about his feelings and we talked before we slept off. Because we were so exhausted from the sports we couldn't go for the hike and stayed in. We ended up kissing the next day because well it was just heartbreaking. We knew we shouldn't have gotten involved that way because of it being too soon.

He took me out on a coffee still and I gave him some stuff I was intending to leave for him. I told R who was very happy for us. N then asked me if he could bring me out again before I left and he finished his assignments quickly to make time for it. We had an amazing day but I was breaking inside. He had to leave to go see another friend and I cried my way home. 

I texted him if he'd wanna come over and hang out once again because I wanted to be close with him now that we knew about each other's feelings but he said it all happened very soon and he's not in a headspace to commit in this way which I obv understand and respected his decision. Because of this he was very clear in telling me he won't be texting as much but obv won't ghost me. It was a good conversation, very open. After a few days I texted him that I was leaving a box of a few other things he could use with a friend and he could take it.

I had some issues with flight and got an extra day. I immediately called him and said I could use a friend and he came to see me the morning of my flight and we got coffee and that day was pretty nice. I got to say bye properly and he said I could talk to him about anything while I was away. 

It'll be a month in 2 days since I came back. We don't chat. I once texted him after 20 days where he thanked me for the box and we didn't talk more. I want to send him something for Christmas/new year's as a surprise and try to engage a lil more but I'm scared to be perceived wrongly.

1gyb3ce,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1gyb3ce/a_little_first_date_drama/,A little first date drama,"I (top) went on a first date last night with a cute verse bottom. We went to a nice part of town where a lot of people walk around and hang out on a Friday night. 

We were walking around and talking and looking at all the shops, when we passed a bar that specialized in wine. He told me that he loved to have a glass of wine right now and I told him no problem I'll pay for it and we'll just have one glass since I was driving. 

Now I have a very strong liver it takes like six glasses of wine to get me tipsy but he did say that he didn't drink often. We drank our wine together on the patio while watching people walk by who were looking at all the Christmas decorations on the stores. 

We then realized it was getting late and decided to walk to my car so we can make our way home. When we get in the car he jumps on me and starts kissing me. It was getting hot and heavy so I told him my house is 5 minutes away and we can go to my apartment and kiss in privacy. 

We get to my apartment and we start kissing and he asked me if we can go to the bedroom. I of course agreed and we had raw sex and I came inside him. We cuddled and talked afterwards about being each other's boyfriends. 

The next afternoon I decide to take him to work since he didn't have a car and we decided to get Starbucks together before work. 

While chatting and drinking coffee he then tells me that that was the first time anybody's cum inside of him. And he decided to start taking his prep pills because he was worried about HIV. 

I told him that that was great and it's important to take care of your sexual health. I reminded him that I was already on prep and HIV negative (I had told him I was on prep on our very first phone call together). I also pulled up the website on my test results and showed him my most recent negative HIV test. 

He then told me that there was no need for me to show him that and that he trusts me, but I told him that he's entitled to see my results first hand especially since he is concerned about me cumming inside of him. 

I wasn't trying to dismiss his concerns but I was trying to show him my results to alleviate his anxiety. 

He then began to tell me that he was quite drunk and although he didn't say it I feel like he was trying to insinuate that that was the reason he fucked raw. 

So what's weird is that after all of this he asks me to go back to the wine place next weekend for another date which I agreed to. 

The only reason I'm writing here is because this isn't the usual conversation I expect after sex. Usually they will tell me what positions they liked and didn't like and tell me how we can improve next time. 

Instead he's concerned about HIV and insinuates that the only reason we had raw sex is because he was drunk. 

Do you guys know if there is another conversation to be had about this issue on our next date? And how should I approach it?

Tldr: Date is nervous after raw sex and thinks he only consented to it because he was drunk ",1,1732399295.0,askgaybros,1,1.0,False

**Tldr: my bf’s mom made a joke on how happy she was to have him back while we are ldr for a couple of months. And its the first time i have thought she might be jealous of our relationship**

So I’ve (26F) been in a relationship with my boyfriend (26M) for almost a year, and long distance for 1 month today, and his mother is happy to “have him back again” 

My bfs mom had him and his older sister at a young age, say 18-20, and his bio-dad just left them out of the blue and has gone until she met my FIL a few years later and they had his brother. I get that she’s very protective of my bf, as he was very young when biodad left. And then she met bfs dad and they had younger brother. I also understand that usually mothers are more into keeping male child closer than females. 

I get along well with her, she has never shown jealousy in my face or acted like it. Even though I am a very awkward person and get more along with introverted people I still give my best to get along with how extroverted she is. She’s also very okay with my family’s “sacred” Saturday lunches, and with us spending some entire days or weekends together. Unlike my mother who does in fact get jealous when my sister can’t make it this year for Christmas night (because she did last year and this one it’s at her husband’s family) 😂. 

Anyway, yesterday I was talking to my bf during his morning off from work and how he decided to catch up in his studies at his mom’s office rather than his home because the commute is shorter, and that she invited him for a coffee. And he said she “joked” on how *happy she was to have her ‘(insert here family pet-name)’ back*. He brushed it off as it was just a joke when I asked him how he felt about that comment, but I can’t help but wonder on how maybe it wasn’t much of a joke. There hasn’t been a moment I’ve witnessed of her showing jealousy signs, but maybe she doesn’t show it while I’m around and my bf doesn’t notice it that much either??

Am I overthinking?? Or is she jealous of me “stealing” her first son (older sister is already married)?? How can I deal with it?

1gyb287,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1gyb287/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

He then immediately checks his watch and gets to work, because we know Walt doesn’t like having to feel things like guilt.

1gyb1g4,https://www.reddit.com/r/logodesign/comments/1gyb1g4/what_john_cleese_taught_me_about_creativity/,What John Cleese taught me about creativity,"*John Cleese* is a comedian, actor, writer and producer. His many achievements include being a founding member of the iconic comedy troupe *Monty Python* and co-writing and staring in *Fawlty Towers*. His book, *Creativity: A short and cheerful guide*, provides a glimpse into the mind of this creative genius.

Here’s one story *John* shares. *If I wrote a sketch by myself in the evening, I'd often get stuck, and would sit there at my little desk, cudgeling my brains. Eventually I'd give up and go to bed. In the morning I’d wake up and make myself a cup of coffee. Then I'd drift over to the desk. Almost immediately, the solution to the problem I'd been wrestling with the previous evening became quite obvious to me! So obvious that I couldn't really understand why I hadn't spotted it the night before. But I hadn't.*

*John Cleese* said, *Learning from something or someone you admire is not stealing.* So, I have permission to share a few of his ideas.

# Creativity is a skill

>Creativity is not a talent. It is a way of operating. - *John Cleese*

Creativity isn’t an innate talent but a skill that can be developed with practice and the right mindset. It’s accessible to everyone, not just *creative types*.

When young, I had no idea I could be creative. *Maths* was my thing. Now, I love building tools for colleagues, designing apps and writing. Creativity is a skill I’ve learned.

# Open and closed modes

>The open mode is a relaxed, expansive and playful state of mind that is essential for creative problem solving. The closed mode is more linear, logical and focused. This is good for execution but bad for generating ideas. - *John Cleese*

For creativity, it important to make time and space to enter the open mode.

Daily walks along my local canal and river provide space for me to come up with ideas.

# Embrace playfulness

>The most creative people have this childlike facility to play. - *John Cleese*

Playfulness is a key ingredient in fostering creativity. Approaching problems with a sense of humour and curiosity often leads to innovative solutions.

I had an idea to repurpose the dried-out body of a frog I found in my garden. I placed the frog in a cup, peering over the edge, on a colleague’s desk. My colleague became aware of something staring at him. Naturally, he assumed it was plastic. Then he realised it wasn’t. Play was a big part of our office culture.

# Accept uncertainty

>Nothing will stop you from being creative so effectively as the fear of making a mistake. - *John Cleese*

Creativity involves embracing uncertainty and resisting the urge to jump to conclusions. Staying with problems longer can lead to more original ideas. Risk and failure are part of the creative process.

I try to accept that there is little I directly control in life. I can control my attitude and the actions I take, but not whether this leads to a successful outcome. However, as the common refrain has it, *The harder I work, the luckier I get.*

# Subconscious mind

>We don't know where we get our ideas from. What we do know is that we do not get them from our laptops. - *John Cleese*

Often, the best ideas emerge when the conscious mind takes a break. Sleep on problems or take a step back to let the subconscious work on solutions.

When my older brother was studying for *A Levels*, he played recordings of textbooks while he was asleep, on the basis it would sink in over night. He went on to get a degree, undertake a doctorate then became a professor. So, maybe, it worked.

What now ?,"My (22F) best friend (22F) broke up 6 months ago from her boyfriend (23M). We are best friend since the beginning of college, and I saw their relationship begin, evolve, and end. During their relationship, I spent quite a time with her and her boyfriend, and we were all three spending really good quality time. I never really spent real alone time with him, except from talking for 2 hours, just th both of us, at parties. But even though we never went to take a coffee just the both of us, or something like that, during their relationship, we felt that we were meant to be friends, and even my best friend told me that we really match (in friendship).  
So when they broke up (he didn’t cheat or nothing like that, it was contextual), I was actually sad, because I felt as if a potential friendship could’ve happened, and it didn’t. But just after their breakup, the boyfriend proposed to me to go take a drink, and I asked my best friend for her permission. She completely understood, but asked me to just not talk about it to her. She didn‘t want me to tell her when I saw him, what we talked about etc. So I went to this drink.

And now (4 months after this drink), we saw each other (her ex), and we told each other that we should take another drink and see each other more often (it is absolutely platonic). But I feel like after that much time, it would be weird to tell to my best friend about that drink. So I’m not sure if I should tell her, or if I should just keep it to myself, knowing that she told me to stay discreet about my friendship with him. But also, would she still think the same today ? I mean, if I was her, I would be super sad if my best friend kept this from me, but also, I wouldn’t want to know that she’s still seeing him… so what ?",1,1732399040.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

So I’ve (26F) been in a relationship with my boyfriend (26M) for almost a year, and long distance for 1 month today, and his mother is happy to “have him back again” 

My bfs mom had him and his older sister at a young age, say 18-20, and his bio-dad just left them out of the blue and has gone until she met my FIL a few years later and they had his brother. I get that she’s very protective of my bf, as he was very young when biodad left. And then she met bfs dad and they had younger brother. I also understand that usually mothers are more into keeping male child closer than females. 

I get along well with her, she has never shown jealousy in my face or acted like it. Even though I am a very awkward person and get more along with introverted people I still give my best to get along with how extroverted she is. She’s also very okay with my family’s “sacred” Saturday lunches, and with us spending some entire days or weekends together. Unlike my mother who does in fact get jealous when my sister can’t make it this year for Christmas night (because she did last year and this one it’s at her husband’s family) 😂. 

Anyway, yesterday I was talking to my bf during his morning off from work and how he decided to catch up in his studies at his mom’s office rather than his home because the commute is shorter, and that she invited him for a coffee. And he said she “joked” on how *happy she was to have her ‘(insert here family pet-name)’ back*. He brushed it off as it was just a joke when I asked him how he felt about that comment, but I can’t help but wonder on how maybe it wasn’t much of a joke. There hasn’t been a moment I’ve witnessed of her showing jealousy signs, but maybe she doesn’t show it while I’m around and my bf doesn’t notice it that much either??

Am I overthinking?? Or is she jealous of me “stealing” her first son (older sister is already married)?? How can I deal with it?

...is this what it means to be overstimulated?

Satsop Turbine Building

This day started with an hour-long drive from basecamp before morning light. Out on highway 12 in southern Washington state, there’s two big nuclear cooling towers off in the distance. That’s Satsop. They were put there during the Nixon administration when the US was expanding the nuclear power program, got 90% of the way completed but never had the reactor core installed. But it’s a REAL cool location with a straightforward booking process and 1/2 the rate for prep days. Plus a site manager that let us stay even after our booking was officially supposed to be finished—which we needed because these were some of the most complicated days on set!

We added members to the G&E team who had to build custom electric connectors to get power from big ol’ 80’s-era industrial power sources. We hung a 10x15’ bounce and another softbox about 30ft off the floor. We expanded the stunt team to 6, including air-powered ratchets to pull performers 40ft into the air. We had an armorer on set for working guns with blanks and rubber guns for background. The entire principal cast was on set, huddled up in the motorhome we rented as a mobile production unit. 

January at that elevation means that we didn’t get above 30° every day—we didn’t have to refrigerate the coffee creamer between days! But that also means that the extras that were sitting on the ground “dead” the whole time were the real heroes. And the camera team who had to build little “jackets” made of hand warmers to keep the camera batteries running at full speed. We got halfway through the day and realized we were going through batteries quicker than we could recharge them because the cold was sucking the LIFE out of ‘em.

This day was really fun. Stunts and fog machines and far-flung locations and weapons and fake blood and “army men” costumes. One day, when we’re making big-budget superhero movies in fancy Hollywood sound stages, we’ll look back at the call sheet for our first little “action scene” and think how small and simple it all was. But for now, this day felt like we were really making a movie.",11,1732398956.0,Filmmakers,1,1.0,False

Today I woke up at 10am, at about 2pm I was just way too tired and slept for 1:30-2hrs-ish, then again now at 23 I can barely stay awake. Between the tiredness, naps and eating 2 meals a day I feel like I have no time to study and it's making me stressed. I don't drink coffee but I drink at least a few cups of tea everyday. 

On days I go to uni I basically just attend then crash when I get home. (Even on short days) 

I also just feel like my brain isn't working with me when I *am* doing stuff. 

I don't think it's entyvio because it doesn't do that right? But I am seeing blood in the toilet so I assume it's that.

1gyawuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1gyawuf/what_john_cleese_taught_me_about_creativity_as_a/,What John Cleese taught me about creativity as a route to happiness,"*John Cleese* is a comedian, actor, writer and producer. His many achievements include being a founding member of the iconic comedy troupe *Monty Python* and co-writing and staring in *Fawlty Towers*. His book, *Creativity: A short and cheerful guide*, provides a glimpse into the mind of this creative genius.

Here’s one story *John* shares. *If I wrote a sketch by myself in the evening, I'd often get stuck, and would sit there at my little desk, cudgeling my brains. Eventually I'd give up and go to bed. In the morning I’d wake up and make myself a cup of coffee. Then I'd drift over to the desk. Almost immediately, the solution to the problem I'd been wrestling with the previous evening became quite obvious to me! So obvious that I couldn't really understand why I hadn't spotted it the night before. But I hadn't.*

*John Cleese* said, *Learning from something or someone you admire is not stealing.* So, I have permission to share a few of his ideas.

# Creativity is a skill

>Creativity is not a talent. It is a way of operating. - *John Cleese*

Creativity isn’t an innate talent but a skill that can be developed with practice and the right mindset. It’s accessible to everyone, not just *creative types*.

When young, I had no idea I could be creative. *Maths* was my thing. Now, I love building tools for colleagues, designing apps and writing. Creativity is a skill I’ve learned.

# Open and closed modes

>The open mode is a relaxed, expansive and playful state of mind that is essential for creative problem solving. The closed mode is more linear, logical and focused. This is good for execution but bad for generating ideas. - *John Cleese*

For creativity, it important to make time and space to enter the open mode.

Daily walks along my local canal and river provide space for me to come up with ideas.

# Embrace playfulness

>The most creative people have this childlike facility to play. - *John Cleese*

Playfulness is a key ingredient in fostering creativity. Approaching problems with a sense of humour and curiosity often leads to innovative solutions.

I had an idea to repurpose the dried-out body of a frog I found in my garden. I placed the frog in a cup, peering over the edge, on a colleague’s desk. My colleague became aware of something staring at him. Naturally, he assumed it was plastic. Then he realised it wasn’t. Play was a big part of our office culture.

# Accept uncertainty

>Nothing will stop you from being creative so effectively as the fear of making a mistake. - *John Cleese*

Creativity involves embracing uncertainty and resisting the urge to jump to conclusions. Staying with problems longer can lead to more original ideas. Risk and failure are part of the creative process.

I try to accept that there is little I directly control in life. I can control my attitude and the actions I take, but not whether this leads to a successful outcome. However, as the common refrain has it, *The harder I work, the luckier I get.*

# Subconscious mind

>We don't know where we get our ideas from. What we do know is that we do not get them from our laptops. - *John Cleese*

Often, the best ideas emerge when the conscious mind takes a break. Sleep on problems or take a step back to let the subconscious work on solutions.

When my older brother was studying for *A Levels*, he played recordings of textbooks while he was asleep, on the basis it would sink in over night. He went on to get a degree, undertake a doctorate then became a professor. So, maybe, it worked.

1gyast7,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1gyast7/friendship_with_someone_i_ioved_fizzled_out_and/,friendship with someone I Ioved fizzled out and I’ve been distraught for months,"I met my friend in my second year of university and we became very close when her boyfriend broke up with her and I was the person she reached out for support. I didn’t know her that well at the time but I supported her as best as I could for months and we became really good friends. After that we spent the summer talking and became roommates for the rest of uni.

I know a lot of ppl lose friendships when they become roommates but we were actually super compatible and I only felt like it made us closer.

For a while we were a little unit, and I felt like we understood each other so much. She also got along well with my boyfriend and I always had a great time when we were all together. I felt so loved and I had so much fun. I was the person she turn to for support and I truly loved being there for her. 

It feels kinda weird to say but over time I began to love her, like she was my sister or something. I wasn’t in love romantically necessarily, but there’s a little bit of romance in loving a friend I think. But regardless looking back i feel it was probably one sided.

Sometime in our last year at university we began growing distant but in a really weird way. Over winter break, we pretty much just didn’t talk to each other, not because we didn’t want to but because it just.. happened. We were both extremely busy and I felt like she wasn’t particular engaging when I texted her and I felt like I was putting in all the effort so I stopped texting first and she just never reached out. While not the worst thing ever, it felt like it was the start of a rift that wasn’t cause by anything in specific which makes it so much weirder and oddly hurtful I can’t pinpoint a cause.

After that we went back to living together in January of this year and sort of talked that out because we were both upset about it but then just never quite went back to normal. Through conversations we had about her complaining about other friends I learned that she viewed friendships in “tiers” and that if she didn’t talk to someone pretty much every day they moved down several tiers. She also was unusually gatekeep-y about her friends and spoke about her friends like they were disposable. When I pointed out how that made me uncomfortable a bit after this, she told me that because she was talking to me about it I was like “excluded” from this. I kind of let it slide but I couldn’t help but feel like this was just a really weird thing to think and I started viewing our friendship differently. Through the next months, several small things happened that added to the tension in no specific order: 
-we both became extremely busy for other coursework so we started seeing less and less
-I started having severe family issues (she was aware of) but she began to take my frustration and anxiety as if it was personal, which I later found out because she told my bf about it
-I became busy with studying for a standardized exam and she began to get close to 2 people who she had previously talked negatively about (for good reason) and who clearly didn’t like me (not sure why, I didn’t have anything against them personally and we had been friendly before)
-during a mini road trip we had planned with friends she shot down every single suggestion I made to impulse her own (down to the place we could get coffee before hitting the road. Which stung a LOT because she knew how badly I wanted to go to this one place and hadn’t been able to in months)
-I had a mini art gallery on campus and I asked her to stop by and she “forgot”. For context, the year prior she also missed the mini exhibition I was in and I told her how much that had hurt because it was silly but it really really meant a lot to me to show up

There were other things I can’t immediately remember but it all just hurt so much that it was such a slow and painful process. Not that we didn’t talk about some of it, but she was very avoidant and was hardly ever around. We went from talking every single evening to seeing each other in passing like once a week in the kitchen or living room even though we lived together

I had a feeling that once we graduated we would never talk again and I was right. After graduation, we didn’t have a single graduation pic together even though we had talked about it before. I didn’t even see her on graduation day and she was MIA around that time. She moved out when I was visiting some family so before I left I left her a gift on her door which she never thanked me for. After moving out she only texted me about move out stuff (sometimes under the guise of making a joke but then it would become clear she only texted me a joke to talk about move out stuff). I texted her on her birthday, asked her how she was etc etc and she responded to my messages like once after two weeks, and then I messaged her back. She never responded to that. She texted me on my birthday (literally 2 minutes before the day was over. I’m convinced she forgot) and I thanked her and that was it. A couple of weeks ago I found a cute picture of us and on a whim I sent it to her and she never responded or reacted or anything… and I thinks that’s it. That’s the end of our friendship I think. And it sucks so much it’s still an open wound.

I’ve been grieving this friendship since January and it feels like maybe we were never on the same page. I know not all friendships are forever but I really really wanted this one to stick after college, if only for a year after and then fizzled out. But it just hurts so much it ended so abruptly after graduating. There has been absolutely no effort on her part to reach out to me at all and I have message her random things here and there to no response from her. I’m just so hurt. I’ve cried so much it feels like a breakup but I can’t even do anything about it.

Part of me wants to text her and just cut to the chase and be like what happened? Why are we like this now? What happened? But there would be no point since I don’t think I’ll see her again (even though we had wanted to make plans to visit before).

I don’t really know what to do. I know logically there’s nothing for me to do but I’m so hurt I feel like I need closure or something. I’ve been mostly trying to match her energy but I hate pretending I don’t care or that I’m unaffected because I care a lot and I’m extremely affected. I think about her everyday and still cry about it.

I knwo this isn’t a friendship of 30 years but o really, really wanted it to be

Usually i consume only little doses of l-free yoghurt, because i feel pain after most other things (I feel symptoms after l-free milk and other things too).

It's a sour smell, kind of like animal stable and quite strong and it tastes sour, almost bitter. I didn't have any symptoms beyond bloat and pain until now. I have these symptoms since 5 days.

There is open milk and gervais in my fridge and i'm tempted to throw it away, because i can smell it as soon as i open the fridge. Everything non dairy tastes OK. Lactose free goat cheese tasted normal, but also triggers the disgust.

This is probably completely unrelated, but since August my sweat smells sour too. It was a distinct and sudden change, even other people noticed it. At first i thought it might be the summer heat's fault but even now it's still the same. The smell reminds me of how milk tastes now, very weird... I should probably see a doctor, i'm worried my kidneys have a problem.

Did someone on here experience abrupt taste change in dairy? Or did milk always triggers disgust for some people? Also: Does it go away or did i unlock the next stage of intolerance?",2,1732398417.0,lactoseintolerant,0,1.0,False

1gyaned,https://www.reddit.com/r/CommercialRealEstate/comments/1gyaned/dilemma_stay_at_corporate_firm_or_move_to/,Dilemma: stay at corporate firm or move to boutique? (REPE),"Hi everyone,

I’m at a crossroads in my career and could really use some advice.

I’m currently pursuing an MSc in Finance and working as a Working Student in Portfolio Analysis at a large REPE firm in Europe (>€30bn AUM). My background includes several internships and part-time roles in asset management, mostly focused on the operational side of the business. This is my first analyst-level position, and so far, I’ve been learning a lot about analyzing a complex real estate portfolio.

The challenge is that my current firm is a large corporate organization with a highly structured hierarchy. While it’s a fantastic place to learn portfolio analysis, there’s limited scope to explore other areas, especially investment activities, as those are handled centrally by the holding company in another country.

My goal is to transition into real estate investments after I graduate. To that end, I’ve been networking actively, which recently led to a coffee chat with the founder of a boutique investment firm that manages €600M, with an additional €500M in dry powder set to deploy next year. They’ve offered me a working student role where I’d gain exposure to underwriting, transactions, investor relations, asset management, and more—a chance to get hands-on experience across the investment side of the business.

I’m in doubt about whether to take this offer. On one hand, it aligns perfectly with my goal of transitioning into investments and would give me a chance to explore different aspects of real estate investing. On the other hand, leaving my current role means stepping away from a complex portfolio and potentially missing out on building a strong foundation in portfolio analysis, which I think is also valuable for a career in real estate investments.

Another factor to consider is the timing. If I leave now, I’ll have only spent six months in my current role, despite signing a one-year contract for a position they created just for me. While I don’t think this is a major issue as I’m still a student, it does weigh on my mind.

I’d love to hear your perspective. Should I stick with my current role to continue learning portfolio analysis at a big REPE firm, or take the leap to join a boutique and gain broader exposure to investments?

Thanks in advance for your advice!",3,1732398075.0,CommercialRealEstate,1,1.0,False
1gyan3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1gyan3q/i_found_someone_who_is_perfect_in_every_way_but/,I found someone who is perfect in every way but got separated due to visa gap. Should I give in or wait it out?,"In July, I (23F) officially met my best mate's (R) new friend (N: 21M) who I clicked with pretty quickly that evening. It was Rs birthday dinner and they wanted to continue to a pub but I had stitches in both my feet I decided to cab it even tho I didn't wanna leave. This guy goes onto offer me a piggyback to the pub so I could continue the night and have fun since I didn't get out that much. I really appreciated this chivalrous gesture.

Fast fw August end, R was leaving the country so I threw him a surprise farewell party and got helped by his gf and N. After the day was over I felt like I was into N. 

We continued to chat as friends even after R left and we hung out again which was just as I'd wanted it to be. We get along pretty well intellectually, spiritually and emotionally. 

I asked him out to go see a show with me; we had a wonderful time again. But unfortunately that day I had to tell him that my visa is expiring and my PR approval had not come through so I booked tickets for oct end so I don't become an illegal immigrant lmao. However I have heaps of chances to go back it'll just require waiting.

We were pretty bummed but continued to talk everyday and decided to go on a bushwalk. He asked me if he could crash on my living room couch a night before as he had a footy game close to mine and I had sports too that night. 

Anyway, he came over on and we ended up chilling in my room after hanging out normally as friends and I'd massaged his back/knee injuries (nothing sexual I'm trained to do it). He then asked if he could just crash with me which I was obviously fine with since I had grown to like him a lot more than I had intended to originally. 

I was first away but then we got closer and he told me he'd kiss me because he likes me but I was flying away in a week's time. I said I just appreciate him telling me about his feelings and we talked before we slept off. Because we were so exhausted from the sports we couldn't go for the hike and stayed in. We ended up kissing the next day because well it was just heartbreaking. We knew we shouldn't have gotten involved that way because of it being too soon.

He took me out on a coffee still and I gave him some stuff I was intending to leave for him. I told R who was very happy for us. N then asked me if he could bring me out again before I left and he finished his assignments quickly to make time for it. We had an amazing day but I was breaking inside. He had to leave to go see another friend and I cried my way home. 

I texted him if he'd wanna come over and hang out once again because I wanted to be close with him now that we knew about each other's feelings but he said it all happened very soon and he's not in a headspace to commit in this way which I obv understand and respected his decision. Because of this he was very clear in telling me he won't be texting as much but obv won't ghost me. It was a good conversation, very open. After a few days I texted him that I was leaving a box of a few other things he could use with a friend and he could take it.

I had some issues with flight and got an extra day. I immediately called him and said I could use a friend and he came to see me the morning of my flight and we got coffee and that day was pretty nice. I got to say bye properly and he said I could talk to him about anything while I was away. 

It'll be a month in 2 days since I came back. We don't chat. I once texted him after 20 days where he thanked me for the box and we didn't talk more. I want to send him something for Christmas/new year's as a surprise and try to engage a lil more but I'm scared because he seems hesitant. In my heart and spirit I know he's everything for me but I'm very conflicted and miss him.

Normally I am not a fan of gourmands but this fragrance has enough layers to it to pique my interest.

Upon spraying you get a a nice mix of spices. Cinnamon is the most dominant on my skin, but I can also smell some black peppercorn and ginger. Another note that pops out is a pistachio note, but it is very creamy and a hint of vanilla almost like a gelato. 

As it dries down you get the ever infamous holiday running joke that is fruit cake, with its mystery mix of various of candied fruits. Although the name Qahwa means Coffee in Arabic, I don’t get that much coffee. It smells like a place that has coffee, but not a coffee bean, if that makes sense. A warm, nostalgic and cozy mix of smells you would get walking into your grandmas house in Christmas. 

Speaking of grandmas at Christmas,, What I do pick up is Khamrah, which means booze. The whole composition is sweet and viscous, like some type of holiday liqueur. The dry down especially has a prominent whisky note. It’s a light and sweet whisky, like Crown or some other Canadian whisky, as opposed to a stronger smelling scotch. 

Overall this is a pleasant  fragrance that works well in the colder months. It isn’t sharp or dry like a typical winter fragrance, but has an inviting vibe to it that brings up many special memories with family. It leaves a good trail, and clings to clothes very well. It’s fairly unisex but leans feminine, and more suitable for an older person. It puts me in a spirited mood as I go crazy from holiday shopping.",0,1732398004.0,fragrance,0,0.33,False

I decided to stay quiet, and responded with yes ma'am, no ma'am and I will have to look into it. I should mention she was upset, that the price she saw online was different from the price quoted by the first agent who tried to help her. I would think by now everybody know that the price you see online, MUST BE BOOKED ONLINE, because it differs from the property price when you call the hotel to book a room. Hey I could be wrong, I cant speak for all hotels, but I know thats how it is for ours. 

Apparently when the previous agent made the reservation for her, and she received her confirmation number, she called back immediately upset about the price. I assumed he tried to explain to her, but (according to her) couldnt do so clearly and his accent made it even harder to understand. So I walked into his asswhooping completely clueless and my ears getting chewed off, first thing in the morning, barely awake and didnt even get to sip my coffee.

So she continues to rant, and i just wanted to calm her down cuz my head was starting to hurt and i'll admit i was starting to get irritated myself. So I shushed her and tell her I will take a look at her reservation and make the correct adjustments. Immediately I found all the issues, took a deep breath and resume our chat.

On the weekends, we wake up, enjoy coffee for an hour (he gets a frozen milk pop), go back upstairs for a two hour nap, wake up, a two hour excursion around the city (museum, park, shopping if his mama sends us) , another nap for him (I usually clean the house), longgg evening bath, cat nap before mom comes home... 

Not to say there isn't some crying sometimes, or blown out diapers, or grouchy days. And that parenting isn't hard (it's a marathon some days, and our first 8 weeks were a fever dream). But usually we exist together in such an easy sort of way these days.

I’ll provide some examples:

Today he had some errands to run and he asked me if I would like to come with him. I told him I felt really under the weather and he reassured me it was totally cool. 

He messages me that he’s grabbing some coffee, and asks me what me and our roomate would like. I give my boyfriend the order via text. 10 minutes later he calls me to confirm after placing the order, and idk how but he didn’t order the right drinks. I told him that it was fine and we would still enjoy them, don’t sweat it. He started flipping out that if I JUST came with him like he wanted me to half these issues could have been avoided. Then he started accusing me (a barista) of not knowing coffee terms and making him look stupid ordering at the drive thru window. I told him he could just pull up to the window and clarify the order(it’s happens all the time), and he thanked me for making him stressed tf out when he was trying to do something nice for me. 

Another example, he asks how my day is and stubs his finger while I’m talking. He says ‘Jesus you talk so much that I can’t even think straight, thanks.’ 

He misses an exit while I’m digging through my bag and it’s ’my fault’ that 10 minutes are added to the route. 

He offers to do something after I have expressed 10 times he doesn’t need to (he insists on doing it anyways) then gets upset at ME when a minor inconvenience pops up. Like offering to go to target when I mention I need something from there, despite him not feeling good. I tell him I can go later by myself, he insists, and then after a minor inconvenience it’s ’and you just haaaaddd to go to target right now.’ 

He makes me breakfast even though I’ve told him I am not hungry and do not want to eat. Then he throws a little tantrum when surprise- I don’t eat it. ‘Can’t you just accept what I’m doing for you’. 

He failed a college class because he was honestly playing too many videogames and neglecting his school work. A year later he blamed it on me for ‘hanging out with him too much’. He never communicated needing space or time to study- at that point he really downplayed the homework and always told me the class was going good. Plus most of the time I was at his house I was watching tv while he was gaming.

I don’t know what to do about these issues or how to label them to clearly explain to him that I find this problematic. Or am I just, tripping? My mom was this way when I was a kid and would often fly off the handle at me so personally I find this super triggering and I already apologize ‘too much’. 

TLDR: my bf gets mad at me for things that I do not believe to be my fault when he gets overwhelmed. Please offer me some advice on how I could bring this up to him or solutions we can try to minimize these situations.",2,1732397735.0,relationships,6,1.0,False

Picture this: you're sitting at your desk, hunched over, shoulders tense, and your back feels like it's been hit by a Mack truck. Sound familiar? That's because most of us spend hours upon hours glued to our chairs, staring at screens, and typing away. But what if I told you it doesn't have to be this way? That's where the ergonomic chair and desk combo comes in. I've spent years navigating the treacherous waters of office furniture, and I'm here to share my experiences, insights, and a few laughs along the way. So, buckle up, because we're about to dive into the world of ergonomics, and you might just find your perfect workspace too.
  
  
## The Big Kahunas: What Makes an Ergonomic Chair and Desk Combo Awesome

When I first started working from home, I thought I could just plop down on my couch with my laptop and call it a day. Spoiler alert: that was a terrible idea! My back felt like it was auditioning for a role in a horror movie. Enter the ergonomic chair and desk combo, the superheroes of my workspace. 

So, what makes these bad boys so awesome? First off, adjustable height is a game changer. I can go from sitting like a potato to standing like a boss in seconds. It’s like having a magic button that says, “Hey, you! Get off your butt!” Plus, I can switch it up depending on my mood. Some days, I feel like a desk potato; other days, I’m ready to conquer the world while standing.

Then there’s lumbar support. Oh, sweet lumbar support! It’s like a gentle hug for my lower back. It keeps me from slouching like a sad sack. Proper posture is key, folks! When I sit up straight, I feel more alert and ready to tackle my to-do list. 

And here’s the science bit: ergonomics is all about designing workspaces that fit our bodies. It’s like a cozy puzzle that helps us work better and feel good. So, if you’re still working on that couch, do yourself a favor and check out an ergonomic chair and desk combo. Your back will thank you!

## The Goldilocks Zone: Finding the Perfect Height and Position

Finding the perfect height and position for your ergonomic chair and desk combo is like trying to find the right porridge in the story of Goldilocks. You know, not too high, not too low, but just right! When I first started my quest, I felt like Goldilocks herself, testing out different setups. I’d adjust my chair, then my desk, only to realize I was either slouching like a tired cat or reaching like I was trying to grab the last cookie from the top shelf.

Different body types and work styles play a huge role in this. For instance, if you’re tall, you might need a desk that’s a bit higher to avoid feeling like a giant trying to fit into a dollhouse. On the flip side, if you’re shorter, a desk that’s too high can make you feel like you’re in a game of limbo. 

Here’s a quick list of height recommendations for various tasks: 

* **Typing**: Elbows at 90 degrees, desk height around 25-30 inches.
* **Writing**: Slightly higher, about 28-32 inches, to keep your wrist straight.
* **Using a monitor**: The top of the screen should be at eye level, which usually means raising your chair or lowering the desk.

Finding that sweet spot can make all the difference in your comfort and productivity!

## The Standing Revolution: Why I'm Now a Fan of Standing Desks

I never thought I’d be the kind of person who would stand at my desk. I mean, who does that? But here I am, a proud member of the standing desk revolution! It all started when I read a study from the American Journal of Preventive Medicine that said sitting too much can be as harmful as smoking. Yikes! That got my attention. 

So, I decided to give it a shot. The first day was a comedy show. I set up my desk, adjusted it to the right height, and thought, “This is going to be great!” But after about 10 minutes, my legs felt like jelly. I was wobbling like a newborn giraffe trying to find its footing. I even spilled my coffee all over my keyboard. Talk about a wake-up call! 

But once I got used to it, I noticed some real benefits. I felt more energized and focused. Plus, I could easily switch between sitting and standing, which kept my back from screaming at me. Sure, there are some downsides—like the occasional foot cramp—but the pros definitely outweigh the cons. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t want to feel like a boss while standing at their desk?

## The Art of Adjustment: Customizing Your Workspace for You

When it comes to creating the perfect workspace, customization is key. You see, an ergonomic chair and desk combo isn’t just about picking the fanciest model; it’s about making it work for _you_. Everyone’s body is different, and what feels comfortable for one person might feel like torture for another. So, let’s dive into the art of adjustment!

First off, let’s talk about chair height. You want your feet flat on the ground, knees at a right angle, and your thighs parallel to the floor. Sounds simple, right? But I once tried to adjust my partner’s chair, and let me tell you, it turned into a scene straight out of a comedy. I cranked the lever, and suddenly, the chair shot up like a rocket! My partner was flailing around, trying to grab onto the desk for dear life. We both ended up in a fit of laughter, but it was a reminder that adjustments can be a bit chaotic.

Next, don’t forget about lumbar support! Many chairs have adjustable backrests. Find that sweet spot where your lower back feels hugged, not squished. And if your desk is too high or low, consider a sit-stand desk. It’s like having a dance party with your workspace—up, down, shimmy, shake! The more you customize, the more you’ll enjoy your time at your desk. So go ahead, make those adjustments, and turn your workspace into your personal comfort zone!

## The Tech Twins: How to Set Up Your Screen and Keyboard for Success

Setting up your screen and keyboard correctly is like finding the perfect dance partner. You want them to move in sync with you, not trip you up! Trust me, I learned this the hard way. Picture this: I was working on a project, and my screen was so low that I felt like I was peering into a cave. My neck was craned like a giraffe trying to reach a leaf, and my wrists? Oh boy, they were bent at such awkward angles that I could’ve auditioned for a contortionist show. 

Now, let’s get serious for a moment. Your screen should be at eye level. This means when you sit down, your eyes should naturally fall on the top third of the screen. If you’re looking down, you’re setting yourself up for neck pain. And nobody wants that! 

As for your keyboard, it should be placed so your elbows are at about a 90-degree angle. This helps keep your wrists straight and supported. I once tried typing with my keyboard perched on my lap—let’s just say it didn’t end well. I ended up with a cramp that felt like a tiny gremlin was squeezing my wrist! 

So, remember: eye level, elbow angle, and wrist support. Your body will thank you!

## The Grand Finale: My Perfect Ergonomic Setup and How You Can Create Yours

I can’t believe I’m finally here, sitting in my dream ergonomic setup! Picture this: before, I was hunched over a rickety old desk, my chair squeaking like a rusty hinge every time I shifted. My back? Let’s just say it was staging a protest. Fast forward to now, and I’ve got this sleek, adjustable chair that feels like it was custom-made for me. Seriously, it’s like sitting on a cloud—if clouds were made of memory foam and had lumbar support.

Now, let’s talk about my desk. Gone are the days of clutter and chaos. My new desk is spacious and has a nifty sit-stand feature. I can go from sitting like a potato to standing like a boss in seconds! It’s like having a personal assistant that reminds me to move. I even added a few plants for that “I’m a responsible adult” vibe. 

So, how can you create your perfect setup? Start by experimenting! Adjust your chair height until your feet are flat on the ground. Your screen should be at eye level—no more looking down like a sad puppy. And don’t forget to take breaks! Trust me, your back will thank you. So, what are you waiting for? Go find your perfect ergonomic combo and make your workspace a place you actually want to be!

## Conclusions
  
  
So there you have it, folks! My personal journey to the perfect ergonomic chair and desk combo. I've laughed, I've hurt, and I've learned a lot along the way. But the most important thing is that I'm now working in comfort and style. I hope you've found this article helpful and entertaining. Remember, everyone's body is unique, so don't be afraid to experiment and find what works best for you. Your back will thank you later! Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some comfortable work to get back to. Happy ergonomics!",1,1732397587.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False

So i messaged the girlfriend and told her that i am deeply disappointed with how she acted. I can understand saying i am her daughter might not have been meant as it is being perceived but my mom did feel a certain hurt about it and all she should have done is just apologized and clear it up instead of going in guns blazing attacking her. I also told her that i will not allow their poor behavior affect or hurt my brother and our relationship and i hope we can all go forward from this incident in a more calm and rational manner. I also understand the paternity being in question in some rumours, i do not care about the rumours as he is and always will be my brother. She agreed and apologized. She also said she wanted to nip the rumours in the butt as my father is definitely the dad. As for my dads brother in question she cannot understand how people could even suggest him as they apparently hate each other and have never been alone for so much as a coffee as she would ""rather eat coal"". 

I called my mom and also told her that i understand how she could be hurt because she is very protective when it comes to me and be hurt about a rumour saying my dad hated my mom. However, i still am deeply disappointed at how she behaved because she was the one swearing so badly a drunk would blush. She apologized profusely and said she just lost it because of everything building up for years. My mom then confessed that she has had a chip on her shoulder all this time because turns out she and my dad was still sexually active. Yup...

As for the dna test everyone suggested in the comments on my previous post, i did mention maybe we could do a dna test when my brother is 18 and its his choice. The girlfriend then asked if we could have a call and discuss it. So we scheduled a call that should have happened today. But when the time came she didnt call. So i tried calling, no answer. I texted her asking if she is available after all and she said ""what are you talking about"". So i resent her own message suggesting the call and she said "" yes i know what i said im just busy"". I just said ""alright maybe we could then call when things are calm and when she has the time"". She didnt respond.
I told my mom what the girlfriend said afterwards and my mom said yea see this is why everyone finds her sketchy, because she acts cagy like this.

So i dont know what to believe anymore. My husband and i are just trying to support each other emotionally because these past few weeks have been crazy. My MIL also has been dealing with health issues. So i feel like a  dumb dumb for not knowing anything about my family anymore. We are too exhausted from all this so we are getting ice cream now.

In July, my favorite brand of coffee sold for $0.36/unit. Now, depending on the size I can either buy it for $0.50/unit in bulk or $0.61/unit with fewer pods in the shipment. That is an immediate 40%+ rise in prices in anticipation of Trump's tariffs.

So what do we notice that Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha have in common with each other? What would they be doing if they hung out in pairs?

Miranda and Charlotte are both runners at different points in the show, so we could have had scenes with them jogging together in the park.

Samantha indicates some interest in art, so maybe she and Charlotte would go to galleries together.

Miranda is less uptight about sex than Charlotte and Carrie and is pretty much always willing to engage with Samantha when she talks about sex even when Carrie and Charlotte are pearl clutching. I could see them having coffee dates where they discuss their sex lives candidly and free from judgment.

She is a few years younger than me (23). For a bit of understanding of us and our friendship and HER:(SORRY FOR THE LONG BACK GROUND)

She has some mental health issues as so i do too but im more in control of my actions than she. She makes erratic decisions and burns alot of bridges and ruins alot of friendship, im basically her only friend. I give advice to her on how i accomplished being so in control of my emotions  (most of  the time ). She doesnt take it !! She has a man she has been obsessed wiht since middle school. As  children, she ended up trauma bonding him (suicide threats anytime she felt he would waklk away from the friend ship). As a adult they started doing the Giggity, but were never officially together.  He had 2 kids, 2 different wemon , multiple relationships but would never  pursue her. ( I call this ""playing with her mind"") . 2 Years into our  friendship i met this man (Lets call him Corny). Corny was cool a first, didn't seem to bad, (all i heard was neg things about him from her ). Throughout the next year or so on at least once a month she would call me screaming and yelling about how shes is going ot Ki\*\* herself because  he would see her ,hang out, had his kid, with is gf, changed plan, wouldn't call her, back, change her tire at a exact time bc his kid wanted food lol  etc. The list goes on and on lol. IF i couldnt answer her right then and there ,she would end up at  my  job or at  my house outside ready to do the same to me.  i Took  a break from after about 6 times of this happening . After a few months go by, i contacted her to get food and talk. We spoke and she agreed to instead act out of anger , breathe and calm down a bit so, 1. i can understand her , and 2. she doesn't make any bad decisions and she can think clearly and logically. . So for a good while lets say 7 o rso months , she was taking her meds and working a few full time jobs at time and ubering and other side jobs. JUST DOING GREAT !! but this is where it got weird , i would ask to hang out but she would say shes broke, but im not the friend to expect you to have money when im inviting , but after 5 hang outs and shes  always broek i started asking questions. Come to find out ( drumroll), shes paying CORNY $3K a month for GIGGITYYYYYY.  ATP my Flabbers were Gasted more hasted than ever. So i tried to talk her into stopping and explaining beauty is in the eye of the beholder , and there are men who would want to do nothing but love her for who she is but, sh only wants him. And that is when i realised she was obsessed lol . This i nun of my  bizz and wasn't for a while but until she called me 5 mins after being released from Jail. Why was she in jail for the first time? after he told her, he couldnt come to pic u pa case of soda and bring it in her house  bc he was at a movie wiht his son. She went to his house later that night and busted windows and tires. FAST FORWARD 2 years later , were in 2022, i moved from NY to WV , away from all connections and starting over. i kept in contact with her while being there everyday, picked up calls when she was bugging out and keeping her calm, etc . She went to jail agian in 2023 bc of another scenario ,same man, same anger issues lol

Now to the story:

were are in 2024 , earlier this year, i connected her to my sister , in our city, so she could have a piece of me there. They hung out alot , video called me , trees it down lol . but in the summer she and Her sister got into a argument and larry basically told me  she left her sister stranded in the middle of a city she is not familiar with. So i told larry that i was gonna call her sister to see where she was and convince her to get back in the car with her. So upn calling her sister , HER SISTER IS OTP WITH MINE.  So she tells me the story (her side). While she is telling her side , Larry beeps in and we add her to the call, and Larry then start threatening us all and , saying crazy things. later o that night Larry went back to my sister house and went ota tree in the back yard and wrapped er apple brand phone  charger  around a 10 Centimeter branch then held it around her neck and threatened IT agian. I stopped talking ot her from there and my sister called the police , i was on the phone wiht my sister while it all was happening at her house (i live in WV). We hung up after the police left. I came back home to NY 2 months ago to help my  elder parents (86).  1 month ago, larry asked me to get coffee one morning , so i agreed so we could talk and honestly i missed her and haven't seen her in 2 years and haven't talked to her in months. So she told me that she was going to bring Corny coffee for his bday, so i told her while she does that ,ill walk 4 block to DD and meet her there , SHE THEN BLEW UP , while i was walking to dunkin she came to my house and told my boyfriend i had a side dude in another city, etc(no he didn't believe her ), screamed at the top of her lungs on the hallway of my apartment ( i stay with my lil boo in a complex ).  He said we couldnt be together if i kept being her friend , 1. bc shes not a real friend and  2 . he doesn't want the drama .

So i decided to keep my friendship a secret , met her a few blocks away to hang out and all. Till  2 weeks ago, we were at her boyfriends hose and sisters boyfriends house , she did something really fake and while n one was around i question her about it(let her man driver her car with no license and not with her but told me no even tho when i used to live here she would let me lol)  She freaked out and made a scene , i almost drug her down the street , bc at that point i couldnt take it no more , all 6 years of me keeping calm and walking away and just al that stuff i wanted to finally get my lick back.

SO

During one of her recent episodes , she messaged me and said she put my SS#  on the black market, said she was going to ruin my life and so i posted the screen shot off the black market message  as a google review on her job(only BANK with that name in our city) , with contact under her FULL name and BDAY and # . Then called them nd acted as if I just closed a account with 1.2 mill , but of how viral she is going on tik tok for being a known scammer. Also might i add, she was a call center rep next door to the bank, so of course i called Customer Service , duhhh, and my the next day she was fired.

I just want to say sorry in advance for long text and bad orthography and gramatic, englush is my second language.
I meet this guy when I was 22years old and he just trun 19, he wasn't mature enough to my taste (I always date older guys) but he seems to have dreams and hope, witch i lost because I have several bad experience with other guys, I thought it was because I only experience with older, maby a young mind it makes everything diferent, anyway I don't want to be into unnecessary details.

We start living together after 4 months due to his parents kick him out just for came to visit me after I have a pretty bad car accident, and according with his parents the city i was living was dangerous, so he call me, and I feel obligated, I fell like it was my fault and I let him stay with me (I was independent already for about 4 years,  i was living with my brothers at that year because we move to USA  all together that year, we didi that way to save money and eventually split away) so he vall me on November asking me if can he move with me, so me being a people's please person  I say yes, I didn't want it we was just 4 months of relationship but I say yes, moving forward.

We star living together but he wasn't really smart with his money, he was all the time looking to eat restaurant food, buying new TV, new everything, video games etc... than is not the problem, the problem was that now we was 2 people on a small room so we was needing some basick things, we was working at same place, I was staying extra hour to do overtime but he decide just to wait for me at brake room some days he even loking for excuses to do not go to work, we talk and he agree to pay half of bills, rent, food etc, but time passed and he never paid fully the rent or whatever he was responsible, I always paying more than my part, this was a recurrent issue and still to now, we get into realy ugly discussion and fights, but honestly all this situation plus being new in a new country by almos my self, learning a language rules and etc, fealling far away my family (mom in another country) not able to save money as before because now I have to help my partner. *i need to give a little context here: my boyfriend start to buy me things like necklace and jewelry (I am the type of woman who don't wear that, I am more like a tomboy) but he insisted I deserve dating the diners he take me to eat and then later not able to pay rent and bills because he already buy me thing, that I don't even ask (and yes I talk to him about this several times I told him about priorities) so this lead to me saying no to eat outside then he always say he tries to be nice with me and give me what I deserve but I honestly will prefer him not to buy me things and pay his part on time, unfortunately this situation make other girls think he is amazing and I am a mean  girl who doesn't deserve him because I contact say no to this ""amazing"" treatment,  so time pass and my mental health just fall into the darkness I attempted to stop existing, and the hard part i evan talk to him about it, and my feelings but he seems never understand or maby he thinking the typical thought about me just being dramatic, honestly it was sings but anyway I ended on a mental hospital not able to work or pay anything, I have ti call him for hospital to give directions of how manage money because I will not be making money by being stuck in a hospital for about 10 days, he say the frases i will take care of everything I will help you pay your bills and bla bla bla, thing is he didn't when I get out it was a lot thing behind I have to work hard, and he always pushed payment behind.

# The Journey to Finding the Perfect Camping Mattress 🌟

Let me take you back to where my obsession with camping mattresses began. Picture this: It's 2009, I'm a broke college student attempting my first multi-week camping trip through Yellowstone. Armed with nothing but enthusiasm and a $20 foam pad from Walmart, I thought I was ready for anything. Spoiler alert: I wasn't.

After three sleepless nights of feeling every pebble through that paper-thin excuse for a mattress, I found myself googling ""can sleep deprivation cause hallucinations?"" while nursing my third cup of camp coffee. That experience kicked off my 15-year quest to find the perfect camping mattress, and now I'm here to share everything I've learned.

# Understanding Camping Mattress Technology 📚

Let's dive deep into the science and technology behind different types of camping mattresses. Trust me, this knowledge will save you both money and backaches.

# Air Mattresses: The Good, The Bad, and The Deflating

**Pros:**

* Excellent packability
* Customizable firmness
* Generally lightweight
* Great for occasional use

**Cons:**

* Risk of punctures
* Temperature sensitivity
* Can be noisy
* Requires inflation equipment

*Personal Experience:* Last summer, I took a premium air mattress to the Cascades. Around 2 AM, I woke up practically kissing the ground - a pinhole leak had gradually deflated my bed. Since then, I always pack a repair kit!

# Foam Mattresses: Old School Reliability

**Pros:**

* Virtually indestructible
* Consistent performance
* No setup required
* Great insulation

**Cons:**

* Bulky
* Heavy
* Non-adjustable firmness
* Can lose shape over time

# Self-Inflating Mattresses: The Happy Medium

**Pros:**

* Best of both worlds
* Reliable insulation
* Easy setup
* Durable

**Cons:**

* More expensive
* Heavier than pure air mattresses
* Can be bulky

# Comprehensive Comparison Table of Top Models

# In-Depth Reviews of Top Picks 🏆

# 1. Therm-a-Rest MondoKing 3D: The All-Around Champion

After using this mattress for over 100 nights across different seasons, I can confidently say it's worth every penny. Here's a detailed breakdown of my experience:

*Summer 2023, Glacier National Park:* Temperatures dropped to 40°F, but the R-value of 7.0 kept me toasty. The 4.25-inch thickness meant I could sleep on my side without shoulder pain, a game-changer for side sleepers like me.

**Key Features:**

* Dual valves for quick inflation/deflation
* Vertical sidewalls maximize sleeping space
* Stuff sack doubles as a pump
* Premium foam core

# 2. REI Camp Dreamer XL: The Value King

This mattress has accompanied me on 50+ nights of camping, and it continues to impress. Here's why it's my go-to recommendation for newcomers:

*Spring 2024 Group Camping Story:* During a large group camping trip in the Adirondacks, we had a impromptu ""mattress testing party"" where everyone tried each other's setups. The Camp Dreamer XL won the informal competition, leading to five separate purchases the following week!

**Standout Features:**

* Excellent value proposition
* User-friendly design
* Reliable construction
* Great customer support

# 3. Exped MegaMat Duo: The Couple's Dream

My wife and I have used this for two years of romantic getaways, and it's revolutionized our camping experience. Here's why:

*Anniversary Trip Tale:* During our 5th anniversary trip to Acadia National Park, we actually overslept and missed sunrise because we were so comfortable! The mattress handled both our different sleeping preferences perfectly - I like it firm, she prefers it softer.

**Notable Features:**

* Truly feels like a home mattress
* Outstanding insulation
* Great for couples with different preferences
* Excellent edge support

# The Science of Sleep Comfort While Camping 🔬

Let's talk about R-values and why they matter. The R-value measures insulation effectiveness - the higher the number, the better it prevents heat loss to the ground. Here's what you need:

* Summer camping: R-value 1-2
* 3-season camping: R-value 3-4
* Winter camping: R-value 5+

# Budget Considerations and Value Analysis 💰

After spending over $3000 on various mattresses (so you don't have to), here's my take on pricing:

**Entry Level ($50-100)**

* Good for: Occasional campers
* Expected lifespan: 1-2 seasons
* Best value: Klymit Static V

**Mid-Range ($100-200)**

* Good for: Regular campers
* Expected lifespan: 3-5 seasons
* Best value: REI Camp Dreamer XL

**Premium ($200+)**

* Good for: Frequent campers, extreme conditions
* Expected lifespan: 5+ seasons
* Best value: Therm-a-Rest MondoKing 3D

# Pro Tips from Years of Experience ⭐

1. **Temperature Management**
   * Use a blanket under your mattress in extreme cold
   * Consider tent placement for temperature regulation
   * Remember: ground temperature affects mattress performance
2. **Maintenance Secrets**
   * Store inflated at home
   * Use a ground cloth always
   * Clean with mild soap only
   * Store in a dry place
3. **Setup Optimization**
   * Level your tent site first
   * Pre-inflate at home before first use
   * Bring a battery-powered pump for air mattresses
   * Consider bringing a backup repair kit

# Common Mistakes to Avoid 🚫

1. **Buying Too Small** Always go bigger than you think you need - you'll thank me later!
2. **Ignoring R-Values** I learned this the hard way during a frigid spring camping trip.
3. **Skimping on Quality** Cheap mattresses often need replacement, costing more in the long run.

# Seasonal Considerations 🌞❄️

# Summer Camping

Focus on breathability and comfort over insulation.

# Winter Camping

Prioritize high R-values and reliable inflation systems (cold affects air pressure).

# Shoulder Seasons

Look for versatile options that can handle temperature swings.

# My Personal Camping Sleep System Evolution

2009: Walmart foam pad ($20) 2012: First self-inflating mattress ($89) 2015: Premium air mattress ($150) 2018: Therm-a-Rest MondoKing ($209) 2021: Exped MegaMat Duo ($299)

# Final Thoughts and Future Trends 🔮

After 15 years of camping and countless nights under the stars, I've watched camping mattress technology evolve dramatically. The future looks bright with new materials and hybrid designs emerging.

Remember: The best mattress is the one that gets you outdoors more often. Don't let poor sleep keep you from experiencing the beauty of nature.

When rents and other costs rise so much that long-time residents of a community get displaced, demographers and sociologists generally consider that to be gentrification.

It’s more than just a concept, though, for people experiencing it firsthand, and it’s now happening to some residents in neighborhoods once thought by many people to be immune from displacing development.

People greeted him with a handshake, and during coffee hour, people didn’t really speak to him much. I assume it was mostly a language barrier since it was a Russian service and crowd. He seemed content to sit on the side, tend to the cats, and just asked a fellow visitor to play the flute he carried.

Given the recent election results, we are looking to leave the very red state of Ohio and move from Columbus to the city of Chicago. We are a gay male couple, ages 51 and 66. We are looking at this as our last move and where we will settle, retire, and live out the last years of our lives. We are also looking at it as an adventure. We are both very analytical and tend to overthink, which is probably why we are more than a little overwhelmed doing research.

We have been researching real estate and YouTube videos of various neighborhoods and reading threads to try and suss out where we should focus our search. We currently live in a peaceful, quiet suburb of Columbus about 20 minutes from the city. That said, we are both urban guys. We love the vibrancy and diversity of living in or close to a city.

So...what are we looking for? We don't want to be so far removed from downtown that it's a hassle to get there to see a show or go out to eat. We love culture, particularly theatre, museums, comedy clubs, coffee shops, small businesses, the symphony. I am a runner, and we both go to the gym. Ideally, we would want to be less than 15-20 minutes walk to public transit and have relatively easy access to grocery stores, coffee shops, and dining options, especially as we get up there in years. We are looking to purchase a condo, and our budget will be in the $300K - $375K range.

1gya23i,https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowsHelp/comments/1gya23i/complete_guide_to_fixing_tpm_secure_boot_and/,"Complete Guide to Fixing TPM, Secure Boot, and BitLocker on Windows (After Cloning) - The guide is for anyone that want to clone their drive to upgrade their hard drive on laptops or PCs - tested on Windows 11. Fixed: Kernel Security Check Failure and Raid / AHCI issues","# BitLocker Setup & Cloning Guide: Fixing TPM, Secure Boot, and BitLocker Issues After Cloning a Drive

I spent a week troubleshooting and figured out a solution after dealing with constant **Kernel Security Check Failure** BSODs when swapping out my NVMe SSD in my Dell Precision laptop for a larger 4TB drive. Here's the guide to help you avoid the same pitfalls I ran into.

---

## Tools You’ll Need:
- **Coffee** (hopefully not as much as I consumed)
- **MiniTool Partition Wizard**: Best cloning tool I found. Macrium Reflect caused problems, and the Dell cloning tool didn’t work at all. I had to buy MiniTool to get this done.
- **USB Enclosure** for your new drive (if cloning externally).

---

## Before You Clone: Switch from RAID to AHCI

This is crucial for compatibility after cloning. If you don’t switch to AHCI mode, you’ll run into boot issues.

### Step 1: Prepare for AHCI Mode (Enable Safe Mode)
1. Open **Command Prompt as Administrator** (Search for `cmd`, right-click, and select “Run as Administrator”).
2. Run the following command to boot into Safe Mode:
    ```powershell
    bcdedit /set {current} safeboot minimal
    ```
3. Restart your system. It will boot into Safe Mode.

### Step 2: Change to AHCI in BIOS
1. Restart your system and enter **BIOS/UEFI** (press F2, DEL, or ESC depending on your device).
2. Find **SATA Mode** (often under **Advanced** or **Storage Configuration**) and change it from **RAID** to **AHCI**.
3. Save and exit BIOS.

### Step 3: Exit Safe Mode
1. Once you boot back into Safe Mode, open **Command Prompt** as Administrator again.
2. Run this command to disable Safe Mode:
    ```powershell
    bcdedit /deletevalue {current} safeboot
    ```
3. Restart, and your system should boot normally in AHCI mode.

---

## Cloning Your Drive

### Step 1: Clone with MiniTool Partition Wizard
1. Download and install **MiniTool Partition Wizard**.
2. Launch the program and select your **old drive** as the source and your **new SSD** as the destination.
3. Make sure to clone all partitions, including system reserved partitions, to ensure proper boot functionality. And set it to clone partition exact size. You can resize the partition after this marathon is done easily via the same tool to merge the unallocated space

---

## After Cloning: Resolving TPM Issues as bitlocker will give you an error saying this device cannot use a trusted platform module. 

TPM can sometimes get ""confused"" after a clone, and we’ll need to reset it as it still thinks there is old hard drive.

### Step 1: Clear TPM in BIOS
1. Restart and enter **BIOS/UEFI**.
2. Find **TPM settings** (under **Security** or **Advanced**).
3. Select **Clear TPM** and save changes. Restart the system.

### Step 2: Initialize TPM (If Needed)
1. Press **Win + R**, type `tpm.msc`, and press **Enter**.
2. If you see a message about TPM not being initialized, click **Prepare TPM**. You will need to clear it first , so clear it via the tool or command Clear-Tpm

3. Alternatively, you can initialize it manually:
    ```powershell
    Initialize-Tpm
    ```

### Step 3: Verify TPM Status
1. Open **PowerShell** as Administrator.
2. Run:
    ```powershell
    Get-Tpm
    ```
3. Check that **TpmPresent** and **TpmReady** are both **True**. If **TpmOwned** is False, run:
    ```powershell
    Take-TpmOwnership
    ```
You may need to give several restarts - follow accordingly. We need to unlock the tpm - thats the objective. If you have problems, make sure drive use uefi - use command bcdedit
Also check the bitlocker logs - eventviewer is your best friend
Verify with BitLocker Logs
Check the BitLocker logs for more specific errors related to Secure Boot or UEFI variables.

Open Event Viewer (Win + X, then Event Viewer).
Navigate to:
Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > BitLocker-API.

---

## Enable Secure Boot - turns out after cloning this is disabled in bios and cause problems.

### Step 1: Enable Secure Boot in BIOS
1. Restart your system and enter **BIOS/UEFI**.
2. Under **Boot** or **Security**, enable **Secure Boot**.
3. Save and exit BIOS.

### Step 2: Verify Secure Boot in Windows
1. Open **PowerShell** and run:
    ```powershell
    Get-SecureBootPolicy
    ```
2. Ensure **SecureBootEnabled** is **True**.

---

## Configure Group Policies for BitLocker

### Step 1: Open Group Policy Editor
1. Press **Win + R**, type `gpedit.msc`, and press **Enter**.
2. Navigate to **Local Computer Policy** > **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **BitLocker Drive Encryption**.

### Step 2: Modify Policies
1. Ensure **Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM** is set to **Disabled**.
 then run the command gpupdate /force

By now - you may need to restart again. run the tpm check command to make sure that tpmenabled, ready and tpmowned are all true. and securebootenabled is true (if not - fight with gpt for a bit to help you with the errors you get - it will all be commands the same as the above steps)

---

## Enable BitLocker

### Step 1: Enable BitLocker from Control Panel
1. Go to **Control Panel** > **BitLocker Drive Encryption**.
2. Click **Turn on BitLocker** for the C: drive.
3. Choose how to store your recovery key (either save to a **Microsoft account** or **USB drive**).
4. Follow the on-screen prompts and finish the BitLocker setup.

### Step 2: Enable BitLocker via PowerShell (If Control Panel Fails which is likely)
If BitLocker fails via Control Panel, use **PowerShell**:
1. Start encryption with **TPM** protector:
    ```powershell
    Enable-BitLocker -MountPoint ""C:"" -EncryptionMethod Aes128 -TpmProtector
    ```

### Step 3: Add a Recovery Password (if needed)
1. After encryption, add a **Recovery Password** using:
    ```powershell
    manage-bde -protectors -delete C: -t externalkey
    ```

2. To check encryption status, use:
    ```powershell
    Get-BitLockerVolume
    ```

3. BitLocker will now allow you to backup the recovery key via **Control Panel**. (it won't show backup commands before that)

---

## Clean Up BEK Files (BitLocker Key Files)

1. To remove old external key files, use:
    ```powershell
    manage-bde -protectors -get C:
    manage-bde -protectors -delete C: -t externalkey
    ```

This will leave you with just the **TPM** and **Recovery Password**, cleaning up the process.

Now you can use the partition tool to expand your drive volume and take the unallocated space!

---

## Troubleshooting Common BitLocker Errors

1. **Secure Boot**: Ensure **Secure Boot** is enabled in BIOS and UEFI is selected (not Legacy).
2. **TPM Ownership**: Use `Get-Tpm` to check if **TpmOwned** is **True**. If not, initialize TPM with `Initialize-Tpm` or reset it with `Clear-Tpm`.
3. **Pending BitLocker Operations**: If BitLocker encryption is stuck or you get a message that BitLocker operations are in progress, run:
    ```powershell
    Manage-bde -status C:
    ```
4. **Group Policy Settings**: Ensure that **Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM** is set to **Disabled**.

---

## Final Checklist

1. **AHCI Mode**: Successfully switched to AHCI in BIOS WITH YOUR OLD HARD DRIVE - RAID WILL FAIL AND ITS THE REASON FOR THE KERNEL ERROR. ALSO AHCI FOR SOME REASON SEEM FASTER
2. **Cloning**: The old drive was cloned correctly with all partitions.
3. **TPM**: Initialized TPM and took ownership.
4. **Secure Boot**: Verified Secure Boot is enabled.
5. **Group Policies**: Correct policies configured for BitLocker and TPM.

1gya227,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1gya227/quitting_pinterest_advice/,Quitting pinterest - advice:),"Hi! First time poster, have benefited from the sub-reddit's wisdom and resources for ages.

**The gist**

After some reflection, I’ve blocked Pinterest (using the Freedom app) and I’m looking for real-life alternatives, and any broader advice around quitting.

**The context**

I did find joy and inspiration in Pinterest for a long time, mainly using it for fashion and interior design inspo. I’ve been improving my style and doing up my house, and Pinterest has definitely been a big part of these processes. 

However, I’ve noticed that I was **1)** starting to chase unattainable perfection through the platform. I started to feel disappointed with my wardrobe, sense of style, and the apartment I share with my partner - even though I am lucky to have some lovely clothes and a really nice place to live. Having quit Twitter, Instagram and Facebook among a few other sites, I also observed **(2)** increased mindless and automatic scrolling on Pinterest. This was starting to happen at the expense of other activities, such as my meditation practice and yoga. It also fuelled **3)** increased spending on objects and clothes. 

**Moving forward** 

I know that Pinterest isn’t the worst platform in comparison to others, and I might miss it as a source of creative inspiration. So, I plan to buy a couple of interiors / fashion coffee table books. This way I will still be able to engage with my interests in a way that is not addictive or controlled by an algorithm.

I would be really keen to hear your experiences with seeking creative / arty inspiration offline, and specifically if anyone else has decided to move on from Pinterest.

For most of our marriage he has been in some one leadership position or another. He was a counselor in the bishopric when I started my faith crisis and a HC when I finally had it quit altogether. Since I quit, he has still gone to every meeting, done his ministering, drops family plans to run off and do church things, or give blessings, etc. 
However, at home, he acts like a PIMO. He never prays (and this stopped well before I left), he steals sips of my coffee or cocktail (usually when we are on vacation), he doesn't go to the temple unless it's a family thing. He will occasionally say something about a calling being God's will or something, but doesn't say much else. 
 I don't want to push him where he isn't ready to go. But why is he still going if he doesn't believe, and if he does believe why is he so casual about it?

Earlier today, about 30-45 minutes after making my coffee, the steam wand randomly turned on and started releasing the pressure. The machine was on and at temp (200F). I tried using the knob to stop it, but it wasn't reacting to any inputs and kept releasing steam. It wouldn't stop even if I turned off the machine. The only thing that would stop it is:

a) Unplugging the machine  
b) Pulling the steam wand out and away from the machine

After the machine had cooled off and I restarted it, it worked as normal for about 30-45 minutes, before releasing steam randomly, once again. I reset it to factory settings, which didn't solve the issue. I am planning on opening it up and seeing what's going on inside later this weekend. If I had to guess, I think the issue could be related to:

1. Too much pressure being built
2. Steam/water leak inside, leading to bad electrical connections

Am I off base? What should I check first? THANK YOU!

I had taken a break from dating. I have recently gone on the apps here and been on some dates. When I go for lunches or any outings with my friends - we always split the bill. Which makes complete sense. 

However, I have been on recent dates here and all dates I have been on ( except one guy) , I have always paid for my share, especially first dates. For all these first dates, the guys asked me out for dinner and I always tell them I prefer a coffee date for meeting first time. However they insist we need more time to know each other so dinner/lunch it will be. And then we end up splitting the bill. On one of the dates, the guy paid for my share but immediately asked me to PAYID my share. I found that kinda rude coz I’m not that immediate even with my friends. I did PayId him as soon as I could. Later, He went on a mini rant on how girls exploit men for expensive dates and recounted his bad experience with a girl who dumped a huge bill on him and did apologise that he categorised me similar to her but this upfront - pay your share - is weird to me.


On other occasions, the men didn’t even acknowledge the fact that I paid my share without asking. Now I have lived in Asia, uk , USa and dated there and never have guys asked me to pay. Though I don’t believe men should always pay so I would take turns and pay as well. 



TLDR: 43F, new to Australia. I’m new to Australian dating culture so I’m just wondering if paying 50-50 even if the date is suggested by the guy is the norm here. My girl friends here say it is not and men doing that are cheap. I don’t mind paying 50-50 if that’s the norm here. And why don’t guys agree to a simple coffee date and insist on dinner dates. Life is expensive here and I can’t be going out for expensive dinners 1-2 times a week. I’m a very outdoorsy person and prefer dates which are grab a coffee and let’s walk or hike etc. I’m not a restaurant enthusiast.",26,1732396254.0,AskAnAustralian,87,0.77,False

1gy9xzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1gy9xzg/120_days_today_nights_weekends_and_holidays_no/,"120 days today, nights weekends and holidays. No time off for good behavior ","Today I crossed the 120 day, 4 month mark. I am shocked, and grateful. I picked up my 4 month chip this morning, and felt feelings. I shed a tear or two.  121 days ago, I could not imagine going 24 hours without a drink, why would I want to?

Some things I’ve really become aware of and started noticing in myself, and just somethings that have happened in the last 4 months.

1.      I’ve lost around 32 pounds and have been holding steady. I’ve discovered in the last month or so, Butter Pecan ice cream. And with the money I’ve been saving, I’ve quickly worked my way up to getting the best quality I can get my grubby little mitts on.  This stuff is amazing, and I feel like my entire life has been a lie up to this point.

2.      I sleep way WAY less than I used to, AND I have WAY more energy now. It’s crazy. I usually get between 5 and 6 hours of sleep now. Wake up, and don’t need coffee, but I still have some. It’s mind blowing (referring to energy). Again, 121 days ago, I’d wake up, puke, explosive diarrhea or both.

3.      I am now actively working on cleaning up, literally my house, my finances, myself my healing, my relationships. This has just sort of come ‘naturally’ I suppose. I tried forcing things like this when I first started, and have dialed it back, and just trying to relax now.

4.      A friend told me today, that she quit smoking 2 weeks ago, and that I inspired her. That was a gut punch to the feels.

5.      I’ve discovered more about myself, and why I drank the way I have. I am a survivor of CPTSD.

6.      I am becoming my own best company. I still avoid people for the most part, but it’s on my list. I have a small group, and that’s enough for me, for now.

And I really want to reach out to the people that identify as absolute cynics, drink, drug, whatever as hard as possible. I see you, I feel you. I am trying to be as honest, and authentic as I know how to be. I don’t have a partner, family, and when I’ve read peoples shares, I thought they were full of shit, and embellishing. Your mileage may very, but I know I am not.

I no longer see sobriety or recovery about comparison with anyone, this is just my experience.

I saw someone post this the other day, and it really resonated with me. Being hard on myself “to always do better”. I am data, facts, analyzing person, several partners have called me Spock. I am now really trying to “Stop and smell the Roses”, listen to the music as a whole, not just pieces to be analyzed. Relax from time to time. Yes, I am still wanting to do better, hell, I’m sober!!!! I mean, if you knew me IRL, shit you’d know that’s a miracle! So I guess I’ll leave on that note, another gift of sobriety, changing my perspective.

As the crescent moon took its position more than a quarter high in the sky, the liveliness of Halloween was coming to an end. Sullivan Street was retiring for the night as door lights flicked off and trick-or-treaters returned to their homes. The tree-lined street was a shadow of its former self, no longer lively and bright. Now, a sleepy silence and smothering darkness took hold of it. There was the sound of slapping footsteps from this silence as one little princess made her way home. 



Fitting tightly into a Carolina blue princess dress, she made the solo journey home. A blizzard-blue mesh cape moved behind her like a living thing, stirring up leaves in her wake. It wasn't a windy night, but a looming winter wind was present that rustled the trees overhead. It caught and tugged at the bottom of the cape and tangled up the mop of copper coils on her head. It also rose tiny bumps along her bare arms from its bitter bite. 



With the darkness of 9 PM, the girl was left with only the company of decorative ghouls and dimming jack-o-lanterns. Even with this frightful scenery, she still walked with a pep in her step that caused her plastic blue slip-on heels to slap the dark pavement of the street. With each step and clap of the shoes, the white glow stick that dangled from a black cord around her neck slapped her chest. She persistently made her way home, glancing at the houses she passed by every once in a while until one finally captured her attention. 



It stood out against the neighborhood of ranch-style homes with its dark grey vinyl exterior and bright yellow door. The curtains were drawn closed, but bright light still slipped onto the front yard, beckoning her. This was home. Traveling up the stone path, she passed by a decorative graveyard and four carved pumpkins, including a golden Elsa who smiled at her as she passed by. Soon she stood before the front door, hesitating to push the glowing button and ring the bell. Instead, she quickly looked down at herself, evaluating her appearance. She twisted slightly and even took a glance at her backside. Feeling satisfied, she shimmied her shoulders loosely and rang the bell. 



The house came alive as crying erupted from inside, and a set of heavy footprints thumped toward the door. They stopped before it, and she felt eyes on her for a moment. ""Livie!"" a soft, muffled voice called to her from the other side before metal links clinging could be heard as Sonya removed the chain. It wasn't a second later that the yellow door opened, and the cool white light from within fell upon Livie. The sudden contrast of lighting from darkness to light caused the young girl's vision to be speckled with black as she stepped into the house's threshold.



""How was it?"" Sonya asked as she rested her secondary hand on Livie's tangled copper curls, the other pulling the door shut and switching the lock. She playfully wiggled her left hand, causing Liv's head to sway back and forth before giving it a final pat and releasing. ""Liv?"" 



""Mmm…"" Livie responded as her eyes hungrily took up the scenery of the threshold. Her dark eyes leaped from the small modern chandelier dangling from the ceiling with its orb bulbs to the square archways on both the left and right sides of the small space. ""Good."" she hummed happily, but her face said otherwise as her nose scrunched up in distaste. The smell of freshly set paint assaulted her nose from the right, and the overpowering scent of milk wafted in from the left. Together they made a gag-worthy aroma that Liv could taste on her tongue.



""That's good!"" Sonya cheered a bit too enthusiastically as she came around to the front of the little girl. Although she hadn't stepped beyond the front door, Sonya didn't miss a chance to join in on the Halloween festivities. As she walked into view, a skintight pleather suit was revealed, along with cat ears that rested on top of Sonya's blond bob."" I told your father that you'd be fine."" She bent down to align their gazes, chocolate dark against pale hazel, her claw-like hands resting on her bent knees. ""Did you get a lot of candy?""



Liv's gaze slipped down to Sonya's wide smile that was painted in a bold, bloody red. Her straight pearly whites captured the child's focus. ""Yeah,"" Livie said in a neutral tone as she brought her pillowcase forward, nearly bumping Sonya.



The woman looked down at the bag of candy brought forward to her. ""Woooaaah, that is a lot, Liv!"" Treats halfway filled the Frozen pillowcase she had dug out of the linen closet for the little girl. ""I think that's even more than last year,"" Sonya chuckled. In the next moment, her face softened as she looked at Liv's face. ""You sure you had a good time Livie?"" 



""I did."" Livie beamed. The two shared a look and a smile as Sonya raised her hand and cupped the little girl's round cheek. 



Her thumb made small comforting strokes beneath Livie's eyes. ""I'm glad,"" she said before straightening back up. ""I'm sorry about your father, hun,"" Sonya sighed as she opened up the pillowcase and stole Reese's. As she kneaded it, checking for air, she gave Livie the same excuse she had heard over the phone. ""He said he wished he could've met you, but he's stuck in traffic."" She peeled the Reese's and took a bite. ""He's proud of you."" As she looked down at Liv with warm eyes, she froze. 



Quickly she dropped into a crouch as her hand wrapped gently around Livie's calf and inspected the shoe on her right foot. The top of the shoe had red droplets on it. ""Did you get hurt,"" Sonya looked up at Livie, her brows drawn in with concern. 



Quickly Livie shook her head no, her curls bouncing. ""It's-"" before she could get the words out, a screech rang out to the left that had Livie flinching and gripping her ears. The cry stole the conversation away as Sonya stood up and rushed into the left room. ""Sorry, Livie,"" she cried out as she took a turn out of sight. ""I'll check your candy in the living room.""



Livie stared into the archway Sonya had disappeared into. She could only see a large stainless steel refrigerator, dark wooden cabinets, and marble-tiled flooring.  There was no sight of Sonya or the noise maker, although Liv knew they were just around the corner. She could hear poor Sonya dealing with the baby as clearly as day. After a few moments, she turned her gaze to the right archway. She could see a large television and the leather back of a sofa from where she stood. The child gave the archway Sonya had gone through a glance. She could hear Sonya trying to comfort the infant from within. ""Charlie, what is it?"" Her voice cared an undertone of desperation.



Liv didn't focus on the rest as she headed into the living room, though Charlie's crying could still be heard. The living room was small, mostly occupied by a black leather sectional that was a bit too big. In front of it was a soft and fluffy carpet that Livie couldn't resist as she came around, dodging opened paint buckets, and sat down. First, she dropped her bag of candy before she flopped down next to it, her small fingers raking through the taupe faux fur as she continued to look around. Straightening her legs, she slipped them beneath the minimalistic glass coffee table that occupied the middle of the room and the rug. On its surface were baby toys and snacks and one Elsa figurine that could fit perfectly into Liv's hand. 



As she sat and waited for Sonya to return to check the Halloween candy, she gazed into the dark reflection of the large TV screen. Her feet idly tapping together. Clack, Clack, Clack. Her gaze soon roamed the walls that were trimmed with dark blue tape and painted a pale sage green. They were void of anything else, no photos, posters, shelves, or other oddities. Eventually, the sound of plastic tapping plastic bothered even her, so Livie slipped off her plastic dress-up shoes and pulled her legs closer to her. Bending them, so she was sitting crisscrossed. She leaned to her right to dig into her candy bag but was stopped by a small cough.



A tickle crawled up Liv’s throat, forcing its way out of her small lips and into the palm she used to cover it up. A droplet of blood rested in the center when she withdrew her small hand from her mouth. Frowning at the sight, she lifted her brown eyes to the archway entrance to see if she had been seen as she wiped the red liquid into the carpet.  



“I’m sorry, Liv,” Sonya called from the other room. Livie, still feeling a tickle in her throat, began sticking her finger into her mouth. “Give me a few minutes to settle Charlie, and I’ll check your candy!” 



“Mhm,” Livie responded, two fingers knuckle deep down her throat, squirming them around. As she continued her search, she noticed the sounds from the other room. Charlie was screeching his throat raw and Sonya fruitlessly soothing him. Her fingers continued deeper into her throat, her fingers running down the walls of it, caking them in a film of thick mucus.



 “Charlie,” Sonya whined in a voice filled with despair. Charlie continued his temper tantrum. Livie reached her itch. With dark eyes wide and a face showing accomplishment, she quickly withdrew her digits from the warm orifice. Thick threads of saliva webbed between the two fingers, becoming thinner as she put more distance between her mouth and hand. She pinched a baby molar between her two fingers, slick with blood and saliva. She stared at it, lost in thought. Her brown eyes were unblinking and unnerving. 



Another tickle caused her to cough out some more blood onto the carpet and a clump of dark red hair. The cough didn’t go unnoticed by Sonya, who now leaned against the archway. Charlie swaddled and silent in the nook of her arm. “Livie,” Sonya called out, concerned. Alarmed that she had been seen, Livie quickly brought her hand down to the carpet, concealing the small tooth under her hand. Her head twisted sharply to look at Sonya. Her eyes opened wide and defenseless. “You’ve been coughing a lot. Are you getting sick?” Sonya asked. She couldn’t see below Livie’s shoulders, oblivious to the fleshy mess now staining the taupe carpet. From the angle Livie sat,  Sonya wasn’t even able to get a good look at what her stepdaughter had been holding up to the light. Instead, her mind filled in the gaps, and she concluded that Liv had already begun inspecting the candy. 



Realizing that Sonya was oblivious, Livie smiled in relief. Her face shined with innocence as she nodded her head, her curls bouncing with the movement. “I’m alright,” she responded in an easygoing tone. The tooth dug into her palm, imprinting it.

•   •   •   •   •

Livie grasped the glow stick tightly in her small hands as she brought it up to her chest fearfully. Sonya wasn't able to take her out trick-or-treating like years prior. This year, she was occupied with the always-crying Charlie. Liv hated Charlie. He fussed, screamed, and pulled at her curls. There was never a moment he was quiet and content. Not only that, but he sucked up the attention of their father and Sonya constantly. Like today. 



Today, Liv, Sonya, and Charlie had been dressed and prepared to stalk the streets for treats. Livie as Elsa, Sonya Cat Woman, and Charlie Batman. That all changed when Charlie began crying and didn't stop. Frantic, Sonya tried to appease him, but, of course, nothing did.



Instead, Livie had to beg to go by herself. She promised she would be safe and careful, and when her father came home, he would meet her. He never did. 



The young girl wasn't sure how much time had passed since she began trick-or-treating, but she knew it must have been long. The streets were quieting, there were fewer homes with candy, and her limbs were aching. She wanted to go home. 



Now she walked alone on Pine Avenue, clutching the glow stick Sonya had given her like her life depended on it. To her right was the woods, the large looming trees terrifying her. To the left side were houses void of any lights to prevent trick-or-treaters from approaching. They offered no comfort as she dragged her feet forward. This was the shortest way home. It was too late to back down. 



Fighting back the tears, Livie hummed a song by Elsa. Her off-tuned humming was the only sound heard on the avenue, unnerving her further. As her imagination and the influence of Halloween weighed on her mind, her gaze kept flickering to the left side of the road. She prayed nothing would look back at her, but she also couldn't look away. Instinct told her to keep her eyes on the woods. Better to see the danger than to be surprised by it. 



Soon she began to feel unnerved. Her speed increased, her humming sped up, and her heart raced painfully in her tiny chest. Soon she was running down the street, letting out whimpers as she kept glancing beside her to the forest. To her horror, a shadow kept speed with her. Eyes widening in shock and fear, she let go of her bag of candy and focused entirely on the creature and running.



The creature, whatever it was, was far superior in speed compared to a young child. Livie realized this too late. Just as a scream crawled out of her mouth, she was slammed onto the ground. She could feel the pressure pushing painfully into her small side as they collided. A tear escaped her eyes. She hit the concrete hard, her head bouncing painfully. For a minute, she lay dazed- only feeling pain, before she drew in a shaky breath. Even that hurt. She suddenly became aware of her ribs as her lungs expanded and filled with a searing pain that scrambled her mind. She wanted to cry, yet she couldn't remember how to. Instead, a meek sound escaped her throat, followed by a bubble of blood that erupted and cascaded down her cheek. 



Livie watched as a small pool of blood spread out from her face, the hair on that side sticking to her pale cheeks. Her mind felt weird. Like a spider had taken nest in her brain and had formed webs that made everything cloudy. What happened? As she struggled to piece together thoughts, a pink-clawed hand came down in front of her face. The nails were short but sharp and a dirty yellow. A moment later, a face came down with it, resting its cheek on the ground so it was eye-to-eye with Liv. 



""Hi,"" it said in a surprisingly human voice. Its skin was a fleshy pink- like Livie's finger when she burnt it. Its mouth was pulled into a broad smile, revealing aged and decayed human teeth. It looked more like a monkey baring its teeth at her, and it wasn't a welcoming sight. Upwards there was nothing much to look at. Only two wide slits flared once in a while as the creature sniffed her. There were no eyes; instead, the skin was completely smooth where they should have been. Its appearance made Liv whimper and want to shut her eyes, but even though her eyelids felt heavy, they wouldn't close.



""Aww,"" the creature said, its hand moving to stroke Liv's cheek. ""Don't cry."" Livie didn't even know she was crying. She didn't even feel the tears, but she did feel the cold and sticky caress on her cheek. ""It's going to be quick. I promise."" 



Livie couldn't move, nor could she form the words to ask what it meant. She couldn't do anything as the creature lifted her hand and placed her fingers in its mouth. She watched as it smiled before crunching down on her tiny fingers. She felt that. The pain was cold and awakening, yet Livie could only whimper as it gnawed on her digits. A gurgling choke slipped from her mouth. 



As it chewed and swallowed, it's hand that laid on the ground before Liv's eyes began to transform into her skin and flesh. Soon she was looking at her own hand attached to the thing. ",2,1732396122.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Please note it’s on Wednesday. 

The Coffee Pot Restaurant will hold its 15th annual free community Thanksgiving dinner on Wednesday, Nov. 27, from 4 to 7 p.m., with donations taken to benefit the Sedona Community Food Bank. 

“It’s a communal-style seating event, and our staff all works it free of charge, and sometimes other family members of theirs come in to pitch a hand, to lend a hand as well,” said Damien Daher, one of the sons of owner Emilie Daher. “It’s just a good time, something we love doing.” 

The Daher family started the tradition in response to the Great Recession of 2008 to offer a meal and a warm and welcoming place to those in need or those who had no one with whom to spend Thanksgiving. The dinner has since grown into an event open to everyone from everywhere.

Literally no contact - no texting, social media, ect. We didn’t share the same friends so I had no idea what she was up to these last 2 years. A few days ago I was feeling lonely and was drunk so I texted her to meet up, she responded enthusiastically.

This morning we got coffee, walked around her neighborhood, caught up, and said our goodbyes. Very cordial. Nothing has changed. She’s up to what she had been up to before, I am doing the same thing I was. It was clear the reasons we couldn’t work together were still there. I want to see someone fairly often, eventually marry, and then later have kids. She wants a very independent life that involves seeing someone maybe once a week, not getting married or moving in together, and definitely never having kids.

We hugged and I took the train home. I now overall feel not happy or sad but just sorrow and grief. We had an amazing relationship, for the year we dated I gave her my everything. It was probably the happiest I ever felt in my entire life. The last 2 years have been nice but nothing special. No relationships, just living. Ive gone on plenty of dates, but feeling a connection is seldom. Life is good but seeing her was a reminder of what life could be. In the last few hours everything has seemed meaningless. What’s the point of doing things if you don’t have someone to share them with? I know, dumb thoughts, thoughts I had gotten over 2 years ago, but now they’re back.

I knew seeing her would put me in this mindset, but I honestly welcomed it as part of the reason for reaching out. To feel something - to remember what it was like to be with her and in a relationship. It feels like opening a box of old things you had forgotten about. Suddenly all these memories I had packed away a long time ago are coming back. Very happy memories. I’m happy they happened, but I’m sad they’re gone, and I’m sad and frankly scared at the thought of what could have been. What if we could have worked out? What if I had been more patient? There would be a lot more of these memories, and maybe I wouldn’t be sitting on my couch alone in my apartment.

Oh yeah, and she was just as beautiful as I remembered.",18,1732394248.0,rs_x,3,0.88,False

GENRE: Indie pop, alternative rock, singer-songwriter

>Bea Kristi writes gentle, dreamy indie-pop songs riddled with sharp observations; they sound like a carefully drawn musical map of her inner world, sung in a welcoming whisper. Born in the Philippines and raised in London, she started recording songs in her late teens, inspired by the lo-fi charm of Kimya Dawson and the soundtrack to the film Juno. She released her beguiling calling card, the woozy “Coffee”—an immediate internet hit, thanks to a fan-uploaded video—in 2017. Her subsequent EPs introduced a more earthy indie-rock tone, with rowdy guitars (“She Plays Bass”) and girl-group harmonies.

The 3 motors are connected to a 6 speed automatic gearbox based on the design Scania uses in their hybrid trucks. 

The truck: Scania has built the 45S in a way where it shares most of its construction with the normal diesel and LNG trucks. it uses the same frame and cab and everything aside from the 3 motors are powered by two 12v batteries connected in paralel providing 12V and 24V power to the cab and all other components like lights and the air compressor. The end result of this is that it shares a lot of the parts with the other trucks already in our fleet and most of the day to day maintenance can be done by us

Driving it: Since it is in most aspects identical to a diesel truck there are also very few differences when it comes to actually driving it. The dash board and cab is the exact same so you just press the brake pedal and turn the key like any other diesel powered Scania and it uses the same lever on the right side of the steering wheel to control the gear shift and regeneration as a diesel would use for its gear shift and retarder/engine braking. This also includes the option for manually changing gears which makes this one of the very few electric vehicles where you can actually change the gears yourself and this is something i use in my day to day driving. For example locking it in to a gear when going up a icy road to stop it from changing gear in the middle of it, kicking it down a gear or two to get better regeneration braking, and getting it in a lower gear for hills.

Range: Range is a bit hard to define because the terrain and loads change a lot plus we deliver multiple loads in a trip so an hour in to an all day trip i could already have emptied half of the truck. at 50t/110k lbs it does around 200-220km/124-136miles, but when taking in to account that i usually don't drive fully loaded the entire way i can go 300km/186miles or more before i have to charge for the first time. And most of the time when i have to charge it can all be done during my mandated 45 minute break period and a lot of the days i don't use any extra time compared to if i had driven a diesel powered truck. Having tested it in down to -15c/5f i have yet to see any range difference and i am quite often beating the range estimate given in the dash board. This estimate is based on the weight of the truck which it can read and you have a per axle read out in the display. This is thanks to the batteries being heated while you charge so combine that with the Scania app that allows you to set your departure time it will ensure that when you arrive in the morning the batteries and the cab are up to temperature. 

Charging: It can charge of any charging station that has a CCS charger that provides 800v. It can charge at up to 375kwh all the way from empty to 100% but realistically even on 400kwh chargers it usually hovers around 360-370. The charger is located behind the front wheels on the drivers side and after unhooking the trailer i have generally no problem getting in to a normal car charger. I do take up more space than a normal car, but with the amount of chargers available i have never experienced to be at a station where the spot i am blocking is the only unused one and there are now several truck only chargers being built that are designed with the extra space needed in mind

The good things: I love this truck and i don't ever want to go back to diesel. The ride is almost silent compared to a diesel and there are no vibrations at all. It has a lot of power and while on shorter hills a high power diesel can climb it faster on a longer hill the flat power curve combined with the fewer gears (you can do the national speed limit of trucks and then some in 2nd gear) you can qute easy forget that you are pulling up to 60t/132k lbs. 

The not so good things: All in all i have not found anything deal breaking with the truck and most of what i can comment on is the same in the diesel variant, but here are a couple. The size and weight of the batteries makes it some times hard to load right since it very quickly gets front heavy and they leave little room for anything else like hydraulic PTO systems and storage racks. The button for unlocking the charger sits right besides the socket and can be pressed with the truck locked. Pressing it will send a signal to the charger to stop charging and anyone that mislike EVs could go around and press the button while i am waiting on it to charge and i would not know until i came back or checked the app. The Volvo electric truck which i have tested and posted about in this subreddit back in the summer solved this with you needing to use the remote to unlock the vehicle becore the disconnect button becomes active. 

The quirks: Here are some things that did not fit in any of the other categories but i would like to talk about. 

1) Compared to a American truck it is fairly small but it got a lot of features still. As equiped it has a microwave, fridge head unit with Apple Car Play, heater and AC available when standing, coffee maker, TV mount which i have utilized and a lot of power outputs. 6 12V outlets, 1 24V outlet, and 5 USB ports

2) Despite being a large truck it is very manouverable thanks to it also having rear steering. A fair bit of my driving is Oslo, the capital of norway, and other old cities and it feels perfectly at home navigating those cities. 

3) A little while back i was along side another EV truck driver interviewed by the Norwegian EV youtuber Tesla Bjørn. Here is the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwQ-cqz7g4k",53,1732394212.0,electricvehicles,14,1.0,False

As Mr. Oracle drank the freshly brewed coffee of the judges table at the community center at the community hall in Royan-Noranda, Quebec, which in every Saturday afternoon turned into the Thunderdome as  the local senior community came to play their monthly community bingo match with a prize pot of $500, in which friendships are ruined and old scores settled like a duel that never ends.

As the game progressed Oracle dressed in his red maroon blazer with a brown bowtie that defined the look of a 1970’s TV show gamemaster responded to the answers of questions that were on everyone’s bingo card, the evening unfolded with the dramatic tale, as Mr. Oracle shouted “Madame’s and Monsieur’s Under the B it’s Number 15, to which a local community game member Jerry responded to with saying the lord’s prayer underneath his breath for couple of minutes hoping he had it on his bingo card.

The tension continued to fill the room as Oracle called out the number 22, the little ducks, as he flapped his arms around as if he was the daddy duck. Another resident Rosie was seen in almost complete tears as she failed to have a single answer on her card so far to which she eventually after a bit more motivation from Geraldine her sister continued to press on in hope.

The evening progressed even further with now Rosie picking up steam however her and Jerry were knock and knock down to the final three answers, with various glances being thrown at each across the room, Oracle knew this was either going to end with one of them dead or both ending up falling in love, in a dramatic turn off events as we came down to the last question, both Jerry and Rosie both shouted out bingo at the exact same time which caught Oracle by surprise and Oracle as the Judge of the evening had to figure out a way to settle the score, to which Oracle being a very clever fellow adopted the world class technique of flipism, where all decisions are determined by the flip of a coin, as oracle flipped the coin with heads at the top it miraculously ended up on tails to which Rosie has chosen on her side of the coin.",1,1732393909.0,cmhocpress,0,1.0,False

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about.",0,1732393592.0,Metaphysics,1,0.33,False

I recently went through the hassle of buying a new sofa, and I learned some valuable lessons about choosing the right size that I want to share with you all.

I made the rookie mistake of falling in love with this massive sectional without considering if it would actually fit in my living room. Trust me, you don't want to make the same mistake I did. So, here's what I've learned about making sure your couch isn't too big for your space.

First things first, measure everything! I mean everything. The room dimensions, doorways, hallways, and even your elevator if you live in an apartment building. I found this awesome sofa measuring guide at https://athometouch.com/sofa that really helped me out.

Here's my foolproof method to check if a couch will overwhelm your room:

1. Leave at least 18 inches of walking space around the sofa
2. Keep 30-36 inches between the couch and coffee table
3. Make sure there's at least 7 feet of space between your couch and TV
4. Consider the ""rule of thirds"" - your sofa should take up about 1/3 of your living room

Another cool trick I discovered is using painter's tape to outline the sofa dimensions on your floor. This gives you a real sense of how much space it'll take up and how it'll affect traffic flow.

Remember, your couch shouldn't block any natural pathways or make the room feel cramped. If you have to squeeze past furniture to move around, that's a red flag.

I also learned that the style of the sofa matters just as much as size. A bulky oversized design will feel much larger than a sleek, modern piece with the same dimensions. If you're looking for some great options that work well in different spaces, check out https://athometouch.com/sofa - they have a really helpful size guide for each piece.

Some other things to consider:
- The height of your ceilings (lower ceilings make furniture feel bigger)
- Window placement
- Other furniture pieces you need to fit
- How you actually use the room

Pro tip: Take photos of your space and bring them while shopping. It helps visualize how different pieces will look in your room.

Hope this helps someone avoid the headache I went through! Let me know if you have any questions - I've become somewhat of a furniture fitting expert through trial and error!",1,1732393439.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

Me (M24) So a little context my bestfriend (M23) did me bad we ended up on bad terms very messy and i was friends with his girlfriend(F22) too but they had broken up 3-4 months before they were together for 3 years i never had feelings for her while they were dating or even after they broke up we just used to talk in general and i never crossed my limits. 

they broke up bc she kissed another guy and he was seeing someone else too after post breakup i had cut my connections with her i guess after 8-9 months they broke up she reached out to me on instagram and we started talking and at this time the guy was nog in either of our lives she told me how fucked up their relationship was and they did end up on bad terms too this guy is a total asshole even when he was in relationship, and how post breakup he isolated her and used her just for sex and tried to broke off all the friends she had and i agree he used to go out with other girls while in relationship and he even crashed on few of my dates and tried to be friends with the girls i liked and text them i ignored as i knew he had a girlfriend and always thought it was harmless tho it did sometimes bother but i didn’t care much until other people started noticing and telling me about it as he told them that i would never get with these girls as they were probably interested in him just bc they were talking to him out of courtesy. He is very self obsessed and thinks the world revolves around him. 

so after chatting a bit with the girl we started hanging out going for coffee, hanging out at her place, mine or my friends smoking and drinking i don’t smoke or drink but she does and when she was in the relationship she had stopped smoking and drinking as “the guy” didn’t like that. We went on shopping, i used to pick her up and drop her too this went on for like 2 months and i didn’t realised it when i got attached to her and caught feelings for her. 

My friends said she was just using me and probably tried replacing me with her ex and she has a lot of guys hitting on her and she tells me about these guys and even used to show me the chats trying to make me feel insecure maybe? and used to call me her bestfriend in front of those guys and said i was her priority. We had a lot of trauma bonding, family drama, love life drama we related to a lot of stuff and i actually felt a bond. 

I couldn’t do this anymore and told her about how i felt and i want something more than friends she went silent and didn’t talk about it and i have no relationship experience before this its all been very casual and i don’t find every other girl attractive i entertain only few people and i have a very close circle i don’t like new people or even socialising. So even i don’t know how to process that and what to say and i left her place and we ghosted each other for a day and then she called me and said she can’t date her ex’s friend and she is still not probably over him, if the scenario were different it could’ve been something its not like she is out of my league or there is anything else i said we should probably make distance if we are not on the same page she said okay. She said her talking about other guys makes me insecure tho it bothers me but it dose not make me insecure but she still goes on talking about them so i don’t react much. She said it will take a while for me to move on and we should not meet maybe just talk on instagram. She is not from here and lives all alone and will be visiting back to her hometown for new years so i said lets meet after you come back. 

But i really can’t stop thinking about her and what we could be what should i do? she is still confused about whats happening and doesn’t know how to process and so do i. 
do i chase her or just move on with life? i asked her if she wants me in her life she said yes. 

ik this is a lot but i can’t help it sorry. pls don’t judge i genuinely need some advice and not bad trip.

1gy8qjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1gy8qjc/pepsin_test_results/,Pepsin test results,"Hi

I recently did a Pepsin saliva test as I've been getting Lpr type symptoms for a while.  At first I assumed it was just allergies as I also get hayfever, but my symptoms  (phlegm in throat, post-nasal drip, sometimes globus sensation, very rarely heartburn and occasional difficulty swallowing) seemed to be getting worse in autumn, not better.  

I've also had quite a lot of stress recently, and they got much worse during that.  
When I took the test my symptoms were a bit better though still present.  

Pepsin results were all positive though on the lower end of the scale:

* **30 minutes after waking**: <25 ng/ml
* **After food**: 68 ng/ml
* **After food**: 89 ng/ml

The test guidelines provided were:

* Minimal = <25 to 74
* Low = 75 to 124
* Moderate = 125 to 199
* High = 200 to >500

I could have had mild reflux for a long time.  I'm going to try and reduce coffee as I drink quite a lot of that, I only drink alcohol 1 night a week, I do eat spicy food sometimes so that probably won't help.

Would Gaviscon Advance (Uk version) help or are my results too low, as I was struggling to interpret them and I don't want to take a long term med if it might not help or do more harm than good.

I for one have very little following on both X and LinkedIn. Haven't been too active on either.

I'd love to change that, so I built a very simple tool where people can list themselves if they're willing to connect with other people in their already existing social circles.

This all started with me having one cup of coffee this morning. That one cup was one too many. Put me into an overdrive. That overdrive combined with the stack I posted about earlier led to this MVP: [https://circle.directory](https://circle.directory)

Not sure if any of you find it useful, but if you do I'd love to get some feedback on it.

I don’t know anything about addiction.

I feel like you’re incredibly strong for staying sober.  

And for times that you slip up,that’s okay.

I hope you have someone to talk to.

Be gentle with yourself.

I am proud of you.

","Hey everyone, I'm a 19-year-old navigating this chaotic world. Life has been a rollercoaster of ups and downs, and I'm eager to connect with someone who understands the journey. My friends are amazing, but I'm searching for a new kindred spirit to share this adventure with.

Lately, I've been reflecting on my goals and aspirations. I've dated casually, but it's never felt truly fulfilling. Watching my friends find their partners makes me hopeful yet a bit nervous about finding that special someone who truly understands me. I'm passionate about writing, exploring new coffee shops, and have a love for spontaneous road trips. It would be incredible to meet someone who shares these interests or introduces me to new ones.

Has anyone else felt the weight of these thoughts? How did you overcome the fear of opening up to someone new? I'm looking for someone who I can connect with on a deeper level, someone who makes me feel valued and understood. Is that too much to hope for? Let's chat and see where our conversation takes us.
