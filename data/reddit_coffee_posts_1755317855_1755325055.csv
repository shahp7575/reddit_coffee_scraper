1mrmre8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UAE/comments/1mrmre8/real_talk_on_dating_in_uae/,Real Talk on Dating in UAE,"Alright, if you're single and trying to date in the UAE, you know it's a whole different game. The place is amazing, but it's not like back home. I've been there many times, and after a lot of trial and error, I've figured out what actually works. It's not about being smart and respectful with your approach.

Where to Actually Go

Look, forget the idea that you have to go to every party or hit every club to meet someone. That's a waste of time and energy. The best way to meet people who are worth your time is to go where they're already doing something they love.

 ‚úì Hobby-Based Spots: This is my go-to. Think beyond the usual gym. Join a running group, a specific fitness class, or a social sports league. You‚Äôre meeting people who are already active and have shared interests. It‚Äôs an instant conversation starter.

 ‚úì Chill Coffee Shops: Skip the loud bars. Find a coffee shop with a good vibe. It's easy to just relax, and you can chat with people without all the noise.

 ‚úì The Right Brunches: Not all brunches are the same. Avoid the crazy, boozy ones. Go for the more relaxed, daytime brunches at a nice beach club or restaurant. The vibe is way better for having a real conversation.

How to Say Hello

You don't need some sophisticated lines. That stuff doesn't work here. The key is to be a normal, friendly guy and make the other person feel comfortable.

 * Use the Environment: This is the easiest way to start.

 If you‚Äôre in a sports club, just ask, ""Hey, how long have you been playing?"" or if you're at a coffee shop, ""Mind if I sit here?"" The shared setting gives you a natural opener.

 * Just Notice Things: Don't just walk up and interrupt. Notice a detail. Are they reading a specific book? Wearing a cool shirt? ""Hey, that looks like a great book‚Äîis it any good?"" or ""I like your shirt, are you a fan of that band?""

 * Keep It Light: The goal isn't to get a number right away. Just have a short, pleasant chat. If the conversation flows and you get a good vibe, you can suggest, ""It was nice chatting. If you're free for coffee sometime, let me know,"" and then give them your number. It‚Äôs a confident move l.

It all boils down to this: dating in the UAE is about being smart and respectful. You‚Äôll save yourself a lot of time and energy by focusing on quality interactions in the right places, and you'll end up meeting people who are actually looking for something real.

Got me thinking about how we form first impressoins so quickly. Like, all it took was one look, and they seeemd to have judged him based on his clothes and maybe even his posture. It‚Äôs kinda fascinaitng and also a little harsh, tbh. 

From what I've heard, it's a psychological thing where our brrains wanna make snap judgments 'cause they think it helps us figure people out quicker. But I wonder if they missed out on getting to know someone genuinely cool 'cause of those fast assumptions. I just think maybe it's worth taking a few extra seconds to actually talk to a person before decjding who they are. 

Does anyone else notice this happening a lot? Maybe it‚Äôs a survival thing, but I wonder if we're more wired for judging a book by its coover than we think.",4,1755324869.0,SocialDynamics101,0,1.0,False
1mrmqah,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mrmqah/what_am_i_doing_wrong/,What am I doing wrong?,"Hi reddit, I just want to gather some perspectives on the loop like situation that I very strongly feel that I'm stuck in.

In late 2022 I entered into a relationship with a friend and it lasted around 5 months. She ended it. That left me heartbroken. Anyhow, pulled myself from that pit and when life was getting normal again, entered a batchmate from college. She Initiated conversations, calls etc. We both knew that we liked each other but one fated day I told her something about her friend circle (which was true) and the next day her whole friend circle confronted me and she seemed as if she was neutral but tilted towards them. I stopped talking to her and she reciprocated it. Fine.

In mid 2024, I got into fashion and skin care which when added to my height 6'2, gave me a glowup. Then, one fine day, the popular girl in my batch, sat beside me and initiated a conversation. My hopes were kindled. I went on to emotionally drain myself with every micro actions of her. I could see her friends teasing her by my name and stuff like that. One day we even went out (very casually) but nothing could come out of it. Fine again. College ended. I moved on.

Last month enrolled myself in a coaching. I had improved my dressing style even more and that skincare routine started manifesting itself more prominently. I begin getting 3√ó times more attention. On an odd day, while leaving the class I caught a girl checking me out. I brushed it off. Another, random day we both shared a coincidental eye contact. I decided to sit in her vicinity and try striking a conversation. I did and it went good. Next day she seemed cold but I sensed, she was still checking on me. After the class, I did THAT (first time). I asked her for a coffee and she told me a personal pre occupation with something. It wasn't a no or yes. She came back to the class but I have stopped sitting in her vicinity and hence no interaction whatsoever. In all this time I am getting attention from others in the batch. My issue? I feel that since my breakup, I am stuck in a loop where even though I am getting a fair share of opposite gender attraction but no tangible outcomes or manifestations are coming out of the same. I come from a relatively close culture where guys and gals interacting is a rarity rather than a normal thing but dating life does exists.

My query: Is it because of that breakup or something wrong in my behaviour or it's natural?

TL:DR: Since my breakup in early 2023. I am getting fair amount of opposite gender attraction but nothing meaningful is coming out of it. Whenever I approach someone things usually gets messed up. Confused and anxious regarding the same.",1,1755324867.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1mrmpm4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mrmpm4,Lunchbreak with Michael üßãüçΩÔ∏èüíï,"If you're looking for a charming, slightly off-the-beaten-path neighborhood in Vienna, you'll love the Servitenviertel. It's located in the 9th district, also known as Alsergrund, and it's often called Vienna's 'Little Paris' for its beautiful old buildings, quiet cobblestone streets, and relaxed, sophisticated vibe.
The neighborhood is named after the Servite Order, a Catholic religious order that established a monastery and the Servite Church here in the 17th century. The church itself is a beautiful example of early Baroque architecture and is definitely worth a visit.
The Servitenviertel is known for its high quality of life. It's a very residential area with a strong local community feel. You'll find a lot of small, independent shops, bakeries, cafes, and restaurants. It's the perfect place to grab a coffee and a pastry at a traditional Viennese caf√©, or to enjoy a nice dinner at one of the many excellent restaurants.
One of the highlights of the area is the lively Servitengasse, the main street of the neighborhood. It's lined with trees and has a number of great places to eat and drink. The whole area feels very green and tranquil, with many small parks and hidden courtyards.
The Servitenviertel is a fantastic place to experience a more authentic, local side of Vienna, away from the main tourist crowds. It's a great spot for a leisurely stroll, to enjoy the beautiful architecture, and to soak in the relaxed atmosphere. While it's quiet and peaceful, it's still very centrally located and well-connected to the rest of the city, so it's a perfect base for exploring Vienna.

‚Äç

I wanted to take a quick moment to talk about *Pick of the Day*. As you *probably* noticed, I didn‚Äôt send one out today. Truth is, MLB has been especially volatile lately, and rather than force a play I didn‚Äôt feel confident in, I decided to hold back.

‚Äç

That said, I‚Äôll be honest ‚Äî it felt *strange* not sending one out. *Pick of the Day* has been part of my daily ritual for almost two years now. It‚Äôs something I genuinely enjoy sharing, and even with the occasional slump/cold streak, it‚Äôs a feature that always finds its footing over time. More than that, it‚Äôs the thing that brings our whole community together ‚Äî from the free tier to the paid tiers ‚Äî every single day. üëäüèΩ

‚Äç

**The bigger picture is important:** over the course of the year, POTD consistently finishes profitable. That‚Äôs the reason I stick with it, and I'm sure the reason why so many of you ride it with me through both hot streaks and cold spells.

‚Äç

We‚Äôll be back to our regular rhythm tomorrow ‚Äî I just wanted to be transparent about why there wasn‚Äôt a ""Pick of the Day""¬†today. Thanks for sticking with me, for trusting the process, and for being part of this community. üòå

I thought I was just huntng for a change of scenery, but it turned into so much more than just a new address.

I knew I was itching to break free from the same ol' routine, but I didn't realize how comfotable I'd gotten. That feeling of knowing where everything is, having my favorite coffee shop around the corner... it was hard to leave behind, tbh. When I first landed here, I was legit scared. I kept finding myself standing in the middle of my new apartment, wondering if I made the right decisiion.

There's this pattern I noticced‚ÄîI tend to fcus on external factors to avoid dealing with the internal stff. Moving forced me to confront a lot of that. All the uncertainty had me questioning my choices and my self-confidence took a hit. I guess I was expecting to suddenly become this adventurous spirit just by changing locations. 

But as weeks went by, I started getting more comfy with the discomfort. Weirdly enough, even the awkwward moments of not knowing wnere the hell I'm going in this metro became kinda exciting. I realized I need to allow myself to not have everything figuerd out. It's both terrifying and liberating.

So, yeah, leaving my comfort zone didn't exactly solve all my issues. But it definitely opened doors to patrs of me I hadn't exploed.

1. Mahdi Zaghi

What a bitter cold! Even with my overcoat thrown over my legs, it's useless. What a terrible draft in the alley! ‚Äî But it's not colder than last night. Was it from the broken window or the cracks in the door that the cold seeped in? ‚Äî The smell of the kerosene heater was worse. ""I'm chilled to the bone,"" Abbas grumbled. ""Junk!"" The windowpane scattered the words. No, I have no worries! To hell with it, I left it all behind: the smoky room, Asghar's bluster, the blackness that sticks to your chubby hands, backstabbing, the kids' chatter and teasing, the cold bed ‚Äî wherever I go, these things follow me. I haven't lost a thing. Not even the ""Haghdoost"" kebab place.

Why can't I sleep? Maybe it's because the moonlight is on my face. I shouldn't just toss and turn. ‚Äî I'm getting angry. I have to forget everything, even myself, so I can sleep. But before I forget, what am I? When I've forgotten everything, what am I not? I don't really know who this ""me"" is, this damn ""me."" I don't know‚Ä¶ all of it‚Ä¶ all of it‚Ä¶ Last night, as soon as I put my head on the pillow, I didn't know anything else. I forgot everything. Maybe it's because tomorrow I'm going to Isfahan. But it's not my first time traveling. Huh, whenever we wanted to go to Evin and Darakeh with the guys, I'd get insomnia at night. But this time isn't for a simple trip; it's not temporary. I don't know if I'm excited or scared. What am I anxious about? What am I leaving behind? Why can't I settle down in one place? Reza Saroughi, who I used to work with, is now a typesetter, he's doing great. I'm always without a purpose, up to my neck in debt, and whenever I have a job, I spend my wages in advance.

Now I get it, this cold isn't from the air, it's from somewhere else ‚Äî it's inside me. Whatever happens, happens, but this cold always comes. With a bent back, I have to drag the weight of this body. I have to go to the end of the road. Why should I? What for? To deliver my burden to its destination, and what a destination! I have strong arms. Warm blood circulates in my veins and skin. This warmth reaches my fingertips. I'm alive. The life I live here I can live on the other side of the world. In another city. How big and spectacular the world must be! Now that it's all chaos, with all the news in the papers, it can't be all that great. War is just a game for them ‚Äî like football.

Water that sits in a puddle goes bad.

What if I go to Saveh? And become a parasite on them? Never... I don't miss the sight of my father and stepmother. And they're not eager to see me either. I don't know how many more brothers and sisters they've made for me by now. I get sick to my stomach; not because he brought a co-wife for my mother. She always has snot dripping down her mustache, she gives the evil eye. Why is she always like a child, with sweets in her pocket, eating them in secret and not offering any to anyone? I don't look like my father ‚Äî with his mud-caked house, crooked shelves, low vaulted ceiling, the hubbub of kids, cows, sheep, chickens, and roosters all living together! And then with what pride he puts his hand on his hip and beats his peasants! From morning to night, he curses and finds fault. The bread that comes from there is poison. It's not bread. That place isn't for me, no place is for me. My father has his roots there. He's taken root, it belongs to him. Right, it belongs to him ‚Äî belongings are very important! He's living, he has memories. But nothing can be mine, memories aren't mine either. Memories belong to those who have land and attachments, whose lives had substance ‚Äî they enjoy making love in the moonlight, a spring rain. They remember their childhood. But the moonlight hurts my eyes and gives me insomnia. Memories also slip off my shoulders and fall to the ground, all alone. All the better! My father has a lot of these memories. But I don't want to remember my childhood at all. Last year, when I was sick and in debt, why didn't he answer my letter? I shouldn't think about it.

His eyelashes, like black-eyed peas, glinted under his thick eyebrows. After six years of work, my hands are still empty. It's a new day, a new beginning! It's my own fault. I worked with my cousin for four years, but for the two years he's been in Isfahan, I haven't heard from him. He's a serious, clever guy. Maybe I'm going to find him now. Who knows? Maybe I'm going on his account. If it's for work, then why don't I go to another city? I think about places where I can find a foothold and familiar faces. The strength of my arms! What a tasteless joke! But now I've made up my mind.

In short, if there are special places in the world for fun and enjoyment, there's also misery and wretchedness everywhere. That special place is for special people. Last year, when I worked as a waiter at ""Giti Cafe"" for a few days, it had plump customers who spent money they hadn't earned. Cars, parks, beautiful women, great liquor, a comfortable bed, a warm room, good memories, they've been handpicked for them, they belong to them, and wherever they go, they stick to them. Even the next world belongs to them. Because you need money to do good deeds too! If we don't work for a day, we have to go to bed hungry. If they don't have fun for one night, they'll turn the world upside down!

That night in the corner of the cafe hallway, that drunk American soldier, with sweat dripping from his bloody face, how he slammed that woman's head, the one in the navy blue dress, against the wall! Everything went black for me. I couldn't control myself. The woman was like she'd fallen into the clutches of the Angel of Death. What a scream and a racket she was making! No one dared to step forward or intervene, not even the policeman at the door, who was watching with indifference. I went to free the woman, and I don't know what they hit me with. Sparks flew from my eyes. When I opened my eyes, I was asleep in the police station. The place where they kicked me in the groin still hurts. I slept in prison for three months. No one came and asked, ""How much are you, Abuli?"" (A slang phrase meaning 'how are you doing?'). I have some good memories of my own!

What's this that's digging into my shoulder? Oh, it's a brass knuckle. Why was I clenching this in my hand all the way here tonight? It's like someone was following me. I thought I was wrestling with someone. Why did I put it under my pillow now? Who is going to come and strip me naked? My bed has gotten warmer, but why can't I sleep? The night of Rostam Khani's wedding, I drank coffee and couldn't sleep. But tonight, I drank two cups of tea, like always. I went a roundabout way for no reason. Damn that Haghdoost kebab place, he always overcharges.

I went there hoping it was the guys' hangout, maybe if I'd had a glass or two of liquor, I would have slept better. Gholam didn't come tonight. I said goodbye to all the guys. But they didn't know I wasn't going to work on Saturday. I wanted to tell Gholam just that. This morning, what a sharp look he had, and his profile was pale! He stood in front of the platen press as if he was on a sneak attack. I didn't think he loved his job that much. He's a simple kid: he knows he exists because he doesn't exactly know if he exists or not. He can't forget anything to fall asleep. It never occurs to Gholam to quit his job or gamble. He rocks on his feet like a machine and sets the type. What a habit he has, either talking nonsense or reading the news out loud! It distracts a person. The green stubble on his upper lip makes his face look serious. But his voice is captivating. How he drags out the end of every word! As soon as he drinks a glass of liquor, he can't stop his chin from flapping! He says whatever comes to his mouth. For example, what do I care that his aunt's wife had a miscarriage? But no one believes what he says ‚Äî everyone knows he's putting on a show. No matter how much he bothered me, he couldn't get me to talk. I don't have a habit of confiding in people. When he turns back, he says, ""The guys' veins are getting dislocated,"" and it gets on his nerves. What a nose he has! With that nose, he can spoil the air in the room for five people. But his lips are always open, and he breathes through his mouth. I don't like Yousef Eshtehardi: he's a despicable backstabber. Eshtehard must be a place like Saveh and Zarand. A little bigger or smaller, but with mud houses and malaria-ridden people. My ear says, ""Abbas has gonorrhea."" (This is a play on the phrase ""my heart says"" but with a different body part, showing a raw and unfiltered thought). The silk shirt he passed off to me, he really took advantage of me! I don't know if his eyes are red from work or if they hurt. So why doesn't he wear glasses?

Abbas and Farrokh are like two peas in a pod. At night, they practice the violin. Maybe they've dragged Gholam into their games, too. Oh, I forgot, they took Gholam into their union. That's why he didn't come to Haghdoost Kebab tonight. The day before yesterday, when Abbas was talking to me about the union, Gholam elbowed him in the butt and said, ""Forget it, his head is made of plaster."" It's better that Abbas with his boar-like teeth doesn't talk. Whatever he tells me, I'll do the opposite. With those boar teeth and his crooked eye, he can't drag me into their games. If he's a real man, he should go and cure his gonorrhea. He joined the party so they wouldn't notice his face. Gholam was right that I don't really understand what they mean. Maybe this is a kind of pastime. But why did Asghar's left eye get stuck on me from the first day? He finds fault for no reason. Maybe Yousef has been a snitch. I don't remember saying anything behind his back. I've seen so many printing houses, but none of them were this chaotic and noisy ‚Äî they don't know how to run it. A person's wages get trampled. Gholam said Asghar has a share in this printing house. Maybe that's why he acts so important. But he told me something strange about Massibi: It was the union's celebration day, and they wanted to take Massibi with them. He turned back as he was setting the type and said, ""Damn this life! Who's going to feed the kids then?"" What a serious, funny life! He's killing himself and working like a donkey for his kids' stomachs! Whatever it is, I'm a good-for-nothing and I have no ties. I can't understand it. Maybe they have some kind of fun or pleasure, too, and then they want to make themselves look miserable. But I don't share in other people's pleasures, I'm separate from them. I need to get some fresh air. Six years is no joke, I'm tired. I have to forget all this nonsense and go. I need to get some fresh air.

I recognized all my friends and acquaintances in a muddled dream. It's like a person walking for long hours in a dry, barren desert, hoping that someone is following them. But as soon as they turn to take their hand, they see that there was no one there. ‚Äî Then they slip and fall into a pit they hadn't seen before. ‚Äî Life is a long, frozen corridor. You have to clench the brass knuckle in your hand as a precaution ‚Äî in case you run into a bad person. I only found one real friend, and that was Houshang. When we were together, we didn't need to talk. We understood each other's pain. Now he's sleeping in a sanatorium for consumptives. He used to work next to me at ""Danesh Spring"" printing press. All of a sudden, he fainted and fell to the ground. The idiot had been fasting. He got sick to his stomach. Then he started spitting up blood, that's where it all started. How much money he spent on medicine and treatment, how much unemployment he endured, and with how much running around he finally got admitted to the sanatorium! His mother got that money for Houshang to kill two birds with one stone: both a good deed and a food saving. The customers of ""Giti Cafe"" created this life for us. So that we would spit up blood and they would dance and have fun! Each one of them, in one night, bets and loses as much as my next seven generations' expenses... Asadollah's sister used to say, ""If we go to collect horse dung, the ass will dump it in the water.""

For six years, I've been hopping from one hole to another in stuffy rooms amidst noise and shouting. It was as if the ground would stick to the sky if I was late! Now my hands are empty. Maybe this is better. Last year when I was in prison, no one asked, ""How much are you, Abuli?"" My bed is warmer... It's like the air has broken... The sound of a clock bell comes from far away. It must be late... Early tomorrow morning... The garage... I don't have a watch... What garage did he say?... Tomorrow I have to... Tomorrow.

2. Gholam

My mouth is dry. There's no water here. I have to get up, light a match, and find the clay pot in the hallway ‚Äî if the pot has any water. No, it's not worth the rent, I'll just get more restless. But cold water after liquor tastes good! What if I have a cigarette? To hell with it, I couldn't sleep. All I worry about is my own sleep... No, he was killed. My undershirt is soaked with sweat. It's stuck to my body. It was Shokoofeh, Qodsi's daughter, who was crying. I was upset tonight, I drank a lot. My head is still spinning, my temples are throbbing. It's like they poured lead into my neck. Dizzy and numb. This way is better. What a short sheet! This is a shroud... I'm a worm... Now I'm under the soil... The creatures have come for me... Again, Shokoofeh's screams filled the air! The poor girl must have something wrong with her... I forgot to get her some sweets.

What a shame! He was a good kid. His blue eyes were always smiling. He was a pure kid! What a thing to happen! Poor guy. Poor guy. Poor guy. I have to take a deep breath to stop my tears. It's like my heart is empty, I've lost something. I hear a rooster. It's way past midnight. It's better that I woke up from my sleep. This wasn't a dream. I was dreaming that I was awake, but I wasn't seeing anything, I wasn't feeling anything, and I couldn't know who I was. I'd forgotten my own name. I didn't know if I was thinking that I was awake or not. But something had happened. I knew it had happened. Maybe the wind was blowing, hitting my face. No, now I remember. There was a big tombstone. Who was praying there? His back was to me. I had put my finger on the stone. My finger sank into the stone. I felt it sink in. All of a sudden it burned, it caught fire. I woke up from the dream. The tip of my finger is still throbbing. I'm afraid it'll get me into trouble. I went to peel a cucumber, and the tip of the knife went into my finger. When Seyyed Kazem's hand got infected, he got in a bad way. If my hand gets infected, I'll be out of a job...

It feels like I'm worried. I wish I could find someone to talk to. The night it got late, I didn't have a pass to stay out, so I slept in the typesetting room under the platen press. I was much more comfortable. I had someone to talk to. It looks like it's getting light. Is that the top of the pine tree in the neighbor's yard moving? I thought it was a person. So, the wind is blowing. The mosquitoes tore my hands and feet to pieces. I got furious. The night before last, what a commotion there was in our neighbor's house! They had lit so many lights in their garden that our house was lit up too. Haji Golmohammad Ayoubi held a three-night celebration for his son's wedding. What a dignified face he has! He's kind! What a warm greeting you get from him! With all that wealth, he hasn't lost his head yet. But why is his hat always too small for his head? Qodsi said it cost him twenty-five thousand tomans a night. That too, in these expensive times! But how foul-mouthed Yousef is! He said, ""I know the groom. He's one of those shameless thieves! People are dying of hunger, and he's showing off his money! These people haven't worked as much as we have in a single day."" Why should he say that? Well, his son is young, he has hopes. It was their fate! God wanted them to be rich, what's it to anyone? But Qodsi said the bride was black and ugly. She said she looked like what? Oh yeah, ""she looks like a dough doll."" It seems they had put too much makeup on her. But Zaghi died a failure. Poor guy, his parents? Will they find out? The poor things will read it in the paper tomorrow. Maybe his parents are dead. I'll get to the bottom of this... What a secretive person he was! A mother who loses a child will never forget it... Khojasteh's child died of smallpox, and for years she still weeps and wails when she hears a eulogy! Everyone has their own fate... But not to be killed like this.

God! What did it say? Abbas was setting the news and read it with a flourish. Abbas knew Zaghi too. But it was from a party point of view, not for Zaghi's sake. When he read it, he said, ""The magnificent funeral procession of three combatants,"" no, he said, ""The magnificent funeral procession of three freedom-loving workers."" Tomorrow morning I'll buy the paper and read it. ""Mahdi Rezvani known as Zaghi"" was written at the beginning of the names. These were workers at ""Zayandeh Roud"" printing press. It can't be anyone else. Does that mean it was a printing error? An error this big? Worse errors are possible. He was alive. But if the news was handwritten, it can't be a printing error. Maybe the telegrapher made a mistake? The others must have been young too. Well, they went on strike together, long live!... The government people fired at them from their hearts. The bullet doesn't lose its way. They were the leaders, they were in the front row. The government people knew who to shoot. It's not for nothing that they're holding a ""magnificent funeral procession"" for them.

It was four or five months ago that he worked with us. But it feels like it was yesterday. His look was on my face. His nose was short and his lips were thick. All in all, he wasn't handsome, but he had a captivating face. You didn't mind being his friend and talking for a couple of minutes. When he entered the room, he brought a kind of warmth with him. He never called the apprentice. He always put the forms in the chase himself and took them to the machine room. At that time, our room was small and stuffy. The heavy, muffled sound of the letters came as they were being set in the chase or distributed in the platen press. When Zaghi whistled through his teeth, the fatigue would leave a person's body. I'd remember the movies. It's a shame Zaghi isn't here to see that our room is now big and respectable! Maybe if we had this room back then, he would have stayed with us and not gone to Isfahan for no reason. No, he didn't turn away from work, but he didn't put his heart into the work either ‚Äî it was like he was working for his own amusement. He was always humble and content, he never complained about anyone. He was a warm-blooded, lively person. The way he whistled through his teeth, it was one of those tunes they play in the movies. He was always either at the movies or had his head in a book. And he never got tired. I only like the movies with Jeanette MacDonald and Dorothy Lamour. Laurel and Hardy aren't bad either, well, you laugh.

Asghar Agha had a falling out with him over this untimely whistling and used to bother him. I don't know why people are so selfish. As soon as they get ahead, they lose themselves! Before he became a typesetter, he was our room's proofreader, in Massibi's place. We used to talk and laugh, but all of a sudden he started acting important! It's not for nothing that Farrokh named him ""people tormentor"" ‚Äî after all, friendship doesn't lie. That day, I stood up to Asghar Agha. It was for Zaghi's sake that I lashed out at him. Thank God Zaghi wasn't there. He had gone to buy a cigarette, otherwise, they would have gotten into a fight. I don't like fighting and that kind of thing. That short, deformed writer who changes the samples fifty times, he took advantage of him. He went and snitched that the news in his book was being set with a lot of mistakes. He's one of those who if there's no mistake, he'll invent one ‚Äî I'm thinking why did Zaghi agree? He belonged in our room, he shouldn't have agreed to typeset books. Because Hossein Gabi had gotten out of it. In any case, it gave Asghar Agha an excuse. He came and started talking badly. If Zaghi had been there, they would have gone at it ‚Äî Zaghi was a tough guy, he wouldn't have backed down from Asghar Agha. Thank God no one snitched on Zaghi for his sake. Well, they were both our friends.

Zaghi was a whimsical, fickle person anyway. He'd get sick of work quickly. Did he go to a printing house in Isfahan again? But he didn't care about the party or that kind of thing. How was he killed in the workers' strike? That day during lunch, he and Abbas had a talk. Zaghi said, ""Get your horns out of our way, I don't want to be a target ‚Äî I only have one stomach."" Abbas replied, ""It's this kind of talk that has set our work back. Until we are united, our situation will be the same. The right path is one, it can't be a thousand. So are workers everywhere in the world more stupid than you and me?"" Zaghi got up from his lunch, lit a cigarette. Then he said under his breath, ""You guys are all talk, no action!"" How did his opinion change? He was a passionate person. Maybe he suddenly had an idea. But Zaghi's only problem with the office was about his birth certificate. If he didn't have a certificate, then how did he go to Isfahan? Yousef used to talk nonsense, saying Zaghi sold American cigarettes and newspapers on Istanbul street. And then they say I'm putting on a show for no reason! I suggested, ""Guys! How about a memorial service... a mourning gathering for him? After all, he defended our rights, he sacrificed his life for us."" No one said a word. Only Yousef turned back and said, ""May he rest in peace! He was a dry person."" No one laughed. I was hurt by Yousef ‚Äî jokes have their time and place.

I'm annoyed that I didn't get along well with him. The poor guy got sullen. No, what was my fault? It was just that he might have had some thoughts himself. First, he told me, ""I'm selling my wristwatch for twenty tomans."" His watch was worth at least fifty tomans more. I said, ""You need it yourself."" He said, ""Then give me ten tomans, I'll give them back to you tomorrow."" I didn't have it, but I arranged it for him. That same night, he treated all of us at Haghdoost Kebab. It cost him fourteen tomans. The next day, when I came out of the machine room, a fat woman was standing by the fountain. She asked, ""Is Mahdi Rezvani here?"" I said, ""What do you want him for?"" She said, ""Tell him Houshang's mother has brought the rest of the watch money."" My attention was caught, and I asked, ""Did he sell his watch?"" She said, ""What a sweet young man! May God spare him for his family! Ever since my son became a consumptive and has been sleeping in Shahabad, he helps him every month."" I entered the room and looked; the watch wasn't on Zaghi's wrist. I told him, ""Houshang's mother wants to see you."" He came and went, and he gave me back my ten tomans. I asked, ""Who is Houshang?"" He sighed and said, ""Just my friend."" May he rest in peace! What a loyal friend he was!... I don't know what it is... But something is bothering me... I don't know what? I don't know if it's really painful or not... Can I or not?... I don't know. No, he shouldn't die. He shouldn't... he shouldn't... he shouldn't... I'm tired. But his friend shouldn't know that he's dead. On Friday, I'll go to Shahabad. I'll find Houshang's mother at the sanatorium. I'll make her understand. No, I have to help Houshang in a way that he doesn't find out. A consumptive person gets very sensitive and easily hurt. He must have gotten tuberculosis from the lead poisoning... He's Zaghi's friend. I have to help him. I'll get the money from under a rock if I have to... I'll work overtime... I don't know if I can cry or not... I don't know... Oh... oh... how bad this is! I have to hold back my tears. It's bad for a man... My face is wet... I have to take a deep breath.

This time it's not a mosquito. It's a bedbug. It's crawling on my back. It's wiggling. It went higher. This is a souvenir from Haghdoost Kebab that I brought with me. I scratched my back for nothing, it didn't get better. The damn thing changed its spot. Last night, the rice had gravel in it, and the eggplant stew wasn't cooked either. And then the tip of the knife went into my fingertip. Now that I'm thinking about it, it's worse. This Haghdoost has really counted our teeth! If Abbas hadn't come to my rescue, I would have been done for. I couldn't control myself, I was upset. As soon as he saw that I wasn't right, he took me with him. I didn't know anything else. Suddenly, I came to and saw that I was at Abbas's house. Tomorrow I'll be ashamed to look Abbas in the face... How dirty! I had thrown up all over the place... Oh, how bad!... Well, it wasn't your own straw, but the barn was yours! I kept saying, ""Cheers to the patrol."" I had lost control of myself. This time, I have to take care of myself. Abbas was a perfect host to me. My finger was bleeding, he took a gauze and wrapped it. Then he took me to my house. But he's a talented young man, he plays the violin so well! He wanted to play the violin for me, but I stopped him. ""No, no, our friend has been killed, put your violin away. Out of respect for him, you shouldn't play the violin for a while. Because we are mourning him too."" If he had played the violin, I would have cried.

This news shook all the guys. Even Ali the apprentice had tears in his eyes. He sniffled and left the room. It was only Massibi who didn't care at all. He was busy proofreading. The lamp had cast the shadow of his nose on the wall. I got furious. I told Massibi, ""After all, friendship doesn't lie. Zaghi worked with us for fifteen days. He got himself killed for our sake, he defended our rights."" He didn't react at all, he asked Yousef for a quadrat. I know what he was thinking. He must have been saying to himself, ""You guys talk from a place of comfort. If I stop working, then who's going to feed my kids? Damn this life!"" Damn this life! Tomorrow I have to change my clothes, they're all dirty and bloody from last night... Maybe Shokoofeh was crying for her kitten that suffocated under the bed... Why is the top of the pine tree still moving? So, a breeze is blowing... Today, Yousef's bicycle rack got caught on the tree and broke. Yousef had a cold sore on his lips. Quadrat... Yesterday I drank seven bottles of lemonade, and I was still thirsty! ""What a bad omen."" Does that mean they'll deny the news in the paper tomorrow?

""Cross-eyed Abbas."" Good. I'll wear my black shirt. Why don't they call Abbas who's cross-eyed? Quadrat... Qu-ad-rat... Qu-ad-rat ‚Äî tomorrow's newspaper... my black shirt ‚Äî tomorrow...

First of all, any broad generalizations, stereotypes, or assumptions made about any group of people never represents the whole as there are always exceptions. All people are unique and are the result of their background and life experiences which can involve race, culture, religion, education, how they were raised, abuse, and a whole long list of things that can result in who they become. There are good and bad people from every country, race, religion, and culture.

So take this post like a grain of salt. It is merely one perspective and opinion on a controversial topic.

Regardless of what we have experienced and where we are from, we all still have a choice - we can choose how we act, what we say, and what we value. So regardless of who you are, we still have freedom to choose who we want to be and we should take responsibility for our actions, not claim the victim hood mentality and take offense when flaws are pointed out.

As a white American woman, I write this not as some immaculate, perfect example of a wife and mother.. no.. I am flawed and I've made many mistakes in my life, but always seeking to learn and improve myself. 

Alright, with that said, let's begin.

---

Despite being from opposite sides of the world and coming from different cultures, there can be some surprising similarities and differences that are worth exploring.

So let's explore the top 5 things.

#1 Materialistic demands/requirements 

Houses, money, cars, brand name items, gifts, jewelry, wealth.. a lot of women focus on these things and feel they deserve it in a relationship. This goes for both Asian and Western women. Now that's certainly not the case with all women, but a number of women have materialistic expectations in a relationship. 

This seems to be more common in countries like China though, where women will have a lot of requirements just to even date them. Women in Thailand are not this way though, but they may have other requirements that focus more on attention and emotional needs. So it varies a lot.

In the West, there are gold diggers, girls who will only talk and pursue guys who are wealthy. Then there are those who don't care much or at all what a guy has. It varies widely. Women who are more progressive are more likely to have greater demands and expectations. Women who are Christian and/or conservative, may be less materialistic and prefer more traditional gender roles.

Regardless of race, women (30+ years old) who have built a career are more likely to seek out men who make more than they do and are more successful than them. But that's not the case for all. Many women may have a career and are comfortable being the ""breadwinner"" and serving the provider role in the relationship, challenging the traditional gender roles, which may make things feel awkward for some guys. 

The women who value love and emotional connection, regardless of what race or their location, will have far less value on material things. There are women like this in every race and culture.

While it varies widely, based on my personal observations and watching numerous videos from both male and female perspectives on expdctations from both Asian and Western women, I have concluded that the majority of Western and Asian women can be materialistic, with a focus on ""what's in it for me"" kind of attitude, rather than on what they are willing and want to contribute to the relationship. 

So are Asian or Western women better? Neither. The majority of people today are materialistic. 


#2 Kids and parenting

A lot of women in both Asia and the West are uncomfortable with the idea of child birth and some even fear it. Some women don't want to the changes it would make to their body, or to endure the pregnancy. Many do not want to go through the delivery, so are unwilling to have children. 

This is not the case of course for all women, but this seems to be a trend I'm noticing primarily in the younger generations. 

Many women are in the workforce and pursue careers, and having children would interrupt or interfere with career pursuits resulting in postponing having children until later in life.

The women 30+ years old seem more willing to have children, but doing so has a greater risk of complications, and it is more difficult to conceive.

Many women want to have children but aren't doing so because of the cost. This is one of the biggest complaints women have in Asia and the West. It simply costs too much, and many guys agree.

[A note to those who use cost as an excuse: I would like to point out that for thousands of years, humans have been having children in poverty and make it work - even though it's difficult, expensive, painful, etc. So what's changed? The change we see now has more to do with comfort, a reluctance to make sacrifices and accept a lower standard of living, and a focus on self pleasure. Our ancestors were much tougher, and they weren't spoiled with the modern conveniences like air conditioning, technology, internet, or appliances like we are today.]

So both Asian and Western women are trending towards being comfortable with a child-free life, the population is declining everywhere as a result (with the exception of Muslim families), and we are going to experience a population crisis.

As far as parenting goes, most women expect shared responsibilities. Many women work and aren't wanting to be stay at home moms, or can't afford to be, which puts a strain on women. So most modern women expect their partners to help with taking care of the children. 

So which is better - Asian or Western women? Neither. It varies too much and there are no clear differences between Asian and Western women on this issue.


#3 Housework and cooking

Modern women in both Asia and the West mostly now expect household chores and cooking to be shared responsibilities, or in some cases, the man's job. This is not the case for all women, but it is a increasingly more common expectation women have of men.

In China, for example, many women expect men to not only do the cooking and cleaning, but also work long hours to make money, then hand it over to them to spend, giving only the guy a small portion of it to use how he likes. In other Asian countries, women may not have such demands.

In the West, I know of a married white couple with a similar arrangement. Typically in the West, women will work, bills may be split, and responsibilities are shared and more equal.

So which is better? Well Western women, and the Asian women with a perspective that either fits with traditional gender roles, or expectations of shared responsibilities. No one should be expected to do everything like a slave. 


#4 Bride price, engagement, and weddings

In Asia, bride price is a thing. In most of the west, I don't think it is. I never heard about a ""bride price"" until recently. Such a thing can put a huge financial strain on guys, even if it's intended for financial stability or to save. 

In China, for example, most women require at least 200,000 yuan, just for the bride price. That doesn't include anything else like rings or the wedding. They also may require a house and car.

In other Asian countries, the bride price may be very cheap, as much as a cup of coffee. It varies. Some Asian women don't have a bride price, but I think the majority do. 

In the West, women are more focused on marrying for love and don't require any sort of bride price. But, many women may have requirements for an engagement ring and wedding band, and the cost of a wedding can be incredibly expensive, even absurd. 

So who's better? Possibly Western women because there may be fewer financial requirements, and less expensive and more reasonable demands.


#5 Commitment 

A lot of modern women are less committed to a relationship. That means there is a high chance of divorce. Both Asian and Western guys are worried about being taken advantage of. Courts in Western countries can tend to rule in favor of the mother.

When difficulties are experienced, women are more likely to give up on a relationship than to stick it out. That doesn't mean all women are like that, of course. So this is another area without a clear winner. 

Divorce rates tend to sit around 50% in much of the world.

Weekends slip by faster than they should. So how about we hit pause on doomscrolling, step out of our comfort zones (and pajamas), and do something refreshingly different?

Maybe we start with a visit to a museum or art gallery‚Äîwhere we pretend to ‚Äúget‚Äù abstract art while secretly rating the frame choices and color palettes like undercover critics. From there, we wander into one of Bangalore‚Äôs greener corners or stumble through a colorful market, just soaking in the chaos or calm, depending on the mood. When our feet (or attention spans) give out, we settle into a cozy caf√© for coffee, or maybe cool off with ice cream that feels way too indulgent for the weather. 

And if the conversation‚Äôs still flowing, who knows‚Äîmaybe a spontaneous detour to a bookshop rounds off the day just right.

1mrm7ms,https://www.reddit.com/r/introverts/comments/1mrm7ms/quit_parties_to_find_better_dates/,Quit Parties to Find Better Dates,"For years, I believed the lie that to find someone, I had to be everywhere at once. I spent countless weekends at crowded bars and loud parties, trying to ""play"".

I‚Äôd leave exhausted, my voice hoarse from shouting over music, with nothing but a few blurry memories and a stack of contacts I‚Äôd never use. It was a lot of activity with zero progress.

Here‚Äôs the thing about parties: they‚Äôre built for performance, not connection. Everyone is trying to be ""on."" The conversations are superficial, the distractions are constant, and it's almost impossible to get to know who someone really is. You‚Äôre meeting the social persona, not the person.

I finally realized that the best way to find a great date isn't by adding more people to your funnel. It's by finding people who are already doing what you love. It‚Äôs about putting yourself in environments that encourage authenticity instead of demanding a performance.

 * Instead of a club, try a coffee shop or a bookstore. The vibe is calm, people are often open to a quick chat, and you can see what they're genuinely interested in.

 * Skip the mixer and sign up for a class or a volunteer group. You're instantly surrounded by people who share a common interest. The conversation is effortless because it's built on a shared activity.

 * Forget the loud bar. Start a running club, a hiking group, or go to a trivia night. These activities have a built-in purpose, which takes all the pressure off and lets natural connections form.

You don‚Äôt have to drain your social battery just to meet someone. The moment I quit chasing parties and started pursuing my own interests in different settings, I started meeting people who actually had substance. We had something to talk about from the very first minute, and the dates that followed felt real, not transactional.

This drink is a definite pass. The yema latte is wonderfully balanced; the sweetness from the dulce de leche is not overwhelming and complements the coffee and milk perfectly. The parmesan crisp is a surprising but welcome addition, creating a delightful salty-sweet combination and a great textural contrast to the creamy drink.  
  
üî• Fish & Chips: Death Note (3/10)  
  
The fish & chips receive a death note, with the only saving grace being the fries. The fish was utterly disappointing. It was soggy and lacked a crispy batter, likely because it was fried while still too frozen. This released moisture, which prevented the batter from getting crispy. It was also fried a bit too long, probably to ensure the fish was cooked through, which resulted in an unpleasant, overdone flavor.",2,1755323108.0,PHFoodPorn,0,1.0,False

I'm not sure whether this person is an unhealthy ISFP or whether he is an ISFP at all in the first place, please let me know based on the description and whether you guys relate to it or not.

1. He is an Introvert, knows few people but generally he isolates himself from all his friends. Whenever we had a conversation, he often speaks poorly, insult, and anything negative regarding his friends and rarely would talk anything good regarding his experience with his friends, it's always that he is right and his friends are wrong.
2. He bottles up his negative emotions, hates to let it go and move on.
3. He tried multiple times to isolate me from my friends, even though I personally had no problem neither did they do anything wrong. In a very covert manner, trying to question my friends intentions, saying that ""he/she is just there to use you"" ""they are fake"" so that I would stop hanging out with them and stay with him indoors.
4. He is sometimes extremely caring and providing kind of a person, but here and there I used to feel it to be very artificial and not genuine, trying to please me to get me to do something cause it benefits them. (Details in next point)
5. Lazy but ambitious, there is no better way to describe him. I am ambitious but not lazy, I work really hard, and that leads to me ending up doing his work, things that he is supposed to do but is lazy to do. So, we end up in arguments here and there, and I think in order to make it up for that he will take me somewhere out, or make coffee or some snacks which doesn't need or require that much effort. (something that I started noticing recently). 
6. Insecure about himself, and tries to show confidence but generally very insecure about his achievements, work track record, looks, height.
7. Passive aggressive, he is not loud but someone close can sense that something is wrong, he blames me or someone else if something goes wrong and hates the accept or acknowledge his mistakes or faults.
8. Covert narcissist, this is when I started noticing patterns after learning about types of narcissism cause prior to that I used to believe there is only grandiose narcissism, I wouldn't necessarily claim he is a total covert narcissist but definitely has many traits.

Many of those things were extremely difficult for me to notice or read between the lines at the time, only recently I have been able to do so, so let me know whether you guys relate or I am just exaggerating.",2,1755322293.0,isfp,4,1.0,False

Ever wondered what it is like up here in the North?

Technically it is 'summer' so a steady -3C with slight breezes here and there. The ice creaks and groans every so often but at the moment it seems peaceful. 
The science hubs are busy, research is building but nothing we haven't seen before. I'm watching carefully so nothing is disturbed; because I am not having my peace disturbed once again. 

There isn't any signs of P though might need to look into the research budgets...they do like to throw money at things to cover up the shady shit. 

No leeches.... Yet.

Anyways as you can see, pretty much silent and peaceful but I need some gossip to get me through so as I sit here with my coffee.... What kinfolk is causing trouble? What chief isn't chiefing? Who wolfed out?

1mrlsxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mrlsxs/something_is_watching_me_while_i_sleep_im_not/,Something is watching me while I sleep. I'm not imagining it.,"Hi. I‚Äôm writing this because this site seems to be the only thing that‚Äôs still working for me. That, and I have no one in my real life to tell. I have nowhere to go, nowhere to escape. I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself, I‚Äôll try to start at the beginning, but my brain is so scattered that I may jump around a bit. I don‚Äôt know, I just need someone to know about what's happened to me.

I have insomnia and a behavioral disorder, so I take Quetiapine which kind of works as a sleeping pill and an antidepressant at the same time. It‚Äôs pretty convenient. It takes some time to start feeling tired, so I usually take it thirty minutes before bed. Recently, I‚Äôve been having some late nights where I put off eating or working out until the last minute, and taking my medication maybe five minutes before I‚Äôm in my bed trying to sleep. That's what happened two nights ago.

I was up late finishing a storyboard and chugging a cup-o-noodle when I realized it was nearly 2 AM and I hadn‚Äôt taken my medication yet. I don‚Äôt have a set sleep time, but I spent too much time in my youth sleeping until noon, and I‚Äôve been trying to change that. I quickly swallowed my pills, brushed my teeth, turned off my lights and hopped into bed. I laid there with my eyes shut for maybe ten restless minutes before I began to feel thirsty and opened my eyes to reach for my glass of water on my bedside table. That's when I saw it for the first time, or what I hope was the first time.¬†

My eyes slowly traced the dark, fuzzy gray outlines sticking out from the rest of my dark room. I recognized my chair, and my desk, the picture frames hanging on the wall above it, but there was something wrong. The shapes weren‚Äôt actually moving, but the more I stared the more I began to make out a blurry face. My big chair slowly morphed into a vague blob of blackness resembling a long clump of hair. My white desk stretched into sickly pale skin and the area under it became a wide, gaping mouth. The reflection in my picture frames flickered, forming expressionless, empty eyes. They bore into me. Once my brain translated my surroundings into that ghastly expression, I couldn‚Äôt unsee it. Its features were a shifting mound of darkness, unblinking, unrelenting. I don‚Äôt know how much time passed with my eyes glued open, but I soon felt the weak pull of the medication blurring my cognition. My eyelids fluttered and my vision unfocused, and I swear to God, the second my eyes opened again it was a few inches from my face. Its features were more defined at this distance. I could see its scaly skin flaking around the edge of a wide, black smile. The eyes were glazed over and wide, staring expectedly. The face was more defined, more visible. I was petrified. My heart was pounding against my chest and I choked on my own breath. I didn‚Äôt dare to look away, and it didn‚Äôt dare to move again.¬†

The next thing I remember is waking up, granted with a fleeting bliss in the form of a lapse of memory concerning the night before. Idly brushing my teeth I struggled to recall what I had been doing before falling asleep, and how much was left of the project I had to work on. It was then its face flashed into my mind. The grotesque features stained my internal projection. When I closed my eyes, it stared back. In that instance I was briefly overcome with fear before reason set in. I collected myself and realized what I had seen‚Äì what I thought I had seen‚Äì wasn‚Äôt real. The unnatural marriage of my room arrangement had formed something twisted in my imagination, and that‚Äôs all it was.

For some background: ever since I was a child I‚Äôve had an overactive imagination, it‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm an artist and animator now. This is going to sound sad, but I was a lonely kid and never really had any friends, so I relied on my imagination to keep me entertained; I made characters out of cars that had faces, created long winded dramas that unfolded with my various bath toys, and even had imaginary friends, though the details of them now are lost to me. Sometimes the hyperactivity of my young mind worked against me; I would frequently get scared by demonic faces in wooden doors, shadows looked like monsters, and I would always close the closet door before turning off the light and jumping to my bed when it was time to sleep.¬†

Now, as a more rational adult I don‚Äôt typically get scared by the tricks my brain plays on me. Of course, that's all last night had been: a trick. Even so, the image of it haunted my thoughts. At the very least, reminiscing on positive memories made me feel a little better. Most of my adolescence has been blocked out in my memory, and the parts I do remember aren‚Äôt exactly comforting. I tried to carry on with my day, washing dishes, taking out the trash and vacuuming. Anytime the face returned into my consciousness, I forced my thoughts back to my childhood wonder.¬†

As the day progressed I slipped farther into nostalgia, until I eventually thought all the way back to my last true friendship with a girl named Maxine.

When I was really young it was common for my parents to move around a lot for my father‚Äôs job. After I finished first grade we moved states and I started second grade in an unfamiliar place knowing no one. The first day of class I brought my new My Little Pony lunch box. I was so nervous other kids would make fun of me for it, but when Maxine noticed it she ran up to me, asking who my favorite pony was. After that day we were inseparable. We couldn‚Äôt hang out at either of our houses because my parents were always fighting and hers had just gone through a messy divorce. We made the best of our time together at school.¬†

By the end of that year my dad had to move for work again. I knew it was coming, but I couldn't bring myself to tell Maxine, instead putting it off to the last minute. When I went to school on my last day I was devastated to find her desk empty. In a panic, I wrote a note with my moms phone number on the back of one of my graded homework assignments and asked my teacher to give it to her the next day. She promised she would, and every day after the fact I pestered my mother, asking if Maxine had called. The answer was always ‚Äúno,‚Äù and eventually I stopped asking. Looking back on it now it was entirely possible she had called and my mom hadn‚Äôt picked it up because it was a random number. Years later as a teenager with unrestricted access to the internet, I would periodically look for Maxine. I signed up for every social media site there was to see if she had an account anywhere, but I never found a profile associated with her full name. I was never desperate enough to message each random ‚ÄúMaxine‚Äù (no last name or profile picture) to ask if they were the girl I knew, but I considered it.

As a child the loss of my best friend crushed me. I remember scribbling vague impersonations of her on every page of my sketchbook to cope. I drew her so often her visage morphed into her own being, someone to keep me company. She was my first imaginary friend, and I did everything with her. Though, ‚Äúeverything‚Äù usually just included drawing in my room.¬†

At recess, Maxine and I usually would play rock paper scissors, determining which of our school notebooks would be used to color for the day. When the loser was decided we would sit on either side of each other drawing on opposite pages of the open notebook. There was a subtle, unspoken rivalry between us to determine who the better artist was. (I like to think I won, but I can‚Äôt recall any of her drawings for comparison.)

Like I said before, I also drew with imaginary Maxine, but instead of sitting side by side I would take one page and push it halfway through the slit of my closed closet door. I would draw whatever I wanted and after some time take it out from under the door to view the whole picture.

It was at this point that I stopped absentmindedly daydreaming, a chill running up my spine. All fond nostalgic feelings I had immediately vanished as I replayed my memories over and over again, searching for something to make sense of them. I ran to my storage closet and frantically searched for any sketchbooks I had around that time. But back then I didn't have sketchbooks, just school notebooks (all of which were undoubtedly trashed.) I remembered my mother had a large jewelry box to keep the drawings I would leave around the house. I don‚Äôt know if she ever really looked at them, but I imagine even a shitty parent feels bad about throwing away something your child worked hard on. If those drawings were anywhere, they would be in that box back at my parents house.

Suddenly hallucinations were the last of my worries as I faced the reality of my situation; if I wanted answers I would have to contact my mom.¬†

I stewed it over in my mind for a good few hours. I weighed my options, but ultimately I knew ignoring it would bother me for years if not the rest of my life. With shaky hands, I moved to unblock the number on my phone. It had been a few years since I last had any contact with her. Luckily she wasn‚Äôt crazy enough to drive the fifty miles to my apartment, but I expected to get an earful if I called her. I settled for text messaging:

**Mom. Do you remember when I was a child and you collected my artwork in that box? I need those papers for a project I‚Äôm working on. Do you think I could have it, or at least have the drawings inside?**

Checking the time on my phone I cursed and shut it off; it was already 1 AM. I swallowed my pills, but hesitated before hopping into bed. I really didn‚Äôt want to see that face again, I had enough to worry about as it was. I left my closet door open with the light on inside and moved my work chair to the opposite side of the room as a precaution. Falling asleep was difficult with the light on, but eventually I passed out.

I woke up around 10 AM and got up to check my phone. As expected I got a reply, but the response itself was anything but normal. Instead of angry paragraphs berating and insulting me, I was surprised to see an image. It took a minute or two to comprehend what I was seeing, but after a bit of squinting I realized the picture must have been taken on my parents front porch. The picture itself was very dark, but I could make out the faint glow of moonlight glinting off the jewelry box on the ground. My confusion only intensified when I checked when the message had been sent: 4:38 AM. Unlike me, my mom never had sleeping problems. Needless to say the message was odd, but I knew what it meant. Within minutes I was turning the key in the ignition of my 2005 F150. As it rumbled to life I muttered a quick, half serious prayer that it wouldn‚Äôt break down on the trip there or back.¬†

The ride itself was uneventful. I spent some time cycling through the least worst radio channels available until I gave up and listened to the ramblings of an impassioned sports caster to stay awake. After an hour and a half I pulled into the familiar neighborhood and my anxiety spiked. I had driven all this way and I wasn‚Äôt about to turn back, despite every fiber in my body begging me to. To stay inconspicuous I parked a block down and walked to my parents porch. It hadn‚Äôt changed at all since I‚Äôd last seen it.¬†

As I got closer I noticed three things; one, both of my parents' cars were in the driveway on the side of the property. Two, the jewelry box was in the same position as it was in the photo, thank God. And three, all the lights in the house were off. I didn‚Äôt think too much of it at the time, seeing as it was midday and there were many windows to supply natural light inside, but every window shade was shut. Every step I took towards the house made me feel more and more anxious. I felt my hands shake by my sides and prayed that somehow neither of them left the house at that moment to see me.¬†

Once I was ten feet from the door I got the sickening feeling I was being watched. Slowly, my gaze shifted to the window left of the door. One of the flimsy plastic blinds had been slightly cracked open, just enough for someone to look out of. I couldn‚Äôt make out details as it was completely black on the other end, but I could sense eyes staring back at me, watching. My eyes widened and my blood ran cold. I stood frozen for a second, eyes locked onto an impossible darkness until my flight instinct finally kicked in. I swooped down to grab the box and made a mad dash down the block, not daring to look behind me. Once I was in my car I accelerated as fast as possible out of the neighborhood. It took me a good minute to realize garbled nonsense was still spouting from my car radio. I shut it off; I was wide awake.

My heart rate didn‚Äôt slow until halfway through the drive back, but even then my mind was racing. It was barely better when I returned to my apartment. I put the box on my kitchen counter and sunk into my sofa, chewing on cold pop-tarts as I cycled through channels on my TV. I needed to stay calm and keep a clear head to avoid spiraling. For all I knew, I was going fucking crazy and being insanely paranoid.¬†

Somehow in my panicked state I fell asleep. I genuinely don‚Äôt remember feeling tired or closing my eyes. I only remember opening them.¬†

Groggily, my eyes slowly recognized the harsh light of the TV static scrolling down my flatscreen, the gentle buzz breaking the silence in my apartment. I sat up instantly and looked around. It wasn‚Äôt even evening when I last looked outside, but now it was pitch black outside. I didn‚Äôt turn the lights on when I got home, so the rest of the apartment was dark except for the small switch light directly above my stovetop. I don‚Äôt remember turning that light on. The light illuminated the jewelry box only a foot or so away from the stovetop. Scared shitless, I sat and listened. I waited for any sign there was someone else inside. The TV illuminated my doorknob; it was still locked.

On shaky legs I quietly stood up from my sofa. I considered switching on the lights, but was horrified by the idea of making a sound and alerting whatever was in here with me that I was awake and in the kitchen. I cranked my phone‚Äôs flashlight setting to the max, holding it out in front of me like a cross. I walked cautiously towards the kitchen counter, terrified to even breath. I grabbed the box and quickly turned to catch any figures peering at me from the hallway or under the dining table. There was nothing. Reaching behind me, I grabbed a kitchen knife from my knife block and slowly stalked back towards the couch, still illuminated by the TV. It was difficult to juggle the box, knife, and phone but through sheer force, I managed not to drop any of them.¬†

I sat down on the cushions, box in my lap, knife in my hand, and phone flashlight angled towards the kitchen. I brushed the top of the box, sweeping layers of dust from its shiny surface. I found the small hatch and lifted the top of the box. I half expected something awful and monstrous to be inside but true to my memory, its contents were stacks and stacks of paper.¬†

My trembling hands began to sort through the drawings. The first were a lot of stick figures of me and Maxine, with very inaccurate colors. I didn‚Äôt have any tan or brown crayons, so younger me used a bright green to color our faces, yellow to color my brown hair and blue to color her black hair. We looked like strange aliens with large heads, and the thought made me smile. The further I went the less Maxine showed up. I found artwork of the neighbor's dogs, an angry beehive, a wand that made everyone wear princess dresses‚Ä¶ the list went on. I began to draw many admittedly sad cartoons of my small green face peering out of the house through blue colored windows, frowning.¬†

When I lifted the last of the house drawings from the stack my heart stopped. Underneath it was another drawing of me in the house, smiling this time holding hands with a figure. The figure was another stick figure, smiling. Or at least I think it was smiling. Unlike my crayon scribbles, the figure was drawn with a black ink like substance. In fact, that entire half of the page had been painted in various layers of ink, sinking into the paper leaving it crumpled and frozen with age. Its smile was seemingly painted over and over again until it was barely decipherable. When my eyes met the figure‚Äôs on the page, that sick feeling like I was being watched came over me once again. Trembling, I set down the page and turned my gaze to the kitchen, but I couldn't make anything out in the darkness. That just made me feel worse.¬†

I gripped the knife tighter, waiting for something to make a mad dash towards me, but nothing happened. A few minutes or maybe an hour passed of me frozen on that couch, surrounded by the warped memories of my childhood. I never dared to go any further into my apartment. While shrouded in darkness it felt completely foreign and hostile to me.¬†

I wasn‚Äôt going to endanger myself by falling asleep again. I regularly pinched myself to stay awake, tried to make out faces in the TV static, silently paced around my coffee table. Whatever was hiding in the shadows would have to make the first move if it wanted a fight.¬†

A few hours into my paranoid pacing I thought of something. I wasn‚Äôt close enough with any of my neighbors to ask them to help me, but my landlord, Bobby, checked on my place frequently. He was convinced I was hiding a cat somewhere in the house. I wasn‚Äôt, and I even told him I was deathly allergic to cats, but I never managed to convince him. I pulled up his contact and made up a lie about the lights in my apartment malfunctioning. Knowing his lack of a social life and nosy inclinations, I knew he‚Äôd stop by first thing in the morning. It may seem unfair of me to bring him into whatever shit may or may not have been happening, but the way I saw it was: one, there's a chance it may not want to do anything if there was another person present, and two, even if it did try anything, if I‚Äôm going down I‚Äôd prefer if he came with me. That‚Äôs the tradeoff for leaving my water filter broken for two months, that asshole.

I cleaned up the drawings still scattered around my table and couch, trying not to look too hard at any of them. In the end, I never cycled through all of them, I guess I was just too much of a coward. I sunk back into my couch and looked to the kitchen window, watching the clouds lighten outside.

I don‚Äôt remember what time it was when I finally heard a knock on the door. All I knew was it was morning and I needed to pee really bad. I shoved the knife in between the couch cushions then stood and opened the door. Working from home and prioritizing comfort over appearance always left me looking a little rough, but I must have looked especially bad to warrant the shock on his face. He quickly masked it and forced a smile.¬†

‚ÄúHey Sam. So, the lights are being weird?‚Äù

I went to talk but I suddenly realized how dehydrated I was. I rasped a few syllables before coughing and clearing my throat. ‚ÄúSorry. Yeah. It‚Äôs probably nothing, but I couldn‚Äôt get them to stay on for more than a few seconds. I figured you usually have the magic touch with these sorts of things, so‚Ä¶‚Äù

In comparison to all the other shit wrong with my living space, a few faulty lights seemed like nothing in comparison, certainly not something to call him about, but if he was annoyed he didn‚Äôt show it. Bobby‚Äôs eyes flicked over to the TV and he raised an eyebrow.

‚ÄúThat broken too?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOh, uh‚Ä¶‚Äù I completely forgot about the TV. I picked up the remote and tried to change channels. It worked, and I was greeted with a smiling television host instructing on how to preheat an oven. ‚ÄúNo, I guess not.‚Äù I turned down the volume, but wasn‚Äôt willing to turn it off. It had been with me the entire night and nothing bad had happened; I wasn‚Äôt going to risk shutting it off now.

Bobby shot me a strange look, but didn‚Äôt say anything. He walked around the kitchen before stopping to mess with the switch light above the oven.¬†

‚ÄúThis one works?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt actually just turned on randomly.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh.‚Äù He left it on (something I was silently grateful for) and started rifling through my cupboards absentmindedly. I waited until he was satisfied with his hunt for my imaginary cat to follow him down the hallway.¬†

Though more light had streamed into the kitchen, the rest of the apartment didn‚Äôt have any windows, save for a small one in the bathroom, so the rest of the apartment remained shrouded in darkness. He walked through the hallway, absentmindedly flipping on the lights to every room to no surprises. Everything was as I left it. He opened his mouth to ask something when I forcibly excused myself to go to the bathroom. When I walked out I saw him standing by my television, inspecting something. At this point my fears had largely dispelled and I was breathing easier. I grabbed a glass and poured myself some water from the faucet, chugging it immediately.¬†

From the living room I heard: ‚ÄúSam?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah, sorry about the lights. I guess it really was just a fluke.‚Äù I was already pouring myself another glass.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay. I actually had a question unrelated to that.‚Äù¬†

I chugged the second glass. ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you seeing anyone? I mean, do you have a girlfriend? Someone who‚Äôs over often? It‚Äôs fine if you do, you just never told me‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off awkwardly.

The question was so out of the blue it almost made me laugh. ‚ÄúWhat? Slow down. No, I don‚Äôt, why would you even- why?‚Äù

He turned to face me, dangling something from his fingers I couldn‚Äôt see from the distance I was at. I took a few steps closer and instantly my smile vanished. He was holding a long black strand of hair.

My heart stopped. ‚ÄúWhere did you find that.‚Äù My tone was so cold my words couldn‚Äôt have been interpreted as a question.¬†

His brow furrowed and his eyes searched my expression with confusion. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just, whenever I came over to check on any issues you were having I would always see little black hairs in corners or behind furniture... I just assumed you had a secret pet or something. But this is much too long to be from an animal.‚Äù

The more he spoke the more I fought back an extreme wave of nausea building up inside me. I lost, bent over and hurled onto the tile beneath me. I heard my landlord curse and rush to my side, awkwardly patting me on the back. When I was done retching, I forced myself to talk through the bile on my tongue. ‚ÄúWhere‚Ä¶ was that hair you found?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúB-behind the television set? Jesus, are you okay?‚Äù

I spit up onto the floor again, choking on my terror. All at once it hit me. It had been here the whole time. It was right in front of me, all night, watching. Waiting for something. For me to fall asleep again?

I dry heaved through my panic attack. Bobby didn‚Äôt say anything more, grabbing the paper towel roll from the kitchen and dragging my trash can to my side, waiting somewhat impatiently for me to calm down. When my breathing slowed and my vision cleared I heard him say. ‚ÄúSam, what the hell is going on?‚Äù

I slowly sat up and turned to meet his gaze. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any pets and I‚Äôm not seeing anyone. I never have friends or family over. It‚Äôs just me.‚Äù

A cold understanding etched into his face. He looked around the brightly lit room before lowering his voice. ‚ÄúI checked all the rooms, in the closet and storage too. There can‚Äôt be anyone else here right now.‚Äù He looked towards the door, ‚ÄúYou keep your door locked right?‚Äù¬†

I nodded.

‚ÄúAlways?‚Äù

I nodded again.

He was quiet for a minute or so. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get the locks changed first thing tomorrow. In the meantime, do you have somewhere else you can stay?‚Äù¬†

I shook my head.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll call 911 and report this, but without evidence of a break in or stolen property‚Ä¶ they won‚Äôt be able to do more than write a report.‚Äù¬†

At this point I was barely listening to him. Fuck. Why me? What had I done to deserve at best, an insane stalker who had a key to my house and at worst, a supernatural entity taking an interest in me?¬†

‚ÄúCall them. Do whatever makes you feel better.‚Äù My body was shaking violently. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt make a difference.‚Äù I felt him stall behind me, momentarily frozen. A rush of anger filled my senses. I was sick of him, sick of my life, sick of the disgusting smell emanating from my floor. ‚ÄúJust do something, goddammit!‚Äù I barked hopelessly.

Bobby dropped the roll and fumbled with his phone, swiping through tabs before pulling up his contacts. He shot me one last concerned look before running out the door.

I went to the couch and fished the knife from between the cushions, turning to face the hallway to my room. As a child, there were two places in my room that scared me more than anything, my closet and under my bed. Bobby claimed to have checked my closet, which meant it could only be in one place.

Rushing towards the hallway, I began the march to my end. Despite my determination and anger, I felt as though I was moving in slow motion; the hallway seemed to stretch on much longer than it actually was. Maybe it was just nerves. Maybe it was something else. After a minute or so I finally reached my room. My eyes darted around to ensure everything was still as it had been last night, before they rested on my bed, or more accurately, under it.¬†

Poking out from where the comforter met the carpet were long strands of black hair, barely noticeable if it had not been for the lighter carpet. I gawked in terror as the hair incrementally slinked under the comforter, moving back farther into the recesses of dark, empty space.

I was in over my head, I knew that. I was a fool to think I could confront this, and immediately turned to leave, but it was too late. I stared uselessly into the dark abyss that had previously been my hallway. It knew I knew, and it wasn‚Äôt going to let me leave this time.¬†

I‚Äôve been in my room ever since, typing this. I gathered the courage to jump onto my bed like I had when I was a little kid, hopping over whatever monsters lay in wait below it. I figure when I die I might as well do it how I lived: comfortable. The wifi still works I think but so far no one‚Äôs been answering my texts or calls. I can still use Reddit though. Having the last thing I ever do be a post on Reddit really sucks, but I also feel like you guys may be the only ones who understand where I‚Äôm coming from.

There‚Äôs a reason I don‚Äôt have friends. After moving so often and losing Maxine, I stopped seeing the point in building relationships, and when I did, I sabotaged them. My entire life I‚Äôve been a recluse and kept myself company with my own art and imagination. Now, it may be the thing to end my life. I don‚Äôt know. I can‚Äôt stop thinking this situation is a deathtrap I designed for myself, and on the other hand feeling like there was nothing I could have done to prevent it. The more I think the worse I get and the more tired I feel. I should‚Äôve ran after Bobby, I should‚Äôve rented a hotel. But another part of me knows that no matter where I would run, I would have never escaped it. I guess, in some twisted way, this whole experience has made me realize I was never¬†*truly*¬†alone.

Well, that's all from me. I still have my kitchen knife and 13% left on my phone battery, not that it‚Äôll do much. I don‚Äôt know how long I can stay awake for, but I refuse to go down without a fight.¬†I can‚Äôt run away anymore.

Chapter 1
The day Jared Hurlow's first love, Siena Lisburn, returned to the country, I decided to leave him.
In the three years of our marriage, he never stopped thinking about Siena‚Äîand I was exhausted, emotionally and mentally.
For the last three days, I'd stopped arguing with him.
I watched as he rented out an entire revolving restaurant to celebrate Siena's birthday and fasten around her neck the necklace I had designed.
Later, I destroyed Siena's engagement party.
Meeting Jared's furious gaze, I smiled. ""Congratulations, Jared.
""This is my gift to you two. Do you like it?""
***
Standing in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows, I couldn't help but think about the phone call with my mom just a few minutes earlier.
She had seen the news and called me about Jared and Siena.
Jared still wasn't home.
Or maybe, he never planned to come home tonight.
On the front page, a photo of him and Siena walking side by side out of the airport glared back at me.
The headline read, ""Hurlow Group's CEO Welcomes First Love Siena Home in Person.""
Ten years ago, he was caught in a nightmare‚Äîhis family went bankrupt, and his parents betrayed him.
I was there for him, fighting our way up from nothing.
I gave everything I had to pull him back from the brink.
I stayed by his side as he rebuilt his business empire.
I remember the night of his celebration party, when his eyes were fixed only on me.
That was when I fell for him.
I thought I'd made the right decision.
But reality hit me hard on our third wedding anniversary.
That was the first time Jared murmured Siena's name in a drunken haze.
His first love from youth drove a wedge between us.
Jared began staying out constantly.
There were unexplained property records under his name and encrypted, yet clearly suggestive, messages on his phone.
Each one stabbed at my heart like a sharp blade.
""I confronted him and fought with him, completely losing control.""
All I earned was his growing impatience and indifference.
""Amelia Kirwell, you've changed,"" he'd said, looking at me like I was a stranger.
He said I wasn't gentle or understanding anymore‚Äîthat I'd become irritating.
I simply replied, ""The 72-hour countdown starts now.""
My voice trembled and cracked, but it was heavy with relief.

Chapter 2
The final three days.
I drifted through them like a soulless spectator.
Jared rented out the city's largest revolving restaurant to celebrate Siena's return.
Her massive portraits flashed across the giant LED screens.
Reporters swarmed the place, headlines screaming, ""Mr. Hurlow Spares No Expense for His Muse.""
I sat at home, quietly sorting through what was left of my life.
Clothes. Design sketches.
In the wedding photo on the wall, Jared had his arm around my waist, his smile genuine.
I reached up, took the frame down, and smashed it hard against the floor.
The glass shattered‚Äîjust like our marriage had, long ago.
The wedding ring‚Äîsupposedly the only one he'd ever given in his life.
I tossed it carelessly into the pile of broken glass.
Jared came home once, his clothes scented with another woman's perfume.
He noticed the empty spaces in the closet and the bare walls, his brow furrowing.
""What are you doing now?""
His tone was impatient. ""Siena just got back. There are a lot of events. I have to be with her‚Äîit's for work, you should understand.""
He tossed a velvet box onto the coffee table.
""Limited edition Van Cleef & Arpels. To make it up to you.""
I opened the box. Inside was a diamond necklace worth a small fortune.
It was worlds apart from the cheap silver chain he once gave me in that basement‚Äîthe one he'd saved up for six months to buy, the one warmed by his hands.
""Thank you.""
I closed the lid, my voice flat. ""It's beautiful.""
He seemed surprised by my reaction, studying me for a few seconds.
Then his annoyance only deepened.
""As long as you like it.""
He loosened his tie, turned, and disappeared into the study. He never came out.
48 hours left on the countdown.
The doorbell rang.
Standing outside was Siena.
She wore a couture dress from this season, her smile gentle, but her eyes glittered with triumph.
""Ms. Kirwell, aren't you going to invite me in?""
She let herself in without waiting for an answer.
She looked around, taking in the home that once belonged to Jared and me.
Her gaze landed on the Van Cleef & Arpels box on the coffee table.
She laughed lightly. ""Oh, Jay gave me the same one. He said it suits me better.""
She came closer. ""Ms. Kirwell, I heard you helped Jay a lot in the past. That must have been tough. But now, I will take care of him.""
Her tone was cool, a declaration that she was the real mistress of this house.
""Jay says the place is too big, too cold. Once I move in, we'll redecorate, add some warmth.""
I watched her performance with a blank expression.
""Oh, right,"" she said, as if just remembering. She pulled an invitation from her purse.
""Tomorrow's my engagement party‚Äîtop floor of the Four Seasons Hotel, the one owned by the Hurlow Group.
""Jay insisted you be there to witness our happiness.""
She pressed the invitation into my hand. ""Ms. Kirwell, you'll come, won't you?""
I took the glaring invitation, my voice even. ""Sure.""
Satisfied, Siena smiled and swept out the door.

Chapter 3
The final 24 hours of the countdown.
Jared came home, his face dark and stormy. ""Siena was here, wasn't she?""
There was a note of accusation in his voice.
""Yeah.""
""She invited you to the engagement party?""
He scrutinized me, his gaze sharp as a blade.
""Yeah.""
I didn't look up, just kept packing my things.
""Amelia.""
His tone was cold and sharp.
""Tomorrow's event is important. I don't want you showing up and causing a scene, making Siena uncomfortable.""
""Uncomfortable?""
I finally looked up at him, letting out a bitter laugh. ""Jared, do you really think I'm not humiliated enough already?""
His eyes flickered, but impatience quickly took over. ""Let the past stay in the past. Siena and I are serious.
""If you just behave, you'll keep your place as Mrs. Hurlow. You'll get everything you deserve.""
""My place as Mrs. Hurlow?""
I scoffed.
""What is that, exactly? An empty title? A prop? Just a backdrop to showcase your true love with Siena? Jared, what am I to you?!""
""Amelia!"" he snapped, voice low and harsh. ""Don't be ungrateful! I can give you a life of luxury, a status everyone envies‚Äîwhat more do you want?
""Siena... she's different. She understands me. She needs me.""
""She needs you?""
I stared at him, my face expressionless.
""Jared, when you had nothing, when you were beaten down and abandoned, who stood by you? Who needed you then?
""It was me!
""And where was Siena? When you hit rock bottom, she turned her back and ran straight into someone else's arms!
""And now that you've made it, now she's back, and suddenly she understands you? Suddenly she needs you?!""
""Shut up!""
He raised his hand, then slammed it down on the cabinet beside him, the crash echoing through the room.
His chest heaved, his face thunderous.
""Don't you dare insult Siena! She had her reasons back then‚Äîyou wouldn't understand! All you ever do is nitpick, acting like some bitter shrew!""
""Fine, I don't understand.""
The last bit of warmth in my chest vanished for good.
I nodded, refusing to look at him again.
""Don't worry. I'll be there. After all, as Mrs. Hurlow, I have to keep up appearances, don't I?""
He eyed me suspiciously, then let out a cold snort and slammed the door on his way out.

Chapter 4
Top floor of the Four Seasons Hotel.
Siena was breathtaking in a custom-made wedding gown, her beauty almost unreal.
She clung to Jared's arm, her smile radiant as she basked in everyone's well wishes.
Jared wore a perfectly tailored black suit, tall and striking.
The way he looked at Siena‚Äîwith that deep focus and tenderness‚Äîwas once so familiar to me.
Now, that gaze was a dagger, stabbing straight into my numb heart.
I wore a simple slip dress, my face bare, utterly out of place in this glittering celebration.
Holding a glass of champagne, I stood in the farthest, darkest corner.
The emcee's voice rang out across the hall, ""Distinguished guests, let us witness together the engagement of Mr. Jared Hurlow and Ms. Siena Lisburn...""
Jared and Siena exchanged a smile so sweet it seemed to overflow from the giant screens.
""Mr. Hurlow, do you‚Äî""
A sudden surge of jealousy flared in my chest. Without thinking, I swung my arm and sent the towering champagne display crashing down!
Crash!
The shattering sound echoed through the entire ballroom.
Crystal flutes toppled and exploded, champagne cascading everywhere.
A torrent of wine splashed squarely onto Siena's priceless white dress, crimson liquid spreading like wildfire across the delicate fabric.
Siena's scream pierced the silence.
The room froze.
Every eye‚Äîshocked, appalled, judgmental, some even gloating‚Äî
All fixed on me.
The tenderness on Jared's face vanished in an instant, replaced by fury and disbelief.
He whipped his head around, his glare like a blade, zeroing in on me in the shadows.
He shoved Siena aside and stormed over, his anger radiating off him as he seized my wrist in a bruising grip.
""Amelia!""
He growled, ""Have you lost your mind? You just had to make a scene, humiliate us in front of everyone?!""
Pain shot through my arm, but I only frowned slightly.
Staring into his handsome face, twisted now with rage, I let a slow smile curve my lips.
Not in anger, not in sorrow, but in utter release.
I rose up on my toes, ignoring the suffocating tension rolling off him, and leaned close to his flushed ear.
My breath was warm against his skin; my voice was soft, eerily calm.
""Congratulations, Jared,"" I whispered.
""You finally get to marry your first love.""
I swept my gaze across the silent, stunned crowd, then back to his furious eyes.
""This is my wedding gift to you...
""Do you like it?""
Jared's pupils constricted, his grip on my wrist tightening painfully.
His lips parted, as if to roar something at me.
But in that instant‚Äî
""Countdown complete.
""Return protocol initiated.""
A cold, mechanical voice echoed in my mind‚Äîright on cue.
And as Jared stared at me as if he'd seen a ghost, my body began to dissolve, breaking apart into a thousand tiny, shimmering blue lights.
Like fireflies on a summer night, the lights slipped through his grasp and drifted upward, free at last.
My smile froze on my lips as I gazed into the void.
""I'm going home. Goodbye... forever.""
The rage on Jared's face shattered, replaced by pure terror and confusion.
He instinctively reached out, grabbing at the scattered lights.
But his hands closed on nothing but empty air.
""Amelia?!""
His voice cracked in panic, raw and desperate.
A second later‚Äî
The lights vanished completely, dissolving into the domed ceiling of the grand ballroom.
Gone like mist, without a trace.
All that remained was the stunned silence and the mess on the floor. And Jared stood frozen in place, hand outstretched, eyes hollow and empty.",2,1755321510.0,romancenovels,2,1.0,False
1mrlncg,https://youtu.be/MNkjXYUDJWA?si=QOKnIztz1IfvEHcl,[Translation] Pony's Analysis on R4 T1-HLE (LCK Caster+Analyst),"**T1 vs. HLE**

Really cool series. It was a 2:0, but different from the extremely one-sided 2:0's that we've had recently. I would assume that this was the kind of game that most people expected the Legend Group to be full of when the split happened, no? Of course, it's a shame that it ended the way it did. But the progression was definitely different than the extremely lopsided, sub-hour 2:0 series that we've had recently.

That was the case because HLE looked a lot better than they did in R3. That's why they had a lot more things going for them in-game, and had many instances where they were surpassing, or keeping up with T1 in game state. The only problem was that they were going against T1, who were already in form and were ready for whatever HLE had in store.

Game 1 Draft

HLE

Bans : Neeko Aurora Gwen / Jhin Yunara

Picks : Varus / XinZhao Galio / Jax Rell

T1

Bans : Pantheon Azir Yone / Poppy Renekton

Picks : Orianna Wukong Ambessa / Bard Sivir

Let's go over the draft for Game 1. The question of the day was ""Are you going to pick Yunara against Varus?"", with T1 having to answer. Personally, I think a lot of different teams would answer this question differently. Yes, Varus can just bully Yunara out of the stratopshere. But we also just saw Yunara just take over the game versus Varus in the earlier DNF-BRO game, right? So I think some teams definitely do have some interesting takes when it comes to Varus-Yunara.

Instead of going for the Yunara, T1 opt for their recently tried-and-true Ambessa-Bard. Kinda sounds like Armbar when you abbreviate those two in Korean, how fitting. Before going any further, I do want to cover this Ambessa-Bard in a bit more detail.

I do think that T1 definitely has something going for Doran and Keria when they do pick up the Ambessa-Bard. Both of these champions have skillsets that have crazy amounts of mobility, right? So I think the strength in mobility really translates into how both Keria and Doran are able to see the game in a 'wider' sense.

It allows them to 'size up', or get a quote for whatever situation is happening much earlier, and much further away than everyone else. What I mean is that you usually always have to be face-to-face with the situation on hand, and on-site in person to get a feel for what you're going to do, and what's going to happen, right? But the extreme mobility of the Ambessa-Bard allows Doran-Keria to size up their opponents off-screen, and come up with angles that their opponents aren't expecting.

That was the strength of T1's Ambessa-Bard comp in Game 1. That was their answer to HLE's very standard Varus-Galio-Jax. So with the drafts being finished out, you had an extremely honest, standard comp from HLE that's good in teamfights and also extremely well-suited to counter enemy angles/advances. The T1 comp on the other hand, was T1 saying that they would play on an 'axis' entirely different from HLE with the Ambessa-Bard, and outplay their comp by coming up with angles HLE don't expect.

(Game 1 7:15)

HLE play to their strengths really well. Look at what happened in the toplane early on in Game 1. Numerous other teams would have been unable to get anything back, and dragged around on T1's whim in this kind of situation.

This is why I can confidently say that HLE's form is looking a lot better. Before this toplane fight, HLE's botlane were not doing so well due to Keria's Bard Q landing into a stun earlier. Varus was not having a good time. Almost alll other teams in the LCK would have lost their game against T1 off of this alone. I guarantee it.

However, HLE follows up. They are not only able to recoup that losing situation through angles of their own, but are also able to find re-engage angles on what seemed like a T1-favored engage. The fact that HLE indeed are able to engage in total war with T1 in these kinds of situations, and can manage to come out ahead in a battle of attrition is a testament to how their form has improved in the past couple weeks.

It's interesting how T1 respond to this altercation in the Toplane though. They realize that they will probably lose if they keep giving HLE these favorable fights over and over. So they play out this style where they purposefully avoid all physical interaction with HLE and stick to controlling waves and taking plates.

So it's a battle of two opposite styles. HLE have the sturdy, honest teamfight comp that wants to fight. On the other hand, T1 have the hyper-mobile comp that allows them to avoid any interaction with HLE.

The way these two opposing styles play against each other, is exactly why these teams are in the Legend Group. It's precisely why this Game 1 was such a treat to watch. It's not one of those games where one side comes out ahead, and everything just kind of ends there. It's two teams constantly trying to one-up the other by min-maxxing and cross-mapping in response to whatever the opponent is doing.

(Game 1 8:30)

Look at what happens here near the Grub pit as well. T1 did their thing, and want to leave. HLE immediately catches on and jumps on Keria's Bard. However, Bard falls in the most time-consuming way possible, where HLE have to invest their Flashes to finish him off. HLE are able to secure a kill on the other side of the fight, but Doran is solo-pushing bot this entire time.

Stuff like this makes games so, so fun to watch. Each side has something that they want to say. It's not just boom, teamfight, one side loses, falls behind. It's like watching this very cerebral stand-off between two teams, where both sides are constantly pushing their limits to try and match, or overtake the other.

(Game 1, 19:10)

This constant back-and-forth game state continues until this moment. For me, this is when the game really tilted over to T1's favor. Let's go over this moment in Gumayusi's POV. I'm a Sivir, and I just cleared the sweeping plant to identify Xin and Rell's positions. So there's this sense of security, right? That's why he chucks out a boomerang before walking back to the Outer Turret.

HLE and Viper knowing this, fires a Varus R to try and catch him. It lands. I'm not sure exactly what happened here. Though I am almost sure that Sivir's Spellshield was on cooldown because of a previous interaction, which denied the opportunity to absorb the Varus R.

Gumayusi was supposed to go down here. But he doesn't. If I was HLE, I would been so, so, angry. Keria's Bard. Bard, of all things. The Bard puts Sivir into stasis, then gives him a Heal Summoner and a couple coffee mugs as well. The Sivir lives, and the Bard just casually Bard-walks away.

(Game 1, 21:20)

It's not entirely over for HLE though. And from that moment on, they keep doing what they're supposed to do. In addition, HLE also have Zeus on Jax, who had started to come online on an accelerated pace.

With Jax not being as popular these days, I think we all kind of glossed over him a bit during the broadcast. However, the Jax was almost kind of set up to become a menace all the way back from draft. Not only was it against a very AA-heavy T1 comp, but it was also in Zeus's hands. We all know what kind of nasty things high-caliber players like Zeus are capable of on Jax, right?

And throughout the game, the Jax had quite a comfortable time scaling up to this point. While the Ambessa rushed Eclipse for her early spike, Zeus opted to rush Tabis first to ensure he had a smooth early-game scaling experience. That's exactly what ended up happening, with Zeus approaching this Atakhan fight with TriForce-Tabis.

Unfortunately, this is when the teleport spawn location bug ended up happening. We weren't able to inform the viewers during the broadcast today about exactly what went down, because the casters are usually the last-in-line to be informed about the ins and outs when things like these occur.

If the TP ended up channeling as intended, things could have been different. The Jax would have had a much easier entry to leap in with his Counterstrike, which would have been enough to turn the fight around in HLE's favor. However, that wasn't the case, and HLE ended up losing the fight after being sucked into T1's playing field.

When things like this happen on stage, it's a mess. LCK has to go back and check exactly what happened, then check to see if the identified issue is a bug or not. If it is a bug, then they have to sift through the list of known bugs to see if it was previously notified to both teams. Throughout this process, the casters are usually just kind of left in the dark. Like I said, we're the last to get notified, and we're just kind of there killing time by panning the camera to the audience while the situation is being figured out.

In my opinion, what happened was a pretty serious in-game bug. However, it was identified as a 'known bug', where the rulebook states that the game just carries on as usual. I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure the bug has to do with TP being changed to a 'dash' this season, and the TP destination coordinates being jumbled up because of it. I'm not 100% sure though. Hope it gets fixed.

Anyways, T1 win the fight, and proceed to win Game 1 after that.

Now on to Game 2. Let's start with Draft.

HLE

Bans : Neeko Aurora Pantheon / Alistar Jhin

Picks : Rumble / Yone Maokai / Corki Blitzcrank

T1

Bans : Azir Yunara Gwen / Rakan Ezreal

Picks : Yorick Trundle / Annie / Lucian / Braum

HLE end up resorting to something that they know they're good at. The Zeka Yone, and the Peanut Maokai. It's a pretty good answer into the Trundle that T1 picked as well, since the Maokai can just build AP to decrease Trundle's Subjugate value.

So both teams end up with their respective comps, where T1 has the prio-favored comp. Lots of strong lanes, and a jungler that can move first. To that, HLE had much better laning and teamfights. With Game 2 going pretty late, this dynamic ended up being quite interesting.

People might have noticed that I was on a very positive note while talking about HLE earlier. I did so because I do feel that their in-game play has indeed improved compared to Round 3. In R3, a lot of HLE's play just kind of seemed 'impromptu', or 'unorganized' in a way. Their play just gave off the impression that they were only relying on their raw 'skill' or their team's 'power level' when it came to every game they played.

On that note, I do think the type of play they were able to show against teams like GenG and T1 recently give off some hopeful vibes. However, I am a bit worried when it comes to them losing multiple games while pushing in the enemy base. If I recall, it's the third time this has happened this season.

It happened once near T1's inhibitor in Round 3, and it happened the other time while they were trying to push KT's nexus. Today, it happened in the exact same spot. Near their redside enemy's botlane inhibitor, and from a base siege.

(Game 2, 29:50)

Let's take a look at what happened today. Gumayusi's Lucian has both Barrier and Flash. HLE have a full minute left on their Baron buff. Doran is pushing Mid with Yorick, but is nowhere near where HLE need to panic and ""amg yorick is breaking our base we need to fight.""

In hindsight, there wasn't a reason for HLE to be pushed to do anything. However, HLE overextend with the Yone onto Lucian, where the Lucian ends up surviving. Doran TPs back to base on Yorick, and also picks up nearly 1.5k worth of gold through a shutdown onto Rumble.

Let's see. I'm actually not sure if HLE could have 100% ended, even if they had secured the kill on to Lucian. It's a bit awkward, because it does seem that T1 could have pulled off a defense, but HLE also have 2 baron-ed cannon minions.

That's beside the point. What happened was that HLE pulled the trigger, and T1 were able to hold. Now, the game didn't suddenly go over to T1's favor because of this. A lull-state happened after that play, with HLE still being around 4k ahead.

(Game 2, 32:00)

So all HLE really needed to do was play to their strengths. Specifically the one derived from their team composition. So they go for it again near T1's Mid Inner Turret.

Note Doran's item build here. This is a teamfight-focused build, and not a 'i brek base' kind of build. He realizes that the Rumble and Maokai are never going to be in a poisition to kill him with magic damage in teamfights or in a sidelane. So he secures minimal MR through Mercs, and goes for extra long-term survivability in Sundered Sky and armor instead.

So HLE drop their Maokai R - Rumble R - Blitz Q combo. They nearly, nearly end up dropping the Lucian here as well. But the Lucian lives with a sliver of health. Something near 40 HP, if I recall correctly.

Off of this, T1 are able to launch a counterattack. The major problem that T1 had were that their only form of engage was a low-range Annie into HLE's comp. But with HLE failing to drop Lucian in their initial engage, Annie is able to find an opening. Then the 1.5k gold influx snowball onto Doran's Yorick from the previous fight grows even larger, with the Yorick securing even more kills.

The game became fully equalized off of this. T1 not only matched HLE in gold from their counteroffensive, but were also able to mess up HLE's base timers after the fight had concluded. The Yorick now also completes his Warden's Mail into a Randuins.

Let's rewind a bit, and take a look at both HLE and T1's comps again. We're pretty much in the late game at this point, right? HLE's comp has a definitive strength over T1's in any sort of stand-off. To which T1's comp doesn't have any clear-cut means to overpower HLE's Maokai-Rumble-Blitzcrank in a standoff.

So T1 are just improvising at this point. They didn't pick this sort of comp thinking to play this late into the game. So their only gameplan is pretty much every person on the team playing to the best of their ability in every upcoming situation.

Like I said, their only form of engage was the Annie. But the Annie is nowhere enough to break open the pressure exerted by Maokai-Rumble-Blitzcrank. So T1 are always on the recieving end, and have to wait until HLE make their move into them.

(Game 2, 32:05)

So that's what happens. But I do feel that HLE could have executed their combo a bit more carefully. For one, the Maokai R and Blitzcrank advance were not in sync. Look here, right where the Maokai R is about to hit. Blitzcrank is nowhere in position to hook a priority target like Lucian. He ends up having to move a couple more units forward for his hook attempt.

HLE were rushing. They were desperate. When they had no reason to. Yes, they would have 100% won if they were able to drop the Lucian here. And they were close. Like 44 HP close. But what I'm saying is that they could have approached this entire setup a bit more carefully.

Now, I'm not fully criticizing HLE for rushing. Considering that they just lost a pretty insurmountable lead in the previous fight, I can totally see how they would be desperate to end the game right then and there.

I am aware that a good chunk of our viewership like to focus on the concept of 'value'. I think almost 90% of the questions that come up in any Korean LCK stream right after draft, or the first couple minutes of the game is ""Which side has better value?""

It's quite amusing in a way. Now, I understand why people may be concerned with the concept of 'value' and 'scaling' so much, with it being the deciding factor for a lot of games in the LCK. However, I also do think it's a bit too early to be considering those factors 3 minutes into the game.

The reason I bring this up is that the concept of 'scaling' and 'value' was also present in this Game 2. It was heavily in favor of HLE's side, right?

I believe this led a lot of people to think that the game was simply 'unwinnable' for T1, and 'unlosable' for HLE after a certain point. Now, that's true, but also untrue.

The thing with 'value' and 'scaling' is that it doesn't grow infinitely. Yes, the graph does creep northeast for a while, but there does come a point in time where the playing field becomes relatively level again.

There indeed are games where this is the case, where the inherent 'strengths' of a comp become nonexistent once the game goes to late-late game. It's not always the case, but these games do exist, based on what comps are being played.

What I mean is that a lot of those strengths can be diminished, or fully wiped out in some extreme, late-game circumstances. For example, if it's a situation where both teams have arrived at their full item builds, it usually really just comes down to who plays better.

Everyone's autoattack is a ballistic missile, and everyone's basic ability is a tactical nuke. When it comes to that point in time, it's really not about executing a comp, but really about who's able to come out ahead in that extreme-type of situation.

Again, this only applies to some games, with certain comps. While these games exist, games where the exact opposite happens also do exist as well.

So HLE, lategame Maokai-Blitz. Seems kinda over, right? But the thing about the Maokai-Blitz is that it's effectiveness varies with how much of the map you're able to use. For the combo to really work as intended, you need to be utilizing more of the map than the enemy. The more the better. The problem with this was that T1 were able to regain control over a large chunk of the map after HLE's 2nd push failed.

(Game 2, 38:50)

So the game-ending moment. Initially, I think HLE were trying to go for Doran in the sidelane. However, the problem was that the Yorick was given an extremely large amount of gold throughout the past couple fights, with him having a completed Randuins.

For a large portion of the game, Yone did have the upper hand against the Yorick. No tabis, and just a Sundered Sky, Shojins, and TriForce. A 3-4 item Yone just rips through that, right? A couple autos and skill rotations on 1 Soul Unbound, and the Yorick has to fall back.

But as you see, the Randuins was all the Yorick needed. The Yone gets off almost no damage on the Yorick, and Doran is able to get away.

On the opposite side of the map, we have Faker near the Dragon pit. Faker realizes that his team is getting engaged on, and that it will be too late if he decides to walk over to the fight. Instead, he flashes over the wall, and stops Zeus's Rumble from joining the fight.

T1 wins the 4v4, and the game is over. The stage is set for the Lucian to go ham, and he does.

What's dissappointing is that we didn't get a 'wow' moment to end the game. That's because T1 were able to get a very good teamfight, but HLE weren't. The Rumble just kind of got picked off, the Yone got nothing done onto the Yorick, and the Corki just got isolated and 100-0ed. It wasn't a 'proper' teamfight, for lack of a better way to put it. HLE overextended.

So there indeed were 2 instances where HLE's comp did have a seemingly 'unstoppable' advantage over T1's. One near T1's botlane inhibitor, and the other near T1's Midlane Inner Turret. But HLE blew both of those opportunities.

I still do want to point out that HLE do indeed look a lot better. But I'm also worried about the whole base-push backfiring thing getting to their heads. HLE, I know you're a good team. Please fix these issues, and get better. I know you can.",4,1755321466.0,leagueoflegends,0,0.83,False

First, this type of business would only make sense in areas that have a lot of trail running and a large community of trail runners. So keep that in mind.

Now, imagine a small retail store that serves trail runners. No elitism, no sales pitches, just passion and love for the sport and the community. 

This store has a wide variety of trail shoes from the standard Brooks and Hokas, to more niche brands like Norda, Speedland, etc. plus a library of demo shoes that can be checked out and tested. A true try before you buy experience. 

Apparel entirely geared towards trail runners. Every pair of shorts has storage, tops in a variety of materials (polyester, merino wool, even cotton), various weights of fabric for different conditions, rain and wind layers, socks galore.

This store carries lights (Fenix, kogalla, ultraspire), poles (leki, black diamond), waist belts, hydration packs, handhelds, ice bandanas, hats, sun protection, running spikes, running snowshoes. This store just has all the trail specific accessories you could ask for.

A stacked nutrition selection with a wide variety of gels, chews, tablets, powders, you name it.

All the PT tools - scrapers, rollers, balls, balance boards, bands, massage guns

Electronics like Garmin and Coros watches, HR monitors, sweat sensors, and whatever other new and weird tech that lots of trail runners love. 

This store just has what trail runners need and is always evolving with the sport. 

The retail side is the boring part though.

This store is more than a store, it‚Äôs a community hub. The Mecca for all things trail. 

It has a race team (adult and youth), a run club, couch to trail programs, outreach into underserved communities (because trail is for everyone), trail work days. It puts on a 4 season race series, a free annual 10k/25k/50k, discounts for middle school and high school programs. 

It‚Äôs a third space. This store wants you to come by and just hang out and shoot the shit. Free coffee. Watch parties for all the big races. A jam packed events calendar. 

This store serves the community, builds the community, and connects the community. It‚Äôs basically a trail running church. 


Is this something you would like in your community? Would you shop there? Would you like to have that kind of center of the universe place to go be with other trail runners? 

This is just a concept I‚Äôve been toying with. Probably wouldn‚Äôt make much money, but that‚Äôs not the point. It‚Äôs an attempt to bring the passion and community back into the retail space like the old surf/skate/bike shops. Maybe that whole concept is just dead now, but I‚Äôd like to think the community would rally around a hub like this. ",2,1755321428.0,trailrunning,11,1.0,False

1mrlkhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novels/comments/1mrlkhe/harpers_ferry/,Harpers Ferry,"The waters at Harpers Ferry kept company with the roads and there divided into three. One branch came down out of the Shenandoah on the Virginia side; another curved from the Potomac along the Maryland shore; and there, at that meeting-place, the streams were joined. For a space they lay as still as any lake‚Äîso still they might turn the blue ridgelines and the black seams of old oaks upside down‚Äîthen slid southward, and farther southward yet, marking for a time the boundary among three states‚ÄîVirginia, Maryland, and West Virginia‚Äîbefore the flow bore on as the main stem of the Potomac.

Because three roads splayed thence‚Äîone toward Luray and Front Royal, one up to the hill of St. Peter‚Äôs Church, and one on to Brunswick and Frederick‚Äîtravelers were ever about, and the Harpers Ferry market prospered even on days that were no market-days at all. There are many ways into the Appalachians; yet the fair set along the C&O Canal towpath had a name that traveled uncommonly far. There are state lines enough in this republic; yet when folk spoke of ‚Äúthe market on the line,‚Äù they meant this one. On market-days the tenant farmers came down out of the hills with ramps and morels, fiddleheads and blackberries; peddlers from the Maryland side crossed with thread and needles, round hand mirrors, pocketknives, twine, and small tin trinkets; and from downstream the fishmongers of the Potomac and the Shenandoah trudged up with shad and herring, smallmouth bass, catfish, and American eel. For a gorge it was a respectable mart indeed‚Äîbut Harpers Ferry‚Äôs renown was not raised upon trade alone.

Even when no market was pitched, the place drew people out of the neighboring towns; perhaps because every inn that had crept from the towpath up onto the knolls poured hard cider preternaturally clear and cold, and pan-fried trout the instant it came out of the water. Perhaps it was for the old-time ballads‚Äîheavy with sorrow and with style‚Äîand the shape-note hymns whose hearty harmonies drifted year-round through the weeping willows that lined the porch. And then there were the tent shows and the string bands that now and again rolled in from the west; by custom and long precedent they shook out their last rehearsal‚Äîtruth to tell, their first performance‚Äîright here ere crossing a state line. That too lifted the market‚Äôs name and made it dear.

Of all such houses, May‚Äôs inn, the Willow & Trout, was most renowned: drink that tasted better than elsewhere, prices that ran low, and May‚Äôs open hand. Folk favored her the more, and pitied her too, for she had lately lost her mother and lived with none save her bachelor son and two kitchen girls, waiting upon a husband whose road home seemed doubtful. If a traveler‚Äôs purse ran thin or his kit proved wanting, he made for May‚Äôs as a matter of course.

‚ÄúWhen I come back from Maryland, we‚Äôll settle up together.‚Äù

Men spoke it as if it were nothing.

It was at a summer sundown‚Äîwillow wands rinsed by the river, shad flashing in the evening gloaming‚Äîwhen an old hawker of brushes and combs, well past sixty, climbed May‚Äôs porch with frames and comb-boards across his shoulders, a cane in one hand and a fan in the other. Close upon him stood a slender young woman of about one-and-twenty with a small bundle tucked at her side. Both looked bone-weary.

‚ÄúTwo of you, counting the young lady?‚Äù May asked, observing the big girl more than the old man. He nodded without a word.

That night, when the table had been cleared, he asked leave to declare himself. Walker, he said. He lodged near Shepherdstown and had come to earn a trifle on the Virginia side. His home country was the mountains of West Virginia; as a young man he had followed a friend and dwelt for a while near Harpers Ferry, then drifted to the shipyard at Charleston, then to the mills at Swannanoa, and later to a factory-town inland‚Äîlonely as any island‚Äîwhere he labored eighteen years, turning gray, before at last circling back toward the Shenandoah a few years gone. When May asked how he could be traveling with so grown a girl, he answered that he had meant never to wander again, not to the end of his days; yet if they did not take to the road, the two of them would starve.

‚ÄúShe is your daughter, then?‚Äù May looked past the slant of lamplight toward the corner where the young woman, bright-eyed, glanced this way now and again, her shoulders rounded and gentle. The old man nodded once more. A life of drifting, he said, had made even the place to which he returned feel like yet another lodging‚Äîno better than a stranger‚Äôs house‚Äîand a father‚Äôs daughter with nowhere to lean was a sorrow.

‚ÄúWhen I was young I liked sport myself,‚Äù the old man continued. ‚ÄúI roamed with a little troupe, playing the clown and making merry‚Ä¶ New Year‚Äôs when I was four-and-twenty‚Äîsix-and-thirty years to the day‚ÄîI spent one high night at this very market.‚Äù He peered about the room as though teasing out a thread of memory.

‚ÄúMercy, that is an age ago!‚Äù May feigned more astonishment than she felt.

It rained upon the morrow.

Eli‚Äîwho set up his book-stall only upon market-days‚Äîwas coming down a day early from the school at St. Peter‚Äôs on the hill to lay in what he would need for the morrow. The road from the church to the market is but a scant couple of miles of good going; yet that day the sweep of water and rock and splendid gorge would not let him have the back of the road.

At first he had been led to school by the wrist‚Äîdragged, truth be told, by his grandmother‚Äîand then he kept going, tugged along by affection for the older boys. But of late the daily bell, the Latin hymns, even the clear shade of the elms and maples in the yard grew wearisome.

He had always wished to wing off to somewhere‚Äîanywhere‚Äîbut his mother flared up red-eyed at the very word go.

‚ÄúI have no husband, and no kin to speak of. I have staked my life upon you. If you talk of going day and night, upon whom am I to lean?‚Äù He had heard that lament until it set like nails in his ears.

His grandmother, for her part, had hoped the bell would bleed the wander out of him once she sent him to school at ten. But when Eli was about three, a traveling phrenologist‚Äîone of those men who read a child‚Äôs bent by the bumps upon a skull‚Äîhad passed through the inn and declared, ‚ÄúThis boy hath the temperament of a traveler,‚Äù and for a time she took it to heart and mourned. She asked the parish priest one day, and an odd hermit beyond the ridge on another, but the saying never changed.

‚ÄúHe is born to take after his daddy‚Äôs ways,‚Äù his grandmother muttered‚Äîonly half a dig at his mother, and not from malice. May, who took such remarks to heart, would answer, ‚ÄúChildren fail not to resemble their parents. Root and branch begin with the mother,‚Äù and scolded herself along with her own mother for good measure.

The truth was more tangled. Six-and-thirty years before, Eli‚Äôs grandmother had fallen for a roaming troupe‚Äôs slow, pendulum-swinging tune and conceived May; later May herself, taken with a man who drifted like a white cloud, conceived Eli. Mother and daughter had both been born to this market-inn. There was no time, nor sense, for blame. If Eli‚Äôs roaming bent came of his mother‚Äôs choosing a man of the road, and if she chose such a man because her own mother had once lost her heart to a troupe, then the root of the boy‚Äôs traveling temper lay with the grandmother. She tried to tame it by setting him to the bell; when the bell failed, May would try the book-trade and see if commerce could spend what church could not. Eli, for his part, was drawn more to tales than to hymns and liked the thought of dealing better than the yard; and so May, having first exacted a promise that he would at least keep the Harpers Ferry market, gave him a stall.

When Eli came up upon the porch ledge, May started upright. ‚ÄúHot as it is, why so late coming down?‚Äù She handed him a towel and a fan.

The stranger who had been reading penny tales aloud to May looked up from the book and met Eli‚Äôs eyes. A tapered face; eyes bright as blossoms, the white and the black set off clean. Eli felt a quick sting in his breast and, suddenly shy, glanced out toward the willows before the house.

A moment later the young woman slipped inside, and May brought out Eli‚Äôs dinner. ‚ÄúShe is the comb-man‚Äôs girl,‚Äù she said, pleased.

‚ÄúA comb-man?‚Äù Eli held the tray but did not lift the spoon, watching his mother‚Äôs face.

‚ÄúHe has gone into the Shenandoah hollows. Says he may cross into Maryland after. Last evening he took the hills. The girl is an only child. He begged to take her along, so I said we would keep her awhile.‚Äù May studied his face as if to read it. ‚ÄúHow long does he mean to stay up there?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf he takes to it, he will push deeper along the Blue Ridge.‚Äù

Then, as if to herself, ‚ÄúShe doth not seem the daughter of such a man, doth she?‚Äù The girl‚Äôs name was Lucy.

Eli lifted his spoon in silence, and pushed the tray away ere he was half done.

Upon the next day, as he sat at his stall, the comb-man‚Äôs daughter came down with his dinner. The inn and the market stood within calling distance, and Meg commonly did the carrying; he felt awkward that a young woman had been sent. But she set the basket down with a smile bright in her blossom-eyes, and her glance ran straight to the food sheds where they sold candy-apples, sorghum sticks, and cut comb.

‚ÄúWhere is Meg?‚Äù Eli, feeling her gladness in his own breast, kept his head averted and asked a little roughly.

‚ÄúThe porch is crowded. May sent me.‚Äù Lucy, who swallowed most of her words, answered in a Shenandoah lilt, her voice clear. Slender waist, wiry limbs, plump backs of the hands, full lips‚Äîthe sound suited the build.

‚ÄúLucy, set Eli‚Äôs wash-water.‚Äù

On the morrow May kept Meg in the kitchen and put all Eli‚Äôs tending upon Lucy‚Äîwash-water, barley coffee, tray, towel. ‚ÄúShe is not dull; she is warm; and there is no meanness in her,‚Äù May said, with a touch of pride. ‚ÄúHer father‚Äîstrange to say‚Äîseems half eager to leave her with me, as though she were to be my foster-girl.‚Äù She paused to read Eli‚Äôs face and went on, ‚ÄúStill, your say matters, so I have only half agreed‚Ä¶ Take her up sometime and show her the Seven Hills overlook.‚Äù It was as though she sought his consent.

Lucy said their place upon the Shenandoah side was a shack at the foot of a ridge, far from town, with scarcely a neighbor.

‚ÄúWhat did they with the house then?‚Äù

‚ÄúLock the door, and that is that,‚Äù May answered for her. ‚ÄúBut I mislike Lucy‚Äôs being out upon the road.‚Äù

It began to appear that Walker truly purposed to leave Lucy with May. May had begged Eli to marry more than once; and though the barmaids sometimes made him trouble, he had never set his heart upon any of them. Now May seemed anxious that Lucy should not give Eli cause to dislike her.

When Eli came up from the dry-goods store below with a pair of new shoes, May grinned and, instead of liquor, dipped him a bowl of hard cider. ‚ÄúToo hot for anything else.‚Äù She was liberal with tastings when she strained a barrel.

‚ÄúLucy, come out. Thou wilt be thirsty‚Äîdrink first.‚Äù May called toward the room. Lucy came out in a neat calico blouse and slender linen skirt, and with those clear eyes looked like a lotus riding the water.

‚ÄúThat was mine, twenty years ago,‚Äù May said, half wistful. ‚ÄúI let the seams out yesterday‚Äîmore room in it than you would think‚Ä¶ Here, drink up. No need to be shy before Eli.‚Äù Lucy took the cup, smiling, and seemed to finish it within.

Eli went first to the willows and wet his new shoes; Lucy followed. He had said he must go up to the bookshop on the hill to collect, and May had answered that Lucy had hankered for days to gather greens and should see the overlook anyway‚Äîso take her. Eli‚Äôs heart beat a little quick. He had grumbled that he knew not one green from another, and May had said, ‚ÄúWho asked thee to pick? Only walk before and show the way,‚Äù and he could argue no more.

From the first Eli left the main road and took the brushy path few used. This was Blue Ridge foothill country; trails were often more notion than path. He had grown up there, yet more than once the thickening tangles lost him.

Look up‚Äîthe ridges pierced the sky. Look down‚Äîunderfoot the hazed green of brush like a sea, white sunlight falling in streams. Summer blackberries instead of mountain grapes; wild grapevines and Virginia creeper veining the trees; pawpaw fruit still green; cherry-red raspberries and mulberries so black that the least touch stained the hands.

Eli walked ahead, beating back the Virginia creeper with a green alder stick. Lucy lagged behind, breaking off tender ramps or stopping for strawberries.

‚ÄúHurry now‚Äîwhat art thou at?‚Äù Eli would halt and scold, and she would drop berries or ramps, press her full lips together, and hop after him. Anon she fell back again.

‚ÄúOh my!‚Äù she cried at last. He turned and saw her skirt caught high upon a snag as she stood upon an oak. Why the oak? A blackberry cane had arched up within reach; the thorns were stout and the slope too steep to climb from below, so she had gone up the oak wrapped with grapevine. She could not free the fabric without letting go the branch that steadied her, and if she loosed it she would fall. The sun poured under her; a gust might lift the petticoat‚ÄîEli tried to keep his eyes aside and reached with his stick.

He tried to pry the cloth free with the sapling cane, but it was too short and kept brushing her ankle and calf.

‚ÄúNo‚Äîpray! I shall fall!‚Äù she cried. Just then a squirrel ran the grapevine, ready to leap upon the very limb she held.

‚ÄúOnly frighten the squirrel off! I am falling this instant!‚Äù

‚ÄúThou rascal‚Ä¶‚Äù Eli climbed to the base of the same tree, freed the snag at last, and flicked the grapevine once where the squirrel had perched. A few doves burst up and away over the briars.

‚ÄúIf only there were a spring,‚Äù Lucy said, wiping her brow with her skirt.

Each turn to a new spine of mountain brought a rougher knob; each lift of the canopy to the bright sky showed another valley matted with grape and blackberry and Virginia creeper. Deeper in, the whip-poor-wills raised a clamor, and now and again a wild turkey‚Äôs call shook the fern-fans.

The sun passed noon and beat down as if a coal had been set upon the head. In the shade, black snails clung and left a pale slime.

The hotter and thirstier they grew, the more they burrowed like animals into the tangles. Strawberries, blackberries, hard little wild peaches‚Äîwhatever the hand found, the mouth found; and whatever reached the mouth melted like frost-water, leaving only a sourness. Now and again the teeth struck green pawpaw or some other unripe fruit, and bitterness spread into the cheeks. Thirstier for it, Lucy heaped a Virginia-creeper leaf with the small peachlike fruit and passed it to Eli. He set the leaf across his palms and bent to it as to a drink. When it was empty, he tossed the leaf aside and leaned back upon a log wrapped round with grape.

She offered a second leaf-plate. He, impatient, poured it in at once, flicked the remnant away, and soon began to snore.

She filled a third with blackberries and wild grapes, but seeing him asleep, ate as he had. ‚ÄúHe sleeps soundly enough,‚Äù she murmured. She tried to lie back but sneezed; her mouth was dry, her belly empty. Suddenly the whip-poor-wills frightened her.

‚ÄúMayhap there is a spring in the thicket,‚Äù she said, shouldering in until she found a pawpaw limb tangled with grape and heavy with green fruit. ‚ÄúWould they were ripe.‚Äù She picked three of the largest and, by habit, bit one at once. A greenish, fishy bitterness filled her mouth. ‚ÄúOh, that is green,‚Äù she said, spitting, and went back to Eli. The sun was already slanting; hunger came with the thirst.

‚ÄúWake. Let us find water.‚Äù She shook his shoulder. He opened his eyes. Flustered, she held the two green fruits to his nose. He sat up, drew her round shoulders and the nape of her neck to him, and their lips met.

On her full lips lay the sweetness of morning‚Äîstrawberries and blackberries and wild peach, the green tang of unripe pawpaw‚Äîand with it the warm scent of earth and crushed grass.

Caw‚Äîcaw‚Äîan old crow swung over their heads.

‚ÄúIs it far to the overlook still?‚Äù she asked at last, lifting down the lunch-bundle from the grapevine.

Walker, who had gone into the Shenandoah hollows, did not return for more than a fortnight. He had said as much when he left; he must have gone deep, May and Lucy thought.

‚ÄúLooks like he will summer in the hills,‚Äù May would say. The two kept to their penny tales. Lucy‚Äôs Shenandoah lilt‚Äîearthy at first‚Äîgrew clearer and more plaintive, like song.

In that time one new thing did come between May and Lucy: May found a tiny birthmark just above the rim of Lucy‚Äôs left ear.

One morning, as May was braiding Lucy‚Äôs hair, her hand trembled as though she would faint.

‚ÄúWhat is it, May?‚Äù Lucy asked, startled. May only stared into her eyes and said nothing.

‚ÄúMay‚Äîwhat is amiss?‚Äù Lucy asked again. May drew a long breath, as one coming back to herself, and said, ‚ÄúIt is nothing,‚Äù and set the comb to work anew. Lucy thought it strange, but could not press May past a ‚Äúnothing.‚Äù

Next day May, hair pinned tight, left early for errands in Charles Town. Eli was napping in the front room. A shower came. Lucy ran in with the wash, crying, ‚ÄúOh no, May will be caught in the rain!‚Äù The fresh wind and damp upon her hem brushed Eli‚Äôs face and woke him; his hand reached and caught her skirt. She turned quick, cradling the wash, and looked at him. Dimples rose in her cheeks, and just then someone moved without.

‚ÄúMay‚Äôs clothes will be soaked!‚Äù she called again and went back to the porch. Eli was snoring anon.

When he woke once more, customers were drinking hard cider upon the porch. From the kitchen Lucy called, ‚ÄúOnly catfish and green peppers for a bite tonight!‚Äù After they had gone, Eli said, a touch peevish, ‚ÄúI told thee, take no customers when May is gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf we let that barrel sit, it will turn by morning. May would be the more cross to waste it, would she not?‚Äù Lucy answered as if to soothe him. A little later she came smiling. ‚ÄúEli, buy me a round hand mirror‚Äîprithee? I have always wished one.‚Äù The morrow was market-day; when she brought his dinner, he handed her the small mirror he had bought ahead, and a bundle of sorghum sticks.

‚ÄúOh my!‚Äù she cried, seeing mirror and candy. She looked in it again and again with blossom-bright eyes, tucked it to her breast, and sat beside him, cracking the candy between her teeth.

He shifted this way and that whenever a shadow crossed the front of the stall, to keep her from notice. Lucy loved sweets. When the candy-man or fruit-seller passed the house, she would spring from her sewing and stand, staring after them till they were gone.

Once Eli came down from the school and found only Lucy upon the porch steps‚ÄîMay nowhere about‚Äîsharing slices of watermelon with a loafer from the inn next door. When she saw Eli, her face flushed, then brightened. ‚ÄúOh‚ÄîEli!‚Äù

He did not look at her, but went straight to his room. She set down the melon and followed with eyes wide.

‚ÄúWhat is it, Eli?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHey‚Äîwhat is amiss?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù

He said nothing. When she set her arms about his shoulders to draw him close, he twisted free like lightning and, all at once, fell upon her and struck her face with his hand. She cried, ‚ÄúEli, Eli!‚Äù and raised her hands at first, looking at him with a painful little frown; then, after two or three loud smacks, she turned to the corner and buried her face, taking the storm without a word.

Upon the next day she brought his dinner to the market with her lips pressed tight and said nothing. In her clear eyes there was neither deep grudge nor hate for what had passed.

That night he saw her alone by the river and followed. The sky was blue with stars, and the willow shade made the bank black.

‚ÄúEli,‚Äù she said when he came near, rising and stepping up until she stood near his chin, speaking low, ‚Äúwhy hast thou been holed at the school all the time?‚Äù The Shenandoah lilt curled in the whisper.

About then he seldom came down unless it was market-day. Since May had come home wet from Charles Town, she seemed to watch them differently; his heart was delicate, and he hated to be disliked, and anger at his mother made him dig in and stay uphill. That night, ere he could answer Lucy, May‚Äôs voice came out of the dark‚Äî‚ÄúLucy! Lucy!‚Äù Eli wrinkled his nose and shut his mouth. ‚ÄúOh, May‚Äîhow hard she is,‚Äù he thought, his throat gone tight. A firefly drifted past. Lucy sat upon a rock and clenched a handful of reeds, murmuring something he could not hear for the water.

At dawn next day Eli poked about the room and kitchen, looked a little disappointed, and went back up to the school. Lucy, as ever, stood at the selfsame bend with the reeds, rinsing rags.

Three days later Eli came down again. Walker sat upon the porch drinking cider; Lucy‚Äîhair braided and dressed in the same calico, washed and ironed, a small bundle at her side‚Äîsat hunched at the edge. When she spied Eli, joy sprang into her blossom-eyes and she started up; in the selfsame instant her full lips tightened with a warning that told what lay between them‚Äîurgent and unhappy.

‚ÄúLucy is leaving now,‚Äù May said the moment she saw Eli.

Later he set the tale aright within himself: Walker had returned that evening‚Äîthe one when Eli had gone back up the hill. He had meant to take Lucy away at once; May pleaded for a day‚Äôs rest, and now they were packed to be gone at first light. But at the first hearing Eli felt as if a lump of iron had struck his skull; the blood drew tight to a point, his ears pricked toward the crown, his tongue curled back into his throat, a blue flash pricked at the corners of his eyes. Dizziness, anger, and hurry ran him from toes to scalp. Only now, at the point of parting, did he know how impossibly bound he was to her. Now, upon the knife-edge of forever, the wick took flame‚Äîeverything unreal as a dream. He might have howled and flung honor and shame aside had he let himself. But he could not show that face to May. He bit his trembling lip and dropped hard upon the porch edge.

‚ÄúFine-looking boy you have raised,‚Äù Walker said‚Äîsurely of Eli. Eli did not turn his head, but sat as a man sits who bears a grudge against the world.

Meanwhile May told how Walker, whilst in the hills, had come upon a young man‚Äîthe son of an old friend from back home‚Äîwho ran a factory there. In the way of meetings, the young man had urged Walker to return to their coastal town and live there, with help to set him up. The thought of home came sudden, and with aid promised, Walker had resolved to go back to the shore. To Eli, with his ears humming from fear and fury, the tale buzzed like a swarm of bees and scarce made sense.

‚ÄúThis cider fills me right up,‚Äù Walker said, finishing his last bowl and taking up fan and cane.

‚ÄúIf you go to the coast, I suppose we shall not see you again,‚Äù May said, standing.

‚ÄúWho knoweth a man‚Äôs road? If there be a turn for it, we will meet again,‚Äù Walker answered, lacing his big boots.

‚ÄúGo well, girl,‚Äù May said, tucking a little flowered purse with money into Lucy‚Äôs small bundle as a token. Lucy stared at May with reddened, pleading eyes. ‚ÄúCome again,‚Äù May said, stroking the gentle, wave-like slope of Lucy‚Äôs shoulders. Lucy buried her face in May‚Äôs breast and wept. ‚ÄúHush now. Thy father waits.‚Äù Even May‚Äôs voice had gone thin.

‚ÄúWell then, keep well,‚Äù Walker said to May.

‚ÄúIf things do not take, come back and live with us,‚Äù May urged once more.

‚ÄúKeep well, Eli,‚Äù Lucy said, hunting Eli‚Äôs last look with eyes bloodshot and bright.

At that Eli sprang from the porch as if waking, stumbled a few steps toward her, and then‚Äîas if some sense seized him‚Äîstiffened like a post and stood staring at her face a great while.

‚ÄúKeep well, Eli.‚Äù Even the second farewell held the same hope in her red eyes, as if some miracle, some word of order would come from him. But Eli, leaning on the willow, had only fire in his gaze, and no word, no wonder came.

‚ÄúKeep well, Eli.‚Äù Leaving the last words in a voice near-broken with tears, Lucy turned. Eli stood staring at the calico blouse, receding in the fair light under drooping willow branches and the mountain-ringing cry of whip-poor-will, and did not move.

He rose again only the following spring, well after Groundhog Day and the first frog-song‚Äîabout cherry-blossom time, with a fine drizzle now and then. The willows out front were thread-green again; cherries and lilacs bloomed bright upon the lanes and foothills.

May came in with a bowl of soup and, seeing he had finished it, asked,

‚ÄúDost thou still wish to try for the western sea?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù Eli turned his head quietly.

‚ÄúWilt thou marry here and live with me?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù He turned away again.

Before spring fully came that year‚Äîwhen most had given up hope of Eli‚Äôs returning to himself‚ÄîMay at last said, ‚ÄúIf thou art set on dying, at least go knowing what lieth in thy mother‚Äôs heart,‚Äù and told him: that the comb-man Walker was, very like, the selfsame roaming fellow who had passed one night at the market six-and-thirty years ago and left a tie to her mother‚ÄîEli‚Äôs grandmother‚Äîand that Lucy, judging by the small mark above her left ear, might be May‚Äôs half-sister. She showed him the same dark speck above her own left ear.

‚ÄúWhen I first heard ‚Äòsix-and-thirty years,‚Äô my heart went cold. I hoped I was wrong. I went so far as to fetch a traveling phrenologist out of Charles Town the next day‚ÄîGod help me‚Äîand he too spoke as though he knew men‚Äôs insides and made a fool of me.‚Äù She ceased. Eli‚Äôs eyes flashed like a lamp as he looked at his mother. ‚ÄúBetter not to know‚Äîsave once thou knowest, thou must set thy conduct right,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThink not hard of thy mother.‚Äù She washed his thin hand with tears. Oddly, that last‚Äîalmost a housekeeping of their souls‚Äîgave him strength. He stared at the ceiling with burning eyes a long while and bit his lip as though fixing a new resolve.

He would not go west to hunt a father. He would not marry and set up a household here. May let go her stubborn hopes.

‚ÄúThen what wilt thou do? Do as seemeth fit.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù He lay back without a word.

A little over a month later, on a market morning early in summer‚Äîgreens coming in from the Shenandoah in place of the others from neighboring hollows‚ÄîEli downed a bowl of hard cider with a plate of tender shoots and said, ‚ÄúMother, have a candy-tray made for me.‚Äù

May stared at him as if struck.

Another fortnight passed. The whip-poor-wills were loud as the hills themselves, and the willows shone with wet light. A light dawn-shower had passed; the day cleared bright. Up at the three-way above the Harpers Ferry market, Eli was taking leave of May. He had changed into a clean white shirt and pants, tied a silk kerchief tight upon his head, and slung the new white wooden tray across his shoulder like a bar. The upper tier was more than half filled with neat sorghum sticks; the lower held a few dime-novels and small notions.

The last few lines are the kicker. I‚Äôll try to keep it factual and straightforward.

About 6 years ago, I hanged out with a friend over coffee, and we brainstormed an idea for an event business in our niche. It was just a casual chat ‚Äì we tossed around concepts, but I was the one who came up with the name and decided to run with it.

I turned that idea into a real, successful business on my own: I handled all the planning, risks, investments, and hard work to build it from the ground up. My friend didn‚Äôt contribute to any of that ‚Äì no funding, no operations, no execution. He‚Äôs not listed on any official business documents, registrations, or even our Facebook page.

That said, he‚Äôs a great guy and a natural talker (an influencer / content creator). He‚Äôs always full of opinions on everyone‚Äôs businesses (not just mine), and sometimes I ask for his advice just to make him feel involved, he likes it a lot. 

Over the years, I‚Äôve hired him as an MC/emcee for some of my events, paying him around P10,000 per gig plus free gadgets from sponsors when available. Recent events, he can no longer be hired. He‚Äôs gotten more famous in our niche lately, which is cool.

Now, as our company prepares for our 7th year of events, he‚Äôs demanding royalties from the business and 50% of all my sponsorship deals, claiming he was there ‚Äúfrom day one‚Äù during that initial concept chat, which is true. 

On top of that, he‚Äôs asking me to pay to sponsor his pocket events because he supported me before.

I appreciate our friendship, but this feels out of line since he never put in the actual effort.

I am planning to ask chatgpt if he has any real right to demand a cut, legally and morally; but i want to post here first. I am considering giving him something to keep the peace, or i don‚Äôt know, maybe stand my ground.

He twice ‚Äúcopied‚Äù another friend‚Äôs business and ‚Äústole‚Äù the sponsors. Don‚Äôt want that to happen to me so i want to keep him kinda involved. Or i don‚Äôt knowww üòÇü§£.

He actually now appears to be way richer and more successful than me (maybe?). I‚Äôm not comparing, just minding my own business. I think he doesn‚Äôt need my pennies.

He wasn‚Äôt a real deep friend anyway, but our familes are also friends. And our world is just so small i don‚Äôt want to burn bridges. ü§™

Just want to get it out of my chest. üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è",0,1755321205.0,OffMyChestPH,1,0.5,False

1mrliq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mrliq4/mil_is_just_exhausting/,MIL is just exhausting,"My MIL moved in a few months ago with my husband and I, our daughter and my 13 year old. I didn‚Äôt know her well before she moved here because she lived several states away and has a hard time traveling. I knew she has several medical issues and also some mental health concerns. I have the ADHD/depression/anxiety combo pack, so I‚Äôm pretty sympathetic. 
She has very poorly managed bipolar disorder and the emotional stability of a matchstick house. 
I work from home and I can be a bit flexible with my work, but she is supposed to be helping out with minding our toddler during the day. Yesterday she had a doctors appointment that didn‚Äôt go well, so ok, no problem. I took toddler to story time so MIL could have time to decompress. MIL mentioned craving a hamburger so I mentioned it to hubby and we had that for dinner instead of what I had planned. 
Today she didn‚Äôt come downstairs until after ten, disappeared for half an hour to ‚Äúget coffee‚Äù and then pretty much ignored my toddler. I got a bit frustrated about it and hubby went upstairs to talk to her and the next thing I know it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so selfish‚Äù and ‚Äúhow dare I‚Äù and ‚Äúshe‚Äôs tired of being treated like this‚Äù and ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt understand what we want when all I do is complain about her and how she doesn‚Äôt do enough‚Äù 
No one ever said to her that she doesn‚Äôt do enough, that has never come out of my mouth or my husbands. In fact, several times we have told her to do LESS because she has back problems and we don‚Äôt want her to re-injure it. I do the majority of the cooking and grocery shopping and I try to make sure that we have food that she likes. 
Hubby shut her down so she changed tactics, the problem isn‚Äôt her, the problem is ‚Äúthe imbalance in your marriage because you don‚Äôt fight you just ignore your problems and blame them on me.‚Äù Which is absolutely untrue. We DO fight, we just don‚Äôt yell, scream, slam doors and act nasty to each other. 
Next she came downstairs for something and hubby and I were laughing about something that one of his coworkers said, and she goes ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you two can just brush it off, my whole day is ruined and I broke my necklace because I was upset.‚Äù Like, I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm not going to let myself be held hostage by your shit. 
Ugh, I‚Äôm just so tired of this nonsense. I got out of an abusive marriage and worked so hard to heal and to create a peaceful home for myself and my kids and I feel like it‚Äôs being wrecked and the emotional whiplash is exhausting. Yesterday I was the best daughter in law and today I‚Äôm horrible and selfish and treat her like shit. ",1,1755321075.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I apologise if I don‚Äôt make sense but I want to let people know about my experience as I‚Äôve been trying to find out, have been reading through this subreddit but can‚Äôt find anything similar to what I went through.

A week ago I started feeling very confused and disoriented whilst cleaning up, doing washing etc.. (I‚Äôd been having terrible headaches, nausea and vomiting for a couple of weeks, which I went to hospital for, however was only given anti nausea meds and sent home).   

My confusion was progressively getting worse, I kept dropping things like my cup of coffee (I had to make a new coffee four times), until I dropped the fourth one, sat down outside on a chair out the backyard, (I‚Äôm in Australia), looked around my surroundings and tried to smoke my pen, thinking it was a cigarette.  I knew something BAD was happening and at that moment my husband came home, took one look at me, asked me a question which I was trying to answer but couldn‚Äôt get the words to come out properly, it sounded like gibberish.
I didn‚Äôt even have a headache, I was just completely confused and lost within myself, frightened and scared because I couldn‚Äôt get my words out.  So he called 000.

The paramedics came, asked me to name simple things.  I knew what they were but language wasn‚Äôt connecting to them.  I started freaking out crying, this was the beginning of my nightmare.
I was getting more and more frustrated/scared at the same time since my words made no sense.  Once I got to hospital I went straight in for a CT scan with contrast, which they confirmed no bleeding in brain, but diagnosed me with RCVS. 
What happened next was what felt like the beginning of the end for me.

I was placed in the resuscitation room, nasogastric tube in, I may have had a seizure as I cannot remember much but felt myself slip in and out of consciousness for I don‚Äôt remember how long.  Next thing I remember I was told I have to lay in decline position so the blood flows to my head, and that I will be given meds to get my BP to go straight up (BP was apparently 85/72), and that I need to prepare to tough it out as I was about to feel the worst headache of my life/TC headache.  I was also told I could not have pain relief in case I became drowsy.

‚ÄòThunder Clap‚Äô headache doesn‚Äôt do what it felt like justice.  I cannot put into words the intensity of this medication induced headache to increase my BP.  If I was to try to describe it, like bombs were exploding within my brain and scull, pressure had nowhere to go, the pain kept ricocheting off my scull.

It got so extreme I ended up screaming out I‚ÄôM DYING, over and over again, felt all alone without anyone as they kicked my husband out early because he thought he lost me. (In his own panic he must have been overwhelmed)

As I was screaming in pain, the Dr came in to say there‚Äôs nothing we can do to stop the pain, you have to tough it out..  At that point I gave up.  
I literally waited for death.

Next thing I remember was being in the stroke ward.

I have been crying every day since I got home.  I cannot understand why I lost my ability to speak coherently, and the memory of what happened in that resuscitation room has me traumatised.

I have a follow up appointment in 2-3 weeks so I will ask questions but for now, can anyone here please relate?  Has anyone had the experience where they lost their ability to communicate their words whilst understanding what was said to them?  And for everyone who experienced the worst headache of their life.. I‚Äôm just so so sorry üòî I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve been through anything remotely similar..

I guess I just need to get this out, I don‚Äôt feel like me anymore.

I have previously posted asking about visiting an IGA or ALDI: https://www.reddit.com/r/perth/s/sl2wYBGaOu

And here are some of the things that I lugged home from Perth. This isn't everything, there's another 6 cans of S&V chips, biscuits, snacks, microwave food., that I brought home. 

And lots of salami sticks too! 

I came here with an empty luggage and flew home with more than 20 kilos of groceries. 

So why would someone fly thousands of kilometres from Southeast Asia to Perth for holiday and fly home with luggage-full of groceries? Well: 

- Coffee capsules are cheap. The capsules at Woolies cost about 45 cents apiece. In Malaysia they cost about 80-90 cents apiece. If I buy from Singapore (where I work), the selection is slightly more but they cost around $1 apiece. 

- Vitamins from Chemist Warehouse / Priceline are also frequented by visitors like us. I work shifts so these Swisse / Nature's Way sleep gummies are great, but they cost a fortune back home. In Singapore you pay twice the amount of money for the same bottle of gummies. 

- Stevia sweetener tablets - they're ridiculously expensive here. If you have visited my country you'll know that we like things sweet and our drinks have shitloads of sugar. I found out that I could carry these tablets with me, order a zero sugar coffee/tea/milo, and plop one in. 

- Rice boxes, they're good. We don't have rice boxes here. 

- Fruit bars - again, they are quite hard to find here. 

The 2nd and 3rd pics are taken at a premium grocer near my home at Malaysia-Singapore border. They always have a shelf-full of Woolies stuff (another competitor grocer carries Coles items). These are the things that people here are willing to pay a premium to buy. 

Funnily, (5th photo), the Woolies chips and S&V chips I bought from Perth are actually made in my country! Unfortunately S&V is not a popular taste here, so the factory that made them do not sell them locally. But my colleagues loved them! It is an unofficial rule in the office that whoever visits anywhere in Australia must return with S&V chips. And yeah, my office of 7 people finished 4 cans in a single 8-hr shift!

Sorry for the rant! This is what how my days start: I sit in the office and stare at the keyboard or my hands for couple of hours. Absolutely empty! I need two cups of coffee just to fire up few neurons in my brain. Watching and following a random youtube video feels like an unbearable effort. This my ""Alt-Ac"" job after Ph.D. and a postdoc (over 7 years combined). This is what happened when I **escaped academia**.

I have been working on this project for a number of years. Since 2020 everything went downhill. Everything went downhill.

I am a project manager. Sort of. I honestly want to support this project. I honestly want to do a good work. I am only a project manager. I do not have a signing authority for purchases. I prepare all documents, then nothing gets done. Because the supervisor, the PI does not do anything. The PI is a ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù hire. All they do is make speeches and collect various awards for no real work. 

Over past three years the only thing that was done was a submission and approval of ethics application for the research project, which could have been done in 6 months of normal work. 99% of the work was done by me. The PI did not write a one paragraph of text for the application. NOT ONE PARAGRAPH IN 3 YEARS. Not one single paragraph in 3 years. 

DOCUMENTS ARE NOT BEING SIGNED. APPLICATIONS / AMENDMENDS ARE NOT SUBMITTED IN TIME BECAUSE THE PI DOES NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING. THERE IS NO GUIDANCE FROM THE PI. NO IDEAS. NOTHING. JUST NOTHING.

After years of this I completely burned out. My productivity is essentially zero at this point. Most of the days I struggle mentally. My head feels like an empty balloon with nothing inside. I do not have any thought. I just sit there empty as a balloon without any thought. I have been thinking about injuring myself to get out of this mental paralysis. I need minimum 1 Liter of coffee in the morning just to keep me going. Just to keep me functional on a basic physiological level. Just to get a pulse. I have lost all interests. I have dropped all hobbies. I cannot watch a single youtube video to the end. I am endlessly and aimlessly browsing. Or listening to some random music. There is nothing. I am empty, my head is completely empty as a balloon. I stopped cleaning in my apartment. My fridge is full of decaying food. I am completely empty. I want to die.

I am a single earner. If I move out of this job, I will be paying 60 % of my salary just for rent. And this IF (IF!!!) I could find a job in current market. I will be leaving paycheck to paycheck, without being able to save anything for retirement. This is what keeps me, this is what forces me to return to the decrepit office room every day.

I have regular health issues now. I do not know what I am supposed to do. I just sit at my office, staring at my hands. People are trashing me, because nothing in the project moves. The project has stalled. I have done everything that I can do within my job description. I cannot do anything more. But the PI is the ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù hire, so everyone is afraid to say anything to them. Instead I am being accused. It goes over and over and over. The PI does not do shit. None of my effort has been rewarded. None of my extra mile efforts, nothing has been rewarded or appreciated. I gave up on my hobbies. I gave up on my interests. Nothing means anything anymore. All I see is that you have to be a right kind of a person and you will be getting awards after awards without lifting a finger. 

There is nothing I can do. Nobody wants to intervene. Nobody wants to deal with the ""political"" PI. Instead people are targeting me. I do not know for long this can continue. This is some form of mental torture. I cannot do anything. I am tired. I am empty.

1mrlaav,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingshaming/comments/1mrlaav/a_guest_yelled_at_and_threatened_the_pregnant/,A guest yelled at and threatened the PREGNANT photographer at a wedding,"I‚Äôm a wedding coordinator, and for the most part I haven‚Äôt had too many bad guest stories. However, a few months back I worked a wedding where a guest got into a HUGE argument with the photographers in the middle of the reception, and I‚Äôm still cringing over it.

Basically what happened is that the couple (my clients) had booked a husband and wife photography team like a year out from their wedding. This is obviously pretty standard, because good photographers book up pretty early and your photographer is usually one of the first vendors you book.

A couple of months later, the photography team contacted the clients and informed them that the wife was pregnant. The timing worked out so that she would be about eight months long by the time their wedding rolled around, so they assured the clients that they would still be able to shoot their wedding unless something completely unexpected happened like an early delivery.

When the day of the wedding arrived, the photographers showed up on time, they were super friendly and very professional for the entire event, and I honestly had a great time working with them. The problem came at dinner. I typically tell vendors to take their dinner break while the couple is eating, because there‚Äôs not really anything going on that needs to be photographed while the bride and groom are sitting at their table.

Apparently, one of the guests who was a longtime family friend did not agree with this. She noticed the photographers sitting outside and having their meal (they were literally sitting down for MAYBE 15 minutes), and became upset when she noticed that the EXTREMELY PREGNANT photographer had propped her feet up on the base of the outdoor coffee table. Keep in mind, this was in the outside area - all the guests were inside, and the only people around were a couple of other vendors who were taking a short break to eat.

My understanding is that this particular guest was so upset with the photographers that she walked outside, pointed her phone at them, and snapped a photo. Then she walked back inside without another word. This obviously was concerning to the photographers, so the husband of the team followed her inside and asked her why she had taken a picture of his wife. She replied that she ‚Äúwanted to have a photo attached‚Äù to the review that was going to leave on all of their social media platforms.

The husband became immediately furious, and it was at this point that I looked over and saw that they were having a very tense interaction so I walked over to see what was going on. The photographer informed me about the woman‚Äôs behavior and her threats to leave a negative review, and then the guest in question tried to justify her behavior by saying that the photographers should have been inside taking pictures of people enjoying the food instead of outside with their feet propped up.

I explained to her that they were taking their scheduled dinner break, and that I had instructed them to do so, and that I had discussed the timing of dinner breaks with my clients well before the event. She wouldn‚Äôt hear it. She said that vendors should not be eating somewhere visible because it made them look unprofessional and gave the impression that they didn‚Äôt care about their job. She was also upset because the wife of the team had worn a loose fitting, flowy T-shirt dress and sneakers when she felt that she should‚Äôve been dressed in more formal attire. Again, I tried to explain that photographers wear appropriate but COMFORTABLE clothing because they‚Äôre moving around a lot and need to be able to squat, crouch, bend, etc.

Thankfully the mother of the bride noticed the argument and walked over to convince her friend to calm down, and we were able to diffuse the situation. The mother of the bride also reassured the photographers that they had done nothing wrong and that she was very grateful for their help, so I was grateful that the MOB had my back. I was also very grateful that dinner was so noisy that most of the guests did not notice, and I don‚Äôt think my clients even found out what had happened until the next day.

What was especially frustrating to me is that this wedding guest had spent most of the morning explaining to me that she and her husband used to own a wedding venue - so for her to behave that way and act like it was a huge shock to her that vendors would need a dinner break was wild. She even made a comment implying that if the wife was pregnant, she shouldn‚Äôt have taken the job. Any experienced venue owner would know that wedding photographers book up months or even a year plus in advance, and that they typically honor their contracts even through pregnancy. It was like she thought that the photographers had booked these clients a week beforehand.

I even might‚Äôve understood her point if the photographers had been lazy or late or not doing their job well, but they weren‚Äôt. They were on time, they were active and aware of the schedule, and I didn‚Äôt have a single problem with them the entire night.

1. Safety reasons - if I dont sleep well the night before, Im feeling tipsy or drunk the following day. I dont drive and just sleep on the bus comfortably if I want to

1mrl6n6,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1mrl6n6/bf_is_having_trouble_with_college_and_family/,Bf is having trouble with college and family,"So, my bf (M22) has been going to a technical college to do the culinary program. He‚Äôs been in the program for 4 years, but it‚Äôs a 2 year college. He‚Äôs paying for his college by himself, and also pays rent at home, and he has a job. 

My bf only has 1 culinary class left and some other classes like core, and classes related to culinary but not hands on. My bf has dropped his last hands on culinary class 3-4 times already because he doesn‚Äôt drive, so the schedule for the class didn‚Äôt line up with his parent‚Äôs schedule or it just didn‚Äôt work for his schedule in general. 

This semester starts on Monday (August 20th). My bf was planning on registering for his last hands in class (the one he dropped multiple times), but then found out he has a hold on his account. He‚Äôs emailed the financial office 3 times on different days, and still got no response back. He emailed in the middle of the week (Tuesday-Wednesday). I‚Äôve mentioned him going to the school on person to have it figured out, but today was his last day and he wasn‚Äôt able to because he had work at 10 AM and was worried he would be late if he did go to the school. 

The issue is, his dad asked him when he was going to be done with school, and I guess that led to the his dad finding out that my bf still wasn‚Äôt going full time school. My bf had told him a while back that he wasn‚Äôt doing full time, but it got mentioned again recently. So when his dad found out, he basically was like ‚ÄúWell why the hell aren‚Äôt you doing full time?‚Äù And my bf tried to explain to him that he couldn‚Äôt afford to do full time school because 12 credit hours would be about $1,800 which is basically my bfs entire paycheck from work, plus he pays $250 for rent each week that he gets paid (bi weekly). He‚Äôs never missed a rent pay date. 

His dad just wasn‚Äôt hearing it and told him either he‚Äôs gonna do full time school or he‚Äôs gonna have to figure something else out (basically telling my bf to do full time or to leave and live somewhere else). I then found out that his dad has said something about school all this week and it‚Äôs always turned into a bigger issue, which is making my bf super stressed out. 

My bf was already planning on finding an apartment because of his dads blowouts and how they are getting to be too much, but now my bf is saying he‚Äôs gonna try to find a place and move out in a month or less. His whole reason is because his dad has really high expectations (he expected my bf to get into Massachusetts institute of technology when he was in highschool), and because of his blowouts, and said that this has been building for a long time. His plan is to basically look for places and hopefully have everything figured out before his dad kicks him out (my bf thinks he will get kicked out if he‚Äôs not doing full time or doesn‚Äôt register for this class). He‚Äôs even said that getting an apartment at this rate would be cheaper than finishing school, basically saying he‚Äôs gonna get an apartment and drop out of college. He‚Äôs even talking about finding a better paying job because he‚Äôs worked at his current one for 2 years and does everything for them, and still hasn‚Äôt gotten promoted because of his schedule being part time. 

He has friends in culinary that have way more experience than him and tells him that a culinary degree won‚Äôt get you as far as having experience would, and how a culinary degree is pretty much useless. So he‚Äôs thinking about dropping out. 

As of now he‚Äôs saying that he‚Äôs ready to buy crates and pack all of his stuff and leave as soon as possible and how he‚Äôs not even planning on talking to his dad, he‚Äôs even started trying to stall so he doesn‚Äôt have to go home until his dad falls asleep because he doesn‚Äôt want to go home and have another argument etc if his dad is awake. 

He‚Äôs just been really stressed out about the whole thing. He‚Äôs even started having heart palpitations and has been shaking a lot more and a lot worse (this happened in the past but wasn‚Äôt as bad). He‚Äôs even said that he thinks he‚Äôs thinning from the stress (losing hair). 

I want to help but I am not sure how. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs really anything I can do though. I don‚Äôt want him to drop out, but at the same time it‚Äôs not my choice and if he thinks that would be easier, it‚Äôs not like I have much say in it. 

I did tell my dad the situation and asked him if he had any apartment recommendations or anything, but he never replied, so I told him in person and all he said was that finding a place near his work (preferably where my bf wants to live so that he has an easier transportation option) would be really expensive because it‚Äôs downtown, then said that a family member was paying like $1,200 a month on a trailer alone not including utilities‚Ä¶then went on to say my bf probably should‚Äôve prioritized school and not $5-$6 coffee (he gets coffee on his work break) and then said that my bf seemed to be managing all of this before I came along (his transportation and things‚Ä¶basically saying how my bf is taking advantage of me because I pick him up and take him home when we hangout).

1mrl6ik,https://youtu.be/c_eaTEV8FF8,4 Very Scary TRUE Summer Music Festival Horror Stories,"# ""Twenty-One Lost"":

I headed to the Love Parade in Duisburg that July with my friends Lisa and David. We had talked about it for months, excited for the music and the energy of the crowd. Lisa drove us there, and we parked far away, walking through groups of people already buzzing with anticipation. ""This is going to be epic,"" David said, grinning as he adjusted his backpack. ""The best festival yet.""

We arrived around midday, and the entrance area was packed. A long tunnel led to the main grounds, and police directed everyone that way. At first, it felt fine, just a lot of bodies moving together. Lisa grabbed my hand. ""Stay close, Emma,"" she said. ""It's getting tight."" I nodded, feeling the press of strangers against my sides.

As we entered the tunnel, the light dimmed, and the air grew thick with sweat and excitement. Music thumped in the distance, pulling us forward. But soon, the movement slowed. People in front stopped, and those behind kept pushing. ""Why are we stopping?"" I asked David, who was right behind me. He craned his neck. ""Maybe they're checking tickets up ahead. Just hang on.""

The crowd swelled. Shoulders jammed into my back, and I had to brace my feet to stay upright. Whispers turned to complaints. A guy next to us muttered, ""This setup is awful. Too many people for one entrance."" Lisa squeezed my hand harder. ""Emma, I don't like this. It's too squished."" I tried to turn, but there was no space. The walls of the tunnel closed in, concrete cold against my arm when I leaned.

Minutes passed, and the pushing grew stronger. Someone shouted from behind, ""Move forward! Let us through!"" But nothing budged. I felt a wave ripple through the bodies, like a surge from the back. My chest compressed, making each breath shorter. ""David, can you see anything?"" I called out, my voice higher than usual. He replied, ""No, but hold on. It has to clear soon.""

Then, the first scream echoed. Not excitement‚Äîreal fear. A woman ahead yelled, ""Help! I can't breathe!"" The crowd lurched, and I stumbled, Lisa's hand slipping from mine. ""Lisa!"" I gasped, reaching out. She grabbed my wrist again. ""I'm here. Don't let go.""

The pressure built like a vice. Feet tangled with mine, and I lifted onto my toes to avoid falling. Bodies crushed closer, ribs aching from the squeeze. A man beside me panted, ""This is bad. We need to get out."" But there was no way back‚Äîthe tunnel was a solid wall of people.

Panic spread. More screams filled the air. ""Push back! Stop pushing!"" someone begged. I saw a girl in front of me slump, her eyes wide, mouth open in a silent gasp. She dropped, and the crowd flowed over her. ""Oh no,"" Lisa whispered. ""Did you see that? We have to help."" But we couldn't move. My lungs burned, each inhale a fight against the weight on my chest.

David shouted, ""Emma, Lisa, stay up! Don't fall!"" His voice cracked with worry. The surge came again, harder. I felt myself lifted off the ground, carried by the mass. Faces around me turned red, then pale. A young guy nearby clawed at the air, wheezing, ""Air... I need air."" His eyes met mine, pleading, before he sank down.

The tunnel reeked of fear‚Äîsweat, urine, desperation. Bodies piled at the edges, limbs twisted unnaturally. I spotted blue-tinged skin on a woman pressed against the wall, her head lolling. ""She's not moving,"" I said to Lisa, my words barely audible over the cries. ""None of them are."" Lisa sobbed, ""Emma, what if we don't make it? I can't feel my legs.""

I wanted to comfort her, but terror gripped me. The crowd heaved, and I slammed into the concrete, scraping my arm raw. Pain shot through, but worse was the suffocation‚Äîthe invisible hands squeezing my throat. ""Fight it,"" David urged from behind. ""We're almost at the ramp."" But the ramp ahead was worse: a bottleneck where people climbed over each other, hands grasping at poles and barriers.

Screams multiplied. ""My God, they're dead!"" a voice wailed. I glimpsed a heap‚Äîarms and legs entangled, faces frozen in agony. A man tried to pull someone free, yelling, ""Wake up! Come on!"" But the body stayed limp. My vision blurred from lack of oxygen, spots dancing in the dim light.

In that moment, I thought of home, of simple things like walking alone without this nightmare. ""Lisa, promise we'll stick together,"" I rasped. She nodded weakly. ""Always.""

Another wave hit, and we were shoved toward the side. A gap opened near a staircase‚Äîpeople had climbed it, creating a tiny space. David pushed us that way. ""Go! Climb!"" he ordered. I grabbed the edge, hoisting myself up with shaking arms. Lisa followed, then David. We scrambled over, tumbling onto higher ground where the crowd thinned.

Fresh air hit my face, and I gulped it down, coughing. But behind us, the chaos continued‚Äîmoans and pleas echoing from the tunnel. Paramedics rushed past, but too late for many. We staggered away, clinging to each other, as sirens wailed in the distance.

That day changed everything. The music played on somewhere, but for us, the festival ended in horror. We learned later that twenty-one people didn't make it out, crushed in that tunnel. I still hear the screams in quiet moments, feel the press of bodies in crowded places. Lisa and David and I survived, but the fear lingers, a shadow that never fully fades.





# ""The Punch at Parklife"":

I had been planning this trip to the Parklife Festival for weeks with my boyfriend, Robert. We both loved music, and that year the lineup included some of our favorites. Robert was always the one who got me into these big events‚Äîhe had this easy way of making everything fun. We drove up to Manchester early that morning, parked the car far from the entrance, and walked in with our bags full of water bottles and snacks. The crowds were already building, people in bright clothes laughing and chatting as we made our way to the main stage area.

We met up with a couple of friends, Lisa and Tom, who we knew from work. ""This is going to be epic,"" Lisa said as we spread out a blanket on the grass. ""Snoop Dogg later? Can't wait."" Robert grinned and handed me a drink from the cooler. ""Yeah, but first let's catch the earlier acts. Don't want to miss anything."" We spent the afternoon moving between stages, dancing to the beats, sharing stories about past concerts. Robert kept checking on me, making sure I was okay in the heat and the push of bodies. He was thoughtful like that.

As evening came, the energy shifted. The main acts were starting, and we pushed closer to the stage for Snoop Dogg. The crowd was thick, everyone pressed together, arms waving. Robert had his arm around my waist, pulling me close. ""Stay near me,"" he whispered. ""It can get rough in here."" I nodded, feeling the bass thump through my chest. Lights flashed, and the music started loud, everyone cheering.

Then something silly happened at first. An inflatable doll‚Äî one of those big, goofy things people bring to festivals‚Äîcame flying through the air. It bounced off a few heads and smacked right into me, hard enough to sting. I rubbed my head, annoyed but trying to laugh it off. ""What was that?"" I said to Robert. He turned, saw me wincing, and looked around. ""Hey, watch it!"" he called out to no one in particular. But then a guy nearby got upset, like Robert was blaming him. He was tall, maybe six feet, mixed race, in his late twenties, wearing a dark shirt. His face twisted, and he stepped closer. ""What did you say?"" the guy shouted over the music.

Robert held up his hands. ""Just be careful with that thing, man. It hit her."" The guy didn't back down. He pushed forward, chest out. ""You got a problem?"" Lisa grabbed my arm. ""Let's move back,"" she said quietly. But Robert stayed put, trying to calm it. ""No problem, just chill."" The words escalated fast. The guy yelled something I couldn't hear fully over the crowd, and Robert responded, ""Come on, we're all here to have fun."" Tom tried to step in. ""Hey, ease up, guys.""

It happened in a blink. The guy swung his fist, connecting hard with Robert's head. Robert staggered back, eyes wide, and collapsed to the ground. The crowd parted a little, people gasping. I dropped to my knees beside him. ""Robert! Oh no, Robert, get up!"" He wasn't moving, his body limp on the dirt. Blood trickled from his mouth. Panic rose in me as I shook his shoulder. ""Help! Someone help!"" Lisa screamed for security, while Tom chased after the guy, but the crowd swallowed him up. The music kept playing, loud and oblivious.

Medics arrived after what felt like minutes, pushing through. They checked Robert's pulse, shone a light in his eyes. ""He's breathing, but we need to get him out,"" one said. They lifted him onto a stretcher, and I followed, holding his hand. ""I'm right here,"" I whispered. ""You're going to be fine."" At the medical tent, they said he had a head injury, possible bleeding inside. An ambulance took us to the hospital. Doctors rushed him in for scans. ""Wait here,"" a nurse told me. Lisa and Tom showed up soon after, faces pale. ""Did they catch the guy?"" I asked. Tom shook his head. ""He vanished. Police are looking, but with that many people...""

Hours passed in the waiting room. I paced, replaying the moment in my head. Why did it turn so violent over nothing? Robert was just protecting me. A doctor finally came out. ""He's stable for now, but the blow caused swelling in his brain. We're monitoring."" I went in to see him, tubes everywhere, machines beeping. He looked so small in the bed. ""Hey, love,"" I said, squeezing his fingers. No response. Over the next days, I sat by his side, talking about our plans, the house we wanted to buy. Friends visited, bringing flowers. Police came too, asking questions. ""Describe the attacker again,"" an officer said. I did‚Äîtall, mixed race, short hair, maybe a gold chain. They showed sketches, but nothing stuck.

On the fourth day, things got worse. Alarms went off, doctors rushed in. ""His pressure's spiking,"" one yelled. They tried everything, but his body gave out. The doctor pulled me aside. ""I'm sorry. We couldn't save him."" I collapsed into a chair, sobs choking me. Lisa held me. ""This can't be real."" The police promised to keep searching, but the festival was over, crowds gone. Witnesses gave vague descriptions‚Äîtoo dark, too chaotic.

Back home, the emptiness hit hard. Robert's things everywhere‚Äîhis jacket on the chair, tickets from the festival on the table. Nights were the worst. I'd lie awake, hearing noises outside, wondering if the killer knew who we were. Police said he might have fled the area, but what if he hadn't? What if he saw the news, knew Robert died, and decided to tie up loose ends? One evening, the phone rang late. Unknown number. I answered, voice shaky. ""Hello?"" Silence, then heavy breathing. ""Who is this?"" Click. Probably a prank, but it shook me.

Weeks turned to months. Police released more images, appeals on TV. ""If you recognize this man..."" But no arrests. I moved apartments, installed extra locks. Friends checked in. ""You okay?"" Tom asked over coffee. ""Not really. I keep thinking he's out there, living normal, while Robert's gone."" Lisa nodded. ""It's unfair. But they'll find him."" I wanted to believe that.

Even now, years later, I avoid crowds, festivals. The memory lingers‚Äîthe punch, the fall, the escape into the night. Somewhere, that man walks free, maybe at another event, temper ready to snap again. It terrifies me to think what else he might do.





# ""Electric Forest"":

I had been planning this trip to the Electric Forest festival for what felt like forever. My boyfriend David and I saved up for tickets, and we convinced our close friends Anna and Ben to join us. We drove up to Rothbury in Michigan, set up our campsite in the middle of all those trees, and dove right into the music and lights. The beats from the stages pulsed through the air, and crowds moved like waves under the colorful lasers. David was in a great mood at first, dancing with me during the sets, his arm around my waist as we laughed about nothing important.

On the second night, things turned bad fast. We were back at the tent after a long day, and David started picking at me over small stuff. ""Why do you always flirt with Ben like that?"" he snapped, his voice low but sharp. I rolled my eyes. ""David, you're being ridiculous. Ben's just a friend, and Anna's right there."" He shook his head, grabbed his jacket, and muttered, ""I need some space. Don't wait up."" He walked off toward the edge of the campsite, into the darker parts where the trees swallowed the festival glow. I called after him, ""Come on, don't do this now!"" But he didn't turn back.

Anna came over from her spot by the fire pit. ""What was that about?"" she asked, handing me a bottle of water. ""Just David being jealous again,"" I said, trying to sound casual. Ben joined us, rubbing his hands together. ""He'll cool off. These festivals get to people sometimes with all the noise and crowds."" We sat for a bit, listening to distant bass thumps, but as minutes stretched into an hour, worry crept in. ""Maybe we should go look for him,"" I suggested. Anna nodded. ""Yeah, let's split up a little. Ben, you check the main stage area. Emily and I will head toward the woods path.""

The festival grounds were massive, with paths winding through dense trees lit by string lights and glow sticks. Anna and I walked along one trail, calling David's name softly at first, then louder. ""David! Where are you?"" No answer. The music faded behind us, replaced by rustles in the underbrush. I shone my phone flashlight around, catching glimpses of branches and leaves. ""This place is bigger than I thought,"" Anna whispered. ""People get lost here all the time, right?"" I agreed, but something felt off. We passed a group of strangers sitting in a circle, their faces pale under headlamps, murmuring to each other. One guy looked up, his eyes lingering on us too long. ""You girls okay?"" he asked, his smile not reaching his eyes. ""Yeah, just looking for my boyfriend,"" I replied, pulling Anna along quicker.

Deeper in, the path narrowed. My phone buzzed once‚Äîa text from Ben: ""No sign at the stages. Heading your way."" I texted back our location. Then, a snap echoed from the bushes, like a branch breaking under weight. Anna grabbed my arm. ""What was that?"" We stopped, listening. Another rustle, closer. ""David? Is that you?"" I called. Silence, then a low murmur, like someone whispering words I couldn't make out. My skin prickled. We kept moving, but now every shadow seemed to shift. I spotted something on the ground‚Äîa wallet, half-buried in dirt. I picked it up, heart racing. It was David's, with his ID inside. ""Anna, this is his. He must have dropped it."" She peered over. ""Why would he come this far? And alone?""

We pushed on, the trees closing in tighter. The festival sounds were faint now, like echoes from another world. ""Let's turn back and get help,"" Anna said, her voice shaky. But I couldn't. ""Just a little more."" Then, footsteps behind us‚Äîslow, deliberate. We spun around, but no one was there. ""Who's following us?"" I hissed. Anna's eyes widened. ""Run back to the path."" We started jogging, branches scraping our arms. The footsteps picked up pace, crunching leaves. I glanced over my shoulder and saw a figure in the dim light, tall and hooded, weaving through the trees. ""Faster!"" I urged.

We burst back onto a wider trail, panting, and collided with Ben. ""Whoa, what's wrong?"" he asked, steadying us. ""Someone's out there,"" Anna gasped. ""And we found David's wallet."" Ben's face hardened. ""We need to tell security."" We hurried to the festival's info tent, where a guard took notes. ""People wander off sometimes,"" he said calmly. ""We'll send a team to look."" But his words didn't help. We spent the rest of the night searching with flashlights, calling David's name until our throats hurt. Groups of festival-goers joined in at first, but as hours passed, they drifted away. ""He'll turn up,"" one girl said to me. ""Happens every year.""

By morning, police arrived. They questioned us about the argument, the wallet, the figure we saw. ""Any enemies? Drugs involved?"" an officer asked. I shook my head. ""No, David wasn't like that. He just needed space."" They combed the woods, but found nothing else‚Äîno jacket, no phone, no sign. Days blurred into a nightmare of flyers, interviews, and waiting by my phone. Anna and Ben stayed with me, but the fear lingered. What if that hooded figure had something to do with it? Or had David stumbled into something worse in those trees?

Weeks turned to months, then years. I replayed that night endlessly‚Äîthe argument, the rustles, the footsteps. Police said no foul play, but I knew better. Someone or something took him. Then, six years later, hunters found bones just a hundred yards from our old campsite. Dental records confirmed it was David. His clothes nearby, phone dead in the dirt. Cause unknown. But I remember those whispers in the woods, that figure watching. The festival hides secrets in its shadows, and David walked right into one.





# ""Burning Chaos:"":

I had just turned 20 that summer, and my best friend Emma convinced me to join her and our buddy Lucas for Woodstock '99. We piled into Lucas's old van and drove up to Rome, New York, buzzing with talk about the bands. Korn, Limp Bizkit, Red Hot Chili Peppers ‚Äì it felt like the event of a lifetime. We arrived early on Friday, set up our tent in the massive camping area, and headed straight to the stages. The place was packed with people, everyone pushing to get close to the music.

Emma grabbed my hand as we wove through the crowd for the first set. ""This is going to be epic,"" she said, her voice loud over the distant bass. Lucas nodded, grinning. ""Stick together, okay? It's getting thick in here."" We found a spot not too far from the east stage, bodies all around us swaying to the opening acts. At first, it was fun ‚Äì singing along, jumping with the beat. But as the day wore on, things started to shift. The sun beat down hard, and water cost a fortune at the vendors. People grumbled about it, and the lines for the porta-potties stretched forever. Some guys nearby started shoving each other, laughing it off like a game.

By evening, during Korn's performance, the energy turned rough. The mosh pit formed fast, a swirling mass of arms and legs. We stayed on the edge, but the crowd surged, pressing us in. I felt a hand brush my side, then another on my back. I thought it was just the push of bodies at first. ""Hey, watch it,"" I yelled, turning to see a group of men behind me, their faces sweaty and blank. One of them smirked. ""Relax, babe. It's a festival."" Emma noticed my face and pulled me closer. ""You okay?"" she asked. I nodded, but a knot formed in my gut.

Lucas tried to shield us, his arms out like a barrier. ""Let's move back a bit,"" he suggested. But the crowd wouldn't let us. More hands came ‚Äì deliberate now, grabbing at my shirt, my waist. I slapped one away, but another replaced it. A man pressed against me from behind, his breath hot on my neck. ""You're cute,"" he whispered, his fingers digging into my hip. Panic rose sharp inside me. I elbowed him hard and spun around, but he melted into the sea of faces. Emma's eyes went wide. ""What happened?"" she shouted over the music. ""Some creep just grabbed me,"" I replied, my voice shaking. Lucas scanned the area. ""We need to get out of here.""

We pushed toward the side, but the pit pulled us deeper. Screams mixed with the guitars ‚Äì not just cheers, but cries. I saw a girl nearby, crowd-surfing, her top ripped off as hands mauled her. She flailed, trying to get down, but the men below laughed and held her up. ""Help her!"" I yelled to Lucas, but he couldn't reach. Emma clutched my arm. ""This is bad. Really bad."" The music pounded on, Jonathan Davis screaming lyrics that fueled the frenzy. Another hand shot out, yanking at my shorts. I kicked backward, connecting with something solid. A curse followed, but I didn't look back.

We finally broke free to a less crowded spot, breathing heavy. ""That was insane,"" Lucas said, wiping sweat from his forehead. ""Those guys are animals."" Emma nodded, her face pale. ""I felt it too ‚Äì someone pinched me hard."" We decided to head back to the tent, skipping the rest of the night. But on the way, we passed the overflowing trash piles and stinking toilets. Groups of men roamed, catcalling women who walked alone. One pack blocked our path, eyeing us up. ""Where you ladies going?"" the tallest one asked, stepping close. Lucas put himself in front. ""Just to camp. Move aside."" They laughed, but let us pass after a tense stare-down.

That night in the tent, sleep didn't come easy. Shouts echoed from all directions, and fireworks popped like gunshots. Emma whispered to me in the dark. ""I don't like this place anymore. Something feels wrong."" I agreed, lying there listening to the chaos outside. Morning brought more heat and complaints. Water lines were endless, and rumors spread about fights breaking out. We stuck to the smaller acts during the day, avoiding the main pits. But by afternoon, during Limp Bizkit, we couldn't resist getting closer. Fred Durst hyped the crowd, yelling about breaking stuff. The energy exploded ‚Äì people tearing at plywood barriers, slamming into each other.

We stayed back this time, but the surge came anyway. Bodies crushed against me, and suddenly hands were everywhere again. One slid under my shirt, rough and insistent. I screamed, twisting away, but the man held on, his other arm wrapping around my waist. ""Come on, don't fight it,"" he growled in my ear. Terror flooded me ‚Äì his grip like iron, the crowd hiding everything. Emma saw and lunged forward. ""Get off her!"" she shouted, clawing at his arm. Lucas punched him square in the side, making him loosen just enough. I broke free, gasping, and we ran, shoving through the mass.

But he followed. I glanced back and saw him ‚Äì tall, with a shaved head and a tattoo on his neck ‚Äì pushing after us, his eyes locked on mine. ""He's coming,"" I gasped to Emma. Lucas turned. ""Keep going. I'll slow him."" We darted between groups, the music drowning our calls for help. The man caught up near the edge, grabbing my wrist. ""You think you can hit me and run?"" he snarled. Emma kicked his shin hard, and Lucas tackled him to the ground. A scuffle broke out, fists flying. Security finally appeared, pulling them apart, but the man vanished into the crowd before they could hold him.

We made it to medical tents, where nurses bandaged Lucas's split lip. ""You're not the first tonight,"" one nurse said quietly. ""Girls coming in hurt, saying men attacked them in the pits."" Emma teared up. ""Why is this happening?"" The nurse shook her head. ""Too many angry people, not enough control."" We heard stories there ‚Äì a woman dragged into a porta-potty and assaulted, another gang-attacked during the surf. My skin crawled thinking how close I'd come.

As night fell, things worsened. During Red Hot Chili Peppers, fires started ‚Äì bonfires from trash, then bigger ones torching vendor booths. Smoke filled the air, and riots erupted. People looted ATMs, flipped cars. We huddled in our tent, hearing screams and crashes. ""We have to leave now,"" Lucas urged. Emma agreed. ""Before it gets to us."" We packed fast, sneaking to the van amid the mayhem. Flames lit the sky as we drove out, police sirens wailing in the distance.

Looking back, that weekend stole something from me ‚Äì the joy of music, the trust in crowds. Emma and I still talk about it sometimes, how one man's face haunts our dreams. Lucas says we were lucky to escape whole. But the fear stays, a reminder of how quick fun turns dark.",1,1755320052.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

1mrl3fu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mrl3fu/aitah_bridesmaid/,AITAH Bridesmaid?,"This is going to be a long post but I need to share and get some other insight. I get married this November and 3 weeks ago my best friend since high school (let‚Äôs call her Jill) texted me and said she would not be in my wedding and I would not be in hers. She said this was because she did not feel I was not supportive of her on her joint bachelor/ette trip with her fianc√©.

I got engaged July of 2024 to my fianc√© after being together for 4 years. We had just gotten back from a girls trip with our other friend (we will call her Anna) in Nashville where we had been talking about getting engaged and dream weddings. Jill felt she‚Äôd get engaged in October and I truly had no idea if it would even happen before the end of the year. My fianc√© had talked about engagement and that being the goal for our relationship but didn‚Äôt have anything set in stone. Well fast forward to the day after we get back and it turns out my fianc√© took the girls trip opportunity to set everything up and surprised me that evening. I FaceTimed Jill to tell her and she genuinely seemed so happy for me. One month later she gets engaged to her fianc√© and instantly started wedding planning because she wanted to get married in September of 2025, but ultimately it was better for them to wait for May of 2026. She asked me to be her bridesmaid and my fianc√© to officiate the wedding.

October 2024 Anna hosts a housewarming party and has us over. It‚Äôs just the three of us and Jill starts telling us everything that‚Äôs been bothering her about her fianc√©. She complained about his size, how he never pleasures her, she didn‚Äôt like the proposal, he‚Äôs immature, he‚Äôs not very clean, he‚Äôs around her too much and always home, etc. These continue to be concerns she brings up through the next several months.

January 2025 my fianc√© and I (truly more me) wanted to try to do a joint before the wedding celebration rather than traditional bachelor, bachelorette. We are each others best friends and want to celebrate our marriage together with all of our friends. We thought Lake Geneva was best location wise for everyone but while planning, Memorial Day weekend was the only available time for everyone. Places were going quickly with the high demand weekend and we were trying to keep it around $150 a person for 3 nights. We would also be allowing our wedding party to bring their plus ones meaning Jill could bring her fianc√©. Jill told me privately ‚Äúthings are very tight and this trip is a little out of our price range, but we can make it work.‚Äù She was not the only one that expressed this either, so we decided to have our out of town wedding party stay with us and we did an ‚ÄúI do BBQ‚Äù instead. 

February of 2025, Jill reaches out to Anna and I and wants to have a joint Bachelor/Bachelorette with her fiance in the Smokey Mountains for 2 nights then go to Nashville for 2 nights in July of 2025 (she‚Äôs getting married May 2026). It would be $186 for the Smokey Mountain Airbnb per person and Anna and I were allowed to bring our significant others. I told her I‚Äôd talk it over with my fianc√© and would get back to her. I felt it was a lot of money but my fianc√© said let‚Äôs at least go to the Smokey Mountains and be supportive because she was going to do the same for us. She said she would miss us in Nashville but understood. 

We have a few more girls nights, dinners, etc. before Tennessee. Jill still takes these opportunities to talk about how she wishes her fianc√© would work to be more intimate with her, be more affectionate, be more mature, care more about his appearances, etc. All while he is working 2 jobs to pay for her wedding and credit card debt. She and Anna convince my fiance and I that Nashville too could be fun and we decide to go.

A little over a week before Tennessee we do a little bachelorette for me in Chicago (we live 40 minutes outside the city). We did a broadway show, the Shedd, hotel sleepover, only 2 nights. It was a lot of fun and inexpensive. The last night though she burst into tears because she was so upset about her fianc√© not being affectionate and was quiet and ready to cry the whole rest of the trip. She said she talked with him and they were all good.

The first night in Tennessee we play ‚Äúdrink if‚Äù and Jill asks my fianc√© to be the reader. He asks her multiple times if she‚Äôs comfortable with him asking the group anything especially because her brother was on the trip as her fianc√©‚Äôs groomsmen. She says yes. One of the cards was ‚Äúdrink if you ever had a three some‚Äù. My fianc√© read it and she took a drink. 
Her fianc√© did not know this about her so that was an issue. This was the only big thing that really happened on the trip that I could think of for why she would be mad at me.

The same day I got the text from her about the wedding I got coffee with Anna to debrief the trip and see if there was anything I was missing. One of the things to note about this trip was that it was a massive heat wave, the worst in Tennessee in 3 years but no one could have predicted that prior to going. I don‚Äôt do well in heat and definitely don‚Äôt do well with alcohol, I‚Äôm a huge light weight. And to top it off I have an anxiety disorder. All these things Jill knows. When we were in the Smokey Mountains we went to Anakeesta. I had anxiety going up the mountain but was okay once we were up and I also had anxiety going down. Jill was mad that Anna and I got lunch without telling her, and that I didn‚Äôt move with Anna to go sit at the table Jill had. My fianc√© and I were finishing lunch and then her brother joined us. I ran to the bathroom, came back and everyone went to do the bridge. I didn‚Äôt want to join because I was having a hard time with the heat and was scared of heights. She was then mad that we were in line to go down the mountain and did not stop when everyone else did. We didn‚Äôt realize they weren‚Äôt behind us until it was our turn to go down and I just needed to get it over with but we waited for everyone at the bottom. The last thing that bothered her was that we went to bed early after that day because we were exhausted from being in the heat all day.

The next day when we are supposed to go to Nashville Jill and Anna wanted to go hiking with their guys before going to Nashville. My fianc√© and I opted to skip because I don‚Äôt do well in heat. That same night we did a petal bike around Nashville and she was mad we took the caboose seat where we didn‚Äôt have to pedal after no one else wanted it. We even offered to switch with them which they eventually took. They were also mad that I didn‚Äôt take a shot with them after I was 3 drinks in (again a light weight). Then they were mad I left the pub early because I was sobering up and felt horrible.

The next morning I still feel awful and don‚Äôt want to go to breakfast but my fianc√© encourages me to go and be a team player. I feel a bit better after food and we go to the Parthenon with everyone. It‚Äôs closed when we get there, we take pictures but I start to feel sick again in the heat and have my fianc√© take me back to the hotel before wine tasting. She was mad about that. I can tell she‚Äôs mad at wine tasting and ask to talk but she said everything was fine. After wine tasting we nap and then go to dinner at a place with no air conditioning. We have a great dinner, all got entrees and shared apps, my fianc√© and I just had sodas. Our bill has all the appetizers on it and my fianc√© has the waiter fix it. They got mad about that because they were all hot. We then leave and go to Jelly Rolls bar. I start to not feel well but my fianc√© tells me to take deep breaths and everything will be fine. Well Jill runs us up to the roof on the stairs where there is little to no air conditioning. We get to the roof top part and I feel like I‚Äôm going to be sick and have a panic attack. After I calm down a bit my fianc√© takes me back to the hotel where I was sick the whole rest of the night. I felt bad but sent Jill a Venmo for shots. She was mad that I left the bar after my panic attack and being sick. The next evening is when Jill tells me I was not supportive of her and she did not feel celebrated and she will not be moving forward with either wedding.

So if you got to the end of this, am I the asshole? Should I have done more, powered through more? Could I have done something different? I haven‚Äôt heard from her since that text. I‚Äôve thought about reaching out to have one last conversation but I don‚Äôt know. Any and all advice is appreciated.

## FAQs Section

**Are Jupilo perfumes suitable for sensitive skin?**
While Jupilo perfumes use natural ingredients, individuals with sensitive skin should always perform a patch test before applying the fragrance liberally. A small amount of perfume can be applied to the inside of the wrist or elbow and observed for any signs of irritation, such as redness, itching, or rash. If irritation occurs, discontinue use immediately.

Authentic Jupilo perfumes can be purchased from the official Jupilo website, authorized retailers, and select department stores.To avoid purchasing counterfeit products, it is always recommended to buy directly from reputable sources.

1mrkw18,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1mrkw18/this_or_that/,This Or That,"Good Morning, coffee enthusiasts,



I‚Äôm planning to buy an espresso machine and wanted some advice from the community. My budget is around¬†‚Çπ50,000. I‚Äôm hoping to find something quality that‚Äôll last and deliver caf√©-worthy espresso at home. While browsing, I came across two Gaggia machines that caught my attention:

* Gaggia Classic Evo
* Gaggia Classic Color Vibez

Both look promising and seem highly recommended among entry-level prosumer machines. I love that the Evo has a reputation for reliability and upgrade potential, but the Color Vibez series is calling me with those vibrant, fun designs. It‚Äôd add some personality to my kitchen. 

On a side note, priorities for me:

* Consistently good espresso shots
* Easy maintenance and durability
* Some steam power for nice milk drinks
* Bonus if it looks great on my countertop xD

If anyone here owns either model (or has used both), I‚Äôd love to hear:

* How do they compare in terms of build quality and performance?
* Is there any real functional difference between Evo and Color Vibez, or is it mainly aesthetic?
* Any quirks I should know about before buying?
* Are there other machines I should be considering at this price point?

Recommendations, reviews, and even tips on where to buy are all welcome. Thanks in advance",2,1755319146.0,IndiaCoffee,8,0.75,False

But I also would like to indulge a long-held curiosity about carrom if it is possible.

I've always been drawn to this game! It isn't really played where I am (New York). I'm wondering if there's a good place to go to watch people play carrom ‚Äî¬†or maybe learn and play a few rounds myself?

Half of my interest is the game, half is how and where people play it. Is it a cafe game? A street game? Home parlors? Is there wagering? Played while drinking coffee or drinking alcohol? Love to watch the scene, if there is one.

Thank you for any help. The only night I really have free in Colombo is next Saturday, August 30, so hoping for some tips on where I might see it played then. (Perhaps everyone has better and more lively things to do on a Saturday night than a board game...)",3,1755318948.0,srilanka,2,1.0,False
1mrks11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Earbuds/comments/1mrks11/odd_thing_happened_with_clip_on_earbuds_anybody/,"Odd thing happened with clip on  earbuds, anybody experience the similar?","Never posted anywhere before. Sorry if this post rambles. Its late and past bedtime. Just a bit perplexed and hoping someone/anyone can shed a little light.

I'm not very tech savvy, but have a general broad knowledge about how gadgets work. I usually don't care enough to figure out the features. Just ""plug in  and play"" and move on. 
I purchased open ear clip on earbuds so I could  listen to YouTube on my phone while being busy doing other things.

I was wearing the earbuds listening to YouTube while preparing dinner (meat and veggies). I don't remember if the episode ended, I paused it, or turned YouTube off. 
My earbuds were still connected, but my phone was off and in my pocket. 

I was yelling at my uncle (94 years old). Not yelling be mean. He refuses to wear his hearing aids because he doesn't want to hear his wife (92 year old, my aunt) constantly berating. (Yes, we are all traumatized and  need endless therapy.)

The shouting match went something like this:
Uncle: Bring me a cookie. I need something to eat.
Me: Don't have any cookies. We're cooking the gravy. It's not ready yet.
Uncle: What?
Me: THE GRAVY ISN'T READY. 
Uncle: WHAT?
Me: YOU SAID YOU WANTED GRAVY. ITS STILL COOKING.
Uncle: Ok Gravy. And coffee. 

When I turned to back to the kitchen, a male ai voice in my earbuds said: Your friend is making you gravy. It will be a ready in a little while. 

This has me perplexed. It mistakenly 'thought' my uncle was wearing the earbuds and had interpreted the situation. 


How did this happen? My phone (Galaxy S21+) was off and not running any program (that I know of). 
I thought these $30 earbuds (King Lucky brand from Amazon, sound quality isn't best, batterylife doesn't meet what is stated) were just average headphones.

It really has me a bit rattled. I know I heard it, but what if I'm just loosing my marbles?

Has anyone else experienced anything like this where earbuds commented on situations?

Thanks for anyone that can offer some insight.  
I'll check back after work tomorrow.

1mrkopk,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelwriting/comments/1mrkopk/harpers_ferry/,Harpers Ferry,"The waters at Harpers Ferry kept company with the roads and there divided into three. One branch came down out of the Shenandoah on the Virginia side; another curved from the Potomac along the Maryland shore; and there, at that meeting-place, the streams were joined. For a space they lay as still as any lake‚Äîso still they might turn the blue ridgelines and the black seams of old oaks upside down‚Äîthen slid southward, and farther southward yet, marking for a time the boundary among three states‚ÄîVirginia, Maryland, and West Virginia‚Äîbefore the flow bore on as the main stem of the Potomac.

Because three roads splayed thence‚Äîone toward Luray and Front Royal, one up to the hill of St. Peter‚Äôs Church, and one on to Brunswick and Frederick‚Äîtravelers were ever about, and the Harpers Ferry market prospered even on days that were no market-days at all. There are many ways into the Appalachians; yet the fair set along the C&O Canal towpath had a name that traveled uncommonly far. There are state lines enough in this republic; yet when folk spoke of ‚Äúthe market on the line,‚Äù they meant this one. On market-days the tenant farmers came down out of the hills with ramps and morels, fiddleheads and blackberries; peddlers from the Maryland side crossed with thread and needles, round hand mirrors, pocketknives, twine, and small tin trinkets; and from downstream the fishmongers of the Potomac and the Shenandoah trudged up with shad and herring, smallmouth bass, catfish, and American eel. For a gorge it was a respectable mart indeed‚Äîbut Harpers Ferry‚Äôs renown was not raised upon trade alone.

Even when no market was pitched, the place drew people out of the neighboring towns; perhaps because every inn that had crept from the towpath up onto the knolls poured hard cider preternaturally clear and cold, and pan-fried trout the instant it came out of the water. Perhaps it was for the old-time ballads‚Äîheavy with sorrow and with style‚Äîand the shape-note hymns whose hearty harmonies drifted year-round through the weeping willows that lined the porch. And then there were the tent shows and the string bands that now and again rolled in from the west; by custom and long precedent they shook out their last rehearsal‚Äîtruth to tell, their first performance‚Äîright here ere crossing a state line. That too lifted the market‚Äôs name and made it dear.

Of all such houses, May‚Äôs inn, the Willow & Trout, was most renowned: drink that tasted better than elsewhere, prices that ran low, and May‚Äôs open hand. Folk favored her the more, and pitied her too, for she had lately lost her mother and lived with none save her bachelor son and two kitchen girls, waiting upon a husband whose road home seemed doubtful. If a traveler‚Äôs purse ran thin or his kit proved wanting, he made for May‚Äôs as a matter of course.

‚ÄúWhen I come back from Maryland, we‚Äôll settle up together.‚Äù

Men spoke it as if it were nothing.

It was at a summer sundown‚Äîwillow wands rinsed by the river, shad flashing in the evening gloaming‚Äîwhen an old hawker of brushes and combs, well past sixty, climbed May‚Äôs porch with frames and comb-boards across his shoulders, a cane in one hand and a fan in the other. Close upon him stood a slender young woman of about one-and-twenty with a small bundle tucked at her side. Both looked bone-weary.

‚ÄúTwo of you, counting the young lady?‚Äù May asked, observing the big girl more than the old man. He nodded without a word.

That night, when the table had been cleared, he asked leave to declare himself. Walker, he said. He lodged near Shepherdstown and had come to earn a trifle on the Virginia side. His home country was the mountains of West Virginia; as a young man he had followed a friend and dwelt for a while near Harpers Ferry, then drifted to the shipyard at Charleston, then to the mills at Swannanoa, and later to a factory-town inland‚Äîlonely as any island‚Äîwhere he labored eighteen years, turning gray, before at last circling back toward the Shenandoah a few years gone. When May asked how he could be traveling with so grown a girl, he answered that he had meant never to wander again, not to the end of his days; yet if they did not take to the road, the two of them would starve.

‚ÄúShe is your daughter, then?‚Äù May looked past the slant of lamplight toward the corner where the young woman, bright-eyed, glanced this way now and again, her shoulders rounded and gentle. The old man nodded once more. A life of drifting, he said, had made even the place to which he returned feel like yet another lodging‚Äîno better than a stranger‚Äôs house‚Äîand a father‚Äôs daughter with nowhere to lean was a sorrow.

‚ÄúWhen I was young I liked sport myself,‚Äù the old man continued. ‚ÄúI roamed with a little troupe, playing the clown and making merry‚Ä¶ New Year‚Äôs when I was four-and-twenty‚Äîsix-and-thirty years to the day‚ÄîI spent one high night at this very market.‚Äù He peered about the room as though teasing out a thread of memory.

‚ÄúMercy, that is an age ago!‚Äù May feigned more astonishment than she felt.

It rained upon the morrow.

Eli‚Äîwho set up his book-stall only upon market-days‚Äîwas coming down a day early from the school at St. Peter‚Äôs on the hill to lay in what he would need for the morrow. The road from the church to the market is but a scant couple of miles of good going; yet that day the sweep of water and rock and splendid gorge would not let him have the back of the road.

At first he had been led to school by the wrist‚Äîdragged, truth be told, by his grandmother‚Äîand then he kept going, tugged along by affection for the older boys. But of late the daily bell, the Latin hymns, even the clear shade of the elms and maples in the yard grew wearisome.

He had always wished to wing off to somewhere‚Äîanywhere‚Äîbut his mother flared up red-eyed at the very word go.

‚ÄúI have no husband, and no kin to speak of. I have staked my life upon you. If you talk of going day and night, upon whom am I to lean?‚Äù He had heard that lament until it set like nails in his ears.

His grandmother, for her part, had hoped the bell would bleed the wander out of him once she sent him to school at ten. But when Eli was about three, a traveling phrenologist‚Äîone of those men who read a child‚Äôs bent by the bumps upon a skull‚Äîhad passed through the inn and declared, ‚ÄúThis boy hath the temperament of a traveler,‚Äù and for a time she took it to heart and mourned. She asked the parish priest one day, and an odd hermit beyond the ridge on another, but the saying never changed.

‚ÄúHe is born to take after his daddy‚Äôs ways,‚Äù his grandmother muttered‚Äîonly half a dig at his mother, and not from malice. May, who took such remarks to heart, would answer, ‚ÄúChildren fail not to resemble their parents. Root and branch begin with the mother,‚Äù and scolded herself along with her own mother for good measure.

The truth was more tangled. Six-and-thirty years before, Eli‚Äôs grandmother had fallen for a roaming troupe‚Äôs slow, pendulum-swinging tune and conceived May; later May herself, taken with a man who drifted like a white cloud, conceived Eli. Mother and daughter had both been born to this market-inn. There was no time, nor sense, for blame. If Eli‚Äôs roaming bent came of his mother‚Äôs choosing a man of the road, and if she chose such a man because her own mother had once lost her heart to a troupe, then the root of the boy‚Äôs traveling temper lay with the grandmother. She tried to tame it by setting him to the bell; when the bell failed, May would try the book-trade and see if commerce could spend what church could not. Eli, for his part, was drawn more to tales than to hymns and liked the thought of dealing better than the yard; and so May, having first exacted a promise that he would at least keep the Harpers Ferry market, gave him a stall.

When Eli came up upon the porch ledge, May started upright. ‚ÄúHot as it is, why so late coming down?‚Äù She handed him a towel and a fan.

The stranger who had been reading penny tales aloud to May looked up from the book and met Eli‚Äôs eyes. A tapered face; eyes bright as blossoms, the white and the black set off clean. Eli felt a quick sting in his breast and, suddenly shy, glanced out toward the willows before the house.

A moment later the young woman slipped inside, and May brought out Eli‚Äôs dinner. ‚ÄúShe is the comb-man‚Äôs girl,‚Äù she said, pleased.

‚ÄúA comb-man?‚Äù Eli held the tray but did not lift the spoon, watching his mother‚Äôs face.

‚ÄúHe has gone into the Shenandoah hollows. Says he may cross into Maryland after. Last evening he took the hills. The girl is an only child. He begged to take her along, so I said we would keep her awhile.‚Äù May studied his face as if to read it. ‚ÄúHow long does he mean to stay up there?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf he takes to it, he will push deeper along the Blue Ridge.‚Äù

Then, as if to herself, ‚ÄúShe doth not seem the daughter of such a man, doth she?‚Äù The girl‚Äôs name was Lucy.

Eli lifted his spoon in silence, and pushed the tray away ere he was half done.

Upon the next day, as he sat at his stall, the comb-man‚Äôs daughter came down with his dinner. The inn and the market stood within calling distance, and Meg commonly did the carrying; he felt awkward that a young woman had been sent. But she set the basket down with a smile bright in her blossom-eyes, and her glance ran straight to the food sheds where they sold candy-apples, sorghum sticks, and cut comb.

‚ÄúWhere is Meg?‚Äù Eli, feeling her gladness in his own breast, kept his head averted and asked a little roughly.

‚ÄúThe porch is crowded. May sent me.‚Äù Lucy, who swallowed most of her words, answered in a Shenandoah lilt, her voice clear. Slender waist, wiry limbs, plump backs of the hands, full lips‚Äîthe sound suited the build.

‚ÄúLucy, set Eli‚Äôs wash-water.‚Äù

On the morrow May kept Meg in the kitchen and put all Eli‚Äôs tending upon Lucy‚Äîwash-water, barley coffee, tray, towel. ‚ÄúShe is not dull; she is warm; and there is no meanness in her,‚Äù May said, with a touch of pride. ‚ÄúHer father‚Äîstrange to say‚Äîseems half eager to leave her with me, as though she were to be my foster-girl.‚Äù She paused to read Eli‚Äôs face and went on, ‚ÄúStill, your say matters, so I have only half agreed‚Ä¶ Take her up sometime and show her the Seven Hills overlook.‚Äù It was as though she sought his consent.

Lucy said their place upon the Shenandoah side was a shack at the foot of a ridge, far from town, with scarcely a neighbor.

‚ÄúWhat did they with the house then?‚Äù

‚ÄúLock the door, and that is that,‚Äù May answered for her. ‚ÄúBut I mislike Lucy‚Äôs being out upon the road.‚Äù

It began to appear that Walker truly purposed to leave Lucy with May. May had begged Eli to marry more than once; and though the barmaids sometimes made him trouble, he had never set his heart upon any of them. Now May seemed anxious that Lucy should not give Eli cause to dislike her.

When Eli came up from the dry-goods store below with a pair of new shoes, May grinned and, instead of liquor, dipped him a bowl of hard cider. ‚ÄúToo hot for anything else.‚Äù She was liberal with tastings when she strained a barrel.

‚ÄúLucy, come out. Thou wilt be thirsty‚Äîdrink first.‚Äù May called toward the room. Lucy came out in a neat calico blouse and slender linen skirt, and with those clear eyes looked like a lotus riding the water.

‚ÄúThat was mine, twenty years ago,‚Äù May said, half wistful. ‚ÄúI let the seams out yesterday‚Äîmore room in it than you would think‚Ä¶ Here, drink up. No need to be shy before Eli.‚Äù Lucy took the cup, smiling, and seemed to finish it within.

Eli went first to the willows and wet his new shoes; Lucy followed. He had said he must go up to the bookshop on the hill to collect, and May had answered that Lucy had hankered for days to gather greens and should see the overlook anyway‚Äîso take her. Eli‚Äôs heart beat a little quick. He had grumbled that he knew not one green from another, and May had said, ‚ÄúWho asked thee to pick? Only walk before and show the way,‚Äù and he could argue no more.

From the first Eli left the main road and took the brushy path few used. This was Blue Ridge foothill country; trails were often more notion than path. He had grown up there, yet more than once the thickening tangles lost him.

Look up‚Äîthe ridges pierced the sky. Look down‚Äîunderfoot the hazed green of brush like a sea, white sunlight falling in streams. Summer blackberries instead of mountain grapes; wild grapevines and Virginia creeper veining the trees; pawpaw fruit still green; cherry-red raspberries and mulberries so black that the least touch stained the hands.

Eli walked ahead, beating back the Virginia creeper with a green alder stick. Lucy lagged behind, breaking off tender ramps or stopping for strawberries.

‚ÄúHurry now‚Äîwhat art thou at?‚Äù Eli would halt and scold, and she would drop berries or ramps, press her full lips together, and hop after him. Anon she fell back again.

‚ÄúOh my!‚Äù she cried at last. He turned and saw her skirt caught high upon a snag as she stood upon an oak. Why the oak? A blackberry cane had arched up within reach; the thorns were stout and the slope too steep to climb from below, so she had gone up the oak wrapped with grapevine. She could not free the fabric without letting go the branch that steadied her, and if she loosed it she would fall. The sun poured under her; a gust might lift the petticoat‚ÄîEli tried to keep his eyes aside and reached with his stick.

He tried to pry the cloth free with the sapling cane, but it was too short and kept brushing her ankle and calf.

‚ÄúNo‚Äîpray! I shall fall!‚Äù she cried. Just then a squirrel ran the grapevine, ready to leap upon the very limb she held.

‚ÄúOnly frighten the squirrel off! I am falling this instant!‚Äù

‚ÄúThou rascal‚Ä¶‚Äù Eli climbed to the base of the same tree, freed the snag at last, and flicked the grapevine once where the squirrel had perched. A few doves burst up and away over the briars.

‚ÄúIf only there were a spring,‚Äù Lucy said, wiping her brow with her skirt.

Each turn to a new spine of mountain brought a rougher knob; each lift of the canopy to the bright sky showed another valley matted with grape and blackberry and Virginia creeper. Deeper in, the whip-poor-wills raised a clamor, and now and again a wild turkey‚Äôs call shook the fern-fans.

The sun passed noon and beat down as if a coal had been set upon the head. In the shade, black snails clung and left a pale slime.

The hotter and thirstier they grew, the more they burrowed like animals into the tangles. Strawberries, blackberries, hard little wild peaches‚Äîwhatever the hand found, the mouth found; and whatever reached the mouth melted like frost-water, leaving only a sourness. Now and again the teeth struck green pawpaw or some other unripe fruit, and bitterness spread into the cheeks. Thirstier for it, Lucy heaped a Virginia-creeper leaf with the small peachlike fruit and passed it to Eli. He set the leaf across his palms and bent to it as to a drink. When it was empty, he tossed the leaf aside and leaned back upon a log wrapped round with grape.

She offered a second leaf-plate. He, impatient, poured it in at once, flicked the remnant away, and soon began to snore.

She filled a third with blackberries and wild grapes, but seeing him asleep, ate as he had. ‚ÄúHe sleeps soundly enough,‚Äù she murmured. She tried to lie back but sneezed; her mouth was dry, her belly empty. Suddenly the whip-poor-wills frightened her.

‚ÄúMayhap there is a spring in the thicket,‚Äù she said, shouldering in until she found a pawpaw limb tangled with grape and heavy with green fruit. ‚ÄúWould they were ripe.‚Äù She picked three of the largest and, by habit, bit one at once. A greenish, fishy bitterness filled her mouth. ‚ÄúOh, that is green,‚Äù she said, spitting, and went back to Eli. The sun was already slanting; hunger came with the thirst.

‚ÄúWake. Let us find water.‚Äù She shook his shoulder. He opened his eyes. Flustered, she held the two green fruits to his nose. He sat up, drew her round shoulders and the nape of her neck to him, and their lips met.

On her full lips lay the sweetness of morning‚Äîstrawberries and blackberries and wild peach, the green tang of unripe pawpaw‚Äîand with it the warm scent of earth and crushed grass.

Caw‚Äîcaw‚Äîan old crow swung over their heads.

‚ÄúIs it far to the overlook still?‚Äù she asked at last, lifting down the lunch-bundle from the grapevine.

Walker, who had gone into the Shenandoah hollows, did not return for more than a fortnight. He had said as much when he left; he must have gone deep, May and Lucy thought.

‚ÄúLooks like he will summer in the hills,‚Äù May would say. The two kept to their penny tales. Lucy‚Äôs Shenandoah lilt‚Äîearthy at first‚Äîgrew clearer and more plaintive, like song.

In that time one new thing did come between May and Lucy: May found a tiny birthmark just above the rim of Lucy‚Äôs left ear.

One morning, as May was braiding Lucy‚Äôs hair, her hand trembled as though she would faint.

‚ÄúWhat is it, May?‚Äù Lucy asked, startled. May only stared into her eyes and said nothing.

‚ÄúMay‚Äîwhat is amiss?‚Äù Lucy asked again. May drew a long breath, as one coming back to herself, and said, ‚ÄúIt is nothing,‚Äù and set the comb to work anew. Lucy thought it strange, but could not press May past a ‚Äúnothing.‚Äù

Next day May, hair pinned tight, left early for errands in Charles Town. Eli was napping in the front room. A shower came. Lucy ran in with the wash, crying, ‚ÄúOh no, May will be caught in the rain!‚Äù The fresh wind and damp upon her hem brushed Eli‚Äôs face and woke him; his hand reached and caught her skirt. She turned quick, cradling the wash, and looked at him. Dimples rose in her cheeks, and just then someone moved without.

‚ÄúMay‚Äôs clothes will be soaked!‚Äù she called again and went back to the porch. Eli was snoring anon.

When he woke once more, customers were drinking hard cider upon the porch. From the kitchen Lucy called, ‚ÄúOnly catfish and green peppers for a bite tonight!‚Äù After they had gone, Eli said, a touch peevish, ‚ÄúI told thee, take no customers when May is gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf we let that barrel sit, it will turn by morning. May would be the more cross to waste it, would she not?‚Äù Lucy answered as if to soothe him. A little later she came smiling. ‚ÄúEli, buy me a round hand mirror‚Äîprithee? I have always wished one.‚Äù The morrow was market-day; when she brought his dinner, he handed her the small mirror he had bought ahead, and a bundle of sorghum sticks.

‚ÄúOh my!‚Äù she cried, seeing mirror and candy. She looked in it again and again with blossom-bright eyes, tucked it to her breast, and sat beside him, cracking the candy between her teeth.

He shifted this way and that whenever a shadow crossed the front of the stall, to keep her from notice. Lucy loved sweets. When the candy-man or fruit-seller passed the house, she would spring from her sewing and stand, staring after them till they were gone.

Once Eli came down from the school and found only Lucy upon the porch steps‚ÄîMay nowhere about‚Äîsharing slices of watermelon with a loafer from the inn next door. When she saw Eli, her face flushed, then brightened. ‚ÄúOh‚ÄîEli!‚Äù

He did not look at her, but went straight to his room. She set down the melon and followed with eyes wide.

‚ÄúWhat is it, Eli?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHey‚Äîwhat is amiss?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù

He said nothing. When she set her arms about his shoulders to draw him close, he twisted free like lightning and, all at once, fell upon her and struck her face with his hand. She cried, ‚ÄúEli, Eli!‚Äù and raised her hands at first, looking at him with a painful little frown; then, after two or three loud smacks, she turned to the corner and buried her face, taking the storm without a word.

Upon the next day she brought his dinner to the market with her lips pressed tight and said nothing. In her clear eyes there was neither deep grudge nor hate for what had passed.

That night he saw her alone by the river and followed. The sky was blue with stars, and the willow shade made the bank black.

‚ÄúEli,‚Äù she said when he came near, rising and stepping up until she stood near his chin, speaking low, ‚Äúwhy hast thou been holed at the school all the time?‚Äù The Shenandoah lilt curled in the whisper.

About then he seldom came down unless it was market-day. Since May had come home wet from Charles Town, she seemed to watch them differently; his heart was delicate, and he hated to be disliked, and anger at his mother made him dig in and stay uphill. That night, ere he could answer Lucy, May‚Äôs voice came out of the dark‚Äî‚ÄúLucy! Lucy!‚Äù Eli wrinkled his nose and shut his mouth. ‚ÄúOh, May‚Äîhow hard she is,‚Äù he thought, his throat gone tight. A firefly drifted past. Lucy sat upon a rock and clenched a handful of reeds, murmuring something he could not hear for the water.

At dawn next day Eli poked about the room and kitchen, looked a little disappointed, and went back up to the school. Lucy, as ever, stood at the selfsame bend with the reeds, rinsing rags.

Three days later Eli came down again. Walker sat upon the porch drinking cider; Lucy‚Äîhair braided and dressed in the same calico, washed and ironed, a small bundle at her side‚Äîsat hunched at the edge. When she spied Eli, joy sprang into her blossom-eyes and she started up; in the selfsame instant her full lips tightened with a warning that told what lay between them‚Äîurgent and unhappy.

‚ÄúLucy is leaving now,‚Äù May said the moment she saw Eli.

Later he set the tale aright within himself: Walker had returned that evening‚Äîthe one when Eli had gone back up the hill. He had meant to take Lucy away at once; May pleaded for a day‚Äôs rest, and now they were packed to be gone at first light. But at the first hearing Eli felt as if a lump of iron had struck his skull; the blood drew tight to a point, his ears pricked toward the crown, his tongue curled back into his throat, a blue flash pricked at the corners of his eyes. Dizziness, anger, and hurry ran him from toes to scalp. Only now, at the point of parting, did he know how impossibly bound he was to her. Now, upon the knife-edge of forever, the wick took flame‚Äîeverything unreal as a dream. He might have howled and flung honor and shame aside had he let himself. But he could not show that face to May. He bit his trembling lip and dropped hard upon the porch edge.

‚ÄúFine-looking boy you have raised,‚Äù Walker said‚Äîsurely of Eli. Eli did not turn his head, but sat as a man sits who bears a grudge against the world.

Meanwhile May told how Walker, whilst in the hills, had come upon a young man‚Äîthe son of an old friend from back home‚Äîwho ran a factory there. In the way of meetings, the young man had urged Walker to return to their coastal town and live there, with help to set him up. The thought of home came sudden, and with aid promised, Walker had resolved to go back to the shore. To Eli, with his ears humming from fear and fury, the tale buzzed like a swarm of bees and scarce made sense.

‚ÄúThis cider fills me right up,‚Äù Walker said, finishing his last bowl and taking up fan and cane.

‚ÄúIf you go to the coast, I suppose we shall not see you again,‚Äù May said, standing.

‚ÄúWho knoweth a man‚Äôs road? If there be a turn for it, we will meet again,‚Äù Walker answered, lacing his big boots.

‚ÄúGo well, girl,‚Äù May said, tucking a little flowered purse with money into Lucy‚Äôs small bundle as a token. Lucy stared at May with reddened, pleading eyes. ‚ÄúCome again,‚Äù May said, stroking the gentle, wave-like slope of Lucy‚Äôs shoulders. Lucy buried her face in May‚Äôs breast and wept. ‚ÄúHush now. Thy father waits.‚Äù Even May‚Äôs voice had gone thin.

‚ÄúWell then, keep well,‚Äù Walker said to May.

‚ÄúIf things do not take, come back and live with us,‚Äù May urged once more.

‚ÄúKeep well, Eli,‚Äù Lucy said, hunting Eli‚Äôs last look with eyes bloodshot and bright.

At that Eli sprang from the porch as if waking, stumbled a few steps toward her, and then‚Äîas if some sense seized him‚Äîstiffened like a post and stood staring at her face a great while.

‚ÄúKeep well, Eli.‚Äù Even the second farewell held the same hope in her red eyes, as if some miracle, some word of order would come from him. But Eli, leaning on the willow, had only fire in his gaze, and no word, no wonder came.

‚ÄúKeep well, Eli.‚Äù Leaving the last words in a voice near-broken with tears, Lucy turned. Eli stood staring at the calico blouse, receding in the fair light under drooping willow branches and the mountain-ringing cry of whip-poor-will, and did not move.

He rose again only the following spring, well after Groundhog Day and the first frog-song‚Äîabout cherry-blossom time, with a fine drizzle now and then. The willows out front were thread-green again; cherries and lilacs bloomed bright upon the lanes and foothills.

May came in with a bowl of soup and, seeing he had finished it, asked,

‚ÄúDost thou still wish to try for the western sea?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù Eli turned his head quietly.

‚ÄúWilt thou marry here and live with me?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù He turned away again.

Before spring fully came that year‚Äîwhen most had given up hope of Eli‚Äôs returning to himself‚ÄîMay at last said, ‚ÄúIf thou art set on dying, at least go knowing what lieth in thy mother‚Äôs heart,‚Äù and told him: that the comb-man Walker was, very like, the selfsame roaming fellow who had passed one night at the market six-and-thirty years ago and left a tie to her mother‚ÄîEli‚Äôs grandmother‚Äîand that Lucy, judging by the small mark above her left ear, might be May‚Äôs half-sister. She showed him the same dark speck above her own left ear.

‚ÄúWhen I first heard ‚Äòsix-and-thirty years,‚Äô my heart went cold. I hoped I was wrong. I went so far as to fetch a traveling phrenologist out of Charles Town the next day‚ÄîGod help me‚Äîand he too spoke as though he knew men‚Äôs insides and made a fool of me.‚Äù She ceased. Eli‚Äôs eyes flashed like a lamp as he looked at his mother. ‚ÄúBetter not to know‚Äîsave once thou knowest, thou must set thy conduct right,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThink not hard of thy mother.‚Äù She washed his thin hand with tears. Oddly, that last‚Äîalmost a housekeeping of their souls‚Äîgave him strength. He stared at the ceiling with burning eyes a long while and bit his lip as though fixing a new resolve.

He would not go west to hunt a father. He would not marry and set up a household here. May let go her stubborn hopes.

‚ÄúThen what wilt thou do? Do as seemeth fit.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù He lay back without a word.

A little over a month later, on a market morning early in summer‚Äîgreens coming in from the Shenandoah in place of the others from neighboring hollows‚ÄîEli downed a bowl of hard cider with a plate of tender shoots and said, ‚ÄúMother, have a candy-tray made for me.‚Äù

May stared at him as if struck.

Another fortnight passed. The whip-poor-wills were loud as the hills themselves, and the willows shone with wet light. A light dawn-shower had passed; the day cleared bright. Up at the three-way above the Harpers Ferry market, Eli was taking leave of May. He had changed into a clean white shirt and pants, tied a silk kerchief tight upon his head, and slung the new white wooden tray across his shoulder like a bar. The upper tier was more than half filled with neat sorghum sticks; the lower held a few dime-novels and small notions.

Before his feet, water and road split three ways. He had turned his back upon the Shenandoah way from the start; the road southeast ran toward Virginia, the road northwest toward Maryland. The Maryland ridge Walker and Lucy had crossed last year, their eyes full of tears, still bent up from the market into the glare‚Äîbut Eli, after standing awhile, turned. His steps went slow toward Virginia, Maryland at his back.

A step, and another‚Äîthe farther he went, the lighter he felt. When May‚Äôs inn‚Äîwatching him from between the willows, no doubt‚Äîfell at last out of sight, he was humming a snatch of ‚ÄúWayfaring Stranger‚Äù under his breath. On his left the Potomac, on his right the state line, flowed side by side.

As I was sitting there at the light sipping my coffee I see something move out of my peripheral vision on my left, I quickly turned to look out my drivers side window and I find this lady staring through my window and recording with her phone. Startled the crap out of me with her face up to the glass.

She the proceeds to walk away and goes off behind her car to record the guy in the jeep that had just pulled out of the drive thru and was waiting behind her.

I was the weirdest encounter and left me immediately thinking all morning what the ü§¨ that was all about. I wasn‚Äôt sure if this was some weird insurance fraud scam attempt or if she‚Äôs just having some paranoid breakdown. 

My friend thinks she's going to post me on t app to get doxxed. Should I be paranoid?

Anyone had a similar interaction with this rando?

Feeling Burnt Out or Frustrated? Vent Anonymously to a Real Human Listener (Free Zoom Calls)

Ever feel like you're about to explode? That pent-up frustration from work politics, a toxic boss, relationship struggles, or just... life? You're not alone.

I know that feeling all too well. After years grinding in finance, dealing with the backstabbing, the politics, and the sheer exhaustion of holding it all in, I hit my breaking point. I realized how damaging it is when there's no safe space to just VENT.

That's why I created Vent Out.

What is it?
A simple, completely anonymous Zoom call. Just you and a non-judgmental listener (me!). Talk about anything that's eating you up:

Work nightmares (micromanagers, impossible deadlines, office BS)

Relationship stress (family, partners, friends)

Financial pressure

Or just the general weight of the world...

Here's the deal:
‚Ä¢	100% Anonymous: Your identity stays private. Use a nickname, turn off your camera.
‚Ä¢	Zero Judgment: I'm here to listen, period.
‚Ä¢	No Advice (Unless you ask!): This isn't therapy. It's a pressure release valve. I offer a safe ear, not solutions (though I might share relatable experiences if it helps).
‚Ä¢	Completely Free: Seriously. No catch. (Though if you find it incredibly helpful and want to support keeping this going, buy me a coffee ‚Äì totally optional!)

How it works:
‚Ä¢	Schedule: Pick a time via the link below.
‚Ä¢	Vent: Hop on Zoom (anonymously!) and let it out for 15 minutes.
‚Ä¢	Feel Lighter: Walk away having released some of that built-up tension.
