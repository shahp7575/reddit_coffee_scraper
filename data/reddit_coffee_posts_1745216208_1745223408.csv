Now I'm aiming to lose another 25lbs. Initially, it was trial and error but once I started taking tips from this subreddit and similar ones, it became routine. 

I was happy and proud of myself for reaching my initial weightloss goal. It was imoortant to me to make sure my blood pressure, cholesterol and A1C levels were in the green, which is what motivated me to reach my initial goal.

This next weight goal has gone a lot slower. Life got busy and I stopped working out, which meant I had to really watch my caloric intake- 1200 cals daily. Anything over that, forget about it. The joys of being 5'2, female and sedentary. 

I went on two vacations, had a birthday, flew out to my brother's birthday party a couple days later, and then came back to have a birthday party for my mom, and today was Easter üòÖ. Needless to say, I worried a lot about counting and gaining- when I should've just been focused on having a good time.

I stayed the same weight these past five weeks, but I'm still frustrated that I haven't lost anything these past five weeks because I was enjoying life. I'm also in some sports and recreational leagues which have been nice but now I also have to budget calories for those events too.

This week, im still doing my 1200 caloric intake and have meal prepped and precalculated everything just to make my brain not cry: 

B: black coffee, protein drink, greek yogurt and granola protein, raspberries, honey, crasins 

L: protein bar, protein drink

D: superfood salad and rotisserie chicken 

S: cookie or pear (depends on mood tbh)

But I will be adding some exercise. Walking the dog longer and the Peloton a couple times this week. I'm not looking forward to cycling but it works, gets me really toned, gets the endorphins going and is a great stress reliever. 

Then the weekend, I'll do 1500 calories to give myself a break. 

This journey is challenging, but our health will thank us later. Thank you for reading my accountability post. Please share your stories with me also, I love the camaraderie in knowing other people are having to do mental gymnastics with these food and weight loss decisions also üòÖ",1,1745223292.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

I started Elvanse 30mg 2 weeks ago, and got in touch with my prescriber because the side effects were brutal, constant extreme nausea, zero appetite, headaches, racing heart. the works. She suggested I go down to 20mg and see how I get on.

I'm a few days into 20mg now. I feel much better, no nausea, appetite is returning. Heart rate and headaches remain though. I can feel the 20mg ""kick in"", bit like someone chucked a fishing net over my brain and runs an electric charge through it. The heart rate is what concerns me. I've gone from resting at 60 to resting 70, and I hit 100bpm quite often throughout the day.

I have a follow up with her on Friday, and wonder what others would suggest. I can continue on the 20mg for another 4 weeks and see if the heart rate steadies itself and give it a fair shot, or if it's a better idea to switch medication to either Concerta (I've heard for a lot of folk, where one fails, the other works).

I should mention, I've switched entirely to decaf coffee (heartbreaking) and vape 3mg a few times a day.

1k48b22,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1k48b22/i_feel_crazy/,I feel crazy,"I think I may be ~12wks pregnant despite negative urine tests. Also, I‚Äôve been having irregular light bleeding that I assumed was my period. But the cycle is abnormal. It‚Äôs been happening every 2-3wks when my period is typically a predictable 28 days. 
So why do I think I‚Äôm pregnant? With my first I just ‚Äòknew‚Äô. I tested positive pretty early at 4wks but had ‚Äòknown‚Äô for a couple that I was pregnant. 
I had the same feeling in February. I think I conceived a week or two before Valentine‚Äôs day. On Vday I felt gross. My boobs and nipples randomly hurt so badly wearing a shirt was painful and I was bloated. I weirdly think these were symptoms of implantation. 
A couple days after that the nausea started. I would wake up nauseous, go to sleep nauseous. I was throwing up everything I ate,  even smoothies. I also suddenly didn‚Äôt want coffee anymore. Not because it made me sick, I just had no interest. And I love coffee so that was weird. This all lasted for 7 weeks. During that time I developed an obsession with tinned fish. I would watch tiktok‚Äôs about it, look up different brands and types, research which store had what. I would dream about it and wake up drooling. I had a $35 mega pack of smoked kippers in my Amazon cart. I‚Äôd never even had them! 
Luckily the nausea kept me from making that purchase. 
Then 9 days ago I could finally eat again. You bet I went to the store to find kippers. There were only anchovies. Tried them, hated them. Then got sardines, tried them and hated them. But that didn‚Äôt stop me! Tonight I was eating a can of kippers like my life depended on it when it hit me. Pregnancy craving. Because why do I keep buying and eating something I objectively do not like. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about them! 
I have taken a handful of home pregnancy tests. The first was negative, likely tested too early. Second, defective. Third, pee was diluted. Fourth, negative but could be hook effect. Fifth, defective. Then I gave up because I‚Äôm tired of spending money on faulty tests. 
I also feel a stretching feeling in my uterus. And tightening in my abdomen like I‚Äôve been flexing but I‚Äôm not. My first pregnancy didn‚Äôt make it this far so I‚Äôm unfamiliar with what that feels like. But I do know I don‚Äôt usually feel these things. 
so, am I crazy? is this like that episode of greys anatomy where alex‚Äôs gf was convinced she‚Äôs pregnant?

SW 15st 8lb. CW 14st 10lb 

First week over with a loss of 12lb üôå.. yes I know water intake and initial big loss is to be expected but I‚Äôm still very very happy!! very little side effects - I felt nauseous once and it was due to putting an extra sweetener in my coffee by accident and the sweetness really turned my stomach so I will know to be super cautious! Beyond that? A few points I‚Äôve noticed 

1. Food suppression was amazing! I could feel it lessen in the last day or 2 but even still it wasn‚Äôt as bad as before I started mounjaro 
2. The food noise was almost nonexistent- it‚Äôs more like I was thinking ‚Äúwhy am I not thinking about food?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt realise how mentally engaged I am into food-when? What? How often? Sweet treats? So I‚Äôm hoping this drug helps repair my relationship with food, mentally. 
3. The fear of having bad side effects really impacted on my food decisions- I aimed for high protein and less fatty foods out of sheer fear!! 
4. Tiredness set in around day 3- I then got some B12 and hoping this will help long term but too early to tell if this is going to help long term. 
5. Gulping down 4-5 litres of water a day has become quite easy as I set myself timings during the day to have a litre in by.. next thing I‚Äôm gulping without even noticing.. I hope this stays!

Anyway‚Ä¶ next jab tonight- I know weight loss will slow and regulate but this week has been amazing for me as an eye opener to my bad habits and relationship with food-something I need to work on internally on my journey.. ",1,1745223182.0,mounjarouk,0,1.0,False

1k484xh,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1k484xh/wtf_is_vibe_coding/,Wtf is Vibe coding,"Gen Z devs are building apps they barely understand‚Äîand why that might not be a bad thing.

https://preview.redd.it/rs6oc5qea5we1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=6598d1284f61e4154ed3f15ff6c461184c8304b8

Let‚Äôs start with a confession.

I deployed an app last week. It works.  
I have no idea why.

That, dear reader, is vibe coding

No syntax checks. No deep-diving docs. Just vibes, GPT-4, and a vague sense of what I wanted. I prompted, copied, pasted‚Äîand boom. It shipped.

If that sounds chaotic‚Ä¶ well, it is. But it‚Äôs also kind of brilliant. And if you‚Äôve ever built a side project with one hand on ChatGPT and the other on your iced coffee, congrats‚Äîyou‚Äôre one of us.\\

# Where Did Vibe Coding Even Come From?

It didn‚Äôt exist a few years ago.

Back then, learning to code meant battling through Stack Overflow, debugging for hours, and building things line by painful line. You were expected to¬†*earn*¬†your code.

Then AI rolled in like a senior dev on too much caffeine

Copilot started auto-completing entire functions. GPT-4 started writing backend logic from scratch. Cursor let you talk to your code like it was your friend. Suddenly, junior devs could ship features in hours‚Äînot weeks.

And somewhere along the way, a new generation of programmers decided:

‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ what if I don‚Äôt¬†*read*¬†the code? What if I just‚Ä¶ vibe?‚Äù

# Thus, vibe coding was born.

# üßë‚Äçüéì Why Students Love It

Let‚Äôs be real: learning to code can be overwhelming. The documentation is dense. The error messages are cryptic. The tutorials assume you know what ‚Äúidempotent‚Äù means (you don‚Äôt).

    But vibe coding?
    It‚Äôs fast.
    It‚Äôs fun.
    
    It works‚Ä¶ most of the time.

There‚Äôs no pressure to be perfect. No shame if you don‚Äôt know the difference between a reducer and a middleware. You‚Äôre moving fast, building things, and getting that sweet dopamine hit every time something runs.

And honestly, it‚Äôs addictive.

# ‚ò†Ô∏è Is It Dangerous?

Short answer: yes.  
Longer answer: also yes, but kinda worth it.

Vibe coding is like driving with GPS in a foreign language. It gets you there‚Äîbut if it breaks, you‚Äôre cooked.

If you copy-paste too much GPT code without understanding it, you risk:

* Security issues
* Bugs you can‚Äôt debug
* Interview flops where you blank out when asked ‚ÄúSo, how did you implement this?‚Äù

Also, AI sometimes just makes stuff up. (No, there is no ‚ÄúReact.spaghetti()‚Äù method. Yet.)

So yeah‚Äîit‚Äôs risky. But it‚Äôs also real. And it's not going away.

The smart vibe coder learns to treat AI like a¬†*partner*, not a crutch. You let it drive, sure‚Äîbut you‚Äôre still watching the road.

# Final Word

Vibe coding is the wild west of software engineering right now‚Äîand you're one of the cowboys.

Don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment. Don‚Äôt feel bad if you don‚Äôt understand every line. Just keep building. Keep learning. And if the code breaks?

# What is Mehow - 10 Second Sexual Attraction 2.0?

So what *is* this thing with the wild name? **Mehow - 10 Second Sexual Attraction 2.0** is a step-by-step system designed to help guys spark attraction with women fast‚Äîlike, ridiculously fast. We‚Äôre not talking awkward pickup lines or endless routines here. This course promises a ""natural"" way to approach and connect with women in as little as ten seconds. Yeah, you read that right: **10 seconds**. Sounds like something out of a movie, but Mehow breaks it all down.

# Who‚Äôs Behind This & Who‚Äôs It For?

The brains behind this is Mehow, a well-known figure in the dating and seduction scene. If you‚Äôve ever dipped your toe into the world of PUA (Pick-Up Artist) stuff, chances are you‚Äôve heard of him. But this isn‚Äôt old-school, cheesy pickup stuff. It‚Äôs actually more psychological and social.

This course is designed for any guy‚Äîwhether you're totally new to approaching women or you've been out in the field before but need to level up. Whether you're looking to date casually or find ""the one,"" this program says it's got your back.

# Where Can You Use This Stuff?

Honestly? Anywhere. That‚Äôs one of the things Mehow emphasizes in **10 Second Sexual Attraction 2.0**‚Äîthis isn't about creating a fake personality or acting out complex routines. It‚Äôs about understanding how real attraction works and applying that anywhere: a coffee shop, bar, gym, you name it. It‚Äôs versatile. No weird ‚Äúgame‚Äù needed.

# When Does It Start Working?

The hype is that it can work *immediately*. Sounds wild, right? But here‚Äôs the idea: by learning the fundamentals of attraction and behavioral triggers, you can create a spark fast‚Äîwithout overthinking. The goal is to skip the awkward small talk and jump right into a vibe that feels flirty and magnetic. And judging from the infield footage included (yup, real-life examples), it‚Äôs not just theory. You get to see it in action.

# Why Is This Even a Thing?

Because, let‚Äôs face it, modern dating is confusing. Apps, ghosting, mixed signals‚Äîit‚Äôs a mess. **Mehow - 10 Second Sexual Attraction 2.0** offers a simple, repeatable system that cuts through all that. It's for guys who are tired of memorizing long-winded scripts or getting stuck in the ‚Äúfriend zone‚Äù because they didn‚Äôt act fast enough.

And get this‚ÄîMehow‚Äôs system is so effective, he even asks you to agree to a *non-disclosure agreement*. Yeah, he‚Äôs that serious about keeping it exclusive.

# How Does It Work?

Mehow teaches specific ‚Äúmicro-attraction‚Äù techniques that make women *feel* something from the jump. It‚Äôs less about what you say and more about *how* you say it. There‚Äôs a strong focus on body language, vibe, and a kind of emotional escalation that flies under the radar but hits deep. There‚Äôs also a ton of infield video so you can actually *see* what he‚Äôs doing.

Oh, and it‚Äôs not just about picking up girls. The program dives into how to build real connections and meaningful experiences‚Äîif that‚Äôs your goal. Basically, it grows with you.

# Final Thoughts

If you‚Äôve been burned by the ‚Äúgame‚Äù before, or just don‚Äôt feel confident approaching women, **Mehow - 10 Second Sexual Attraction 2.0** might be your jam. It‚Äôs practical, visual, and doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre becoming a robot. Whether you're looking for short-term flings or long-term sparks, this system offers a blueprint that‚Äôs fast, real, and surprisingly respectful.

**What is ‚ÄúJessica J ‚Äì Speak To Spark Arousal‚Äù All About?**  
Alright, let‚Äôs get straight to it. *Jessica J ‚Äì Speak To Spark Arousal* is a course designed for men who want to deeply understand the psychology of female attraction‚Äîand not in a cheesy pickup-artist way. This isn‚Äôt about cheap lines or tricks. It‚Äôs about unlocking a woman‚Äôs deeper desires through conversation. Yep, words. The program teaches how to say things in a way that bypasses logic and hits that primal part of her brain where attraction really happens. The goal? Get her to *feel* you, not just *hear* you.

**Who Should Check This Out?**  
If you‚Äôve ever had a great convo with a woman but it didn‚Äôt go anywhere‚Äîthis is probably for you. Or maybe you‚Äôve found yourself stuck in the friend zone (ugh) or constantly hearing ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a nice guy, but‚Ä¶‚Äù then *Jessica J ‚Äì Speak To Spark Arousal* might be the wake-up call you need. It‚Äôs for guys who want more than surface-level attraction, who want to actually turn heads and trigger that deep, can‚Äôt-help-it type of interest. No dating experience required‚Äîjust an open mind.

**When Should You Use This Stuff?**  
Honestly? Anytime you‚Äôre interacting with women‚Äîonline, offline, at the bar, on a date, even in a casual hangout. The beauty of *Jessica J ‚Äì Speak To Spark Arousal* is that it‚Äôs not about being ‚Äúon‚Äù all the time. It helps you build a natural, magnetic way of talking that creates tension, excitement, and curiosity without forcing anything. Think of it like learning a new social superpower you can turn on whenever you need to.

**Where Does the Magic Happen?**  
The skills in this course can be used pretty much *anywhere*‚Äîtexting, dating apps, real-life convos, even if you‚Äôre just DMing someone. The training isn‚Äôt location-bound. It‚Äôs mental. You‚Äôll learn how to handle common objections, flip friend zone scripts, and create sexual intrigue whether you're at a coffee shop or sliding into DMs.

**Why Is This Course So Different?**  
Here‚Äôs what sets *Jessica J ‚Äì Speak To Spark Arousal* apart: it doesn‚Äôt treat attraction like a checklist. It‚Äôs based on psychology‚Äîspecifically how to activate what Jessica calls a ‚Äúsexual tripwire‚Äù in a woman‚Äôs mind. That means you‚Äôre not just getting random tips. You‚Äôre learning how to speak in a way that hits emotional and sensual buttons that most guys don‚Äôt even know exist. From using silences to spark tension, to planting vivid sexual ideas in her imagination, it‚Äôs all about *effortless seduction* without being pushy or weird.

**How Does It Actually Work?**  
Jessica breaks down the process into simple, digestible steps. You learn how to confidently approach women, what to say to make her *see you differently*, and how to guide the conversation from ‚Äújust talking‚Äù to ‚Äúshe can‚Äôt stop thinking about you.‚Äù There are also bonus modules‚Äîlike escaping the friend zone, and starting conversations naturally‚Äîthat make this course extra valuable. It‚Äôs practical, straightforward, and kind of eye-opening.

**Final Take**  
So yeah, *Jessica J ‚Äì Speak To Spark Arousal* is a solid pick for anyone who wants to level up their game‚Äînot with gimmicks, but with actual, powerful communication. If you're ready to ditch awkward convos and step into a more confident, magnetic version of yourself, this course might just be your new secret weapon.",1,1745222148.0,TepuLearning,1,1.0,False

Let‚Äôs start with a confession.

I deployed an app last week. It works.  
I have no idea why.

That, dear reader, is vibe coding

No syntax checks. No deep-diving docs. Just vibes, GPT-4, and a vague sense of what I wanted. I prompted, copied, pasted‚Äîand boom. It shipped.

# Where Did Vibe Coding Even Come From?

It didn‚Äôt exist a few years ago.

Back then, learning to code meant battling through Stack Overflow, debugging for hours, and building things line by painful line. You were expected to¬†*earn*¬†your code.

Then AI rolled in like a senior dev on too much caffeine

Copilot started auto-completing entire functions. GPT-4 started writing backend logic from scratch. Cursor let you talk to your code like it was your friend. Suddenly, junior devs could ship features in hours‚Äînot weeks.

And somewhere along the way, a new generation of programmers decided:

‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ what if I don‚Äôt¬†*read*¬†the code? What if I just‚Ä¶ vibe?‚Äù

# Thus, vibe coding was born.

# üßë‚Äçüéì Why Students Love It

Let‚Äôs be real: learning to code can be overwhelming. The documentation is dense. The error messages are cryptic. The tutorials assume you know what ‚Äúidempotent‚Äù means (you don‚Äôt).

    But vibe coding?
    It‚Äôs fast.
    It‚Äôs fun.
    
    It works‚Ä¶ most of the time.

There‚Äôs no pressure to be perfect. No shame if you don‚Äôt know the difference between a reducer and a middleware. You‚Äôre moving fast, building things, and getting that sweet dopamine hit every time something runs.

And honestly, it‚Äôs addictive.

# ‚ò†Ô∏è Is It Dangerous?

Short answer: yes.  
Longer answer: also yes, but kinda worth it.

Vibe coding is like driving with GPS in a foreign language. It gets you there‚Äîbut if it breaks, you‚Äôre cooked.

If you copy-paste too much GPT code without understanding it, you risk:

* Security issues
* Bugs you can‚Äôt debug
* Interview flops where you blank out when asked ‚ÄúSo, how did you implement this?‚Äù

Also, AI sometimes just makes stuff up. (No, there is no ‚ÄúReact.spaghetti()‚Äù method. Yet.)

So yeah‚Äîit‚Äôs risky. But it‚Äôs also real. And it's not going away.

The smart vibe coder learns to treat AI like a¬†*partner*, not a crutch. You let it drive, sure‚Äîbut you‚Äôre still watching the road.

# Final Word

Vibe coding is the wild west of software engineering right now‚Äîand you're one of the cowboys.

Don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment. Don‚Äôt feel bad if you don‚Äôt understand every line. Just keep building. Keep learning. And if the code breaks?

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and performance of a 9x12 area rug are steadfast by several key features, each contributing to its durability, comfort, and aesthetic appeal. Understanding these features is essential for choosing a rug that meets your specific requirements and provides long-lasting value.

**Material Composition:** The material of a 9x12 area rug significantly impacts its texture, durability, and maintainance requirements. Popular options include wool, known for its softness, resilience, and natural stain resistance; synthetic fibers like polypropylene and polyester, which offer affordability and ease of cleaning; and natural fibers such as jute and sisal, valued for their rustic charm and eco-friendliness. Each material presents different advantages and drawbacks in terms of wear, comfort, and appearance.

**Knot Density/Pile Height:** For woven rugs, knot density (measured in knots per square inch) is a crucial indicator of quality and durability. Higher knot densities generally signify a more intricate and resilient rug. pile height, conversely, refers to the length of the fibers that make up the rug's surface. Lower pile heights tend to be more durable and easier to clean, while higher pile heights offer a plusher, more luxurious feel.

**Construction Type:** Area rugs can be constructed using various techniques, including hand-knotted, hand-tufted, machine-made, and flatweave.Hand-knotted rugs are the most labour-intensive and valuable,offering exceptional detail and durability. Hand-tufted rugs provide a similar aesthetic at a lower price point. Machine-made rugs are the most affordable and consistent in design, while flatweave rugs offer a low-profile, reversible option.

**Design and Pattern:** The design and pattern of a 9x12 area rug play a crucial role in its aesthetic appeal and ability to complement your decor. Options range from traditional persian and Oriental designs to modern geometric patterns, abstract motifs, and solid colors. The choice of design should align with your personal style and the overall theme of your room.

**Backing Material:** The backing material of an area rug provides structural support and prevents slippage. Common backing materials include cotton, jute, and synthetic latex. Synthetic latex provides excellent grip and prevents the rug from moving, while jute offers a natural and eco-kind alternative. The quality of the backing material contributes to the rug's longevity and safety.

**Colorfastness and Stain Resistance:** A high-quality area rug should exhibit excellent colorfastness, meaning that its colors will not fade or bleed over time, even with exposure to sunlight or regular cleaning. Stain resistance is also a crucial factor,particularly for rugs placed in high-traffic areas or households with children and pets. Look for rugs treated with stain-resistant finishes or made from inherently stain-resistant materials like wool or polypropylene.

Key features of the best 9x12 area rugs include:

* High-quality construction
* Durable materials
* Attractive design
* easy maintenance

## Core Benefits

Investing in a 9x12 area rug offers a range of practical benefits that enhance both the comfort and aesthetic appeal of your home. These benefits extend beyond mere decoration, contributing to improved acoustics, enhanced safety, and overall well-being.

**Enhanced Room Aesthetics:** A 9x12 area rug can instantly transform the look and feel of a room, adding warmth, color, and texture.By anchoring furniture arrangements and defining spaces,it can create a more cohesive and inviting atmosphere. For instance, in a large living room, a well-chosen rug can tie together the sofa, chairs, and coffee table, creating a focal point and defining the seating area.

**Improved Comfort and Warmth:** Area rugs provide a soft and comfortable surface underfoot,making them ideal for bedrooms,living rooms,and play areas. They also help to insulate the floor, reducing heat loss and creating a warmer and more inviting environment, particularly during colder months. Walking barefoot on a plush area rug is a simple pleasure that can significantly enhance your comfort at home.

**Noise Dampening:** Area rugs can effectively absorb sound, reducing echo and noise levels in a room. This is particularly beneficial in apartments, homes with hardwood floors, or spaces with high ceilings. By dampening sound, rugs contribute to a more peaceful and relaxing environment, making them ideal for bedrooms, home offices, or media rooms.

**Floor Protection:** Area rugs provide a protective barrier between your furniture and flooring, preventing scratches, dents, and other types of damage. This is especially vital for delicate hardwood floors or expensive tiles. By protecting your flooring, rugs can help to maintain its value and extend its lifespan, saving you money on repairs or replacements in the long run.

**Increased Safety:** Area rugs can improve safety by providing a non-slip surface underfoot, reducing the risk of falls and injuries.This is particularly critically important for households with young children or elderly individuals. Look for rugs with non-slip backings or use a rug pad to provide additional grip and prevent movement.

## FAQs Section

**What size rug pad should I use with a 9x12 area rug?**
A rug pad should be slightly smaller than the rug itself,typically leaving a 1-2 inch border around the edges. For a 9x12 rug, an 8'10"" x 11'10"" rug pad would be ideal. This prevents the pad from being visible and ensures that the rug lies flat and securely.

**How often should I clean my 9x12 area rug?**
Regular vacuuming, at least once a week, is essential for maintaining the cleanliness of your area rug.Professional cleaning is recommended every 12-18 months,depending on the level of traffic and soiling. Spot clean any spills or stains immediatly to prevent them from setting in.

**Can I use a 9x12 area rug on carpet?**
While it's generally not recommended,you can use a 9x12 area rug on carpet if necessary. Choose a low-pile rug to avoid creating excessive height and potential tripping hazards. Use a rug pad specifically designed for carpet to prevent slippage and protect the underlying carpet.

**What is the best way to prevent my 9x12 area rug from slipping?**
Using a high-quality rug pad is the most effective way to prevent your area rug from slipping. Look for a rug pad made from natural rubber or felt with a rubber backing. These materials provide excellent grip and prevent the rug from moving, even on hardwood or tile floors. You can also use rug tape or corner grippers for added security.

1k47vya,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1k47vya/watu_wa_nairobi/,Watu wa nairobi,"I remember back when I was young. My relatives from Nairobi would come to visit us from time to time. Wangekuja na their fancy things and their peculiar habitsüòÇüíÄ. 

I remember them coming with their fancy cars and phones and Bluetooth speakers and headphones and all that. To me it was all new. Their visits were very anticipated particularly because they brought gifts

I remember this one time me aunt came. She had been in South Africa for like a month. She brought candy she had bought at the airport. It tasted horribly but it was from South Africa so it didn‚Äôt really matter. I remember going to school the next day happy that I‚Äôd get to show it off. The next time she visited us she brought two dvds. They each had season ones of atla and korra. To date it‚Äôs the best gift I‚Äôve ever received.

Then their strange habits. Sisi tumezoea chai na mkate in the morning. Then my cousins from Nairobi came. They want to have breakfast at noon. Na breakfast yao ni juice and sandwichesüòÇ. I remember thinking they were weird. They aren‚Äôt even having it inside the house, no. They wanted to have a picnic outside. 

Then usiku inafika and instead of the conventional supper then everyone sleeps, wao wanataka bonfire till morning na nyamachoma. Alafu there‚Äôs the music these people would listen to. Fancy music from abroad. The likes of cartiüòÇüíÄAnd these people never used to stay for more than a week and if they did ujue kuna shida mahali.


All in all it was fun getting to experience life on the other side for a minute there. Then my brother joined them when he joined campus. He used to come unannounced. He‚Äôd bring a lot of snacks though. Pretty sure kama si yeye I wouldn‚Äôt have seen things like urban bites until I joined highschool. He brought with him very weird habits too. It was around the time he had started doing tiktoks too. He was very popular too. 

In Nairobi it‚Äôs very normal kupata watu wakirecord tiktoks nje but here, no no. My parents walikuwa wanaangalia while he‚Äôs making tiktoks thinking he‚Äôs gone insane or sum. And then there‚Äôs his phone. His prized possession. With a fruit in the back. Back then sikujua what that was but apparently it was a big deal. 

And now to think that I‚Äôm one of them. Crazy right. Right now I‚Äôm outside having breakfast and supper at the same time since I didn‚Äôt eat yesterday, supper Ilikuwa chicken and I‚Äôm having coffee (it‚Äôs a habit I‚Äôm trying to stop) while I‚Äôm listening to Kanye‚Äôs whole discography in order album by album so you can imagine how life‚Äôs going. I‚Äôm guessing nitarudi Nairobi in a day or two. I just had to take a minute to appreciate how much life has changed since then.",6,1745221383.0,nairobi,2,1.0,False

What Kaneki needed nerfed:

-Vault speed

-Aim assist (Fixed in patch)

-Reduced reticle (Fixed in patch)

-Fixing the bug where he could M1 right after a vault/leap

-Yamori's mask revealing survivors even if they're in lockers

-Collision when using leaps (Getting stuck/losing momentum for no reason)


What Kaneki didn't need nerfed:

-Losing a token after breaking a pallet. (Something no other killer, even S tier killers like Blight, have.)

-Reduced range

-With the exception of coffee (Which should be rare add-on at most), 2 of his actually useful add-ons made useless. 


Changes that were fine:

-Yamori's mask getting a range

-Rage timer reduced to 40s

**Discovering ‚ÄúNick Ortner ‚Äì 7 Weeks to Financial Success & Personal Fulfillment‚Äù**  
If you‚Äôve been stuck in a cycle of financial stress or personal dissatisfaction, you might want to take a closer look at *Nick Ortner ‚Äì 7 Weeks to Financial Success & Personal Fulfillment*. This course promises a transformation‚Äînot just in your bank account, but in your mindset and daily life. Let‚Äôs break it all down, blogger-style, and see if it lives up to the hype.

**Who Is This Course For?**  
This one‚Äôs for the dreamers, the go-getters, and especially the overwhelmed. Whether you're trying to fix your relationship with money, find your purpose, or just feel *less stuck*, Nick Ortner's course offers a toolkit for change. It‚Äôs great for entrepreneurs, creatives, and even corporate folks who feel like they‚Äôre meant for more but don‚Äôt know how to get there.

**What Is It Exactly?**  
*Nick Ortner ‚Äì 7 Weeks to Financial Success & Personal Fulfillment* is a guided personal development journey, divided into 7 core modules. Each week targets a specific mindset block‚Äîlike procrastination, fear, or self-doubt‚Äîusing Nick‚Äôs signature approach: **EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques)**, also known as tapping. This isn‚Äôt your typical ‚Äúrah rah‚Äù motivational course; it‚Äôs a hands-on, *feels-like-therapy* kind of experience.

**When Does the Magic Happen?**  
You work through the course over‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äî**7 weeks**. Each module drops weekly and builds on the last, giving you time to process, reflect, and integrate. You don‚Äôt have to rush through it; actually, slowing down is part of the process. By the end, you're not just thinking differently‚Äîyou‚Äôre *feeling* and *acting* differently too.

**Where Does It All Take Place?**  
It‚Äôs 100% online, baby. You can do it from your cozy couch, your favorite coffee shop, or even on your lunch break. All the modules, bonus classes, and resources are available in a members-only portal. You also get access to community support, which is a big plus if you like being around like-minded folks.

**Why Should You Care?**  
Because money isn‚Äôt just numbers‚Äîit‚Äôs energy, emotion, and deeply personal history. This course doesn‚Äôt just teach you how to budget or hustle harder. It digs into your **beliefs, past experiences, and emotional blocks** that are quietly sabotaging your success. If you‚Äôve tried all the logical stuff and still feel stuck, this emotional approach might be exactly what you need.

**How Does It Work?**  
Each week, you go through a specific module:

* **Week 1**: Overcoming overwhelm (perfect for clearing mental clutter)
* **Week 2**: Getting clear on what you really want
* **Week 3**: Silencing that annoying inner critic
* **Week 4**: Healing your money story from the past
* **Week 5**: Ending the vicious cycle of procrastination
* **Week 6**: Building confidence and visibility
* **Week 7**: Dreaming bigger‚Äîwithout fear

Plus, there are bonuses like deep-dive classes and Q&A sessions to keep the momentum going.

**Final Thoughts**  
In a world of flashy financial advice and empty promises, *Nick Ortner ‚Äì 7 Weeks to Financial Success & Personal Fulfillment* stands out by doing the inner work. It‚Äôs about aligning your head, heart, and habits so that success (however you define it) becomes natural. If you‚Äôre ready to stop spinning your wheels and start moving with clarity, this might be your next best investment‚Äîin yourself.",1,1745220781.0,JapieLearning,1,1.0,False

1k47lco,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1k47lco/i_think_something_is_living_in_my_house_or_im/,I think something is living in my house... Or I'm going crazy.,"I don't even know where to start. I'm typing this at 1 AM because I am terrified and I have nowhere else to turn. I just moved into my first real house two months ago. I've lived in trailer homes my whole life until now, so I was excited to finally have a standalone house. It's nothing fancy, but it's mine and I was proud... at least, I was. Now I'm living a nightmare and I feel like I'm losing my mind.

Everything was fine the first couple of weeks. Then about two weeks in, I started hearing footsteps at night. Not just normal creaks or house-settling noises (I know those too). I mean slow, dragging footsteps, like someone with a limp slowly shuffling across a floor. The first time I heard it, I was half-asleep and thought I imagined it. But then I heard it again the next night... and again. It always happens late at night, usually past midnight when everything is quiet. I swear it's coming from inside the house, like in the hallway or maybe the living room - I can't always tell exactly where, but it's definitely not from outside. And these footsteps are getting louder and more frequent. What started as maybe a weekly odd occurrence is now almost every single night. I lie here in bed, stiff as a board, listening to this slow thump... drag... thump... drag around my house. Sometimes it even WAKES me up (on the rare nights I manage to fall asleep at all). It's like it knows when I'm drifting off and it wants me awake and afraid.

I have OSDD (a dissociative disorder, kind of like a mild version of DID) and narcolepsy. Yeah, I know, that might make you think I'm hallucinating or something. But I've lived with these conditions for years and I've NEVER experienced anything like this. My narcolepsy does cause weird dreams and occasional sleep paralysis hallucinations, but this is nothing like that. These footsteps? I'm wide awake when I hear them. I can move, I get up and check every time. And my dissociative disorder means sometimes I have ‚Äúothers‚Äù in my head (my system), but none of them have ever done things without me knowing or hearing about it after. Plus, all my parts of me are just as freaked out ‚Äì actually, they‚Äôre quieter than ever. (If you don‚Äôt know OSDD: basically I have multiple selves; usually I never feel truly alone in my mind. But right now every single one of them is silent. It‚Äôs like even the voices in my head are scared to make a peep.) I‚Äôve been managing my mental health for a long time. I know what‚Äôs normal for me and what isn't. This is not coming from me. Something real is happening in my house and I don't know what to do.

Whenever I hear the footsteps, I gather every bit of courage to go investigate. I‚Äôll creep out of bed, sometimes armed with a heavy ass metal rod (I started keeping the thing by the bed), and every single time... EVERY SINGLE TIME... the sound stops immediately. The moment I open my bedroom door, there‚Äôs just this heavy, terrifying silence. Nothing ever looks out of place. I check all the rooms, the closets, under the bed, behind the shower curtain ‚Äì nothing. Doors and windows still locked. No one there. And yet I feel it. I feel someone (or something) watching me. It's like the hairs on the back of my neck stand up the second I step into the dark hallway. The feeling is so intense I sometimes can‚Äôt even call out or say anything ‚Äì my throat closes up with fear. I just feel... observed. Like I'm not alone, even though I can't see anyone. It‚Äôs a horrible feeling of dread that seems to get stronger each time it happens.

One odd detail: when I moved in, I noticed my bedroom door had a deadbolt on the inside. Like, not just a regular lock, but a deadbolt that only locks from inside the bedroom. I remember chuckling with a friend about it, like ""Haha, what were they scared of? Boogeyman gonna get them at night?"" Now I know why. I use that deadbolt religiously every single night now. As soon as evening comes, I'm locking myself in my bedroom. It makes me feel a tiny bit safer, but honestly I still can't really sleep. I just lie in my bed, listening. My heart pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears. Some nights, I start sweating and shaking out of pure anxiety, just waiting for those steps. And God, some nights it gets worse: I'll hear this faint tap... tap... tap on my bedroom doorknob. Like lightly, almost playfully trying the handle. The first time I heard that tapping,  It was so soft, like whoever (or whatever) was out there was deliberately being gentle, almost teasing. One time I deliberately clapped my hands once, really loud, and the tapping stops immediately. And of course, when I finally get brave enough to yank the door open... no one. Nothing. Just my own empty house staring back at me. It's like it's toying with me. I can't explain how horrifying it is to hear your doorknob quietly rattling as if some creep is right outside, and then find absolutely no one.

It‚Äôs not only sounds. Lately, I‚Äôve been noticing things moving or changing places around the house. At first I doubted myself ‚Äì I have narcolepsy, maybe I groggily placed something somewhere and forgot? Or my OSDD made me lose time? But I have never had issues with sleepwalking, and with OSDD I generally remember what happens (I don't have big memory gaps like DID). And these things are too deliberate to be me spacing out. Example: I always, ALWAYS put my keys on the little hook by the front door. I'm super OCD about it because I'm forgetful and I hate losing my keys. A few weeks ago, I went to grab my keys from the hook ‚Äì and they weren't there. I freaked, obviously. Eventually I found them on the kitchen counter. I NEVER put my keys on the counter, ever. I literally make a point to hang them up as soon as I walk in. I felt uneasy but shrugged it off, like maybe I was just distracted that day. But it kept happening. Twice now, I've found my keys in odd places I know I didn't leave them. The second time, they turned up on the coffee table in the living room. I had 100% hung them on the hook earlier, I remember doing it, yet there they were on the coffee table in the morning. I live alone ‚Äì there's no roommate or partner who could be moving them as a prank.

Another thing: I came from from Easter Lunch with my dads side of the family yesterday, and found one of my kitchen cabinets wide open. I never leave cabinets open. I'm actually kind of anal about closing them (it was a rule growing up that you never leave a cabinet or drawer hanging open, and it stuck with me). Yet there it was, open. Nothing missing from it that I could tell. It just... was open. As if someone had been looking through my stuff. That sent a chill down my spine like none of the other things, to be honest. The idea that someone might have been in my house while I wasn't there... I literally dropped everything and searched every inch of the house with a kitchen knife in hand. Checked every window (all locked), door (still locked), cheked under the sink and in every single drawer, under all the furniture. Not a single sign of a person. After that, I installed those cheap little door/window alarms that go off if opened. So far they've never tripped. Whatever is moving things doesn‚Äôt seem to use doors or windows... or it‚Äôs not a person at all. I don‚Äôt even know which thought is scarier and that's also why I'm deciding to post this HERE. If you have any better places I should post this, please let me know.

Oh yeah another thing, light switches, I've had this happen so many times, i used to discount it because light switches are actually one of the things I'd often struggle to remember, if i did or didn't, but no, HELL FUCKING NO, for some context, I have a garage, it's door locks, inside the garage is a light switch, duh.

So picture this, I turn the light off in the garage after I bring my lawnmower in after mowing, I lock the door, I don't have a car so I have no reason to open it, ever, so picture how fucking SUPRISED I was when my dad let me know I left my garage light on when he stopped by to give me some clothes I accidentally left at his house. 

There
Is
No
Way
I
Turned
That
Light
On.

PERIOD.

I also have smart lights in my room, and they often fucked up even back when I had them in my last place, so until the garage incident I never like actually cared, basically sometimes I'd wake up and the lights would be on, usually thats caused by them briefly disconnecting from the router and resuming previous state, but like I made a horrifying realization, you can achieve the same result by simply flipping an on switch back off and then on again, as they default to on even if you turned the bulb off in your phone.

It's been escalating. What started as a creepy footstep every few nights has turned into footsteps every night, plus tapping on my door, plus objects being moved or tampered with more and more often. It's like... it's building up to something. I have this awful feeling that I'm being watched constantly, especially at night, and that this thing (or person?) is getting bolder. Maybe it‚Äôs been there the whole time, hiding, and now that it's comfortable it‚Äôs messing with me more openly. The dread I feel is only getting stronger each day. Inside my own home, I no longer feel safe at all. I don't even feel alone. And I don't mean that in the ""I have OSDD so I'm never alone in my head"" way. I mean I feel a presence here with me. When I'm in the house, especially in the dark, it's like there's eyes on me. I can't explain it but I know I'm not imagining that sensation. Even my dog (I didn't mention, I have a small dog) has been acting weird‚Äîokay, actually scratch that, I don't have a dog, I am that on edge that I keep wishing I had a dog because at least I wouldn‚Äôt be the ONLY BREATHING THING HERE.

I haven't told anyone in my real life about this because, honestly, what the hell do I even say? ""Hey, I think my house might be haunted or someone‚Äôs sneaking in""? I feel like people will either think I'm crazy or tell me it's just my narcolepsy/dissociation acting up. But I know it's not. This is external, it's real. I thought about calling the police a couple times when I was absolutely convinced someone was in the house. But what am I going to tell them when they show up and find nothing? And if there is actually someone hiding here, I worry calling the cops might tip them off or anger them if they somehow know I did. Same with installing real cameras ‚Äì I did buy a couple of cheap security cameras but I'm almost too afraid to set them up. Like if I do, will that provoke whoever or whatever this is? If it's a person, maybe they'll notice the cams and freak out on me. If it's... something else (I can't believe I'm even considering ghosts or whatever, I'm pretty skeptical normally), I have no idea how it would react. Part of me wants proof so badly ‚Äì proof I'm not nuts ‚Äì but I'm also terrified of actually capturing proof, if that makes sense. What if I see something and it's worse than I ever imagined? What if there really IS someone living in my walls or some shit? I don't know. I feel paralyzed with fear and indecision.

Meanwhile, I can‚Äôt keep going like this. I'm running on maybe a couple hours of sleep a night, if that. I dread nighttime because I know the second it gets quiet I'm going to start hearing those slow footsteps or that faint tapping. I find myself holding my breath, straining my ears for any hint of sound. It's like torture. I just want to sleep, but every little creak makes my heart jump. I sometimes just sit in the corner of my bedroom clutching my bat, deadbolt locked, just listening for hours. My own home feels like a trap or a hunting ground and I'm the prey. I don't feel safe anywhere anymore, and it's not like I can just break my lease. This was supposed to be my escape from my rather abusive family, but now I'm walking around my own place constantly on edge, jumping at shadows.

Also like it's not just in those categories of noises, I've heard multiple different assortments of noises, those are just the most frequent and identifiable, noises I'm absolutely fucking certain I've heard. It's only happened once so I'm not making it a big deal, but I swear someone said my name in my house once, like I heard a whisper from two rooms over.. Somehow. I think that's just my paranoia at that point, but it scares me nonetheless.

I have this gut feeling that whatever is here with me, it hasn't actually tried to hurt me yet. It almost feels like it's playing a long game of hide and seek or something. Hiding just out of sight, watching me panic. Sometimes I wonder if I'm part of some messed-up experiment. Or if I'm unwittingly living in a horror movie. But I fear... I seriously fear that it doesn't plan on staying hidden forever. That one day, maybe soon, I‚Äôll turn around and there will be someone (or something) standing there. Or I'll wake up at 3 AM (Fuckin clishe) and this time the footsteps will come right up to my door... or inside my room. Just me thinking about this actually is making me really, Really not okay.

I am desperate. I have never been this scared or felt this helpless in my life. I am exhausted, I'm terrified to live in my own home, and I feel like I'm one more sleepless night away from a nervous breakdown. I don't know what to do. Do I call the police? Do I install the cameras and just face whatever happens? Do I try to get a priest or something (I'm not even religious, but at this point I'll try anything)? Or do I just run and cut my losses, see if I can stay with someone for a while? I hate this. I waited so long to have a home of my own and now every night I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm not going to wake up in the morning, or worse, that I will wake up and something will be in the room with me and there's nothing I'm going to be able to do to defend myself

Stevia is¬†today¬†a¬†go-to¬†healthy sugar¬†alternative¬†that¬†offers¬†a sugar-free¬†lifestyle¬†without¬†compromising¬†on¬†taste. This blog¬†explores¬†the¬†benefits¬†of Stevia for weight loss, how it¬†supports¬†a balanced diet, and why it's a¬†top¬†choice¬†among¬†health-conscious¬†people.

# What is Stevia?

Stevia is a herb-based weight reduction sweetener which is derived from the leaves of the [Stevia rebaudiana plant](https://zindagistevia.com/stevia_rebaudiana_everything_you_need_to-know/?v=f9f0a42f293e). Stevia, unlike artificial sweeteners, is not manmade, and so it is a healthy sugar replacement for individuals desiring to decrease calories without having to ingest manmade ingredients.

The active compounds in Stevia, mainly Reb A (Rebaudioside A), provide intense sweetness without adding calories. Stevia is calculated to be 200 to 300 times sweeter than sugar but zero-calorie, making it an ideal option for anyone on a weight-reduction diet.

# Why Choose Stevia for Weight Management?

https://preview.redd.it/fwsyq4xzx4we1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16543b7753d5763027fb67c4e3efbdb1636120ff

**1. A Natural, Guilt-Free Sugar Replacement**

One of the biggest hurdles to eating healthy with Stevia is resisting the temptation of added sugars. Common sugar has empty calories that promote weight gain and other diseases. With the shift to Stevia, you can live a sugar-free life while not compromising on sweet flavors.



**2. Helps Cut Calories Without Sacrificing Taste**

Cutting calories is key to losing weight, but withholding sweetness can make weight loss diets feel too restrictive. Stevia for calorie control is the ideal solution, enabling you to reduce calories with Stevia and yet indulge in your favorite desserts.



**3. Aids in a Low-Carb Diet**

If you‚Äôre following a low-carb or ketogenic diet, Stevia is a low-carb sugar substitute that fits seamlessly into your meal plan. Unlike sugar, which spikes blood sugar levels, Stevia does not impact blood glucose, making it a safer alternative for people managing diabetes or insulin resistance.



**4. Zero Calories for Maximum Weight Control**

It's different from most other natural sweeteners, such as honey or agave, because it is actually a zero-calorie sweetener. It's different from most sweeteners that contain calories, even when you use them several times per day in your coffee, smoothies, or baked goods. Since it does not have calories, Stevia is a wonderful option for the person who is trying to monitor their weight while not sacrificing the sweetness, a wise addition to any weight reduction plan.



**5. Stevia Benefits for Gym Goers**

For regular exercisers, the benefits of Stevia for fitness are that it supports energy balance without increased sugar. In contrast to sports drinks filled with sugar that lead to energy crashes, [Stevia-sweetened beverages ](https://zindagistevia.com/stevia-recipes/?v=f9f0a42f293e)produce a consistent level of energy without bringing about increases in insulin.

# How to Incorporate Stevia into Your Diet

https://preview.redd.it/u3onnuomz4we1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=177848dc8476a56024c7bbc70dd252648a1805df

**1. In Your Coffee or Tea**

Refraining from sugar in tea or coffee is among the easiest ways of reducing daily calorie intake. Stevia is easily blended with hot as well as cold beverages, thus it is a great healthy sweetener alternative.



**2. In Smoothies and Shakes**

Most of the smoothies that are prepared commercially contain hidden sugars that add unnecessary calories. With the use of Stevia in healthy diet plans, you can make your homemade smoothies sweeter without extra calorie intake.



**3. In Cooking and Baking**

Stevia can be utilized successfully in a variety of recipes, such as cakes and sauces. Since it is much sweeter than sugar, you will need to adjust quantities proportionally. Most Stevia products come with conversion charts to make substitution easier.



**4. In Salad Dressings and Sauces**

Most salad dressings and sauces contain added sugars that increase calorie consumption. A pinch of Stevia will add sweetness without the guilt.



**5. In Sugar-Free Desserts**

Desserts are what the majority of us would always want to have, but sticking to your diet to ensure weight loss success is crucial. Stevia allows for the creation of sugar-free lifestyle habits without compromising on flavor.

# Debunking Myths About Stevia

**Myth 1: Stevia tastes bitter after Consumption**

Previous versions of Stevia had a slight bitterness in flavor, but new processing methods have eliminated the bitterness. [Reb-A, the purest form of Stevia](https://zindagistevia.com/product/zindagi-stevia-powder-stevia-sugar-200gm-natrural-sweetener/?v=f9f0a42f293e), has a clean, sweet taste with no bitterness.



**Myth 2: Stevia is Synthetic**

Unlike artificial sweeteners such as aspartame or saccharin, Stevia is 100% natural and derived from plant leaves, making it a safe and effective choice for those looking for a natural sweetener for weight loss.



**Myth 3: Stevia Causes Weight Gain**

There are those who believe that zero-calorie sweeteners lead to overeating. However, evidence suggests that Stevia for weight control decreases total calorie intake and does not increase it.



# Where to Buy Stevia?

If you are ready to embrace the benefits of Stevia, it is available in various forms, including liquid drops, powder, and granulated blends. You can¬†[buy Stevia online](https://zindagistevia.com/products/natural-sweetners/?v=f9f0a42f293e)¬†or at local grocery stores under various brand names.

1k47jg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/glasgow/comments/1k47jg2/litter_picking/,Litter Picking,"I wrote this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/glasgow/comments/1jv1gsh/litter_welcome_into_the_barras/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) a few weeks ago about the litter around Gallowgate, and as it got quite a nice amount of engagement, I wanted to update folk on what I‚Äôm doing to tackle the issue I complained about ‚Äî and hopefully encourage others to do the same. :)

So instead of just complaining to the internet and not doing anything about it, I signed up to the council‚Äôs¬†**Neighbourhood Improvement Volunteer**¬†scheme. Few days later, a guy from the council dropped off a nice new litter picker, hi-vis vest, and lots of bin bags. So, before work, I went outside and set about tidying up.

I spent about half an hour litter picking the sitting area and the grass patch in front of the Billy Connolly mural (approx. 40m x 60m), just as a testing ground ‚Äî I‚Äôve never litter picked or done this sort of thing before. To be honest, I was a wee bit embarrassed and worried that folk might give me bother, but no one batted an eyelid, and once I got going I didn‚Äôt really care. I had Frankie Boyle‚Äôs podcast on for entertainment.

Also, two wee ducks came by, sat on the edge of the grass, and kept me company throughout ‚Äî I thought that was nice.

The litter was mainly disposable vapes, packaging, cellophane, glass bottles, paper scraps, coffee cups, cans, and random bits of plastic packaging. No needles or anything like that, thank fuck.

Despite my initial scepticism, I actually found this exercise surprisingly satisfying and really, really fulfilling! Dunno what it is, but the act of picking stuff up and dumping it where it belongs ‚Äî in order to make a place look nicer ‚Äî felt like power on my part, despite knowing I‚Äôm cleaning up someone else‚Äôs mess. I do hope what I‚Äôm doing won‚Äôt be in vain (probs will be).

The guy from the council informed me that about 20k people are signed up to this, and groups in different areas organise litter picks every so often ‚Äî but apparently none for the Calton area. So, if anyone is interested in doing the same, I urge you to sign up and do a bit of good for this part of Glasgow. I‚Äôd be more than happy to meet up and clean up litter together sometime (I‚Äôve got my eye on that bit beside Ghinda cafe and Dovehill car park). With more than a single pair of hands, this place could be cleaned up in a day ‚Äî and hopefully it‚Äôll do the area and its citizens some good.

üê∞üì∏ **- Peter Rabbit Meet & Greet ‚Äì Fluffy Ears & Photo Cheers**  
üìç - [St Peter‚Äôs Church, City Centre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cmsxLTq6Y77XB9mW9)

Peter Rabbit is hopping into Derby and he‚Äôs bringing big ‚Äúaww‚Äù energy. Meet the little legend in person (well, in costume) with this free family-friendly event right in the city centre.  
Perfect for the kids, great for the photo album, and even better for dragging them off their screens for 10 minutes.

Walk-ins are fine but booking‚Äôs smarter if you want guaranteed bunny time.  
Hop to it.

Java Coffee in Mickleover is serving up heavyweight comfort with a side of heart. Whether you're in for a morning rescue brew or a full-on food hug, they've got you sorted:

* Full English that‚Äôll floor you (in the best way)
* Smoked salmon bagels with enough cream cheese to silence complaints
* Afternoon Tea that rolls deep with pork pies, cakes, and mini quiche

Everything‚Äôs served fresh, with that proper ‚Äúmade by someone who gives a toss‚Äù energy. Gluten-free? Covered. Kids box? Sorted. Add-ons? You bet your hashbrowns.

Java‚Äôs the kind of place that knows your coffee order before you do. Perfect for brunching with mates, bribing yourself after the gym, or hiding from the world with a tiffin and a brew.

‚òï Go once, and your toaster will start feeling insecure.

1k47i7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1k47i7u/i_thought_i_fell_out_of_love_with_my_husband/,"I thought I fell out of love with my husband. Turns out, I just forgot how to look at him.","For months, I lived with this quiet fear in my chest ‚Äî the kind you don‚Äôt talk about out loud, even to yourself. I started wondering if this was it. If we had quietly, gently stopped loving each other and just hadn‚Äôt admitted it yet.

We weren‚Äôt fighting. We weren‚Äôt cold. We were just‚Ä¶ gray. The spark was gone. The silence between us wasn‚Äôt tense ‚Äî it was hollow. Like we had both been replaced by polite, tired versions of ourselves, acting out the motions of a marriage.

I would look at him doing the most mundane things ‚Äî brushing his teeth, scrolling on his phone, folding laundry ‚Äî and feel nothing. No butterflies, no rush of warmth. Just numbness. And then I felt guilty for feeling numb. Because I remembered how I *used* to look at him. How I used to think he lit up a room.

Then one evening, while I was doom-scrolling in bed, I heard him laugh in the kitchen. Like a real, unfiltered laugh. It stopped me in my tracks. I hadn‚Äôt heard it in so long. I walked in to find him watching some dumb video on his phone ‚Äî something with a dog and a Roomba. He looked up at me with this big grin and said, ‚ÄúYou *have* to see this.‚Äù

And I swear‚Ä¶ it was like something cracked open. That stupid video, that smile, the way he reached for me without thinking ‚Äî it reminded me. *That‚Äôs him.* That‚Äôs the man I built a life with. The man who stayed up with me when I was sick. The man who held my hand in the dark when I was scared and made me coffee when I forgot to eat. He didn‚Äôt go anywhere. I just stopped *noticing* him.

So we sat down that night ‚Äî no distractions, no phones ‚Äî and had the kind of conversation we hadn‚Äôt had in forever. I told him how I‚Äôd been feeling, how scared I was that we were disappearing. And to my surprise, he teared up too. He said he felt it too, but didn‚Äôt know how to fix it. He thought I just stopped needing him.

Since then, we‚Äôve made it a rule: 10 minutes a day. No phones. No chores. Just us. Sometimes we talk. Sometimes we just sit together. Sometimes we dance in the kitchen for no reason. It‚Äôs not some grand solution, but it‚Äôs been enough to remind me why I chose him in the first place.

Love doesn‚Äôt always look like fireworks or deep passion. Sometimes it‚Äôs just choosing to see each other again ‚Äî really *see* ‚Äî in the middle of laundry piles and work emails and grocery lists.

And I do. I see him now. And somehow, I‚Äôm falling for him all over again.",81,1745219670.0,confessions,16,0.91,False

1k47i0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurreyBC/comments/1k47i0h/had_a_1hour_phone_conversation_with_john_aldag/,"Had a 1-hour phone conversation with John Aldag (Liberal candidate for Langley/Fraser Heights) yesterday.  Talked about his electoral history, new leadership under Carney, and the biggest issues this election","I got a hold of John Aldag last week, and I gave him a set of questions to respond to.  He said he could answer them in writing or explain them over the phone.  Although written answers are probably better for reddit, I wanted to get to know him personally and get a bit of back-and-forth going.  Being a Langley man myself, I was more concerned with how he'd try and work with the Township.  But since my riding now includes Fraser Heights and Aldag being a long-standing member of the Cloverdale community, I think it's wholly appropriate to post here.

I've shared my conversations with [MLAs, local councilors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Langley/comments/1g1hvwf/had_a_30_minute_phone_conversation_with_misty_van/), and [Tako van Popta here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Langley/comments/1jaer1w/had_a_45minute_meeting_inperson_with_tako_van/).  Someone from Aldag's campaign team saw me reaching out to him but Mr. Aldag got back to me pretty quickly on his own.  **TL;DR - I've basically bolded all the things he said.  He also made a short statement I put near the end of my post.**  **I'll do my best to share his responses to my questions (with my responses/reactions in parentheses)**:

* **He is in better health following an operation on his heart early this year.  Doorknocking has been good for his fitness.**
* **There were no all-candidate debates this election.  CPC candidates like Tamara Jansen and Tako van Popta have appeared at the Chamber of Commerce debates before, but did not commit this time around, likely leading to its cancellation.  There was a seniors' group meeting where candidates from multiple ridings showed up - but no CPC members.**  (This is a new page in the Conservative playbook to avoid debates in the name of ""knocking on doors where voters are less decided than debate audiences"" - it's an argument I heavily doubt, and Aldag doubts it too)
* **Was asked by David Eby to run as a candidate for the BCNDP in the provincial election.  Aldag wanted to focus on improving things under provincial jurisdiction - infrastructure, health care, education.**  (I think Aldag knew Trudeau was cooked and I'm sure it made his decision to leave federal politics a lot easier.  I joked how he probably would've won that seat as MLA had the provincial election occurred just two months later)
* **Campaigned for Kyle Latchford (Liberal candidate for Cloverdale/Langley City - former staffer under Aldag) and Nasima Nastoh.  When Nastoh withdrew from the race (health reasons), he was asked by the Liberals to run for this riding.**  (He is a far superior/accomplished candidate compared to Nastoh, but I don't think he had any intention of directly running until specifically asked to do so)
* **He always lived in Langley (his kids went to school in Walnut Grove), but his previous work prevented him from running for office in the same riding he worked in.  Compared to Cloverdale, he sees this riding as a bit more rural/agriculture-oriented, but sees common issues facing both communities.**  (I think the way the riding has been re-drawn actually makes this riding more suburban than ever - we just gained Fraser Heights and lost everything south of 40th Ave)
* **In a potential third term as MP, he promises continued work on infrastructure, housing, affordability, and climate change.  Sees a new focus on dealing with our relationship with the USA.**  (This was an answer I'm concerned with - I don't think Trudeau's Liberals did that great of a job with housing and affordability, and I'm starting to get the sense that a Carney government won't push the needle too heavily on the previous work being done in Ottawa)
* **He endorsed Chrystia Freeland in the leadership race because she called him first.  He fully supports Carney and aligns closely with his belief in fiscal conservatism.  When I pressed him on any potential belt-tightening in the budget, he did suggest there would likely be cuts in public service, but also cancelled subsidies to the oil and gas sectors.**  (This answer seemed a bit vague to me and I'm not sure what kinds of cuts we'll see to keep deficit spending to a minimum - I'll have to take a closer look at the party platform)
   * **He blames Poilievre for turning the carbon tax (something he supported) into political poison and will now focus on different environmental policies to combat climate change.**  (Both the Liberals and the BCNDP did what was politically expedient - it wasn't their fault the carbon tax became a hot potato, but they threw away good economic policy in the name of politics and I'm not happy with it)
* **When I asked him about the pharma/dental care programs set forth by Jagmeet Singh's NDP, he mentioned that the Liberals had pharma care promised early on in Trudeau's 2015 government.  I countered by saying that government also promised electoral reform.  He worked on that committee and blames the previous Conservative oppositions for questioning the integrity of the first-past-the-post system.  I asked ""what about now"" and he does** ***not*** **believe the current Liberals will focus on electoral reform.**  (This one really stings for left-leaning voters like me who might be forced to resort to voting *against* Poilievre rather than *for* Carney)
* **He said while Tako VP has been courting the immigrant vote, he has also hammered down on a message of fearmongering.  While safety and security are issues for voters, Aldag said any Conservative legislation would just get thrown out, likely for violating Charter rights.  Carney's new platform has a new commitment to more RCMP/CBSA officers, and more thorough inspections at our ports.**  (I think Tako VP has deeper connections with the Korean community here - a demographic that has just doubled in size because of the inclusion of Fraser Heights)
* **Wants to focus on accessibility - something he hasn't seen at all in Jansen or Tako VP.  As Cloverdale MP, Aldag had newsletters, town halls, coffee tables, pub nights, and pan-religious gatherings.**  (This is an A+ answer for me - I know a lot of people in Cloverdale who've disagreed with Aldag but praised his friendliness, accessibility and willingness to help others)
* **He has pledged to work with various levels of government as he has done previously.  He intends to work with both the TOL and Mayor Eric, the City and Mayor Nathan, and** ***also*** **Surrey and Mayor Brenda.  Aldag also has a close relationship with Eby's government and intends to have meetings with them too.  He says this is in stark contrast to Jansen and Tako VP, who have apparently** ***never*** **conversed with city councilors during their time in office.**  (He had some very strong words for Jansen, who does indeed seem like a nutjob but also a highly inaccessible one at that)
   * **He described his relationship with Woodward/Misty VP as cordial and professional.**  (If Aldag wins, it'll be interesting to see if Mayor Eric or MLA Misty go out and attack him like they've attacked the BCNDP - I'm not familiar with Surrey politics, but I'm sure Aldag has a very good relationship with MLA Begg)

So there it is.  There were a lot of talking points and he gave relatively direct answers to everything I asked him.  Do I agree with everything he said?  Not at all - I have issues with some of his responses and told him as such.  He comes with baggage, both good and bad.  Accessibility is a huge plus, though.  It took me over two months (and several emails) to get a hold of Tako VP during a time when there was no Parliament in session.

**I also gave him an opportunity to make a final statement to us redditors:**

**""In any democracy, elections are important.  Given the threats to Canada's financial well-being, and frankly our very existence as a sovereign nation as a result of threats coming from President Trump, I, like many residents with whom I've spoken, believe this is the biggest issue in this election.  And I believe Mark Carney is the only leader equipped to deal with the instability of President Trump's policies.  We have many other issues that a Liberal government will continue to address including affordability, housing, transit, transportation, security, climate change, and others, but the Liberal Party under Mark Carney will ensure that Canada's interests are protected from outside threats from the US, Russia and other countries so we can address our own domestic issues.""**

I'd love to hear other people's impressions of John Aldag, and I also encourage those in our riding to contact him.  He's a strong candidate who's well-liked by the community (even if they might not like his party).  I did not anticipate him running in my riding - he's now turned this into a two-horse race.  I've also had a brief contact with Holly Isaac (the NDP candidate) and am curious if people here want me to have a more in-depth Q&A with her.  I could also try reaching out to Tako VP again and see if he wants to do another thing like this.",15,1745219647.0,SurreyBC,4,0.86,False

I groan to myself, ignoring the sting- turning my attention back to my colleagues. A collection of men and women in similar professional robes and scrubs- five of us. 

I listen in, not ready to contribute much to the discussion. I glance at Amala, stood over the sink, giving our newest dilemma his first bath. He giggles with a buoyancy- squirming with joy in her arms as she wraps him in a towel. 

""*So...?* We've had serial killers before. What makes him different?"", Tony asks, tugging at her ponytail, tucking the strands of stray hair behind her ear in annoyance. 

""Well... you'd be surprised."", Reece mutters, jotting something in his notepad.

Silence...

""Here he is..."", Amala whispers, placing his tiny body on the same table we use to place our operating tools- cleaned ofcourse. 

He gazes at all of us with curiosity- with mercy ingrained in his very essence. He's not made to bring pain- I suppose he is made to defy expectations. 

He has his mothers eyes. Green, deep in their shade and latches on to your every thought. Flushed cheeks, dimpled chin. He's precious. 

""How many victims?"", I ask. 

""About 17."", Reece responds. 

""Kids?""

""I'd rather not say."", He sighs, ""Although most of the adults he *does* choose are *just* on the cusp""

""How does he get away with it?"", I ask, confused beyond belief. 

""Does it matter?"", Tony reasons. 

""I'd argue it does- there's a *chance* he won't- 50, 50, remember? We're forecasters- not fortune tellers"", John sighs, his eyes leaving his monitor. 

""Sadly, I get the predictions- I present them- that's it. So let's get to the hard part before time runs out and his mother wakes up"", Reece mutters

All eyes wander to the sleeping figure on the gurney. On the corner of our room. She's in a quiet rest- having just given every last part of her being to produce... him. It's a shame really. 

And being on this panel- It's the type of guilt that eats at you if you acknowledge it. So I don't acknowledge it.

""Well then. All in favor? He keeps his life?""

John raises a quick hand. To which- everyone glances.

""What? I knew I'd be the only one!"", John defends, ""wanted to give the little demon a fighting chance"", he shrugs, turning back to his monitor.

Turns out, no- he wasn't the only one. 

Amala- in favor. 

""Are we sure?"", I ask, watching Reece raise his own hand- joining the others. 

*Three - two*

""The predictions aren't set in stone- he *could* do great things. We owe him that chance."", Amala reasons, ""Besides... his mom is so sweet""

Also on a throw away because I know my dad is a reddit user.

Me (Nb19), my brother (FTM23), and my mother lived in a house with my dad for 18, 18, and 27(?) years respectively. My parents marriage ended in divorce [thank god it finally happened] about 3.5 years ago. Since then my dad has changed quite a bit. He seems less angry or he possibly has a longer fuse than he used to. He stopped smoking after 30 years and has been trying to get his physical health right. When I lived with him every other week after the divorce, for about two and a half years, he seemed like a real reasonable guy most of the time and some days he was okay enough that it made me forgive him a little.

Going further back in time to before my brother and I were born, about two years into my parents marriage and maybe 3 years into the relationship, my mother was already considering leaving. My mom came into their relationship at a really delicate moment in her life, I have no doubt that my dad charmed her and love bombed her in just the ways she needed, but we know how that goes. While I only know this from reading a journal of hers from then(sorry mom) it is obvious that she had little to no self worth and maybe she wanted the chaos? I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs not her fault of course. I don‚Äôt think she found any worth until she left him and discovered she could live without him. I don‚Äôt know if my mother considers herself to have been emotionally abused, but I wouldn‚Äôt doubt her for a second, though I don‚Äôt think he ever laid a hand on her.

For some reason my dad just couldn‚Äôt handle toddlers and there was no one to stop him putting his hands on us. Nothing with a fist or enough to leave a bruise. Just on the edge of wrong but still justified in certain scenarios if it wasn‚Äôt almost constant. Things definitely happened in public and in front of extended family, but no one said anything. But my mom decided that she wouldn‚Äôt let it happen anymore and threatened to leave when I was 5 (over 10 years into their relationship). 
I don‚Äôt know really how bad it was for my brother or really anything at all from inside my home until I was 5 or 6 and my brother would‚Äôve been 8-10. My first real memories of my brother were around this age and we were just fighting all the time, we have never gotten along well until recently. I remember actually very little until I was about 8 and 9, aka when the physical handling of me stopped. 
Sidebar: my age was probably not the only factor in him stopping. There was a brief case open with child services regarding my brother MH issues and I think that scared the shit out of him, or my mom scaring the shit out of him because of the non-zero risk that we would be removed.
Anyhow, by then my brother was becoming my brother, dealing with a lot of depression, anxiety, dysphoria and hallucinations. He landed in the looney bin 3 times within a year or two. I think this is the first time I saw my dad show compassion or acknowledgement of someone else having a bigger issue than him. 

My relationship with my brother grew very distant and we rarely spoke, it was always bickering which set my dad off, so we just didn‚Äôt talk most of the time. That house was just a nightmare, it was so tense all of the time and it was always my dad‚Äôs fault. Slamming doors, yelling and screaming, muttering under his breath, talking to himself, hitting things, breaking things. It was eggshells, always. But he was a scarily normal guy in front of others, the cherished saint at work, the perfect neighbor, the ‚ÄòI‚Äôd do anything to help‚Äô guy. Of course making me feel like it really wasn‚Äôt so bad and he was actually really nice, I was just making a mess of things. I was always too loud or too messy or too rebellious but let‚Äôs be so fr, I was just an AuDHD kid with only the ADHD addressed, and also just a kid.

I don‚Äôt know, even now, even in the years where it was just me and him for a week at a time, it was still eggshells. I had really poor attendance in this time because of physical and mental health issues. Shortly before my mom left I began the year and a half where I was in the looney bin 5 times and did a partial hospitalization program. I saw the side of him that I saw with my brother, like he finally shut the f up and realized he cares about me, but only when he‚Äôs at risk of losing me. Through crazy mental health stuff we kinda got closer and those are moments that made me forgive him a little. 

I have excepted that he is not going to be the person I need or deserve and that I can‚Äôt change the past, but I feel obligated to tell the whole truth to his fianc√© and her daughter(18).

There is no chance in hell my dad told her why my mom left and why their relationship was so tumultuous. My dad has actually said to me, ‚ÄúWhen your mom told me she wanted a divorce and we were talking about it she was bringing up stuff from like 10 years ago. She said I was angry and aggressive and took it out on her and you guys, I know what she is talking about [proceeds into a ridiculously mundane act of aggression, essentially punching a wall, but i‚Äôm omitting bc it‚Äôs severely identifying].‚Äù I was dumbstruck, almost laughing, almost crying, almost confronting him for the years of abuse. Does he not remember putting his hands on me? Does he really think that‚Äôs all he did? Is he lying to himself that much? 
If he can‚Äôt admit it to himself, he is not saying anything to her, especially considering that she has gone through abuse as a child and would not stand for that shit. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, in getting to know the fianc√©, they are made for each other. I think they are on the same wavelength about a lot of things and share a lot of‚Ä¶ questionable intricacies. 
I don‚Äôt want them to not get married, I don‚Äôt care, it is their lives and if both of them having had failed long term marriages, think they are good for each other, get hitched idgaf.
But at the same time, she has a right to know what she is getting herself into. She can certainly handle herself and would leave in an instant if she thought he was bad for her, but she has a daughter. This kid is immature to say the least. Not inappropriate behaviors or anything like that, just coddled and sheltered due to some things that have happened in her childhood. She is going to college in the fall but will live with my dad and her mom, in my dad‚Äôs house, over the summer. If her mother wants to subject herself to the realities of living with him, okay, but her daughter didn‚Äôt ask for this at all. I feel obligated to say something to one of them but where would I start? Is it just stirring up shit that doesn‚Äôt really matter? What if she doesn‚Äôt want to be with him after and then I lose a dad? I mean he doesn‚Äôt serve much in the fatherly role but he does pay for medical stuff sometimes and also has my childhood dog. I‚Äôm disabled to say the least and am already barely keeping my head above water while living with my fianc√© for the past 9 months.

I just really don‚Äôt know if i should say something or leave it alone? On one hand, not my circus not my monkeys, but on the other what if something regrettable happens and I could‚Äôve changed something by talking about this now. This is not a thought that has anything to do with the personality or person the fianc√©/daughter is at all. I was thinking about this before they met, what would I say to his wife if he got married again?
I‚Äôve thought about going to grab coffee with the fianc√© but I don‚Äôt even know what I would say to get my point across. They deserve to know, right?

tldr; My dad was POS to my mom, my brother and I for 18+ years and now that he is planning to get married again, should I let the fianc√© and her daughter know about his past actions?",1,1745217532.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

Seems like since that time I eventually ""snapped out of it"" and decided to something other than sit in front of a computer screen and occasionally do work. My memory isn't exactly great, but nowadays can barely remember things that happened yesterday.

Most times I CANNOT PAY ATTENTION whatsoever during lectures. (Not sure if it's important but I have ADHD) Even when I did remember to take meds seemed like it did absolutely nothing, feels like coffee is not keeping me awake whatsoever, and energy drinks making me sleepy, most times I feel tired, not sleepy, just tired, usually spend 5-7 hours sleeping. Plus the occasional very slight stomach pain, not enough to be a problem but enough to be annoying.

A lot of times my brain feels scrambled, like my brain is constantly switching topics. And about a couple weeks back, I've been having these occasional coughing fits.

Was recently doing like 2 college classes and already failed like one of them, (an intro physics class, wasn't understanding anything, I know I could ask the professor for help, but for some reason I just don't want to, even though I know I should and it's literally his job.)

Reflecting on the past, present and future and Cali's multiverse opportunities before all hell breaks loose.

This text is before Chapter 3.

Somewhere in the demon realm... in Maria's bedroom.  
Maria: I guess we're all here?  
Jonas: You got us protection from the demon world's ""outsider"" killing magic so I guess we are all here.  
Beatrice: You called us down here for a reason, why is that?  
Maria: I just want to talk... like... talk about our old classmates and friends from high school.  
Jonas: And from our childhood?  
Maria: Y-yeah... something like that.  
Beatrice: Then where do you want to start?  
Jonas: Mia?  
Beatrice: Oh come on Jonas... you always start with that.  
Jonas: Is there a problem, I think she's a great friend!  
Beatrice: Great as in making Andrew stress out in senior year.  
Beatrice: As with every single one of Andrew's love interests stalking him every day, bullying Ashley and spreading rumors to fuel a justification to date Andrew.  
Beatrice: Let alone inadvertently driving Julia into depression during her ""dates"" with Andrew.  
Jonas: You say that as if those dates were never actual dates.  
Beatrice: Well when has Andrew not been an abusive piece of shit behind the public eye?  
Maria: Like... never. Something is really off about him because he's been really stressed out over all the stalking incidents.  
Jonas: Didn't Ashley faint once trying to send death threats to every single ""hussy"" going after Andrew?  
Beatrice: She did, it was all over the news that day. Andrew kept denying the rumors to the press, but it failed.  
Jonas: Then why would Julia break up with Andrew?  
Beatrice: Apparently Andrew used her as practice grounds for Ashley... or something like that. I may never know the actual truth.  
Jonas: Didn't you say that she has a new boyfriend now?  
Beatrice: Yep... heard that they insult and laugh about Andrew sometimes.  
Maria: Weren't you and Jonas the reason that Andrew's public reputation is in the gutter now, even though he's still on the run?  
Beatrice: We had no choice. We needed to kick him out of hiding, even if it means he gets blacklisted on every companies hiring list.  
Beatrice: Ashley was also affected after we leaked her death threat calls to the public. She absolutely hates us for it but it had to be done.  
Beatrice: And no one gave a shit about Ashley despite companies putting her on every blacklist possible.  
Jonas: When the leak came out, it was headlines all over Scandinavia. Julia received many interview requests from the press, >!which Jane had to decline because it was overwhelming Julia!<.  
Beatrice: Ashley and Andrew's incestuous relationship was big news  
Maria: What about Nina's death? That was big news.  
Jonas: The investigation was closed. She's listed as dead but lives as a spirit.  
Beatrice: They had an insufficient amount of evidence that ended up being unusable.  
Jonas: And thus, the public didn't care afterwards. Nina is still insistent on getting Andrew back to see her resurrection...  
Beatrice: While Mikaela is still hellbent on being with him...  
Jonas: Mikaela... the girlfriend that betrayed me...  
Jonas: I still got nightmares of being in house arrest...  
Beatrice: I had to come over and keep you company at that time.  
Jonas: And look where that got us, dear.  
Beatrice: Mhm... I still love you, Jonas.  
Beatrice and Jonas kiss.  
Maria: Isn't it cute to see both of you as a couple?\~  
Jonas: Couple? I don't know... A bit too early to say that.  
Beatrice: Despite years of sex and love in our university years...  
Jonas: I know I know...  
Beatrice: Like... we sort of... umm...  
Jonas: Didn't you schedule your work hours to be the same as mine so that we could spend the evening together? I thought that was nice\~  
Beatrice: You still remember?  
Jonas: Still do\~  
Beatrice: Hehe\~ I still love him the same, even if we spend the same day at work.  
Maria: And kiss each other in the breakroom-  
Jonas and Beatrice: NO!  
Jonas: Okay we may have been flirting in the breakroom...  
Beatrice: But we aren't kissing until the shifts done.  
Jonas: What she said.  
Maria: Hehe\~ I made the right friends\~  
Beatrice: Still the devilish girl I know\~  
Jonas: So, back on topic, you met Mia again about 3-4 days ago?  
Beatrice: By chance. She was talking about how her ""Andy"" is the best husband she had.  
Beatrice: It was weird seeing more than one Andrew in existence but this was like... wow. She considered him as irreplaceable.  
Beatrice: I know how fucked up her history is but seeing Andrew with her... it worries me on what he will do to her...  
Jonas: Did you see any behavioral anomalies?  
Beatrice: He lacked any antisocial behaviors... only ones that seem to qualify for an obedient husband.  
Jonas: So you're saying Mia's Andrew is all but an obedient husk?  
Beatrice: I think so... he has a hint of murderous intent but I will never know why anyone likes hot murderers...  
Jonas: Murderous... intent... that doesn't sound good.  
Beatrice: Mia's had a rough childhood... give her a break.  
Beatrice: I've made enough jokes about her being famous in South Korea because a station on Line 4 is named after her.  
Jonas: Mia Station? Isn't that where the Cyber University is at?  
Beatrice: Yeah... that one. Mia hated me for it.  
Jonas: Or Mia tightly hugging Andrew after she found out about your ""incident"" with Andrew?  
Beatrice: Every single one of Andrew's love interests have hated me for that since then...  
Maria: Hey, he accused you of stalking Ashley and thought that the area we were at was private enough for him to ""remove"" the threat.  
Maria: But did you really have to beat him up that violently?! You nearly left him unconscious!  
Beatrice: He tried to beat me up so I retaliated in return! it's fair game-  
Maria: FAIR?! Jonas had to teach you to handle your violent urges afterwards!  
Jonas: I already taught her during our childhood to control her urges...  
Maria: Sierra and Samuel?  
Jonas: Sierra is Beatrice, Samuel is me. Her Family and I conditioned her to evoke a calming response to that name.  
Jonas: Me included... Though it will backfire if used in a taunting manner, or if specific people use it against her...  
Maria: I... You two are weird...  
Maria: Did you ever seek a therapist, Beatrice?  
Beatrice: No... Couldn't afford it.  
Maria: I- oh right... financial struggles in both of your families.  
Beatrice: We know... that ""Sierra"" and ""Samuel"" conditioning was the only way Jonas could keep me and him calm when one of us was close to snapping.  
Maria: And you never told me?  
Jonas: I didn't get a chance to tell you until now...  
Maria: Then what are her violent tendencies about?  
Jonas: It might have come from her early exposure to violent acts as a child.  
Maria: Violent acts?  
Jonas: Exposure to military culture and violent actions.  
Maria: That... doesn't make sense.  
Jonas: Basically believing that violence is the best answer to problems.  
Maria: What... the fuck. What about her incident with splitting up a fight during childhood?  
Jonas: Likely caused by it. She tried to settle it peacefully but ended up being beaten up in response. She ended up violently beating up those kids that started the fight and the principal forced her to apologize to her attackers.  
Jonas: It took until her final year in elementary school for the Principal to admit to his mistake but by then, the damage was already done.  
Jonas: At least she got to go to the aquarium on a personally paid school field trip by the Principal, unlike her attackers who caused the field trip to end early before they even reached the aquarium.  
Maria: Wasn't that the one where they took the kids to a local police station instead? Then returned to school with a bunch of disappointed kids and caused national headlines?  
Jonas: Yes... that one...  
Beatrice: It was actually funny seeing the kids that attacked me being disciplined by the police.  
Jonas: To you, it was. The parents? Traumatized.  
Beatrice: And I wasn't even on that bus at the time since I was stuck at school.  
Jonas: I know, we both were flirting in that empty classroom\~  
Maria: Good old childhood love\~  
Beatrice: But yeah... Those attackers finally got a short but deserved suspension and the school had increased police supervision for the rest of the school year.  
Jonas: What about in high school, did you meet them again?  
Beatrice: Nope, they went to another high school.  
Jonas: I see... your violent tendencies didn't flare up again until that ""incident"" that lead to so many of our classmates to start being attached to Andrew.  
Maria: And look where that brought us.  
Maria: I do believe that Cali may be behind all of this but it's hard to put a blame on her. Mikaela and Cali were very close friends in high school and University, with unexplained absences here and there.  
Beatrice: Something about Cali's family creating their own multiverse to store their wealth in and create their own ""utopia"" of sorts.  
Beatrice: I call bullshit on that.  
Jonas: We all share similar sentiments about that multiverse... something is really off about it.  
Maria: It's... too... perfect. I went there a few times out of curiosity. It's a futuristic medieval dream.  
Maria: Cali and her family rules the entire multiverse country with an iron fist, prohibiting Andrew and Ashley from forming any romantic relationship because ""it's wrong and shall be punished accordingly,""  
Maria: I did hear that they're destroying universes with any ending involving Andrew and Ashley having romantic ties, even those that became families.  
Jonas: Are we on their list yet?  
Maria: Endangered. They want us to stop Ashley and Andrew's reunion.  
Beatrice: Not happening, this isn't the same Andrew and Ashley that everyone has.  
Maria: As in? Different than others?  
Beatrice: When Mikaela forced her way into Andrew and Ashley's life, it completely upended how Andrew and Ashley were supposed to develop.  
Beatrice: Ashley and Andrew changed in ways that deviate from their original intentions, such as Ashley opening up to me about her insecurities and Andrew is merely an obedient husk that can't even overpower Mikaela...  
Beatrice: I trusted her back in high school with Jonas. Now? I wouldn't even dare let her spend a second with him.  
Jonas: Like I said... my betrayer...  
Beatrice: Who knows where they are right now... Northlake is struggling to track down those two.  
Beatrice: But anyways... back to talking about Mia... I did try to convince her to not continue dating Andrew but she ignored it.  
Beatrice: Though she did give me an invite to some sort of club in Cali's multiverse country.  
Beatrice: It was in Spanish... I couldn't understand what it was other than what the club was.  
Jonas: I couldn't translate it either.  
Beatrice: Whatever it is, she's waiting for me there.  
Jonas: It looks like she has a night club there. Heard she's the most popular police officer in the country.  
Beatrice: More like secret police.  
Maria: I did tell Beatrice that they're using state backed secret police to suppress anything that is considered ""pro-romance"" of Andrew and Ashley.  
Maria: I know that Mia is not part of it, she's more worried about Andrew than that.  
Jonas: Anyone else?  
Maria: None that I could identify. They could be everywhere. You wouldn't even know until you get arrested.  
Maria: Though I did catchup with Luna. She's been up on the observatory, looking at Cali's crafted night sky and field of stars.  
Maria: Her Andrew has been struggling to adjust without Ashley... something about ditching Ashley in an area dedicated to solely torturing them.  
Maria: There was a similar area nearby with all the ditched Andrew's. It was mostly empty, save for a few that were showing symptoms of severe depression.  
Maria: It was entertainment to the locals as they poorly treated those Andrew's and Ashley's. So much fighting and attempts for self harm, only to be revived again and continue to be tortured.  
Maria: If you look at the area with all the Ashley's ditched, it's a living battle royale... I can't even tell you how much of a nightmare that area is... it's endless hell.  
Maria: Luna said that she doesn't understand why her Andrew is acting weird and yearning for Ashley again. She's been trying to keep him busy with stargazing at this time.  
Beatrice: Or ensuring that a specific individual with Heterochromia doesn't escape to find their siblings?  
Maria: Alex Graves?  
Jonas: Who is that?  
Beatrice: Another Graves family member?  
Maria: Alex Graves is a lone survivor of her timeline. Her entire family got separated when they were pulled into Cali's universe and she was put into a high ranking position, far away from any of her surviving family members.  
Maria: I've been trying to locate her siblings, but to no avail. She's been coping with a copious amount of alcohol given by Cali's friends.  
Maria: If you've been getting no responses from me lately... I've been trying to get Alex to quit drinking. It's not working out well...  
Maria: She can't even return to her universe, it was wiped after grabbing all the necessary variants from that world. She's trapped in that multiverse forever.  
Beatrice: Christ... they separate ENTIRE FAMILIES?!  
Maria: Only at the complex, where everyone enters and exits the world. Only the privileged get a red carpet into the city.  
Maria: Even then, separation is all but inevitable. I saw an Ashley have their infant separated and given to a total stranger. It made my blood boil as I saw more and more of these Graves family separations.  
Beatrice: Was anyone else there?  
Maria: Our old classmates... Val, Ishmael, Elizabeth, Fiona... Everyone...

Jonas, Maria and Beatrice look down as they reflect on Maria's latest intel from Cali's Multiverse.  
The reality sinks in as they realize that their classmates and friends have betrayed them all. All for the joy of being with Andrew and Ashley.

Jonas: Are any of them wealthy?  
Maria: All of them, Cali's wealth has been growing to a point where her friends have been able to enjoy some of it.  
Maria: I trusted them... I trusted them as friends... they all ditched us for gold plated Andrew and Ashley's...  
Maria gives Jonas a photo from her final year in high school.  
Jonas: Is that... Mia?  
Maria: Prom Night. Sad that Beatrice decided to ditch Prom on that day...  
Beatrice: I'm not a party girl...  
Maria: Sure.... But you spent the entire night PLANESPOTTING?!  
Jonas: At least I was there for Mikaela on prom night.  
Maria: You and Mikaela stole the dance floor that night\~  
Maria: Meanwhile Beatrice being absent the whole time...  
Beatrice: . . . Is it wrong...  
Jonas: Beatrice. It's not wrong to be away from prom night and be planespotting instead.  
Jonas: You told everyone months before because you wanted to catch a photo of a rare Ilyushin IL-86.  
Maria shows the photo that Beatrice took that night, encased in a white colored wooden photo frame.  
Maria: And she got one, a very beautiful photo at sunset.  
Beatrice: My dad taught me how to take photos while I was in high school.  
Jonas: Nice.  
Maria puts the photo back on her bookshelf.  
Maria: At least you got that once in a lifetime photo.  
Beatrice: Yeah...  
Maria: Anyways... You wouldn't have believed that they were running advertisements in the city for their multiverse country.  
Maria: It seems that they have a portal hidden somewhere in the city, where all of their friends are encouraged to come to. Something about ""Fix the world as it was intended to be.""  
Beatrice: Wait a minute... that advertisement... I thought it was a joke.  
Maria shows a holographic replay of the advertisement.  
Maria: Unfortunately, it's real.

""The multiverse is home to our greatest project yet! The rewriting of Ashley and Andrew as it was intended to be! Oh the horrors! cannibalism! satanic rituals! It will all be there for you to experience!""  
""To those that tell us, ""will there be any sibling romance?"" NO! None of that! We seek to create a world without that hideous feature! I promise you, fellow Ashley and Andrew lovers! We will achieve the finest fix that no one has intended to do!""  
""Come, my friends! let us seek a newer world! one that is free of Ashley and Andrew's romantic ties! We will be waiting for you at (MULTIVERSE PORTAL ADDRESS)! So sign up today!""

Jonas, Beatrice and Maria: . . .  
Jonas: Is this why most of our friends were missing during our university years...  
Beatrice: So behind our backs, they start going after two psychopaths and then think that they can ""fix them"" in a separate and unique world.  
Beatrice: AND THRIVE IN THE SMITH FAMILY'S WEALTH?!  
Maria: It's a utopia by all means there. Cali is extremely popular and crime is all but nonexistent... except for the ""Coffin Area"" where everyone relives the events of Andrew and Ashley's apartment life, escape and end, except with them obviously inserting themselves into their lives, of course.  
Beatrice: Then why is there a police force there anyways?!  
Maria: A few bad apples here and there is why the police still exists. Mostly everyone behaves so the police force is very small.  
Maria: Only thing to worry about is the aforementioned secret police, which is weirdly only active in the ""ditching"" area for Andrew and Ashley.  
Beatrice: If all of our high school and childhood friends are there... then... are they watching us?  
Maria: They're too distracted with their Andrew's and Ashley's. No one is watching this world.  
Beatrice: Then... what can I expect there?  
Maria: Cali's multiverse has some technological advancements, about 20-30 years ahead of us.  
Maria: What they call ""social media"" in their world is very popular. The sharing of internet content and fast messaging services in one app.  
Beatrice: So futuristic tech in there...  
Jonas: Are there any robots in that multiverse?  
Maria: No... Except for a few Ashley and Andrew androids but those are usually for adult entertainment. They have no AI, just a complex script for every show.  
Maria: There is a robotic pole dancer at club Albright but that one has a deliberately handicapped AI to prevent sentience.  
Maria: Apparently they intend to use the robot for 24 hour livestreams. It's really popular in the country and Mia has been using it to promote her club.  
Jonas: So that's where we will find her?  
Maria: It's in the heart of the city in Cali's multiverse country, near Ellie Station.  
Jonas: What station exactly is it?  
Maria: Metro station, a vast subway network covers the entire city. Ellie Station is on the Baguette line.  
Beatrice: When all of this is over, how about we pay a visit to Mia and see what she's been up to?  
Maria: You two seem to have some relations to Mia... why is that?  
Beatrice: I still owe her for Helsinki after saving her life from a bunch of thugs.  
Beatrice: I was in university at the time and I went with her to Helsinki to spend the summer there, bunch of juvenile assholes tried to jump us and I held them off.  
Beatrice: I had to protect her about 8 times before they finally left us alone for good.  
Beatrice: If she's expecting me there, I expect her to be calling me in for a favor that I owed her for like... two years since that incident.  
Maria: How did you get to Helsinki in the first place if your financial situation was still a mess...  
Beatrice: I saved up enough money for it. Jonas stayed behind but gave me some of the money he won from the court's reversing his home arrest and letting him go free after finding the allegations against him to be false.  
Maria: And he missed the entire fall semester of university because of it, right?  
Jonas: Yes... it took 6 months to clear my name and Mikaela's family ended up paying our legal costs and $500,000 in financial compensation. Some of that money went to Beatrice for her Helsinki trip.  
Beatrice: I'm worried about what Mia wants me to do but... Whatever it is... When she calls it in, I'll try to do what she wants.  
Maria: You're expecting that the moment you see her?  
Beatrice: I am. She told me that she'll call it in at the club and have me do a favor for her.  
Beatrice: I will have to go there and find out for myself when the time is right...  
Maria: When that time comes, Beatrice. When that time comes...  
Jonas: Wait... Fiona... Beatrice you know her from the grade 8 retreat!  
Beatrice: Hm?  
Jonas: I remember hearing about her going into that portal! She wanted to have Andrew as her husband and Ashley for her friends wife!  
Beatrice: So some of them deliberately went down there to satisfy their own fantasies...  
Jonas: Which means we got a whole load of shit to deal with after we capture Andrew and Mikaela.  
Maria: Well... Fiona is having the time of her life right now. Luna is enjoying her time in the observatory and Hallie is uhh... trying to find Andrew and Ashley.  
Beatrice: Hallie? Who is that?  
Maria: One of those graves kids or something. Her Andrew and Ashley was separated and she's been wandering the city for months.  
Maria: A seven year old roaming the city, looking for their Andrew... and no one wants to take her up.  
Maria: Well... I did want to take care of her until we found her Andrew but... sigh... I had to leave her be or risk being caught.  
Maria: Last time I saw her, she was living in an abandoned daycare. She is emotionless and has a death grip on her green bunny plushie.  
Maria: And well...  
Hallie enters the bedroom.  
Maria: I took her in, I couldn't take it anymore with seeing her trying to find Andrew in these conditions.  
Maria: She needs her brother more than ever. She's been through enough shit in the multiverse and I can't leave her out there to be taken away by a stranger.  
Maria: What choice do I have? No one knows where her Andrew and Ashley are. They raised her, they need her back more than ever.  
Hallie leaves the bedroom.  
Maria: Sigh... She talks very little, only yearning to be back with Andrew...  
Maria: At least she's easy to take care of. She's been adjusting well to some of Quebec's finest cuisine culture.  
Maria: For the time being, I have to monitor her health. She was malnourished when I took her in and she seems to have been beaten up by multiple strangers.  
Maria: I even made a playroom for her to use while I learn to care for a graves kid.  
Beatrice: . . . Is there anyone else to note... I feel like after all of the Mikaela shit is done, we got a bigger problem to deal with.  
Maria: There was a harem that Andrew had with Ashley, Julia and their timeline's version of Nina.  
Jonas: The coffee addict?  
Maria: H-how did you know?!  
Beatrice: Hologram. Our Nina is hoping to have coffee every day once she is resurrected.  
Maria: . . . Did you tell her to not turn into a coffee addict?  
Beatrice: Nah I think she'll be fine.  
Maria: Then tell her to not overdo it on the caffeine intake. Like why does that Nina need THREE CUPS OF COFFEE PER DAY?!  
Beatrice: It's not like our Nina is going to do the same thing, she can control her need for coffee.  
Maria: . . .  
Maria: I'll believe it when I see it happen.  
Maria: But... ugh... anyways. That harem group managed to stay together and is currently living in the outskirts of the city. Lots of Ashley bickering and a tired Andrew.  
Maria: Only other thing are that family members are being moved into that multiverse via coordinated portal spawns and it's likely that our home universe will be on the chopping block in months.  
Maria: It's all speculative at this time so don't worry about it for now.  
Jonas: Then where do we go from here?  
Maria: I'll take care of Hallie for now. I have to find out where her Andrew and Ashley are and recover them.  
Maria: You two keep searching for Mikaela and our Andrew. We need them alive to see Nina's resurrection.  
Maria: If any of our friends return to this world, get any information about that multiverse out of them, we need to know exactly what is going on down there.  
Maria: Does that work for all of us?  
Jonas and Beatrice: Sure...  
Maria: I know both of you are going through hard times with everything we are all going through in the past couple of months. I want both of you to take it easy this week.  
Maria: And this will mean keeping both of you here for tonight.  
Jonas: Guess we're sleeping on the couches tonight-  
Maria: J-Jonas! I got spare beds for yall!  
Beatrice: I'll try to take a break tomorrow but... ugh... I don't even know anymore... Mikaela is always on my mind... And that shithead of a surgeon...  
Maria: Beatrice... please... that surgeon must be captured alive. I'm concerned that you're going to kill him outright and bury any chance of finding out why he targeted your family.  
Beatrice: TO FUCKING HELL WITH SPARING HIM! HE MUST SUFFER FOR WHAT HE PUT MY FAMILY THROUGH!  
Jonas: Sierra, calm down. We're not starting this argument again...  
Beatrice: SIGH... HMPH...  
Maria: I'll brew some green tea to calm her nerves...  
Maria leaves to brew some tea.  
Jonas: Beatrice... What's gotten into you recently?! You're never like this!  
Beatrice: I just... I just want to kill that surgeon... I want to see him cry for mercy when I make him say his last words...  
Jonas: We need him alive to know exactly why he started all of this! why he tried to kill our families!  
Jonas: Get your shit together Sierra! If he dies, we lose any chance of finding the truth!  
Beatrice: . . .  
Beatrice: .................................  
Jonas: I get it, okay? We both want him dead for trying to kill our families.  
Jonas: I need him alive no matter what. Once we get the truth out of him, then I'll let you do whatever you want to him...  
Jonas: Please... keep him alive for the sake of finding the truth... He's our only chance we can get some proper closure to his schemes...  
Jonas kisses Beatrice on the lips, then leaves the bedroom.

(Is this how it all ends for me... endless betrayals and deaths?!)  
(Why?! WHY SHOULD I SPARE THE MAN THAT GAVE ORDERS TO KILL MY FAMILY?!)  
(THEY KILLED OUR FRIENDS, OUR CLASSMATES, ROPED US INTO THEIR SCHEMES!)  
(AND THEY WANT TO SILENCE US WITH DEATH?! BULLSHIT! I'M NOT LETTING HIM LIVE WHEN I CATCH HIM IN MY SIGHTS!)  
(. . .)  
(Everyone wants him alive... Jonas does... Dad does... why can't I put a bullet in the Surgeon and call it a day with dismantling Toxisoda...)  
(Thousands of souls had a future in this world... all of that, taken away for >!sexual gratification!<...)  
(He killed so many to please his own soul...)  
(Nothing matters to him, only a plentiful supply of victims and opportunities...)  
(If no one wants to finish the job, then I'll happy take the chance to write history...)  
(He suffers with me... like everyone else before him...)  
Jonas: Beatrice? Are you alright? You're talking to yourself again.  
Beatrice: EH? S-sorry about that!  
Jonas: Take it easy, Sierra. You're spiraling again...  
Jonas: He'll pay for what he did to our families. But right now, focus on finding Mikaela and Andrew.  
Beatrice nods slowly in agreement.  
Jonas: Okay... good...  
Beatrice: . . .  
Jonas: Beatrice... what's on your mind?  
Beatrice: . . .  
Beatrice: Would there ever be a timeline where we never got wrapped into this mess in the first place...  
Jonas: . . . No...  
Beatrice: . . .  
Beatrice: Will we ever find peace in this world...  
Jonas: I'm sure of it.  
Jonas hugs Beatrice, as she looks on, emotionless.  
Hallie: Jonas? who is that?  
Jonas: My friend.  
Hallie: Can she help me fix my toy train?  
Beatrice: Hm?  
Jonas: She needs help with fixing a toy train that she broke.  
Beatrice: S-sure.  
Hallie: Yay! I'll wait for you at the playroom!  
Hallie leaves.  
Beatrice: . . . I'll put my worries aside just for tonight...  
Jonas: That's good to hear.  
Maria (background): Hallie, looks like you want to talk alot today!  
Hallie (background): Your two friends are why I want to talk more.  
Jonas: I'll walk you out of this room, dear.  
Jonas and Beatrice slowly leave the bedroom, with Beatrice anxious and uneasy for what is yet to come.

It‚Äôs been a few months of focused study, long nights, and lots of coffee ‚Äî but reaching this milestone feels incredibly rewarding as I continue growing in my cybersecurity and GRC journey.

These resources were very helpful for me:

\- Hemang Doshi‚Äôs Udemy course ‚Äì super clear and to the point, packed with insights tailored for the exam.

\- CISA Review Manual (12th Edition ‚Äì QAE) ‚Äì great for getting a feel for ISACA‚Äôs question style.

\- CISA Study Guide (2nd Edition) ‚Äì helped me simplify and understand the core concepts.

\- ChatGPT ‚Äì I leaned on it a lot to break down complex topics when the textbooks got too dense.

And a big shoutout to this amazing community ‚Äî your shared experiences, advice, and study tips made a real difference in shaping my approach.

My Study Journey:

I set aside 3 months for dedicated prep, though I‚Äôd casually reviewed Domains 1 & 2 before that. Having 2 years of hands-on GRC experience really helped bring the material to life and made studying way more meaningful.

To everyone out there on their CISA journey: you‚Äôve got this. Lean on the community, trust your process, and keep pushing forward.

Thank you to all who shared their stories ‚Äî I hope mine gives someone else that extra boost of motivation.

You‚Äôd pick up a product, read the ingredients, and wonder if ‚Äúcoconut-derived cleansing agent‚Äù was just a fancy name for disappointment. Fast forward to 2025? The clean beauty world is absolutely thriving‚Äîand honestly, a little overwhelming. So many brands, so many claims, and so many ways to blow your entire paycheck on a serum. üôÉ

# What Even Is Clean Beauty in 2025?

Before we get into the brands, let‚Äôs just clear the air. ‚ÄúClean‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean it was rinsed in holy water. In 2025, **clean beauty** means products that are:

* **Free from potentially harmful ingredients** like parabens, sulfates, and synthetic fragrance.
* **Ethically sourced and cruelty-free.**
* **Transparent about ingredients and sustainability.**

It‚Äôs not about perfection‚Äîit‚Äôs about **making better choices** for your skin *and* the planet. üåç

# #1: ILIA Beauty ‚Äì Clean Meets Performance

This brand has become *the* go-to for clean makeup that actually lasts past your morning coffee.

# Why I‚Äôm Obsessed:

* **Skin-loving ingredients** like niacinamide and squalane in their makeup.
* Their **Super Serum Skin Tint SPF 40** is a game-changer for dewy skin days.
* FYI: Their mascara doesn‚Äôt flake like every other ‚Äúnatural‚Äù one I‚Äôve tried. Hallelujah.

**Bold claim, but I‚Äôd skip foundation before skipping ILIA.**

# #2: True Botanicals ‚Äì Luxe and Legit

Okay, let‚Äôs talk about [**True Botanicals**](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=True+Botanicals&crid=15OGN7X9Q19YC&sprefix=true+botanicals%2Caps%2C454&linkCode=ll2&tag=beauty04a2-20&linkId=8a61f04b909654445983a852616c7ffa&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)‚Äîaka that brand you see on Instagram and wonder if it‚Äôs *really* worth the hype (and the price tag).

Spoiler alert: **It is.**

# Why It‚Äôs a Vibe:

* **Clinically tested**, not just pretty packaging.
* Uses **biocompatible ingredients** your skin actually knows what to do with.
* The **Renew Pure Radiance Oil** is literal gold in a bottle‚Äîespecially if your skin gets fussy like mine.

Not gonna lie, every time I use this brand, I feel like I should be wearing silk pajamas and drinking something way fancier than instant coffee.

# Why I Keep Restocking:

* Uses **superfoods** and adaptogens like kale, spinach, and ashwagandha (yes, your smoothie ingredients).
* **Refillable packaging** on some products‚Äîlove that for the planet.
* The **Superfood Cleanser** feels like a salad for your face (in a good way).

Every time I wear Kosas, someone tells me I‚Äôm glowing. Coincidence? I think not.

# #8: Herbivore Botanicals ‚Äì Clean Beauty Meets Aesthetic Goals

If Pinterest had a skincare brand, it would be [**Herbivore**](https://www.amazon.com/HERBIVORE-Botanicals-Anti-Aging-Hydrates-Revitalizes/dp/B00QR22K3A?crid=1KW4BLSRRPP3G&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.p21iFW9xcI0JadA5nJFDXxgtd92D2sNnTU-xwCDmYsGQaYzzO3-4CACOk7DcAgq0nBls740ETiPib6-_WoawcYIWx6cihtVbb_eGjsG77ToDO4JiuQcPukTXkV9EBf7dhgqiId6wS_B-xhDZk7xOyyWV9W5gNg1PxaMVcFxY4_B_IpcAvNAz2UA6wp3lAo21Iu-FuDvHmpltLzfsjW1TJa3TqH9nAYVeAmrOSvUon_IQQHqUAsW4D0K9ySfg_N-raGUJMf5UfjsdFvHW6GHix1e0nLKCUfdGhxV1OP9KZZQ.MUgty-HbYSYR7dUkh9DGLlsKCAAEMtT-mMKa2Vr_W1M&dib_tag=se&keywords=herbivore%2Bbotanicals&qid=1745216945&sprefix=Herbivore%2Caps%2C288&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=beauty04a2-20&linkId=4100f50eeff0cd914348f9ebc5875e23&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl). But this isn‚Äôt just a pretty face.

# Here‚Äôs Why It‚Äôs More Than Just Packaging:

* **Glass packaging + recyclable materials** = sustainable goals.
* Their **Lapis Blue Tansy Oil** calms redness like a champ.
* No synthetic anything, ever. Just **plant-based and pure**.

It‚Äôs one of those brands that makes your shelfie look great‚Äîand your skin even better.

# Quick Shoutouts: Brands That Deserve a Spot on Your Radar

Because narrowing it down to 8 was actual torture, here are a few more worth stalking (I mean‚Ä¶ casually checking out):

* **OSEA Malibu** ‚Äì ocean-inspired skincare with serious hydration game.
* **Ere Perez** ‚Äì Aussie-born, botanically-driven, and seriously underrated.
* **Le Prunier** ‚Äì all about **plum oil**. Sounds weird, feels incredible.
* **Beautycounter** ‚Äì clean, transparent, and constantly pushing for **regulation in beauty** (finally!).

# What Makes a Clean Beauty Brand ‚ÄúOne to Watch‚Äù?

So glad you asked. :) In 2025, we‚Äôre not just looking for ‚Äúclean‚Äù slapped on a label.

# The brands making waves are:

* **Transparent** about their ingredients and sourcing.
* **Innovative** with formulations that *actually* work.
* **Sustainable**, because pretty packaging means nothing if it trashes the planet.
* **Inclusive**‚Äîclean beauty should work for *everyone*, not just one skin tone or type.

These brands don‚Äôt just check boxes. They lead the conversation.

# Final Thoughts: Your Clean Beauty Era Has Arrived üíÖ

Let‚Äôs face it‚Äîclean beauty isn‚Äôt a trend anymore. It‚Äôs the new normal (and thank goodness for that). Whether you‚Äôre a skincare minimalist or a full-on product junkie, there‚Äôs something magical about brands that care about what goes in and on your body.

So, which brand are you most curious to try? Got a fave I didn‚Äôt mention? **Slide into my DMs‚Äîjust kidding (but seriously, tell me üòÑ).**

And remember: **clean beauty doesn‚Äôt mean boring, bland, or beige.** It means *better*‚Äîfor your skin, your wallet (eventually), and the planet.

**Memory transcript Subject/ Admiral‚Äôs logs:** ***Admiral Catherine Janeway, UFP Starfleet Command***

*Date \[Standardized UFP Time\] August 18, 2136*

  
The past two months have been filled with headaches (both literal and figurative), putting out fires and copious amounts of coffee that I have been *omitting* from telling my doctor about.

 

*Earth, Mars, Vulcan, Andoria, Tellar, Trill, Betazed and Denoublia. Eight federation worlds, all containing artifacts of the gate builders pulled into this new reality.* Not just pulled out, moved as well. Earth, Mars and the Sol system seemed to be in the same place when compared to star charts and the galactic center. All of the other planets seemed to all be moved within mere lightyears of Sol. What was even more curious is beyond the orbits of the inhabited worlds the systems they were in seemed to be exact replicas of what they were before there was spacefaring infrastructure. This mining stations were gone, the only shipyards that remain in space are the ones in orbit of Mars, Earth, Andoria and Tellar. Luckily many of our planetary defenses remained with us as they are either planet bound or are orbital fixtures. Our main problem was ships.



The planets themselves were fairing pretty well all things considered. All Federation planets are self-sustaining to begin with so it's not like anyone was going hungry or the lights were going out. But there were several small problems cropping up that needed to be dealt with. One of the more concerning problems was Betazed, the Betazoid species were all born with varying degrees of telepathic and empathic abilities. They were renowned for their calm and cool demeanors under even the most trying times, one of the more common jobs you will find them in is as mental health professionals. The problem with Betazed is that a currently small but growing percentage of the population has begun to experience feelings of dread, dispar and hopelessness. Many of the affected have described to feeling as ""The echos of the suffering of millions"". Resoucrces are being allocated to try and find a way to deal with this up-and-coming problem before it spreads to more of the population. A tricky situation when you have a planet full of people to comminucate with their minds just as often with their voices



The only ships that were transported with us were the ones that were either near the planets transported or grounded in some fashion. In total Starfleet had only 50 ships of our current modern fleet that are rated for combat, exploration or defense and many of them had to undergo serious repairs due to the shift to this Universe, some fared better than others and we are still trying to figure out why. Shipyards and repair docks were working overtime, even after two months there were still a few of the larger *Galaxy* and S*overeign* class ships that needed repairs, it seemed that smaller and medium sized ships fared better. They were also busy due do some use I took with the powers given to me by the federation council and the other admirals. All ships in the mothball fleets and museums that remained would be retrofitted and modernized to current standards. Many of the ships were ancient by todays standard so it will take some time before they can be used in any meaningful way.

  
Shortly after we were transported to this universe Starfleet had sent out exploratory probes to scout out the nearby space for any protentional allies, threats or resources. It was with horror we discovered a species that brought up a horrifying callback to an old enemy of ours, the Gorn who seem to share much of their behavior and appearance with the Arxur. The Arxur were a large reptilian species (often referred to as the grays) that seemed to be hellbent on waging a war of extermination and subjugation on the rest of the galaxy, we had picked up transmissions they had sent to taunt their enemies. They farmed the captured individuals from their raid to use as livestock and slaves. From the transmissions and messages, we intercepted it seems as if they don't see the other species of this galaxy as sentient.

  
The Orion arm Federation on the other hand seemed to be a union of herbivorous (prey as they called themselves) species that were working together to fend off the Arxur. It seems that due to being attacked by the Arxur these people seemed to be terrified of and have an intense hatred of anything ""Predatory"" and what they considered to be so seemed completely arbitrary (front facing eye, any behavior that goes against group norms, opinions that go against official government stances).

  
It was a little over a month ago that we had made contact with the species known as the Venlil and the Zurulian, although first contact was hit-or-miss for a second, but we won them over in the end. In the coming days we had signed defense, trade and mutual cooperation agreements. I had sent my thanks along with other members of command and the federation leaders to Governer Tarva and Prime Mister Braylen for staying their hands (or paws to be more accurate) and allowing us to win them over. We had also initiated exchange programs to foster goodwill between our peoples.

  
I had stretched my arms above myself as I got up in the captain's ready room. I went over to the replicator to get another coffee. *How many have I had today? 6? 7? Well, I need it, I had only 4 fours of sleep last night and probably look like death warmed up. It has been nothing but meetings and reports since we got pulled into this universe. At least now I get to do something more than that.*

  
Currently I was aboard the Akria Class starship the *USS Helios* and orbiting Denoublia awaiting the arrival of the first group of exchange program integrating into our medical ships. I beam aboard, make a speech add afterwards I was to meet with the planetary government about resource allocation for more mines to be built in their asteroid field, apparently, they found several rich deposits of ores we use for the composition of our starship hulls. *Perhaps afterwards I can take a few days leave planetside? It's been more than 20 years since I have visited while on leave from the academy. If those nightlife clubs are the same as before then I doubt I would be recognized. At least I know what to be prepared for this time. All those years ago I was very overwhelmed by what I saw, definitely not for the uninitiated, especially those sub-level clubs. I wonder if Bryn and his wives are still around. We definitely had a great time all those years ago, especial Vensa. I should get in contact with them. I think I saw the name of one of them on the manifests for the hospital ships.*

  
*Well, I guess it's time I head to the bridge for a report. The first shuttle should be here shortly.* As I walked to the bridge I took a note of the room, nothing out of the ordinary, everyone at their stations.



""Comms, report.""



An ensign at the comms station answered.



""Admiral, all systems are performing at peak efficiency. The *Sanctuary* reported that all modifications have been made for the exchange but that the new phaser array will not be finished for another three hours. They also stated that...""

  
Just then the comms station then sounded off with what sounded like a hail.

  
""Admiral, the *Sanctuary* is hailing us. It's marked as urgent. Should I put them through?""

  
The sanctuary was an older *Suurok* class Vulcan vessel, while first created as an exploratory vessel it had been refitted into a hospital ship and renamed by the Denoublians after sitting in the mothball fleet for over a decade. First thing we did was retrofit the warp drive and shielding, we cannot let our wounded be caught or preyed upon. The older Vulcan inspired ship designed had always looked so elegant to me, the *Sanctuary* was just over 300 meters in length, the main body of the vessel was a long and narrow cylinder and pointed on each end with the warp drive being a large ring that encircled the ship towards the center, it had a crew compliment of about 400, about half of which were medical personnel compared to the 500 of the Helios, one of the most modern ships in the fleet, designed to fight the Borg, or any other threat we may face . 

I nodded at the ensign to accept the hail and the viewscreen changed to the face of the captain of the *Sanctuary*, this was Captain Trevix, we had been in contact throughout the day to prepare everything so that the exchange program went off without a hitch and he had seem very level headed and competent so it must be pretty urgent if he is hailing us, I had entrusted Captain Cypress to stay at Venlil Prime with *Voyager* to facilitate the exchange program and to act as interim ambassador. *I haven't been updated for a few hours, better check what's going on there*. I was shaken out of my thoughts as the captain spoke.

  
""Admiral, we have just received word from the *Cuyahoga*, they are being pursued by three Arxur craft and will arrive in less than three minutes with the Arxur not far behind, I have already ordered all hands to battle stations for all the good it will do us, we can use are upgraded shields but our new phaser array is still being installed and we have no torpedo bays or fighter craft, we are toothless.""

  
*Damn, they caught us off balance with this poor timing, we are the only Starfleet ships in system and there is an entire planet of civilians down there. I doubt three craft of any make could get through the defense grid let alone ships from this universe but still, we can't let the Arxur think they can violate our borders.* *Ill try to find a way for them to leave without us having to fire on them, according to Governer Tarva they can't be reasoned with. I am unsure if that is strictly true or if nobody had the capability to deal with them using a stern hand*. I thought for a few moments on my plan of action before responding to the captain.

  
""Understood, the first priority will be to secure the *Cuyahoga* given the fact there is over 20 noncombatants on board. When they exit warp, I want the *Sanctuary* to attempt to transport them out barring that the Helios will provide cover for you to lower you shields in order for them to dock. Hopefully it will not come to that as I will try to find a peaceful resolution. Understood captain?""

The captain nodded before responding.

  
""Understood Admiral, *Sanctuary* out.""

  
The view screen flickered off and returned to the view from before of the planet below. Denoublia had their entire population of 14 billion on one continent, it was quite crowded, and people lived quite close to one another, but it was by choice and they seemed to love it. Thats the reason they had so few colonies historically, they loved the company and the sheer amounts of people on their home world. I took a deep breath before continuing. *This is going to be a long day, isn't it*? *And where is Tuvok? He is practically attached to me at the hip at any other time, the one time I need him here he turns into a puff of smoke.*

  
""Tactical, set us to yellow alert and send all crew to battle stations, afterwards try to scan for those ships and compare them to the database given to us by our new allies, I need to know what we will be facing. Comms, contact the Denoublian militia and apprise them of the situation, afterwards send a subspace message to Starfleet command that we are about to make contact and possibly engage the Arxur. Helm, take us within weapons range of where the shuttle will drop out of warp""

  
I pressed my comm badge and spoke once again after hearing a chorus of *ayes* from the bridge crew.

  
""Janeway to Commander Tuvok, you are to assemble an away team and prepare to engage with the Arxur, have a shuttle prepped in case transporters are unavailable.""

  
A moment passed before I heard that steady, unwavering voice I've known for years respond.

  
""Understood Admiral, it will be done, Tuvok out.""

  
I began to hear that haunting chime of the yellow alert. Barely 30 passed before the Lieutenant at tactical spoke up.

  
""Admiral, we have identified the ships following the shuttlecraft, they appear to be two large battlecruisers and a cattle collection ship, from what I am reading here it seems like the cattle ship would host the highest ranking Arxur for a force this small.""

  
So, it seems the Arxur saw a lone shuttle craft and decided that it will be easy pickings, they are in for a rude awakening. We received a message from the *Sanctuary* that the *Cuyahoga* had been apprised of the plan. We were barely waiting a minute before the shuttle had dropped out of warp with a flash of light, mere seconds later the Arxur did as well and were immediately in pursuit peppering the shuttle with kinetic and explosive rounds, luckily, they seemed to be able to evade the missiles, and the kinetics were doing slight damage to the shielding. The two battle ships were truly monstrosity's in aesthetics, while slightly larger than the *Helios,* their hull plating made them look like they were made with black iron so it made it somewhat difficult to make out the details exactly, the most prominent feature is the railgun that took up about 25% of the length of the ships rectangular and blocky frame while it was set in the middle, protected on either side by the hull. Aside from the railgun these ships were covered in weapons on any open space on the hull, the vast majority of which seemed to be either torpedo/ missile launchers or kinetic weapons. *I can't believe that any space faring people would still use kinetics, and they have been for hundreds of years at this point, is innovation illegal here?* The cattle ship on the other hand it seemed was almost cubical lacked any railgun but was still covered in kinetics, from what I have learned is that these ships could carry upwards of hundreds or even thousands of captured cattle back to Axur space, even when they are heading to a raid they will have some on board for *fresh food. Its go time it seems*.

  
""Comms open a channel to the lead ship. Tactical, ready phasers and prepare to fire at my command.""



The ensign responded a moment later with a nod in my direction.

  
""Arxur ships this is Admiral Cathrine Janeway, you have Violated the territory of the United Federation of Planets, break off your pursuit and power down your weapons at once or you will be fired upon.""

  
For a few moments there was no response, and I was about to order an attack when the ships suddenly halted and stopped their attack but had not powered down weapons. A moment later the visage of an Arxur appeared on screen. This one appeared to have darker gray scales compared to the rest of his species, almost black and seemed to have a well built and muscular figure with a large scar jutting across his chest. *Must be in charge, from what we know the higher you rank the better you are fed. Makes sense to have the most loyal on the cattle ships*. The Arxur began to speak in a deep growling voice.

  
""You! I thought you were supposed to be extinct. No matter, I am captain Coth and we found this prey ship before they entered your hunting grounds and we will pursue, but we can spit the catch since it is your territory, but we have done all the work.""

  
I squinted my eyes at this Coth. *So, it seems they can negotiate but only with what they consider another predator, he recognizes me as human, probably is thinking about the one's native to here. I will not be doing any sort of deception here, lets just try to make him back off with some well-chosen words and a firm hand.*

  
""As you can tell we are not extinct but that is beside the point. That craft contains one of our people and you will let them continue to their destination. Any attempts to stop them will be met with extreme prejudice. If you let them go peacefully you will be allowed to leave unharmed""

  
The small console besides my chair beeped, it was the *Sanctuary* they had sent a message to us. *We cannot use transporters, they seem to be giving off some sort of energy that is disrupting subspace and making it impossible to target transporters in the area*. The Arxur widened his eyes in either disbelief or confusion. He seemed surprised that we dare make demands. Almost as if he has never been told no in his life.

  
""You will *allow* us to leave?! You do not make demands of us Human! You may not be prey, but the Arxur are still above all other lifeforms. How will you stop us? There are three of our battleships against your two. We will continue our hunt, or you will die by my fangs!""

  
*Okay, I tried playing good cop, Tuvok cannot get on my case about brash decisions this time. Seems like no nice Admiral Janeway anymore.*

  
""You know, I'm really easy to get along with, most of the time but here's the thing. I don't like threats; I don't like bullies and I sure as hell don't like you. I will tell you this one final time. Power down your weapons and leave or be destroyed! The choice is yours.""

  
Coths' eyes widened even more somehow, and he stood up straight with his claws digging into the board in front of him. His next words were more of a roar than conversational tone.

  
""You insolate apes! You will die for nothing, the hunt will continue!""

  
The connection was severed and the viewscreen returned to normal. The three ships continued their pursuit of the *Cuyahoga*. *That will not happen, not under my watch.*

  
*""*Comms, message the *Sanctuary* let them know that we will be providing cover and for them to drop shields to allow the shuttle to dock once we have engaged the enemy, tell them to expect possible casualties from the cattle ship. Helm, take us at full impulse between the *Cuyahoga* and the Arxur, I want us to become their new fixation. Tactical, ready phasers and lock on the battle ships. Do not fire until my command. Put all excess energy into our shields.""

  
Resounding sounds of conformations sounded out as we charged in like a mother moose protecting its calf. As we positioned ourselves between the ships and began to be peppered with munitions I noticed something odd, our shields were barely affected. The kinetics could probably be taken care of by navigational deflectors to be honest, and the explosives would probably take hours to drain through the shields. What surprised me was being hit by the railgun, as we saw that brilliant stream of light hit the shields it shook the ship. *Huh, one hit depleted us by 5%, not bad for plasma-based weaponry. Too bad they take so long to recharge. Still has nothing on good ol', phaser arrays though*. Just then the ensign at the comms spoke up.

  
""Admiral, the Cuyahoga has docked with the Sanctuary, and they are bringing up shields.""

  
*Good timing, now we get to hit back. Much harder.*



""Tactical, begin firing phasers at the battleships. Target their reactors. Helm, begin evasive pattern alpha two, no more free hits on us.""

  
It turns out that the missiles had a very simple guidance system and could not hit anything that was maneuvering in any way that was remotely complex. With the explosives not a problem anymore and the kinetics being able to be ignored all that we had to worry about with the railguns. Which it seems are no problem either due to the battleships being unable to maneuver themselves quick enough to line up a shot. It only took a one volley from the phaser array to disable shields on the first vessel and two more to cause a core melt down. The second one fell as easy as the first with little fanfare. One of the science officers manning the sensor station spoke up.

  
""Admiral, it seems that whatever was disrupting our transport scanners seems to at least be partially dealt with. I believe we can beam aboard the cattle ship, but I seem unable to beam anything out for now.""

  
*Thats good we can beam our team aboard and take the ship and free the cattle. Might be able to figure out what is causing this disruption field.*

  
""Good job, I want you to focus scans on where this disruption is coming from. Tactical I want you to target shields are propulsion systems. I need that ship in one piece. alert the transporter room once shields are down so we can transport the commander and his team immediately."" I tapped my comm badge once again.

  
""Tuvok, you will momentarily be beamed over to the cattle ship, focus on taking the bridge and capturing the Arxur in command. After you achive that I want you to incapacitate the entire crew and bring them back for quentioning. Understood?""

  
I recieved a curt ""Yes Admiral"" for a reply. As before it only took a single volley to disable the shields on the cattle ship and Tuvok and his team was away. After a few minutes I was informed by the science officer that she had found what she believed was the cause of the subspace disturbance. The arxur apparently shot out several buoys right after dropping out of warp that were emitting energy that disrupted subspace in the area. Apparently, a few were destroyed in our attack on the Arxur and weakened the disruption enough for partial use of the transporters. I immediately ordered the destruction of the rest of the bouys and we regained to full use of transporters back.

  
Just as we had finished that we received word from Tuvok that the away team had taken the ship and had secured all 30 of the Arxur alive but there were several on both sides of the conflict that required medical attention. I ordered for the away team to be beamed back to the ship and the Arxur to the holding cells in the brig where they could then be treated. The sanctuary moved in and then began beaming the cattle on board for medical treatment.

  
In the aftermath we ended up using a tractor beam to move the Cattle ship closer to the repair dock so it could be studied. The *Sanctuary* reported that all those brought aboard were expected to make a full recovery, physically at least. I still needed to have a word with our esteemed Captain Coth before I sent him and his men to Vulcan for full interrogations and internment.

It‚Äôs becoming unbearable because:  
The owner/other lawyer yells at support staff and articling student until they cry. Support staff‚Äôs work sits for weeks or months waiting for approval. They often come to me crying; it‚Äôs becoming extremely difficult to hold my tongue and not tell off the owner when this happens, at least once a week.

They give borderline wrong or incompetent advice, even on basic points, while claiming years of experience. They also don‚Äôt know answers any experienced lawyer in the field should have. They often excuse it by saying, ‚ÄúI work so hard; I don‚Äôt have time to keep up and research.‚Äù So I can‚Äôt learn anything except through web research or case law (case law is very limited and only in few particular areas so is of limited help).

They insist they ‚Äúwork without breaks everyday and weekends,‚Äù yet nothing gets done, and they constantly complain that everyone else is lazy and entitled. They also take a massive number of free files and charge at less than half of market rates. They complain that everyone is lazy and not completing enough work. I suspect they take free or low‚Äëcost cases to look like a good person, but then complain about money. Every phone call starts with this speech. The turnover is huge‚Äîmore than 30 people have left in a couple of years.

Some of the offices/rooms inside the firm is being sublet to non-legal related business , I believe this also create massive privacy and confidentiality violations with people coming in and out of the firm.

Now I‚Äôm being pressured to network and bring in clients from the community, but that person conducts the consultations and keeps giving bad advice. I don‚Äôt feel ethically or morally comfortable with that.

I‚Äôve started meeting other lawyers and getting coffees to find something different. I think self‚Äëstudying another area might make the search easier, especially given the market now.

Paired Romer-7 Travel Hybrid with Dorco Klass on it‚Äôs 3^(rd) use. The blade is still going strong. I had a very close and comfortable first wtg pass. I could have comfortably closed my shave there. But decided to go for another pass, went xtg on face and atg on neck with the close comb side of the razor. And what I got was a BBS Shave without any nic, cut or irritation.

Good alum feedback on neck and chin area and it was expected, closed the shave with shower followed by Gillette ASL.

I mentioned recently about a math tutor classmate I have that ‚Äúsupposedly ‚Äú asked me out for coffee, I don‚Äôt agree that he did but whatever . And she got so excited, kept smiling idiotically and telling me to not be stupid and go out with him.

And it‚Äôs even worse because me and my boyfriend are very serious about us, we have plans for the future. And her telling me all this stuff is very annoying, makes me never want to tell her anything(spoiler alert: I don‚Äôt tell her anything anyway, shocking right? lol)
