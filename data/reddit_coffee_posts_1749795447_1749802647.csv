1laajad,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1laajad/rsd_and_high_school_drama_well_into_adult_life/,Rsd and high school drama well into adult life,"This will be a long and complicated one, so thanks in advance for those that will stay with me through it. TL;DR: why are friendships with ADHD so hard and why do people think that having reactions and emotions is ""being dramatic""?

My life got turned upside down due to a recent trip with my friends that I was sooooo looking forward to. I went there with 4 friends: 2 of them I knew well and/or for longer, two were nice and in a common sport group for a while. 
In the beginning of the trip, it was only three of us: me and two girls, who were until recently primarily friends of mine. One is my brother's gf and has been my partner in the sport we train for more than 1.5 years and we hang out plenty the two of us, let's call her Kelly. And the other is from a friend group with my partner and his friends that I've been a part of for 4+ years (trips, sport, board games together), let's call her Meg. So, it was all good for a first couple of days, but then Kelly and Meg became super friendly, which would be fine, but at the same time they started freezing me out, most jokes were aimed at me and some jokes started feeling like jabs. They'd come up with nicknames for each other and would sit together at a dinner table or couch next to each other and joke at things/photos they mostly wouldn't share with me. Whenever Kelly made some comment about my behavior, like she disapproved of something, even minor, Meg would jump right in and second her, which was so unnecessary and it made me feel like them vs me in couple of situations.
I felt bad, but told myself to bury this feeling and hang on, since these types of sometimes ""borderline"" jokes are Kelly's thing. I told myself she's like that, she's the center of attention, always joking, but she also likes me right? And she still was my partner when we were doing our sport (Meg wasn't available until late afternoons, courseload thing). 

Finally two remaining girls joined us, let's call them Ana and Tess. From that day, Kelly and Meg cut me out even more - Kelly wouldn't be my partner while we were doing sports, she was kinda snappy with me at times and it felt like she was avoiding me overall. I tried being optimistic and friendly, but it felt so lonely. Things got so bad I even considered cutting my trip short, buying an earlier flight and coming back home, but long story short(er), I didn't want to cause any problems for them or cause drama, so I stayed. Well, that didn't work out either. They'd  sometimes would cut me off when I was talking or ignored me and didn't answer, they'd snap at me when I was saying something, they'd be super supportive and excited about each other's sport accomplishments, but mine often felt like an afterthought; mostly it was Kelly and Meg. It felt like some parts of them, that didn't come up in all these years of friendships, started to resonate with one another and all their (buried? Unrealized?) dislike for me grew so strong, that it boiled past the point of containment - like you know, when every little thing some does annoys you because you just don't like them.
We were living, eating and doing sports together the 5 of us so there was hardly ever time to have a conversation just one on one with Kelly, which I really wanted and tried to find an appropriate space for.

I wanted to help regulate myself and talk to someone, so I tried talking to the most sympathetic of the girls, Ana, about how I felt. She shut me down pretty much immediately, saying them not letting me say things (like recommending coffee...) is them expressing healthy boundaries, that I am just jealous of their friendship, that they wouldn't have invited me if they didn't like me, that I am causing the situation in a way because I'm sad and withdrawing from them. It felt like she dismissed all my feelings and put the weight of the situation fully on me. Then she asked me (after what was a couple minutes long ""conversation"") if I go to therapy. Auch. 
Then I finally found courage and space to talk to Kelly. She seemed nice and sympathetic in this conversation, but basically the message was the same. They really like me, I freeze myself out because I withdraw, not because they freeze me out, and she slipped in the message that I talk too much, so either I have to hold myself back more, or expect them not to listen because what I say is not that interesting for them. And apparently, she's been feeling this way for a while but never told me. She also admitted that sometimes when she does well in our sport and I do worse, she feels that I'm sad so.. she had decided she'd train only with other people during this trip. And that ""maybe this is why I felt left out"". She also asked if I go to therapy. This talk was on a 10 min walk to the store, so also not optimal but it felt like at least my problem was in the open, I asked for support in a way.

Next days felt better, but we came back to the original group of 3 girls at the end of the trip and it got kinda nasty. Snapping, blaming me, them standing far away from me - I felt like an odd and annoying person in a 2 vs 1 scenario. We got back home, I thought things would calm down and we'd talk, hash it out and case closed cause we're friends after all. Well.. here comes the Absolute Fallout:

Meg hasnt said a word to me since we got back, and I found out through the grapevine that we may no longer meet as a group. My partner talked to Meg's partner, and their friendship will be preserved, but they probably will meet just them to avoid tension.
After returning, I asked Kelly if she wanted to do weekend training together as we have done for so long, and she said no - she wants to process her emotions and she doesn't want to train with me for a while. Okay. I asked her to let me know when she wanted to meet up and talk. She left my message on read and that was the last time we talked. She no longer speaks a word to me on our group trainings and on the weekend she trains with her new best friend Meg. 
Tess reached out, saying she's heard that there were still some issues, and if I'd like to talk. I felt so grateful that someone finally wants to hear me out as well, but something in her message felt wrong, and it turns out she wasn't interested in talking or listening to me. She talked to the other girls and they had some conclusions, and she wanted to meet with me to talk to me about therapy, because - I quote - I pressure people to fulfill my emotional needs and no adult likes to be pressured; it was all framed like care and worry about me and idk, maybe it was. Although I felt so hurt that she hasn't spend even 5 minutes talking to me, yet she ""diagnosed me"".

I tried talking to my brother, who is also Kelly's gf. I held off for almost a month but it felt like he knew nothing about the situation and was still planning future events as if nothing happened. He listened and seemed to get it, only to later text me that ""this is too much drama, he doesn't care, we need to figure it out ourselves"" and we basically don't see each other anymore.

I low key quit my sport group and my favorite trainer because I feel so crappy there. Also now I know they all talk about me, but not to me and they all consider me to be some broken person who they just should cut out of their lives and send to therapy. I basically have no sports partner and no group I used to play boardgames, travel, laugh with and do sports together, so the fallout for me has been enormous. I feel so used by Kelly, like she tolerated me until she didn't need me anymore cause she found someone she likes more to train with, and my group of friends I invited her to, now became hers and she gladly took over..

What do I do in this situation? Some people tell me to text Kelly again and talk to her but.. I reached out first, both during the trip and after, and she was the one to turn me down and freeze me out. Would you message all of them?
I really thought these were the things of highschool, not adults in their 30s, but still it doesn't seem to hurt much less than back then ",1,1749802454.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

My husband Carter Kingsley's whole family has never liked me.  
  
That much, I've always known.  
  
His father avoids all family matters like the plague.  
  
His mother looks down on my middle-class background.  
  
And Carter?  
  
His heart was never mine to begin with.  
  
But our son, Ethan Kingsley, is six now.  
  
Bright. Charming.  
  
And I just couldn't bring myself to leave him.  
  
He even started learning French—and picked it up fast.  
  
Now he and Carter talk in French around the house like it's their own secret club.  
  
At first, I was proud.  
  
A child I gave birth to, so smart, making his father proud.  
  
It made me want to hold on to this family, even just a little longer.  
  
Until I started secretly studying French myself.  
  
And slowly, I began to understand what they were really saying.  
  
And little by little, my heart froze over.  
  
Turns out my own child, just like his father, was learning French not for school,  
  
But to please Vivienne—the woman Carter's always loved.  
  
Vivienne, the childhood sweetheart who went off to France for grad school.  
  
They were inseparable once,  
  
But Carter's churchgoing, conservative parents rejected her—  
  
Not for who she was, but because a pastor-turned-""counselor"" told them she was a poor match for the Kingsley legacy.  
  
Meanwhile, I—a girl from an average Ohio family—was married into this Manhattan dynasty because that same counselor said I would bring ""stability and prosperity.""  
  
So I spent the last seven years in a marriage built on a prophecy—and completely devoid of love.  
  
I was lost in thought when the sharp clang of Carter's fork against his plate snapped me out of it.  
  
He frowned like he always does when I take a second too long to think.  
  
""Vivienne's back in the States. She's pregnant.""  
  
""She'll be moving in so we can help take care of her.""  
  
His eyes locked on me, full of warning.  
  
""She's carrying a child now. Don't start any drama.""  
  
Yeah. Pregnant women are delicate.  
  
Funny how that didn't apply when I was the one pregnant.  
  
Back then, only the baby mattered—never me.  
  
Even when I hemorrhaged during labor,  
  
As long as Ethan made it out of the delivery room alive,  
  
Carter never even came to check if I survived.  
  
I nodded.  
  
I didn't ask who the baby's father was.  
  
Back in the day, if Vivienne had tried to get even close to this house,  
  
I would've lost my mind.  
  
I fought. Screamed.  
  
And Carter only ever gave me cold indifference.  
  
But now, after understanding everything they whisper in French, I felt nothing.  
  
""I'll move out for a while,"" I said.  
  
""Give her space to rest.""  
  
Carter paused.  
  
Before he could respond, Ethan lit up with joy.  
  
""If Mommy's gone, does that mean I can be with Aunt Vivienne every day?""  
  
Even the smartest kid can't hide how he really feels.  
  
Carter stared into my eyes.  
  
Was he trying to figure out what I was planning?  
  
Or if I even had the strength left to care?  
  
For a second, maybe I imagined it—but I thought I saw something soft flicker in his gaze.  
  
Still, Vivienne and her baby came first.  
  
Carter said gently, ""The house is big. No need to move out.  
  
But we have a place out in Westchester.  
  
I'll have it signed over to you.  
  
You can go there whenever you want… clear your head.""  
  
I understood.  
  
This was my reward for ""being mature.""  
  
He hated that I might have tainted the family line.  
  
So now he was making sure his first love could carry their perfect child.  
  
No matter the cost.  
  
And he was willing to be generous about it.  
  
Which made me wonder—  
  
When the baby I'm carrying is born, will he be even more generous?  
  
After all, this time, I made sure Carter has nothing to do with it.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Vivienne moved in early that morning.  
  
I was in the garden watering and trimming my cosmos flowers.  
  
They were the only things in this cold, loveless house that bloomed because of me.  
  
Vivienne held her pregnant belly with one hand, covering her nose with the other.  
  
""Don't bother trimming them,"" she said with a dramatic sigh.  
  
""I can't stand the smell. Just get rid of them.""  
  
I stood and wiped some dirt off my cheek.  
  
Vivienne squinted at me, then seemed to realize something.  
  
""Oh—sorry, didn't realize it was you, Sienna.""  
  
'I thought you were the gardener.""  
  
She offered a tight smile.  
  
""Well, if these flowers are yours, I guess you'd be too sentimental to tear them out.""  
  
""I'll just deal with it.""  
  
Carter, standing beside her with a hand on her lower back, frowned.  
  
""You're pregnant. You don't have to ‘deal with' anything.""  
  
""It's just a bunch of flowers. Get rid of them.""  
  
I glanced down at the garden and gave a small smile.  
  
Carter thought I was hesitating, ready to scold me.  
  
But instead, I nodded.  
  
""Sure. I've got something to do soon anyway.""  
  
""Just have the gardener take care of it.""  
  
Carter paused, caught off guard by how calmly I agreed.  
  
For a second, I thought I saw a flicker of sympathy in his eyes.  
  
""I'll have them replanted at the Westwood property,"" he said softly.  
  
""I know you put a lot into them.""  
  
I did love those flowers.  
  
They were one of the few things I had to hold on to in this house.  
  
But now, it didn't matter anymore.  
  
""Whatever you think is best,"" I replied.  
  
I checked my phone—my meeting with the investigator was in thirty minutes.  
  
I gave them both a polite nod.  
  
""Excuse me.""  
  
As I stepped past Carter, he suddenly grabbed my wrist.  
  
Vivienne looked at him, confused and slightly annoyed.  
  
He let go immediately.  
  
""Come back early,"" he said.  
  
""There's something I need to talk to you about.""  
  
I nodded.  
  
""Sure.""  
  
The moment I left the Kingsley estate, I could breathe again.  
  
Even if it was just for a little while.  
  
I met the investigator at a coffee shop downtown—the same one I used to frequent back in college.  
  
The owner did a double take when she saw me.  
  
I guess I didn't look like the girl she remembered.  
  
Ever since marrying Carter, I hadn't really lived.  
  
The Kingsleys thought places like this were too... common.  
  
The investigator handed me a file.  
  
""The ultrasound confirms Vivienne is about four months along.""  
  
""Which... doesn't match Mr. Kingsley's timeline.""  
  
So Carter's miracle child—wasn't even his.  
  
If he found out, would he be disgusted?  
  
Would he still want the baby just because it's Vivienne's?  
  
I looked up at the investigator.  
  
""If I don't divorce him, my child still has inheritance rights, right?""  
  
""Of course,"" he said without hesitation.  
  
I pressed a hand to my belly.  
  
""And what if the baby's not his?""  
  
He blinked, visibly thrown.  
  
""Well... if you're married, he's still legally obligated to support the child. But—""  
  
I cut him off with a shake of my head.  
  
That was all I needed to hear.  
  
If Carter expected me to raise his child with Vivienne...  
  
Then why couldn't I let him raise a child that wasn't his?  
  
Chapter 3  
  
When I got home, Eleanor Kingsley was fussing over Vivienne like she was a princess.  
  
They both looked up the moment I walked in.  
  
Their smiles dropped.  
  
Carter frowned.  
  
""Didn't I tell you not to come back yet?""  
  
I chuckled.  
  
""You told me to come back early.""  
  
""Said you had something to talk about.""  
  
Carter hesitated.  
  
He clearly forgot.  
  
He cleared his throat.  
  
""Doesn't matter now.""  
  
""The annual family dinner—Vivienne's handling it this year.""  
  
Every year, I handled that dinner.  
  
Because I was the Kingsley family's official wife.  
  
It was my duty.  
  
Eleanor nitpicked everything I ever did for those dinners.  
  
The menu, the flowers, the lighting—nothing was ever good enough.  
  
But at least it came with the title.  
  
Now that Vivienne was here, even that had been handed to her.  
  
I gave a tight-lipped smile.  
  
""Sure. It's your house, your call.""  
  
Carter frowned, like he expected me to fight back.  
  
Eleanor sniffed, pleased. ""At least you know your place.""  
  
She turned to Vivienne, her voice warm.  
  
""If you run into any trouble, just let me know, sweetheart.""  
  
Vivienne gave her a bashful smile, and Carter melted all over again.  
  
They launched into planning, forgetting I was still in the room.  
  
Laughing together.  
  
Ethan sat beside Vivienne, gently patting her belly.  
  
""This dinner's for my baby brother!""  
  
They looked like the perfect little family.  
  
And I—  
  
I was just background noise.  
  
I walked upstairs without another word.  
  
For days, I stayed out of sight.  
  
They loved it.  
  
Everyone was busy helping Vivienne plan the big event.  
  
But this wasn't her world.  
  
She got overwhelmed quickly.  
  
I overheard her one evening, curled up in Carter's arms.  
  
""I can't even get a stupid dinner right... I'm useless.""  
  
Carter held her tighter.  
  
""No, baby. You're doing great. It's your first time.""  
  
The next night, Carter knocked on my door.  
  
That alone was unusual.  
  
When I opened it, he didn't waste time.  
  
""Vivienne's overwhelmed.""  
  
""She's pregnant, and this dinner is a lot. Help her out.""  
  
I smiled.  
  
""When I handled my first dinner, I was eight months pregnant.""  
  
He looked surprised.  
  
Like he'd only just remembered that.  
  
Back then, I was on my feet every day, planning menus and centerpieces, weeks from giving birth.  
  
No one offered to help.  
  
No one cared.  
  
And now?  
  
A little guilt on his face didn't mean a damn thing.  
  
I cut him off before he could apologize.  
  
""I'll help with the background stuff.""  
  
'Let her handle the main event. She deserves to shine, right?""  
  
Carter blinked, clearly thrown.  
  
""You're really okay letting her take the spotlight?""  
  
After all, the dinner was always the First Lady's stage.  
  
And I was giving it up.  
  
""She is carrying the next Kingsley,"" I said calmly.  
  
Carter opened his mouth like he wanted to say something else.  
  
But I'd already closed the door.  
  
He stood there for a while.  
  
Maybe realizing I wasn't the woman who used to beg for his attention.  
  
Maybe realizing I didn't need him anymore.

Andrew Ross was supposed to be Belle County's invincible street racer, but I watched him die today, just hours after I learned he was sleeping with Gale. The screams started before the engine died, and all I could hear was the quiet confession from Gale earlier that morning. We were spooned together in bed, his arms cinched around my waist like a drawstring bag.

He whispered it into my ear, “I slept with Andrew.” 

The words hung heavier than the summer humidity. I felt my breath hitch. I didn’t move, I couldn't– Eight years of quite intimacy flashed through my eyes—eight *years* of squabbles, date nights, and long car rides. I scrambled to comprehend the casual confession, but all I could picture was Andrew– arrogant and boastful, the king of the underground races. Just a few hours later, I would watch him veer off the road and wrap his Porsche 944 around a tree. For me, the death was more than a blow of steel and shrapnel. When Gale and I got home from the races, it ignited a physical, desperate fight. I left our apartment with blood dripping down my nose and nowhere else to go besides the doorstep of my neighbor, Belle County’s deputy, Chester Crass Blackwell. I knocked my hand against his door, hoping Gale wouldn’t come storming out of ours. 

“Hello?” The deputy said as he opened the door. I watched his eyes take in my bruised nose, bloody knuckles, and ripped jeans. Gale was still throwing things around in our apartment. It was audible even across the two lawns between us. “Are you okay?” 

I found my chest hitching at him. I giggled. *I giggled*! Before shaking my head and pathetically asking if I could *please come in.* 

The deputy set me up in his kitchen. He handed me a roll of paper towels and told me to keep my head leaned back. He hadn’t asked questions, and for that I was grateful. Trying to distract myself from the gallon of blood leaking from my face, I took in his kitchen. It was pristine, as if he hadn’t lived here for the six years that Gale and I had rented across the street. 

“Keep your head up.” He stipulated. “At least try not to stain my countertops.” 

I tensed. I was having the worst day of my life. God forbid, I wasn’t thinking of the state of his countertop? He was rummaging through his empty freezer. He came back with a bag of frozen peas. 

“Here.” He held them up to me and sat down across the table. 

I mumbled my thanks before pressing the chilled vegetables to my eye, keeping my head up. Gale had struck one solid blow to the bridge of my nose, hitting my eye as he did. Like most of our fights, I was the one who started it. I don’t know why I let Gale race Andrew, or why I agreed to be his plus one to the event. At the time, I was still reeling– A part of me thinking that I could be okay with Gale’s betrayal. It was wishful thinking. He would win against Belle County's racing king and pull me from the crowd to declare what a colossal mistake he made. He would make a scene out of it, scooping me up like we are Jake Gyhlennhal and Heath Ledger starring in an alternate southern romance flick with a happy ending. But I was the one pulling Gale from his car while Andrew’s sat in a pile of smoking shambles. Gale was dazed, and I was blisteringly drunk. Trying to get through the law enforcement questioning was gruelling. Gale didn’t speak; he never took his eyes off the crash scene. When I drove us away, his eyes were glued to it; he kept mumbling about how it looked like Andrew was fighting with someone to control the wheel. I thought he was just out of it. It did strike me as odd how many officers were there. The drive home would have been better if it was silent. The rumblings of my old Volvo were the backdrop to our labored breathing. Gale was shaking and sweating furiously. I lost it when he asked me if I saw Andrew *slither* out of his car. I hadn’t gotten so much as an apology from him. He had spent the whole night ignoring me, I watched him laugh with Andrew before they bumped knuckles to race. So while I hadn’t thrown the first punch, I had initiated the fight. 

“Why are you still holding your head up?” The deputy probed. I realized the fresh paper towel I had pressed against my nose was still clean. I lower my head, the deputy staring me down. His eyes were squinty and deep-set. I felt a pang of guilt realizing it was absurdly late in the night. “Will you tell me what happened, or are we just going to keep having a staring contest?” 

“Right– I, um… My roommate and I got into a fight.” I said, suddenly at a loss for words. I couldn’t tell him we were at the races, hopefully he didn’t know. On top of that, I could barely process that I had been cheated on. How was I supposed to admit it to a complete stranger? I had only crossed paths with Crass a handful of times. What if he was like the folks back home? I had no way of knowing if it was safe for me to tell him I was gay. 

“You were at the races tonight, right?” The deputy looked closer at my face. “You were stumbling all over the place, completely wasted.” 

I kept my mouth shut. I did not need a D.U.I or a lecture on the dangers of drinking and driving on top of everything. Surveying me, the deputy stood up and got me a bottle of water. I thanked him, but when I took a sip, I realized my lip had also been split.

“Do you and your roommate fight often?” He asked. 

“Not like this. Not normally, at least.” I replied. 

“What was the catalyst tonight then? The race put you guys on edge?” the deputy poked. 

I nodded, pressing my fingers to the bridge of my swollen nose. The shock had started to wear off, and my whole face felt singed with pain. I was sick of questions, sick of being bossed around and betrayed. I needed a drink and a long, *long* nap.

 “I’m sorry for intruding like this.” I say, “Thank you for your help, but it's late. I should go.” 

“Where?” The deputy asked. 

“A hotel. Why do you care?”

“Do you have your keys? How are you going to get a room?” 

I press my hands around the pockets of my jeans. He was right. I cursed at myself. In the frenzy of the fight, I had lost my keys. Even if I did have my wallet, but I doubted I even had enough money for the Motel 6. I pressed my fingers harder against my nose. 

“Hey, quit it! You’ll make it bleed again.” The deputy swatted at my hand, “Wha– Shit man, are you crying?” 

“Damn it.” I wipe my face pathetically. 

“Relax.” The deputy's tone went several octaves softer. 

I was humiliated at how nice it felt not to be yelled at. Even if it was just because the Deputy wanted me to stop crying. 

“Look, I won’t kick you out or make you go back there. It’s my civil duty to protect people. That's why I let you in in the first place.” 

“I don’t have anywhere to go.” I whisper. I cringed when I rubbed my bruised eye. 

""Family? Friends? Anywhere I can drop you off.” 

I shook my head. I moved to Louisiana with Gale when I was eighteen. Gale had lived here his whole life up until he moved to Maine during our junior year. At the age, I was in the darkest spot I had ever been. I was mad at everything. When Gale came around, he told me he had friends down south, friends who would be okay with the two of us dating. And the idea of beging welcomed somewhere enticed me. I left Maine with my boyfriend of two years without realizing that Gale’s idea of friends were a bunch of redneck drag racers who only tolerated queer people because they were too scared to admit they were themselves.

“Then you can stay here.” The deputy said. “I’ll set you up in the living room. In the morning, you can go get your things, then we will be out of each other's hair.” 

""You don’t have to do-” 

“And I wouldn’t if you had anywhere else to go.” He snaps back. I see him cringe at his outburst. “What happened to Ross was rough on everyone who saw it. Victoria’s boy, Gale’s too.” He said her name like it struggled to comply with his tongue. 

My lip throbbed, but I spat, “He wasn’t Gale’s boy.” Countertops be damned. 

The deputy pauses. I can see him putting the pieces together—the puzzle of Blance Spheres’ catastrophic dating life. I blinked repeatedly, refusing to cry again. 

“What I meant to say is that crowd is no good. It would do you some good to stay out of it.” 

When I don’t answer, he hands up again. I almost don’t take it when he reaches his hand out to me. His grip is firm, his hands are big and haired slightly at the knuckles. 

“Crass Blackwell.” He states. I notice the exclusion of his first name. I do not question it. 

""Blance Sphere,” I say back.

2

Crass Blackwell was the type to wake up with the birds. The precision with which he handled his espresso machine gave the impression that he refused to sleep in, even if we had been awake well into the night. I had to recount the night's previous events, trying to sort them out through my throbbing headache. Gale and I had broken up, and I had absolutely nowhere to go. I groaned at everything and buried my face into my hands. The clothes Crass let me borrow were baggy on me, but I didn’t think they would fit him either. I couldn’t imagine a shirt that was only a little baggy around my shoulders fitting him. It smelled clean. In fact, everything in his apartment smelled like disinfectant. That, combined with the espresso machine whirring away, did not alleviate my hangover. From the kitchen, Crass flicked on a small radio. He hummed along to a Randy Travis song, tapping his spoon to the beat. I couldn’t wrap my head around him. The state of his apartment reminded me of folks back in Maine. Educated and prestigious with an air of superiority that I avoid like the plague. He drank from a gentrified hippie espresso machine while dressed like a hick. I was fairly confident he knew Gale and I *were* a couple, and the fact that he didn’t seem to mind layered the confusion even thicker. I’d grown so accustomed to stereotyping people for my safety that I forgot people aren't one-dimensional. It was a little comical when I thought about it. Of course, not every man who wears wife-beaters and listens to country is a threat. 

""Coffee?” Crass called out. “I know you’re awake.” 

I sighed. I was grateful that Crass had taken me in, but I was still humiliated to talk to him. I’d hoped to sneak out and never see him again, but he apparently woke up at 6:00 a.m. every morning. His back was turned when I walked into the kitchen. He was hunched over the stove, frying eggs in the same pan as a steak. He was now softly singing a country song I didn’t recognize. I took the coffee mug he left out for me and struggled with the espresso machine. It felt wrong for me to touch something so expensive while my knuckles and nailbeds were bloodied. 

“I cut up some watermelon,” Crass said, “ stuff does wonders for hangovers.” 

“I don’t like to eat in the morning,” I reply 

He raises an eyebrow at me. He sits down and gestures to the chair in front of him. I sit down and sip my coffee, trying not to look at him. 

“Can I ask you something?” Crass asks, snagging the Tupperware of watermelon from me. He doesn’t wait for me to answer, “Do you know Victoria?” 

“Andrew’s girl?” I clarify. I had seen her plenty; she was hard to miss. She had a stark black bob and looked more like a vampire than a person. I knew vaguely that she practiced some form of spiritualism. Some of the guys at the races called her a witch.

“So you do know her?” Crass ran a hand through his hair; I looked away as a few strands fell into his eyes. 

“I know *of* her.” I take another long sip of coffee. It burns the busted part of my lip. I try not to flinch at the pain. “She drives the black Ford RS200. One of the best racers this county has seen. Or so I’m told.” I add in the last part, painfully aware that I am still an outsider to the locals.

“That sounds like her.” Crass cut into his steak that looked like it could still moo. I bite back a wave of nausea. “We knew each other as kids.” 

""Oh yeah?” I ask. 

“She’s my stepsister.” 

I recall a vague memory of when I first moved to Belle County. Gale had told me of the controversy a decade back when the sheriff married a woman with a little girl. That baby must have been Victoria. Now that I thought about it I could see the resemblance between the two. They both had keen, honey-colored eyes and razor-sharp jawlines, traits that must have been inherited from their late mother. 

“Since you were in the scene, I figured you might know her, thats all.” Crass said, “I’ve been trying to get in touch with her for the better part of two years.” 

I pull at the scabs around my knuckles. Envelopes pop into my mind. My folks from Maine had sent hundreds of letters when I moved. I never opened any of them. They still come in the mail around christmas time, even eight years later, I refuse to forgive their senders. Each holiday, I send them through the papershredder. 

I had a suspicion that Victoria didn’t want Crass to contact her. However, I didn’t understand why. They may not share the same father, or believe in the same things, but Crass hadn’t given the impression of caring about either of those things. As if it read my mind, Crass began to speak again. 

“Never mind. Even if you did know her, and she was avoiding me, you wouldn’t tell me right.” 

I agree and Crass sighs. He looks at the sweater I’m wearing. “A woman's sweater doesn’t look half bad on you.” 

I nearly spit out my coffee. “Pardon?” 

Crass shakes his head. It pisses me off how cheerful he is when last night he was acting like a total jerk. “None of my stuff would fit you. It was my old roomates. She left it behind.” 

I ran into Crass’s now ex-roommate a few times. I never caught her name, but she was almost always in equestrian attire. Apparently, she did have normal people's clothes, such as pale blue sweaters. 

“You know,” Crass started, his voice flat, “Just throwing this out there: You’re out of a place to live and it’s hard to manage this whole place when I’m always gone. You could stay here, pay me, help me get back in touch with Victoria.” 

I felt my jaw go slack and I leaned forward. 

“You want me,” I pointed at myself and let out at a laugh laced with bitterness, “The guy who begged his way inside to bleed all over your pristine countertops, who you obviously think is a drunk, to live here?” 

Crass finished the rest of his breakfast, his fork scraping against the ceramic plate. He sighed into his hand.

“I said to *try* and not bleed on my countertops, not that you did.” His tone was dry, “And yeah, you were wasted last night, but that doesn’t mean I think you’re a permanent drunk. I’m not gonna blame you for having a bad night. A *really* bad night.” He corrected himself. “It’s not rocket science, I have a room. You need a room. We split expenses and nobody ends up sleeping in their car.” He paused before adding, “Unless you like sleeping in your car.” 

My stomach did a weird flip. I wasn’t sure if it was last night's alcohol or my desperate need to dig my heels into the ground and tell Crass off. But my mind flicks through the thought of a bed, shower, and fridge somewhere that isn’t Gale’s apartment. 

“And this isn’t because you just feel bad for me?” I cave.

“Do you really think I’d feel bad for a man who insulted my character? This isn’t charity work either, it’s a way for me to shovel some cash into savings and a way for you not to be homeless. Win-win.” He mused. “Unless you have some rich aunt to go and live with.” 

I imagined my parents' faces if they knew I was contemplating living with a male deputy in rural Louisiana. “No rich aunts… Just Gale.” His name tasted like rot in my mouth. 

“Right.” Crass drew out the word, “I figured. So do I need to set up a *For Rent* sign?” 

“We need to set up some ground rules,” I say. 

“Oh yeah? Like what?” 

“Next time I come home with a bloody nose, you cannot lecture me about getting it on your counters. They will be *our* counters. And,” I pause, looking around, “we listen to something other than Randy Travis.” 

“Deal. But I make no promises on the radio.” I saw lips turn into something almost resembling a smirk underneath his stubble. “You can have the radio when I’m gone.” 

I watched as he gestured to a calendar on the fridge. The sardine-packed, neat handwriting in each column would make you think it was his itinerary for the whole year, but upon closer inspection, it was just for this week. 

“You plan your bathroom breaks?” I raised an eyebrow, “So I can play music in the morning from 6:15 to 6:20 five days a week?” 

“If I’m gone, I suppose so. I’ll warn you, I am usually done by 6:17.” 

“Don't you stress yourself out with an itinerary for every moment of your day? I think they have medications for whatever you're doing.” 

“Don’t push it. I still have that *For Rent* sign.” He cocked his head at me, “And I plan for peace of mind. I always know what's coming next.” 

I shook my head. It was ridiculous, but its unanimity felt especially appealing after yesterday's uncertainty. At least with Crass, I wouldn’t have to worry about him disappearing for days on end, or forgetting rent. It felt too good to be true. Did Crass really want nothing from him other than rent? 

“What about Victoria?” I ask. 	

“Don’t worry about her.” Crass replied, “But, if you run into her… *Please* tell her I need to speak with her.” 

There was a real reason behind this. Being a pawn in Crass’s game to reunite with his estranged sister wasn’t the worst thing I could be a part of. God knows I’d gone through worse. 

…

My pile of clothes sat juxtaposed to the rest of Crass’s apartment. What Gale hadn’t destroyed was lazily thrown around. Watching Crass fruitlessly try to organize things between hauls, I felt a little bad. The two of us took three trips to transfer all my stuff across the lawn. It made me remember how much I left behind in Maine. While living with Gale, I never even tried to rebuild my belongings.

“You had a nice record collection in the bedroom,” Crass said as he set down my nightstand. 

“They were all Gales,” I reply. 

“No shit. There had to be at least a hundred of them.” 

I scoff at the irony of it all. Gale never liked it when I bought materialistic things, but his record collection was fine. He didn’t even listen to half of the musicians. 

“You should see his baseball card collection.” My voice is dry. It hurts to think of Gale’s things. They all remind me of him, or who I thought he was. 

When Crass was done excessively wiping his hands down with a pocket sanitizer, something I tried not to take offense to, he slapped his hands on his knees. 

“Welp. I should leave you to it.” He pointed to a door down the kitchen's hallway. "" That’s your room. I’m going to use the rest of my day off to run some errands. God knows I’m already two hours behind.” 

It was only 8:00 a.m., and I already felt like I had lived two lifetimes. I scooped up my pile of clothes in one swift motion before walking down the hall and promptly tossing them to the floor. I dug out a pair of sheets and draped them over the bed. I brought them from Maine, and while living with Gale, I hadn’t used them since. I knew I needed to take a shower badly. My hair had been in the same bun for the last twenty-four hours, and I could feel it sticking to my neck. I had to remind myself that it was okay to snoop around for towels when I lived here now. Besides, Crass would probably be more upset if I got his bathroom floors wet than if I poked around a few storage closets. I eventually found them, half expecting them to be folded into swans; they were not. I grabbed three, hoping that wasn’t too greedy of me. I laid one out on the floor, one for my body, and the other for my hair. 

I stripped down in the tiny bathroom. The lighting was soft with a yellow glow, but didn’t hide all the black and blue. I try to run fingers through the sweat-stained hair around my collarbones. I leaned into the mirror and ran a shaking hand across the bruise blossoming on my nose. Gale fist did this. But the real damage wasn’t physical. I ran the sink, and like the water, I felt eight years of my life go down the drain. I scanned myself up and down. I flipped through every moment Gale and I had spent together. What caused it? Was it when I poked fun at his card collection, or picked a fight over his spending habits? I loved Gale fiercely. I told him everything. I always assumed he would come to me if he ever had doubts. I heard Gale in my head. “I slept with Andrew.” There wasn’t even a flicker of remorse when he said it. It was like a punch to the gut, then again, Andrew’s death had felt just as sudden. Everything was hitting me hard this morning. 

I didn’t recognize myself in the mirror. I always had a rough idea of where life would take *us*. But now, the man who stared back was clueless to what a future without Gale looked like. ",1,1749801726.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

My husband Carter Kingsley's whole family has never liked me.  
  
That much, I've always known.  
  
His father avoids all family matters like the plague.  
  
His mother looks down on my middle-class background.  
  
And Carter?  
  
His heart was never mine to begin with.  
  
But our son, Ethan Kingsley, is six now.  
  
Bright. Charming.  
  
And I just couldn't bring myself to leave him.  
  
He even started learning French—and picked it up fast.  
  
Now he and Carter talk in French around the house like it's their own secret club.  
  
At first, I was proud.  
  
A child I gave birth to, so smart, making his father proud.  
  
It made me want to hold on to this family, even just a little longer.  
  
Until I started secretly studying French myself.  
  
And slowly, I began to understand what they were really saying.  
  
And little by little, my heart froze over.  
  
Turns out my own child, just like his father, was learning French not for school,  
  
But to please Vivienne—the woman Carter's always loved.  
  
Vivienne, the childhood sweetheart who went off to France for grad school.  
  
They were inseparable once,  
  
But Carter's churchgoing, conservative parents rejected her—  
  
Not for who she was, but because a pastor-turned-""counselor"" told them she was a poor match for the Kingsley legacy.  
  
Meanwhile, I—a girl from an average Ohio family—was married into this Manhattan dynasty because that same counselor said I would bring ""stability and prosperity.""  
  
So I spent the last seven years in a marriage built on a prophecy—and completely devoid of love.  
  
I was lost in thought when the sharp clang of Carter's fork against his plate snapped me out of it.  
  
He frowned like he always does when I take a second too long to think.  
  
""Vivienne's back in the States. She's pregnant.""  
  
""She'll be moving in so we can help take care of her.""  
  
His eyes locked on me, full of warning.  
  
""She's carrying a child now. Don't start any drama.""  
  
Yeah. Pregnant women are delicate.  
  
Funny how that didn't apply when I was the one pregnant.  
  
Back then, only the baby mattered—never me.  
  
Even when I hemorrhaged during labor,  
  
As long as Ethan made it out of the delivery room alive,  
  
Carter never even came to check if I survived.  
  
I nodded.  
  
I didn't ask who the baby's father was.  
  
Back in the day, if Vivienne had tried to get even close to this house,  
  
I would've lost my mind.  
  
I fought. Screamed.  
  
And Carter only ever gave me cold indifference.  
  
But now, after understanding everything they whisper in French, I felt nothing.  
  
""I'll move out for a while,"" I said.  
  
""Give her space to rest.""  
  
Carter paused.  
  
Before he could respond, Ethan lit up with joy.  
  
""If Mommy's gone, does that mean I can be with Aunt Vivienne every day?""  
  
Even the smartest kid can't hide how he really feels.  
  
Carter stared into my eyes.  
  
Was he trying to figure out what I was planning?  
  
Or if I even had the strength left to care?  
  
For a second, maybe I imagined it—but I thought I saw something soft flicker in his gaze.  
  
Still, Vivienne and her baby came first.  
  
Carter said gently, ""The house is big. No need to move out.  
  
But we have a place out in Westchester.  
  
I'll have it signed over to you.  
  
You can go there whenever you want… clear your head.""  
  
I understood.  
  
This was my reward for ""being mature.""  
  
He hated that I might have tainted the family line.  
  
So now he was making sure his first love could carry their perfect child.  
  
No matter the cost.  
  
And he was willing to be generous about it.  
  
Which made me wonder—  
  
When the baby I'm carrying is born, will he be even more generous?  
  
After all, this time, I made sure Carter has nothing to do with it.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Vivienne moved in early that morning.  
  
I was in the garden watering and trimming my cosmos flowers.  
  
They were the only things in this cold, loveless house that bloomed because of me.  
  
Vivienne held her pregnant belly with one hand, covering her nose with the other.  
  
""Don't bother trimming them,"" she said with a dramatic sigh.  
  
""I can't stand the smell. Just get rid of them.""  
  
I stood and wiped some dirt off my cheek.  
  
Vivienne squinted at me, then seemed to realize something.  
  
""Oh—sorry, didn't realize it was you, Sienna.""  
  
'I thought you were the gardener.""  
  
She offered a tight smile.  
  
""Well, if these flowers are yours, I guess you'd be too sentimental to tear them out.""  
  
""I'll just deal with it.""  
  
Carter, standing beside her with a hand on her lower back, frowned.  
  
""You're pregnant. You don't have to ‘deal with' anything.""  
  
""It's just a bunch of flowers. Get rid of them.""  
  
I glanced down at the garden and gave a small smile.  
  
Carter thought I was hesitating, ready to scold me.  
  
But instead, I nodded.  
  
""Sure. I've got something to do soon anyway.""  
  
""Just have the gardener take care of it.""  
  
Carter paused, caught off guard by how calmly I agreed.  
  
For a second, I thought I saw a flicker of sympathy in his eyes.  
  
""I'll have them replanted at the Westwood property,"" he said softly.  
  
""I know you put a lot into them.""  
  
I did love those flowers.  
  
They were one of the few things I had to hold on to in this house.  
  
But now, it didn't matter anymore.  
  
""Whatever you think is best,"" I replied.  
  
I checked my phone—my meeting with the investigator was in thirty minutes.  
  
I gave them both a polite nod.  
  
""Excuse me.""  
  
As I stepped past Carter, he suddenly grabbed my wrist.  
  
Vivienne looked at him, confused and slightly annoyed.  
  
He let go immediately.  
  
""Come back early,"" he said.  
  
""There's something I need to talk to you about.""  
  
I nodded.  
  
""Sure.""  
  
The moment I left the Kingsley estate, I could breathe again.  
  
Even if it was just for a little while.  
  
I met the investigator at a coffee shop downtown—the same one I used to frequent back in college.  
  
The owner did a double take when she saw me.  
  
I guess I didn't look like the girl she remembered.  
  
Ever since marrying Carter, I hadn't really lived.  
  
The Kingsleys thought places like this were too... common.  
  
The investigator handed me a file.  
  
""The ultrasound confirms Vivienne is about four months along.""  
  
""Which... doesn't match Mr. Kingsley's timeline.""  
  
So Carter's miracle child—wasn't even his.  
  
If he found out, would he be disgusted?  
  
Would he still want the baby just because it's Vivienne's?  
  
I looked up at the investigator.  
  
""If I don't divorce him, my child still has inheritance rights, right?""  
  
""Of course,"" he said without hesitation.  
  
I pressed a hand to my belly.  
  
""And what if the baby's not his?""  
  
He blinked, visibly thrown.  
  
""Well... if you're married, he's still legally obligated to support the child. But—""  
  
I cut him off with a shake of my head.  
  
That was all I needed to hear.  
  
If Carter expected me to raise his child with Vivienne...  
  
Then why couldn't I let him raise a child that wasn't his?  
  
Chapter 3  
  
When I got home, Eleanor Kingsley was fussing over Vivienne like she was a princess.  
  
They both looked up the moment I walked in.  
  
Their smiles dropped.  
  
Carter frowned.  
  
""Didn't I tell you not to come back yet?""  
  
I chuckled.  
  
""You told me to come back early.""  
  
""Said you had something to talk about.""  
  
Carter hesitated.  
  
He clearly forgot.  
  
He cleared his throat.  
  
""Doesn't matter now.""  
  
""The annual family dinner—Vivienne's handling it this year.""  
  
Every year, I handled that dinner.  
  
Because I was the Kingsley family's official wife.  
  
It was my duty.  
  
Eleanor nitpicked everything I ever did for those dinners.  
  
The menu, the flowers, the lighting—nothing was ever good enough.  
  
But at least it came with the title.  
  
Now that Vivienne was here, even that had been handed to her.  
  
I gave a tight-lipped smile.  
  
""Sure. It's your house, your call.""  
  
Carter frowned, like he expected me to fight back.  
  
Eleanor sniffed, pleased. ""At least you know your place.""  
  
She turned to Vivienne, her voice warm.  
  
""If you run into any trouble, just let me know, sweetheart.""  
  
Vivienne gave her a bashful smile, and Carter melted all over again.  
  
They launched into planning, forgetting I was still in the room.  
  
Laughing together.  
  
Ethan sat beside Vivienne, gently patting her belly.  
  
""This dinner's for my baby brother!""  
  
They looked like the perfect little family.  
  
And I—  
  
I was just background noise.  
  
I walked upstairs without another word.  
  
For days, I stayed out of sight.  
  
They loved it.  
  
Everyone was busy helping Vivienne plan the big event.  
  
But this wasn't her world.  
  
She got overwhelmed quickly.  
  
I overheard her one evening, curled up in Carter's arms.  
  
""I can't even get a stupid dinner right... I'm useless.""  
  
Carter held her tighter.  
  
""No, baby. You're doing great. It's your first time.""  
  
The next night, Carter knocked on my door.  
  
That alone was unusual.  
  
When I opened it, he didn't waste time.  
  
""Vivienne's overwhelmed.""  
  
""She's pregnant, and this dinner is a lot. Help her out.""  
  
I smiled.  
  
""When I handled my first dinner, I was eight months pregnant.""  
  
He looked surprised.  
  
Like he'd only just remembered that.  
  
Back then, I was on my feet every day, planning menus and centerpieces, weeks from giving birth.  
  
No one offered to help.  
  
No one cared.  
  
And now?  
  
A little guilt on his face didn't mean a damn thing.  
  
I cut him off before he could apologize.  
  
""I'll help with the background stuff.""  
  
'Let her handle the main event. She deserves to shine, right?""  
  
Carter blinked, clearly thrown.  
  
""You're really okay letting her take the spotlight?""  
  
After all, the dinner was always the First Lady's stage.  
  
And I was giving it up.  
  
""She is carrying the next Kingsley,"" I said calmly.  
  
Carter opened his mouth like he wanted to say something else.  
  
But I'd already closed the door.  
  
He stood there for a while.  
  
Maybe realizing I wasn't the woman who used to beg for his attention.  
  
Maybe realizing I didn't need him anymore.

If you're heading to Bali and wondering what to buy beyond the usual “I ❤️ Bali” t-shirts — here’s a list of things that are *actually* worth bringing back. Some are great for gifts, others for yourself, and many support local artisans and businesses.

# 1. Natural Skincare & Spa Products

Bali is full of natural beauty brands using coconut oil, essential oils, and local herbs.  
**What to look for:**

* Body scrubs, massage oils, natural soaps
* Essential oil blends (great for sleep or headaches)
* Bali-based brands like *Sensatia Botanicals*, *Utama Spice*, *Bali Alus*

Pro tip: Buy at official stores or local markets - airport prices are way higher.

# 2. Textiles & Clothing

Great selection of flowy linen clothes, sarongs, handmade batik, and ikat fabrics.

**Where to buy:**

* Ubud Art Market (haggle gently!)
* Threads of Life (supports traditional weavers)
* Canggu or Seminyak boutiques for more modern styles

Pro tip: Sarongs are also required for temples - pick a pretty one and it doubles as a souvenir.

# 3. Balinese Coffee & Herbal Tea

Locally grown and rich in flavor. You’ll find Bali Arabica, robusta, and spice blends like ginger or turmeric teas.

**Try:**

* *Kintamani* coffee (highland-grown)
* Local jamu powders (traditional herbal mix for digestion & energy)

Pro tip: Buy from small coffee shops or roasters, not tourist trap ""coffee plantations"" that push civet coffee.

# 4. Local Snacks & Treats

Great for gifting or snacking on the flight home.

* *Pia Legong* (famous pastry, get it fresh in Denpasar)
* Dried mango, jackfruit chips, coconut sweets
* *Bali chocolate* from brands like *Pod Chocolate*

# 5. Silver Jewelry

Ubud and the village of Celuk are known for handmade silver jewelry — rings, bracelets, and pendants.

**Tip:**

* Prices vary a lot, but many places offer custom work
* Look for .925 sterling silver stamps

# 6. Home Decor & Handicrafts

* Rattan bags, coconut bowls, macrame
* Wooden carvings, incense holders, dreamcatchers
* Bamboo and teak wood items

Buy from markets or village shops - not airport souvenir stores.

# What not to buy:

* Civet (kopi luwak) coffee - cruel and often fake
* Sand, coral, or shells from beaches (illegal & bad for the environment)
* Cheap ""Bali"" shirts from street stalls - they fall apart after one wash

Hope this helps someone prep their souvenir shopping list!

I see a lot of posts here with people exploring a variety of coffee. I am not looking for specific recommendation but rather your approach in deciding which coffee to buy.

**I have posted this in another subreddit, but I was really overwhelmed by the amount of conversations that turned sexual in a matter of three sentences**


I am a white female, searching for an Asian man. Ideally looking for the love of my life. I need to spice up my life- with laughter, conversations about WWII(or anything historical, tbh), lots of coffee, Sunday night drives and bonding over music! 

✨ I’m soft in all the right places and fiercely loyal

✨ I have a big heart and an even bigger sense of humor

✨ I’m naturally submissive, nurturing, and love making someone feel adored

✨ I’m flirty, fun, and absolutely down to send memes, voice notes, and shower you with attention

✨ I’m the kind of girl who remembers your favorite snack and your childhood trauma

✨ I may be small-town, but I dream big—and I know what I want


Now for you…

🔥 Asian. That's the only physical requirement—everything else is about your vibe.

🔥 Empathetic. I want someone who actually feels things.

🔥 Kind. Like, the ""helps old ladies and remembers my favorite sauce"" kind.

🔥 Funny. Dad jokes? Dry sarcasm? Let's go.

🔥 Weird is a plus. If you're normal, I can work with that too.

🔥 Must love music. Bonus if we can make a shared playlist and cry to it at some point.

🔥 Must be okay with the thermostat staying at 67°. Yes, I’ll pay the electric bill.

If you're legit, make the first sentence of your message your preferred meal!

Emotional cheating?,"I (47m) and my wife (53f) have been married for 15 years, about 20 years altogether. Until about last year, I was going through severe depression due to the loss of our newborn son. He was a twin, and passed when he was 1 month old (the other twin is a very healthy and happy girl). It was 8 years ago, but still affects me deeply to this day (I just recently entered therapy). My wife was better about her grieving process. She sought out professional help from the start and it helped her tremendously. This is where we diverged.

For the last several years, I was a shell of myself. I was distant. I was unresponsive. I was emotionally unavailable. This severely impacted our marriage. My detachment led to my wife distancing herself from me. I don't blame her. I was so focused on work and providing for our two kids (now 13 and 8) that I 150% neglected our relationship. I'm lucky she didn't leave me during that time.

About a year ago, she confronted me. Since, I've been doing everything I can to be a better man. I started therapy. I started working out. I cut my hair (which I let go from basically a buzz cut to a very long ponytail). I've tried to be more available. I honestly feel like I've been getting better, or at least trying. In the meantime, I've felt like while I've been trying, I was not getting the same from her. I get it, she put in SO much effort in the previous years while I was so distant, but why would she ask me to try, and then NOT put in any effort herself??? I don't know what to do now. 

Several months ago, AFTER she confronted me, I saw a text from a random dude about meeting up with her. Someone new she met at a SF social meetup. She's an extrovert so I'm used to her chatting up random dudes and flirting... no biggie. But in this case she clearly gave her number out to him. I confronted her about it and she said it was a ""networking meetup"" and dismissed it. I soon found out that it was actually a social meetup that happens about once a month... VERY different than what she described. 

Now, a few days ago, she left her phone by me when she went to take a shower and she leftt it unlocked. I'm not proud of it, but I went through it. To be honest I'm not sure I'm happy I did. In LinkedIn, I found messages with a ""career coach"" and their exchange could be interpreted either way (professional or personal). But he used terms like ""I'd love to see you"" and ""Just thinking of you"". Then, I found his number saved in her contacts under a different name (wtf!!!). I also found messages from a year ago where she sent pics of her lounging in bed in her robe... nothing sexual but again, wtf!!!. They also met up for a coffee date at that time. 

In WhatsApp, I found that she asked out a guy she met at one of these meetups. He said no... didn't want to distract from the meetup, but they still hangout. I don't know what to do.

Honestly, the frustration was overwhelming. Nothing in my life felt ""special"". 

After lots of trial and error (and probably too much stress), I finally found three exercises that actually helped me discover stories that were PS-worthy. Hope they help you too.

**1. The Work-Backwards Method:** 

Start with who you are today, then find the experiences that shaped you.

* List 3-5 of your core values, personality traits, or beliefs
* For each one, ask: ""What experience shaped this?""
* Pick the story that shows the most growth or insight

*Example: If you value empathy → think about when you learned to see things from others' perspectives*

**2. The ""Before vs. After"" Test:**

This one is all about significant events.

As my favorite author puts it: ""When you look back on your own time line there's a sharp spike somewhere along the way, some event that changed you, changed your life more than the others. **A moment that creates a before and an after.**""

* Think about experiences that created a ""before"" and ""after""
* Focus on internal changes, not just external events
* If you can't identify clear growth, try a different experience

*Example: Before: Someone who blamed parents for their divorce. After: Realized that parents are people too. Mistakes happen. Just because something (in this case, marriage) ends doesn't mean it failed.*

**3. The Ordinary Moments Exercise**

The best essay might be hiding in everyday experiences.

* Think about your weekly routine
* What small moments consistently matter to you?
* What do you do that others might find interesting or unusual?

*Example: Being the family translator, your morning coffee ritual, how you organize your room*

**Quick Notes:**

* The topic doesn't need to be dramatic. Small moments with big insights often work better.
* Focus on your takeaway, not the experience itself. What did you learn? How did you grow?
* Be specific. General topics lead to generic essays.

Your personal statement should feel authentically *you*. Good luck!

First off—respect. It takes guts to code nights and weekends, smash bugs before sunrise, and still believe life will reward you beyond stack traces and Carpal Tunnel. Unfortunately, you chose to hang your dreams on the **Odoo App Store**, a marketplace that treats devs like disposable coffee cups—use once, recycle feelings later.

# 1️⃣ The 30 % Shakedown

Apple takes 30 % and at least gives you a million-user addressable market and yearly *“Best of”* feels. Odoo takes 30 % for… what, exactly?

* **Marketing?** Their “search” shows the first module alphabetically (good luck if you’re not “AAA Accounting Add-on”).
* **Support?** The second your buyer hits “Install,” you inherit every ticket starting with “Your app broke my whole database—FIX IT.”
* **Quality control?** Sure, if you define “quality” as “still compiles under whichever nightly build they pushed five minutes ago.”

# 2️⃣ One-and-Done Revenue—AKA “The Donation Jar”

Odoo’s Enterprise Edition prints *recurring* per-database cash like a SaaS mint:

>

Meanwhile, you: sell once per **major Odoo version**—v17 buyers don’t pay again for v18. Yet when v18 drops, customers expect a shiny compatible build and… surprise! **You** spend nights porting code so they *might* repurchase. Odoo calls that “ecosystem agility”; your chiropractor calls it “recurring back pain.”

# 3️⃣ Zero Licensing Protection

Enterprise modules are locked behind the purple paywall; your code ships wide-open in `addons/` like a buffet for script kiddies:

* Customer buys once → zips it → shares with every partner in their Slack.
* You ask Odoo for license enforcement tools; they hand you a **“please read the LGPL”** PDF and a pat on the head.
* Any idea how many “cracked” mirrors of your module are on GitHub right now? Don’t search—it’ll ruin your Friday.

# 4️⃣ The Upgrade Hamster Wheel

Every October, Odoo drops a shiny vWhateversNext. Their Enterprise fee *jumps* as customers migrate—because “new tech, new value.”  
You? → **14-day death sprint**:

1. Diff 30 000 upstream commits.
2. Patch your codebase so it runs on the new version while maintaining the old one (because no one upgrades simultaneously).
3. Upload the new build to the App Store—again—for *each* edition.
4. Repeat in 12 months—but hey, exposure!

# 5️⃣ Partner Program FOMO

Odoo Partners resell Enterprise licenses and pocket commission forever; you write the features that make Enterprise tolerable and pocket… gratitude memes.

* They wine-and-dine at Partner Days; you’re stuck in the Slack channel answering “Does this support multicompany in v8?”
* They get lead-gen portals; you get an email once a month titled “Improve Your Listing—Try a New Screenshot.”

# So What Now?

* **Subscription-gate your own work.** If Odoo won’t protect you, add your own license server. Someone will still crack it, but at least you tried.
* **Offer paid SLA & upgrade contracts.** Turn support into predictable revenue—because you *already* do the work.
* **Band together.** A coalition of module authors can negotiate visibility, maybe even a better revenue split—strength in numbers beats lone-dev martyrdom.
* **Or** keep accepting the 30 % haircut and telling yourself “It builds my portfolio.” Just remember: portfolios don’t pay hosting bills.

**Bottom line:** You’re basically the street magician outside a Vegas casino—drawing crowds, creating the vibe, and getting spare change while the house rakes in millions. Time to up your hustle, friend—Odoo sure isn’t lowering the rake anytime soon.",1,1749800401.0,odooroast,0,1.0,False

TL;DR: why are friendships with ADHD so hard and why do people think that having reactions and emotions is ""being dramatic""?

My life got turned upside down due to a recent trip with my friends that I was sooooo looking forward to. I went there with 4 friends: 2 of them I knew well and/or for longer, two were nice and in a common sport group for a while. 
In the beginning of the trip, it was only three of us: me and two girls, who were until recently primarily friends of mine. One is my brother's gf and has been my partner in the sport we train for more than 1.5 years and we hang out plenty the two of us, let's call her Kelly. And the other is from a friend group with my partner and his friends that I've been a part of for 4+ years (trips, sport, board games together), let's call her Meg. So, it was all good for a first couple of days, but then Kelly and Meg became super friendly, which would be fine, but at the same time they started freezing me out, most jokes were aimed at me and some jokes started feeling like jabs. They'd come up with nicknames for each other and would sit together at a dinner table or couch next to each other and joke at things/photos they mostly wouldn't share with me. Whenever Kelly made some comment about my behavior, like she disapproved of something, even minor, Meg would jump right in and second her, which was so unnecessary and it made me feel like them vs me in couple of situations.
I felt bad, but told myself to bury this feeling and hang on, since these types of sometimes ""borderline"" jokes are Kelly's thing. I told myself she's like that, she's the center of attention, always joking, but she also likes me right? And she still was my partner when we were doing our sport (Meg wasn't available until late afternoons, courseload thing). 

Finally two remaining girls joined us, let's call them Ana and Tess. From that day, Kelly and Meg cut me out even more - Kelly wouldn't be my partner while we were doing sports, she was kinda snappy with me at times and it felt like she was avoiding me overall. I tried being optimistic and friendly, but it felt so lonely. Things got so bad I even considered cutting my trip short, buying an earlier flight and coming back home, but long story short(er), I didn't want to cause any problems for them or cause drama, so I stayed. Well, that didn't work out either. They'd  sometimes would cut me off when I was talking or ignored me and didn't answer, they'd snap at me when I was saying something, they'd be super supportive and excited about each other's sport accomplishments, but mine often felt like an afterthought; mostly it was Kelly and Meg. It felt like some parts of them, that didn't come up in all these years of friendships, started to resonate with one another and all their (buried? Unrealized?) dislike for me grew so strong, that it boiled past the point of containment - like you know, when every little thing some does annoys you because you just don't like them.
We were living, eating and doing sports together the 5 of us so there was hardly ever time to have a conversation just one on one with Kelly, which I really wanted and tried to find an appropriate space for.

I wanted to help regulate myself and talk to someone, so I tried talking to the most sympathetic of the girls, Ana, about how I felt. She shut me down pretty much immediately, saying them not letting me say things (like recommending coffee...) is them expressing healthy boundaries, that I am just jealous of their friendship, that they wouldn't have invited me if they didn't like me, that I am causing the situation in a way because I'm sad and withdrawing from them. It felt like she dismissed all my feelings and put the weight of the situation fully on me. Then she asked me (after what was a couple minutes long ""conversation"") if I go to therapy. Auch. 
Then I finally found courage and space to talk to Kelly. She seemed nice and sympathetic in this conversation, but basically the message was the same. They really like me, I freeze myself out because I withdraw, not because they freeze me out, and she slipped in the message that I talk too much, so either I have to hold myself back more, or expect them not to listen because what I say is not that interesting for them. And apparently, she's been feeling this way for a while but never told me. She also admitted that sometimes when she does well in our sport and I do worse, she feels that I'm sad so.. she had decided she'd train only with other people during this trip. And that ""maybe this is why I felt left out"". She also asked if I go to therapy. This talk was on a 10 min walk to the store, so also not optimal but it felt like at least my problem was in the open, I asked for support in a way.

Next days felt better, but we came back to the original group of 3 girls at the end of the trip and it got kinda nasty. Snapping, blaming me, them standing far away from me - I felt like an odd and annoying person in a 2 vs 1 scenario. We got back home, I thought things would calm down and we'd talk, hash it out and case closed cause we're friends after all. Well.. here comes the Absolute Fallout:

Meg hasnt said a word to me since we got back, and I found out through the grapevine that we may no longer meet as a group. My partner talked to Meg's partner, and their friendship will be preserved, but they probably will meet just them to avoid tension.
After returning, I asked Kelly if she wanted to do weekend training together as we have done for so long, and she said no - she wants to process her emotions and she doesn't want to train with me for a while. Okay. I asked her to let me know when she wanted to meet up and talk. She left my message on read and that was the last time we talked. She no longer speaks a word to me on our group trainings and on the weekend she trains with her new best friend Meg. 
Tess reached out, saying she's heard that there were still some issues, and if I'd like to talk. I felt so grateful that someone finally wants to hear me out as well, but something in her message felt wrong, and it turns out she wasn't interested in talking or listening to me. She talked to the other girls and they had some conclusions, and she wanted to meet with me to talk to me about therapy, because - I quote - I pressure people to fulfill my emotional needs and no adult likes to be pressured; it was all framed like care and worry about me and idk, maybe it was. Although I felt so hurt that she hasn't spend even 5 minutes talking to me, yet she ""diagnosed me"".

I tried talking to my brother, who is also Kelly's gf. I held off for almost a month but it felt like he knew nothing about the situation and was still planning future events as if nothing happened. He listened and seemed to get it, only to later text me that ""this is too much drama, he doesn't care, we need to figure it out ourselves"" and we basically don't see each other anymore.

I low key quit my sport group and my favorite trainer because I feel so crappy there. Also now I know they all talk about me, but not to me and they all consider me to be some broken person who they just should cut out of their lives and send to therapy. I basically have no sports partner and no group I used to play boardgames, travel, laugh with and do sports together, so the fallout for me has been enormous. I feel so used by Kelly, like she tolerated me until she didn't need me anymore cause she found someone she likes more to train with, and my group of friends I invited her to, now became hers and she gladly took over..

What do I do in this situation? Some people tell me to text Kelly again and talk to her but.. I reached out first, both during the trip and after, and she was the one to turn me down and freeze me out. Would you message all of them?
I really thought these were the things of highschool, not adults in their 30s, but still it doesn't seem to hurt much less than back then ",1,1749800295.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

Gen X here. Yeah, the ones you kinda forgot about. We’ve been out here the whole time, fixing your pipes, wiring your buildings, keeping the lights on while you’re busy making inspirational TikToks.

We didn’t grow up with Wi-Fi. We grew up with *figure it out or mess it up.* Our dads handed us a wrench and said, “Don’t strip it.” That was the whole training program.

No YouTube tutorials, no safety lectures. Just grit, sweat, and a flashlight in your teeth while your old man yelled at you for breathing too loud.

We worked through recessions and tech bros telling us “AI’s gonna replace you.” Yeah, good luck having a robot fix a busted sewer at 3 AM in February, Carl! 

We show up early, leave late, eat lunch leaning on a truck. Don’t need an app to measure twice and cut once.

Boomers yell “back in my day,” Millennials cry because there’s no oat milk. Meanwhile, we’re welding steel, patching roofs, and laughing at your emotional support water bottles.

We don’t want praise. Just parts on time, a customer who trusts us, and coffee that doesn’t taste like regret.

Still here. Still dusty. Still getting it done. And if you think this job’s gonna be easy when we retire, good luck. That noise you hear? That’s us walking off the site, toolbox in hand, middle finger raised.

Kinwento ko to sa close friends ko and ang sabi lang nila sakin ay iwan ko na siya. I dont have much friends kaya kakapit ako dito sa reddit for advice. 

Nag start kami mag LDR last september nung umalis siya ng bansa para mag aral. 27 siya, 22 ako still in college. So since weve been together (1 year ago), magkaibang point in our lives talaga kami. He wants to explore na and travel, pero i cant pa since wala pang funds and busy sa school work. We make it work naman. 

So eto na nga, weve prepared for this na mag mamasters siya and ang worry ko lang talaga for him is introvert siya so baka mahirapan siya mag make friends. Nung simula, lagi pa kami magkacall and umiyak pa siya once kasi nga nahihirapan siya mag adjust. 

One day nabanggit niya na he made a new friend na bago bago lang din so nag click sila. Sobra saya ko na may friend na siya. The following weeks, tuwing magkacall kami, napansin ko na lagi niyang binabanggit yung friend niya, ke kung anong ginawa nila that day or plano nilang gawing gala sa weekend. Natuwa naman ako kasi naging masaya na uli siya finally. Later on nagrerecommend na siya ng shows na panoorin ko kasi pinapanood nila nung friend niya. Nagtampo ako ng pajoke na sabi ko kami nalang manood nun, and mejo di siya natuwa doon. Madami na daw kami pinapanood together. Then one time nag gala sila nung saturday. Nag hike sila pati kumain at coffee shop na SILANG DALAWA LANG. Throughout that day ang dalang ng updates niya sakin, pero pag nagsesend ng photos either pic niya taken by someone else (alam na bali na yung friend yung kumuha), pic ng scenery na kasama yung friend, or selfie nila. Alam ko na updates to pero i couldnt help but feel jealous. Then nung gabi nag inom pa sila tapos kinabukasan ko na siya nakausap uli. Nagovernight daw si friend kasi nalasing sila. So mejo nagalit na ko and nagsend ng long message. Sinabi ko din na i wanna talk to the friend sa call, pero friendly lang. Para maging friend ko na din siya. 

After nun, di na siya palakwento about him. Pero I know they still spend a lot of time together. I see his ig stories and lagi talaga sila magkatabi ng boyfriend ko. Pero he says his friend is good for him and his mental health. 

So naging on going pinagaawayan namin to. Fast forward a few months, umuwi siya for a quick vacation, and since saglit lang siya, i avoided mentioning the friend. All good naman and sweet siya sakin. Pero one night, after making love he left his phone sa room habang naliligo siya and I couldnt help it. So i checked his messages. Sobrang dalas nila mag usap, and sobrang saya pa na tuloy tuloy. Nagsesend sila ng pics ng food na kinakain nila, may selfies pa sa cr. Nothing obscene naman pero alam mo yung pacute na photos. Tapos may nickname pa sila sa isat isa. ""Langya"" yung tawagan nila wtf. For context Langga ang tawag niya sakin. I also saw na nagkkwento siya about mga away namin and what he should do about it. Yung response nung friend is laging pacool down nalang muna tapos magyaya ng something else. Nag jojoke pa sila na nagyaya mag jakol together. Parang magchachat yung isa na bored, then rereply niya is tra jakol nlng (wtf?????)

Then the worst is tinignan ko yung secure folder niya and may isang pic lang don. Close up pic ng face nung friend niya na tulog na kitang walang shirt. Wtfffff nag ccheat ba ba siya sakin???

Lahat nung friends ko sinasabi iwan ko na siya. Pero di naman kami laging nagaaway about him. We still have a lot of normal days at dinedate parin niya ko kahit ldr. We watch movies parin and stuff. Ayoko sabihin sakanya yung mga nakita ko sa phone niya kasi that was a betrayal of his trudy pero honestly idk what to do. Alam ko may bi tendencies na talaga siya even before we got together.

1la9xed,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeddingsPhilippines/comments/1la9xed/graduated_earlier_this_month_here_are_my_suppliers/,Graduated earlier this month. Here are my suppliers,"Hi. I graduated on June 3. I'm sharing my suppliers here to help you decide and give you an idea na din if ever we are on the same situation. A little background muna. My husband and I have been living together for a long time already and we are an older couple (this is why the minister we hired suggested Article 34 na, no need for marriage license). I have coordinated a couple of weddings of my friends and family so I basically had a good idea of where to go and what to do. However, we wanted a very intimate wedding because we both don't like to be the center of attention, and that's very difficult to avoid when you're the one getting married.

At first I opted for restaurants with conference/meeting rooms or any private area para intimate talaga. My husband was hesitant, parang di nya talaga feel na restaurant lang. So I said if we were to book an events venue talaga, kahit maliit pa, we should do it right. So we started looking for QC venues (tamad po kami travel hahaa) but there's this one venue in Mandaluyong that promised to take care of almost everything na. And that's exactly what we wanted. We had no entourage (not even ninongs/ninangs) but just two witnesses to sign the papers. We held the very short ceremony and the reception on the same place.

Venue: **Terrasse** (Lancaster Hotel, Mandaluyong)

We chose the 50 pax upgraded package. So it's P60k. It's on the penthouse pero now I saw that they have a new area (same location din) if you are less than 70 pax.  Sa usapan namin, if 50 pax, half of the venue lang, but nagulat kami that the whole venue was used. Not complaining because that's actually a good thing. No need for crew meal for their staff daw. But they offer crew meal (200 each) for your outside suppliers. Sa kanila na din ako kumuha para wala na problem.  I have feedback from my guests that they loved how the venue handled everything. Ang ganda ng venue and ang ayos ng program.

Here are the inclusions:

* 5-course dinner - some are good, others ok naman. Di na kami nag-addition kasi we also got the grazing table for 50 pax (+7.5k)
* sounds & lights
* photographer - He was good but as expected, hindi masyado nakuha ang good angles ng important moments, like the first kiss. But I did ask for him to photograph candid moments of guests, and madami naman. The photos were delivered around four days after the event.
* two-layered cake (one layer edible) - they followed my instructions to the letter. Simple lang naman cake namin but maganda ang kinalabasan.
* wine for toasting (we opted out of this)
* host - Ms. Maloi. I asked for a classy, corporate-style hosting and she delivered! I told her our guests are all shy so feeling ko walang napahiya sa games nya. And she could sing. I didn't expect her to sing but it was done beautifully. Didn't expect such a good host kasi kasama lang sa package eh.
* event coordinator - The venue gave me two. Ms. Carol and Ms. Riccar. They have been so wonderful and helpful. Lahat nakaalalay talaga sila. And even sa mga leftovers ng food and kahit leftovers sa outside suppliers, they had them packed for us to bring home. Couldn't have asked for better coordinators.
* photobooth (unlimited for two hours) - may option to upgrade to magnets but di na namin kinuha. As expected, patok sa guests to. Di ko pa nakukuha digital copies. I was told they would be given to me two weeks after the event.
* AVP slideshow
* stage backdrop and table centerpiece - May mga styles na pagpipilian and meron ding upgraded designs. We chose the basic designs. But they made sure to capture our motif. And they did. The guests said they loved the styling daw. It's simple pero the colors popped out.

HMUA: **Kylachameleon**

I actually got her name from one of the replies on a post here. Hesitant pa ko kasi she's so mura for a wedding makeup. Kasi nakikita ko 10k average ang rates pag weddings eh. But I checked her IG and her portfolio is so diverse. Like meron syang clients na may TVC (nandun nga si ninong ry and wife). And, and here's the important part for me, most of her clients didn't have to wear colored contacts. Just a personal preference kahit na sabihin na pwede ko namang tanggihan.

Her rate for one head (3k) includes a hair stylist. Pwede daw sya ang gumawa ng hair and makeup but for weddings, she advised to get her partner stylist daw. So I did. I got two heads (for me and my mom) and grooming for my husband (1k). Transpo is her grab fare to and from the venue to her house.

And let me tell you, I LOVED my hair and makeup, especially the makeup. She asked me for my peg and followed it. Sabi ko I wanted a red lipstick but I didn't want to look masungit, and sabi nya magmumukha talaga akong masungit with red lips so hindi na lang. But oh my gawd, the finish product was amazing! I looked like myself but beautiful. Everyone was complimenting my looks talaga. Even sa personal or DSLR or iphone or android cameras, ang ganda ng gawa nya.

She and her stylist partner Roman (I think that's his name) were both so patient din with my mom. My mom was complaining and didn't want to have her face done but hindi naman sila nainis. Eto talaga ang pinakasulit kong gastos sa kasal.

Souvenir booths: **Live painting and fragrance bar by Sachiko Reyes**

Ok naman. They delivered naman and mabilis silang kausap. May mga siguro misunderstanding on my part lang. First is the size of the perfumes. Kasi ang alam ko 25pcs 10ml elegant glass and 75pcs 10ml tube glass. Pero lahat tube glass. Di naman talaga issue.

Another thing is that the paintings took so long. Yung ibang guests umuwi na without getting their painting. Eh wala pa kaming 40 pax (pang 100 pax ang booth) so may kabagalan talaga.

But other than that, sulit na din sila because ang package namin for 100 pax is 15k for both booths and a telephone voicemail something.

Flowers: **Ron Rodriquez**

I just searched the FB marketplace for bouquets and saw his posts. I wanted red and violet tulips as bouquet and one violet tulip for my groom's boutonniere.  Sana lang may pin na kasama yung kay groom kasi wala kaming dala so di sya na-pin sa suit nya. Tapos I asked for 24 pcs red and 24 pcs violet (spray-painted lang) local roses. Mabilis kausap. Galing dangwa so ang usapan ako magpapalalamove. Medyo dumating lang yung flowers parang uhaw na uhaw na sila. Tanghaling tapat kasi pinadeliver pero feeling ko lang yung roses hindi nakalagay sa water kaya di na sila lively. Eh sa hotel ko pinadeliver so wala din akong lalagyan na malaking vase. Kaya ayun, medyo lanta na ng dumating sa venue.

Coffee bar: **Kali Kofi**

I got the 75-cup package. Total is **6k - edited from 5k typo** (kasama na ang p500 transpo). Wala akong complaints. Mabilis din silang kausap. And my guests loved the coffee. I'd get them again kung may iba pa kong events next time.

Content creator: **AgapeCreate**

My husband was asking why we needed a content creator eh pareho nga kaming ayaw humarap sa camera hahaha. Pero kasi I figured that the photographer included in the venue's package wouldn't be as attentive to us at baka yung venue ang focus nila. Saka photographer lang yun, walang videos. Kahit paano gusto ko ng videos para may matabi lang kami for personal use. I got the p3.5k package (yung hindi kasama yung prep venue) plus p800 transpo. Ms. Cashmire was sent to do our event. She was there early and did her thing unintrusively (just as we asked). We had a video call I think two weeks before the event para alam nila ano gusto namin. Baka daw meron kaming trend na gusto i-post or something. Ang instruction namin is to focus on candid moments kasi gusto lang talaga namin na we have a video of the event. They gave us three edited one-minute videos for posting on social media, raw short videos and a few BTS pictures. Sulit din to. We got great shots from them.

Minister: **Michael Sagarbarria II**

He was the fastest to reply from all the others I inquired from. Sya nag-advise na we didn't need a marriage license kasi matagal na kaming live-in. And he took care of all paperwork. I asked to see the papers para maiwasan ang typos ng names namin. He gave it naman. Since wala pang two weeks, wala pa kaming hawak na papers. Pero he explained naman kung kelan expected na dumating and kung gano katagal sa PSA. But seamless talaga ang process so far with him.

Specifically, I used her personality as the basis for the monsteras in this story.  Psychotic and all consuming. 

This story was originally a 400-ish word throwaway origin story for monsteras. I commented it twice for funsies and giggles in HPCJ threads about monsteras, but last week it got mentioned by another Redditor in the stairwell monstera thread which turned into a request for a full r/nosleep version. [That convo can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/houseplantscirclejerk/comments/1l4sxc9/comment/mwkjqbj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) 

On with the show: 


Before the 1920s, Monstera deliciosa was an endemic plant mostly confined to a small, mist-shrouded valley deep in Chiapas, Mexico. Locals called it hoja hambrienta—the hungry leaf. Oral traditions warned against sleeping too close to it. Children were warned about its whispering voices in the night Like Chupaca and El Cuco, it was just a piece of folklore, often used by parents to scare their children into behaving properly.

This changed in 1921. Documents from that time show that 2000 acres of the area known as ""Valle de la Sombra de Chiapas"" was purchased by a company named ""Compañía Maderera del Sur S.A."". Records show the company was founded by ""El Coronel Reyes y Asociados, 1908"" which would imply that the company was not exactly a private affair. Multiple other companies the good Colonel was involved in were either loosely or even quite deeply tied to the Mexican Federal Government, and/or the Armed Forces of Mexico. One of those companies, Ferrocarriles del Espíritu Santo S.A., was quite famously caught transporting Mexican political prisoners for use as agricultural labor.

By the end of 1921, the Southern Timber Company had established a full operational base at the edge of the jungle, complete with administrative offices, a sawmill, workers’ quarters, and a narrow-gauge railway linking directly to the Ferrocarril main line. Over the next three years, approximately 500 acres were cleared. Yet the work proceeded sporadically. The reasons remained unclear, as employees were notably tight-lipped, but logging crews were frequently replaced, and railway manifests recorded large shipments of ammunition and industrial herbicides every six months. Even more curious was the volume of replacement equipment sent to the site. For an operation of its size, the camp consumed an unusually high amount of machinery. Most striking was the repeated failure of two critical components: the sawmill’s boiler and the central line shaft driving its equipment, both of which had to be replaced twice. Under normal conditions and even with minimal maintenance, either one should have easily outlasted the company itself.

Shortly after logging commenced, people began to disappear. At first, the missing were chalked up to misfortune, bad luck, poor judgment, or simply men who had walked away from the work. In 1922, three loggers vanished without a trace. Compañía Maderera claimed they had proven unfit for the labor and had returned home.

Throughout 1923, six more individuals disappeared. There was no clear pattern, no evidence of foul play — but whispers circulated. Though no one dared say it aloud, all the disappearances occurred north of the village, near the edge of the cleared forest.

Then came 1924.

In the first six months of that year, at least eleven people vanished. No bodies. No witnesses. Just silence. By then, locals had long been speaking in hushed voices of ""el bosque que sangra"" — the bleeding forest.

It was around this time that Compañía Maderera abruptly ceased all operations in the valley. The decision appeared sudden, even panicked. A telegram dated June 12th discussed projected timber yields for the coming months. But one day later, a second message arrived — terse and unnerving — citing “increased issues” and requested the immediate cessation of on-site operations.

Unexplained disappearances remained steady, between 16 and 20 per year, through 1928. But in August of that year, something changed.

Luis Aranda, a young coffee farmer who had gone missing three weeks prior, was seen staggering out of the jungle and collapsing in a field on the outskirts of town. When villagers reached him, they found him barely alive — bloodied, broken, and barely conscious. His body was covered nearly head to toe in dried blood. His left arm had been torn open, as if mauled by a large predator. He limped on a crude branch crutch, his jaw was visibly broken, and one eye socket had caved in. Feverish and delirious, he whispered fragments of his ordeal, claiming he had been attacked by what he called “El Monstruo Verde.” The Green Monster.

Aranda was rushed to the village clinic. Though his physical wounds began to heal under care, his mind unraveled. He raved in his sleep, thrashed violently, and would wake up screaming as though being mauled all over again. One night, he sat bolt upright in bed and shrieked:

“¡El monstruo me olió… me saboreó!” - The monster smelled me. It tasted me.”

On the fifth night, Aranda broke. He tore out his IV, shattered the windows, smashed everything that wasn't bolted down, attacked the guard at his door, and then escaped into the street. Several townspeople reported seeing him wandering barefoot through the plaza, dazed and muttering, but none were willing to attempt to stop him. His eyes were glazed, his gait stiff—as if intoxicated or suffering from some form of delirium.

Witnesses say he repeated just one phrase, again and again: “Yo soy delicioso.” - “I am delicious.”

He was headed directly towards the cut. The last time anyone saw him alive was as he disappeared into the forest on the same path he had been found on days prior.

Following Luis Aranda’s disappearance, the Cut was declared off-limits. Though the clearing itself spanned roughly 500 acres, nearly 3,000 acres of surrounding forest were officially designated as “unfit for human habitation.” Still, the warnings didn’t deter everyone. Over the next year, several daring individuals ventured into the forbidden zone — but only one ever made it close enough to the Cut to observe it truly.

That person was Mateo Santibáñez, a 17-year-old with a sharp mind and a quiet demeanor. Known for his keen observation skills, his unbridled curiosity, and his constant sketching, Mateo often recorded what he saw in a small, worn notepad. Over time, he had noticed a pattern: fewer disappearances occurred during extended dry spells. It was a dangerous theory, but one he believed in.

In July of 1929, after three full weeks without significant rainfall, Mateo decided the moment had come. At dawn on the 21st, he set out alone toward the Cut, carrying a small backpack. Inside were only the essentials: water, a few snacks, his notepad, a pencil, a knife, and a small hatchet.

That morning, Mateo told his mother, Doña Lidia, he was heading into the hills to sketch the river basin near the old quarry, a familiar place he’d visited many times before. But by the time she began preparing lunch, unease had crept in. The sun was already too high for a simple sketching trip. Something felt wrong.

She started asking around.

When she stopped by the Calderón household and Ana hesitated just a moment too long before answering, that was enough. Doña Lidia knew exactly where her son had gone.

Just as she turned to leave, someone began shouting Ana’s name from down the road.

It was Isabela, a classmate of both Ana and Mateo, sprinting toward the house. She reached the porch, breathless, and froze for a moment when she saw Ana’s wide, frightened eyes and the cold, simmering anger on Doña Lidia’s face.

Instinctively, Isabela took a step back.

“Mateo… he’s back,” she said between gulps of air. “He just came out of the forest. He looks awful. Says he saw something. Something wild.”

Before either of them could respond, Isabela turned and ran back the way she came, heading straight for Mateo with Ana and Doña Lidia following close behind When they reached him, a small crowd had already gathered, voices overlapping with questions 

Doña Lidia didn’t wait. She pforced her way through the circle, grabbed Mateo by the shirt, and stared straight into his eyes.

“Mamá, I’m sorry,” he said quickly. “I just wanted to know.”

“You lied, Mateo! You lied and went into that cursed forest!”

“Aren’t you curious?” he shot back. “Don’t you want to know what’s really there?”

“We already know, Mateo! It’s evil, its immortal, and it feeds on the curious!”

Mateo opened his mouth to speak again, but his mother immediately cut him off.

“Do you want to die like the others? Torn limb from limb by El Monstruo Verde and strewn across the jungle floor? Do not go looking for what wants to be found, Mateo! The jungle does not forgive those who wake it”

Doña Lidia took Mateo straight home after the confrontation in the plaza. She didn’t say another word on the walk back, but her grip on his arm was iron, and her silence was more terrifying than any yelling could’ve been. That night Mateo was confined to the house. Not for a day, or even a week, but for a full month. No visiting friends, no sketching trips, no stepping past the gate. She made him attend mass every Sunday, front row, right beside her. She made him chop firewood until his blisters bled. She kept him too busy and too watched to sneak away again.

One week after his return, the men of the village had taken a vote. It was time to put an end to the monster in the cut. It had taken to many lives, ruined to many families, and caused to much pain. 12 men volunteered...

But this is not the problem.The actual problem is that  past few weeks he started to come to our home very frequently even if dad's not there especially once mom comes home after work.My mom didn't care about his visits as he's a close one to dad.Initially he would just wait in the sofa till dad comes or might leave if dad's not coming anytime soon.Usually mom would give him tea and snacks,converse with him during those times.But over the days I saw him starting to exhibit questionable behaviours toward my mom and my mom let them all slid by given his condition.It is so embarassing for me as a son to see my mom letting him do that to her.
Yesterday evening is when I got fed up with all his antics;He came home when dad and mom were not home(as dad and mom went for a marriage).As I was the only one at home,I made him coffee and told about them not being home.He suddenly started to act silly and loud saying that he misses my dad and my mom;*then the drunken bastard started to comment how my mom is his angel,how she's the only woman he's been ever with,how she's the only woman in his entire life,how she's the one whom he's ever spent his precious time with and other things that can't be shared in public*. Following that he fell on the ground asking to meet dad saying he can't live without meeting his friend and stuff.I was so confused and angry that I really wanted to hit him.But before such things happened he himself came to senses,for some reason forced his golden ring in my hand saying that it's his gift for me (dad returned it back today) and literally moved swiftly out of home.
This should really stop before anything worse happens.

I'm 31 and have had it for over a decade now. My dad has it too. Anyway, I just wanted to share some thoughts on my own experience with RLS and see if anyone else has experienced anything similar.

I strongly believe my RLS is linked heavily to dopamine (not a revelation... I know there are studies that back this up). But I've found something that seems to help.

I've had a bad phone addiction since I was 16/17 and got my first phone. I would check my phone first thing in the morning and last thing at night for hours. And constantly throughout the day. Mindless social media scrolling was rotting my brain and my natural levels of dopamine. A few months ago, my screen time was 8 hours a day, so I decided to give it up for a while.

**A few rules I followed:**

\- No phone first thing in the morning. I wake up, have my coffee, and just sit for a bit. It's not as painful as it sounds.

\- Go for a morning walk, around 30 minutes.

\- No phone from 6pm onwards. I need it for work so couldn't remove it completely.

\- Massively cut back on social media. I spend less than 1 hour a week on Instagram/TikTok now, instead of 4-5 hours a day. I did cut it out completely for the first week though.

\- I also quit games on my phone.

Maybe it's a coincidence, but I have barely had RLS since. I just wanted to share as it may help someone else!

Also, sidenote, I've been reading more as a result and really enjoying it. Can't recommend it enough if you think you have a phone problem and are suffering from RLS.

Worst case scenario? It doesn't help your RLS but you use your phone less.",3,1749799074.0,RestlessLegs,0,1.0,False

Robert slumped into his seat, his clean shaven chin resting on a closed fist. He gently shook back and forth as the bus trundled down the road. Raindrops quietly pattered against the windows. People sat with scowls on their faces, eager to get home. The clouds were gray and hazy,  hanging low in the sky. 

He thought about what he'd do later, about work, about the next day. He got off the bus. He sat down. He poured himself a drink. The TV flickered. Looks like some pixels were stuck. Maybe he should get a new one. He turned in his bed, pulling his blanket up. He laid his head on his pillow...

Robert sat in his seat, his bearded chin resting on a closed fist. He steadied himself as the bus shook back and forth, trundling down the road. Raindrops quietly pattered against the windows. People sat with scowls on their faces, eager to get home. The clouds were gray and hazy, hanging low in the sky. 

A woman got on. Her hair was tied up in a bun. She wore a red trench coat. She was pretty. Robert wondered if he'd ever seen her before. He thought about what he'd do later, about work, about asking her out for a cup of coffee.  “No.” He thought. He didn't have the time. 

He got off the bus. He sat down. He went to pour himself a drink. “Dammit.” He was out of whiskey. He went to the liquor store. An hour later he poured himself a drink. The TV turned on. He'd finally got around to getting a new one. He turned in his bed, pulling the blanket up. He laid his head on his pillow…

Robert sat in his seat, looking around. He stayed upright as the bus shook back and forth, trundling down the road. Raindrops quietly pattered against the windows. People sat with scowls on their faces, eager to get home. The clouds were gray and hazy, hanging low in the sky.

The woman got on. Her hair was tied up in a bun. She wore her red trench coat; the same one every day. She was pretty. Robert wondered where she was going, what she was doing, if she had plans, if she'd go out for a cup of coffee. “No.” He thought. He didn't have the time. He thought about what he'd do later. He thought about work. 

He got off the bus. He sat down at his desk and poured himself a glass of wine. He could feel his eyes straining as he stared at the computer screen. He needed a break. Work could wait. He poured himself another glass of wine and pulled out an old Ella Fitzgerald record, placing it on the turntable. Dream a Little Dream of Me played. 

He kicked his feet up as he listened. He thought about dancing. He thought about dancing with that woman in the red trench coat, wrapping his arms around her as they slow-danced. He'd smile, and she'd smile, and he'd laugh, and she'd laugh, and he'd think about what a lucky guy he was. Lucky to meet her. And they'd have a few too many glasses of wine. He'd lean in for a kiss, and they'd tumble into bed with each other. They'd tell each other how much they loved each other, and talk and talk and talk all night long, until they dozed off. And the next morning, he'd wake up, his arms around her as she laid on his chest, fast asleep. What a lucky guy.

Robert suddenly looked around, realizing it was late. The smile left his face. He glanced at the clock. It was almost 11:00pm. He better finish his work. Tomorrow was a big presentation. He might get a promotion. He turned in his bed, pulling the blanket up. He laid his head on his pillow…

Robert sat straight in his seat, dressed in his new suit. He relaxed, gliding with the motion of the bus as it trundled down the road. Raindrops quietly pattered against the windows. People sat with scowls on their faces, eager to get home. The clouds were gray and hazy, hanging low in the sky. 

The bus passed her stop. Robert looked out the window, confused. He could see the bus stop. There was no one there.  He turned away from the window, staring blankly ahead. There was an empty feeling in him now. Just nothing. “Who cares?” He thought. “Why get all worked up?” He hadn't said a word to her. “What did it matter?” And besides, he never had the time. He glanced down at his new suit, adjusting his tie. He got off the bus. He sat down. He poured himself a drink. And another. And another. He stared at his new TV. He poured himself another drink. And another. And-

“God Dammit!” He dropped the glass, spilling whiskey on his new suit. It shattered as it hit the floor, shards going everywhere. He got on his hands and knees, cleaning up the mess with a dustpan. He looked over at the bottle, deciding to pour himself one more glass. Just one more. 

He went back to his chair, sitting there quietly. He held the drink in front of his face, using the light of the TV to illuminate it. He watched the dark liquor swirl and twist as the ice melted into it. He stared at it for what felt like an eternity. Just waiting. Watching. God, what an idiot he was. It didn't matter. He never knew her. Never even said a word to her. Why was he hung up on it? Maybe she'd be back. Maybe he could track her down. “No.” He thought. He didn't have the time. In a quick motion he drank the remaining liquor. 

He stared at his empty bed for a long time. The sheets were folded neatly. Nothing out of place. Just as he'd left it. Just like every other day. He laid down and turned off the light. He turned in his bed, pulling the blanket up. He laid his head on his pillow, his tears sparkling in the moonlight.",1,1749799063.0,writers,1,1.0,False
1la9p88,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1la9p88/guilt_and_regret_following_surgical_intervention/,Guilt and regret following surgical intervention for chance of conception,"I’m struggling with guilt and regret following surgical intervention on my uterus to remove a large fibroid.

Forgive me for the long, seemingly dramatic post. My heart is so heavy and I’m desperate for connection and understanding. 

I struggled with painful, heavy periods most of my life. The last 5 years in particular have been traumatic. I bled for 1.5 years straight. And then carried on bleeding for months at a time with few breaks. I hollered and cried out in pain. I spent most of my days soaked in blood, weeping. Doctors didn’t help. People didn’t understand. Even other women couldn’t relate. I stopped being able to work and live my regular life due to overwhelming symptoms. My entire life revolved around managing these symptoms and working to heal myself. 

I grew up Catholic and went to Catholic schools, so even if I’m not attending church regularity as an adult, I have some deep programming that I see as my truth. A major part- that women and men can procreate and children are a blessing. That a family is the foundation of everything and your body is a temple. 

But I can’t escape my thoughts on humanity in the state of nature- the state that God created us in. Perfect, without flaw and disease and disorder. My inability to conceive feels like a message, but it hurts my feelings. Every day.
Did God not approve of my marriage? Of my life choices? Of my meals? My friendships? My lack of community? Did he not trust me with the task of guiding a child through this life? 
All kinds of people have children so what is it about me? Am I being punished for those years the doctors had me on birth control? It must be a sin. I didn’t know at the time.
People who eat McDonald’s 3 times a week have babies. teenagers have babies. Addicts have babies. People who don’t even want children, have babies. Abusers have babies. What have I done wrong? what can I do?

I spent most of my life working in childcare. I helped hundreds of families raise their children. I cared for others children as if they were my own. It’s like I was in training for a position I would never get. 

I tried all kinds of natural methods. I worked with the TCM doctor, I worked with a birth and life doula, I worked with healers. I went to the doctor and I let them run the tests. Poke and prod me. Examine my most intimate parts. 
I changed my diet. I cut out sugar, coffee, meat. I added meat again, I only ate spelt bread. I fasted. I detoxed from medicine and prescriptions. I took the supplements. I adjusted the supplements. I threw my hands up and let myself enjoy things. I relaxed and let myself live. I cut toxic relationships, I made quality friendships, I worked on my marriages flaws and hardships, I practised boundaries. I went back to church. I prayed, I prayed, I prayed. 

I already receive a lot of feedback when I touch on my feelings out loud— “you needed this” “don’t feel bad, the doctors and surgeons are there to help”, “you didn’t do anything wrong”, “you’re not a failure”, “God sent these people to help you”… 

I guess I’m looking for understanding. Perspective on infertility and the reasons for not being able to conceive. It’s been 10 years of trying. I’m tired.
They opened me up and scraped against my womb. Strangers laid hands on me that I will never know, because I was unconscious. 
God gave us the power and ability to heal ourselves through him, and I couldn’t. So what does it mean? What is God’s reason for banning me from my truest desire?

I’m looking for any perspective, no matter how brutal or hard to hear… on WHY.

It’s been a week since surgery. I struggle to look at the incision. I struggle with the aftermath of daily injections and this tightness around my womb. This hideous scar as a reminder of my failures. This reminder that my husband and I have not received this blessing the natural way.
I struggle knowing that IF I get pregnant, my baby will have to be delivered by c-section, pulled from my insides and handled by hands that don’t know or love us. I’ve been referred to IVF clinics and I know this isn’t the path for me. I struggle with regret wondering if God doesn’t approve of my decision to go through surgery as well. 
I’m struggling.

I got a free coffee from a queer person today because I'm visibly AFAB queer. Felt good to be recognized. Made me wanna stay as is.

I want to be recognized as other queers and queer women. That's worth gold. 

I hate how I shrink myself while talking to men. Makes me wanna transition to male. 

I've noticed some people like me less because they think I'm a white dude. Makes me wanna be like ""guys I am AFAB!"" So they like me. 

I like the male comradely. Got called ""boss"" today. But don't want to ""keep up"" on trying to act socially male cuz it's not me.

 I love this old man customer and we totally vibe. Felt the need for him to know I'm AFAB.. but now he knows and I felt smaller and wished he didn't.

Lots of confusing / conflicting feelings. I haven't been attached to the female label for years AT ALL and now that I'm close to passing as male I'm finding myself attached.

1la9lm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1la9lm0/reason_i_dont_like_dogs/,Reason I don’t like dogs,"
Reasons why I don’t like dogs more specifically living with them.  

1. Dogs are not like cats you don’t just come home say hi to your dogs and relax, no as soon as you get home you have to play, and take him for a walk, and play with him again. Not to mention clean up his crap at least 3 times during all of this. That’s if he decides to actually go on the walk otherwise there’s no tiring him out and you have to spend the next 3 hours playing with him, just to have to take him on a walk anyway because he needs to learn to go outside instead of pissing anywhere he likes inside and not even stepping to let you know he has to go.  
2. When you have a dog you can’t go out for more than a few hours, so say good bye to spending all day outside again, unless you want to take him, in which case your basically baby sitting, you can’t go into most stores if you do you can’t grocery shop for the week, because you have a dog with u that will start barking because he can’t do anything.
3. You can’t have nice things, I mean you can but your always running the risk of it being completely destroyed if you leave it somewhere as simple as the coffee table, or a shelf that’s too low, or literally anything he can’t gets his mouth around. Like idk the table itself it’s gone, oh well buy a new one or just stop caring all together 
4. They bite hard, as soon as a dog bite me even a little hard I feel like getting rid of him or just not playing with him in general, and with cats that’s fine they’ll get annoyed but it’s whatever, a dog will just keep going even after you tell him no 1000 times he’ll just keep doing it
5. There to big, I don’t mind most big dogs, but I can’t stand high energy dogs, I like one I can chill with and doesn’t like rough play which isn’t common unless there old
6. I can’t get any food without him a dog wanting it and sitting by me the whole time staring into my sole to get it, I’d rather lock them in another room so I can eat in peace 
7. I feel like dog owner spend 85% of the time making sure the dog is tired enough so they can get a moment of peace, I don’t wanna live that life 
8. Dog sitting, we could easily spending the nite somewhere with cats. With a dog I have to setup a whole schedule for someone to whatch my dog for a nite l, I also have to pay them. So anytime I wanna stay the nite somewhere I have to pay to do it 
9. Vacation, I can pay somewhere to check in on my cats to give them food and water,  but with a dog I have to pay out my ass so they don’t reck the place when I’m gone 
10. There fur is rough, or too short
11. I can cuddle with my cat for hours, but I can’t could a dog more than 10 mins without wanting to lick them off because my leg is numb 
12. They smell so much, my cay will smell ever so often, but I Lean in close to a dog it’s an immediate pouch to the face
13. They can’t just chill, and if they do it just looks like there depressed
14. Most people who have a dogs only talk about there dog, and have no real hobbies outside of taking care of there dog
15. My cats are not comfortable in their own home, my cat should not have to spend all day in the cat tower, well he can just jump down right no, why?, because there’s a dog who’s too stupid to realize that my cats doesn’t want to resile with him. So he spends all day in one spot until the dog goes to sleep at 11:30 pm
16. There gross, cats have a certain cuteness even in the gross way they eat wet food or anything like that, a dog does that it just makes me want to hurl 
17. Training, there is almost little to no tracing when it come to a cat, with a dog it gets so hard people pay other people hundreds of dollars to teach them not to be a shit head 
18. There loud, one bark from a dog is like ten meows in a row for me, it instantly make me angry, idc what dog it is. There wines are also so high pitched I wish I could instantly go deaf when he does it 
19. The amount of money a dog needs to be happy is ridiculous, a cat you barely need a few toys and a littler box and you’re good.
20. There everywhere, I can go anywhere without seeing a dog, or going to someone’s house just to get trampled by the dog.
21. There saliva, it gets everywhere, and as someone who where a lot of black it’s very vissable when it gets on you and I hate the wet feeling altering cleaning it up. Gross.

1la9htt,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1la9htt/200_coffee_possibly_legal_italy/,200€ Coffee. Possibly legal? (ITALY),"LOCATION:
Italy

So I was having a discussion with my friends, one of them is a law student but he is just at his second year of four(this is how it works in Italy I have no idea how it's like in the U.S).
I was imagining a hypothetical bar or cafe that would charge an exorbitant price for a usually cheap item like an espresso coffee (usually 0.60€ or 1.00€ where we live) 
For example this imaginary bar would charge 200€ or even 500€ for it, the bar would leave a menu at every table that customers could freely check,the menu could even be laid out open on the tables and on the counter of the cafe, and on the menu the 200€ price tag would be exposed next to the ""espresso"" item, clearly, but not in a particularly large font, just like a normal price tag for a normal item.

My question is, considering the fact that people here just walk into a bar and order a coffee without even looking at the menu because they expect to pay 1€ at most, who would be in the wrong when the bar owner asks for 200€ and then points to the menu which clearly indicates the price?
The customer who didn't look?
The bar owner who is obviosuly trying to trick people?
My friend told me this is a classic case of dishonest practice and that the costumer would never be actually required to pay that coffee that much. I agree with him but some of my other friends didn't. 
What do you think?

Saw DMs between her and a friend (20somethingM) on Instagram. It was mostly reels and memes but three messages in particular were sexual.

One she sent saying “pull down your boxers. We need to talk.” One he sent of a cup of coffee top down view and there’s a girl on her knees covered by the cup. Caption is something like “nothing better than coffee in the morning.” Blowjob implied. She hearted it. He sent a reel implying bondage (someone tied up in wooden stocks) and he captioned it “you ain’t ready.” She also sent a reel of a local event happening next week when I’m supposed to be out of town. He lives a couple hours away so really why would she send him a video about a local event?

My big hang up is that tomorrow is a viewing for a childhood friend of hers that passed away. Saturday is the funeral. When do i confront her about this because i feel so angry but I would also feel like an asshole bringing this up before a funeral.

So, I’ve this idea that’s been buzzing in my head for a while, and I need your honest thoughts on it. I’m thinking of selling Travel Photobooks in India, priced between ₹800 to ₹1500. Like, high-quality, glossy, coffee-table kinda books filled with stunning pics of India’s landscapes, cultures, hidden gems, maybe even some quirky street shots or the personalised ones. (reference Instagram handles -pixory, duckduckstory)

The vibe is to make these books something you’d love to flip through, gift to someone, or just keep on your shelf to show off. I’m planning to source photos either from talented Indian photographers (giving them credit, of course!) or I will Illustrate as I have got experience with adobe tools and all. - also maybe include some short stories or captions about the places. The books would be budget-friendly but still feel premium, you know?

Here’s what I’m wondering:

* Do you guys think there’s a market for this in India? Travel buddies, would you buy a Travel Photobook for ₹800-₹1500?
* What kinda themes or places would you wanna see in a travel photobook? or would you prefer one of your own personalised kinda ones ?
* Would you gift these to friends/family, or is it more of a “buy for yourself” thing?
* Any tips on where/how to sell these? Online, bookstores, or maybe even cafes?
* Also, is this even a cool idea, or am I just dreaming too big? 😅

Over the past few months we’ve been tinkering late nights to put together something we really care about: **Flossx83**, what we believe is the world’s first fully open‑source ISO 8583 financial auditing and simulation suite. We started this as a way to really understand how payment messages flow - from POS to switch to issuer - and quickly realized there wasn’t a free, community‑driven tool that brought it all together.

**What it does:**

* **Simulate** card payment messages (ATM, POS, etc.)
* Run them through a **Java card switch** you can self‑host
* Score transactions with a built‑in **fraud detection engine**
* **Audit every step immutably** so you can trace exactly what happened

We’ve poured our own curiosity and countless cups of coffee into this repo, and it’s now ready for anyone to clone, run locally, and start experimenting - no vendor lock‑in, no pricey hardware required.

🔗 **Give it a spin:**

* GitHub: [https://github.com/gracemann365/Flossx83](https://github.com/gracemann365/Flossx83) (Star - if you liked it)
* Live demo: [https://gracemann365.github.io/Flossx83/](https://gracemann365.github.io/Flossx83/)

We’d be so grateful for any feedback on the code, documentation, or ideas for new features. If you’ve got thoughts on performance tweaks, additional audit hooks, or just want to share war stories from your own payment‑tech adventures, please chime in.

Building this in the open has been both nerve‑wracking and incredibly rewarding - We're looking forward to growing it with your help. Thanks for checking it out, and hope you find it useful!

1la9cbc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1la9cbc,I asked ChatGPT to replace surface car-parks in Wellington with green spaces,"It also wrote this report (with some minor edits by me):

# AI Can Turn Our Car Parks into Green Space — Why Can’t We?

*A dispatch from the Bureau of Reckless Optimism, Te Whanganui-a-Tara edition*

# Step 1: prompt the machine

In under 30 seconds an image generator cheerfully re-greened every gravel crater from Ghuznee to Vivian Streets. It sprinkled tūī-friendly kōwhai, moved a carved pou into shot for cultural legitimacy, and still left room for eight different picnic rugs. The lesson? Even a silicon chip can recognise that a Wilson Parking lot looks better disguised as a meadow.

# Step 2: ask the humans

Cue the Wellington City Council’s long-term plan: “Great idea – pop back in 2043 once we’ve *found the money*.” The same plan that still budgets **$31.7 million a year in parking fees and fines** – triple what we spend on new public parks ([wellington.govt.nz](https://wellington.govt.nz/-/media/your-council/about-the-council/information-requests/2024/irc-7067-parking-revenue-and-water.pdf?hash=B82B1C0656696E3B7844E0EDDC9FBFA265E5A888&la=en)). Asphalt, it turns out, is the city’s favourite passive-income stream.

# 1. Going, going, gone — our disappearing green quota

Central Wellington has **just 41 hectares of public green space** today, and on current growth projections that per-capita slice will **halve again** within a generation ([sustainablecities.org.nz](https://www.sustainablecities.org.nz/sites/default/files/2021-12/Report-Green-Space-in-Wellington%E2%80%99s-Central-City.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). For comparison, the *Town Belt* was set aside at 625 ha in 1840; two-thirds of that has already been carved up for roads, car parks and (checks notes) an actual zoo ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington_Town_Belt?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

# 2. Yet we still worship the asphalt calf

Even one tiny back-street pad is absurdly valuable to the Cult of the Car:

||
||
|**Site**|**Spaces**|**Land use today**|**Potential tomorrow**|
|**Swan Lane**|\~60|$5/hour Wilson lot|Micro-park linking Cuba St to the eco-lanes ([d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/generationzero/pages/9198/attachments/original/1608597600/Garrett_Street__Swan_Lane_traffic_resolutions_Generation_Zero_.pdf?1608597600=&utm_source=chatgpt.com))|
|**Bute St**|80-ish|$3 all-day special|Residential green “back-yard” for Te Aro apartments ([wilsonparking.co.nz](https://www.wilsonparking.co.nz/parking-locations/wellington/te-aro/the-bute-street-carpark/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))|
|**Ghuznee St**|40|Gravel pit + tag art|Urban māra kai + storm-water sponge|

Even if we obliterated all three tomorrow the council would forgo roughly **$900 a day** in casual fees. A single ruptured water-main costs more. (Ask the Tory Street plumbers.)

# 3. “But where will people park?”

Enter the great neo-lib narrative: streets are *retail pipelines*, cars are customers, and asphalt is the only thing stopping Courtenay Place from collapsing into the harbour. Never mind that the **Golden Mile upgrade** – yes, the one that bans cars and *adds* 75 trees – has already survived 20 amendments, a Crown observer and threats of economic Armageddon ([rnz.co.nz](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/534917/wellington-council-keeps-the-golden-mile-in-long-term-plan)).

National Minister-at-large Chris Bishop once lamented that the council is “*obsessed with removing cars*” from the CBD ([facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/ChrisBishopMP/posts/thoughts/3094151290631735/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) (translation: devoting 0.6 % of road space to cycle lanes). Councillor Diane Calvert, meanwhile, champions “*non-rates revenue*” – code for keep the meters ticking ([wellington.scoop.co.nz](https://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=170897)).

# 4. The inconvenient math(s) of grass

*Health*: Regular exposure to urban green boosts mood, slashes blood pressure and even firms up your immune system ([iris.who.int](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/345751/WHO-EURO-2016-3352-43111-60341-eng.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1&utm_source=chatgpt.com),[ theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/16/green-space-could-be-even-better-for-young-brains-than-we-realised?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). *Climate*: Every extra hectare of tree canopy cools the city and trims climate-change health costs the WHO pegs at **6 % of global GDP** ([cdn.who.int](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/ncds/4th-high-level-meeting-of-ncds/concept-note---thematic-dialogue-on-environmental-risk-factors-for-ncds-and-mental-health---30-april-2025.pdf?sfvrsn=42b41088_1&utm_source=chatgpt.com)). *Economics*: Good-looking outdoor space lifts nearby property values and retail spend – priceless if you sell coffee or two-bed walk-ups ([urbaneffects.co.nz](https://www.urbaneffects.co.nz/hot-property-the-health-economic-and-social-value-of-well-designed-outdoor-spaces/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

# 5. A modest AI-generated proposal

1. **Delete** one surface car park a year – start with whichever lot appears first when you type “eyesore” into Google Street View.  
2. **Swap** tar for a native-tree and flower explosion, plunk in some stylish benches, and christen it Park-Mate—because even parking sites deserve a glow-up.
3. **Repeat** until Wellington stops bench-marking itself against a 1980s K-Mart car park.  

# 6. Elections are coming – choose your fighter

* **Asphalt Avengers**: promise paradise once the debt is paid and every household owns an EV charger.  
* **Garden Variety Radicals**: point out that **two-fifths of Wellington commuters already prefer walking or biking** if the street feels safe ([wellington.govt.nz](https://wellington.govt.nz/-/media/parking-roads-and-transport/transport-insights/20240708-wcc-pwts-2023-traveltowork-fullreport.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) – so maybe give them somewhere pleasant to walk *to*.  
* **AI-Generated Utopians** (that’s us): have the pictures, the numbers and the gall.  

# Final thought

If an algorithm can turn a **“gravel shitheap”** (your friend’s words, not ours) into a sun-drenched māra in less time than it takes a pay-and-display machine to spit out a receipt, the real question isn’t why we can't, or shouldn't — it’s why we’re still carving our streets into lanes for giant steel rectangles instead of spaces for people.   
  
Consider... if those green sanctuaries already existed, it wouldn’t be their defenders who looked mad. Rather, it’d be the Asphalt Avenger lobbying the city council: “Obliterate this annoying tree-hugger oasis, slab it in concrete, and mint parking tickets to chip away at my rates bill. Besides, where the hell *else* am I supposed to park this thing?""

Sparkling water saved my ass.,"Hit the three month mark earlier this week. It’s been a pretty emotional three months, but I feel better than I have since I was a teen. Started drinking at 15 and I’m 25 now. I feel like I’ve regained a lot of life that I missed out on. I still got a long way to go (forever) but I’m at the point where my sobriety excites me. 

Unfortunately everyone I know drinks, although in a controlled manner. Glasses of wine at dinners, beers while grilling. I avoided hanging out with people a lot the first month but one day on my way home I wanted something that wasn’t water or coffee. I’m not much for sugar so I grabbed a case of sparkling waters and oh boy. 

These things have been my savior. I carry them with me to social gatherings, and if my friends are drinking I pull one of these bad boys out and it removes that feeling of missing out from my head. My drink of choice was hard seltzers so it’s a pretty good replacement. When I go out with friends I come back home hydrated, crawl in to bed, and wake up feeling great. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk. Just wanted to share my excitement of flavored water with some people that might understand and not think I’m weird 😂.

At our office there's two entrances from the lobby, but we only ever use one of them, since the other door opens directly in to a seating area where a department of mostly middle aged women works. Another plus of primarily only using one door, is that everyone gets to greet each other good morning etc.

Now, these otherwise kind ladies, have complained every single time someone has used the door by them to upper management, and through teams. They don't seem to differentiate between who does it. Whoever uses that door won't be spared from their wrath. Their reasoning among other things have been that it creates a draft, and that it's just annoying.

They started taping paper to the door saying ""Don't use this door"" and even tried to block it with tables or big plants, but have always been told off because it's also an escape route in case of fire and other emergencies. I've heard them bad mouthing some of the new people as well, because they tried using the door until they read their taped paper on the door.

Then one day, I had to help a contractor move something really heavy out from the office, and I told them I'd have to use that door. They started complaining and said we could use the other door, and while I agreed with that, I told them that we weren't going to, and that management had suggested we used their door as it's closer and wider making the whole process much more effortless. Since then they've been giving me the side eye and I know from other sources that they've been talking smack about me. 

I don't really care about those things, it's a waste of time and energy, and I haven't changed my behavior towards them. I'll still greet them with a smile, and help them whenever they need it while making small talk and showing the same interest in them as the rest of the office.

Then one day I happened to come in to work before any of them. And as I was walking with my fresh cup of coffee towards my office, I see one of them enter through said door. I grin to myself and continue walking only to see that yet another one enter right after.

Turns out that door is prohibited from being used by anyone BUT them. 

I now control what our keyfobs can unlock. After seeing them acting out this double standard of theirs I asked upper management if it wouldn't be easier to just remove the ability for anyone to actually use our keyfobs on that door entirely so that we could avoid their complaints. They agreed and I did so.

I then went to them to inform them that they wouldn't have to worry about anyone using the door any longer, and that I hoped that they'd appreciate what I'd done to help them mitigate this source of irritation and frustration. 

Now I actually get to say good morning to them everyday I show up earlier than them, because they have to walk past my office to get to their seating area :)

https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/s/ppJAbNlzIj

So um, while my FP was texting me he loves me and how he's worried he was telling the camp neighbours that he was leaving on a train and packed up his backpack.

He didn't tell me until 5 hours after when I complained about something again and I was so shocked cuz a few seconds before he said we'd talk later??? And now I have to go home alone, somehow carrying a tent, a table, two chairs, a cooling box and three bags on my own between three different train stations, which was already near impossible with another person helping me when I came. He also owes me 175 that I'm never getting back since he blocked me.

Essentially, when I complained he sent me a pre-prepared paragraph that I later realized he was writing while we were cuddling the other night and while he was comforting me cuz I felt horrible about something unrelated to him. And good lord, that paragraph was the meanest thing I've ever read in my life, Ive been bullied and abused all my life, I've had racists slurs thrown at me and been thrown down stairs and yet none of that is as mean as that text. I would've understood if he had complained about how he can't deal with my BPD and left it at that, which he did indirectly but no. He instead mentioned my body count, my horrible personality, my social incompentence and how my mental disabilities are extremely obvious (he has autism and ADHD as well so it confused me), how he's not surprised I don't get compliments because I was more attractive before testosterone it scares people off (which is something I vented to him the night before), how my breath smells, how I apparently don't care about my mother (full on not true) and pretty much every single other I had ever mentioned to him being insecure about. I got blocked right after.

Why would you do that to someone? Why would you not tell me you're leaving when it's happening? Or right after??? He didn't even mention that he left in the paragraph, I found out 5 hours later from the neighbours. Why would you waste 400+ euros by leaving after less than a day when you're broke. 

By the way, I admit I was wrong, especially because I split at some point, but that was because he wasn't spending any time with me, kept lashing out at me when I even suggested getting to know other people (in a platonic way???), he said ""I don't care"" and ""Why are you whining so much"" when I asked to borrow his charging cable cuz I lost mine on the way here despite me being the person who bought EVERYTHING we haf at the camp and the food, spending 500+ euros total on it, him only eating the expensive fast food despite refusing to get me a coffee because he wants to save money which would also make half the food I bought go bad, him constantly leaving somewhere for two days straight without asking if I wanna come or even telling me he's leaving. I could go on.

I get that he's disabled, so am I, but I don't get how I'm in the wrong for complaining about hypocrisy, being lashed out at or nothing going the way we had planned it to (or rather I, cuz I did everything, all he did was show up and he was supposed to then give me his part of the bus+ train money after). I wish I had just come alone, it ruined my whole time so far and the neighbours hate me cuz he befriended them and they probably don't like me cuz of that. 

I just don't get it, I would never leave someone on a trip like that, no matter how annoyed I was. I would especially not do it while insulting them with every single thing they're insecure about. I feel so betrayed and lied to and I cried for two hours yesterday, for the first time ever since I started testosterone 9 months ago cuz that makes it near impossible to do it. I feel sm more uncomfortable than before, everyone's looking at my hairy legs and my chest tape and armit hair and now after what he told me I feel so much more uncomfortable. He told me he loves me but he had a two page paragraph with insults waiting for me at the first complaint I gave, despite already being on his way home.

That's my biggest problem.

I've wanted to change my diet for a while, but I find it difficult. I could certainly cut down on my binge eating, but for me, the sugar is the biggest issue. I suppose most people would describe myself as a sugar addict or fiend. Sugary coffee or tea in the morning, sugary snacks and desserts later, and sugary beverages all day long. It's awful and a little excessive. As for supps, I take vit d, ashwagandha, l theanine and moda from now, ndepot and highstreetpharma but sometimes it gives me anxiety and I don't know whether have sugar in it as its mentioned they don't.

I honestly think if I can just get over the intense sugar cravings, things will be a lot easier for me.

Wanted to see if anything in particular worked out for anybody. I was going to do chronium picolinate but I'm wary of the literature on it. I was also going to try acv but the gummy kind sucks.

I don't need to completely cut out sugar, but I need to make it to where half of what I eat isn't just sugary.

Anyways I got home and gave the gifts to them both. They were pleased with the gifts and my girlfriend enjoyed the flowers, however when she seen I had gotten food for myself she had gotten all sad and asked me in a sad voice if I had gotten her any.

I feel like a terrible pet parent but here we are. For context my partner and I have 4 cats (2 neutered male domestic shorthairs and 2 spayed female Maine Coones) along with a ball python and corn snake. They are all very curious about one another but we are aware of the immense risk of harm if they interact (on both sides) and ensure there is zero chance for direct encounters. The tanks are off the ground with plenty of hides so the snakes can have privacy but the cats sometimes watch from the ground if the snakes are exploring their tanks. 

We’ve had the snakes about 8 years, the shorthair males 2.5 years, and the Maine Coons a little over a year. 

Earlier this afternoon we noticed one of the boys was acting really anxious and couldn’t figure out why. He was squatting and walking hunched over and being incredibly clingy. At one point he kept staring at the coffee table and moving his head back and forth like he was staring at something. 

I took a quick glance and saw a fly that the other cats were interested in and chalked it up to that. Then, this evening, we discovered that the ball python somehow broke a component of his cage and got out. 

We thankfully found him and fixed the cage so he’s safe and secure again. But our cat is still acting incredibly anxious and avoiding the living room (where the tank is). 

We tried lots of positive reinforcement and taking him into the room and pushing on the glass to show him the snake is back in his tank and can’t get him. That seemed to help a little but I can’t help but feel like they probably came nose to nose (possibly under the coffee table) and I don’t know how to help our kitty be less anxious about it. 

We ordered pheromone diffusers and calming collars and are planning to offer treats in the room tomorrow. Is there anything else we can do? Is there a suggested timeline for how long we should wait before we take him to the vet for the anxiety? 

I appreciate all help and ideas!

1la8x6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/1la8x6k/will_btc_ever_become_sustainable/,Will BTC ever become sustainable?,"My criticisms for BTC were always 4 things.   


1. People may be ok with exposing their everyday microtransactions, but they would NOT be ok with exposing their net worth. Censorship resistance is great in theory, but as a store of value btc is becoming hotter to handle as more and more people's digital identities get exposed online to criminals trying to rob whales of their btc. This includes the government. Hence the flight to things like monero.   


2. The energy tax is too great. As people buying to BTC, they are unknowingly paying an energy tax. As miners get their block rewards they would have to sell off some of the BTC they mine to sustain their operations - most of these costs being energy consumption. Unless this current surge in demand for nuclear energy due to AI infrastructure expansions catches on and also lets BTC miners use nuclear energy, these expenses will grow out of proportion and continue to be paid for by market participants.   


3. Mining centralization is inevitable because of what reason no.2 and the halving system. Every halving will price out more and more smaller miners. Only those with access to cheap limitless energy, security, and economy of scale will be able to mine. Eventually the endgame would see only a few mining entities left, exposing the BTC total hashrate to more than 50% control under one entity. Even if it's a 1% probability, this would be enough to warrant fear and uncertainty, a breakdown of trust.   


4. Transaction fees are not enough. Right now transaction fees account for about 10\~15% of total mining revenue. The only way this becomes enough to cover for operation costs and then have profitable spread is global energy costs continue decreasing, rather than decreasing.   


I personally believe that even if BTC survives as a store of value, things like XNO would still shine as the more practical utility when it comes to microstransactions. For example, if the cheapest fee I'd have to pay on the btc network exceeds 10 dollars, then I wouldn't pay that fee to buy a coffee.

(Obviously this is a joke I just wanted to share that not posting each chapter as it's written does NOT save you from that curse, feel free to laugh at us)",0,1749795639.0,AO3,2,0.4,False

1la8v9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1la8v9u/he_calls_me_high_maintenance_he_has_no_idea_what/,He calls me “high maintenance.” He has no idea what I’ve survived.,"Last night we had a little fight. Nothing huge, just one of those dumb arguments where you’re tired and stressed and say things you shouldn’t. He called me “high maintenance” because I wanted to stop for coffee on the way to his cousin’s barbecue. I laughed it off in the moment, but it stuck with me all night.

He doesn’t know why I always want coffee before seeing his family. He doesn’t know that it’s not about caffeine, it’s about control. About having something warm to hold in my hands when I feel anxious and out of place.

He doesn’t know that when I spend a long time doing my makeup, it’s not vanity, it’s armor. I was made fun of for how I looked most of my life, and when I was 19, someone I trusted took that body and did what they wanted with it. I swore I’d never leave the house feeling exposed again.

He doesn’t know that when I ask him to walk me to my car at night, it’s not because I’m scared of the dark. It’s because I was followed home once by a man who didn’t stop until I ran into a gas station screaming.

He doesn’t know because I haven’t told him. I want to. But I’m scared it’ll change how he looks at me.

I want him to know that I’m not “high maintenance.” I’m just a woman who’s had to maintain herself through things that could’ve broken her.",2,1749795613.0,confession,5,0.56,False

Basically, I’ve put it off because my job can be pretty stressful but turns out while I’m in the office I get zero cravings ? I popped half a 2mg gum on Tuesday because the fatigue was causing me to almost fall asleep at my desk (no amount of coffee was helping lol)


But I find now when I WFH my cravings are way worse ? Even when I was properly vaping all day everyday and I was working in the office I was able to leave the house at 7:00am and not vape till lunch time (1pm) and then not vape again until I got home (~6pm) yet when I worked from home I was hitting it constantly? Now when I’m WFH I just keep getting distracted because of the cravings. 


Basically, funnily enough, I’m finding quitting easier when I’m in the office vs being at home? Has anyone got any advice to shift my mindset at home?",1,1749795482.0,QuitVaping,0,1.0,False
