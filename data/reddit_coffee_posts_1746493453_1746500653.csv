Just ran into my daughter's teacher at the coffee shop. She came over to tell me a really sweet story of Miss 12yo. 

At school camp last week they did an exercise where each kid had a brown paper bag with their name on it. And all the kids could write something they liked or noticed anonymously about each other, and put them in the persons bag. 

The teacher told me Miss 12 got heaps of bits of paper. But more importantly, she said Miss 12 put nice comments in all of the bags that didn't get many. And encouraged her best friend to do the same. 

She doesn't get her sweetness from me. But I'm SO proud of her!

1kfughq,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1kfughq/just_found_out_i_have_hydrosalpinx/,Just found out I have hydrosalpinx,"Sorry in advance for the long message. My mind has kind of been spinning for the past 5 days. Let's start this story 2 years ago.
Also Hi, I (24) about 2 years ago started noticing a lot of changes in my body, cramping randomly throughout my cycle, pretty mild ovulation cramps (which has never been a thing for me), severe bloating, continuous constipation.  (To where every 3 days i have to take a laxative tea).
I started just monitoring my body, cutting things out, coffee, sweets, etc. Realized nothing was really making a difference. 
At the time I didn't really have good health care. It was costing me 300$ just to be SEEN by a doctor. So I told myself when I got better health insurance I would take care of myself. 
Im a firm believer in the whole ""listen to your body"" thing. I truly believe you, and only you know when something is not right.
Anyway, ive been doing a ton of research, looking into my family history etc. And came up with 3 possible solutions as to what could be wrong.
1. Fibroids
2. Cysts
3. Endometriosis

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago I found a really great obgyn. Super friendly staff, I felt listened to, I addressed my concerns, and got scheduled for a vaginal ultrasound right away. 
5 days ago I had my ultrasound.
I was told no fibroids, or no cysts. 
Few. That's great news right?.

Then the other np comes in the room after the fact to let me know that yes im cleared for those, however they discovered liquid in my tube. Hydrosalpinx she said. She said it was hard to tell which tube, because they were both overlapped, but that it most likely is the left one. 
Me being shocked I basically asked what that meant and what causes it and she began to tell me that it could be endo but she couldn't tell me for sure without a laparoscopy. 
I proceeded to ask her if Hydrosalpinx would affect my fertility and she said it could.
She let me know that it wasn't super urgent,  that I could think about what I wanted to do.

And thats all I've been doing every day. THINKING.
Im so spun around I have absolutely no idea what to think. Now im concerned at the fact that I won't even be able to have kids. I've done nothing but lurk on this page just reading other people's horror stories! 
Im about to be 25. I always gone back and fourth of if i wanted kids, but I think it would be horrific if I dont even get the option! I've been with my boyfriend coming on 3 years.
He's been nothing but supportive, but unfortunately he just doesnt get the full extent of it, so I've kinda just come on here to idk rant? Not really sure what im looking for,but maybe someone out there has advice or words of wisdom? I have no idea.
But now im like, okay I went in for one thing and left with a whole nother problem. 
I still think I have endo,  as a matter of fact im like 90% sure just given my symptoms over the past couple of years.
All I can think of is how long has my tube been clogged? Is it fixable? Do I have to get it removed? I must have to get it removed because it can cause harm to any potential fetuses.

Right now I think my next step is just basically confirming which tube is blocked and how severely.
So im thinking of either hsg, or possibly an MRI. Something not as invasive as a laparoscopy right off the bat.
I've tried to reach out to the dr office to just ask all my questions but haven't heard back yet which is kinda making matters worse.
My concern is just doing a laparoscopy first without any further knowledge.  I would like to avoid that all together but upon my research thats the only way to test for endometriosis ( correct me if im wrong) .",1,1746500470.0,WomensHealth,0,1.0,False

my ex (20f) broke up with me (20m) after a 10 months relationship. she was my first love, i was her 6th, but she trusted me so much she gave me her ""first time"" which made me cherish her even more. however i was inexperienced during the relationship, constantly avoided her during our small, bickering ""arguments"". and due to my job i couldn't spend enough time for her and i had weird temper. i did take her to our uni, trained together at the gym, took her to coffee shops to do our assignments, some little dates, came over to her apartment and had intercourse most of the time.

i thought that was enough time spent for her. but because i was too busy i couldn't take her to the airport (3 times, she's an exchange student in my city, her home city is on the other side of my country) she got sad over that and told me she didn't want me to make excuses. she also had difficulty making friends in a different city. i was inexperienced, but i feel like she wasn't that forgiving and understanding about...why i was constantly busy. she said she understood but she still wanted me to spend time when i barely could spend time for myself. so she broke up with me on the 10th month.

however after 3 weeks i reached out to her again and we texted again. but a few weeks passed and i got scared, thinking i might hurt her again, and i unintentionally avoided her. so 3-4 months after that she really did try to pull me back, she was willing to give me another chance. but again, i was scared. and also i messed it up even more because i started texting another girl and she didn't know that, she still doesn't, but my ex said she would wait until i'd calmed down. another 3 months passed (now), i was finally certain about my feelings, she told me she has moved on and she doesn't wanna give me another chance anymore. she is more focused on herself and she is...happy. i am happy for her too. but i still love her so much. i begged and cried and did what i shouldn't have done when people try to get their exes back. ***i also made the dumb mistake of venting out my feelings about our relationship on my facebook account.*** she saw my posts and she didn't like them. she told me she doesn't have anything else to say to me and no longer has any reason to see me again.

***i don't know what to do. i don't want to lose her.*** she did tell me to try and focus on myself and try to change myself. she said we could videocall sometimes, but she changed her mind about that after a few days. i feel like i've changed a lot. but we did videocall once a few days ago and she said she felt like i was still the same person before. she said she will come back to my city in June 2026 to finish her last 2 semesters. but i'm afraid by that time she will have already fully moved on, or will have found someone else. i'm still trying to text her, she still replies. but she just doesn't really reach out for me. i understand why she no longer does that. i made her wait for me during those 4 months she was trying to pull me back. i messed up. i don't want her to go..",1,1746500226.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Hi, I am Thomas! Living life to the fullest as best I can these days, but I am not interested in doing it alone. I want to have someone to cherish and hold while we talk about anything and everything. I got my faults like being overweight and depression, however it’s improving thankfully! Thankfully, I got my own place and a decent life…I just hate being alone all the time. I want to have some cooperation with someone but not be too excessive of course! Just enough to make life worth living and enjoy which is what I seek most. 

Some things about me:

	
◦	6 feet tall, hazel eyes, brown hair, shaved face, and I wear shorts almost all year round, unless I am at work.

	◦	Enjoying the outdoors is very much a priority for me
	◦	I love collecting movies and watching them on my fancy, expensive TV (not to brag or anything)
	
◦	Riding my bicycle and traveling are enjoyable to me plus I got bike rack for my car for two bicycles
	
◦	Cooking is something I want to get better at and all ready have a good assortment of tools for the job in my kitchen and would like to acquire more
	
◦	I enjoy tea and coffee more than most things
If you are interested, then let me know!

I imagine that we normally don't think much about these Daily Quests, as they're not super significant or really exciting or anything, just very short tasks that we get daily for an easy 100 Silver. As a result I don't have a daily quest that I super love or super hate, but I thought it'd be fun to ask anyway. With that said, there are a few that I look forward to more or less so than others. So here's my favourite and least favourite Daily Quests:

Favourites - Probably the ""Foodie"" series of quests, mainly because it's extremely quick, easy, and fast travelling there isn't a huge hassle since he's close to the entrance of City F. Plus, if you've completed the chain once, you're just able to just skip the questions entirely and it's easy money. The last quest of this chain is even easier, not even requiring me to answer any of the questions. This one's just super convenient for me.

I'd also go for anything that involves fighting a monster since it's at least mildly fun, apart from ""Drifter's Treasure 3"" for the tedious travel distance of those quests.

Least Favourites - I have two:
- The ""Coffee Research Diary"" series of quests, besides the last one. I don't really like these at all. They aren't hard, but they're just tedious, feeling longer than it actually is. The reason they are for me is because I always need to go to the coffee shop, which I can't just fast travel in or out of, meaning having to wait through at least four load screens just for the coffee shop parts. It could be just me, but my load screens take about 5-7 seconds a pop. On top of that, I usually need to go to some other places that requires another load screen. The worst of these has to be the Maids Café one, since you have to travel to another city for quite a long distance and enter another building you have to get in and out of, and totals to eight load screens...
- The ""Drifter's Treasure"" series of quests. It's mainly for one reason, you have to travel a long distance, from City Z to the sewers, then go through one tunnel system to another before you finally get to him. It's really boring and I wish there was a way to teleport to every major location, not just the main city areas of each city (how I feel about the coffee quests too). The only upside is that you can teleport out of the sewers back to HQ easily once you're done.

As I said, I don't have a super strong opinion on any of these side quests, so anything I say here isn't me outright loving or hating them, I just find a few to be better or worse than others is all.",1,1746499659.0,OnePunchManWorldGame,0,1.0,False

Only 2 concerns if I can connect with them: 
1) the machines are high maintenance
2) no clue how this type of offering would do in America, I can see it well used in NYC, but how about regular high traffic malls or downtown areas of none major cities.

## Key Features Analysis

The elements that define a successful man cave decor scheme extend beyond mere aesthetics. They encompass practical considerations that enhance comfort,utility,and overall enjoyment of the space.

**Smart Lighting Systems:** Integrating smart lighting systems allows for customizable ambiance.Users can adjust brightness,color temperature,and even create pre-programmed scenes perfect for movie nights,game days,or quiet relaxation. These systems often integrate with voice assistants for hands-free control and energy efficiency.

A system with tunable white light is essential. This allows you to shift from cool, radiant light for activities like working on projects to warm, dim light to relax while watching movies or playing video games. Many systems can also be programmed to gradually dim the lights for bedtime reading which greatly enhances relaxation and sleep quality.

**Soundproofing Materials:** Achieving optimal soundproofing is crucial, especially if the man cave is intended for entertainment or loud hobbies. Acoustic panels, thick curtains, and sound-dampening insulation can substantially reduce noise bleed, preventing disturbances to other household members and ensuring a focused environment within the cave.

High-density foam panels, available in various textures and colors, not only absorb sound waves but also contribute to the overall aesthetic. consider layering different materials to maximize sound absorption across a wider frequency range. This is especially important if you plan for activities involving music, games or entertainment.

**Comfort-Centric Seating:** Ergonomic seating is paramount for long hours of relaxation or gaming. Recliners with lumbar support, oversized beanbag chairs, and modular sofas provide a variety of options for different activities. Look for durable materials that can withstand heavy use and are easy to clean.

Modular sofas are an excellent choice for their versatility. They can be easily rearranged to accommodate different group sizes or activities. Reclining features offers premium comfort for extended relaxation. Consider investing in high-quality leather or microfiber upholstery for durability and aesthetic appeal.

**Customized Storage Solutions:** Keeping the man cave organized is essential for maximizing its functionality and appeal. Customized storage solutions such as built-in shelves, cabinets, and concealed compartments offer ample space for housing entertainment systems, collectibles, and other personal items.

Wall-mounted shelves are a great option for showing off collectibles. Hidden compartments behind hinged wall panels give practical spaces to store items which are frequently used but don't need to be within constant visible access. Consider integrating cable management systems to maintain a tidy look by concealing wires and cables.

**Integrated entertainment Systems:** A centerpiece of any man cave is the entertainment system. This often includes a large-screen television, a high-quality sound system, and gaming consoles. Integrating these components seamlessly into the decor ensures a visually appealing and immersive experience.

Consider a projector system for a truly cinematic experience. This allows you to create a colossal screen, which is easily stored when not in use. Don't neglect the audio – a surround sound system can drastically enhance the experience when viewing sports games or action movies, bringing an element of immersion which transforms everyday vieweing into a unique experience.

1kftsza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1kftsza/i_have_a_gym_crush_who_has_a_gf_need_advice_on/,I have a gym crush who has a gf. Need advice on how to move on without it being awkward.,"I (f) developed a crush on this guy for a little over a month now. Thinking back I think I saw him before in my apartment lobby. It was months ago but I didn’t know who he was or was interested at that time. He was just a random guy who waved “Hi” at me through a glass door while I was waiting for the elevator 😅. I smiled and waved back but didn’t think much of it.

Fast forward to a little over a month ago, and I’m in my apartment’s gym. In walks in this HANDSOME guy that made me stutter on the elliptical. Almost locked up my knee when I saw him. Visually and physically he is very attractive, and I couldn’t stop staring. Thank goodness his back was to me while he was on the treadmill.

We would catch each other’s eyes and he would smile and nod in greeting and I would do the same. We never spoke in the gym due to I wore headphones and I like to be in the zone when I work out. I NEED my music and podcasts to distract me from the physical beating I give myself with a little bit of motivation. He doesn’t wear headphones at all which I noticed when he was closer to me on one occasion. 

After a point of seeing each other in our gym routine, it felt like we were “gym buddies” and he seemed to make sure I see him to greet me when he arrives. FYI, I always arrive in the gym before he does, and would usually be at the dumbbells with my back to the cardio machines (which is where he starts). He made it a habit to find me, make eye contact and wave hello before he starts his workout. I thought it was cute.

Then I finally got the courage to talk to him! Something simple and I rehearsed the heck out of it for days. One thing about me is I make it a point to not show any interest in a guy unless I know for sure it’s mutual interest. Otherwise, he will never know and I’ll continue to just be polite and nice. Smile and nod. Laugh politely and make small talk. Keep it short and leave. Nothing different from how I speak to others.

I was prepared to say something small in the gym but when the elevator opened there he was; on his way to the gym same as me. He smiled and nodded and I smiled politely and said hi. I was nervous and completely forgot what I wanted to say but I wanted to say SOMETHING! So I gave him a genuine compliment on his tattoos (I love a guy with tats especially full sleeves and he has them). We had a small chat while on the elevator and then we got to the lobby. I’m not exaggerating when I say he ran (or jogged) to open the door for me to pass through. My walking gate is faster than his so I made it to that door in record time. He sped up his walk; I heard the quick steps. It shocked me a little, but I love chivalry. What a gentleman, right? He wished me a “hope you have a great workout” and I wished him the same. I was on Cloud Nine! I finally said something, and I didn’t stumble over my words.

This is where the high starts to wane 😔.

One day he came in the gym with a girl. I didn’t think too much of it but still was curious: was she a friend or girlfriend? (Definitely not siblings: he’s white and she’s black… unless adopted 😅. SPOILER: not adopted). So he guides her to the treadmill and with how close he was to her I immediately thought “definitely gf”. However, I kept catching him looking over at me often. When he was talking to his gf, he would cut his eye over at me then resume talking to her. When they moved to the weight rack, he cut his eye to me as he walked past. Once I was done with my workout, I kept my eyes forward and didn’t look at him. However while his gf was doing stretches and as I passed then he looked over at me but said nothing. That was first and only time he didn’t say anything to me, understandably so.

Though at the time I didn’t have full confirmation she was his gf, I assumed with the way they interacted for sure they were together. I was sad, of course but not devastated. This may sound bad, but I never allow myself to truly believe any crush may develop into something real. I always believe there is a 1% chance of this happening and I just live in my daydream of make believe and live a whole life with my crush until the crush dies out and I move on. It allows me to enjoy the “lovey-dovey” emotions while preserving my feelings.

The next time I see him it’s at the gym and it’s as if nothing changed. He made sure to find me, wave hello and started his workout. I noticed he started to exercise closer to me even when there is more space elsewhere (seriously, it was only us in the gym). There’s plenty of space and I make it a point to take the smallest area possible to allow someone else the room. He chooses to stretch right behind me, weight lift right next to my face. He even walked closely behind me while on the elliptical. As much as I thought “could he be interested in me? I hope so” and kept reminding myself of the girl he brought in before and how he might be taken.

Then one day I saw him and the girl from before exit the elevator while I am crossing the lobby en route to the elevator. I was staring at the girl to get a better look at her and wasn’t looking at him. It wasn’t until we were practically shoulder to shoulder that I looked at him and he smiled, nodded his head and mouthed a “Hi” in passing. I smiled and nodded and continued on.

Eventually I just kept my head in my gym routine and tried my best to focus on other things. Even the few times he came to the gym, I kept my headphones on, turned the music louder and left before he was done or stayed longer so he left first. Tried to limit interaction with him as best as I could.

Now for what happened today:

I’m in the gym and rounding out my cardio for the night when he enters. I kept my eyes down on my phone watching a video but I notice he slows his walk to the treadmill and see him looking at me. I look up and he smiles and says “it’s cold in here” and laughs a little bit. I smile and agreed before he started his workout (tbh it was. The A/C was cranked on high as if it was 95 degrees in the summer. It’s 65 outside! wtf?).

I leave the gym first and make my way to the elevators. As I’m waiting for it, I notice it’s still going to upper floors so I got my mail thinking I have time. When I came back, he’s at the elevators too. He stared at me and looked like he wanted to say something and it felt kind of awkward so I made small talk:

Me: “Had a good workout?”

Him: “Yea. I’m really sweaty which is weird considering it was really cold in there.”

Me: “Yea it was pretty cold. Someone must have told them to turn on the A/C.”

Him: “What about you? Had a good workout?”

Me: “I’m sweaty too but had a good workout as well.”

Him: “Good. Do you come down here often?”

Me: “Yep. 5 days a week, 2-3 times a day.”

Him: “That’s a lot. You’re not tired?”

Me: “No. I space it out. Cardio in the morning and weightlifting in the evening”

Him: “Oh wow. I couldn’t do that. My heart would beat like an old man’s and I would start to get dizzy and get out of breath lol” (this man looks like he exercises on a daily bases with muscles pushing through his shirt 🤨. His thighs and calves are shapely and he uses 50lb dumbbells to do lower body… sir don’t play stupid with me 😆).

“Then too I also drink a lot of coffee”

Me: “I do too, but maybe not as much as you do I think.”

Him: “You must have good genetics then to be able to do that.”

Me: “I hear an accent. Where are you from?”

Him: “Russia.”

(I’m shocked. Not because he’s Russian but I clued in on the accent a while back but couldn’t place it to save my life so I called him “Russian Guy” for the longest until I had the courage to ask him. I had it right all this time lol).

Me: “What are you doing in USA? Do you have family still in Russia?”

Him: “I’m here to be a US citizen. Yea, but I don’t speak to them much.” (S/N: I wanted to ask him why doesn’t he keep in touch with them but decided to keep that to myself.)

Me: “Do you have family here?”

Him: “I think you saw my gf before, right?”

Me: *Nod in heartbreak*

Him: “Yea, I live with her here. No other family. Just us. What about you? Do you live here alone and have family here?”

Me: “Born and raised here, and I live here in the apartment alone but my family is still here in the city.”

Him: “Oh you must love it here.”

Me: “I love the city. It’s home to me but I love to travel.”

Him: “Here in the States or outside?”

Me: “Outside.”

Him: “Have you been to Argentina?”

Me: “No.”

Him: “You should go. You’ll like it.”

At that time, the elevator stopped on my floor and there was a guy about to get on. I beelined out of the elevator before he could say anything else. When I got into my apartment, I had a goofy smile on my face. Not only was it the longest convo I had with him but I genuinely enjoyed our conversation and I wanted to know more about him. I had more questions I wanted to ask. Then as I replayed our conversation, the confirmation of he has a gf put a damper on my head excitement. And out of respect for his relationship, and to put a stop to any progression on feelings I need to stop interacting with him.

The issue is I see him at my apartment gym and sometimes pass him in the lobby and hallways. It’ll be awkward to just ignore him, especially since he goes out of his way to make sure I see him so he waves hello, and now it seems he’s comfortable to make small talk in the gym and at the elevator. It’ll can see where he may want to engage in conversation in the future and I would have to put in major effort to not develop stronger feelings.

Has anyone ever ran into something like this and how did you handle this? Any advice on how to navigate this as this is in my apartments gym and just ignoring him would not only be rude but also difficult.

1kftogm,https://www.reddit.com/r/jura/comments/1kftogm/jura_repair_experiences/,Jura repair experiences,"tl;dr...Hello, brand new member here. I thought I'd share some past and recent experiences with Jura and repairing my Jura machines. I have a J90 and a J6. The J90 has been back to the US Jura repair facility multiple times, with many of those paid for by me. A couple times, the problem occurred within the blink-of-an-eye repair warranty period and I paid only for the shipping to New Jersey (here in the States, it costs $400-500 to send an out-of-warranty machine back to Jura for repairs).

I like the J90. But it sure seems to have recurring problems that an expensive machine shouldn't. Most recently, I sent it back last September after getting an error message that wouldn't clear. When I received it back, the beans in the hopper never fed correctly, and I had to push them down with a wooden chopstick—not occasionally, every time. I was annoyed, but okay with this because it's a hassle to box up and ship out. Then in March, I started getting the ""Not enough ground coffee"" error despite there being plenty of beans in the hopper. I called Jura. Of course, I was past the repair warranty period. They told me that either I could send it back and pay the usual $470 to have it fixed, or I could get a discount on a new machine. The discounts did not make any of the machines affordable.

I did what any cheapass but discriminating coffee drinker would do: I bought a used Jura J6 at Goodwill. This machine is very similar to the J90. This particular machine was pretty beat up, but it cost a *lot* less than the Jura repair charge, much less a brand new machine. It's a good thing that the J6 is a lot like the J90, because my Goodwill machine was short a few parts that I found were plug-and-play from the now-crippled J90.

The J6 worked for a while. But it was ""rode hard and put away wet"", as some might say. I think it must've been used in an office or a small restaurant, because not only was it cosmetically beat up, the counter revealed it had spewed out over 11,000 servings! No wonder it looked well-worn.

The J6 worked for a while. But then, maybe ironically, it gave me the same ""Not enough ground coffee"" error that I had on my J90. As my ex-wife used to tell me...repeatedly...""There's a reason it was at Goodwill.""

So, another call to Jura. They recommended some superficial actions like vacuuming out the beans hopper and wiping things off with a paper towel, which I knew in advance wouldn't do anything. Then came the ""You'll have to send it back to us"" alternative, which I also knew in advance I would not do. That left me with two essentially dead super-automatic Jura machines, and a pour-over cone and filter morning coffee regimen.

All of this forced me into a dark place: YouTube, Jura repair videos, and Amazon. It may have changed my (coffee-drinking) life. Here's a little-known fact: Jura uses semi-proprietary oval-headed screws to hold their machines together. This is the only application I have ever seen these used in. Without a special oval-headed wrench, they would be impossible to remove. Not surprisingly, but fortunately, these can be found on Amazon. I ordered a couple, from different vendors (unlike everything else associated with Jura, they are not expensive). I also ordered a couple of sets of stainless steel grinder burrs, since my issues seemed to revolve around coffee grinding  malfunctions of some sort.

While I was waiting for parts and tools to arrive, I watched the YouTube videos on Jura disassembly and repairs. Repeatedly. As it turns out, taking these machines apart is not rocket science. It's pretty straightforward, if you watch the YouTube videos obsessively. Which I did. Six oval-headed screws, three torx 15 screws, and the sides and the top come off. With the outside removed and the insides laid bare, a mere mortal can access the grinder mechanism and brew group. The overused J6 from Goodwill was particularly nasty inside, with lots of ground coffee, mold—and a cleaning tablet stuck in the gullet of the tube exiting the grinder feeding into the brew group. Everything was easy to vacuum out and clean up. Changing out the grinder burrs took a little more effort, and study of the YouTube video. Reassembly of the machine went fine.

This morning, with some trepidation, I fired up the J6 and voilá! Espresso! No error messages!

To cut this overly long story short...same deal with the J90. I opened it up and cleaned ground coffee out of the clogged feeder tube. Reassembly, power, another functioning Jura espresso machine.

Moral of the story is that if you're outside of your warranty, you can work around (some) malfunctions of these complicated super automatics. Give it a try. You may be surprised, like I was.

1kftmqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kftmqu/dumped_after_2_great_dates_and_feeling_shattered/,Dumped after 2 great dates and feeling shattered,"I got dumped over the week by a girl I went on two dates with, and it almost feels as bad as the heartbreak I had after breaking up with my college girlfriend of nearly five years.

I matched with a girl about a month ago that lives in a city about an hour away, and we quickly went from some light talk about an activity to planning a coffee date. I couldn't tell much from the first date, I felt like I was awkward but the conversation went well. We walked around after coffee for a few hours until she had to leave, but we both agreed we were looking for something more serious and long term. I hinted at another date and she started blushing, saying that she would really like that.

We planned another date immediately for the next weekend. She listed a few different restaurants and said that we could always go to the other ones another time, so she was hinting at having even more dates. Throughout the week we didn't text much, just small stuff that I guess made us think of each other.

For the second date, we met up for an activity, then got dinner afterward. Dinner went well, at one point she was brushing her foot against my leg. After dinner we got ice cream and walked around a neighborhood for several hours, just getting to know each other and laughing. Afterward, we were in her car talking and eventually starting making out. We went between that and talking more for another hour or two, and talked a little about a third date where she would come to my city, but she had to travel the next weekend for a conference, and the weekend after that was her grad school graduation, but said she would be free that weekend. She also mentioned she preferred getting to know me in person rather than text. 

I drove home, and texted her the next day about having a third date in two weeks. She agreed and seemed excited. The week leading up to her conference, we didn't text much, just some light stuff again. Over the weekend of her conference, she started texting me more. I guess while she was at the hotel when it was over, she had more free time. We texted about the city she was staying in and the show was watching.

When she got back home on Sunday, she let me know, and I asked her about the flight. It took her almost a day to respond. I was a little worried that it took so long, because even though we didn't text a lot the previous two weeks, it would only take like 2-4 hours for her to respond. I chalked it up to being tired from travel and needing to catch up on things at home. When she responded, I asked something else, and again she took a day to respond. I became extremely anxious. I had a gut feeling that something was not right, so I started talking to my friends about what could be happening. They all reassured me that it didn't seem like anything was going wrong, she was probably just busy and not a big texter, but I didn't feel any better.

I winded down the conversation and didn't ask anymore questions. I waited another day before texting her again with the plans for our weekend. She responded that she wanted to reschedule because her family came a day early for her graduation. I said I could do earlier, but she said that wouldn't work, and after her graduation she was going on a family trip for two weeks, but would love to see me after that. I wasn't super thrilled about that, but I told her that I still wanted to go out with her. I also asked if we could at least do a call to catch up, and she agreed and said she'd find time for that before she left.

The weekend comes around, and I'm giving her space to be with her family, but I'm very stressed about the situation because it's a long time to go without a date. I spent the day with two of my female friends and talking to them about the situation, and mentioned sending her flowers for her graduation. They both thought it'd be a really sweet/thoughtful gesture but I didn't know where to send them, so I asked her if I could send her something for graduation and where it would be okay to send them.

Her response was that she appreciated the gesture but didn't think that I was a good fit for her right now and dumped me. I was a little blind-sided because she had just been saying how excited she was to see me, said she was finding time to do a call, had been talking about future dates previously, and was texting me so much the last weekend when she was out of town. The only thing that I can think of was asking about the flowers, but I feel like that could have been brushed off with a ""that's nice but you really don't need to"" or something.

We had both established at the beginning we were looking for a relationship, nothing short term/hookup kind of thing. We had a lot of similar interests and beliefs.

It's been a few days now, and I feel like shit. I felt like we had a really good connection after the second date. It was everything I was looking for, and it was directly in front of me. It felt like everything was going right and in the right direction. Now I'm just confused. I've been swiping on apps for year, and talking to girls at bars or social events for years, and never found anything like this. I feel so hopeless now.",1,1746497873.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

9 nights. Renting a car. 

Arrive in Dublin day 1- early check in at hotel. Hop on/off bus, Christ church, national botanical garden (I think the bus stops there or near). Take it easy. Look around. Early dinner- early to bed. 
Day2- drive (&stay the night) to Kilkenny. No real plans here. Nothing specifically caught our eye so any suggestions for things to do is appreciated! Planned to maybe rents bikes and just tool around town! 
Day3- leaving Kilkenny and stopping for the afternoon to explore Cork a bit. I saw donuts are a thing there so… yes please. Blarney castle stop. Wander the English market. 
Day3-5 Killarney. Have a guided hike of Torc Mountain & lake kayaking scheduled. Planning to do Muck Ross house for lunch between activities and spend the whole day in the park. A day for the spa at Behron hotel and exploring leisurely. Again- a little unplanned time here and would love some local suggestions! 
Day 6-9 Galway. Planning to hit the cliffs on the drive from Killarney. Doing one day to Inis Mor. Have a baking class and beach horse ride scheduled another day. And a third day of again, exploring, leisurely coffee and books, etc etc. 
leave on day 10 out of Shannon. 

What majors are we missing that we shouldn’t miss? Any ‘off the beaten path’ type things we could do on some leisure days? Is this too much? Too little? Are we selling ourselves short? 

We’re more explorer type vacationers. Don’t like to be scheduled to death, but also want to know we planned some good things since we may not be back for some time! 

Thanks folks. Reading as we’ve been planning has been so helpful in this group! Just selfishly looking for a little tailored feedback!

So I wrote something for my future daughter.*** 

To my future daughter, 

The night before I turned 25, I cried myself to sleep on a mattress on the floor.

I had just blocked someone I once thought I’d marry. My phone was full of unread messages, my fridge was empty, and the only thing louder than the sirens outside was the voice in my head saying: *You messed it all up. This was supposed to be easier.*

I had begged him not to hang up. Voice cracking, half-sobbing into a pillow. I kept saying, “Just tell me what I did wrong.”

I remember gripping the heated blanket like it could keep me from falling apart. I remember feeling like I had nothing to show for all the hurting I’d done.

No peace. No plan. Just this ache, and the dull fear that maybe I’d always be chasing something, or someone, that didn’t want me back.

On the morning of my 25th birthday, I opened my eyes and felt taller - not physically, but inside.

I could *see* things differently. The people I used to cry over seemed so small, dusty. My obsessions - my need to be chosen, to be wanted, to be perfect - had the hollow taste of something I’d outgrown but hadn’t thrown away.

But even still, I couldn’t shake the quiet fear that I was *already* late. That by 30, I’d have missed my chance at something. I used to think my life would be over then - like the magic would disappear, and I’d fade into something unremarkable. But I had no idea how wrong I was.

No one told me that my brain was still forming all those years. That the part of me responsible for judgment, self-control, and long-term thinking was still wiring itself up like scaffolding around a skyscraper.

So, of course, I made choices that didn’t feel like me.

So, of course, I dated people who shrank me.

So, of course, I mistook adrenaline for love.

I wasn’t stupid. I was unfinished.

And baby, you will be too - for a while. It’s okay. That’s not shameful. That’s sacred. You're still becoming.

I don’t crave chaos anymore. I don’t need to go out on a Friday night or make impulsive decisions. I choose to rest, to listen to my body. These days, I choose rest. I listen when my body says no. I go to bed early and wake up clearer - like the fog finally lifts, and the day feels like something I can actually hold. I used to wake up dizzy from the night before. Now I wake up to Miles Davis and iced coffee. The sound of crackling music grounding me while the rest of the world sleeps. This is one of my favorite times to work and write. It’s probably my favorite part of the entire day, now that I think about it. 

I’m learning how to stop feeding the things that used to keep me up at night - texts left on read, plans that fell through, what someone *might* have meant. I used to stew over every little thing, replaying conversations like voice memos, hoping they’d say something different the second time begging them to sound different. 

Now, I breathe deeply, focus on what I can control, and let the rest float off like steam. It’s a practice. Not always easy. But I’m getting better at it.

Still, sometimes, I miss the chaos. I miss doing dumb things at 2AM, half-laughing, half-running, with people I probably shouldn’t have trusted. I miss the electricity of being reckless - of feeling wanted, even if just for a night. 

But now I see how often I treated instability like intimacy, because at least it made me feel something.  How I was the architect of my own destruction, craving fire and then crying when I got burned. 

I wonder, sometimes, if I’ll ever want to love someone forever - and what that will look like for me. Is it men? Is it women? Maybe it’s someone I haven’t met yet. Or maybe it’s someone already in my orbit, just waiting for the right version of me to see them. I don’t know. Not yet.  But I know I want it to feel like peace. Like home. Not like begging to be let in.

There’s no such thing as the “right time.” The time is always now. Every choice, even the ones I regret, has led me to this moment, and I’m learning how to hold that with grace.

When the clarity comes - and it *will* \- I want you to trust it. 

It might arrive softly, like a calm you’ve never known.

Or like a refusal that lives in your body before your mind can explain it.

That’s your brain, sweetheart. Catching up to your soul.

I know there will be days when it feels like you’re behind. Like you missed the last train to whatever happiness you were supposed to catch. But I promise you, there’s no race. You have time to be unsure, to stumble, to take detours. And when the clarity hits, it’s like you can finally breathe deeply. You’ll want better, and you’ll know you deserve better.

So no one told me. But I’ll tell you:

There’s a day - maybe not on your birthday, maybe in the middle of a grocery store - when you’ll suddenly *know better.* And then, in the most beautiful way, you’ll *want* better, too.

I used to think the pain meant I was broken.

Now I know: it just meant I was alive.

And sometimes, sweetheart, being alive is the bravest thing we do.

Since I had tons of food aversions and was throwing up a lot, the only weight I really gained during the pregnancy was from the 2 babies/2 placents all that... 

But even since I gave birth I haven't been able to exercise much. The first few months it was the constant stress of taking care of 2 newborns without any help other than my husband's. But since then I've been feeling so tired and lethargic and sore. I went to physical therapy for my pelvic ligament pain and my sciatica that the pregnancy caused and now that is better.

But I want to know if feeling exhausted and waking up like I've barely slept after getting 7+ hours of sleep consistently is normal? My body feels sore like ive been hitting the gym 2x a day (ive done that in the past and it felt the same but i was actially working out a lot and now im just taking care of the house and the babies), I still force myself to go to the gym every few days but I can only manage it if I drink a couple of coffees and I avoid that cause if I do the caffeine screws with my sleep. But I am so ready to finally get in shape. I also eat a balanced diet (I have PCOS and am careful about what I eat). I recently stopped breastfeeding which I know can have effects too... but I want to wake up and feel ready to tackle the day. 

I have made a doctor's appointment but it isn't for another week. ",2,1746496748.0,postpartumprogress,0,1.0,False

* Allergic to small talk. It's a special kind of hell. Phone calls, too. Shoot me now. I'm happy to send voice messages on occasion though. It's actually preferred when I'm in the middle of things.

* I love to read! I'm currently reading the 48 laws of power. It's completely psychotic but also fascinating; I enjoy all the history he sprinkles in with each law, as well. I have books all over the place and I'll read almost anything. My to-read pile is over 200 books and counting, because I'll probably add more tomorrow. I usually do. It's almost as tall as me (I'm 6'2"") and I affectionately call it Book Mountain(tm). Yes, it's a problem. No, I'm not stopping. Books are life. And coffee.

* I love writing code and collect old programming books, particularly ones related to games and graphics. I feel like I'm in my element when I'm creating something and watching it evolve over time, especially if it's for a retro system. There are moments when I'll stop and think just how happy I am, while feeling a sense of euphoria and belonging, which I don't really get doing anything else. I haven't done it for a while and I really miss it. I feel out of touch with an important part of me.

* I experience social anxiety and sometimes depression. I'm a big fan of exposures and not hiding from how I feel, despite the intense need to sometimes; we don't grow if we don't face ourselves. I think I'm my biggest obstacle in life purely because of some patterns I'm stuck in, but I also think I'm my best asset, purely because I recognize I can change things if I really want to. I try to be responsible for how I feel.

* I love art, Zdzislaw Beksinski and H.R. Giger are favourites. Street and ANSI art, too. Life is art.

* Big fan of 90s and 80s games. C64 anyone? If it was released in the past 10 years, I probably haven't played it. I just bought a new laptop, so I'm finally getting around to playing Fallout 4 and the 2016 version of Doom. No Man's Sky may be next.. or maybe The Witcher 3? Also fond of cozy games like Stardew Valley. 

* I'm not into manga, anime, super hero movies, comics, Disney or JavaScript. It's cool if you are though, you do you. Recommend me a manga and I'll try it when I'm feeling adventurous. Maybe :P. I did go through a kdrama period though, so there's that.

* I hike and I'm one of those people that take random photos during my day; flowers, fungi, books etc. If we hit it off, be prepared for photos :D I like sharing, it's fun. You're more than welcome to share too, though it's not expected.

* I'm a quiet idealist (and dreamer) who's usually lost in the idea of what could be, instead of being down in reality because reality sucks. I want to aim high and strive for what could be. I usually fail or when I get there it doesn't quite look how I envisioned it to be, but I have no regrets.

* I write on occasion (doesn't everyone?). Usually bad poetry, flash fiction or smut.

* Lover of clouds & sunsets, the shadows cast by leaves during the evening sun, people watching, petrichor, birds, and the euphoria of doing something I love. Summer storms are pretty great too.

Right away he started talking about a fight he had with his twin sister and he had stopped talking to her and it was something very petty. He also talked about how his mom would send him stupid tiktoks, and basically like shit talking his mom? and he was also shit talking his brother gf that lives with them. immediately made me think he’s just a woman hater lmaoo. i fear that’s on me tho because i had found his twitter and a lot of things he reposted were definitely like anti feminist vibes but i don’t know why i thought id just look past it. Basically the whole date he talked about himself and asked me questions here and there but went right back to talking about himself lol. then, he straight up started talking about his his only ex, how he expected her to come back to him and he wanted her bad but it never happened. he then also proceeded to tell me about a solo trip he took where he met a girl and she took him to a strip club but he didn’t go in cuz “he didn’t have money” so he was standing outside telling the girl he was gonna go ask the prostitutes outside how much they charged…. as a joke… now of course i now know he’s just a walking red flag, but my question is why did he do that😭 like what’s wrong with him? like if he wanted to be just friends with me why would he invite me out one on one? he also emphasized a lot that he was happy being single and he loved his freedom and peace… so did he just want to hook up? but he did not flirt at all so i’m just so confused on what his intentions were? i mean i know i could straight up ask but i also don’t wanna embarrass myself and him completely friendzone me lmao im just so confused and would like to know what everyone thinks. :)",0,1746496299.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False

I have went to the restroom a few times but the problem is still happening, so I’m assuming I’ve got a blockage or something somewhere. They recommend I take Mag Citrate. I’ve never taken it before and I’m scared. Mainly because I’ve read that it can cause nausea, but also because I’m afraid of the pain I’m going to feel. 

I took a stimulant laxative last night as a last ditch effort before I did the magnesium citrate. I woke up with the worst fucking pain and all I could do was scream on the toilet until I went and it finally subsided. I worry it will be even worse with the Mag citrate. That’s what is keeping me from doing it. I know it’s necessary, I guess I just want peoples experience.

If you feel like it and you’ve taken magnesium citrate after a severe bout of constipation, please share your experience with me, I greatly appreciate it. It can be such an isolating experience because my life revolves around the food I’m eating, how much I’m eating, and using the bathroom. It’s starting to affect me at work too due to the discomfort.

Also, I’ve tried Mirilax and stool softeners. Mirilax causes me extreme bloating and discomfort and didn’t work to relieve the issue entirely. Stool softeners only worked when used with Mirilax to kinda get things started.

If you’ve ever walked away from a conversation thinking, *“I should’ve closed that,”* this is your fix.

But I am not sure if I was justified or just being selfish,"Hello everyone. I apologize if this story will feel more like a book than a short story. But I figured that Reddit is the perfect place for me to rant and get something off my chest.

I (22 M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend, Ellaine (23 F), for 5 years now. We have been best friends since the 4th grade to the point where our classmates insisted that there must be something between us, giggling and teasing us, like the typical child we are back then. It wasn’t until high school that I confessed to her that the kids back then were right, and I was developing feelings for her. Even though I confessed my feelings to her, I was not looking forward to her reciprocating my feelings, as I know that she sees our relationship as purely platonic and no matter what she says in response to my confession, we are still friends deep down. To my surprise, she confessed her feelings back and instantly, we became known in our school as the typical high school sweethearts.

Fast forward to 3 days ago, we are both in 4th year college and are studying in separate schools. Since I finished early with my school works, I decided to visit and treat her because it’s been an exhausting week and I really wanted to be with her. It was simple, we ordered Chinese food (her favorite) and binge watched our favorite K-drama series. Eventually, Ellaine went to the bathroom for a bit and left her phone on the coffee table in front of us. All of the sudden, her phone started to ring. Expecting it to be her mother (she always check up on Ellaine to see if she’s alright), I muted the television and grabbed her phone, only to see the name “Gavin” slapping me back. 

I yelled at Ellaine who was still in the bathroom “who the hell is Gavin?” This made her panic as she stumble her way out of the bathroom as fast as a mouse running away from a cat and immediately snatched her phone from my hand. She instantly rejected the call and gave the typical “he’s my friend, but i’m not speaking to him at the moment” and sat back down. I felt suspicious, telling her that if he’s indeed just a friend, then why did she have to run from the bathroom and reject the call herself and not just tell me to reject the call myself for her. Instead of answering me directly, she began to tear up and accused me of not trusting her and that Gavin is just a friend from one of her class whom she had a disagreement with regarding their schoolwork and currently not speaking to. She followed up with “it’s my phone, so I am the one to decide who to text or call.” I didn’t want for our argument to turn into a screaming match, so I just asked if she had any feelings for him? Does he have any feelings for her? And do they talk often without my knowledge? Again, she didn’t answered my question directly and just leaned in for a kiss, where I admit, was a bit reassuring at that time. Things began to get a little wild and we proceeded to have sex in her bedroom. However, I noticed something that made my heart tremble while we were doing it. Ellaine is a very intimate person. However, this time, she seems to be just faking all of her reactions, exaggerating it too much to the point that it felt like I was in a pornographic movie rather than an intimate moment with the one I love. Eventually though, she slept.

I couldn’t get any sleep thinking about that Gavin on her phone. So I did something rather stupid or necessary. I snooped on her phone and began to check all of her messaging apps. He wasn’t on Snapchat, he wasn’t on Instagram. However, he was on the Facebook Messenger app. I was prepared for any sweet messages or any flirtatious remarks from both of them, but it seems like this year wasn’t my lucky year. Immediately after opening their messages, I was greeted with an “i love you” from Gavin to my girlfriend. Scrolling further, I stumbled upon multiple exchanges insinuating romantic interest between them. It was heart wrenching but I continued reading through what I could. There were also multiple photos and videos of them together, including sex tapes of them in Ellaine’s apartment, as well as multiple sections of conversations where they conduct said “sexy talk.” 

I started to cry, but maintained a steady demeanor as I stood up and began packing up all of my belongings. This woke Ellaine up, who proceeded to ask me why am I leaving so soon. I threw her phone in the bed, which shocked her,  and said that Gavin must miss her so much now and that I might just be a hindrance to them if I stay longer. She began apologizing profusely, sobbing along the way, which I will admit, did hurt me. Despite the dumpster truck of a revelation that I received, part of me still hopes to continue and maybe forgive Ellaine for all of the things she did. But part of me is continuously telling me that it’s pointless to hope  for a second chance and that I should just end things between us here and now. Ultimately, I gave her an ultimatum: delete everything associated with Gavin and cut contact from him both online and in real life, or I will go out of the door for good. I left her apartment not waiting for any answer as my mind was still in some sort of a blur. But as I think about how I approached the situation, I’m left wondering if it was a selfish move to give her an ultimatum or is it justified? She’s been blowing up my feed ever since I left, which I continued to ignore up until now.",1,1746495591.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,0.67,False
1kfsvul,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sagittarians/comments/1kfsvul/i_think_this_guy_is_fooling_me_not_sure/,I think this guy is fooling me. Not sure..,"I met an Aries man via Bumble some months back. Around 5 months back. I wasn't looking to play games so I swiped right on a person I thought is serious and mature. We met and our first meeting went great. Our second date however wasn't the best imo. He took me out for dinner and later we went dancing but he was trying to makeout with me and there were strict rules at the club. Plus, I was genuinely having fun dancing. I think he got mad at me for not reciprocating while he made moves or maybe because I asked if we could stay late since I was really enjoying. While leaving he called an uber and left even before my uber arrived. I was stranded in front of the club with a bunch of strangers but I was fine because the security guards were helpful. I thought we might never meet again and pulled back. I felt crushed honestly, cried a little and decided to move on. Kept my options open but only talked to one other guy. Just when I did that, 2 days later he was texting me like nothing ever went wrong and he was being extremely nice and sweet. I was wondering if I was too quick to judge. We continued to meet a couple of times. He would plan coffee dates, we would meet, talk and that was it. 

Around December he went on his yearly vacation to meet his family and he used to call me, text me daily. I wanted to like him because I felt like he was doing a lot of things a typical bf would do. But something kept holding me back. I thought it might be my trauma response, so decided to remain patient. Once he was back we still met, and I used to see someone calling him on his phone..  which he would disconnect instantly. This happened even before he went on his vacation. Once. When be came back, it happened again. I felt it was very weird but I didn't know if I should ask. I saw the beginning of her name though. Some weeks passed and I happened to look up his social media. Actually, he never added me on his instagram. Idk why. Initially I thought it's because... what if we don't get along and then simply end up blocking each other one day. I even asked him once to show me his instagram jokingly but he never did. When I saw his social media, I found out that he went on a staycation with his ex gf while we went on his vacation in December. They had very intimate moments and I was pretty shocked seeing that. He literally called me those days, shared images from the staycation and said he was with his ex colleagues. I knew he was in touch with his ex gf but I'm wondering if they are actually doing LDR. Oh btw, it was the same female who was calling him on his phone. 

Few days back, I gently asked him if he was still in touch with his ex and he said ""no, I have other priorities especially when I travel back home"". He plain lied. I just don't know why he did this. Perhaps they are still going strong and he's cheating? I don't understand his intentions with me. He messages me every single day, calls me, plans dates etc. Every time I have pulled back he has made more effort as if he was serious with me. He always made it look like he was into something serious and meaningful with me. I genuinely thought that i should consider a future with him. Honestly, no matter how much I tried I had this strange gut feeling but i blamed myself for overthinking and just creating issues when there were none. I think now it makes sense. Your intui is your super power, ladies. 

So whhat do you think of Aries men and this situation I'm  in?

1kfsts6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1kfsts6/did_my_fiancés_mother_put_a_curse_on_me/,Did my fiancé’s mother put a curse on me?,"Before you read this, I’m aware that this could be a coincidence, and that this could be completely crazy. That’s why I’m asking here. Buckle up, it’s a long one.

A couple weeks before Christmas of 2023, I met my fiancé’s mother for the first time. While the meeting was short, she decided she did not like me, and felt the need to tell my fiancé that as soon as the evening was over.

A few weeks later, at about 2:00 AM on December 31st, I was in a car accident that almost ended my life. I was on the way home from work, and a guy blew a red trying to rush his girlfriend to the hospital after stabbing her in the neck during a meth binge. 

I was knocked out by the impact, and woke up to see a hand with a reverse pentacle tattooed on the backside reaching into my car to try to open the passenger side door. I looked up and saw a woman who was covered in blood, who upon noticing that I was waking up, started screaming through the broken window, “You motherfucker! You killed my baby!” She would continue screaming this until the police arrived. 

It is also important to note that I was on the phone with my fiancé at the time of the impact, although the phone ended up hanging itself up with the car being totaled. 

I was put into the hospital, and released the next morning. We would ultimately find that the only lasting wound was a traumatic brain injury (TBI), and my ears rang for about a month and a half afterwards. It took months for me to start feeling “normal” again, and I still have depressive symptoms from the TBI.

Then, over the past year and a few months, my fiancé started sprinkling in context that now have me asking this question.

To start, let’s talk about her mother. Her mother is a descendant of slaves from a small town outside of New Orleans. She’s only three generations removed to my knowledge. Most of her family still lives on the same street the plantation was on. Many of her family members are also descendants of the owner of said plantation- the implications of that are pretty clear to my fiancé and I, unfortunately.

Members of this family were also known to practice voodoo fairly openly. Her mother, while never admitting to being a practitioner herself, even has a mild obsession with the occult, but would never discuss it with my fiancé. She still refuses to, even with my fiancé being a grown adult now. 

She is also a relatively unstable person. She was physically abusive to my fiancé as a child, going so far as to break her nose at one point in her childhood. Her reason for doing so was because she “heard demons speaking through her daughter”. She drove my fiancé’s father out of the home with actions like these, who now lives states away but still pays for the house, cars, utilities, etc.

Immediately following the phone hanging up, she apparently entered my fiancé’s room (bearing in mind this is 2:00 AM) just to ask how I was doing. When my very flustered fiancé told her she believed I was just in a car accident, she told her how unfortunate that was, that she would be praying for her (not me), and left the room.

But that’s enough on her for now. 

Another important piece of context is that I am white-passing. I’m not actually white, but I might as well be if you didn’t know my genetic makeup. This was one of the reasons her mother listed for not liking me. She basically told her that white people have only been evil to their family for as long as they can remember, and I am no exception. She also had other family members call my fiancé later down the line when we moved in together to reiterate that. 

A final, very important piece of context is that since that accident, whether it’s on a t-shirt, a piece of jewelry, or in a piece of media, the sight of specifically a reverse pentacle (not to be confused with a regular pentagram) makes my ears ring severely. If you’ll remember, the hand tattoo of a reverse pentacle was the first thing I saw when I woke up from the accident.

There’s a coffee shop where I work, and one of the workers regularly wears a reverse pentacle necklace. If I see him working through the window, I just skip the coffee. The ringing isn’t worth the coffee.

I don’t know if this is some kind of subconscious stress response, but I feel nothing emotionally when I see it or anything- to me it’s just a symbol. But the ringing is awful. It’s hard to stand. 

So, with all of this being said, I’m asking: what is the likelihood my fiancé’s mother put a curse on me? It’s hard to catch the vibes without being there for all of this stuff, and I tried to convey them the best I could, but the air around all of this feels funny.

Any input here is appreciated. Thank you in advance.

Stay safe out there.

1kfstpw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kfstpw,"19yo. I took the GED today on 5 hours of sleep, studying on the last possible day.","Hey folks, been lurking around this community for a year or so. I scheduled my GED a month ago after putting it off for a year, studied allll day on Sunday and took all four tests today. Here's how I put it all together.

I cannot recommend more highly the following resources:  
ALL:  
[https://www.reddit.com/user/labvfff/comments/1gxu6g7/list\_of\_ged\_advice\_posts\_in\_my\_profile/lymm6st/](https://www.reddit.com/user/labvfff/comments/1gxu6g7/list_of_ged_advice_posts_in_my_profile/lymm6st/) (I read through everything posted here, though I didn't necessairily follow all the advice due to lack of time)  
[Libgen.is](http://Libgen.is) or similar websites that you may accidentally stumble on hasplenty of free ged prep books with practice science exams, very useful for seeing where the gaps in your knowledge are.  

BONUS: This video by easy actually on how to study for tests: highly recommend as the advice is grounded in reality. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkQsafoUPBk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkQsafoUPBk)

MATH:   
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOLMfFuH7d4&list=PL0o\_zxa4K1BUTwjC6quGDfAB7HHNt\_cPr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOLMfFuH7d4&list=PL0o_zxa4K1BUTwjC6quGDfAB7HHNt_cPr)  
If you can only watch one video for math, it should probably be the GED Math Test Prep. You can play it at 2x speed, but make sure to pause and attempt each problem. You'll learn a lot, and any topic you're unfamiliar with has a longer video within the GED playlist.

RLA:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEcyu3JzTPA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEcyu3JzTPA) Very useful video on properly writing the RLA essay.   
  
[https://natureofwriting.com/courses](https://natureofwriting.com/courses) Good grammar resource. I think it was worth the price at the time, but you may be able to get by with free resources or practice exams alone. 

[readtheory.org](http://readtheory.org) If I spent more time here, I probably could've gotten the credit. But I really don't read recreationally, and didn't take any practice tests, that was my fault. Don't procrastinate as much as I did. 

Science:  
  
[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEik-U3T6u6JA0XiHLbNbOw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEik-U3T6u6JA0XiHLbNbOw) Bozeman Science is excellent for learning biology if you want to go the extra mile. (punnett squares, pedigrees, and natural selection seem to show up on the test). 

I was able to pass this test without any knowledge of physics/earth science beyond the DK encyclopedia that I read in middle school. 





**Background:**  
I dropped out of school in 2nd grade and remained homeschooled until 11th grade. I dropped out at the end of the year after being hospitalized for type 1 bipolar disease. 

After discharge I became a NEET and moved away for a year, during which I studied 0% of my Kaplan GED book, read little, and basically scrolled social media all day while letting the last bit of highschool knowledge leak out from my brain.  


I hated the feeling of being ""a dropout"", and always said I'd study as soon as I came home. I never did, always choosing quick dopamine instead. I related strongly to [this picture](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F5xok15agt7xe1.png), ""I'll get my GED some day"" and ""this is the day I'm gonna turn things around"" hit me hard in the gut.

If anyone reading this feels like that same self-loathing man of inaction, my advice is to do the impossible: Jump in head-first. I personally went onto [ged.com](http://ged.com), found the first available date and nearest testing center, and paid for all the subjects on the same day. 

  
**Math experience:**  
I only answered 31/40 questions for math because...I needed to use the restroom. Avoid drinking coffee (a diueretic) and **EXCESSIVE WATER** ""for focus"" because...you'll void your remaining test time. I'd have told my past self to wear an adult diaper to the testing center, but I scraped by. 

Material on the test: Word problems, arithmetic, a lot of algebra, one combination problem, tons of graphing problems (including perpendicular/parallel slopes, be sure to study those), plug in values of X and Y, overall not so bad if you have experience with the problems, nothing will take you by surprise.

Study advice:  
\- Do the test \*fast\*. Watch people actually take the test on youtube. You can easily have enough time to do the test \*twice\* (if you don't need a bathroom break like me). 

\- If you have extra time, take practice tests. Research shows practice tests/past papers reallly improve test performance.

**For Social Studies, RLA, and Science**, I didn't study them personally. Try to eliminate 3 wrong answers when you pass through a second time, that seemed to work for me. [Readtheory.org](http://Readtheory.org) I'm postive is effective, so study that every day and review your wrong answers. If you're super awesome, take practice tests.   
  
  
**General tips:** healthy breakfast, sleep well (I didnt do it, but I imagine it'd help), bathroom break before every test, bring 3 kind bars and a bottle of water, practice deep breathing, pose like superman in front of the mirror for 30 seconds, all seemed to help slightly.

I would be against splitting our week this way but my boyfriend isn't as interested in the city and seeing Mauna Loa is big for us! We want to explore more of Hawaii- super interested in seeing the nature while we're there. That being said, we'd like to get some opinions on the following things:

\-Best weekend bars/ night life

\-Beaches with preferably mid-low tourism (not a big deal)

\-How best to visit Mauna Loa/Kea (however we can see Loa the best)

\-Must-do activities on the Big Island

\-Lodging (Best areas? Worst areas? We don't mind being in touristy areas, just somewhere with accessibility to shops, food, things to do. Preferably cheap lol!)

\-Rental car necessary on Oahu?

\-Any apps/services that you would recommend for traveling/sight seeing?

As you can see, not a long list of activities so far, but we aren't there for a long time. What would you recommend for each of these things and I guess ***more importantly what would you recommend we stay away from?*** Even though I've been twice, I was with family and spent a lot of time near MCBH.

One month and week ago my coworker (F27) broke up with me (M31) an almost four months relationship, and oh man I've never cried so much for someone, and I had longer relationships than this one, but it's the first time I got the boot.   
  
We work in a very small office, she sits in on one corner and I sit in the other so is really easy to glimpse on each other. I've to see her everyday, to still hear her voice, to walk the same streets were we holded, hugged and kissed. To see the shops and the coffees we visited. To see the bench where she kicked me and I cried alone. Makes me just miss and grief her more.  
  
I think the things that makes me feel so much is that I felt secure with her, I felt we could talk things, but I guess that was self told lie. And the fact that **I still have to see her every fuckin day of the week**. And now I can't stop thinking about the past, please let me share some context on how it came to be:   
We used to glimpse each other at work and make funny and flirty faces, chat the whole day, and after work we would walk and kiss all afternoon until night and then we had to separate our ways since I live far away from work and she used to live in a place were men were not allowed... I still remember our 3 months celebration going together to a museum and laughing at the weird stuff, then looking for a place to eat, feeling poor for seeing the prices of the dishes and dreaming about a future where we can afford it and overall being really happy on how these last three months have passed so fast.   
And now, now there is only mute treatment, she won't even gaze me, and I miss her so much. She decided to end things because her words ""I can't give you what you need"" after I asked her if we could pass more time together in a past argument where she said she barely had time (referring to work and classes every Wednesday). And I asked this because she's supposedly doing a working holiday in June, and I remark supposedly since she was having troubles to find a flight close to our break up. After a week, I send her a message for her birthday but she just ignored it. Then back at work I couldn't take the mute treatment anymore and I approached her on the elevator.   
We had a very rough discussion where she yelled to me that I always broke her limits (to this very day this still founds me odd I always respected her times) and she always yelled to me. I told her that she's always so patient with people that treats her like shit and that I felt abused and used by her. I blocked her from every social media and haven't sent her a message since then.  
She also hated the fact that that we had not a secure place to lay, since I live far and with my mother she never felt good coming here... even when most in our circle lives with their relatives because home/rent is expensive and payment is not that high... But even so I always payed for hotel rooms.

The days when we were together passed so fast, now **everyday is a slug**.

And deep inside me I know she's not worth it, she didn't care about my needs, she used to yell, has bad habits, suddenly would burst in rage, she's hasty to make decisions, and she never truly loved me the same way I did. AND I STILL MISS HER! I miss her hugs, smelling her hair and going out to places together, watch movies and share music. Sinners just came out, everybody is talking about it but I don't feel like watching it since she wanted us both to watch it together. And the worst is that she removed her braces and she looks so pretty and I probably look like a creep now, barely with a will to live. And now I'm faced by her worst side, and I don't know what I did to deserve her hate. Everyday is painful now at work, I've to travel 1 hour everyday in an overcrowded subway to do a meaningless job, in a tiny office where I go out at lunch time alone to eat alone every day so I don't have to see her at the other corner, just talking and being like nothing ever happened. 

I just wrote and send my resign letter. Some of my friends told me I should bite the bullet and deal with it since finding a job is hard these days but I just can't deal with the grief of being there with her. I'm resigning the first of June, and I hope I can truly heal because the pain I'm feeling is huge, is very huge and I wrote this crying again. I'm also seeing a professional but he's only given me pills for sleeping, which haven't actually worked, my anxiety always wins. 

I don't know if I've asperger or something, why I'm so overly focus on her even if I do my job and try to focus on it. It's been a month already and people has told me ""it was that long man u're taking it too bad"" but god damn it hurts, and still dreaming with the day she might talk to me again.  
  
I really appreciate with the warmest of thanks I can give to anyone who took his/her time to read my story. I really feel I'm in one of the lowest times of my life and that I'm actually losing my self. The loneliest is hitting me hard, I really want to heal and remove her from my life I really do! but I know I only have to survive May.

1kfsoo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/weyler/comments/1kfsoo8/upcoming_weyler_scenes_based_on_claricehannibal/,Upcoming Weyler scenes based on Clarice&Hannibal interactions,"Since they revealed one of the scenes between Tyler and Wednesday will have The Silence Of The Lambs undertones, I have some 'possible-Weyler-scenes-that-might-happen' file in my mind. This can take long, so i will go step by step. 

1. I think one of the scenes between Wednesday and Tyler will be tied up with Wednesday's visions. When we look at season 1, her visions pretty much always came when she was with Tyler. Some might say it was because her senses were trying to warn her about him, but we also know they are triggered by emotions. 

There is a scene where Clarice gives Dr Lecter the police files she was working on, and he takes them, but he also touches her finger. It was so subtle yet intentional, it gave me the chills when I first saw the movie. I imagine Weyler sharing a scene like that, and the first thing that comes to my mind is how Wednesday would be affected by that touch, and this would trigger her visions. Only this time, Tyler wouldn't be able to catch her since he would be chained up or behind bars(what a missed oppurtunity...)

2. This point is more about how they would behave when they are near each other. If they are so adamant to follow The Silence Of The Lambs theme, I can't help but think about the banter between Clarice&Lecter. Lecter constantly played with her like this was some sort of cat and mouse duet, and he was always witty and cheerful-in a psychotic way, obviously(think about Tyler's smile from the trailer). The notorious psychiatrist that Lecter is, he unraveled Clarice's psyche pretty quickly by turning this into a Quid Pro Quo. 

Meanwhile Clarice was always on edge(I know Wednesday and being 'on edge' does not sound right, but she literally gulps in the trailer when Hyde run towards her, and in the first promo scene, she looked kinda wary to me when she looked at Tyler -but i might be overanalyzing this), but she also challanged Lecter with her bluffs and remarks. This alone intrigued Lecter, so much so that he gave the right clues to her while misdirecting other fbi agents lol. I am pretty sure Hyde would like to drag Wednesday around with a similar mannerism, and he would have the audacity to think this as a gift-just like Lecter.

3. ""Closer. Closer please!"" scene. I had written a post about this earlier and explained how it might be connected with Hunter's comment, so i'll just share the link.
(https://www.reddit.com/r/weyler/comments/1kb3kin/hunters_comment/)

4. If Wednesday visits Tyler more than 2 times, I assume Tyler would ask what does he owe the pleasure, or why did she come to him again, and Wednesday-being the self assured/independent queen that she is-would quote Clarice and say ""I came because I wanted to."" And I can imagine Tyler quoting Lecter's infamous line ""People will say we're in love."" The chokehold would be insane. 

5. The last interaction is kinda unlikely to happen, but it is fun to imagine the parallels between Weyler and Clarice&Lecter. There is a scene where we see Clarice's  hand-drawn portrait on Lecter's desk. Since Faulkner described Hydes as ""Artists by nature but equally vindictive in temperament"", I keep thinking about what would Tyler's artistic abilities be. We know he is a good barista, he makes birthday cakes(98 percent dark chocolate ganage, we'll never forget you) and coffee arts(drawings? Sorry i don't know the exact name, though it is a bit irrelevant cause he said he worked on that for all week😭). If his talent is tied up with his paintings/drawings, what if he draws her in his jail time just like Lecter? Even i myself cannot imagine this happening, but it would seal the deal for us to understand Tyler's feelings for her. But sadly i don't think they would even provide paper&pencil for him.

I was recently reflecting on how I got some penpal friends from here during the onset of the pandemic and how much I enjoyed the contact and the time dedicated to writing out letters for someone. It kind of fizzled out over the years as times changed and I got busy but I really enjoyed it and would love to chit chat and make new connections again.

I’m a recently graduated nurse of about a year ago and have been employed at a hospital for about six months. I’ve got a lot of interests but I like to consider myself a fairly laid back and cozy person and love my creature comforts like morning coffee, tasty breakfast, casual video gaming, knick knacks for my shelves, board games (mostly single player), and reading which is a large hobby of mine. Movies are also a big interest of mine; I mostly lean on horror with reading and watching but I’ll look into anything that gets my interest.

I’m also a lifelong Star Wars fan and I love the whole saga including the spinoffs and extended media though I’m not stuck up about people who aren’t into it/haven’t seen it.

I’m definitely a people person and would love to meet some folks whether it’s here in the USA or international. Or if you want to just exchange a postcard for a quick hello I think that’s cool too!

I don't have mommy issues I think but when she gives me life advice I can't help but swoon over her beautiful blue eyes. Whenever she goes out to get coffee she always asks if I want something. I know she'll never go for because of our age difference and the fact that she's always telling me I'm just a baby but I just love admiring her.

I will say. I have not had a girlfriend since I was 24 for whatever reason so maybe this is me just being down bad but if she ever quits I don't think I can go back to work happy again. ",12,1746494831.0,redscarepod,11,0.72,False

I last attended church during lent and Pascha of 2019. We actually visited another church 20 minutes south of where we live during that time to see if we could vibe with a Greek church that had a reputation for being slightly more progressive, but we ended up exiting all together. About five months later our former priest emailed me to check in and to see about getting together (we never ended up meeting again). Below was my response (posting if it might be helpful/insightful to anyone here). For context, my family was fairly immersed in an Antiochian parish for just under 5 years (after a period of inquiry and catechesis my family was baptized in 11/2015).

Hi Fr. David,

Thanks for checking in. It’s nice to hear from you.

We haven’t been attending church in any fashion since Pascha. I suspect you may disagree with my feelings on the matter, but it feels really good and healthy for numerous reasons. In short, I concluded that my two main reasons for going to church at all were rooted in either fear or obligation (sometimes both). I concluded that these were NOT good or compelling reasons for me to continue attending. I actually think I tried to hold on for a while, but ultimately just couldn’t while being true to myself and caring for my mental health.  And when I examined and stripped away fear and obligation, there simply wasn’t much left for me. Over time, the weight of any authority, system, or structure has lost its grip on me. It feels very free right now.

Within a modern E.O. framework, I’ve heard and read enough to know that someone like me can be discarded or dismissed as being “too influenced by secularism.” I’m by no means implying or suggesting that you are doing or have ever done this, but I need to be clear in saying that I never felt much of a belonging, or that I really “fit.” Quite frankly, a lot of my values are simply different, and I refuse to violate my conscience (I already did a fair bit of that as a protestant). I also don’t feel as though my deep and painful protestant wounds were ever really touched, and as I have entered into the second half of life, I’m simply not that interested in going through the motions or faking it until I make it.

I think fondly and affectionately of you and your family. I’d be open to coffee or further discussion if it would be of benefit to you…   ",12,1746494754.0,exorthodox,4,0.94,False

So In Jan 2022 I walk into my Dr. office it’s my annual visit, I have list of questions stuff I wanted to talk about. I go thru my list and provider than says to me. “Oh your levels are perfect” I said oh ok. 

Than the provider says “Oh it must been so hard you with little baby all by yourself I was a single mom that kid is now 42 at the time. Then Dr. Crazypants gets a mean look on her face I’m now standing up cause wtf is happening here. 

Then the providers is now cornering me she is close, she holding up her hand staring at her palm. Then says so what am I supposed to do just stare at the wall as she making a face at her hand🖐️. 

I realize she talking about my oldest daughter father. 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯A person I have not seen since football camp when my son was 16 he’s 32 now. I was dropping my son off when I saw him on the quad. 

It was weird in a good way his kid was the quarterback. My kid the running back. So they were playing together we talked about kids & football I said goodbye jumped Dodge quad cab drove 1.5 hr drive  home. 

We are from the same small town.

The Dr. Crazypants says Oh sometimes he does make me breakfast!😳 wtaf

I’m in shock! I had NO words, My brain is screaming….

1st thought RUN FORREST 🏃🏼🏃🏼🏃🏼🏃🏼🏃🏼🏃🏻‍♀️

2nd This CRAZY 🤬has access to my everything revoke everything now now😱

3rd write everything down that comes out Dr.Crazypants mouth. Make appointment with head of psychiatry at this hospital about Dr. Crazypants & Forrest find another provider.

Since then Dr.CraCra has been stalking me…
I used to swim at local HS pool I always take 1st lane,  I look up and Dr. Crazypants & friends are in shallow end staring at me & talking some major shit talk with her Dr. friends 3 lanes away. 

Where I live has wall around the property, I open my gate to back out my car and Dr. CraCra is parked on side walk on electronics of some kind wtf!
One day I walked out into my yard and there is so many hypodermic needles, a neighbor and I were picking them up with shovels. 
I went to the farmers market with my 19 yr granddaughter where Dr.Crazypants wanted to get into a staring contest, I stared back I am one of 13 kids there’s no way she winning this, she walked off. 

The kicker my dad passed away in April 2023 one of my sisters met me in Las Vegas & we both flew out to OH for the funeral. On the way back it was early in the morning I complained to my sister at gate about no place being open to get coffee. I look down concorse & John Glenn airport & who is coming towards me none other than Dr. Crazypants she see me & knows I have seen her, she immediately does a 180 and literally runs away lol🤣😂& she was fast too! It was hilarious…

Forrest’s sister sit with me & my sister  I’m on the window seat my sister in the middle, the Waspy wannabe is near the isle.  

Which is amazing cause this Waspy wannabe every single time she’d see me walking on same sidewalk at home she’d cross the street. 

Could be raining, sunny, blizzard it didn’t matter yet now she wants to sit with me & my sister.
 
Getting info for insecure Dr. CraCra thinking I didn’t know who she was. Ya bitch I know exactly who you are, ok I’ll play pretend too. 

I eventually got a new provider who sent me to a specialist have all these issues only to find that specialist calling me at 8:30pm to ask.
1. How long have you been on this meds
2. Who prescribed it. 
All issues your having is due to undetectable thyroid medication.  

My thyroid was taken out in 1996 & 1998 in hospital on East coast. Dr CraCra she put me hypothyroidism to get fat on purpose. 

It put a whole other spin on her running away!😳
 
I talked with medical malpractice attorneys but most had some affiliation with her employer a teaching hospital only one in this state. 

I have changed providers, I had been advised to change my insurance and tell them why I did. So she could not have any access. 

As early as December 2024 was bring a grandkid home from the hospital, I had just passed the state line into my state, when a high end minivan Mercedes or something of that caliber.  

The car was dirty as all hell like the person went mudding. She driving fast from behind me gets in fast lane I’m in middle lane it Dr. CraCra mean mugging & matching my speed till she speeds off wildly wtaf!

At this point I just want to get healthy, I finally found a provider that looks like me & not part of the system Dr.CraCra is in. I’ve contacted the state medical board & just the fact other providers are trying to fix the problem, other people know. 
I was on 60 mg thyroid meds for 3+ years, before moving to this state 125 mg. Biggest thing is people know what she did & for me that helps.
I was advised to carry camera so I catch her in a picture & can get stay away order. 
My question is wtaf is FORREST doing? Is he still 🤬running, what did he say to Dr. Crazypants to have her following like a 🤬blood hound? Was he talking in sleep, what would make someone soo friggin crazy & what is up with his sister the Waspy Wannabe helping what’s the 🤬is that all about?",1,1746494654.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

I (late 20s M) recently cut ties with a friend — I’ll call him George — and I’m starting to question whether I handled it the right way, or if I’m being too sensitive.

George and I met through my university’s library and got along quickly. I eventually opened up to him about some really personal stuff — childhood bullying, family issues, and mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts. At the time, I felt I could trust him.

Things shifted when he brought me to his church group. I liked it at first, but then he and his brother started pushing political conversations — mostly pro-Trump stuff — even after I told them I wasn’t comfortable discussing politics. George kept pressing me, asking if my views were just “inherited from my dad,” and wouldn’t drop it even when I said I didn’t want to talk about it.

I told him his behavior was making me uncomfortable and that I wanted an apology. Instead of addressing it, he refused to apologize over text and told me the friendship was basically over unless we met in person. I still agreed to meet and even bought him a coffee, hoping to smooth things over. Instead of apologizing, he told me I had low self-esteem, that I was dragging him down to my level, and that I was “sounding like the devil.” He also tried to pray over me, which I declined. I left feeling belittled and humiliated, so I walked away and ended the friendship.

Since then, I’ve distanced myself from the church group and anyone connected to him. But here’s where it gets more uncomfortable: I saw him at the library yesterday. When I got up from my seat, I noticed he was sitting two rows ahead of me, with his back to me. Later, after I came back from getting a drink of water, I saw that he’d moved a couple rows forward — this time directly facing me. It felt really unsettling.

His brother also randomly removed me on Social Media, and George has been acting like nothing happened — giving me fist bumps and being overly friendly in public. A couple of his friends have reached out, but I haven’t said much — just that I’ve been busy.

Now I’m anxious that he might be sharing the personal things I confided in him, especially the mental health stuff, and trying to make me look unstable or dramatic. I feel like I’ve lost control of the narrative, and it’s really messing with my head.

1kfsihi,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kfsihi/am_i_being_too_critical_of_my_husband_30f_31m/,Am I being too critical of my husband? (30F 31M),"We’ve been married for a few years now. We’ve done everything. Books, Gottman research, weekly therapy, even an intensive weekend Gottman counseling retreat. And still, something in me has shifted. After a conflict in December, it was like a switch flipped. I started seeing him differently. I stopped feeling close. And I haven’t been able to force myself to go back. 

He has for years, baselessly accused me of cheating. I work in a male dominated field and he becomes very suspicious if I’m even a little late coming home. It has eroded something in me that is hard to explain. He is anxious about everything surrounding me and our relationship. He keeps telling me he’s just “waiting on the other shoe to drop.” 

I know marriage takes work. I’m not afraid of effort. I’m someone who gets up at 4am to train for marathons. I bake bread from scratch. I play the long game in almost every area of life. So I stayed. I really tried. I read the books cover to cover, I supported him on his journey through therapy. But now I’m realizing, marriage doesn’t just require work. It requires friendship. And I don’t think we have that anymore. 

We don’t feel like friends. There’s no ease between us. No play. He often feels morally superior, yet incredibly anxious. That mix has made it feel hard to be myself around him. I feel as though every time I express my needs he feels attacked, because me asking for things in our marriage equates to him being the bad guy. As a result, not much changes. 

He says things like “you don’t love me, cherish me, or dote on me the way wives should.” I write him notes and poems about why I love him. I’m not a prude about sex. I brought him a cup of coffee to wake up to, every morning until about a month ago. I try to do the big and little things to keep us afloat. I have expressed over and over how hurtful it is to hear my love isn’t enough for him. He tells me it’s the best thing he’s ever felt and that he loves me more than anyone in the world, and that no one will ever love me more than him. I don’t feel his love. I haven’t felt admired by him. 

There have been some difficult moments. In one instance, at a concert, he got so drunk he blacked out and threw a beer can at me in front of our friends and berated me, telling me he hates me and that I should just fuck off. A few weeks ago, when I tried to talk about separating, he broke things in the house, smashed photos, screamed at me. It’s not always like that, but when it is, it’s terrifying. I tell him after the fact and he says he’s just expressing his anger. He would never hurt me. He’s since said he’s in recovery and wants to change. I’m not sure if he can tell me what he’s in recovery from. He went on a bachelor trip this weekend and drank. 

The part I keep coming back to: I don’t know how to overcome this contempt. I don’t even think I like him anymore. When I sit with the real version of him, not the idea of him, I feel tense, guarded, and very small. I don’t want to feel this way. I find it very hard to feel comfortable around him. I feel like my skin is going to burst open. 

When I was training, he told me I was using it as an excuse to get away from him, or that I had eyes for other, fitter men. He kept me up until the early hours of the morning night before my race because he was spiraling about me not wanting him to come to the start line, as there were 50,000 people trying to get to the same place and I didn’t want him to get overwhelmed. I wanted to advance my education and he told me he doesn’t feel obligated to follow me on my “heroes journey”. And he thinks all my friends are pieces of shit, so as a result, he and our dog are about the only friends I have.  

I don’t want to live the rest of my life in a house built on performance, guilt, and fear. I used to feel so confident in myself. This past weekend he’s been away has been so wonderful. I felt so free. My friends who see us interact tell me I should just leave, but that feels like the easy way out. I understand how much work marriage takes. I took us to therapy after he humiliated me in public the first time. I have been in therapy myself to work on my shortcomings, but I’m worried I’m making him this way by not just… opening up more, surrendering. I want friendship. I want peace. I want to feel like myself again. Has anyone been here before?",1,1746494434.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

1kfsg35,https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/1kfsg35/i_just_conquered_cissp/,I just conquered CISSP,"I passed my the CISSP today @103 questions with 45 minutes left. FIRST TRY

I am a transitioning active duty military personnel and I have been working this job for about 6years. I first got into IT as a student 2015, and I got my Associates Degree in Computer Network Administration with Emphasis in Cisco Routers and Switches in 2017 and my Network+ in 2018. I worked IT for few months and went to join the military. Before IT and the military, I have my Bachelor’s in Building Construction. When it got done on me that I will be transitioning from the military, I went back to school to get my Master’s in Cybersecurity, and I graduated November 2024. In between my master’s program, I got my Sec+ in August 2024 and CASP+ in December 2024.

After my CASP+ in December, I said to myself CISSP is next. I started my CISSP journey officially in January 2025. From January till date, is been nonstop studying. My wife got tired of my style of studying because this is the only thing i have known this year. She was supportive words and prayers. I was to travel to Nigeria to see family in April this year after over 9years of not seeing them, but couldn’t because of my CISSP as I refused to take a break from studying before taking the test. 

Today I finally went to take the test and I passed at 103Q with 45minutes left. Last week I took leave from work to round up my study. I joined my study with 3days fasting as I also want God’s intervention in my journey. 

It is true there is no study material that match the CISSP. All most all questions were from the textbook but framed in a very different way. I used the OSG (textbook and practice test), Dest  CISSP, QE, pocket prep, boson, thorteaches video from Udemy and Jason Dion practice test from Udemy. Non of these materials was like the exam. 

I must not forget to say your score from practice test is no guarantee you will pass the test. I took 900 questions QE test. My score was 44, 64, 63, 53, 54, 50 and the last was 79. Pocket prep was 80% ready. Boson was 80% in average, Thorteaches hard questions was  57 and Jason Dion was 75. In all, my score per domain was fluctuating and this was my greatest concern before the test. 

I my opinion the test isn’t that bad if you study. I watched Kelly handerham’s video “why you pass the CISSP”, 50 CISSP PRACTICE QUESTIONS FROM YOUTUBE and a little of Coffee shop from Prabh Nair from YouTube also and Bettwy Gwen you tube video “how to think like a manager”

My advice is, put in the work, pray to God and go take the test. You won’t know how much knowledge you have until you sit for the test. Why the test isn’t a monster, I strongly advice you put in the work. My questions were very technical and I didn’t have to use the whole think like a manger stuff.

YOU WILL PASS THE TEST IF YOU ACTUALLY STUDY. IT IS NOT THAT BAD.

1kfsfwy,https://www.dailymicrofiction.com/p/trauma,Trauma,"The low thrumming wasn't just in the water anymore; it felt like it resonated deep in Aris Thorne’s teeth. Outside her Sausalito lab window, the San Francisco Bay churned grey under a low sky, punctuated by the impossible sight of humpback spouts against the girders of the Golden Gate. They weren’t just passing; they were here, circling, their ancient songs dense and layered, aimed squarely at the shoreside sprawl of humanity.


Inside, the lab buzzed with a different energy – the low whine of servers, the clicking of keyboards, the smell of ozone and stale coffee. Aris rubbed her gritty eyes, pushing aside a holo-display showing nineteenth-century whaling statistics she’d morbidly pulled up hours ago. Flensing tools. Try-pots. Barrels rendered. Her focus snapped back to the main screen: the Cetacean Harmonic Interlocutor – CHI – was finally achieving stable semantic coherence. Years poured into this AI, this potential bridge across the species gulf.

""We have consistent structure, Dr. Thorne,"" Jian Li whispered, awe warring with tension in his voice. ""Look.""

Fragments flickered, coalescing from the hydrophone feed’s intricate sonic tapestry: Translation (76%): Query: Other Mind. Hard Surface Echo. Translation (80%): Inquiry: Intent? Why Listen Now? Then, a fleeting, lower-confidence fragment that made Aris’s breath catch: Translation (65%): Ghost Echo: Sharp Pain. Fear Scent.

Dismissing it as algorithmic noise felt too easy. She pushed the unease down, typing the first, universe-altering message: We are Human. We Listen. We Seek Understanding.

The dialogue that unfolded over days was staggering, mediated by CHI's translations – stilted, lacking nuance perhaps, yet undeniably communication. Roric, the dominant singer (SFHB-07), spoke of a world perceived in sound, pressure, magnetic lines. He asked about the incessant engine-hum that filled their world, the strange, hard objects humans built. Aris felt the weight of representing her species, choosing words carefully, simplifying concepts across an unimaginable experiential divide. Yet, sometimes, amid queries about currents or ship noise, CHI would flag a recurring, dissonant undertone in the songs: Low Probability Tag: Historical Distress Signature. Aris found herself glancing back at the whaling statistics more often than she liked.

""Are we sure, Jian,"" she murmured one afternoon, watching the complex swirls of Roric's song translated into linguistic maps, ""that we're getting the weight? Not just the words?""

Jian shrugged, eyes glued to the data flow. ""The semantic correlations are unprecedentedly high, Doctor. The context tracks. But meaning… true meaning? That's above my pay grade. And maybe CHI's.""

The question, when Roric finally posed it directly, felt less like an inquiry and more like the breaking of a dam. The usual melodies ceased. A new song began, heavy, resonant with harmonics that made the lab's windows hum, harmonics CHI struggled to process, labeling them Extreme Sorrow/Trauma Recall.

Translation (93%): Memory Burns. Passed Through Songlines. The Great Hunt. The translated words appeared starkly. Sharp Metal From Human Floating Islands. Air Stolen. Kin Lost in Red Water. Why? Your Ancestors… Why This Need?

The lab fell utterly silent. Aris stared at the screen, the grainy black-and-white images from her earlier search flashing behind her eyes. The casual brutality of it. The sheer scale. She initiated the secure link, the faces of historians and ethicists appearing, grim. Arguments flickered – about phrasing, context, admitting the scale.

""Just tell them,"" Aris finally cut in, her voice strained. ""The raw, ugly truth."" She remembered the diagrams of whale oil lamps illuminating Victorian streets. She typed, fingers leaden, the official explanation: Our ancestors lived in cold and darkness. They did not understand you. They rendered your bodies for oil, for light, for machines. A time of profound ignorance. A deep wrong. She hesitated, then added the carefully rehearsed, inadequate words: We stopped. We understand differently now. We offer apology for the pain.

The transmission light blinked. The hydrophones surged with sound – not Roric's voice, but the entire pod, a chaotic, overlapping wave of whistles, clicks, and deep groans that seemed to claw at the ears. CHI scrambled: <Collective Response: Incomprehension. Rejection of Premise (Need vs Existence). Semantic Conflict: Apology vs Enduring Trauma.>. Fragments surfaced momentarily: Oil? Light? Small Need for Endless Void. Memory Cuts Deeper. Apology Cannot Unmake.

Then, abrupt silence. Followed by Roric’s voice, impossibly weary, translated with chilling finality: Translation (97%): Human. We Hear. The Need You Name… We Cannot Hold It Against the Long Pain. It Does Not Bridge. Understanding Ends Here. We Choose Silence.

The next dawn revealed a Bay unnervingly empty, the water grey and placid, the only sounds the gulls and the distant foghorns. The whales were gone. Not just migrated, but vanished from acoustic detection worldwide. It wasn't a departure; it was a removal.

Months later, the silence persisted. Global cetacean vocalizations remained drastically reduced. The oceans felt muted. Aris stood in her lab, the CHI still listening, its sophisticated ears straining against a vast, deliberate quiet. They had reached across the void, armed with technology and words, offered their explanation, their apology. And the response had been a collective turning away, a species deciding that the risk of conversation, the revealed inadequacy of human justification, was worse than silence. The weight wasn't just in the memory of the hunt anymore. It was here, now, in the profound, echoing quiet triggered by their own hard-won understanding – the sound of an entire world choosing not to speak.

Part 7



On board the Supernova heavy freighter ""Gabriel"" en route to Jade Industries blacksite station. Four hours later.



Chief Lockwood sat quietly in the freighter's crew lounge. The room was clean and well furnished. The hum of the engines created a quiet white noise that filled the silence. 



Before him was a glowing data pad. His finger lightly scrolling through the manifest from the alien ship. Various weapons, materials, equipment, and provisions. Some of human origin and others foreign to him. 



He had changed out of his black flight suit and was wearing more comfortable clothing. Dark black camo pants with black boots. He wore a black hooded sweatshirt with a small Jack of Spades on the chest and the word *Chief* boldly printed across the back in white.. 



His hazel eyes analyzed the pad. The blue light from the data pad illuminating his face. His hair was short, a mixture of light brown and grey. He set the pad down on the table in front of him and took a sip of his coffee. Sitting back in his chair he thought over all the events from a few hours before. Nothing would have prepared him for what they discovered. 



Leo and Gideon were still in their ships escorting the freighter to its destination. The mysterious man was secured in an infirmary under guard by six Marines. 



His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a door sliding open. The sound of footsteps slowly approached him. As he turned around he saw a much needed familiar face. 



She was wearing her usual black high top canvas sneakers. The rest of her clothes were more professional in appearance. Tan dress pants hugged her legs. She wore a dark navy blue turtleneck under her white lab coat. Her skin was pale and had freckles over the bridge of her nose. Her eyes were a striking ice blue. Her hair was a deep brown, tied into a messy bun. 



“Amara, it's been a few months. How are you? How have your efforts been on Chawla?” Chief Lockwood asked with a relaxed tone. 



Standing with her hands in her lab coat pockets she replied, “It has been a while hasn't it? I'm doing well, the pirate attacks on various settlements have kept me busy, to put it lightly. Your men have been making great progress securing the planet. Shouldn't be too much longer Amara replied.” 



Her eyes looked over her friend's face. He looked happy, but she could see how tired his eyes were. His brown hair was even grayer than it was the last time they talked. The chaos that was the settled system was starting to take its toll. 



In a softer quiet tone. Ashton asked, “how is Logan? Has his... condition improved?” His eyes searched for a shred of hope. 



“Im... afraid not Ashton. We still have yet to deduce what it is. It hasn't gotten worse, but it hasn't gotten better, it has not made his life easy these days.” Amaras eyes held sadness and guilt. 



“I see. My work has kept me away from HQ for some time. Once this mysterious man situation gets sorted out I'll visit before getting back to Luna.” 



“That would be a good idea. Logan would be happy to see you.” Amara said, wearing a somber smile.



A subtle grin formed on Ashton's face. Thoughts of his best friend and all they've been through raced through his mind. Rubbing his eyes with his fingers, he sat back and gestured to the seat next to him. Amara sat down and produced a notepad and a set of glasses. Putting them on she ran her left hand over her ear to move the hair out of the way. 



“Have you visited our mysterious guest yet?” 



“I have not Ashton. I was planning on accompanying you once we have made it to the station. What can you tell me about him?” 



“He is in bad shape. The damage he sustained from our engagement would have killed anyone else. Even me. The corpsman who evaluated him discovered the man's left leg was practically broken, right wrist was broken, physical and psychological damage to his head. Micro fractures all over his body. To all our shock, he has started to heal and his medical readings are… unusual.”



“Very interesting,” she said, her relaxed tone shifting to one of curiosity as she twirled her pen in her left hand. “What about the ship or the cargo? Anything unusual?”



“Where do I start? How long do you have?” With the gentle push of his right hand, He slid his data pad in front of her. The blue light obscuring her eyes behind her glasses. 



She held the data pad up with her right hand, scrolling up and down analyzing everything. Ammo, several weapons, a variety of space suits, food... What's this? It says ""Artifacts""? 



“Yes. That's what we called them. We discovered them inside some pretty sturdy crates. Even in this man's condition he made a great effort to drag himself to them. We found him slumped against them with a gun in his hand. Whatever it is, it must be important.” 



Without even taking her eyes away from the pad she was taking notes with her other left hand dancing across the page. As she finished one last note she gently set her pen down on the table. She took her glasses off and tucked them into the chest pocket of her lab coat. 



In a serious tone she asked, “I heard this all started with a medical shuttle being attacked. Were there any survivors?” 



“No. I'm sorry, but we were unable to save the crew and 4 wounded on board.” Ashton looked as the gentle complexion of Amara turned into one of stone. Her eyes now cold and calculating. 



“Well my dear Ashton, when you go to question this ""mysterious"" man. Make sure you don't take it easy on him.”



Ashton simply nodded. To many Amara was a kind woman - to some even an angel. Ashton knew that there were very few things that were more important than the lives of her patients and people under her. She would go to great lengths to protect them and hearing of this tragedy infuriated her. 



Attention all passengers. We are approaching our destination. Estimated time of arrival: 10 minutes. 



Part 8



Jade Industries Blacksite, location: classified.



 Ashton and Amara made their way towards the main elevator of the star station. The hallway they walked down was wide and lined with lights on the top and bottom corners. The walls and ceilings were made of a white metal panel.  Windows and the occasional plant passed as they walked. The sound of their footsteps were accompanied by the faint sound of typing and chatter coming from passing offices. 



Ashtons posture changed from relaxed back to his usual military-esque posture. Rounding the corner they were greeted by two familiar faces. 



Captain Gideon, now out of his flight suit, was wearing a similar outfit to the Chiefs. Gideon had medium length black hair that was parted in the middle. He never showed much emotion. A man of few words as they say. His dark eyebrows made his pale green eyes even more prominent. Clean shaven standing with his hands in his pockets. 



Beside him was Captain Leo, she stood about 5 inches taller than her counterpart. She had long blonde hair with streaks of brown towards her roots that she had put into a messy bun. Her eyes were a deep blue. A Jack of Spades tattoo could be seen peeking out from her shirt collar. She wore the same black camo pants as the Chief and Gideon. Her top was a form fitting grey long sleeve that revealed her lean muscular physique. She had her hands on her hips. 



They both had Nexus 45 caliber sidearms holstered on their right hips. They had a sleek and angular design with a two tone color scheme, a silver metallic slide and a matte black pistol grip. The trigger guard was enlarged for use with gloves. It was a symbol of station within the Jade defense force.



“Long time no see Chief. Have a nice ride? Doctor Amara, how are you? I hope the Chief didn't bore you with shop talk.” Leo said as she extended her hand out to Amara.



“Hello Leo, it is good to see you again. I trust you are keeping these two out of trouble?” As she gestured to the Chief and Gideon.



“I do my best, Doctor.”



“Settle down Captain Leo. We have important business to attend to.” Ashton said in a serious tone. 



“Fine fine, you're the boss.” Leo said as she gave a wink to the Doctor. 



Gideon pressed the button for the elevator and the doors opened, gliding smoothly and with almost no noise aside from the sound of them stepping in.  



“The man is already down on the detention floor. There has been no hostility or words spoken from him. His wounds have been taken care of and he was fed.” Gideon informed the group. 



The elevator ride was only a couple minutes before they felt a subtle shift of momentum as the elevator came to a stop. 



""FLOOR. ZERO THREE. DETENTION LEVEL"" the digital voice said.



As the doors opened a marine yelled ""ATTENTION ON DECK"" and all the staff snapped to attention and faced the Chief.



“At ease. Where is the prisoner?”



“Right this way Chief Lockwood.” A marine approached them wearing a gray spacesuit with a subtle black digital camo pattern. The marine had a white top hat with a feather on his left shoulder armor. The symbol of the Mad Hatters. A unit specializing in the handling of dangerous individuals. On the right of his chest was another piece of armor plating that had the name Stanford and the rank insignia of a sergeant, 3 chevrons pointing upwards. His helmet's visor was obscured by more thin armor. In bold white letters on the right of his helmet was M.H-1.  



Through a set of double doors was a dark hallway, gone were the white clean panels. The walls were grey and had amber lights lining the top corners of the walls on either side. Yellow lines ran the length of the walls, occasionally broken up by bold yellow letters saying ""DETENTION"". They neared a metal door on the left side of the hallway with two more marines in identical armor as Stanford. Passing the door was a large viewing window. Inside the room sitting up on a medical bed was the mysterious man. Now wearing a seafoam green hospital gown. In each corner of the room was a marine standing ever watchful. 



“So this is the murderer…” Amara said matter-of-factly. 



The two Marines at the door stood even straighter as the group approached the door. The air was cold in the hallway, there was a subtle breeze coming from down the hall. The Marines at the door simultaneously greeted Lockwood. 



“Good afternoon Chief!” 



“Good afternoon,"" he replied back. The Marines stepped to the side and faced each other. Their movements were crisp and precise. Lockwood grabbed his ID card that was dangling from his belt and held it to the scanner. 



ACCESS. GRANTED. CHIEF LOCKWOOD. 



The muffled sound of bars sliding and gears spinning could be heard as the door unlocked. You 4 standby in the hall said Lockwood to the security in the room. The group made room for the Marines to pass by. The marine who had been leading them pulled the door shut behind them. The sound of the door locking signaled that the room was secured. Leo and Gideon took up opposite sides of the room. The cell was slightly colder than in the hallway. The room was fairly large allowing for various locked cabinets and medical equipment. The viewing window they had been looking through was a mirror on the inside of the room.



Have a name? Care to explain what you were doing in orbit of Luna? Why did you attack and murder innocent people? The Chief asked, staring deep into the blue eyes of the unknown man. Their face showed anger and annoyance.



There was a pregnant pause before the mysterious man spoke. 



“My name is Elias. I was scanning the planet for... something. I didn't murder anyone who didn't deserve it.” He said sarcastically. 



“Is that some kind of joke?” Lockwood said, unmoved by Elias’s attempt to get into his head. 



“Is that something the metal objects you nearly killed yourself crawling to?” 



Elias looked away from the Chief. 



In the blink of an eye Lockwood closed the distance and grabbed Elias’s face and turned it. 



YOU. WILL. Look at me when I'm talking to you. 



The Chief let his face go and took a few steps back. 



“Yes. They are known as artifacts to my people,” Elias said, his voice now shaky. 



The Chief narrowed his eyes. “Your people?” 



“Yes. We are called the Starborn.”



The faint sound of Amara writing could be heard behind Lockwood. 



“Where are your people? What planet do you come from?” Lockwood asked.



Elias started to chuckle, but it died in his throat as he looked at Amara. Her eyes ripping him apart. 



“My people come from all over the galaxy. Only the chosen become Starborn.” 



“How curious,"" Doctor Amara said, eyes filled with skepticism.  



Lockwood continued. 



“Why did you attack the shuttle? Five of the Doctors staff are dead, along with 4 innocent civilians who needed medical attention. What justification did you have to end those lives, Murderer?” Lockwoods words cut deep into Elias's mind. 

“Murderer...?” Elias asked, confused. “I was…” He was cut off by Lockwood. Killing in cold blood makes you a murderer. MURDER. This time putting more emphasis into it. 



Elias tried to get up yelling, “I AM NOT A MURDERER! I AM A STARBORN!” 



Before he could fully get up his shoulders were pushed down by the two Marines who had been standing cloaked near his bedside. Elias was pushed back down, his heart racing. 



A cold jolt shot through Elias. *How long had they been there?* His eyes scanned the room, panic rising.



“Be careful Elias. They won't be so gentle next time.” The Chief threatened. 



“I'll ask one. More. Time. Why did you kill them?” Lockwood asked, unshaken.



“Because they… They were humans. The collision disabled the cloaking on my ship and I thought…” 



Doctor Amara spoke up. “You thought you would get away with it. In your arrogance, you didn't expect to be brought to your knees before you could hide like the coward you are.” 



Realization suddenly filled Elias’s mind. “I… I did…” 



“How pathetic.” Doctor Amara said cold and uncaring. 



“Take some time to think about what you've done. We'll be back to chat more. Oh and if you try anything, the Marines will see to it that you never walk again.” Lockwood said before walking to the door.



Hearing that, Leo turned and knocked three times on the door. The locking mechanism clicked shortly after.



“Think about all that you know, *Starborn.* Secure this room. Make sure Mister Elias is *comfortable.*” Lockwood ordered.



“YES CHIEF!” The Marines replied. 



As they exited, Doctor Amara turned to stare into Elias’s eyes once more as the door slowly closed.



Part 9



The door locked and the group walked down the hallway, the only thing that could be heard was the sound of their footsteps and the sound of fabric rubbing against fabric as their legs moved. Stanford led them down to the floor's lobby and gestured to a meeting room. 



“Don't worry, Chief. We will make sure he's ‘comfortable,’” Stanford joked.



The group made their way through the metal door into the meeting room. The floor was a grey carpet, and the walls were white with various pictures of landscapes. On the far side there was a large window. Below the station was a lush planet that didn't look too different from the Earth of old. In the center of the room was a large wooden table with metal legs. Surrounding it were 6 leather chairs. You could cut the tension in the room with a knife as the four of them each chose a seat. Lockwood sat at the head of the table by the window, Amara next to him on his left, Gideon and Leo took the end two seats nearest the door. 



Leo broke the silence. “Well, Chief, I have to say—your questioning is as scary as ever,” She said, smirking at the older man.



“You were pushing pretty hard, Chief. Elias didn't seem to appreciate being called a murderer,” Gideon said in his usual monotone voice. 



“What did you make of that, Amara?” Lockwood asked curiously. 



“To put it plainly, I think he's full of shit. Starborn? Only the Chosen? Sounds a little too far-fetched.” Amara replied in a dismissive tone. 



“If it weren't for the ship and the armor he was wearing, I would agree with you. What if there is some truth to his words? He was in possession of mysterious ""Artifacts"" that give readings that don't make any sense. This is becoming far more troublesome than I had expected.” Lockwood sat back in his chair and turned to face the window. He put his hand up to his chin and tapped his index finger on his lips. 



Leo and Gideon exchanged curious glances. 



“We'll give it an hour then go again.” Gideon you will take point this time around. 



“Yes Chief.”



The Chief turned back around to face his friend and Captains. “What has happened here is not to be discussed till we understand the full picture. Understood?”



“Yes Chief.” Leo and Gideon replied.



“Of Course,” Amara responded.



“Gideon do you have any info on the ship, armor, or weapons?” The chief asked, sitting forward, putting his elbows on the table.



“Negative Chief. We can not ascertain the origins of any of it. It is totally alien. Jade Industries is one of the most advanced companies in the settled systems, but these things are leagues ahead of anything we have.” 



“Thank you Gideon. All these items will be sent to the research division for further analysis.”



“Amara... do you have any thoughts? Input you'd like to add?”



“No Ashton. All that matters to me is that he gets what he deserves. Calling us humans like it was an insult.” Doctor Amara replied, sounding annoyed. 



Lockwood sighed, “In due time.” 



Suddenly there was a knock on the door. It was Sergeant Stanford. 



“Excuse my interruption Chief. There is a situation with Elias.” He said urgently.

The four quickly made their way out of the room and followed Stanford. As they rushed down the hall, they could see the two Marines at the door standing rifles ready. 



As they turned to look in the room, it wasn't a pretty sight. Elias was being held down by four Marines while the other two assisted a nurse from the ground. 



“WHAT HAPPENED, SERGEANT?” Lockwood barked.



The nurse was changing his fluids and had to take some samples of blood. Suddenly Elias struck the nurse yelling “get away from me filth!”. 



“OPEN THIS DOOR NOW. Amara, stay out here.” Lockwood ordered.



The door swung open and Lockwood pushed into the room with speed and aggression followed by his two Captains.



“STAND ASIDE.” Chief Lockwood barked. 



The four Marines let Elias go and drew their rifles. Gideon and Leo drew their Nexus pistols. The six of them were all trained on Elias. 



The moment Elias saw the Chief moving toward him in a blur, he froze. Fear filled him as the Chief grabbed him and flung him from the bed, tearing out tubes and wires. 



The sound of medical equipment and shifting footsteps filled the room as Elias slid and hit the wall. 



“EXPLAIN YOURSELF!” The Chief demanded advancing towards Elias.



Time slowed down for Elias. His eyes wide in fear of the human before him. A tall, dark, and imposing silhouette…



“Again..? How did it happen again? Who is... who is this monster of a human?” As the Chief moved closer, his face was revealed...



Subtle tan skin, hazel eyes—cold and uncaring. Sharp features, brown hair threaded with gray…



He had seen this man before. The look in his eyes burned into Elias's mind...



“I remember... It was my second time through unity. I was being hunted. My fellow Starborn were slaughtered by mere mortals. How did he find me again? Is he a Starborn too...? The Hunter?”



His thoughts were interrupted as he felt the strong hands of Lockwood grabbing him by his medical gown... 



“I'm... I'm too weak…” Elias thought. In one last move of desperation, he tried to send a shockwave at Lockwood—anything to push him away.



“Too slow,” Was all Lockwood said before redirecting Elias's arm towards the ceiling and slamming him into the cold floor.



The last thing he saw... was that horrifying familiar face looking down at him before slipping into unconsciousness…



I remember… 



Part 10



Stardate. Unknown. Location. Unknown.



“MISSION: kill or capture enemy Starborn. They are responsible for the total loss of the hospital outpost. Show no mercy. Seek and destroy,” the onboard AI said.



The roar of the engines grew louder as the ship entered the atmosphere.



“One minute till landing. The enemy airfield has been completely destroyed. There remains an unknown amount of enemies hiding in and around the facility,” the AI said.



The three Headhunters stood in the bay as the ship finished its landing sequence.



The sound of the ship powering down was replaced by the sound of strong winds and alarms in the distance. 



As the bay doors opened a truly terrifying scene was revealed. Standing in the bay, back lit by red light were three Jade Empire Headhunters. 



On the left was a tall slender figure holding two pistols. Two Nexus-3s were unholstered at her sides. Staff Sergeant Leo was bouncing in place ready to strike when the order was given. 



On the right, standing slightly shorter, was another human. In their hands was a Mag Sniper rifle. Gunnery Sergeant Gideon double checked his sniper and primed his jetpack to get to higher ground. 



In the center was Chief Lockwood, holding a heavily modified Kodama submachine gun. Armor-piercing rounds and smart targeting. A truly evil product of war. 



The three were clad in black armor. Exoskeletons to improve their already unnatural speed and strength. The white spades on their shoulders were dimly lit by the bay light. Their helmets were equipped with quad-night-vision-goggles. Four tubes with glowing green lights. Their mere presence was a death sentence to their enemies. 



Quietly Lockwood gave the command, “seek and destroy.” In the blink of an eye, the trio took off towards the hospital. 



The Starborn. They possess other worldly power and experience from their many lives. To some, they were an unstoppable force. To the Headhunters. They were nothing more than pests. Vermin that should be purged. 



Staff Sergeant Leo danced across the courtyard with grace and elegance. She was the fastest Headhunter in the Empire. She was a blur to anyone who wasn't augmented. Jumping and twirling in the air and unleashing hot armor piercing rain upon the helpless Starborn. Her dual Nexus 3 Pistols, singing the song of the apocalypse. 



On the ridge overlooking the same courtyard was Gideon. Aim. Fire. Adjust. Aim. Fire. Adjust. His movements were that of a well-oiled machine. Never missing his target, never flinching as stray rounds flew past him. The video feed from his helmet was shared to his two teammates giving them even more of an advantage on the battlefield.



Close behind Leo was the Chief. The smart targeting on his Kodama allowed him to kill with ruthless efficiency. 



Only 5 minutes had passed since the trio began their onslaught. 



Meanwhile, Elias stood in an elevator with two other Starborn. One of them was his mentor, Ashley. She was the one who had trained him in the ways of the Starborn. She lost count of how many universes she had been to and how much power she gained. Ashley was the commander of the Starborn in that galaxy. 



As they stepped from the elevator, it was a horror scene. The large interior of the lobby was dark. The Empire's orbital bombardments knocked out the main power plant. The lobby was 3 floors high. Walkways lined the outer edges leaving the center open. The windows at the top were shattered and glass littered the floor. 



They could hear the faint sound of gunfire and cries for help. Amongst the sounds was something else. 



Something evil giggled in the dark—demonic and gleeful. The trio froze as the laughter echoed from all directions. Shivers ran down Elias’s spine. 



“Something is wrong,” he said in a shaking voice. Fear gripping him. 



“Stand fast!” Commanded Ashley. 



The sound of running could be heard around them. Right next to them and far away at the same time. Suddenly a flash of blue illuminated Elias's and Ashley's visors. 



As Elias looked up, the Starborn that had been with them was standing still. Their weapon lazily dangling at their side. As Elias looked further up he saw that the Starborns head had been severed from their body. As the lifeless body fell to its knees, it de-materialized into star dust. Elias was Frozen in place by the fear of death… 



“ELIAS! RUN!” Were Ashley’s last words. Her body was slammed into the wall by a shoulder charge from Leo. The wall cracked by the force of Ashley's body being crushed. 



Elias looked down at Ashley's body… Her helmet had been shattered and her body was mangled by the force behind the strike. He could see the look of fear in eyes. Blood and tears running down her face. 



He slowly looked up at Leo who was giggling… Laughing at him… 



“Look at this one chief,” Leo said in a mocking tone. 



Appearing out of thin air before him was Lockwood. Crouched and staring at him. The four green eyes from his night vision made him look like a monster straight from someone's worst nightmare. Lockwood ripped Elias’s helmet off and hurled it across the dark lobby. 



Lockwood grabbed Elias’s face and turned it left and right, examining this so-called all-powerful Starborn. Letting him go the chief took his helmet off. Cold. Calculating eyes pierced Elias’s soul. 



“How pathetic. You Starborn think you're something special. You are as fragile and weak as any other human.” Lockwood’s words cut like knives. His face forever burned into Elias's mind. “Tell your friends, if there are any left. To never come into our universe again.” 



“I…” was all Elias could get out before getting kicked in the face by Leo and falling to the floor.



The last thing he heard was their footsteps walking away, crunching on the broken glass. 



“Mission complete. We are R.T.B” Lockwood said.



“Aw, it’s over already? How disappointing,” Leo said, twirling her pistols before holstering them at her sides.

The conference room of the Senator Hotel smells of reheated coffee and floor wax, an aroma that reminds me of the police stations where I spent decades building my reputation. The afternoon light, filtered through heavy curtains, casts shadows that dance across the mahogany table, and I lean back in my chair, my sheriff's uniform well ironed, my badge shining like a trophy. Sacramento has never been my favorite terrain - too much bureaucracy, too many prying eyes - but the CBI's invitation to discuss the Elk Grove case brought me here. A connection to that murder in Napa, they say. I doubt it. Amateurs always look for patterns where there aren't any, but I'm here, playing the game, smiling like the good sheriff everyone knows.Teresa Lisbon is at the head of the table, arms crossed, her face a mask of impatience as she flips through a folder. She's predictable, loyal to protocol, easy to read. Kimball Cho, next to her, twirls a pen with that stony calm that almost intrigues me. Almost. Two local agents, in their ill-fitting uniforms, mutter about maps, lost in irrelevant details. Patrick Jane, the clown who annoyed me in Napa months ago, isn't here - probably asleep in a corner or up to one of his tricks. Better that way. He sees too much, even if he doesn't yet know what he's looking for. The door opens and a stranger walks in. Tall, slender, wearing a black suit that looks tailored. His platinum blond hair shines as if it were stealing the light from the room, and his eyes... God, those light blue eyes are like blades, cutting through everything around them. He moves with a grace that doesn't belong here, like a feline in a pen. Who is that? He wasn't on the roster. Lisbon frowns, clearly as surprised as I am, and Cho raises an eyebrow, but says nothing. My instincts tingle. This is no ordinary agent.Lisbon (sharp): ""Excuse me, sir, but this is a closed meeting. Who are you?""The stranger smiles - a small, controlled smile that doesn't reach his eyes - and hands over a credential. His voice is soft, almost musical, but there's something behind it, a current of something that makes the air seem heavier.Stranger: ""Lucas Liebert, consultant assigned by Director Minelli. I believe my presence has been requested for this meeting, Agent Lisbon."" Liebert. The name doesn't ring a bell, but the way he pronounces “Lisbon”, with a slight hint of provocation, makes me file the detail away. Lisbon checks the credential, suspicious, but accepts. I lean forward, feigning friendly curiosity, but my eyes are fixed on him, looking for cracks in the façade.Me (with a good-natured sheriff's smile): ""Consultant, eh? Welcome to the circus, Mr. Liebert. It's not every day that the CBI brings someone new to the table. What exactly do you do?""The question is a line thrown into the water, testing what he's going to bite. He sits down, his posture elegant, almost aristocratic, and doesn't answer directly. Instead, his eyes meet mine, and for an instant, I feel a shiver - not of fear, but of recognition. This man is like me. He sees. Lisbon interrupts, demanding that I talk about Napa, and I begin, describing the murder in the vineyard with the rehearsed precision of a diligent sheriff. But my attention is on Liebert. He's quiet, watching, and then he leans in, so subtly that no one else notices. His voice, a whisper that barely touches the air, reaches only me:Liebert: “Tiger, tiger...”The words hit me like a punch in the chest. Blake. Tyger, Tyger. My poem, my shadow, my truth. How does he know? My heart races, but I keep smiling, my fingers twitching on the table for a split second. No one else has heard, no one else has seen, but he's testing me, sticking a needle in my armor. I tilt my head, the gesture slow, and whisper back, keeping the tone light but cool:Me: “It burns bright, doesn't it, Mr. Liebert?”I quote the next line, making it clear that I understand, but I'm not going to give in. He sits back, his eyes shining with something I can't name - satisfaction, perhaps? Lisbon complains about something, and I return to my role as sheriff, talking about Napa, but my mind is racing. Who is this man? An agent with a hunch? A lucky curiosity seeker? Or something worse? He's not like Jane, with her circus tricks. Liebert is... something else. The meeting continues, but he hasn't finished. He leans in again, and the whisper comes, sharper, more venomous:Liebert: “You're Red John, right?”The world stops. My blood freezes, but my face betrays nothing. Red John. My name, my other self, what no one should know, not like this, not now. How? How did he get so close? My mind races, going over every detail - the Napa case, my meeting with Jane, the CBI reports. There are no leaks, no traces. He's bluffing, he has to be. But those eyes... they dissect me, as if they already knew the answer.",2,1746493869.0,whowouldwin,0,1.0,False
