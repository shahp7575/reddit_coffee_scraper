I bought a SR800 to start my coffee roasting journey. Unfortunately it seems like my apartment alarms are very sensitive and even roasting with the balcony door open activates the fire alarms. I have a 6wks old baby, so activating the alarm every time I’m going to roast is not an option. My balcony has no plugs so to be able to roast outside I need an extension cord. I know this can affect how the roaster performs, so I’m wondering if anyone uses an extension cord and if a recommendation of a specific one can be made. This is my last chance at possibly roasting.

1j22tl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1j22tl2/my_traditional_grandparents_are_against_piercings/,my traditional grandparents are against piercings.. but i have one i've been hiding,"
from a young age, i've always loved the idea of expressing oneself through fashion or appearance, such as body mods or piercings. i begged my mom for a piercing throughout my teens and she was always very turned off by it and generally would get really upset when i asked, despite me offering to pay for it myself and i'm also not a bad kid at all; i do great in school, never been in trouble, and i do have an decent relationship with my family. i'm graduating with both an associates degree of science and my high school degree this may. finally, last year i got a job at a coffee shop over the summer and i convinced my mom to let me get my septum pierced (nose ring) and she finally gave in under the condition i would flip the piercing up when we were in the prescence of my grandparents. although i really didn't want to hide this choice, i agreed because i really wanted the piercing and was too scared to face my grandparents and didn't feel like i had to ask them for permission beforehand; i am my own person at the end of the day. for reference, my boyfriend also has his nose pierced and although he is a really amazing guy and treats my grandparents very well, they still bring it up when they can, saying he would look much better without it and he should take it out. it really infuriates me that they can't just look at someones character and love them despite what jewlery they wear or how they express themselves. we are mexican, so of course they're very traditional catholics and don't see progressively, and believe in honoring elders wants. i love my grandparents endlessly, they have always been there for me, but i am so tired of hiding my identity as i plan on getting more piercings in the future as well as tattoos. i turn 18 in a week and i plan on showing up to my birthday party at their house alongside my family with my septum and finally feel free to be myself. i know this may seem like such a big deal over a piercing, but i really am scared of their judgement and terrified they won't love me anymore. how should i go about this? will my plan be ok? 

TLDR: i have been hiding my septum from my grandparents for a year in fear of their judgement, i turn 18 soon and no longer want to hide it. how can i show them in a way that they won't see me differently?",1,1740953078.0,family,1,1.0,False
1j22tg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Darkness_WithIn6833/comments/1j22tg0/started_with_a_coffee_and_a_book/,Started with a Coffee and a book,"Valyria traced her fingertip along the condensation on her iced caramel coffee, the rich scent of espresso and buttery sweetness filling the air around her. She took a slow sip, letting the cold, smooth liquid slide over her tongue as she sank deeper into the pages of her e-reader.

The scene unfolding before her was pure filth—well-written, deliciously drawn-out tension that made her press her thighs together beneath the table. She loved moments like this, where the world outside the coffee shop melted away, leaving only the pulse of anticipation between each page turn.

A quiet chuckle broke her focus.

Valyria lifted her gaze, instinctively guarded, and found a pair of deep, expressive eyes watching her from across the room. The man—dark-haired, lean but strong, with a book in his hands—immediately looked away, as if he hadn’t meant to be caught.

But his fingers tapped a restless rhythm on the cover, betraying his awareness of her.

Intrigued, Valyria took another slow sip of her coffee, letting the moment linger before tilting her head slightly. “Something funny?”

His lips parted, and for a second, he looked torn between responding and pretending he hadn’t been watching her at all. Then, as if deciding honesty was the only way out, he let out a quiet, self-conscious laugh. “Not funny, exactly. Just… I was trying to figure out what you were reading.” His voice was low, almost hesitant, but warm. “And then I realized I probably shouldn’t.”

She arched a brow, a smirk playing at the edges of her lips. “Oh? Why’s that?”

He exhaled, his fingers still tapping against his book. “You looked… invested. Either the story’s really good, or—” He hesitated, then gave her a slow, knowing glance. “It’s really good.”

Heat curled through her, not from embarrassment but from amusement. Bold, but not cocky. Shy, but observant.

“Maybe both,” she murmured, crossing one leg over the other.

His eyes flickered downward for the briefest second, then back up, as if unsure where to look. He adjusted his grip on his book, and the movement drew her attention to his hands—strong but careful, like he handled things with deliberate thought.

Valyria let the silence stretch between them before finally tilting her chin toward his book. “What about you? If you’re going to make assumptions about mine, I get to do the same.”

He swallowed, then turned his book so she could see. “It’s, uh… a sci-fi novel. But the poetic kind. Lots of metaphors about stars and loneliness.”

Something in his voice softened as he said it, as if those words meant more to him than he was letting on.

Valyria studied him, then let a slow smile curl across her lips. “I like stories that make you feel something.”

He exhaled, the corner of his mouth lifting. “Yeah. Me too.”

For a moment, they simply existed in the charged quiet between them—his gaze flickering to her lips, hers lingering on the slight flush dusting his cheeks. Then he seemed to steel himself, shifting slightly in his seat before meeting her eyes again.

“I’m Riven.”

“Valyria.”

He let her name settle between them before speaking again, his voice quieter now. “Do you come here often?”

She dragged her fingertip along her cup once more, watching the way his eyes followed the motion. “Depends. Do you?”

He hesitated, then gave her the smallest, shyest smile. “I might… start.”

And just like that, something shifted—not love at first sight, not desire burning hot and fast, but something deeper. A quiet pull. A connection waiting to unfold.",1,1740953069.0,u_Darkness_WithIn6833,0,1.0,False

1j22sgh,https://i.redd.it/3znhz4c3ncme1.jpeg,Where to get serviced? [Rocket Mozzafiato],"Hi fellow coffee nerds -

I’ve been a proud owner of my Rocket Mozzafiato for about four years now. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed every moment with this machine. Between my wife and me, we pull between two to four shots daily. I take good care of it - use good water, backflush it regularly, replaced the group head gasket several times throughout its life, etc etc etc.

Recently, I decided to descale it using citric acid (after watching the Hoff’s video, which gave me the confidence to try it). It definitely pooped out scale, even though I went very light on the ratio of citric acid solution because I was so nervous after not descaling for such a long period… because of this - I’m seeking someone/somewhere qualified to service the machine before I clog a line by descaling more often.

Additionally, my steam wand has started to dribble water even when fully closed. I suspect that a few gaskets are aging and causing the issue. I’m looking to get this fixed, but I’ve had limited success online in identifying the specific parts I need to order or replace.

I reside in the heart of Houston, one of the largest cities in the country. I would assume that there are reputable repair shops nearby, but I can’t seem to find any information about them online. Could anyone recommend a reputable repair shop in the area?

But: I’m proof that “it just takes willpower” is a lie,"I literally can’t remember the last time I wrapped a whole standard sized towel around myself but today, it happened. I started in December at around 287 and last week in February I’m down to 259. 

I have a lot of conflicting feelings about losing weight. I’ve always been prone to keeping weight on thanks to what are probably 100% Irish peasant genes which served my ancestors very well. My teen years were spent in the PEAK of the media portraying extremely normal looking women as morbidly obese, which fucked all millennial women up haha. 

Over the years I’ve tried and failed to do all kinds of diets. I almost never eat fast food or sugars and don’t do a lot of processed foods.  I’d usually eat about two meals a day with a small breakfast and a big dinner. But I love carbs and cheese because they rock haha. 

It’s taken me probably ten years or more but I can genuinely say I am body positive and totally okay with being fat. I have fat on my body, just like everyone else. My health stats have always been impeccable. I spent a year working out for an hour and half 3x a week and never lost a pound but found a love of exercise and fitness. 

Then, in December at the age of 32 I was diagnosed with adhd and started on stimulant medication. It has completely changed my life around, specifically as it pertains to impulse control and dopamine. 

People who have adhd naturally have lower levels of dopamine, and a lot of people (especially kids) will self medicate or additionally medicate with sugar, but sweets have never really been my thing. But you know what is converted into sugar? Carbs. So when I’d start my morning with a coffee and a croissant, it was me unknowingly trying to boost my dopamine levels. When I smoked cigarettes (a stimulant) for years and years, same thing. And when I tried dieting by cutting out carbs, my body would panic and make up for it by impulsively binge eating everything in sight to try and regain that lost dopamine source. 

 Since getting on stimulants, I no longer impulsively reach for carbs. Instead, I crave protein. I’m not starving myself (which can definitely happen with a suppressed appetite) but my body’s needs have shifted now because the medication is providing the dopamine I used to have to get from foods. Now I drink protein shakes, eat salads, and say no when offered carbs or little treats not because it’s “wrong” but because my body isn’t asking for it. 

For years I had to sit through well meaning lectures on “just replace one meal a day with (whatever new fad is there)” or “count calories” or “calories in calories out” or the best one, “just listen to your body.”

The thing is, I WAS listening to my body. My body needed dopamine, and food supplied it to me. No amount of white knuckling or calorie counting or intuitive eating would have solved it for me. 

I hope that as science of the brain expands, it will help solve a lot of the rhetoric of “fat people are just lazy” or “fat people just have no will power.” I am living proof that is not the case, especially considering I have had the will power to stop many addictions in the past, all except food — until now. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk haha. Wearing a normal sized towel is surreal and pretty cool, and I’ll continue loving my body in whatever form it comes in — but I’m also excited now to be able to find clothes that aren’t just ugly af potato sacks or biz casual outfits made exclusively for someone who manages a neighborhood Wells Fargo bank hahaha.

The amount of souls that they had helped leave in peace was not what had left her like this. Sure they have been in the thousands, but that wasn’t hard or tiring, it was like having a nice chat with a lost kid and helping them cross.



But they had wanted first to bury them, then realized it was impossible to do so they just moved the bodies to the nearest forest of terrain with soil, so they would go back to nature.

And that was taking into account that they only had to move those in the roads, most of the bodies in cities and villages had already been done by other magical beings.

There was someone clearly organizing the disposal of most of the bodies, and she had an idea of who she was. Sister Marie hadn’t said anything but she had heard her speak with Steven, the vampire she had been friends with for a long time, so that left Madame Vampire (as most called her) as the most probable being trying to organize the chaos that was in the world.



The sound of some steps took her away from her thoughts and she turned her head to see the Time Mage approaching.

He was a strange being. About 1’80m tall, with curly brown hair and yellowish eyes over white skin, pale as a cadaver. She had heard him explain in the past that the eyes and the skin color was due to his time magic, he could get tanned but reversing time to keep his immortality turned the skin back to white; and the eyes, well, turns out your eyes turn yellow when you unlock time magic.

But above all, he always had a half smile, as if the universe was a joke that only he could understand.



“*Enjoying the warm waters of the Mediterranean sea while watching a sunrise?” –* he said offering her a flask

“*Well, is the end of May so they are not cold, and I wanted to cry alone for a bit” –* she answered, grabbing the flask and taking a sip. It was alcohol and coffee, and it warmed her throat and body as it went down.

“*I get that. I’ve seen death, but is not the bodies and lost that gets you, it’s the eeriness, isn’t it? Everything is so quiet, I miss the sounds of civilization as well” –* he said taking a sip.

“*Yeah that and the usual questions. Not only who thought this would be a good idea but who could have done all of this? This had to be a massive spell, something tremendous!”*

“*Honestly? Not really” –* he answered without skipping a beat – *“From the top of my head I can think of hundreds of beings that could have done this. It really is a simple spell. I heard the command ‘any non-magical sapient beings’, that was all of it.” –* he explained – *“The only difficult part is reaching all the planet at the same time, but with enough resources and planning, almost anyone could do that. A few decades ago? Yeah, impossible. But with instant communication anywhere in the world as we had it? Totally doable, even for a rookie.”*



She looked at him surprised, both because she hadn’t thought about it that way and by how calm he was.



“*How can you be so nonchalant? Billions of people have died!”*\- she exploded.

“*And we are already working on it. There were lots of fertilization clinics in the world, and I know for a fact that we’re already working in fertilizing those eggs and doing our best to create as much humans as possible” –* he calmly explained – *“As the saying goes, life … finds a way. So all these souls, in time, will find new bodies and will continue to grow”*



She grunted in frustration. There was not having a normal conversation with someone who had existed for god knows how long. He might as well seen Pangea for all she knew.



“*Come on.” –* he said giving her a hand to stand up – *“Sister Marie and Sister Astrid have walked everyone they could in the near distance and are already packing up and filling the bikes. We’ll be crossing the Pyrenees today, probably make night in Cadaqués”*



She always had wanted to see that place, as it had been pirate village in the past, but definitely not like this. Still, she grabbed the hand and stood up, walking behind him with the rising sun on her back.

\---------

Jan woke up with the sound of the birds.

He was still on the terrace, sitting on that chair, the glass he had been drinking on just right there on the floor.

He had a washbowl inside, on a table, filled with water, so he washed his face and scrubbed a bit of the body, then threw the water outside and filled it again, in case he needed it.



Next, he checked the computer he had set up to monitor all the solar batteries, just ensuring everything was loaded and no building had any issue. That was one of the legacies of his life as an IT guy, and he liked it this way. A screen showing green, yellow or red, monitoring stuff.

“*Ah Nagios, my old friend, where would I be without you” –* he said out loud to no one in particular.



Since everything was ok he decided to take it slowly, even though it was a Thursday. He made some coffee, waiting patiently for the italian coffee pot. He had tasted other kinds but this one was the one he saw his parents use and the one he grew up with and thus the one closest to his heart, he even took one with him years ago when he went to work to the UK.



A hot cup of black coffee, no sugar, with a bit of milk, to start the day. Some would call it a macchiato, but here in Spain it had always been “a cortado, short on milk, long on coffee”



Today, he decided, he was going to just chill. It was going to be a day of “laying in the couch and watching TV”.

He decided to start watching Stargate from the beginning. He had seen it a lot of times but it had been years since the last time.

He had been saving a full rerun to watch with his kid, but that was not going to happen.



The thought almost brought him to tears so he decided to roll a joint while humming the soundtrack.

By the time it actually played, five minutes in on the first episode, he was already high and going for another coffee.

Yeah, today it was going to be a day of Stargate and chill.

\---------

“*I don’t recommend today for chatting with him, Sire” –* Steven said

Hathor grunted, seeing the guy who could blow everything to high heavens just smoking and watching a TV show.

“*It has been my experience that, when he’s like this, he does not like to be bothered, at all.” –* Steven continued.

“*I understand, but I have other important stuff to do. I should not be waiting for him to be in a good mood.”* – she said, her voice full of frustration – *“Well is daytime and the kid is also sleeping.”* – she continued, going to her computer - “*Fuck it, there’s still good signal here. So I’m going to send a few orders, organize things a bit, and then go to rest.” - s*he then looked at Steven – *“Be a dear and get me some blood-bags. I believe I saw a nearby hospital, I’ll be training the kid today a bit more. He needs to be able to resist the hunger once and for all”*

“*Yes Sire” –* Steven said, in his thoughts feeling sorry for the kid, he still remembered when he went through the ‘training’

“*Hathor, I’ll go with Hathor, please remember that”*

“*Yes my Sire Hathor” –* Steven said with a smile. And left towards the hospital, he too would drink some blood-bags and satiate his hunger a bit.

\---------

The moment the Sisters and the Time Mage crossed the Pyrenees they had to stop, as they all felt a shock as if crossing a magical field.



“*And that, my friends, is the creature everybody is so scared about” –* the Time Mage said – *“And remember, it is not only asleep, but chained to a human soul. You cannot begin to fathom how powerful it is.”*



It didn’t hurt, it was just a powerful presence. As if someone was saying “Welcome. This is my territory. Behave”



“*I will remind you now that you must not feel aggression towards it. You will burn.” –* the Time Mage continued – *“Or at least that’s how it was in the past, although to be honest it feels kind of different this time so I’m not a hundred per cent sure. I wouldn’t want to test it though”*



“*And yes. It can kill me. If it attacks it’ll be so fast that I won’t have time to do shit. It has killed a few Time Mages in the past.” –* he continued – *“So if any of you does something stupid, I will just look at it. Probably bring some popcorn”*



The three sisters nodded at him, and they continued their travel. The sun was almost setting and they were going to be in time to make night in Cadaqués, just as they wanted.

1j22ja4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/1j22ja4/cramping_issues_help/,Cramping issues! help!,"Hey guys, I’ve been strict paleo for about three weeks now. I was having depression and anxiety issues and I turned towards diet to help. I feel great mentally and my mood has been amazing. 

The only “cheats” I have daily would be 8oz plain milk kefir daily as that completely healed my ibs symptoms a while back so that’s not going anywhere. I also eat potatos pretty regularly. Besides this I’m locked in.

Now here’s my issue, leg cramping. It started three days ago with my foot mega cramping up but I chalked it up to just a one off thing. Then I started to notice while I slept my shins and calves had a dull ache and I went oh they are cramping. Nothing that’s intense just annoying. When I went to the gym today to do cable rows my calves were even cramping from that! Even writing this right now they ache. I’m just kind of lost on why this is happening. 

My thought is not enough salt? I feel like I eat a fair bit of salt with my potatos, meat, and plain pork rinds have a bunch added so I assumed I was okay but maybe not. So far this has been why I eat each day:

1lb Potato’s, 1lb of meat, a few tbsp of olive oil, 1 onion, 1 cup kéfir, 1 apple, 1-2oz pork rinds with salsa, a couple ounces of dates, and a couple ounces of cashews. This has been like 90% of my food. I add salt to the meat and potato’s and the pork rinds/salsa have a lot of salt too I thought. For liquids I drink a lot of coffee and probably have 100oz water a day. Just curious what you guys think on what’s going on with me

TLDR: I’ve been paleo for three weeks and my legs have been cramping up often. My daily diet is listed in the paragraph above and I’d like feedback on why this might be happening.  ",1,1740952341.0,Paleo,1,1.0,False

Hope you all can help me finish setting up my home. More specifically, I’m looking for ideas to add things on the walls next to my fireplace/tv, and that weird awkward wall opposite the windows. My style is bohemian/with elements of transitional. Overall I want my living room to feel cozy, personal, and familial. I like grounding earth tones hence the green throw pillows. 

My own idea (as illustrated in the drawing below) was to hang one big but wall size proportionate wedding/family portrait on the left side and add two portraits horizontally equaling the same size as the other on the right side ( lmk what you think of my idea). 

Note: for the awkward wall I do not want to have a mirror there since I have a rambunctious dog and we plan to have a baby soon and it’s too much of a safety hazard. Also, no coffee table because couch pulls out and our dog needs the room to get his zoomies out (Dog tax is paid below).

# What I’m Looking For:

* **Community:** I’d love to be somewhere it’s easy to meet like-minded people, especially when it comes to dating. I’m a single 30F, ready for my next chapter - building a long-term home, hopefully starting a family, and connecting with people who share similar values. I’ve spent the past several years growing in my career and feel confident in where I am professionally, which has allowed me to shift my focus toward building a fulfilling personal life. I’m not religious and tend to have progressive values, but I appreciate diversity of thought and open-mindedness. I prefer places that embrace inclusivity and sustainability while allowing for different perspectives.
* **Lifestyle:** I enjoy a mix of outdoor activities and city life. I love hiking, reading, pottery, gardening, cooking at home, and prioritizing health and fitness (both mental and physical). I don’t drink or party much and really value walkability to groceries, coffee shops, and daily essentials.
* **Accessibility:** I travel frequently, so proximity to a major airport is a big plus.
* **Nature & Weather:** I’m very affected by extremes, especially cold, dark, and rainy conditions. If I had to choose, I’d take heat over cold, but ideally, I’d love a mild and/or sunny climate. I’m outside every day and value access to nature, parks, water, and mountains, though I know I may need to compromise on some of these.
* **Family Proximity:** My family and childhood friends are all in Michigan. While I don’t see myself living there right now, I’d love to be within a reasonable distance - ideally somewhere drivable within a day’s time. This isn't a hard requirement, but more of a nice-to-have.

I don’t expect any place to have everything, but I’m interested in seeing what comes close. Based on all this, I’d love to hear your thoughts!",3,1740951882.0,SameGrassButGreener,20,0.64,False

**Gate Goggles:** duh, better vision. Personal preference though.



**Accursed Hood:** gives +1 cold resist, trees won't attack you which doesn't really matter, and the added benefit of having better trades for the future portal. We won't really know how important that will be though. Nice to have it going into new future content though.

**Bindings of Malediction:** completes the half set bonus for automatic bleed cures. Armour automatically repairs itself which is handy.

**Exor Spines:** gives +1 cold and heat resistance. *Combined with the weathered trait you can go into Voussoir* without a heater shield, coffee, or any gear swapping at all.

**Exor Shinguards:** completes the half set bonus for increased movement speed. I stopped using the full set because the exor minion would occasionally spawn in my base for no reason and shoot a laser at my stuff and then teleport away. Really annoying. It's also unreliable, constantly spawning in a bad spot and not attacking the right enemy. It's a strong set for sure, but I just started to feel inconvenienced by it.

**Shield:** I barely use it but I use the hardlight shield because it doesn't obstruct my screen, and it doesn't need to be repaired. Obviously, it's just a solid shield all around. If I didn't have +3 cold from my gear and trait I'd just use the heater shield for convenience, since I never use shields in combat.



**Trinkets:** up to preference. I always like to have the cube on me since I use the jump pack instead of the jet pack. Either way I still like to have it. Potato could swap for the shield generator trinket or whatever you want to do.

**Suit:** none. Will swap in a hazmat suit if I'm going to be near radioactive areas or picking up power cells. Some people don't read, but suits slow you down. The thirst loss is whatever, but the slower speed is annoying. Plus you don't get to have your desired outfit style.

One of the few hobbies I still had was gaming, and I met another guy through it. We are both in our late 20's and have the same life story. We started chatting, and I quickly realized we had a lot in common. He was funny, kind, and easy to talk to.  

Even though we lived about three hours apart, we spoke constantly. We were absolute pen pals. We texted every day — for hours. We video-called, opened up about our lives, and shared personal struggles. We had those deep, late-night conversations where you feel like you've really found someone who *gets you*. When his dog passed away, he called me crying. We talked about his fears of losing his dad because of a genetic condition. He told me he can rarely open up to someone like he could with me. I genuinely thought we were best friends.  

I tried several times to meet up in person. I invited him to visit my city three times — offered to show him around and even crash on my couch since I live by myself — but there was always some reason he couldn't make it. The excuses made sense at the time, so I never questioned it. I even offered to come to his town, and while he was open to it, the timing never worked out. He always had a reason — family visits, being sick, already having plans. I trusted him completely, so I never doubted what he told me.  

There was a concert in my city for a band we both loved. I asked if he wanted to come, but he said he couldn't because he was visiting family who was on the other side of the country. I was bummed but told him to have a nice trip and figured we'd catch up later. On the day of the concert, I didn't really feel like going to the concert anyways so instead, I decided to check out a reptile show which was that Sunday.

I went to the reptile show and that's when I saw him, my friend — standing there with his friend. He looked absolutely shocked when he noticed me. Meanwhile, I was just happy to finally meet him in person and went up to say hi. We talked about meeting in person like a million times so I was just excited to see him there. He hugged me and introduced me to his friend. When I asked what they were doing in town, his friend casually said they have been here since Friday, just seeing the town and such.

That's when it hit me. He had lied.  

I asked him how come he was here, and he fumbled through some half-baked explanation about how things changed last minute. But it was so obvious he was backtracking. My heart sank. I asked him why didn't he tell me? He had to answer. I asked him if he was really so busy he couldn't grab a coffee or something for 3 days he was here and he just stared blankly at me saying it's not like that. I just told him to enjoy the rest of his trip and walked away.  

A few minutes later, my phone started blowing up with messages — him apologizing, saying how much he valued our friendship, that it was just a weird turn of events, and asking if I was okay. I told him we were good, but I haven't replied since. He sent more messages apologizing, but I just feel... hurt. I know what happened. I am naive, not an idiot.

I don't understand why he lied. It feel like he never wanted to meet. Like, if he didn't want to hang out, why keep texting every day for so long? Why did he just watch me try to make plans time and time again if he never planned on meeting up? Why did he open up so deeply? I really thought we were friends. Now I feel so stupid, like I was just some desperate idiot clinging to a friendship that never really meant as much to him as it did to him.

Why would someone do that? What did I do wrong? I just wanted to finally meet my friend",6,1740951739.0,internetparents,3,1.0,False
1j2290z,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1j2290z/update_1_i_was_invited_to_a_welcome_to_the/,"UPDATE #1: I was invited to a Welcome to the Village ""party""","I can't figure out how to update on my previous post so I'm just creating a new one due to a high demand for more details. 

Long story short, my jerk of a cousin's (Preggo Mom, P-Mom) sophomore in high school kid (Preggo) is reallllllly ready to give birth and it's a coin toss between two baby daddies. P-Mom invited ""friends and family"" to a Welcome to the Village party where we were supposed to sign up on her bitch-ass Kinko's chart for chores and repeating donations. The party was scheduled from 10-1 o'clock today. 

This is a ""mom's side of the family"" thing. My mom and dad are both 83 and some of the ""rich"" members of the fam. My mom had three siblings (deceased) and I am an only child. Between her and her sibs there are nine kids. My cousins have seven children between them. A kind Redditor informed me that my cousins' kids are my first cousins once removed and not ""second cousins"" as I mistakenly referred them to in my last post so I will refer to them as the CK's (Cousins' Kids.) P-Mom is single and has Preggo (15) and her older sister (Preggo Sis, P-Sis) who is in her first year at the local State U. 

So. P-Mom came running to my mom first and foremost because she is the oldest and one of the most financially secure in the family. My mom gathered all the information from P-Mom that she needed about the financial demands that P-Mom was making on behalf of her daughter and spilled ALL of the beans to me about the repeating GoFundMe donation page and the repeating Amazon grocery list and the Target wishlist. I have a big fat mouth so I told ALL of the CK's what was happening which meant that the word spread like hot syrup. My mom told P-Mom that she would bring a lasagna and send a gift off the registry but she'd probably be too tired to attend her party after her Carribean cruise. My dad was quite vocal about not supporting teen pregnancy. The CK's and I wrote slightly rude responses on our RSVP's.

After all of the ""nopes"" started pouring in, P-Mom started the ""Sorry you can't make it to our party but here's the donation links"" texts. It pissed The Cousins right TF off because the CK's are all in colleges and trade schools and are studying their asses off and living their youth and the fact that P-Mom extended her begging bowl to THEM really REALLY *REALLY* pissed The Cousins off. So last weekend myself and P-Mom's siblings and their spouses convened for a family brunch so we could get trashed on Bloody Mary's, talk shit about P-Mom, and formulate a plan to get P-Sis out of that house before her college career is ruined. That part was easy, P-Mom's brother and his husband have a finished basement with two teensy bedrooms, a wee bathroom, and a kitchenette with a huge living room and their daughter absolutely loves her cousin and gave full permission to share the space. P-Sis will actually save money because P-Mom started charging her rent after her high school graduation and at her uncles' house she just has to keep tidy and she'll pay nothing. Plus it's much closer to the campus and her McJob. My contribution is to help move her bed and dresser with my work van after the party today but honestly we're all thinking that we'll all just pitch in to buy her a new bed and furniture. We called P-Sis and laid out our proposition and she leapt on it. She turned 18 last year so she's free to do as she wishes. We moved most of her stuff last week when P-Mom was at work. P-Mom is unaware of this plan which is not shocking because she has her head permanently wedged up her sphincter and their family is dirt poor so we only had to move like four suitcases of books/makeup/clothing out for P-Sis. Oh, did I mention that Preggo and P-Sis share a bedroom divided by a shower curtain on a clothing rack? Yeah, I was unaware of *THAT* one.

So anyway...the party. This is all secondhand info because obviously I was not there. P-Mom's apartment building has this ""community space"" that you can sign up to use during specific time slots for free. It's...not great. I've attended birthday parties for her kids in that room and it's 100% like a Dwight Schrute conference room party with shitty wooden chairs with that god-forsaken forest green and maroon hotel fabric and beige walls  that smells like spilled coffee and old people farts. It gets so much worse when you try to festoon it with crepe paper and Dollar Tree latex balloons.

According to P-Sis, at first the only people who showed up were four of Preggo's high school friends who were helping put up the bunting and squealing BS about ""What do you think you're gonna get?"" like it was her birthday or some such shit. Some people wandered in and were confused because they thought it was a baby shower so they left the packs of diapers on the ""gift table"" before awkwardly departing. According to P-Sis nobody even took their coat off or drank a glass of punch. P-Mom is wearing a ""World's Hottest Grandma"" shirt. She tried asking people to ""sign up"" on her stupid chart but it's still blank. P-Sis told me that the ""sign up duties"" on the chart include babysitting for FULL DAYS FOR FREE and repeating GoFundMe cash donations so they can rent a three bedroom house. They have one all picked out, they met with the property manager and everything.

I'm still waiting on more details. P-Mom's three siblings and their spouses that I had brunch with last week are meeting up with P-Mom right now to give her a reality check. P-Sis texted me to say that all the gift-grab garnered was diapers and a three-pack of onesies.

My husband (30) and I (29) started trying for our first baby in December. We tracked using OPK’s, BBT via Oura ring. We were fortunate to conceive naturally on our second cycle in January. I really wanted reassurance that things were progressing well even though I have no history of loss, normal 28/29 day cycles and no history of other conditions, so I started doing beta’s really early on. 

2/3/25 (12 DPO / 3w2d) - tested positive on FRER and CB digital 
2/4/25 (13 DPO / 3w3d) - first beta test - 20 (Labcorp)
2/6/25 (15 DPO / 3w5d) - 45 (Labcorp)
2/8/25 (17 DPO / 4w) - 96 (Labcorp)

Stopped testing here because my levels were doubling appropriately. I was tracking line progression but stopped because the lines would get lighter and darker and I was driving myself crazy. No pregnancy symptoms other than light tugging / tingling feeling in my lower belly. 

2/13/25 (22 DPO / 4w5d) - had really light brown spotting, only enough to see on a tissue. Went in for another beta at Labcorp and it came back at 77. We were concerned this could be a lab error because it took them 5 days to run my blood (they said it was missed). No cramping or other symptoms. Spotting stopped after 2 days. 

2/18/25 (27 DPO / 5w3d) - brown spotting started again. Went to the hospital where they took another beta and did an external and internal ultrasound. Beta came back at 168.5. Nothing could be seen on ultrasound of course, but they did note my endometrium lining was great and there were no signs of fluid in my pelvis and my tubes looked clear / healthy. 

2/20/25 (29 DPO / 5w5d) - beta came back at 223 through Labcorp. 

Started spotting after the ultrasound and began regularly spotting / bleeding light red blood. At times it looked like coffee grounds. Never any pain / cramping. 

2/22/25 (31 DPO / 6w) - beta through Labcorp dropped to 161. 

2/23/25 (32 DPO / 6w1d) - Oura ring showed my BBT dropped -5 below normal line, my HR returned to its normal levels and I began bleeding like a light to medium period with smaller clots. I assumed this was the MC happening and accepted it for what it was. I decided I would track my hCG decreases with LH strips and wait for them to fade out. Except they didn’t. 

My LH strips consistently got darker and were the darkest they had been since getting pregnant (almost a dye stealer on easy@home). My bleeding had stopped 2/25/25. Still no cramping or other pain. 

3/1/25 (38 DPO/ 7w) - went for a beta hoping to see it went down. It came back at 435. 

I know everything points to ectopic and I don’t have hope this is at all viable. I’m more so looking to see if anyone has these trends and what your outcome was (crossing my fingers everything resolves on its own - I’m so scared to lose a tube or needing to take anything to pass this). I have a note out to my obgyn for a callback tomorrow to push for another ultrasound. 

TLDR: Fluctuating beta’s, “miscarriage” bleeding, no cramps/ pain, no pregnancy symptoms aside from some more light tugging/ pulling and tingling in my lower belly. 

3w3d - 20
3w5d - 45
4w - 96
4w5d - 77 (lab error?)
5w3d - 168.5 (hospital lab)
5w5d - 223
6w - 161
7w - 435

I've been into coffee for close to a decade now, and I consider myself a fairly competent brewer. I started out trying many different styles of coffee, but gradually developed a pretty strong preference for washed light roasts (Tim Wendelboe, Subtext, etc). 
I have continually honed my skills and I can reliably produce cups that I enjoy very much with these coffees.

I was traveling recently and went to a local roaster with a great pour-over program. The barista made a mistake and brewed the Natural Ethiopian when I ordered washed. I was initially annoyed, but I ended up loving the brew! Wonderful bright fruity flavors without the compost notes I nearly always get when I brew similar coffees at home. I was tight on time, so I didn't the chance to chat with the barista about the recipe etc.

I have tried a few more funky coffees since then, and I have had moderate success making tweaks to lower extraction (temp, ratio, agitation), but I cannot get rid of those compost notes. Does anyone have a go-to technique they use to produce somewhat clean cups with funky coffees? I'm aware that these coffees will never be as clean as a washed coffee, but I'm convinced I can do better!

I'm currently using an Ode Gen 2 with SSP Brew V1, 1Zpresso K-Plus, multiple drippers, Cafec T-90, and Lotus Drops with very soft filtered tap water (I sometimes use diluted Third Wave with distilled water).

I am not a cat owner, never have been. I’m a dog person.  Currently, I have fish. 

Out of the corner of my eye I see a dark brown/black cat silhouette walking from the hallway door, under the kitchen table, towards the back door. It was a solid looking. 
I’ve seen apparitions before but they were more transparent, similar to a Harry Potter “Dementor.” 

It looked that realistic I checked the room and under the furniture to see if there was actually a real cat present. 

I have been seeing references to cats quite a lot for the last week, admittedly I’ve noticed them but not really acknowledged them. 

If the universe is trying to get my attention it would be better off sending me dog related references.

The other thing I should include. Yesterday was my deceased father’s birthday. He passed away 22 years ago. We did not have the greatest relationship, I did however wish him happy birthday and encouraged him if he’d not reincarnate back to earth already to choose somewhere else to go next time. 

This morning in the shower, prior to the cat apparition appearing, I heard two Gordon Lightfoot songs, Sundown and The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald. They just popped into my head all of a sudden. Prior to that E.I. by Nelly was the first song in my head when I woke up. 
That in itself was strange. Haven’t heard that in forever and I’m not really into Nelly. 

I took the Gordon Lightfoot songs as a sign that he had received the birthday wish. I’m not sure if the two incidents are connected, my father was not an animal person so I can’t really connect the cat to him that way. 

My question is has anyone else encountered animal apparitions or is that even a possibility?

John stated that when everyone was introduced to the new recruits on the company group chat, Rose private messaged him to find out what he was like and what he looked like. When John gave her all these details thinking it would help her feel comfortable, she stated that “he was not her type and they should remain friends” and allegedly made a remark that she’s grateful because then she’s be able to focus better. John apparently wasn’t fazed by this as he had recently been through a bad break up and wasn’t looking for someone new. Overtime he confided in her, as did she, and the became close friends.

Fast forward to 2022, John and I met and he apparently told Rose all about me as we planned a date about a month after meeting at a coffee shop. The day before our date, John messaged me saying that he was extremely upset and does not think he would be great company. When I asked why, he explained to me that Rose requested a private conference call with him requesting his assistance on a new project and she flashed him her milk jugs mid call and he ended the call because he was very upset that she betrayed him like this. I explained to him that I understand why he feels betrayed as Rose has been his close friend and confidant for over a year and has now twisted his mind after stating in the beginning that she has no interest, but he shouldn’t let her ruin the rest of his happiness and come with me tomorrow as it might cheer him up. John agreed and the next day he spent our time happy but seeming mentally occupied. I used this as an opportunity to let him talk and he explained to me that Rose was there for him when his dad passed away and when he was going through his break up with his ex girlfriend and thought that he could trust her because her intentions always seemed true. John further explained that at her previous job, she was fired because of rumours spreading around that she slept with everyone at the office including her superiors and this caused her to nearly kill herself. We spoke through this and John decided that he would block her on all platforms and requested a transfer to a different branch.

For the next few months, his transfer was denied and instead Rose was moved to a different branch. A week or so before her move, Rose showed up at the coffee shop that John and I were at, and while I was at the counter ordering, she had a brief conversation with him and I watch from the counter as I have never seen Rose in person before but thought it was odd that John immediately became furious when he seen her. For context, John and I were at this coffee shop daily during our lunch and he previously informed her of this when they still communicated. When I arrived with our order, Rose had already left the coffee shop and when I asked John who was that he said it was just a friend coming to apologise to him. I was not aware that this was Rose until later on.

Unbeknownst to me, John and Rose began talking like friends again and he was even helping her with her assignments at the new branch as well. I started noticing that she kept popping up on my suggestions, which my cousin informed me that it meant she was stalking my account and seems that she was following him on social media as well as his brother (who I have never met). Due to a separate issue that occurred between John and I, we took a 5 day break and had not communicated in that time. After a truce meet up, John made it aware to me that he was talking to Rose and she helped him out through our break by reassuring him that he would be okay (I’m not sure of their exact conversation). I didn’t think anything of it until I noticed that they were messaging with heart emojis and she called him different pet names, but from her social media activity, that seemed normal for her so I did not think anything of it.

One day in 2023, John and I were sitting at a restaurant and while I was looking at something he showed me in his photos, I seen a picture of Rose, sitting fully nude with her legs spread open for the picture. I handed John his phone back with the picture in full view and he was immediately fuming. I said nothing and let him handle it but he just proceeded to eat and remained quiet for the rest of the day. After our date, I confronted him about the picture and asked him if it was Rose as I did not clearly see who it was and he said yes. I asked him why is she sending him these messages and he said that she is doing this again like before and this time he would not forgive her. I told him that he should make her feel guilty and tell her that I found it and she has caused our relationship to end. Later that evening Rose messaged me on social media apologizing for everything she had done and begged me to not leave John as he has threatened to end their friendship. Keep in mind I do not follow her on any platforms and have never spoken to her directly. I messaged Rose back telling her to leave John and I alone and that if she doesn’t I would share her pictures with everyone on social media and to make sure I tag everyone that is important to her. Rose deleted her first message to me and send it to John to play victim with him. This caused a huge fight between John and I and we agreed to cut all contact with her.

The next day, I had not had the chance to block Rose while I was out with John, she messaged me again on social media with a whole essay about females sticking together and that I am so beautiful and that John would be an idiot to leave me and that she has no interest in him. At the same she was emailing John through her work email begging him to leave me and how unfair it is that she has been in his life for years and he never asked her out but fell head of heels for me. She admitted to using sexual acts to win him over and is now scared she’s going to lose him over it.

The next few weeks, she used the company emails to harass John as she knew that that he cannot block her without IT assistance which requires a superior’s permission and a formal investigation. She told John that my brother (m25) was stalking her on social media and my sister (f40) was messaging her on messenger calling her bad names. All of this was untrue as none of my family knew what was happening and my brother has no social media due to personal beliefs, but she found out about them through my social media. This was when I decided to leave social media for both John and my relationship’s sake as well as my own mental well-being as she became manipulative and cunning. A few months later she began using her social media to tell everyone at work what a psycho I am for stalking her and told the whole story as if though I was harassing her. She would show up in the area I worked and frequented to intimidate me, which was also quite a distance from her usual places as she lived a whole town over from me.

In 2024, I started noticing weird changes with John’s behaviour, like blocking his phone from my sight while typing, jumping to view notifications if we’re together, and checking his recent gallery before handing me his phone for whatever reason. FYI, I was not aware that he still kept in contact with Rose even after our pact of no contact. When I did find out through mere coincidence, he stated that it was just for work purposes as Rose went to their superiors and reported him for harassment and stated that I was stalking her. John said that he had 4 more months left with this company as his contract was ending soon and then he would not deal with her again and he is only keeping contact to keep the peace. I reluctantly agreed as I knew he had no other option as I had deleted all proof of Rose and our interactions that would prove she was the stalker. After those 4 months ended, Rose posted a story time video on social media of how she met her new boyfriend and used it to explain everything that happened with us but from her twisted point of view, failing to mention her stalking and crazy messages to both John and I. I confronted John about this and he assured me that it was over between them as he has started a new job at a new company and has cut all ties with her. I believed this until I recently saw that John added password locking to his all messaging apps and Face ID to his recently deleted photos and have been wondering if he is hiding something from me.

My husband (30) and I (29) started trying for our first baby in December. We tracked using OPK’s, BBT via Oura ring. We were fortunate to conceive naturally on our second cycle in January. I really wanted reassurance that things were progressing well even though I have no history of loss, normal 28/29 day cycles and no history of other conditions, so I started doing beta’s really early on. 

2/3/25 (12 DPO / 3w2d) - tested positive on FRER and CB digital 
2/4/25 (13 DPO / 3w3d) - first beta test - 20 (Labcorp)
2/6/25 (15 DPO / 3w5d) - 45 (Labcorp)
2/8/25 (17 DPO / 4w) - 96 (Labcorp)

Stopped testing here because my levels were doubling appropriately. I was tracking line progression but stopped because the lines would get lighter and darker and I was driving myself crazy. No pregnancy symptoms other than light tugging / tingling feeling in my lower belly. 

2/13/25 (22 DPO / 4w5d) - had really light brown spotting, only enough to see on a tissue. Went in for another beta at Labcorp and it came back at 77. We were concerned this could be a lab error because it took them 5 days to run my blood (they said it was missed). No cramping or other symptoms. Spotting stopped after 2 days. 

2/18/25 (27 DPO / 5w3d) - brown spotting started again. Went to the hospital where they took another beta and did an external and internal ultrasound. Beta came back at 168.5. Nothing could be seen on ultrasound of course, but they did note my endometrium lining was great and there were no signs of fluid in my pelvis and my tubes looked clear / healthy. 

2/20/25 (29 DPO / 5w5d) - beta came back at 223 through Labcorp. 

Started spotting after the ultrasound and began regularly spotting / bleeding light red blood. At times it looked like coffee grounds. Never any pain / cramping. 

2/22/25 (31 DPO / 6w) - beta through Labcorp dropped to 161. 

2/23/25 (32 DPO / 6w1d) - Oura ring showed my BBT dropped -5 below normal line, my HR returned to its normal levels and I began bleeding like a light to medium period with smaller clots. I assumed this was the MC happening and accepted it for what it was. I decided I would track my hCG decreases with LH strips and wait for them to fade out. Except they didn’t. 

My LH strips consistently got darker and were the darkest they had been since getting pregnant (almost a dye stealer on easy@home). My bleeding had stopped 2/25/25. Still no cramping or other pain. 

3/1/25 (38 DPO/ 7w) - went for a beta hoping to see it went down. It came back at 435. 

I know everything points to ectopic and I don’t have hope this is at all viable. I’m more so looking to see if anyone has these trends and what your outcome was (crossing my fingers everything resolves on its own - I’m so scared to lose a tube or needing to take anything to pass this). I have a note out to my obgyn for a callback tomorrow to push for another ultrasound. 

TLDR: Fluctuating beta’s, “miscarriage” bleeding, no cramps/ pain, no pregnancy symptoms aside from some more light tugging/ pulling and tingling in my lower belly. 

3w3d - 20
3w5d - 45
4w - 96
4w5d - 77 (lab error?)
5w3d - 168.5 (hospital lab)
5w5d - 223
6w - 161
7w - 435

A few weeks ago, I sought advice here regarding a trip to Southern Queensland. I'd like to share a brief report on what I enjoyed, what I didn't like as much, and what I would do differently. Overall, it was an amazing trip, and I highly recommend Australia for solo travelers.

The public transportation was excellent. I was pleasantly surprised to find that all trips in Queensland cost only 50 cents. BUY A GO CARD! It works in all of the cities in Southern QLD and makes moving around sooooo much easier. I don't think I would recommend renting a car to explore Brisbane or the Gold Coast, as the public transportation is efficient, clean, and safe. The train from Brisbane to the Gold Coast was particularly impressive. The only part of my trip where I regretted notrenting a car was between Brisbane and Noosa. I took a Greyhound bus, which was full of teenagers heading to Cairns. It felt like a party bus, and I found the noise and crowd a bit overwhelming. However, if you're in your early 20s, it might be a great way to meet new people (I saw lots of guys and gals making friends along the way!). 

**Noosa:** Visiting Noosa mid-week allowed me to book a somewhat fancy hotel at a reasonable price in a great location. While I enjoyed the hotel, I often felt underdressed in the restaurants and self-conscious about being alone among couples and families. The beaches were lovely, and the National Park was incredible. However, the food was slightly overpriced, and most tourists seemed to be other Australians. Kayaking in the everglades was a highlight of my trip, and staying just 10-20 meters from the beach was incredibly relaxing. 

**Gold Coast:** I was pleasantly surprised by the Gold Coast. While Surfer's Paradise lived up to its reputation with plenty of tourist traps, the rest of the city was actually pretty lovely. The National Park in Burleigh Heads and the beaches were stunning, with excellent authentic food options and just great for walking around at night. I stayed in Mermaid Beach, which was very relaxing, near the beach with several motel options with great cost/benefit. There is a lot of construction there to expand the tram system, but I would bet the Gold Coast will become a major international travel destination in the upcoming years (especially with the availability of flights right now). I wouldn't rent a vehicle unless you plan to explore Tamborine Mountain. I went there on a night tour to see the glow worms, which was a fun and reflective experience.   
I also had low expectations for HOTA (Home of the Arts), the local museum in the Gold Coast, but it turned out to be a wonderful place. The artworks were insightful, and the staff was attentive and passionate about sharing information.

**Brisbane:** I loved Brisbane. The city looks beautiful at night, and it's a great place to grab drinks and take a CityCat (the local ferry system) to enjoy the skyline. It's about 20-25% cheaper than North America, with amazing coffee shops, restaurants, cultural activities, museums, and concerts. The availability of Asian food and products was impressive, and the city reminded me of Europe during the summer. I also appreciated the presence of bathhouses, which I wish were more common in North America.

The main issues I encountered were personal and not related to Australia. The hostel crowd was quite young, with most people being 18-19 years old. The check-in and check-out times were inconvenient (check-in at 3-4 PM and check-out at 10 AM), and there was a lot of construction. Despite these minor issues, Australia is a fantastic place for tourism, and I don't think anyone would regret visiting.",0,1740950374.0,solotravel,0,0.5,False

So many other things have happened here as well and I’m really thinking of moving studio but I don’t want to list them as I dont want people Ik to see this. 

I guess I’m just asking, is it worth staying to maybe one day see this license that I’m starting to think is make believe?? Or should I move? would I have to start an apprenticeship all over again? (I’m in the UK btw if that makes any difference)",1,1740950350.0,TattooBeginners,0,1.0,False

I even looked on their Facebook, and Tims said for hot and cold beverages a reusable cup can be used, so I am going to show them this next time I come in if they deny me again.

I think what happened is that another member prepared my drink as I was still telling them the order, and they were too bothered to take my cup afterwards so they gave me this excuse.

* Pay is higher in Portland to correspond with the cost of living also being higher, so the math is similar.
* Portland weather is preferable to me (milder overall and lots of grey), but I can tolerate KC.
* I have deep reservations about the public disorder crisis in Portland with homelessness and addicts. I'm unclear on how well PDX has recovered since Floyd-era riots and the pandemic. From what I am reading, they are ineffective at addressing these things and now struggling with civic finances. too.
* On the other hand, I have reservations about violent crime and long-entrenched poverty in Kansas City. Portland has more property crime and public unpleasantness, but is safer in terms of violent crime.
* PDX has much better public transit, and it's not even close, though I am heartened by recent projects in KC. In Portland, no one thinks you are odd if you take public transit.
* People in Kansas City seem very welcoming to newcomers whereas Portlanders seem more bitter/resentful. In general people in KC seem to be proud of their city and optimistic about where it's headed, whereas I get the sense of that a lot of people in Portland feel like it used to be great but is less great now.
* My basic sense is that the KC metro is relatively booming economically vs more stagnancy in Portland, though a lot of KC growth is suburban and I am more of a city person.
* I don't care about ""nature"" or outdoorsy stuff. Portland is more beautiful setting-wise, but I don't ""use"" that.
* I am more moderate/heterodox politically, so Portland's extreme progressivism gives me pause, but I am also culturally more drawn to books, art, coffee, and Portlandesque cultural things than to the more ""basic"" sports/drinking/BBQ culture of KC. (Powell's alone is a draw for PDX.)

I really can't decide and I have until Tuesday. Every five minutes I feel differently, though I am grateful to have options!!

1j21pm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j21pm7/aitah_for_arguing_with_my_friend_about_standing/,AITAH for arguing with my friend about standing in her wedding?,"So my (f28) best friend, I’ll call her Bella (27f) is getting married in November. We’ve know each other since we were 15. She recently got engaged and I am so excited for her. I met almost all of my friends either before I got close enough to be a bridesmaid, one friend who didn’t have a bridal party, or after a friend got married. So this is my first time being in a bridal party. She appointed me matron of honor, and she was one of two of my maid of honors. 

We had an argument about the bridesmaid dress, because the cut was going to be constricting on all the bridesmaids (non stretch satin). I was unfair, because I said the wedding process was making her a bit mean and not herself. So I apologized and said I would size up and get it altered. Then, I tell her I’ve just been stressed because I have POTS. I got diagnosed about two years ago, but it’s been getting more consistent with flare ups the past few months. She knows this. I let her know recently in grocery stores, I can’t stand longer than 5-10 minutes in the checkout because my heart gets to 158+. She said:

“I appreciate you being concerned about the stretch aspect, I didn’t love the way you went about bringing it up but that’s fine, people see things differently, especially over text. 
I want you to help with the party as you’re able but don’t have any expectations about how involved you’ll be. Sarah could probably do everything herself and would be fine with it but I was thinking you and Hannah could have input and help as you’re able. But it doesn’t need to be a stressful thing for you. 
I just don’t see how you think I’ve been bossy, we’ve only talked about the wedding once since we went dress shopping and we just talked about makeup and flower ideas. 
I think there’s those two options for you to be seated right before the procession starts or with a groomsmen and sit in a row. We can think about it, don’t need to decide today. Either way I’m gonna need to get one of the other girls to switch the dress they are ordering. But it is understandable why you don’t think you can stand. You can still get ready with everyone and be in bridesmaid pictures. 
Let me know if you’re going to try a different size or if you wanna use the blue dress I have. I can’t change back and forth after you decide.”

I was confused about her talking about my place with standing, and sounded like I might not be a part of the bridal party in other events. I want to help plan her bachelorette and bridal party, etc. so I asked what she meant, and she said:

“Just not standing, I might would list you as an honorary bridesmaid. You’d need to come to the rehearsal and would get ready with us and be in the pictures. I just need to know that you’re for sure gonna stick to that plan cuz I’m very tired and don’t have the energy to switch it once we get it reset. There’s been a lot on my mind and I haven’t been well. And I wanna give the coordinator the right information the first time.” 

So I said wait, so I’m not a matron of honor if I can’t stand? 

She said: I just don’t know what it will be appropriate to list you as and I don’t wanna decide today because it’s a lot I’ve been having to think through.
If it says matron of honor but you sit down people will probably wonder why. But if it says honorary bridesmaid and you are sitting they won’t question it. Behind the scenes you’d be the same

I said I’d be there and in a row, and she said great, you can help Sarah (maid of honor) with ideas about the party. Hold up. So I have the duties (which I was fine with) as a matron of honor, but everyone will think I’m an honorary bridesmaid because I cannot stand? She said:

But you also want to have the title but not do the day of tasks. You’ve indicated you’re not up to doing the party work or standing there. I wanted you to have input because I know you enjoy it and you know what I like. 
I don’t need this extra stress, there’s lots of things going on with the wedding and I’ve said I don’t want to decide today. As much as I love you there’s more to the wedding than just this and I’ve already switched things around to make you happy. I think being upset about the title is unreasonable at this point when you want to help with the party but don’t want to do the wedding day tasks.”

I said I absolutely want to help with wedding day tasks! Yea, it is a title, but the titles come with expectations, and it felt a bit wrong to be some hidden matron of honor because of standing issues. The last message she sent me was this:

“It just seems like you should be thankful I’m willing to rework things for you rather than asking me about a title in the program when you’re not even going to be doing the typical job that goes with the title that day. When I’ve said I can’t do any more today. I didn’t ask you to do the work for the party either, I said I’d tell Sarah to take your input.”


Am ITA? Yes, it’s a title. But it’s also feels ableist to demote me for literally being unable to stand when I made it clear I was 100% ready to help plan her bridal shower and bachelorette party, get whatever coffee she needed that’d morning, help with makeup, etc. All because “people would wonder why the matron of honor is sitting.” 

It’s like I don’t even deserve the title of matron of honor and demoted to HONORARY bridesmaid after being her best friend for thirteen years. Thank y’all.  ",1,1740950228.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

1j21op3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrachmaCoin/comments/1j21op3/what_is_blockchain_a_beginners_guide_to_the_tech/,What is Blockchain? A Beginner’s Guide to the Tech Powering Crypto.,"Hey Drachma Community, 🦉

If you’re new to the world of cryptocurrency, you’ve probably heard the word **blockchain** buzzing around—but what does it actually mean? Don’t worry, we’re here to break it down for you in a way that’s simple, fun, and easy to grasp. Using everyday analogies, we’ll explain the basics of blockchain—the technology that powers coins like **Drachma ($DRH)**—and show you why it’s such a game-changer. Plus, we’ll sprinkle in a little about how Drachma uses the lightning-fast Solana blockchain to bring this tech to life. Ready? Let’s jump in!

# 1. Blockchain: Your Digital Notebook That Never Lies

Picture a **big notebook** where every page records a list of transactions—like “Alice sent 5 DRH to Bob” or “Bob bought a coffee with 2 DRH.” Now imagine this notebook isn’t kept by one person or bank but shared with thousands of people all over the world. Everyone gets an identical copy, and once something is written in it, no one can erase or change it. That’s blockchain in a nutshell—a **digital ledger** that’s transparent, secure, and permanent.

* **How it works:** Every time a transaction happens, it’s written on a new page (called a **block**). These pages are linked together in a chain, and each one is locked with a special code. Copies of this chain are stored on lots of computers (called **nodes**) worldwide, so no single person controls it.
* **Why it’s awesome:** Because it’s shared and locked, it’s super hard to trick the system. If someone tries to sneak in a fake transaction, all the other copies would disagree, and the network would catch it instantly.

**2. Blocks: Pages That Stick Together**

Each **block** is like a page in our notebook. It holds:

* A bunch of transactions (e.g., “Charlie sent 10 DRH to Dana”).
* A unique code called a **hash** (think of it as a fingerprint for that page).
* The hash of the previous page, connecting them like a chain of paper clips.

Here’s the cool part: if someone tries to mess with an old page—like changing “10 DRH” to “100 DRH”—it would mess up the hash and break the chain. The network would notice and say, “Nope, not allowed!” This chaining trick makes blockchain crazy secure.

# 3. No Boss, Just Teamwork

Unlike a bank where one company calls the shots, blockchain has **no boss**. It’s **decentralized**, meaning everyone in the network works together to keep it honest.

* **Analogy:** Imagine planning a party with friends. You all vote on the snacks, and only when most agree do you add “pizza” to the shopping list. In blockchain, computers use rules (like **proof-of-stake**, which Drachma’s Solana blockchain uses) to agree on transactions. Once approved, they’re added to the ledger.
* **Why it rocks:** No single point of failure! Hack one computer? The rest keep going. This teamwork builds trust without needing a middleman.

# 4. Transparency: A Window for All to See

Blockchain is like a **glass piggy bank**—everyone can peek inside and see what’s happening.

* **Real example:** With a tool like [SolScan](https://solscan.io/), you can check out Drachma ($DRH) transactions live. Want to see how many tokens are out there or who’s holding them? It’s all public!
* **Why it’s a big deal:** This openness proves everything is legit. Drachma, for instance, shares details like token vesting schedules (when holders can access their coins) so you know exactly what’s up.

# 5. Immutability: Written in Digital Stone

Once something’s on the blockchain, it’s **stuck there forever**, like carving your name into a tree trunk.

* **How it stays safe:** The hash-linking we mentioned earlier means changing one block would require rewriting every block after it. On a fast blockchain like Solana, which Drachma uses, that’s like trying to repaint a moving train—impossible!
* **Everyday use:** This permanence is why blockchain can track things like who owns a house, where your food came from, or even how many DRH tokens someone holds.

# 6. Smart Contracts: Vending Machines for Code

Blockchain isn’t just about coins—it can run **smart contracts**, which are like **digital vending machines**. Drop in the right amount of tokens, and out comes your reward—no human needed!

* **Example:** Drachma’s smart contract on Solana locks in rules, like “no extra tokens can be made,” and it runs automatically. You can trust it because the code doesn’t lie.
* **Why it’s huge:** It cuts out intermediaries, saving time and money. Think instant ticket sales or automatic payments—all powered by blockchain.

# 7. Drachma and Solana: A Perfect Match

Not all blockchains are the same. Drachma runs on **Solana**, a blockchain that’s fast, affordable, and eco-friendly.

* **Analogy:** If Bitcoin is a trusty old bike and Ethereum is a car stuck in traffic, Solana’s a rocket ship—zooming through thousands of transactions per second with almost no cost.
* **Why Drachma loves it:** Solana’s speed and security make it ideal for a growing project like ours. Whether you’re trading DRH or joining our community, it’s smooth and cheap.

# 8. Beyond Crypto: Blockchain in Real Life

Blockchain isn’t just for digital money—it’s popping up everywhere:

* **Supply chains:** Follow a banana from the farm to your plate.
* **Voting:** Make elections cheat-proof.
* **NFTs:** Prove you own a one-of-a-kind digital artwork.

Drachma’s team is excited to explore these ideas as we build our future—stay tuned!

# 9. How to Jump In

Want to try blockchain yourself? Here’s a quick start:

1. **Get a wallet:** Download Phantom or Solflare (they work with Solana).
2. **Grab some SOL:** Buy Solana’s token on an exchange like Binance or Kraken.
3. **Swap for DRH:** Use a decentralized exchange like Raydium to get Drachma tokens.
4. **Say hi:** Join us at [r/DrachmaCoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrachmaCoin/) to chat and learn!

# 10. Why Blockchain Changes Everything

Blockchain is a **trust machine**. It’s handing power back to people by cutting out the middlemen and making everything transparent. Projects like Drachma are riding this wave, building on Solana to create a community that’s open, innovative, and ready for the future.

1j21nrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/EctopicSupportGroup/comments/1j21nrr/ectopic_limbo_any_similar_stories/,Ectopic Limbo - Any Similar Stories?,"Apologies for the long post, but I haven’t found any stories from people in a similar situation to me. 

My husband (30) and I (29) started trying for our first baby in December. We tracked using OPK’s, BBT via Oura ring. We were fortunate to conceive naturally on our second cycle in January. I really wanted reassurance that things were progressing well even though I have no history of loss, normal 28/29 day cycles and no history of other conditions, so I started doing beta’s really early on. 

2/3/25 (12 DPO / 3w2d) - tested positive on FRER and CB digital 
2/4/25 (13 DPO / 3w3d) - first beta test - 20 (Labcorp)
2/6/25 (15 DPO / 3w5d) - 45 (Labcorp)
2/8/25 (17 DPO / 4w) - 96 (Labcorp)

Stopped testing here because my levels were doubling appropriately. I was tracking line progression but stopped because the lines would get lighter and darker and I was driving myself crazy. No pregnancy symptoms other than light tugging / tingling feeling in my lower belly. 

2/13/25 (22 DPO / 4w5d) - had really light brown spotting, only enough to see on a tissue. Went in for another beta at Labcorp and it came back at 77. We were concerned this could be a lab error because it took them 5 days to run my blood (they said it was missed). No cramping or other symptoms. Spotting stopped after 2 days. 

2/18/25 (27 DPO / 5w3d) - brown spotting started again. Went to the hospital where they took another beta and did an external and internal ultrasound. Beta came back at 168.5. Nothing could be seen on ultrasound of course, but they did note my endometrium lining was great and there were no signs of fluid in my pelvis and my tubes looked clear / healthy. 

2/20/25 (29 DPO / 5w5d) - beta came back at 223 through Labcorp. 

Started spotting after the ultrasound and began regularly spotting / bleeding light red blood. At times it looked like coffee grounds. Never any pain / cramping. 

2/22/25 (31 DPO / 6w) - beta through Labcorp dropped to 161. 

2/23/25 (32 DPO / 6w1d) - Oura ring showed my BBT dropped -5 below normal line, my HR returned to its normal levels and I began bleeding like a light to medium period with smaller clots. I assumed this was the MC happening and accepted it for what it was. I decided I would track my hCG decreases with LH strips and wait for them to fade out. Except they didn’t. 

My LH strips consistently got darker and were the darkest they had been since getting pregnant (almost a dye stealer on easy@home). My bleeding had stopped 2/25/25. Still no cramping or other pain. 

3/1/25 (38 DPO/ 7w) - went for a beta hoping to see it went down. It came back at 435. 

I know everything points to ectopic and I don’t have hope this is at all viable. I’m more so looking to see if anyone has these trends and what your outcome was (crossing my fingers everything resolves on its own - I’m so scared to lose a tube or needing to take anything to pass this). I have a note out to my obgyn for a callback tomorrow to push for another ultrasound. 

TLDR: Fluctuating beta’s, “miscarriage” bleeding, no cramps/ pain, no pregnancy symptoms aside from some more light tugging/ pulling and tingling in my lower belly. 

3w3d - 20
3w5d - 45
4w - 96
4w5d - 77 (lab error?)
5w3d - 168.5 (hospital lab)
5w5d - 223
6w - 161
7w - 435

Prior to marriage he would make an effort to take me out on dates and he did a bit after we got married for the first 2 months. Then it all stopped.
He used to tell me while dating how he wants to take me out to restaurants he’s never been to before. How he wants to keep taking me out on dates after we get married.
I understand sometimes finances can be an issue but there are many times we have the money and he says “I’m trying to save every dollar we have” or “Well, I don’t know where to take you, I don’t know what you like.” 🙄 

I have been going through a really hard time lately, any time I open up it feels like he dismisses my feelings. He will ask me what he can do to help but then make it seem like whatever I’m going through is no big deal. Any time he is going through something I’m always there to listen to him and give him my support and advice.

For Valentine’s Day he got me nothing. Claiming he doesn’t know what I like and how much it hurt him that he didn’t know what to do for me that it made him cry…it’s true I have closed myself up but he does know what I like. He would rather tell me he cried than go to the store and get me flowers or chocolates. I did buy him something small for valentines - his favorite candy.

He did surprise me a few days ago with flowers, coffee and breakfast. It was very thoughtful but by then I was getting bad anxiety attacks that make it very hard for me to eat in the mornings.

It’s so hard to open up to him. He talks mainly about himself, his issues and interrupts me so much I can hardly get a word in. It been draining me.

1j21moi,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1j21moi/how_to_grind_through_a_workday_with_zero_sleep/,How to grind through a workday with zero sleep (after 3 years of bad insomnia).,"Hello. This is a situation that happens sometimes for all of us, so I thought I would do a write up of what has helped me:

I find that the key to get through a day without much sleep is to treat yourself like you would treat a friend, partner or a child they were sick: 
Go easy on yourself, and allow yourself the care that you need to get through.

If you already know for sure that getting any sleep is hopeless, get out of bed early and put on some headphones and listen to some relaxing music, instead of rawdogging your own (usually negative) thoughts that come when extremely tired. 
I find lo-fi easy to listen to without it being overstimulating.

You might be tempted to slam an energy drink or espresso, however it is best to not redline your adrenal glands before you even get the day started. This will save the little dopamine you have for the day for later on.

It is a good idea to eat your normal breakfast, and if you normally don’t eat breakfast, today it is especially important to get some food like at least a fruit or a toasted bun into your system in the morning.

Drink a large serving of water first thing after waking. Hydration is key when sleep deprived (and it also helps you not look so inflamed and tired).

Take a nice warm shower if it is winter time, or a nice cool one if it is summer time. 
I would avoid a hardcore cold shower, because while it does crank out norepinephrine and dopamine, it is short lived and you will risk crashing your system before the day even starts.
In the summer time, a short cold rinse at the end of your shower can reduce face and eye puffiness significantly.

Take some magnesium, c vitamin and b vitamins, or drink an electrolyte beverage. Creatine, theanine, taurine and tyrosine can help too, if these are available to you.

Eyedrops (especially the antihistamine ones) before you leave for work will reduce eye puffiness.

You might consider taking a paracetamol or ibuprofen if you foreshadow a headache or neck stiffness later on. It is a good idea to bring some with you where you intend to go.

Bring a deodorant with you as well, as sometimes sleep disruption seems to negatively affect body odor. 

If you’re driving to work, roll the windows down and let in the fresh air upon your face.

Prioritise getting some sunlight in your face as soon as possible in the day. Even a few minutes helps a lot.

If you have arrived to work and are not yet feeling better, try drinking your first dose of caffeine. 
A low dose is preferable, as side effects like jitteriness, headaches and anxiety from caffeine are more likely to occur if one has had little to no sleep. 
You need just enough to keep afloat, not too much, or you’ll sink the boat.

It is important to keep your blood sugar stable throughout the day. Don’t overeat, but eat small snacks like fruits and granola bars ect as you grind through the day.

Disclaimer: Not a doctor. 
If I am still in a critical state by around 9-10AM,  i begin to consider whether a low dose of a more powerful stimulant is relevant to utilise (Rx modafinil for example). 
I avoid dosing these type of meds too late in the day as they can impair sleep on the tail end.

At this stage there is not much more you can do other than eating small bites of food, drinking water and sipping some coffee/energy drink.

Stop drinking caffeine at midday. Try to keep yourself awake until your normal bedtime instead of getting into bad sleep patterns.

Perhaps I could purge you from every song, every romance, every adventure that finds itself in front of me. When an author describes that beautiful, confident, witty woman.

The conversations we used to have, they sat with me much longer than I dreamed they would. It's been what, well over a year?  Yet there you are, at every turn, to remind me just how deeply unseen I am now.

I wish you'd just tell me you blocked me because a new game is afoot with someone else. I'm wounded by the wondering, I suppose. There's indicator numero uno that I'm still not over you.

I want you to be honest with me, I know how probable it is. I want you to be happy, and I recognize this is part of your nature. I'm not afraid of the truth, not as I once was.

I only ask that you tell me, so that I may be set free of the illusion that it was irreplaceable. That you were the only woman in the world who can see me.

1j21kl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/3DScanning/comments/1j21kl0/3d_scanner_recommendations_for_interior_spaces/,3D Scanner Recommendations for Interior Spaces,"Hello r/3DScanning community,

I'm currently exploring options for an affordable 3D scanner tailored to capturing interior spaces. My primary focus is on devices that can effectively scan rooms and indoor environments. Given the vast number of products available, I'm seeking your insights and recommendations based on personal experiences or knowledge.

Current Setup & Use Case:

I currently use an iPad Pro/iPhone 16 Pro with Polycam for scanning. I typically export using meshes, but I’m curious if exporting as a point cloud would be beneficial for post-processing in a separate program before importing into SketchUp (my program of choice for modeling). If anyone has experience with different export formats and their impact on workflow efficiency, I’d love to hear your thoughts.

I primarily scan restaurants, coffee shops, industrial kitchens, and other commercial spaces for remodels and equipment upgrades. Given that stainless steel is a major component in these environments, I've encountered issues with reflections, which often interfere with scan accuracy. I've tried some DIY matte sprays with some success, but if anyone has suggestions for other solutions or specific recipes for reducing reflectivity, I’d love to hear them.

Key Considerations:

Accuracy and Precision: Looking for a scanner that can achieve 2-5mm accuracy or better to ensure reliable measurements.

Portability: A compact and lightweight design would be beneficial for scanning multiple locations.

Budget: Preferably under 1,500€, but I'm open to slightly higher-priced options if they offer significant value.

Range vs. Cost: Most options I've found seem to have either limited range, prohibitively high pricing (in the five-digit range), or are over-specced with extreme precision (e.g., 0.2 mm accuracy, which I don’t necessarily need). I'm looking for something that balances range, affordability, and practical accuracy for my use case.

Devices I've Come Across:

Shining 3D Einstar – A handheld scanner offering 0.1 mm accuracy and full-color scanning. Priced under $1,000, it seems well-suited for medium to large object scanning. Has anyone used this for rooms?

Revopoint POP 3 – Portable, with a resolution of 0.05 mm, capable of scanning objects up to 2.5 meters. Seems user-friendly and versatile.

Creality CR Scan Ferret – Entry-level, 0.16 mm resolution, more budget-friendly but with some trade-offs in precision.

3DMakerPro Eagle – A LiDAR-based scanner with a scanning radius of up to 70 meters and an accuracy of 2 cm at 10 meters. I’m particularly curious about its real-world accuracy closer to the 10-meter mark. Does anyone have experience using this for interior spaces or larger environments?

Mobile App Alternatives:

I'm also considering LiDAR-based mobile apps for scanning:

Polycam – Uses LiDAR and photogrammetry; supports exporting to multiple formats (BIM, CAD, etc.).

RoomScan Pro – Focused on interior scans, creates floor plans and 3D room models.

Seeking Advice:

Personal Experiences: Have you used any of the above scanners or apps for indoor scanning? How did they perform in terms of accuracy and usability?

Alternative Recommendations: Are there any other budget-friendly scanners or apps you'd suggest?

Point Cloud vs. Mesh Exports: Would exporting as a point cloud improve post-processing before importing into SketchUp?

Reflective Surface Solutions: What are the best methods or materials to reduce reflections in scans, particularly for stainless steel?

Scanner Range vs. Price: Have you found any scanners that balance reasonable range and accuracy without entering the five-digit price range?

Optimizing iPhone Scanning: Are there any specific techniques, apps, or settings that could improve scan quality and accuracy when using an iPhone 16 Pro with Polycam?

Tips and Best Practices: Any advice on optimizing scans for interior spaces, particularly with budget equipment?

I recently got a position with the San Diego VA/UCSD so my husband and I will be moving to SD in June! I will primarily be at the main VA hospital in the La Jolla Village area as well as a clinic in Kearny Mesa. I may also be at the UCSD location in Hillcrest. My husband and I are both in our early 30s and have one doggo (65 lbs). We are fairly outdoorsy and like to hike, bike, mtn bike, go on walks (excited to walk all the beaches!), and just explore generally. We also like to try new restaurants, we love coffee and a good cocktail/brewery, and are pretty social. We are hoping to live somewhere that is fairly walkable, both to take our dog on walks around the neighborhood, but that might also be walking distance to some nice restaurants/shops. *Ideally,* wherever we live also wouldn't be too horrible of a commute for me (my husband is fully remote that lucky SOB), though I recognize that I will probably have some level of a frustrating commute. From my understanding and limited research so far, it seems like the commute going north in the morning and south in the evening is awful.

Also, the position is only one year and we would likely move back to our home in Oregon after the year. This has pros and cons ofc but I do feel like it will make it easy to really enjoy the year! Our dog looooves the beach and since we'll only be here for a year and it might be our only opportunity to live within minutes of an ocean, I am definitely fantasizing about living near one of the beaches, though I've also read those areas are geared more toward the post-college crowd. Also, I'm worried the commute from PB or Ocean Beach up to La Jolla and Kearny Mesa would be truly awful and I'm not sure I'm willing to do that.

All this said, any advice on neighborhoods you would recommend/commuting from those neighborhoods to my work locations is greatly appreciated! Thank you all in advance!!",2,1740949784.0,Moving2SanDiego,7,1.0,False

I am a 22 year old woman, not overweight but nearing the top of what is considered a healthy weight for my height (5’2” at 132lb). I have a beach trip coming at the beginning of June, and I’d like to lose around 10 pounds before then. I have tried many times to lose a bit of weight, but I’m never very successful. I understand my TDEE, the fact that it is really just calories in calories out, and that unfortunately because of my height the only way to lose weight is to do so slowly because otherwise I will not get to eat very much. 

I think the biggest issue I have is with stopping eating when I really enjoy food. I don’t binge eat, I just tend to want to eat more than when my body is usually comfortably full, which is what I think hinders me the most. I know volume eating is really good, and I do love a lot of healthy low calorie vegetables and fruits etc, but unfortunately it just never seems to keep from wanting to eat more of what isn’t healthy. I know myself well and I know that if I attempt to just cut out food I like and actually want to eat I will just completely quit. I’ve tried to do OMAD before and just eat at dinner time, but I work at a grocery store so it’s really difficult to avoid food all day when I’m super hungry. 

I recently have been trying to eat a smaller & healthier breakfast and lunch that saves most of my calories for dinner, and that works sometimes, but I still just always want to eat more! I always want another plate, even if I know I probably don’t need it. And don’t get my started on wanting sweet treats lmao. I’m very good about not drinking my calories unless it’s coffee, and since that keeps my appetite down it’s usually not a big deal & I don’t do that every day. I also don’t drink alcohol often enough for it to be a big deal either. I just have such a hard time not eating more! I grew up loving food and it’s a big comfort to me (also probably not helpful), and I’m not really sure how to get better at listening to my body when it’s full other than pure force of willpower (which I am clearly not good at, since I’ve been trying to lose this weight since I was 17).

My family has tried to take extreme measures to get him to go to CAMH or a mental institution but he refuses because in his head he thinks he is ok. We also have taken him to the hospital but since he does not pose an immediate threat to us or the public, they cannot do anything with him unless he admits himself, which he will not do. We even kicked him out for a few days and even being homeless he would not admit himself.

He has very messy habits and no matter how many times you tell him to do something (for example clean up after himself), he will always have a hard time taking initiative. We also have called the police to our home multiple times so they can help when he is having a bad day but again, since he does not pose an immediate threat, they do not do anything about it.

These delicate white blooms aren’t just a beautiful sight on coffee farms—they’re **nature’s way of signaling what’s to come**. Here’s why they matter:

✅ **Bloom Timing:** The timing of flowering gives farmers clues about **harvest schedules** and how much coffee they can expect.  
✅ **Flower Density:** More flowers = a potentially larger yield. But factors like climate shifts can still impact the final crop.  
✅ **Flavor & Quality Indicators:** Healthy flowering often leads to **better-developed beans**, influencing the final cup’s flavor profile.

At **Jones Ranch Coffee**, we work directly with coffee farmers in **El Salvador, Guatemala, and Colombia** to ensure the best possible harvest makes it into your cup. 🌱

Is there some unspoken rule that shows with more than seven seasons must have the worst endings known to mankind? Maybe I’m dramatic, maybe I’m biased, but it didn’t make sense. It felt forced. The whole fate of the firm felt forced, because wtf were those five names doing on the door? Disgusting. But Harvey..
I don’t know exactly what he should have done, but I know what he wouldn’t have.
Harvey Specter wasn’t leaving without a fight. He wasn’t packing up for Seattle. He wasn’t walking away from everything,  his reputation, his legacy to sip coffee with his wife. (A wife I never even thought he’d have in the first place mind you)
To begin with,
New York was Harvey Specter. “The best closer THIS CITY has ever seen.” He thrived on power, on prestige. He wouldn’t have left his firm, let alone for some small-tier operation. That firm was his pride, his name, his life’s work. He insulted second rate firms for a decade. When Scottie hit him with, “Pearson Hardman… one office, one city,” his answer was, “One office, THE city.”

And he gave all that up ? ...for love? No.

And the writers knew they messed up. They were selfaware enough to let Louis say, 

Harvey, you never wanted to play in the B-leagues?

 And Harvey’s response to that was smth like “I wanna play for the good guys for a change.” I BEG YOUR FINEST PARDON.
For years, it was set in stone that Harvey wasn’t doing any of that. Tanner mocked the idea of it when he taunted Scottie, “You really thought you could tame him? Harvey flipping burgers on the weekends?” And yet, here we are. It was meant to be so unrealistic, it was a joke. They actually did just that. 
Forget the legacy. Forget the prestige. Forget everything he fought to protect. They basically retired him.

We just finished a 9 day Western Caribbean cruise on Jewel of the Seas. We are a mid 40’s couple who traveled kid free. Embark and disembark process: Both were super easy. Embarking was quick and easy. If you have a passport they take your pic with a scanner so you can leave quicker than the birth certificate only line when it’s time to disembark. We chose to self disembark which means you keep your bags and carry them off the ship. They said to be at the theater at 8:00 but we went down at 7:30 and there was already a line. We started leaving at 7:30 and we were at our car by 7:45. We parked in the North lot right by the RC building. We don’t drink much, so we got the refreshment package. It was fun trying the mocktails and they were all delicious. The package included Cafe Lattitudes and we got lots of lattes, hot cocoa, hot tea, Red Bulls, Powerade’s, and bottles of water there. We ate at the MDR almost every night. We chose the 5:00 time since we eat dinner early typically. Food was good, we aren’t picky. It was what I would expect food to be that has to feed 2000 people. Shrimp pad Thai was my fave dish. We liked the smaller portions in the MDR since we don’t eat a ton. We had Mikhail and Bogdon as server and assistant each night. They were amazing servers, zero complaints. We ate at Windjammer all breakfast meals. Coffee is decent, not very strong imo. Any breakfast food you could want they had, same offerings each day. We ate at Windjammer for lunch a couple of days, decent food. They can make a great fried rice and all kinds of curries, those were definitely my favorites. We ate at Chops for one lunch, it was delicious. I got it on sale for about $20/pp which is the most I would pay because we didn’t dislike the MDR or Windjammer options. People seem to love the Solarium. In our opinion, it is tiny and smells funny. I’m not sure how people kick it in there but they seem to love it. There is only one pool and it’s also not big at all, mainly kids using it. The staff is outstanding. Everyone is super friendly and accommodating. Our room steward, Alan, was awesome. There are lots of places to sit on deck and listen to the ocean. One regret we have is not getting a balcony room. If we cruise again that will be mandatory. While the room was larger than we thought it would be (Ocean View), we both agreed having a balcony would be amazing. We spent a lot of time sitting on the deck to get out of the room. We would go to the helipad at night and look at all of the stars. Climbed the rock wall a couple of times, super fun. 
The Centrum is small and is where a lot of activities are but they didn’t interest us much. The shows are decent, we went to a few. The Casino reeked of cigarette smoke that could be smelled even from across the hall. We cannot handle the smell so avoided it. We would have gambled if there had been a smoke free area. 
Excursions:
Progresso was canceled bc of high winds so we had an extra sea day. Boooo!! 
Cozumel - honey, chocolate, tequila tour. It was decent, each location was a short demo and a chance to spend money. The highlight was an unscheduled stop to a beach side restaurant for lunch. We got shrimp quesadillas, chips and guacamole, and coconut water in a coconut. Was amazing!! We also bought some mango sipping tequila that is delicious. The ship takes any alcohol purchased and gives it to you at the end of the cruise so keep that in mind when purchasing liquor. 
Costa Maya - Bacalar 7 Colors Lagoon: it was a pretty long drive on a bus, maybe an hour or so. From the bus, we got in a boat at a beach restaurant and drove around a deep cenote, then took a swim in the shallow fresh water lagoon. The boat took us back to the restaurant for a delicious lunch. Only drawback was the short amount of time to swim, maybe an hour. 
Belize - long bus ride, about 1.5 hours, to the Lamanai Mayan ruins. From the bus we got on a boat at a resort to the ruins. Then back to the restaurant by boat for a Belize style lunch, was so good! Got soursop juice and a soursop smoothie, a local fruit we had never heard of. Delicious! 
Roatan - very short 15 bus ride to Sol y Mar beach. This beach was super shallow clear water. We snorkeled and saw tons of fish and got a huge about of sea shells. It had a bar with all you can drink, and a delicious buffet lunch. This excursion and the ruins were our favorite for sure. 
We pretty much loved getting off the boat and seeing places but didn’t really love sea days. The only downside to seeing places is all of the poverty, it made me sad to see it. Jewel is definitely a low key ship for relaxing so keep that in mind if you choose this ship. We are already excited to cruise again, on a bigger ship with a balcony room.  We did try to get a balcony with Royal Up but didn’t bid enough, lesson learned though - balcony next time. ",3,1740948882.0,royalcaribbean,2,1.0,False

If you've managed this please talk to me.

I don't need a primer on executive functioning. I understand WHY this is hard for me but I want to figure out what to do about it. And yes **I am on medication** and I'm pretty sure the dose is right. When I have a direction, it works very well. My problem seems to be picking a direction.

I feel stuck in a sort of cyclical trap. **My time is unstructured. I am completely free of expectations weekday mornings to 1pm, and evenings from 8pm.** Outside of those times, I have direct responsibility for children (shared with husband during weekends and weekday evenings ~5-8pm). At least one also has ADHD so this is draining.

**What I tend to do with my ""free"" time - sleep in late, sit around on the computer scrolling** the endless dopamine factory (internet). Read a lot of content/books/engage in discussions about neurodiversity and parenting. Write a huge amount on forums. Feed myself and attend to personal hygiene - a bit less than I should (for both). Occasionally feel an attack of guilt or a burst of motivation and run through some overdue chores or get sidetracked into extremely deep cleaning a tiny corner of the house that nobody will ever notice or care about. Go on an evening out, or a coffee morning, when somebody else organises it.

What I vaguely think I ""should"" do with my free time - a combination of more productive things, working on my own goals, getting things done while my kids are out of the house, plus some downtime.

What **I want to do - an impossible number of things** such that I don't make any meaningful progress on any of them. I KNOW this is a problem and I've successfully picked 3 things at other times to focus on and that has worked well for me, but **I can't seem to pick anything or stick to it** at the moment. If I do pick three things, I forget what I have picked, or I keep arguing with myself about what counts as coming under that umbrella.

**I don't know how to decide what should be ""productive time"" and what should be ""downtime""**. I lose total and utter track of weeks/months/days and then feel like garbage when I realise how many have passed since I said I would do something. Because I haven't proactively decided this, **I don't have any specific time when I sit and plan out my day**/week/whatever. If I do this spontaneously, it's all over the place and I will likely never look at the plan again anyway. **I feel so daunted by trying to set up a system for managing this**, but nothing I've found pre-made seems to work for me - it's all too loose or too detailed (I think because I probably need detailed but I need to build up to it, it's too overwhelming to start with detailed).

**Do I just need to fill my time?** ie, find a job/course which is going to occupy some of those mornings or evenings? (I know this is a privilege, which just makes me feel guiltier for ""wasting"" it).

Am I burnt out/depressed? (Musing, not asking for a diagnosis) **Do I need therapy or an ADHD coach or something?**

* you will be able to claim 3 months *premium* membership for **free** which provides **worldwide family travel insurance** when booking travel on the card and also 5 points per £1 spent.
* From my rough calculations, this correlates to somewhere in the region of 2 to 3% cash back dependent on the experience
* You’ll also be able to get Mastercard foreign exchange fees (i.e essentially the best fees you can get when abroad, akin to cards like Chase/Monzo/Revolut) and purchase protection, which is a **huge perk** and means you can get 2-3% cash back on **holiday spends**!

To sign up, you can go through the referral link (or any referral link!) and follow the steps. 

**Application Process** (Including Hard Credit Check)

1. Download Yonder App using the [referral link](https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx)
2. Verify Your Email & Details: Provide accurate information for verification.
3. Give some initial info and it performs a soft credit check to determine if you are eligible. If not, it will say so, so no need for a hard check.
4. Link Your Main Bank Accounts: This step ensures Yonder can offer you an appropriate credit limit.
5. Complete Identity Check: Take a quick selfie and provide a valid government-issued ID.
6. Undergo a Hard Credit Check: As with any credit card application, a hard check will be performed on your credit report.
7. Done

You can also cancel before the 3 months premium ends to avoid the subscription renewing and once you’ve spent all the points on experiences, and switch to a free card or just cancel the card.

On the whole I’m really enjoying Yonder and hope you will too! I’m enjoying so much so that I’m I've continued using the subscription after my first 3 months premium free (and I also use it on top of my AMEX). The nice thing is it tends to be **accepted everywhere** that AMEX is not (because it's Mastercard) and you can spend abroad without a transaction fee.

1j20tb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BenignExistence/comments/1j20tb2/my_friends_in_my_digital_social_life_are_keeping/,My friends in my digital social life are keeping me company after surgery.,"Most of my closest friends are long distance, and I’m a member of a few discord communities. I’ve been really nervous about my surgery because I only have a few people local to me who can help, and I’ll be on crutches for nearly 2 months (thank you organ and tissue donors, my surgeon built me a new ankle from cadaver grafts). I didn’t want to over-burden them with being my only physical and social support.

And to my delight, there has just been this lovely outpouring of support and care from my friends that I only know digitally. Keeping me company through text or inviting me to join their gaming chat channels (even though I’m not playing with them), sending me memes, becoming snail mail pen pals. My other long distance friends setting up buddy reads and watch parties for me to call into, or just calling to say hi.

I’ve had a few surgeries that were lonely, painful, isolating things. And this time there’s this community of people carrying me around in their pocket, inviting me to join their day to day life, telling me about a really great sandwich they had or taking a picture to send me from their hike. Telling me which book I should read, like we’re standing together in a shop drinking fancy coffee.

I’m so grateful.

Since then, I’ve tackled my first-ever DIY car projects—changing the rotors, touching up paint to remove rust, and even fixing small cracks on the windshield. Sure, some of my paintwork wasn’t perfect, and it took me hours to swap out the front and rear pads and rotors (got a wrench stuck between bolts), but I wouldn’t trade the experience for anything.

After a lifetime of driving ""normal"" cars (with a 2013 Mini Cooper being the most interesting car I’ve owned), I can say without a doubt that this is the most fun I’ve ever had behind the wheel. Every drive puts a smile on my face, and what makes it even better is the car community.

Since joining, I’ve already made new friends, learned so much, and even had my first drag race! This wouldn’t have been the same without the support of my friends and the FT86 community.

So, I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you all!

I spend most of my 20s studying (4 years bachelor+2years masters part time) and from 23 onwards working full time. I never had time for parties or being around women my age.

1j20p93,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee/comments/1j20p93/an_honest_review_of_gcgc_from_a_gpgp_pioneer/,"An honest review of GCGC, from a GPGP pioneer","TL;DR: GCGC has no real competitor, the team is amazing and deserves a LOT more credit, and some of y’all need to tone down the entitlement.

Longer version:
“I was there when it was written!” I cry, recalling the first time I dragged the banner onto my new pizza shop. Within a matter of months, I reached the end of Good Pizza Great Pizza, having defeated Alicante after feeding the homeless Bear Whisperer. I thought that was it…until I saw “Chapter 1” one day. Then there came Chapter 2…3…4: from eggplant vase to entire garden plots, shop customisation, multiplayer, pizza DELIVERY???, the WORKS.

So TRUSTTTT when I say that I’ve been super eager for Good Coffee Great Coffee the DAY it was announced. Months of waiting, watching early access livestreams and even trying to find a way to play it anyway from sketchy modded APKs.

Was I peeved by the bugs and limited initial release? Sure, but GCGC had the core step-by-step order mechanics and cryptic orders that I adored about GPGP. The milk steaming and coffee ground stamping could have made me cry from how realistic it was, from playing an abandoned barista game (RIP Barista Simulator).

The energy system, slow EXP growth, inconsistent waiting times and drink grading were confusing and frustrating at times. But I had full trust that the devs would fix all but the first two.

As days of playing passed, I understood why the energy systems and EXP growth made sense. It seemed like forever when the GPGP game would get story expansions. You would have every topping and oven upgrades before the story chapter was up.

Then the big streamers raved about GPGP as this cutesy cosy pizza shop sim game (in the midst of tens of store simulators), and we had all the younger newer players in the pool. I saw the GPGP community becoming more toxic with demands and complaints for more content.

Comparing to several energy system games I’ve played, GCGC is actually pretty generous. Each day isn’t super short (especially with faster/upgraded machines and the longer days upgrade) and there’s arguably more intricate core mechanics in GCGC than GPGP. In Chapter 1 ALONE, we have 15 ingredients and at least 22 different recipes. (Meanwhile GPGP Wiki states just 9 ingredients up to eggplant.)

If one takes their time to learn the mechanics and savour the latte art mechanics, the milk steaming, and espresso brewing, GCGC is hands-down the most complex coffeeshop game out there, especially on MOBILE! It’s a far cry from the first time I played a coffee shop game - literally an online Flash game lemonade stand remade with a coffee stand setting.

It breaks my heart that the TapBlaze team obviously poured their blood, sweat, tears and hearts into both GCGC and GPGP, and got so freaking GOOD at designing their games only to get so much heat from too many entitled players who have no idea or appreciation of the work they do.

Bottom line: cut the devs some slack. They are trying their best, most likely pulling all-nighters with a small-medium studio team (11-50 employees). The best and easiest thing we can do as players, paying with real money or not, is to give the team due credit, be patient and share the word of their amazing work.",29,1740947682.0,GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee,0,1.0,False

Alcohol is even worse, it’s nothing for me to have to pee before I even finish the drink. It’s like the drinks run straight through me.

Edit: adding more context. Maybe I just drink a lot? I have 2-3 cups of coffee in the morning. 1-2 water bottles during the day, a diet soft drink around dinner, tea/water in the evenings.

**New full length video out today!**

Are you a shy woman who struggles to talk to attractive men? You're not alone. Many women feel awkward and unsure of how to approach guys, especially in a world where men are expected to do all the initiating. But times have changed, and waiting for the right guy to magically notice you isn’t a reliable strategy.

In this video, I break down why men actually appreciate being approached (hint: it almost never happens to them), how to shift your mindset from seeking validation to *giving* confidence, and a step-by-step guide to building your social confidence—starting with small, manageable interactions. You don’t have to go from zero to flirting overnight. Instead, I’ll show you how to gradually increase your comfort level so that one day, hitting on a guy feels as easy as ordering coffee.

Confidence isn’t about eliminating nerves—it’s about acting despite them. If you’re tired of sitting on the sidelines of your own dating life, this video is for you.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to know any additional info about any of those games - I would be happy to help you out!

**My Favourites**

1.[ Best Served Cold](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3218530/Best_Served_Cold/) \- Detective VN - the best demo I got to play! This is similar to Coffee Talk, but you work in an underground bar, cooperating with a detective to solve cases in a city with Romanian and Eastern European influences. The premise was very interesting to me and the game holds up - it's very interactive, the main goal is to serve your clients (suspects), listen to what they tell you about themselves, their lives and careers, and goad them into telling you more.. incriminating information - gossip simulator, truly! I did not encounter any bugs or issues at all and believe this game is ready for a full release. If there is any game on this list you find interesting and consider looking into, let it be this one :)

2.[ Whisper of the House](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2595130/Whisper_of_the_House_Demo/) \- Casual, Puzzle - For those of us (me) who never moved on from Unpacking! This game uses the same mechanisms of decorating, but on a larger scale: you get to live in an actual city and decorate houses through your job as an interior decorator/unpacker! This is exactly the type of game I wanted back when Unpacking came out, and I'm very happy someone liked the idea as well. However, the game does have a slightly darker premise, as there are various spooky things happening in the city and houses you decorate. The devs have removed some graphic stuff from the demo after complaints, so I believe the final experience will be relatively light, but keep in mind that the game may not be fully happy-go-lucky.

3.[ City Tales - Medieval Era](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265070/) \- City Builder - City builders are a dime a dozen, but this one still managed to stand out to me! Its main gimmick is organic grid - you shape your own housing districts and have to make them fit in with one another in order to upgrade, offering a puzzle-like mechanic. I played the demo for about 2 hours and found it incredibly fun and quite easy. They also promise to offer a more narrative experience, although that was not very present in the demo and may be developed through its Early Access period. Despite the EA tag I found the game to be quite developed, and I think with some quality of life improvements and extra content it truly has a chance to stand out.

**High Quality**

4.[ Duck Detective - The Ghost of Glamping](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2714620/Duck_Detective_The_Ghost_of_Glamping/) \- Detective Point & Click - I saw someone ask about this in one of the posts, so if you're reading this, here's my review :) I never played the first one as I found the style too childish but to be honest this was quite fun! It can definitely be played by an older audience as well - the main character was quite endearing as a boyfailure divorced duck detective barely living off his booksales - just like me, fr! The gameplay itself is similar to The Golden Idol - you examine objects, suspects and the environment to find out the right words and get to the right conclusions. It also has an easy mode and I think it should provide for a funny, laid back experience.

5.[ Detective Instinct: Farewell My Beloved](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2989360/Detective_Instinct_Farewell_My_Beloved_Demo/) \- Detective VN - If you're detecting a pattern here, yes, I tried a lot of detective games. This one in particular stood out with its intentional retro, early 2000s aesthetic, and I just couldn't resist.  It has a funny undertone and I loved the premise - a woman vanishes on a train, and you're the only one who remembers her even existing. This is a fully fledged visual novel with minimal gameplay (for detective with gameplay, please look at[ Best Served Cold](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3218530/Best_Served_Cold/)) which is why it was quite hard for me to go through, but if you play VNs I promise this one will be worth your time.

6.[ Beholder Conductor](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2852420/Beholder_Conductor_Demo/) Dystopian Point & Click - Full disclosure, this one is a little stressful. You play as a train conductor under a totalitarian regime and get to do cozy tasks such as prepping your passangers' cabins, checking their tickets, and spying on them for the authorities. On top of this there is also a main storyline which often requires you to choose between your job security and your sense of morality, forcing you to protect or turn in your passangers and colleagues. I actually replayed the demo 3 different times to get a good ending, so yeah - this one's hard, but if you're a fan of cozy-lites such as Papers Please or Orwell, this is a must try.

7. [ Kathy Rain Soothsayer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1466390/Kathy_Rain_2_Soothsayer/) \- Detective Point & Click - This is another game where I did not play the original - sorry! Judging from the Steam page though, the art has improved a lot. You play as a Kathy, a Private Investigator trying to find a serial killer - I wish I could tell you more than that, but the demo did not go very far. The game itself is very polished, but my main issue with it was that it requires a lot of your attention and a few tries to figure out what is going on. Some places I got stuck because I couldn't find the proper information (would recommend a notebook to be honest), other places I simply found unintuitive - for example I was supposed to notice a spot on the floor, which I wholeheartedly believed was a nice touch of the light reflecting through the windows. If you have more experience with those point & clicks than me, you'll probably figure the game out though.

8.[ Dark Deity 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446600/Dark_Deity_2/) \- Strategic, RPG - I am adding this one purely because I know people in this sub play Fire Emblem Three Houses and this one is in the same genre! It has really nice character designs and focuses on their personalities and connections, but the scope of gameplay is a narrower - there are no romance or life-sim parts, the game consists of the narrative VN-structured fragments and the strategic battles. It is, however, very customisable, and you can make the game as easy as you want to, even removing the turn limit. If you would like an easy Fire Emblem-like or are a PC only player who has not played Fire Emblem, give this one a try. Did I mention it has complete voiceovers?

**Not for me, maybe for you?**

9.[ River Towns](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265950/River_Towns_Demo/) \- Puzzle - I have seen this demo mentioned in the sub with very good feedback but unfortunately it's not for me. When the Kickstarter came out for this I was under the impression that it's a little more narrative and a little less stressful, but alas. The premise of this is that you are playing as settlers exploring and reviving some wasted lands, by strategically placing your settlement puzzle pieces. The game does not have difficulty levels or adjustments and made for a pretty stressful experience for me. I would liken this game to Dorfromantik which left me feeling the same way - a fun premise but geez, does it have to be so hard? If you like Dorfromantik or difficult puzzles in general though, you'll love this one.

10.[ Sedap](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2650730/SEDAP_A_Culinary_Adventure/) \- Cooking Co-op - This is a kind of a multiplayer Dinner Dash with Southeast Asian influences perfect for playing with your friends. However, it does seem to be a liiitle stressful - in true Overcooked style. I tried this one on my own which is probably why I did not have any fun, but it did not seem to be very hard. I did appreciate the cultural angle and it looks really nice, so if you and your friends feel up to it, try this one!

11.[ Piece by Piece](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3468410/Piece_by_Piece_Demo/) \- Puzzle, Casual - This game is very polished and cute but it has to be for children. You play as a fox who owns a repair shop and gets new items to repair every day, which all sounds nice and dandy, but the game/demo is really bare bones and seems to me to be geared to children on Nintendo (no mouse support? on Steam?). The repair part itself is clunky as the game has no mouse support and makes you rotate the object (but not the pieces) fully by keyboard/controller. I can't recommend this unless it's for your young child, to be honest.

12.[ Do No Harm](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3468320/Do_No_Harm_Demo/) \- Lovecraftian, Medical Sim - As the Lovecraftian tag implies, this one's a little horror. You play as a doctor recently moved in a weird town, and get to cure patients by prescribing them the correct medicines. And sometimes you hallucinate or see strange things out of the window but it's just part of the job B) It was a little too scary for me but the gameplay is engaging, so if you're into cozy horror or something of the sort, you might enjoy this one.

13.[ Yes Your Grace - Snowfall](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1373090/Yes_Your_Grace_Snowfall/) \- Choices Matter, Point & Click - Okay, so I did actually play the first game, and did not enjoy it at all. So of COURSE I came back for the second to find the same thing. In this game (and its predecessor), you play as the king of a small nation, helping your petitioners who come with random requests and problems on the daily, while simultaneously trying to keep your kingdom safe from war. Despite the interesting premise and very nice graphics, my main problem with this game is that you never actually have any idea what is the right choice and how to distribute resources, and while that was improved a little in the second game, I still landed in the same situation of discovering by day 4 (end of demo) that hey, maybe I needed to save some stuff along the way. Gee thanks for telling me! But if you enjoyed the first game or maybe are better at those strategy games than I am, then go right ahead :)

**Needs Improvements**

14.[ Historicity Florence](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545880/HistoriCity_Florence/) \- City Builder - Yes, another one of those, but listen: this one is focused on Florence and its historical and artistic importance in the world. Throughout your city building gameplay you get to collect masters, artpieces, relics and wonders, and use them as part of your city. I was very impressed by this aspect, and I think a lot of people will appreciate this idea and background. However, the demo itself does not show much of it - you are mostly stuck in the early game trying to get some houses going, and most of the art pieces I mentioned were all locked in the demo. I found the early game quite clunky and difficult as my people kept dying of hunger somehow - and they barely moved to do anything. This is coming out in Early Access, and only time will tell whether it lives up to the expectations or not - the part I played was too small to give me a proper view.

15.[ Milord](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2562750/Milord_Demo/) \- Choices Matter - This game has the exact gameloop as the aforementioned Yes, Your Grace, with the caveat that it is much less serious and has a little city building component. I was not super impressed by this one, because it suffers from the same issue that Yes, Your Grace has (you can never actually make a proper informed choice and end up using all your resources and random stuff), but compounded by its random petitioners: unlike Yes, Your Grace which uses a complete story which does not change over gameplays, in this game the petitioners are slightly randomised: you will always have one or two that are story relevant, but some will be random. That's how I made multiple 5 minute playthroughs and ended up dying by round 3/4 in each of them, despite the game letting you play for about 5 or 6 rounds total I think. Do i suck or is the game unbalanced? Only time will tell.... 

16.[ Urban Jungle](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825060/Urban_Jungle_Demo/) \- Puzzle, Casual - So, this is Unpacking but with plants. It follows the same structure of 'girl's life along the years', except the girl is a massive plant lover, and there is also a little speech in it. I was unfortunately not impressed by this one - the game functions by giving you points whenever you place a plant in its right position (close to the sun, in a dry environment, etc), and you use those points to buy more plants. And more plants, and more plants... which to me ruined the game loop,as there isn't really any point in placing those plants to begin with, nevermind placing 30 of them in a room or something. I think this game would really benefit from more structure, and actually ditching or changing the narrative part, as it's way too clunky.

17.[ Cattle Country](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2818150/Cattle_Country/) \- Farm Sim - This is a Cowboy, Wild West inspired farm sim from a seasoned indie dev, with amazing graphics, and a lot of promise. Which is exactly why I was so dissapointed with the gameplay, which is completely unbalanced. By the end of day 1 (one!!) I already had 3 hearts with a character and had gotten about 10+ gifts in day 2 somehow. I genuinely think this was not playtested at all, because it needs a lot of structural improvements, in my opinion. And unfortunately, the cowboy edge does not completely save this game: we have farm sims dime a dozen and I don't think this one manages to stand apart.. yet. I think it's coming out in Early Access though, so we shall see.

**Do not Recommend**

18.[ Book Bound](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3320800/Book_Bound/) \- Management - I have seen this game mentioned multiple times, and I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this one is not ready.. at all. The gameplay is too bare, your library has shelves with literally 4 books maximum on them - books which literally wait for you outside on the ground after you order them. It's also just.. not fun. Since you only have 4 books per bookshelf and sell about 8 a day I think, you have to do the whole buying/refilling thing quite a lot, manually. I really think this game would benefit from a longer cooking period and a larger scope: buying books in bulk and not 4 at a time, figuring out different suppliers, different advertising methods, discounts based on seasons or events, etc etc. This game is not ready for Early Access in its current state.

19.[ Tailside Cozy Cafe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244930/Tailside_Cozy_Cafe_Sim_Demo/) \- Management - Same feedback for this one... sorry. This one has a cute premise as well, you play as a fox(?) running its own cafe, but the gameplay is similarly barebones and incredibly tiring. The demo tutorial was quite literally ""make coffees to reach lvl X"" - which I thought would eventually stop and let me play some different stuff, but no - I am not kidding when I say I had to make like 30 coffees to reach level 5, then 6, then 7. I stopped at lvl 9 when I was told to make 10 coffees in a row just to continue the story. And the decorating your cafe part is literally useless, as your 'customers' are actually just some little critters who look like bugs, and don't actually sit at any of your tables. WHY???? The demo had very positive reviews which genuinely baffles me. This game is also not ready for Early Access in its current state.

20.[ Wyrmhall Brush and Banter](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3186670/WYRMHALL_Brush_and_Banter_Demo/) \- Casual - This is a fantasy-themed game where you play as a goblin working for a cleaning shop, scrubbing various artefacts on the daily. The premise is nice but it was a bit too simple and unserious for me - almost every single reply in the game is 'k' 'no' 'ok'. The actual cleaning part is literally just pressing with your brush (your mouse) at random bugs/stains. I wish you could at least scrub the thing, to be honest. The actual problem with the game is that the demo took me exactly 13 minutes - and frankly I find it hard to believe the full game could be longer than 2 hours total. I think this might make a good experience as a phone game however.

Long post :P Thank you for reading until the end! Did you play any of those demos, and if yes, did you have similar thoughts? I'd be happy to take your recommendations for demos you guys enjoyed as well.

I'm a 26-year-old guy from Belgium working at a human rights NGO, and I've been calling Sofia home for the past 3 years. Even though I've settled in here, I still find it a bit challenging to expand my social circle. 

Edit: A bit more about myself: I work part time as a Human Rights trainer, part time corporate trainer. I love board games and enjoy a casual gaming session. Once the sun gets out you'll find me with a book in a park or at a coffee place, if not with a book, I'll be out with my camera photographing the city! I'm always down for road trips and I'm always the DJ for the party! Lately I'm also quite into sports and enjoy going to the gym. I've also pretty much been to all bars here in Sofia!

I'm on the lookout for fun activities or groups where I can meet new people—whether that's joining a casual hangout, checking out local events, or exploring the city together.

If you have any recommendations for events, meetups, or simply favorite spots where you’ve met interesting people, I’d really appreciate your suggestions. I’m open to anything that encourages genuine connections without any pressure.

Thanks a lot for your help!

Cheers!

There is one and full restroom upstairs as well as one half restroom downstairs. I will say the neighborhood is beautiful, neighbors kind, and it's in a safe location. We do have two cats so just a heads up. The easily walking would be to a few local restaurants, bars, coffee spots/dry cleaners/ convenience stores which would take all of five minutes to get to is a big plus. The closest grocery store is more among the lines of 15-20 minutes walking, that would be Harris Teeter or Trader Joe’s, but if I’m off I don’t mind helping out with, and that’s pretty much in general since I drive. U Street is not to far, but far enough, a great medium. We have a fridge which I don’t know if I need to share but, it is a fact, as well as in unit washer/dryer, gas oven, pots, pans, air fryer, plates, mugs, silverware, plates, bowls, hot water heater, and seasonal candles. There is cable (sling, ESPN version), amongst an array of pretty much all the streaming services on the living room television, internet as well of course. Utilities are all split three ways, I'd average it at about $130, Water/Gas/Electric/Internet.We are two Males, which I’d like to say are young, but I am 31 and the other buddy of mine is 30, nevertheless age nor gender makes any difference. We work in the hospitality industry, so our hours of work might be different, but with that understanding we are mindful that this is not the case for most people and act on that rhetoric. Very peaceful home, bliss is plentiful here. Keeping things nice and tidy most all of the time is something I’d say we do a great job at so that would probably be the only request to keep going in regards to house uptake. Our roommate had been unfortunately positioned to a degree that has compromised him to journey back to his country for medical conditions which has led to this open room. The lease ends at the end of May, but we are planning on extending it. There are two parking spots in the back as well, and of course street parking. More pictures upon request.

I'm looking for a partner in crime to share adventures with, both IRL and online. Bonus points if you want to rob a bank with me, fly to Bahamas, and 420 together on a tropical hotel beach resort. It'll be a blast!

Some info about me: I'm 33 yrs old and from Sweden, but ethnically Russo-Bengal. I'm 176 cm in height, black hair (tbh more like salt n' peppery), and kind brown eyes. On the heavier side because life really messed me up for a while, but I've lost a little bit and am working on myself both physically and mentally. That said I also have a lot of empathy for your own life struggles. Neurodivergent (very likely autistic, currently waiting for an evaluation), left leaning politically, a mix between a classic and modern man. A humanist and a romantic.

I'm looking to settle down with someone, I've always worn my heart on my sleeve - gone above and beyond for everyone I've ever cared for, so it'd be nice to have some reciprocity. I'm an introvert and a homebody but don't mind going out once in a while, whether it be for something grander or just a cozy coffee together. I get along best with clingy nerdy introverts, and if you're kind and into cute things I'm sure that'll help melt my heart =)

Some of my interests are:

- PC Gaming (WoW Anniversary/Classic/Retail, Overwatch 2, Risk of Rain 2, Civilization 6, Minecraft, Baldur's Gate 3, and plenty more. Let's find the next cool adventure together)

- Music (Daft Punk, Armin van Buuren, The Cure, Suicideboys, Kendrick Lamar, Pixies, Disarmonia Mundi, Modest Mouse, Provoker, and like a billion more)

- TV Shows (Mr. Robot, Battlestar Galactica, Mad Men, The Expanse, Venture Bros., Generation Kill, etc.)

- Movies (too many to list - where would I even start?)

- Anime (Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, No Game No Life, Darker than Black, etc. etc. etc.)

- Shopping (anything nice really)

- Traveling (The Caribbean, Japan, Canary Isles, anywhere nice really, let's go somewhere together)

- Coding (Currently switching from a niche field to back-end, but I've always wanted to make a game with someone)


There's more to me than that, but perhaps we can save the rest for conversation. DMs open, so tell me a little bit about yourself and let's go from there. I prefer moving to a different app (guess which one is ideal for streaming movies and gaming?) if we hit it off. Cheers and have a nice day/evening!",1,1740946907.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

This **Sock It to Me Pound Cake** is a Southern classic, known for its rich, buttery flavor and the surprise of a cinnamon and pecan swirl hidden inside! It’s moist, flavorful, and perfect for any occasion—whether it’s a family gathering, a special celebration, or just a treat to enjoy with your afternoon coffee. 😋

**Ingredients** 🛒:

*For the cake:*

* 1 cup unsalted butter, softened 🧈
* 1 cup granulated sugar 🍚
* 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed 🍬
* 5 large eggs 🥚
* 3 cups all-purpose flour 🌾
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 🧁
* 1/2 teaspoon salt 🧂
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 🍦
* 1 teaspoon almond extract (optional) 🌰
* 1 cup sour cream or buttermilk 🥛
* 1 cup chopped pecans (optional) 🌰

*For the cinnamon swirl:*

* 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed 🍬
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 🍂
* 1/2 cup chopped pecans (optional) 🌰

**Instructions** 👩‍🍳:

1. **Preheat the oven**: Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C). Grease and flour a 10-inch bundt pan or tube pan 🍽️.
2. **Make the cinnamon swirl**: In a small bowl, mix together the 1/2 cup brown sugar, cinnamon, and chopped pecans (if using) 🍯. Set aside.
3. **Prepare the cake batter**: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy 🧑‍🍳. This should take about 3-5 minutes with an electric mixer.
4. **Add the eggs**: Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next 🥚. Stir in the vanilla and almond extracts 🍦🌰.
5. **Combine dry ingredients**: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt 🌾🧂.
6. **Alternate adding flour and sour cream**: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the sour cream or buttermilk. Start and end with the flour mixture, mixing until just combined (don’t overmix) 🥛.
7. **Assemble the cake**: Pour half of the batter into the prepared bundt pan. Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over the batter, followed by the chopped pecans (if using). Then, top with the remaining cake batter 🍯🌰.
8. **Bake**: Bake in the preheated oven for 60-70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean 🔥. If the top is browning too quickly, cover with foil and continue baking.
9. **Cool**: Let the cake cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes, then remove it from the pan and place it on a wire rack to cool completely 🍰.

This **Sock It to Me Pound Cake** is a showstopper with its moist, buttery texture and the delightful cinnamon-pecan swirl that makes each slice a sweet surprise! It’s perfect for any dessert table or just as a treat to enjoy with family and friends. 🍰

I got this little tree about a month ago from IKEA and it’s been doing well with a little bit of new growth. I’m a first time plant owner so that was exciting for me to see. But in the past week it has started drooping pretty aggressively. 

This has happened once or twice, the first time because it got too much sun and the second because there wasn’t enough water, but I can’t seem to be able to figure this one out. 

The plant is in a nursery pot (I think? It’s the black plastic one with drainage holes), and that pot is inside the coffee mug and some roots poke through the bottom. I water pretty regularly, when I notice it being dry which seems to be every 2-3 days and I live in a very warm dry climate so I spray the leaves to help with humidity.  It gets bright indirect light for about 7 hours a day and I try to limit direct light as much as possible

I have seen that the grouping it comes with (6 plants) can cause problems, is that something I should deal with soon or should I wait a bit to reduce shock to the plant since it’s already feeling pretty bad? 

I have already watered the plant yesterday night and it didn’t seem to help, spraying the leaves today hasn’t done much either. 

Any tips would be appreciated! Especially regarding the drooping and repotting if necessary.

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I’m not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I’m not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zUFNfnA)

Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started!

How can I avoid such scenarios?,"Whenever me and my boyfriend go to a restaurant, he would often order something that he visions in a certain way in his head, which is different from the way how it’s actually supposed to be and when his food arrives, he starts complaining that it’s not what he had in mind. Mind you, this occurs 8 out of 10 times.  
For instance: yesterday he ordered an espresso macchiato. A couple minutes later the waiter brings him exactly that, after which he freaked out, whining about not being able to get a decent coffee, why he always have to suffer from getting ""this little shitty ass cup of coffee"".  I used to work as a barista so I know my way around coffee, and I explained that he got a perfectly prepared espresso macchiato.  Apparently he automatically assumed that he'd get ""a large cup of black coffee with milk"" just because of the word macchiato. 

Then this morning whilst we were getting brunch, I recommended him the toasted sandwiches, pointing at the list of ingredients reading the name of it out loud simultaneously.
He liked the sound of veggie cheese, so he agreed to that. 
The waiter brings his veggie toast, he whips the sandwich open, frantically searching for the eggs. I asked him what eggs.  He tells me understood eggs and cheese instead of veggie cheese, and didn't bother to look at the menu as ""he trusted me"". 

This was probably the 5th time in a row that the same incident occurs, and I'm getting frustrated with him refusing to learn at least a few basic types of coffee since he's already consuming it on a regular basis, ending up causing a scene. 

Literally not one of my friends have ever done something remotely similiar to this, how am I supposed to handle this behavior??
