It‚Äôs been only three days and tray 1/23 but it‚Äôs been a rough introduction. It started on the day of when my dentist struggled various times to get that mouth opening device to stay on my mouth. It never ever stayed on after three different sizes and by the time he moved on to cotton instead my mouth was so sore before we even inserted the trays. The orthodontist and nurse did a terrible job explaining anything to me. In fact, I‚Äôve come here to Reddit to figure out things they should have explained to me like how to take them on and off, using the chewie(which is very annoying btw)Switching trays after two weeks, what attachments were and why they are there (which because there‚Äôs so many I look like I have braces btw) and all the preparations to get to eat. Like taking them off (painful, especially the top ones) cleaning them, drying them off, that I will probably never go out to dinner because this is a lot to do just to eat. That when I take medication (which is liquid) I have to do this process as if I was eating. That I have to use these chewies after I‚Äôve waited 30 minutes, brushed,flossed,tongue scraped,gargled inserted the aligners and cleaned up what feels like a medical exam in the bathroom. (There‚Äôs absolutely no way I am going to do this in a restaurant!) ‚ÄúOh excuse me. I have to take out my mouth equipment,wash them in soap,dry them and gently place them in my tray, quickly eat-and then I‚Äôll be back in here to do it in reverse-except I forgot my floss, mouthwash, chewie (can you imagine using that at the table!) so come back for the floor show!‚Äù

And don‚Äôt get me started on my morning coffee. I am a sipper. I like to peruse through emails, use my phone, read while I drink my coffee. It was something I really enjoyed. Well, that‚Äôs all over because my orthodontist said I get 10 MINUTES to drink my coffee and then back to the cleaning station! (He went into great detail about this coffee limit and not losing the aligners in paper towels but everything else nada)

All this being said, I am in a melancholy mood. All day. For everything. I‚Äôm finding myself already at day three skipping meals. I‚Äôm not eating. I look at food and coffee as chores now. When dinner comes and my family is ready to eat I easily say I‚Äôm good. Eat without me-I don‚Äôt want to go through this bathroom regimen again. I‚Äôll grab breakfast in the morning. 

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11 and weigh 130 pounds as is. Day 3.
What is this going to look like in 6 months? A year? 

Albeit I have a poor relationship with food to begin with. (Appetite is suppressed and has been my entire life.) but now it‚Äôs on a whole new scale. Before I wouldn‚Äôt eat 3,000 to 3,500 calories per week. This week alone I‚Äôm already at a 5,500 deficit.

I‚Äôll give it time and see if it improves. HOPEFULLY.

1mmb42l,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mmb42l/nf_my_living_nightmare/,[NF] My living nightmare,"Last September I was on vacation in myrtle Beach,  8 hours from home and my bowels perforated from disease, I got septic shock, needed ivf resuscitation, had heart, lung, kidney and liver failure. I was in a medically induced coma for two weeks. They flew me medivac to a better hospital 2 hours even further from home and did emergency exploritory bedside surgery because i wouldnt of made it to the operation room alive. They opened me up found a large mass growing on my intestines and multiple apple core lesions, and a 3 inch perforation. the entire large intestine was dead tissue and they said this was the most diseased colon they've ever seen and wanted to name a disease after me. I had feces inside my body and had to be washed out. I was left open for 3 days packed with saline soaked gauze to try to stabilize my stats before doing the main operation. They removed my colon and made an ilieostomy coming thru my stomach. Now I essentially glue a bag on my stomach around my small intestine poking through my gut. Ya, getting used to that was weird to say the least. 

    The first thing i remember while waking up from coma was when I was getting loaded into the ambulance, on a stretcher, at the beach house, i looked toward the neighbors plot and above the fence were 4 angels radiating this golden glowing energy. They just were looking at me smiling and waving at me. It felt so warm and comfortable, like ive knew them forever. I mumbled and pointed as the emt held a mask over my face and pushed me into the ambulance. 
I aspirated upon arrival and I remember it. I was vomiting while an emt was holding an oxygen mask over my face and he wasnt looking at me, I swung at him and grabbed his arm and two other people grabbed me and held me down. It felt like they were trying to kill me. I fought to get the mask off me to get the vomit out of my mouth and gasped breathing in my own vomit during the struggle. They inserted a tube up my nose into my stomach to releive pressure and i aspirated more. It was actually feces because my bowels shut down. Yup i was vomiting feces. ü§¢. Or coffee ground emisis. My oxygen levels plummeted and i remember everything around me just fading to black like you see in the movies with just a small light in the center, i vaguely remember them saying hes not breathing, and doing something with my head yelling, breathe breathe breathe. And remember hearing a calm conversation between two emt or doctors saying ""the trick is to tell him not to breathe, to trick him into breathing"" and that didn't work and I faded to black.  That's when I was intubated and put to sleep. 

 I had nightmarish grotesque dreams while in a coma and had full on open eyes hallucinations. I had later learned i had propofol infusion syndrome where the propofol stops working and I was somewhat conscious during multiple surgeries. I remember being cut open but in my mind i was in a totally different place. I had out of body experiences. I was above my body looking down multiple times. In the helicopter i could see i was in a hospital gown, i could see through the helicopter also. I remember seeing swamps and tall reeds sticking up thru the water and fearing they would drop me out of the helicopter. I remember being above my body in a hospital room setting and seeing this burn victim looking demon with his hand just behind my left shoulder but not quite touching. Im assuming this was death. He looked like a mixture of vetna from stranger things and the character Tiny from house of 1000 corpses. I had met him earlier in another hallucination. I remember nurses putting superglue in my eyes and thought they were torturing me but apparently it was something like Vaseline in a tiny tube that looks exactly like superglue. It was to prevent my eyes from drying out. I remember hating them sooo much when they did it. I hallucinated they were just lazy nurses off in the next room watching movies and eating popcorn and they were just fucking with me to keep me quiet.In my hallucination I won a contest and got to be part of this new tv show. It was similar to scare tactics where they videotape people in very scary situations and put their reaction on tv. They disclosed that its all fake and that i was a paid actor to just ""sell it"". Because some of the situations were to dangerous and they couldn't do it to someone unknowingly. There were four or five contestants that showed up and they said not everyone will make it. I signed the forms without reading because I thought i could be a good actor and act scared and really sell it. And I needed the money. Then this woman incharge proceeds to show me around the property we would be filming at and its a medieval castle with a huge property, she shows us a few rooms of the castle and then leads us to this stairwell in the corner of the castle where we go underground and come out of a side door of the castle. It was dark and gloomy outside and there was a big open field and a patch of woods in the distance. She takes us towards it. As we approach the woods i see what looks like a small wooden shack, not even big enough to lay down in. probably like four foot by four foot by seven foot tall. She knocked on the side of the shack as we arrived and immediately this demon burn victim i described earlier opens the door and peers out at us. I was the only one in the bunch who looked this creature dead in the eyes and i could see in my peripheral the other contestants diverted their eyes and kinda stared at the ground. They instantly vanished in the snap of a finger along with the producer showing me the property. I was then there alone in the dark with this creature staring back at me. I faded to black again. I woke up naked strapped to this table/ hospital bed resembling what Frankensteins was strapped to. And there was two women wearing white silky medical flowy gown like clothes, they were whispering back and forth fast mumbling and laughing at me. I thought they were literal witches.  A brunette on the left and a blonde on the right. Both with long somewhat curly hair. The blonde resembled sheri moon zombie and her performance was terrifying. She acted like a literal maniac. Similar to her character from house of 1000 corpses. She was waving around this knife she pulled from her gown moaning and screaming and shows it to me upclose. She shows me how this is a special sacraficial knife thats been passed down in her family. She would drag it across my bear stomach just hard enougb to not break the skin but plenty hard enough to hurt. I just beared down and went with it because i wanted the money. She grabbed my dick and thats when i thought this has gota be real because they couldnt put this on tv. I panicked and it seemed they enjoyed it. I felt violated and pissed. I thought of my longtime gf and was upset someone was doing this. She frantically waved her arms around screaming howling and manic. The two witches drug the knives against me again and again leaving raised red lines on my skin. Harder and harder laughing louder and louder until my skin broke and gave way to their blade. I panicked, I felt everything.  I remember repeating over and over in my head ""i dont want to do this anymore, this cant be real, this cant be real."" It fades to black again.

  I wake up, this time hands bound behind my back, laying down on a stack of big jeep tires. We are on a helicopter this time and my mom and brother are there. My mouth had device with a padlock in it and i couldn't communicate with them. This episode of this fucked up show they planned to throw us out of these helicopters into the water with our hands bound and were just supposed to survive somehow like a version of naked and afraid but with a possibility of drowning. I panicked and struggled to get free. I tried communicating to my mom and brother i dont want to do this anymore,  i dont care about the money i want to go home i dont want to die and they they tried to calm me, my mom had her hand brushing thru my hair and my brother leaned over and said you got this bro. I panicked as they were about to drop us. There was an alarm and countdown going and i continued to struggle and communicate but i couldnt. I faded to black again. I woke in the basement of the castle again, still bound to this stack of tires and they wheeled me over to this pontoon boat. Ond dide of the castle is backed up to the water and they plan to throw me overboard and film me struggling in the water and i refused.  I wanted out and to be done with this stupid show. I was ready to run to the police if i got free. They loaded me on the boat and tookoff anyways. I remember the steering wheel for the boat was one of those medical lights in an operating room with the bendy arms. And the captain of the boat was josh gates from expedition unknown one of my favorite shows. He apparently was a co director of this show im on and was really disappointed with me. Then sheri moon zombie starts acting manic again yelling at me calling me a little pussy bitch. Screaming like a banshee she threw the keys for my padlocks overboard in the water. We got back to the castle and sheri moon screams like shes pissed there's no show now and she goes up the stairs stomping her feet like shes having a childish tantrum. Josh gates is in disbelief and apalogizes. He calls a locksmith and for hours i struggled to breathe with this padlock in my mouth. They managed to free my hands and I shoved a drinking straw in between my mouth and the lock so I could breathe. I waited forbwhat felt like hours of basically breathing through a straw. I know its not real but i experienced it. It was real for me. Eventually a locksmith shows up and its my brother and my couison who coincidentally came to this locksmith call. I mumbled and moaned for help. As my couison reached down to me i passed out. Eventually the coma drugs wore off and i started coming back to earth. 

 I woke up with a breathing tube down my throat and couldnt have it removed for 4 days, there were multiple drains coming from my stomach and thigh. I had a main line inserted in my jugular vein of my neck. My hands were also bound to the handrails of my hospital bed so i didnt ripout my breathing tube. For no need because when they untied me a was literally so weak i couldnt get my hand to my mouth, like physically could not lift it there. I remember being paranoid like they had me hostage in this hospital. I lost 80 pounds over 2 months. Thank God I was fat or I might not have survived. I didn't eat food or drink water for over a month. I was fed with a feeding tube inserted thru my nose into my stomach. I felt so thirsty and dehydrated but i wasnt allowed to have water. My body was swollen and they needed to get rid of the excess fluids. I remember the first time they tried to sit me up i got soo dizzy but when i seen what my legs looked like i wanted to vomit. They were huge fat swollen and red with vericose veins. My ostomy was putting out over a gallon a day because of all the iv drugs they had me on. 

 I also have severe anxiety, aaaahhhhhhhhh! I always say that the worst part of my 2 month hospital stay was having that tube down my throat while concious. It felt like I couldn't breathe i had no control over it. I remember the dialysis, having my blood drained from my body and could feel the coldness of death creeping into your core, like you literally have your life drained from you, cleansed in a computer filter and put back into you, and afterwards I had the worst body pains, fevers, chills, and sweats. I remember i had asked for like 6 ""warm"" blankets during dialysis stacked on top of me and when i got to my room i had the worst hot flash/panic attack of my life and i wasnt even strong enough to get these blankets off of me, and i screamed so hard for help just crying. The nurse eventually rushed in and literally stripped me naked and put a dozen ice packs all over me. One in each armpit, one in each side of my neck, one on my forehead, and one on each thigh. The nurses likerally just lay the remote on my chest with the nurse button, if i dropped it then i couldnt get help if i needed it and it happened daily.  I felt so helpless. I couldnt move any of my limbs more than a few inches. I was in sooo much pain. Mostly in my feet. I thought they operated on my feet when i woke up, it was nerve damage. i didnt feel the 80 staples holding my stomach together because the fentanyl they were giving me, but nerve damage doesnt respond well to opoids so I felt that. My feet and legs were screaming in pain. I was miserable and couldnt have a blanket or sheet even touch my foot or I was screaming in pain. 

 A couple weeks later my body started swelling bad which is common to major surgeries. My brother drove ten hours to the hospital to visit me and during his visit I could feel my left lung stop working and felt I couldn't breathe. I begged him to get the nursed because i knew something wasn't right. A chest tube was inserted in my left side of my upper back with no extra pain meds. I begged them to put me to sleep for this operation but they refused and said there wasnt any time. My mom was present and i got her to scratch my back during this. I also requested blackbird by the Beatles to be on repeat during this operation. They drained 7 liters of pink slime out of me over a few days and initially the doctor set the vacume on full blast and it overfilled and dumped this pink slime all over the floor. After a day or so of extreme pain they said the pigtail catheter was resting on a nerve and had to be repositioned. I was screaming for weeks and wouldn't let anyone touch my left arm because of the pain. They eventually came to reposition it while I was in dialysis and I had a meltdown screaming and yelling at these doctors how dare you try to do this to me during dialysis.  Do you know what this shits like screaming at the top of my fragile voice  and either I fainted or I got hit with a thorazine shot because I woke up hours later and they did what they had to do. My medical bills were 985,000 in south Carolina and the hospital wrote it off as a tax write off. Eventually I got flown home back to a Baltimore hospital in a private jet on a stretcher. It felt so good to be going home after so long. I spent another two weeks in a hospital in Baltimore and got discharged to a rehab. The rehab was a shithole. I feel so bad for the people who have no choice but to live there indefinitely. It smelled like piss everywhere. The rooms were either 85 degrees or freezing air blasting you in the face. There was bugs and rat droppings. I was there for 16 hours and got my family to just take me home. I didn't take any steps or stand up for two entire months so I needed physical therapy bad. I stayed at my parents house for another two months and had to relearn to walk. I got enough strength to use the steps and I went home to my 3 children and amazing fiance after another 2 months of physical therapy. My fiance was by my side the entire time. She sent the kids home to start school and had family take care of them. She left her kids and even her 6 month old baby to stay by my side because they told her I wasn't going to make it through the night. She stayed by my side  and im crying while typing this because I know how  loved i am. 5 weeks into my stay in south Carolina my daughter got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and my fiance went home to take care of her. I totally understood but couldnt help but feel alone. A year later I've still got bad nerve pain in my legs and feet but its not as bad as it used to be. I've also got post sepsis syndrome.  My joints ache and everything hurts but we are alive. My best advice is find what makes you happy and surround yourself with it.

1mmb3gh,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1mmb3gh/similarities_between_a_proper_south_india_filter/,Similarities between a proper south India filter coffee and Cortado.,"This is something I realised lately.. the strength of a real South Indian filter coffee is very similar to a Cortado. 

The only real difference is the extra bitterness and sugar in the filter coffee, as opposed to the natural sweetness from the steamed milk you get in the Cortado. 

Other milk based espresso drinks like lattes and cappuccinos are really toned down in strength due to the excess ratio of milk. 

If anyone‚Äôs not tried to make Cortados with your espresso machine, highly recommended doing it. It might be your fav way to have your coffee. 

I follow a 1:1 ratio of coffee and milk, served in a 130 ML glass.  ",1,1754806238.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

*Aight, I ain't have time to look at this yet, except a quick 10 min search this morning, but I did some digging on some* ***maybe*** *related stuff when the Agency video dropped. But after your post I did a quick search and saw that Broccoli can be used to embed static files into go exe files(there's a lot of forks for Broccoli, so probably a lot more can be done). Without doing a deep dive yet, this is already interesting, cuz i saw it and thought on the squabble up lyrics. . .*

*Oh shit, on github likes aren't likes,*

*it's STARGAZING ü§Ø*

*Like you mention. . .patterns, and from a pattern recognition stand point this already interesting to look at. And the file tree in file tree out part interesting because it could be related to what we found with files in 6:16, which we haven't been able to duplicate, so shits still confusing, but seeing this is giving me hope that we can maybe validate what we found in some aspect.*

*Because if broccoli can be used to embed static files into a golang exe, it could relate. Even talking base Broccoli not considering any forks we find on Github, you can use golang to embed steg into a video that is then packaged via a DASH package manager and upload it where ever, for example Insta reel.*

*So with respect to embedded file tree's mentioned in broccoli-timepiece, it also might relate. Depending on the program we used digging into steg in 6:16 in LA we got two results. One, we was using Binwalk or Autopsy gave one. These two programs resulted in a YAFF root file system(with a couple other anomalies but gonna save that for the post where we get to the files).. Nothing usable in this system, for a long time i was trying to mount, recompile the YAFF root files system etc, but never ended with anything. But it's still a file tree structure, which is what the Broccoli-Timepiece seems to be referring to. Embedding a File Tree in, extracting a File Tree out.*

*Now the more readable, but still confusing and almost certainly incomplete results we got came via bulk\_extractor. Also a file tree, and a bunch of .txt files, but that's more of an ignoring headers pulling the info and dumping into a .txt situation, but setting the .txt files aside, there's still a File Tree structure.*

*So more of an association sidetrack here, the part of your first screenshot, where it brings up coffee script, got me thinking about the File Systems of Coffee site that's come up in the ""The Bigger Picture"" Posts."" which, Donald Glover seems to have Narrated a video for, and also is on their playlist. Credit the original OP on those for this info. And DG has come up recently with his recent Gilga Radio broadcast.*

*Another side not that this made me think of was about a week ago I was poking around the archives of Virgil Abloh's site, and I found a link to this. Haven't seen it posted, but if so my bad.*

So this obviously reminded me of the Oklama site, but on steroids, this came first of course, just hadn't seen this. Two quick things on this. One, the address on this site is for the Hilton in Chicago. A UPS store also pops up, but it's the UPS at the Hilton front desk...also this is the image that shows up when you google it and go to maps. . .not saying it means anything could just be a troll. . .but kinda interesting.

https://preview.redd.it/pfozp09xe4if1.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab6976c4b5203371d8a2cd11c582ae368c9faa78

*Now, from the screenshots you posted, my brain almost went. . .okay .ts files...type script. But there's also this.*

*When they dropped the Project3 Agency vid, I noticed it's a Mux video, it's a MPEG Transport Stream. Similar in basic concept(not the same tho) to Dash stream you see on Insta reels, but way less room for error and data loss/corruption.*

https://preview.redd.it/lmij33j964if1.png?width=1231&format=png&auto=webp&s=58f6ddbc8a8baec008c39b15eda8d563ce19ebcf

*So we see got the m3u8 files, which is basically the outline/playlist/manifest for the .ts Mpeg-2 Transport Stream files here.. Adding this for context that this is in fact a .ts video. what you see above isn't the full video, just sections there's a bunch, and the video is split up in these .ts segments. But the video parts are the .ts mpeg-2 etc.*

*So this shit got me thinking to your post, we got broccoli, which can be used for embedding static files with go exe/golang etc.*

*So if they were creating their own .ts video files, as opposed to say an mp4 video that Mux converts to .ts, they can embed compressed static files/file trees (stenography) easily using a tool like Broccoli/broccoli-timepiece etc.*

*This wouldn't be hard for them to do.*

*But whats interesting is the way they hosting this, and it's .ts video, this is far more robust and error proof than say a DASH Stream reel on Instagram. This format is perfect for hiding information.*

*Not saying there's anything hidden in this video, don't know, need to look more. But considering we know Dot has done steg/hid stuff in videos/songs, they might have the perfect set up to do it here, and there's a few key points that are interesting. So, we did our video on the song identification tags in 6:16. Showed as transparent as we possible could. So we know Dot hid stuff in 6:16. We know he's hidden frames in N95, and other videos, but a lot in N95 and N95 been coming up a lot. Got a post on N95 stuff in draft, something TLV3 recently said.*

Also, a while back someone not affiliated with the team, posted what we found with the files and was tryin to get help with cryptically and things got confusing, we working on a better breakdown, and follow up to last 6:16 in LA post(plus we found more stuff, going back years).

*But a DASH stream is great for steg because of it‚Äôs structure, but it also has issues. It has a higher rate of error due to the dynamic bitrate nature of the stream compared to a .ts video stream. This can cause time loss, data ‚Äúseparation‚Äù issues...*

*But a .ts video stream like this is similar but different. It's far more error resistant because of it has a fixed packet size, and standard formatting/DVB. It's been around. Also, an MPEG Transport Stream (the .ts i keep referring to), is built to allow multiplexing.*

*Meaning it's designed so you can layer different file/program types. You can have the audio, the video, and other stuff(lots of options)  All they'd need to do is have the finished .ts video, then use a program like broccoli/broccoli-timepiece to embed something with. Then there's the extra layer of they could be hosting the video on their own server which would give them even more flexibility as opposed to hosting via MUX server.*

Also only skimmed this but looks interesting, gonna go back.

*One last thing that's interesting is every frame in the video has it's own thumbnail. So normally when pulling frames from a video (like to see all the hidden frames in N95), I download the video off YouTube with yt-dlp, then I use FFmpeg to extract each frame.*

*But they got it set up that you can pull every frame via a URL. So this isn't hard to do with MUX video, it's an option but it's not the default.*

*But you can pull every frame of the video with the following URL*

[*https://image.mux.com/vC7dTAmd8s02RWzK9rfoDJGhQD2O9KJIsELnq93QeRmM/thumbnail.png?time=0*](https://image.mux.com/vC7dTAmd8s02RWzK9rfoDJGhQD2O9KJIsELnq93QeRmM/thumbnail.png?time=0)

*All you need to do is change the time. So the default URL for the thumbnails we see above is time=0, thumbnail of what you see before you click play, at least on desktop. It's frame zero.*

*If you change the zero to 30, you get a thumbnail of the office scene, from behind the kid wearing the snorkel, Fubu 05 visible, and he's facing the people in the room.*

https://preview.redd.it/yl7wdkwcg4if1.png?width=1136&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7c12d15c3c795c068e43db173d01f00cd89cf76

*You can even break this down and go to the decimal. So 40 and 40.8 are different frames.*

*This is also interesting from a ""Easter egg"" or steganographic standpoint. Because we have the ability to pull the frames as they set up, not via a program after using a program to download. As far as pulling frames, this is as true to the original a situation as we could get.*

*Anyways, the fact that they gave us every frame may or may not be significant, but it feels interesting considering stuff Dot's done in the past..*

*Add that to the broccoli stuff you posted, and the Steg we‚Äôve found then add to project3's mission statement it‚Äôs painting a picture. And we've heard ""Learn the Language"" here lately, right?*

*Last year, one of the team homies found a github we thought MAYBE could be pgLang, didn‚Äôt really figure anything out, but with this context in mind I‚Äôll dig back through to find it. Might not be, gonna look.*

*Especially considering the new* [*project3.agency*](http://project3.agency) *site says*

*‚ÄúBuilt on the Program Language Operating system.‚Äù*

*We know pgLang stands for Programming Language.*

*They  might have built their own programing language, or fork of one and we just need to....dig for it.*

*Anyways, yeah, this shit interesting, and typing this out I kept thinking of a convo from last night with a team homie. About the project3 video..*

\-----

The story centers around a kid, wearing a snorkel.

Why is he wearing a snorkel?

Because he knows they‚Äôre all under water, just no one else knows

Everyone we see is drowning, they don't know, except the kid.

And hows the story go?

The narrator, the woman that was put on the spot, she starts bullshitting. . .and the kid just shows up, he‚Äôs got a gold fish. They debate details about the fish, how someones generation affects the perception of the fish. She says stop interrupting, he compliments her. Says she‚Äôs doing a great job with the story, good pacing, she‚Äôs a good storyteller.

And

Then the kid starts staring, he won‚Äôt stop.

He‚Äôs staring into her soul. It‚Äôs freaking her out.

Then the boss says hey kid do you have any great ideas?

This outrages her, how condescending, it's a 6 year old.

She‚Äôs closed off to the idea that the kid has anything of value to contribute.

**But we gotta remember, he‚Äôs the only one in the room that knows everyone else is drowning.**

‚ÄúAnd then kid just starts

digging.

Digging through his shirts

digging through his pockets like forever minutes he just wont stop.

Digging

Digging

Digging

And then he reaches into his sock and gingerly\*\*\* pulls out a little piece of paper, places it on the table.

And leaves.

\-And he just walked away?

Gone.

\-Eh that‚Äôs kinda hard, that‚Äôs tight‚Ä¶

\-So what was on the paper?

Ummm

\-C‚Äômon

I I,

\-You always do this shit

It was on the tip of my tongue

\-You always do this you tell a pointless story

lemme start over. . .‚Äù

Everyone is under water, except the kid. He gives her an idea, he gives her knowledge.

But she‚Äôs caught up in the unimportant parts because she's telling a story of what happened, she didn't see the value the kid had, so she misses the most important part.

Stay open minded, dig, and don‚Äôt miss the important stuff.

Anyways, that‚Äôs the metaphor we got outta this.

My version is 4 times smaller, the interchangeable pieces are all the same, and all the pieces are easy to handle - with parts to easily pick them up with two fingers. I also added a raised grid to stop the buildings from moving. The box doubles as the board, and it looks really nice in our living room. With this version, we play a lot more :)

Mid 30s. Still single. Not the loud-and-proud I don‚Äôt need anyone kind of single, either. The truth? I just haven‚Äôt figured out how not to be.

I want it. All of it. The slow mornings. The kind of comfort where silence isn‚Äôt awkward. Someone who can read my moods without me spelling them out. Someone whose presence feels like exhaling.

My life has shrunk into a neat little loop - work, coffee, movies, sleep. Grocery runs are my big social events. No wonder no one‚Äôs walking into my life. I‚Äôve locked the doors without meaning to.

And yet, the idea of shoving myself into bars, meet-ups, loud crowds - just to put myself out there...feels fake. I don‚Äôt have the energy for forced conversations or networking smiles. I like my cocoon. I‚Äôm just afraid I‚Äôm starting to disappear in it.

Someone once told me I should just get pregnant, as if that would fill the space. No. I want partnership. I want shared laughter in the kitchen, shared warmth at night, shared plans for weekends.

Sometimes the fear comes...not in a dramatic crash, but like fog, slow and steady. What if this is it? What if ten years pass and I‚Äôm still here, convincing myself it‚Äôs fine while knowing it isn‚Äôt?

It‚Äôs this strange tension - lonely enough to ache for someone, comfortable enough to stay exactly where I am. I didn‚Äôt plan this life. It just happened.

I tell myself I still have time. People find love later. It‚Äôs not too late. And sometimes, I believe it. Other days, I feel myself fading into the wallpaper.

I‚Äôm not asking for a fairy tale. Just something real. Someone who wants to come home to me. Someone who makes me feel like my existence is not an extra, but the point.

1mmaxdq,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xgfq6ajO_hU,Nibu and a game streamer enjoyed a indoor camping experience in central Tokyo,"[He ](https://x.com/mother3rrd)is a streamer who loves [Valorant ](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/)and also a stage actor. They went to [REWILD OUTDOOR TOKYO](https://rewild-camping.com/cafe/outdoor-tokyo/).

The two of them were first surprised by the difference in their sizes. He never thought Akari would come on his channel.

First, they tried to make coffee. They were using green coffee beans from Guatemala. They tried to roast the beans and then grind them. He asked why she decided to appear. She had been watching his streams for a while, and she was very happy when she was invited to his radio show. There were a few actors in ""Hula Girl,"" the play she starred in, who were from the same theater company as him, and he went to see it. He explained that it was their first reunion since then, and they haven't played games together privately. She said she would like to be taught how to play Valorant and collaborate with him sometime. He had heard that the rehearsals for ""Hula Girl"" were very tough. She said that even though it was really tough, she did it while thinking about how much she loves dancing on stage.

She asked him when he had joined the theater company. He said that this year is his 11th year. He's from Osaka and had only played baseball until then, but he suddenly decided he wanted to do theater, thought he would make it big, and moved to Tokyo. But it seems the company is going to disband soon.

He asked what kind of life Nibu has had. She passed the audition and became an idol when she was 16 years old and in her second year of high school. She didn't tell anyone except her mother until she passed the audition, so her friends were very surprised when she told them the news. She had competed in a Kendo tournament just a few days before she passed the audition. While idol life had its fun and tough moments, being able to do different jobs every day was appealing to her. He imagined that if he were to hold a handshake event, he wouldn't be very good at it.

In his strict high school baseball dorm life, there was a rule that he wasn't allowed to talk to girls. During that time, watching [AKB ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AKB48/)was the only chance he had to enjoy watching girls. He found out about the handshake tickets back then, but in the end, he never got a chance to use them.

The coffee beans changed color. She then tried to grind them with a manual grinder. She said, ""It's like I'm grinding sesame seeds,"" and then mentioned that she ""grinds sesame seeds"" often. The phrase has a double meaning in Japanese, as it can also mean ""to flatter someone."" When he nearly took it the wrong way, she became flustered.

While she was in the middle of grinding the coffee beans, he suddenly asked her the reason for her graduation. She said that she wanted to have her own channel for game streaming, wanted to pursue acting, and couldn't continue group activities due to a back injury. He started to feel bad about making her grind the coffee beans, so he took over for her. When he did it, it went very smoothly.

During the pandemic, he was in a difficult situation because all of his acting jobs disappeared. He was bored and would play [Overwatch ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/)or talk with his live-in girlfriend. But one day, after he finished a game and turned around, she was gone. He started streaming around that time.

She realized that he was about the same age as her older brother, so he told her to call him ""oniichan."" She tried saying it, but it made her feel confused.

After the coffee beans were completely ground, they finally poured in the hot water. They talked about whether they had been chilling recently, but both admitted they hadn't had much time to. She said, ""Let's be healed today,"" to which he replied, ""I think I'll be healed by you, Nibu-chan."" She then complained that it wasn't something an ""oniichan"" would say.

They finally drank the coffee. It turned out he has a very sensitive tongue and couldn't drink it easily, which made Nibu laugh. Nibu said that even though it was black coffee, it wasn't extremely bitter and was easy to drink.

The two of them decided to make hamburg steaks and hot sandwiches. The moment the flame lit, she was so startled that she made a weird sound, and he laughed at her. After that, she burned the hot sandwich a little. They ate the hot sandwiches. He said he was happy and that it was the best summer, which made her blush. Then, they ate smoked cod roe and potato salad and were very surprised by it.

She said she was too embarrassed to let anyone try her home cooking, but he boasted that he would definitely be able to eat it. When asked what she would make for him, she said ""[hiyajiru](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapaneseFood/comments/p9fix0/cold_miso_soup_hiyajiru/)"" (chilled miso soup), which completely took him by surprise. She said that since her grandmother had taught her to make hiyajiru since elementary school, it was the dish she was most confident in making.

I was preparing for the next day‚Äôs presentation when suddenly a message appeared in my inbox. It was from a girl in our group ‚Äî let‚Äôs call her *J*.

She asked me to do the presentation because I was active and relaxed in class. That day, I wasn‚Äôt in the mood, so I told her to do it herself. She explained that she couldn‚Äôt because she was shy and introverted, especially among classmates she wasn‚Äôt close to.

At that moment, I remembered my own past ‚Äî I had gone through the same thing before and knew how difficult it could be for introverts. I understood her problem and decided to help. The next day, I did the presentation for our group. I‚Äôve always liked helping people when they need it, even strangers. I‚Äôve also done volunteer work before.

Later, we talked sometimes, but only about class or college-related topics. We joked with each other the same way I did with my male friends. Early on, I made it clear that I had no intention of being in a relationship. She asked why, and I told her I wanted to focus on my career. She said that was good.

One day during a chat, she asked, ‚ÄúWhy are we talking to each other?‚Äù I told her that I was just being friendly, joking around, and helping her when possible ‚Äî the same as with my other friends. She agreed and added that she liked how I didn‚Äôt flirt with her and kept other people‚Äôs information private. I was happy to hear that because it was true ‚Äî I had never flirted with her or said anything bad.

During college vacation, I stayed offline from social media. Later, I found out she had messaged me many times, even from a fake account (which I discovered later). When I came back online, we chatted again, but she sent me a flirty message. Since I had already said I wasn‚Äôt interested in a relationship, I didn‚Äôt accept it. I replied politely but ignored the flirting.

To make things clear, I invited her to meet for coffee near her house. I told her not to take it as a date, just a friendly conversation. At first, she hesitated, but the next day she agreed, and we met.

Our conversation started with studies, then she talked about her family problems. I encouraged her to be strong and make her mother happy. I also teased a guy (one of my friends) who had been flirting with her, and I repeated that I had no interest in a relationship. I said that I talk to other girls normally too, and I think it‚Äôs good to have friendly conversations without flirting. I also mentioned that in the past I used to joke a lot, but I had stopped doing that recently.

I think she misunderstood this and thought my help and emotional support were fake, but in reality, I had truly meant it from the heart. By the end, I noticed her facial expression had changed. After that day, she stopped texting me like before and started avoiding me at college.

We only spoke twice after that.

On result day, about a month later, I got a call from her asking about my exam results. I told her I didn‚Äôt know yet because I had lost my symbol number, was out of the house, and was offline from social media again. She thought I was lying and simply said, ‚ÄúOkay, inform me later.‚Äù She passed the exam with good marks, but I still don‚Äôt know whether she called that day out of friendly concern or just to see whether I passed or failed.

Later, I went to college without telling her to check my results (since I had found my symbol number). I discovered I had failed. That same day, I met her unexpectedly. She asked about my results, and I told her the truth. Later, she messaged me saying, ‚ÄúWhat an unexpected meetup,‚Äù and asked which subjects I had passed. I told her the truth again and wished her all the best for her future.

Since then, we haven‚Äôt messaged each other.

The truth is, ever since that first meetup, my anxiety has been increasing, and I‚Äôve had trouble focusing on my studies. I‚Äôve tried forgetting the past by playing futsal, meditating, and doing other activities, but the thoughts still bother me.

**Now I‚Äôm stuck.** Should I apologize to her and invest my energy, hoping that will help me move on? Or should I just ignore the situation and move on without looking back?

Like many of you, I've been obsessively tracking my finances in Excel for over 5 years. Started simple with income/expenses, then built increasingly complex spreadsheets with goal tracking, category breakdowns, subscription monitoring... you know the drill.

The spreadsheet had too many formulas and started taking hours to maintain. So I finally bit the bullet and built my own web app - basically everything I wished existed in one place.

**Key features I prioritised from my Excel pain points:**

**Smart Goal & Impact Analysis:**

* Real-time goal tracking (house deposit, emergency fund, vacation, debt payoff) with timeline calculations
* Shows how today's spending affects your goal completion dates - ""that ¬£5 coffee delays your house purchase by 2 days""
* An allocation system where every ¬£/$ has a purpose
* Investment tracking with automatic progress updates

**Advanced Analytics:**

* Financial health score (0-100) combining budget adherence, goal progress, emergency fund ratios, debt levels
* Automatic subscription detection from spending patterns
* Budget forecasting that projects month-end spending based on current pace + upcoming recurring expenses
* Essential vs non-essential spending breakdowns with behavioural insights

**Privacy & Usability:**

* Multi-user support with individual login accounts (perfect for shared devices while keeping data separate)
* Guided onboarding flow to get you set up properly from day one
* Mobile-first design that works offline
* Optional bank integration for transaction imports
* Everything processes locally - your data stays on your device

**What I'm curious about:**

1. **Excel users** \- What keeps you from switching to apps? What would finally make you abandon the spreadsheet?
2. **Current app users** \- What's your biggest frustration with existing finance apps?
3. **Feature priorities** \- What matters most: goal impact analysis, bank integration, beautiful charts, advanced analytics, or something else?

I'm genuinely trying to understand what makes people stick with or abandon finance tracking. The Excel struggle is real and I know many of you have been through it!

When this is ready for broader use, I'd love to share it with the community. Right now just trying to understand what features actually matter vs what I think matters from my Excel-obsessed perspective.

As the title says waking I‚Äôm back waking up at 5am, sep 2025 I had a panic attack that caused me to start waking up at 5 am ish with a raised heart rate. Before this attack I could sleep just fine and wake up to my alarm like as I would say a normal person I ended up on Mirtazapine for about 9 months and I have been off then since July 1st. I had about a week of waking up early again and then it slowly improved and ended up sleeping roughly 23:30-07:00 ish sometimes a little before but a good 7 hours none the less. I had about a month of good sleep that was un medicated. 

I take Magnesium, Fish oil, D3 & K2. I got most of those after I came off the tablets to try and help me and it did for a month. Now Wednesday morning just gone I woke up at half 5 and thought of that‚Äôs a early one for me and couldn‚Äôt really get back to sleep after maybe like 5/10 mins here or there until my alarm at 7 it‚Äôs now the 4th day of waking up somewhere in the early 5am. I‚Äôm waking with a slight raised heart rate and I am pretty much wide awake. Only issue is with these early wake ups my appetite has gone completely and this kills me as I do enjoy my food (probably to much) haha but it puts a strain on my relationship because I‚Äôm tossing and turning in bed or end up just going to sit downstairs and scroll through Reddit if I have had enough of just lying there in bed. 

I really really don‚Äôt want to use any meds as the mirtazapine made me to drowsy and made me grumpy as hell which wasn‚Äôt nice for anyone. I‚Äôve done some therapy to try and combat why I was anxious and some days it completely goes like the last few weeks but it seems to be just there in the background ever so slightly in the early hours.

Here‚Äôs what actually helped:

**- Focus in short bursts.** 15-20 mins of real focus, short break, repeat. Less burnout, more recall.

**- Change locations.** Even moving to a different chair or table can make your brain pay more attention.

**- Make it active.** I take pics of my notes in Quizuma AI (Google Play) and turn them into interactive quizzes. It forces me to recall instead of just reread.

**- Teach it out loud.** I‚Äôll explain concepts to ChatGPT or to a friend. If I can teach it, I‚Äôve learned it.

**- Use a trigger.** For me it‚Äôs a specific playlist, first song starts (for me it's Lost astronaut), phone goes away, focus kicks in.

This should have been his first warning sign.

The trouble started at 2:17 AM on a Saturday at Denny's, where Harold had developed a habit of eating salmon-heavy meals at odd hours. The Bigfoot transformation had left him with some lingering dietary quirks, and he'd found that the ""Lumberjack Slam with Extra Salmon"" satisfied his cravings better than anything else.

He was sitting in his usual booth, peacefully working through a plate of salmon and eggs while reading a book on advanced statistics, when the waitress approached with a look of barely contained panic.

""Excuse me, sir,"" said Brenda, whose name tag was decorated with small plastic googly eyes. ""You seem like someone who might know about... unusual situations.""

Harold looked up from his book, instantly suspicious. In his experience, conversations that started this way ended with him drinking mysterious potions.

""What kind of unusual situations?""

""Well,"" Brenda glanced around nervously, ""the pancakes have started arguing with each other.""

Harold blinked. ""I'm sorry, what?""

""Booth seven ordered a short stack about twenty minutes ago, and now the pancakes won't stop bickering. They're complaining about the syrup distribution, arguing over who gets to be on top, and one of them claims the butter pat is showing favoritism.""

As if summoned by her words, a high pitched voice drifted across the diner: ""This is completely unfair! I was clearly the most evenly cooked, and I deserve the center position!""

Another voice, slightly deeper and definitely more indignant: ""Your edges are burnt, Frank! I should be on top!""

""Both of you shut up!"" squeaked a third voice. ""You're making the humans uncomfortable!""

Harold looked over at booth seven, where a middle aged truck driver was staring down at his plate with the expression of a man questioning his sobriety.

""How long has this been going on?"" Harold asked.

""Started about ten minutes after we served them. The cook thinks someone might have mixed up the regular flour with... something else. We get weird deliveries sometimes. This is a 24-hour diner we see different things.""

Harold sighed and reached into his jacket pocket. Sure enough, a business card had appeared: ""Saturday Night Special: Culinary Catastrophes and Contentious Cuisine. Ask for the Gordon Ramsay Solution.""

""I'll be right back,"" he told Brenda.

Twenty minutes later, Harold returned to Denny's with Archie Grimsby in tow. The situation had escalated considerably. The pancakes in booth seven were now engaged in what appeared to be a philosophical debate about the nature of breakfast, while a waffle at table three had started leading a protest about the superiority of Belgian origins.

""Oh, this is delightful!"" Archie said, clapping his hands. His beard today sported what looked like tiny kitchen utensils. ""I haven't seen a Culinary Uprising in months. Very well organized, too.""

The diner manager, a tired-looking man named Phil, approached them with the desperate air of someone clinging to sanity by his fingernails.

""Are you the... specialist Brenda called?"" Phil asked.

""Archibald Grimsby, Magical Solutions and Discount Enchantments,"" Archie said cheerfully. ""Don't worry, this sort of thing happens more often than you'd think. Someone's clearly been using Enhancement Flour in your kitchen. Probably got mixed up with a delivery to the magical district.""

""There's a magical district?"" Harold asked.

""Oh yes, about six blocks over. Lovely little area. Best dragon-scale coffee in the city, and there's a wonderful bakery run by a reformed witch. I'll have to take you sometime.""

A new voice joined the cacophony - deeper and more authoritative than the pancakes. ""ATTENTION BREAKFAST ITEMS,"" it boomed. ""THIS IS YOUR HASH BROWNS SPEAKING. WE DEMAND BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS AND AN END TO THE TYRANNY OF KETCHUP!""

""The hash browns have gone political,"" Phil said weakly. ""This is a nightmare.""

""Actually,"" Archie said thoughtfully, ""this could be quite useful. Enhanced food items are remarkably good at customer service when properly motivated. They have a vested interest in being delicious, after all.""

Harold watched as a piece of toast at the counter began what sounded like a motivational speech about the importance of proper butter-to-bread ratios.

""What's the Gordon Ramsay Solution?"" he asked.

""Well, Gordon Ramsay Solution is a bit of a misnomer,"" Archie admitted. ""It's actually based on Julia Child's approach to difficult ingredients. Much more diplomatic than the Gordon Ramsay method, which involves a lot of shouting and tends to traumatize the food.""

He pulled a small bottle from his coat. The liquid inside sparkled like liquid starlight mixed with what appeared to be tiny herb flakes.

""Culinary Confidence Elixir,"" Archie explained. ""One drop in the coffee, and suddenly every piece of food in the place will be motivated to be the best version of itself. The arguing stops, and they start working together to create the most amazing dining experience possible.""

""What are the side effects?"" Harold asked, having learned to always ask this question first.

""For the food? None, really. They just become incredibly enthusiastic about being eaten. For humans... well, you might find yourself complimenting your food out loud, and there's a small chance you'll develop the ability to detect artificial flavors from across the room.""

Phil looked desperate enough to try anything. ""Do it.""

Archie walked over to the coffee station and added a single drop of the elixir to the big pot. The effect was immediate and dramatic.

""Oh my goodness!"" exclaimed one of the pancakes from booth seven. ""I've been so selfish! Here, Frank, you take the top position - your golden-brown surface will look beautiful with the syrup!""

""No, no,"" Frank replied graciously. ""You're absolutely right about the even cooking. And honestly, your slightly crispy edges provide a delightful textural contrast!""

The hash browns' voice boomed again, but now with warmth instead of revolution: ""FORGET THE POLITICS! LET'S FOCUS ON WHAT REALLY MATTERS - BEING THE CRISPIEST, MOST PERFECTLY SEASONED HASH BROWNS THIS CUSTOMER HAS EVER TASTED!""

Throughout the diner, food began enthusiastically promoting itself. The toast started giving helpful suggestions about jam pairings, the eggs began discussing their perfect protein content, and a piece of pie in the dessert case began what sounded like a persuasive presentation about the benefits of late-night sugar consumption.

The truck driver at booth seven looked down at his now-cooperative pancakes and took a tentative bite. His eyes widened.

""Holy hell,"" he said. ""This is the best pancake I've ever had in my life.""

""Of course it is!"" chirped the pancake. ""I've been working very hard to achieve the perfect fluffy-to-crispy ratio! Try me with the hash browns - we've developed a wonderful flavor synergy!""

Within minutes, the diner was filled with the sounds of enthusiastic eating and food items coaching customers through their meals. The coffee was giving brewing tips to Brenda, the bacon was sharing its thoughts on optimal crispiness levels, and a hamburger in the kitchen was apparently teaching the cook advanced seasoning techniques.

""This is incredible,"" Phil said, watching his customer satisfaction ratings skyrocket in real time. ""They're all going to leave five-star reviews.""

""Enhanced cuisine tends to have that effect,"" Archie said proudly. ""Though I should warn you, the food will retain its personality for about a week. You'll need to be prepared for some... conversations.""

""I think I can handle that,"" Phil said, watching a customer at the counter receive personalized nutritional advice from his eggs Benedict.

Harold was finishing his salmon when his plate spoke up.

""Excuse me, Harold,"" said what he presumed was the voice of his remaining hash browns. ""I just wanted to say, you have excellent taste in late-night dining establishments. Also, might I suggest trying the salmon with a bit more lemon next time? We could really bring out those omega-3 fatty acids.""

""Thank you,"" Harold said, feeling only mildly ridiculous for thanking his food. ""That's very helpful.""

""Oh, and Harold?"" This time it was his coffee cup speaking. ""That book you're reading about statistics? The food here would love to help you with some practical applications. We deal with probability and outcomes all day long.""

Harold looked around the diner, where customers were having animated conversations with their meals and everyone seemed to be having the time of their lives.

""You know what?"" he said to Archie. ""I think I'm starting to get the hang of this whole magical crisis thing.""

""Excellent attitude,"" Archie replied. ""Though I should probably mention, there's a small chance that the enthusiasm effect might spread to other restaurants in the area. Nothing serious, just some mildly competitive breakfast items trying to out-perform each other.""

As if on cue, Harold's phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number: ""IHOP pancakes have declared war on Denny's pancakes. Situation escalating. Bring syrup. -B.G. (Brenda from the night shift)""

Harold sighed and looked at his now-empty plate. ""I don't suppose you have anything for competitive breakfast food warfare?""

Archie's eyes lit up. ""Oh, do we ever! The Peace Pipe Pancake Protocol is one of our most popular weekend specials!""

Harold finished his coffee, left a generous tip (which the table thanked him for), and followed Archie out into the night. Behind them, he could hear the diner's food items organizing themselves into a customer service task force, planning the most delicious morning shift in Denny's history.

As they walked toward what Harold assumed would be another impossible solution to an absurd problem, he realized he was actually looking forward to it. His life had become completely unpredictable, frequently ridiculous, and utterly unlike anything he'd ever planned.

It was also, he had to admit, significantly more interesting than his old Thursday nights.

""By the way,"" Archie said as they reached the car, ""next week we're having a special on Social Anxiety Solutions. Very popular with the breakfast crowd. Something about public eating making people nervous.""

Harold considered this. ""You know, I think I'm finally okay with my social anxiety.""

""Good for you!"" Archie said. ""Personal growth is very important. Though if you ever want to try our Confidence in Public Speaking elixir, it comes with a complimentary pocket-sized motivational waffle.""

Harold paused. ""A motivational waffle?""

""Oh yes, very inspiring. Gives little pep talks when you're feeling down. Though it does occasionally try to recruit you for pyramid schemes.""

As they drove toward the IHOP, Harold realized that somewhere between the dragon incident and the negotiating with numbers and the talking pancakes, he'd stopped trying to make sense of his life and started just living it.

It was, he thought, probably the healthiest thing he'd done in years.",1,1754803901.0,fantasy_books,0,1.0,False

2. I have terrible fatigue even though I sleep eight hours a night and feel chest pain daily, especially when I first wake up in the morning or startled/stressed. Fatigue worsened by exertion.

\- The chest pain worsens with stress and activity. I felt pressure in my chest for a few minutes a month or two ago and it wasn't a panic attack. That hasn't happened recently, but a sharp, stabbing pain is frequent.

\-I typically feel exhausted for an hour and a half after waking up. I work from 11 AM to 2 PM and feel absolutely wiped afterwards.

\- If I wake up early in the morning (7 or 8-ish), I feel absolutely terrible. It's better if I wake up in the late morning.

\- I often get migraines and feel lightheaded. Symptoms improves when I lie down. I sometimes need to nap for twenty minutes anywhere from four hours to seven hours after waking up.

\- Recurrent vomiting. I know when I need to vomit because I feel it in my throat, then start coughing as I get to the toilet, and projectile vomit with significant volume and several waves. It's often brown-ish, but I drink a lot of coffee and soda and the vomiting and it's been that way ever since I started vomiting, so it likely isn't blood. If I haven't eaten anything, I'll vomit stomach acid. There was a period of a few years where vomiting became rare, but it's become worse recently, \~once or twice a week. I tried to take two Tylenol earlier, had a feeling that something was stuck in my throat an hour later, and vomited profusely.

\- I sometimes just feel uncomfortable or feverish. I'll just feel physically hot, even though I don't have a fever.

\- Grip strength is also absurdly low for a man. 71 lbs. I can curl 30 lb weights just fine.

3. I have C-PTSD and a history of severe childhood abuse and neglect from 5-14, in addition to severe depression from 14-24. I've managed to quell the emotional dysregulation, but I still deal with acute bouts of depression and stress from loneliness. I've also dealt with chronic stress from academic performance, as I worked every day for a period of a year and a half and never took a semester off during undergrad or master's. I had COVID twice (once in fall '21 and the other in fall '24) and I had flu with pneumonia in the spring, which was treated at home with an inhaler. I also have a hiatal hernia, I've been tested for gastroparesis and they found no evidence to support it.

4. I drink recreationally every couple of weeks. I don't smoke or use recreational drugs.

Hopefully this post is okay! My mom loves the ice-blended drinks and swears by them to help get rid of migraines. Since they are expensive to have everyday, I figured out how to make them at home. It took me a while to perfect it (and not get them icy and instead smooth like a shake!) so I thought i'd share the recipe here in case anyone is interested in trying it. Especially after Friday‚Äôs show! These are also similar to the starbucks espresso frappucinos!

Ice Blended Recipe: 

* 1/2 cup milk (my mom prefers almond milk but any kind will do)
* 20oz cup full of ice (I fill a 20oz cup full with ice to the top) 
* 1.5 heaping teaspoons of instant coffee (I use a blonde espresso because my mom prefers it, but anything will do- the starbucks blonde instant coffee is my favorite) 
* 4 heaping tablespoons of the xanthum gum simple syrup (this is necessary, without this syrup it will be icy and not creamy!!)
* Around 4oz of espresso 
   * I have a Nespresso machine that holds the original capsules. Since my mom likes the vanilla ice blended drink (like olivia), I use the Vaniglia nespresso pod and make the larger amount. I try to make the espesso the night before and leave it in the fridge overnight. 
   * If you don't have a nespresso, you can make the espresso however you want. I have used the nespresso espresso concentrate before and it works too. I've even done cold brew before, but its not as strong. You can also just make your desired coffee and add that, I just prefer the taste of the espresso and think its closer to the coffee bean one. 
* Torani Vanilla syrup (I do around 1.5-3 tablespoons of syrup depending on how sweet she wants it so this step is very customizable!) 

Add all this to a blender and blend until the ice is fully blended and it looks creamy with a shake consistency. If you want whipped cream, you can add it on top! 

  
How to make the Xanthum Gum Simple Syrup: I swear this is necessary to the recipe!! 

Put 1.5 cups of sguar and 1.5 cups of water in a saucepan and heat it on low-medium until it boils. Turn it off and let it cool completely. Add 1/8 teaspoon of xanthum gum and blend the mixture until it‚Äôs white in color and thicker. Place it in the fridge until it looses the white color (usually overnight) and then it‚Äôs ready to use. This makes enough for around 15 drinks so you don‚Äôt have to make it often. The syrup will last refrigerated for 1-2months. 

After months of trying the figure out a good iced blended recipe I finally think I figured it out. I‚Äôve tried so many others and they just end up being like a coffee flavored slurpee. Now you guys can see what is making Olivia DoorDash twice a day. ",12,1754803787.0,h3h3productions,3,1.0,False

I 22f and my husband 25m have not been married for long (just a couple months) but have lived together and been together for 4ish years. I knew he was a gamer and enjoyed playing video games which I have never been a big fan of but preferred he did video games then going to bars or something else. This past year we established a kind of ‚Äúrule‚Äù or boundary maybe a better word? But he got Friday evenings to game with his buddies and then Saturday evenings were for us to spend time together one on one for the whole evening. 
Well lately I feel like he‚Äôs been bending this a lot because I started a new job working a 9-5 Monday- Friday which has caused me to get tired earlier on the weekends and so on Saturday nights I‚Äôm usually wanting to just go to bed with him by 10:30/11:30pm because I‚Äôm exhausted. Well he has taken his and said he wasn‚Äôt tired and wanted to go play his games while I went to bed. Now, I have a really hard time falling asleep alone to begin with and have an even harder time falling asleep alone when I know he‚Äôs available to be with me. (He was just deployed for 6m this past year and I‚Äôve never cherished falling asleep next to him more) and I grew up with the idea that a couple, especially married should always go to bed together at the same time even if one just stays on their phone, watches tv, reads, whatever, just being in the same bed. 
I was okay with it the first couple of times because we were house shopping, and he had a lot going on so I was trying to just being okay with it and let him do his thing. 
But, here‚Äôs the kicker‚Ä¶ he has an alcohol problem. Not bad but he definitely doesn‚Äôt know how or when to stop himself once he starts. He is decent about only drinking on Friday and Saturday evenings but it‚Äôs become extremely excessive in the amount that he‚Äôs drinking. A full large bottle of grey goose, full tequila bottle, 2 6packs of ipas, ect‚Ä¶ if it‚Äôs in the house he‚Äôll drink every last drop. 
The drinking caused him to be very loud and messy, so on top of having a hard time falling asleep alone I‚Äôm left up awake because he won‚Äôt stop screaming at his games. Despite asking him NUMEROUS times ‚Äúhey can you please keep it down I‚Äôm trying to sleep‚Äù throughout a single night. I shaky wake up around 2am/ 5am to an empty bed and then find him asleep on the floor in his game room. And I try to shaky get him up and into bed so he isn‚Äôt sore in the morning but I‚Äôve started getting to the point where I don‚Äôt care and just want him to be sore from his own actions. 

I‚Äôve addressed it multiple times that I don‚Äôt mind if he drinks and stuff but he needs to not drink so much. ‚ÄúOnce you start feeling a buzz you should start to slow down on the drinking, wait an hour or so before getting another one or just stop for the evening‚Äù and he said he agreed it was getting excessive and agreed to have more control. Well this has been a conversation that comes up every weekend lately, and it‚Äôs the same things everytime ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, it won‚Äôt happen again, i know it‚Äôs out of hand‚Äù.

Anyways, that‚Äôs the background. Tonight. We just moved into our new house this week and this was going to be our first full weekend together in the new house. (He‚Äôs been off work for the whole week to move and take care of things while I worked, so these are met only days off). A new video game came out for the weekend and he wanted to play so I said okay, and let him have his Friday evening to spend however much time he wanted on his game. (He drank more than 12 ipas, I lost track of how many cans were in the room). Saturday morning comes, I make him breakfast and coffee in bed (something I do every weekend cause I enjoy it) and he says ‚Äúdate night?‚Äù. And I‚Äôm obviously happy and excited and so we make plans to  hangout and enjoy the new house together this evening. Play games, have a drink or two and spend time as a couple. Well we go to dinner and then we hangout on the back porch and watched the sunset. Well we finally start to go inside and he says ‚Äúokay I‚Äôm gonna go play my game‚Äù and I‚Äôm taken aback and say ‚ÄúI thought we were having date night and hanging out together?‚Äù And he goes ‚Äúoh okay, well we can play repo together if you want?‚Äù. So we play a round and then we die and he says ‚Äúokay I‚Äôm gonna play my games now‚Äù. At this point I ask him again about spending the time together but give up really quickly because I don‚Äôt want to beg for his attention and time if he doesn‚Äôt want to spend it with me. So I leave and go to my room and sit on my phone. I have no desire to do anything else besides just lay in bed and do nothing. Time goes on and I‚Äôm getting progressively more upset after a couple hours and finally decide I‚Äôm just going to try and sleep. So I go tell him good night, and ask if he had a good weekend, sand he goes ‚Äúof course‚Äù. I walked out and just started crying.

He never remembers it, and when I let him know what happened, he feels terrible remorse and apologizes. This time we decided that as soon as it starts we just call red card and I should remove myself from the situation. I did that tonight; but it just angered him even more.

1mma7m7,https://i.redd.it/kl2fjsbcm4if1.png,Everyone‚Äôs freaking out about ICICI‚Äôs ‚Çπ50k MAB. But here‚Äôs the truth:,"The problem isn‚Äôt ICICI ‚Äî it‚Äôs picking the wrong product and then crying about the rules.

Right now, social media is full of people losing their minds over ICICI‚Äôs ‚Çπ50k minimum average balance.

But let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî this is less about ‚ÄúICICI being greedy‚Äù and more about people not understanding how banking works in 2025.

My reality check:

My main account is with HDFC.

I keep a BSBDA account with ICICI for occasional use ‚Äî zero balance, no charges for debit card, transfers, or anything. And it‚Äôs been that way for years. Not a single rupee paid for this account.

Yes, there are limitations ‚Äî but I agreed to those because I don‚Äôt need unlimited perks for a side account. If tomorrow I want more convenience, I‚Äôll just upgrade. Problem solved.

And despite this limited relationship, ICICI still gives me good service. I even have a ‚Çπ5 lakh limit credit card from them.

Example: Last year, my money got stuck in an ATM. I sent an email ‚Äî reversal done in 2 days. No drama.

Here‚Äôs what people don‚Äôt admit:

Free banking exists ‚Äî BSBDA, Jan Dhan, co-op banks, payments banks, student accounts, sometims products like Kotak 811, Slice Bank.

Premium banking exists ‚Äî more perks, more costs. (May be not in the current offering of ICICI but eventually it'll improve as if they want us to maintain this MAB, they'll have to deliver something)

You pick one. You don‚Äôt whine that the free plan doesn‚Äôt have premium perks.

If your MAB is ‚Äútoo high,‚Äù maybe you‚Äôre in the wrong product ‚Äî not the wrong bank.

You can switch products, move banks, or give feedback. It‚Äôs not a hostage situation.

My own banking mix:

HDFC: Preferred Banking account ‚Äî never intentionally maintained the required balance, still have ‚ÄúPreferred‚Äù status for years.

ICICI: Zero balance current account ‚Äî I get all the services of a premium customer who maintains balance, only paying the annual debit card fee. This product is discontinued now, i guess.

IndusInd Bank: Opened when they offered custom account numbers. Only charge was for the debit card, so I opened it, deactivated the card, and use it like a no-frills account for UPI and the Indus app. I also have their credit card, so I can log in using Aadhaar or the credit card to generate pins. Plus, my account number matches my mobile number.

PNB (BSBDA): Opened in my hometown in a rural area where PNB is the only bank. No charges, full utility for local needs.

So I use:

HDFC for all major personal banking

IndusInd as a secondary account for QR payments at my establishment

ICICI Jan Dhan for personal side uses

PNB for rural hometown needs

My point:

It‚Äôs not about what the bank offers ‚Äî it‚Äôs about how you choose to bank with the options available.

My simple process to get what I need:

1. Walk into the branch and tell them,

> ‚ÄúMy banking needs are limited with your bank, so I want a BSBDA or equivalent account.‚Äù

2. If they say no or try to upsell to a premium account with MAB, I politely say:

> ‚ÄúBro, I‚Äôm going to take the product I need, which your bank offers and RBI mandates.
It‚Äôs just a matter of whether you open it now or call me later and give me what I need over coffee.‚Äù

3. Most times, this works.
If not, I escalate via email ‚Äî always email, so I have records and proper follow-up.

4. Within a week, the bank usually calls, offers tea/coffee, and gives me exactly what I wanted.

For the record, I hold over 12 savings accounts and 2 current accounts, yet I only spend about ‚Çπ600 a year ‚Äî and that‚Äôs just for the debit cards on my two current accounts.

I‚Äôve never paid a single rupee for everyday banking services like NEFT, RTGS, IMPS, SMS alerts, or minimum balance penalties. Not once.

The trick isn‚Äôt to rage online ‚Äî it‚Äôs to know your rights, understand your options, and play the banking game better. You need to utilise the options available better to get what you want.",26,1754803031.0,CreditCardsIndia,30,0.72,False

I don't know how it is that some people become one soul in a single meeting, or as they say, they click and fit together. A single introduction is enough for them never to forget each other. On the other hand, there are people who, despite being introduced to each other repeatedly and crossing paths at different stages of life, always avoid one another. No sense of empathy or connection ever forms between them, and if they happen to run into each other on the street, they pretend not to see each other. Friendship for no reason, enmity for no reason! Now, they can call this trait ""sympathy"" or ""antipathy,"" or attribute it to the magnetism and spirits of people. Those who believe in the transmigration of souls go further, saying these individuals were friends or enemies in their previous lives on earth, and for this reason, they are drawn to or repulsed by each other. But none of these hypotheses can easily solve this enigma. This sudden pull and connection is not related to spiritual traits, nor is it connected to physical attributes.

Anyway, one of these strange encounters happened to me a few nights ago. It was the eve of Nowruz. I had decided to find a quiet place to relax for the three-day holiday to avoid the fake and tiring visits. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that a long trip wasn't a good idea. Besides, I didn't have the time. 
So, I decided to travel to Karaj. After getting my permit, it was early evening, and I went and sat in Caf√© Jaleh. I lit a cigarette and, while slowly sipping my glass of coffee and milk and watching the people come and go, I saw a big man from a distance who acted like he knew me and came toward me. I looked closely and saw it was Hassan Shabgard. It had been ten years, maybe more, since I'd seen him, and it was strange that both of us recognized each other. Some faces change less, some change more. Hassan's face hadn't changed. It was the same smiling and simple face, but I don't know what it was about his movements and clothes that seemed fake and unnatural. It was as if he was trying to be something he wasn't.

I didn't know his last name until that night; he told me himself that at school they only called him ""Hassan Khan."" In the schoolyard, during playtime and breaks, Hassan Khan had a sallow face, a big frame, and loose, floppy movements, and he didn't care about his clothes at all. His collar was always open, and there was dust on his shoes, and that very slovenly state suited him and made him more approachable. But he would get angry very quickly and calm down just as quickly. For this reason, he was often the target of fun and bullying by the mischievous boys. I don't know why they had nicknamed him ""the porter.""

I always kept my distance from him, as if there was a vague and unknown difference between us. But now, with the special friendly manner he used to come and sit at my table, that old and baseless reluctance disappeared, or perhaps the passage of time had automatically erased that unknown contrast. But the difference was that now he was fat, cheerful, and thick-necked, and he was one of those people who create a sense of joy around them.

As soon as he sat down, he ordered the caf√© waiter to bring him some arak. He downed glasses of arak one after another, and as a result, a kind of temporary cheerfulness came over him. But because of his excessive debauchery, he looked older than his age, and a line that fell at the corner of his lips revealed a bitter hopelessness. What was strange was that he was very attentive to his appearance, but it screamed that it was fake, and this was off-putting. Every minute, he would turn and adjust his tie in the mirror. The more he drank, the more his face took on a childlike quality and his old sloppy demeanor.

Finally, without any introduction, he told me that he had been in love with a woman for a while, a famous artist who was very ""Europeanized"" and wealthy, and he kept repeating: ""I've been in love with her from afar for a year, but I didn't dare confess my love to her until recently, when things happened in a way that we got together.""

I asked: ""A temporary love or do you plan to marry her?""

""If she's willing to live with me, of course I'll marry her. The thing is, her expenses are high. Every night we go to the caf√©, it costs me ten to fifteen tomans. But I'll find a way to get the money even if I have to get it from under a rock. I'll earn her expenses even if I have to make seven doors dependent on one pot. The thing is, it's based on love, provided she gives up all her previous relationships. You know, I took her to our house and introduced her to my mother. My mother said, 'Come and live in our house.' She said, 'Why should your enemy come here and lock herself up in these four walls?' With this situation, her monthly expenses for boarding and hotels and dancing cost me two hundred and fifty tomans. Tomorrow night, come here; I'll bring her with me so you can see what she's like.""

""I'll be in Karaj tomorrow night.""

""Really? You're going to Karaj for Nowruz? Are you going alone? What do you think, I'll take her and we'll come too. Honestly, I didn't know what to do. And besides, the expenses will be less. Also, on a trip, we get to know each other's character better.""

""No problem, but what about the permit?""

""A permit isn't necessary. I've been to Karaj a hundred times without a permit. You don't need a permit. So, are you leaving tomorrow night?""

""I'll be at Qazvin Gate at 9 a.m. We'll leave from there.""

""I'll come too‚Äîwe'll go together right at 9 o'clock. So, I'll go and tell the lady to get ready.""

I was surprised by this sudden intimacy and the lies he was telling me. Finally, we parted ways, and our appointment was set for the morning.

The next morning, at 9 o'clock, Hassan came with his lover. The lady was like a ""Nazenin Sanam"" from a book: thin, short, with black-painted eyelashes, and red lips and nails. Her clothes were from the latest Paris fashion, and a brilliant diamond ring sparkled on her hand. It was as if she had dressed up for a night party. As soon as the lady saw the old Ford car, she was horrified and said: ""I thought it was your personal car. I've never traveled in a rented car before."" Finally, we got in, and the car headed toward Karaj.

Hassan was right, they didn't ask for his permit. We got out in front of the ""New Age"" guesthouse. The weather was cool, and a coat was necessary. The guesthouse was apparently made up of a garden full of withered trees, with tall, white poplar trees and a long porch that had a row of whitewashed, uniform rooms, as if they had come out of a factory. Each room had three spring beds with suspicious-looking sheets and quilts and a mirror placed on the mantle. It was clear that the rooms were arranged for temporary travelers, because if someone locked themselves in one of them, they would soon get bored. The view from the porch was a row of blue mountains and some well-fed sparrows who had survived the winter cold, with their beady eyes and ruffled feathers. It was as if they were drunk from the spring breeze, and they aimlessly jumped on the poplar branches or climbed the walls, so much so that their noise made one dizzy. But all of this together gave the guesthouse a tipsy and rural feel that was not without charm and delight.

As soon as our rooms were assigned and we had gotten rid of the car's dust, I went out for a walk on the porch and was waiting for Hassan and his lady. Suddenly, I noticed someone at the end of the porch gesturing to me. When he came closer, I recognized him. This was the same young man I had been introduced to in Caf√© ""Parvaneh,"" where he was a regular. And a sarcastic nickname had been given to him: ""Don Juan.""

He was one of those typical, nouveau-riche administrative types. His gray clothes and wide Charleston pants were from six years ago. His head was covered in brilliantine, and a fake diamond ring on his hand with manicured nails was sparkling. After greeting me, he said he had been in Karaj for three days and was planning to return to Tehran tonight. A little quieter, he added: ""I had come here for an Armenian girl, but she left this morning.""

At this moment, Hassan and his lady came out of the room like drunk peacocks. I had no choice but to introduce Don Juan to them. Then we went and sat around a table. Hassan and his lady were apparently happy and content with this trip. The lady patted Hassan on the shoulder and said: ""We have a kind of sympathy for each other, don't we? I didn't tell you, I have a brother who is like a twin to Hassan. But since he got married, I fell out of love with him! You don't know what kind of disaster he got himself into. I was finally forced to get my own house. I really like sincerity and good character... Bless a little bit of good character!""
We raised our glasses to the lady's health. Don Juan got up, went to his room, and brought a gramophone with a few records and started playing music. Then, without any introduction, he invited the lady to dance, not once, not ten times. I noticed Hassan's fiery glances, as he gritted his teeth, but apparently didn't let it show on his face.
After lunch, we decided to go for a walk and get some fresh air. We started walking on the Chalus Road. On the way, Don Juan whispered to me: ""I'm staying tonight too."" Then, it was as if he had known the lady for years, and he started chatting with her warmly! He was informed about everything and everywhere and also told the lady fake stories, so much so that he didn't give the two of us a chance to say anything!

Hassan, as if making a sudden decision, went to the lady's side to say something. But the lady snapped at him and said: ""Hold your head up. What's that stain on your clothes?"" Hassan pulled back in a panic. Don Juan took off his coat and put it on the lady's shoulders. I got close to them. Don Juan pointed to the muddy river by the road and the trees that had grown out of the ground like broomsticks from a distance, and said: ""How good it is to come and live in places like this! This air, this river, these trees that will bud in another month. On a moonlit night, you can come by the river with a gramophone... It's a shame I left my camera behind.""

From the nearby villages, rural men in new, coarse clothes and children in colorful outfits were coming and going. The lady complained of being tired. Don Juan pointed to a spot by the river. We went and sat on the rocks. The muddy river was swollen, and it was waving like a chain, carrying mud with it. The view in front of us was taken up by clay hills and a row of frostbitten mountains. The weather had gotten relatively warm. Don Juan took off his coat, and for the entire time we were sitting there, he talked about his lover, perfume, love, honor, and Caucasian dance. And the lady listened to his silly talk with her mouth open. He said foolish and absurd things, for example, ""I had better pants than this. Last week I went on a plane with one of my friends. When I wanted to get off, my foot got caught on a rock and I fell. My knee was torn. This tailor had sewn these pants for me for 25 tomans. My whole leg was injured. I got into a carriage and went to the American hospital to see Dr. McDowell. He said, 'God had mercy on you, if your kneecap had been injured, you would have become crippled.' I stayed in bed for three days and got better, but from up there, the roofs of the houses were so beautiful! I also saw our own house from up there. The dome of Sepahsalar Mosque was also visible. The people looked like ants. But when the plane comes down, your heart plummets.""

Finally, after resting, we got up and went back to Karaj. Hassan and Don Juan, who were in a good mood and cheerful, were whistling a Caucasian tune. The lady came to dance, and the heel of her shoe came off. The lady kept repeating: ""I bought these shoes from Bata two weeks ago."" Don Juan, who was always ready to help, fixed the heel with a rock, while the lady leaned on his hand.

""Isn't this woman for me? I should leave her,"" Hassan joined me and said, contrary to what he had told me in the caf√©. ""I can't restrain her. Not only does she not stay at our house, but she wants to be free, very free.""

As we got back to the guesthouse around dusk, the table was filled with several bottles of arak, a gramophone, and all sorts of other things.
Don Juan started the gramophone and was dancing with the lady non-stop. Hassan, upset and angry, was fuming and made playful remarks to him that were not without malice, saying: ""Come on, tell me the truth, did you fall in love with our lover? Tell me, we'll divorce her.""

""Oh! I have a fianc√©e myself, you think...?"" Don Juan put on a sentimental violin record, came and sat on the bed, and from his bag, he took out a picture of a sad-looking girl. He kissed it and rubbed it on his face, and tears welled up in his eyes, as if he had tears ready to shed.

The lady's compassion was stirred. She got up and went to sit next to Don Juan. To prevent Don Juan from dancing with his lady, Hassan asked the waiter for playing cards and invited Don Juan to a game of blote. They got busy with a two-person game of blote. But the lady, who was in a good mood and wanted to dance, perhaps to spite Hassan, put on a record and invited me to dance. In the middle of the dance, I felt that the lady was squeezing my hand and showing interest in me, and two or three times she pressed her face against mine.

Hassan had taken advantage of the opportunity to vent his anger and frustration on Don Juan during the game. He cheated, shouted, and got angry. As soon as the dance was over, the lady went and gave Hassan a sharp slap and said: ""Get lost! What's this look? You disgust me. Get lost, you're like a porter.""

Hassan stared at her with his eyes wide open, and a lump formed in his throat. He unconsciously reached to fix his tie, but his collar was open. Don Juan gave up on the game and started dancing with the lady again.

I was watching Hassan out of the corner of my eye. I saw him get up and leave the room. Don Juan put on a tango record.

Hassan came back into the room, looked around, came and took my hand, and pulled me out of the room. I felt his hand trembling. Under the gas lamp on the porch, the veins on his temples were raised, his eyes were wide, and his lower lip was slack. He was in the same slovenly state as when I had seen him at school. While holding my hand, he said in a broken voice: ""Last night when you told me, I thought I was only with you. It's your fault that you introduced him to me! You had seen and known him, but he's dancing with my wife without my permission. Isn't this uncivilized? You should make him understand that he shouldn't act like a spoiled child. He brags about his fake ring and says he spent ten thousand tomans on his lover! He gets all lovey-dovey and cries by the gramophone. He thinks I'm a fool. When he dances, why doesn't he ask for my permission? I understand all of this, I'm smarter than him. I've seen a lot of this phony love. Look, you introduced him to me. You know this woman is too free. I knew I couldn't live with her for long, but I'm leaving right now. I'm not staying here anymore.""

""Come on, one night is not a thousand nights. Now, go wash your face, and get off your high horse. You're drunk and talking nonsense. And besides, it's the first night of the year, it's bad luck.""

But my answer had a bad effect, as if something had set Hassan on fire. He hurried into his room, took some money from the lady's purse, and ordered the guesthouse waiter to get a car ready for the city, as he intended to leave immediately. By chance, a car was parked in the guesthouse yard. He looked around wildly, went over to the sleepy driver, woke him up, and said: ""I have to go to the city right now. I'll give you whatever you want. Hurry up!""

Hassan pulled up the collar of his coat. He got into the Ford car. The driver was rubbing his eyes and walking toward the car. I said to the driver: ""He's talking nonsense, he's drunk, go back to sleep."" The driver was happy to and went back to sleep. Suddenly, Hassan's lady, with a changed expression and her eyebrows furrowed, came to the car and said to Hassan: ""Damn you! You're not even a person. To hell with your porter's face."" 

She turned to me and said: ""I felt sorry for him from the beginning, not love. He was only worthy of a woman like my brother's wife."" She turned to Hassan again: ""Get up, get up and come into the room. I need to finish talking to you. Do you want to leave me here in the middle of nowhere? Damn you!""

Hassan got up in a frantic state, went into his room, and fell on the bed, covering his face with his hands. He was sobbing and saying: ""No, no, my life is meaningless... I'm going to the city... My life is over... You've driven me crazy... I have to go, that's enough!... Until now, I thought my life wasn't just my own, but yours too. No... I'll get out on the way and throw myself off a cliff... That's enough.""

Hassan was not only repeating the clich√©s of cheap romance novels but was also acting them out. This seemingly stubborn man, who was shy in front of me and tried to appear world-weary, self-important, and tough, suddenly lost control. He had become a miserable and pitiful creature who was begging his lover for love and compassion. This whole crumpled and tortured mass of flesh, who was rolling on the bed like a mountain, was in pain! It was a kind of pain of self-importance, and at the same time, it had a ridiculous and funny aspect. Meanwhile, the lady was confident in her superiority, singing her victory out loud. With her hands on her hips in a contemptuous manner, she said: ""Look at him, he's just like a porter! Get lost, you idiot! I didn't know you were so stupid."" She turned to me: ""Mister, I insisted on making him a little presentable. Look at the state he's in! I didn't know he was so stupid, otherwise, I would never have come. What a pity. On a trip, good character is revealed! Look at how he's fallen on the bed? This is his true nature. Even if you give him a new soul, he's a porter. What a mistake I made! It's good that I found out sooner. I can never live with this.""

With her hand, she made a contemptuous gesture that meant ""damn you."" Hassan was sobbing. As soon as I saw that things were getting serious, I left the room and left them alone. I went to Don Juan's room and saw everything was scattered. The needle had reached the end of the record and was making a clicking sound.

""What's going on? Are they fighting?"" Don Juan, with a pale face and completely drunk, was lying on the bed. I shook him. He said: ""What's my fault? She showed interest in me herself and said: 'I love you.' No, she said: 'I have sympathy for you.' This Hassan is like a porter. She squeezed my hand while dancing and even kissed me twice. I had no intentions for her. I wouldn't trade a single hair of my fianc√©e for a thousand of these women. Didn't you see I went out before we played blote? It was to wipe the lady's lipstick off my face.""

""No, it's not that simple, I was also watching.""

""Oh, she's not much of a catch. Her story is like all the stories of chaste women who are at first failed angels, innocent birds, and statues of purity and chastity. Then a cruel, hard-hearted young man comes along and deceives them! I don't understand! Why are so many failed girls deceived by hard-hearted young men, and why isn't it a lesson for other girls? But this very lady takes seven criminal young men to the spring and brings them back thirsty.""

Don Juan was completely unconcerned about the events that involved him, and it was perfectly natural for him. I realized that his nonsensical words, his nouveau-riche antics, his gestures, his silly lies and false flattery, his strutting, and his self-adornment were all completely spontaneous and a result of a blind force that conformed to his environment and its style. He was truly a Don Juan of his own environment without even knowing it.

In the morning, someone knocked on my door. I opened the door, and Hassan's lady came in with her suitcase and said: ""Do you know that Hassan left during the night? I came to say goodbye to you. I'm going to Qazvin to my sister's.""

""I'm very sorry! But wait, let's go find Hassan together.""

""Never. I'm not willing to look at Hassan's face again. To hell with his porter's face! I'm going to my sister's. He deceived me, brought me here, and then runs away at night.""

Without waiting for my answer, she left the room. Five minutes later, Don Juan came to my door to say goodbye with a suitcase that seemed to contain only a gramophone. ""Where are you going?"" I asked. ""I have things to do and have to go to the city. I stayed for nothing last night.""

He also said goodbye and left. I was left alone! But I was in no hurry to leave. The sparrows, with all their noise, had woken up their beady eyes. It seemed the spring breeze had made them drunk. I thought about the strange events of last night and understood that these events were also related to the intoxicating spring breeze and that my friends had also become like drunk sparrows.

After breakfast, I went out of the guesthouse for a walk. I saw a battered car, worse than the one that had brought us to Karaj, passing in front of the guesthouse with difficulty and noise. Suddenly, my eyes fell on its passengers: I saw Don Juan and Hassan's lady sitting next to each other behind the window, engaged in a conversation, and their car was heading toward the Qazvin Road.

1mma5np,https://www.reddit.com/r/amulisinstock/comments/1mma5np/tried_most_of_amuls_high_protein_products_my/,Tried most of Amul‚Äôs high protein products ‚Äì my honest review,"Since childhood I have loved dairy products a lot and luckily I am not lactose intolerant. Out of their entire high protein lineup I have tried these: high protein buttermilk, high protein plain lassi, high protein rose lassi, high protein kesar milkshake, high protein blueberry shake, high protein arabica coffee milkshake and amul whey protein. I keep all of them in the fridge before drinking. Also, all the products were delivered to me in great condition.

**Taste is subjective** so this is just my honest opinion based on my own preferences.

**High protein buttermilk** ‚Äì Taste is okay, not bad not amazing, still fine to drink. The problem is the consistency is very thick, so you either have to cut the pack and scoop it out with a spoon or squeeze the pack to get all of it out. But still, 15g protein for 25rs so can‚Äôt complain much. 8.5/10.

**High protein plain lassi** ‚Äì Loved the taste. Not too sweet but sweet enough. I think this is the best amul high protein product for the price. Put it in the fridge before drinking, tastes even better. You just need to shake it a bit hard before opening. 9.5/10.

**High protein rose lassi** ‚Äì Tastes almost the same as Amul‚Äôs normal rose lassi. If you‚Äôre not sure about the flavor, try the normal rose lassi first (you can find it on Blinkit, Instamart, Zepto or local stores). Everything else is same as plain lassi. 9.5/10.

**High protein blueberry shake** ‚Äì My favorite taste out of all. Thick consistency but not too thick. This one you have to shake the most before drinking so it mixes well. Considering the price, I‚Äôll give it 8/10.

**High protein kesar milkshake** ‚Äì Tastes like normal Kesar Amul Kool, consistency is good. But the price to protein ratio is the worst here (40rs for 10g protein). I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll order it again. 7/10.

**High protein arabica coffee milkshake** ‚Äì If you love coffee, you‚Äôll love this. Tastes amazing, consistency is perfect. But same price to protein issue as the kesar one so I won‚Äôt order it again for that reason. 7.5/10.

**Amul whey protein** ‚Äì This one is overhyped. I fell for the hype. Even though I love dairy products, I didn‚Äôt like the taste, something felt off. Price is also not worth it compared to other brands. For example, Nakpro whey concentrate (1kg) I got for around 1650rs and Amul sells 1kg for 2000. I‚Äôd rather go for Nakpro or Muscle Nectar. 7/10.

P.S ‚Äì All products have small flaws like consistency, taste, price to protein ratio, or being hard to find in stock. But still, Amul is doing a great job for the gym community by giving ready-to-drink high protein options at very reasonable prices. ",9,1754802846.0,amulisinstock,4,0.91,False

I come from an abusive/broken home so I think I latched on to it early on as a means of escape or something that soon became this obsession.

I've got multiple 8 Terabyte external drives with thousands and thousands of carefully collected/curated live recordings by artists I love, organized by year/tour/date etc

I've listened through multiple entire YEARS of recordings by the band Phish, writing reviews of every single show, compiling highlights compilations after I finish a tour, etc etc. Got into them in 2018. Since May of 2023 for whatever reason by obsession exploded even more. Since May of 2023 I've listened through 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2018 x2, 2019 x2 2020, 2021 x2, 2022 (just finished it for the first time), 2023x2, 2024 once, and now in the middle of their 2025 shows. Plus add in hundreds of ""classic"" shows from the 90s and 2000s etc.

I have upwards of 200 books and several hundred live dvds. I've been collecting this stuff since I was a little kid. It is all 100 fucking percent music. Shit I have 14 (FOURTEEN) books just on the band KISS.

When I get into an artist, I have to learn EVERYTHING about them. In a few months I will then be a god damn encyclopedia on said artist. I'll be able to tell you every date, tour, what the setlists were, what the outtakes from whatever album are and what order they were recorded in blah blah blah

When I was a kid I repeatedly checked out the mammoth Beatles Anthology coffee table book (it's like 30 pounds) and lugged it to school every day for months.

I got an iPod Classic circa 2007 and my earbuds were attached to me 24/7 for literally YEARS. I'm talking at church, in class, everywhere at all times. Period. 

I've been playing guitar for 20 years as well. I'm really good but not spectacular as I taught myself and never properly learned scales and all that jazz (though I do get it all, I just know actually know what notes I'm playing and how to keep in key when soloing. That kind of thing.). My special interest is music as a ""whole"" so I guess it unfortunately doesn't really translate to trying to LEARN to play, ya know? I'm really good, but not amazing. 

I discovered AC/DC when I was 8 years old and it was off to the fucking races. My life was never the same. 

I've noticed I seem to fall in love with artists that have a shitload of albums, or with a lot of changes. Artists that maybe have a ton of ""hidden"" history with lots of b-sides or outtakes to discover, that kind of thing. Or artists who change a lot in a live setting from tour or show to the next, etc

**Here's SOME of the artists I love. I am not a fan of these artists. I am an EXTREME OBSESSIVE whatever.**

\-Phish

\-Paul Weller/The Jam/The Style Council

\-Oasis/Beady Eye/Noel Gallagher

\-U2

\-Metallica

\-Megadeth

\-Iron Maiden

\- The Who

\-Judas Priest

\-Frank Zappa

\-Grateful Dead

\-Rush

\-The Beatles

\-Prince

\-KISS

\-Queen

\-Weezer

\-Dave Matthews Band

\-Neil Young

\-Todd Rungren/Utopia

\-Smashing Pumpkins

\-Masayoshi Takanaka

\-The Rolling Stones

\-The Ramones

\-Yes

and so so so so many others. They are all extreme **PASSIONS** for me. I know the ins and outs and whatever the fuck you wanna know about all of them. Every single artist im into. **I have - literally - every single circulating live recording of Bob Dylan up through 2014 (my drive wouldn't hold more so I had to stop). I'm talking THOUSANDS of concerts.** **And I'm talking every known circulating VERSION of each show (some shows have multiple different recordings or different ""versions"" of the same recording etc etc) All carefully organized, etc.**

And I have comparable collections for all of the artists listed above. Same deal. For example, here is The Who's 1979 tour: [https://imgur.com/EqnXQwt](https://imgur.com/EqnXQwt)

The Dead, Phish, Zappa, Rush, Prince, McCartney/The Beatles....those would probably be my favorite artists of all time. 

My Dead box sets: [https://imgur.com/a/YAjyfiw](https://imgur.com/a/YAjyfiw)

I'm also incredibly blessed that I'm a dump truck driver Monday - Friday, which means I'm by myself all day (10-12 hour days) literally just by myself rocking out all fucking day. I literally put a Phish show on at 630 am when I get in the truck. I use it to pump me up (Phish=ENERGY). I write a review of it bit by bit in between getting loaded/unloaded on my phone and post it on a forum (I later put them all on my blogspot for posterity).

Then in the afternoon when I'm starting to get angsty because my Adderall is wearing off, I'm tired from the day, and the traffic on I-85 is making me lose it, I'll put on a Dave Matthews Band show or something and chill out, lol. Of course I play all kinds of other stuff too, but I do have my daily ""routines"" as well, 100 percent.

I've always felt I'd be the world's greatest ""rock historian""/archivist or something. But obviously that's not exactly a persuable career or anything, so my special interest of collecting artists doesn't help me at all, unfortunately.

**For the hell of it - check out these pictures of my bedroom/music room and tell me what you think, lol**

**Of note** \- the wooden clothes dresser in the corner by the wall is my solo Paul McCartney shrine. Yes. All six drawers. 100 percent Macca. Every official release, a ton of his killer Club Sandwich fan club magazines from the 80s and 90s, every tour book, tons of posters, hundreds of CD bootlegs that originated from record collections back in the day (that I obtained in modern times), etc etc etc

Last week he had asked to take me out on a dinner date to which I said yes. This would've been our first meetup.

Thursday he confirmed our date for Friday evening and we later chatted on the phone for a bit. He hadn't given a time so I asked him Friday morning and he then made a reservation for dinner at 7pm. I wash my hair after work and am getting ready since it's a nicer place I decided to dress up. Spent more than an hour getting ready and was looking forward to the evening.

Around 6pm I text him to let me know when he's leaving and he calls few minutes later and says the restaurant is packed and has pushed our reservation to 7:30pm so I'm like oh that's fine and we confirm to meet up at that time. I leave around 7pm and get there but was having trouble finding parking so texted him right at 7:30 to let him know I'm there and am parking my car. No response. I park my car and find it odd that he hasn't responded, so I ask him what's his eta. No response. Few mins go by and I'm still waiting in my car, now considering the idea that I've been stood up. At 7:42pm I call the restaurant to check the reservation thinking maybe I got the wrong time. They confirmed the reservation and I asked if the guy had checked in to which they said not yet and that the reservation is going to be cancelled in a few minutes.

I wait a few more mins and still no response so I left around 7:50pm. Shocked, upset, and disappointed. Around 8pm he calls me but I decided it's prob better I don't talk to him in that moment because I was pretty pissed. He calls a few more times and texts me apologizing a number of times. I texted him back saying I'll talk to him later. He stopped calling but kept apologizing via text like five more times for about an hour even though I wasn't responding and now that i've calmed down, I do think it's genuine. He messaged again really early this morning letting me know he's sorry and ashamed and would like to try to make it up to me if I want. He hasn't made any excuses for himself but is taking full accountability. For that reason alone I'm considering giving him a second chance. I'm thinking he was tired after work and wanted to take a quick nap so pushed the reservation out by half hour but then overslept.

I should also mention that he seems to be quite ""busy"". Last weekend he wasn't very responsive to my texts. We texted a handful of times over the week and had that one phone call on Thursday for half hour or so. The convo I would say is okay. I was hoping to meet him in person and decide how to go from there initially but right now I'm feeling conflicted. After being stood up I was completely turned off but the fact that he's taking accountability and owning up to his mistake is the only reason why I'm reconsidering. I was thinking to give him some conditions if I do decide to give him a second chance, like it has to be a quick coffee meetup during the day and that he has to make the drive to my city (30 mins away from him).

1mm9u6j,https://i.redd.it/7coc6vyli4if1.jpeg,Good Chew Toy Recommendations,"My boy is 4 years old. He loves chew toys but a lot of the time he obsesses over one for a few days and then forgets about it. 

I‚Äôve given him all kinds of toys and chews and the ones he‚Äôs liked most, and they have lasted the longest are coffee wood chews (which end up making a huge mess, marrow bones and extra large antler chews. 

He loves the antlers and are the only thing he doesn‚Äôt tire of and would chew them all day if he could. I always supervise him with them and let him chew for a little while and then take them away. However, I‚Äôve read a lot of scary stories about dogs breaking their teeth on them though so I am hesitant to give it back to him. 

What are your favourite tough chews that you would recommend? I‚Äôm looking for something he‚Äôll like almost as much as the antler and something that will last a long time.

1mm9sl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mm9sl6/a_pyramids_stomach_prt4_finale/,A Pyramid's Stomach Prt4 Finale,"¬†¬†¬†In Aztec mythology it is believed that gods are related to the kings and monarchs of their empires. As well as other dynasties in Southern America like the Inca, Mayan, and Olmec believe in the same thing. Thus, why they go to the city of the Gods to be buried with their relatives, also to be transformed into God Men. They are to be made into heralds of different powers that control the laws of the world.¬†

¬†¬†¬†Although they are to be turned into gods they do not live forever. At the end of each life of the sun a god was said to give their life for the life of the new sun. This is usually around the time of the end of each apocalypse, as described in the ancient calculator. With them putting their bodies into a pit of fire that they will burn to keep the sun a blaze.¬†

¬†¬†¬†A renown god did this, Quetzalcoatl, who burned his body so that the sun could burn another day. He was worshiped for his sacrifice, being praised for it symbolising all good. Though not all gods sacrificed themselves in their mythology, with some living on earth and either tormenting humans, teaching, or enacting natural phenomena. Such as hurricanes, storms, tsunamis, etc.¬†

¬†¬†¬†They did show their true form of their ‚Äúgodlyness‚Äù but rather hid in the skin of the innocent. Spreading influence and intellect suited for the wrong people, bringing people together in masses that defile their original forms. Melting the society they intruded upon, making it their dominion. Forcing the world to be dependent on them, so they never turn away. A wolf in sheep's clothing, waiting for the lamb to get to close.¬†

¬†¬†¬†They will make everything feel like it's in the right place, where everything should be as they are. Never showing what they do to their bodies as they are amused with the pleasure of their miracles. They feast on the living, filling their stomachs with the innocent just to be hungry by the end. Feeding until there is nothing left to enter its jaws. Then they will reveal their full underbelly to the world and destroy all that is left for their pleasure. Ravaging the earth till it's just rock and monsters, scrounging for scraps like a man sipping every last drop left from his coffee to keep himself afloat. Then the sun will die once more.¬†

¬†¬†¬†



¬†¬†¬†Luckily this hasn‚Äôt happened yet, but I can hear their wails and cries for food as I write. They scurry under the earth waiting for their moment. Wishing to be fed like they once were in those temples, the countless lives that fed their blood to their stomachs. Infiltrating anywhere they can to feast on the fool‚Äôs flesh. I have been shown this as a warning of the future; it is a heavy wait to carry. I can see right through the carvings, pale stones, and skin to see the horrors of cosmic powers placed on this earth.¬†



  


The worship of the Man from the east grew exponentially while the rest of the world burned and rotted away. People found pleasure in the man and his presence, claiming him as God. Darkness filled the sky leaving it only to be lit with the fire and magma of the earth. The oceans are drying up, as well the people thrust for pleasure climbing over each other for themselves.¬†

Another plague has brought itself to bear across the land, from one of the holes that reached deep within the earth. A wave of large insects rose to consume the flesh of the living. Giant creatures with stingers the size of doors, skin of stone, and faces of contorted humans. They covered the land in a swarm of destruction, except the land of the man from the east.¬†

¬†¬†¬†The Man from the east demanded his people to build him a temple that reaches the sky. Without hesitation thousands of people, women and children alike began to place stone after stone. Until they ran out, the Man from the east said to them ‚ÄúThen shall it be that your flesh are the stones of my temple,‚Äù he said to the crowd below him. The mass of people began to move, stacking to one another. The Man commanded the swarm to help in the creation of his temple. Soon the giant stone bugs moved and sprayed a liquid on the masses of people.¬†

¬†¬†¬†They began to melt together and form walls of flesh containing faces, eyes, mouths, limbs, and other body parts. Screams of pleasure or horror would fill the air, joining the smoke and ash that piled on the ground. Pillars of people climbed high as the giant insects melted them together till, they were demanded to top by the man. It reached a peak that went above the clouds, where the sun reached above the black clouds.¬†

¬†¬†¬†The Man climbed to the top of the ziggurat over the dismembered bodies of his followers. As he reached the top a pale figure stood there floating, waiting. ‚ÄúTonatiuh is waiting,‚Äù the pale figure spoke. The man made his way to the flat area of the ziggurat above the clouds. He then began to shrivel, twist and turn his body, contorting his skin and tissues. His skin started to lose and fall off in one big piece. It landed on the ground, the arms and mouths from the tower started to pull and rip the skin.¬†

¬†¬†The man revealed himself to be a large creature consisting of the head of a cicada, a mouth in his stomach with human animal teeth, as well as his lower body being a snake tail. On the other side of his head was another face that was a lion with a snake tongue. His servant soon appeared behind him as a man with a bird head, his body covered in eyes, also his legs being bent backwards.¬†

¬†¬†¬†All three stood atop this grand ziggurat above the clouds, as the cries and hallowing echo in the air.¬† The pale figure pulled out a long musical instrument from its mouth and began playing a high frequency rhythm. The wailing began to grow loud, the pale one played the tune over and over as the noise growled. Soon large masses came from the sun and surrounded the Red Ziggurat, they circled the top, wailing and crying.¬†

¬†¬†¬†Then the pale one stopped playing and all remained still. He lifted his hands, guiding the large masses into a large mass of red flesh. ‚ÄúDevour, my lord,‚Äù he said as the large mass began to form into shape. Shaping into a large multiple headed serpent that was able to reach from the ground and to the sky. Each head was a different animal face including a snake, sheep, lion, man, fish, ox, and pig. As well each one-shot different elements that scorched the earth. Shooting fire, lighting, acid, blood, and gas.¬†

¬†¬†¬†After it was complete changing its form from its fleshy mass to its serpent like status. It wrapped its body around the ziggurat facing the three monsters on the peak. ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶have‚Ä¶done‚Ä¶well, now‚Ä¶you‚Ä¶are‚Ä¶no‚Ä¶longer‚Ä¶needed,‚Äù it said in a loud voice. It spoke from each head.¬†

¬†¬†¬†Within an instant the snake head snapped up the monsters that stood on top of the ziggurat and devoured their flesh in its jaws. It left the temple of flesh to start feeding on the land of man. Destroying all that exists, drinking the sea, chewing the last living creatures, and scorching its reign on the earth. The black smoke from the many volcanos stood small to Tonatiuh, eating and dismembering all that existed.

¬†¬†¬†The holes left in the earth began to crack open more and create large scars miles long. Other monsters and creatures crawled from the melting abyss, too, destroying the land. Raping the land of everything it represents, covering it in evil flesh and ash. The Wailing Ziggurat stood tall, showing the reign of the devourer of the world. His reign will last as long as they wail and cry for food to feast on.¬†

¬†¬†¬†The world is left a mess of destruction, fire, ash, and flesh. Chaos reigning over every inch of land, cursed with constant change of idea, state, and appearance. The dynasty of The Wailing Ziggurat lasted 5000 years before it all went out.¬†



Then the Sun died, and the world entered into an infinite void.

  


¬†¬†¬†Though that has not yet happened, it can happen at any moment. Masses are moving across the earth wailing, crying, and fighting. Looking for something to feast on to fill its stomach. I was shown this to give a warning, or a prophecy that will be enacted. All you can do is wait and either be swallowed or melted together. Here my words and not live in fear for the future, rather be enjoined for it is inevitable.¬†¬†

# Best Succulent Plant Arrangements [2025]: Top Picks

Succulent plant arrangements have become increasingly popular in recent years, offering a low-maintenance and aesthetically pleasing way to bring greenery into homes and offices. These arrangements, composed of various succulent species, provide a unique blend of textures, shapes, and colors, making them a versatile decorative element. Succulents are known for their resilience and ability to thrive in dry conditions, making them an ideal choice for those seeking easy-care houseplants.The demand for succulent arrangements is driven by their visual appeal, sustainability, and health benefits. They add a touch of natural beauty to any space and contribute to a relaxing and calming atmosphere. for buyers, selecting the right succulent arrangement involves considering factors such as size, variety of plants, container design, and overall aesthetic. With a wide range of options available, finding the perfect arrangement requires careful consideration and a good understanding of the different succulent varieties and their care requirements.

## Key Features Analysis

The best succulent plant arrangements of 2025 showcase several key features that contribute to their overall quality and appeal. These include the selection of healthy and diverse succulent species, the use of well-draining soil, and the design of aesthetically pleasing containers.

**Variety of Succulents:** A high-quality succulent arrangement features a diverse selection of plants, each with unique shapes, colors, and textures. This variety creates a visually appealing display that captures attention and adds depth to the arrangement. The succulents should belong to different genera, showcasing contrasting forms such as rosettes, trailing stems, and upright structures.

the selection of varied species ensures visual interest and prevents monotony. Popular choices include Echeverias,Sedums,haworthias,and Aloes,each contributing distinct characteristics to the overall design. The contrast in colors, ranging from vibrant greens and blues to subtle pinks and purples, further enhances the aesthetic appeal.

**well-Draining Soil:** The longevity and health of a succulent arrangement depend heavily on the quality of the soil used. Well-draining soil is crucial to prevent root rot,a common issue with succulents due to their sensitivity to overly moist conditions. The ideal soil mix should consist of a combination of potting soil, perlite, and coarse sand or gravel.This soil composition allows excess water to drain quickly, preventing the roots from sitting in standing water. The perlite and sand components improve aeration, providing the roots with the oxygen they need to thrive.A well-draining soil mix also encourages healthy root growth,which is essential for the overall health and vigor of the succulents.

**Aesthetic Container Design:** The container plays a significant role in the overall aesthetic of the succulent arrangement. The best arrangements utilize containers that complement the succulents and enhance their visual appeal. The container should be appropriately sized to accommodate the succulents and allow for proper drainage.Materials commonly used for succulent containers include terracotta, ceramic, and concrete. Terracotta pots are particularly popular due to their porous nature,which aids in drainage.Ceramic and concrete containers offer a wider range of designs and finishes, allowing for greater aesthetic customization. The color, shape, and texture of the container should harmonize with the succulents to create a cohesive and visually pleasing display.**Proper arrangement and Spacing:** The placement and spacing of the succulents within the arrangement are critical for both aesthetic and practical reasons. The succulents should be arranged in a way that maximizes visual impact and allows each plant sufficient space to grow without overcrowding. Different heights, textures, and colors should be strategically placed to create a balanced and harmonious composition.

Adequate spacing between the plants is essential to promote air circulation and prevent the spread of pests or diseases. Overcrowding can lead to increased humidity within the arrangement, creating an environment conducive to fungal growth. Proper spacing also ensures that each succulent receives enough sunlight, which is crucial for their health and growth.

## Core Benefits

Succulent plant arrangements offer several core benefits, making them an attractive choice for home and office decor.These benefits include ease of care, aesthetic versatility, and air purification.

**Ease of Care:** One of the primary benefits of succulent arrangements is their low maintenance requirements. succulents are known for their ability to tolerate drought conditions,requiring infrequent watering. This makes them an ideal choice for individuals with busy lifestyles or those who are new to plant care.

Less frequent watering reduces the risk of overwatering, which is a common cause of plant death. Succulents also thrive in radiant, indirect light, requiring minimal attention to lighting conditions. They do not require regular fertilization or pruning, further simplifying their care routine.

**Aesthetic Versatility:** Succulent arrangements are highly versatile and can be adapted to suit various decor styles. Their diverse range of colors, shapes, and textures allows them to complement both modern and customary interiors. They can be displayed in a variety of containers, from minimalist geometric pots to rustic terracotta planters.

This versatility extends to their use in different settings, from coffee tables and bookshelves to desks and patios. Succulent arrangements can be customized to reflect personal preferences, with options ranging from small, single-species displays to large, multi-species compositions.

**Air Purification:** In addition to their aesthetic appeal, succulents offer air-purifying benefits. They absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, contributing to improved indoor air quality. Some succulent species are also effective at removing pollutants such as formaldehyde and benzene from the air.While the air-purifying benefits of a single succulent arrangement might potentially be modest, they contribute to a healthier indoor environment. Combining multiple arrangements or pairing them with other air-purifying plants can further enhance these benefits.

## FAQs Section

**How often should I water my succulent arrangement?**
Watering frequency depends on several factors, including the type of succulents, the size of the container, and the climate. Generally,it's best to water succulents thoroughly when the soil is completely dry to the touch. In most cases, this translates to watering every 2-4 weeks.

during the dormant season (fall and winter), watering should be reduced to once a month or even less. Overwatering is a common cause of succulent death, so it's always better to err on the side of underwatering. Ensure that the container has drainage holes to prevent water from accumulating at the bottom.

**What kind of light do succulent arrangements need?**
Succulents thrive in bright, indirect light. They can tolerate some direct sunlight,but prolonged exposure to intense sunlight can cause sunburn. A location near a sunny window is ideal.

If the succulents are not receiving enough light,they may become leggy or etiolated,meaning that they stretch towards the light source. If this happens, move the arrangement to a brighter location or supplement with artificial lighting.

**How do I propagate succulents from my arrangement?**
many succulent species can be easily propagated from leaves or cuttings. To propagate from leaves,gently remove a healthy leaf from the stem and allow it to callous over for a few days. Once the cut end has calloused, place the leaf on top of well-draining soil and mist lightly.

Within a few weeks,roots and new plantlets will begin to emerge from the base of the leaf. To propagate from cuttings, cut a section of the stem and allow it to callous over before planting it in well-draining soil. Water sparingly until roots have developed.

**21. Buy seasonal produce** ‚Äì It‚Äôs cheaper, fresher, and tastes better.  
**22. Avoid online window shopping** ‚Äì Reduces temptation to buy unnecessary stuff.

I don't know a whole lot about the family cooking history because I'm not super in touch with my American side of the family, but I feel like I could deep dive this. I did obscure my surname in the top one (PA) has to be sometime in I'm guessing the 1920s-30s? It has to be before 1945, because that's when my great-grandfather died. 

I could probably find out more about La Cucina (OH) which to my little pizza/pasta brain is the ideal business model. No seating, no front staff, no extra costs beyond the supply, the cooks and the rent- just handing that right out. 

I do know my grandparents for sure discounted on labour by employing any of the 7 kids. My guess (and yes I could ask, and I will) is that this business was in place in the late 1950s-mid 1960s, because the only listed business that goes as far back as this kind of pricing is a vet from 1968-2021. 

I'm not really that fussed about people looking up this info, since my identity isn't 100% obscured. I just think it's funny that at the time I started at Quiznos in 2005, moved on to pizza and pasta off and on until I left kitchens in 2018, I really didn't know any of this was part of my heritage.

I‚Äôm not homeless, and I hope this post is within the guidelines for this sub. I‚Äôve scrolled through quite a few of these posts and all of your stories have moved me‚Äî frankly, people don‚Äôt realize how close they often are to a similar situation.

recently I have been very moved by a homeless man who I encounter at work and around the plaza my workplace is in. I live in an area where the elements can be very harsh this time of year (100+ degree heat every day, insane storms for days at a time on occasion) and we chatted for a moment about it and he was just so defeated and so sad. he‚Äôs very kind and was moved to tears from me just asking him how his day was and basically just acknowledging his existence and since then I am constantly thinking of him when going to work & hoping he is well.

anyway, sorry to ramble. my question for you all is: what are some things you would REALLY appreciate receiving? what are some actions I can take to help him out a little? what sort of kind words can I share with him, even? I was thinking of sharing some spare toiletries I have, but I thought this subreddit would be a good place to ask about specific things that would be genuinely useful. 
today I said ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and got him a $20 gift card to a restaurant he sits outside for most of the day so he could buy himself a meal or a coffee or whatever once or twice. I‚Äôm not well off whatsoever and that $20 like genuinely was a splurge I maybe shouldn‚Äôt have done but I can go without it and be okay and the same can‚Äôt be said for him, yknow. I gave it to him with a little card that basically just said ‚Äúenjoy a meal on me, you deserve it, pay it forward one day and that‚Äôs all I ask of you, the world is brutal and unfair but just know someone out there is rooting for you‚Äù

**üìù Starbucks Internal Memo: Maintaining the Aroma of Exclusivity**

To: All Baristas and Bean Ambassadors

From: Corporate Image Management Division

Subject: Identifying Non-Caffeinated Threats & Managing Caffeine Dependency

\---

Dear Gatekeeping Team,

As part of our ongoing commitment to curated diversity and stimulant trafficking and distribution, we remind you that Starbucks is not merely a coffee shop‚Äîit is a **social filtration system** and a **corner caffeine dispensary** for the upwardly mobile.

\---

‚òï **Caffeine as Currency**

Our primary product is not coffee‚Äîit‚Äôs **caffeine**, the socially acceptable stimulant that keeps capitalism caffeinated. We serve it in seasonal cups, with whipped cream, and just enough sugar to mask the existential dread.

**Reminder:** Caffeine is a psychoactive drug.

Side effects include:

\- Anxiety

\- Insomnia

\- Digestive distress

\- Rapid heartbeat

\- Muscle twitching

\- Mood swings

\- Addiction

\- Withdrawal symptoms

*\[Sources: Healthline, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic\]*

Despite these effects, we market it as ‚Äúcomfort.‚Äù Because nothing says wellness like jittery exhaustion in a $6 cup. So be patient with the lines of addicts you're waiting on‚Äîthey get hostile with morning withdrawals. A misspelled name or lukewarm foam could trigger a full-blown stimulant spiral.

\---

üìû **Racial Gatekeeping Protocol**

While we welcome all customers in theory, in practice we must maintain brand hygiene.

**Key Indicators of Suspicious Behavior:**

\- Lingering without a latte

\- Wearing professional attire without purchasing a beverage

\- Possessing melanin and confidence simultaneously

\- Asking for the restroom code with no visible frappuccino

**Emergency Protocol:**

Keep your nimble fingers ready to dial 911 for faces that look as dark as our coffee.

Be sharp, **Starbuck Karens** ‚Äîyour vigilance keeps our brand safe from unfiltered humanity. **Remark if you see dark.**

Keep our **melanin filters robust** and our customer base curated.

\---

üßº **Brand Hygiene Reminder**

Our stores are designed to feel like cozy, inclusive spaces‚Äîfor those who look like they belong in our stock photos. Please ensure that all interactions maintain the illusion of warmth while upholding the reality of \*‚Äúthe little Green Book‚Äù surveillance\* ‚Äîa quiet system of spatial control that ensures certain bodies know where they can be, and when they must leave.
