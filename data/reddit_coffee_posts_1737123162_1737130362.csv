The moon hung low over the sleepy town of RidgeWater Creek, its faint glow barely penetrating the dense forest on the outskirts.

As I stepped out of my car, my boots crunched against the gravel road, carrying me toward the cordoned-off crime scene.

The red and blue strobes of police lights painted chaotic flashes across the area, but my focus remained on the figure sprawled on the ground.

The first thing that struck me was the smell—a sickly mix of damp soil and something metallic, almost like rusted iron or old blood.

It was the kind of stench that clings to the back of your throat, refusing to let go. I adjusted my scarf as I ducked under the yellow tape fluttering in the wind.

The victim was a man in his late thirties—married, no kids—a local high school teacher named Gregory. He lay on his back, arms splayed wide as if he’d been clawing at the ground in desperation. But there were no wounds, no blood, no evidence of force or struggle. His body was completely intact.

Then my flashlight caught his face, and I felt my stomach drop.

His mouth hung unnaturally wide, stretched into a soundless scream frozen in time. His eyes bulged, staring at the void, but still radiated with raw unrelenting terror.

It was as if his last moments had been carved into his flesh—a permanent echo of whatever had seized him in those final horrifying seconds.

A shiver crawled up my spine as my thoughts immediately snapped back to two other murders, both eerily similar, and both occurring within the last two weeks.

I lowered my flashlight, sweeping it over the ground around the body. That’s when I noticed it: a crudely etched circle surrounding him, as though drawn during his final moments.

Near his feet, a string of letters was scrawled into the dirt—in a language I couldn’t recognize.

The arrangement felt disturbingly ritualistic, as if the victim had somehow been drawn into a sinister rite that eventually claimed his life.

What made the scene even more grotesque was that the two earlier victims had also been found dead under similar circumstances.

The next day back at my station, I immersed myself in the case files, leaning back in my chair as the details swirled through my mind.

**Victim One, Clara**: A store clerk was found dead in her living room, slumped in a corner. There was no sign of forced entry, but her face was frozen in paralyzing fear. Using her lipstick, she had drawn a circle around herself and left illegible scrawls near her feet. She had even quit her job a week earlier, citing stress, and was living alone at the time.

**Victim Two, Jack** :  A mechanic found dead in his garage, surrounded by scattered tools. Neighbors mentioned he’d been hearing strange noises outside his house for days. In the week leading up to his death, he barricaded himself in the garage and stopped visiting the local bar, where he was a regular after work.

**Victim Three, Gregory:** A high school teacher, beloved by his students, with no known enemies or debts. His wife observed that he had recently grown terrified of leaving the house after dark, often twitching and trembling at the slightest noise. Then, one night, without explanation, he left home and wandered into the woods a mile away, where he was found dead.

Three victims, three different lives, and no tangible connections between them—except for one chilling similarity: the circumstances of their deaths and the fear that was permanently etched across their faces.

There was also another detail I had to account for. In all three crime scenes, an object was found lying next to the corpse. With the first victim it was a small hand held mirror, with the mechanic it was a miniature toy bus and with the high school teacher, it was a fountain pen.

The really odd thing here though was that the objects looked like relics that belonged to another era, probably the late 70’s or the early 80’s, and it made me wonder if they had been left behind by the killer.

Sergeant Holbrook, however, had a different take. He didn’t mince words, calling it outright “the work of the devil.” A police veteran with decades of experience, Holbrook claimed to remember similar occurrences from his childhood. And each time we arrived at a new crime scene, I could see his face grow paler, as if the evidence before us confirmed his worst fears.

The people of the town had a similar opinion as well. Especially the elderly folks who remembered the killings more than 50 years ago. And when the photos of victims leaked and went viral, it was only a matter of time before the whole community got swept in on the frenzy.

As I took a sip of coffee, Sergeant Holbrook stepped into my cabin, holding a file from the coroner’s office. I opened it, already anticipating what I’d find.

Like the others, our latest victim showed no signs of trauma or struggle—no defensive wounds, no bruises, nothing.

All three had been in good health with no underlying medical conditions. The coroner’s report mentioned cardiac arrest brought on by extreme stress,  but the words rang hollow. It felt more like a convenient excuse than any real explanation.

“Officer Harper…” Holbrook’s voice suddenly cut through my thoughts, his tone measured, almost hesitant. “The Mayor wants to meet you at the town hall.”

A knot tightened in my stomach. Town hall meetings were rarely good news.

With three unexplained deaths in less than 2 weeks, the townsfolk of Ridgewater Creek—a tight-knit community of just 1,000 people—were bound to have questions, and not the easy kind. News here moved faster than the wind, and the pressure to provide answers was mounting.

Being the new cop in town— a city officer who had moved here just six months ago to take charge—had already made me a topic of gossip. Now, with these cases piling up, it felt like the tide of suspicion was beginning to shift toward me.

Holbrook and I climbed into the cruiser, and as we drove through the quiet streets, I stared out the window, running through what I’d say in my head.

When we arrived, the town hall was already packed with people. Parents clutched their children protectively, teenagers huddled together in nervous whispers, and the elderly exchanged worried glances. The weight of their fear hung heavy in the air, pressing against me like a storm cloud as I walked nervously through the room, their silent stares following my every step.

The mayor opened the meeting with strained reassurances before gesturing for me to step forward.

""Good morning,"" I started, scanning the sea of tense, worried faces. ""I'm Officer Evelyn Harper. I want to reassure you that we are doing everything within our power to solve these tragic cases. While we don't have all the answers yet, we are committed to uncovering the truth. But we need your cooperation. For the next 10 days, please, stay indoors after dark, and if you notice anything unusual, report it to us immediately.""

As I continued speaking and patiently answered their questions, my eyes continuously swept over the crowd.

One woman in the second row particularly stood out. Her silver hair gleamed under the harsh lights, and her hands rested neatly on her lap. While the rest wore their fear openly, her expression was serene—calm to the point of detachment.

When the meeting ended an hour later, I swiftly moved toward her. ""Excuse me, ma’am,"" I said as the crowd began to thin.

She turned to me, her blue eyes sharp and clear. “Hello Officer. I am Ruth. Nice to finally meet you,” she said with a faint smile.

“Ruth,” I said, stepping closer, “would you like a ride home?”

Her smile deepened just slightly. “That’s very kind of you, Officer Harper. Yes. I’d appreciate that.”

Holbrook gave me a questioning glance, but I waved him off, while Ruth and I walked toward the cruiser.

As we drove to her residence, Ruth began to share snippets from her life. She was in her early seventies, born and raised in Ridgewater Creek. She’d never married, had no children, and retired only recently from her position as the local school librarian.

When we arrived at her place, she invited me inside. Her home was warm and inviting, carrying the comforting scent of old wood and lavender.

But what struck me most however was the massive bookshelf dominating her living room, stretching floor to ceiling and packed with books—some weathered, others pristine, all meticulously arranged.

“You have quite the collection,” I remarked, my eyes scanning the rows of books.

“Books are windows to understanding, Officer Harper,” she said with a wistful smile. “But they can also be windows to something darker… something forgotten.”

 “You seemed unusually calm today at the town hall,” I said carefully as I took a seat across from her.

“Fear clouds judgment, my dear,” she replied softly. “I’ve lived long enough to know that panic only leads to mistakes. The key is to look closely, think clearly, and see what others might overlook.”

Her words lingered, and I leaned forward. “So what are your thoughts on these deaths? What do you think is really going on here?”

Ruth stood without replying, crossing to her bookshelf. Her fingers brushed over the spines before settling on a weathered, leather-bound volume. She opened it with care, flipping through the pages until she stopped at an illustration.

The image was jarring: a figure lay on the ground, encircled by a crudely drawn ring, with an undecipherable text scrawled near its feet. It was eerily similar to the crime scenes. My heart suddenly skipped a beat.

“This… this looks just like the crime scenes,” I whispered.

I leaned closer, studying the page. “What does the scrawl mean?”

Her gaze met mine, calm yet piercing. “It says ‘Jurupari,’” she replied, her voice steady. “It means ‘Voice of Fear.’ According to an ancient Amazonian legend, it's an entity that devours the soul of its victim after overwhelming them with fear.”

A cold knot tightened in my stomach as I stared at the illustration, unsure of what to say.

Ruth then turned back a page, pointing to a dark, distorted figure cloaked in shadow. “This is what the legend speaks of,” she explained. “An entity feared for centuries, known for consuming the souls of its victims. It thrives on fear—smelling it, tasting it and even savoring it. Its origins are unknown, but it has appeared across the country in several places over the years. Fifty years ago, it came to Ridgewater Creek.”

I listened, both horrified and captivated, as her words sank in.

“In the seventies,” she continued, “this town was plagued by a series of unexplained deaths. No signs of struggle, no obvious causes—people were just dropping dead, and no one could figure out why. It went on for months, freezing the town in fear. The police were desperate for answers, but they found nothing.”

She paused, her face darkening with the weight of the memory. “That’s when I found this book. As a librarian, I often sourced rare volumes, and when I saw this one, I had a feeling it might hold the answers we needed. I took it to the police chief, but he dismissed it immediately—called it nonsense.”

Her expression softened, and a faint smile tugged at her lips. “But there was one person who listened—a young sergeant named Henry Cross. He quietly observed while I tried to explain to the Chief. He was the tenacious type I must say, the kind of man who couldn’t let something go until he understood it. He even came to my home, sat right where you’re sitting now, and let me explain I knew. A few days later, he came back and said he’d found a promising lead. He was going somewhere to investigate.”

 “And then?” I asked eager to get to the bottom of it.

She sighed deeply. “I never saw him again. He vanished without a trace. The murders stopped soon after, and the town returned to normal. But Henry… he was never seen or heard from again.”

“What do you think happened?” I asked intrigued.

Her expression grew inscrutable as she hesitated. “That, Officer Harper, is a question I’ve pondered for decades. Maybe you can connect the dots, and let me know how this story ends.”

“Do you know where he went?” I pressed.

She nodded. “He said he was going to the sawmill.”

Just then, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I quickly answered, Holbrook’s voice sharp with urgency.

“Chief,” he said, his tone grim, “we’ve got another one.”

“Where?” I asked, my grip tightening on the phone.

“The old sawmill,” he replied.

I quickly thanked Ruth and headed for the mill, long abandoned and feared by the local townsfolk. Perched on the edge of town, it had stood vacant for decades, its history making it a place that people usually believe to be haunted.  

As I stepped out of my cruiser, the thick, suffocating scent of rusted iron and decay hit me as if it had settled into the very air.

Before me loomed the mill, a Second World War era relic continuing to wither away under years of neglect. The roof had caved in at several points, and vines snaked through the broken windows, claiming the crumbling interior. The structure still somehow seemed almost alive, yet entirely forgotten.

To my right, a jeep had crashed into the side of the building, its front half crushed against the brickwork. Paramedics were extracting the driver’s lifeless body, twisted and mangled beyond recognition. The passenger door hung open, offering a clear view inside the mill where another young man lay sprawled across the dusty floor.

Unlike his friend this one was alive. As I approached, I noticed one of the medics kneeling beside him, injecting something into his bloodstream to stabilize him.

Moments later, the man startled awake, his body jerking as his eyes flew open, wide with terror. He scanned the scene wildly, his breath ragged and shallow, until his gaze fixed on the wrecked jeep outside. Recognition dawned, and his chest heaved as he tried to speak.

“It’s my friend,” he gasped, his voice breaking. “He just... he just lost it. We were headed to the city—everything was fine. Then, out of nowhere, he panicked. Started screaming like a madman—like he had seen something. He suddenly swerved off the road and drove straight into the building. I... I barely managed to jump out just before we hit the building.”

The medics eventually helped him to his feet and escorted him to the waiting ambulance.

Meanwhile, I turned my attention to the mill’s interior. My eyes were drawn instantly to a large, sealed fireplace at one end of the room. The mortar appeared weathered, but the bricks had been meticulously arranged, completely blocking the hearth.

I stepped outside again, unable to shake the peculiar sight that kept nagging at me. From the outside, I could see that the jeep had rammed directly into the building's fireplace. I called for Sergeant Holbrooke, and together, we had the vehicle reversed. As the jeep was pulled back, the bricks began to crumble, revealing something hidden within.

Behind the wall of debris was a skeletal figure, awkwardly slumped in the confines of the fireplace. Its bony hands tightly clutched a weathered brown book, its leather cover stained with a large patch of blood on the back, yet otherwise its overall condition remarkably intact.

The tattered remnants of fabric clinging to the skeletal remains made the uniform hard to identify, but the government-issued firearm lying beside him left no doubt in my mind: I was looking at the mortal remains of Sergeant Cross.

We spent the rest of the day combing through the mill, collecting the necessary samples for forensic testing, and then interrogating the survivor back at the hospital to get his full account of the events.

By the time I was finished, it was already half past eleven. As I was heading out for home, I noticed the sergeant's journal lying in the evidence tray, tagged and ready for testing. Without thinking, I grabbed it and made my way home, planning to take a long bath before finally getting some rest.

Entering the bathroom, I prepared the tub, quickly undressed, and waded into the warm water. As I leaned back, I picked up the sergeant’s journal and began reading.

 

 

 ***Investigative Journal of H. Cross***

*People like to think the badge is about ""serve and protect."" But for me, it’s always been about Ricky and what he stood for. He’s the reason I’m here, walking the beat, keeping an eye out for the bully lurking in the shadows.*

*Growing up in foster care, I didn’t have much more than the shirt on my back and a hundred reasons to keep my head down. The other kids were bigger, meaner, and twice as cruel. Every day felt like a battle, and every night I prayed I wouldn’t wake up with a black eye—or worse.*

*Then came Ricky.*

*He wasn’t some guardian angel swooping in to save me. Nah, he was just another kid dumped into the system, rough around the edges like the rest of us. But Ricky didn’t believe in running or hiding.*

*“Punch first and think later,” he always used to say, and he lived by it.*

*He taught me how to stand tall, to fight back—not just with fists, but with grit, persistence, and anything else that gave us an edge.*

*A poke in the eye, a kick in the nuts, smashing a bottle over someone’s head while they were busy eating—it didn’t matter. The rules were simple: keep going, again and again, until they start to feel it in their bones.*

*I’ll never forget the one time we fought back. Three bigger kids had us cornered behind the school yard. They were huge, grinning like wolves, and ready to pounce.*

*Ricky didn’t hesitate. He threw the first punch, and I followed right behind him. We didn’t win—not even close. By the end of it, we were in the hospital with more broken bones than I could count. My ribs ached for weeks, and every breath felt like fire.*

*But what I remember most isn’t the pain—it’s lying there in that hospital bed, tears streaming down my face, feeling something I’d never felt before: a sense of victory. We may not have won the fight, but we held our heads high. And when we got finally back, we tormented them for weeks until we made damn sure they never picked on us again.*

*Ricky was the only real friend I ever had—the only one that mattered, at least. So when I found him dead at a crime scene, his soul ripped from him, leaving only fear etched on his face, it felt like something inside me had been ripped away too. This wasn’t just murder—it was personal.*

*I knew then and there I’d stop at nothing to find the bastard who did this. I owed Ricky that much. This journal is my attempt to piece it all together—my thoughts, my rage, my resolve.*

*It’s time to bully the bully.*

 

 

***Day 1***

*I hadn’t set foot in the sawmill since my teens, back when a group of us dared each other to explore its eerie halls. No one knows exactly why the place was deemed cursed, but the story goes that workers arrived one morning to a grisly sight: the owner’s lower half lying severed by the saw table, while his upper half roasted in the fireplace.*

*The mill never reopened, and its sinister reputation only deepened with time. Whispers of ghost sightings and unexplained phenomena grew so pervasive that authorities eventually sealed the fireplace to deter thrill-seekers and other oddballs from exploiting the site.*

*Now, here I was again, on a stakeout, sitting in my car hidden among a row of trees with the decaying structure looming in the distance.*

*My mind immediately wandered to the events of the past couple of months. Ridgewater Creek had seen more than 25 deaths, including that of my friend, and we were no closer to solving the case.*

*The air in town was thick with fear—people were irritable, on edge, constantly glancing over their shoulders. Chaos was unravelling right before my eyes, and the community was fraying at the seams.*

*The Chief was unwavering in his belief that a serial killer was behind it all. At first, I agreed—especially with the peculiar items left at each crime scene: an ashtray, a felt hat, a tennis racket, a wristwatch, a cassette tape, a torch etc. They seemed deliberate, almost like a calling card. But the more I examined them, the more they felt... disconnected. There was no clear pattern, no logic linking the objects to each other or the victims.*

*As the body count climbed, so did my doubts. Something about it didn’t sit right.*

*The breakthrough came unexpectedly when a young woman walked into the station, clutching a theory about a supernatural entity tied to an old legend she’d uncovered in a dusty book. The Chief dismissed her as a crank, but desperation has a way of shifting priorities.*

*I couldn’t afford to ignore any lead—no matter how improbable. That evening, I met her at her home. As she laid out her theory, a strange sense of clarity took hold. And it got me thinking.*

*If the entity she called Jurupari was real, it would need a place to hide—somewhere near town but remote enough to remain undisturbed.  The place had to be abandoned, forgotten by time, where no one would think to look.*

*And only one such place came to mind.*

*So when I returned to the sawmill after all these years, I found it in even worse shape than I’d imagined—its wooden frame sagging, the air thick with the stench of rot and mildew.*

*I scoured every corner, but there was nothing unusual. No signs of anything lurking, no evidence to support Ruth’s theory. I was even ready to write it off as a dead end and leave when something caught my eye.*

*In a dim corner of the mill half-buried in debris, lay a curious cluster of items: an American flag keychain, a leather wallet, a razor and a bottle opener. At first glance, they seemed like random junk, discarded and forgotten.*

*But on closer inspection, I noticed they weren’t old or tattered. These items looked reasonably new, and oddly out of place—as if someone had deliberately gathered them, seeing still some value in them where others saw trash. It hit me then: someone, or something, was holding out here. I decided to continue my surveillance for a few more days.*

 

***Day 2***  
*I arrived at the mill as soon as I finished my shift at the station. I spent the entire night keeping watch, fighting off fatigue until sleep finally overtook me in the wee hours of the morning. I jolted awake suddenly, certain I’d seen a sudden flash of light. Heart pounding, I leapt out of the vehicle and rushed to the mill. But when I got there, everything was just as I’d seen it the night before—empty and undisturbed.*

 

***Day 3***  
*When I returned to work in the morning, I heard news of another body.*

*This time, it was an old man who was found dead in his garden, his eyes and mouth locked in an expression of pure terror. But what truly sent a chill down my spine was the leather wallet lying next to him—it was the same one I had seen earlier at the mill.*

*When I rushed back to the mill, I found the wallet and keychain missing while the razor, and bottle opener still remained by the side.*

*An uneasy sensation coursed through my veins as I stared at the objects scattered on the floor.*

*Gripping a stick, I cautiously nudged them apart before hesitantly hovering my little finger over the razor. Taking a deep breath, I let the tip of my little finger make contact.*

*A warm, fuzzy sensation enveloped me, and in an instant, I was transported to a memory from my childhood—my mom tossing me into the air, her laughter ringing out as she caught me mid-flight, then planting a kiss on my cheek.*

*Without thinking, I next placed my ring finger on the razor, and the feeling intensified. This time, I was surrounded by both my parents, their faces illuminated by the soft glow of birthday candles as I leaned in to blow them out.*

*Sweat trickled down my chin as I began lifting my fingers one by one, preparing to grasp the razor fully.*

*But the moment my hand closed around it, a long-buried memory surged to the surface—a fateful night I had forced into the deepest recesses of my mind, one that irrevocably and painfully altered the course of my life.*

*Gasping, I tore my hand away just in time, the force of the memory knocking me backward. My chest tightened as I lay sprawled on the floor, staring at the razor, now innocuously lying among the debris.*

*Then it hit me—a thick, metallic tang in the air, sharp and unmistakable, like rusted iron. The atmosphere in the mill shifted entirely, growing heavier and oppressive.*

*Then, from the direction of the sealed fireplace, a low rumble echoed.*

*I crept closer, my movements slow and deliberate, as I leaned against the cold concrete straining to listen. And the hair on the back of my neck stood on end when I heard it—something faint but unmistakable.*

 *It was cackling, low and stifled, as though someone or something was struggling to suppress its glee.*

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

So, I’ve been in this weird on-and-off thing with a guy for a year, and I honestly can’t figure out his intentions. Here’s the backstory:

We met through his brother, who’s a good friend of mine, and hit it off. He slid into my DMs last February after moving to London post-breakup and years of traveling. He was dealing with anxiety and adjusting to life here, and I tried to be understanding.

We went on a coffee date, and it was lovely, but soon after, he told me his life was “too busy” to take things further. I appreciated his honesty, even though it hurt. Later, he randomly bought me some food from an Arabic shop (we’re from the same niche country), invited me to his birthday (which I couldn’t attend), and told a friend of mine that I was beautiful but that he couldn’t give 100% to anything due to his anxiety. I thought okay, he’s clearly not in a place for a relationship, so I left him alone.

Then, in November, he slid back into my DMs, and I thought maybe he was in a better headspace. We went on another date, but he had a panic attack after an hour and had to leave. I completely understood because I have bad anxiety myself. He apologized and asked me out for drinks, which turned out to be a really lovely time. We talked about our long-term goals—he wants to move to the countryside, and so do I—and we seemed to really click. We kissed, kept messaging, and I honestly thought this could go somewhere.

The following week, he asked to see me twice, but things started to unravel. He canceled the first date last minute, sending a voice note at 6:30 PM saying he was ill. I had this gut feeling he wasn’t being entirely truthful, and I didn’t want to get my hopes up again, so I preemptively canceled the second date. I told him we should “rain check” because I didn’t want to risk getting sick before my trip, but really, I was just trying to protect myself from being let down again.

We agreed to see each other after the holidays, and during that month apart, he’d message me every few days—not constantly, but enough to keep me engaged. At first, it made me anxious, but I convinced myself I was overthinking since we weren’t even in the same place.

When we got back, he sent me a voice note saying he has feelings for me and thinks I’m beautiful (classic line), but he can’t stop thinking about how our long-term goals don’t align—he wants to live up north, and I want to stay down south. He also admitted he’d been distant, avoiding me like a coward, and knew this would upset me. That part hurt because it felt like he’d been stringing me along while I was questioning everything.

Then, he has the audacity to say he wants to meet for a coffee “to clear the air” because we have good banter and he doesn’t want to lose that.

WTF? Is he just stringing me along, or does he genuinely not know what he wants? It’s also frustrating because everyone keeps saying I’m way out of his league (which I hate because I really did like him), but I’m at the point where I don’t think I can bounce back from this.

I’ve told him I don’t think meeting up would help either of us, but I’m second-guessing myself. Is that the right move? What do you think his intentions are?

The thing is I don’t ever fall for guys, but since the day I met him I honestly for some reason couldn’t stop thinking about him. Part of me wants to send him a voice note telling him how I feel, that for some reason we click and there is undeniable chemistry. I feel we never gave it a try and I think if we really got to know each other it would work. I understand his long term plans might misalign but if you like someone enough you compromise. But at the same time his past behaviours of leading me on and dipping out im not sure this will change and if he’s someone to rely on.

*Terran Mercenary ship* Twilight Rose

The trip home was remarkably calm until Gryzzk stepped back onto the ship. He'd gotten off last to make sure that everyone was able to make their way back, most visibly relaxing in the ship gravity.

And then he looked up to see Chief Tucker glaring at him.

""Cap. Conference room.""

""Something in Engineering I should be aware of?""

""Nope."" Tucker marched to the bridge and went straight to the conference room, not even looking to see if Gryzzk was following.

Once they arrived, Gryzzk checked to make sure Nhoot was asleep – and she was, with a dozen or so twilight roses scattered around her and Rhipl'i. He made a cup of tea in his new mug, and finally went to the conference room to see what had Tucker's fur up. He did note that Rosie was glancing at the conference room, with her scent of nervous fear and concern overpoweringly strong. They definitely needed to dial that down a bit.

Tucker had a mug of coffee that was not entirely coffee, which he drank deeply from before staring at Gryzzk. ""Okay Cap, stop fuckin' around and tell me this is a joke.""

""Chief, you need to elaborate please."" The few brightwines he'd had were making Gryzzk a little slow. Plus he needed to stall a little to figure out what had transpired. And the Chief's scent was one of alcohol and confusion.

Tucker pointed out to the bridge. ""Rosie.""

""That was not an elaboration.""

""She wants to *date* me?!"" Tucker ran a hand through his hair.

""Yes. Frankly, I'm pleased I'm not the only one who thinks it odd, Chief.""

""...Well, now what?""

""Chief. She's effectively a Terran-Vilantian-Hurdop hybrid. That means she has personality aspects from all of our cultures. The first question then is...do you want to date her?""

""You're the one with the nose that makes marriages, you tell me."" Tucker’s voice sounded a bit cross.

""It would be unfair to press Vilantian culture on you. What does the Terran culture say about it?""

""Lots of different things. But overall dating an AI is for folks way out in the weeds and while I'm sure as shit damaged goods, I dunno if I'm that damaged."" He took a drink from his mug. ""Fucksakes now I'm thinking about it. I mean hell, couldn't be any worse than my third ex-wife."" He slumped in his chair.

Gryzzk stood, walked for a moment, and sat on the arm of his chair to imitate Terran casualness. ""I did just say it would be unfair to press Vilantian culture on you but recent events notwithstanding, when we are granted permission for additional spouses, we seek them out on our own with minimal input from the nobles above us. It is...significant. That we are trusted with a part of the Clan legacy."" He paused, trying to figure where exactly he was going with this through a brightwine haze. ""So, what you and Rosie do on your own time is your own affair. I will not pry, but I'm not sure if the rest of the bridge squad will be so discrete. They seem to hope for good things for the pairing.""

""They do, huh?"" Tucker finished his coffee and paused, contemplating. ""Dating a ship. And if I screw it up, things could get pretty interesting.""

""Define 'interesting', Chief.""

""Oh God oh God we're all gonna die."" Tucker's response seemed automatic, and he chuckled in spite of himself as he walked out, waving a mug at Rosie to beckon her to follow. ""C'mon. We can talk and babysit the ship for a bit, Cap needs his rest. And lord do we have a lot to talk about.""

Rosie's joy-scent was overpowering as she floated, causing Gryzzk to sneeze as she walked out. It seemed like a start, but he was going to have to think about it in the morning. He carefully fell into bed so as not to disturb Nhoot.

Morning came far too early but on the up side, the ship seemed to be in a fine mood. Rosie was very giggly as she approached Gryzzk.

""Just us for breakfast today, My Lord Captain. Chief Tucker stayed up very late while we were talking.""

""We'll allow it this time – note for the record that Chief Tucker is on shore leave today.""

""Yes My Lord Captain."" Rosie and Gryzzk went to breakfast and found that Nhoot had been very busy putting roses in various locations through the ship.

As they settled in, Rosie was smelling close to normal – it seemed that she'd learned finer control over her scent in the course of the evening. But she was still enthusiastic.

Gryzzk raised his hand before Rosie could start talking. ""I promised Chief Tucker discretion.""

Rosie nodded before lowering her voice. ""He fell asleep an hour ago. We talked, and he is...he has concerns, but he is willing to acknowledge my feelings as genuine. He says this is unlike any relationship he's ever had, and I think that might be a good thing.""

""I should hope so."" Gryzzk wanted to eat slowly, but the general mood of the ship and talking with Rosie seemed to move him to do things faster than he preferred. Before he knew it he was done with breakfast and sipping his tea.

""We should be leaving. We'll be home in a few days, I know that Grezzk misses you terribly. That may be why you're moving thirty-eight percent faster than usual, My Lord Captain. I have additional communications from the Trade Cooperative that may interest you.""

""Continue after we've settled morning business."" They entered the bridge, where Gryzzk settled down in his command chair. ""XO, what's new?""

""On the planet, there seems to be a rash of activity, mostly surrounding twilight roses. The applicants for employment and/or marriage are now totaling fifteen thousand - they have all been advised that you are not seeking a second, third, or two-thousandth wife at this time. Employment offers are being held for review. Private Kastiv in medical won the betting pool by guessing the total number of applications to within seven. We've been advised by traffic control that we have permission to leave, and the *Voided Warranty* has left orbit as of two hours ago. The optimal window for our exit is in five minutes.""

""Lieutenant Hoban, you heard the XO. Anything further?""

""Personal storage lockers for all crew members now contain at least one bottle of your clan's wine. I believe we emptied the city's entire stock."" Rosie looked quite pleased to say that.

""We did not make a great deal of wine, compared to others.""

""Commercially successful. We have received messages from the Emissaries on Hurdop Prime; they are settling in and are formulating plans based on their new station and available resources. No decisive actions yet, but they do not appear to be waiting to be told what to do.""

""This seems good.""

The ship moved and began the several hours of system transit, with message traffic slowing and finally stopping altogether when the viewscreen changed to R-space. Reilly started humming her down-the-river song as she grabbed a toothbrush and began methodically cleaning her station.

Rosie smiled. ""And one more item, My Lord Captain. The paperwork has been completed for the marriages. Under the clan affiliation, it seems that everyone selected from the ship chose to be name themselves of Clan A'Gryzzk.""

Gryzzk blinked. ""There is no such clan.""

Rosie shrugged by way of reply. ""Nevertheless, that is what the paperwork states.""

The muffled laughter from the bridge indicated that this was something the Terrans had known about before Rosie had told Gryzzk.

The R-space transit was smooth and routine - as such things went. Gryzzk deferred to Rosie when it time for the court session to commence to address fines. Unlike O'Brien, Rosie changed her appearance to include a vertically black-and-white striped shirt, exceptionally dark sunglasses, a whistle, and a long walking stick which she used as a prop. Among the normal fines for improper behavior were additional fines to everyone who had found a spouse for 'forgetting to tell the Captain that he's their Lord', as well as an additional fine to Gryzzk himself for 'forgetting to declare his Lordship before the Council', with each fine being punctuated with a whistle. Afterward instead of the normal movie was a slideshow of pictures and videos that everyone had taken on shore leave. Gryzzk's pictures of Nhoot in the park were well-received, as were several videos of the Terrans making absolute fools of themselves in multiple gravity-related incidents. The crowning touch of the night came from Engineering - someone had flown a camera low over the A'kifab estate; despite the changes and lack of a specific tree, there was something in his heart that swelled as he recognized places - the small cottages that divided the fields, the flower gardens where he and Grezzk had met and had their first meeting, and in the distance the arch where first his lord and then the next day he had wed. Even the personal shuttlepad where events had taken place. The room had gone quiet as it started, and then slowly a Terran song began playing. It was a slow dirge of sorts, singing a plea to a misty eye of the mountain below, imploring it to keep careful watch over the souls of the singers' brothers. The Terrans picked up the song and began pleading that if the sky were filled with fire and smoke to keep watching over Gryzzk's sons.

Gryzzk wasn't sure if that was the actual lyric, but the sentiment was real enough. The Terrans continued to sing softly about seeing fire, blood in the breeze, and end with the hope that they would be remembered. After the song ended the lights came up, and Gryzzk smelled something he'd caught a few times before; he recognized camaraderie, but the scent from the Terrans was off, like a deep fire smoldering in ash. It was concerning enough that he caught up to O'Brien to inquire. Her reply was straightforward.

""Cap. Your home's beautiful. Say what you will about being just a lead servant or whatever it was, but that was your home. Everyone here knows it and we know it got took from you. Gives us all something to work for. That your home's back in the proper hands, if for no other reason than we'd wanna sit and have a drink and watch the twilight with you."" She paused. ""Maybe with a porch that's got a Terran level of gravity to it maybe, but still. It's the thought. Night Cap.""

Gryzzk was left confused, and began thinking back, trying to analyze when these things had all assembled in such a manner as to have him in this place. It was perhaps a bit much to consider over the course of an evening, so he let it settle as he fell into bed with the faint scent of roses in his nose.

In the morning, Gryzzk blinked himself awake and went through the morning routines – breakfast with Chief Tucker seemed lighter somehow; his scent was almost cheerful as he talked with Rosie about the repairs and adjustments that were going to come after this shakedown cruise had completed. Occasionally Gryzzk had to ask them for a simpler explanation – they paused, snickered softly and proceeded with what they called 'Captain Dummy talk'. Overall, breakfast seemed to take a bit longer as Tucker lingered over 'one last cup of coffee' twice, finally leaving only when he was alerted to something by one of his squad.

""It's going to be good to be home, My Lord Captain."" Rosie's ears had a small wiggle to them as they left the mess hall. ""I need a body so that I can try bouncing a cred off of Patty's ass.""

""I cannot disagree with the first statement, and I did *not* need that visual in my head from the second, Rosie."" Gryzzk walked to the bridge where Reilly was industriously cleaning with a toothbrush, still humming happily as she went about her assigned duties. The rest of the bridge squad was there as the countdown to their R-space exit was above the viewscreen. At fifteen minutes prior to exit in accordance with the standing orders, the bridge crew took a mandatory bathroom break, and Nhoot and Jonesy were subsequently secured in the captain's cabin.

The exit from R-space was smooth, but what greeted them was not. Six ships bearing the crest of Vilantia moved and arranged themselves in a formation with their engines toward each other, forming a star with their broadsides toward the *Twilight Rose*. Their weapons were charged and ready. Gryzzk swallowed as he recognized the pattern from the war sections of the news – the Throne's Star, a formation that had seen a great deal of use as it allowed all ships to fire and subsequently maneuver to keep their weapons firing.

Gryzzk failed to keep the tremble out of his voice. He'd been able to command a few things and do well, but outnumbered against the pride of the Vilantian fleet was an entirely different matter. ""Scan. We need. We need time to do something.""

Reilly was calm as she reported. ""Captain, they're hailing us but they wish to speak to the XO. They advise that you are not to speak – and they're requesting that you not be seen.""

Gryzzk nodded, opening his tablet for a text channel with the bridge team. Rosie took a deep breath, moving herself to obscure what Gryzzk was doing. ""Oh they want to talk to me, do they..."" Her scent was parts amused and furious as she addressed the crew. ""All hands, this is the XO - non-essential personnel to their quarters, prepare for maneuvers.""

The bridge comm projection came to life, showing a well-groomed Vilantian, his uniform pressed gold and swagger stick in hand.

""Commodore A'Drapir addresses the executive officer. Executive officer, surrender your vessel and the criminals aboard, immediately.""

Rosie snorted. ""Why don't you and the rest of your ships talk about this over a nice hot cup of go-fuck-yourself, ya fuckin' overgrown labradoodle. Just because you and the rest of the brick house found The Show don't mean you're in The Show."" Her voice had taken on an accent similar to the one she had when she was first activated.

A message from Rosie appeared on Gryzzk's tablet, with her name punctuated by an image of a twilight rose: 'Stalling. Cy-war suite shows weaknesses. Can throw off targeting just enough.'

Gryzzk tapped out messages. 'Throne's Star Formation difficult to counter. Send distress message.'

The reply was disheartening, despite Reilly having a picture of a Vilantian next to her name. 'Long-range comms jammed. R-space buoy with sitrep launched.""

During this, Commodore A'Drapir had scowled at Rosie. ""This is the Third Vilantian Warfleet, twilight-blinded fools. Six ships that are the pride of Vilantian tactical warfare. We are here by the Throne's order, and we do as the Minister of War commands. Then we will take our place as the Sword of the Light Gods to bring economic security to the homeworld and show this sector where the true might lies.""

The positive thing about this back and forth was that it allowed Gryzzk to focus solely on his tablet, his mind shifting from blind panic to less panicked and trying to find a plan of action. He tapped quickly - 'They'll open fire and then maneuver. Ideas?'

A flurry of messages scrolled past, with Gryzzk identifying each message by the picture next to their name - 'I can backfeed their comm channel; we're getting lag that suggests all the ships are listening. Keep them from talking.' Edwards had a picture of a stylized diamond. 'Sensors showing all the ships together are a match for us. Weak points found, relayed to tactical.'

In response to the Commodore's statement, Rosie snorted. ""If you're trying to scare me, you should know I saw your mother's naked grey ass. After seeing that the only you can threaten me with is your sister's nudes. They give prizes for ugly and stupid on Vilantia? Cause your slippery when wet family *won* that mess. Now that I feel sanctified, what do we get if we actually do the dumb thing and surrender to you titfuckers?""

There was a growl from the Commodore. ""Your ship will be claimed as an honorable prize of war. The Vilantians and Hurdop aboard will face summary execution. The Terrans aboard that do not resist will be imprisoned and bartered properly in accordance with the law.""

Hoban had a picture of some unknown lines and dashes in a circle with the word serenity across it. 'If we can keep them from moving I can launch us into their engine dead-spot and hold station as long as the shields last. Fore thrusters engaged, ready to make Chief T cry.' Finally there was a First Sergeants' rank next to O'Brien. 'Reilly, backfeed Sons of Scotland over their comms and you're off Toothbrush Duty. Railguns hot, I'll need spin to bring plasma to bear on all ships.' Gryzzk nodded a little. He was still fairly certain they were going to lose, but at least they'd have company in the afterlife. He swallowed hard as he sent his message. 'Do it. XO, insult him with twilight. He'll open fire on us after that. Probably.'

Rosie's message appeared. 'Can do, just gotta find out why. I'm recording this mess.' Then she shot back at the Commodore. ""Executed? *Fer what*?!""

The Commodore stood, looking entirely too smug. ""For whatever is deemed suitable. Treason, piracy, associating with the Hurdop, heresy – the list is endless.""

Rosie appeared to be considering the Commodore's last statement. ""Alright Commodore Fancy Dancer you're gonna have to check your comms because someone just pirated this channel and sent the stupidest message I've ever heard. Fucksakes they need to go to the box and feel shame already."" She paused. ""On the other hand maybe I should talk to them and you can go do something useful like lick your balls in the twilight.""

The Commodore's fur snapped out in fury. ""All ships *open fire*!""

Gryzzk was thrown back in his chair as Hoban released the burnout and his ears were assaulted with O'Brien's version of music. The ship itself was hit multiple times as plasma scorched through their shields and hit the hull.

""XO, I thought you broke their targeting?!""

""I did! I appear to have actually fixed their targeting.""

""Un-fix it please. Tactical, shield status.""

""Holding but I got less time than I like, I need hard spin now."" O'Brien's voice was calm as she tapped her controls and volleyed first the railguns into the engine compartments and then subsequently raked the hulls with plasma of their own. The end result was that the *Twilight Rose* was the only ship that could move after the initial engagement, but not the only one that could fire. Hoban was good, dodging multiple shots while giving O'Brien enough stability to return fire. But those moments of stability were giving the ships of the Third Fleet enough time to return fire accurately, despite Rosie's electronic mayhem. Rosie winced with each hit, reporting damage automatically as her projection changed to reflect the damage the ship was taking. ""Port thrusters offline. Shields at five percent. Engineering coffeemaker offline. Starboard plasma cannons at thirty percent. Engines at forty percent. Hull integrity eighty-seven percent. Communications at ninety-two percent.""

Gryzzk started running through options. ""If we disengage, what are our odds.""

O'Brien answered. ""Minimal Captain – we run, they'll have a nice fat lock on target a blind man could hit, and then it gets ugly.""

""Hoban, slow-dive through the center of their formation if we can – buy some time for repairs. O'Brien, target their weapon clusters with...something.""

Hoban objected lightly. ""Cap, we do that we'll be in a world of hurt from their engines – they got some radiation bleed that's gonna penetrate.""

O'Brien's scent was predatory as she replied. ""Oh, I got something. Just gotta convince the system that these ships are big-ass missiles...done.""

Gryzzk paused for a moment to silently beg the living gods to be merciful to his crew. ""Do it.""

Hoban was a master at work as he jinked, dove and parked the ship back in the perversely safe area formed by the Third Fleets' formation – after that O'Brien went to work with the railguns and the anti-missile weapons, sending projectiles through several hulls. It was frightening and elating to Gryzzk all at once. They were actually fighting six of the best warships in the Vilantian fleet, and holding their own. A detached portion of Gryzzk's mind marveled at how his bridge crew was able to manage to act as if they had a chance. But at the same time, they were damaged and worn. If only the *Voided Warranty* hadn't left early. If only the distress call had gone out sooner. If...if...if...

Edwards' voice cut through the alerts and focused Gryzzk to the now. ""Captain, I got a dozen contacts coming in hot and hard."" There was a pause. ""IFF pinging green, it's the Cav."" Her voice betrayed the relief they all felt.

The Third Fleet ceased fire to assess the new unknown-to-them contacts, as Reilly patched in a channel. The image of Major Williams resolved shakily.

""Captain Gryzzk, throwing a party without us?"" In the background there was an odd horn blowing some sort of call.

""I ah, didn't realize there was a...party, until it had started.""

""Damn shame. We'll see what they say about us party-crashers in a sec."" Major Williams nodded. ""Sparks, hail them.""

The image of the Commodore resolved again, joining the Majors' as Major Williams began to speak. ""This is Major Williams, commanding officer of Bravo Company of the 7th Cavalry Mercenary Company. You are being given one chance - stand down and transmit surrender. If you do so, we will transmit your coordinates for a tow to that nice new station that you're building. After that you'll be sent an invoice for the repair of Captain Gryzzk's ship and combat bonuses to his crew aboard the *Twilight Rose*. The alternative is that you pass along the names of your next of kin, and we use you for light target practice. After we've put enough holes in your hull to let all the air out, we'll tow you to port and any ships we can't repurpose for our own fleet will be sold to the highest bidder, with the funds going to repair the *Twilight Rose* and offset our other expenditures. Anything after that'll be distributed properly - and the thought of selling six Vilantian warships is making my calculator *drool* right now.""

The Commodore snarled at the mention of Gryzzk's name. ""Why should we pay for doing as the Clan Way commands?""

Major Williams shrugged. ""Well, there's something of a code among mercenary companies. More like guidelines really, but one of the ones we pay attention to is you don't take potshots at another companies' ships. If you're opposite sides of a job, then everyone takes their lumps. But seeing as how you didn't respond to our hail with an announcement that you were on a job, I'm gonna assume you're doing this off the books. And before you make a crazy last stand decision, I'mma remind you that *one* ship associated with the 7th just tore your entire fleet a shiny new asshole while outnumbered six to one. Use your imagination as to what happens now that you're outnumbered two to one.""

""Two point one six-repeating to one, sir."" The voice of the *Voided Warranty*'s AI added smoothly.

""Thank you, Warren.""

An eternal moment passed before there was a headlift from the Commodore. ""We. We surrender.""

""Good choice. Transmitting coordinates and tow request. *Voided Warranty* out."" The image flickered momentarily before the image of the Major turned to address Gryzzk. ""You need a tow, Captain?""

Gryzzk smiled in spite of himself. ""We still have some engines, and I do not believe Chief Tucker or Rosie would forgive me if I authorized a tow. An escort would not go amiss, however.""

There was a chuckled response. ""Fair enough. Forming up for escort, lead us home Captain.""

As the transmission faded, a wave of exhaustion and relief swept over Gryzzk. None of the war reports he'd ever seen showed the Third Fleet in surrender or defeat. Though that may have been point. On the positive side, he could smell the rest of his bridge squad in a similar state.

""Lieutenant Hoban. Set course for Homeplate, best speed we can manage. I'll be touring the ship with the XO and Ensign Nhoot.""

Hoban maneuvered the ship back through the Third Fleets' engines one last time in a bit of a cheeky insult, but once completed the *Twilight Rose* accelerated toward home. As Rosie called the ship to stand down and begin repairs, Gryzzk walked through the ship, hearing the crew beginning to sing.

*Oh, misty eye of the mountain below*  
*Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls*  
*And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke*  
*Keep watching over A’Gryzzk's sons...*

So, I’ve been in this weird on-and-off thing with a guy for a year, and I honestly can’t figure out his intentions. Here’s the backstory:

We met through his brother, who’s a good friend of mine, and hit it off. He slid into my DMs last February after moving to London post-breakup and years of traveling. He was dealing with anxiety and adjusting to life here, and I tried to be understanding.

We went on a coffee date, and it was lovely, but soon after, he told me his life was “too busy” to take things further. I appreciated his honesty, even though it hurt. Later, he randomly bought me some food from an Arabic shop (we’re from the same niche country), invited me to his birthday (which I couldn’t attend), and told a friend of mine that I was beautiful but that he couldn’t give 100% to anything due to his anxiety. I thought okay, he’s clearly not in a place for a relationship, so I left him alone.

Then, in November, he slid back into my DMs, and I thought maybe he was in a better headspace. We went on another date, but he had a panic attack after an hour and had to leave. I completely understood because I have bad anxiety myself. He apologized and asked me out for drinks, which turned out to be a really lovely time. We talked about our long-term goals—he wants to move to the countryside, and so do I—and we seemed to really click. We kissed, kept messaging, and I honestly thought this could go somewhere.

The following week, he asked to see me twice, but things started to unravel. He canceled the first date last minute, sending a voice note at 6:30 PM saying he was ill. I had this gut feeling he wasn’t being entirely truthful, and I didn’t want to get my hopes up again, so I preemptively canceled the second date. I told him we should “rain check” because I didn’t want to risk getting sick before my trip, but really, I was just trying to protect myself from being let down again.

We agreed to see each other after the holidays, and during that month apart, he’d message me every few days—not constantly, but enough to keep me engaged. At first, it made me anxious, but I convinced myself I was overthinking since we weren’t even in the same place.

When we got back, he sent me a voice note saying he has feelings for me and thinks I’m beautiful (classic line), but he can’t stop thinking about how our long-term goals don’t align—he wants to live up north, and I want to stay down south. He also admitted he’d been distant, avoiding me like a coward, and knew this would upset me. That part hurt because it felt like he’d been stringing me along while I was questioning everything.

Then, he has the audacity to say he wants to meet for a coffee “to clear the air” because we have good banter and he doesn’t want to lose that.

WTF? Is he just stringing me along, or does he genuinely not know what he wants? It’s also frustrating because everyone keeps saying I’m way out of his league (which I hate because I really did like him), but I’m at the point where I don’t think I can bounce back from this.

I’ve told him I don’t think meeting up would help either of us, but I’m second-guessing myself. Is that the right move? What do you think his intentions are?

The thing is I don’t ever fall for guys, but since the day I met him I honestly for some reason couldn’t stop thinking about him. Part of me wants to send him a voice note telling him how I feel, that for some reason we click and there is undeniable chemistry. I feel we never gave it a try and I think if we really got to know each other it would work. I understand his long term plans might misalign but if you like someone enough you compromise. But at the same time his past behaviours of leading me on and dipping out im not sure this will change and if he’s someone to rely on. Do I spill my heart and tell him how I feel or just walk away",2,1737129779.0,AskMenAdvice,6,1.0,False

In the age of digital everything, the art of giving has evolved. Gone are the days of cash-filled envelopes and clunky checks. Enter: crypto donations. They're sleek, they're instant, and thanks to the magic of blockchain, they're taking philanthropy to the next level. If you haven’t jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon yet, don’t worry.

# Why Crypto Donations? Because the Future is Now

First, let’s address the obvious: why should you care about accepting crypto donations? Isn’t fiat currency good enough? Well, yes, but fiat is so 20th century. Here’s why crypto is stealing the show:

1. **Global Reach**: Crypto doesn’t care about borders. A donation from a coffee shop in Tokyo? A generous gift from a library in Paris? All possible within seconds.
2. **Transparency**: Thanks to blockchain, every transaction is traceable. Donors love knowing their money’s journey, and you’ll appreciate the added trust.
3. **Lower Fees**: Forget the “processing fees” that make your heart sink. Crypto transactions typically come with smaller fees, leaving more funds for your cause.

In short, accepting crypto donations is not just a techy trend—it’s a savvy move to stay relevant in our digital-first world.

The Absolute Crack Lookism Brainrot

Daniel’s second body is chilling on a bench at 3 a.m., peacefully eating ramen, when out of nowhere, Vasco shows up. Not regular Vasco—Vasco wearing a tutu and screaming, “The streets need art!” He starts doing pirouettes in the middle of the sidewalk, and somehow, all the delinquents join in because they’re terrified of his raw enthusiasm. Zack and Mira pass by, and Zack, trying to impress Mira, goes, “I can do that too.” Spoiler: he cannot. He trips, lands in a trash can, and somehow manages to roll downhill, screaming the whole way.

Meanwhile, Gun and Goo are having a serious showdown over who makes the best coffee (why are they in an abandoned café? No one knows). Gun’s espresso machine breaks, so Goo starts juggling coffee beans like they’re grenades. It ends with Goo spilling whipped cream all over Gun, and for once, Gun’s poker face cracks. Cue Goo’s maniacal laughter echoing across the city.

Back in Hostel, Johan finds a stray cat and names it... Gun (because it’s small and angry-looking). The cat starts following him everywhere, and no one knows if Johan even realizes how ironic this is. Meanwhile, Jake Kim is trying to rally Big Deal, but no one’s listening because Sinu brought donuts, and someone turned on karaoke. The karaoke machine breaks when Jerry sings too loud, and somehow this results in an all-out food fight.

The finale? Daniel’s original body finally wakes up in this chaos and immediately wishes he hadn’t. “Just one normal day,” he mutters, before Vasco runs past with Zack still stuck in the trash can, screaming, “IT’S ART!”

My journey started because I would pass out at the doctor's every single time I went. I had a full workup done (cardiac, neuro, etc.) and everything was normal so they referred me to a therapist.

I couldn't keep still and my mind was racing and it was overwhelming and I ended up passing out. My anxiety pretty much tripled for that week and a half and my wife wanted me off of the med, but reading through everyone's experiences here made me stay the course -- and I'm so glad I did.

  
After the first week and a half it made me feel like I wanted to do things. I was in a good mood most of the time. I felt like how I used to feel when I was a kid. These invisible barriers that mentally prevented me from doing things and saying things mostly dissolved. I could make eye contact with strangers! I was more intimate with my wife through small signs of physical and verbal affection. It's like before I had barriers and filters and now they've mostly gone away. Driving doesn't give me anxiety anymore. Going to the gym doesn't make me feel like all eyes are on me anymore. It's honestly a great feeling and it feels like it was subtle, but impactful. There was no switch that turned on like ""omg I'm cured!"" it was more of a feeling like things are...better. I still get a little bit of anxiety here and there, but it's more subdued and goes away very quickly.

  
I haven't had a doctor's appointment yet so I'm not too optimistic that it will help in that regard yet, but possibly with more therapy and exposure I could one day hope to not pass out anymore lol. Anyways I just wanted to share my experience. I can't believe how I used to feel wasn't ""normal"" and I don't want to go back!",1,1737129270.0,prozac,0,1.0,False

Yesterday, I (F23) went out clubbing with my two best male friends (also 23) and we ended up fighting. For narration purposes, let’s call them James and Thomas. At the start of the night one of them asked me what I thought about a post. 

Apparently, a girl who he went on two dates with James in August posted a picture for her days on a beach on insta and one of the many pictures was of a coffee cup in front of a beautiful beach view. James says that that picture is meant for him because he replied to a story of her drinking coffee the day before and she left him on seen. Honestly, I saw no relationship between these two events and told him she probably posted the picture of the coffee because because she liked the picture and that she didn’t answer because she probably didn’t want to. He however, was sure that that picture was meant for him. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Now, it’s important to explain that I got dumped at a New Year’s Eve party this year and it’s been really tough. I don’t usually drink or party that much but last night I wanted some fun. We went to the first night club and James made out with a girl. Thomas and I just danced for a bit. In the second club however, a guy danced with me for a bit and later James and Thomas told me we should get going. I said goodbye to the guy who had been funny, sweet and nice and went with my friends.

However we didn’t leave they just wanted to dance in another part of the club with less people. They told me they saw him earlier dancing with another woman and that it looked like they were going to kiss. Honestly, I didn’t really care like they did about this. 

We stayed there for a while and told them I wanted to go to the bathroom. On my way to the bathroom I ran into the guy I was dancing with earlier and he we started talking again. Just to check, I asked if he had been dancing with his gf earlier and he said he was single. We danced some more and made out for two seconds when James came and told me once again that we were leaving. 

Again, I said goodbye to the guy I was with and this time we actually left.

They got some food at a McDonald’s and while they were eating they started criticizing me for making out with the guy. Again they said he had been dancing with someone else and I said I didn’t care. Then they said he wasn’t hot enough, which again I said I didn’t care. And then James specifically said I had been acting “desperate, boy-crazy” and that I wasn’t valuing myself. 

I got angry and told them they were exaggerating and that I just wanted a fun night out to not think about my ex. Once again, James told me that I just looked “desperate” and made a fool out of myself. 

I called for an Uber and remained silent. When the Uber arrive he told me that I had no right to get mad because I also told him that the coffee picture meant nothing and that he was mad at me because of that.  

I left in the Uber and woke up angry, but now I don’t know who was right or if I really did overreact. 

I think I got angry because I felt there was a huge double standard. Both James and Thomas, ALWAYS only talk about women. How they don’t get any, how all women are “bitches” and how they would do anything to get a beautiful woman, And I am desperate one? I always got annoyed at these types of comments, specially when they just criticize women, and even though I try to impartial and objective with my friends, OF COURSE I defend I these conversations. 

I also think that they criticized me yesterday for kissing a guy but a few hours earlier James had donde exactly the same and Thomas celebrated this. I feel like James should apologize for being mean but I am not sure if I am really in the right here? Maybe I did hurt his feelings with the coffee picture? Maybe, I am just heartbroken and kind of in an “I hate men” phase and overreacted to this situation.

---

Last week they told me my life's work was over. 

""Pack it up. All the songs have been written, all the possibilities exhausted. There's nothing more to do here.""

It rang false to me: I'd heard so many refrains in a similar key from naysayers ever since I'd started my career. There was no money in making up silly tunes and even sillier lyrics to go with them. People I looked up to had gone through a similar song and dance years ago. How could you copyright music notes?

But this time was different. The evidence was overwhelming. We'd crossed a tipping point and now every piece of music that seemed fresh and new was really nothing more than a variation of the many, many copyrighted pieces that had come before. They'd proved it mathematically. Somehow. 

I wasn't a mathematician. Even the for-dummies breakdown which made its way to the front pages of all the major publications went over my head. Still, I should have said something. I should have protested at a bunch of know-nothing executives reducing my life's passion to meaningless noise.

But I didn't. What did I know? Only that music made me happy, that I'd been in this game for far too long to roll over and submit to necessity. If I had to give up my life's passion, I was going to go down swinging.  

I held on thanks to my friends in the industry even as the gigs dried up, even as I recognized the telltale marks of AI in more and more commercial jingles and movie soundtracks. One by one those contacts pivoted to other areas in the field, were laid off, or simply resigned to pursue more stable career paths. 

I moved on too, eventually. I found short-term work wherever I could to keep myself afloat. I tried to forget. 

Nothing worked. No matter how hard I tried, the songs remained in my head. They were my personal soundtrack as I unloaded boxes at warehouses, entered numbers in columns on spreadsheets and copied the results to other spreadsheets. No doubt an algorithm running on a massive server farm somewhere had spat out those exact melodies years ago, to be copyrighted by whatever entertainment conglomerate owned the setup. 

But they felt fresh and new to me. 

I hummed in the breakroom sometimes while drinking my coffee. Mostly I was ignored, but occasionally one or two colleagues glanced around with a startled look. 

""I know that song too!"" they would exclaim, before going on to describe the latest radio hit that resembled the tune I'd invented (or thought I'd invented) on the spur of the moment.

For the past few months, I've been struggling to wake up at 6am - a personal goal of mine - no matter how early I go to bed. I've pushed my bedtime back to 9:30pm, but to no avail. I still sleep in until 8-9am. Even then, I feel the urge to keep sleeping. I have to basically force myself out of bed every morning. Then, I feel the urge to nap in the afternoons. Sometimes I give in and I end up napping for 2-3 hours. I used to not be able to nap at all. I've been relying on coffee AND my ADHD meds just to function and stay awake. 

For context, I've gotten a sleep apnea test and the results were normal. I'm on a cocktail of meds to control my bipolar disorder. But, these particular meds don't cause sleepiness and I've been on them for a pretty long time with no side effects. This fatigue issue is relatively recent. I also have hypothyroidism but since taking levothyroxine, my TSH has been in the normal range. Also got T3 and T4 tests done. No anemia and I take vitamin D supplements since I spend a lot of time up north. I've also gotten a B12 shot and taken a B complex OTC but haven't felt any difference.

The weirdest part is, when I'm sleep deprived (anywhere from 4-6 hours of sleep), I actually feel better than usual and I don't get as much of an urge to nap. Any ideas as to why this might be? Are there any other labs or tests I should ask my doctor about?",1,1737128781.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

A little context, I work in an 8am-5pm Monday-Friday office with about a 30 minute commute. I also love my sleep and have a hard time waking up in the mornings so I don’t really do my makeup often or if I do it’s just a little concealer and mascara so I don’t look as tired as I feel. I recently got a free gift from Sephora with some foundation/concealer samples and FENTY was one of the brands in the box. I absolutely fell in love with it and went out to purchase the foundation and concealer that weekend. So onto the actual story; I have three African-American women coworkers (I promise this is relevant) and the rest of our office is predominantly white women. My boyfriend and I had plans the other night after work to meet up with a few friends for drinks and dinner but I just kept hitting snooze that morning and decided to do my makeup on my lunch break at my desk. We have an open floor plan at work so we can all see each other for the most part at our desks. I started doing my makeup on my lunch break at my desk and my coworker (we’ll call her A) came up. We’re pretty close and go out for the occasional coffee, lunch, after work drinks but not exactly best friends. For example, if one of us were to leave our job we might text occasionally but it would probably only be for a few months and then we would just remain Facebook friends until one of us decided to finally unfriend. I thought she just wanted to chat or maybe go get something to eat. She started asking about my makeup and pointed to the FENTY foundation and the lipstick I was about to apply. I told her the story blah blah blah and then she got weird. I asked if she was okay and she was very upset telling me that I shouldn’t be using those products as they were made by a black woman for black women. I was stunned for a minute and didn’t really know what to say and she started getting increasingly agitated. She was raising her voice at this point accusing me of appropriating and that I should know better since I have black friends and family members and I myself am a Hispanic woman (I’m very olive skinned though and look more like my dad who’s white) so it would be like her showing up in a sombrero. I just kind of stuttered out that they have shades for all different skin tones and even half the models for her ads are different ethnicities and races. She started actually yelling at this point that it’s just marketing and the lighter shades are for light skinned or mixed black women. Now most of the office that was still there for lunch have stopped and are staring at us. I got really red and didn’t know what to say so I just kept saying I’m sorry I don’t know what you want me to do I’m not throwing it away this was like $30. She stormed off and screamed that she’s going to HR. Well, later I did indeed get an email from HR to schedule a meeting. HR basically just told me that A was really upset but she kept telling her that they couldn’t do anything about it because I technically didn’t do anything wrong. A didn’t like that and threatened to post online that they allow “black face” if HR didn’t do something. HR asked me to please refrain from doing my makeup in the office and hopefully it’ll just get dropped. The rest of the day was so uncomfortable and I just kept my head down and raced out at 5. The next morning half the office kept whispering and avoiding me. Come to find out, she posted the video on her private Snapchat story and now our office is torn. Some people think it’s ridiculous and said it’s just makeup and that A took it too far saying I was doing black face. Others have said that if A does feel that passionate I should have done the right thing and washed my face and thrown it out then and there. The rest just don’t want to get involved since it’s such a delicate subject and I completely understand. The problem is now I’m getting dirty looks and there’s even an email chain amongst A and the people who agree. I did a deep dive on FENTYs website and Rihanna and it really does look like the brand is for everybody. HR asked me not to engage and to stop any conversation at work about this so that’s why I’m here. So AMITAH? Is it appropriate for white people to use it? 

TLDR; I use FENTY makeup and my coworker accused me of appropriation and black face. 


EDIT TO ADD;  I did ask the associate at Sephora if it was the right shade since I was just using the sample packet I got and it looked right in my bathroom mirror and he assured me that it was a good match. I also waited until I clocked out at lunch and did my makeup at my desk since we have lots of windows and natural light in our office and the bathroom has really bad harsh lighting and it always looks awful in the sun after.

How LED Lamp Teeth Whitening Works

LED light technology has revolutionized the teeth whitening industry, providing a powerful solution for those seeking a brighter smile.

The blue light emitted by the LED lamp catalyzes the whitening gel, breaking down stubborn stains more quickly and efficiently than traditional methods. **Scientific research** has shown that this technology can significantly improve tooth whiteness in just a few sessions.

I wrote this during Christmas and it’s gonna be for when you eventually reach out to me in some way or another (about anything else other than the flat) because that’s the only way we will talk.

I loved you with all my heart. I did things wrong in the beginning and I know that. I did things I should’ve made up for that I didn’t and you did the same, I just didn’t remind you of it constantly.

I loved our time in the flat, I’m sorry you hated it. I loved cooking with you everyday and doing you little meals when you came back drunk from going out with your friends, I miss the way you used to kiss me when you were tipsy. It was like I was the only man to ever exist for you. I loved doing your coffee in the morning and helping you wake up with a kiss while we did a sleepy crossword. I loved the showers and baths we took together, the phrases we made up, the dancing, the accents, the baking, the music we both fell in love with, halloweens, the sex, the love..I loved everything, I just wish I showed it more and made it clearer to you. You’re the only person I’ve ever truly loved. crying in my mums bathroom on Christmas really solidified that for me. I went to the heath on Christmas Day and cried on what used to be our bench.

In 2024 you did *so* many things wrong and you either know that or you’re in complete denial. You knew it was over for a long time and you weren’t willing to fight for us anymore. However, you were terrified of losing me and my friendship in your life and due to that, you moved the goal posts consistently just enough to convince yourself that you were giving me a chance when all you were really doing is keeping me around to help you. To pay for the flat, give you gifts, sort out parking tickets, go on dates, receive flowers for Valentine’s Day - for all these reasons (none of which included your love for me) I’m never coming back. You were too scared until someone else came along and took my place in the flat and then you weren’t scared anymore with the extra money and you let me go easily after making it seem like it wasn’t possible for you for the longest time. you didn’t let me go because you needed what I was giving. I was being used. I wonder if you even loved me in 2024. I don’t think it would’ve been as easy for you to move on if you did so I’m trying to convince myself you didn’t just to save me some pain. I could never sleep with someone in the time you did. I’m going to be single for a long time. 

I don’t blame you for letting me go but I know you were sleeping with Dylan for some time, you don’t make sex and marriage playlists without having slept with each other a few times but you always did have a funny way of using Spotify so what do I know Mrs Tucker? Do you remember when you never even entertained the idea of taking my last name?  It makes me think, had you slept with him by the time we went to zizzi and that comedians show? I knew something was off with you that night, it made me so upset and self conscious. You didn’t touch me once. I’d never seen you so cold towards me. I thought you hated me but maybe you just hated yourself because you knew the moment I found out, I was never coming back. 

I feel like you held so many secrets from me, so many things you did that you never told me. I had never been so distrusting of someone towards the end of a relationship and I do feel like you were unfaithful to me at some point (that I dont know of)

There were so many things that I never spoke to you about more than once. I was so hurt and shocked when you kissed that girl on the nightout we got spiked and I never could talk to you about it because of the drugs. I remember you seemed so excited by the fact that you had just kissed someone else? Even after that, i let it go and I did everything I could for someone who didn’t notice a single thing that I was doing for them - in between all the dates with Adam I mean. I worked everyday to be a good little boy for you and got little to nothing in return, being forced to jealousy and begging just like you did in the beginning. Begging for you just like you did for me.

I remember being so torn up about you kissing her the morning after and you were struggling so much with your autism and the effects of us getting spiked and I just swallowed the hurt and looked after you all day. I felt awful too, outside of the overthinking about the kiss, but I just took care of my girl. I did everything I could that day to mask it. I just took care of you to forget you kissing someone else. I just didn’t know how to bring it up? With the hangover and the being drugged.. I didn’t know what to do and you were finding it so difficult and I just wanted that to stop for you. I struggled a lot with my trust after that. You gave away our us 2 being 1. Ya know? I never told you that. Maybe I should’ve. I guess if you ever find a way to contact me you’ll know then. 

I fucked up the beginning, I’ll never disagree. But damn did you show me how little I meant to you in 2024. It was done before you even said the plan wasn’t for you, you were never going to give it another shot. The presentation was a lie just another time adder to keep me around. The thought had crossed my mind a lot that this might be happening but I chose to trust you - something I can never do again. You’d already decided you liked Dylan and that’s okay but that changed me. I cant say that you’ll be my friend ever again. Someone who claims to have cared for me the way you did couldn’t fuck someone not even 6 weeks after fully breaking up right? (and that’s me being generous with the timing, you were definitely hooking up prior to that which makes me even more sick to my stomach.) this is why I can’t trust that you loved me through 2024, I think that ended in 2023 because if it didn’t, how else would you ever fuck someone new after 6 weeks? It’s because you’d been fucking him for a while. I threw up on my desk when I saw the playlists and didn’t eat for 3 days. I had never been so crushed.

I remember you once said to me that your worst fear was seeing me move on with someone quickly or seeing me be good for someone that wasn’t you. I was being good for you, you just didn’t care to notice by that point. I think that was my biggest fear too, I just never told you and I think the last couple of weeks really showed me it was my biggest fear. I think it had been my biggest fear for a long time and I hate that you put me through your (and after some reflection mine too) biggest fear. If you could feel the things i’ve felt through your actions, you wouldn’t want anything to do with me either.

I love you more than anything else I have ever done, been a part of, anyone I’ve ever liked or cared about and this still applies right this second at 9:36pm on Boxing Day.  It all pales in comparison to what I would’ve done to have had another chance with you. I was willing to work for you, I showed you over and over, the books you made me read, the podcasts you told me to listen to, the research I did into my own psychology and your psychology too so I could be fucking better for you and I never got that - I got maybe 4 times in 3 years where you genuinely apologised for something you did. That reassurance I gave you whenever you needed it, it was never returned. I asked for reassurance maybe 3 times during our relationship and you failed miserably every single time whereas at the drop of a hat, I would fight for you, protect you and try to maintain your mental health whenever it was needed. I’d chase you through the streets every time if it meant you got home safe. 

Where were my equivalents to those things you made me do? You didn’t even want to watch shows I was interested in or wanted to play games that wasn’t a game that you already liked. It broke my heart when you said you didn’t care about arcane. My favourite game of all time is making a tv show and you couldn’t have been more clear that you weren’t gonna be watching it with me because it doesn’t interest you? Ask yourself if I would’ve sat through an enscryption tv show or night in the woods  with you - you know damn well I would’ve and I’d have been hyped for you. Like what the actual fuck? I actually remember speaking to one of my friends and asking why you can just not give a shit about my interests? They didn’t know what to say. You always said I needed more interests, that’s not true. I kept them to myself because you didn’t give a single fuck about what I liked outside of feigning interest with a comment or two. Your interest in my known interests stopped pretty damn quick once we moved in and if it didn’t, it was a comment here or there. If you weren’t interested in it too, it simply didn’t matter. I think that might be a reason why i struggled to have interests in your eyes (although i agree I should’ve definitely gone out and done more things.) If it didn’t align with what you classed as an interest, i.e were you yourself interested in it? If not, it simply wasn’t. It broke my heart when you played all of our games with other people. I could never imagine playing it takes two with someone else. I don’t know why but that game was our game to me. I could never. I fell in love with you during that game and you did with me too. I could never share that with anyone else but you did that so easily. How I’d weep if I found out you had a dinkum world with someone else.

Everything in this relationship only improved me for your sake and I hate the fact that I tried to bend and mould to whatever fucking shape you wanted over and over and over again. I was so embarassing, a fucking pussy afraid of losing you. I know now that I’ll never be that person for anyone ever again, I’ll never stoop to that little level I was on begging for someone who couldn’t give less of a fuck about my actions or what they were portraying. I’m done being sweet, it brings nothing. I think you’ll be the last that got the sweet me.

Christmas has been hard and I wish you didn’t send me that card. Friends thought it was manipulative, I did a little bit too. You wanted me to think about you, good job, you got your wish and I had the worst Christmas of my life crying in the fog at the Heath at 5pm.




I’m never coming back, not as your friend or your lover or even an acquaintance. Do not send me any communication or cards. I don’t want birthday cards, I don’t want Christmas cards. I want to exist without you around. Don’t try to contact me through your friends, they’ll get blocked too. I don’t exist to you anymore. Maybe one day I’ll see you in Key Club.

I love you but you ruined me and I’ll never let that go. It could’ve been avoided. I’ll find someone who loves me for me - something that I evidently didn’t find in you. I felt like a project. I hope one day I get to be a Dad and I hope you find your popcorn person, I’m sorry it wasn’t me. I really did try. I love you. I love you so fucking much. Even now, hours after I started writing instalments of this. I’m sat in my living room balling my eyes out. I’m so sorry it had to be like this but you had one foot out of the door for the entirety of 2024, both my feet are out now.

When you begged, you received changes and plans and ways for me to improve and anything else you wanted me to do to prove my loyalty or love or will to change.

When I begged, I got nothing - it’s time you to start realising that.

I always treated you with care and love. I hope in time you’ll see that and I will pray that every man or woman you come across will give you the same.

1i3j4ok,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrumbsNewsletter/comments/1i3j4ok/the_oceanus_brass_tankard_campaign_review_this_is/,"The Oceanus Brass Tankard Campaign Review. This is a really fun and well put together campaign. The campaign video is very creative and a good inspiration for people looking to add a fun and engaging element to their videos 
","[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oceanusbrass/tankard?ref=section-homepage-projectcollection-8-staff-picks-popular&category\_id=Q2F0ZWdvcnktMjg=](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oceanusbrass/tankard?ref=section-homepage-projectcollection-8-staff-picks-popular&category_id=Q2F0ZWdvcnktMjg=)



Take a look at this campaign for an example of a well thought out campaign page and a well executed branding scheme. This product is very much a gimmick. It is a 20 pound cup. Why would anyone really NEED this. This product varies a lot from other very big kickstarter projects. Oftentimes people have a lot of success launching kitchen or tech gadgets and other things that have a very common use case. But that is why this campaign is awesome. It is purely for fun and they do a very good job of communicating that to their backers.



Not every project needs to be some super technically advanced or life changing product. This shows the importance of having a good story and marketing strategy for your kickstarter campaign. The video that this campaign includes is a very good mix of the founder talking about the company, user generated content, and other clips to bring together the theme and branding of the product. It is branded as a sailing or pirates mug and that is backed up by the pirate themed music and the many clips of the ocean and boats. However, what I really like about how this campaign approaches the pirate theme is that they do not go all in on it. The theme definitely hits on that pirate audience but isn't so pirate themed that it would scare off people who aren't looking to buy a pirate themed product. 



Sharing user generated content or clips on how the product can be used is a great way to show off your product's features in a way that resonates with audiences. They are able to communicate that the cup is very heavy and big by starting the video off with a guy smashing fruit with the cup. Obviously they are not selling a cup specifically for smashing fruit but it is a fun way to get the audience to engage and keep watching. Having some sort of excitement in your campaign video will really set yourself apart from other videos on kickstarter. Usually, they are very boring and bland. Also, the video shows people lifting up the cup full of beer and struggling to hold it up. They include not only beer, but coffee in the cup to show that it can handle both hot and cold beverages. But that is not the only way they share that piece of information. They also throw the cup into a fire to show that it is heat resistant. Now that was totally not necessary but is a super creative way to share something that is otherwise mundane. It is clear that the campaigners who founded this product love and care about the product. 



My favorite tactic that this campaign uses is that they show off a group of different people of all ages using the mug together. The way the video is set up it really seems like the cup is the center of attention at the backyard get together. This puts the idea in peoples heads that it will be a fun attraction at a friends gathering or party. This really helps build the brand up and show that it is a cool product that everyone will love. The background of the video has people clapping and cheering as someone lifts up the cup. This is a good example of how the campaigners want people to use the cup, so they include it in the video. The campaigners truly do believe they have a fun product that everyone of any age will love. So they highlight that in the video.

This is a really cool product and I can tell that they know what they are doing because they actually take you into the manufacturing process throughout the video and you can see them forming the cup from a bigger piece of metal. If you are looking to add some spice and fun to your campaign video, this is a good place to take inspiration from.

Sure, Europe has been destroyed by a thousand years of black powder warfare, but what about everywhere else? Perhaps, in other places, the Root is not worshipped - but the Bean. Enormous, fragrant flowers produce bright red cherries, who carry within their obscene swells green beans - freed from their pulps, dried and roasted, one by one, over a fire, these beans can be crushed into a powder, mixed with hot water and drunk in an intoxicating elixir. The drinkers of these concoctions can experience heightened states of awareness, productivity and mania; those who drink especially deeply might find themselves transformed into walking flower bodies in their own right, navigating by sensitive pistils.

Cist is a wet, tired land, always in search of mercenaries. The Drinkers of the Bean could do well in this place - and if they leave behind a few fruiting bodies, perhaps take it over entirely...

I had a lot of fun making these and I'm really proud of the results, for things made by a total amateur with almost zero technique! These are some Civil War Zouaves, Napoleonic Infantry and some knights, and a lot of green stuff. I started with the moka pot guys, progressed through the kind of samovar head guys and ended with the flowers - I think you can really see an improvement! I have no idea if these would work in the game itself - I doubt I'll find anyone to play with, but maybe I'll end up doing two armies. Next up is a toff - I just need to find things I can turn into a tiny coffee-grinder chariot....

I think handwritten notes, surprise dates, and the belief that small gestures make a big difference. I am someone who thrives on deep connections and meaningful interactions.

I’m someone who believes in the power of midnight conversations, in the healing balm of shared laughter, and in the silent solidarity of presence.

I believe in the power of empathy and the importance of being there for those who matter, even if it's a call at 3 AM. I value integrity, kindness, and a good/weird sense of humor. I find beauty in the mundane, the kind of person who finds joy in the little things and believes in taking the time to truly understand and appreciate others.

Physical Attributes:

* Height: 5'11"" (181cm)
* Build: Slim
* Hair: Straight Deep black, kept in check
* Eyes: Brown
* Beard: Short, fashionable, and pristinely groomed
* Complexion: Tanned, Caramel toned

**Interests:**

I find solace in music that echoes my moods, books that transport me to other worlds, and quiet moments in nature that ground me. I cherish activities that nurture growth, whether they're intellectual debates, serene walks, or shared laughs over coffee. I'm drawn to the arts as much as to the simple pleasure of a sunset.. I also have a keen interest in cooking and experimenting with new recipes, finding the act of creating something delicious for others as a form of expression and care.

To sum up some typical interests include: Philosophy, nature, languages, books, reading, writing, video games, sports, art, poetry, travelling etc

**What I Am Looking For:**

I'm in search of someone who values open and honest communication as much as I do. Someone who understands that relationships are about growth, learning, and supporting each other through life's myriad challenges and joys. I am looking for someone who is eager to prioritize getting to know each other, willing to open their heart, and ready to build something meaningful together.

Expectations:

* Mutual respect and understanding
* Openness and honesty in communication
* A shared desire to prioritize our relationship and growth
* An interest in exploring life's depths and joys together

**The Quest for You:**

What am I seeking? Not a perfect person, but a real one. Someone whose heart speaks the language of kindness, whose spirit dances to the tune of sincerity. I dream of a connection where words are just the beginning, where vulnerability is not a weakness but our strongest bond. I yearn for a love that’s both a safe harbor and a grand adventure, a partnership built on mutual respect, understanding, and the shared bravery of baring one’s soul.

I seek a fellow traveler in this journey of life, one who understands that while our pasts may shape us, they do not define us. Someone who stands at the intersection of hope and reality, ready to embark on a path not devoid of challenges but rich with the promise of true companionship.

**Epilogue of Hope:**

If my words have stirred something in your heart, if you too are navigating the vast oceans of life in search of a genuine connection, then perhaps we are two stars meant to align in the constellation of fate. I extend my hand, my heart, and my story to you – not in desperation, but with the quiet confidence of one who has faced the night and yearns for the dawn.

1i3ingj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i3ingj/should_i_apologize_or_should_they/,Should I apologize or should they? ,"Are my friends a-holes or am I just sensitive? 

Yesterday, I (F23) went out clubbing with my two best male friends (also 23) and we ended up fighting. For narration purposes, let’s call them James and Thomas. At the start of the night one of them asked me what I thought about a post. 

Apparently, a girl who he went on two dates with James in August posted a picture for her days on a beach on insta and one of the many pictures was of a coffee cup in front of a beautiful beach view. James says that that picture is meant for him because he replied to a story of her drinking coffee the day before and she left him on seen. Honestly, I saw no relationship between these two events and told him she probably posted the picture of the coffee because because she liked the picture and that she didn’t answer because she probably didn’t want to. He however, was sure that that picture was meant for him. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Now, it’s important to explain that I got dumped at a New Year’s Eve party this year and it’s been really tough. I don’t usually drink or party that much but last night I wanted some fun. We went to the first night club and James made out with a girl. Thomas and I just danced for a bit. In the second club however, a guy danced with me for a bit and later James and Thomas told me we should get going. I said goodbye to the guy who had been funny, sweet and nice and went with my friends.

However we didn’t leave they just wanted to dance in another part of the club with less people. They told me they saw him earlier dancing with another woman and that it looked like they were going to kiss. Honestly, I didn’t really care like they did about this. 

We stayed there for a while and told them I wanted to go to the bathroom. On my way to the bathroom I ran into the guy I was dancing with earlier and he we started talking again. Just to check, I asked if he had been dancing with his gf earlier and he said he was single. We danced some more and made out for two seconds when James came and told me once again that we were leaving. 

Again, I said goodbye to the guy I was with and this time we actually left.

They got some food at a McDonald’s and while they were eating they started criticizing me for making out with the guy. Again they said he had been dancing with someone else and I said I didn’t care. Then they said he wasn’t hot enough, which again I said I didn’t care. And then James specifically said I had been acting “desperate, boy-crazy” and that I wasn’t valuing myself. 

I got angry and told them they were exaggerating and that I just wanted a fun night out to not think about my ex. Once again, James told me that I just looked “desperate” and made a fool out of myself. 

I called for an Uber and remained silent. When the Uber arrive he told me that I had no right to get mad because I also told him that the coffee picture meant nothing and that he was mad at me because of that.  

I left in the Uber and woke up angry, but now I don’t know who was right or if I really did overreact. 

I think I got angry because I felt there was a huge double standard. Both James and Thomas, ALWAYS only talk about women. How they don’t get any, how all women are “bitches” and how they would do anything to get a beautiful woman, And I am desperate one? I always got annoyed at these types of comments, specially when they just criticize women, and even though I try to impartial and objective with my friends, OF COURSE I defend I these conversations. 

I also think that they criticized me yesterday for kissing a guy but a few hours earlier James had donde exactly the same and Thomas celebrated this. I feel like James should apologize for being mean but I am not sure if I am really in the right here? Maybe I did hurt his feelings with the coffee picture? Maybe, I am just heartbroken and kind of in an “I hate men” phase and overreacted to this situation.

On new years eve my  (29f) partner (29m) and I went to his family home for a party that his younger brother (24m) was throwing, he said that he had invited his main friend group as well as his hockey team. We got there before the party started, so it was nice and quiet when the first guest arrived and came down the stairs. (hereafter he shall be called BabyBird or BB for short) He introduced himself, we all chatted a bit, he seemed quite charming, that is until he started bragging that he almost got caught swigging from the wine bottle he was holding, by a cop while stopped at a red light. He had only made it about a third of the way into the bottle on his way over, and I mistakenly assumed that the risk would end there, but a couple of hours later when I found him sprawled out on the landing of the stairs and I asked him if he was alright, he said he wanted to try to go home. That's when I decided I would pocket his keys (which I knew were his because I watched him put them on the coffee table when he arrived). Other chaos's happen for a while, and they are juicy but not important to this story, the things that you need to know are that it turns out he took his stepfather's car without asking, intending to have it back in the driveway by 6am., and that a girl who seems to know and care for this boy arrives (drunk but not driving). Since she seems to be a romantic interest of this boy I have only just met, I entrust her with his keys. She joins the party downstairs where she grabs a beer and starts to chat with the others. My partner (and I for that matter) had stopped drinking several hours ago at this point because of the aforementioned chaos's, and he was on 'sentry mode', keeping track of who was coming and going from the house to leave or smoke etc. I finish putting out whatever fire I happened to be occupied with, until that point, and walk over to join him. We chat for a while about how stressful the previous situation was, when both of us at the same time frown. Someone was missing... This girl had very quietly snuck upstairs and woken him up from his blessed unconsciousness. He was perfectly propped up in the corner, airways opened, peacefully contained in the bathroom, after having most of the vomit wiped off his face by yours truly, and the twit wakes him up. When we noticed who wasn't there we went upstairs to check on things, and they were on their way out of the bathroom, her supporting him (unsuccessfully) so my partner grabs him and gets him to the couch. This kid(bb) begins pawing at this girl, who at this point has been told all about the numerous other women in his life, so she is brushing him off of her while helping to get him settled under a blanket. (I had gone into the kitchen to get water) I see from the doorway that my partner looks exasperated and has taken a seat in the living room chair with his arms crossed, and I know he is going to stay to keep on eye on her, so I go downstairs again to monitor the other goings on. The girl and my partner came downstairs, and unfortunately after a while so did Romeo(BB). Since everyone had re-joined the group my partner parks himself on the stairs, blocking the exit. I sit down by his feet and lean on him and just wait for this party to be over. Next thing I know, the for some reason now irate little bean-pole, comes hurdling towards the stairs, demanding to have his keys and to go home. My partner stands up (is larger) and blocks his way. He had already told him there was no way he would allow him to drive himself, and had been offering Ubers, cabs, to wake his own mother to drive him herself, only to be mocked for 'incel-behaviour'  (um hi? I'm his wife?). First he tried to shove my partner, and when he didn’t budge, he took a swing at his face. All the while I am sitting directly under their feet. My partner, now outright angry at being attacked and potentially having me put in harms way, forces this guy backwards and away from me. By the time I get up from the ground my partner has the boy with his face against floor and one arm contained, but I see that his other hand is fisted in my partners beard. I began to walk forward thinking to grab his wrist at least, to try to relieve the strain and my partners face, but by that point the other guests reached them and pulled them both apart. Both breathless and shaking with adrenaline (both the boys and myself), I say to my partner  'go wake up your parents' (as they are the home owners, who would be held liable if anything were to happen), and he goes upstairs to do so, with me trailing behind and waiting for him again in the living room where I seat him when he comes back, and I try to calm us down a little bit. From where we are we can see and hear that a few people including BabyBird, came from the basement and went to the front door to get on shoes, coats, etc. My partner can hear BabyBird still chirping about him, and eventually gets up to go say to him that his intent isn't to keep him here, just to keep him from breaking the law because his parents could lose their home if he were to get into an accident. I am pulling him away while telling him he doesn't have his keys on him so he doesn’t have to worry about physically stopping him, and as we are walking away we hear a muttered 'yeah get back to reddit', and my partner turns to tell this guy exactly where he can go but I block him from doing that, because I know that BabyBird will take any excuse to try to get a hit in this time. As I'm talking my partner down other guests get BB outside where I can hear yelling and honestly the whole party is involved at this point and quite annoyed at BB, but eventually the twit ends up driving him and his step-daddies his car home. (Makes it in time- a half hour to spare. Darn it all.)

Two days later I am still more than just a little upset (honestly its only gotten worse as of 16 days later). I decide to write out a 'letter' addressed to his stepfather containing a heavily summarized version of events, and I posted it on my Facebook profile. I do mention him by name, but we have zero mutuals, in fact he doesn’t even have a Facebook account, but I DO find his Daddy. I make a comment on my post saying so which my mother in law sees (I assume) because my partner gets an angry text from his brother asking 'why the fuck is \*\*\*\*\* posting shit and tagging people's dads, take it down now'. I ask my partner if that is what he would like for me to do, and he says no. Babybird deserves to sweat a bit. He tells his brother that he doesn't control what I do and that I didn’t tag anyone.

As of right now I don't know if BabyBird knows the peril his social life is in, but I do know my brother in law has seen and spoken with BabyBird since then and told his mom (my mother in law) that it doesn’t seem like BB remembers what happened (which I don't believe for a second, the boy is just embarrassed). My question, if any, is should I tell this boys father? I admit I want to do it for petty reasons but on top of that I really do feel a moral obligation to stop him from potentially harming others or himself, but I am not looking to drop a bomb on my brother in law. In retrospect what I should have done is gone outside, took a photo of his license plate and called the police. Honestly pressing charges isn't completely off the table for us either but I need some objective viewpoints. Thank you for reading and for any input <3",1,1737127083.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

We’ve recently seen the Air Canada pilots almost-strike and the Canada Post strike. We may be next and I want to shed some light on the issue. This is by no means a full detailed account of everything we’re fighting for. 

A lot of people think our job is just about serving coffee at 35,000 feet, but there’s so much more to it. We’re safety professionals first and foremost. Before we ever step foot on a plane, we go through weeks of intensive training to handle emergency evacuations, fires, medical emergencies, unruly passengers—you name it. Our job is to ensure your safety from the moment you board until you disembark, yet the pay and working conditions we face don’t reflect the importance of what we do.

Back in 2004, Air Canada was facing bankruptcy, and like everyone else, we took major wage cuts to help save the company. At the time, our starting wage was $24 an hour, but it was slashed to $21 for new hires. Adjusted for inflation, that $24 should be $36.38 today, yet new flight attendants start at around $30 an hour—or just $27,000 annually. This means we haven’t even recovered to our pre-bankruptcy wage levels, despite the airline being profitable for years now. Imagine your wage remaining stagnant for 20+ years.

But it’s worse than it sounds. We’re only paid for our “in-flight” hours—an average of 75 hours per month—while the average person works 150-160 hours monthly. This doesn’t include the hours we spend doing pre-boarding safety checks, helping passengers board, or waiting at airports after flights. CUPE (our union) estimates we work an extra 35 hours per month unpaid. When you add it all up, many flight attendants are effectively earning below minimum wage.

What makes this even more frustrating is that Air Canada is not transparent about its pay structure. When you’re hired, you don’t find out until after training that you won’t be paid for all the hours you work. The airline goes out of its way to hide the fact that you’re only compensated for flight hours, not the hours you’re actually on duty.

To compound the issues further, Air Canada’s paychecks are riddled with errors, and the pay statements are intentionally made so difficult to understand that the average person can’t understand them. You’d need to be an expert on the 293 page contract to catch all the errors. As a result, some experienced flight attendants have become makeshift accountants to help the rest of us review them. Claiming missing expenses is a lengthy process, with arbitrary rules on which expenses are automatically paid and which require manual claims. There is no penalty for the company that makes these errors constantly and has no reason to rectify their process.

There’s also this misconception that we get to travel the world for free. While we technically have standby passes, most flights are oversold these days, and there are rarely empty seats for us to use. The idea that we’re jet-setting around the globe is just not the reality anymore.

Experienced flight attendants are critical to the safety and well-being of passengers. When wages remain low, the turnover rate increases, which can lead to a workforce made up of people who don’t take this as a long-term career but rather a short-term job. This creates a revolving door of staff who lack the deep, accumulated experience that is essential to handle the complex situations we face in the air. Inexperienced flight attendants may not be as equipped to handle emergency situations, deal with difficult passengers, or recognize potential safety hazards.

Moreover, experienced flight attendants are often the ones advocating for passengers’ interests because we are the direct point of contact during the flight. We’re the ones on the ground fighting to protect passengers, whether it’s preventing grooming staff from rushing onto a plane before elderly or disabled passengers are assisted, or intervening to stop the discomfort and embarrassment that often results from this practice. These issues might seem minor, but they directly impact passengers’ travel experience, and it’s flight attendants who are standing up to the airline’s management to make sure passengers are treated with dignity. We’re the ones who have seen shrinkflation and the meals and snacks get smaller for passengers. We’re the ones that feel a sense of embarrassment serving our business class passengers, who pay thousands for a single ticket, when the meal we’re serving looks like it came from Wendy’s rather than a high end restaurant. And we’re the ones who insist the company fix these issues for passengers.

Furthermore, when flight attendants and pilots are not paid for all the hours they work, safety protocols can be compromised. If pilots or flight attendants know they aren’t going to get paid for additional time spent on safety checks or dealing with minor issues, there’s a temptation to overlook those small problems to avoid delaying the flight. This can have disastrous consequences. Flight attendants have a series of mandatory safety checks that are crucial for the safe operation of the flight. When we aren’t compensated for these hours, there is less incentive to take the time needed to identify and resolve potential safety concerns. This is compounded by the airline’s constant pressure to rush through briefings and checks, which undermines our ability to prioritize passenger safety. These challenges not only affect flight attendants but directly affect the safety and comfort of every passenger on board.

Right now, we’re fighting for several things: fair wages that reflect the work we do, pay for all hours worked (not just flight hours), and transparency in how our pay is structured. We’re also supporting Bill C-415, which would ensure that flight attendants across Canada are paid for all mandated duties, including the unpaid work we do on the ground.

We’re not asking for the moon. We’re just asking for fair pay and basic respect for the work we do. If you’ve ever felt safe flying with Air Canada, it’s because a flight attendant was there to make sure you were. We’re proud of what we do, but we deserve to be compensated fairly for it. We’re one of the few employee groups that are required to be Canadian. This is a fight for Canadian wages. If the company could replace us with foreign workers, they probably would.

If this resonates with you, please share or support us however you can. Public awareness is critical in helping us get the fair treatment we’ve been waiting for since 2004. Our contract is up in March 2025. We stood with our pilots shoulder to shoulder when their contract was negotiated earlier this year. They deserved the raise they got and deserve much more. It was good to see the support they got on this sub. Really hoping to see support for flight attendants also. Thanks for reading!

Edit: A commenter on another sub raised some questions and offered some constructive criticism on my post so I will copy and paste my response here just to add some further information and answer questions:

Training was 7 weeks in Vancouver, across the country from my home in Toronto. Many new hires quit their jobs and left families behind, only to find out on the second-to-last day that the $28.85/hour starting wage was smoke and mirrors.

As a fairly junior flight attendant, I can only share what I’ve experienced. Hence I mentioned this is not an exhaustive list. I haven’t spoken about retirement either because I’m not educated on those issues. But point well taken, I will add an edit and mention senior wages. I can see why it would appear as though I was trying to conceal this info. I believe the top pay is $60-62/hour. Senior FAs often do more productive international flights and by my estimate only do about 10-15 hours of free work each month so it would largely be junior FAs that benefit if we start getting paid for all the hours worked.

Travel passes, often seen as a perk, are actually privileges that can be taken away or modified at any time. The company emphasizes they are not part of our benefits. But I did mention passes in paragraph 7 of my post. The company previously fostered infighting by creating hierarchies among employee groups and FAs were at the bottom of this hierarchy. Some of this has been rectified since. With few open seats on flights and low wages, vacations are a luxury—when you’re barely affording rent, hotels and restaurants are out of reach. I’m 3 years in and most FAs at my seniority I speak to have either never used their travel passes or only used them a couple of times. Many senior FAs have to coordinate vacations with their partners and children and cannot risk the uncertainty that comes with standby flying and often end up purchasing full fare tickets.

For reference, I’m at 77% seniority, and my last T4 showed a gross income of $32,000. Just to add context for my entire post.

I didn’t mention healthcare benefits because one would rightly assume we do have those working for a major corporation. The benefits aren’t bad but aren’t extraordinary either. We recently switched benefits providers and from what I’ve seen other FAs say, we are getting a bit less than what we did even a year ago.

I do hope the pilots support us like we did them. But that is yet to be seen. I truly hope most FAs read the contract back to back before signing. But I suspect the company has a few tricks up its sleeve. I predict they will create infighting between junior and senior FAs.

Another thing I failed to mention was ongoing training. We do that annually and we’re only paid 50% of our rate for training. For many juniors that ends up being below minimum wage. I also haven’t delved into crew rest and crew complement. There are so many issues so I honed in on just a few.

When my sister Charlotte married David, I thought she’d found her happily ever after. They were the picture-perfect couple—her radiance matched by his quiet strength. At the wedding, I watched them exchange vows, their smiles bright with hope, and I couldn’t help but feel a pang of envy. Charlotte had always been the lucky one, the golden child, the one who seemed destined for a charmed life.



I didn’t resent her—how could I? She was my sister, my best friend, the person who knew me better than anyone. I cheered her on, celebrated her victories, and stood by her side on the most important day of her life. But deep down, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d always be standing in her shadow.



I didn’t see David often after the wedding. Charlotte and I kept in touch through texts and calls, but her new life with David seemed to take precedence, as it should have. I was busy with my own life—a steady but unremarkable job, a string of short-lived relationships, and a small apartment that felt like both a sanctuary and a prison.



It wasn’t until Charlotte’s birthday a year later that I saw David again. She threw a small party at their home, inviting a mix of friends and family. I arrived late, juggling a bottle of wine and a bouquet of flowers, and found David in the kitchen, cutting limes for the drinks.



“Hey, you,” he said, smiling as I walked in. “Long time no see.”



“Yeah, well, someone’s been keeping you all to herself,” I teased, setting the wine on the counter.



David chuckled, his green eyes crinkling at the corners. “You know how she is. Always a million things on her plate.”



I nodded, smiling back. He was as charming as I remembered, with an easy warmth that made people feel instantly at ease. We chatted for a while, catching up on small talk, and I found myself relaxing in his company. It was harmless, I told myself. Just two people making conversation.



But as the evening went on, I couldn’t ignore the way David’s attention lingered on me. It wasn’t overt—just small things, like the way he laughed a little too hard at my jokes, or how his eyes seemed to follow me when he thought I wasn’t looking. I dismissed it as my imagination, a silly projection of my own insecurities. David loved Charlotte. That was all there was to it.



A few weeks later, Charlotte called to ask if I could house-sit while they went on vacation. I agreed without hesitation, happy for the chance to escape my cramped apartment and spend some time in their beautiful suburban home. The house was a dream—spacious and filled with light, with a cozy reading nook I instantly claimed as my own.



I was halfway through my first night there when I heard the doorbell. Confused, I checked the time—it was nearly 10 p.m. When I opened the door, David stood there, a sheepish smile on his face.



“Sorry to drop by unannounced,” he said. “I forgot some documents I need for work.”



I stepped aside to let him in, feeling a little flustered. “No problem. I’ll help you look.”



We searched the house together, chatting as we went. It felt easy, natural, like the camaraderie we’d shared at the party. But as the minutes stretched into an hour, I started to feel a strange tension in the air. David seemed distracted, his eyes darting to me every so often, his words slower, more deliberate.



Finally, we found the documents in the study. I handed them to him, relieved to have an excuse to end the evening. But as I walked him to the door, he hesitated, turning to face me.



“Emily,” he said softly, his voice laced with hesitation. “There’s something I need to tell you.”



My heart skipped a beat. “What is it?”



He looked at me, his expression torn. “I don’t know how to say this without it sounding... wrong. But I can’t keep it to myself anymore.”



“David, you’re scaring me,” I said, trying to laugh it off.



“I’m in love with you,” he said, the words tumbling out in a rush. “I know it’s wrong. I know I shouldn’t feel this way. But I can’t help it.”



I stared at him, stunned. “David, you’re married to my sister. What are you talking about?”



He ran a hand through his hair, his frustration evident. “I’ve tried to ignore it, to push it away, but it’s been there since the day we met. You’re everything I—”



“Stop,” I interrupted, my voice shaking. “You can’t say these things. This isn’t fair to me or Charlotte.”



“I know,” he said, his voice breaking. “But I needed you to know the truth.”



That night, I couldn’t sleep. David’s confession replayed in my mind, a whirlwind of confusion and guilt. I didn’t want to believe it, didn’t want to accept that the man my sister loved could betray her like this. But as I lay awake in their guest room, I realized there was another layer to my unease—something I didn’t want to admit, even to myself.



Deep down, I felt a spark when David looked at me. A part of me had always wondered what it would be like to be seen, to be chosen. And now that it had happened, I hated myself for it.



I resolved to tell Charlotte as soon as she returned. She deserved to know the truth, no matter how much it hurt. But the next day, as I was cleaning out the attic, I found something that made me question everything—a box of old letters, written in a familiar hand. Letters that revealed a secret my family had buried for decades.



The box was dusty, its edges worn, as if it hadn’t been touched in years. My curiosity got the better of me, and I sat cross-legged on the attic floor, carefully opening the lid. Inside were dozens of letters, tied together with a faded ribbon. The handwriting on the envelopes was unmistakable—my mother’s.



My breath caught as I untied the ribbon and pulled out the first letter. It was addressed to a man I didn’t recognize: “To James—Forever Yours, Eleanor.” My mother’s name, Eleanor, stared back at me, confirming what I already knew but couldn’t comprehend.



The contents of the letter unraveled the perfect image I had of my family. My mother wrote of a love so intense, so consuming, that she felt she couldn’t live without this man, James. But there was more—mentions of secrets, of promises that couldn’t be broken, and of a betrayal that had shattered her.



I sifted through the letters, my hands trembling as I pieced together the truth. My mother had been in love with someone before my father, a man she described as her “soulmate.” But for reasons that weren’t clear, she had married my father instead. One letter hinted at a choice she had been forced to make, for the sake of appearances, for the sake of her family.



One letter, dated nine months before Charlotte was born, made my stomach drop: “James, I’m scared. I don’t know what to do. The timing… the child… It’s yours.”



The words blurred as my vision swam. Charlotte. My perfect, golden sister. Could it be possible that she wasn’t my father’s child?



I spent the next few hours in a daze, reading letter after letter, each one deepening the pit in my stomach. My mother’s love for James, her guilt over her choice, and her attempts to make peace with her life painted a picture I wasn’t ready to face.



But what did this mean for me? For Charlotte? Could she know the truth?



By the time I returned to the main house, the sun had set, casting long shadows across the walls. I locked the box away in the study, unable to bear the weight of it any longer.



And that’s when I saw him—David. He was sitting on the living room couch, his head in his hands. When he looked up, his eyes were filled with something I couldn’t quite name.



“Emily,” he said softly. “We need to talk.”



I stayed where I was, my body tense. “There’s nothing to talk about, David. What you said last night was a mistake, and it can’t happen again.”



He stood, taking a hesitant step toward me. “I know. But there’s something else. Something I think you need to know.”



I crossed my arms, my voice sharp. “What could you possibly say that would make this any better?”



David hesitated, then sighed. “I didn’t want to say anything, but Charlotte… she’s been distant lately. I’ve felt it for months. At first, I thought it was work, or stress, but now I think it’s something more.”



A chill ran down my spine. “What are you saying?”



He ran a hand through his hair, his frustration evident. “I think she’s hiding something from me. Something big. And I think it has to do with your family.”



The words hit me like a freight train. Did Charlotte know the truth? Had she discovered the letters, the secret of her parentage? My mind raced with possibilities, each one more damning than the last.



“David,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “If you care about her, you need to give her the benefit of the doubt. Whatever she’s dealing with, it’s not your place to assume the worst.”



“And what about us?” he asked, his voice breaking. “You can’t deny there’s something here, Emily. I know you feel it too.”



I shook my head, tears pricking my eyes. “It doesn’t matter what I feel. This isn’t right. It never will be.”



Before he could respond, I turned and walked away, leaving him standing in the dimly lit room.



The next morning, I called Charlotte, hoping to sound casual. “Hey, how’s the trip?”



“It’s great,” she said, her voice bright. “David hasn’t been too annoying, has he?”



“No, he’s fine,” I said quickly, trying to keep my voice steady. “Listen, I found something in the attic—some old letters Mom wrote. I think they might be important.”



Charlotte’s laughter faltered. “What kind of letters?”



I hesitated. “Love letters. From before she married Dad.”



There was a long pause. When Charlotte spoke again, her voice was tight. “I’ll look at them when we get back.”



The call ended, and I was left with more questions than answers. Did Charlotte already know? And if she did, why hadn’t she said anything?



I spent the rest of the day pacing the house, my thoughts racing. When David showed up unannounced that evening, I wasn’t surprised.



“Emily,” he said, his tone urgent. “We need to figure this out. Whatever’s going on, it’s bigger than both of us.”



I sighed, too tired to argue. “I don’t know what’s happening, David. But I know one thing—we can’t let this destroy Charlotte.”



His jaw tightened, and for the first time, I saw the depth of his feelings. “I don’t want to hurt her. I never did. But if she’s hiding something, we need to know.”



His words echoed my own fears. I nodded reluctantly, knowing that the answers we sought could shatter everything.



Charlotte and David returned from their trip a few days later, and the tension in the house was palpable from the moment they walked in. Charlotte greeted me with a bright smile, but it didn’t reach her eyes. David kept his distance, his glances at me quick and cautious.



I waited until the next morning to confront Charlotte. I found her in the kitchen, sipping coffee and scrolling through her phone.



“Can we talk?” I asked, my voice steadier than I felt.



She looked up, startled. “Sure. What’s up?”



I sat across from her, my hands clasped tightly in my lap. “It’s about the letters I found in the attic.”



Her face froze for a split second before she set her coffee down. “What about them?”



“They’re from someone named James,” I said carefully. “Someone Mom loved before she married Dad.”



Charlotte’s expression didn’t change, but her hands tightened around the mug. “That was a long time ago, Emily. Why does it matter now?”



“Because one of the letters says…” I hesitated, unsure how to phrase it. “It says the child she was carrying wasn’t Dad’s. It says it was James’s.”



For a moment, the kitchen was silent except for the hum of the refrigerator. Charlotte stared at me, her eyes wide with shock—or was it something else?



“Are you saying…?” Her voice faltered.



“I don’t know what I’m saying,” I admitted. “But if there’s a chance that you’re—”



“Stop,” she said sharply, cutting me off. “Don’t finish that sentence.”



I blinked, taken aback. “Charlotte, I just think we need to—”



“Drop it, Emily,” she snapped, standing abruptly. “Those letters don’t change anything. Mom and Dad were our parents, and that’s all that matters.”



She stormed out of the kitchen, leaving me reeling. Her reaction had been defensive, almost panicked. Did she already know? And if she did, why was she so desperate to keep it buried?



Over the next few days, the atmosphere in the house grew increasingly strained. Charlotte avoided me whenever she could, and when we were in the same room, her conversations were clipped and guarded. David, on the other hand, seemed to hover around me more than usual, his concern palpable.



One evening, as Charlotte was out running errands, David cornered me in the study.



“You told her about the letters, didn’t you?” he asked, his voice low.



I nodded, my guilt weighing heavily on me. “She didn’t take it well.”



David sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. “I figured. Charlotte’s always been good at pretending everything’s fine, even when it’s not.”



“Do you think she knew?” I asked.



David hesitated, then nodded. “I think she’s known for a while. She’s been acting strange for months, like there’s something she’s afraid to face.”



I frowned. “If she knew, why wouldn’t she say anything? Why wouldn’t she tell me?”



“Maybe she didn’t want to hurt you,” David said softly. “Or maybe she didn’t want to hurt herself.”



The weight of his words settled heavily between us. I wanted to believe that Charlotte’s silence was an act of self-preservation, but a small part of me couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more to the story.



The breakthrough came a week later, completely by accident. I was in the garage, searching for a toolbox, when I found another box tucked behind a stack of old paint cans. This one was smaller, less conspicuous, but its contents were just as damning.



Inside was a birth certificate—Charlotte’s. But the father’s name wasn’t our dad’s. It was James.



I stared at the document, my hands trembling. This was it—the confirmation I didn’t want but couldn’t ignore. Charlotte wasn’t just hiding the truth; she had been living it her entire life.



I confronted her that evening, unable to keep the secret any longer. She was in the living room, flipping through a magazine, when I dropped the birth certificate on the coffee table in front of her.



“What is this?” I demanded, my voice shaking.



Charlotte looked at the document, her face pale. She didn’t speak for a long moment, then finally sighed. “It’s exactly what it looks like.”



“You knew?” I asked, my chest tightening. “You knew all this time, and you didn’t tell me?”



Her eyes filled with tears. “I found out a few years ago, after Mom died. I was going through her things and found the same letters you did.”



“Why didn’t you say anything?” I demanded.



“Because it didn’t matter,” she said, her voice breaking. “Dad raised me, Emily. He loved me like I was his own. What difference does it make whose blood runs in my veins?”



“It makes a difference to me,” I said, my voice softening. “I’m your sister, Charlotte. I deserved to know.”



She looked away, her tears spilling over. “I was scared. Scared that you’d see me differently, that you’d think I didn’t belong.”



I sat beside her, placing a hand on her shoulder. “You do belong. You’re my sister, no matter what. But we can’t keep running from the truth.”



Charlotte nodded, her body shaking with silent sobs. For the first time in days, I felt a glimmer of hope—that we could face this together, that our bond as sisters could survive even this.



But as I sat there, comforting her, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this was only the beginning. The truth had been uncovered, but the consequences were yet to come.



The days following our confrontation were heavy with unspoken tension. Charlotte tried to go about her life as if nothing had changed, but I could see the strain in her every movement. For my part, I couldn’t stop thinking about the implications of what we’d uncovered. The truth was out now, but it didn’t feel like relief—it felt like a storm waiting to break.



David’s behavior only added to the pressure. He seemed to be watching both of us, his usual charm replaced by a quiet intensity that unsettled me. I avoided him as much as I could, unsure of how to navigate the fragile balance we’d struck. But, as always, avoiding him only worked for so long.



One evening, while Charlotte was out for a meeting, I found David in the study, staring at the box of letters I had brought down from the attic. He looked up when I entered, his expression unreadable.



“You found this, didn’t you?” he asked, his voice low.



I nodded. “Yes. And Charlotte knows, too.”



David leaned back in his chair, exhaling slowly. “So, it’s true. She’s not—”



“She’s not my dad’s biological daughter,” I finished for him. “But that doesn’t make her any less a part of this family.”



He nodded, his gaze distant. “She must have been carrying this weight for so long. And now, with everything else…” He trailed off, his words hanging in the air like an unfinished thought.



“What do you mean, everything else?” I asked, my curiosity piqued.



David hesitated, his jaw tightening. “Charlotte’s been pulling away from me for months. I thought it was stress or something at work, but now I think it’s more than that. I think she’s hiding something—something she doesn’t want either of us to know.”



My heart sank. “David, if she’s keeping secrets, it’s not our place to—”



He cut me off, his tone sharp. “Emily, I love her. But I can’t shake the feeling that there’s something bigger going on here. And if it affects her, it affects me. It affects us.”



“Us?” I repeated, my voice barely above a whisper. “There is no us, David.”



His eyes met mine, filled with a mixture of frustration and longing. “You know that’s not true.”



I shook my head, backing away. “Stop. Whatever you think this is, it’s wrong. We can’t do this. I won’t let you ruin what’s left of this family.”



David stood, closing the distance between us. “Emily, I—”



The sound of the front door opening cut him off. Charlotte’s voice called out from the entryway, breaking the moment like shattered glass. I stepped back, my heart racing, as David turned away, his expression unreadable.



That night, I barely slept. David’s words replayed in my mind, tangled with my own guilt and confusion. I hated the way he made me feel—drawn to him, despite everything I knew was at stake. But more than that, I hated the secrets that were tearing our family apart.



The next morning, I resolved to confront Charlotte again. Whatever she was hiding, we needed to face it together. I found her in the garden, tending to the flowers she loved so much.



“Charlotte,” I said, my voice steady. “We need to talk.”



She glanced up at me, her brow furrowed. “About what?”



“About whatever it is you’re not telling me,” I said. “David thinks you’ve been pulling away. He thinks you’re hiding something. And after everything we’ve uncovered, I think he might be right.”



Her face paled, and for a moment, I thought she might deny it. But then she sighed, setting down her gardening tools.



“You’re right,” she said softly. “There is something I haven’t told you. But it’s not what you think.”



I waited, my heart pounding, as she took a deep breath and continued.



“I found the letters years ago,” she said. “And I’ve spent every day since trying to figure out what they mean. I’ve always felt different, like I didn’t quite fit. And when I found out the truth about James, it all started to make sense. But…” She hesitated, her voice breaking. “There’s more.”



“What do you mean?” I asked, my stomach twisting.



“I found something else,” she said. “In Mom’s things. A diary.”



The words sent a chill down my spine. “A diary?”



Charlotte nodded, her eyes filling with tears. “It wasn’t just James. There was someone else—someone Mom trusted to keep her secrets. And I think… I think they’re still alive.”



The revelation hit me like a thunderclap. Someone else knew the truth about our mother’s past—someone who might hold the missing pieces to the puzzle we’d been trying to solve. But who were they? And why had Mom trusted them above everyone else?



“Do you know who it is?” I asked, my voice shaking.



Charlotte hesitated, then nodded. “Yes. But if I tell you, it changes everything.”



“Charlotte, everything’s already changed,” I said. “We need to know the truth.”



She sighed, her shoulders sagging under the weight of her confession. “It’s our uncle. Mom’s brother. He was the only one who knew about James, about the affair, about everything. I think he’s the key to understanding why she made the choices she did.”



I stared at her, stunned. Our uncle had always been a distant figure in our lives, a man who appeared at holidays and family gatherings but never stayed long. Could he really be the one holding the answers we’d been searching for?



“We have to talk to him,” I said, my resolve hardening. “We have to know the whole story.”



Charlotte nodded, her expression grim. “Then we’ll do it together.”



The drive to our uncle’s house was silent, the weight of what we were about to uncover pressing down on both of us. Charlotte gripped the steering wheel tightly, her knuckles white, while I stared out the window, lost in thought. Our uncle had always been a quiet man, someone who kept to himself and never seemed fully part of the family. But if he truly knew the secrets of our mother’s past, we needed answers.



When we arrived, he greeted us with mild surprise. Uncle Robert lived in a modest home on the edge of town, far removed from the life of privilege and pretense we’d grown up in. He invited us inside, offering us tea, but neither of us had the patience for pleasantries.



“Uncle Robert,” Charlotte began, her voice steady but firm. “We need to talk about Mom. About James. About the letters.”



His face darkened, and he set down his cup with a sigh. “I was wondering when you’d come to me about this,” he said. “I suppose it was only a matter of time.”



“So, it’s true?” I asked, leaning forward. “Mom was in love with James before she married Dad?”



Robert nodded, his expression solemn. “Yes. They were inseparable, the kind of love you don’t see often. But it wasn’t meant to last.”



“What happened?” Charlotte asked, her voice cracking.



He hesitated, then began to explain. “Our father—your grandfather—was a proud man, obsessed with appearances. When he found out about James, he forced your mother to end it. James didn’t come from the right family, didn’t have the connections your grandfather valued. He arranged for her to marry your father instead, a man he saw as respectable and secure.”



“And she went along with it?” I asked, anger bubbling in my chest.



Robert sighed. “She didn’t have a choice. Our father was… controlling. But she never stopped loving James. Even after she married your father, she carried that love with her.”



“What about Charlotte?” I asked, my voice trembling. “Did Dad know she wasn’t his?”



Robert’s expression softened. “Your father suspected, but he chose not to ask questions. He loved Charlotte as if she were his own, and your mother was grateful for that. She always said he was a better man than she deserved.”



Charlotte looked away, her shoulders shaking. I reached for her hand, squeezing it gently. “You’re not to blame for any of this,” I said. “None of it is your fault.”



“But it feels like it is,” she whispered. “Like my whole life has been a lie.”



Robert shook his head. “It wasn’t a lie, Charlotte. Your mother loved you deeply. She did what she thought was best, even if it wasn’t perfect.”



As we left his house, the weight of the truth settled over us. The answers we’d found didn’t erase the pain or the questions that lingered, but they gave us a sense of clarity—a foundation to rebuild on. Charlotte and I had always been close, but this experience had bonded us in a way I couldn’t have imagined. We weren’t just sisters anymore; we were survivors of the same broken legacy.



When we returned home, David was waiting for us. He looked between the two of us, his expression full of concern. “Did you find what you were looking for?” he asked.



Charlotte nodded. “We did. And now we have to figure out how to move forward.”



David’s gaze lingered on me, and for a moment, I saw the unspoken questions in his eyes. I turned away, unable to face him. Whatever feelings had passed between us, they couldn’t exist in the light of everything we’d uncovered. Charlotte deserved better than that—better than us.



Over the next few weeks, Charlotte and I began to piece our lives back together. We talked late into the night, shared memories of our parents, and found ways to laugh again. The pain didn’t disappear, but it became something we could bear together.



As for David, he eventually pulled away, leaving the house for longer and longer stretches of time. I didn’t ask where he went or what he was thinking; I didn’t want to know. Charlotte, to her credit, didn’t press him, either. Their relationship had been strained for months, and now it seemed to hang by a thread.



One evening, as I was packing my things to move back to my own apartment, David found me in the study. “Emily,” he said, his voice soft. “I just wanted to say goodbye.”



I looked at him, my heart heavy. “Goodbye?”



He nodded. “I think it’s best if I go away for a while. Give Charlotte the space she needs to figure out what she wants. And maybe figure out what I want, too.”



I nodded, unsure of what to say. “Take care of yourself, David.”



He hesitated, then stepped closer. “I meant what I said before. You deserve to be happy, Emily. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.”



I didn’t respond, and after a moment, he left. The sound of the front door closing behind him felt like the end of a chapter I wasn’t ready to finish.



Months later, Charlotte and I stood together at the edge of a cliff overlooking the ocean. It was a place our mother had loved, a place she’d taken us as children. We scattered her ashes into the wind, letting them drift into the waves below.



As the sun set, casting the sky in shades of gold and pink, I turned to Charlotte. “We’re going to be okay,” I said, my voice steady.



She smiled, her eyes bright with unshed tears. “I know.”



We walked back to the car together, the wind at our backs and the weight of the past finally beginning to lift. Our family’s secrets had shaped us, but they didn’t define us. Together, we would find a way to move forward—stronger, wiser, and closer than ever.",3,1737126850.0,stories,0,1.0,False

When I married Ethan, I thought I had found my perfect match. He was charming, ambitious, and endlessly supportive of my dreams. Together, we built a life that looked flawless from the outside: a beautiful home, successful careers, and a partnership that seemed unshakable. But Ethan’s world was bigger than I realized, and it wasn’t long before cracks in our picture-perfect life began to show.



Ethan was a partner in a high-stakes investment firm, a world of tailored suits, black-tie galas, and multimillion-dollar deals. His long hours at the office became a source of tension between us, but I tried to be understanding. He assured me it was all for us, that every late night and missed dinner was building a better future. I believed him, until the night I met his business partner, Adrian.



Adrian was everything Ethan wasn’t. Where Ethan was polished and careful, Adrian was rough around the edges, with sharp green eyes that seemed to see right through me. He was confident, almost to the point of arrogance, and yet there was a warmth beneath his bravado that I couldn’t ignore. Ethan introduced us at a charity event, the three of us standing under the glow of crystal chandeliers, champagne flutes in hand.



“This is my wife, Emily,” Ethan said, his arm around my waist. “Emily, meet Adrian. He’s been keeping me sane at work.”



Adrian’s gaze lingered on me a moment too long before he extended his hand. “Pleasure to meet you,” he said, his voice smooth and unhurried. When our hands touched, I felt a spark I couldn’t explain. It startled me, and I quickly pulled my hand back, hoping Ethan hadn’t noticed.



As the weeks passed, Adrian became a more frequent presence in our lives. He joined us for dinners, accompanied Ethan to social events, and even dropped by the house unannounced to discuss business. At first, I thought nothing of it—after all, he was Ethan’s closest confidant at work. But I couldn’t ignore the way Adrian looked at me when Ethan wasn’t paying attention, or the way my pulse quickened whenever he was near.



One evening, after Ethan left the room to take a phone call, Adrian and I were alone in the living room. The silence between us was heavy, charged with an energy I couldn’t deny.



“You seem… restless,” Adrian said, his tone teasing but gentle.



I laughed nervously. “Restless? No, just tired, I guess.”



He leaned back in his chair, studying me with a small, knowing smile. “Tired of waiting for him to notice?”



His words struck a nerve, and I looked away, my cheeks burning. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”



“Don’t you?” he said softly, his voice low and almost conspiratorial. “I see the way you look at him. And the way you don’t.”



Before I could respond, Ethan returned, oblivious to the tension that had filled the room. Adrian excused himself shortly after, leaving me shaken and confused. I couldn’t deny the truth in his words. Lately, Ethan felt more like a stranger than a husband. But admitting that to myself was dangerous, especially when Adrian was involved.



Over the next few months, my interactions with Adrian became more frequent—and more complicated. He had a way of making me feel seen in a way Ethan no longer did. It wasn’t just his attention or his charm; it was the way he seemed to understand me, to sense my doubts and fears without me having to say a word.



Then, one night, everything changed.



Ethan was out of town for a business trip, and I was home alone, nursing a glass of wine and trying to ignore the loneliness that had settled over me. A knock at the door startled me, and when I opened it, Adrian stood there, his expression serious.



“I need to talk to you,” he said, stepping inside before I could protest.



“What’s going on?” I asked, setting my wineglass down. “Where’s Ethan?”



Adrian hesitated, running a hand through his dark hair. “There’s something you need to know about your husband.”



Adrian’s words hung in the air, heavy with unspoken tension. My heart raced as I tried to process what he could possibly mean. Ethan wasn’t perfect, but he was my husband—the man I thought I knew better than anyone. And yet, the look on Adrian’s face told me that everything was about to change.



“Stop being cryptic and tell me what’s going on,” I demanded, crossing my arms to mask my growing unease.



Adrian sighed and gestured toward the couch. “You might want to sit down.”



I didn’t move. “Just say it.”



He hesitated, as if weighing whether to tell me the full truth. Finally, he spoke. “Ethan’s not the man you think he is. He’s been involved in some… questionable business practices. Money laundering, offshore accounts, deals with people who don’t play by the rules.”



I blinked, stunned. “What? No, that’s impossible. Ethan works hard, but he’s not a criminal.”



Adrian’s jaw tightened. “I thought so too, at first. But I’ve seen the files, Emily. I’ve heard the conversations. He’s in deep, and if he gets caught, it’s not just his career on the line—it’s yours too.”



My legs felt weak, and I sank onto the couch despite myself. “Why are you telling me this? Why now?”



Adrian sat across from me, leaning forward with an intensity that made it hard to look away. “Because you deserve to know. You’re being dragged into a mess you didn’t create. And because…” He hesitated, then softened. “Because I care about you.”



His words sent a jolt through me. I stared at him, unsure how to respond. Before I could say anything, he reached into his jacket and pulled out a USB drive, placing it on the coffee table between us.



“This has everything,” he said. “Proof of what Ethan’s been doing. You need to decide what you’re going to do with it.”



I picked up the drive, my hand trembling. “Why are you giving me this? Why not take it to the authorities yourself?”



Adrian’s eyes darkened. “Because if I do, Ethan will know it was me. And he’ll destroy me before I get the chance.”



The weight of his words sank in. Ethan wasn’t just involved in shady deals—he was dangerous. The man I had married, the man I thought I could trust, had been hiding a side of himself I couldn’t reconcile with the person I knew.



Adrian stood, breaking the silence. “Think carefully, Emily. If you stay silent, you’re complicit. If you speak up, you’re putting yourself at risk. Either way, the life you’ve known is over.”



Before I could respond, he left, leaving me alone with the USB drive and a swirling storm of emotions. I stared at the small piece of plastic in my hand, knowing it held answers I wasn’t sure I wanted to find.



Over the next few days, I avoided Ethan’s calls. I told myself I needed time to think, but the truth was, I didn’t know how to face him. Every time I looked at the USB drive, I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. Finally, late one night, I plugged it into my laptop and opened the files.



What I saw made my blood run cold. Bank statements, emails, spreadsheets—it was all there. Ethan had funneled millions into offshore accounts, using shell companies to cover his tracks. There were payments to people whose names I didn’t recognize but whose reputations, after a quick search, sent chills down my spine. These weren’t just shady business associates—they were criminals.



One folder caught my eye, labeled “Emily.” My hands shook as I clicked on it. Inside were files detailing every aspect of my life—photos, copies of my emails, even my medical records. It was as if Ethan had been keeping tabs on me, cataloging my every move. My chest tightened, and tears blurred my vision. This wasn’t love. This was control.



When Ethan came home from his trip, I confronted him. I stood in the living room, the USB drive clutched in my hand, as he walked through the door.



“We need to talk,” I said, my voice trembling.



He looked at me, his expression unreadable. “About what?”



I held up the USB drive. “About this.”



His face darkened, and for a moment, I saw a flash of something I couldn’t place—fear, anger, maybe both. “Where did you get that?” he demanded.



“It doesn’t matter,” I said, my voice steadier now. “What matters is that I know everything.”



Ethan’s jaw clenched, and he took a step closer. “Emily, you don’t understand. It’s not what it looks like.”



“Then what is it?” I shot back. “Because it looks like you’ve been lying to me for years. It looks like you’ve dragged me into a world I want no part of.”



He reached for me, but I stepped back. “Emily, listen to me. I did this for us. For our future.”



“No,” I said, shaking my head. “You did this for yourself. And now I have to decide what to do.”



Ethan’s eyes narrowed. “You don’t want to do anything rash. If you go to the authorities, you’re putting yourself in danger. These people don’t play games.”



“I can’t live like this,” I said, my voice breaking. “I can’t stay with someone who’s lied to me, manipulated me, and put me at risk.”



For a moment, Ethan looked as if he might argue, but then he sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “I never wanted this to happen. I thought I could protect you.”



“You failed,” I said simply.



That night, I packed a bag and left. I didn’t know where I was going or what would happen next, but I knew one thing for certain: I couldn’t stay.



I drove aimlessly for hours that night, the weight of everything pressing down on me. Ethan’s betrayal was more than just a crack in our marriage—it was a chasm that could never be bridged. The man I thought I loved had built our life on lies, and now I was left to pick up the pieces. By the time the sun began to rise, I found myself in a small motel on the outskirts of the city, staring at the USB drive as if it were a ticking time bomb.



Adrian’s words echoed in my mind. “If you stay silent, you’re complicit. If you speak up, you’re putting yourself at risk.” Either choice felt like stepping into quicksand. But the longer I sat there, the clearer it became that silence wasn’t an option. Ethan had to be stopped, and I couldn’t do it alone.



I reached for my phone and dialed the number Adrian had scribbled on the back of a napkin before he left my house. He answered on the second ring.



“Emily,” he said, his voice cautious. “Are you all right?”



“No,” I replied honestly. “But I know what I have to do.”



Adrian met me at a diner just outside the city. He looked tired, as if the weight of his own choices was catching up to him. I slid the USB drive across the table, and he nodded grimly.



“This is everything?” he asked.



I nodded. “Everything I could find.”



He studied me for a moment. “You know what happens next, right? Once this gets out, Ethan will know it came from you. He won’t take it lying down.”



I swallowed hard. “I don’t care. He’s made his choices, and now I’m making mine.”



Adrian reached across the table, his hand brushing mine. “You’re braver than you think, Emily.”



His touch sent a jolt through me, but I pulled my hand back, unsure of what I was feeling. This wasn’t the time to dwell on emotions. There was too much at stake.



The next few days were a blur. Adrian passed the evidence to a trusted journalist, someone who had spent years uncovering corruption and wouldn’t be intimidated by Ethan’s power. The first article dropped within 48 hours, and it hit like a thunderclap. Headlines splashed across news sites, detailing the web of lies, fraud, and illegal dealings that Ethan and his firm had woven.



Ethan called me dozens of times, but I didn’t answer. I couldn’t face him—not yet. Each voicemail was angrier than the last, his carefully constructed facade crumbling with every desperate word. He knew it was me. He had to.



But it wasn’t just Ethan’s wrath I had to worry about. His associates—shadowy figures mentioned only in whispers—wouldn’t take kindly to their secrets being exposed. Adrian insisted on staying close, a silent protector in the background, but even his presence couldn’t ease the knot of fear that had settled in my chest.



Late one night, as I sat in the dark motel room, my phone buzzed. It was Adrian.



“Emily,” he said, his voice tense. “You need to leave. Now.”



“What?” I asked, my heart racing. “What’s going on?”



“There’s been movement—people asking questions, looking for you. They know where you are.”



I didn’t hesitate. Grabbing my bag, I bolted out the door and into my car, my pulse pounding in my ears. Adrian was waiting for me at a gas station a few miles away. When I arrived, he pulled me into his car without a word and drove into the night.



We ended up in a remote cabin Adrian had borrowed from a friend. It was quiet, surrounded by trees and far from prying eyes. As we settled in, the adrenaline began to wear off, leaving me feeling raw and exposed.



Adrian lit a fire in the small stone hearth, the flickering flames casting shadows across his face. “This isn’t permanent,” he said, sitting across from me. “It’s just until things settle down.”



I nodded, unable to find the words to thank him. He had risked everything to help me—his career, his safety, even his relationship with Ethan. I didn’t know what I’d done to deserve his loyalty, but I was grateful for it.



“Why are you doing this?” I asked softly. “Why are you helping me?”



Adrian hesitated, his gaze fixed on the fire. “Because you deserve better,” he said finally. “And because I couldn’t stand by and watch Ethan destroy you.”



His words sent a warmth through me that I hadn’t felt in months. I looked at him, really looked at him, and saw a man who had been shaped by his own battles, his own scars. He wasn’t perfect, but he was honest, and that was more than I could say for Ethan.



“Thank you,” I whispered, the words feeling inadequate but heartfelt.



Adrian’s eyes met mine, and for a moment, the air between us shifted. There was a connection there, fragile but undeniable. I didn’t know what it meant, or if I was ready to explore it, but for the first time in a long time, I felt like I wasn’t alone.



The days at the cabin passed in a strange mix of fear and quiet. Adrian and I stayed hidden, our routines dictated by caution. He spent hours on the phone with the journalist and legal contacts, ensuring the evidence against Ethan couldn’t be buried. I tried to stay busy, helping where I could, but the isolation gave me too much time to think.



Ethan’s betrayal still cut deep. It wasn’t just the lies about his business—it was the realization that our entire relationship had been a facade. I couldn’t help but wonder if he’d ever truly loved me, or if I’d been just another asset in his carefully curated life.



Adrian seemed to sense when the weight of it all became too much. He was always there with a quiet reassurance—a cup of coffee, a distraction, or a story about his own life. He told me about his struggles growing up, about the losses that had shaped him, and about the mistakes he’d made. His honesty was disarming, and I found myself opening up in ways I hadn’t expected.



One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, I sat on the cabin’s porch, staring out at the dense forest. Adrian joined me, a glass of whiskey in his hand.



“You’re awfully quiet tonight,” he said, sitting beside me.



I shrugged. “Just thinking. It’s hard to believe this is my life now.”



“It won’t always be like this,” he said. “Once Ethan’s dealt with, you can start over.”



I looked at him, searching his face. “What about you? What happens to you after all this?”



Adrian leaned back, his gaze distant. “I haven’t figured that out yet. But I know one thing—I’m done with the lies and the games. I want something real.”



His words hit me harder than I expected. I thought about everything he’d done for me, how he’d put himself at risk to protect me. I realized that somewhere along the way, my feelings for him had shifted. He wasn’t just Ethan’s business partner anymore—he was someone I trusted, someone I cared about.



Before I could stop myself, I said, “You deserve something real too.”



Adrian’s eyes met mine, and for a moment, the world seemed to fall away. He reached out, brushing a strand of hair from my face. “Emily…” he began, his voice soft.



But before he could say more, his phone buzzed, shattering the moment. He sighed and checked the screen. “It’s the journalist. I need to take this.”



I nodded, watching as he disappeared back inside the cabin. My heart was pounding, my thoughts a tangled mess. I didn’t know what I wanted, but I knew things between us had changed.



The next morning, Adrian told me the journalist’s article had sparked a chain reaction. Authorities were investigating Ethan’s firm, and several of his associates had already been arrested. Ethan himself had gone underground, avoiding the fallout. The news brought a mix of relief and dread. The walls were closing in on him, but that also made him more dangerous.



Our fears were confirmed later that day. Adrian’s phone buzzed with a message, and his expression darkened as he read it.



“What is it?” I asked, my chest tightening.



“He’s looking for you,” Adrian said grimly. “He knows you’re the one who leaked the files.”



My stomach dropped. “What do we do?”



“We stay here for now,” Adrian said. “I’ll make some calls, see if we can get you into protective custody.”



The thought of running again made me feel sick, but I knew Adrian was right. Ethan wouldn’t stop until he’d found me. And when he did, I had no doubt he would make me pay for what I’d done.



That night, as I lay awake, the weight of everything bore down on me. I felt like I was drowning, the walls of the cabin closing in. I got up and went to the porch, hoping the cool night air would clear my head. To my surprise, Adrian was already there, staring out at the stars.



“Can’t sleep?” he asked without looking at me.



I shook my head. “Too much on my mind.”



He gestured to the empty chair beside him, and I sat down. For a while, we didn’t speak, the silence between us comfortable and heavy at the same time.



“Do you regret it?” Adrian asked suddenly. “Turning him in?”



I thought about it for a moment. “No,” I said finally. “I regret that it came to this, but I don’t regret doing the right thing.”



Adrian nodded, his gaze still fixed on the stars. “You’re stronger than you think, Emily.”



I looked at him, my heart aching with gratitude and something deeper I wasn’t ready to name. “I couldn’t have done this without you.”



He turned to me then, his green eyes searching mine. “You’re not alone in this. Not now, not ever.”



Before I could stop myself, I leaned forward and kissed him. For a moment, he froze, but then he kissed me back, his hands gently cradling my face. It was soft, tentative, and filled with unspoken promises. When we pulled away, he rested his forehead against mine.



“Emily,” he whispered, his voice thick with emotion. “I—”



The sound of a car engine in the distance cut him off. We both stiffened, our instincts on high alert. Adrian stood, his hand brushing mine as he moved toward the edge of the porch, scanning the darkness.



“Stay here,” he said, his voice low and steady. “I’ll handle this.”



The engine grew louder, the headlights cutting through the trees as the car approached the cabin. My chest tightened with fear as I watched Adrian tense, his body ready for whatever was coming. He stepped off the porch and into the driveway, his figure illuminated by the glow of the approaching vehicle.



The car came to a stop, its engine idling. For a moment, nothing happened. Then the driver’s door opened, and Ethan stepped out.



My breath caught in my throat. He looked disheveled, his suit wrinkled, his tie loosened. But his eyes were sharp, filled with anger and something darker—betrayal.



“Emily,” he called out, his voice eerily calm. “Come here.”



Adrian stepped between us, his posture protective. “She’s not going anywhere with you.”



Ethan laughed, a hollow, bitter sound. “Of course you’d be here. The loyal friend, always waiting in the wings. I should’ve known.”



“You need to leave,” Adrian said, his voice steady but firm. “This ends here.”



Ethan ignored him, his gaze fixed on me. “Do you have any idea what you’ve done? You’ve ruined everything, Emily. Our life, our future—you’ve destroyed it.”



I stepped forward, my hands shaking. “You destroyed it, Ethan. The lies, the crimes… I didn’t sign up for this.”



His face twisted with rage, and he took a step closer. “You think you’re safe with him? You think he can protect you? He’s nothing.”



Adrian’s fists clenched, but he stayed still, keeping himself between me and Ethan. “This isn’t about me. It’s about you facing the consequences of your actions.”



Ethan’s laugh turned into a sneer. “Consequences? You have no idea what you’re dealing with. Do you really think the people I work with will let this slide? They’ll come after her, after both of you. And when they do, there’ll be nowhere to hide.”



Adrian didn’t waver. “We’re not afraid of you. It’s over, Ethan.”



Ethan’s hand twitched, and I saw the glint of something metallic at his side—a gun. My heart stopped, and I felt myself freeze. Adrian saw it too, his body going rigid.



“Ethan, please,” I said, my voice trembling. “You don’t have to do this.”



His gaze snapped to me, and for a moment, I thought I saw something flicker in his eyes—regret, hesitation, maybe even pain. But it was gone as quickly as it came.



“You made your choice,” he said, raising the gun. “Now live with it.”



Adrian moved faster than I thought possible. He lunged at Ethan, grabbing his arm and twisting it away. The gun fired, the sound deafening in the quiet night. I screamed, ducking down as the two men struggled. The weapon fell to the ground, and Adrian kicked it out of reach.



They fought in the driveway, a clash of fists and fury. Adrian was stronger, but Ethan was desperate, his movements wild and unpredictable. I wanted to help, but fear rooted me in place.



Finally, Adrian landed a solid punch, sending Ethan sprawling to the ground. He stood over him, breathing hard. “Stay down,” he warned.



Ethan glared up at him, blood trickling from his lip. “You think you’ve won? This isn’t over.”



Adrian didn’t respond. Instead, he grabbed the gun and emptied the chamber, tossing the pieces into the woods. Then he turned to me, his expression softening.



“Are you okay?” he asked, his voice gentle.



I nodded, though my legs felt like jelly. “What about him?” I gestured to Ethan, who was still on the ground, glaring at both of us.



“We’ll call the police,” Adrian said. “They can take it from here.”



The aftermath was a blur of sirens and questions. The authorities took Ethan into custody, adding charges of assault and illegal possession of a firearm to his already lengthy list of crimes. As he was led away in handcuffs, he shot me one last look, a mixture of anger and something that almost resembled sadness.



Adrian stayed by my side through it all, his presence steady and grounding. When the officers left and the cabin was quiet again, I turned to him, my emotions threatening to overwhelm me.



“It’s over,” I whispered, more to myself than to him.



Adrian reached for my hand, his touch warm and reassuring. “Yes, it is.”



I looked up at him, searching his face. “What now?”



His lips curved into a small, hopeful smile. “Now we start over. Together, if you’ll have me.”



Tears filled my eyes, but they were tears of relief, of gratitude, of something I hadn’t felt in a long time—hope. I nodded, unable to speak. Adrian pulled me into his arms, holding me close as the weight of the past began to lift.



For the first time in months, I felt like I could breathe again. The future was uncertain, but it was ours to shape. And as long as Adrian was by my side, I knew I could face whatever came next.

* **Van Cleef and Arpels Orchidee Vanille**: a non-cloying vanilla. I get the sweetness from the vanilla, but a powdery note (maybe iris or violet) dries off the sticky syrupy facets. This could even work in a professional setting. This layers nicely with a woody scent
* **Byredo Gypsy Water:** it smells like a gin fizz with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The sparkly citrus opening and the icy feel the juniper gives takes away the chance of it feeling sickly. I wear this often even in the summer.
* **Commodity Gold Expressive:** a really soothing and cozy scent. I consider this a winter version of Gypsy Water. The musk makes it more fuzzy. I find benzoin to be a very agreeable and clean base which helps
* **Tokyomilk Dark Tainted Love:** I bought this in university back when Sephora carried this line because I wanted something sexy and sweet and this sounded cool. I still like it and find it nostalgic. It is sweet from the vanilla, but fairly woody and you can definitely smell black tea. It is super cozy, but dark enough for night time. It reminds me of Fragrance Du Bois Santal Complet, and Van Cleef and Arpels Santal Blanc, so it smells $$$ for the $50 I got it for. It also performs quite well.

**GOURMAND-ISH (scents with at least 1 dominant note)**

* **Diptyque L’Eau Papier:** I learned I love the smell of steamed rice. The smell seems to trick my brain into believing my skin is moist and soft the way steamed rice is. The combination with musk is so gorgeous, and the sesame note enhances that savoury and fuzzy feeling.
* **Tom Ford Noir De Noir:** I don't own this, but it may be one of the most beautiful things I've ever smelled. It is a very unisex, opulent, and sultry scent. Wine, roses, and dark chocolate is what you get from this. I'm not sure there is chocolate in here, so maybe that feeling is created from the patchouli and black truffle. I'm a sucker for a rose-patchouli chypre, and the gourmand touch makes this outstanding.
* **Tom Ford Noir Extreme:** I've smelled this on dates before. It is very sexy even if I wouldn't wear it. It is spicy enough to balance out the sweetness. It smells more creamy and lactonic than sweet if anything.
* **Byredo Sundazed:** this is a really weird scent but it works. If you love neroli and liked the idea of Love Don’t be Shy or PDM Oriana, but found them cloying or sticky, you may like this. This is undoubtedly very sweet and you can definitely smell the cotton candy, but is somehow so musky and citrus forward that it still smells very clean and fresh. It is quite sharp, and I would really only wear this in the summer if I do purchase it. It smells like limoncello flavoured laundry detergent to me.
* **LUSH American Cream:** a shocker for me. This smells nothing like the description (”a strawberry milkshake”). It is lactonic for sure, but it is also very powdery (iris maybe). There may be some fruityness in there, but I get a strong herbal feeling - lavender or clary sage. It smells more like a tea latte powder mix to me. Not very sweet. I love layering this with Glossier You.
* **Kilian Intoxicated:** I have been looking for a good coffee scent, and this was the best one I found (didn't have access to Akro Awake). Smells like Turkish coffee and there's really not much else to it. I don't wear this often because it feels too on the nose gourmand, but will occasionally reach for my sample. This is not a sweet scent at all and is very unisex-masculine. If you love cardamom and coffee, this will smell good to you.",4,1737126753.0,FemFragLab,2,1.0,False

1i3igzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp_Healing/comments/1i3igzl/breaking_free_from_triggers_why_they_show_up_and/,Breaking Free from Triggers - Why They Show Up and How to Overcome Them,"Breakup triggers can feel like emotional landmines, popping up when you least expect them. Whether it’s a song, a scent, a location, or even a memory, these triggers can transport you back to a painful moment and make it feel as though you’ve made no progress in your healing. But the truth is, encountering triggers is part of the process—and understanding them is the first step to breaking free.

# Why Do Triggers Keep Showing Up?

1. **Unresolved Emotions** Triggers are often tied to emotions you haven’t fully processed. They resurface to show you where healing still needs to happen. For example, a photo of your ex might sting if you’re still mourning the dreams you shared together.
2. **Neurochemical Memories** Your brain forms strong connections during intense emotional experiences. The places you visited, the songs you loved, or even the coffee shop where you spent time together can evoke memories that feel just as vivid as the day they happened.
3. **Attachment Patterns** When you’re deeply attached to someone, their absence leaves a void. Triggers remind you of the connection you had, even if it wasn’t healthy.

# How to Break the Cycle

Breaking the hold triggers have on you doesn’t mean avoiding them forever. Instead, it’s about taking their power away. Here’s how:

# 1. Face Them Head-On

Avoiding triggers can make them feel bigger and scarier than they really are. If a particular song brings you to tears, try listening to it intentionally. Let yourself cry, journal your emotions, and remind yourself it’s okay to grieve.

# 2. Reframe the Meaning

Triggers hold power because of the meaning you’ve attached to them. If a place reminds you of heartbreak, try creating new memories there. Go with friends or by yourself and focus on reclaiming the space.

# 3. Ground Yourself

When a trigger catches you off guard, grounding techniques can bring you back to the present. Try:

* Naming five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste.
* Taking slow, deep breaths to calm your nervous system.

# 4. Write a New Story

Triggers are part of your past, but they don’t define your future. Each time you overcome one, you’re rewriting your story. Use affirmations like:

* “This memory doesn’t control me anymore.”
* “I am safe, whole, and healing.”

# 5. Seek Support

Healing doesn’t have to be a solo journey. Join communities of women who understand what you’re going through. Sharing your struggles can remind you that you’re not alone and help you see your triggers from a different perspective.

# Remember: Healing Isn’t Linear

Triggers might show up less often as time goes on, but they may never disappear completely—and that’s okay. What matters is how you respond. Each time you face a trigger, you’re proving to yourself that you’re stronger than your pain.

I (f22) recently started thinking that my husband (m32) is literally trying poison me. I swear I would not make this accusation without trying to think of anything else possible (including that I am crazy) but I just can’t anymore. 

So recently me and my husband have had a few rough months. He got a new promotion with a small pay bump and a huge responsibility bump and he isn’t happy at his job any longer. I had a few health issues that resulted our intimate part of our relationship suffering too. We’ve been bickering a lot and just overall not great. 

A few weeks ago my husband made me a cup of coffee. Now- he never makes me coffee, because I drink espresso and he drinks the regular kind. He doesn’t really know how I make mine. But I was grateful, thinking maybe this was his way of trying to say sorry for our shortcomings with each other. 

However when I drank it- it was *awful*. I didn’t want to be rude but I was like erm this is not great, what did you do? He immediately got defensive because of course he did, and told me I was ungrateful yet again. I apologized and forced myself to drink about 3/4 of it. But it was so awful, it tasted sour and smelt weird and it was horrible. It was even a strange color. I had thought he made the espresso wrong. 

However a few days after that, I went to get water out of our fridge, from a container only I drink out of. I put fruit and things in the water and my husband doesn’t like it, so it’s literally only me who drinks it. When I took it out of the fridge, it was an odd color too. I smelt it, and it smelt kinda the same. At this point I suspected that something was wrong with our water.

I asked my husband he acted clueless. He ended up saying maybe it was bad fruit. That didn’t explain the coffee but okay, I went with bad fruit and just poured the water out. 

However yesterday, I was in our garage (which I never am) looking for an old watering can around the yard stuff. While there I smelt that weird smell again, just like I had with the water and coffee. 

It was bug repellent spray, the kind you spray and put on the floors and stuff for bugs. I did not remember buying this or my husband buying this, but it was open and half the jug was gone. My stomach was sick. I literally went as far as spraying some in a cup, and it was the exact same color as I saw. 

I’m 99% sure that that bug poison was what was in my drinks. Am I fucking crazy for thinking this?? I thought maybe my husband had sprayed it in the cabinets and it gotten into our cups, but then why wouldn’t he have noticed either? I’m just so confused and so upset and idk what to do. Did my husband try to poison me? ",1,1737126618.0,AITAH,14,0.67,False

Would anyone have any recommendations or think of a syrup/sauce/flavoring that might be similar?

Monin Toasted Almond Mocha - closer but I thought the mocha still overpowered and looking for just almond

I’m a single man in my early 30s, and my younger brother, Dan, is 29. Dan, however, has an entirely different life than me. By 22, he had already become a father, and now he has four children, with the youngest born just a few months ago. His wife, Sil (short for Sister-in-Law, but also very fitting for her cold personality), and I don’t get along. She has a way of carrying herself that screams entitlement. She acts superior to everyone, especially me, and anytime I challenge her behavior, she flips the narrative and becomes the ultimate victim. She cries on cue, turning even the most innocent exchange into a performance worthy of an Oscar.



My parents and Dan adore her. They’re fully aware of how manipulative she can be but choose to turn a blind eye. To be fair, Sil is physically attractive, but her beauty is eclipsed by her toxic personality. I could never be drawn to someone like her, not that she’s ever sought my approval. Despite holding a college degree, she refuses to work. She insists on being a full-time mom, even though my own mother ends up doing most of the childcare while Sil spends her days on her phone or complaining about how hard her life is. Financially, they’re entirely dependent on Dan, whose job barely covers their living expenses. As a result, Dan and his family live in our parents’ three-bedroom house, which was built in the 1960s and is far too small for so many people.



Living arrangements aside, growing up, Dan was undeniably the golden child. Our three-year age gap didn’t stop him from being treated as if he was the center of the universe. My parents made no secret of their favoritism. He got the best of everything—more gifts, more attention, more freedom. If anyone outside the family noticed, my parents quickly shut them down or brushed it off. When other relatives started pointing out the blatant favoritism, my parents didn’t address it—they simply moved us 150 miles away to avoid the criticism. That move only cemented their bias further.



Dan’s superiority complex wasn’t just a result of favoritism—it was nurtured. Anytime I tried to stand up for myself, I was punished. My parents made it clear that my role was to endure, to stay quiet, and to let Dan have his way. He took full advantage of that. He was physically abusive at times, constantly bullied me, and even flirted with my first girlfriend until she dumped me. When I complained, my parents dismissed it, telling me to “suck it up.” Their favoritism was so blatant that even as a teenager, I knew I couldn’t wait to escape their house.



When I turned 18, I finally left home. I wasn’t even done with high school yet, but couch-surfing with friends felt like paradise compared to enduring life under their roof. My parents didn’t try to stop me; in fact, they celebrated my departure. It meant they no longer had to “deal with” me. They didn’t attend my high school graduation, and frankly, I didn’t care. I had cut ties emotionally long before leaving physically. From that point on, I kept minimal contact, only seeing them on holidays and only out of obligation.



Part 2: Struggles During the Pandemic | 3:13



Life went relatively smoothly after I left my parents’ house. I had a stable job, a decent apartment shared with a roommate, and a social circle that made me feel supported. But when the pandemic hit in early 2020, everything fell apart. My company downsized, and I was among the employees let go. My roommate, who worked in hospitality, also lost his job. Neither of us could afford to stay in our rented two-bedroom condo with just unemployment benefits, so we reluctantly gave up the lease.



As the lease ended, my roommate left to move in with his family, but I didn’t have the same option. My parents had made it clear over the years that I wasn’t welcome back. Out of desperation, I called them anyway, hoping they might let me park my truck with a camper in their driveway temporarily. The answer? A firm no. They claimed their house was already full with Dan and his family living there, and they didn’t want me around, citing “past tensions” as their excuse.



To make matters worse, they said I could park my camper there only if I paid them what amounted to the cost of renting a small apartment. I was stunned. Here I was, jobless, with barely any savings, and they wanted to squeeze money out of me just for parking space. When I pointed out the absurdity of their request, they brushed me off and told me to “figure it out.” Sil thought the whole situation was hilarious and even joined Dan in mocking me. They called me a “bum” and laughed at my misfortune, reveling in the fact that I had nowhere to go.



Left with no choice, I sold most of my belongings and bought a $1,000 camper to attach to my truck. That camper became my home. On my first night, I parked in a store parking lot, terrified that someone might try to break in. Sleep didn’t come easily. The weeks that followed were some of the hardest of my life. Every day, I searched for places where I could safely park overnight. Public bathrooms and gyms became my lifelines for basic hygiene. I used a long extension cord to steal electricity from public outlets, just to keep my camper batteries charged and my refrigerator running. I knew it wasn’t entirely ethical, but survival doesn’t leave much room for morality.



I tried to stay in my area, even though moving back to my hometown would have been easier logistically. I was attached to the city I’d built my life in, and I believed my best job opportunities were still there. But surviving without a stable place to live tested my resilience in ways I never imagined. I had to deal with everything from nosy neighbors who complained about my camper being an eyesore to outright threats from people claiming I was breaking some nonexistent HOA rule. One man even became belligerent and threatened to call the police. To avoid trouble, I kept moving my camper, trying to stay under the radar.



After months of living like a nomad, I finally landed a new job in a neighboring city. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was steady work, and I threw myself into it. My new boss was surprisingly accommodating. He allowed me to park my camper behind the company warehouse and even let me hook it up to the building for electricity. In exchange, I worked extra shifts whenever needed and volunteered for Sunday maintenance tasks. It wasn’t an ideal arrangement, but it gave me a sense of stability I hadn’t felt in months.



During that time, I saved every penny I could. I ate cheap meals, avoided unnecessary expenses, and gradually rebuilt my life. My camper became a strange sort of sanctuary. It was cramped and often unbearably hot in the summer, but it was mine. It kept me sheltered and gave me the freedom to keep moving forward.



Part 3: A New Beginning and Buying a Home | 6:50



Months of relentless hard work finally began to pay off. By mid-2021, I was promoted to a supervisory position at my job, and for the first time in over a year, I was earning a solid salary. With my new income, I was determined to leave my nomadic life behind and find a permanent place to live. The scare of nearly becoming homeless had reshaped my priorities—I wanted stability, security, and a space that was truly mine.



I started looking for a house close to my workplace and soon found a three-bedroom manufactured home just two miles away. It was modest but perfect for my needs, and it had a small backyard where I could park my camper. After some negotiation, I managed to get the house for $10,000 less than the asking price. It wasn’t easy. I drained nearly my entire savings for the down payment and barely got approved for a home loan, but in the end, it was worth every penny.



When I finally moved in, the sense of relief was overwhelming. For the first time in years, I had a roof over my head that I could truly call my own. I even set up my camper in the backyard, treating it like a small guesthouse or emergency backup. It became a symbol of my resilience—a reminder of how far I’d come.



In my excitement, I made the mistake of sharing my success on social media. I posted photos of my new house, captioning them with how proud I was to have achieved this milestone. Most of my friends and extended family congratulated me, but it wasn’t long before my parents and Dan saw the post. That’s when the real trouble began.



A few weeks later, my parents, Dan, and his entire family showed up at my doorstep unannounced. I had never given them my address, so how they found out where I lived remains a mystery. I suspect they might have stalked me or followed me home from work. Regardless, I opened the door to find them all standing there like they owned the place. Before I could say anything, they pushed past me and started wandering around the house like tourists on a guided tour.



Sil had this unsettling smirk on her face as she inspected every room. My parents kept commenting on how much space I had, repeatedly mentioning that it was “too much for someone like me” who didn’t have a wife or kids. Dan chimed in, saying that my house was not only larger than our parents’ but also conveniently closer to his job. The red flags were everywhere, but I played along for the moment, curious to see where this was going.



Eventually, Dan asked to speak with me privately. Everyone else left the room and gathered on the front porch, as if they had rehearsed this moment. Dan started by saying that my house was too big for a single man like me and that it would be better suited for his growing family. He suggested that I move into my camper and let his family live in the main house. He even had the audacity to say there would be “rules” and “curfews” for when I could enter the house if I agreed to his plan.



At that moment, it all clicked. They weren’t just visiting—they were planning to take over my house. Dan acted like this was a done deal, even reaching out his hand to shake on it. I couldn’t hold back anymore. I told him a loud, resounding “Hell no.”



Dan looked stunned, as if he couldn’t comprehend why I wouldn’t just hand over my home to him. I stood up and told him that I had worked too hard to buy this house, and I wasn’t going to give it up just because he thought he deserved it more. He started yelling, saying that I had “no wife or kids” and didn’t need the space. When I pointed out that he hadn’t even offered to pay rent, he dismissed it, saying he “shouldn’t have to” because “family comes first.”



At this point, my parents and Sil barged back in, surrounding me and demanding that I “do this for Dan.” Sil started screaming about how she was pregnant again and needed the space for her kids. When I refused, she lost her temper, lunging at me and hitting me in the face. Dan had to physically restrain her as she screamed and tried to claw at me, threatening to “scratch my eyes out.”



I had had enough. I pulled out my phone, which I had been recording on the entire time, and told them all to leave before I called the cops. Sil started crying dramatically, but I held my ground. My mother tried one last time to guilt me, saying I had a week to “come to my senses.” I told her that I wouldn’t and slammed the door behind them as they left.



Part 4: Family Pressure and the Fight for the House | 11:15



The week following that chaotic confrontation was eerily quiet, but I knew it wouldn’t last. True to their word, my parents, Dan, and Sil showed up at my house exactly a week later, as if they expected me to have a sudden change of heart. They rang my doorbell incessantly and pounded on the door until I finally answered. This time, I was prepared. I had installed latch chains on the door and braced myself behind it, only opening it a crack.



Dan immediately tried to push his way in, but the chains held firm. My father joined in, demanding that I let them inside. I stood my ground and told them I was recording everything on my phone and would call the police if they attempted to force entry. My mother, in her signature overly sweet tone, tried to guilt-trip me again.



“Why can’t you just do this for Dan? He’s your brother! You’re family!” she said, her voice dripping with insincerity.



I couldn’t help but laugh bitterly. “Family? You mean the same family that laughed at me when I was homeless? The same family that mocked me for living in a camper? The same family that wouldn’t even let me park in their driveway without charging me an arm and a leg? That’s the family you want me to sacrifice my house for?” I said, my voice rising with every word.



My mother’s crocodile tears started flowing as she begged me to reconsider, claiming that I was being selfish and ungrateful. But I was done being manipulated. I told them, loud enough for the neighbors to hear, that they had no right to demand anything from me. I had worked hard to buy my house, and I wasn’t going to give it up just because they felt entitled to it.



When it became clear that I wasn’t going to cave, Sil snapped. She started screaming, her face twisted with rage. “You’re a selfish bastard! You don’t even have a family! What do you need all this space for? I’m pregnant, and you’re just going to leave us out on the street? How could you do this to me?!” she shrieked, her voice piercing.



“Do this to you?” I shot back. “I’ve done nothing to you! You just assumed you could waltz in here and take what’s mine. I don’t owe you or your family anything, and I certainly don’t care how many kids you have. Get out of my yard before I call the cops.”



That’s when Sil completely lost it. She lunged at me again, but this time, I was ready. I stepped back, closed the door, and locked it while she pounded on it from the outside. Through the window, I could see her crying hysterically while Dan tried to calm her down. My parents stood by, looking defeated but still unwilling to admit they were in the wrong.



I called the police, reporting the disturbance and the physical threats. By the time the officers arrived, Sil and Dan had locked themselves in their minivan, while my parents stood on the lawn, pretending nothing had happened. The police took statements from everyone, but I had video evidence of Sil’s earlier assault and their attempts to force their way into my house. The officers warned them to leave or face legal consequences. Reluctantly, they all left, but not without a final jab from Sil, who screamed out the window, “You’ll regret this!”



The Break-In | 14:25



A few days later, I returned home from work to find a moving truck parked in my driveway. My heart sank as I saw Dan’s minivan next to it. Sil was standing on the porch with her arms crossed, looking smug. They had broken into my house. The lock on my front door had been drilled out, and a brand-new lock was installed in its place. My belongings had been shoved aside to make room for their furniture, which was piled haphazardly in the living room.



When I confronted them, Dan acted like this was the most normal thing in the world. “We need this house more than you do,” he said casually. “Mom said it’s fine, so you should just go live in your camper.”



Sil, with her signature smirk, added, “You’ll be happier that way. Trust me.”



I was furious. Without saying a word, I got back in my truck, locked the doors, and called the police. Sil, realizing what I was doing, began pounding on my truck window, screaming for me to stop. She even threatened to key my truck if I didn’t hang up. The 911 operator heard everything, including her threats, through my slightly open window.



When the police arrived, Dan and Sil locked themselves in the house, refusing to come out. I explained the situation, showing them my driver’s license with the address as proof of ownership. The officers eventually convinced Dan to open the door. Inside, they found the old lock, the drill they used, and even a fake rental agreement with a forged signature that they had prepared to justify their actions. It was laughable how blatant their fraud was.



I demanded that they leave immediately and warned that I would press charges for trespassing, breaking and entering, and forgery if they didn’t. My parents showed up mid-way through the ordeal and tried to spin the situation, claiming I had agreed to let Dan live there. But the evidence was overwhelmingly in my favor. Faced with the reality of legal consequences, Dan and Sil reluctantly packed up their belongings and left.



Part 5: Escalation and the Aftermath | 16:25



After Dan and Sil were forced to leave my house, I hoped that the nightmare was finally over. But deep down, I knew better. People like them don’t give up easily, and my family had a history of pushing boundaries to get what they wanted.



A few days later, I received a call from an unknown number. Against my better judgment, I answered. It was someone ranting about how I was a “horrible brother” and how I needed to “make way for a real family man” like Dan. I hung up and blocked the number. Shortly after, I received similar messages on social media from distant relatives and even complete strangers. Clearly, my parents, Dan, and Sil had started a smear campaign against me, twisting the story to make it seem like I was the villain.



Rather than stay silent, I decided to get ahead of their lies. I made a detailed post on my social media, explaining everything that had happened, complete with screenshots of the fake rental agreement, photos of the damaged lock, and a summary of Sil’s physical assault. The post spread like wildfire among my extended family. Many relatives who had once stayed neutral or sided with my parents began reaching out to express their support for me. The tide was turning, and it was clear that Dan and Sil were losing credibility fast.



The final blow came when I shared the video recordings I had made during their attempts to take over my house. The footage showed everything—Dan demanding my house as if it were his right, Sil attacking me, and my parents egging them on. After seeing the evidence, even the relatives who had initially supported them began to back off. The pressure seemed to overwhelm Dan and Sil, and for a while, things went quiet.



The Ultimatum | 18:06



A week later, my parents showed up at my house again—this time without Dan or Sil. My mother rang the doorbell repeatedly, and my father pounded on the door until I answered. When I finally opened it, they tried to push their way in again, but I had learned my lesson. The latch chains held firm, and I stood my ground.



My mother started with her usual guilt-tripping tactics. “We’re just trying to help Dan. He needs a better place for his family, and you have so much space. Why can’t you just do this for him?” she asked, her voice trembling with fake sincerity.



I interrupted her. “You mean the same Dan who broke into my house? The same Sil who assaulted me and tried to take my truck? The same parents who refused to let me park my camper in their driveway when I was homeless? That Dan?”



My mother’s expression faltered, but she quickly regained her composure. “We didn’t know things were so bad for you then,” she said weakly. “But you’re doing well now! You could spare some space—”



“Spare some space? This isn’t a guest room we’re talking about; it’s my entire house!” I snapped. “And no, I won’t give it up. Not for Dan, not for you, not for anyone.”



My father, who had been silent until now, finally spoke up. “You’re being unreasonable. Family comes first. You don’t even have a family—”



“And whose fault is that?” I shot back. “You treated me like dirt for years, favored Dan over me in every possible way, and now you want me to sacrifice the one thing I’ve worked so hard for? You’ve got some nerve.”



They continued to plead, but I refused to budge. When they realized I wasn’t going to cave, my father became angry. “Fine,” he said, his voice dripping with disdain. “If you’re going to be like this, don’t expect us to be there for you.”



I laughed bitterly. “You’ve never been there for me. Why would I expect anything different now?”



The Break-In Attempt, Part 2 | 20:02



The final straw came a few days later when I returned home from work to find my parents, Dan, and Sil outside my house again. This time, they had a locksmith with them. Apparently, they were trying to change the locks again, believing they could bully their way back in.



I parked my truck in the driveway, blocking the locksmith’s van, and immediately started recording on my phone. When I approached, my parents tried to play it off like they were doing me a favor. “We’re just making things easier for everyone,” my father said with a fake smile.



“Easier for who? Certainly not me,” I replied, holding up my phone. “Leave now, or I’ll call the police. And this time, I’ll press charges.”



Dan, emboldened by my parents’ presence, tried to intimidate me. “You can’t keep us out forever. We’re family. This house belongs to all of us.”



“No, it belongs to me,” I shot back. “And if you don’t leave right now, you’ll all be explaining yourselves to a judge.”



At that moment, Sil lost her composure. “You’re a selfish bastard! You’re ruining our family! Why can’t you just do this for Dan?” she screamed, tears streaming down her face.



I ignored her and called the police. When the officers arrived, they didn’t hesitate to side with me. The locksmith, realizing he had been misled, quickly packed up and left. My parents, Dan, and Sil were once again forced to leave, but not before my mother hissed, “You’ll regret this.”



Part 6: The Fallout | 21:33



After their second attempt to force their way into my house failed, my family seemed to retreat for a while. But the damage was done. My parents’ reputation among our extended family was in shambles. Word of their actions spread quickly, and my social media post, combined with the video evidence, ensured that their version of events couldn’t gain traction. For once, people saw them for who they truly were.



Dan and Sil, however, didn’t take the fallout well. Sil became increasingly erratic on social media, posting vague complaints about how hard it was to live with my parents and how unfair it was that I refused to “help out family.” She conveniently left out the part about trying to steal my house. Every few days, she’d post about how cramped my parents’ house was, how much her kids needed their own space, and how I was the villain in her life story.



Dan, on the other hand, went silent. I heard through mutual connections that his relationship with Sil was deteriorating. The constant tension, combined with their financial struggles, had taken a toll on their marriage. Apparently, my parents were also starting to crack under the pressure of having six people (including a screaming newborn) crammed into their house. My mother, who had once adored Sil, now complained endlessly about her laziness and entitled behavior. The golden façade of their perfect family was beginning to crumble.



The Bombshell: Sil’s Affair | 22:58



The real turning point came a few months later. Dan called me out of the blue, his voice shaking with anger and despair. “You were right about her,” he said. “Sil’s been cheating on me.”



I wasn’t entirely surprised, but the revelation still hit hard. Sil had always carried herself with an air of superiority, as though she was better than everyone else. But behind the scenes, she had been having an affair with a coworker—a man she later claimed was “more of a man” than Dan could ever be.



Dan wasn’t about to let it slide. He secretly conducted a DNA test on their youngest child, the one Sil had used as her ultimate guilt card in their attempt to take my house. The results confirmed his worst fears: the baby wasn’t his.



When he confronted Sil with the evidence, she broke down, cycling through denial, anger, and pathetic attempts at justification. “It was just one mistake!” she cried. But Dan wasn’t buying it. He had been humiliated enough, and this was the final straw. He filed for divorce immediately, citing adultery and abuse. In our state, which has fault-based divorce laws, this gave him a significant advantage in court.



The Divorce Battle | 24:09



Sil’s behavior during the divorce was as dramatic as you’d expect. She tried every trick in the book to paint herself as the victim, but Dan had come prepared. He had records of her financial recklessness, her verbal abuse, and, of course, her infidelity. My video evidence of her physical assault and trespassing only added to her downfall.



The court didn’t look kindly on her. Dan was awarded primary custody of their three oldest children, while Sil was granted only limited visitation. She also lost any claim to alimony due to her affair and was saddled with a significant portion of their shared debt. To make matters worse for her, the biological father of her youngest child wanted nothing to do with her or the baby, leaving her entirely on her own.



By the time the divorce was finalized, Sil was living with her parents, working a minimum-wage job to scrape by. She had gone from playing the queen bee to being an outcast, with no one left to manipulate or depend on.



A Shift in Family Dynamics | 25:08



The fallout from Sil’s actions extended beyond the divorce. My parents, who had once idolized her, now resented her for tearing their family apart. For the first time in my life, they seemed genuinely remorseful about how they had treated me. My mother even apologized—an actual, heartfelt apology—for the years of favoritism and neglect.



“You deserved better,” she said one evening when she visited me unannounced. “We should have treated you the same as Dan. I don’t know why we didn’t.”



I didn’t let her off the hook that easily. “You didn’t ‘forget,’ Mom. You made a choice. And that choice cost you a relationship with me.”



She nodded, tears in her eyes, and for once, she didn’t try to argue.



My father, on the other hand, struggled to connect with me. He wasn’t one for words, but his actions spoke volumes. He started inviting me to family gatherings, going out of his way to include me in conversations, and even offering to help with small projects around my house. While I appreciated the effort, I remained cautious. Years of mistreatment don’t just disappear overnight.



Dan, now divorced and living in the camper I had loaned him, also made an effort to rebuild our relationship. He admitted to being a terrible brother and apologized for the way he had treated me growing up. “I was a spoiled ass,” he said during one of our conversations. “I let them pit us against each other, and I never stopped to think about how it affected you.”



I wasn’t ready to forgive him completely, but I appreciated his honesty. Over time, we began to rebuild a tentative bond—not as brothers, but as two men trying to move forward.



Moving On | 26:49



With Sil out of the picture and my family making amends, my life started to stabilize. I rented out two of the spare rooms in my house to reliable tenants, which helped me pay off my mortgage faster. I even started exploring the idea of dating, something I had put on hold for years due to the chaos in my life.



Meanwhile, my camper, once a symbol of survival, had become a guesthouse of sorts. I loaned it to Dan so his eldest son could finally have his own room, a small gesture that felt like the right thing to do. It wasn’t about forgiveness; it was about breaking the cycle of neglect and favoritism that had defined our family for so long.



As for Sil, she faded into obscurity. She rarely posted on social media anymore, and when she did, it was nothing more than vague complaints about her life. I heard through the grapevine that she was still working at her parents’ business, struggling to make ends meet. Part of me felt a small pang of pity for her, but it was outweighed by the satisfaction of knowing she could no longer manipulate or harm anyone I cared about.



Part 7: Closure and a New Chapter | 27:53



With the dust settling, I finally began to enjoy the life I had fought so hard to build. My house became a true sanctuary—filled not just with the things I loved, but with the peace and stability I had craved for so long. Renting out the spare rooms to two reliable tenants provided financial security and, surprisingly, a sense of camaraderie. Both were in their 30s, like me, and we shared an understanding of boundaries, making them the ideal housemates.



The drama with my family had diminished, but the scars it left behind were still healing. Despite their attempts to reconcile, I couldn’t forget the years of neglect and mistreatment. Forgiveness, I realized, wasn’t a switch I could flip—it was a process, one I wasn’t sure I’d ever complete.



The Final Blow: Sil’s Last Act | 28:42



Just when I thought Sil had finally faded into the background, she reared her entitled head one last time. It happened late one night, about six months after her divorce was finalized. I woke up to a notification on my phone from my doorbell camera. Someone was outside my house, creeping around. I pulled up the live feed and saw a figure in heavy sweats and sunglasses, their face wrapped in a scarf.



The person—clearly trying to hide their identity—was throwing eggs at my truck. By the time I got outside, they were gone, disappearing into the night on foot. I reviewed the footage and immediately suspected Sil. She was the right height, and her animosity toward me had been simmering for years. But without concrete evidence, there wasn’t much I could do besides file a police report and keep an eye out for future incidents.



I decided to share the footage with my parents and Dan, just to gauge their reactions. My father rolled his eyes and muttered something about “childish behavior,” while my mother looked genuinely embarrassed. Dan, however, couldn’t hold back his frustration. “That’s definitely her,” he said, shaking his head. “She’s been bitter ever since the divorce. She probably blames you for everything.”



The police didn’t have much to go on, but they added the report to the growing file I had on Sil’s harassment. It wasn’t the first time she had caused trouble, and I doubted it would be the last. But knowing I had cameras and a solid record of her behavior gave me peace of mind. If she ever tried something more serious, I was ready to press charges.



A Family on the Mend | 30:17



In the months that followed, my family’s dynamic began to shift in unexpected ways. Dan, who had once been the golden child, was now living in the camper I had loaned him, trying to piece his life back together. Despite everything, I admired his effort. He was a far cry from the arrogant brother I had grown up with.



Our parents, meanwhile, were grappling with the reality of their favoritism. My mother, especially, seemed determined to make amends. She often dropped by with homemade meals or little gifts, small gestures that I knew were her way of trying to rebuild our relationship. My father, ever the stoic, still struggled to connect, but even he made attempts—fixing things around my house, offering advice on home maintenance, and occasionally joining me for coffee.



For the first time in years, I felt like I had the upper hand. I no longer needed their approval, and they knew it. Our relationship was on my terms, and I wasn’t afraid to set boundaries.



Looking Ahead | 31:16



As for me, I began to focus on the future. My job was going well, my savings were growing, and I even started dating again. The experience of being homeless and fighting for my independence had changed me in ways I hadn’t fully appreciated. I was stronger, more resilient, and more confident in my ability to handle whatever life threw at me.



The camper, once a symbol of survival, had taken on a new role as a guesthouse. Dan’s kids loved visiting it, calling it their “adventure house.” I even began making plans to take it on an actual camping trip—something I had never done before. It felt poetic, in a way, to reclaim the camper not as a necessity, but as a choice.



Final Thoughts | 31:59



Sil’s influence had finally waned, her reputation in ruins and her manipulative tactics exposed. Dan was learning to navigate life as a single father, and my parents were slowly coming to terms with their past mistakes. The family that had once been a source of pain and resentment was now more like a distant echo—still present, but no longer controlling my life.



If there’s one thing I’ve learned from this experience, it’s that standing up for yourself is worth every ounce of effort. My house, my independence, my peace—they were all hard-won, but they were mine. And for the first time in years, I could finally look toward the future with hope.",10,1737126560.0,stories,11,1.0,False

I’m a 28-year-old from Europe, and I’m here looking for a connection that feels authentic—something built on shared understanding, good conversations, and maybe even a little magic. Whether we start with a friendly chat or dive into the bigger questions of life, I’m open to seeing where the journey takes us.

# A Bit About Me

* **Who I Am:** I’m a writer at heart—someone who’s fascinated by the world’s little details and always looking to capture its fleeting moments in words. I believe there’s poetry in everyday life if you look close enough. I’d describe myself as curious, introspective, and quietly optimistic.
* **My Interests:**
   * **Music:** I’m on a journey to become a vinyl collector (once I have the space for it!). I love crafting playlists that feel like soundtracks to moments in life, and I’m always hunting for new tracks that speak to the soul.
   * **Nature and Exploration:** Whether it’s hiking to catch a golden-hour view, wandering unfamiliar streets, or just stargazing on a clear night, I’m happiest when I’m exploring.
   * **Creativity:** I’ve been dabbling in photography lately, trying to turn fleeting scenes into lasting memories. Writing has always been my first love, but this new creative outlet is giving it some competition.
   * **Gaming and Relaxing:** On quieter days, I enjoy diving into a good game or settling in for a movie marathon—it’s all about balance, right?

# What I’m Looking For

I’m hoping to meet someone who’s as curious about life as I am. Here’s what I’d love in a partner:

* **Kindness:** You lead with your heart and care about the people around you. You’re the kind of person who finds joy in small gestures and values connection over pretense.
* **Curiosity:** You see the world as a big, wonderful puzzle to explore—whether that’s through travel, learning something new, or simply seeing the beauty in the everyday.
* **Openness:** Life is full of surprises, and you’re not afraid to embrace them. You’re willing to share your dreams, your quirks, and maybe even your favorite coffee order.
* **Partnership:** Someone who wants to build something together—a shared world full of laughter, quiet moments, and spontaneous adventures.

# Why Message Me?

I’d like to think I bring a unique mix of thoughtfulness and enthusiasm to the table. I’ll remember the little things about you—the way your favorite song makes you smile, the dreams you’re too shy to share, or the stories that light up your eyes. I’m loyal, steady, and the kind of person who shows up for the big moments and the small ones.

I believe in the magic of connection. Whether it’s through a shared playlist, a midnight chat, or a day spent exploring something new, I want to create moments that matter—moments that turn into memories we’ll always carry.

# Let’s Start a Story

If any of this resonates, send me a message. Let’s talk about music, share our favorite books, or dream up an imaginary trip to the most beautiful place we can think of. Or maybe we’ll just start with “hello” and see where the conversation takes us.

Every story starts with a single step—this could be ours. Looking forward to hearing from you. 😊",1,1737126554.0,r4r,1,0.67,False

It all began with what felt like a fairy tale introduction. Emma and I met through a mutual friend, Sarah, who couldn’t stop singing her praises. \*“She’s incredible—smart, funny, and absolutely stunning,”\* Sarah had said one evening, casually scrolling through Emma’s Instagram and showing me her photos. I was hesitant at first. Blind setups weren’t really my thing, and I wasn’t sure if someone like Emma would even be interested in me. But the more Sarah insisted, the more curious I became.



A few days later, Emma and I connected online. It started with a few harmless likes and comments on each other’s posts, which quickly turned into playful DMs. Within a week, we were texting every day. Emma was a breath of fresh air—witty, engaging, and genuinely interested in getting to know me. By the time I worked up the courage to ask her out, it already felt like we’d known each other forever.



Our first date was at a trendy rooftop restaurant downtown, the kind of place where the soft glow of string lights and the distant hum of the city made everything feel magical. Emma arrived in a sleek black dress that hugged her figure perfectly, her blonde hair falling in effortless waves over her shoulders. She had a presence about her—confident, radiant, the kind of person who could command attention without even trying.



“Wow,” I blurted out as she approached the table. “You look… amazing.”  

She smiled, her cheeks flushing slightly. “You clean up pretty well yourself,” she teased, her eyes scanning my outfit.  



The evening started off perfectly. We ordered drinks—a bold red wine for her, an old-fashioned for me—and dove into conversation. Emma told me about her job as a graphic designer, her love for painting, and her dream of one day opening her own gallery. Her passion was infectious. As she spoke, her hands moved animatedly, and her hazel eyes lit up with excitement. I couldn’t help but hang on her every word.



I shared my own love for cooking, recounting stories from the baking classes I’d recently started. Emma laughed when I told her about my first disastrous attempt at making macarons. “You’d be the perfect partner,” she said with a wink. “You bake, I paint—we’d make an unstoppable team.”



As the appetizers arrived, I found myself relaxing more and more in her presence. She had this incredible ability to make even the simplest topics—like her favorite coffee shop or her guilty pleasure TV shows—sound fascinating. The conversation flowed effortlessly, and for the first time in a long while, I felt like I was genuinely connecting with someone.



But then, something odd happened.



As I told her about my recent trip to Italy, I noticed a subtle change in her demeanor. Her smile faltered ever so slightly, and she reached for her wine glass, taking a longer sip than usual. “Have you ever been?” I asked, curious.  



Emma hesitated, her eyes darting briefly to the table. “No,” she said, her voice softer than before. “I mean, I’ve always wanted to, but… maybe someday.”  



Her response felt guarded, almost rehearsed. I decided not to press further, shifting the conversation to lighter topics, but the moment lingered in the back of my mind. Looking back, that was the first crack in the otherwise perfect image Emma had presented.



As the evening progressed, the initial tension seemed to fade. We moved on to entrees—she ordered a delicate sea bass dish, while I went for the steak—and the conversation returned to its easy flow. By the time dessert arrived, I was certain this was the best first date I’d ever been on.



But just as we were about to dig into a decadent chocolate tart, Emma’s phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen, her expression unreadable. “I’m so sorry,” she said, pushing her chair back. “I need to take this. Work stuff.”  



I watched as she stepped outside, her phone pressed to her ear. Through the glass doors, I could see her pacing back and forth, her free hand gesturing animatedly. Every now and then, she glanced over her shoulder, as if checking to see if someone was watching. It struck me as odd, but I convinced myself it was probably just a stressful call. Everyone has their moments, right?



When she returned, her demeanor had shifted. The easygoing energy she’d carried throughout the night was gone, replaced by a subtle tension. Her smile felt forced, and her responses to my questions were shorter, less engaged.  



“Is everything okay?” I asked gently.  



“Yeah,” she said quickly, brushing her hair behind her ear. “Just some work drama. Nothing to worry about.”  



I wanted to believe her, but something about the way she avoided eye contact made me uneasy. Still, it wasn’t my place to pry—not on a first date.



After dinner, I offered to walk her to her car. She hesitated for a split second before agreeing, and as we stepped out into the cool night air, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off.  



That’s when I saw him.



Standing a few feet away from Emma’s car was a man. He was tall, dressed in a sharp suit, and had an air of authority about him. But it wasn’t his appearance that caught my attention—it was the way he was staring at us. His eyes were locked on Emma, and his expression was a mix of anger and frustration.



Emma froze. Her hand tightened around her purse, and for the first time that evening, she looked genuinely afraid.  



“Oh, that’s my cousin,” she said with a nervous laugh. “He’s visiting from out of town, and I promised him a ride back to his hotel.”  



Her words were rushed, her voice shaky. The man didn’t move as we approached the car. Emma quickly opened the door, muttered something under her breath to him, and slid into the driver’s seat. He glanced at me briefly, his eyes cold and calculating, before climbing into the passenger side.



As they drove off, I stood there, replaying the night in my head. Everything had seemed perfect—too perfect. And now, this.



Little did I know, the events of that night were just the beginning of something far more complicated than I could have ever imagined.



The next morning, I couldn’t stop replaying the events of the previous night in my mind. Emma’s charming smile, her infectious laugh, and the way her eyes seemed to light up when she talked about her dreams—it had all felt so genuine. But then there was \*him\*, the man by her car, and the way her demeanor shifted the moment she saw him. Her rushed explanation about him being her cousin felt hollow, almost rehearsed. And his piercing stare? That wasn’t the look of a casual family visit.



I tried to brush it off, convincing myself that I was overthinking things. But as the hours passed, the nagging feeling in my gut only grew stronger. Something wasn’t right.



I decided to test the waters. Around midday, I texted Emma a lighthearted message: \*“Hey, just wanted to say I had a great time last night. Hope your ‘cousin’ didn’t keep you out too late 😉.”\* I added the winking emoji to keep the tone playful, but my curiosity was anything but.



Her reply didn’t come until hours later: \*“I had a great time too! Thanks for walking me to my car 😊. Let me check my schedule and get back to you about a second date!”\*  



It was polite and upbeat, but it felt distant, almost like she was trying to keep me at arm’s length. That night, I found myself scrolling through her Instagram, looking for clues—anything that might explain the situation. Her profile was a curated dream: stunning photos of her artwork, snapshots from sunny vacations, and perfectly filtered selfies. But nothing seemed out of the ordinary. No mention of the man from last night. No signs of anything suspicious.



Still, the uneasy feeling lingered. So, I reached out to Sarah, the mutual friend who introduced us. Over the phone, I tried to sound casual as I brought up the night before. \*“Hey, random question—do you know much about Emma’s family? She mentioned having a cousin in town, but she didn’t say much about him.”\*



There was a pause on the other end of the line before Sarah finally replied, \*“Cousin? That doesn’t sound like anyone I know. Are you sure that’s what she said?”\*



Her tone was cautious, as if she was trying not to reveal too much. My heart sank. \*“Yeah, she said he was visiting from out of town. Tall guy, dressed in a suit. He seemed… intense.”\*



Sarah let out a soft sigh. \*“Look, I don’t want to overstep, but if I were you, I’d tread carefully. Emma’s great, but she’s… complicated. Let’s just say she has a history of keeping things private.”\*



I pressed her for more, but Sarah wouldn’t elaborate. She told me to talk to Emma directly if I had questions, but the way she danced around the subject only fueled my suspicion.



The next day, I decided to do just that. Emma and I had already planned to meet for coffee, and I saw it as the perfect opportunity to clear the air. When she walked into the café, she looked as radiant as ever—her smile bright, her outfit effortlessly chic. But as she sat across from me, I noticed a subtle tension in her body language. She was tapping her fingers against her coffee cup, her eyes darting around the room as if she were expecting someone to walk in.



We started with small talk, discussing work and weekend plans, but the conversation felt surface-level, as though she were deliberately avoiding anything deeper. Finally, I decided to rip off the Band-Aid.



“So,” I began, keeping my tone casual, “about the guy at your car the other night—your cousin, right? He seemed… intense.”



Emma froze for a split second before forcing a laugh. “Oh, him,” she said, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “Yeah, he’s just a little overprotective. He thinks he has to look out for me, you know?”  



Her explanation felt rehearsed, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was hiding something. “Does he visit often?” I pressed, watching her closely.



“Not really,” she replied quickly, her smile faltering. “He’s just passing through. Anyway, enough about him—tell me more about your baking classes!”



The abrupt change in subject was a clear red flag. I decided not to push further, not wanting to ruin the date. But as we said our goodbyes and Emma walked to her car, the uneasy feeling in my gut only grew stronger.



That night, as I lay in bed, I received a text message from an unknown number. The message was short and chilling: \*“Stay away from Emma. She’s not who she says she is.”\*



The anonymous text sat on my phone screen, glowing ominously in the dark. \*“Stay away from Emma. She’s not who she says she is.”\* I read it over and over, my mind racing with questions. Who had sent it? Why? And what exactly were they trying to warn me about?



I tried calling the number, but it went straight to voicemail. My heart was pounding as I stared at the blank screen. A part of me wanted to ignore the message, chalk it up to some cruel prank or mistake. But the other part—the part that couldn’t shake the unease I’d felt since that night by her car—knew better. Something was off, and I needed to figure out what.



The next day, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I started by scrolling through Emma’s social media again, this time paying closer attention to the details. Most of her posts were harmless—pictures of her paintings, snapshots of coffee dates with friends, scenic views from her travels. But as I scrolled further back, I found a photo that stopped me in my tracks.



It was from about a year ago, a candid shot of Emma sitting on a park bench, laughing at something off-camera. But it wasn’t the photo that caught my attention—it was the comment section beneath it.



\*“Looking radiant as always, Em!”\* one comment read. But another said: \*“Did he take this? Thought you two were done for good.”\*  

And then there was the reply that sent a chill down my spine: \*“He’s back in her life. Let’s hope it doesn’t end the same way as last time.”\*



What did they mean by “last time”? And who was this “he” they were referring to?



I took a screenshot of the comments and decided to do some more digging. This time, I focused on the man by her car. I didn’t know his name, but I remembered his face. After some creative Googling, I found a local business directory with photos of executives, and there he was: Jonathan Reid, Vice President of a prominent finance firm in the city. His stern expression in the photo matched the man I’d seen that night.



I clicked on his profile and read through his credentials, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Then I noticed a detail that sent my stomach into knots—Jonathan’s last name matched Emma’s. Was he actually her cousin after all? Or was there something deeper going on?



Before jumping to conclusions, I decided to reach out to Sarah again. This time, I didn’t hold back. “Sarah, I need you to be honest with me,” I said over the phone. “Who is Jonathan Reid, and what’s his connection to Emma?”



There was a long pause on the other end of the line before she finally spoke. “Jonathan isn’t her cousin,” she said carefully. “He’s her ex-fiancé.”



The words hit me like a punch to the gut. “Ex-fiancé?” I repeated, trying to make sense of it.  



“Yeah,” Sarah continued. “They were engaged a couple of years ago, but things didn’t end well. Emma doesn’t talk about it much, but I’ve heard bits and pieces. Apparently, he’s… intense. Controlling, even. He didn’t take the breakup well, and he’s been in and out of her life ever since.”



“Why didn’t she tell me any of this?” I asked, my voice laced with frustration.



“She probably didn’t want to scare you off,” Sarah said. “Emma’s a great person, but she has a lot of baggage. I think she’s just trying to move on.”



The pieces were starting to fall into place, but they painted a picture I wasn’t sure I wanted to see. If Jonathan was her ex-fiancé, then why had she lied about him being her cousin? And why was he still hanging around?



That night, I decided to confront Emma. I called her, and she answered on the third ring. Her voice was cheerful, but when I brought up the text and Jonathan, the tone shifted. “Who told you about him?” she asked sharply, her voice suddenly defensive.



“Does it matter?” I shot back. “Why didn’t you tell me he’s your ex-fiancé? Why did you lie to me?”



There was silence on the other end of the line before she finally spoke. “Because it’s complicated,” she said quietly. “I didn’t want to drag you into it.”



“Into what?” I pressed. “Emma, I like you, but I can’t deal with secrets like this. I need to know the truth.”



She sighed, and her voice softened. “Can we talk in person? I’ll explain everything.”



We agreed to meet the next day, and as I hung up the phone, I couldn’t shake the feeling that whatever she was about to tell me would change everything.



The next day, I arrived at the café early, my mind racing with possibilities. What could Emma possibly say to explain everything? Why had she lied about Jonathan? And what was the deal with that anonymous text? As I sat at a corner table, nervously sipping my coffee, I saw her walk in.



Emma looked different—not the confident, radiant person I’d met on our first date. Her shoulders were slouched, her face drawn, and there were dark circles under her eyes, as if she hadn’t slept. She spotted me and offered a weak smile before sitting down.



“Thanks for meeting me,” she said softly, folding her hands on the table. “I owe you an explanation.”



“You think?” I replied, trying to keep my frustration in check. “Emma, I’ve been honest with you from the start. I deserve the same.”



She nodded, looking down at her hands. “You’re right. I’ve been lying, and I’m sorry. I didn’t know how to tell you the truth without scaring you off.”



I leaned forward, my tone firm but gentle. “Just tell me everything.”



Emma took a deep breath and began. “Jonathan isn’t my cousin. He’s… my ex-fiancé. We were together for three years, and at first, everything was perfect. He was charming, successful, and he made me feel special. But over time, things started to change. He became controlling, jealous—always questioning where I was, who I was with. He’d show up unannounced, go through my phone, and accuse me of cheating if I didn’t answer his calls right away.”



Her voice cracked, and she blinked back tears. “I tried to leave him so many times, but every time I did, he’d find a way to pull me back. He’d apologize, promise to change, and for a while, things would get better. But it never lasted. When I finally ended the engagement, he didn’t take it well. He started showing up at my apartment, my work, even at my friends’ places. It was like he couldn’t accept that it was over.”



I listened in stunned silence as she continued. “I moved to a new city to get away from him, changed my number, and deleted all my social media. For a while, it worked. But a few months ago, he found me again. He said he just wanted to talk, to apologize, but it’s been the same cycle all over again. I’ve been trying to keep him at arm’s length, but he doesn’t make it easy.”



Her confession left me reeling. “Why didn’t you tell me this from the start?” I asked. “Why lie about him being your cousin?”



Emma looked at me, her eyes filled with regret. “Because I didn’t want you to see me as broken or damaged. I wanted to start fresh, to have something normal for once. But Jonathan… he’s like a shadow I can’t escape.”



I took a moment to process everything. “What about the text? The one that warned me to stay away from you—was that from him?”



She shook her head. “I don’t think so. Jonathan’s never been subtle. If he wanted to scare you off, he’d confront you directly. The text… I think it might be from someone who knows about him. Maybe a friend who’s worried about me.”



The weight of her words sank in. Emma wasn’t just dealing with a complicated past—she was still living it. And as much as I liked her, I couldn’t ignore the red flags.



“You need to go to the police,” I said firmly. “Jonathan’s behavior isn’t just controlling—it’s dangerous. He’s stalking you.”



Emma looked away, her expression conflicted. “I’ve thought about it, but he’s smart. He knows how to stay just on the edge of the law. Every time I’ve tried to get help, he twists the situation to make me look like the crazy one.”



“Then you need to talk to someone who can help,” I insisted. “A lawyer, a support group—someone who can guide you through this.”



She nodded slowly, tears streaming down her face. “You’re right. I just… I didn’t want to drag you into this.”



I reached across the table and took her hand. “Emma, I care about you. But you need to take control of this situation. For your own safety.”



We sat there in silence for a moment, the weight of everything hanging between us. As much as I wanted to be there for her, I realized this was something she needed to face on her own.



In the days following our conversation, I couldn’t stop thinking about Emma. Her story haunted me—the fear in her voice, the regret in her eyes, the weight of her situation. As much as I cared about her, I knew there was only so much I could do. This was a battle she had to fight herself.



Two weeks later, I received a text from Emma. It was brief but filled with gratitude: \*“Thank you for everything. I’m taking your advice. I’ve contacted a lawyer and filed a restraining order. It’s not easy, but I’m finally starting to take control of my life.”\*  



Relief washed over me, knowing she was taking steps to protect herself. I replied, letting her know I was proud of her and that I’d always be rooting for her, even if we were no longer in each other’s lives.



Months passed, and I heard updates about Emma through Sarah. She’d moved to another city, started therapy, and was focusing on her career and art. Jonathan was still a looming presence, but the restraining order had forced him to keep his distance—for now. Sarah told me Emma had begun rebuilding her life, piece by piece, and while it wasn’t easy, she was finally finding peace.



As for me, the experience left a lasting impression. I’d walked into that first date expecting a simple, lighthearted connection, but I walked away with a deeper understanding of the complexities people carry with them. Emma wasn’t just the charming, radiant person I’d met on that rooftop restaurant—she was someone who had been through hell and was still fighting her way back.



It taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes, love isn’t enough to fix someone’s past. And sometimes, the kindest thing you can do for someone you care about is to step back and let them find their own way forward.



Even now, I think about Emma from time to time. I hope she’s happy, that she’s safe, and that she’s finally free of the shadows that once held her back. And while our story didn’t have the fairytale ending I’d hoped for, I’m grateful for the role I played in helping her take the first steps toward a brighter future.",1,1737126387.0,stories,0,1.0,False

# Timeline:

* **1989: Fall of Berlin Wall:**

\+ During German reunification, a large number of East German civil servants, include member of Volkspolizei (German's People Police), were dismissed or resturctured to merge with the West Union.

\+ The unemployment of East Union at the time spiked to over 20% by early 1990s, with law enforcment personel hit praticullary hard with 80% of them were dismissed or rejected due to their tie with old regiem and redundancy in the newly unified system. Toben Katherine, a 35 years-old Volkspolizei police who lost her leg 5 year prior, was among the 80%.

* **1990-1991: Gulf War**

\+ Driven by necessity and the need for employment. Toben and a few of her former colleauges, using their own saving and stolen assets from dissolved East German regiem to established a private security company. The private military company consist only 50 to 300 members, some of which was former Stasi, East German secret police. They called themselve: Geister Bundeswehr, translated as Ghost Army, offering their service to criminal gang, mafia, and even warlord around the world, protecting their assets.

\+ Utilizing the expertise of ex-Stasi member, Geister Bundeswehr quickly gain their reputation as the most effective and unique mercenary group at the time. When most mercenary group forcus on providing direct combat and security, Gesiter specializied in espisionage, infiltration and provide ""sleeper-agent"" kind-of operatives for just a ""resonable prices"".

* **Early 1991-1995: Geister Bundeswehr disbandment:**

\+ It was during operation Desert Storm, the group started to show cracked in their structure with member sold out their own cilent's information to outside forces and resulted them in their defeat or capture. This then led to some member to suspect other and then, some even kill their own member to ensure their mission.

\+By the end of 1994, an rebel base deep within Egypt territory was exposed by a member of Geister and this was the last straw. The group eventually disbanded in 1995 due to the lack of member, operational cohesion and cilents, leaving only Toben and a handful of member was the last to leave. Toben then mirgrated to America and this is when she met Antonia Ingrid.

* **2000-Late 2011: Pre-Phantom Forces**

\+ After migrating to the U.S, Toben sought refudge in the home of Antonia Ingrid, a retired German solider. The two had their first crossed path during Toben convert operation in Iraq 1991, where Toben, disguised as a tourist while Toben is still a rookie. After sharing their story, they built up a long lasting relationship between them. Later on Antonia offer Toben shelter when she reached out for aid.

\+ Antonia Ingrid, a retired Bundeswehr logistic operator in her 30s, she met Toben through a coffee shop in a NATO controlled area of Iraq during her down time, which later lead to their long friendship over the next few years. In 1998, she was diagnos with Leukemia, which advanced to terminal stage by early 2000. Facing her inevitability of her condition, Antonia chose to leave her military carrer behind, hoping to spend her remaining years in peace. Using her saving, she moved over to America, where she joined a local charity group, dedicate herself to community service and in hope to find a a cure.

\+ Despite her terminal illness, she welcomed Toben into her home, finding solance in their shared German herritage and Law enforcement background. Unbeknownst to Toben's mercenary past, she and Toben share her remaining years under her home and charity work until her eventual passing in July 3rd, 2013.

* **2011-2016: Phantom Forces**

\+  5 years since welcoming Toben into her home, Antonia slowly descend into poverty as her illness getting worser by day while the cost for her treatment was getting more and more expensive. In 2007, during a charity event, Antonia collapsed and was transported to nearby hospital. Ever since then, she was home bound and only occasionally went out for big event.

\+ Seeing her friend suffering and the bills stacking up with no ordinary job can handle, Toben had no other choice to secretly found her own Private Security Force to dealt with her and Antonia finance under the cover of a mysterous benefactor who lend their hand out to help both of them.

\+ Toben done this by reconnecting to the remaining member of Geister who also in America at the time and then made a deal with Mexican drug cartel to be their smuggler and security force along with help immigrant to secretly passed the U.S border. Using her remain saving since Geister's disbandment, she initial founded a group of 15 mercenaries, with her taking the role of stradegist. Due to the finance problem, her mercenaries group encourage their new recruit to bring their own weapon if have. The operation eventually went smoothly and her and Antonia finances began to stablized by 2010.

\+ Toben mercenary group later grew larger, from just 15 member to 150, and then 300, so on and by 2016, it reach 1000 members comes from every corner of the world with the paycheck enough for them to live a decent life while on and after their duty.

\+ On July 3rd, 2013, despite the fortune from her work, Toben could not save Antonia as she eventually passed away alone in her own home. It was not until a day or two later, when she returned from Mexico to see Antinoa lying death on her bed. Antonia body later donated to a cancer research facility, fulfilling her dying wish.

\+ Devastated by the event, Toben spend her time mourning for Antonia death, absence from her mercenaries work for the rest of 2013 and 2014. This resulted the mexican cartel member cut their connection with her mercenaries group and it becomes inactive for another year with no new command being passed down.

\+ Recovered from the event, in 2015, Stylis, a umbrella company, reached out to Toben to makes an offer and aquire her mercenaries group. The deal ended with Toben agreed with one small request: creating a mascot based on Antonia's Fumo, which she called AntI, during her time stuck in her home. Though seeing it a weird request, the executive eventually agreed and the acquisition finalized in 2016 with Toben becomes the leader of her mercenaries group, no longer known as PSF but rather: **PHANTOM FORCE.**

* **2016-2035: Ghost Force  & Operation Black Sand**

\+ In the next few year, with the support from Stylis Corporation, Phantom Force grew one of the largest mercanaries group in the world with the number of member can range from 2.500 to 5.000 members world wide.

\+ It was also during this time, another Egypt base mercenaries group also began to grow in popularity, known as Global Oil Security Task Force, also founded by ex-member of Geister. The origin of GhOST Force is unknown but it was certain that they are financially independence compare to Phantom Force as their mainly profitted from taking commision by oil companies to protect their assets from pirates and prevent it before it even happened by training recruit the same way a Stasi operative was trained among with other neccessary training. Not only they are equally the same as Phantom Force, they also developed their own way of identifying their own allies by using fluroresence paint to create dots on their uniform that is invisible to naked eyes but visible under their prototpye augmented reality optics. The methodologies behind their operation and technology is very well kept and they tried their best to hide it from the public to avoid strong riviary, which they acknowledge is Phantom Force due to their connected history.

\+ 15 years later, as both mercenaries grew in number and reputation, war began to brew with Phantom and Ghost among many other large mercenaries being the main forces for the on-going proxy war around the world. It was also, during this time, Stylis became a defense contractor for the U.S for their cutting edge technology and their own private military group thrive from those technology- Phantom Force. They don't just sold their security service and technology, they also help built structure and logistic around the world. Water dam, Metro System, Highway, Underwater servers, Statellise, Hospital, even Luna base and Space station in collaboration with NASA to help further improve humanity journey into the deep space. Meanwhile, GhOST Force made contracts with a legion of united nation the Middle East to help protected themselve from the on-going threat of war as the resource are getting more scared. This led to GhOST Force to use a old abandoned oil field facility, in the middle of a vast desert within Egypt territory, as their base of operation in the Middle East. Due to its history tied back in operation Desert Storm back in 1991, they give the location of the base the same name. From this very base, they trained their soldier, stock up their weapons, and provide immediate support to all other area as the base located at the connected point of those area.

\+ 2035, war on resource slowly began taking the main stage around the world with mercenaries group being hired by nation around the world to conduct attacks on oil field, with most aimed at the Middle East, this include Desert Storm. However, GhOST Force is a force to reckon with, most mercenaries group had tried and fail but one have yet tried- Phantom Force. This then soon mark their first conflict as they were sent by their cilent help take control over the area. This then mark a operation that was call among member of Phantom Force as **Operation: Black Sand.**

Initial leads stemmed from extensive financial investigations. Through 2 years of analyzing global transaction records, investigators identified an alias, ""The Architect,"" as a potential financier for GhOST Forces.

* In the second week, GhOST Forces adapted guerrilla tactics, leveraging explosive-rigged tunnels beneath the cathedral ruins to ambush Phantom operatives. Low on ammunition and weaponry, GhOST resorted to makeshift traps and suicide bombing to delay Phantom’s advances. Injured GhOST operatives camouflaged themselves with bloodied terrain and vegetation to bypass Phantom's advanced ACIS (Automated Combat Identification Systems), engaging enemies in brutal hand-to-hand combat.
* At 4:00 AM, April 18th, 2039, Phantom successfully breach GhOST's defense, entering the inner sanctum, where Alcames and his remaining fighters made their last stand. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, Alcames reportedly led his troops stalling Phantom’s advance for another 8 hours before being the last GhOST to be shot down by an Phantom's sniper, using BFG 50.
* According to reports and footage from recovered ACIS, Alcames personally engaged Phantom operatives in close combat, wielding a sword and sidearm before he got shot down 30 minutes later.Despite the victory, Phantom Forces failed to capture The Architect, who was seemingly not present during the battle. Though met with skepticism, GhOST Forces reject the allegation in a press confrence on May 4th, disavowed Alcames and his faction, claiming they were rogue elements acting independently. Later on, the U.S. government launched a CIA investigation to verify the claims, leaving the question of GhOST’s broader culpability unresolved.
* **Death Toll:**  GhOST Forces: \~600 Deaths **|** Phantom Forces: 363 Deaths

**Skyfall \[CRANE SITE & MIRAGE PRIME\]**

* **Date:** 28/6/2049- 2060
* **Location:** A abandon crane stie and statelize facility in Nevada.
* **Detail:**  Following Alcames’ death during the collapse of Phantom’s assault on the cathedral ruins, his remaining loyalists fractured from GhOST Force. These renegades, adopting the name ""Reapers,"" embraced a radicalized interpretation of Alcames' ""survival of the fittest"" ideology. Viewing the current world order as corrupt and irredeemable, they sought to usher in a new era through destruction and chaos, believing only the strong would endure to rebuild.
* Using data obtained during Operation Road to Nowhere, the group located a well-protected satellite stabilization facility in Nevada. Built to house command systems for Stylis's own satellites launched post-2025, this facility was critical to global communications, orbital surveillance, and missile guidance systems. By commandeering it, they could deorbit satellites, causing them crashing to each other, and fall back down to Earth, turning them into catastrophic kinetic weapons.
* To ensure the success of the operation, the Reapers devised a diversionary attack on a construction site they had previously lost to Phantom. A large team staged a false attack on the site and planted fabricated intelligence suggesting the location held critical information due to its historical significance. Meanwhile, a smaller team of six infiltrated the facility, taking its personnel hostage while Phantom forces were distracted by the engagement at the Crane Site.
* The operation took effect on June 28th, 2049, when the Reapers' strike team successfully seized control of the facility and executed their plan. Satellites in orbit began to fall to Earth in random patterns, but two specific areas were deliberately targeted: the Crane Site and the facility itself. This caused massive destruction at both locations, eradicating both the Reapers and Phantom operatives in the area.
* With all remaining members of the Reapers dead, the faction ceased to exist. However, their final act plunged the world into chaos, paving the way for a global conflict. Nations blamed one another for the disaster, with accusations of complicity and negligence spreading rapidly. As alliances fractured and mistrust deepened, proxy wars erupted, with mercenary groups such as Phantom and GhOST taking center stage alongside conventional militaries.
* **Damage report:**
* **Initial death count:** 2 - 5 million
* **Secondary death count:** 50-100 million within the first year. Cause of death are due to dirrupted food supply, led to massive farmine while Healthcare system broke down and overrun.
* **Satellites:**  60+ Low-orbit Satellites. 20 were burned up during re-entry and 5 more were shot down by fighter jet, 35 satellites still crash landed down on major city around the world, these include include: Beijing, Hongkong, Washinton D.C, Vegas, Dubai, Kaohsiung, etc...while remain fragmentations still fall into multiple resisdental area, further increase the initial death toll. **|** The remain fragments of the satellite in space further causing damage to still-operational satellites that are orbiting within 1000 kilometer range. This, in turn, resulted for both ACEA and GWR to initiate their own version of space cleaning program over the following years, boosting the development of space travel following the on-going operation Deep Space.
* **Economy damage:** With the satellite destruction, costing around 1-2 trillion dollars, communication, navigation become crippled, follow by global supply chains. Financial markets collapsed, wiping out trillions in stock value, and currency instability increased. Oil prices skyrocketed, and the world sufferresource shortages, especially rare earth metals, lead to a new resource war. **|** Unemployment soared globally, with poverty levels rising drastically. Global GDP shrink by 10-20%, and it was expected that recovery would take years, as protectionism rises and economic power shifts toward nations that can quickly rebuild, such as China and the U.S. In total, the economic cost exceed 30-40 trillion dollars, creating a prolonged period of instability.
* **Political climate:** Not long after the callastophic event, 13 nations around the globe dissolved and aborbed to neighboor nation, while the rest of the world suffer greatly and depended on the 2 largest first world countries that is China and the U.S. **|** Through the analysis of the satellite fragments, it was confirmed that the debris originated from U.S. satellites. This revelation intensified suspicions and mistrust among nations, exacerbating existing geopolitical tensions and ultimately leading to a division between the East and the West, marking the onset of the Second Cold War. **|** In response to the catastrophic event and the need for recovery, China, Russia, Japan, South Korea, and ASEAN nations united to form the Asian Coalition for Economic Advancement (ACEA). This coalition aimed to pool resources, rebuild infrastructure, and stabilize the economies of its member states. | Simultaneously, the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union members established the Global Western Recovery Alliance (GWR) to address their own recovery efforts, focusing on restoring global trade, communication networks, and defense capabilities. **|** Response to the global catastrophe, the United Nations initially stepped in as a neutral arbiter, deploying peacekeepers and coordinating humanitarian aid to stabilize affected regions. It launched initiatives like the Global Space Cleanup and proposed an International Satellite Treaty to address orbital debris and regulate space technology. However, as the Second Cold War deepened, the UN’s influence waned due to funding cuts, political paralysis, and accusations of bias from both ACEA and GWR. While its early relief efforts saved countless lives, the organization struggled to mediate between the two blocs, ultimately becoming sidelined as nations aligned with either ACEA or GWR, leaving the UN a diminished force in global politics.

# Technology and Terminologies (Unfinish):

This section of the world building is made with the intension to explain gameplay mechanics into lore. Majority of it are subtle hint to explain why those mechanics the way it is with the main one is what known as ACIS or Active Combat Inteligent System: A augmented reality system that is used by both GhOST Force and Phantom Force mercenaries to help them gain advantages agaisnt their enemies by having all combat information being displayed right in front of their eyes. These information include:

* Radar: The information fed from the cloaked unmanned aircraft fly overhead and relay all information from it down to the operative bellow with pin point accuracy if the sound is loud enough, such a gunshot. However, due to the distance between it and the ground, it can not exactly accurately detect any sound that less then 150 dB and lower than 90 dB will completely invisible to the drone.
* Friendlies identification: Every mercenaries of both side is equip with a dog tag that can help them transmit signal to each other. These signal when relay will be caught by the system, it will translate and mark them as the color to identified as their allies. On top of that, GhOST and Phantom had their own way to get this feature to work. For long term contract, the mercenaries shift their use of dog tag to tracking chip instead.
* Scotopic Vision/ Night Vision: The optical device both side wear share the same feature as it simply don't just apply the enviroment ambient light source but also scan the area ahead to rendered it into a somewhat ""simulated enviroment"" or its own ""virtual reality enviroment"" as the opertor move within it in real time. However, due to the limitation of process power, the device only render the surface of the area flat and early version of it have latency as the enviroment do not accurately translated in real time. As the system being improve, most of the issue and renered enviroment is accurately translated but one thing stay the same as friendlies, and enemies, is rendered in a blocky shape. It was proposed to render their looks into actual humanoid look but it was dismissed as the blokcy shape look was found to be helping reduce friendly fired among the soldier as it is much easier to see and avoid. However, it also makes shoot at the enemies becomes harder as the blocky shape is not accurately depict their actual look and this led to missed shot.

Despite sharing the same function, both GhOST and Phantom had their own design for the system:

* **For GhOST Force:** They used the same method that they have been used ever since their foundation by using their own developed fluoresence paint to mark dots on their uniform. These dot are invisible to naked eyes and standard cameras sensor without the correct setting. Under the right optical device, these dots is visible as orange dot. Utiliizing these fluoresence dots on their uniform, the system was able to track their movement and rendering them in the enviroment. Their optics design with 3 main parts: The processor mounted the front of the helmet conntected to the goggle, the goggle is fixed to the processor and is hanging down for the operator to see, lastly is the headphone that is also connected to the processor to muffle allies footstep based on the signal they transmit. They also equip with a morse code typer mouthguard that work by tapping their together with the typer in between, the right is for text, and the left is for space. When the message is ready, they pressed on the button that is expose outside their mouth and it will sent message and send it to allies.
* **For Phantom Force:** Their armor is dyed with a similar fluoresence chemical but it is still visble to naked eyes under the right light condition and could be seen as dark blue. However, on their optical deivce, the color of the armor is visible as Bright Teal-ish blue.The optical is intergated to their ballistic mask connected to the processor at the back of the helmet, passing through their headphone that double with identified allies footstep based on the signal they transmit, sharing the same feature as GhOST. The ballistic mask is also intergrated with the sensitive microphone that help them transmit text message to their allies over long distance.

Not only that, Deployment & Battle tactics are also there to explain spawn mechanics:

Both GhOST Force and Phantom Forces is founded by ex-member its predecesor group known as Geister Bundeswehr with training emphasize of episionage and shadow war than direct combat against actual militaries force, later with added modificaiton to fit with more conventional and advance warfare of the time. However, there are some key point:

1. **Secrecy**: Majority of the tactics of both Phantom and GhOST are thrive upon the element of surprice, and from it they can destroy the enemies before they respond with counter attack and force them surrender. This in turn makes most fight between Phantom, GhOST against other military group are often ended up the mercenaries group emerged victorious. They done with by having ""sleeper agent"" kind-of operator operate within the enemies group and territory, smuggling information outside and their own equipment and allies into the area of operation. Once they are ready, they will be activated and help assit their allies to destroy the enemies from inside and out.
2. **False Flag:** As per the previous key point mentioned, the group can also perform a false flag operation where they will dorn and use a chosen nation or group equipments to inflict damage to another group that was an allies to them. This tactics help divide the enemies force and making them easier to take down one by one.
3. **Non-standardization:** Outside their equipment, which was advised to carry with them, both mercenaries do not have any standardization in term of tactics noir weaponry as it help provide a more flexiable tactics and help both side avoid drawing attention to their public organization identity.

# Other information:

The origin of this project can dated back to late-2023 with these post that have me receive and respond to in-game related question by players of the game via explaination and theories:  
[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhantomForces/comments/1822lbm/phantom_forces_lack_lore_and_world_building_but/) | [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhantomForces/comments/18i3yz2/the_game_dont_have_lore_or_world_building_ask_me/) | [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhantomForces/comments/192lam5/phantom_forces_lore_discussion_world_building/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) | [Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhantomForces/comments/1e7kita/phantom_forces_lack_lore_and_world_building_but/)

Later on, it was then the idea of a story covering those explaination and player belief becomes this project with Hermes as the narriator and my own self-insert to explain how the game being the way it is.

# Finale:

In conclusion, I...honestly still don't know what to say, a bit sad to let go, a bit joy, perhasp to see how far I gone, but in the end, the feeling just empty when I have to abandone it in fear of supporting the evil deeds that the developer have done.

> It was a futile effort. Starving this situation of oxygen was going to work for only so long, and the issues that caused the relationship to disintegrate remain. Butler still wants to be traded. The Heat haven't found a trade they like for him.

> Teammates, coaches and staffers have already grown weary, sources said.

> While Heat sources say they expect Butler to return Friday against the Nuggets and are fully prepared for him to play, there remains a palpable dread at what he might do and the environment the ongoing chaos might create. ""I don't know how he can come back to this locker room,"" one source close to the team said. Said another, ""We don't want him back.""

> If history -- like, say, in Minnesota in 2018 -- serves as precedent, the discomfort could deepen, quickly.

> ""Jimmy hasn't even really started,"" said one source close to Butler.

> Spoelstra knew all of that as he politely declined to discuss Butler's situation. Of course he knew. Everyone on the team knew how much was still unresolved and how much uglier this could get.

#Extra Jimmy Butler Drama:

> That meant letting Butler, who was 30 at the time, color outside the lines that had long defined ""Heat Culture."" They hired his trainer, Armando Rivas, onto the staff -- a common practice for other superstars on other teams but not for the Heat. He skipped team Christmas parties and trolled the NBA media with eclectic hair styles at media days. He was allowed to fly privately or stay at a different location than the team on road trips. During the 2023 Finals, sources said, he stayed some 30 miles away at a mansion in Boulder, Colorado, while the team stayed in downtown Denver.

> ""We let Jimmy do more than we ever let LeBron or DWade or Zo do,"" one team source said.

> The disconnect [after seemingly handing the team over to Bam Adebayo] only grew. On the court, Butler began to believe that the Heat were prioritizing Adebayo and Herro over him, sources close to Butler said. They were the hub of the offense, and he was just supposed to run down to the corner and be ready to drive or shoot a 3-pointer.

> ""If they're doing this transition to Bam and Tyler, Jimmy's like, 'Fine, do your transition,'"" a source close to Butler said. ""If [he's] going to be the second or third wheel, [he'll] be that in Phoenix to Kevin Durant and Devin Booker.""

> Some team officials began to regard Butler as somewhat AWOL, sources said. Butler's side contends he was communicating his status through his agent, Bernie Lee, and training staff.

> Three days later, while the team was on the road in Houston and he was officially listed as ""reconditioning,"" he posted a video of himself playing dominoes in the team locker room with Lee.

> Each post was seen by team officials as an affront, an attempt to make the situation more uncomfortable, sources said.

> Butler, sources close to him said, was furious at the length of the suspension and the potential $2.3 million in lost salary (the National Basketball Players Association has filed a grievance).

> While Spoelstra and the rest of the team were in Utah, trying to avenge an embarrassing 36-point loss at home to the tanking Jazz, Riley and Butler met to discuss the Heat's intentions with the suspension and fine, sources said. Butler strongly reiterated his trade request, as ESPN's Shams Charania reported.

My wife bought me a Bialetti Venus Moka Pot for my Birthday at the beginning of the month, and I'm hooked. I've never brewed proper coffee prior to this, but apart from thoroughly enjoying the coffee I get from my Moka Pot, I'm loving the process/ritual of it almost as much.

At the moment I'm limited to pre-ground coffee as I don't not own a grinder, but would like to start buying/trying whole beans. I've only tried 3 types so far; a dark roast from Bialetti, which wasn't great to be honest, but after my YT habit has been constantly interrupted by a coffee advert from a UK company - Exhale Coffee, they were ingrained on my consciousness, so tried their 2 coffees (they have 3, but the one I haven't tried us a decaff 🙃 so gave that one a miss).

Exhale grind to order and send it 24 hr delivery, and I've enjoyed their coffee so far. 

Anyway, as mentioned I'm keen to explore new coffees and to start grinding my own beans, but really don't know where to start; what type of grinder, how much to invest in one, hand or electric driven? Additionally, is it worth grinding my own, or just stick with pre-ground from ground-to- order companies?

I'm in the UK for context

We’ve been in the trenches for what feels like forever with behaviors. We got the diagnosis a few months ago. We’ve tried medication but the crash made it not worth it. We’re on a waiting list for behavioral therapy however the wait is long. Rural area with not a lot of options, so it happens. She’s also not in school yet either (birthday falls after the cutoff) so we’re lacking those resources as well. 

We’ve tried implementing a reward system before but it didn’t stick. Partially from her lack of interest and partially from my lack of execution. We’re wanting to implement it again. However every single time I sit down to try and think of different rewards it’s like my brain turns off. 

What helped you as a child or helps your children? I figured a sticker chart, it’s a good visual for her and then of course being able to place her stickers would also be a plus for her. But what rewards do I implement? A daily reward or weekly reward? This is where I draw a blank the most. I was thinking weekly; at the end of the week we go get a hot chocolate from the coffee place, a happy meal, or a trip to the dollar store to pick out something she wants. However, I know immediate response is the most helpful. So is daily sticker placement and a reward at the end of the week enough? Should I get a little treasure box with a bunch of little tiny toys to let her pick from every night and make it daily reward instead? Help 😅

1i3i35k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1i3i35k/a_friendship_ruined_by_i_still_dont_know/,A friendship ruined by… I still don't know.,"First, Charlotte, thank you so much for creating this community. This is my second post, and I'm utterly grateful for the comments in the first one. Since the tips some people gave me, my relationship with my mum has improved. 

Second, I'm from Mexico, and my English is a rare mix of American, British, and sometimes Canadian, so I'm sorry about that. Also, all names have been changed, so don't worry. 

This is a long one since I have to give A LOT of context, because, like I said, I still don't know what happened. And I'm not interested in digging too much into the other person, so I doubt there will be an actualization, sorry for that. 

So, I started university during the pandemic, and I'm not a social person, so it tends to take me two or three years to really feel a connection with people. But that's because I suffered from bullying and betrayals during elementary and high school, a lot of people just talked to me so I could do their homework and projects. I don't like to put myself on a pedestal, I suffer a lot of self-esteem problems, but I can admit that I have been a really hard-working girl since the beginning of my life. I don't like to half-ass my work, and I'm very passionate about my grades, so if I feel even a bit of laziness or something not being perfect, I will ask the person the permission to complete whatever they had done. None told me no, so everyone knew I would finish anything if they didn't want to. 

This meant that a lot of my “friendships” were false, and my school was one of high pressure, so I left that moment of my life with a heavy amount of depression and anxiety, not only in the academic setting but also in how to treat other people. 

Fast-forward to my new adventures in university, I knew none of the people who were introducing themselves during the session on Google Meet, so I leaned back a lot for my first semester, just recognizing two people that I worked a lot because of the order in the list. One of them was Stephanie (24 F), the one this story is about. 

We became good friends in our second semester, and I bonded with her. Of course, I made other connections with Gabriela (23 F), Esther (21 F) and Lola (21 F). It was us against the world and school, or that was until the fourth semester hit us like a brick. 

Steph and Gabriela had a big argument because of a project that the five of us were participating in. I won't dwell too much on the details, but let's just say that Gabriela and Steph were never on good speaking terms again. Esther, Lola and I (22 F) tried to avoid all the drama, but it felt, especially because I liked both of them, but by that moment, Steph was really becoming one of my best friends. Despite that, if you want my opinion, both of them were at fault, Gabriela was too demanding of her preferences and Steph took it too personally for what it was. 

Then, the fifth semester came, and I was separated from Steph, leaving me with just Gabriela and her with Esther and Lola. Let's just say I didn't take the news well. I didn't mention it before, but I have autism, and abrupt changes don't sit well with me, especially if I don't have a secure space, and after the fight, I felt like the universe was mocking me and making me choose a side. Foolish, I know now, but at that moment I felt uncomfortable talking to Gabriela, but I wasn't close to anyone else, so I stuck to her like a bee to a flower. 

That semester gave us all PTSD, even remembering it makes me shiver. Not only did we have eleven classes, but two teachers decided to take a seat back and make us give their topics. Not even once did they give a lecture. We had to work in teams to talk about a certain topic or book (I'm studying Creative Writing and Literature) almost every week, and that's without saying all the other lectures we had to do for the other classes. Sorry if this gets a little graphic, but I got so sick that the skin around my mouth, eyes, and neck started to dry and flakes of it were constantly falling with the lightest of touch. My doctor told me that I had atopic dermatitis and my stress was making it worse, there were days I couldn't open my mouth without bleeding, so eating was hard. I was sent to a psychiatrist, and she sent a note to my school asking that if any changes were to be made they should allow me to at least one of my friends to feel some security. My school is not the best when mental health is the topic (two of my friends ended up in a psychology ward after that semester, don't worry, they are ok now), and ignored me, but I did tell the director that if it was possible I would prefer to be in a group with Steph. 

But, on the good side, Gabriela and I started to bond, after all the trauma and projects that we had to make all by ourselves, I was truly happy to see her again in my group for the sixth semester, the only problem was that Steph, Esther, and Lola were also there. The five of us, together again…yay!

I didn't say this, but Esther took Gabriela's side during the conflict, and she also had a fight with Steph during the fifth semester because of another project, so that was that, a red flag that I didn't notice at the time. But, thanking the universe, that semester was pretty fun. We had to plan a whole play for one class and I ended up as the “costume designer”, Gabriela and Lola were the directors, although Gabriela had to take a role since one of our classmates didn't put in the effort, and Esther and Steph were also acting. During the first rehearsals, there was a lot of tension between Gabriela and Steph, but both of them worked through that, and even if they weren't in a “friend” space, they could talk with a lot more ease than before. 

But, in my perspective, that was the semester that all hell broke loose between Steph and me. 

During an exposition, in which Lola, Steph and I were in the same group, a classmate of ours said some things that almost made us look stupid in front of the professor. It felt like a boycott, but I managed to pull us out of it before our grades were affected. The three of us had a scholarship, so anything could put it at risk. 

Saying that Steph was mad is an understatement, she was beyond pissed, but knowing that his actions wouldn't impact us or our grades, I didn't pay it as much attention. I told her that it wasn't a big deal and that she should let it be. In my eyes, he just showed the whole group that he was arrogant and believed to be better than everyone else, so the damage to his reputation was done and we didn't suffer any consequences. This is what I believed to be our first crack in the relationship. 

A few weeks later, the poster of our play was published on the school's social media, but they didn't give us credit for the poster, and the title of the play was wrong (which is a crime in itself, we are the department of literature and the direction didn't know one of the most important plays of Federico García Lorca, one of the most important writers of Spain), and they also had the audacity to put their watermark in the work of Taylor (22 F). Because of all of my other problems with the director, I was truly pissed at that, and while walking with Taylor, Steph and Lola on the back, I was venting all my anger with her, especially because the school stole her work. 

I think I wasn't supposed to hear this, but Steph whispered to Lola, “She's angry about this, but not for our project.” I mean, of course I was angry at this, since plagiarism is something the school takes extremely serious with the students, but apparently, the rules didn't apply to them. Also, I'm an artist, and plagiarism is something I loathe with all my heart. I may not write something original in this time and age, but I know to give credit where is due. And, again, I already had my feud against the director, so this was just fuel to my anger. 

Although I didn't say anything about that comment, I started to notice that Steph would stop talking with Lola when I was approaching, and I know the stereotype that autistic people can't understand social cues, and while it may be true for some instances, I knew damm well what that meant. Again, I was bullied, I know when people are talking behind my back and they don't want me to know. 

At the time, I thought that I was making up scenarios in my head, maybe I was being a little paranoid. I should've listened to my suspicions right away, but I wanted to be sure. 

Something I must admit, after all the debacle of elementary and high school, I became desensitized to losing people. I can stop talking to one person out of the blue and not feel anything. My psychiatrist told me it was a coping mechanism, if I don't attach myself too much to someone, then their betrayal won't hurt me as much, so I tend to sabotage any deep relationship. I have been working on it, keeping in touch with people I love, even if the voices tell me to ghost them. Because of that, I made one final test to see if Steph was talking about me. 

At the end of the semester (6º), the teachers give us our final grades and ask us to sign them, so we basically just go to see a paper a go back to our houses. We all hate it, so the majority of the time we stay to talk or just make a run to our beds, especially the ones that live two hours away from the school. Steph and Lola are one of those people, so they always go as soon as they can. The three of us were talking at a table when another of our classmates, a red flag if you ask me, Tony (22 M), joined. Everything was cool, and since I was the last to be called, I knew that it would give them time to start talking about me, knowing for a fact that Steph would. I may not be as sharp as others, but I like to study the people that are around me to give them better gifts, so I know the modus operandi of Steph when she is angry with someone. My plan consisted of telling them to go home as soon as I got out of the classroom and continue the talk while we were on the subway, but if they decided to stay…well, I knew they wanted to keep talking without me. 

Before everyone talks badly about Lola, since my friendship with her continues to this day, she has always been neutral, she doesn't like to participate in conflicts and prefers to stay away from them. She will listen, but she won't do what you want her to do. She is super supportive of me and has apologized for what I'm about to tell you.

When I got out, I saw Tony tap Steph on the shoulder (Red flag number one), and all of them stopped talking as soon as I approached the table. I made it seem that I didn't notice a thing and asked them if they wanted to go now, I even proposed to them if they wanted to go to my home since I baked a cake as a little celebration for ending the semester on such a high note. Steph, without missing a beat, denied the invite, telling me that she and Lola had already made plans to buy some things. Not only did I knew that was bullshit since Lola had told me she had been having some financial problems and wanted to save as much money as she could, but I also confirmed my suspicions, Steph was talking about me in a negative light. 

The amount of control I had to have to make it from the school to my house, alone, without shedding a tear was enormous. I had a breakdown, because, for the first time in a long time I saw in Steph a relationship that could last years to come. 

I believed that this was my first real friendship. And to have that bubble popped in such a way...the hurt that I felt in that moment is really difficult to put into words. I was prepared for it, but the confirmation truly brought a lot of dark thoughts that I used to have when I was a child. The perception of not being enough or good, just someone that people will need, but never someone that could be loved. Thanks to the gods for my mum and dad, they saw all the signs of my going into a deep depression and helped me recover before the next semester. 

And you may be thinking, ""Didn't you just tell us that you didn't feel when people left your life? So where all of this is coming from?"" And yes, I'm still pretty much like that, but this just aligned with the moment I decided to heal from this trauma, so this made me go several steps back. 

Against all the logic that can hold this world, I decided to go to her birthday party with a gift and a cake. This was during vacation and, take this into account, but we hadn't talked at all until she invited me and Lola, the only two people that would talk to her, (yes, I see now that this a big red flag). Everything went ok and, for a moment, I thought that everything was resolved. In my mind, I made a justification for her actions and blamed everything on me, so I was just happy that all was left behind. 

Oh girl, was I delusional. 

In this last semester, the seventh, she and I sat together in every class, at the back of the classroom at her request. Keep this in mind, is important for later. We formed the usual teams, she, Lola and I, but at times I felt her a little bit more snappy towards me, and here is where the confusion begins. I have no idea what happened, but out of the blue, she started to sit with other people, leaving me alone. There was no explanation, nothing. 

And why is this so important? Well, I use glasses, but my eyes are so bad that the glass where the prescription is always thicker than the frame. In shorter terms, I don't see shit from back there. Usually, I prefer to sit in the front, it makes my life easier, and Steph knows that, but she insisted on going to the last row. I accepted and now I was tucked there, alone and battling with headaches for forcing my eyes to catch everything that was on the board. The worst of all? She just wanted to sleep during classes, that's why she wanted the last seats, and she would get annoyed that I raised my hand to say something, since it brought attention to her and highlighted that she didn't participate during the classes. Taylor, the light of my days, decided to switch seats and went to sit with me in the classes we shared, taking photos of everything and sending them to me so I could see everything.

The drop that overflowed the glass was the day she shouted at me because I ""couldn't decide what my topic for the exposition would be"". I won't even detail what this fight was about, it's so stupid, but she said that she was angry because I was the one that ABANDONED her for Gabriela, Esther and Taylor, which, not true, but ok. 

At that moment I felt something broke, as cliche as that is, and all her faces, displants and petty acts just stopped to make me feel something. Even tho I want to change and learn to form lasting relationships, I knew that I wouldn't permit her to last more than the rest of the semester. 

For context, I hadn't talked about this with anyone from school, and even if a lot of people asked me what the deal was, I wanted to respect her and let this problem between the two of us, resolve it and become stronger than before. But I was tired from keeping all inside and decided to confine myself to my friends, that was the moment that Lola apologized and confessed to me that Steph was talking to everyone who would hear her about what was happening between the two of us. 

I felt so disgusted, but at the same time, my petty soul awoke. I forgot to say this, but I'm actually well-liked in my generation, I may not talk to everyone, but I have never been in problems with anyone, and, more importantly, I like to help people. I send my notes and study guides to the whole group without asking for anything in return. 

My study guides are decorated with memes and acronyms that I make knowing what can help my classmates, I tend to be so preoccupied that people don't understand the way I make my notes that I use Canva to organize all the information in a more friendly way. A lot of people have tried to thank me by buying me coffee or sweets, but I always decline. I do like to help them with these little acts, and, in my eyes, it's a win-win situation. I get to read all of what I've written again and summarise it into an easy format with jokes that help me remember everything for my exam and they get the result, win-win.

My mum told me that one of the reasons that she, Steph, was so salty about all of this and tried to undermine my character to everyone, was because she was jealous. Again, I have self-esteem issues, but I'm not dumb, I know what my weaknesses and abilities rely on, and I've come to realize that Steph would only compliment Lola, whose strengths are similar to her, but she never said something about me. My mum made a list of all the things that she may be jealous of, and it made me realize some things.

1. She is good with creative writing, I have always told her that, but I'm too, and not only that, but academic writing, like essays and investigations, is like child's play to me. She has always talked badly about academic assignments. 
2. I've never had any conflict with anyone, to which she seems to gravitate to. 
3. I have always something to say in any class, even if it's not my area of expertise. I tend to have an arsenal of fun facts in my brain, and since she asks everything to ChatGPT, then her knowledge depends on an AI, which is not great when the teacher asks you YOUR opinion of a book that you were supposed to read but didn't for ""x"" or ""y"" reason.
4. I'm the favourite of all the teachers, even the most feared one. He says hi to me as soon as he sees me, asking me about my day and studies, while he tends to ignore others.

I'm now three days before entering my new, and last, semester, and thanks to the help of my family and friends I decided to cut all ties with her. I don't want another semester of feeling like an abandoned kitten whose only purpose is to wait, I have bigger problems and, honestly, it's her loss. 

I may never know what caused all of this, but my conscious is serene, so I don't feel like searching for an answer that will make me the villain of a story I wasn't even aware I was part of. 

Sorry if this was pretty long, but I really needed to take this out of my chest and give as much context as possible. At the end of the day, it's a shame that she caused all of this chaos, a lot of people from our generation told me that they didn't believe her, which makes me feel better, but now she might be lonely for the rest of her university, and a little part of me feels partially guilty for it. 

At the end of the day, I hope she learns from this, like I did, and change her destructive actions.

I (37F) have always said I don't want kids. I stand by this now. I don't have that ""ticking"" people talk about - there are kids in my family who I love wholeheartedly, but I am pleased to hand back after a few hours. I have a range of neurodiversity so the noise, mess and unpredictability of them is simply not for me. I love my quiet, orderly life.

I've always found the process of pregnancy amazing and kind of magical - the idea of growing a human inside yourself - the millions of chemical processes that take place to form this perfect little thing...remarkable. But the process of it coming out, regarless of method, horrifies and terrifies me to my core.

My mum (63F) for as long as I can remember, has never said a single positive thing about having children. Every birthday since I can recall and at any other opportunity, she's given graphic descriptions of labour, the howling pain, the hours and days of struggle, the blood and gore. She'll often use words such as ""ripping"", ""tearing"" - talk about being stitched like a cushion. How she couldn't walk or sit for months. 

When not giving gross anecdotes about labour, it will be about how hard her life was when we were small. My dad worked long hours running a successful business, to earn the money to support the family, but was no support practically or emotionally at home. She laments how relentless her days were managing us (2 girls) and a dog and a household, shopping, cooking, gardening, etc. 

Everything she says is how unhappy and inconvenienced she was by us. Everything she gave up. Opportunities missed. How unappreciated she was (is?). How her body was ruined. How she was so alone and had no help.

Today, having coffee, on one of her fun rants about my father being useless when we were small (something she seems unable to let go) she said ""I didn't enjoy anything about raising small children"" and I said ""I know, you've never once said anything positive about it"" - we both kind of just went silent.

It occoured to me today that my view of parenting has probably been massively skewed by this constant negative narrative being drip fed my whole life. And thay makes me sad. Because what if I didn't have that? If I'd had a positive role model, could I have had a chance to be a good mum? Would I have maybe entertained the idea rather than just shut it down as a ""never"" thing?

Anyway. I'm not really looking for answers, I guess it was just a bit of a revelation for us to both today - to speak out those things into the world for the first time, in such simple terms...",6,1737125566.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

BM doesnt see an issue with it and is wondering why my SO is just now having an issue with it, considering this has been going on since SS was born. my SO has a hard time telling BM what makes him uncomfortable or communicating things because she always pushes it off. this is his son too and we just aren’t too sure what to do in this situation. i told him we could call DCFS, but we dont want to cause an uproar. i just want BM to respect his wishes like we respect hers. we have 25% custody while BM has 75%. we also live in IL.

It was past two in the morning when JTS1 landed on the tarmac of Bozeman Airport with a slight jolt. The aircraft taxied to its private hangar, where the ground crew waited to take over.

The hangar doors were open, and the crew, in JTS jumpsuits, stood at attention. A jacked-up white 4X4, one of Pastor Tony’s Boys fleet, sat askance, light flurries of snow drifting through its headlights.

The door to Taylor’s office opened, and Tim rose to his feet.

“I hope you had a nice flight, sir.”

“Yes, Tim. I was able to do some work and get a couple hours of sleep in. I have a meeting with that truck out there.”

“I’ll see to it, sir,” said Tim.

Taylor went back into his office.

“Hope you get some sleep before the sun’s up,” said a woman’s voice. He turned to see the pilot, Lindsey, standing at the curtain that separated the galley from the passenger cabin.

“If I’m lucky,” he responded.

Holding the curtain in one hand, she said, “You can always crash at my place. I got the room. You should see what I’ve done with the basement.” She bit her bottom lip and caressed the top button on her uniform.

He blushed. “Duty. I need to get Taylor back to the ranch.”

“Well,” she said, a twinkle in her eye, “the offer stands. Good night, Tim.”

He watched her shapely figure descend the stairs. A year ago, Lindsay had purchased the Kleimer Building on Bozeman’s Main Street and began renovating it into her private residence. Her move did not go unnoticed by the local newspaper:

_JTS Employee Buys Historic Building._

A half-hearted protest ensued for an afternoon with wealthy, rather pasty hippies brandishing signs about preserving Montana’s history for everyone. Taylor had dispatched Tim and a few lads, just to piss off the snowflakes in the mayor’s office. By evening, everyone was drinking red wine up the street at the jazz club.

He pulled on his jacket and climbed down to ground level. The crew stood in formation. The frigid wind nipped at their faces.

He stopped at an older man with a mustache that curled at the ends. “Sorry to get you boys out of bed so early,” he said.

“Welcome back, Mr. Boothe. It’s no problem at all.”

“Ben, how long have we known each other?”

The man investigated the night as he counted. “Maybe five years, sir.”

“Call me Tim.”

“Yes, sir, Mr. Tim.”

“Alright. Taylor has a meeting. I’ll let you know when it’s done. Can you get the Air Quad warmed up and set a flight plan for the ranch?”

“Yes, sir.” Ben barked orders to his crew as Tim signaled the imposing truck.

At the bottom of the boarding stairs, he ran his portable metal detector over the two clergymen. When they remained silent, he frisked them. They wore black robes, full beards, and their heads shaved clean. Bizarre crosses of shiny circuit boards hung from their necks. Their muscles bulged full and hard from the steroids and human growth hormones. They were unarmed. He let them climb into the jet where the senator waited.

A lawyer, a man in his late sixties with glasses and perfectly quaffed silver hair, wore an expensive suit. “I have a shoulder holster,” he said, and lifted his arms.

Tim removed the snub Derringer from beneath his left arm and slipped it into his pocket. He then searched him thoroughly, starting at his ankles and moving to his calves, crotch, back, and arms.

“Go on up,” he said.

During his wait, he sat on the sofa and inspected the weapon. It was short and stout with a black grip and smoke-chrome barrel. A cylinder held three .45 caliber rounds, a compact and powerful tool for persuasion or dissuasion, depending on the line of work. Should a lawyer carry a gun? Truth was, lots of people carried guns these days, moms going to yoga, grandmothers at grocery stores. America had never been so locked and loaded and ready for a fight.

When the meeting concluded, he and Taylor sat in the Air Quad as it hovered ten feet off the tarmac. He glanced down to see Ben and his crew hauling cleaning equipment up the aluminum stairs into the jet’s cabin.

“Grid sync successful. Prepare for altitude,” announced the computer.

The craft ascended swiftly, and the JTS hangar fell away. The entire airport shrank to the size of a model with toy airplanes, helicopters, and ground traffic going about its purposeful business.

Beyond the airport were the sprawling suburbs of the greater Bozeman area, the veins of intertwining roads outlined by streetlights, and the main artery of Interstate 90 crawling with ant-sized headlights. From this height, neighborhoods took on a logical pattern of grids, including the floral designs of roundabouts and cul-de-sacs. In the distance, the university town of Bozeman proper was lit up like a raucous frat party.

Then the world around them grew misty, the glass shell covered by moisture, and the ground blurred before it vanished as they lifted through the cloud ceiling. There were a few moments of darkness and then a field of glittering stars. He scanned for the Dippers; Eric had taught him once when they’d gone fishing on public lands and slept out in the summer to fish again in the morning.

Low in the west, the silver shell of a waxing gibbous moon reflected off the surface of the clouds as off an ocean. A meteorite streaked overhead, flashing the clouds with a bright green glow before disappearing.

Taylor reclined in his chair, eyes shut, possibly sleeping.

“Ten thousand feet altitude achieved. Commencing travel,” said the computer. “ETA in sixteen minutes.”

He felt the inertia push him back into his seat as they canted south of Sacajawea Peak. The mountain, cutting through the clouds was crusted in white, reflecting the moon like an ivory breast.

Far in the distance, the red and white flash of another Air Quad blinked in and out. According to the radar, it was stationary. Stargazers smoking a bowl, most likely a date night. If you had money—and many people in Bozeman did—Air Quads made for a good time on a night like this.

He glanced at Taylor. Eyes still closed.

He was having trouble shaking the surreal experience on the bridge. The way his boss had taken the gun and, without hesitation, ended that old woman’s existence. How those lights had faded. What wondrous lights! The bridge had shaken, vibrating through his legs. The masked motorcycle gang tearing by. That boy, running for his life. The thing, the shadow creature, jumping on him, ending him.

It shouldn’t surprise him that his boss was a killer. Hell, he _knew_ he was a killer. JTS killed. They employed people around the world who engaged in all manner of combat. Tim himself had studied the craft of killing and had trained others to kill. Like Taylor, he was a mercenary. They were in the business of death. Killing was the daily bread.

He should forget these things.

It was snowing heavily in the mountains when they landed softly on the Air Quad pad. A small crew of two men and a woman received them.

As was his custom when exhausted, the senator went to his personal elevator without a word of goodnight and vanished into the depths of his mansion.

Tim thanked the crew and took the service lift to the subterranean garage, climbed into one of the SnowTracks, and drove himself without the aid of navigation up the mountain to his cabin, leaving the machine out front to be buried in snow.

At the door, he tore his clothes off and went to his kitchen in the dark to pour a whisky. The spirit burned his throat. He poured another. Then, in the darkness, he took himself to bed and slept. His slumber consisted of a nightmare on the bridge, which he could not shake in the morning when he roused himself. Like the perfume of a skunk, the crime clung to him.

The snow had stopped. The sky was clear and predawn violet, except for high wisps of cirrus clouds.

He did not work for the rest of the week. Before coffee, he skied five miles along the ridge, stopping to watched the sun rise and turn the powder to diamonds. He saw the fresh tracks of the lone grizzly that hunted there in the summer. He knew it to be a large male that preferred not to be seen. A bald eagle soared the updraft of the canyon, flew over him, and piped softly down.

He climbed until he reached the peak, then veered left and dropped down the steep slope, hitting the moguls of rock and bush. The explosions of his impact blasted up glittering powder that he breathed into his lungs like cold smoke. The drops turned into slopes, and then he was in the tree line of the alpine forest on a trail that Taylor’s guests liked to use because it was easy and beautiful.

He emerged from the forest into the compound of the ranch, where the massive multi-tiered mansion was connected by a glass skywalk to the steaming, sulfuric hot tubs and swimming pools. Beyond these, there was a small village of private residences, among which the highest and most secluded one was his… _home_ for the last seven years.

It was a two-level, ultra-modern design with large picture windows on the south side that gave out onto the mountain range and captured both sunset and sunrise. It contained a living room with a television that monopolized an entire wall and a sofa where he often fell asleep watching old movies from his boyhood; a fully stocked kitchen with restaurant-quality equipment where he’d been practicing sushi techniques with an AI sensei; a gym with all the necessities; and the ranch’s signature walk-in steam shower (also with a window-wall), which was where he stood, absorbing the heat, sweating, and watching the sea-blue sky above the dove-white snow.

The nightmare had been of the boys playing with a fiery football on the shores of a strange land, safe in the proximity of family, music, and a wedding. Even those who had fled the ravages of war and the destruction of the environment harbored the desire to build unions, bring bloodlines together, and make babies. It was a messy dream. As dreams do, one of the boys had been him, and the other was Eric. They were running from monsters when the ground turned to mud and their legs to sap.

“God, Eric, I miss you, man,” he spoke into the steam.

Eric, his cousin, used to call him Tadpole. He had practically raised Tim in that government unit on the mean streets of Billings’s Southside, where Asiatown dappled its overflow ghettos into the hood.

Eric had kept him out of the gangs, out of the militias, kept him in school, kept him fed when his mom ran off, kept him off drugs, off Escape. He taught him how to wrestle, how to fight, how to hunt and fish and skin a deer, how to butcher and freeze the meat so there’d be food all year. And how to be good to girls.

“Chivalry is dead, old chap,” he’d say in some fake accent, throwing him the book he’d just finished, saying, “Read that, Tadpole.”

“What’s it about?”

“About a man in a war. Gets laid a lot. It’s about the good guys.”

Eric, who let him watch the scariest of movies because they were just stories, let him watch porn, hid him in the closet the night he brought Kaylee Kobylinski home from prom so he could see the way a guy ought to fuck a girl. He turned her into a moaning, sobbing mess, and by the time they were done, she was begging him not to join the army, to stay and marry her, and she would always be his.

Eric, who was there when they found his mom’s body, told him it was okay to cry. But he didn’t cry. Not for her. Not that night, nor any since.

Eric, who beat the old man when he returned drunk and broke, wanting to take it out on Tim. He beat him so severely that he needed to be carried off in an ambulance. Beat him so bad he never came back.

Eric, who took him to the airport when he deployed. “All my paychecks are going right into the account. That’s for you, Tadpole. Be careful with your money, be good, don’t let anyone fuck with you. You better take States. I know you got it in ya. I’ll be watching.”

Tim hugged him. Buried his face and felt his eyes burning to the smell of Old Spice. Then he stepped back, and they’d saluted, and he didn’t cry.

A paycheck came, then another, then a letter from Eric.

_Hey Tadpole,_

_Gets fucking cold here in the winter. Not as cold as Montana. Different kind of cold. Been in this city for a month now, fighting over the same street for weeks. Don’t know who’s who. FEEN dresses just like the locals. Been keeping warm. Met a girl. Her dad’s a baker, so I get fresh bread now and then. ;) Hope you’re keeping out of trouble. Keep your grades up. Championship is soon. I’ll be watching. I expect to see you there. I expect to see you win. Well, I better go. Love ya._

Then another paycheck. When the paychecks came, he saved all the money except for a few dollars he’d use to get a pizza and Coke and watch one of Eric’s old movies.

Then another letter came, a formal one printed on heavy paper.

_Dear Timothy Boothe:_

_With my deepest regrets and sadness, it is my duty to report that Private First Class Eric C. Boothe was killed in action defending freedom and America on the Eastern Front. As his commanding officer, I would like to send my condolences. Boothe was a great soldier and saved many lives. He fought bravely and valiantly and was a model to his brothers in arms. Sadly, he gave his all when a sniper of the Federation of Eastern European Nations…_

Time passed, and he forgot Eric’s face; even in the dream, it was obscured. It was the face of every boy, a palimpsest of guys he’d known throughout his life, but his soul was there. It was Eric who the monster fell on, and the beast was that FEEN sniper lying in wait.

Tim Boothe was a bodyguard—he’d been one since John Taylor had recruited him in his last month of high school.

He had just defeated the best grappler in Montana and had taken the state title, for what it was worth. It was the last achievement of a young athletic career that would not blossom into a college scholarship—most universities had stopped doing athletics before he was born. Too many politics and lawsuits. He wasn’t university material anyway.

It was his junior year of high school. He was sixteen and dropping out. At the end of the school year, he was set to fly to basic training with the romantic dream of getting into the special force. But he probably would have ended up going to the front and fighting FEEN like Eric and so many other kids in his socio-economic position. With unemployment and prices skyrocketing, the military represented a job and stability.

Everything changed after that last match. He was in the locker room, about ready to strip, his kit hanging off his hips, when the door banged open, and three men in suits barged in, checking all the corners to ensure the room was clear. Then in walked John Taylor, military haircut and perfect posture. Tim remembered him as huge and powerful. He wore black slacks and a black t-shirt that displayed his cut physique. He knew he was _somebody_ back then, but he didn’t know or care exactly who.

The tall man came right up to him and picked up the championship trophy that sat unceremoniously on the bench.

“You destroyed that guy,” Taylor said. Like the man, the voice was imbued with authority and position.

Tim shrugged.

“He was bigger than you. I know for a fact he’s all juiced up. I had a little word with his coach.”

The high school athletic association had stopped testing for steroids two years prior because of funding issues. A lot of kids were pinning and spinning the Escape to get the physical advantage—insanity would come later.

“By all rights, he should have had you, but you finished him, clean and simple. That’s what caught my eye. You move like a dancer.”

“Doesn’t much matter. Wrestling’s out next year. I just want to go home and watch TV.” Tim eyed the three men suspiciously. In their dark AR glasses, they watched without watching, saw without seeing.

Taylor set down the trophy. “What are your plans after high school? College?”

“Nah, basic training.”

“Army?”

“Navy, I want to be a SEAL.”

“From what I saw tonight, you’re going to make it. You want to go see Eastern Europe, huh? Your cousin died over there, right?”

He felt his eyes sting. He knew? Why did he care? Tim shrugged again. Nobody wanted to go there, but that was where they ended up.

The man reached out and felt his bicep, ran his thumb across the dent of his chest, and nodded.

“Let me make a proposal. It would be a real shame to put this body of yours through that hamburger factory. I need good men. Come work for me. I’ll make sure you can buy a house by the time you’re twenty.”

“What work?” He suddenly felt the draft of the room against his exposed skin. He wondered if the bodyguards were filming him. He lifted his kit above his trenches.

“You know John Taylor Security?”

“JTS? Sure. Who doesn’t?”

The men in black with high-tech gear and machine guns who guarded everything from ATM machines to McDonald’s parking lots.

The man grinned wide. “I created JTS. Go to this address at noon tomorrow.” He held out a card. “Not all my guys guard coffee shops. I have an elite unit. There’s money. No drugs, but pussy when you want it—or cock. I can get you whatever you like. No questions. You’ll have better training and better funding than you’ll ever get in the military. That is, if you can make the cut. You think you got it in you?”

The man locked his eyes without blinking. Tim felt his chest grow tight. He was a virgin. He’d never gone to the comfort rooms of the BAT like the other boys.

John Taylor didn’t wait for the answer. He did an about-face and walked out of the room. The men in suits waited for a moment before following him.

Tim was alone, holding the card.

The senator had been a powerful man before Tim went to the address on that card, but he had seen him rise to the very top, and with that tide, he himself had risen in the world of JTS. Not only had he purchased that little place on Flathead Lake, which was well-known and vetted by the JTS intelligence apparatus, but he’d used what he learned in the security industry and built an anonymous safety net off the books: a sailboat docked in the Gulf of Mexico, a floor in a New York high-rise, a majority share in a small but growing chain of milk tea shops in various Asiatowns around the world. The money was all funneled into crypto held in an alias account that was administered by a dark web agent that was only accessible at the utterance of a password—a password only one other person on the face of the planet knew.

He stepped into the hot spray of the shower, soaped, rinsed, and then walked into his living room to dry in the greenhouse effect of the sun blasting through the windows.

“Computer, call Z-dawg.”

“Z-dawg is online. Calling,” said the AI.

Z-dawg was short for Zombie Dawg. Z because, like a zombie, he felt no pain or fear. Dawg because he was dogged and didn’t stop until the job was done.

“Hey, boss, what’s up?” Z-dawg’s face filled the screen. “_And_ you’re naked.”

“You and Scarlet want to hang tonight, drink something strong?” It was a code for _we need to talk now, off the JTS logs._

“Sure, sounds good. I could use a drink. Should I dress up?” _Will I need a gun?_

“No, I’m buying. How about 9 PM at the lounge?” _No gun. But there are things you need to know._

“Be there or be nowhere.” _If I don’t make it, it means I’m dead._",3,1737125130.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

None of their coffees have ever let me down before. Using the James Hoffmann one cup V60 recipe, I have brewed three times, each with an increase in grind size while keeping the brew temp the same around 98. Each cup had absolutely no smell or taste. The third one did have a little bit of sweetness on the back of my tongue, but still no actual flavors.

I thought there might be some thing that I’m doing wrong, so I cuffed it to try and see what I should be getting taste/smell -wise out of the beans. Still nothing whatsoever. I’m new to cupping, but I followed Hoffmann’s video. I did notice that when I went to break the crust, there really wasn’t any thing on top. Just a few grounds floating with a tiny bit of crema, but they were just stuck to the sides at the top. So really nothing to scrape off, as everything had sunk to the bottom already.

I want to start with Sehnas I hope your doing well, I hope your forgetting about me laughing and repairing yourself. I pray you’re not having a hard time like I am.

I know my ex everything has been beating herself up for trusting me, believing in me , for sticking with me all this time. She thinks I was never fully invested or I never meant the words of a future with her. 
Oh but I did
It’s so easy to focus on the bad things the pain and hurt right now over how I had been acting the last couple months, but in my head all I was after was a future with you. I knew I loved you enough to turn everything around and although I had self loathing issues that kept me from treating Her how I truly wanted to, I knew with another shot it would be my life’s work to make sure she is always loved and cared for by me. After I repaired myself.

I get there’s a lot of horrible things I said and questionable ways I acted. But I have one redeeming fact. One that is true that even in you worst thoughts of me can’t deny. There was never ANYTHING more clear than I wanted to be with you and you alone. During our time I. Never batted an eye at the looks or advances of another woman, you were always itand enough. Before you felt you had to prove yourself to me. 

if you ever read this letter I’d like for you to really think about our time together. There was never any hint of me being interested in another woman. I know right now for her to feel better about letting this go and to make it easier for her to move on it’s easier to paint me as a nasty person and for her to believe it wasn’t real to me. I want what’s best for her so that’s fine as untrue as it is, I’ll wear that villain hat for her. 

The ways that I acted after you broke up with me, they were selfish, i heard you but didn’t listen to you when you needed me to step back and be just a friend and not a lover. All of that was driven by me knowing the mistakes i made, and all I was doing was wanting to get us back to be together again so I could show you that I was always going to follow through and love you the ways you’ve dreamed of since being a little girl. Simply put my ears heard what you were asking of me but my brain and my heart wouldn’t.  

someday in the future when she’s healed fully and moved on and happy, I believe something will spark a memory of us and in that moment of remembrance, when she no longer has to think negative of me in every way she can finally let herself see that I loved her a f%ck ton and it was very real to me.

Her negative thoughts of me at this moment of her thinking this wasn’t real for me or that I didn’t love her or I was playing her. There are very few facts and evidence that actually support this. What’s she’s feeling are assumptions based upon certain behaviors that don’t only point to that one direction. It’s also possible I loved you a lot and drove myself mad watching you pull away from me slower and slower. There are a couple times I should have been there and I wasn’t. Depression sucks altho everything in me wanted to be there, I didn’t feel I could face you in those couple times I should have been there. 

I’d like to close this out with facts that support how much I love you care about you, and only wanted you. I’d rather her not read this until she’s finally over it all, Because I don’t want her to believe this now and it be harder on her. 

-your favorite coffee creamer, they don’t sell it down in Florida. I searched and found it for you up here I was so happy I bought it for you. Then we both realized I’d have to mail it and there’s no way it would keep. But when you were up here, and we were moving me down there. I made sure to remind you toilets go to the store and get some. We can put it in the cooler and get down there to you.

-helping with your daughters ear buds. This was one of the many times I would never have an issue going out of my way to help all 3 of you.

-being here for you listening to you and guiding you the best I could when your ex husband was doing shady things and seemed to have an addiction problem. I was on the other side of that phone for hours every night where this was our main subject, I just enjoyed being there for you and helping you

-dancing, singing, kissing you in the nosebleeds in the very back at that limp bizkit concert. In the videos that was 2 people madly in love

-giving you that voucher promising when we get our house/ranch in the future, You hand me the voucher and I’ll go get you your own cow (you’ve always wanted one)

-driving 7 hours round trip to spend 5 hours In Indianapolis with you, I would’ve done it just for a hug and would’ve done it the rest of my life if that’s how it had to be. I was happy singing and excited to do that and be there with you it didn’t matter how long it was never going to be enough.

-the way I always looked at you. All of us have a certain look a certain ways our eyes and pupils react to when we see something we are attracted to and love a lot. That’s what that was, it was natural. 

-every embrace every kiss and every hug had so much love behind it from both of us

-last but not least leaving my hometown, my friends, my family, a job that I was exceeding expectations and setting records. Everything that I would call a safety blanket I gave it all up without a second thought to move to Tampa to be near you so we could finally do this.

There’s so many more, So when you say you’ve lost yourself and you wasted your time on someone who this was never real for. Here’s the evidence it was very real and it was the one thing I loved most, cherished, and valued. 

I can’t tell you this directly because I’m blocked and shut out. I wish I was there in your time of need to remind you with proof how great you are while you battle not knowing how to believe in yourself.

Any time I’ve done anything to hurt you, it hurt me too. Proof? How about how hard I was on myself in every one of those situations? 

I hope these words find you someday. Not right now, Because for your sake I’d rather let you think I’m a terrible human being. So this is easier for you to get over and be happy again. 

But someday I want you to see how much you do truly matter to me. I’m sorry I acted in ways that I won’t be there. And I’m sure I’ll never hear from you again. I hope my words find you and you can value them. ",2,1737124280.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1i3hiup,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10905147/,How Gamification and Theme Days Can Transform Your Workweek,"**TL;DR:** Gamification and theme days are simple yet effective strategies to increase productivity and engagement. Gamification introduces rewards and recognition for task completion, while theme days bring structure and focus by dedicating specific days to particular priorities. Both strategies help create sustainable systems for managing work and achieving goals.  

---

Ever feel like your workdays blur together or that you’re struggling to maintain focus? You’re not alone. One of the challenges many professionals face is managing their energy and priorities effectively, especially when juggling competing demands. Two strategies I often recommend to clients are **gamification** and **theme days**. These approaches may sound simple, but their impact can be profound when implemented thoughtfully. Let’s break them down.  

### What is Gamification?  
Gamification involves incorporating elements of gameplay—like rewards, points, or progress tracking—into your daily work. The goal is to make tasks more engaging by tapping into intrinsic motivations such as achievement, competition, or curiosity.  

For example:  
- **Habit tracking apps**: Tools like Habitica or Todoist allow you to visualize your progress and reward yourself for completing tasks.  
- **Reward systems**: Treat yourself to a coffee break, a walk, or something enjoyable after finishing a challenging project.  
- **Friendly competition**: If you work in a team, consider leaderboards or shared challenges to foster collaboration and motivation.  

Gamification works because it provides immediate feedback and creates a sense of accomplishment, even for small wins. However, it’s essential to design your rewards carefully—something meaningful yet simple enough to avoid becoming a distraction.  

---

### How Theme Days Work  
Theme days dedicate specific days of the week to particular focus areas. This strategy is especially useful for professionals who manage diverse responsibilities, as it reduces decision fatigue and helps maintain clarity.  

Some examples include:  
- **Marketing Mondays**: Focus on outreach, campaigns, or planning for the week ahead.  
- **Deep Work Wednesdays**: Block out time for uninterrupted work on high-priority projects.  
- **Follow-Up Fridays**: Wrap up loose ends, respond to emails, or reflect on the week’s progress.  

The key is consistency. By associating certain days with recurring themes, you’ll streamline your workflow and build a rhythm that makes it easier to stay organized and productive.  

---

### Why These Strategies Work  
Both gamification and theme days align with principles of behavioral psychology and systems thinking. Gamification leverages our natural desire for progress and recognition, while theme days reduce cognitive load by simplifying decision-making. Together, they create a balanced approach to managing work that’s both effective and sustainable.  

These methods are also highly adaptable. Whether you’re a solo entrepreneur, a team leader, or part of a larger organization, you can customize them to fit your specific goals and working style.  

---

### How to Get Started  
1. **Identify your priorities**: What areas of your work could benefit from more focus or engagement?  
2. **Choose one strategy to test**: Start with a single theme day or gamified task.  
3. **Iterate and adapt**: Experiment with different approaches until you find what works best for you.  

---

### Let’s Discuss!  
Have you tried gamification or theme days before? What worked for you—and what didn’t? If this concept is new to you, what aspect are you most excited to try? Let’s share ideas and build on each other’s experiences.  

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

1i3hb37,https://i.redd.it/tt6ackbvbkde1.jpeg,Is this fair pricing ?  ,"Mind you she has 5 bathrooms and a 3 story house !  she found me on care.com and I charge 30$ hourly so she mentioned it should be 150 for 5 hours ,but I haven’t cleaned a house that large and on the phone she was also saying how the bathrooms aren’t really dirty they just need a wipe down . She’s stubborn on the pricing so I think I’m going to just let her go find someone else because I feel like that is to low for what she’s asking",11,1737123447.0,housekeeping,30,0.92,False

I really miss that banterous vibe where you have a laugh and a joke with each other - I'm not too serious so if you're not okay with that -- probably best to stay away!!

Also!-- I am from England but I'm not fussed where you're from as I tend to be around at random hours.

1i3h7vz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i3h7vz,Built a coffee table last night! ,"Got delivered on Tuesday and finally had time to assemble it last night!! It took about 90 mins. The lift top isn’t flush with the other top surface which drives me crazy, but I’m trying to ignore it by putting the mirrored tray over it lol. 

Pretty good for $60! Would love a solid antique at some point, but this will do until I have an income again. ",80,1737123189.0,LivingAlone,11,1.0,False
