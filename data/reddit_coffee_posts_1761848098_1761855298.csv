I am overwhelmed by my hyperempathy with my friendships. I don't enjoy being the SuperFriend, because my well-intentioned actions have caused me a lot of pain. Most people don't reciprocate even the slightest bit. I've lost so many friends by being ""too much"". So I would like to stop. I want to be ""normal"". 

Two examples:

1. A friend told me she lost her job. I know most NT friends would tell her ""That's too bad"" and leave it at that, but I felt so bad for her, I gave her money to help cover her rent and have spent a few hours with her each week at a coffee shop to help her apply for jobs. 

2. A friend is getting married. She told me her florist's delivery driver just canceled. I took off from work, went to the airport, rented a van, picked up her flowers, and delivered her flowers to the wedding venue myself. 

I used to think these actions were a sign of friendship love and a good thing. I've learned from NTs that this is all bad behavior and a terrible thing, so I want to stop doing it. I want to respond ""normally"" when a friend tells me about a crisis or bad thing going on, rather than wanting to jump in and help. My instant reaction is wanting to do something because I care. So how do you care less? How do you care at the same level as NTs? 

I'm tired of being told I'm ""too much"". ",1,1761855104.0,AutismInWomen,1,1.0,False
1okabv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1okabv2/th_everything_is_clean/,[TH] Everything Is Clean,"Something died in 2020. I watched it happen the way it does in films. Quick flashes, memories, fragments. Blowing out candles on my eighteenth. Saying goodbye to my dog in a box. *I love you*s to friends, six pitchers in. Dancing to Lou Reed. To *smile like you mean it*. To *ch-ch-ch-ch-changes*.

Now there is order.

White porcelain coffee mugs go on the second shelf. Two straight rows. Handle out. Quarter turn right. All bags in the basket marked *Bags*. Shoes on the mat marked *Shoes*. Nothing from outside belongs inside. Periodicals stacked neatly, first alphabetically, then by date, in the mid-century stand made of brass and leather. Surfaces dusted daily, sheets washed weekly. Crisp creases on bleached white shirts. Touch your finger to the crease. Do you feel that? Sharp. 

The floor is clean. I know it because I cleaned it the correct way. I had a maid once. She did not clean to my standard, so I let her go. I do the work now, and it is immaculate. Speckless glass. Streakless steel. A bedroom unslept, a living room unlived.

Order.

I am in the kitchen, cleaning a mug in the sink. Scrub around the rim five times. Down to the base and back up, quarter turn, down and back up. Quarter turn. Down and back up. It is not clean enough. More hot water, more scrubbing. There is discoloration near the base. She let the coffee sit too long.

 I hear her enter.

""Good morning, hon,"" she says from behind me.
I don't turn. She freezes.

""I found hair in the shower,"" I say, still working on the mug. Making it clean.

""Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I—""

""There was hair in the shower.""

A long pause.

First she leaves the room. Then she leaves the house.

The mug is done. I place it on the second shelf. Handle out. Quarter turn right. The correct way.

I think of the hair.

I recall the disgust of grasping the wet strands between my fingers. Dropping it in the trash. Emptying the trash. Replacing it with a new bag. A clean bag. Then disinfecting the shower.

But still.

She left hair. The shower is not enough. The entire bathroom must be cleaned because she did not use it correctly. And now my routine is ruined.

I charge upstairs, rubber-gloved hands holding bucket and sponge. But before I reach the bathroom, my momentum is stopped by a sound. Something is wrong. I follow the drip-drip-drip into the bedroom. A brown circle blooms on the ceiling. And just below it, a puddle. 

My jaw tightens. 

I set the bucket down to catch the drops and race back downstairs for more supplies. Again I am stopped, this time by squishing. 

I see it squeezing through the frame of the front door. A goopy brown seam making its way inside through the gap. The stench is unmistakable. I cover my nose. Wipe at the seam. Warm and slick. It returns. The drip-drip-drip upstairs quickens. I wipe the door faster, but it continues squeezing its way in. A clump drops on the cream carpet. I look down.

*Just a perfect day*.

The clump spreads on the carpet like an infection, embedding itself into the fibers. I stare at the stain. My attention is broken by a sound coming from the kitchen. I hurry there and see brown gurgling up from the drain. I turn on the faucet to wash it down, but it hisses and spits before releasing a thick brown stream.

*You make me forget myself*.

I need to see what is happening outside, but the door is coated and my hand keeps slipping on the knob. The drip-drip-drip upstairs has become a steady stream. I hear it overflowing and spilling on the floor. I see it folding down the steps, oozing towards me. I stumble backwards. The windows are obscured by a thick film. Clumps spill from the sink and land with a wet slap on my clean porcelain tile.

*I thought I was someone else*.

It seeps through the fireplace, quickly blanketing the living room floor. I am distracted by the sensation of warm liquid penetrating through my merino wool socks. It sprays from the recessed lighting overhead, spattering my white walls and my face.

The muck is knee-high now. I look around at the mess, the disorder. My overturned nightstand. The TV remote, half submerged. Her and me in a framed picture on the wall from another time. Smiling. Happy.

*Someone good*.

Someone good. I became someone good. Someone who exerts control. But how do you retain control when you are drowning in filth? I instinctively reach for my pocket, but by now my phone is long gone. I push through the sludge to the kitchen and climb onto the marble countertop. The stench is nauseating. I grab a mug from the second shelf. In a panic, I begin scooping and pouring it… where exactly? Yet I continue, exerting control. Maintaining order.

Nowhere else to go. It bubbles up. I scoop faster. Scoop and pour. Scoop and pour. But the mug fills before I can empty it and my arm burns. It climbs past my chin.

I close my eyes and think of the world I have built. A perfectly engineered space free of unpredictability and wrongness and filth. Where nothing is out of place. Where no one tracks mud through the house or touches what should not be touched. Where no one leaves hair in the shower. 

I tilt my head back, gaining a few last seconds before the brown sludge envelops me. It rises up over my face, blocking my breath, darkening the world. In a fleeting moment of clarity, I realize I am still holding the mug. There is not much time. I grope for the cabinet. Pull it open. Release the mug on the second shelf. Handle out. Quarter turn right. One last act of control. 

Everything is clean.

Since I first introduced **GlyphGL** in this subreddit about 3 days ago, there have been a bunch of exciting updates I’m really proud to share  
One of the biggest ones is custom shaders!  
There are now over 5+ builtin shaders in glyph\_effects.h, and I’ve added several optimizations to both the renderer and the TTF parser, things like vertex buffering and tweaks to glyph\_image.h for smoother performance

I also introduced `GLYPHGL_MINIMAL`, a stripped-down build that removes heavier features like effects and UTF-8 handling, leaving a quite fast text renderer,  
Memory allocation is now more efficient too, especially during high-frequency rendering

It took a lot of effort to get here and I’d really appreciate some feedback or support, contributions are also more than welcome!!

And also, the project is still under development, bugs are excepted, if you found anything that needs improvement either pull a request or comment under the post, I will make sure to respond as fast as I can, have a good day/night!

***Thursday***

Without having to get up early to go and see Doctor Kearns, Mason rolled out of bed when his regular alarm went off at six-forty-five. He took care of business in the bathroom, giving himself a quick shave to get rid of the itchy fuzz that had started to grow in.

Halfway through the shave, he looked at himself in the mirror. The white shaving cream made the right side of his face look like a boyish Santa Claus — a stark contrast to the twenty-three-year-old side on the left. *How does Boyd do it?* That guy had always maintained a clean-shaven, military-grade haircut, yet now his jaw was covered in thick bristles that he was starting to shape into a beard, and his fringe was long enough to brush over the tops of his eyes.

That’s not to say it didn’t suit him. If anything, it paved the way between Boyd the super-soldier and Boyd the artist—someone you could actually talk to without, you know, worrying about dying.

Would he ever have that much courage? To change something that had been so fundamental in his life? Probably not. Then again, he’d never had his whole world turn on him the way Boyd had, and clinging to a look that only served to remind him of the hate he’d left behind was just dumb.

Thinking about it like that, he should’ve made the change years ago.

 He finished in the bathroom and returned to his bedroom, pulling out a set of work clothes from the wardrobe. Ben followed him everywhere and was rewarded with his breakfast being poured into the bowl beside Mason’s desk. Knowing cold water wouldn’t faze his best boy, Mason refilled the water bowl from the mini-fridge behind his desk. Ben ate as he got dressed, and the pair then headed into the kitchen.

Or rather, Mason did. Ben stopped at Brock’s doorway and started sniffing around the bottom of the closed door—the same as he had last night. “What is your problem with him?” he asked, turning back to his animal companion with his hands on his hips in exasperation.

“He’s probably picking up Zephyr,” Robbie answered from the kitchen. “Brock got a new cat yesterday afternoon.”

“Oh, shit! I figured it was food.”

Robbie’s face pulled a faux scowl in the direction of Brock’s room. “He better not be sneaking food in there, or I’ll kick his butt into next week.”

But Mason was still hung up on the presence of the cat. “Where’d it come from? Who got it for him? Has anyone given it a checkup?”

*“She,* buddy. Zephyr’s a girl, and we tried to see you yesterday afternoon, but you were already doing that big surgery with Khai. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with her, and I have it on good authority that she’ll be fine with Ben, but what’s the point in having a vet in the house if we can’t make the most of you, huh?”

“Can you bring her out? I’ll have a quick look at her now in my room.” He wasn’t about to put a cat on the island where they all ate, and with the carving of Sam’s family on the coffee table, the next best thing would be the desk in his bedroom.

“Sure. It’s not like Brock’s going to wake up before I drag him out for Mrs Parkes. Gimmee a sec.” Robbie passed him in the hallway, then nudged Ben out of the doorway and slipped inside the room.

“Yeah, yeah, you knew, and I didn’t,” Mason groused at the Rottweiler, who lifted his muzzle as if bragging. “Hopefully, this cat is nice, because the last thing we need in this household is more friction.” He went into his room and moved his laptop and paperwork, making space for his impromptu patient.

A few seconds later, Robbie appeared with a motley tabby in his arms. “Alright, sweetheart,” Mason said, sliding his arms under the cat and taking her from Robbie. “Let’s have a good look at you, eh?”

He carried her over to the table and set her down, then checked her eyes for clarity and pupil response with a penlight. Next, he examined her ears for mites or wax buildup, leaning in for a cautious sniff to detect deeper infections.

“So far, so good, little lady,” he said, smiling as the animal purred under his ministrations. “She’s certainly placid enough.”

“Yeah, Uncle YHWH promised us she’d be a good fit.”

That had Mason’s head whirling around. “You got her from *your Uncle YHWH?”* Mason still couldn’t use the word ‘God’ when referring to Sam and Robbie’s uncle. It was just wrong.

“In a roundabout way. She was in the church when Uncle YHWH and I were talking, and he said she’d be a perfect pet for Brock, so I took him at his word.”

“I’m definitely wasting my time then, but since we’re already this far…” He let his words drift off, checking her gums for any sign of infection. “She could probably do with a scale and polish to get the plaque off her teeth, but that’s not urgent,” he said, as if Robbie were any other pet owner. But then he realised who he was talking to. “Hey, come over here,” he said, waving Robbie over with one hand. At Robbie’s approach, he opened Zephyr’s mouth again. “See all that tartar yellowing her teeth?”

“Is it safe to take it off?”

“Yep. Just take it back to the enamel while I hold her. Don’t go deeper than that, though.”

Robbie touched one of her front canines, and *all* the plaque in Zephyr’s mouth evaporated.

“If you ever want a job as a vet tech and don’t call me first, I’m gonna be pissed,” Mason declared dryly. Since he still had a good grip on Zephyr’s head, he checked her nasal passageways and found no sign of congestion or sneezing. “You are such a good girl,” he praised, giving her a deep pat all the way down her back.

He gave her overall body condition a five… maybe a six. Searching through her fur, he found light scarring from an earlier case of mange that she’d somehow managed to rid herself of, proof she probably hadn’t been a stray her whole life. Mange didn’t just go away on its own. Her lymph nodes were soft, non-painful, and symmetrical when he deliberately palpated them.

He didn’t have a stethoscope at home (something he would be rectifying now that there were animals in the apartment), so he moved on to her abdomen… and that was when his eyes widened comically as he looked across at Robbie.

“What?” Robbie demanded straightening at his side.

“She’s not on the bigger side because she’s overweight, man. This little lady’s gonna be a mamma.”

Robbie’s shout said everything Mason was already thinking.

\* \* \*

**“ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!”**

I knew Robbie’s divine bellow and moved before I was even awake, shoving my foot into the mattress to lunge across the room. I landed in the celestial realm and used my next step to appear between the kitchen island and the living room, searching wildly for my cousin.

“Robbie! Where are you?!” I called as doors along their side of the hallway were ripped open — first Boyd, then Charlie, and finally Brock, rushing out to see what was wrong.

“Mason’s room,” Kulon answered in my ear, and I was already running before the second part landed. “There’s no danger. It’s okay.”

I hit Mason’s doorway anyway, swinging sharply into his room.

Robbie stood with his back to me; his arms braced against the side of Mason’s desk. Mason was behind the desk — from where I stood, I could see him in profile, looking just as rattled.

“What?” I demanded, coming in before the others ran clean over the top of me … or at least tried. Boyd was the only one with the size to possibly succeed.  

Mason looked at Robbie, as if waiting for permission. That alone would’ve made me check Mason’s temperature; verbal diarrhea was definitely his thing when it came to being the first to share information … unless it was work-related.

It was then that I finally noticed Brock’s cat on the table in front of them. “What’s wrong with Zephyr?”

Boyd relaxed with that statement, while Charlie’s face grew more concerned. But the one who looked like he was ready to burst into tears was Brock, who snaked his way through everyone to reach the table. He gathered the cat up and hugged her close, staring at Mason silently for answers.

“She’s pregnant, Brock. Your girl’s going to have babies.”

I sat on the end of Mason’s bed, with Boyd dropping down beside me. “Kittens?” I repeated in disbelief, as Charlie slipped into Robbie’s arms.

“That’s usually what comes out of a mamma cat,” Mason jeered, his face now all smiles. “At least, here on Earth.”

I flipped my middle finger at him, but my brain was tripping over the logistics. “How many?”

“I won’t know until I do an ultrasound of her, but I can feel at least four.”

“…and a partridge in a pear tree,” Charlie sang.

“Don’t be wishing a bird on us, sweet pea. We have enough animals as it is.”

Which I think was kinda the point she was making.

Here’s what I’m rolling with:**

 

**-CHI Blackhawks v WIN Jets Under 6.0 (-115) | 0.5 Units**

 

**Why This Pick?**

 One of these teams on paper is substantially better than the other – but the majority of their matchups in recent history have seen under 6 goals. With 7 of their last 10 meetings cashing the Under and both squads sending their best goaltenders into tonight’s game (Spencer Knight & Connor Hellebuyck…), I say this one follows suit. In addition, 4 of Connor Hellebuyck’s last 5 starts have seen final totals of 5 or less. I’m on the Under to hit.

1ok9xit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ok9xit,My ex wants to meet up tomorrow “to talk”,"I’m afraid if I agree, I’ll fall back into old patterns that I’ve worked so hard to break out of. Please bear with me bc this is a long story but it still won’t even be enough to go fully in-depth.

This morning I got the most random call. It was from an ex of mine, telling me they were going to be in town tomorrow and that after spending some time in therapy, they think it would be really good to meet up “for a coffee” and “to talk”. When I told them I would be working and it was Halloween tomorrow, they basically said they would move around whatever they needed to, even if it had to happen in the middle of the night, to make the meet-up work. They said they felt like this was something that was incredibly important for them to do.

For context: I spent ten years with this ex, they were all I knew for most of my adolescent life, and we went through a lot together. However, they did some really terrible things while we were together and it led to my absolute destruction. I obviously wasn’t perfect and played my part. I shut down in conflicts, I have a tendency to withdraw for self-protection, I had a difficult time with trust and self-esteem after some of the things they did, as well as I’m sure a plethora of other issues. We were very young and it was a toxic, codependent, trauma-bond of a relationship. They were my first relationship and, to this day, I have never loved anyone as much.. but this was also someone who wasn’t there for me when my dad passed away, who stayed back to cheat on me with their former coworker instead of attending the funeral with me, who I was supporting and paying the college tuition of, who convinced me I was hallucinating when they would sneak out at night to meet up with other women, who encouraged me to get on mental health meds to “stop the hallucinations”, and much more. It was a mess and I’m not proud of staying through it. I think the end of the relationship was a gift from God bc it desperately needed to end and I honestly didn’t have the strength to leave it on my own.

Around the time of Covid, we were living together and they were between jobs again. One of our good mutual friends needed surgery at the time, and my ex offered to go to California to help take care of them during recovery. I agreed that it was a great idea. We talked every day, but the calls got more sparse after the first month. They had discussed the possibility of going and visiting Colorado on their way back, but hadn’t discussed when exactly that would be. I sort of just trusted them like I always did. Then all of a sudden, I stopped hearing from them completely. I went through the panic of assuming something bad had happened to them and contacted the mutual friend, only to find out my ex had left their place two weeks prior. I talked to their family who hadn’t really heard from them, other than to confirm one of them did get one call a few days before and so they knew they were okay. They went ghost for an entire month on me. It turns out they were essentially in an affair with a woman they met in Colorado (I didn’t know this until a week after the breakup). What is confusing is that we were in a good place at the time before this. 

So after that month, they came back and tried to get back together, but I initially wasn’t receptive to it. They assured me nothing had happened. About a week later, I came around to the idea of getting back together.. and they spent four months fucking with my head and dragging me through the Hell and back of “I love you”s and “I shouldn’t have said that”s and everything in between. They admitted to essentially having been in a sexual relationship “with no feelings” with another person, but they would constantly change their mind. They would want to be with me one moment and then decide they didn’t the next. I was accustomed to hearing from them and then getting blocked and ghosted for weeks.. only for them to pop back up and repeat the cycle. This caused a lot of trauma for me around “peekabooing”.. which is popping up and disappearing on repeat. I wasn’t sleeping or eating. I knew it hit peak when I fell asleep at the wheel out of pure exhaustion and crashed my car. The entire situation was incredibly destructive to my mental health. 

One day, they took a post I made on social media out of context and instead of asking me about it, they assumed I had met someone else and chose to cut me off out of anger. During trying to talk to them, they threatened to file a restraining order if I ever reached out to them in any way ever again. I don’t harass people, so I obviously respected their wishes and left them alone, but I fractured mentally in the process. I cried every day for months in my mum’s lap. I couldn’t go into our apartment anymore, I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat, and I spun out. I ended up attempting and getting 5270’d. 

About a year later, on Halloween ironically, they reached out to me and tried to be my friend (and to hook up). I was going through a breakup and I was hesitant, but ultimately receptive to potentially having a friendship (not to hook up) and we tried but it didn’t work out. They were trying to sleep with me, while also having me field their potential relationships with other people. They would say incredibly hurtful things to me, like tell me that the person I was with after them “never loved me”. Essentially we still had communication issues that contributed to the fall out and we both came to the conclusion we couldn’t be friends. It’s been about four years since then.

Two or so years ago, the mutual friend (who actually stopped being friends with them as well) let me know my ex had gotten engaged. I obviously didn’t care as I had already moved on to my new partner and was happy, but I feel like it’s relevant to mention now bc when they called me today I congratulated them and they told me the engagement was broken off four months ago. I think the fact that they are heartbroken from their failed engagement and they were alone on their birthday (which was less than two weeks ago) is the catalyst for them to reach out. They were about to tell me what happened between the two of them, but then decided to use it as leverage by telling me that they would only give me the details if I agreed to meet up with them.

My mum is livid I took the call and is telling me I don’t need to get dragged into the mess again.. but that’s bc she witnessed the absolute ruin of me through all of it. My sisters and that same mutual friend have all said the same thing as well - that I shouldn’t meet up with them. Yet I still am on the fence and I honestly don’t know why I am when the answer is crystal clear. I just feel like it would messed up to deny them a chance at the closure they need.. but at the same time, I had to give myself closure over the years and it took a lot of therapy, time, and hard work. I don’t want to open any of it back up. I think I went through a bit of heartache of my own recently that mirrored a few of those patterns and that it’s steering me towards the wrong direction. Maybe I just need a bunch of people to lay out that I’m being an absolute moron for even mulling it over at all.

If you actually read all of this, God bless you. 🥲

Otherwise the TLDR: Ex of ten years wants to meet up for coffee tomorrow after four years of not really talking. The relationship was incredibly toxic and the breakup caused me a lot of suffering as well as an attempt. I have a habit of getting pulled in but I am finally healed and I don’t want to risk or jeoparidise how far I’ve come.",4,1761854192.0,WhatShouldIDo,8,0.83,False

I'd say fairly low. I can see their bums. 

And I know that's the reason why they are wearing them that low.

If i use old beans, it's almost impossible even on the grind setting of 1.

1ok9e69,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheHallowdineLibrary/comments/1ok9e69/hallowed_ground/,Hallowed Ground,"Even though he had been born and bred in Kentucky, seven generations strong, dad never shut up about his Irish heritage. Flame-haired and blue-eyed, he certainly looked the part. He’d sought out a wife of similarly Hibernian ancestry, and sired three ginger brats of varying hues – two boys, and me. My eldest brother, Kevin, had pale red hair that could almost pass for blond. Rory’s curls were a darker copper, closer to dad’s fiery locks; but only my scalp grew the true, angry red my father coveted for his progeny.   
But scarlet though my crowning glory proved, I wasn’t a boy. That was such a point of grief for him that he pressured my mother for a fourth child until he drove her away – into the arms of another man, one who wasn’t obsessed with red-haired babies.  
Dad’s dreams of Ireland didn’t end with his children; ever since he was a lad he’d dreamed of owning a farm in County Kerry. So of course, when he had a decent win on the lottery, he deemed it ‘the luck o’ the Irish’ in his terrible put-on accent, and moved the whole family across the Atlantic to a dingy little Irish town on the borders of civilisation.  
And that’s where it all began.  
  
The locals pretended no fondness for the brash American man and his three citified children. Dad groused about jealousy, said they resented him buying the farmland, that he’d beat out all the local offers with the sheer weight of his winnings. Truth be told, the former owner seemed quite content to be quit of the land. He wasn’t even present to hand over the keys to the farmhouse when we arrived, jetlagged and grumpy. Instead the keys had been left in the battered tin letterbox at the end of a driveway, half-hidden by hedgerows of wild hawthorn and bracken.   
There had been some contention between the former owner and the locals, I gathered, once we’d settled down and I was sent off to school. He’d given easement rights to a developer, who had cut a road straight through part of the farmland to allow easier access to the cluster of identical faux-cottages he was building. This had gone down particularly poorly with the superstitious locals, because the road had been bulldozed straight through what they called a *fairy fort* \- a series of circular depressions in the land that held mythological and cultural significance. The event was still recent enough that people gave our family dirty looks when they encountered us around the steep, cobbled streets of the township - even though we’d had nothing to do with the defacement of the ancient site ourselves.   
As we settled into life on the farm, I grew to love the half-stone, half-timber farmhouse, the rolling fields, and the overgrown hedgerows and uneven stone walls. Dad claimed he was finally ‘home’, and his awful accent only got worse. But he threw himself into the farmwork with a passion that bore out his posturing, and he was good at it, much to everyone’s surprise. Time passed slowly here, and the long days felt ripe with promise for a while. But as summer waned and fall approached, things took a turn for the worse.  
  
It was little things, at first. Minor inconveniences, like gates left unhitched so that the cows and sheep wandered where they didn’t belong. Fingers were pointed at me, since I liked to explore the farm in my spare time, but I was meticulously careful about shutting gates behind me. When the third feed bag in a week split open while he carried it, and when the pumps for the water troughs kept breaking down faster than he could fix them, dad began to suspect sabotage.   
“It’s those bloody yokels,” he growled, “trying to make us think the ‘spirits’ are angry.”   
His theory was given weight when he caught one of the local children skulking near the fairy fort. He led the boy back to his family by his ear, shouting imprecations at the lad’s parents for trying an honest man’s patience.   
“T’weren’t us tha’ fouled up your pumps,” the boy’s father told us, and spat across his doorstep. “That would be th’ *Shee*.”   
Having none of their superstitious nonsense, dad told them in no uncertain terms to stay the hell off his property, on pain of prosecution, or much worse. I knew that last was no idle threat; dad had always loved his hunting rifles. These days he needed little excuse to unlock them from the farmhouse’s massive iron gun cabinet.   
But despite the warnings, bad luck, or bad deeds, continued to plague the farm. Spooked livestock crashed through fences, injuring themselves in their panic. The house cow stopped giving milk for three days, and when she did start again, it soured so quickly we had to throw most of it away one day later. And as harvest time approached, our barley paddock inexplicably turned; the tall stalks bowing brown-black heads, sticky and reeking of blighted rot.   
“I don’t know how they’re doing it,” dad growled, his always florid face splotched scarlet with anger to rival his hair, “but if it doesn’t stop, I’ll go into town and start banging heads together until I have some answers.”   
Sat at the dinner table with my brothers, I said nothing. I especially said nothing of waking every morning to find my own fiery hair twisted and tangled into unnatural snarls, despite my neat bedtime braid. Nor did I broach the fact that I’d noticed something; nothing in the old stone barn had ever been touched by our saboteurs.   
The same barn that was hung with twisted metal wind chimes of ancient, blackened iron.  
  
As October slunk onward and the weather cooled, the entire family remained on edge. Kevin and dad took turns patrolling the farmlands at night with a rifle under one arm, as though they sensed the shenanigans on the farm would intensify as Halloween neared. Indeed, the locals seemed particularly agitated by any mention of that approaching date when I ventured to ask whether it was celebrated here. Shady looks and whispered conversations followed us around the township when we visited for supplies. My only friend at school, Caitlin O’Neill, stopped sitting with me at lunch after I asked whether there would be trick-or-treating, or even just a bonfire. When I confronted her about it, she simply burst into tears and ran away.   
Something was coming; but what it was, nobody would say.   
Desperate for answers, I pored through books in the library, and I hunted up and down our farmlands, swathed in thick woollens against the chill, looking for any clue as to what was going on. Whilst my father and brothers were still sceptical, suspecting only human hands were responsible for the ongoing sabotage, I wasn’t nearly so certain. Three other places on the farm always remained untouched by the fey pranks of our antagonists; and hung from trees near those three places were the same twisted iron talismans found at the barn, chiming dully in the October winds.   
But before I could broach the subject with my dad, the bonfire was lit.  
  
We saw the towering column of smoke coming from the easement road as soon as we woke that morning. Dad roared at us to grab rifles and jackets, then ran for the barn to start up the tractor. Crammed precariously into the cab of the vehicle, we drove through the paddocks, Rory leaping down from his perch on the side of the machine to open gates and let us through.   
The bonfire was a bright pyramid in the early morning mist, glowing red as my hair and belching greasy smoke into the clear dawn sky. None of us mentioned the obvious; it had been built directly over the piece of road that bisected the fairy fort. People scattered as we approached, running for their own farm vehicles and gunning them down the road. Kevin pointed his rifle into the sky and let off a warning shot, informing the trespassers we meant business.   
As we got out of the tractor, dad revved the engine, then put it in gear, heading straight for the bonfire.   
“DAD!” I screamed, “What are you doing?!”   
But before any of us could do anything about it, the heavy farm vehicle ploughed straight through the burning wood, scattering it in a huge cloud of orange and red sparks. It emerged on the other side largely unscathed and dad jumped from it, battering at the smouldering tires with his coat.   
Grinning, blue eyes wild and bright in his sooty face, he surveyed the wrecked remains of the bonfire.   
“About time we had a win,” he said, resting a hand on my tangled head.  
  
There was no school for me and Rory on October 31st. Dad decided to keep us home until this fairy fort nonsense was sorted out - and besides, he needed extra hands for building a makeshift fence and gate across the easement road, which he intended to padlock shut to restrict access. I guess after the gunshot and dad’s crazy stunt with the tractor, we hadn’t expected any more trouble so soon - so when we saw the first of the dead animals arranged around the fairy fort, we didn’t know how to process what we were seeing.   
The townsfolk had certainly been busy in the night; hundreds of sheep and cattle had been slaughtered, slit throats leaking blood into the grass where they lay, carefully arranged into three huge rings surrounding the sunken green shapes of the fairy fort. None of them were ours; as we picked through the burgeoning hum of happy flies, we noted that none of the ear tags belonged to our farm.   
“Call the cops, dad,” Kevin urged, “this is too much. This is just insane.”   
“There’s a bit of paper in the middle of the road,” Rory called, “held down with a rock.”   
Picking through the rings of dead animals, dad snatched up the note and read what was scrawled on it, his angry eyes viciously darting across the words.   
“What does it say?” I asked, craning to see.   
“It says a load of bullshit, is what it says. It says we have to kill two-thirds of our livestock and leave them in the middle of the road, or else the fairy folk will come for us.”   
Rory, Kevin and I exchanged furtive looks, before Kevin spoke, and he didn’t sound like my self-assured big brother. “What are we gonna do, dad?”   
“Sure as *hell* I’m not killing most of my animals to placate these assholes, boy. I’ll be calling the police, then all of us will be out here tonight, armed and waiting to put down any more trouble.”  
  
It was the first Halloween I remember that wasn’t happily full of pumpkin carving and hanging up bat-bunting; instead, Kevin and I rammed posts for the new fence while dad and Rory dragged the bloating animal carcasses away by tractor. They laboriously piled them up and soaked them with gasoline, in preparation for a grisly and unappetising fall barbeque. The local constabulary turned up as we stopped for lunch, and the orange-vested cop took statement from us, his nose wrinkled at the pungent reek of burning wool.   
“There’s not much I can do about it right now,” the man explained, putting away his notebook and pen, “but I’ll do some asking around the town and find out who’s responsible. In the meantime, lock everything up and keep the livestock close to the farm house.”   
Following his instruction, we spent the rest of the afternoon herding the animals into the two paddocks closest to the house, and filling the barn with all the livestock it could fit.   
“They’ll be back,” dad told us, an anticipatory note in his voice, “they can’t leave well enough alone.”   
On the neighbouring farms, and in the distant smudge of the town, more Samhain bonfires had been lit, just as they had been for the last thousand or so years. The smoke drifted and danced above the hills, hazing the sky and playing with the veil of mist that began to descend at dusk. The animals near the farmhouse bawled and snorted at their unusual confinement, while dad cleaned and oiled his rifles methodically, even though his fingers trembled with fatigue. I sat at the open window as the light began to die, breathing in smuts, straining my ears for the dim chime of iron between the screams of the beasts.   
Nightfall found me asleep in dad’s armchair, wrapped in a huge crocheted blanket grandma had given me years ago. Kevin gently shook me awake, pushing a mug of coffee into my hands.   
“We’re going to need plenty of this tonight.”   
Dad and Rory were already out, rifles slung across their backs as they threw out hay to the restless livestock. On Kevin’s instruction, I rugged up for the weather and picked up the .22 rifle dad had designated for me.   
“We’ll be fine,” Kevin assured me, perfect while teeth flashing in his dirty blond beard, “Nobody messes with four armed Americans.”   
But just as those words left his lips, a splintering *crash* and the roaring of cattlebeasts cut through the night, followed by the wildly swinging beams of flashlights and voices shouting; dad and Rory.   
Hustling outside as fast as we could, jamming spare ammunition in our coat pockets, we found that part of the fence had collapsed and animals were pouring through in a river of panic, with Rory desperately trying to head off the stampede.   
“Spoke too soon,” Kevin muttered as we picked our way across the darkened field.  
  
It seemed like every gate on the farm had been thrown wide open, and in response our livestock had run in every possible direction at once, their mad, bawling rush leaving behind heavily hoof-rutted mud that threatened to trip us up with every step.   
“Kevin, head up to the pond, close it off and make sure none of these animals drown themselves before the night is out.”   
“No problem, dad.”   
“Rory, I need you to check the north gate. Make sure none of them get onto the road.”   
“Got it.”   
I knew dad would ask me to stay behind before he even said it, so when he pointed to the farmhouse, I turned around and started walking before he could give the instruction. I was annoyed, but at least I’d be warm and dry while the boys stomped about in the thickening mist.   
Inside, I busied myself by making fresh coffee for when they inevitably returned, and stoked up the fire, watching faintly greenish flame dancing on the resinous wood.   
For hours, nothing stirred, and no-one returned. I’d expected Kevin back from his errand, but he must’ve met up with dad and been assigned another task. The coffee cooled, and I laboriously made a fresh pot on the stovetop, lamenting the automatic machine we’d left back in the States.   
Opening my phone, I sent out a text to each of the boys, asking where they were, but when none of the messages showed as delivered, I cursed the poor reception on the farm and tried calling dad.   
No answer – just endless ringing.   
  
What was heavy mist and what was smoke, I couldn’t tell, but thick wraiths obscured the line of the hills. The frigid night air stank of woodsmoke, and water beaded thickly on my jacket and in my hair. A cow lowed forlornly in the distance, answered by the shriek of a steer far to my left, and I shivered as I followed the fenceline toward the pond. The gunshot that cracked through the night jerked me to an abrupt halt, but the report was preceded by a dirty orange flash of light ahead of me, and instinct took over. I vaulted the stone fence and ran towards it, my own weapon banging painfully on my hip and spine as I dashed headlong, heedless of the rolling, rutted terrain. Another gunshot was followed by a cry of pain – Rory’s cry – and I all but fell over my brother as he staggered across the field, drawn on by the mad bob of my flashlight.   
Rifle gone, he swayed, one hand pressed to his chest, eyes skyward, like he was taking an oath. A bubbling syllable escaped him, its sense lost in a slurry of red froth. With a cough of darker blood, he subsided into the mud at my feet, stained lips still trying to make the shape of a word while his own fluids swamped his lungs.   
“KEVIN!” I screamed, “DAD!”   
But only the distant cries of distressed animals answered me – nothing human.   
Fighting panicky tears, I covered Rory’s hand with my own and pressed it as hard as I could against the bloody patch on the front of his jacket. But I already knew just how little good it would do.   
I wasn’t sure he could hear me, but I was talking aloud as much for me as for him. “I’m gonna head for the hill by the pond, there’s decent reception up there, and I’ll call an ambulance, OK?”   
Rory’s hand dutifully clutched at his chest, but his pale red head lolled back into the mud as I got my bearings and ran for the hill.  
  
I don’t know how I got lost. It was impossible, but it had happened. Perhaps it was the trauma of my brother’s mortal injury, or maybe it was the feyness of the events surrounding us, the night around me twisted by the thinning of the veil. But by the time I stumbled on the pond, finally oriented by the jagged loom of the old oak hung with iron charms, I knew Rory was dead.  
No ambulance could help him, even if I could have called one; but my phone still showed no signal at all.  Scanning for the highest point, I saw that in the pond ahead of me an animal corpse floated, humped and dark – Kevin hadn’t managed to head off the livestock in time.   
But as the creature floated closer I realised that I wasn’t seeing the wet nap of animal hide; what I saw was the soaked plaid of Kevin’s jacket, and inside it, the limp form of my eldest brother drifted face-down, his outstretched hands slack, and white as bone.   
All thoughts fled, I waded out and grabbed his collar, even as the mud sucked at my boots, attempting to mire me. Brute strength prevailed, and I felt every bit my father’s daughter as I hauled the cold corpse of my brother onto the bank of the pond. His blue eyes were fogged with death, and within their depths I saw only mist and smoke.   
I knew I should attempt CPR, that I should blow air into his lungs in a vain effort to resuscitate him, but I couldn’t. The idea of pressing my warm mouth to the frozen meat of his lips filled me with dizzy revulsion, and I gagged, scrambling away from his body. This was no longer my brother.   
*Dad*, I thought desperately, *I need to find dad*.   
And as though guided by unseen, unkind hands, I stumbled through the paddocks toward the fairy fort, the blue-white mask of Kevin’s empty features haunting every heavy step.  
  
When dad’s bulky silhouette loomed through the mist, tears seared my eyes with relief. But as he enfolded me in a desperate hug, I smelled sickly, burned flesh and scorched fabric, and drew back.   
Flames had seared his right side, melting his jacket, and his right hand was blistered into an ugly mess; angry reds and raw pinks.   
“Tried to burn me,” he gasped, coughing smoke, “but the rope burned through. Got away.”   
“Who? Who tried to burn you?”   
“They were right, right about the fort,” he managed, leaning on me for support. I tried not to notice the skin that sloughed from his weeping hand and stuck to my jacket.     
Prescience fired in my synapses and I turned us toward the nearest of the talisman trees.   
“I’ll get us home, dad. Don’t worry,” I told him.   
As we dragged ourselves across the farm, I zig-zagged between the iron-festooned trees. My ears strained for the sounds of the odd chime to guide me through the dark, their music dulled by the mist; and yet the mist was always thinner around each trunk, as though held at bay by ordinary old iron. How long it took us to reach the barn, I don’t precisely know, but it was still well dark when we found the doors.   
Inside, the barn stank of animal, of sheep urine and cattle dung. But with the ancient metal talismans hung to roost like iron bats beneath the eaves of the thick stone walls, I intuitively divined we were safe.   
“The boys,” dad asked finally, the words hard-won, the right side of his mouth puckered with burn-weals.   
“Dead,” I answered, unable to look at him. “Rory shot, Kevin drowned.”   
“Don’t believe it,” he answered, all Kentucky drawl now, no hint of his faux Irish, “Don’t believe any of it. This is a dream. A horrible dream.”   
“I wish it was, dad.”   
Green light flashed at the door of the barn and the iron chimes jangled in a frenzy, though no wind blew on the still farmland. The house cow, Essie, bawled mournfully, as though she knew this sight and sound, and I put my arms around her warm neck.   
“Shh, girl, shhh now.”   
The emerald light strobed through the cobweb-choked windows of the barn, verdant shadows dancing across the steaming backs of the animals.   
“Go away!” I screamed, “Get off our farm!”   
I’m not sure what I was expecting in response. But it certainly wasn’t the very human voice that answered me; familiar as my own, subdued and impossible in the middle of this madness.      
“Maeve?” called Rory, “I’m cold. Can you let us in?”   
Slumped against the post of a cow stall, dad’s drooping eyelids snapped open and he lurched to his feet like he’d grabbed an electric fence, shouting.   
“Rory! Rory, my boy!”   
“Dad? It’s us dad, let us in,” wheedled Kevin’s voice, joining Rory’s pleading chorus.   
Fear raked my belly, clawing at my sensibilities, as the eyes of my brother fogged over inside my head. That horror was real; this was not. I’ve never fought myself as hard as I did in that moment, wrestling with my urge to join my father and throw open the door.   
“Dad, *NO!* They’re *dead*. They’re both dead. I saw them.”   
Heedless of me yanking at his good arm, my father’s ruined, half-fused fingers fumbled aside the barn door, and I wailed along with Essie, my terror bovine.   
Hands as white as bone; slender, *beautiful* hands, pulled him out into the emerald radiance. And then he was gone, too – snuffed out along with that eerie light, extinguished as the door crashed shut and left me in the stinking darkness.  
  
My dead family called to me in trio for the rest of the night. I stuffed straw and dung into my ears to block them out, but they sang inside my skull, too. When dawn broke, wan and white, over the farm, I was hollow-eyed and half-mad, filthy and splattered with blood and muck.   
The bodies of my father and brothers still haven’t been found, nearly a year hence.   
None of my explanations made sense, but the police here are locals, too, and they seemed to know from the start that I wasn’t to blame. I spent three months with my grandmother back in Kentucky, until it became obvious to everyone that there was no healing to be found. And so, I came back to the farm, red-eyed and raw as the day it had happened.   
After the things I saw that night, I no longer blame the townsfolk. They were trying to *warn* us, to put right the desecration of the fairy fort. To protect a stupid, ignorant man and his stupid family from things they didn’t understand.   
But I’m not ignorant anymore. I learned where dad couldn’t, and that’s why I came back.   
I haven’t been idle, these eight months. There was still just enough of dad’s winnings left over for me to purchase every tinker’s scrap of old iron in southern Ireland. There’s no barley to blight this season, the crop is far tougher; for through clement weather and foul, I’ve spent every day since my return sowing every last furrow with cold iron.   
In every story I’ve read, placating the fairy folk with old rituals and needless sacrifices seems to end badly for the humans.   
This human is going to fight. I am my father’s only flame-haired heir; that means this farm is mine, and I intend to destroy them.   
Sometimes you forge your own luck.

1ok9buq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ok9buq,This weekend is Day of the Dead. Here's Pan de muerto/Bread of the dead + various items from La Única Panadería + La Única Restaurant in North York. Feliz Día de los Muertos!,"This weekend is Día de los Muertos/Day of the Dead. To celebrate, I'll post a bit about a Mexican bakery and restaurant that I've been frequenting since they opened about two years ago. The first location, La Única Panadería, is at Wilson and Dufferin, and just renovated and expanded their space. It's both a bakery and a casual restaurant, with the menu focusing mostly on antijitos and breakfast.  
  
The second location is at Bradstock and Weston (taking over the old Sazon Latino location). It has opened more recently and is more of a sit down restaurant with most of the same menu as the first location + various rice platters + seafood.

These guys are quite active on social media, with high production advertisements that are only done in Spanish. Both restaurants tend to be consistently busy with patrons, and most of the time I'm the only gringo in the restaurant. Whenever I meet Mexican immigrants in Toronto, I always ask where they go for food, and La Unica tends to come up.

A key appeal with La Unica is that they bake their own bread and make their tortillas in house. At 5 dollars per taco (cheaper if you buy in bulk, used to be 4.50 no tax), I am pretty sure it's the cheapest taco with in-house made tortillas in the GTA. You can compare with prices from places downtown like Los Compas and Campechano yourself. The tortas are a bit more pricy, but are gigantic with fairly fluffy bread.

1. Pan de muerto/Bread of the dead, tamales, and a torta peaking out the left side. Pan de muerto is a sweet bread/pan dulce that has a bit of orange zest added. For those familiar with Asian style bakeries, Mexican pan dulce is reminiscent of Asian style sweet breads but slightly denser and less fluffy. If you want to buy the breads, just pick up a tray and tongs and pick from the shelf displaying all the breads at each location.
2. Pambazo - a sandwich that is dipped in a guajillo sauce, fried up, and stuffed with potatoes and chorizo. This is probably my favourite sandwich of theirs (and the cheapest at IIRC 15, the others are 19-21).
3. Tripa Tacos - These tacos were loaded, but my only issue with La Unica is it feels like the taco filling portion can be inconsistent (had similar issues with Los Compas recently). Whereas Los Gyros nearby is consistent in loading up on meat in their dishes, sometimes La Única can match or outdo Los Gyros in terms of filling, and sometimes it feels like a lot less. If they were consistent packed with filling, the house made tortillas would easily put La Única above Los Gyros for me.
4. Aguachile - The Bradstock location's seafood menu features ceviche, aguachile, and various seafood + rice plates. So far this is my favourite seafood item on the menu. Wasn't a huge fan of the rice plates with octopus/fish so far, but I guess my tastes always gravitate towards aguachile on the menu (I have the same issue at Sinaloa Factory).
5. Vuelve a la vida - ""return to life"", a seafood cocktail and hangover cure with provenance from the state of Veracruz. Inside is shrimp, oysters, and octopus. The sauce is sweet and tangy. I've noticed quite a lot of representation from Veracruz in the GTA Mexican restaurant scene.
6. Scrambled eggs, refried beans, and rice. A simple Mexican breakfast. The Wilson location is open EARLY at 6 AM, and offers these breakfasts with free refill coffee, and a free mini-pan dulce. You can also order from the standard menu if you want tacos at 6 AM. The bradstock location has brunch available at later hours.

**Miladies and Milords!** 👑

The royal engineers barely had time to polish their hammers before our wise scholars came running with another list of “urgent improvements.” The result?** Six glorious new upgrades** waiting for you between levels 17 and 43 — guaranteed to make your kingdom richer, faster, and slightly more fabulous. 💎

Because what is a ruler without proper income… even when offline? 💤💰

⚙️ **New Upgrades Include:**

• **Reeve** – level 17, increases maximum clicks on town (your finger will love this one)
• **Scribe** – level 19, speeds up tax refill (less waiting, more collecting)
• **Road Toll** – level 27, increases income from gravel roads & wooden bridges
• **Accounting II** – level 37, boosts offline income (for rulers who multitask sleeping & earning)
• **Royal Advisor** – level 42, boosts offline income (because one accountant wasn’t enough)
• **Road Toll II** – level 43, increases coin income from cobbled roads, stone bridges & tunnels

🏗️ **New Buildings Have Arrived!**

Two exclusive structures appeared in the royal shop, unlockable at levels 32 and 34:

• **Sculptor** – produces coins and stores stone (probably charges per chisel stroke) 🪨
• **Tileworks** – produces and stores clay (because mud is money now) 🧱

🏙️ **Expanding the Realm**

Want another town to rule over? Head to the shop and reveal the nearest undiscovered location — more land, more citizens, more paperwork. 🗺️✍️

**Fixes & Royal Tweaks:**

• Regular stone quarries now produce 20% more (our miners finally got coffee ☕)
• Big Houses now count toward town level-up requirements (nobles rejoice!)
• Fixed 3x income bonus countdown (time is money, after all)
• Fixed upgrading towns near the edge of the map (you can now truly rule to the borders)
• Shop confirmations now have an independent setting (no more “did I really buy that?” moments)
• Optimized farm building with the Plough Upgrade
• Visual & textual improvements fit for a royal audience 👑

Your kingdom is growing stronger, shinier and slightly sassier with every update.

Now go, noble ruler — collect those taxes, admire your sculptures, and maybe… don’t tax the Tileworks too hard. 😏

It seems counterintuitive because Im naturally a morning person, lately I've been getting up at around 4am, so that should in theory be a great time to run, but I can't bring myself to do it. The sun rises at around 6:15 these days, and my local gym also doesn't open until 6. And I start work at 7:45 am. Which means if I want get a run in in the AM, I'd have to run either mostly or entirely in the dark, or be pressed for tjme, or both. Really not conducive to a relaxing running experience, especially when also factoring in trying to get a shower in and coffee and food, whether before or after a run.

I do love my weekend early morning long runs though, probably because none of the aforementioned concerns are in issue.
My preferred morning routine, instead, is a rather slow one, basically I get ready for the day and then read for a couple hours and have a couple cups of coffee, then breakfast then work.

I just got my mellow drip and made a quick v60 pour over with it. I changed zero variables to what I normally do besides using the mellow drip. 

My recipe is as follows: 15g coffee pour to 50g, wait for 1 minute and 30 second, and finish the pour to 250g. 

Mr draw down time was 20-30 seconds quicker than normal. It does kind of make sense because it's less agitation therefore less fines clogging the filter. 

Does this sound right to everyone who has a mellow drip? The cup was fine, maybe lacking a little flavor but it was noticably less harsh. I'm going to try grinding finer to experiment a bit",0,1761852215.0,pourover,2,0.5,False

First time on the East Coast. I've heard how East Coast people are rude. I found it to be more like you don't put up with people's BS, which I greatly respect. 

Flew into Boston. Spent a day. Got on a cruise (meh). Got back from cruise. Spent a day in Boston. Flew out. 

I was really only in Boston for most of 2 days. 

1st day: went to Row34 seaport for lunch - fantastic, went to Native Sun dispensary for desert, walked around seaport for a while, caught a show at Laugh Boston. Next morning: went to My Diner for breakfast and had a smoked salmon eggs benedict - wow! Walked back to the hotel along the pedestrian walk next to Pappas Way. Real nice, calm walk, with some history mixed in - enjoyable mid morning walk.

2nd day: ubered to the wrong hotel. Spoke to the shuttle driver and he took us to the correct hotel for free. Tipped him $20. Got lunch at Legal Seafood Seaport - fantastic! Walked around a bit. Wanted to take a tour of Fenway, but it didn't work out - kinda bummed, really wanted to see this - maybe next time I come from Minnesota - I definitely think I will be back. Next morning: Went to get breakfast at the hotel (Hilton @ Logan). Coffee was $8, an omelette was $25. Decided to just see what was in Logan instead - found Legal Seafood in the terminal - had a smoked salmon breakfast sandwich and espresso martini for breakfast - also fantastic. 

My wife is gluten sensitive. All of the restaurants we ate at were very accommodating. Very much appreciated.

That was the extent of my time in Boston. Everyone we asked for directions or suggestions was really effing nice - maybe because you felt bad for the very obvious clueless tourists. 

Carl @ Hilton Homewood Suites at the cruise port, if you happen to read this: thank you for the hospitality, the suggestions, and just being a cool dude to a couple of out of towners. Also, great job on the quick witted smack down of me being a Raiders fan! You helped make our trip enjoyable. Hope we run into each other sometime in the future.

I was sceptical of electric cars at first and really had to be convinced.  They gave me a great deal on a lease. (Lou I figured I would give it a try!  (I usually buy my cars outright.) 

Don’t get me wrong, I loved my station wagon and I thought getting gas was not a problem. 
However, now that I just plug in my car in the comfort of my garage for 275 mile charge at Pennie’s on the dollar compared to gas…I am sold. I did not realize what a pain in the but it is to stop for gas.  

I save about 250$ a month on fuel. 
The car is comparatively priced and very luxurious.  It basically drives itself if you want it to.  It has every feature you can imagine. 

We have a Tesla  for long trips. But audi does offer a converter if you want to use a Tesla supercharger.   The Tesla infrastructure is awesome.  We have driven from Pennsylvania to North Carolina, Maine, Detroit, and Florida without any problems finding a supercharger.   The car charges in less time than it takes to get a coffee and use the restroom. 

Don’t believe the naysayers. Electric is awesome, easier and the cars rock.  That is why china, Europe and the rest of the world want them.

You sit down expecting popcorn and a cool thriller. Instead you get a twin-barrel uppercut of existential dread and political mayhem. This movie didn’t just pull the trigger — it made you watch the damn gun being cocked.

From about minute one you’re in chaos: a lone missile launched, unknown origin, the fate of a nation dangling by a thread.  The director Kathryn Bigelow is basically like “let’s move the surviving-human-race scenario from dusty military jargon into your Netflix queue.”

What works:

The tension is merciless. You feel like you’ve swallowed eight cups of coffee and the entire world’s on fire.

The cast (Idris Elba as the President? yes) and production detail lift this beyond casual streaming fodder. 

It dares to leave you unsettled. No neat bow. No “everything’s fixed.” Just the aftermath of what we built and who maybe pulls the pin.


What sucks:

It’s almost too clever by half. The ending: incomplete. You’re pulled into the panic, then dropped off without full closure. Viewers are pissed. 

The repeating of the same moments from slightly different angles feels like a loop you didn’t ask for. The film sets up the house of dynamite, lit the fuse, then shows you the fuse again from three cameras.


Verdict:
Watch it if you’re into thrillers that don’t hug you at the end. This is the kind of movie that stomps you, flips your world, and leaves you staring at the ceiling. If you’d rather something comforting, skip it — it’s not meant for cozy.",1,1761851951.0,MoviesThatFeelLike,1,1.0,False

1ok8yae,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ok8yae/i_hate_my_indian_in_laws/,I HATE MY INDIAN IN LAWS,"I’m white American and married my Indian husband about 5 years ago. We’ve obviously had some cultural differences but nothing crazy. He’s always cleaned up after himself, been respectful, all the stuff.  Like it does not affect our day to day life ever. HOWEVER his parents are literally the fucking bane of my existence. I get that in Indian culture family is a much larger priority than in American culture but the things I go through for his parents are in my opinion, insane. 

First of all, when they come and visit us, they come and stay for TWO MONTHS. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. pretty much once a year at this point.  They super extremely religious so they have all these rules that every single person in the family has to follow. Every single time they come my whole life is uprooted and interrupted and I’m extremely tired of it. 

I eat meat, they don’t. So when they come I’m not allowed to keep any meat or eggs of sort in MY kitchen. It’s not allowed. They don’t drink, so when they come I can’t keep a bottle of wine in MY kitchen. They are also extremely filthy and gross to live with. They leave garbage everywhere, piss on the toilet seat, nail clippings on the coffee table. She takes over my kitchen like literally takes it over. I’m pretty organized and ocd, I don’t like anything on my counters, my dishes are organized in the cabinet, same thing with silverware, the fridge, etc. 

My kitchen is disgusting. No space on the counters to even prep anything. I’ll clean it, not even 3 hours later it’s in the same condition. Everything in disarray. I’ll also add that not even 3 months ago we just renovated our house, everything brand new. My brand new white countertops are stained yellow everywhere with turmeric. She puts green chile in the fry pan for every single effing meal and it creates this chile  gas almost like pepper spray. Everyone is Coughing and sneezing and this is literally like twice a day. I’ll add I have a toddler who is also breathing this in coughing and sneezing 

My father in law is always making comments about how I behave as a wife and a mother and just pointing at things going “mm”. that’s how he tells me to do something, pointing and saying “mm”. He doesn’t contribute to the dynamic of anything, just sits there. We don’t speak the same language but still, I feel like the exchange could be more respectful. The only time he’s ever praised me is when I did the dishes”without being told to” like I’ve done for as long as I can remember. I just feel like he so disrespectful in the way he interacts with me. 

I hate them I hate them I hate them. I hate living with them and i want this stop but I don’t think it will. I love my husband and we’ve talked about all of this before and he basically says “they don’t know any better”. I will also add  he’s talked to them about the things I have issues with and nothing ever changes. Everyone has to accommodate to their wish.

I’m also not religious at all and my husband is not at all religious like his parents are and it really irritates me that they push the religious ideology on my toddler.  MIL also calls my toddler “her daughter” and just does things without my permission and tries to override my parenting. My toddler loves bubbles, mil will take the bubbles away from her. It will 70 degrees outside and she will scold me for not having a winter coat on my toddler and then go put one on her. We have a kitchen stool for her and she’s not allowed to use it “because she gets dirty” 

Just needed to get this off my chest. I would ask for advice but I don’t even have any hope. ",80,1761851905.0,Marriage,64,0.88,False

A while back I posted a ""Failure o Failure"" post describing my hell vibecoding a script for my kid to allow him to cheat a bit at a videogame. The good news is that I was finally able to write him the script using AI but it did require a lot of context researching on my own to understand the complexity surrounding Wayland on Linux which the AI just could not figure out.

  
But I decided to go way deeper than a bash script. First I gave up on Crush as coding CLI. It's simply not ready. I decided to try Factory Droid CLI first with Sonnet 4.6 and the free 20M token credits and then with [Z.ai](http://Z.ai) GLM 4.6 Coding. OMG. It's night and day.

It's like having your own private engineer intern! I have to fetch my own coffee but he/she never complains. They are a bit over enthusiastic and I sometime need to slap them a bit but it's been revolutionary in the way I use my machine. When I run into issues I just use them for EVERYTHING PC & Coding related.

I'm working on a private project right now and the only thing that it kinda suck at is WEB DESIGN. But I've also pushed an open-source project on Github fully coded by Droid. It's a realtime voice transcription and optimized via Mistral LLM prompt generator. Nothing too crazy but the fact that it made that in a few hours of work is quite amazing. Heck even the readme is done by AI: [https://github.com/ajaxdude/speakprompt](https://github.com/ajaxdude/speakprompt)

It was pretty much the best cup of coffee I have ever tasted. Rich, smooth, chocolately, a little sweet, zero sour/bitter notes, fabulous amount of body but no silt. I was blown away.

I got home and now I'm obsessed with recreating that majestic cup of Joe.

I have used a Chemex for years and use Lifeboost, but I've never been patient enough in the morning to follow all the necessary steps for great pour over. So I ordered a Technivorm Moccamaster, and now I'm attempting to dial in the same factors that brought me the life-changing mug of Four Seasons perfection.

My first try resulted in decent coffee, no sourness, no bitter notes, generally pretty good, better than a lot of the Chemex batches I've made over the years, but too thin; no real body or richness. I also noticed channeling in the filter basket. I'm wondering if my old Krups grinder is just rubbish and not grinding to a good consistency, and not as fine as I thought. The water is passing through the grounds too quickly.

I see that I have two options: use more grounds, and/or grind more finely.

Unfortunately I can't tolerate more than about 16oz coffee a day, so this project is likely to take a little while until I have it figured out. 

Also looking to branch out towards some more premium Kona, since most likely the Four Seasons Ko Olina, Oahu was using some Hawaiian beans.

Anyhow, there it is. Thanks for reading.

I've been working on my startup for what feels like forever. Countless late nights, dwindling savings, and endless cups of cold coffee have become the norm. I've built features I thought users would love, but they barely got a glance. It's like I'm building in a vacuum, the feedback echoes for days but never arrives.

Sometimes I watch other founders around me, shipping new products faster and making more noise. It makes me doubt whether my project is just a shiny toy rather than a real business. There's always that lingering belief though, that maybe, just maybe, this could work.

Creating consistent content has always been a headache. I heard about automated video creation—like what HypeCaster can do—and I'm curious. Maybe this could bring some consistency and save my sanity. Yet, there's that nagging doubt if it's just another distraction.

I'm currently stuck at this crossroads. Do I push harder, or is it time to cut my losses? Has anyone been on this ride before? How did you handle this dilemma?

# The Magic of Cabin Escapes

 It’s not just about staying in nature; it’s about **reliving the feeling of slowing down.**  
 Many **Llivo guests** describe cabin stays as *“time travel wrapped in comfort”* — where the modern world fades, and the only clock that matters is the **sunrise**. This nostalgic charm is exactly what turns a short getaway into a **lifelong memory.**



# Why Guests Choose Cabins Over Hotels

* **Authenticity over perfection:** Guests are seeking warmth, not uniformity.

I am relatively new to the coffee and espresso scene. Moved from using a Keurig K-cup to a Breville Touch mid 2024 and have been super happy using my touch each day to get 2-3 coffees out each day. The joy i get from buying beans from places I am traveling to and then coming home and using them to pull shots is unparalleled, especially when they turn out to be really good.

When I was starting my journey and looking for machines, I saw that a lot of people on this thread recommended the Bambino + Grinder option compared to a BBE or a Touch etc. However, I was being stupid and thought to myself how much difference could it make - I think I know my mistake now. The touch, even with its conical burr baratza burrs does really bad for beans that are on the lighter side. The struggle I have had trying to dial in anything that is light is a pain and the waste of time and money is painful to experience. 

So I have been thinking of getting a grinder but don't want to spend a lot of money based on my circumstances. I started with a budget of $300 in mind and the DF54 fit the bill. Most of the reviews on here and other places are positive and most people like it than not.

I then got into the rabbit hole of the next best thing. I saw the differences between that and the DF64 and I like the option of upgrades (and hopefully longevity) that the DF64 brings in with that $150 difference. I do think that I will probably end up upgrading the burrs in a year maybe if I had that option and if it lasts me 2-3 years, I think that would be worth the investment.

I also saw the timemore 64s and a lot of people say that is better than the DF64 but that exceeds my budget a bit but I saw that they have sales on Amazon and their website which brings it to about $480 pre-tax. However, a lot of reviews that I saw about the timemore are a bit older and a lot of people bought it at a cheaper price through kickstarter. 

I want to know if people still think that at around $500 (if I get it at a discount), the timemore is worth the extra bucks compared to DF64? I think both of them have their pros and cons like anything but I keep going back and forth between the two and am just not able to make up my mind. My main aim is to have a grinder that will allow me to try and enjoy lighter roasts.

Just came here to look for recent thoughts/reviews of people that might help me make up my mind or maybe some options that I never even considered that might come up. Thanks in advance!",2,1761851067.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

Duck is definitely worth the hype so if you want to try order it a la carte at the bar. Land caviar is an exciting and special dish. Each ingredient separately feels weird but together, combines so well. Other than that everything was so salty especially the soba and all the “pickled” veggies on the plate. 

Even the service was lacking to my surprise. Three different servers asked me where I was from, one staff member totally judged me for saying how I loved caviar (in the context that the land caviar dish is almost as good), and they made us wait more than 20 minutes for a coffee because their machine broke down TWICE.

As the title says, I am looking to connect with new friends for online chat. All that I ask is that you be around my age, within reason. Oh and also, if you have any shared interests, that would be an added bonus as well.

I have recently moved to a new area, and being very socially anxious and introverted, I tend to not go out a lot. My interests include movies and shows, horror and sci-fi, like to watch the formula one and football. I'm also in the process of trying to muster up the motivation to start reading again. Genres similar to my movies and shows. I am a big coffee drinker, I probably drink way too much of it. Oh and I do occasionally play the odd game on Steam. Again, genres similar to the previously mentioned ones. Think that is about it for now.

Along with being introverted and socially anxious, I do also suffer from IBS, depression as well as OCD.

Anyway, if you think we would get on, and if you want to chat, drop me a DM, as I very rarely actually post.",1,1761850926.0,Needafriend,1,1.0,False

Did it help you? How did you feel on this combination?

I was diagnosed with depression a few months ago. I took escitalopram for a few months, but it made me feel worse. Then I tried duloxetine for a month, but since I’m quite opposed to taking medication, I decided to stop. I actually feel a bit better now, maybe still slightly depressed, but nothing like when I was first diagnosed.

In the meantime, I was diagnosed with severe ADHD, which finally makes sense considering how my life has gone so far. I’m almost certain that stimulants won’t work well for me. Even a lot of coffee makes me shaky, and my past experience with amphetamines was far from calming, quite the opposite.

Now I really want to treat my ADHD because I can’t keep living like this, I feel miserable. My psychiatrist gave me a plan: for the first two weeks I’ll take duloxetine, since I have some anxiety and she’s worried bupropion might increase it. Then after two weeks I’ll start 150 mg of bupropion. She also mentioned that if things go well after two to four months, we might add atomoxetine, but first I need to do heart and thyroid tests.

​My bf is in Subang Jaya and his birthday is next month, and since I'm in another country so I'd love to order a nice slice/small cake and a good cup of coffee to be delivered to him as a surprise treat.

​I'm looking for recommendations for
​a bakery or café in Subang Jaya or nearby that offers both delicious cake and quality coffee and it would be great if they offer a nice birthday message with candles and packaging and all.

​I've seen some big names like Secret Recipe, Baskin Robbins, and Coffee Bean, but I'd love to support a great local spot or hear about your personal favourites that have excellent cakes and brews.

 Thank you in advance, I appreciate anyone who could help me make his birthday special.",2,1761850875.0,MalaysianFood,2,1.0,False
1ok8ham,https://www.reddit.com/r/justpaper/comments/1ok8ham/trust_in_ourself/,Trust in ourself,"I think on some words I remember from a comment or a post in the ADHD subreddit.  We discussed how some days, the steps for making coffee are:

> 1. Make coffee

Other days, the process of making coffee is:

> 1. Take coffee pot
> 3. Fill with water
> 4. Pour in coffee maker
> 5. Close coffee maker
> 6. Put coffee pot back in coffee maker
> 7. Get filter
> 8. Put filter in coffee maker
> 9. Get coffee grounds
> 10. Scoop coffee grounds into filter
> 11. Close coffee maker
> 12. Hit start.

I found that fascinating at the time, because, of course, this was most of my experience.  I have made myself (and in many cases believe that the world has made me) small.  My will was small and could only handle the tiniest of tasks.  The concept of making coffee was so vast, so I needed to break it down into all the little parts just to think about it at all.  If I did not think of those steps, I could not make the coffee.

So, that is why we must clear ourselves of stories that are not our own.  For awhile.  Express ourselves and understand, clearly, what the story is.  Then, after some practice, your will will be big.  It will be able to handle the command ""Make Coffee"" and the process will happen within and without you.  You will not always need to be there to command yourself to do every little thing.  It will be big enough to handle bigger things for your self.  You will be confident enough to know you know what you're doing.

That is what I have learned.  This is what is happening for me.  I want this for you.  You, who sees yourself in my words.",1,1761850847.0,justpaper,0,1.0,False

She seems to prefer women, has no issues with the lady who grooms her (who loves her), she's decided she likes the downstairs neighbor (who also has a shih tzu) but she seems to be leash reactive to men in particular. She will approach them with caution, tail up and wagging, but then will react and snap at them. This has happened more than once and it makes me nervous because I don't want her to bite anyone. 

I'm planning on reaching out to a trainer to see if this is something we can work on but I'm wondering if anyone has experience with this and might have tips? 

I've taken to asking people to not pet her/approach her when we are out walking but she is really cute and portable and my plan was to get her used to being out with us and taking her to coffee shops/breweries so I would really like to be able to retrain/unlearn this behavior.

1ok8ezo,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenOver40/comments/1ok8ezo/pretending_to_be_an_adult/,Pretending to be an adult?,"Hello,

So I'm 41 and probably in many ways seem like a normal, functioning adult. I've always been keen to work, even as a teenager and have been in work since university, and I am now freelance. I have a lovely house and partner, no children. However, I have a feeling of being an adult imposter, I wouldn't say I feel like a kid, more like a teenager/young adult, who is spending their time trying to pretend to be an adult. It perhaps doesn't help that I've always looked very young in some way, perhaps combined with some personality traits (I've struggled with shyness since being very young) and perhaps to mask this I often fall into more submissive traits, like laughing easily at things others say etc. New people who find out I'm 40 tend to open their mouths really wide in surprise and stare at me. People have asked me my age for the last 20 years and stood aghast at my answer. A few years back, a friend said I could be 22. I think that was going a bit far, but I could see how it could be thought.  Only recently have I felt less bothered by it. When I go out, I often dress in a way to make myself look a little more mature, I think this is why I've been drawn to tighter clothing to emphasise 'womanliness'. But when, I get home, I'm relieved to get into comfier stuff that I wouldn't want others to see me in. I've had a lifelong issue with shyness that is still present, just less so. Throughout my life I've often been called the quiet one. This has always hurt deeply as I don't feel I am myself, I just struggle to talk much in groups still. In very specific situations when I can truly relax/trust (rare now) I feel I become the dominant one. When we get invited round to a certain friend's house for dinner, I sometimes feel like a teenager who has to sit at their parent's dinner party. In the sense that I feel a bit lost about how to engage. I often go red, even get a bit shaky if I'm the one talking, though it is definately worse with some sets of people who I feel are less relaxed than others. The older you get, the more it has felt like you have to be hypervigilant about what you say to people to avoid offence. A long way from the good old days of being an actual teenager and having free-flowing or stupid conversations. I feel like I often have to hold myself back because I feel like I'm just on a different wave-length to others. I find not being able to discuss things openly, without barriers exhausting. I don't often feel I meet people I really like these days, though I do still try with people I'm less keen on. Many people online say they like to keep to themselves a bit more after 40, but I don't want to. It feels as an adult that there are hundreds of social barriers. I want to have great, free-flowing friendships. Because I work from home, I often have this sense of being totally unattached to anything, apart from my partner and some original family. While I used to have friends I spoke to every night as a young adult, I now don't feel particularly close to anyone apart from partner and mum. I really want to connect with people deeply, but am totally lost as to how to do this with all the rules and constraints of adult life (and perhaps technological life). Even when you do go out for a coffee or something with someone, I feel that you both go back to your separate real lives after and you might not see that person again for ages, so it feels like there is no real shared experience.

No I mean my air conditioning unit is following me around. It started a few months ago. I woke up hot as hell so I went to see if my air conditioner box broke or turned off but to my surprise it was missing. I looked on the front yard to see if it fell but it wasn’t there. “Fucking crackheads” I thought in annoyance. I picked up my phone and decided to order a new AC box while eating some cereal. When I got to the kitchen I found it.

My Air Conditioner had grown legs overnight. It was walking in circles on long Barbie doll like legs that elevated the air conditioner to the height of a German Shepherd. It was blowing cold air at me despite the power cord dragging behind it like a tail. In spite of being weird looking I was still freaking out since my Air conditioner was walking. I screamed and tripped on god knows what and was cornered with my back to the wall. “OH FUUUCK NOOOOOO!” I screamed as my ungodly household appliance jogged towards me. I threw my arms up and braced for a painfully over the top B horror movie death with buckets of fake blood and shitty anatomy. 

After an hour of waiting I shivered and looked up. My AC was standing next to me still blowing cold air not doing anything. I stood up and started backing away slowly. The air conditioner took a few steps toward me in return. I walked towards it, it didn’t react. I pushed it back slowly with my foot but it just walked back over when I pulled my foot back. I kicked its legs out from under it and in response the creature kicked itself to its gross feet like a fighter in an old Kung fu movie. I was already fed up with this bullshit. So I took my crowbar that I keep next to my fridge and smashed my Air Conditioner until it was a mess on the floor. When I was done I looked at my watch. “OH SHIT I’M LATE FOR WORK” I screamed out loud before rushing to get ready. 

When I got in my car the air conditioning was waiting on the passenger seat keeping my seat cold. “Shitballs” I said irritably to no one in particular. As weird as this was I had shit to do today so I got in the cold car and started to drive occasionally shooting a bombastic side eye at the creature beside me. “Can you at least buckle up? There’s a cop up ahead”. It didn’t respond. 


It’s been like this for months and I’m starting to get annoyed. It’s winter where I am so I need to bundle myself up twice as much as what I normally would. If I want to start the day with a nice cup of hot coffee or end the day with a nice warm bowl of chunky soup then I need to do it quickly since it’ll get cold quick now. I had a cold the other day and I needed to bundle up with at least 8 blankets to keep warm.

No I mean my air conditioning unit is following me around. It started a few months ago. I woke up hot as hell so I went to see if my air conditioner box broke or turned off but to my surprise it was missing. I looked on the front yard to see if it fell but it wasn’t there. “Fucking crackheads” I thought in annoyance. I picked up my phone and decided to order a new AC box while eating some cereal. When I got to the kitchen I found it.

My Air Conditioner had grown legs overnight. It was walking in circles on long Barbie doll like legs that elevated the air conditioner to the height of a German Shepherd. It was blowing cold air at me despite the power cord dragging behind it like a tail. In spite of being weird looking I was still freaking out since my Air conditioner was walking. I screamed and tripped on god knows what and was cornered with my back to the wall. “OH FUUUCK NOOOOOO!” I screamed as my ungodly household appliance jogged towards me. I threw my arms up and braced for a painfully over the top B horror movie death with buckets of fake blood and shitty anatomy. 

After an hour of waiting I shivered and looked up. My AC was standing next to me still blowing cold air not doing anything. I stood up and started backing away slowly. The air conditioner took a few steps toward me in return. I walked towards it, it didn’t react. I pushed it back slowly with my foot but it just walked back over when I pulled my foot back. I kicked its legs out from under it and in response the creature kicked itself to its gross feet like a fighter in an old Kung fu movie. I was already fed up with this bullshit. So I took my crowbar that I keep next to my fridge and smashed my Air Conditioner until it was a mess on the floor. When I was done I looked at my watch. “OH SHIT I’M LATE FOR WORK” I screamed out loud before rushing to get ready. 

When I got in my car the air conditioning was waiting on the passenger seat keeping my seat cold. “Shitballs” I said irritably to no one in particular. As weird as this was I had shit to do today so I got in the cold car and started to drive occasionally shooting a bombastic side eye at the creature beside me. “Can you at least buckle up? There’s a cop up ahead”. It didn’t respond. 


It’s been like this for months and I’m starting to get annoyed. It’s winter where I am so I need to bundle myself up twice as much as what I normally would. If I want to start the day with a nice cup of hot coffee or end the day with a nice warm bowl of chunky soup then I need to do it quickly since it’ll get cold quick now.

I’m the only one out of all of my older cousins who is not married and does not have kids, nor do I want them. I was very clear when this trip was planned that I would not be babysitting for the couples, as I’ve been put in that position before on family vacations. One of my cousins has three kids (youngest was born a week ago), and the other has one child. 

Last night, my cousin’s postpartum wife announced to ur group chat that she had planned a couples brunch for the second to last day of our trip. I knew what was about to happen. My exact response was “Sounds fun! While you guys do that, I’m gonna take some solo time so get some coffee and walk/read/relax on the beach”. My cousin’s wife responded “Actually, we were hoping you could watch the kids!”. I told her that I had already made it clear that I would NOT babysit when we planned the vacation. If I agreed, I would be watching a seven year old, a three year old, a two year old, and an eight month old. That’s not reasonable to expect of anyone. She offered to pay me after I said that, and I once again said no. She then said “Well you can’t just leave the kids if we do go”, and I responded with “If you leave me with your kids after I said no, I’m going to call the police for abandonment”. This apparently sent her into an absolute frenzy and I got a text from my cousin about how awful that was to say to a postpartum mom. I said it was rude of her to try to put me in that position in the first place, especially without talking to me before hand. I’m sure she thought that if she pulled this where others could witness it, I would just go along with it. My parents are going and have my back on this, so I won't have to be defending myself the whole trip.

I’ve always felt that this specific side of the family thinks less of me because I’m 25 and not married, and also childless. I do want to get married one day, but I’ve always wanted a DINK lifestyle. I’m a teacher, I love my job, but I would never want to go home after working with other peoples kids all day and then deal with my own. My time is just as valuable.

Some back story: my grandparents designated their “mudroom” (not quite a mudroom, but it’s what they called it) to be the smoking room because the front and back doors were always open, it could air out and not really affect the rest of the house (probably not true but whatever, it was their rule). While chilling and smoking a cig in the mudroom a huge spider crawled by. I was alone, and terrified of spiders so I did what any rational 18 yr old girl would do, I grabbed my dab torch and torched the fucking thing (I do feel bad about this now).  


Fast forward a couple days. Basically, this guy and I had been hanging out but nothing ever really happened between us, and within a few weeks we both moved on (and I had actually moved). But during that time he came over one day and while we were hanging out, smoking and chilling with my brother, my uncle comes in to smoke a cigarette. My brother points at the spider and says “I’ll eat it for a pack of cigs” I said “fuck that”. My uncle says “I’ll eat it for 2 cigs and a couple hits off that blunt” I said “hell yeah”. And so this motherfucker goes and grabs a glass of milk and then eats the spider and washes it down with a glass of milk. 

Side story that this story reminded me of: once when I was about 5 I was digging up earth worms and went to show my great uncle a big one I had found. He asked me to hold out my hand to see if again, he picked it up, knocked it back and washed it down with his coffee. I was so scared I didn’t want to be around him for months after lol.

We got chatting and got on really well. To my surprise, she asked me back to her place (I'm not used to being directly asked like that). 

Anyway, we went back but nothing happenened, to be honest with you, I was a little spooked, I'm not used to one night stands. She was OK with it (so she said anyway). I was a little embarrassed the next morning so I didn't ask for her number thinking she wouldn't be interested. Some time passed and a friend of hers asked me about us and she suggested I ask for her number. So I did, and we got chatting and decided to meet up again. The problem is she lives 200km away, but I am up that way with work quite often. 

We have met a few times for coffee etc, and the most recent time was last Thursday. We get on great but I get the feeling she's not too interested. It's always up to me to arrange when we meet and when we do I am lucky to get a little kiss as I leave. Don't get me wrong, I am not expecting sex or anything but I would like to see some stronger signs of interest from her. The days I travel are long and I'm exhausted after them. I even suggested I get a hotel some time so we have more time to do stuff (granted that's a hint that she's welcome to stay with me if she wants) but she declined and said she has an early start in the morning. She lives in city so I even thought perhaps she might suggest I stay with her some time, but no sign of that. I'm really confused, she says she likes when we meet up and looks forward to the next time but I'm not getting much feedback from her in terms of a potential relationship or any real signs of affection.

Am I too blind here to see the obvious? I am thinking of asking is she interested in me but I don't know how to put it without sounding like some needy weirdo. I like her but I am also getting a bit weary of the 'chasing'.

Its answer to the current food environment is that the (fat / unhealthy) individual needs to find ways around the food industry's misgivings, alone. 

All of this makes us feel guilty and powerless against the food & farming industries. It probably makes us diss the few people who are actually working on the fringes trying to make the food system better, because we feel it's a lost cause. 

But let's formulate the problem & look at solutions:

*Bread, the staple food of Europe, US and parts of Asia, is cheap, plentiful and utter crap - stripped of nutrition and taste, adulterated with additives and enzymes and ladden with potential harmful pesticide residues.*

This section is an exercise in imagination and a trip into utopia. It takes fringe baking & farming trends and extrapolates them into the future. It is deliberately open ended - bring your ideas and your criticisms along - the whole purpose of this is to spark discussion about what a food system focused on nutrition may look like. 

It's based on the belief that *culture always comes before economics & politics*. Enough people caring about better bread create business oportunities. Enough people caring about better bread and enough businesses wanting to make better bread to serve them, drive better regulations, subsidies, research, investment etc. None of this happens overnight, but it sets the train in motion. 


******

But before getting into that, it's useful to understand what we're working with, *in their natural form*:

- Grains - they are not perishable and last for many years if their bran is intact; can be stored at home at room temp, if you don't have mice & insects around. 

- Flour - stoneground flour, with germ oil in, untreated with any enzymes, needs to be used within around 3 days if stored at room temp or refrigerated within 7 days. Or else, it starts smelling / tasting a bit funny & does not bake as well. For best nutrition, you'd want to eat it straight from the mill. Finely sieved stoneground flour (traditional 'white' flour) was aged in the past - this apparently improved baking qualities, but bakers were aware it's not that good for you nutritionally. 

- Dough - yeasted dough lasts in the fridge between 3-5 days, geting more sour with weaker gluten (worse rise), the longer it stays. But it freezes really well - you can mix & first rise dough, then freeze it. To bake, you just need to allow for de-frost, proof & bake.

- Bread - it's a funny one as it is both perishable & not perishable at the same time, depending on what you expect from it. In its soft, mouthwateringly tasty form - it only lasts for about 12 hours (not 2 weeks like modern sandwich bread!). Ideally, you'd want to eat it warm, straight from the bakery. That is why people in the past often bought bread 2x a day! Beyond the first 12 hours, the staling process starts, whereby the starch in the bread changes structure, which changes its taste. And bread gradually dries out. At this stage, it's still okay for sandwiches / toasties for another 1-2 days. But if properly stored in dry conditions (to avoid mould), stale bread never goes off. It's perfectly okay to eat if re-purposed. That's why we have stale bread recipes like bread & butter pudding. Or use breadcrumbs to bind any mince meat patties and coat meat before frying. 


***********

*Home milling*

This is not utopia - it can be done & I am actually doing it. Electric kitchen stone mills exist. Suppliers of grain exist, including organic. So with some sieves and basic baking skills, you could have great bread every day, made from fresh stoneground flour, from any grain you like, just like 1850s ancestors. Some people may dislike the baking part, at which point, bread machines are an useful addition, but they limit the range of what you can do. 

While it may sound like a wild idea to most people, there are places were home milling & muesli making is a bit more of a thing - Austria and Germany. That's where a lot of the home mills and cereal flakers seem to be produced as well. The reasons for it are varied - health and nutrition concerns, allergies or just an interest in baking. 

The advantages of home milling are obvious - it bypassess all of the problems discussed in this series. 
But while home milling is fun & results in tasty and nutritious bread, I am not going to sit here and pretend that it is either cheap or convenient. 

Mills are expensive to start with - I have thought long & hard before parting with the cash and buying one. If you are opting for a mill with no plastic parts, the price doubles. If you're wary about artificial corundrum stones and you'd rather have granite grinding stones - the price triples. But then you have a product you'll probably leave to your kids in your will. Buying grain, especially by the sack, is a lot cheaper than buying premium stoneground flour. That being said, it'll still take many years to recoup the mill investment. 

While it is probably a lot more convenient than people imagine, it's obviously not as easy as getting a slice of bread from a pack. With all the lazy baking tricks in the world (if you want to bake day-to-day, the key is to ignore all internet baking advice!), it still takes time. 

That leads me to its main downside - it's not really scaleable for more than 2-3 people, if bread was say 50% of their daily calories. Beyond that, home mills have capacity limits, sifting takes time, there's limited fridge space to keep dough, etc. So then you'd get into the realms of milling & baking more often than you really want to or have time for.

Also, if you can't be bothered with baking, fair play, you shouldn't have to. In fact, if better options were realistically available to me, I wouldn't bother either.

*High street mill & bakery*

For a long time, most villages & neighbourhoods had a mill and a bakery. This is still the case in places like France, with local boulangeries baking from scratch on premises (though not milling).

To get around the fact that flour and bread, in their unadulterated form, are perishable products, you probably need to engineer a system that gets from grain to loaf to consumer's belly within say 24-48 hours. And heavily regulate what can be added to the bread and how it needs to be disclosed. In this system, bakers won't realistically *need* to add anything to their bread anyway. 

The technology exists - the same companies selling kitchen stone mills also sell commercial mills, with up to 200-300kg grain milled per hour. That would be more than enough for local mill / bakery needs. Industrial sifters & ovens exist. All of that can fit into the larger high street premises or small warehouse. And the whole concept here is 1000s of years old, consumers love fresh bread and there is interest in baking as a profession. 

But the economics of it are pure utopia right now and have been since Chorleywood process was invented. A large artisan bakery loaf is around £5.5. That is 3.5x more expensive that your average supermarket 800g sliced loaf, at £1.5. I don't think bakeries can go above the £5.5 ceiling, even in the poshest of London neighbourhoods. The result - there are very few high street bakeries that actually bake on premises from scratch, let alone mill. 

That's a shame, because many *were actually started* just before the pandemic in London - there was a bakery revival going on. My local bakers, who were doing an excellent job baking on premises, have since closed shop. Though they had *people queueing at the door for bread, till the very last day*. They've also enlightened me as to why: landlord putting rent up & high energy costs meant they stopped making any money after 2022...

I am sure they are not alone - bakeries stay profitable only by turning themselves into chains asap, so they can scale production in regional warehouses that deliver baked goods to their local shops, that sell more coffee, pastry & sandwiches than bread. At which point  most baked goods are 7-8 hours old by the time they come into the shop & 12 hours + old by the time you buy them. At which point you notice your posh baked goods are not as good as they used to be and you regret forking out the extra cash. 

How do you get millers & bakers to stay on the high street? Making nutritious food is rarely profitable and culturally, we just need to get over it. Healthy bread is no exception. So it will require the 'S' word - subsidies - of some kind. Whether it's subsidising energy, rent, staff costs or lower taxes. Whatever works.


*... but, but, but the government has no money, so we'll have to pay more taxes for it. And government should stay out of business anyway...*

Agriculture everywhere is already heavily subsidised and has been for many decades. It is too risky and too unpredictable to leave it to markets alone. So are a lot of other sectors and companies deemed 'essential' in some way or another - from putting satelites into orbit, running postal and telecoms systems to remote areas, to steel production, public transport & even car manufacturing. The companies in those sectors routinely receive government subsidies, grants and tax exemptions to carry on doing what they are doing & keep employing people. That applies across the US, EU, UK - and probably everywhere else you care to look!

The invisible hand of agricultural subsidies is the reason high fructose corn syrup is everywhere in US, the reason the EU exports so much artisan food products and the reason you see 'regeneratively farmed' stuff in UK nowadays - whether you approve of or benefit from any of these things or not. 

I am no subsidy expert, but the one thing that is obvious about agricultural subsidies is... *they're not there to help you put better nutrition on your table*. They are about helping farmers & landwoners, helping exports or helping the environment (both of which indirectly, also help farmers & landowners). They may even work against you, either by flooding the market with cheap produce that can only be used to produce junk food or by pushing needlesly expensive products. 

So it is not about putting more money into it, but about directing the money already there to yield more benefit for you, the consumer. And hopefully even making some savings when the healthcare bills go down...

*Better industrial bread*

Local milling & baking, even subsidised, would still mean expensive bread. Though you'd probably still pay way less for it than your ancestors, as a proportion of income. Can we do better than this, price wise, without compromising much in quality & convenience?

We probably can, because we are way better at transport, refrigeration & kitchen gagets than our grandparents. So while producing *bread* industrially may not be a good idea, producing *dough* industrially and moving it around to be baked on the day in shops or at home should be a good compromise. 

As a concept, we already do this with pastry & some types of breads, which come in frozen to supermarkets and are baked on the day in industrial ovens at the back. They are then sold as fresh to consumers on the day. And consumers can buy say, frozen baguettes, and bake them at home themselves. The only problem is it's still got lots in additives in anyway. 

But it does not have to be this way. I am assuming the stone milling technology is scaleable enough and if not, that we'll find another way to crush rather than separate grain bits at scale. We already have mixers & all sorts of industrial machinery available to make any dough we want and pack it as we wish. I am not sure if as a business this would break even or would need subsidising - but the fact it's currently being done for some product lines makes me think it might be financially viable. 

Dough freezes well. Supermarkets have industrial ovens already and consumers have ovens at home. No knowledge is needed to defrost and put something in the oven. The only thing needed is full transparency on additives & processing aids used, so the customer knows what to stay away from. And plastic free processing equiment throughout the production line and ideally plastic free packaging too. Which is doable doable with good ol' fashioned regulation on label disclosures & food safe materials.

The bread would be more expensive than the current sandwich loaves in plastic bags. Perhaps cheap enough for everyone to afford while expensive enough not to waste? 


********

*Organic bread, for everyone?*

Pesticides, whether on grain bran or bio-accumulated elsewhere in the grain are probably bad for you, something we all suspected for a long time. That being said, any talk about growing organic staples like wheat at scale would normally label you as barking mad. How comes?

Well, the last time the problem of pesticides was brought about, it was by a bunch of long hair hippies & health nuts, at the wrong time. It was hippies against a growing agro-chem business, backed by satisfied farmers seeing their profits grow the more agro-chem input they used. And it all happened in a society enjoying cheap & plentiful food after periods of scarcity, guilt free & with no concern for their health. Led by governments patting themselves on the back that finally, everyone has more than enough to eat. Happy days, why let a bunch of hippies ruin the good times with their wholewheat bread?!

Oh, how times have changed! Now we have cheesed off arable farmers, dealing with sky high fertiliser & pesticide costs, staring at bankruptcy every year and pointing the finger at greedy agro-chem. And a very health conscious society willing to spend a bit more cash on nutrition (judging by the size of the dieting, gym & supplements industry!), suspecting *food* may be the problem. Led by governments scrambling to manage insane health and social care costs. 

Now that's a lot of stars that could be aligning here. Add some technological enablers to make it happen and organic agriculture may soon become an idea whose time has come. 

Speaking of technological enablers, since the prices of both fertiliser & pesticides have gone through the roof in the last 5 years or so, large scale organic farming has seen renewed interest, with a lot of farming experimentation going on. Nothing like a bit of scarcity to get the thinking hats out! 

Turns out well nourished plants plants tend to be a lot more resistant to common pathogens, compared to those synthetically fertilised with a narrow range of substances. So better managed soil = less pesticides needed by default. [that would not be enough to stop plant equivalents of the plague, of course, but enough to reduce routine inputs]. Also plants and bacteria, if put together in certain combinations, can be nice guys & help each other out to get more nutrition from the soil and to fend off bugs and whatever they may consider to be 'weeds'. Good on plants! 

But how do you improve soil? The standard organic answer to that has been crop rotations and fallow years, both of which reduce yield, or adding manure. There are other less obvious ways to do it that are opening up nowadays:

*Multi-cropping*

Quite simply, having more types of crops on the same field at the same time - like wheat + peas / beans. This is not some fancy new thing - historically, farming was done this way in many environments. The problem with multi-croping since agriculture got mechanised was that agricultural machines can't handle all of that diversity. In the 20th century it was abandoned in favour of mono-cultures, because it only made sense if a) it was done manually like back in the day or b) machines capable of planting & harvesting multi-crops exist. 

We are moving towards that kind of precision in arable farming machinery, which opens up the posibility of doing multi-cropping at scale. A lot more experimentation (& historical research!) may be needed to figure out who works well with who in the plant world, but it keeps yields up and the input savings may be worth it. It is a trend that has seen significant revival and attention recently. 


*Humanure & large scale composting* 

A.k.a. using human shit as fertiliser. If that grosses you out, well, rest asured that... your regular bread is likely made from grains grown using other people's shit already. Using sewage sludge for fertiliser is a wide spread practice in *conventional* arable farming. So much so, that when treatened with higher taxes, UK farmers apparently considered a 'sludge strike' - i.e. stop taking sludge in, to bring water companies to overcapacity and make everyone's life a misery. 

Spreading sewage sludge has got a lot of bad press recently because said sludge is not properly treated - meaning industrial chemicals, microplastics, PFAs and a bunch of other persistent pollutants could land in the environment and in the food supply. That is very problematic indeed, but there's nothing wrong with the idea in principle... if you treat the sludge properly beforehand. Who said sustainability has to smell nice?

Waste treatment technologies have been improving recently, with the help of another villain in this story - enzymes (yes, some of the enzymes used in your bread are also used in waste management - soz!). They can help with bio-remediation & generally, making things degrate quicker. As with your digestion, there may be unintended consequences to this one, so may want to test & thread carefully. 

And then there's compost, having a massive revival in gardening and small scale agriculture, for the obvious reason that it's free fertiliser. But there's no reason we can't compost at scale. Instead of sorting through 10 types of not-really-recyclable plastic, pretending it is actually recyclable, how about a compost bin? With a small payment for using it every week? We go through a lot of compostable bio-material daily that could be used to fertilise fields [though I would warn against compostable bio-plastics - maybe they deserve a post of their own]. 

Of course, none of this research & experimentation happens for free, solely driven by farmers with no money - governments have got in on the game of reducing agricultural inputs too. Through that 'S' word - subsidies. EU has a target of 25% organic farming by 2030. UK is more vague and talks about 'regenerative agriculture' & 'healthy soil' targets instead. 

Is this the first place I'd start if I wanted to support better nutrition? Is it the most impactful? Definetely not on both counts, because subsidies are about farmers and landowners, not consumers' health after all. But I cannot fail to notice there's more organic food options out there & they are more affordable than ever. Including organic milling wheat at £26 / 25kg sack, feeding two people a lot of bread for 2-3 months. And there is no denying that organic agriculture is starting to make some money sense. 


************

*Bottom line*

If you want better bread, you'll have to start by understanding bread and talking about bread. To your friends, to your family, to your colleagues, online, whatever. If you wish, you can try some fringe ways of making it better and speak to other people doing the same. 

That changes the cultural conversation about bread & creates demand for different products. Usually, it does not take long for farmers, bakers, mill manufacturers etc. to notice an oportunity. Just like they did when low cal, low fat and then low carb were the talk of dinner parties or when people jump on the new health supplement bandwagon. 

With a bit of luck, enough business interests may align in our favour and that may make politicians take notice at some point as well. Where there is a will, there is a way, and the solutions are not exactly rocket science. In fact - we may have done most of them in the past!

This won't happen over night - it will take time, maybe decades. The same applies for any change we want to make to the food system. 

But as long as we are distracted by CICO vs Keto & the new miracle supplement, and spend time blaming ourselves and one another for bad nutrition, *it will never happen at all*.

**Why This Pick?**

Given who’s in net tonight, I fully expect the Sharks to put a few goals in the bag over New Jersey. It’s looking like Jacob Markstrom (5.13 GAA) will get the start for the Devils, while Alex Nedeljkovic (4.00 GAA) will be goaltending for San Jose. New Jersey has scored at least 3 goals in their last 9 straight games, and at least 4 goals in 4 of their last 5. While their last encounter with the Sharks saw a lower final score, the meeting also had Jake Allen (1.93 GAA) in net. Unless the Devils decide to start him again, my money’s on the Over to cash, friends.

1ok7tis,https://www.reddit.com/r/familydrama/comments/1ok7tis/how_did_you_get_revenge_on_your_family_and_get/,How did you get revenge on your family and get exactly what you wanted?,"I've always felt like my family takes me for granted. They're always asking for favors, always needing help, and never returning it. My sister, Rachel, is especially guilty of this. She's always been the favorite, and she's always gotten away with everything.

Recently, they've been coming to me for money. A lot of money. They're always saying it's an emergency, that they'll pay me back soon. But they never do. They just keep asking for more and more, and I'm starting to feel like I'm being taken advantage of.

On my 28th birthday, I woke up to a text from my sister. ""Happy birthday!"" it said. But it wasn't a kind message. It was just a reminder that she was thinking of herself, as usual. And to make matters worse, she was out celebrating her half birthday with our parents, using money they borrowed from me.

I felt a surge of anger and resentment. How could they do this to me? Did they really think I wouldn't notice that they were using my money to fund their own celebrations?

I decided to confront my mother about it. ""Mom, can we talk?"" I asked, trying to keep my cool.

""What's up, sweetie?"" she replied, not even looking up from her phone.

""It's about the money you borrowed from me,"" I said, trying to keep my voice even. ""You never pay me back, and it's getting ridiculous. And now you're using it to celebrate Rachel's half birthday?""

My mother looked up, and her expression was defensive. ""What's your problem? We're family. We're supposed to help each other out.""

""I'm happy to help,"" I said. ""But you need to pay me back. And you need to stop using my money to fund your own lifestyle.""

My mother sighed and put down her phone. ""You're being unfair,"" she said. ""We're just trying to get by. We'll pay you back when we can.""

But I knew that was just a lie. They would never pay me back. And I was tired of being taken advantage of.

I turned and walked away, feeling frustrated and angry. But I knew I had to do something. I couldn't just sit back and let them continue to take advantage of me.

I started to think about ways to get my money back, to show my family that I wasn't someone to be messed with. I would make them regret the day they ever took advantage of me.

I pulled out my phone and texted my friend, Mike. ""Hey, I need your help with something,"" I typed. ""Meet me at the coffee shop at 2 pm. It's time we take care of my family.""

Mike responded immediately. ""I'm in. What's the plan?""

I smiled, feeling a sense of excitement and anticipation. ""Let's just say it's going to be a wild ride.""

I met Mike at the coffee shop and told him everything. He listened attentively, his expression growing more and more outraged.

""That's ridiculous,"" he said when I finished. ""Your family is unbelievable. What can I do to help?""

I grinned, feeling a sense of gratitude towards my friend. ""I was thinking of getting my money back, one way or another,"" I said. ""And I could use your help.""

Mike nodded, a determined look on his face. ""I'm in. What's the plan?""

We spent the next few hours brainstorming, coming up with a plan to get my money back. It wasn't going to be easy, but I was determined to see it through.

The first step was to gather evidence of all the times my family had borrowed money from me and never paid me back. I spent hours digging through my bank statements, gathering receipts and records of every transaction.

Once we had all the evidence, we would confront my family and demand that they pay me back. If they refused, we would take further action.

I felt a sense of excitement and anticipation as I left the coffee shop. It was time to take control of my life and my finances. It was time to stand up to my family and demand the respect I deserved.

Over the next few days, I gathered all the evidence I needed. I had a thick folder full of documents, records, and receipts. I was ready to confront my family.

I called a family meeting and told them all to be there. When they arrived, I could see the concern on their faces. They knew something was up.

""I've been doing some thinking,"" I said, my voice firm. ""And I've realized that I've been taken advantage of for far too long. You've all borrowed money from me, promised to pay me back, and never followed through. It's time for that to change.""

My family looked at each other nervously, but I wasn't finished. ""I have all the evidence right here,"" I said, holding up the folder. ""And I'm willing to take it to the authorities if I don't get paid back.""

My family looked shocked, but I could see the fear in their eyes. They knew I was serious.

""What do you want us to do?"" my mother asked, her voice shaking.

""I want you to pay me back,"" I said. ""Every last penny. And I want it done now.""

My family looked at each other, and then back at me. And for once, they didn't argue. They knew I was serious, and they knew they had gone too far.

""Okay,"" my father said finally. ""We'll pay you back. We'll make a plan and stick to it.""

I nodded, feeling a sense of satisfaction. It was about time my family learned to respect me.

We spent the next few hours discussing a payment plan. My family agreed to pay me back in installments, and we worked out a schedule that would allow them to do so without too much financial strain.

As we finalized the plan, I felt a sense of relief wash over me. I had finally stood up for myself and set boundaries with my family. I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I was determined to see it through.

Over the next few weeks, my family made good on their promise. They started making payments, and I could see the progress we were making. It was a small step, but it was a start.

As I reflected on the experience, I realized that I had learned a valuable lesson. I didn't have to tolerate being taken advantage of. I had the power to set boundaries and demand respect. And I was determined to carry that lesson forward in all areas of my life.

I also realized that I didn't have to cut ties with my family completely. While it was clear that we needed to establish some boundaries, I was willing to work on rebuilding our relationship. But it would be on my terms, and I would make sure to prioritize my own needs and well-being. ",0,1761849349.0,familydrama,0,0.5,False

We like the idea of being able to walk to some things like a coffee shop, restaurant, or a farmers market, but don't want to live right downtown. We also don't want super suburban either though.

We want to have kids in a supportive community with a decent school system. Ideally in a more blue neighborhood.

Eastside is very nice, but a bit out of budget.

We've been eyeballing the Edgewood area of Cranston (which is on the higher end of our budget), but can't tell if that's the best area for public schools.

Would love to hear people's thoughts on specific neighborhoods in North or East Providence or any other pockets we might've missed.

I’m 25, living in a cozy little apartment filled with plants that I somehow manage to keep alive—most of the time. My days are a mix of lazy mornings with coffee and a good book, and evenings spent chasing sunsets with my camera. I’m a bit of a homebody, but I love a spontaneous adventure, like driving to a new town just to try their local diner’s pie. My life’s pretty simple, and I like it that way.

I’m obsessed with hobbies that let me get creative. Painting is my go-to—nothing fancy, just watercolors and a messy table covered in palettes. I also love thrifting; there’s something thrilling about finding a vintage jacket or a quirky lamp that feels like it has a story. On weekends, you’ll probably catch me curled up with a fantasy novel or binge-watching a new series with a bowl of popcorn. I’m a sucker for anything with dragons or witty banter.

I believe in kindness, even when the world feels chaotic. Small gestures—like holding the door for someone or sending a “thinking of you” text—matter more than we think. I’m all about living in the moment, laughing at my own clumsiness (I trip over nothing at least twice a week), and finding joy in the little things, like a perfect cup of tea or a song that hits just right. Life’s too short to take too seriously.

I also believe in chasing what makes you happy, even if it’s a little unconventional. That’s probably why I’m so comfortable in my own skin, whether I’m dancing around my apartment in mismatched socks or trying a new recipe that’s probably going to flop. I’m a big fan of authenticity—being unapologetically yourself is the ultimate vibe.

As for work, I’m a boudoir and erotica photography model. It’s a unique gig that lets me embrace creativity and confidence in a bold way. I don’t get into the nitty-gritty here, but if you’re curious about what it’s like or have questions, feel free to slide into my messages and ask! I’m an open book for anyone who’s genuinely interested.

So, why chat with me? I’m a great listener, and I love hearing about people’s passions, weird quirks, or that one random story from their childhood they can’t stop laughing about. I’ll keep things light, toss in some humor (my puns are chef’s kiss), and maybe even share a terrible joke or two. Correspondence with me is like a low-stakes hangout—no pressure, just good vibes and maybe a new perspective or two.

Drop me a line if you’re bored, curious, or just want to swap stories about your favorite thrift find or the last book that kept you up all night. I’m here to pass the time and make it fun. What’s your deal?

1ok7sag,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1ok7sag/she_always_sat_by_the_window/,She Always Sat by the Window,"I first noticed her on the 6:30 bus from Mohammadpur to Gulshan. I took that bus almost every day for work, always sitting near the back, earphones in, trying to ignore the chaos outside. She always sat by the window, third row from the front, hair tied loosely, lost in her own world.

She wasn’t the kind of person you’d notice at first glance. But after a few days, I realized I was looking for her every morning. Some days she’d be reading a book, some days just staring outside with that quiet kind of peace that made you wonder what she was thinking.

One morning, the bus was packed. She got on late, and the only empty seat was beside me. She looked at me for a second, smiled politely, and sat down. I tried to act normal, pretending to scroll through my phone, but my heart was doing cartwheels.

After a while, the bus hit a bump, and her coffee cup tilted toward me. She gasped softly, and I managed to catch it before it spilled. She laughed and said, “Nice reflex.” I just smiled and said, “Guess I got lucky.”

From then on, we’d talk sometimes. Small things. Traffic, music, how Dhaka mornings always smell like dust and tea mixed together. She told me she worked in an ad agency, always rushing against deadlines. I told her I fixed cars at my family’s garage, which made her smile for some reason.

“You must have a lot of stories,” she said once.

“Mostly grease and engines,” I joked.

She laughed, and I swear that sound stayed in my head all day.

Then one morning, she wasn’t there. I figured she’d just taken another route. But she didn’t come the next day, or the day after that. After a week, her absence felt louder than all the honking outside.

A month later, I saw her again  not on the bus, but walking near Dhanmondi Lake. She was holding someone’s hand. She saw me too. For a moment, our eyes met. She smiled softly, the same polite one from the first day, then looked away.

That night, I didn’t feel sad. Just a quiet sort of peace. Because for a while, she made my mornings something to look forward to.

And maybe that’s enough.",17,1761849273.0,Dhaka,3,0.96,False

Now my budget is $200 give or take. I figured out that I can get 1zpresso J ultra or electric grinder like df54 (or Encore Esp or Fellow Opus).

I'm coming from filter. My go to set up for like last 5 years was Hario V60 paired with Timemore C2 (and Hario scales and kettle). Also occasionally AeroPress, especially for travel. Got some great cups with this set up.

For me the quality is most important. I want to get the grinder which will give me the best quality - most consistent grinds. period. Don't care much about convenience, just want best quality grinds 200 bucks can get.

I've been hand grinding for last 8 years or so almost every day, and I love it. So hand grinding not an issue. Besides the idea of economizing the space and not bothering of electric part maintenance is just so tempting. Also I'm a workout junkie - and the idea of incorporating a small workout during coffee process is another turn on. So my only concern is that will I get similar quality with 1zpresso J-max as with DF54 or Encore Esp. Thanks. I believe I'll have max 4 cups a day (for me and my wife). (4 minutes of grinding give or take, should be very manageable, no?)

Total Cholesterol:229
HDL: 63
Chol/HDL Ratio: 3.6
LDL: 150.4
Triglycerides: 78

Today, I retook a test to make sure I was on track and if not, continue to make changes and the results were:


Total Cholesterol:182
HDL: 50
Chol/HDL Ratio: 3.6
LDL: 118.8
Triglycerides: 66

I am an early 30’s active male. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that I was going to have to watch what I ate. So in May, it was a big time shock to me that I needed to make changes. I was overthinking everything early on. Being overdramatic about the changes I needed to make and going to the extremes. Went on a vacation with some friends and it opened me up to realizing I need to be able to enjoy myself from time to time. It’s ok to have cheat days.

Some changes I made: cut back on dairy intake, mainly with cheese and eggs. With coffee, use oat milk instead now. Read labels a bit more at the store and have significantly cut back on saturated fat and trans fats. Initially, I was doing overnight oats every single day for breakfast. But as you do a lot with diets, you get sick of it and revert to old habits. So now, I do that a handful of times a week. When preparing veggies for dinner, no longer put butter in to them. When golfing, my snack is usually apples now. 

I have been running for a few years now but with the sudden realization that I had to make some changes, I also modified my routine and have lost 10-12 pounds. I’m now about 176-180 depending on the day. 

I still will have my cheat days. Will have my pizza, a beer or two at dinner, go out to eat. You’re going to drive yourself crazy if you don’t treat yourself every once in a while. 

Overall, my advice to anyone struggling with cholesterol issues: there are going to be good days. There are going to be bad days. Keep going!",4,1761849220.0,Cholesterol,0,1.0,False

The novel is finished and I am considering possible edits before querying. The novel is about an infertile couple who use a faith healer to conceive, but things obviously don't go to plan with supernatural forces unleashed by the ritual.

If anybody wants to beta read the full novel please DM me with your email and I will send you the link. It is 110K words long.

CHAPTER ONE

The old woman moved around the younger woman like a withered wraith in the mist of smoke. She seemed lost in the strange words she recited, like a child hoping to memorize something before an exam.

On the floor Hazel breathed in the heady scent of incense. Her flesh had become numb to the cold tiles which had bristled against her naked back and buttocks when she first lay down an hour ago. She was within a circle of cracked egg shells the faith healer had scattered about, one of several eccentricities the ritual apparently demanded.

Her eyes were closed against the stinging smoke and Constance’s pale stake of naked flesh. The smoke and words tendrilled into her consciousness. Hazel felt herself billow along on the rumble of Constance's words, a ceaseless deep gurgling torrent punctuated by shrill peaks that emerged from the flow seamlessly without interrupting it. It almost seemed as if two voices were harmonizing from different ends of the spectrum.

She concentrated on the flow, latched onto a motif and followed it as it repeated, becoming both itself and its memory in a hypnotic cycle, slowly morphing over time to a new pattern borne on the guttural stream.  

Suddenly the chanting stopped. The silence that followed was stark as a precipice.  

Hazel flinched as an ice-cold hand pressed against her stomach. Her eyes shot open. Constance was hunkered down over her, legs either side, pressing the palm of her hand deep into the flesh above the groin. The old woman’s eyes were open, revealing only the whites. The unseeing cragged face was curtained by long strands of grey frizz, her small breasts sagged into flat triangles.

Hazel shuttered the sight with her eyelids. Constance’s chanting grew faster, louder, till it turned into grunting. It was like she was evacuating something from within herself.

Hazel drew in rapid breaths; the smoke trickled against the back of her throat. Her heart beat faster, harmonizing to the rhythm of Constance’s cacophony.

The grunting stopped and Hazel heard the phlegmy clearing of mucous, the gargling of spittle. The sound of spitting, and a wet sensation around her vagina. Dapples of damp down her thighs.

*What is this?* Hazel thought in a wave of shock.

Constance pressed her hand deeper into Hazel’s stomach, massaging it, kneading it. Hazel felt a pin prick of pain inside her, followed by an electric tingle emanating from that spot that travelled through her body. Her body was suffused with a warm hazy glow.

Constance started up chanting again. Loud and almost like a growl. The old woman’s black labrador Pooka howled from outside as if in chorus with her.

Constance withdrew her hand. Hazel heard her tread around her a few more times, the growl relenting and softening until it fell back into a chant. It became softer and lower still till it receded to a faint whisper, drowned by the dog’s barking, till the dog too stopped as if part of the performance.

Hazel heard the flick of the light switch, the door opening. 

Then Constance’s voice: “You can get dressed.”

Hazel got up after she heard the door closed. She examined the room around her. The cracked egg shells around the chalk circle. The candle flames still flickering, dried wax guttered down their sides. The silver incense burner smouldering the last bits. She felt chilled all of a sudden, like the cold she should have felt over the last however long it was had been stored up to be released all at once. 

She shivered, dressed quickly and went outside. Constance was back in her tatty old jeans and jumper, sipping tea on the couch. There was a steaming cup prepared for Hazel on the coffee table too. Hazel sat down, cupped it between her hands, felt the warm ceramic on her hands and sipped the warmth inside. She slowly felt herself coming back to her normal senses.

“It’s done now. We will wait and see,” said Constance.

They drank in silence.

After a while, Constance got up, moved to the window, drew back the curtain and peered outside. Dusk had fallen and Joachim sat in the driver's seat, face framed with spectral light as he read something on his phone.

“Shall we bring Joachim in?” Constance asked.

Hazel suddenly felt self-conscious. After what she'd been through, it would feel weird to bring him in and adopt the trappings of normality again so casually. She shook her head. Constance nodded agreeably. As if she'd passed some test.

“You two will have a lot to talk about very soon.”

#India is seeing a Avocado Boom, from Fancy Guacamole to Daily Toast

Most of us probably tried avocados for the first time as guacamole at a Mexican fast food chain. But post-COVID things have changed.   Indians started eating avocados on toast in salads, smoothies, or just plain.


#INDIA spent  just minimcal ₹250cr to Import about 12000 tonnes of avocadoes in FY 25. ⏫

Other key datas - 

1. 🇮🇳 Is 80%+ on  Import Dependent – Most of our avocados come from Tanzania, Peru, and New Zealand. Imports really took off only after 2017.


2. Domestic Cultivation is New – Avocados have been around since the 1900s in India, but commercial farming started only about 5 years ago, mainly in Coorg and even parts of Punjab (still testing crops).


3. Varieties – Globally, types like Hass, Fuerte Pinkerton etc, people prefer. India mostly grows Pinkerton or local ones like Arka Coorg Ravi.


4. Global Partnerships – Companies like Westfalia Fruits South Africa 🇿🇦 are entering joint ventures with Indian growers, especially around the Western Ghats.


5. Big Indian Players Interested – Even Tata Coffee is testing avocado cultivation in its coffee estates!



There is barely any detailed data online — it’s still a very young industry. But early reports say Indian grown avocados are as good as imported ones in size and nutrition.

What’s fascinating is how fast demand took off after COVID. No one knows the exact reason,  maybe a mix of health consciousness, influencer culture, and global food trends  but the shift looks permanent.

#We'll still import some premium avocados like California Hass, but with all this activity and local experimentation, India could replace a big chunk of imports within the next decade.

What do you think about this Industry 😀 and I still didn't understand one thing is 🥑a fruit or vegetable?  😄😂

Primary Complex: Karapınar, Konya Province, Turkey

Secondary Complex (Site-10-B): Köse Dağı, Ağrı Province, Turkey

Primary Function:

Logistics, Memetic Containment, Humanoid Anomaly Management, and Reality Bender Containment & Research.

Secondary focus on strategic operations, Foundation archival logistics, and rapid-deployment coordination across the Middle East, Asia, and Europe.

Total Area: 25.76 km²

Depth: 1.5 km to 6 km underground

Facilities: 25 subterranean sectors, 13 surface-level structures

1. Overview

Site-10 stands as one of the Foundation’s largest and most advanced facilities across Eurasia, operating as both a containment, research, and logistical megacomplex.

The site specializes in memetic anomalies, humanoid entities of varying risk levels, and short-term containment of high-threat anomalies under BHZ classification.

Following Project Basilisk Shield (2025), Site-10 underwent full structural, energetic, and psychological optimization. All previously known weaknesses — seismic instability, personnel desensitization, power dependency, and reality anchor saturation have been resolved through advanced engineering, metaphysical stabilization, and internal restructuring.

Site-10 now maintains operational stability exceeding 99.992% uptime, ranking it as the second most secure Foundation facility worldwide, directly after Site-01.

2. Containment and Infrastructure

Reality & Spatial Systems

Equipped with Tier-Ω Dantalion-Class Reality Anchors, distributed across all major sublevels.

Automatic Hume Field Equalization Grid (HFEG) neutralizes bender interference and stabilizes local reality.

Containment wings for reality benders now operate under triple-redundant anchor circuits capable of isolating 0.0001 Hume fluctuations.

Structural Stability

Foundation-engineered Seismic Neutralization Grid (SNG) beneath Karapınar Basin eliminates all tectonic disruptions.

Reinforced basalt-carbon composite walls and triple dampening hulls allow survival under direct Alpha Warhead impact.

Thermal control via Cryo-Core Cooling Loop maintains optimal 22°C temperature across sublevels.

Power & Systems

Site-10 is fully energy-independent, powered by three miniature fusion cores and a Hume-reactive fallback generator.

Power stability: 99.998% (independent of NATO/TAF grid).

All data infrastructure protected by Quantum-Class Memetic Firewalls (QMF) to prevent intra-network contamination.

1ok7m8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/1ok7m8i/cutting_out_invisible_expenses_saved_me_more_than/,Cutting out “invisible expenses” saved me more than giving up coffee ever did,"I used to think saving money meant cutting out all the fun stuff - eating out, coffee, subscriptions, whatever. I tried that for months and it never stuck. I’d burn out, feel miserable, and end up overspending again later.

This year I tried something different: I went through my bank and credit statements line by line and looked for things I was paying for but not actually using. It was worse than I expected. I found a $9 app subscription from 2022, a fitness membership I forgot to cancel, and a few “free trials” that turned into quiet monthly charges.

I cancelled everything and made a note to check again every 3 months. Between that and setting up automatic transfers to my savings account the day I get paid, I’m saving around $180 more per month without really feeling it.

I also switched most of my everyday spending to debit just to stay more conscious of what’s leaving my account. I still use credit for bigger stuff, but paying with my own money makes it hit differently.

It’s not a huge win compared to some of the posts here, but honestly it’s the first time saving feels consistent instead of like punishment.",16,1761848899.0,SavingMoney,4,0.94,False

1ok7hf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/familydrama/comments/1ok7hf8/how_did_you_get_revenge_on_your_entitled_family/,How did you get revenge on your entitled family?,"I woke up to the sound of silence. My 28th birthday, and not a single notification on my phone. I had been expecting nothing, but a small part of me had hoped that my family would remember. Apparently, I was wrong.

I got out of bed and began getting ready for the day. As I was brushing my teeth, I saw a post on social media from my sister Sarah. ""Happy half birthday to me!"" she was captioning a photo of herself surrounded by friends and family, holding a big cake and smiling from ear to ear.

I felt a surge of anger and frustration. My sister was celebrating her half birthday with money she had borrowed from me, and my parents were right there with her, smiling and laughing. Meanwhile, my own birthday had been forgotten again.

I stormed out of my room and into the living room, where my mother was busy making breakfast. ""Mom, can I talk to you about something?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice calm.

""What is it, dear?"" she replied, not looking up from the eggs she was scrambling.

""It's my birthday today,"" I said, trying to keep the hurt out of my voice. ""And I saw that Sarah was celebrating her half birthday with money she borrowed from me. Doesn't that seem a little unfair to you?""

My mother finally looked up, and her expression was defensive. ""What's your problem, dear? We're just celebrating Sarah's half birthday. It's not a big deal.""

""It's not just that,"" I said, feeling my anger rising. ""It's that you forgot my birthday again. And you're celebrating Sarah's half birthday with money she borrowed from me. Doesn't that seem unfair to you?""

My mother sighed and put down the spatula. ""You're being ungrateful again,"" she said. ""We're just trying to make Sarah happy. You're always so sensitive and dramatic.""

I felt a sting from her words, but I knew that arguing with her would get me nowhere. ""I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy,"" I said, trying to keep my voice calm.

My mother shook her head. ""You're just not willing to see things from our perspective,"" she said. ""Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to cooking breakfast.""

I turned and walked away, feeling frustrated and hurt. But as I looked at my sister's social media post again, I saw an opportunity. I had had enough of being treated like I was less important than my sister. It was time to take matters into my own hands.

I pulled out my phone and texted my childhood friend Charlie. ""Hey, I need your help with something,"" I typed. ""Meet me at the coffee shop at 2 pm. It's time we take care of my family.""

Charlie responded immediately. ""I'm in. What's the plan?""

I smiled, feeling a sense of excitement and anticipation. ""Let's just say it's going to be a birthday to remember.""

I met Charlie at the coffee shop at 2 pm, and we sat down at a quiet table in the corner. ""So, what's going on?"" Charlie asked, sipping on his coffee.

""I had the worst birthday ever,"" I said, summarizing the events of the morning. Charlie listened attentively, his expression growing more and more outraged.

""That's ridiculous,"" he said when I finished. ""Your family is unbelievable. What can I do to help?""

""I was thinking of getting some revenge,"" I said, a plan forming in my mind. ""Something that would really hurt them where it counts.""

Charlie's eyes lit up. ""I'm in. What's the plan?""

We spent the next few hours brainstorming and coming up with a plan. It wasn't going to be easy, but we were determined to make it happen.

The first step was to gather some information. Charlie had some connections online, and he was able to dig up some dirt on my sister's business. It turned out that she had been embezzling funds and using them to finance her lavish lifestyle.

I couldn't believe it. My sister was always so perfect, but it seemed like she was just as flawed as the rest of us.

The next step was to use this information to our advantage. We came up with a plan to anonymously send a tip to the newspaper that had been covering my sister's business. We would make sure that they investigated and exposed her for the embezzlement.

It was a risk, but it was worth it. My sister and my parents had been treating me poorly for years, and it was time they faced the consequences.

We put our plan into action, and waited anxiously for the news to break. It didn't take long. A few days later, the story was all over the news. My sister's business was in shambles, and she was facing serious charges.

I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. It wasn't perfect revenge, but it was a start. And as I looked at my phone and saw my sister's frantic messages, I couldn't help but smile.

It was time for my family to learn that I wasn't someone to be messed with.",0,1761848600.0,familydrama,0,0.5,False

Guess what he used  and broke.

He admitted he “might have forced the blade a little” because he “wanted a cleaner edge.” The saw motor burned out completely. I told him it’s $900 to replace. He said that’s “insane” and offered me $100 “to be fair.”

I told him to forget it, but he’s banned from my workshop. My sister says I’m “holding a grudge” and that “accidents happen.” I told her yeah, and consequences do too.

Now my mom says I’m “creating tension before the wedding.”

We've all been there, haven't we? That moment when the alarm blares, the world outside beckons, but your bed feels like a warm, inescapable gravitational pull. Your pillow whispers sweet nothings about just ""five more minutes,"" and the thought of actually putting your feet on the cold floor feels like an Olympic feat. 😫 You have dreams, goals, a vision for who you want to be, but some mornings, even the first step out of bed feels utterly impossible.

But here's the beautiful truth: that struggle is part of the journey. It doesn't mean you're failing; it means you're human. And guess what? This community is all about transforming those struggles into stepping stones. So, for those mornings when motivation feels like a distant galaxy, let's talk about some powerful, actionable ways to gently, or sometimes firmly, usher yourself into a day full of possibility. 🚀

---

### **1. The ""Micro-Win"" Momentum Start** 💪

When getting *completely* out of bed feels overwhelming, don't focus on the whole task. Break it down into the smallest possible ""micro-wins."" Your brain loves completing tasks, even tiny ones, and each completion releases a tiny hit of dopamine.

*   **How to do it:** Instead of ""get out of bed,"" try ""sit up."" Then, ""swing legs over the side."" Then, ""stand up."" You've just notched three victories before your brain could even register resistance! I remember one morning feeling so drained, I literally told myself, ""Just sit up, Maya. That's all."" And once I was sitting, the next step felt so much less daunting. Sometimes, it's just about changing your physical state for a few seconds to shift your mental one. 🧠
*   **Actionable Tip:** Before you even open your eyes fully, give yourself one simple, non-negotiable command: ""Sit up."" No negotiation, no debate, just sit up. The rest often follows.

### **2. Anchor Your Morning with a ""Why"" That Matters** 🎯

What's the *real* reason you want to improve yourself, achieve your goals, or simply have a good day? When the sheets feel too good, connect to that deeper purpose. It's not just about getting out of bed; it's about getting one step closer to your vision.

*   **How to do it:** The night before, or even in those groggy moments, identify ONE thing you're excited to work on or achieve that day, however small. Is it finally writing that intro paragraph for your passion project? Is it preparing a nourishing breakfast that makes you feel amazing? Is it sending that email that moves your career forward? Frame it as: ""I'm getting out of bed *because* I want to [insert purpose/goal]."" My ""why"" often shifts – some days it's to enjoy a quiet cup of coffee before the chaos, others it's to tackle a client project that genuinely excites me. Knowing that tiny spark is waiting makes all the difference. ☕
*   **Actionable Tip:** On your phone's lock screen or a note by your bed, write down your ""Morning Anchor"" – a single, compelling reason to engage with your day. Make it something that genuinely resonates with your personal growth journey.

### **3. Design Your Environment for Effortless Ascent** ☀️

We often underestimate the power of our physical surroundings. Make it ridiculously easy for your morning self to succeed by setting the stage the night before. Eliminate as many friction points as possible.

*   **How to do it:**
    *   **Let there be light:** If possible, use smart bulbs on a timer to gently brighten your room or open your blinds a crack so natural light can seep in. Light signals to your brain that it's time to wake up.
    *   **Dress for success (or at least, for the day):** Lay out your clothes for the next day. No decision fatigue, no rummaging. Just slip them on.
    *   **Fuel your body and mind:** Prepare your coffee maker, have your water bottle ready, or even lay out your journal and a pen. Give yourself an immediate, enjoyable first activity.
    My game-changer was a light therapy alarm clock. It simulates a sunrise, and even on the darkest winter mornings, it tricks my body into feeling a bit more ready to face the day.
*   **Actionable Tip:** Before bed tonight, choose ONE thing to prepare for your morning. Whether it's setting your coffeemaker or laying out your workout gear, make tomorrow's first step simpler.

---

Remember, every single day is a new opportunity to choose growth, to choose action, to choose *you*. Getting out of bed is your first victory lap, the fundamental step towards building the life you dream of. Celebrate that win, however small it feels! You're building resilience, one sunrise at a time. 🌅

What's your secret weapon when it's hard to get out of bed? Or what's one strategy you're going to try tomorrow morning? Share your thoughts, your struggles, and your tiny triumphs below! Let's empower each other to make those dreams a reality, one morning at a time. 👇

I don’t want this to be weird or anything, this is my first time posting something like this to Reddit BUT my name is Amanda and I am 32.

Of course being the ages we are too it’s kind of hard to find friends. We love going to coffee shops, venturing into book stores, and thrifting! We have two dogs and two cats so we love to go to different parks too just to spend the day at. We do RV life so we’re on the road pretty consistently visiting new places but our main base as of right now is in Sacramento. ",42,1761848470.0,Sacramento,16,0.83,False

My 3 hints:

We take fika very seriously ☕🍰

You can see the sun at midnight in summer 🌅

Flat-pack furniture and meatballs that’s all I’ll say 😏

My mom’s heritage :

Mint tea isn’t just a drink  it’s a whole ceremony 🍵

The streets smell like fresh bread, spices, and grilled food all day long.

One of our biggest stars? Saad Lamjarred you’ve definitely heard “LM3ALLEM.” 🎶

My dad’s heritage :

Coffee isn’t just caffeine it’s a tradition ☕️ (served with dates, always).

The heat hits different like hair dryer in your face levels. 🔥

We’re proud of legends like Mohamed Abdu 🎤

I will staying near UC Berkeley for a week in January. I will have Monday-Friday totally open and I'm looking for ideas on what to do. I've never visited San Francisco and it seems like transit makes it easy to get there from Berkeley. I love wakling around cities (I'm from Seattle so used to rain and hills), museums, coffee and tea, and food (but heavily restricted due to my autoimmune disease Celiac disease, so gluten free only). I won't have a car. I appreciate any input as I plan my trip! :)",0,1761848447.0,AskSF,10,0.5,False

The hardware store by my house does custom cut lengths of lighting strands too. Pretty excited about this lighting season. Plus, I splurged and got a coffee mug. Feel like a real company man lol.

1ok7bby,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ok7bby,Liminal Shroud Demo Now Live on Steam and Itch.io,"Hey r/IndieGames!

I just hit publish for the **Liminal Shroud Demo** on **Steam** and Itchio and now I'm stuck between realities. Send snacks...

**What is it?**  
Imagine waking up in a dream where your memories are scrambled, the furniture judges you silently, and the puzzles are smarter than you. That’s Liminal Shroud. It’s a vibes-driven, atmospheric mystery where you explore surreal spaces, solve puzzles, and try not to question your own reality too hard.

**Why should you play it?**

* Because your heart deserves a workout
* Because the soundtrack slaps (in a moody, existential way)
* Because puzzles are cheaper than therapy
* Because I made it with love, coffee, and way too many sticky notes

I’d love your feedback, bug reports, or just general existential musings. And if you like what you see, hit that wishlist button on Steam like it owes you money.

Thanks for supporting indie devs — I promise the game is only *mildly haunted*.",2,1761848219.0,indiegames,2,0.75,False
