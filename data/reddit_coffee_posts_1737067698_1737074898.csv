1. **Set a Schedule:** Start and stop work at consistent times. It helps maintain work-life balance and keeps burnout at bay.
2. **Create a Dedicated Workspace:** Even if it‚Äôs just a small corner, having a specific spot for work boosts focus and productivity.
3. **Take Breaks:** Step away from your desk for lunch and short breaks. A quick walk or stretch can do wonders.
4. **Stay Connected:** Schedule virtual coffee chats or check-ins with your team to combat isolation.

Just like the documentary, had to get through it in instalments, hoping to not get to the end.  The experience of the documentary and the book seemed like watching the home videos of your best friends.  Deeply meaningful, and often leading to deep thought and personal reflection.  Going through, there was this relentless hope that the ending would turn out differently and this gnawing understanding in disbelief that it just wouldn‚Äôt happen.  I really appreciate the stories and anecdotes and getting more insight to the albums and the journey of the band along the way.  It was tough to hear about the hard times.  The guys definitely have weathered some storms, and will always carry with them both pleasure and peril it seems of their experiences.  I hope that they are all doing well. It‚Äôs fun to imagine one day being in Kingston and running into some of the guys.  Having a coffee or a beer with them and talking about whatever - the weather, hockey, music and guitars.   Just Canadians being Canadians. 

Ive always been a fan but now I really enjoy listening to the albums in sequence and hear the evolution of the sound over time, across all of the guys.   It‚Äôs amazing to be able to listen to the albums and learn something new each time in different ways - I can listen for entertainment, I can listen to the songs trying to understand what Gord was getting at.  (I can imagine Gord giving that quiet half smile while sitting in a Muskoka chair by the lake - yeap you understand that song, I can also imagine him chuckling as I try to find deep meaning in places where the stories might be just superficial). I can listen to them building my own personal meaning and interpretations and I listen to them closely to hear the other members tell their part of the stories through their instruments and how they evolved over time.  

Amazing music and stories, thanks guys.

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm reaching out for help and advice as I navigate a challenging health situation. On December 1st, I was diagnosed with esophagitis after a visit to the emergency room due to some bleeding. Over the past six weeks, I‚Äôve lost 30 pounds, which, while not all bad initially, has now left me struggling to maintain my weight and energy. I worry that I‚Äôm not getting enough nutrition to support my healing process.

**Background**:  
Since May 2024, I‚Äôve gone through a series of health issues: sepsis, followed by pneumonia, and now esophagitis. I suspect that the massive doses of antibiotics I was given have significantly disrupted my gut microbiome, which I‚Äôve been trying to rebuild over the past six weeks. I‚Äôm not sure how successful I‚Äôve been so far.

**Current Situation**:  
I have significant swallowing difficulties. Right now:

* In the mornings, I manage to have an almond milk smoothie loaded with whey protein, powdered Ensure, and a few crushed vitamins (I use a coffee bean grinder to crush them).
* The rest of the day, I can only handle 100% thin liquids like water or broth.

Here‚Äôs what works best for me: I take two small to medium swallows, using my tongue to push the liquid down both sides of my throat, then I wait 3‚Äì10 minutes before I can attempt another two swallows. Anything more than two swallows tends to sit in the back of my throat and comes back up.

**What I Need Help With**:

1. **Nutrition**: I‚Äôm not getting enough nutrients to heal or maintain my weight. Does anyone have tips or recommendations on how to pack in more calories and nutrients through liquids?
2. **Pureed Foods**: I‚Äôd like to try pureeing meats, vegetables, and other nutrient-dense foods to make them thin enough to drink through a straw. Does anyone have tips on how to do this effectively?
3. **Healing Support**: If you‚Äôve been through something similar or have ideas for improving my situation (nutrition, gut microbiome, esophagus healing), I‚Äôd love to hear from you.

I haven‚Äôt been scoped yet, and honestly, I have limited confidence in the doctors I‚Äôve seen so far. I know some people have gone through dozens of doctors without solutions, and I want to avoid that if I can. My goal is to take control of my nutrition and healing.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. If any of this resonates with you or if you have advice, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it!",1,1737074608.0,dysphagia,0,1.0,False

I had been about a week caffeine free and was looking for The Drink. 

I used to start my morning with a large cup of coffee. At work I hardly ever drank coffee and if I did, I drank decaf. Then at home in the evening I often drank decaf coffee or decaf black tea otherwise I would not sleep. I never liked herbal teas as they did nothing for me as I was addicted to caffeine even if it was in small doses in decaf. 

Now I was looking for The Drink that I would like, the one I could be looking forward to. Especially in the morning and in the evenings. 

I went through Republic of Tea and found two teas that I liked:

- Vietnamese Cinnamon. It is lovely slightly sweet beverage that I make at work in Maison Jar and drink through the day. 

- Cardamom Cinnamon. This one has okay taste. But for me it was not the tea I would go to often. I can say it is not bad when there is nothing else üôÇ.

I happened to purchase Bengal Spice by Celestial Seasonings and was stunned by its flavor!!! RICH. Sweet. Insanely wow. Immediately I thought ‚Äúit is too good to be true‚Äù. Too sweet. I am also off sugar so I am not looking forward to start drinking it. I was investigating where this sweetness comes from. And google convinced me it is from carob and cinnamon. But‚Ä¶ then I saw it among ingredients ‚Äúnatural flavors‚Äù. Aha! So here is ‚Äúsugar‚Äù. Probably some other sweetener. 

I also tried Cinnamon Apple Spice by Celestial Seasonings . Wow! The taste is hmmm very sweet and tart at the same time and something else. Again, ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù. Aha! Also, in the ingredients there are ‚Äúnatural flavors‚Äù. 

I purchased Roastaroma by Celestial Seasonings. Now guys, there is no ‚Äúnatural flavors‚Äù in this one. Roasted barley, roasted chicory, roasted carob, cinnamon, allspice, and star anise. Although, as Bengal Spice it has Carob and Cinnamon, it is not sweet! So I was right, the sweetness was coming from ‚Äúnatural flavors‚Äù in other teas. This Roastaroma  is the closest thing to coffee drink. It has this very rounded taste with some bitterness in it. It is black - the same color as coffee. It hits the sweet spot just right. 

If you are not absolutely satisfied with water or chamomile tea or ginger lemon and are looking for coffee-like beverage, give it a try!

**TLDR & Summary Below:**¬†

* **Nikon ZF:**¬†The Nikon ZF is a powerhouse that I might not ‚Äúneed‚Äù. If I sell it, I‚Äôll miss its tech and RAW files‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs practical for my current lifestyle. Its bulk and need for editing make it less likely to be my go-to, despite its superior autofocus and versatility.¬†
* **Fujifilm X100VI:**¬†The Fujifilm X100VI offers a great all-around package with its built-in flash, size/portability, and SOOC/raw image quality. This makes it feel like the perfect go-out, social events and more dedicated photo days. The lens is loud, autofocus is hit or miss especially compared to the ZF, but it's manageable. The camera holds its value extremely well ‚Äì I got mine for retail while only waiting 2 weeks. I can sell it now, tomorrow, or next year for nearly the same price I paid initially. If I do sell it, I‚Äôll miss its overall package & offerings in its form factor.
* **Ricoh GRIIIX:**¬†it‚Äôs one I want to keep because of its portability, and the joy it brings in taking everyday pictures everywhere and anywhere I go. Despite its autofocus limitations, it's the camera that encourages me to take more pictures. I‚Äôve found my perfect 2 recipes for the Ricoh GRIIIX ‚Äì it makes me want to edit the ZF files to match that, and find a similar recipe to that on the X100VI. That‚Äôs saying a lot, because I‚Äôm really particular about colors of my ‚Äúend result‚Äù images.¬†

**In summary,**¬†I feel like I‚Äôm wanting to keep the X100VI and GRIIIX ‚Äì they seem perfect for casual daily shots to more intentional photography, both being practical and enjoyable to use. The 35mm of the X100VI and 40mm of the GRIIIX, on paper, are too close in focal length, but I love 40mm and could always crop into the X100VI. The ZF is technically superior in every way, but I just don‚Äôt find myself using it and the occasions where I DO ‚Äúneed‚Äù its capability and interchangeable lenses are so far and rare.

\---

**Nikon ZF (\~5 months ownership):**¬†Nikon 40mm f/2.8, Tamron 28-75 G2 f/2.8, Nikon 26mm f/2.8 (recently acquired)

**TLDR**: I‚Äôm considering selling this the most, despite having taken some of my best pictures with it on trips to New York & Boston. It doesn‚Äôt make much sense to sell from a technical standpoint (i.e., why are you thinking about selling the most versatile one with the best tech inside of it?), but I know that if I keep it, it still won‚Äôt see much use unless I go on more trips where its larger size + lens is warranted. I feel like I don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù this much power and weight, at the moment at least. For what I shoot, I‚Äôll miss the autofocus ‚Äòshut off my brain and don‚Äôt worry about autofocus settings‚Äô performance the most. I‚Äôll occasionally miss the f/2 full-frame subject separation and Nikon-edited files‚Äîthey have that 3D pop to them. I won‚Äôt miss its size/how it‚Äôs perceived. I just haven‚Äôt used it at all since getting back from my trip \~45 days ago.

**Autofocus (Major Pro)**: The Nikon ZF's autofocus is leagues beyond the X100VI and GRIIIX. I use 3D tracking + AF-C so often as a ‚Äòhack‚Äô for focus and recompose. I have to find workarounds for the other two cameras (e.g., AF-S, switching between single point and zone-area focus, snap distance focus, etc.). I customize the shutter button to wide-area (s) and back button focus on 3D tracking, always on AF-C. If I want a static shot of things in the center, I half-press to focus and fully press to shoot. If I want to recompose, I use back button focus & 3D track. It‚Äôs incredibly easy and takes my brain off worrying ‚Äòwhat autofocus settings/mode/zone should I use.

**Lenses (Pro/Con)**:

* **Pro**: Interchangeable lenses. All three lenses are sharp enough for me, quiet, fast, and confident in autofocus. The 40mm f/2.8 has produced some of my favorite images. The Tamron 28-75 f/2.8 G2 is light for a zoom of its kind, fast, sharp, and accurate. The 26mm f/2.8, though untested, appears sharper than the 40mm wide-open.
* **Con**: Lens sizes. Attaching the 40mm and carrying it around (ZF + 40mm) is a conscious decision. It doesn‚Äôt fit easily inside my jacket pocket or my Bellroy 4L sling without bulging out. I thought the 26mm f/2.8 pancake could solve this, but I personally prefer the 35-40mm focal length if I‚Äôm not shooting in tight spaces. I don‚Äôt anticipate using the Tamron 28-75 f/2.8 G2 unless I go on another long trip.

**Needing to Edit RAWs (Medium Con)**: I need and want to edit the ZF files to get the final image. For everyday shots, I don‚Äôt want to edit my images much beyond basic cropping and light corrections. Sure, on trips and where I want polished images, ZF files are a dream to work with and very malleable. But for social gatherings or casual outings, SOOC results are perfectly satisfactory and great. The ZF is allegedly coming out with imaging control soon, but Ricoh and X100VI have the upper hand here due to years of experience.

**Bulkiness/Perception (Major Con)**: The ZF is big and hefty, especially for someone with smaller hands. Combined with my lens options, the overall package is bulky. This bulkiness affects how it‚Äôs perceived in public. Even with the 40mm lens, I‚Äôm uncomfortable using it for everyday shots due to how it‚Äôs seen as ‚Äòwhy is this guy carrying around a big camera in my shop/why is he pointing that at me/etc.‚Äô With the larger size comes versatility and better tech, but the shooting experience of a big body and lens is a huge consideration. Friends, family, and strangers react differently to the X100VI and GRIIIX, which are less noticeable and more discreet. With the ZF, I‚Äôm much more conscious about taking it out and shooting, as people may feel I‚Äôm intruding in their space or act unnaturally.

\---

**Fujifilm X100VI (\~3 months ownership)**

**TLDR**: I‚Äôm considering selling this one second. If I keep it, I find myself taking it to family and social events, as well as dedicated photo days. If I were to sell it, I‚Äôd miss the overall ‚Äòpackage‚Äô of all the pros mentioned below the most. However, I wouldn‚Äôt miss the autofocus performance and hope Fujifilm continues to release firmware updates to improve it. While it doesn‚Äôt excel or stand out in any single feature, its overall package and form factor fit perfectly with my lifestyle.

**Lens (Minor Con)**: The 35mm lens feels a bit wide‚ÄîI often crop to 40mm or 50mm using the 40 megapixels. That‚Äôs why I chose the GRIIIX with its 40mm full-frame equivalent lens over the 28mm GRIII. This lens is softer than the Nikon Z lenses, which is noticeable when zooming in and comparing images side-by-side. It‚Äôs still sharper than the Ricoh GRIIIX based on my tests, but opinions may vary. Softness isn‚Äôt a huge issue for me as I often use a glimmerglass 1 filter at night and occasionally during the day. The biggest con is the loud stepping motors ‚Äì you can hear the motors turn and whine indoors or in quieter environments.

**Autofocus (Major Con)**: While the GRIIIX is worse in autofocus, I hold the X100VI to higher standards because it‚Äôs larger and more expensive. The 3D tracking with AF-C is far behind the Nikon ZF. I use, in decreasing confidence: AF-S with single-point, AF-S with zone, AF-C with single point, AF-C with zone, wide area tracking. On the Nikon, I just use 3D tracking with AF-C and don‚Äôt worry. There are shots I‚Äôm confident will be in focus, but are actually not when viewed on a larger screen. I hope Fujifilm improves their AF, but with a noisy and slow focusing lens, how much room is there to improve for the X100VI? I get the shots I want, but the hit rate is much lower than with the Nikon ZF.

**Pros**:

* **SOOC Images**: Although I haven‚Äôt found a recipe I love as much as the two I frequently use on the Ricoh GRIIIX, the images are large, have great potential for cropping, and are a joy to view.
* **Size**: While it fits in my 4L Bellroy sling without bulging, it‚Äôs not pocketable. However, I found myself taking it out often before I got the Ricoh GRIIIX. Now, I carry the 4L sling daily, which can fit both the X100VI and Ricoh GRIIIX.
* **Perception**: People may glance your way, but not as often as with the Nikon ZF. The nearly silent leaf shutter is a huge plus for burst shooting, and the camera as a whole looks unassuming.
* **Built-in Flash**: For times when I need fill light, whether outdoors or at indoor gatherings, the built-in flash is fantastic. Social media has taken off with compact digital cameras (digicams) with a fill-flash look, and I also love that look. I even bought an SB-400 flash for the Nikon ZF, but it‚Äôs not nearly as compact as the X100VI. Carrying a ZF with a 26mm/40mm and SB-400 flash is bulky and draws much more attention.

**Ricoh GRIIIX (\~3 week ownership)**

**TLDR**: I‚Äôm considering selling this the least. If the Ricoh GRIV(X) comes out and includes a flash, I‚Äôll immediately sell this and get that. Its usage:size ratio exceeds the ZF by far and the X100VI by a margin. I love taking pictures with this camera‚Äîit goes with me everywhere and anywhere. It reminds me of the ‚Äúfun‚Äù of photography.

**No Flash (Con)**: This would‚Äôve been the perfect digicam if it still had a flash. I‚Äôm considering the recently released Godox IM20 flash, but it‚Äôs non-TTL. While I could learn to adjust settings quickly, nothing beats the speed of a TTL flash for friends/family/social shots.

**Lens (Pro/Con)**: The 40mm lens is great. I could crop into 50mm if needed, but I mostly leave the pictures as-is with minor cropping corrections. Sharpness is hit or miss, likely tied to autofocus. Sometimes it‚Äôs incredibly sharp, other times noticeably soft and I‚Äôm wondering ‚Äúhow did it miss focus/where did it focus on‚Äù, when I'm shooting a static painting 3m in front of me. The X100VI and ZF are sharper, especially for nearby objects (\~close-5 meter range). Low light performance is very soft, and I wish it could open to f/2. Lens dust hasn‚Äôt been an issue.

**Autofocus (Major Con)**: The worst by far, but I‚Äôll address this in ‚Äúusage‚Äù. I use 4 modes: AF Point + Focus + Shoot (Touchscreen), Snap Distance Priority on Drive button (toggle), Full Press Snap at 3.5m, Select-AF with center focus on FN button, and Auto-area AF center (drive button toggle) ‚Äîall technically in AF-S mode. AF-C is just unusable.

**Pros**:

* **SOOC Images**: I love two recipes on the Ricoh GRIIIX‚Äîmy edited Nikons aim for this look, or similar recipes on the X100VI. For zero-edit shots, I reach for the GRIIIX.
* **Size**: It‚Äôs pocketable and goes with me everywhere‚Äîerrands, coffee shops, walks, etc. It encourages more picture-taking. While not every picture is artistically or technically ‚Äúgood,‚Äù it‚Äôs true that the best camera is the one you have with you. I can take a shot and pocket it back, or strap it to my wrist unnoticed.
* **Perception**: People in my age group either have, want, or recognize a digicam. I can shoot anything, anywhere, without drawing attention. Just yesterday, a random group of strangers asked about my ‚Äúdigicam‚Äù and asked about my thoughts/some recommendations. That was an awesome experience.
* **Everyday Usage & Fun**: It‚Äôs the most fun camera I‚Äôve shot with, possibly due to all the pros. Light, pocketable, unnoticed, and great for conversations. Autofocus is bad, but I treat it as a digicam‚Äîpoint and shoot without fancy tracking. The 4 modes are perfect for everyday/static photos, though Snap Distance Priority and Full Press Snap are less used.

I‚Äôm still a bit unsure about which has to go. If anyone has any advice or just overall thoughts, that‚Äôd be great. Thanks!",1,1737074095.0,nikon_Zseries,0,1.0,False

He works non-traditional days and hours, leaving in the early afternoon and returning late at night. He gets up a little earlier and always wakes me up with a protein shake and a hot cup of coffee, and I always stay up late to greet him after work and help him unwind before we both go to bed around 1am. 

Recently, I decided I wanted to start going to bed a little earlier to feel more rested for work, but the first night I did, my husband said he wanted to stay up longer, so I had to go to bed alone. I know he's valid in wanting to relax on the couch a little longer, still, it was the first time in our relationship we didn't go to bed at the same time, and I felt lonely and a little abandoned (I know this wasn't the intention at all). However, when I shared how I felt the next day --wanting us to go to bed just a little bit earlier-- he said he wouldn't join me and that he's never going to force himself to go to bed earlier if he's not tired. NGL, that hurt, as I sacrifice staying up late for him during the week and also force myself to go to bed early on the weekends, (because he works the next day and will fall asleep while we're cuddling on the couch). 

Anyway, the next night after that convo, I went to bed at 11pm (my new bedtime during the week/ before he gets home from work), and he said he didn't mind me going to bed w/o him. But I do. 

I'm scared that if we keep this pattern up, we'll barely see each other during the week and with his crazy work schedule, our time is already scarce. Am I overreacting? How do couples with different sleep patterns spend quality time together with only a limited amount of time each day? Any advice on how to not take this new change so negatively?

**TLDR & Summary Below:**¬†

* **Nikon ZF:**¬†The Nikon ZF is a powerhouse that I might not ‚Äúneed‚Äù. If I sell it, I‚Äôll miss its tech and RAW files‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs practical for my current lifestyle. Its bulk and need for editing make it less likely to be my go-to, despite its superior autofocus and versatility.¬†
* **Fujifilm X100VI:**¬†The Fujifilm X100VI offers a great all-around package with its built-in flash, size/portability, and SOOC/raw image quality. This makes it feel like the perfect go-out, social events and more dedicated photo days. The lens is loud, autofocus is hit or miss especially compared to the ZF, but it's manageable. The camera holds its value extremely well ‚Äì I got mine for retail while only waiting 2 weeks. I can sell it now, tomorrow, or next year for nearly the same price I paid initially. If I do sell it, I‚Äôll miss its overall package & offerings in its form factor.
* **Ricoh GRIIIX:**¬†it‚Äôs one I want to keep because of its portability, and the joy it brings in taking everyday pictures everywhere and anywhere I go. Despite its autofocus limitations, it's the camera that encourages me to take more pictures. I‚Äôve found my perfect 2 recipes for the Ricoh GRIIIX ‚Äì it makes me want to edit the ZF files to match that, and find a similar recipe to that on the X100VI. That‚Äôs saying a lot, because I‚Äôm really particular about colors of my ‚Äúend result‚Äù images.¬†

**In summary,**¬†I feel like I‚Äôm wanting to keep the X100VI and GRIIIX ‚Äì they seem perfect for casual daily shots to more intentional photography, both being practical and enjoyable to use. The 35mm of the X100VI and 40mm of the GRIIIX, on paper, are too close in focal length, but I love 40mm and could always crop into the X100VI. The ZF is technically superior in every way, but I just don‚Äôt find myself using it and the occasions where I DO ‚Äúneed‚Äù its capability and interchangeable lenses are so far and rare.

**Nikon ZF (\~5 months ownership):**¬†Nikon 40mm f/2.8, Tamron 28-75 G2 f/2.8, Nikon 26mm f/2.8 (recently acquired)

**TLDR**: I‚Äôm considering selling this the most, despite having taken some of my best pictures with it on trips to New York & Boston. It doesn‚Äôt make much sense to sell from a technical standpoint (i.e., why are you thinking about selling the most versatile one with the best tech inside of it?), but I know that if I keep it, it still won‚Äôt see much use unless I go on more trips where its larger size + lens is warranted. I feel like I don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù this much power and weight, at the moment at least. For what I shoot, I‚Äôll miss the autofocus ‚Äòshut off my brain and don‚Äôt worry about autofocus settings‚Äô performance the most. I‚Äôll occasionally miss the f/2 full-frame subject separation and Nikon-edited files‚Äîthey have that 3D pop to them. I won‚Äôt miss its size/how it‚Äôs perceived. I just haven‚Äôt used it at all since getting back from my trip \~45 days ago.

**Autofocus (Major Pro)**: The Nikon ZF's autofocus is leagues beyond the X100VI and GRIIIX. I use 3D tracking + AF-C so often as a ‚Äòhack‚Äô for focus and recompose. I have to find workarounds for the other two cameras (e.g., AF-S, switching between single point and zone-area focus, snap distance focus, etc.). I customize the shutter button to wide-area (s) and back button focus on 3D tracking, always on AF-C. If I want a static shot of things in the center, I half-press to focus and fully press to shoot. If I want to recompose, I use back button focus & 3D track. It‚Äôs incredibly easy and takes my brain off worrying ‚Äòwhat autofocus settings/mode/zone should I use.

**Lenses (Pro/Con)**:

* **Pro**: Interchangeable lenses. All three lenses are sharp enough for me, quiet, fast, and confident in autofocus. The 40mm f/2.8 has produced some of my favorite images. The Tamron 28-75 f/2.8 G2 is light for a zoom of its kind, fast, sharp, and accurate. The 26mm f/2.8, though untested, appears sharper than the 40mm wide-open.
* **Con**: Lens sizes. Attaching the 40mm and carrying it around (ZF + 40mm) is a conscious decision. It doesn‚Äôt fit easily inside my jacket pocket or my Bellroy 4L sling without bulging out. I thought the 26mm f/2.8 pancake could solve this, but I personally prefer the 35-40mm focal length if I‚Äôm not shooting in tight spaces. I don‚Äôt anticipate using the Tamron 28-75 f/2.8 G2 unless I go on another long trip.

**Needing to Edit RAWs (Medium Con)**: I need and want to edit the ZF files to get the final image. For everyday shots, I don‚Äôt want to edit my images much beyond basic cropping and light corrections. Sure, on trips and where I want polished images, ZF files are a dream to work with and very malleable. But for social gatherings or casual outings, SOOC results are perfectly satisfactory and great. The ZF is allegedly coming out with imaging control soon, but Ricoh and X100VI have the upper hand here due to years of experience.

**Bulkiness/Perception (Major Con)**: The ZF is big and hefty, especially for someone with smaller hands. Combined with my lens options, the overall package is bulky. This bulkiness affects how it‚Äôs perceived in public. Even with the 40mm lens, I‚Äôm uncomfortable using it for everyday shots due to how it‚Äôs seen as ‚Äòwhy is this guy carrying around a big camera in my shop/why is he pointing that at me/etc.‚Äô With the larger size comes versatility and better tech, but the shooting experience of a big body and lens is a huge consideration. Friends, family, and strangers react differently to the X100VI and GRIIIX, which are less noticeable and more discreet. With the ZF, I‚Äôm much more conscious about taking it out and shooting, as people may feel I‚Äôm intruding in their space or act unnaturally.

The Tamron 28-75 f/2.8 G2 is light for a zoom of its kind, fast, sharp, and accurate. The 26mm f/2.8, though untested, appears sharper than the 40mm wide-open.
* **Con**: Lens sizes. Attaching the 40mm and carrying it around (ZF + 40mm) is a conscious decision. It doesn‚Äôt fit easily inside my jacket pocket or my Bellroy 4L sling without bulging out. I thought the 26mm f/2.8 pancake could solve this, but I personally prefer the 35-40mm focal length if I‚Äôm not shooting in tight spaces. I don‚Äôt anticipate using the Tamron 28-75 f/2.8 G2 unless I go on another long trip.

**Needing to Edit RAWs (Medium Con)**: I need and want to edit the ZF files to get the final image. For everyday shots, I don‚Äôt want to edit my images much beyond basic cropping and light corrections. Sure, on trips and where I want polished images, ZF files are a dream to work with and very malleable. But for social gatherings or casual outings, SOOC results are perfectly satisfactory and great. The ZF is allegedly coming out with imaging control soon, but Ricoh and X100VI have the upper hand here due to years of experience.

**Bulkiness/Perception (Major Con)**: The ZF is big and hefty, especially for someone with smaller hands. Combined with my lens options, the overall package is bulky. This bulkiness affects how it‚Äôs perceived in public. Even with the 40mm lens, I‚Äôm uncomfortable using it for everyday shots due to how it‚Äôs seen as ‚Äòwhy is this guy carrying around a big camera in my shop/why is he pointing that at me/etc.‚Äô With the larger size comes versatility and better tech, but the shooting experience of a big body and lens is a huge consideration. Friends, family, and strangers react differently to the X100VI and GRIIIX, which are less noticeable and more discreet. With the ZF, I‚Äôm much more conscious about taking it out and shooting, as people may feel I‚Äôm intruding in their space or act unnaturally.

\---

**Fujifilm X100VI (\~3 months ownership)**

**TLDR**: I‚Äôm considering selling this one second. If I keep it, I find myself taking it to family and social events, as well as dedicated photo days. If I were to sell it, I‚Äôd miss the overall ‚Äòpackage‚Äô of all the pros mentioned below the most. However, I wouldn‚Äôt miss the autofocus performance and hope Fujifilm continues to release firmware updates to improve it. While it doesn‚Äôt excel or stand out in any single feature, its overall package and form factor fit perfectly with my lifestyle.

**Lens (Minor Con)**: The 35mm lens feels a bit wide‚ÄîI often crop to 40mm or 50mm using the 40 megapixels. That‚Äôs why I chose the GRIIIX with its 40mm full-frame equivalent lens over the 28mm GRIII. This lens is softer than the Nikon Z lenses, which is noticeable when zooming in and comparing images side-by-side. It‚Äôs still sharper than the Ricoh GRIIIX based on my tests, but opinions may vary. Softness isn‚Äôt a huge issue for me as I often use a glimmerglass 1 filter at night and occasionally during the day. The biggest con is the loud stepping motors ‚Äì you can hear the motors turn and whine indoors or in quieter environments.

**Autofocus (Major Con)**: While the GRIIIX is worse in autofocus, I hold the X100VI to higher standards because it‚Äôs larger and more expensive. The 3D tracking with AF-C is far behind the Nikon ZF. I use, in decreasing confidence: AF-S with single-point, AF-S with zone, AF-C with single point, AF-C with zone, wide area tracking. On the Nikon, I just use 3D tracking with AF-C and don‚Äôt worry. There are shots I‚Äôm confident will be in focus, but are actually not when viewed on a larger screen. I hope Fujifilm improves their AF, but with a noisy and slow focusing lens, how much room is there to improve for the X100VI? I get the shots I want, but the hit rate is much lower than with the Nikon ZF.

**Pros**:

* **SOOC Images**: Although I haven‚Äôt found a recipe I love as much as the two I frequently use on the Ricoh GRIIIX, the images are large, have great potential for cropping, and are a joy to view.
* **Size**: While it fits in my 4L Bellroy sling without bulging, it‚Äôs not pocketable. However, I found myself taking it out often before I got the Ricoh GRIIIX. Now, I carry the 4L sling daily, which can fit both the X100VI and Ricoh GRIIIX.
* **Perception**: People may glance your way, but not as often as with the Nikon ZF. The nearly silent leaf shutter is a huge plus for burst shooting, and the camera as a whole looks unassuming.
* **Built-in Flash**: For times when I need fill light, whether outdoors or at indoor gatherings, the built-in flash is fantastic. Social media has taken off with compact digital cameras (digicams) with a fill-flash look, and I also love that look. I even bought an SB-400 flash for the Nikon ZF, but it‚Äôs not nearly as compact as the X100VI. Carrying a ZF with a 26mm/40mm and SB-400 flash is bulky and draws much more attention.

**Ricoh GRIIIX (\~3 week ownership)**

**TLDR**: I‚Äôm considering selling this the least. If the Ricoh GRIV(X) comes out and includes a flash, I‚Äôll immediately sell this and get that. Its usage:size ratio exceeds the ZF by far and the X100VI by a margin. I love taking pictures with this camera‚Äîit goes with me everywhere and anywhere. It reminds me of the ‚Äúfun‚Äù of photography.

**No Flash (Con)**: This would‚Äôve been the perfect digicam if it still had a flash. I‚Äôm considering the recently released Godox IM20 flash, but it‚Äôs non-TTL. While I could learn to adjust settings quickly, nothing beats the speed of a TTL flash for friends/family/social shots.

**Lens (Pro/Con)**: The 40mm lens is great. I could crop into 50mm if needed, but I mostly leave the pictures as-is with minor cropping corrections. Sharpness is hit or miss, likely tied to autofocus. Sometimes it‚Äôs incredibly sharp, other times noticeably soft and I‚Äôm wondering ‚Äúhow did it miss focus/where did it focus on‚Äù, when I'm shooting a static painting 3m in front of me. The X100VI and ZF are sharper, especially for nearby objects (\~close-5 meter range). Low light performance is very soft, and I wish it could open to f/2. Lens dust hasn‚Äôt been an issue.

**Autofocus (Con)**: The worst by far, but I‚Äôll address this in ‚Äúusage‚Äù. I use 4 modes: AF Point + Focus + Shoot (Touchscreen), Snap Distance Priority on Drive button (toggle), Full Press Snap at 3.5m, Select-AF with center focus on FN button, and Auto-area AF center (drive button toggle) ‚Äîall technically in AF-S mode. AF-C is just unusable.

**Pros**:

* **SOOC Images**: I love two recipes on the Ricoh GRIIIX‚Äîmy edited Nikons aim for this look, or similar recipes on the X100VI. For zero-edit shots, I reach for the GRIIIX.
* **Size**: It‚Äôs pocketable and goes with me everywhere‚Äîerrands, coffee shops, walks, etc. It encourages more picture-taking. While not every picture is artistically or technically ‚Äúgood,‚Äù it‚Äôs true that the best camera is the one you have with you. I can take a shot and pocket it back, or strap it to my wrist unnoticed.
* **Perception**: People in my age group either have, want, or recognize a digicam. I can shoot anything, anywhere, without drawing attention. Just yesterday, a random group of strangers asked about my ‚Äúdigicam‚Äù and asked about my thoughts/some recommendations. That was an awesome experience.
* **Everyday Usage & Fun**: It‚Äôs the most fun camera I‚Äôve shot with, possibly due to all the pros. Light, pocketable, unnoticed, and great for conversations. Autofocus is bad, but I treat it as a digicam‚Äîpoint and shoot without fancy tracking. The 4 modes are perfect for everyday/static photos, though Snap Distance Priority and Full Press Snap are less used.

I‚Äôm still a bit unsure about which has to go. If anyone has any advice or just overall thoughts, that‚Äôd be great. Thanks!",0,1737073874.0,fujifilm,0,0.5,False

If you stub your toe on the coffee table leg, you may cuss like a sailor and possibly cry your eyes out, but you aren‚Äôt emotionally disturbed afterward because you know the coffee table isn‚Äôt going to come alive and do it again to try to physically assault you. After that happens to someone, I think it‚Äôs a misconception that the physical pain alone is what caused the trauma. (I know there are some situations out there that only include pain that traumatizes people, such as car accidents and near-death experiences, but I‚Äôm just talking about abuse.) Yes, the pain the parent or anyone else put into someone hurts, but what leaves you shaken is the fear that they can do it again and you‚Äôll have to go through it again. The fear is literally mental, and some fear for their lives, sadly, in these situations around physical abusers, and some live with the threat of something happening to them, which is ‚Äúmental abuse.‚Äù Of course, it is mental. I grew up rarely beaten but always mentally abused: things like weapons being pulled on me (not used), getting locked in a room and cussed at to where a fly wouldn‚Äôt land on me, and if I stopped reacting to getting cussed out, my abuser knew how to hold something over my head so I would be afraid of seeing them mad again, such as a physical threat or threatening to hurt someone I care about or taking away someone I need. My abuser also helped an adult groom me as a child and handed me over to him, letting other people hurt me. I came out of all this alive, at first saying what they all do: ‚Äúthe mental was the worst; it‚Äôs worse than physical.‚Äù Then I realized all of us who were abused were all abused, and we were all shaken and hurt, and all of it affects the damn mental. No need to compare anymore, people. Either if you have been physically hurt or mentally hurt, you are mentally hurt and carry trauma and PTSD and all that lonely bullshit we put up with to this day! I‚Äôve met people who were physically abused as much as I was mentally, and we are both mentally hurt and show the exact same signs of what abuse does to you in our behavior and thinking. So guess what? You‚Äôre getting mentally abused/have been? Guess what, you‚Äôre valid, and what you‚Äôre going through is awful. And what if you‚Äôre being physically abused/have been? And please don‚Äôt say ‚Äúmental is worse.‚Äù Guess what? You were literally mentally abused too, on top of the physical pain. For the division out there between those who only experienced mental abuse and those who experienced physical abuse: you both were literally scared to death, hurt people with your brains being torn apart, who probably were confused because you couldn‚Äôt think properly at the time and more than likely couldn‚Äôt find a way out or were struggling to. So please don‚Äôt compare anymore! Neither survivor of either is that much different from one another with what they deal with or dealt with upstairs. Don‚Äôt let anyone tell either of you, ‚Äúat least you didn‚Äôt get hit‚Äù or ‚Äúmental is worse; I would rather get hit.‚Äù Guess what? I would have rather gotten hit too, but maybe by something falling on me and hurting like a motherfucker, not by a human who had me right where they wanted me and could do it again.

1i33qtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1i33qtw/my_job_is_under_training_me_and_now_i_am_taking/,My job is under training me and now I am taking the punches,"I (24f) started a new job as an administrative assistant 2 months ago and I already want to find something else.

I moved back to my home state at the end of October and spent 3 weeks on a mad hunt for a job, any job. The company I'm with now called me in for an interview, offered me a job practically on the spot, and was willing to pay me more than what they posted after some negotiation. They also had great benefits, and this is in an industry I have some experience in, so thought I scored. I definitely saw them wanting to hire me right away as a red flag, but I needed to work as soon as possible, so I took it with plans to keep applying elsewhere in case this doesn‚Äôt work out.

Flash forward to today, I have not been trained for any actual work and I am at a breaking point. The main points of my position are to answer the phone and direct calls to people in the office, run errands as needed, and keep the office and kitchen space stocked and organized. Of course that is not enough to fill 40 hours a week, so they assured me that they will cross train me to do project coordinator tasks as well, and eventually I would be more involved in the business. They know of my previous experience in this industry, so they said they were looking forward to having me learn more and eventually move away from the front reception desk and really be a part of the team. Well, it‚Äôs been two months and all I have done is answer the phone, run errands, and make sure their precious snack tray is fully stocked every day. I have had a few side missions here and there, mostly busy work like shredding old papers and picking up coffee for the office. The majority of my days are spent sitting at my desk in silence with no tasks.

Early on I got bored, and I just started looking at my phone pretty much all day every day. Some days I‚Äôve even brought in a book; I started and finished 3 books on the clock within a week and a half last month. I was worried someone was going to reprimand me for not working, but no one ever has. In fact, the president of the company walked past my desk and stopped to ask what book I‚Äôm reading, and he was genuinely interested in the plot of the book when I explained it to him.

Several times, I have gone to the gal who is supposed to be training me and asked for something, anything to do. Every time, I am just told to check on the supplies and the kitchen, stuff I do anyways that takes no more than 5 minutes. Today my manager came up to me and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve gotten some complaints about you reading at your desk. So we need to find some ways to keep you busy.‚Äô I was a little speechless, I just blinked at her and said ‚Äúyeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I was so irritated by this, like we do you mean ‚Äòwe‚Äô, you are the one that hasn‚Äôt given me anything to do. I‚Äôm not responsible for the fact that I just sit here all day, clearly bored out of my mind. I have tried to take the reins and ask for some training and I am turned down or given quick busy work instead. After this, I begged the gal that is supposed to train me, and even mentioned that I was told basically that I have too much free time, and she just brushed me off again, and said she had some small tasks that maybe I could help with.

At this point I am just desperate for a new job. I can‚Äôt just sit at a desk doing nothing long term. And I‚Äôm not gaining any skills by being here, I have nothing to show for when I do eventually interview elsewhere. It‚Äôs embarrassing to be honest, they are making out to feel like a total slacker. 

Additionally, my manager and my ‚Äòtrainer‚Äô are mother and daughter, so I can‚Äôt even complain about one to the other, and I worry that they‚Äôll team up on me at some point and make it even more miserable for me here. I feel like they only hired me because they wanted a dog to do their chores for them, and now that my lack of responsibilities is being noticed by other people, they‚Äôre telling me that I‚Äôm the one doing something wrong.

2. **Biography:**¬†Khan was one of the witnesses to the explosion of the Copper-9 core. Some time later, at Camp 98.7, he met Nori, his future wife, who wore a strange necklace with the number ""002"", but he did not notice it. After a while, they got a daughter named Uzi. At the same time, Nori began having strange visions about the invasion of¬†the DDs on the planet, which scared him. She forced him to build doors to protect himself from the ""heavenly demons."" Khan created the organization ""Worker Defense Force"" and erected a bunker with super-strong doors. These doors have become the main defense against Murder Drones. Unfortunately, Nori could be quite reckless and without warning went on sorties with other drones in order to distract herself from her terrible visions. It happened that she went very far from the colony, which is why she did not have time to return before nightfall. One of these sorties became fatal for her: one of the Disassembly Drones stung her with nanitic acid (one of the weaknesses of the Solver, which does not allow the carrier to regenerate itself). She tried to get to the colony as quickly as possible, but Khan had to leave Nori outside the bunker, not allowing her to enter and let the DDs in. He lied to Uzi about it, making up a legend about how Nori heroically sacrificed herself for the colony, and that he supposedly decided to follow her example. Khan felt guilty for his cowardice for a long time, because he was well aware that he had the opportunity to save his wife, which is why he immersed himself in his work, devoting very little time to Uzi. He tried on the role of a kind of ""savior of his people,"" which further distanced him from his daughter and led to the fact that she grew up an outcast.
3. **Appearance:**¬†He wears a gray WDF jacket, a gray hard hat, special red glasses on his head, black boots, a fake mustache, neon-white eyes. On the visor, furrows are visible in the forehead area, which form ""wrinkles"".
4. **Friends:**¬†Nori (wife), Uzi (daughter), Doll's Father, WDF Staff: Ron, Sarah, Eva, Todd, Braxton, Makarov, Chris¬†(aka Unnamed WDF drone)
5. **Enemies:**¬†Disassembly Drones
6. **Abilities:**¬†Good at engineering
7. **Weaknesses:**¬†strong fear of disassembly drones, paranoia, stubbornness and firm confidence in his own beliefs
8. **Likes:**¬†Drinking coffee, chatting with his colleagues, playing the hero
9. **Dislikes:** disassembly drones, Nori's and Uzi's antics, being called to school because of Uzi, distracting him from work, hiding the truth from Uzi

1i33kpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShrugLifeSyndicate/comments/1i33kpo/the_general_short_story_based_on_a_kafkaesque/,THE GENERAL - short story based on a Kafkaesque dream I had,"It was nearing midnight, and all was dark at the offices of the PDCO (Planetary Defense Coordination Office). The lights were always set to disable at 10pm sharp, which annoyed Johnson, whose shift ran from 10pm to 6am.

Johnson felt that he was not respected at this workplace. He was smart, diligent, and punctual, and his Masters degrees in astrophysics and computer science distinguished himself from many others in this field. However, having dedicated his life to his studies, he had grown into a fat, sweaty bald man with a high-pitched, squeaky voice and a perpetually shaky, anxious disposition. He had no girlfriend, no family, and no social life outside of work. Nevertheless, Johnson was proud of his academic achievements and believed his position at the PDCO to be both admirable and important to the world.

Johnson stared at his computer screen, illuminating his face in the indigo-shaded darkness of the room. He took a sip of his sweet milky coffee and a handful of some Cheez-Its while trying to shut out the sounds of the janitors vacuuming the neighboring offices. His job was easy, but dull; he had to monitor the skies for any chance of an NEO (near Earth object). He analyzed data from various telescopes across the world to detect any objects that could potentially impact the Earth. There were often many NEOs to be found, but it was unbelievably rare to find one headed directly towards the Earth; most just zipped on by without ever acknowledging this world teeming with life.

The phone rang, shocking Johnson out of his staring contest with his computer screen. Calls were rare, especially during the night shift, so Johnson felt a tremor of anxiety jolt through him. His clumsy hand reached awkwardly for the receiver, which slipped through his clammy palm, clattering on his desk. Johnson could hear a loud, gruff voice yelling through the phone: ‚ÄúGod damn it, Johnson! Did you drop the phone again?! Sounded like a damn gunshot going off in my ear, you baboon!‚Äù

Johnson finally maintained his grip on the phone and held it up to his ear; his clumsiness had caused him to sweat even more profusely.

‚ÄúYes sir, sorry sir,‚Äù Johnson had a tendency to be overly formal with his superiors, much to their annoyance. The man on the phone was Donaldson, his rigid and loud-mouthed supervisor. ‚ÄúSo, why are you calling? You never-‚Äú

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably wondering why I‚Äôm calling so late,‚Äù Donaldson interrupted. ‚ÄúI have important news. The General is coming.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe General?‚Äù Johnson had no idea who ‚ÄòThe General‚Äô was supposed to be. ‚ÄúAs in‚Ä¶ the U.S. military?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was supposed to arrive earlier, but his flight was delayed,‚Äù Donaldson said, ignoring Johnson‚Äôs queries. ‚ÄúHis time is limited, so he would still like a tour of our offices even though it‚Äôs after hours. I practically begged him to come tomorrow, but he insisted on visiting tonight. Since you‚Äôre the only one on duty, the task will fall to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe? But sir, you know I have to constantly monitor-‚Äú

‚ÄúJohnson, this is The General we‚Äôre talking about. His presence takes precedence over your duties. We have no other options.‚Äù

‚ÄúW-well‚Ä¶ Okay‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúFantastic,‚Äù said Donaldson, his voice dripping with condescension. ‚ÄúOh, and one more thing: you‚Äôve probably seen the Cheez-It snack bags that were left out on the breakroom table. Those are for day shift only. You are not to have any. We made sure to count them.‚Äù

Johnson gulped, looking down at the empty snack bag in his wastebin underneath his desk. ‚ÄúGuh‚Ä¶ Yes, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod knows you don‚Äôt need any more snacks, you fat bastard.‚Äù Donaldson suddenly roared an evil, scathing laugh that sounded like a vicious Rottweiler barking at a bird. ‚ÄúAnyways, I‚Äôm going to sleep. Don‚Äôt call me if you need anything.‚Äù

The line went dead.

Johnson, temporarily relieved to not be on a call with his boss any longer, had another pang of anxiety after realizing he hadn‚Äôt asked what the General was supposed to look like, his real name, his age, nothing. The General could be anyone. Johnson hoped it would be painfully obvious when the General arrived.

His computer began beeping, alerting him that an NEO had been spotted. This, again, was not abnormal; the computer found NEOs all the time. But as soon as Johnson focused in on what the computer had located, he nearly passed out in his chair. His heart jumped out of his chest. His minor sweat beads turned into a raging waterfall. His armpits moistened, his pupils dilated, his nipples hardened, and his hands began shaking with the ferocity of a 9.8 eathquake.

A massive asteroid. Hurtling directly towards Earth.

There was no mistaking it: the computer does the math well, but Johnson ran a few ancillary tests to confirm. Indeed, the asteroid was on a collision course with the Earth, and would collide within a day or two, based on its relative speed. It was huge; perhaps 2.5 - 3 kilometers wide. Typically, asteroids that size could be detected years, or even decades, in advance, but this asteroid appeared to be approaching from the direction of the Sun - what all astronomers know to be called the ‚Äúsolar blind spot‚Äù. This was indubitably the worst-case scenario.

Johnson, who had trained for this moment his whole life, sprang into action. He immediately called dispatch, who would connect him to the U.S. military. A bored woman answered his call.

‚ÄúDispatch.‚Äù she moaned dully.

‚ÄúYes, this is J-Johnson from the Arizona PDCO,‚Äù Johnson spit the words out frantically, trying and failing to maintain his composure. ‚ÄúThere is a massive asteroid heading towards Earth, I need to speak to a high-ranking officer in the military immediately.‚Äù

The lady did not seem fazed. ‚ÄúYou said Johnson?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam, Johnson from the Arizona PDCO.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that where The General is headed?‚Äù

‚ÄúI, uh, yes‚Ä¶‚Äù Johnson furrowed his brow in confusion. ‚ÄúBut that isn‚Äôt important right now. An asteroid, a huge, huge asteroid, will collide with Earth in roughly two days and cause unbelievable devastation! I need to be connected with someone immediately!‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù said the unaffected lady. ‚ÄúMost of ‚Äòem are asleep right now and would rather not be awoken. Ooh, I have an idea, why don‚Äôt you just tell The General when he shows up?‚Äù

Johnson shook his head in disbelief, spurring a few beads of sweat to fly off him like skittish bugs. ‚ÄúLook, can I speak to someone else? Maybe someone who can understand the gravity of the situation?‚Äù

The lady laughed, a sharp, acerbic sound. ‚ÄúGravity. Ha ha. I get it. ‚ÄòCause you‚Äôre, like, a space guy.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I-‚Äú

‚ÄúI‚Äôm the only one on shift tonight, Johnson. Everyone else called off sick,‚Äù said the lady, and Johnson could hear her take a big gulp of something. ‚ÄúAnd to be honest - it‚Äôs my first day.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding,‚Äù Johnson replied, his eyes widening in abject horror and frustration. ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre supposed to connect me with someone in the military. They need to take action on this as soon as possible.‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you, they‚Äôre asleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, WAKE THEM UP!‚Äù Johnson suddenly screamed impatiently, surprising himself.

‚ÄúI will not tolerate disrespect,‚Äù the lady stated, suddenly speaking in a sharp and mature tone. ‚ÄúDonaldson will be notified of your transgressive behavior.‚Äù

‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm sorry!‚Äù Johnson wailed. ‚ÄúI just need you to take this seriously! This is a matter of life or death!‚Äù

No reply.

‚ÄúHello?!‚Äù

The line was dead. Johnson cursed and re-dialed. No answer.

‚ÄúG-God damn it!‚Äù Johnson slammed his hammy fists on his desk, causing his coffee cup to spill on his keyboard and mouse. Johnson then tried calling Donaldson, who did not answer either. Feeling desperate, he then opted to call Donaldson‚Äôs boss. Donaldson would typically be furious that Johnson would go over his head, but he truly felt that he had no other choice.

‚ÄúRobertson here,‚Äù said a grim, elderly voice on the line. ‚ÄúThis better be good.‚Äù

‚ÄúRobertson, it‚Äôs Johnson. Night shift.‚Äù

‚ÄúJohnson? Donaldson‚Äôs employee? Why are you calling me in the middle of the night?!‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is an asteroid hurtling towards Earth. Nobody has answered my call except for you. We desperately need to alert the military.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, call dispatch. That‚Äôs your entire job.‚Äù

‚ÄúI did. They were no help at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmph. I actually received a report that you disrespected a dispatch officer, verbally berating her until she felt no other option than to quit. Why would you do such a thing?‚Äù

Johnson squinted his eyes. ‚ÄúShe quit?! Look, she wasn‚Äôt doing her one job of dispatching me to-‚Äú

‚ÄúThat is unacceptable behavior, Johnson. We will discuss this next time I‚Äôm in the office. I‚Äôd fire you right now if The General wasn‚Äôt coming in. You‚Äôre all set to meet him, correct? He should be there any second to inspect the facilities.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust who is this General guy? If he‚Äôs so important, why aren‚Äôt any supervisors here to meet with him?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs that disrespect again. Johnson, if I hear you utter even a single disrespectful syllable to The General, I will make your life a living hell. I won‚Äôt just fire you, I‚Äôll fuck you. For life.‚Äù

Johnson paused.

‚ÄúBut sir‚Ä¶ The asteroid‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúChrist, again with this asteroid bullshit. Just tell The General. He‚Äôll know what to do.‚Äù

The line went dead abruptly.

Just then, before Johnson could even register that the call had ended, a janitor walked in with a serene look on his face.

‚ÄúSe√±or‚Ä¶ The General es here.‚Äù

Johnson blinked, his heart surging in his chest. He had no idea what to expect, but he was anxious anyway.

He hastily put his coat on and walked to the front entrance of the spaceport. Across the street sat a dark, ominous limousine; Johnson wondered why they didn‚Äôt park closer to the actual entrance. A silent driver, who looked more like a walking corpse with his skinny body and pale skin, gave Johnson‚Äôs presence zero acknowledgement as he slowly lifted himself out of the car and slowly walked to the rear door of the vehicle. He moved so slowly and so quietly thay Johnson felt as if he were watching a surreal play, especially with the moonlight‚Äôs glow being the only thing illuminating the scene.

But finally, the driver opened the door.

A man with a button-down shirt, red as blood, and a long, black leather duster stepped out of the vehicle with a confident swagger Johnson had never before witnessed. This man carried himself like a celebrity, or a sports star, or a used car salesman. He had shockingly white teeth, possibly veneers, that seemed to smile and grimace at the same time, like a demented Gary Busey. His greying hair was slicked back like a 1950s greaser. A cigarette dangled out of his mouth, but no smoke was emitting from its tip; was it merely a prop? He wore clean, perfectly ironed jeans that dropped down to his domineeringly large cowboy boots. He looked like a character from a Tarantino movie that Harvey Keitel would typically play.

This man was an enigma. He just had to be The General. There was no mistaking it.

The General looked directly at Johnson, sizing him up. It seemed he was not too pleased with what he saw.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù said The General, a hint of disdain in his voice.

‚ÄúA-are you The General?‚Äù Johnson asked. He was intimidated by the man‚Äôs sheer confidence.

‚ÄúAm I The General?‚Äù The General giggled and looked at his driver, who laughed as well. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs asking me if I‚Äôm The General.‚Äù

Johnson blinked, feeling pathetic.

‚ÄúI need to be shown around,‚Äù said The General, finally stepping towards Johnson, his cowboy boots clinking metallically with each step. ‚ÄúYou will serve as my guide. Do only as I say or you will be severely punished. Do you understand?‚Äù

‚ÄúI, uh, I suppose‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúMy god, you are pathetic,‚Äù The General said, sneering at Johnson. ‚ÄúYou really must take more pride in your appearance. You‚Äôre sweating as if you just ran a marathon, but I presume your job requires no manual labor. A desk jockey! Tell me, is it a condition? Or do I make you nervous? You may answer.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo be quite honest, sir‚Ä¶‚Äù Johnson gulped. ‚ÄúI found an asteroid headed towards the Earth, which is set to collide with us within one to two days. Approximately.‚Äù

The General lip-smiled sheepishly and looked back at his driver, who met him with only a blank, emotionless stare. He then looked back at Johnson.

‚ÄúHow interesting. Yes, yes, this is quite an interesting development indeed!‚Äù The General began pacing with his hands behind his back. ‚ÄúI knew there was a reason that I was supposed to come here tonight. I knew it.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll call someone? So we can do something about it?‚Äù

The General smirked mockingly at Johnson.

‚ÄúNo. No, my dear boy. You do not become someone of my status by merely leaning on others for help. You and I, we will take action here, tonight. We don‚Äôt need anybody else.‚Äù

‚ÄúS-sir, but-‚Äú

‚ÄúI did not tell you to respond, did I?‚Äù The General raised his hand and smacked Johnson‚Äôs cheek with an unyielding strike. Johnson yelped like a wounded coyote. ‚ÄúNow, bring me inside, and we‚Äôll figure this out. Like men!‚Äù

Johnson begrudgingly led The General into the lobby of the spaceport, greeted by an empty front desk and a darkened room. Johnson heard this room was often very welcoming during the day, but it took on a foreboding look in the dead of night.

‚ÄúThis is the lobby,‚Äù Johnson said, continuing towards the elevators. The General grunted, looking around with a stern and focused expression. Johnson hit the ‚Äòup‚Äô button. ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm going to show you the 2nd floor, where I work.‚Äù

They stepped into the elevator, where a dainty jingle was playing. The elevator lurched upwards, and quickly settled on the 2nd floor with a jarring ‚Äòding‚Äô.

Johnson saw the janitor down the hallway, who, upon noticing, stood up straight and saluted. Johnson, confused, looked at The General, who nodded as if this was expected behavior. The janitor maintained this salute as they passed by and into the breakroom.

‚ÄúAh, Cheez-Its, morsels of the gods,‚Äù The General said, somehow unironically, and grabbed a small bag off the table.

‚ÄúAh, sir, those are for day shift only‚Ä¶‚Äù Johnson felt as though he was talking to the wind.

‚ÄúDay shift. P‚Äôshaw!‚Äù The General ripped open the bag and poured the entirety of its contents into his gaping maw. ‚ÄúI am the All-Shift. Shifter of worlds. I can turn Day Shift into Night Shift and Night Shift into Day Shift.‚Äù

Johnson made a conscious effort to disregard this comment, and opened the door to the large, dark room that contained his office. At the far end of the room was a single window that took up the entire wall, serving as a viewing port for the Space Shuttle down the tarmac, about a half mile away. The sight of the shuttle often inspired Johnson, and reminded him of why he went into this field in the first place. It seems The General was struck by this sight as well; his eyes lit up and filled with tears, while his mouth hung open, just slightly agape in wonder.

‚ÄúA tower‚Ä¶ No, a monument to the Heavens. Mankind‚Äôs ultimate goal, fulfilled. Not just a marvel of engineering, but a marvel of imagination, determination, and victory over science. Victory over God, even. Beautiful.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ we have a launch scheduled for next week. Just to test some of our propulsion syst-‚Äú

‚ÄúThis is why I‚Äôm here. I understand now.‚Äù

Johnson was confused by The General‚Äôs ramblings, and vainly attempted to soldier on with the tour. ‚ÄúYep, and over here is my desk.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou will allow me onto the spaceship,‚Äù The General said, still looking directly at the shuttle, spellbound. ‚ÄúYou will launch me towards the asteroid. I am The Savior. I understand it all now. This is my purpose.‚Äù

Johnson, confounded, shook his head. ‚ÄúLook, I know you‚Äôre The General and all, but I can‚Äôt just‚Ä¶ launch you. This is a billion dollar project, plus it would take a whole team to get it to work. Also, you‚Äôre not trained, your safety cannot be guaranteed, and-‚Äú

‚ÄúThese are all excuses. Matters of semantics. We are two men tasked with finding a solution for a danger that threatens all of humanity. I am not a fan of bureaucracy. I take charge. All of mankind is at stake here, yet you‚Äôre still too filled with trepidation to actually do anything about it? It‚Äôs time to take charge and stop being the pathetic animal you‚Äôve been your entire life.‚Äù

Johnson blinked.

‚ÄúCan you get me on that spaceship?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ y-yes.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know how to initiate the launch sequence?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ yeah, I guess I know what needs to be done‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúVery good. I will handle the rest. I will eliminate the asteroid, even if it costs me my life. Safety be damned. This is our purpose.‚Äù

Johnson couldn‚Äôt help but feel inspired by The General‚Äôs words. In many ways he was just happy this matter was finally being taken seriously by someone, even if it was only by this eccentric man.

‚ÄúNow. What do we need to do to get this bird airborne?‚Äù

Johnson explained that the shuttle was already fueled and fully tested for the upcoming launch, and all that was needed to be done was the countdown sequence, which would only occur once The General was in the ship‚Äôs cockpit. The rocket would need to be armed, the tanks pressurized, and the spacecraft fully powered up. Typically this was done by a team of people, but Johnson understood the basics of what needed to be done, as most of the hardest bits of the mission were already completed.

‚ÄúGood. Very good! We were put on this Earth to meet each other at this precise moment for this specific reason. I will save the world, but I need you to be the Shepherd to my Savior. Understand?‚Äù

The General‚Äôs charisma was overwhelming. Johnson didn‚Äôt understand, but he still nodded, as if in a hypnotic trance.

The General walked out of the building, and Johnson watched from the viewing port as the limousine drove out to the parked shuttle, like a lamb to the slaughter. At this distance, Johnson could barely see, but with a bit of squinting, he watched as The General climbed the precarious ladder leading to the cockpit. After a few minutes, The General‚Äôs voice sounded from the computer.

‚ÄúAlright, Shepherd, I‚Äôm in place and buckled in. Not that it matters!‚Äù An uproarious laugh echoed from the comm system, causing a high-pitched feedback noise to scratch Johnson‚Äôs earbuds. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to launch me right at that fucking asteroid, and I‚Äôm going to obliterate it!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what exactly is the plan here?‚Äù Johnson asked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like the ship is equipped with asteroid-destroying lasers.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple. Elementary. I‚Äôm going to collide with the asteroid at a high speed to alter its trajectory. I‚Äôm going to give it a good bump and move it away from Earth!‚Äù

Johnson considered this. ‚ÄúKinetic impact‚Ä¶ of course. That could actually work. But that‚Äôs suicide!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs every man‚Äôs dream to die for something larger than himself,‚Äù The General replied. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running out of time, and I‚Äôm running out of patience. Initiate the launch sequence.‚Äù

Johnson began powering up the rocket while running through the tasks on his timed checklist.

Rocket: armed.
Tanks: pressurized.

After approximately 15 minutes, the spacecraft was powered up, and dawn was beginning to break.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all set. I locked your coordinates directly towards the asteroid. We just need to do the countdown!‚Äù

Johnson couldn‚Äôt wait for this. It was every astronomer‚Äôs dream to do the countdown.

‚ÄúFUCK the countdown, let‚Äôs fucking ROLL!‚Äù

Once again, maniacal laughter emanated from the comm system, and soon enough, Johnson was laughing hysterically too. Their riotous laughter was almost in sync.

Johnson hit the button.

Beautiful, menacing plumes of smoke and fire erupted from the bottom of the spacecraft. The haunting bellow of the rocket blasted through the room, and directly into Johnson‚Äôs soul. Everything shook, as if the ground too was nervous of what was about to happen. Beyond the roar of the rocket, Johnson could only hear The General hooting and hollering loudly as the ship took off at an incredible speed.

Johnson cried.

The next morning, the sun came up, and the world continued turning.

Benjiro covered his face as Emi poured iced coffee on him. It stung his wrists where some of his cuts were still open. Ichika and Yoko were recording the whole thing. Benjiro stayed silent the whole time, he‚Äôs gotten used to this kind of treatment. He‚Äôs so used to it he has an extra pair of clothes in his locker each morning.

He was used to how nobody noticed what he was going through, how everyone ignored him every day. He hates how his body looks, how he sounds. He couldn‚Äôt stand the way his reflection looked back at him, how ugly, dirty, and disgusting it was. He just wished he was gone, he wishes he could disappear and never come back. He wishes he was dead. He decided to go to the roof, he stared down at the campus. He wondered who would miss him if he just disappeared.¬†

**TLDR & Summary Below:**¬†

* **Nikon ZF:**¬†The Nikon ZF is a powerhouse that I might not ‚Äúneed‚Äù. If I sell it, I‚Äôll miss its tech and RAW files‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs practical for my current lifestyle. Its bulk and need for editing make it less likely to be my go-to, despite its superior autofocus and versatility.¬†
* **Fujifilm X100VI:**¬†The Fujifilm X100VI offers a great all-around package with its built-in flash, size/portability, and SOOC/raw image quality. This makes it feel like the perfect go-out, social events and more dedicated photo days. The lens is loud, autofocus is hit or miss especially compared to the ZF, but it's manageable. The camera holds its value extremely well ‚Äì I got mine for retail while only waiting 2 weeks. I can sell it now, tomorrow, or next year for nearly the same price I paid initially. If I do sell it, I‚Äôll miss its overall package & offerings in its form factor.
* **Ricoh GRIIIX:**¬†it‚Äôs one I want to keep because of its portability, and the joy it brings in taking everyday pictures everywhere and anywhere I go. Despite its autofocus limitations, it's the camera that encourages me to take more pictures. I‚Äôve found my perfect 2 recipes for the Ricoh GRIIIX ‚Äì it makes me want to edit the ZF files to match that, and find a similar recipe to that on the X100VI. That‚Äôs saying a lot, because I‚Äôm really particular about colors of my ‚Äúend result‚Äù images.¬†

**In summary,**¬†I feel like I‚Äôm wanting to keep the X100VI and GRIIIX ‚Äì they seem perfect for casual daily shots to more intentional photography, both being practical and enjoyable to use. The 35mm of the X100VI and 40mm of the GRIIIX, on paper, are too close in focal length, but I love 40mm and could always crop into the X100VI. The ZF is technically superior in every way, but I just don‚Äôt find myself using it and the occasions where I DO ‚Äúneed‚Äù its capability and interchangeable lenses are so far and rare.

\---

**Nikon ZF (\~5 months ownership):**¬†Nikon 40mm f/2.8, Tamron 28-75 G2 f/2.8, Nikon 26mm f/2.8 (recently acquired)

**TLDR**: I‚Äôm considering selling this the most, despite having taken some of my best pictures with it on trips to New York & Boston. It doesn‚Äôt make much sense to sell from a technical standpoint (i.e., why are you thinking about selling the most versatile one with the best tech inside of it?), but I know that if I keep it, it still won‚Äôt see much use unless I go on more trips where its larger size + lens is warranted. I feel like I don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù this much power and weight, at the moment at least. For what I shoot, I‚Äôll miss the autofocus ‚Äòshut off my brain and don‚Äôt worry about autofocus settings‚Äô performance the most. I‚Äôll occasionally miss the f/2 full-frame subject separation and Nikon-edited files‚Äîthey have that 3D pop to them. I won‚Äôt miss its size/how it‚Äôs perceived. I just haven‚Äôt used it at all since getting back from my trip \~45 days ago.

**Autofocus (Major Pro)**: The Nikon ZF's autofocus is leagues beyond the X100VI and GRIIIX. I use 3D tracking + AF-C so often as a ‚Äòhack‚Äô for focus and recompose. I have to find workarounds for the other two cameras (e.g., AF-S, switching between single point and zone-area focus, snap distance focus, etc.). I customize the shutter button to wide-area (s) and back button focus on 3D tracking, always on AF-C. If I want a static shot of things in the center, I half-press to focus and fully press to shoot. If I want to recompose, I use back button focus & 3D track. It‚Äôs incredibly easy and takes my brain off worrying ‚Äòwhat autofocus settings/mode/zone should I use.

**Lenses (Pro/Con)**:

* **Pro**: Interchangeable lenses. All three lenses are sharp enough for me, quiet, fast, and confident in autofocus. The 40mm f/2.8 has produced some of my favorite images. The Tamron 28-75 f/2.8 G2 is light for a zoom of its kind, fast, sharp, and accurate. The 26mm f/2.8, though untested, appears sharper than the 40mm wide-open.
* **Con**: Lens sizes. Attaching the 40mm and carrying it around (ZF + 40mm) is a conscious decision. It doesn‚Äôt fit easily inside my jacket pocket or my Bellroy 4L sling without bulging out. I thought the 26mm f/2.8 pancake could solve this, but I personally prefer the 35-40mm focal length if I‚Äôm not shooting in tight spaces. I don‚Äôt anticipate using the Tamron 28-75 f/2.8 G2 unless I go on another long trip.

**Needing to Edit RAWs (Medium Con)**: I need and want to edit the ZF files to get the final image. For everyday shots, I don‚Äôt want to edit my images much beyond basic cropping and light corrections. Sure, on trips and where I want polished images, ZF files are a dream to work with and very malleable. But for social gatherings or casual outings, SOOC results are perfectly satisfactory and great. The ZF is allegedly coming out with imaging control soon, but Ricoh and X100VI have the upper hand here due to years of experience.

**Bulkiness/Perception (Major Con)**: The ZF is big and hefty, especially for someone with smaller hands. Combined with my lens options, the overall package is bulky. This bulkiness affects how it‚Äôs perceived in public. Even with the 40mm lens, I‚Äôm uncomfortable using it for everyday shots due to how it‚Äôs seen as ‚Äòwhy is this guy carrying around a big camera in my shop/why is he pointing that at me/etc.‚Äô With the larger size comes versatility and better tech, but the shooting experience of a big body and lens is a huge consideration. Friends, family, and strangers react differently to the X100VI and GRIIIX, which are less noticeable and more discreet. With the ZF, I‚Äôm much more conscious about taking it out and shooting, as people may feel I‚Äôm intruding in their space or act unnaturally.

\---

**Fujifilm X100VI (\~3 months ownership)**

**TLDR**: I‚Äôm considering selling this one second. If I keep it, I find myself taking it to family and social events, as well as dedicated photo days. If I were to sell it, I‚Äôd miss the overall ‚Äòpackage‚Äô of all the pros mentioned below the most. However, I wouldn‚Äôt miss the autofocus performance and hope Fujifilm continues to release firmware updates to improve it. While it doesn‚Äôt excel or stand out in any single feature, its overall package and form factor fit perfectly with my lifestyle.

**Lens (Minor Con)**: The 35mm lens feels a bit wide‚ÄîI often crop to 40mm or 50mm using the 40 megapixels. That‚Äôs why I chose the GRIIIX with its 40mm full-frame equivalent lens over the 28mm GRIII. This lens is softer than the Nikon Z lenses, which is noticeable when zooming in and comparing images side-by-side. It‚Äôs still sharper than the Ricoh GRIIIX based on my tests, but opinions may vary. Softness isn‚Äôt a huge issue for me as I often use a glimmerglass 1 filter at night and occasionally during the day. The biggest con is the loud stepping motors ‚Äì you can hear the motors turn and whine indoors or in quieter environments.

**Autofocus (Major Con)**: While the GRIIIX is worse in autofocus, I hold the X100VI to higher standards because it‚Äôs larger and more expensive. The 3D tracking with AF-C is far behind the Nikon ZF. I use, in decreasing confidence: AF-S with single-point, AF-S with zone, AF-C with single point, AF-C with zone, wide area tracking. On the Nikon, I just use 3D tracking with AF-C and don‚Äôt worry. There are shots I‚Äôm confident will be in focus, but are actually not when viewed on a larger screen. I hope Fujifilm improves their AF, but with a noisy and slow focusing lens, how much room is there to improve for the X100VI? I get the shots I want, but the hit rate is much lower than with the Nikon ZF.

**Pros**:

* **SOOC Images**: Although I haven‚Äôt found a recipe I love as much as the two I frequently use on the Ricoh GRIIIX, the images are large, have great potential for cropping, and are a joy to view.
* **Size**: While it fits in my 4L Bellroy sling without bulging, it‚Äôs not pocketable. However, I found myself taking it out often before I got the Ricoh GRIIIX. Now, I carry the 4L sling daily, which can fit both the X100VI and Ricoh GRIIIX.
* **Perception**: People may glance your way, but not as often as with the Nikon ZF. The nearly silent leaf shutter is a huge plus for burst shooting, and the camera as a whole looks unassuming.
* **Built-in Flash**: For times when I need fill light, whether outdoors or at indoor gatherings, the built-in flash is fantastic. Social media has taken off with compact digital cameras (digicams) with a fill-flash look, and I also love that look. I even bought an SB-400 flash for the Nikon ZF, but it‚Äôs not nearly as compact as the X100VI. Carrying a ZF with a 26mm/40mm and SB-400 flash is bulky and draws much more attention.

**Ricoh GRIIIX (\~3 week ownership)**

**TLDR**: I‚Äôm considering selling this the least. If the Ricoh GRIV(X) comes out and includes a flash, I‚Äôll immediately sell this and get that. Its usage:size ratio exceeds the ZF by far and the X100VI by a margin. I love taking pictures with this camera‚Äîit goes with me everywhere and anywhere. It reminds me of the ‚Äúfun‚Äù of photography.

**No Flash (Con)**: This would‚Äôve been the perfect digicam if it still had a flash. I‚Äôm considering the recently released Godox IM20 flash, but it‚Äôs non-TTL. While I could learn to adjust settings quickly, nothing beats the speed of a TTL flash for friends/family/social shots.

**Lens (Pro/Con)**: The 40mm lens is great. I could crop into 50mm if needed, but I mostly leave the pictures as-is with minor cropping corrections. Sharpness is hit or miss, likely tied to autofocus. Sometimes it‚Äôs incredibly sharp, other times noticeably soft and I‚Äôm wondering ‚Äúhow did it miss focus/where did it focus on‚Äù, when I'm shooting a static painting 3m in front of me. The X100VI and ZF are sharper, especially for nearby objects (\~close-5 meter range). Low light performance is very soft, and I wish it could open to f/2. Lens dust hasn‚Äôt been an issue.

**Autofocus (Con)**: The worst by far, but I‚Äôll address this in ‚Äúusage‚Äù. I use 4 modes: AF Point + Focus + Shoot (Touchscreen), Snap Distance Priority on Drive button (toggle), Full Press Snap at 3.5m, Select-AF with center focus on FN button, and Auto-area AF center (drive button toggle) ‚Äîall technically in AF-S mode. AF-C is just unusable.

**Pros**:

* **SOOC Images**: I love two recipes on the Ricoh GRIIIX‚Äîmy edited Nikons aim for this look, or similar recipes on the X100VI. For zero-edit shots, I reach for the GRIIIX.
* **Size**: It‚Äôs pocketable and goes with me everywhere‚Äîerrands, coffee shops, walks, etc. It encourages more picture-taking. While not every picture is artistically or technically ‚Äúgood,‚Äù it‚Äôs true that the best camera is the one you have with you. I can take a shot and pocket it back, or strap it to my wrist unnoticed.
* **Perception**: People in my age group either have, want, or recognize a digicam. I can shoot anything, anywhere, without drawing attention. Just yesterday, a random group of strangers asked about my ‚Äúdigicam‚Äù and asked about my thoughts/some recommendations. That was an awesome experience.
* **Everyday Usage & Fun**: It‚Äôs the most fun camera I‚Äôve shot with, possibly due to all the pros. Light, pocketable, unnoticed, and great for conversations. Autofocus is bad, but I treat it as a digicam‚Äîpoint and shoot without fancy tracking. The 4 modes are perfect for everyday/static photos, though Snap Distance Priority and Full Press Snap are less used.

**TLDR & Summary Below:**¬†

* **Nikon ZF:** The Nikon ZF is a powerhouse that I might not ‚Äúneed‚Äù. If I sell it, I‚Äôll miss its tech and RAW files‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs practical for my current lifestyle. Its bulk and need for editing make it less likely to be my go-to, despite its superior autofocus and versatility.¬†
* **Fujifilm X100VI:** The Fujifilm X100VI offers a great all-around package with its built-in flash, size/portability, and SOOC/raw image quality. This makes it feel like the perfect go-out, social events and more dedicated photo days. The lens is loud, autofocus is hit or miss especially compared to the ZF, but it's manageable. The camera holds its value extremely well ‚Äì I got mine for retail while only waiting 2 weeks. I can sell it now, tomorrow, or next year for nearly the same price I paid initially. If I do sell it, I‚Äôll miss its overall package & offerings in its form factor.
* **Ricoh GRIIIX:** it‚Äôs one I want to keep because of its portability, and the joy it brings in taking everyday pictures everywhere and anywhere I go. Despite its autofocus limitations, it's the camera that encourages me to take more pictures. I‚Äôve found my perfect 2 recipes for the Ricoh GRIIIX ‚Äì it makes me want to edit the ZF files to match that, and find a similar recipe to that on the X100VI. That‚Äôs saying a lot, because I‚Äôm really particular about colors of my ‚Äúend result‚Äù images.¬†

**In summary,** I feel like I‚Äôm wanting to keep the X100VI and GRIIIX ‚Äì they seem perfect for casual daily shots to more intentional photography, both being practical and enjoyable to use. The 35mm of the X100VI and 40mm of the GRIIIX, on paper, are too close in focal length, but I love 40mm and could always crop into the X100VI. The ZF is technically superior in every way, but I just don‚Äôt find myself using it and the occasions where I DO ‚Äúneed‚Äù its capability and interchangeable lenses are so far and rare.

\---

**Nikon ZF (\~5 months ownership):** Nikon 40mm f/2.8, Tamron 28-75 G2 f/2.8, Nikon 26mm f/2.8 (recently acquired)

**TLDR**: I‚Äôm considering selling this the most, despite having taken some of my best pictures with it on trips to New York & Boston. It doesn‚Äôt make much sense to sell from a technical standpoint (i.e., why are you thinking about selling the most versatile one with the best tech inside of it?), but I know that if I keep it, it still won‚Äôt see much use unless I go on more trips where its larger size + lens is warranted. I feel like I don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù this much power and weight, at the moment at least. For what I shoot, I‚Äôll miss the autofocus ‚Äòshut off my brain and don‚Äôt worry about autofocus settings‚Äô performance the most. I‚Äôll occasionally miss the f/2 full-frame subject separation and Nikon-edited files‚Äîthey have that 3D pop to them. I won‚Äôt miss its size/how it‚Äôs perceived. I just haven‚Äôt used it at all since getting back from my trip \~45 days ago.

**Autofocus (Major Pro)**: The Nikon ZF's autofocus is leagues beyond the X100VI and GRIIIX. I use 3D tracking + AF-C so often as a ‚Äòhack‚Äô for focus and recompose. I have to find workarounds for the other two cameras (e.g., AF-S, switching between single point and zone-area focus, snap distance focus, etc.). I customize the shutter button to wide-area (s) and back button focus on 3D tracking, always on AF-C. If I want a static shot of things in the center, I half-press to focus and fully press to shoot. If I want to recompose, I use back button focus & 3D track. It‚Äôs incredibly easy and takes my brain off worrying ‚Äòwhat autofocus settings/mode/zone should I use.

**Lenses (Pro/Con)**:

* **Pro**: Interchangeable lenses. All three lenses are sharp enough for me, quiet, fast, and confident in autofocus. The 40mm f/2.8 has produced some of my favorite images. The Tamron 28-75 f/2.8 G2 is light for a zoom of its kind, fast, sharp, and accurate. The 26mm f/2.8, though untested, appears sharper than the 40mm wide-open.
* **Con**: Lens sizes. Attaching the 40mm and carrying it around (ZF + 40mm) is a conscious decision. It doesn‚Äôt fit easily inside my jacket pocket or my Bellroy 4L sling without bulging out. I thought the 26mm f/2.8 pancake could solve this, but I personally prefer the 35-40mm focal length if I‚Äôm not shooting in tight spaces. I don‚Äôt anticipate using the Tamron 28-75 f/2.8 G2 unless I go on another long trip.

**Needing to Edit RAWs (Medium Con)**: I need and want to edit the ZF files to get the final image. For everyday shots, I don‚Äôt want to edit my images much beyond basic cropping and light corrections. Sure, on trips and where I want polished images, ZF files are a dream to work with and very malleable. But for social gatherings or casual outings, SOOC results are perfectly satisfactory and great. The ZF is allegedly coming out with imaging control soon, but Ricoh and X100VI have the upper hand here due to years of experience.

**Bulkiness/Perception (Major Con)**: The ZF is big and hefty, especially for someone with smaller hands. Combined with my lens options, the overall package is bulky. This bulkiness affects how it‚Äôs perceived in public. Even with the 40mm lens, I‚Äôm uncomfortable using it for everyday shots due to how it‚Äôs seen as ‚Äòwhy is this guy carrying around a big camera in my shop/why is he pointing that at me/etc.‚Äô With the larger size comes versatility and better tech, but the shooting experience of a big body and lens is a huge consideration. Friends, family, and strangers react differently to the X100VI and GRIIIX, which are less noticeable and more discreet. With the ZF, I‚Äôm much more conscious about taking it out and shooting, as people may feel I‚Äôm intruding in their space or act unnaturally.

\---

**Fujifilm X100VI (\~3 months ownership)**

**TLDR**: I‚Äôm considering selling this one second. If I keep it, I find myself taking it to family and social events, as well as dedicated photo days. If I were to sell it, I‚Äôd miss the overall ‚Äòpackage‚Äô of all the pros mentioned below the most. However, I wouldn‚Äôt miss the autofocus performance and hope Fujifilm continues to release firmware updates to improve it. While it doesn‚Äôt excel or stand out in any single feature, its overall package and form factor fit perfectly with my lifestyle.

**Lens (Minor Con)**: The 35mm lens feels a bit wide‚ÄîI often crop to 40mm or 50mm using the 40 megapixels. That‚Äôs why I chose the GRIIIX with its 40mm full-frame equivalent lens over the 28mm GRIII. This lens is softer than the Nikon Z lenses, which is noticeable when zooming in and comparing images side-by-side. It‚Äôs still sharper than the Ricoh GRIIIX based on my tests, but opinions may vary. Softness isn‚Äôt a huge issue for me as I often use a glimmerglass 1 filter at night and occasionally during the day. The biggest con is the loud stepping motors ‚Äì you can hear the motors turn and whine indoors or in quieter environments.

**Autofocus (Major Con)**: While the GRIIIX is worse in autofocus, I hold the X100VI to higher standards because it‚Äôs larger and more expensive. The 3D tracking with AF-C is far behind the Nikon ZF. I use, in decreasing confidence: AF-S with single-point, AF-S with zone, AF-C with single point, AF-C with zone, wide area tracking. On the Nikon, I just use 3D tracking with AF-C and don‚Äôt worry. There are shots I‚Äôm confident will be in focus, but are actually not when viewed on a larger screen. I hope Fujifilm improves their AF, but with a noisy and slow focusing lens, how much room is there to improve for the X100VI? I get the shots I want, but the hit rate is much lower than with the Nikon ZF.

**Pros**:

* **SOOC Images**: Although I haven‚Äôt found a recipe I love as much as the two I frequently use on the Ricoh GRIIIX, the images are large, have great potential for cropping, and are a joy to view.
* **Size**: While it fits in my 4L Bellroy sling without bulging, it‚Äôs not pocketable. However, I found myself taking it out often before I got the Ricoh GRIIIX. Now, I carry the 4L sling daily, which can fit both the X100VI and Ricoh GRIIIX.
* **Perception**: People may glance your way, but not as often as with the Nikon ZF. The nearly silent leaf shutter is a huge plus for burst shooting, and the camera as a whole looks unassuming.
* **Built-in Flash**: For times when I need fill light, whether outdoors or at indoor gatherings, the built-in flash is fantastic. Social media has taken off with compact digital cameras (digicams) with a fill-flash look, and I also love that look. I even bought an SB-400 flash for the Nikon ZF, but it‚Äôs not nearly as compact as the X100VI. Carrying a ZF with a 26mm/40mm and SB-400 flash is bulky and draws much more attention.

**Ricoh GRIIIX (\~3 week ownership)**

**TLDR**: I‚Äôm considering selling this the least. If the Ricoh GRIV(X) comes out and includes a flash, I‚Äôll immediately sell this and get that. Its usage:size ratio exceeds the ZF by far and the X100VI by a margin. I love taking pictures with this camera‚Äîit goes with me everywhere and anywhere. It reminds me of the ‚Äúfun‚Äù of photography.

**No Flash (Con)**: This would‚Äôve been the perfect digicam if it still had a flash. I‚Äôm considering the recently released Godox IM20 flash, but it‚Äôs non-TTL. While I could learn to adjust settings quickly, nothing beats the speed of a TTL flash for friends/family/social shots.

**Lens (Pro/Con)**: The 40mm lens is great. I could crop into 50mm if needed, but I mostly leave the pictures as-is with minor cropping corrections. Sharpness is hit or miss, likely tied to autofocus. Sometimes it‚Äôs incredibly sharp, other times noticeably soft and I‚Äôm wondering ‚Äúhow did it miss focus/where did it focus on‚Äù, when I'm shooting a static painting 3m in front of me. The X100VI and ZF are sharper, especially for nearby objects (\~close-5 meter range). Low light performance is very soft, and I wish it could open to f/2. Lens dust hasn‚Äôt been an issue.

**Autofocus (Con)**: The worst by far, but I‚Äôll address this in ‚Äúusage‚Äù. I use 4 modes: AF Point + Focus + Shoot (Touchscreen), Snap Distance Priority on Drive button (toggle), Full Press Snap at 3.5m, Select-AF with center focus on FN button, and Auto-area AF center (drive button toggle) ‚Äîall technically in AF-S mode. AF-C is just unusable.

**Pros**:

* **SOOC Images**: I love two recipes on the Ricoh GRIIIX‚Äîmy edited Nikons aim for this look, or similar recipes on the X100VI. For zero-edit shots, I reach for the GRIIIX.
* **Size**: It‚Äôs pocketable and goes with me everywhere‚Äîerrands, coffee shops, walks, etc. It encourages more picture-taking. While not every picture is artistically or technically ‚Äúgood,‚Äù it‚Äôs true that the best camera is the one you have with you. I can take a shot and pocket it back, or strap it to my wrist unnoticed.
* **Perception**: People in my age group either have, want, or recognize a digicam. I can shoot anything, anywhere, without drawing attention. Just yesterday, a random group of strangers asked about my ‚Äúdigicam‚Äù and asked about my thoughts/some recommendations. That was an awesome experience.
* **Everyday Usage & Fun**: It‚Äôs the most fun camera I‚Äôve shot with, possibly due to all the pros. Light, pocketable, unnoticed, and great for conversations. Autofocus is bad, but I treat it as a digicam‚Äîpoint and shoot without fancy tracking. The 4 modes are perfect for everyday/static photos, though Snap Distance Priority and Full Press Snap are less used.

I also recently adopted a cat and his name is boba. He was rehomed and I thought he was 7 years old but it turns out he‚Äôs actually 9. I can most definitely send pictures. Me and my partner also have a snake who is absolutely adorable.

Early morning, trees full of leaves

The sun burned hot and bright

An old man walked his dog

Mothers pushed their strollers

Children played in playgrounds

Musicians performed in parks

Babushkas gossiped

Fliers were given out

In a busy metro station

Magazines and flowers

Were sold on the side



The garbage truck loaded

Early morning, trees with falling leaves

Everything was orange

Uniformed women swept

Dogs barked at each other

A homeless man on the sidewalk

Coffee shops covered

In bats and pumpkins

Streets flooded

From the night before

Vapour filled the air

Water seeped into my boots



The garbage truck loaded

Early morning, trees with no leaves

Snow on the ground

Roads being salted

Church bells rang

Gallons were filled

Kids waddled in puffy coats

And woolly bear knits

Cozy bars 

Fairy lights 

And a giant Christmas tree

Set up in the city square

Then I heard the bombs



The sky lit up

Injecting me with terror 

No more garbage truck

No more sweeping 

Three kids and a mom

On a playground

One or two

Dogs being walked

Falling snow

Streets of white

Dark outside

No street lights

A busy metro station

But for different reasons

Barely a soul outside

And the ceilings hung low

No more music

No more gossip

No more flowers

Fliers, or magazines

No more gallons

No more salting

The city was killed

Along with the square

The cold I once admired

Became murderous

And the calming silence outside

Became a muffled scream of horror

My heart jumped and raced

As bullets flew past me

Every bang

Electrified me

A train shrieked and loaded

As a woman ran towards it

With a baby in her arms

How I wonder how she is

Amidst all this

I was not but a student

A stranger

On foreign land



I still remember

All the pains you shouldered with me

All the novelties you showed me 

All the obstacles you helped me overcome 

Your summers

Your winters

Your people

I couldn‚Äôt understand a word you said

Yet I still fell in love with you

So flawed yet so perfect

How dare they take you from me

Destroy your very heart

Where a part of me resides 

As we drove past flags of golden blue

Terror played me like a puppet

And I didn‚Äôt realize how much I‚Äôd miss you

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your home to grieve‚Äù

Or so I‚Äôve been told

If only I can turn back time

My dog has:
- habit of lunging at men on the sidewalk 
- been attacked by a pitbull last year 
- separation anxiety 

I moved to a new neighborhood last year that has narrower sidewalks, more pedestrians, off leash bully breeds (the attack didn‚Äôt occur here however). And I have been trapped in my house for the last 2 years because of the separation anxiety. I don‚Äôt have a car. 

I have been unsuccessful training him out of these things. I just keep him away from pedestrians, but in my new neighborhood it‚Äôs much harder, and the off leash dogs scare me. My dog is 22lbs and the attack last year traumatized me. 

My vet told me I need to hire a trainer before trying something like prozac for the separation anxiety, but I‚Äôm on food stamps and can‚Äôt afford it. I‚Äôve tried to train on my own but the most we got to was like 3 minutes of me leaving with him staying calm. I‚Äôm going to keep trying.

I feel like a total failure to my dog. He just has so many problems. I‚Äôm low income as I said and my life has so many problems besides him, but my life would be so much easier if I could leave him at home. I never go anywhere, ANYWHERE, not even just a walk to clear my head, without my family babysitting him for me. 

So my question: am I insane if I put him in a dog stroller (i got an old gen7pets one, it‚Äôs nice) even though he‚Äôs able bodied, just to have the freedom to walk to the coffee stand or to the park? 

Did anyone else do this and did it keep your dog safe? It‚Äôs a 30 minute walk to the nearest park and I just want to take him there but the walk TO the park is too triggering and dangerous. I just feel trapped. ",1,1737072430.0,reactivedogs,2,0.67,False

I wanted to share with you how I was able to drop my A1Cs from 12.2 to 5.4 in 6 months hoping this can help someone else.

First I would like to say I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and it did not go away and I didn‚Äôt find out it didn‚Äôt go away until 2 years in. At that time I was hovering at 215 pounds and after meeting with my endocrinologist I noticed my glucose was over 400 yikes.

She immediately had me start taking 2000 mg of metformin and had me start on Mounjaro.

She also gave me a sample dexcom g7 to try. I ended up eating regular for about two weeks so I could figure out what was causing the high glucose and it was everything.

So I stopped drinking coffee which spiked my sugar and started doing keto. Well the keto I thought I was doing didnt really work well. I loss some weight and dropped down to 195-200.

Follow up appointment and my doctor said my glucose was dropping and at that time it was around 200 and she didn‚Äôt think we needed to increase the mounjaro. Told me to meet with her nutritionist friend. 

That was a game changer and she told me to stop the keto and follow a high fiber, low carb, low protein diet. 

Didn‚Äôt make sense to me but I said sure and sure enough my weight dropped 5 pounds in the first week. She also recommended for me to walk as much as possible but for certain after eating so I got a walking pad and started walking 20-30 min after breakfast and dinner meals. I did not walk for lunch (lazy). 

Did my labs and everything came back looking good and dropped to 178lbs and my glucose average at 90.

Fiber seems to be the key to reducing glucose spikes and lots of water.

Buckle up, because this is a long one.
Over the past eight months, we have gotten really close. I know a lot about him, he knows a lot about me, and we spend a considerable amount of time together. For the first few months of our friendship, I did not have feelings for him. He was originally in a relationship when I met him, which I respected. After he and his girlfriend broke up, the dynamic of our friendship changed. 
Maybe because he wasn't worried about what anyone else would think anymore, but he started spending more time with me, as well as just generally putting in a significant amount more effort into our friendship. He would remember things I mentioned one time months prior I had forgotten about, etc. After about a week of this is when I started to develop feelings for him most likely. I'm not entirely sure, but it was probably early November. 
It was slow at first, but I fell hard for him though. Not to give too many details and potentially expose myself, but my friend is very attractive, and has an amazing personality. This means he usually gets a lot of romantic interest from other people of both genders. During this time where I was slowly falling for him, he was being pursued by other people, but didn't tell me. I found out because I heard he went on a date with a friend of a friend, however it did not go any further than that.
I had been trying to get over him unsuccessfully since this incident about a month or two ago while staying friends with him when things shifted again in our relationship. I met his older sister, who asked me if I thought he was hot one night, which was the first indication. The second one was when the things we did together started to resemble dates (coffee and a museum, a movie, etc,) and he began to do act more ""chivalrous"" around me. At the beginning of this period is when the semester ended and I realized one of our professors thought I was already dating my friend.
Even though we did not see eachother over winter break (which was very short and also due to family reasons on my end), we continued to banter over text. While potentially our nick names for eachother could have been seen as potentially flirtatious, that was the extent of it prior to december. Now, we had escalated to conversations that my friends took as overt flirting when they would read over my shoulder. He'd also occasionally send me things that made him think of me, and just generally things like that. A few days before break ends, he texts me that he hasn't seen a movie that was playing in theaters yet. I'm probably not explaining it well, but it was done in a way where it seemed like he was setting it up to ask me on a date. We decided to go to the movie when we got back to school, but I wasn't completely confident it was a date.
By the time we get back on campus, I decide that I will not make any decisions about wether or not he is into me until after I see him in person. Unfortunately for me, while planning what I had at the time been assuming was a date, my friend mentioned that we needed to schedule it around movie plans he was making with someone else who had displayed interest in him. Upon further nudging, he told me that he was interested in this person as well. 
I was a bit crushed. Other than that, all signs had pointed at the fact that this friend reciprocated my interest in him. One of the things my friends pointed to repeatedly was the way he looks at me. Even in groups, he spends more time looking at me than anyone else, and is more attentive as well. While this is likely delusion, his body language tends to fall under what is mentioned in Tik Toks about how guys behave when they're secretly into you. 
We even ended up at the same party last weekend, where immediately upon getting there he went to find me and give me a hug as soon as he saw me. This was something he had never done before, but I wasn't mad. We had just been texting earlier the same day in a way where my friends thought he had been flirting. I didn't have any expectations of anything, but if something happened I was going to let it happen.
After something happened I won't get into as it isn't that relevant, the party ended early so I had people over to my dorm to hang out since I lived closer than any of my friends and my roommate was staying at her boyfriend's. I invited a smallish group of girls, my guy friend this story is about, and a few people I knew through him over to my place. 
While my friends took me up on the offer, only my guy friend came over as well. He apparently decided he'd rather spend time with me (and like four other girls he had just met) than his friends. While everyone else left before him, my friend stayed at my room for an hour and a half longer than everyone else. I ended up sitting next to him, and being significantly more touchy than usual because I was still slightly intoxicated. My friends didn't get the impression he was into me while they were hanging out with us, but when they all left he acted significantly more relaxed.
We ended up talking and taking goofy pictures together on my phone until my friend was literally on the verge of passing out. However, since my roommate got kicked out of her boyfriend's dorm when the police were called for a separate incident, my friend did not want to stay in our dorm and ended up going home.
We spent fifteen minutes at least just standing by my door, talking, before he finally left. I almost kissed him as he stood in my door smiling at me he was so pretty; I think the only reason I didn't was because my roommate had just come back. 
Anyways, I thought I was going to see him the next night anyways. No big deal. Instead, my friends and I decide to bail on the party that night in favor of staying at their dorm and hanging out. However, he met another friend of mine at that party. They realized they had both heard about eachother from me and he proceeded to tell her about how great he thought I was. The girl I'm friends with said she thought he was into me based on that, however I was still unsure because that's how I talk about her. Additionally, my friends who saw the photos of us after my dorm at the party thought this guy was into me.
Then we see the movie. He insists on buying me my snacks. We sit angled towards eachother all movie. He consistently offered to share his candy with me, though I didn't take him up on the offer as I had my own. Then at some point we end up sharing the arm rest, with our arms consistently rubbing against each other. It could have just been me, but it was almost like I felt a spark. However, my delusion dissipated when he deliberately moved his arm off the arm rest, and proceeded to not move it back for the rest of the movie, meaning that this took place for likely anywhere from half to two thirds of the movie where our arms were touching. 
After the movie, he acts like nothing happened. Not even that I was annoying hogging the arm rest. We just walk home, talking constantly. And maybe I fumble here, but I mention someone who has displayed interest in me and that maybe I should give them a shot as a response when he mentioned the other person interested in him offhand. Other than that, the conversation is completely normal, except we're oddly not touchy based on how physically affectionate we had been just two days prior. In hindsight, he probably tried to hug me before we split ways, but I didn't realize.
Now this week, it's oddly flirtatious again. He's texting me until he falls asleep, he's texting me right before and after his classes, he's making flirtatious jokes again, he's talking about things he wants to do together, and at one point one of his roommates recognizes me without me introducing myself in class. I had never spoken to this roommate before, and he doesn't have any of my social media accounts, which are all private. I keep hearing conflicting opinions from my friends, but I do not know how to tell if he is actually interested in me or not and if this has potential, or if I should cut him loose instead. It sucks because this was a good friend of mine, and now I do not know what to do and if I should risk this friendship.
If anyone takes the time to read all this, I'm sorry, but I would appreciate advice.

TLDR; My guy friend has started acting more flirtatious with me recently, but I can't tell if he's into me especially after he's mentioned someone else he's interested in. How do I approach this situation in a way where I do not risk ruining the friendship? ",1,1737071832.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

Roast date on these are 9th of January, so I'm tempted to let them rest for a few more weeks, although on their own website they do mention that they're best enjoyed 4-7 days off roast, which is very interesting tbh.

How else can we define quality of life other than the emotions we feel? If I'm constantly stressed out because of the Rollercoaster ride of alcohol..what quality of life am I living?

  One of the understated benefits of being alcohol  free is how I get an honest look at how I'm feeling everyday. I am 100 percent more in synch with my true self. With my true desires. Alcohol made me want to be more social. It motivated me to go out and have conversations with anyone and everyone just for the sake of it. What cutting out alcohol did for me was give me an honest insight into my character. I'm completely content and happy in my own company.  I've found such a magnificent deep sense of peace and tranquility that I was sure was gone forever. I have cried a few nights lately as I drifted off to sleep.  Just a few months ago I was so plagued with anxiety that I could barely function. I didnt enjoy my life at all because of my anxiety. 

Quitting alcohol has allowed me to explore my creativity. I read and write so much more than I have in many many years. And this in itself completes a part of me.  It's also allowed me to focus on my working out. I'm in the best shape of my life at age 35 and I'm doing it with zero supplements at all. Just taking care of my body. 

I ditched gambling, energy drinks, nicotine, and alcohol all within the same three months.  The only ""vice"" I have now is a couple cups of coffee every morning

I‚Äôm pretty overweight, but most of that weight can be attributed to a singular thing in my life which is a type of Iced Coffee they sell in my country, of which I‚Äôve drunk excessive amounts of over the last 6 years. Using the nutrition information from the product and multiplying it by my daily consumption, it attributed 7,920kjs energy, 77g protein, 79g fat, 218g carbs, 106g sugar, 1g sodium, 3g calcium and 1g caffeine per day.

Apart from this one drink that I breathed, I didn‚Äôt really snack or eat too much crap, but I didn‚Äôt really work out either.

2 months ago I had an overseas holiday for a month and the destination location didn‚Äôt have this drink or really anything close to it so I used the trip as an opportunity to stop my toxic consumption of it. Since hopping on the plane I haven‚Äôt touched it, even during the weeks I‚Äôve been back home. I‚Äôve gone from 150kgs (330 pounds) to 135kgs (297 pounds)

The good news is that as a result of getting rid of my one crutch I‚Äôve been losing weight, but I also see a lot of stories about how losing weight too quickly can be bad for you, particularly around nutrients. I don‚Äôt see anything in the above information as seemingly that important except maybe protein and calcium, but at the same time I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing.

I‚Äôd rather not develop intentionally bad eating/drinking habits to slow the rate at which I‚Äôm losing weight, but I also worry that the lack of calcium and protein may have some negative long term effects on me.

I‚Äôm just hoping for any informed advice as to anything I need to consider going forward. I also quit smoking too which I thought might increase my appetite but that hasn‚Äôt really happened. So I‚Äôm not sure if I just ride it out or if I need to be doing more.

My coworkers and I were joking about having to bring our own toilet paper, unionizing over the cutlery and trying to make light of the situation as some of my colleagues were upset.

One of my coworkers who was present has had it out for me since I complained to management that she was on her phone constantly interest of training me properly. 
This coworker was in the room and went and reported what was said to management, she told them I was the sole perpetrator and that I was serious. I‚Äôd like to mention everyone was commenting and joking around, including this employee. 

We‚Äôre a new company and upper management does not have the experience or credentials to be upper management. They‚Äôre mostly yes men to the ceo and it‚Äôs very much a boys club. This makes for a very volatile work place and there is no HR representative either.

That being said, the manager believed what this employee told him. He did not do a thorough investigation and never asked me my side of the story. That day I was brought into the office, there was a paper on the desk that was filled out prior to this meeting and that was my write up. It was like walking into a lions den, I was not listened to and they wouldn‚Äôt let me explain anything, they kept telling me I was lying. I was very upset because my character was being attacked. I signed the paper but let them know I didn‚Äôt agree with this. They told me if anything ever happens like this again that I‚Äôd be fired.
I did admit to making the jokes but tried to explain my intent was not malicious. 

The next day they pulled me into the office. My manager told me that he talked to all of management about our meeting and due to my reaction and lack of accountability they are letting me go. On my termination letter they wrote that I had an unacceptable behaviour, a bad attitude and that I did not follow the company‚Äôs behaviour policy. 

I‚Äôd like to mention that exactly one week before this happened I had my 3 month review, this was a very good review where I was told I was an excellent employee and given a raise. I had never had any issues prior to this. 
I have an excellent relationship with direct supervisor, coworkers and even coworkers in other departments. My manager described me as ‚Äúthe mom of the group‚Äù. I have a physical copy of this review.

Today that manager had a meeting with the entire team and told them that I had a bad attitude, a lack of accountability and was damaging company property. 
I LOVED my job and coworkers. I made a lot of excuses for this company since they‚Äôre new and I was planning on making this my career.

I‚Äôm worried that I won‚Äôt qualify for EI now because they labelled my reason for termination as being my own fault. 
I feel like I have grounds for legal action but would like advice. I also don‚Äôt have any money to fight this. 

What should I do?

 While im laying in this large ""comfy"" bed i dream of my tiny Thai fighter room. With my loud buzzing fridge, my tiny matress and my blanket that was too short. But i always slept like a log. 

Nowadays i don't sleep that good anymore, too many things to worry about. Back then all i worried about was my training and sometimes my fight(s).

And boy did i enjoy every moment then, even the times when we did 2h of hard clinching and at dinner time i had to prop my head up with chopsticks and hold my head up by the hair to feed myself the Kuaytiaw Gaj (Thai chicken noodles).

I miss the camraderie with the Thai guys, the stupid jokes. 

I miss going for morning runs (even the packs of feral dogs i almost miss!) And after training i would treat myself to a nice coffee sourced straight from the mountains. Looking over a green ricefield listening to the crickets. Even the cries of the Common Koel i enjoyed.

Lunch was always delicious, then a lovely nap and back to training. At night i would sleep deeply and wake up before the crack of dawn seeing the thai uncles and aunties putting up their stores and selling their wares while we did our morning run.

Life changed for me, some would say for the better. For me? I look outside and see a cold fog working its way through my dimly lit street. Its well passed midnight and i can't sleep, im too busy day dreaming about crickets and ricefields.

Thank you and goodnight

P.s.


Please go to Thailand and train as barebones as you can. Try to live as frugal as you can. Theres a peace and serenity in simple living no amount of money can buy.",25,1737071252.0,MuayThai,4,1.0,False

**Central Intelligence Agency, Cryptographic analyst.**¬†

**Citizen of the United States**

**Coordinated Earth Time: March 18th, 2209** ¬†¬†¬†

**Location: Langley Virginia, Hilda Asteroid Field Concern Team**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_¬†

*Another* dreadful day spent in a room full of machines. When I had first joined the Agency, my mind had been filled with notions of daring spy craft and high tech gadgets, like those old James Bond films the museums show.¬†

*I expected excitement.*

What I got instead was sitting in an empty room, endlessly pouring over redundant footage from the various spy satellites and probes, analyzing and correcting the machines every time their rudimentary intelligence mistakes an asteroid for a Soviet cruiser.¬†

Hell, even the other guys in my team got more exciting tasks than me, managing the probes around Venus, or near the belt dockyards. I was stuck monitoring the Hilda asteroid field. Nothing ever happens there.¬†

On a day like this, my only respite was my lukewarm styrofoam coffee cup.

\*SHING SHING SHING\*

The sound caught my ear as I swiveled in my seat to see its origins. The alert was coming from one of the older consoles. Pushing over to it, I patched into the antiquated system.

*A Metis - 7 Spy sat.*

This thing was practically ancient - the current model being the Metis-23. This particular sat had been holding in Hilda in support of an operation that occurred almost 42 years ago.¬†

Curiously, I pulled up the readout on it. Whatever it had seen, the onboard AI had determined it important enough to abandon its long vigil and return to home in haste. My eyes worked over the series of high definition photographs and LIDAR scans taken by the spy satellite. I half expected another mis-identification or wayward freighter ship, only to be met with a very surprising turn of events.¬†

*This was a vessel I had never seen before*.

My curiosity very much peaked, I pulled up my silhouette card - cross referencing the ship with the known vessels of the Soviets, ourselves and the associated allies of both. This strange ship did not match any of them.

*Is this a lesser known private corporate vessel?*

I had never seen one in a design of this style before, nor did I have any knowledge of companies operating this far into contested territory.¬†

Pouring over the wealth of information, I selected one of the zoomed in photographs and selected the artificial enhancement engine. With a low *whir*, followed by the occasional THUNK it went to work, blowing up the image, clearing the definition up, filling in the gaps. An amazing process from an amazing machine.¬†

After a few moments more of *whir* THUNK *whir* THUNK, the image was released. Taking it into my hand, whilst taking a sip from my pitiful cup of coffee, I looked over the image of what appeared to be a cosmonaut meeting with another cosmonaut.¬†

No‚Ä¶ too small to be a cosmonaut. That had to be the smallest man, I had ever -

The cup slipped from my hand and splattered lukewarm coffee all over my groin. On any other day, this would be a cause of great concern and embarrassment. A day ruiner even. What I held in my hand though made that seem like nothing.¬†

I brought the image directly up to my face, staring at it‚Äôs every feature like a madman beholding an image of revelation.¬†

The small body, the narrow frame with inward bent knees, the slot for large ears‚Ä¶ the tail.

*This wasn‚Äôt human.*¬†

The artificial enhancer was known to occasionally get *creative* with its interpretation of missing pixels, but never to this degree! Just to be safe, I ran it through the process seven more times, using every known image we had of this mysterious star-man. Each time it came out the same.

My heart pounded in my chest, as I gripped with the reality of what this discovery meant. Gathering my ample evidence into a manila envelope, I removed my access card from my work terminal and sped down the hall, towards the administrative offices.¬†

In the hall, casual hallway conversations were interrupted as I barged through the middle of them, fern vases were overturned and fellow walkers were hip checked. I left a trail of carnage and angry coworkers behind me as I made my way down the hall like a madman. They would understand once the truth was revealed.¬†

Eventually I made my way to the large series of oak doors that lead to the directors hall. Here is where the heads of all the divisions made their home‚Ä¶ and where my boss was. Slowing my sprint to a more dignified power walk as I saw the armed security standing beyond the doors, I took a moment to appreciate the framed pictures of past directors. My eyes caught the last three of them as I turned the corner‚Ä¶

**Terrence Mcafferty 2147-2160**

**Cora Jones 2160-2189**

**Killian Deringan 2189 - Present**

Turning into the T corridor at the end of the hallway, I collected myself, before knocking at the door of the office bearing a single brass plate:

**SUNG YON-JOON || DIRECTOR OF CLANDESTINE SERVICES**

The sound of a buzzer going off signaled my approval, and I pressed the door open before stepping inside the spacious office. The tidiness of the office was almost remarkable, with the desk practically shining from its polish. The only items indicating its presence as an inhabited space being the various diploma‚Äôs certificates and military medals hung in shadow boxes on the walls.

And the man himself of course. He sat at his desk, staring up at me from above the rim of his glasses. He had been writing something on a legal notepad when I had entered and it seems my entry had distracted him.¬†

‚ÄúYes? What is it, that is so important that you would run yourself so ragged?‚Äù

I was suddenly conscious of the rather disheveled state of my appearance and heavy breathing, and so fiddled with my collar in a vain attempt to become more presentable.¬†

The weathered and elderly man looked down towards the manila envelope in my hand and gestured to me to hand it over.

‚ÄúYes sir, the information within‚Ä¶ Is of immense importance to not only the future of the United States‚Ä¶ but the entire world.‚Äù

His creased grey eyebrows perked for a moment, before he took the envelope and gently opened it. Spreading the pictures and readouts across his immaculate desktop, he analyzed each of them.¬†

‚ÄúTo say this is unprecedented would be an understatement‚Ä¶‚Äù I spoke up. His face remained stone as he looked over the assembled evidence. Not even a single sign of doubt or surprise.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can say, with confidence, that the Soviet Union has made first contact with extraterrestrial life. We are not alone, and our greatest enemy has made the first great leap. We may have just lost the space race.‚Äù¬†

The elderly, yet stone faced Korean man looked up again at me, his eyes narrowing.¬†

‚ÄúThis is not the end, Mr. Brand. This is only the beginning.‚Äù

Without a word more, he stood up and reached over to his desk phone. Inputting a three digit code, he raised the receiver to his ear.¬†

‚ÄúYes. This is a priority message. We need a secure line to the joint chiefs right away.‚Äù Silence hung heavily on the air, as he waited to hear their response. ‚ÄúPull him out of the meeting. He needs to be informed of a major development, immediately.‚Äù

The shimmer of determination in the venerable man‚Äôs gaze caused me to blanche as his intense stare settled intently upon me.¬†

‚ÄúTell the president we just had our own Sputnik moment‚Ä¶‚Äù

The staccato ring of my claws on polished concrete, the rhythmic heartbeat of this hidden center of science and research. The incessant tapping filled my ears, distracting me from the quiet conversations of my various compatriots, their hushed words accentuated by delicate tail posturing.¬†

As I made my way past them, several of them turned and gave a deferential waggle of their ears.¬†

*A sign of respect, for the job I volunteered for.*

All in the archives have sworn their lives to the task of recording, cataloguing and *fixing* every species in the Orion arm. It was our solemn duty and we did so without doubt or complaint. Of course, some species were more‚Ä¶ dangerous than others.¬†

Even the most dedicated of my peers had been surprised when I volunteered to work with one of our most challenging species.¬†

As I reached the wing labelled 243-G, I waved a hand paw towards the chief secretariat who managed access from the wings atrium.

She looked up at me, and gave a happy wag of her tail.

‚ÄúGood paw, Vexel! Did you sleep well?‚Äù

I gave an affirmative tail wag, and replied.¬†

‚ÄúYes, I am well rested and eager for today‚Äôs work. We made such fantastic progress last session.‚Äù

Her tail gave a single hearty whip, as she emitted a soft meeping sound. Laughter.

‚ÄúThis batch is far more conducive than the last... Do you think we might finally be able to fix them?‚Äù

I raised an ear in reply. ‚ÄúIt is hard to say. I feel like my current subject is more willing to work with my demands than the others. I am optimistic.‚Äù

She let the tip of her tail swing low and brush the floor, as she leaned forward and flipped the switch that held the maglock on the door closed.¬†

‚ÄúI certainly hope so. Losing that last batch broke my heart. I know they‚Äôre predators, but they have such funny personalities and character.‚Äù

I gave a chuffing noise in reply, and brushed her desk with the end of my tail as I walked past.¬†

‚ÄúThere is a person in there somewhere. I‚Äôll find it yet.‚Äù

With no further adieu, I stepped forward beyond the opened door and into the 243-G containment block. The sequentially activating lights revealed the many waiting cryo chambers, as well as a lone desk in the middle of the grand hall. At it, sat the young human who had shown the most promise of our last batch of defrosted subjects.¬†

He maintained his usual serene disposition, his gaze lifting up with snappy precision as his binocular eyes focused onto me. Though it made my skin shudder under my fur, I made no outward indication of its effects on me. Stepping forward, I approached the man.¬†

‚ÄúGood paw, Subject TZ-130863. Are you ready for today's session?‚Äù

The man gave no response, but stood to his feet and nodded. From where I stood, I could see as he lifted the small necklace he clung so tightly to and placed it on his neck, the lone shell casing dangling down on his breast under the plastic outfit.

‚ÄúGood. Let us begin.‚Äù

Even when he comes to roll coll before Seth arrives it's an excuse to talk to her that morning when he leans over that door soaring some time for the both of them before the day begins.

I did a 2 stage method of infusing the milk mixture with the spices straining it out and then adding the coffee cocoa powder, sugar and chocolate.

The spec below

6oz heavy cream
1 star anise
3 cinnamon sticks whole
10 peppercorns
5 orange slices( I used just naval but you can use a variety)

1i32itk,https://www.reddit.com/r/conan/comments/1i32itk/jordan_was_right/,Jordan was right,"Jordan was right about the meaning of 'espresso' in the Conan in Italy special episode, those who ""corrected"" him are the ones who were actually ""ignorante"", didn't get into the etymology and trie meaning of the word.

In Italian you talk about ""il suco espresso da un limone"" (the juice squeezed/compressed/""pressed-out"" of a lemon) like also tears squeezed out of one's eyes (like a child's crocodile tears). However coffee is not something you ""squeeze"" out. This type of coffee at least is not ""squeezed out"" - you don't squeeze the beans. If anything, it would be ""squeezing through"".

In Italian, the verb from which this participle derives, esprimere, is in English ""to express"" - like to express one's thoughts, etc. - or ""to make explicit or to explicate"", and by extension ""to make immediate or direct"". So you also have a fast train ""treno espresso"", or a quick meal ""piatto espresso"", or a quick coffee - ""caff√® espresso"".

So in the sense of the coffee espresso, it's in opposition to an alternative type of coffee (brewed) which took longer. An espresso is a ""quick, or fast"" coffee.

Here are some Italian webpages offering this etymological explanation (analogous to OED and similar):

http://www.garzantilinguistica.it/ricerca/?q=espresso

http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/espresso/

The history of the word is very different. The word espresso didn‚Äôt exist before the first decade of the 1900 when the adoption of the first steam pressure percolation coffee machines, allowed for the inception of a complete new way to drink a coffee. Until that moment, in fact, drinking a coffee was associated to seating in a caff√©, the italian word for coffee shops, and spending quite few time before you could actually be served your coffee.

The adoption of the new machines allowed to order and receive a coffee immediately, swiftly. Espresso become the term to indicate a beverage that you could be drinking on your way to the job place without wasting too much time. The image of a swiftly prepared beverage, was immediately associated to the speed and, consequently, to the train because one of the fastest train services in Italy at that time, was called ‚Äútreno espresso ‚Äì express train‚Äù.

This image was so vivid in the Italian culture that the first advertisement related to the espresso, goes back to 1922 when Victoria Arduino, one of the best and most famous espresso coffee machines manufacturer, contracted an agency to realize their new campaign. The image adopted for the campaign was that of a man standing on the train wagon steps while the train is running, holding himself to an handle with his right hand with half of his body outside the train while his left hand is grabbing an espresso cup from a tray.

Of course it was a completely different type of espresso. It was extracted through a percolation system and not a pressurized one. It was necessary to wait until 1961 and the advent of the Faema E61 and its revolutionary group head in order to be able to appreciate a real espresso coffee.",63,1737070053.0,conan,25,0.84,False

1i32gvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/fitpregnancy/comments/1i32gvy/vindication_gestational_diabetes_gtt_3_hour/,Vindication - Gestational Diabetes + GTT 3 Hour Results,"When I originally took the Gestational Diabetes test and failed it, I had a lot of questions. Most of which were never provided to me by my soon-to-be former OB-GYN.  So I'm writing this today, so that someone else can benefit from my unfortunate experience and avoid a lot of unnecessary stress. <3

TLDR: Had a crappy experience in testing which could've been avoided if I had fully understood the exam and things that could impact my results. Learn from my misadventure! **üò≠**

Firstly - Gestational Diabetes Test   
The test is a 1 hour glucose test, while not required by law (meaning you can just say no to taking the test), it is highly encouraged. This test is taken usually around the 20 week mark during pregnancy to ensure the Placenta (a *temporary organ* created to support baby) is processing sugar properly. Prior to the exam you are encouraged to eat / drink as normal and to schedule your exam 1-2 hours after eating. Once you're at the test site (in my case it was Quest Labs) you will be given a 50g sugary drink (FDA approved / flavor options will vary), that needs to be finished within a few minutes, and then wait an hour to have your blood drawn to test your bodies natural response to ingesting that much sugar. Although the initial range varies (some states and labs have differing levels that constitute a pass or fail), you'll get the results within 24-48 hours and your doctor will advise whether you officially passed / failed and if you happen to fail they will usually recommend a second round of testing known as GTT (I'll get to that later). 

Fun Fact - Recent research has found the placenta is much more impacted by the man's health than the  pregnant body that it's in. So if you happen to fail, there's a good chance its his fault and not yours at all! I found this comforting, as I don't have a sweet tooth, but my husband sure does! **ü§£**

Secondly - What you should know about the Gestational Diabetes Test The test is fairly straight forward, but some people may have an adverse reaction to the test (we're talking nausea, vomiting, fainting). The test itself has a HIGH false positive rate, so much so, that only 15% of people who take the follow up test GTT, have actually confirmed cases of Gestational Diabetes. There are a multitude of factors that can negatively impact your test results that are not related to race / age / genetic history that you have control over for example that include:    
  
Stress - I arrived at my exam site and was told I couldn't take the test because they were closing in 30 minutes and my doctors office failed to mention the blood draw had to be done an hour AFTER the drink. I literally rushed across the city to another exam site (which was also closing in an hour), because I was told I *HAD* to get the test done in a certain timeframe (20-21 weeks). Which turns out to not be true, some doctors request to have this test done earlier or even later then the recommended 20 weeks. My appoint was on a Friday afternoon and my next Doctors appointment was on a Monday. Needless to say I should've rescheduled both and saved myself a lot of running around.   
  
Illness - Contrary to what many doctors will tell you, being sick will impact your test. The test is supposed to see your bodies response to sugar under ***normal circumstances***. It's safe to say being sick with the cold/flu is not normal and your antibodies will be going ape-shit to heal you and baby. I had called my doctor telling her I needed to reschedule my GTT, because I had the flu and she stated it wouldn't impact the exam. I called Quest directly and their ***phlebotomist*** told me to reschedule as having the flu would definitely impact my exam, and to wait at least a week after I was done being sick to get tested. Additionally   they mentioned having the excess sugar in my body would probably make baby and I feel worse than we already did. So I listened to the trained professional and rescheduled my test. 

Thirdly - GTT + what I did to prepare + how was it?  
The GTT test is similar to the initial Gestational Diabetes test, but its double the amount of sugary drink (100g) and will take 3 hours to complete. The exam is a more thorough follow up to the initial testing and is done on a fully fasted stomach (so schedule it first thing in the morning). The recommendation is to begin fasting 12-14 hours prior to your exam and only drink water if necessary. The lab prefers you don't have anything but the sugar drink to avoid misdiagnosis. The **phlebotomist** will take blood samples a total of 4 times - when fasted and then every hour on the hour for three consecutive hours.  The test has multiple ranges for each blood sample taken and typically if you fail the first (fasting), then most doctors will consider it an automatic failure. Otherwise failing this exam is slightly more reliant on your doctors interpretation. Some doctors say being out of range for more than 2 blood samples is a fail, some say 1, it really depends on your doctors interpretation of the results. If you fail your doctor may recommend a simple diet modification and retesting at a later date, regular blood sugar monitoring (poke finger before/after meals), or even as much as taking insulin.   
  
I made a point the few days leading up to my test to eat clean meals (no processed foods). The night before I scheduled to eat dinner a bit earlier than normal (5pm), but had a moderately filling and simple dinner of chicken and broccoli (not the most appetizing). Seeing as I've been experiencing pregnancy insomnia, the hardest part was not getting up and having a snack at 3am. Otherwise I scheduled my appoint as first thing in the morning to avoid any stress response as my brain usually has minimal functioning capabilities in the early morning, so for me it was easy to set out my clothes the night before and just get up and go. I arrived a few minutes after they had opened and was seen very quickly. I spent most of my time between reading and playing on my phone, overall a boring morning.  
  
I can confirm the drink wasn't as horrible as I was led to believe, but it was a lot of sugar first thing in the morning. I had thought I was going to be starving after waiting 3 whole hours w/o eating and on no coffee, but surprisingly I never got hungry. I experienced a mild sugar crash (almost napped), some slight dizziness, and severe boredom. 

Vindication!  
I received my results this morning and not only did they confirm that I did not have gestational diabetes, but I could probably use a donut as my ranges were on the low side. Needless today I had many snacks and made myself some snickerdoodle cookies to celebrate. Baby and I are doing well, and we'll be meeting our new OB GYN at the end of the month. <3

1i32eqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Knoxville/comments/1i32eqj/a_technical_analysis_of_weigels_rewards_points/,A technical analysis of Weigels rewards points value & earning potential,"Hey everyone, I've been bored recently so...

Obviously I‚Äôve been spending my time trying to assign an accurate dollar value to my weigels rewards points‚Ä¶ and now I‚Äôm sharing it with you‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre welcome!

I took note of every product you could buy with points, focusing on both reward redemptions and typical retail pricing. Here‚Äôs a small sampling:

**Reward Redemptions**

* **400 Points:**¬†Free Medium Coffee, Free Everyday Water
* **600 Points:**¬†Free Medium Fountain, Free Ring Donut
* **800 Points:**¬†Free Gatorade Water, Free Milk Pint, Free Little Bites, Free Jail Breaker Chips
* **1000 Points:**¬†Save 10¬¢ Per Gallon of Gas, Free Pizza Slice

**Retail Prices**

* Everyday Water (20oz): **$1.49**
* Everyday Water (16.9oz): **$1.29**
* Ring Donut: **$1.59**
* Little Debbie Powdered Donuts: **$2.19**
* Weigel's Whole Milk Pint: **$1.69**
* Weigel's Brownie Batter Milk Pint: **$1.99**
* Pepperoni Pizza Slice: **$2.99**

I did my best to calculate the implied value of one point for each redemption, using the retail price as a rough proxy for value. I skipped the 10c gas per gallon reward for now since it's value is highly variable.

* **Free Ring Donut (600 pts):**¬†$1.59 / 600 points = $0.00265 per point. Averaging the value of the fountain to be that same of the donut, a value of 0.00265 per point.
* **Free Milk Pint (800 pts):**¬†$1.69 / 800 points = $0.0021125 per point, also using the brownie batter milk pint at $1.99/800 points = $0.0024875
* **Free Little Bites (800 pts):**¬†$2.19 / 800 points = $0.0027375 per point.
* **Free Jail Breaker Chips (800 pts):**¬†Since there is no retail price, we will average it in with other 800 point items.
* **Free Pizza Slice (1000 pts):**¬†$2.99 / 1000 points = $0.00299 per point.

**Results:**

* **Range of Values:**¬†$0.0021125 - $0.003725 per point.
* **Average Point Value (Mean):**¬†\~$0.0028 per point (or roughly 3.5 points per cent).
* **Median Value:**¬†$0.00265 per point
* **Standard Deviation:**¬†0.000524

It looks like average value is close to the median value suggesting the mean is somewhat accurate. The low standard deviation confirms the accuracy of our calculations. We can see that the value is slightly skewed by the value of the everyday purified water but it is important to include all data.

**My Conclusion:**

* A reasonable and¬†accurate¬†estimate of a Weigel's reward point is¬†**$0.0028 each.**¬†The range is still helpful to understand the variations in value based on how you are using your points.

This is a rough estimate. The ""real"" value depends on individual purchasing habits and if you are comparing this with purchasing an item or using points.

Next I wanted to figure out how many points you earned per dollar spent. This is where I‚Äôm less confident of my math. Since Weigels points expire, and I‚Äôm not a crazy person that keeps my weigels receipts, I was only able to find two intact receipts that were within the window where the app kept track of how many points were earned. So please take these estimations with a grain of salt.

**Receipt 1 (140 pts earned):**

* **Items Purchased:**
   * Takis Fuego: $2.29
   * Icelandic Glacial Water: $1.69
   * Monster Mango Loco: $3.49
   * Liquid Death Squeezed: $2.39
   * Pepperoni Pizza Slice: $2.99
* **Loyalty Rewards Applied:**¬†\-3.491.69,‚àí1.69,‚àí¬†
* **Final Total (After Loyalty):**¬†$8.24  ¬†The total amount of this purchase was $8.24 after loyalty rewards and earned 140 points. If we divide the points by the total spent, we get a value of 17 points per dollar.

**Receipt 2 (180 points earned)**

* **Items Purchased:**
   * BetterDay Kettle Chips: $1.99
   * Red Bull Energy: $3.79
   * Pepsi: $2.39
* **Loyalty Reward:**¬†0
* **Final Total:**¬†$8.17

The total amount of this purchase was $8.17 which earned 180 points. If we divide the points by the total spent, we get a value of roughly 22 points per dollar.

These two data points confirm that there is no 1 to 1 point to dollar ratio. We are seeing roughly a point earning rate of between 17 and 22 points per dollar spent.

The system does¬†not¬†appear to be a straight 1-point-per-dollar system, as was initially suspected. Rather, a point earning rate of approximately between 17 and 22 points per dollar. It is possible that some items have higher point earning rates than others. We have 2 transactions from the same store, earning significantly different points per dollar, which means the items may have some bearing.

Using an average point value of $0.0028 per point, and multiplying it by the points per dollar rates, 17-22 points, we can see a theoretical discount percentage of between (0.0028 \* 17) or 4.76% and (0.0028 \* 22) or 6.16%. With this range, I feel safe to say you‚Äôll earn about 5% back in Weigels point value per purchase made with a weigels reward card.

Can I get an NIL deal now please?

TLDR: Weigels points are worth about a quarter of a cent per point, and you earn about 18 points (or 5%) per dollar spent.",11,1737069739.0,Knoxville,4,1.0,False

The preferred shares are redeemable, non-voting, cumulative, non-participating, non-convertible, and come with no pre-emptive rights. ASLAG said the prefs ‚Äúopen an opportunity for ASLAG to raise funds for its pipeline and other expansion projects in support of its vision of having at least a 1000 MWp capacity by 2035.‚Äù ASLAG added that it aims to ‚Äútape other funding resources without necessarily diminishing the voting power and other rights of existing common stockholders.‚Äù

CEB said that domestic passengers increased 32% (85.4% SLF) and international passengers increased 29% (84.7% SLF). The airline carried 24.5 million passengers in 2024, up 17.6% from 2023. The management team said that the airline is ‚Äústrategically positioned to take advantage of the Philippines‚Äô economic growth and robust travel demand.‚Äù
>    - ***MB:*** Even if I had hundreds of billions of pesos to burn, I don‚Äôt think you could ever convince me to buy or start an airline. That press release from CEB sounds fantastic. If you didn‚Äôt have any context and just read that in complete isolation from reality, you‚Äôd probably assume based on the fantastic metrics that CEB was doing great and that the future was rosy and bright. Unfortunately for airlines and their shareholders, CEB needs to fly planes in reality, and in reality, fuel prices are high, the US dollar is high (and going higher) interest rates are high (and not coming down), maintenance is more expensive than ever, and new planes are ridiculously difficult to get. So while **2024 CEB** might be kicking the crap out of **2023 CEB** in terms of how many people it carried and how stuffed its airplanes were, 2023 CEB can still sleep soundly knowing that it was much more profitable, whereas 2024 CEB is likely double-fisting coffees while smashing F5 for the most recent PHP/USD forex price. CEB‚Äôs stock price is down 18% over the past year from its ‚Äúrevenge travel‚Äù high, and down around 40% from its post-COVID high.

>- **[NEWS]  DoubleDragon selling ‚Ç±10B worth of peso bonds in Q1...** **DoubleDragon** [DD 10.00 ‚ñ≤1.2%; 98% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=369568f2dcf8c2fdec6e1601ccee8f59)], the real estate development company owned by Injap Sia and Tony Caktiong, announced that it will sell up to ‚Ç±10 billion worth of bonds paying an interest rate of 7.77% per year. The sale, that DD said will occur in Q1 of this year, will be the second tranche of DD‚Äôs 2024 shelf registration, and will be made up of a ‚Ç±5 billion base offering and up to ‚Ç±5 billion in oversubscription inventory available. The company refers to this tranche as the ‚ÄúDD New Year TRIPLE-7 Retail Bond Offering.‚Äù DD said that the proceeds will be used to ‚Äúfurther strengthen its Balance Sheet -- all in line with the DoubleDragon‚Äôs goal to become a Tier-1 mature company by this year 2025.‚Äù
>    - ***MB:*** Nothing to say here, except that I‚Äôm a little confused by the branding and marking of this peso bond sale. The line about this being the ‚ÄúONE AND ONLY Peso Retail Bond offering of DoubleDragon for the entire year of 2025‚Äù seems to be framing this to trigger a scarcity reflex in potential buyers, but I don‚Äôt know anybody who be like ‚Äúdamn bro, I missed out on getting me any of them 2024 DD Peso Retail Bonds and I can‚Äôt wait to panic buy the hell outta them DD New Year TRIPLE-7s you know what I mean?‚Äù McDonald‚Äôs has the McRib for a limited time only, and DD has its annual Peso Retail Bond that we all think about for months, line up for when it‚Äôs here, and then cry about when it‚Äôs gone. I‚Äôm not hating here, it‚Äôs just odd. I at least support their attempt to do it a little differently. I can see they‚Äôre trying to reach a non-standard audience for bond-related content.

The main reason I bring this up now is because my brother wholeheartedly thinks I'm neurodivergent and he said it for these reasons:

I tend to order the same things in specific restaurants and for some reason can't order something else, like for example I always order cookies and cream ice cream, and always get the original chicken sandwich in Mcdonalds and Burger King while refusing to try any other burger from them, we have been going to a coffee shop recently, I ordered mocha first, didn't like it, next day I got dirty chai and now I always get it and I can't order anything else cus it gets me kinda stressed. Same thing with bubble tea, refuse to try any other flavor other than brown sugar cus it makes me upset.

I usually rewatch shows multiple times a year, BB9 I've watched it like 7 times the entire show and sometimes rewatch it right after finishing it and my friends all think its strange because they would get tired of rewatching something so often but idk

I've recently been playing a supermarket simulator (ik) and I can play it for hours even though there isn't much actual game play and I've been playing it everyday for at least a week now and idk when I'll stop but I usually do this often with different games and will stick to that game only for like 1 week to like a month or 2

If I hear a topic or something sparks my interest then I'll spend hours researching it or looking at videos about that topic and it usually happens when I have to focus on my school work which I suck at doing. So i can focus pretty long, like in reading something I want to for hours, or building legos or doing a puzzle for hours but I can't when it comes to school work

I also hate being touched but my love language is physical touch. I hate it when my parents or anyone else try to hug me or touch me. Like I like giving hugs but if someone tries to hug me I feel really uncomfortable

I also hate tags on my clothes but I feel like this is pretty normal, because we're latin we tend to have loud parties and a lot of people, I tend to dissociate at those parties and get kinda overstimulated and will definitely try to find a room to myself where it is quieter but idk if that's just cus im introverted  

Anyway I'm not doing this to be, idek but I've always wanted to visit a psychologist or therapist but my parents are hispanic and if yk then yk so that's is why I'm asking here, I'm just genuinely curious üòä thank you",3,1737069223.0,Neurodivergent,4,1.0,False

I find myself having much less anxiety & unnecessary worry in my life now that I‚Äôm not guzzling down energy drinks every ~4-6 hours (imagine that lol). I drank that liquid anxiety for nearly a decade, specifically Monster Rehab Tea/Lemonade. I could never get into coffee because I didn‚Äôt like how damaging it was to my teeth. 

I was at my great-aunts house early last year & she offered me some jade green tea that she bought from an online tea trading company & it was a heavenly experience. I had only had 7-Eleven bottled tea to that point, so I genuinely had not even considered that tea could possibly taste as good as that. Sure enough, within a month I was drinking loose leaf tea (albeit from Whole Foods), and haven‚Äôt looked back. 

It‚Äôs now been 11 months & I‚Äôve been learning a lot & loving all of the different types of teas & methods of infusion. It‚Äôs been a really unexpected blessing in a year that has been less than ideal as a whole.

1i322sj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/comments/1i322sj/creative_industry_skeleton/,Creative Industry Skeleton ,"Hey UK,

I was a kinship carer and it put a big dent in my career. I work as a Graphic Designer in London. I have worked across Branding and Advertising but love small studios where you really get to put the work in. 

UK economy and everything aside. I love what I do. It's been two years since I stopped being a carer. I've had permanent roles, that ended before the probation period. They were just really mallovent corporate jobs but as you can imagine getting back on my feet has been harder. The care responsibilities and bereavement after it ate all money. 

I'm currently homeless and taken any work I can. That aside I'm actually the healthiest I've ever been. I've managed to do some therapy to get over some things and all though life is tough, I really enjoy the bounce back. 

I got a contract come through a recruiter, it was my ex-boss. He was a abusive corporate man but I didn't have to deal with him directly. I've had to work with people from my previous company when taken on bugger corporate jobs. The people never changed. 

I saw my ex-director when I was in the city. He looked like a skeleton. Sleep deprived, think long hair, pale. Malnutritioned. Getting food is hard at the moment but I met sone friends for walks and coffees...they all commented on my appearance. I look good. These are the friends that are firmly honest with me. They weathered some of my carer storms. They are my people. 

I've had some days when I've rough slepted in the city and some weeks where I used shelters and hostels. Life aside, I am training or swimming in the morning, then fighting at night if I get the money. It's just what I love. 

Are we currently either choose health or wealth? 

Even in a corporate job it just hits the basics. 

I'm currently thinking of getting a basic Design job as I'm self-learning so much. I'm also thinking of getting a second job as a porter or something in my local community. 

One of the things I've been profoundly grateful for is the people I've met when in the community. The people I've met in services. I might not own a home but I can be a better part of my community. 

It's looking like some rough years ahead. I would rather enjoy them even if I just get by but love what I do. I've been a carer twice in my life. Once as a teenager and once a couple of years ago. I have a great ability to care and that ability doesn't really hold any value in some of the places I've worked. 

Has anyone made the switch like that? 

The good thing is I've been going to the local job fairs and I've got some things for agriculture and the canals. I do have Bipolar/Autism, one of my little hobbies is watching the birds and sketching them, I've even been tracking some otters in Clapton and know where the Terrapin's live in East London. 

I might sound mad but I think with everything going on I might of had my priorities straightened.

\- Focusing on high quality grass fed meats and easy to digest greens like baby arugula. 

\- Ofc no junk food, no sweets, no sugar in coffee.

\- My meals would consist of lots of good meat, seafood, oysters, some veggies ideally cooked, some white rice, sometimes peeled and boiled potatoes, easy to digest veggies like cabbage. Cabbage is really good. Plenty of fresh fruit. Avoid unripe fruit especially bananas.

\- I would try avoid high oxalate foods when using the enzymes. Almonds, brazil nuts. Opted for Walnuts instead. 

\- Avoided all plant based ""healthy"" bars. 

\- Kept a journal of what worked and what didn't. Experimented. Be a scientist! 

\- Learn meditation (TM) or spend time imagining living in a body that is perfectly healthy. Your imagination is a very very powerful ally, I would argue the only ally, and one most people have working against them. 

Now I can eat whatever I want. I mostly stick to a gluten free and dairy free diet, but I can literally eat anything without consequence. I eat fermented foods, sometimes I even go against my own advice and take a probiotic for fun (definitely not plantarum, acidophilus, or rueteri) Im always experimenting and good digestion is the basis of my further optimization of my health. My most common carb is white rice, and my proteins of choice are fish, beef, chicken, venison. I can go for months and months with no supplements whatsoever. My theory is that the enzymes broke down biofilms and helped clean shop in the intestines, broke down food enough to allow me to absorb nutrients more effectively, and reduced inflammation in the gut by breaking down plant toxins like lectins. Furthermore avoiding plant toxins in my diet allowed my system to heal and reset. Allowing it to heal itself also by not forcing probiotics and fermented foods down my throat. Now I eat them when they seem tasty. If anyone is reading this my biggest recommendation to anyone is if you are in pain right now, start with the enzymes, learn TM to help manage the stress, and learn to trust the flow. The universe/God/source is guiding you and you will come to your own unique solutions. I hope this is a place for you to start from. If you dont have time to learn TM, go into a quiet place, take some really satisfying deep breaths, relax deep into the silence and ask yourself, where should I start. Trust the intuition that comes. Our bodies are so intelligent. Your body is a masterpiece. Start affirming your healthy body today. The future is now. 

Thrive like you were born to!

1i3215u,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1i3215u/a_letter_never_meant_to_be_found/,A letter never meant to be found.,"It has been almost two years now since me and my girlfriend broke up and since then for the past 577 days, everyday, I have not been able to stop thinking about her. I started writing after we ended things to understand my emotions better. She would tell me often, she doesn't like how i keep my emotions bundled up and pushed to the side. I saw this time after we broke up as an opportunity to grow, so that's what I set out to do because i knew the she would be doing the same. At this point in time I had thought we had broken up because of distance but now there is potential that is not the truth. Although, that does not matter. The only thing ill know for sure is, I will never know.

A couple months ago I was starting to feel dissatisfied when writing to myself, that was due to the fact I had seen her in person for the first time since we had broken up. I was visiting my friends at their university and went out a bar when i ran into old friends out of nowhere. That is when I learned that she had transferred to a school that was only a 40 minute drive away from mine. For context, her house was almost and hour drive away from mine. Before we both decided it was best to end things, I can say confidently, we both gave every bit of our hearts to our long distance relationship as it was not easy at all. We fought not with each other but for each other that school year. at the end of the year she had gotten an amazing job that would mean she would have to stay the summer there. That took a toll on our relationship because the thing that we had been working towards the whole year which was our summer together was taken away from us. Consequently the end had seemed no where near. There was one day on a face time where she had a problem and there was no way I could help and from that we both looked at each other and started crying as we both had came to the realization at the same time that we could not do this anymore and said, ""you thinking what I'm thinking?"" Then on the count of three we both said at the same time, ""I think we should break up."" For the next two hours we began to just confess to each other and say everything we wanted to say as our final goodbye. It got to a point where it was hurting too cry. My sister overheard the end of our phone call and even she was crying. I was the one that had to make her feel better because she couldn't understand how two people who love each other so much couldn't make it work. I thought I needed to share this to help you understand when I tell you that when I learned that she was in such close proximity to me of where I go to school. My heart shattered and the rest of my night, week, month was ruined. After everything we had been through and said to each other why wouldn't she reach out to me.

The next day I decide to text her. Too let her know what I learned and to ask if she wanted to grab coffee to catch up as it had been awhile. Obviously that wasn't the only reason but it was the one i told her. We made plans for the next weekend before I hangout with my friends again. That whole week i was shattered. how can you still cry over a girl after it had been over a year? That whole week before I got to see her, I didn't sleep and couldn't eat. I was so anxious I could have crashed on my way driving there. Felt like I could have thrown up as well. I wanted to be there 10 minutes early because someone like her should never have to wait but as with her typical charm she shows up late. From behind me she walks through the door and it felt like my heart was gonna jump out of my chest. The moment I had been waiting for so long, finally happens, as she is dressed up in her ivy league outfit and walking towards me. I went into to hug the person that showed me what a hug truly means as i was greeted with a side hug, my heart began to sank but I try not to let myself show it. I should have expected that. A bit awkward at first but we finally make our way to the table.

Lot of things were said but I will write the highlights. One would be, her eyes as they were not the same. She used to look at me like in that moment I was the only person in the world. When she looked at me at the coffee shop, I could tell that she had moved on. I could have cried but I kept it together. Two is that I learned she had a some sort of relationship going on in her second year but that doesn't matter to me. From what it sounded like, it was no where near what we had. I also had a relationship but after 5 months i broke up with her for a lot of reasons but the biggest one of them all is that everyday that we were together I was still thinking about her. Three, she was so different. This one hurt. we both used to love music, like chill music. songs that you could read the lyrics of to understand what they are trying to say. but she had started listening to EDM and going to raves. We use to go to concerts like Joji and Kendrick Lamar. This is just one example but I hope your understanding what i am trying to explain. Is this what it means to move on? I tried to build myself up and become a better person after our relationship and I am sure she had done the same but it looks as if she had to change her ways and who she is in order to move on. Or maybe, this was who she was meant to be and I was holding her back from becoming that person. Four, her necklace. For her birthday I got her a very nice golden necklace with the first letter of her name on it. Gold because she never wears silver. Not that it matters but it is the most expensive gift I have gotten anyone. When I was sitting across from her, I noticed that she was not wearing it anymore. not even when she knew she was gonna see me that day. She had gifted me a chain for Christmas once, I don't think I could ever take this off, till the day I die. Obviously she shouldn't hold herself to the same standard but it would have made my heart whole to see her wearing it. I cant tell you how long we were sitting there for, if I had to guess maybe two hours but man that felt like 20 minutes maximum. I offer to drive her back and with a lot of thought and convincing she let me. I really wanted to do this one thing as it could be the last thing I ever do for her. Before she exits my car and I never see her again in my life, I tell her to listen to a song called Live Well by Palace. We bonded over music and sharing songs is what connected us at first, so now I thought what better way to end what we had by sharing a song. Before I went to see her I planned to tell her to listen to this song as I really wanted to tell her how I feel but I knew I couldn't do it. Therefore, I found the perfect song as a secret message. If she is any bit of the person i once knew she will listen to it and understand what I am trying to say to her. The rest of the night I was a zombie, as well as the following two weeks.

Two weeks later, I am sitting there crying in my room over a girl I had broken up with over a year ago. With heartache I began to write a letter but not to myself, too her. I do not regret it and I do not think I could have stopped the ache any other way. I needed to confess to her. Fuck. Even reading it now is hard. but to summarize it, I told her everything I felt. I told her that every day since we broke up I have thought about her. That i constantly read the many letters she had written for me except one. She had written one for me to read when I was feeling down on myself and needed someone to help me lift myself back up. I read that one shortly after. I told her how it felt when I looked in her eyes and I could see that she didn't feel the same way back anymore and how much that hurt me. Most importantly I told her how proud I am of the person she had become. I ended the letter telling her the reason that I wrote this is that I would find comfort in her just knowing how I felt, so I told her not to respond and that when we broke I thought it was the distance and it was, but now i am not to sure about that. When we broke up it was understood that we would have done anything to make it work but it was not a possibility. Now that distance is not the problem and she did not reach out to me. It really hurt. I did not tell her this but everything I had done was secretly to better myself for when I see her again in the future and the time is right. Where we could fall in love with each other all over again and nothing would stand between us. I wanted to be a good enough man that she could marry. Lastly, I told her that it had felt like we were breaking up all over again. When we originally broke up, I had hopes of us getting back together. Now, I have no hope left for that. I knew that it was the end of us and that even if she wanted to make it work i was transferring to a different school next year and we would be far away from each other once again but the thing is she never knew that. She thought I was only 40 minutes away. Not so surprisingly, when I told her not to respond... she doesn't.

After writing the letter I just cry for I don't know how long. I reach a point where I go downstairs and I look at my mom and ask her for a hug as I cry on her shoulder. This really did feel like we had broken up all over again. I have been through a lot and I never cry. She has that impact on me. I decided I needed to make changes. I needed to throw out these letters. They serve no purpose If for the rest of my life I'm going to be living without her. There is no point reminiscing on the past when its stopping me from moving forward. Although, I can never imagine myself removing this chain. This will always stay with me till the day I die. Over 100 days after seeing her for the first time in a long time. A day still hasn't passed where I have gone without thinking of her. Although there is nothing I can do. Our circumstances haven't aligned and even if they did, who knows if she would even want to get back together or if we would even work out. So much uncertainty yet I would do anything to have her in my arms again. Everything since then in my life seems fake and I don't understand what I'm doing. I hope that one day I do.

As much as I see her as the love of my life. That is not a fact, it is a feeling. No one knows what my life is gonna pan out like. I miss you Sarah and I will Love you forever. I hope that by leaving this letter to drift in the vast expanse of the internet, I might find some semblance of comfort and the strength to move forward.",2,1737068687.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

What would be the easiest way to get this coffee to the US?

Would it make sense to contact a coffee importer in the US about this, or a coffee exporter in Colombia?

Do commercial roasters ever source their beans this way, on this scale?

1i31yhq,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1i31yhq/kinda_funny_but_still_annoying_my_normally/,"Kinda funny, but still annoying: My normally JustYes mom is 100% convinced I'm pregnant. I'm not.","I know this situation is so minor compared to what others here are going through with Moms and MILs, but advice would be appreciated.

My mom is normally very much a JustYES kind of a person.  She's supportive, kind, reliable, and importantly knows when to treat me like a daughter and when to treat me like a fellow adult who's capable of making her own decisions.  So this is current situation is out of nowhere and very annoying for me, but my fianc√© thinks it's hilarious.

A few months ago I started a healthier overhaul of my life.  I make sure I get a good night's sleep every night, I'm exercising more, I'm eating so much better than before, I've given up coffee and energy drinks throughout the day.  You know, adulting correctly.

A couple of months ago, my mother commented that my skin was ""glowing.""  I just reminded her that I'm being a lot healthier and it's probably showing in my complexion.  

Christmas came and at Christmas dinner she offered me a glass of wine.  All she had on offer was sauvignon blanc and pinot gris because she only drinks white wine.  I can't stand white wine and only drink red and my mom knows this.  But because my skin is glowing and I turned down alcohol, I'm clearly pregnant, right? 

The next day my mom called me and asked me if there's anything I need to tell her.  I hadn't made the connection yet (because my skin does look better and I don't like white wine, big whoop) and insisted everything was fine.

On New Year's Eve my grandmother greeted me with her normal hug and then put her hand on my stomach and said, ""Before the wedding?"" and proceeds to frown (she's old school Catholic).  A little later I asked my mother why my grandmother thinks I'm pregnant and my mom replied, ""You don't have to keep it secret, you know.  A mother knows.""  I told her I was not in fact pregnant and she gave me that ""Sure, Jan..."" look. We got into an argument and I left early.  I was going to have a few sips of champagne at midnight and because hindsight is always 20/20, I wish I had stayed and done that to show her I am not knocked up.

Since then I've had a few people (aunts and cousins) text me cryptic messages like they know the secret (quotes about motherhood, how my fianc√© will be an amazing father *one day*, that they hope my niece has a best friend soon, etc).  I responded to each of them that they must have texted the wrong person since I'm not pregnant, but I hope whoever is is looking forward to their bundle of joy.

I'm just so annoyed because I'm not pregnant!  I've told my mother I'm not pregnant. Can't I just use a nice moisturizer and not have shitty wine?  And even if I were pregnant, it would be *my* news to share!

Some coffee producers hit back,¬†**claiming that the lighter roasts are appropriate for filtered coffee, but that for espressos and mokas, which is how the vast majority of Italians consume their coffee, a darker roast is more appropriate.**

It is not the first time I hear this claim, but why would that be? I struggle to follow the logic. Why shouldn't it be the opposite?

**Darker roasts tend to be more bitter than lighter ones.**

**The extraction method also impact bitterness**, with (in my experience, please clarify) moka being the most bitter, then espresso, then filtered.

I have tried various types of roasts and extraction methods, and I have found that:

* I can drink a filtered coffee made from dark roasts. It's not my preference, but it's drinkable
* I cannot drink an espresso (unless I add sugar or milk) from dark roasts - I just find it too bitter for my taste. With Mokas, even more so.
* My preference is, in fact, espresso from medium or medium-dark roasts. I like the intensity, the concentration and the crema of the espresso, and not-too-dark roasts have the right balance of acidity without being bitter
* I also like filtered coffee from medium or medium-dark roasts, but I tend to prefer the espresso above

**Isn't it just a matter of preference? If you like bitter coffee, espresso + dark roast will produce a bitter result. If you don't like bitter coffee, espresso + medium roasts is better.**

Or is there something I am missing, whereby, regardless of personal preferences, dark roasts are really more appropriate for espressos? 

FWIW,¬†**I think most Italian coffee is a very dark roast because it's cheap: you can roast the hell out of a poor quality bean and of a good quality one and get a fairly similar taste. But medium-roast a good quality and poor quality one, and you will see the difference.**¬†It doesn't help that many coffee roasters in Italy make anti-competitive agreements with the coffee shops: they give them machinery for free, but they must buy coffee only from them.",1,1737068333.0,espresso,12,0.6,False

To this day, he still insists to meet again","I met this guy through a WhatsApp group to meet new people in my area but it happens he also uses Grindr so every time he creates a new account he texts me. He has texted me off and on since we met in August 2020. I have never answered him (except for once) and I have always blocked his profile, sometimes in advance when I see a picture of him.

Some of the messages he drops me are like this:

'I would like to meet you again, I hope you reconsider it. Don't be so resentful'

'You sat me well when we met but I thought you didn't like me, so if you want to meet I am available (...) I'd like to meet with you again because you told me you liked me"" (yes, I know it is weird to text someone you know they don't like but it is also weirder to contradict yourself in the same paragraph with that assertion!).

'I don't want you to have grudges against me. I would like to make amends with you.'

'Are you going to be mad at me for the rest of your life? I would like to meet with you again. I am sorry if I behaved badly, don't be so resentful, at least we can be friends but I don't want a bad vibe with you'.

I have said I never answered him except for one time when I asked him to stop insisting, but he insists all over again.

I am absolutely staggered by this. Never had I imagined a guy would be so insisting just for having met once in person. Literally, meeting for two hours yielded this result... I wouldn't have met with him had I known this would happen.

When we met we just had a coffee and chatted, ended on good terms, but days later I saw he blocked me on Instagram, which he denied several times until he owned up. He claimed he did so because he thought I disliked him, but he was down to meet again if I wanted. I'm not keen on being lied and being denied the obvious so I told him I no longer wanted to keep in touch because that could happen again with other issues, even though it seemed petty getting mad for that issue (instagram).

Anyway, here we are. I am sure he will text me again when he creates a new Grindr account.

Hey fellow Bianca lovers. About 3 weeks ago, I got my Bianca and it served me well making delicious daily espressos (big step up from my old Rancilio). 

Today, as usually I turned on the machine, waited for it to heat up, prepared coffee and when I turned up the lever, the water was not flowing at all!

I tried checking if it's the reservoir, switched from lelit filter to the small mesh filter, Cliff & Pebble suggested trying filtered water instead of my usual RO+third wave espresso, but nothing helped, the Bianca pump is only humming, but no water is pumped anywhere. I tried priming the machine again and it failed too.

I got a case with Lelit, but until they contact me, I'm trying to see if anyone had a similar issue.

1i31oud,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1i31oud/stalker_co_worker_stories/,Stalker co worker stories. ,"Share your stalkers stories here. I'll start. We had someone start working in our kitchen  just over a year ago.

When he started, he was bubbly but a little bit slow with his work. I took him under my wing after he confided in me that he suffers from anxiety. When my lead chef mentioned to me that he is a slow worker (this guy was hired to be a kitchen assistant, so do the dishes, light prep, cleaning and all round assisting) I told my LC to give him time. He just needed some extra guidance which I was happy to give. 

He slowly started to pin to me. He would constantly come and see what I was doing. (I hate people hovering over me when I am doing something, it makes me mess up) He also likes standing there and just listening to whatever conversation you are having with another person. I chalked it all to maturity. I deduced that he must have a mental maturity of a 15 yr old in a 30 yr old's body. Because he still lives with parents and does everything and goes everywhere with his mum. (Think Norman Bates) I would see some red flags here and there when he would message me when I was in a different country on a island holiday with my family on my actual birthday, just to tell me work drama about not getting help with the dishes and things. 

We also hang out in a small group with some other Co workers. He would be the gay guy, sitting there with all of us women in our 40's and 50's. The rest of the women and I would be sharing about what we did with our families over the weekend and just what you would expect a busy working mother and wife to chat about. He would be just sitting there and talking about his mum and where she went and what she thinks. It was all a bit odd, but once again we just didn't realize the depths of what was to come. 

He would message me daily and always started with 'how are you today?' because he and I work in a small kitchen team, he works different times and shifts from me but he would be messaging me just to tell me someone took a longer lunch break then they were meant to, or this person had their phone on loudspeaker at lunch. I would just reply with a 'lol' and agree that it was an annoyance etc etc. As always, there would be one or two person that would grind us so he would be telling me things about co workers he knows I cannot stand. It got to a point where I said to him that I do not want to talk about all this ppl esp the ones I hated when I am not at work. 

Work gossip is normal and we all do it, but I'm home with my family and I don't want to talk about work when I am home. He said ok, and did not stop. Eventually I would stop replying to messages. I will then see him at work the next day and just give an excuse that I didn't check my messages. 

One day when he and I were working together, I excitedly came to work and told my lead chef that I needed a day off cos I got tickets to go watch a sports game with my family. It so happens that he goes for the same team me and my family do. Him and his family are staunch supporters who have memberships and things. Which means he gets to go for any matches he wants whenever. The games season also means that matches are on frequently. As soon as he heard I was going to a game on this specific day with my family. He put in a day off the same day and coincidentally decided that he too was going to the footy with his family to watch the same game.

On the day of the game, I was trying to make a day of it, with my family. We took the train, looked around the city, had a nice lunch etc etc. The whole day up until the end of the night. He would message me asking me where I was, what I was doing, where I was sitting etc etc. I was starting to feel like he would just come behind me and just stand there and scare me. I even said to my husband that I am never coming to watch a game again. 

I decided that I would restrict him on socials so he would not see me online. It did not stop him from messaging me on different portals asking me 'how I am' and If I'm ok or if I'm mad at him cos I was not responding. One day I was out having coffee on our days off with another co worker and he messaged us both asking what we were up to. We literally felt like he was looking at us from a window somewhere. 

He would message me and others constantly and it was getting draining. He outed another co worker without his consent by telling everyone how he found him on Grindr. As time went on, I ended up blocking him on a total of 4 different apps so that he could not reach me. My husband could see this taking a toll on me and basically just told me to ignore him. 

When I see him at work, I try to keep things civil and just exchange pleasantries like how are you, but the moment I do that, he would come and and stand with me and just tell me crap I don't want to hear about who is doing what with their time. The final straw was when he kept trying to get me to go his birthday party and I made some excuse so I wouldn't go and on the day of his bday I did not wish him but he messaged me on our work app just to engage with me so he can remind me it's his bday so I would wish him. 

I went straight into the assistant managers office and told her I can't take it anymore. She sat down listened to everything I said, and shared that she had to step away from a friendship with his cousin because he was trying to use that as a way to get close to her. Nobody was safe. Everyone had been personally been targeted and stalked by him. He would esp harass the young guys who were not interested cos he thought 'they were hot'. 

Long story but he got a talking to and now does not speak to me at all, but we still work together and he will always be looking as soon as he hears a conversation taking place. He will then pass on information he harvests and spread it to different departments. There's no point in telling HR cos they never do anything so whenever he is working, none of us talk anymore. It's actually made the work place really hostile whenever he is around. ",3,1737067751.0,coworkerstories,0,1.0,False
