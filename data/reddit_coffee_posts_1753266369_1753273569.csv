\------

Everything after the motel was nothing more than a blur. After checking that his belongings were still in the room, James donned his winter clothing and took a ride with the deputy south towards the hospital that sat in Pinecreek. He was seen by the medical staff still lingering at the tail end of their graveyard shifts. Having been admitted around five in the morning, James was treated for his broken nose; his leg, although injured at the shin’s skin, had not suffered a broken bone.

While alone in the room where he was treated, he felt a looming anxiety—it was as if whatever had been back at the motel would somehow, and in some way, show up to terrorize him again. As the minutes passed by, though, the only thing that would show up was the same deputy who had brought him in.

*“Well, everything’s been done and accounted for over here. You’re free to go.”*

*“...I don’t have a way back to town.”*

*“Sir, I’m afraid to tell you that I can’t ferry you everywhere you need to go. The folk up front can fetch a ride for you, I’m sure of it.”*

*“…Okay. Well, thanks for what you’ve done for me, man. I... I know that I sounded pretty crazy back there. I swear, though, everything that I told you is true, God as my witness.”*

*“It’s not up to me to decide those things while on the clock. Like I told you before, I can’t say you’re lying. Just try to be careful, you know?”*

*“Yeah. I forgot, in between all of this, to ask—what’s your name, mister... Chamberlain?”* James said, his mind calm enough to finally notice the deputy’s name tag.

*“Daniel,”* he replied, turning as he spoke. *“Have a good day now, sir. If you remember more—or have any questions—feel free to visit the office. Say you’re acquainted with me already. We’re just up the road north from where you’re staying at.”*

Deputy Chamberlain was gone, responding to indiscernible chatter on his radio as he made his way out of sight. James rose with deliberate slowness from the hospital bed, pain dulled by medicine as he put weight back onto the leg that had been struck. He walked out with a gingerly gait and went to talk to the nurses gathered near the front desk, awaiting the end of the overnight shift. With their help, he heeded the officer’s advice and arranged for a cab to pick him up.

When the hospital lobby’s clock reached about six-thirty, it finally arrived; the words **ATKINS TAXI** emblazoned across a white sedan’s side, visible through the ice-slick glass of the lobby’s façade. James left and climbed inside the car, utterly tired from the combination of medicine and what happened earlier.

His consciousness lapsed once more as the cab took the country roads back up toward Cedarcrest, drifting into an involuntary, dreamless sleep with the help of the car’s heater.

\---

The cab creaked slowly to a stop as it found purchase in the parking lot of the motel, where James was then roused awake by the driver. With the fare paid, James opened the door and stepped out, finding himself awash in the red and orange light of dawn flowing across the open sky. Although dreadfully tired at this point, James knew there would be little time today for long-term rest.

James plodded his way toward the motel office as the cab peeled off, finding a middle-aged man instead of Cathy sitting behind the desk.

*“Hello there, mister! You’re that James fellow, right?”* he asked, his face betraying some surprise.

*“Yes, sir. Cathy, uh... she told me—”*

*“Oh, I know! She’s moved you to 110 now. No worries about the cost, too; we took that night off your bill for you.”*

*“...In that case, tell her I said thanks. I really appreciate it.”*

*“No problem,”* the man said, extending a hand. *“Almost forgot to say—the name’s Jim.”*

James reached out and shook his hand in kind. *“Good to meet you, Jim.”*

*“Now, we had to leave your belongings in 106 until the sheriff’s boys gave us the okay to do anything else. Want me to help you move your stuff to the new room?”*

*“Nah, I’ll be fine; it’s just a bag. Thanks for the offer, though.”*

*“No problem. Might be a little crude to say this to you now, but… I’m sure you’ll love being here in Cedarcrest. It’s just a real damn shame it all started off on the wrong foot. You’re staying for a week, yeah?”*

*“That’s right.”*

*“What for, if you don’t mind me asking?”*

*“I’m just here to visit a friend. From the Coast Guard, when we served together.”*

*“You served, huh? Well then, I should be thanking you for your service! What’s your friend’s name, by chance? I probably know him, given how close us folk are around here...”*

*“It’s David. David Hiers.”*

James saw Jim briefly contemplate it, his hand resting on his salt-and-pepper chin for a moment.

*“David...? David... ah, yeah, I think that I know him! He’s the guy who opened that boat and raft store some years back, if I’m remembering right. Makes sense now why he went and did that!”*

*“Yeah. Me and him talk regularly about the boating business. I have a little repair shop of my own down in New Orleans…”*

*“Ah, now that’s just quite nice! Well, I’ll stop badgering you. Must’ve been a long night, from what Cathy’s told me. If you need anything, one of us is always in here. 106 is open for you now—you can go in and get what you need.”*

*“Alrighty, then,”* James said as he accepted the keys for the new room. He waved goodbye to the male attendant as he left the office, the sky now morphing into a light blue and yellow. As he gazed up at the display, the first bright inklings of sunlight began to reach over the treetops of the dark forest that lay across the street. He stood there, the gauze taped across his nose and the pain in his leg an afterthought, as he took in the distant chirps of birds awakening for the new day.

James felt, just for a moment, at peace again.

After a sluggish return to reality, he lugged himself over to Room 106 with pangs of dread beating in his chest. Opening the door, he immediately turned on the entrance light and dashed to open the blinds, sending in the soft dawn light to dimly illuminate what lay within. Apart from the duffel bag on the floor and the dark red stain near the now-silent television, there was nothing out of the ordinary. He picked up his duffel bag, scanned the room once more for anything he might have missed, and promptly left with an urgency in his step.

James shut the door and turned left, walking down the overhang toward the front of Room 110. Opening it with the new set of keys he had been given, that same chill crept down his spine as he looked into the dark, dispelling it with 110’s own entrance light. James placed his bag next to the bed and glanced around. This room, much like 106, was nothing more than a bed, a chair, and a television. Even so, there were minute differences he could spot between the two, such as differing bedsheet patterns. Not wishing to give it more thought, though, he left the room and locked it thereafter before heading down to the payphone that sat at the end of the motel’s wing.

After inserting some change, he dialed David’s number and stood in the morning chill, a free hand buried once more into his pocket. The buzz of the tone went on in his right ear for some time. It left James to look around idly amidst the cold dawn, watching his breath rise and drift away. Just when he thought this plan might be useless, his call was finally picked up.

*“...Ugh, hello? Hello? Who’s this?”*

*“It’s James, man. Wanted to tell you that I finally got here. I thought you woke up earlier than this?”*

*“Oh, goddamn it! Is it seven already? Well, anyway, how are you doing?”*

*“Like total shit. I got here from Albany at around midnight. Then, at around four in the morning… someone broke into my motel room. I’ve even got the broken nose to prove it.”*

*“…What the hell!? Did you manage to fuck up that asshole in return?”*

James laughed slightly at David’s words. *“I wish. I’ll tell you more about it later.”*

*“Alright. Well, I’m sorry to hear that happened to you, brother. You can crash at my place if you want to.”*

*“Nah, I’m fine for now. I don’t want to make your wife upset or anything. I’m just too tired today to drive, though, and I spent money on a cab to take me back to the motel from the hospital. You might need to pick me up.”*

*“Oh, yeah, sure. No problem. I’ll be there in about… ten or so minutes? Yeah, ten. Let’s hit up a diner first—I’ll be buying for both of us.”*

*“Thanks, man. I’ll wait.”*

The line went dead. James slid the phone back with a metallic clunk and, while turning to walk back toward his new room, noticed a yellow school bus chug along the street. Curious, he followed the bus with his eyes at it rounded a corner near the motel office. Behind the motel’s property sat a large expanse of buildings, with more yellow buses emerging and departing in kind, cars and trucks nearby letting out kids and teens alike. He realized that a school had been right next to him the entire time. One he hadn’t even seen the night before through the snowy haze, somehow.

This newfound fact sat low in James’s core, considering what happened to him a few hours ago. He hoped that whoever broke in wasn’t planning to hang around the school as well—for everyone’s sake.

James took out the pack of cigarettes he’d bought, putting one between his lips before lighting it with the fluid left in his lighter. He leaned against the wall next to his motel room and took a drag, the anxieties of last night briefly fading with the buzz he had so craved.

\---

True to his word, David did not take long. As the day began to manifest in full spectacle, with a rich, cloudless blue blanketing the sky, metal grumbles from a beige Toyota sounded as it pulled up in front of James. He had gone through multiple cigarettes by this point, their ashen remains sprinkled around him on the concrete and snow.

After putting the car in idle, David stepped out and raised both hands in a welcoming gesture.

*“There he is! Oh, damn,”* he said, dropping his arms as he noticed James’s broken nose. *“You look like you’re beaten to shit. A shame you didn’t punt the son of a bitch who did it.”*

*“Yeah...”*

*“You still haven’t quit the cigs, James?”* he said, motioning toward the ashes as he rounded the car. James dropped the butt he had remaining and stomped it into the slurry on the ground before catching David in a brief but firm hug.

*“I’ve been trying, man. But out of all the times that I want to... it’s almost like God knew I’d need it today.”*

*“Nah, it’s all good. I just hope you still want to eat something after all that shit, you know?”*

*“Not anything big, but yeah. I do.”*

*“Go ahead and hop on in, then,”* David said as he returned to the driver’s seat. *“This winter’s been a real bitch lately.”*

James opened the passenger door and sat inside; the cold was shunted away by the heat blowing directly onto his face. Condensation formed on the windows as both men shut their doors, with James staring at the drops as they rolled down. With David pulling out and onto the main road, they spotted the tail end of the school’s morning activity.

*“So, how are things back in your town?”* David asked, breaking the silence.

*“It’s just the same old shit. My cousins are helping run the shop while I’m gone, so I don’t have to worry about that at least...”*

*“Ha! That’s just like me with this kid, Barry, that I hired recently. I stick him in the shop four days out of the week, show him the ropes when I need to. Gives me time to hunt and range.”*

*“You fancy yourself a hunter now?”* James said, curious. *“I remember you back down south saying you hated outdoorsy stuff.”*

*“I changed, I guess. There’s not a whole lot to do up here if you aren’t the outdoorsy type, anyway.”*

After a brief silence held in the air, James was the first to speak.

*“What was it that made you move up here, really? You kept talking about going to New York City proper or just heading back home to Atlanta.”*

*“Honestly? It’s quiet. That’s what I needed. My parents left Georgia during our last years in the service, so there was no real point going back. And, having visited New York for a bit... the noise of it all was just driving me insane after a while.”*

*“A boat’s engine noise doesn’t annoy you, but city noise does?”*

*“I can’t explain it, man. I guess I’m just not tuned for the urban life, you know?”*

*“Fair enough. New Orleans is starting to get on my nerves, too, to be honest. It’s part of the reason I came up here... just needed a break for a bit. That’s all.”*

*“Oh, yeah; I think you’ll love it here.”*

*“The guy who runs the motel pretty much said the same thing to me. Is there some sort of PR campaign going on?”* James joked.

*“Is it PR if it’s true? I mean, it’s cold as hell, yeah—I’ll give you that much. But during the spring and summer, it’s almost perfect. The township as a whole is growing pretty fast, too. It ain’t so quick that the ‘spirit of it flies away,’ as some of the old-timers keep saying, but there’s enough new blood like me to keep things lively rather than be a nursing home.”*  
  
The conversation was cut short as David turned left across the breadth of the snow-swept road, pulling into a small parking lot that sat beneath a comically oversized blue dinner plate. Such a grandiose sign was held up by a stone pillar, the words **“BLUE PLATE DINER”** embossed across the snow-crusted rim of the plate. They were surrounded by the thickness of the woods, each tree laden with last night’s snow across every visible branch.

*“You said that Cedarcrest’s growing fast, right?”* James asked as the two stepped out of David’s car.

“*Yeah. Have you been convinced to move here that quickly?”* David said, pointing at his friend with a slight grin. *“Must be something in the air.”*

*“You wish. Nah, I’m asking because of what I saw driving up here. Pinecreek has a whole mall and hospital, all looking brand new. I’m just wondering* ***how****.”*

*“That place is right off the highway between Albany and the western parts of the state, so it makes sense that it’s growing like that. Maybe the city folk are finally getting tired of the chaos.”*

The two passed through the swinging doors of the diner’s entrance, soon finding themselves led by a waitress to a booth at its far end.

*“Alright, then; do you want to get into it all while we wait?”* David asked, clearly interested in what story was in store.

*“I’m telling you, David—what happened ain’t as flashy as you’re thinking it is. It’s not a movie scene.”*

*“Who cares? Just hit me.”*

With a sigh to start it off, James gradually began to tell his friend the timeline of his night terrors, their food arriving midway through. David started to eat his breakfast with eagerness while James picked at a small serving of eggs. He mostly opted to partake in the cheap coffee instead.

When the story reached the part about what the intruder looked like, the conversation began to shift in tone.

*“...I couldn’t bear to tell the cops this, or even the people running the motel. The thing moved like... like a hurt dog, or some other animal. Limping, or something like that. It wasn’t like a person. I thought that there was enough light in the room for me to have seen something on its body, too, but... nothing. There was literally nothing* ***to*** *see. It was like looking into a fucking... I don’t know, nothingness? I know it sounds crazy, but honestly, I don’t know what to make of it.”*

*“It could just be that you were half-asleep when this started, right? Like, your mind still making stuff up—screwing you over with your own imagination. That sort of thing.”*

*“I don’t know. I’m really hoping that’s what happened.”*

*“Dude, what the hell else would it even be?”* David said, stifling a laugh. *“Come on, now. There’ve been times when I’ve woken up thinking I was on a whole ‘nother planet. Freaky stuff can just happen sometimes without it being a ghost.”*

*“I don’t believe in that shit either. You’ve lived here for how long, though? Almost four years now?”*

*“Yeah. What about it?”*

*“Have you heard of anything like this happening before?”*

*“...No. Doesn’t mean some drunk moron or homeless guy wasn’t trying to get warm, though. It’s been pretty damn cold—more than the usual winters are.”*

*“I guess...”*

*“Well, regardless—what’s done is done. Besides your nose, nothing else bad happened to you, yeah?”*

*“My leg got fucked up a little, but you’re right. They didn’t steal anything I had with me, at least.”*

*“There you go,”* David said, pointing his fork at James. *“Positive reflection—or whatever the hell the shrinks call it. Does wonders.”*

James watched the steam slowly rise from his depleting coffee, ruminating over what David had told him. It didn’t bring him much comfort to think that what had happened was the result of his own brain running off the rails; on the other hand, the thought of someone truly breaking into his room as he slept was just as chilling.

He decided to leave those thoughts by the wayside, asking David a question to lighten his own mood.  
  
*“So... what’s the plan for after we leave, David?”*

*“Well, I can take you to the house to meet Rebecca—she’s been wanting to meet you ever since I told her that you were heading up here. After that, maybe we can go hunting down at Cedarfield if you want. It’s that stretch of woods you probably passed on your way here.”*

*“I don’t think I’m in good shape today for something like hunting, if I’m being honest.”*

*“Shit, I forgot about that. You slept like what—three hours at most? Damn... well, in that case, maybe you’d like to check out the shop I have? It’s not too far away; just between Cedarcrest and Ashleighville.”*

*“Sure thing, man. I’m interested to see what you’ve got going on.”*

After paying for both meals, David left the diner with James in tow. They brushed through the short piles of snow back to the former’s car, the morning sun now rising higher above their heads.

*“The work’s nothing too crazy,”* David said, continuing the conversation as they got back in the car again. *“People like to fish and raft around a lot in the lakes around here, so I mostly deal with small craft. The real boating work usually comes from the state government renovating their boats, or people from nearby counties looking for deals.”*

*“You get offers from the state for boating work? How did that happen?”*

*“Well, it wasn’t a good start, I can tell you that. There was a kid who up and went missing in Schenectady not long after I got the business up and running. Some guys from the state came to me, said they wanted to get their search boats up and running to look through the Mohawk.”*

*“Did they ever find the kid?”*

*“...Nope. It was a sad thing, all around. The locals say it reminded them of the crap that happened right here in Cedarcrest a few years back.”*

*“What are you talking about?”* James asked.

*“...Wait, what? The Lakeview Skinner, dude—you don’t know anything about him?”*

*“I have no idea who the hell that is, man.”*

David let out a brief whistle of surprise at James’s genuine confusion.

*“Really? Even my parents knew about that shit when they were all the way down in Georgia. It was all over the news back then! I’d just be doing the story wrong by telling you about it myself. You should hear it from someone who lived through it. My wife was right in town when all that horrible shit went down.”*

*“The hell?”*

*“Yeah, man, it was batshit insane. Not a lot of people here like bringing it up, and I don’t blame them. Besides Rebecca, I suggest you don’t bring it up with anyone else. You’ll just be seen as one of those kinds of tourists, if you know what I mean. We get those sometimes. Kids who want a tour of all the places where the bad shit happened...”*

*“Alright.”*

As they made their way to David’s home, lying east of Cedarcrest’s town center, they spotted soft clouds of white puffing up from the road ahead. With each passing second, they drew closer—soon spotting the first in a line of cars traveling in the opposite lane.

A white Crown Victoria adorned with the livery of the Atkins County Sheriff’s Office flew by, followed by a similarly white van marked with the letters **“CIU”** across its sides. Behind this large vehicle was another Crown Vic, sputtering snow across portions of David’s windshield in its feverish rush to keep up with the others. All three vehicles sped westward, sirens and lights ablaze.

*“What the hell!? Wow,”* David shouted, annoyed as he engaged the windshield wipers. *“Assholes are really in a rush today, huh?”*

*“What gives?”* James asked, peering at the small convoy as it disappeared into a thicket of trees, rounding a curve in the road behind them.

*“Maybe they found that hooligan of yours trying to break into someplace new. Watch it be some bum from New York City—or maybe even Buffalo. I’d put ten bucks on it.”*

James didn’t respond, lost in silent thought. Even though David was clearly joking, a nagging feeling wormed its way deep into James’s stomach, tugging at his mind. He was safe now, that much was true. He still felt no real sense of closure.

He regretted the yearning in his heart to know the truth of last night. From the deepest pit of his soul, a whisper told him it was something he could never bear to speak aloud as fact.",1,1753273181.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Friday, July 18 – EPCOT & Test Track Preview

Drove from South Florida (about 3.25 hours with 1 stop) to Pop Century where we waited in the lobby to join Test Track Passholder preview VQ at 1pm. Callback for 4:40pm was pretty much on target. This was my first-ever Passholder preview ride, which was exciting. Room was ready and we got room  #319 Building 10, 70’s. It was an adjoining room, not our favorite, but only one night and no complaints. Freshened up, reapplied sunscreen, and headed to EPCOT via Skyliner. It was about 90 degrees and the Skyliner temperature was fine with a decent breeze as long as you are moving. Not moving = very warm.

EPCOT - My brother got flagged for security with no idea what set it off. They were quick and pleasant. We stopped at Joffery's near the United Kingdom to get the Passholder Heart of Paris Cold Brew coffee and we split it (Yum!) on our way to the Land for lunch. Pro tip - Sunshine Seasons is a great place for an air conditioned lunch that usually has seating. The Hot Roast Beef with Fried Onions, Arugula, and Horseradish Cream Sauce on Sourdough Bread was hearty and delicious, despite some chewy pieces. 

Went to check if Geo-82 had a walk up and they did not, we kept checking the app, but never saw availability pop up. Rode Spaceship Earth since it had a short, shady wait and I hadn't ridden it in years. We thanked the Phoenicians.

Headed to Connections to get the Maleficent Passholder magnet. I can’t believe how giddy I was when I saw it in person. If it is wrong to plan a whole trip around a magnet, I don't want to be right. I also bought the blue EPCOT Passholder T-shirt with Figment on the back. It was $23, a pretty good deal!  I liked it because it didn't have the year on it. Note- I bought the medium since it was 100% cotton and I figured it would shrink, it did, but in a way that made the collar look sort of weird. I’ll still wear it though.

Killed some time getting Photopass pics. I bought it for the first time for a big family trip in November so I wanted to take advantage. We only went to photographers with no wait. 

Test Track (no spoilers) was cool and definitely an improvement from the last iteration, I especially love the new cars. There are some cute nods to previous versions. I would still do this as a single rider in the future unless I was with someone who had never been on it before.

Cosmic Rewind’s line had dropped to 80 minutes (75 appears to be the average). It is my favorite ride and the line quickly moved from outside to inside. I don't mind waiting in the AC on a hot day and it also gave me a chance to start this Trip Report. Got in line at 5:25pm and were in the Epcotian preshow room by 6:35pm. The preshow was broken with no video at all. The second room was working fine. People were rushing the doors and we hung back to hear about cake and toast. We got the first row without asking. (Song = I Ran).

Did the walk up bar for Space 220 with no wait. I definitely recommend the sliders and the deviled eggs. The shrimp tacos were meh. 

On our way out we walked past the Test Track line again and they were letting Passholders on without reservations. The wait was 45 minutes so we decided to pass and Skylinered over to Hollywood Studios. The first Fantasmic was cancelled due to weather so we had to swim upstream on our way to Tower of Terror (stick to the left). The line was 40 minutes, but quickly grew longer. We left to go back to the hotel when the second Fantasmic was still going so the Skyliner was empty.

Saturday, July 19 – Cosmic Rewind Failure = Hollywood Studios Breakfast

We secured the 7am VQ for Test Track with an estimated callback in 365 minutes. We were called back at 2:05pm. We decided to rope drop Cosmic Rewind, but it had a failure to launch. I had been checking Cosmic Rewind in the mornings before the trip and had noticed that there was a trend of failure to launch. We decided not to wait and pivoted to Hollywood Studios for breakfast Ronto Wraps from Ronto Roasters, which was something I had never done before. It is a hearty and delicious  breakfast. Pro tip - You can sit in the AC in the part of Docking Bay 7 that is just off the patio. Shh, it's a secret!

We rode Star Tours on the way to the new Villains show. After that, we split the Under the Sea Passholder iced coffee from the Joffery’s near ToT. They forgot the purple sprinkles, oh well. Keeping on theme, we went to the new Little Mermaid show. Both shows had great effects and acting and are nice AC breaks. 

Skylinered back to EPCOT and stopped off at Remy to do single rider. My brother and another single rider switched places so he could be in the same car with me and she could be in the same car with her single rider pal. Killed time waiting for the Test Track VQ by drinking ice water in Odyssey and then sampling sodas at Club Cool. Russian Cucumber Sprite is still my fave! Test Track preview line was longer than the day before, but it moved at a good pace. 

Thoughts/Observations:  

* I should not have broken my rule to not go in June, July or August…but the Maleficent Magnet had a strong pull. 
* It was nice to be in EPCOT at a non festival time, crowds were lower and there were no obvious drunken shenanigans.  
* The only “bad” guest behavior was in the Cosmic rewind pre-show rooms. There were the usual oblivious people stopped in a doorway or wherever blocking others, but no big deal. 
* Cast Members were fine, neither rude or especially compliment worthy, just doing their best in the hot/humid weather.
* My unrealistic magical wish: a fast, air-conditioned way to get from the front to the back of EPCOT. The Friendship boats are the closest thing, but they do not always run and can get very hot during the summer.

Chapter 1

Jul 4, 2025

POV Floris

Some asshole in a trench coat body-checked me at Schiphol without even a ""sorry,"" and honestly? Perfect fucking metaphor for how this whole Amsterdam adventure was shaping up.

""Sure, no worries,"" I muttered, wrestling my vindictive suitcase out of a tile crack while passengers flowed around me like I was human furniture. ""Love getting steamrolled by strangers. Really sets the mood for international career opportunities.""

The airport was chaos in corporate form—gleaming surfaces and people pretending their lives weren't falling apart.

Meanwhile, I stood there looking like a refugee from Silicon Valley's unemployment line: coat three seasons expired, boots that survived an actual flood, hair held together by spite and bobby pins.

Five feet of pure sarcasm wrapped in desperation, amber eyes that had seen too much tech industry bullshit, mouth that couldn't stay shut about it.

Yeah, that's me—Floris Middleton, MIT grad turned persona non grata, desperate enough to flee to a city where people bike in business suits like it's normal and everyone speaks better English than half of America.

Also, apparently, the only goddamn place left that would hire a blacklisted cybersecurity analyst with a history of making Very Important People very, very angry.

""Floris Middleton?"" I spun around and nearly face-planted into my luggage.

Corporate Clone Barbie stood there—black trench coat, zero expressions, clipboard weaponized. Name tag: Juno, Recruiter: Lynx Solutions.

""Uh, yeah. That's me.""

""You're late.""

""I'm literally not though."" Words popped out before I could filter them. ""My phone says 10:47, flight landed on time—""

""You're late,"" she repeated, like she could bend spacetime through administrative bitchiness. “Follow me.”

Great. Twenty seconds in Amsterdam and already failing at existence.

The town car was stupidly expensive—leather seats worth more than my whole education. I pressed against the window, watching Amsterdam blur past in expensive grays and browns and suspicious neon that looked like legalized vice advertising itself.

""About this job placement—"" I started.

""There's been a change,"" Juno interrupted, not looking up from her tablet. ""The original position was filled this morning.""

My stomach cratered. ""What? But the TechFlow data analyst role—we had a signed agreement—""

""One position remains. Brighton Systems. Executive assistant.""

I blinked hard. ""You're trying to make me a secretary for a surveillance mogul?""

""Executive assistant,"" she corrected with precision suggesting she'd had this conversation before. ""Excellent pay. Full benefits. Housing provided.""

""I have a master's degree in cybersecurity from MIT. I designed encryption protocols that the NSA still can't crack. I am not someone's coffee-fetching, calendar-managing assistant.""

Juno finally looked at me, expression warm as a tax audit. ""As I know, your brother's medical debt. $84,000. Experimental treatment he needs? $5,000 monthly. No insurance coverage.""

Ice water to the nervous system. I shut up.

""Brighton Systems offers comprehensive healthcare for employees' immediate family. Retroactive coverage, pre-existing conditions. No caps, no limitations.""

My resolve cracked like cheap drywall. ""What's the catch?""

""No catch. Sign a preliminary agreement, complete the interview process, your brother's treatment begins immediately.""

She handed me a tablet. Contract loaded, cursor blinking like a digital heartbeat.

""Don't Google him,"" she added, almost casual.

The second Juno left me in their psychotic minimalist lobby, I whipped out my phone and Googled the shit out of Eric Brighton.

Corporate espionage allegations. Whistleblower lawsuits. Ex-employees with NDAs thicker than textbooks. One charming headline: ""The Iceman Cometh: Why Eric Brighton's Employees Don't Last Six Months.""

My hands shook scrolling through digital horror stories.

This was career suicide. Exactly the toxic corporate nightmare I'd spent three years escaping after the whistleblowing debacle at Nexus Tech left me unemployable, blacklisted, and emotionally destroyed.

But Jake's face flashed through my mind. My little brother, fighting leukemia like his full-time job. Who'd put himself through community college while I lived my best academic life at MIT, never asking for help.

Never asked for anything, never complained, called me crying last month because insurance denied the bone marrow transplant that could literally save his life.

When Juno returned with a finalized contract, I signed without reading a word.

Because sometimes you don't choose between good and bad options. Sometimes you choose which version of hell you can survive.

Brighton Systems occupied twelve floors of architectural intimidation in Amsterdam's financial district. The building looked like liquid obsidian—black glass and sharp angles designed to make visitors feel disposable.

The receptionist had no eyebrows and wore latex like business casual. She didn't speak, just scanned my retina with something that looked surgical.

Beep. Access granted.

The executive floor was sensory deprivation meets evil lair. No furniture, no art, no human habitation signs. Just surveillance monitors showing real-time global feeds—London traffic, Tokyo subways, maybe a drug deal in São Paulo.

Standing before it all like a digital emperor: Eric Brighton.

No shoes. Charcoal suit worth more than my car. Dark hair perfectly disheveled like he'd run hands through it once.

He didn't turn when I entered.

""Miss Middleton. You're late.""

""Actually—"" He turned and with that I forgot how to form words.

Photos hadn't prepared me. Museum-quality bone structure, pale skin, sharp cheekbones, mouth that had never smiled. Steel-gray eyes like arctic water.

This man looked like he ordered deaths between meals.

""I'm not late,"" I managed.

""Then your phone is lying."" He moved closer—expensive cologne mixed with danger. ""What exactly did you think you were applying for?""

""Executive assistant. Administrative support, scheduling—""

""Wrong."" He circled me like a predator. ""You're here because you have specific skills I require. Because you've proven you'll sacrifice everything for what you believe is right. And because your brother is dying.""

My breath caught. ""How—?""

""I know everything, Floris. MIT summa cum laude. Phantom Protocol encryption at twenty-four. Exposed Nexus Tech's illegal surveillance of federal judges, got yourself blacklisted from every major tech company.""

He stopped in front of me. ""Now you're desperate enough to work for someone like me.""

""Someone like you?""

""Someone you Googled despite explicit instructions. Someone whose reputation terrifies you. Someone you believe is capable of terrible things."" His smile could cut glass. ""You're not wrong.""

He walked to his desk. ""Your real job isn't assistant work. It's a security analysis. Corporate espionage prevention. Finding holes in my system before enemies do.""

""And if I refuse?""

""Your brother's treatment stops. His debt gets sold to collection agencies run by creative people. You get deported, unemployable for life.""

The room shrank. ""You're blackmailing me.""

""I'm offering a choice. Work for me, protect my interests, your brother lives. Refuse, and you both learn what desperation feels like.""

""Why me? Hundreds of security analysts don't have my baggage.""

""Baggage creates loyalty. Desperate people work harder. You've proven you'll destroy your life to expose the truth."" He leaned against his desk. ""I respect that. I can use that.""

""What happens when you're done using me?""

""Depends how useful you prove.""

The monitors flickered. Hospital room. My heart stopped.

Jake. Asleep, connected to machines, but peaceful. For the first time in months he looked peaceful.

""He looks well,"" Eric observed. ""New treatment's working. White cell count improved dramatically.""

""You already started treating him?""

""Insurance authorized this morning. Funny how quickly things process when you know the right people."" Relief and rage tangled in my chest. ""Do we have understanding?""

I looked at Jake's face, then back at the man holding our lives. ""What's my first assignment?""

His smile was winter. ""Get on your knees.""

I froze. ""Excuse me?""

""Rule one: everyone starts at the bottom. Everyone learns humility first."" He gestured to the floor. ""Kneel.""

""I'm not— This isn't—""

""Your brother's next treatment is Friday. Would be unfortunate if there were authorization complications.""

My legs turned to water. This was insane, degrading, exactly the power-trip bullshit I'd sworn I'd never tolerate again. Every feminist instinct I had was screaming at me to walk out, to tell this psychopath exactly where he could shove his job offer.

But Jake's face was on that screen, peaceful for the first time in months. And sometimes survival means swallowing your pride along with everything else you thought you knew about yourself.

I sank to my knees on cold marble.

“Good girl,” Eric said softly. “Now we can begin. You will do whatever I say. Because I’m the only one keeping your brother alive.”

Some days I feel like I need resurrection after a 12-hour workday!

Look, I get it. We're all running around like headless chickens, and the idea of simmering bones for 24 hours sounds about as realistic as having time for a proper vacation. But here's the thing,  you don't need to be a kitchen wizard to get that liquid gold goodness.

My game-changing hacks:

Ice cube trays are your BFF – Make a big batch on Sunday, freeze in portions. Pop 2-3 cubes into your morning coffee (trust me on this one) or evening tea. Instant collagen boost without the fuss.

Pressure cooker magic – 2 hours gets you what used to take all day. Toss in chicken feet (yeah, I know, sounds gross but they're collagen bombs), some veggie scraps, and water. Set it and forget it.

Store-bought shortcuts – No shame in the convenience game,grab a ready-made bone broth from the grocery store, just make sure it's certified halal.

Your gut will thank you, your skin will glow, and you'll actually have energy for Netflix. Win-win-win!

1m77nvn,https://i.redd.it/s5cvulns8mef1.jpeg,Review: The Difference Foundation Kentucky Straight Bourbon,"The Difference Kentucky Straight Bourbon

Chapter 1: The Foundation

Accolades: Double Gold at 2025 San Francisco World Spirits Competition 

Exclusively for members of The Shareholders Society

Contract distilled by Bardstown Bourbon Co. for another client 

Mashbill: 73% corn, 19% rye, 8% malted barley 

 Age: 5 years 3 months 

Batch size: 7 barrels

Barrel manufacturer: Independent Stave Co.

Barrel char: 3

Barrel entry proof: 120

Full cask strength: around 124 proof

Bottling proof: 108.24 

Price: Membership in The Shareholder Society. I have no idea what the membership price is, but based on the website and the fact that it’s apparently access to allegedly very influential people, I’m sure it’s way more expensive than I would ever dream of paying. With membership, they send you bottles of The Difference.

Nose 👃: Coconut macaroon. Toasted almond. Sandalwood. Orange marmalade.

Palate 👅: Dark brown sugar. Dried apricot. Black walnut. Light coffee. Ridiculously thick mouthfeel.

Finish 🏁: Light coffee. Butterscotch. Dried apricot.

I didn’t want to like this, but I really do. I don’t like the fact that the brand’s website gives virtually no information about the actual whiskey, but when I asked… they happily provided all of the details. The website is almost exclusively about being a “business bourbon” and the connections you get with The Shareholders Society. I appreciate the fact that they openly gave me all of the details about the bourbon, but it definitely turned me off in advance that none of those details were publicly available.

The mouthfeel is absurdly oily… and I love it!  The mashbill is the same construct as Hard Truth’s BW1 and Old Glory.  Prior to Hard Truth releasing their own Indiana bourbon, they had Wilderness Trail distill BW1. Old Glory in Clarksville Tennessee also uses the same mash for their own bourbon. Bardstown Bourbon Co. also clearly did a fantastic job with it for The Difference. The Difference barrels were distilled for another client, but I don’t know who that other client is.

I really like this bourbon… considering the age statement, it’s pretty fantastic. With that said, I have zero interest in actually joining The Shareholders Society at a premium cost in order to get future expressions.

Bottle provided for review by the brand.

“Father, I’m ready now. Please arrange my marriage. I’m going to divorce my husband Xander. If you still want me as your daughter, if you still want me as your family, then pick me up. Erase my identity. Help me disappear. So I can be free.”

I hung up before I could hear the disappointment slide into his voice.

Three days ago, I watched my half-sister and my husband’s mistress push me off a yacht while Xander laughed as I nearly drowned.

What’s worse is that I heard him say, “Just go ahead and kill the baby. I never wanted an heir that comes from her. I’ve regretted marrying her since day one. If it weren’t for Nadia leaving me for her career, none of this would’ve happened. She seduced me, so I had a night with her. Our parents forced us to marry, but it doesn’t matter now.”

So I lost the baby that night. And he never once cared.

That was the last straw.

I filed for divorce, packed my bags, and decided to marry the man I once swore I’d never choose because it was better than believing his lies.

But that wasn’t the end. I decided to fake my death, just to make sure he’d spend the rest of his life regretting he ever lost me.

\--

“Father, I’m ready now. Please arrange my marriage. I’m going to divorce my husband Xander.”

My voice cracked, but I kept my tone steady as I gripped the phone like it was the only thing tethering me to what little was left of me.

“What do you mean?” he asked, his tone sharp, biting like ice through the line. “You’re agreeing now to the marriage you rejected so stubbornly before? And divorcing Xander?”

I shut my eyes, pushing down the burn in my throat. “I changed my mind. I’m going to leave him. If you still want me as your daughter, if you still want me as your family, then pick me up. Erase my identity. Help me disappear. So I can be free.”

I hung up before I could hear the disappointment slide into his voice.

My hands trembled so badly I nearly dropped the phone. The hospital room was too bright, too white, the scent of antiseptic too clean to match the rot in my chest. I stared at the IV line snaking into my arm and felt the memory rise up like bile.

Three days ago, I was standing on a yacht off the coast of San Amaro. It was my husband Xander’s birthday party.

Nadia was also there. My half-sister. My husband’s mistress.

She sidled up next to me near the railing, “Why are you even here, Lauren?” she’d asked, twirling her glass lazily. “You’re always so out of place. You should’ve just stayed at home.”

I ignored her, but the words dug under my skin like glass splinters.

The yacht rocked gently beneath us. The party roared behind us — laughter, music, clinking glasses. Nadia leaned closer, her eyes glittering with something too dark to name. “Do us all a favor, sister. Leave. He doesn’t need you.”

I turned to shove past her and felt her hand on my arm. A single, deliberate push. My scream vanished under the splash as I hit the freezing black water.

“Oh no!” I heard her giggle. “She fell!”

I came up struggling for air, salt burning my eyes. I flailed in the darkness, each stroke more desperate than the last. I could see them above me — Nadia, giggling behind her hand, and Xander, my husband, glass in hand, head thrown back in laughter.

They didn’t move. They didn’t help. They watched me struggle as if I was an inconvenience, a stain on their perfect evening.

If it weren’t for the old fisherman who found me clinging to driftwood, I’d be at the bottom of that sea. But maybe that would’ve been kinder.

In the hospital, I begged the doctors not to take my baby. But the impact had been too much, my body was too battered. When they wheeled me in, I heard a voice cut through my sobbing.

“Just go ahead and kill the baby,” Xander told the doctor. “I don’t really care. Let both of them die for all I care.”

The doctor hesitated. “Sir, are you sure about this? It’s your heir—”

Xander scoffed, that cruel laugh I used to mistake for warmth. “I never wanted an heir that comes from her. I’ve regretted marrying her since day one. If it weren’t for Nadia leaving me for her career, none of this would’ve happened. She seduced me so I had a night with her, our parents forced us to marry, but it doesn’t matter now.”

Nadia’s voice drifted in, sweet and false. “Are you sure, Xander? It’s your baby… what do you think she would feel?”

He barely looked at her. “It’s better this way. I was already planning to slip something in her drink to get rid of the baby and her. Now I don’t have to. You know, you’re the only one I want, Nadia.”

Nadia whimpered, a pathetic, guilty laugh. “I’m sorry… for leaving you. For everything.”

Xander’s tone turned gentle. “It’s okay. As long as you promise you’ll never leave me again.”

“I promise,” she breathed.

And the last thing I heard was the steady beep of the monitor, mocking me as the life I carried inside me was scraped away while they planned the rest of their perfect life without me.

I snapped out of the memory when the door swung open. Xander stood there, a plastic smile on his perfect lips, carrying flowers and a tray of food like he was the devoted husband the world still believed him to be.

“Baby,” he said, voice dripping sweet poison. “I’m sorry I couldn’t come sooner, you know how the company is, so much to do. But I’m here now.”

Liar. In my mind, I could see him in Nadia’s bed, her red nails raking his back while my body lay here, stitched and empty.

“I made you shrimp,” he said, placing the tray on my lap. “Your favorite.”

I stared at the plate. Nadia loved shrimp. I was allergic.

“I don’t want it.”

He stiffened, eyes flashing. “Don’t be dramatic. Isn’t it enough that our daughter died because of you? Shouldn’t you apologize to me?”

Before I could speak, his phone buzzed. He didn’t even hide the name. Nadia.

“I’m going to answer this. Eat. Don’t make this harder than it already is,” he hissed. “I’ll be back.”

I heard his voice through the crack in the door. “It’s me, baby. Oh, okay. I’m coming. Don’t cry.”

And he never came back to me.

I let him be. I was done.

I finally called my lawyer.

“It’s me. Lauren Valeria. I want to file for divorce.”

Chapter 2

The lawyer’s voice on the other end of the line was steady but hesitant. “Mrs. Valeria, I just need to ask again, are you absolutely sure you want to proceed with filing for divorce? You do remember the prenup you signed with Mr. Valeria. It says you can’t legally divorce unless… well… unless one of you is dead.”

I pressed the phone harder to my ear, staring at the cold hospital floor. “Don’t worry,” I whispered. “I’ll be dead in a few days anyway. So just… finalize it.”

Before he could argue, I hung up. The silence that followed buzzed like static in my ears.

I started pulling the tape off the IV in my arm when my phone lit up on the side table. Another message. I didn’t even have to look to know what it was — it always came at the same time, like clockwork.

When I finally opened it, there it was: a video. Nadia’s giggle. Xander’s low laugh. The shaky image of them tangled together in his hotel suite. Again. The fiftieth video she’d sent me — always labeled Oops, sorry, wrong send. Always just enough to remind me who I really was in their eyes.

I didn’t cry. I didn’t break the phone. I didn’t even bother to watch it all the way through. I just tossed it into my bag, finished taping gauze over the IV mark, and zipped up my small suitcase.

I was done.

As I waited for the nurse to finish the discharge papers, my mind drifted to the first time everything really started to fall apart — long before Xander, long before the yacht.

I was fifteen when my mother shattered my world. She’d been cheating on my father with Nadia’s father for years — I’d always heard the late-night calls, the slammed doors, the crying. When the divorce papers came, I thought I’d stay with Dad. But Mom forced me to come with her. “A daughter belongs with her mother,” she said.

That was the first time I felt truly unwanted.

At first, living with Nadia didn’t feel so bad. She was sweet — bright, giggly, the daughter everyone adored. We shared secrets, clothes, and whispered about our dreams at night. But it didn’t take long for the cracks to show. When she didn’t get her way, she’d cry to our parents. And somehow, the blame always landed on me.

When we were older, I saw her drape herself over Xander at family parties. They’d been closer than siblings, even though they weren’t by blood. She told me they were together. But then she left him for her acting dreams abroad. He was drunk the night I found him alone on the balcony, eyes red, whiskey in hand.

I was stupid. I thought comforting him meant I mattered. That night was a mistake for him — for me, it was the start of my ruin.

When the tabloids leaked photos of us, the scandal nearly destroyed both families. A quick wedding was the only fix. I convinced myself it was fate. And for two short years, it almost felt real. Until she came back. Until she stood in my kitchen, sipping my coffee, saying I’d seduced her man.

Xander defended me, or so I thought — until I found them in my bed. It never really ended. It only grew more blatant.

And now they didn’t even bother to hide it.

My mind snapped back to the hallway when I heard footsteps. Voices. Laughter.

“…are you sure you’re okay to be here?” Nadia asked, her voice a low, sweet drawl.

“Of course,” Xander replied, so casual. “It’s not like she died.”

My breath caught behind the corner. I pressed my back to the cold wall.

Nadia giggled. “But what if she finds out about our baby?”

“So what?” he scoffed. “It doesn’t matter. You’re the one I want to have my child, not her. We’ll surely get married soon. I promise you.”

The words stung worse than any wound on my body. They disappeared into his room, shutting the door. Three months pregnant, I heard Nadia say. Their baby. And yet they’d stolen mine from me like it was nothing.

When I got home, I opened the closet and started packing. Everything Xander had ever given me — the clothes, the jewelry, the perfume he said made me smell expensive. All of it went into a black trash bag. He didn’t deserve to see me draped in anything he’d bought to cover the truth.

I was shoving shoes into the bag when the front door slammed. I froze as my mother’s perfume hit me before she did.

She slapped me so hard my ear rang. “What on earth did you do with our money, Lauren?”

I stared at her, blinking back the stars in my vision. “What are you talking about?”

She shoved a folder of bank statements into my chest. “Gambling? All those debts under your name? We lost everything! Do you know how embarrassing this is for me?”

I shook my head, my voice a whisper. “No… I didn’t— I never—”

“It’s your name!” she screamed. “You filthy, useless—”

Nadia’s voice floated in behind her like a snake’s hiss. “Mom, what’s wrong?”

My mother whirled around. “Your sister’s a gambler! She ruined us!”

Nadia winced — wide-eyed, all innocent sweetness. “Mom, I wanted to tell you. I found out weeks ago but… I didn’t want Lauren to get mad at me for telling. I’m so sorry, Mom. I should have told you.”

My mouth dropped open. “That’s a lie! You used my name—”

The second slap split my lip. “Liar! After everything I did for you!” My mother grabbed a handful of my hair and yanked until I screamed.

Nadia just stood behind her, eyes wide and fake-sorry.

That night, my mother hit me until I couldn’t feel my arms, my ribs, my legs — fifty strikes that burned like acid on my skin. Xander didn’t stop her. Nadia didn’t flinch. They just watched. Smirking. Whispering. Mocking.

But as I lay on the floor, curled around my bruises, I promised myself one thing: Just a few more days. Just hold on a little longer.

And then I’d be gone.

Chapter 3

I woke up on the cold concrete floor of the storage room, my body curled awkwardly under a scratchy blanket that smelled of mold and stale oil. Every inch of me ached — ribs, hips, the side of my face still raw where my mother’s ring had cut into my cheek.

I shifted, trying to sit up, and bit back a scream when pain shot through my shoulder. That was when the door creaked open and Nadia stepped in.

“Oh, look who’s finally awake,” she cooed, voice dripping with fake sweetness. She turned to Xander standing just behind her. “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of her.”

Xander’s eyes flicked over me like I was a stain on his floor. “Just let her rot. She’s nothing to us now.”

Nadia turned back, her smile sharpening like a blade. She shut the door and knelt next to me, pulling a first aid kit from behind her back.

“Let’s get you cleaned up, hmm? Poor thing.”

She pressed a cloth to the cut on my lip — too hard, too long, like she enjoyed the way I flinched. I hissed in pain, but she only laughed.

“You know,” she said, pressing down even harder, “you’ll never be enough for this family. Got it? Never. Not when you’re nothing but a little seductress stealing what was mine.”

My voice cracked. “I never stole him. You left—”

She slapped a hand over my mouth, nails digging into my cheek. “Shut up. I went for my dreams. You think you’re special because you were the perfect replacement? Look where that got you.”

She pulled out a battered lunchbox, flipping it open so the stale smell hit my nose immediately. “Eat,” she said, voice too bright. “I made it myself. Don’t be ungrateful.”

She shoved a spoon toward my lips, and I realized it was shrimp. My throat closed up on instinct — I was allergic. I turned my head away, but Nadia’s grip on my jaw was iron.

“Eat it, Lauren! Don’t be dramatic now. Eat it!” she hissed, jabbing the spoon against my lips. My stomach turned, bile rising up so fast I nearly choked.

In that moment, something in my mind flickered — a memory from when we were kids. Nadia and I giggling under blankets, sharing secrets. Back when we were sisters in the truest sense — until I won that school contest, until they put my face on the cover of the community paper. She’d been so furious. She’d told everyone I cheated. One by one, my friends turned their backs. The teachers glared. The principal called me a liar.

And Nadia just stood there, pretty and innocent, saying, “I’m sorry. I tried to stop her. She loves attention too much.”

The taste of the shrimp snapped me back. I gagged, vomiting onto the floor. Nadia moved back, shrieking in disgust. “You freak! You did that on purpose—”

The door flew open. Xander stepped in, annoyance already etched into his features. “What the heck is going on now?”

Nadia turned to him, her eyes wide, voice trembling. “I was trying to help her, Xander! I made her food and she threw it up! She hates me—”

Xander’s face twisted with disgust as he looked at me, weak and trembling on the floor. “You ungrateful woman. She’s trying to feed you and you can’t even be thankful?”

They mocked me then. Both of them. Their voices mixed together — little jabs, half-laughs, like I wasn’t even there. But I didn’t hear it for long. The edges of my vision went fuzzy, my head spun, and the world finally went dark.

When I woke up again, I was in a hospital bed. The walls were clean. The sheets smelled like bleach. A nurse hovered over me, frowning as she checked the bruises blooming across my arms.

“You’re lucky,” she said quietly. “You went into shock from the allergy and the injuries. You need rest.”

I stared at the ceiling, tears pooling but never falling. “Do you need me to call your family?” the nurse asked gently.

Family. The word scraped against my ribs like broken glass. I turned my head away and whispered, “No. There is no family anymore. I’m all alone.”

The nurse squeezed my shoulder, pity in her eyes. She left me with my thoughts. The steady beep of the monitor filled the room. My phone vibrated in my pocket. For a moment I thought it was my father — maybe he’d finally come for me. But when I answered, the voice on the other end wasn’t his.

“Lauren.”

My breath caught. Noah. His voice was the same as always — smooth, sharp, a warmth I hadn’t felt in years. “I heard from your father,” he said. “So you’re finally divorcing him, huh?”

I swallowed, my throat raw. “Yes. I’m done with him. I… I want out. Noah… do you still want me?”

He laughed — low, easy, like he already knew my answer. “Of course I do. You’re mine, Lauren. You always have been. I’ll pick you up myself — give me a few days. I can’t wait to make you mine for real this time.”

I shut my eyes, a strange heat blooming in my chest. “Yes. I’ll be waiting for you.”

When the call ended, I let myself hope for a breath — just a small taste of freedom. But then a shadow fell over my bed. I looked up — and there he was.

Xander. His eyes narrowed, lips curled into that cold half-smirk.

“Who were you talking to?” he asked, his voice low. “Are you cheating on me now, Lauren?”

Before I could reach for my phone, his hand shot out and snatched it from my fingers.

Chapter 4

“Open it now,” Xander demanded, his hand gripping my phone like it was his property — like I was his property rather than wife.

I forced my voice to stay calm, even as my skin crawled. “The password is my birthday.”

He snorted, thumbs tapping the screen. “Easy. December 5.”

A bitter laugh slipped out before I could stop it. “That’s not my birthday. That’s Nadia’s.”

His fingers froze mid-tap. He looked up, confusion flashing across his face before it twisted into irritation. “So what? Why are you being dramatic again, Lauren? It’s not that important.”

Not that important. Three years of marriage, one lost child, and he didn’t even know the day I was born. But deep down, I knew — he could recite every detail about Nadia without missing a beat.

1m77lib,https://i.redd.it/jyd7kj3w7mef1.jpeg,His Regret Came Too Late Novel: Got the full version of the story. Say something in the comments and I’ll share.,"Chapter 1​​​

My daughter froze to death because my husband thought I kidnapped his bastards.

He tied her upside down to a utility pole. In the middle of a blizzard. And left her there all night.

By the time I reached her, her tiny lips were blue, her lashes covered in frost, and her arms hung limp like a broken doll.

I screamed her name—once, twice—but Kiara didn’t answer. My baby didn’t even flinch.

I fell to my knees, clutching her frozen body, barely breathing as I whispered, “Colsen, she’s your daughter too. How could you do this to her?”

“She’s my child,” he snarled, “just like Rafael and Brian. If you hate me, fine—but why punish innocent kids? Where did you hide them, Elsie?!”

My throat tightened. I didn’t know how to respond—because nothing I said would matter.

So he did worse.

He ordered someone to throw my already unconscious daughter into a frozen lake.

I dragged her out with trembling hands, screaming until my voice cracked. But Kiara never woke up.

At the hospital, the doctor shook his head. “There's nothing we can do. Her organs have shut down. It’s too late.”

She had just turned seven yesterday.

And now she was gone. Not because of illness. Not because of fate. But because I married a man who thought his mistresses’ children were worth more than our own.

I took her lifeless body to the funeral home that night, then wandered back to the house to fetch her favorite doll.

But the moment I opened the door, I heard laughter.

There they were—Colsen’s “missing” sons—playing happily in the living room.

And Colsen?

He was on the couch with her, arms wrapped around the woman who helped ruin everything.

My head started spinning at the sight. My mind went completely blank.

When Colsen noticed me, the grin on his face disappeared. ""Oh, you're back?"" he said flatly.

He gave me a cold glance and added, ""Looks like the punishment worked. You must've been scared enough to return Rafael and Brian in the middle of the night. Since they're both fine, and Astrid is kind-hearted, I'll let this whole thing go.""

I didn't respond. He narrowed his eyes and said with a chill in his voice, ""To keep the boys from going missing again, I'll be keeping them close from now on. Starting today, Astrid and her two sons will be living here too. You'd better drop whatever wicked ideas you've got and learn to get along.""

Get along? What a joke.

Kiara had just passed away, and he expected me to live under the same roof as his illegitimate twins, like nothing had happened.

I clenched my fists, but my throat was too dry to speak.

Seeing I was silent, he frowned and asked, ""Where's Kiara? What did you do with her? I shouldn't have tied her up like that, but you left me no choice. If you hadn't hidden my two sons, I wouldn't have gone that far. Kiara's always been a smart kid. I'm sure she'll understand.""

Understand?

But he had no idea that the sweet, gentle child who never gave him trouble was dead because of him. Killed by his own hands. Just thinking of Kiara made my chest feel like it was being torn apart.

I looked at those two boys laughing on the slide, and fury exploded inside me. If it weren't for them, my daughter would still be alive!

In a sudden rage, I lunged forward and grabbed both boys by the neck with all the strength I had.

""Elsie Flynn! What are you doing?!"" Colsen rushed over and yanked me back violently, throwing me to the floor.

""I thought you had changed, but you're still so cruel and full of hate! What did these boys ever do to deserve this from you?!""

Astrid quickly wrapped her arms around the crying children and burst into tears. ""Elsie, it's all my fault. If you're angry, be mad at me. Please, just don't hurt them anymore...""

""Colsen stared at me with a cold expression, his gaze sharp and cold.

""Elsie, Astrid has always been kind and never tried to take anything from you. Why can't you just accept her?""

My eyes burned with tears, and my heart felt like it was being torn apart. ""Colsen... do you even know... do you have any idea what you did to Kiara...""

Before I could finish, I suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood.

The sorrow overwhelmed me, and I collapsed unconscious.

Chapter 2​​​

When I opened my eyes again, I realized I was locked inside the room. I reached into my pocket to call for help, but my phone was gone.

Still in shock, I heard the door creak open slowly. Standing in the doorway, lit from behind, was Colsen.

He walked over and stopped near the bed, speaking in a calm but serious tone, ""Elsie, it's normal for rich men to have more than one woman. Can't you be more understanding? No matter how many women are out there, you'll always be my legal wife. Kiara will always be my eldest daughter. No one can take your place. Why can't you accept that?""

I looked at the man before me, crying silently. He felt like a stranger now, and it terrified me.

We had fallen in love back in college. We married after graduation and had been together for over ten years.

In the beginning, I gave him all my savings to help him get started. I stayed by his side as he grew from a broke student into a billionaire businessman.

But just a year after he became successful, he had an affair. Everything he had promised me became meaningless.

When I discovered he had another family, I lost control. I screamed, cried, and made a huge scene.

I refused to divorce him because I didn't want the money we built together to end up in the hands of his illegitimate children. So I clung to the marriage certificate, refused to sign the divorce papers, and did everything I could to keep control of the company's finances. I promised myself I'd protect Kiara's inheritance—no matter what.

But it was my refusal to let go that ended up causing Kiara's death.

Now I finally see things clearly. I'm done fighting and making a fuss.

In a raspy voice, I told him, ""Colsen, I won't argue anymore... I just want a divorce.""

""You're stubborn!"" he snapped, his eyes darkening as he slammed his hand on the table. ""You still don't understand the situation! Since that's the case, stay in this room until you reflect on yourself. Once you realize your mistake, I'll let you out!""

Then he turned and walked out, closing the door behind him with a loud bang.

""No!"" I screamed, rushing to the door and banging on it. ""Colsen, open the door! I can't stay locked in here!""

Kiara is still lying in the funeral home. I haven't even buried her yet. I can't be trapped here!

""Open the door, Colsen!"" I shouted.

But no matter how desperately I shouted, the only answer I got was the hollow echo of my own voice in the empty room.

Chapter 3​​​

It wasn't until later that night that the door finally opened again. Astrid came inside, holding a glass of water.

She stood in front of me with a mocking smirk, her voice dripping with provocation. ""Elsie, just look at yourself. You look completely drained. No spark, no youth, no life left in you. No wonder Colsen chose me instead!""

Her words didn't bother me anymore.

I truly didn't care who Colsen chose to love.

""Oh, right, did your daughter die?"" Astrid asked, sneering proudly. ""Honestly, I hid the twins on purpose to make you look like the bad one. And it was my idea to hang your daughter up in the freezing wind all night. I suggested it to Colsen. Who would've thought it'd work so well and kill that little brat in one go? She's just like you—weak and pathetic.

""Elsie, the Breslin family business will soon belong to my kids! And I'll be the next Mrs. Breslin!""

""Astrid!"" The second I heard her cruel words, I couldn't stay calm anymore.

Furious, I ran toward her, grabbed her hair, and screamed like a mad woman, ""You vile woman! My daughter didn't do anything to you. Why did you hurt her?""

""Ah!"" Astrid suddenly dropped to her knees with a loud thud and started begging with fake tears. ""Elsie, I'm sorry. I never should've gone after Colsen or destroyed your family. Please stop hitting me...""

Then, the door burst open with a loud bang.

Colsen stormed in, his face filled with rage. ""Elsie!""

He marched toward me and slapped me hard across the face. ""Astrid came in to bring you water out of kindness. Instead of being grateful, you hit her? How could you be so cruel?""

The blow knocked me over.

My forehead hit the edge of the table, and a sharp pain followed. Warm blood started dripping down my face.

But I didn't care about the injury. I stood up, pleading with him. ""Colsen, please let me go. Kiara froze to death because of you. Her body is still at the funeral home. She hasn't even been cremated. I can't let her leave this world without peace...""

""Stop lying!"" Colsen's expression turned harsh. He glared at me and said coldly, ""You're heartless enough to curse your own child? Kiara was always healthy. There's no way she froze to death! You're just trying to run away!""

But that night, the temperature was -20°C. Kiara was only seven. How could she survive that kind of torment?

""Colsen, I'm not making anything up. I can prove it with this death certificate..."" My hands were shaking as I pulled the document from inside my clothes.

Astrid gave a cold laugh. ""Elsie, where did you get that fake certificate from? My friend got one made for two dollars, but yours looks way more convincing.""

""You're terrible, Elsie!"" Colsen shouted, his face full of fury. He ripped the certificate from my hand and threw it at me.

""You really faked something like this just to trick me? I'm warning you, my patience is running out! Keep this up, and Astrid will replace you as my wife for sure! All the family's money will go to her twins!""

The sharp paper scraped across my face, cutting my skin and drawing blood.

A wave of despair washed over me.

Just then, a sudden clatter came from Kiara's room next door, followed by a strong scent of smoke.

My heart tightened in alarm. ""What's going on out there?""

Chapter 4​​

Astrid crossed her arms and spoke with tears in her voice, ""Elsie, Rafael, and Brian really like Kiara's room. Colsen said he'd clear out all of Kiara's stuff so they could move in. He also said she had too many useless toys, and the storage room couldn't fit them. So he told the nanny to burn everything.""

""What are you saying..."" I gasped, completely stunned.

I ran outside and shouted, ""Stop! Don't touch her things! Don't burn them!""

Colsen's face turned cold as he shouted, ""Enough! Elsie, don't you get it? Letting Kiara keep all this junk will destroy her future! This is your fault! You spoiled her. Myla, burn everything!""

""No, you can't do that..."" I rushed forward, trying to stop them, but Colsen yanked me back, holding me still.

Astrid pretended to comfort me. ""Elsie, please trust Colsen. He only wants what's best for the kids.""

In the end, all I could do was stand there, watching helplessly as Kiara's most beloved toys were swallowed by flames—reduced to ashes before my eyes. The fire roared, lighting up the room in a blaze of red, and all I could see was the burn in my eyes.

I collapsed to my knees beside the ashes, sobbing.

""I'm so sorry, Kiara. It's all my fault.

""I couldn't keep you safe, and I couldn't protect your things either.

""I'm a terrible mother.""

Then I was locked up again. No matter how many times I banged on the door or pleaded, Colsen wouldn't let me out.

I didn't eat or drink for three days. I just lay there, weak and crying for Kiara. The pain in my chest was endless, unbearable.

On the third day, it was the twins' third birthday. Colsen threw them a grand, extravagant party.

The sound of music and laughter downstairs made my pain feel even worse.

As I sat in silence, the door burst open with a loud bang. Astrid came in with the twins.

""Elsie, I brought you some cake,"" she said, proudly holding a plate of exquisite small cakes. ""Colsen made them himself! Can you believe it? A man who's never stepped foot in the kitchen actually baked for his kids. He dotes on the twins so much. Elsie, I bet you and your daughter never got to eat anything homemade by Colsen, right? What a shame, too bad your little girl never will...""

I was so furious that I jumped up and smacked the plate right out of her hands. The white cream splattered all over Astrid's clothes.

Her face turned red with rage as she raised her hand and slapped me across the face. ""Elsie, what are you even proud of? Do you still think you're the dignified Mrs. Breslin? Let me tell you, those days are over!""

Then, all of a sudden, she shoved her younger son, Brian Breslin, with force.

Brian lost his balance and toppled backward, hitting his head on the edge of the coffee table. Blood began to stream from the back of his head.

He wailed in pain, his cries echoing through the room.

Colsen rushed in, alarmed by the noise. ""Astrid, what's going on in here?""

Astrid looked terrified as she held the injured Brian close, crying. ""Colsen, Brian was just trying to be kind. He brought Elsie a piece of cake. She didn't want it, fine. But she actually pushed him! Brian hit his head and now he's bleeding... My poor boy, what did he ever do to deserve this?""

Her eldest son, Rafael Breslin, chimed in quickly, ""Daddy, that bad woman is so evil! She called Mommy a vile woman, threw her cake, and pushed Brian! She's so mean, you have to punish her for what she did!""

""Elsie!"" Colsen's eyes darkened with fury as he suddenly raised his hand and struck me across the face.

He grabbed me by the neck and shoved me hard against the edge of the window, his expression twisted with rage, eyes nearly blazing. ""Elsie, Astrid has always been gentle and always puts up with you. Why do you keep crossing the line? Looks like I've let you off too easily. That's why you act so full of yourself!

""Apologize to Astrid. Right now!""

My face burned, and it was getting hard to breathe. I felt like I was suffocating. But even then, I forced out a reply, ""I'll never... apologize!""

""You won't learn your lesson until it's too late, huh?"" Colsen growled, his voice low and threatening. His teeth were clenched as he glared at me. ""If you don't apologize to Astrid, I'll throw you out this window. Are you scared now?""

I laughed. Soft, bitter, unhinged.

After being married for a decade and sticking together through so many ups and downs, this is how it ends.

What a terrible ending.

""You don't have to do it."" I whispered, my lips trembling.

""I'll jump on my own.""",1,1753272818.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

I (25F) work in a small office with about 8 people. There's this woman Lisa (30s) who sits next to me and she complains about EVERYTHING. Her husband, her kids, her commute, the weather, the coffee, literally everything.

At first I tried to be supportive because everyone needs to vent sometimes. But it's been going on for months now and it's getting really hard to concentrate. She'll spend like 30 minutes telling me about her marital problems while I'm trying to finish reports.

I've tried subtle hints like putting in headphones or saying ""oh that sounds tough"" and turning back to my computer. She doesn't get it. Yesterday she interrupted me three times during a important phone call to complain about her mother-in-law.

Finally I snapped and said ""Lisa, I'm really sorry you're dealing with all this stuff, but I need to focus on work right now. The constant negativity is making it hard for me to concentrate.""

She got really quiet and hasn't talked to me since. Another coworker said I was harsh and that Lisa is going through a rough patch. But I feel like I was pretty nice about it considering how long this has been going on.

I don't want to be mean but I also can't be her therapist at work. Was I wrong to say something?

Because he wanted to please his first love.

In seconds, my shirt buttons popped off, my skirt was ripped, and my bra strap snapped...

I clutched the shredded fabric to her chest, struggling forward in the heavy rain.

When I realized it was time to walk away, I thought everything was over.

But the next day, I found that everyone was discussing my neked photo in the rain.

Right after Elie Roberts submitted her resignation, her mom called.

""Elie, how's the resignation going?""

""I've already turned it in. I'll officially be out in a month.""

""That's great,"" her mom said, sounding more cheerful. ""The friends in town and I picked out a few decent boys for you. Meet them when you're back, okay? Let's try to get you engaged this year.""

Then she sighed. ""And stop thinking about that heir from the Lawrence family. He's from a whole different world. We're not the same.""

Elie's throat tightened, eyes started to tear up. ""It's okay, Mom. I get it. I'll be back after I finish the handover.""

After hanging up, Elie started packing up her desk.

Years at the Lawrence Group had left her with way too much to sort through. She was only halfway done when her phone vibrated again.

It was a message from Clara Grayson: a location pin, followed by two words, ""Come over.""

The address was none other than Eric Lawrence's villa.

Twenty minutes later, Elie was standing at his front door.

The front door was ajar, so she pushed it open and walked in. Clara was standing in the middle of the living room, holding a bracelet.

Elie's heart sank. She was sure she'd cleared everything out when she moved out of this place. How did something get left behind?

Before she could react, Clara slapped her across the face.

""I've been trying to figure out who was with Eric while I was abroad, and I never would've guessed—it was you, my best friend!

""Elie, with that plain face and flat figure? You really think you could seduce Eric?""

Elie trembled, shame crashing over her like a wave.

""Clara, it was a mistake between him and me. And we're just friends with benefits... It only happened after you two broke up. I never crossed the line before that.""

Smack!

Clara slapped her again. ""Breakup or not, Eric will always be mine. Who do you think you are?""

This one hit harder—Elie felt blood at the corner of her mouth. When Clara raised her hand for a third slap, Elie finally caught her wrist.

""Elie, what do you think you're doing?!""

The icy voice came from behind just before she was yanked away with force.

She stumbled and fell to the marble floor, her knee slamming against it with a sharp pain that made her gasp.

Eric stood in front of Clara, shielding her. His black suit made him look even taller and more imposing, but the coldness in his eyes made her shiver.

Clara's tears fell right away. ""Eric, I found out about you and Elie. My best friend and my ex... I was just upset and asked her a few questions, and she tried to hit me.""

""I didn't! She—""

""Enough,"" Eric snapped, cutting Elie off. But when he turned to Clara, his expression softened instantly, even a little panicked. ""Clara, what happened with Elie was a mistake. I just missed you so much that I lost control. You came back, and I chose you. Doesn't that prove who I love?""

Elie's heart felt like it was being crushed in someone's fist.

So that was it. In his eyes, she wasn't even a replacement—just a way to vent his desire.

Clara looked up at him, eyes full of tears. ""Are you sure you don't love her?""

""I don't,"" Eric said flatly, without a moment of hesitation.

""Okay,"" Clara said, pointing at Elie. ""Then prove it. Tell your bodyguards to strip her.""

Elie's whole body went cold. She turned to Eric, but he just stood there in silence, frowning.

""I knew you couldn't let her go!"" Clara shouted. ""Fine then, I'm leaving. I hope you're happy together!""

The words had barely left her mouth when Eric grabbed her arm and gave an order to the guards by the door. ""Do it.""

The two guards stepped forward. Elie struggled desperately, but she was no match for their strength.

""No... please, don't...""

The sound of fabric tearing echoed harshly through the villa. In seconds, her shirt buttons popped off, her skirt was ripped, and her bra strap snapped...

Just as the last shred of clothing was torrn away, Eric finally spoke, ""Enough.

""Get her out of here. I don't want to see you again.""

Elie covered her body and stumbled out the door.

She heard Eric's gentle voice behind her. ""Clara, don't be mad...""

Rain poured hard, stinging against her exposed skin, but it still wasn't nearly as cold as what she felt inside.

She clutched the shredded fabric to her chest, struggling forward in the heavy rain. Rain mixed with tears, running into her mouth, bitter and salty.

And then, like a flood, the past came crashing down on her.

Back in college, Eric was every girl's dream—tall, handsome, and the star of the basketball court. Every game he played brought out a chorus of screaming fans.

Clara was the campus belle—beautiful, fair-skinned, and from a wealthy family.

Elie, on the other hand, was practically invisible. Ordinary looks, ordinary life—nothing that stood out.

Then one day during lunch, Clara suddenly sat down across from her with a tray and a dazzling smile.

""Eating alone is so boring. Let's eat together from now on.""

That was the day Elie became Clara's so-called best friend.

People always said Clara was so nice for hanging out with someone like Elie, the ugly duckling.

But Elie knew the truth. Clara only kept her around to make herself shine brighter.

Then one day, Eric entered their little circle.

At first, Elie thought he liked her. That evening, when a few thugs cornered her in an alley, it was Eric who stepped in to help. The way he stood there, backlit by the sunset, became the brightest memory of her youth.

But it didn't take long for her to realize that Eric only got close to her to pursue Clara.

Because the easiest way was through her best friend.

Even so, Elie helped him.

She could still remember all the times she praised Eric in front of Clara—how she always found excuses to slip away when they were together, and how her diary was filled with ""Eric,"" written again and again, though no one ever knew.

After that, she became like an NPC in their story, watching Eric win Clara over and treat her like a queen.

She thought she'd spend the rest of her life watching them go from dating to marriage, and then having kids.

But everything changed right before graduation, when Clara suddenly broke up with him and left for overseas without looking back.

Eric chased her to the airport and stood in the rain for a full day and night, but all he got was her walking away without a glance.

During that time, Elie stayed by his side.

When he drank too much, she picked up the empty bottles.

When he hit rock bottom, she quietly kept his life in order.

Eventually, she even became his secretary, managing both his work and personal life.

Then came that night at the business banquet. Eric had been drvgged. When she was reaching for her phone to call a doctor, he lost control and pushed her down on the lounge sofa.

Afterward, he didn't even look at her. Still, she couldn't forget the heat of his skin, the sound of his heavy breathing.

It happened a few more times after that, always after he got drunk.

He never kissed her, never looked her in the eye. Just coldly used her.

They'd been friends with benefits for three years.

But the moment Clara came back a month ago, Eric went right back to her without hesitation.

That was when Elie realized it was time to walk away.

So she quietly turned in her resignation and agreed to go back home for the blind dates her mom had set up.

What she didn't expect was that even after all that, Clara still wouldn't let her go.

Elie returned home, drenched from head to toe, when her phone lit up.

She checked it and saw a large bank transfer from Eric. The note was just a cold word, ""Compensation.""

Then another message popped up. ""I know you like me.""

She stared at the screen, her breath catching in her throat.

So he had known all along.

Every stolen glance, every planned ""coincidence,"" the little acts of ""accidental"" kindness—she thought she'd hidden it so well.

""But we were never possible.

""Clara was just too upset today.

""Don't take it personally.

""And don't you dare get jealous and hurt her.""

Each message hit like a knife to the heart.

Elie laughed out loud, laughing so hard that tears spilled from her eyes.

She thought back to all those years.

When he held her while drunk, calling out Clara's name, she held back tears.

When she slipped his birthday gift in with a pile of packages, too afraid to even sign her name.

When he kissed her in the office, he always covered her eyes.

So he'd known all along.

Her fingers hovered over the screen for a long time. Then, finally, she replied, ""Don't worry, Mr. Lawrence. I'll never like you again.""

\###Chapter 2

The moment she hit send, she sank into a bathtub filled with water.

Bubbles slowly rose to the surface, like the love she had buried all these years, finally sinking for good.

The next day, Elie continued to go to work.

But she was shocked to find a photo of her, soaked on her way home, had gone viral online.

""Flat as a board and still dares to run neked? I wouldn't even look if she walked past me! She's clearly desperate for fame. She's gone crazy trying to gain views!""

""Look at how miserable she looks—doesn't seem like she's trying to gain attention, more like a homewrecker who got beaten up! Serves her right. Shameless woman messing with someone else's relationship. Why couldn't she just get hit by a car?""

Reading the cruel, hateful comments, Elie felt awful, but there was nothing she could do.

Worried her mom might see the photos, she anxiously kept scrolling and spent the whole morning reporting them.

Online discussions only grew more intense until someone tried to dox the woman in the photo. But within minutes, the entire trending topic was wiped, and all photos and videos vanished without a trace.

Elie had no idea why, but it brought her a sense of relief.

She forced herself to act normal and got back to work. When she brought some documents to Eric for a signature, she walked in on Clara angrily confronting him.

""You're the one who took down the trending topic, aren't you? No one else has that kind of power! Why would you do that? Do you like her?""

Elie froze; she hadn't expected it to be Eric.

Eric looked at Clara with a frown, clearly frustrated.

""I did take it down, but it's not what you think. She's my assistant. If her identity were exposed, it could hurt the company's stock. I swear, I don't have any feelings for her. Clara, I only like you. Please, believe me.""

Clara was about to say more, but Eric suddenly pulled her into his arms and kissed her, cutting off her words.

She struggled at first, but his skilled and gentle kiss slowly made her give in, her breathing growing unsteady.

Elie stood outside the door, watching the scene, feeling cold all over.

So this was what it looked like when he kissed someone he loved.

His long fingers slipped into her hair, gently pulling her into his arms, eyes filled with undeniable possessiveness and affection.

In three years, he'd done everything intimate with her—except kiss her.

She should've known then. It was because he didn't love her.

A sharp pain struck her heart. Just as she turned to leave, a coffee cup suddenly came flying toward her.

She stumbled and fell hard to the floor, a gash opening on her forehead from the hit. As she raised her hand to cover the wound, Clara's angry voice rang out.

""How long have you been spying at the door? Do you enjoy watching people kissing?""

Elie lowered her head, her voice hoarse as she tried to explain she was just there to deliver documents.

But Clara walked over coldly, lifted her heel, and crushed Elie's hand, grinding down hard on the fingers still clutching the papers.

""Ah!""

The papers were crushed under the pressure, and Elie's hand was scraped, blood seeping through the torrn skin.

Her body trembled from the pain, but Clara clung to Eric's arm and started to complain.

""Eric, look—she's not just a liar; she's incompetent. She ruined the documents, too. Can't you just fire her?""

Eric's gaze darkened. He stayed silent for a moment before speaking quietly, ""She's handling several important contracts right now. I can't fire her for now.""

Clara looked at him suspiciously, her tone laced with dissatisfaction. ""Can't or don't want to?""

\###Chapter 3

Eric lowered his voice and coaxed her, ""I do have work to handle, and I can't afford delays. If it were just about firing a secretary, why would I lie to you?""

Clara still wouldn't let it go. ""Fine, don't fire her. Then make her stay on her knees at the company entrance for a whole day. Is that okay?""

This time, Eric agreed and looked over at Elie.

""These contracts are tied to a major deal. You either pay eight million, or stay on your knees at the entrance for a day.""

Elie knew he was doing this to appease Clara.

There was no way she could come up with eight million, so she staggered to her feet and, enduring the humiliation, stayed on her knees at the front door.

She hung her head low, hiding the burn in her eyes, while the chatter of passing coworkers reached her ears.

""Isn't she Mr. Lawrence's most trusted secretary? Why's she on her knees out here in front of everyone? So embarrassing.""

""I saw it too. She didn't do anything wrong. She just pissed off Ms. Grayson and got punished for it.""

""Ms. Grayson is Mr. Lawrence's first love. Even after all these years apart, he still isn't over her. Messing with Ms. Grayson? Yeah, she had it coming.""

Each word stabbed into Elie like a needle, making it hard to breathe.

She suddenly thought back to school. On Clara's birthday, some boys had made fun of her, saying she was the cow dung that highlighted the campus belle.

Everyone burst into laughter. She'd bolted, hiding in the stairwell.

It was Eric who found her there, handing her a pack of tissues.

""Don't worry about others. Just focus on yourself, that's enough.""

Even now, Elie still remembered those words.

She always thought Eric saw something special in her, and that's why he kept her close. She gave everything to her work, never complained, and always did her best.

But the moment Clara came back, he threw all her years of hard work and loyalty aside, just for Clara.

Yeah... In the end, she was just a secretary he could fire at will.

Now that she was no longer useful, it was time to leave.

Elie stayed on her knees all day. Her skin was torrn and bleeding, and the pain made it nearly impossible to walk.

When work ended, she limped back to the office to grab her bag and ran into Eric.

He glanced at her injuries and frowned slightly.

""Take a few days off. Get some rest. Come back when you're better.""

Elie murmured, ""Okay,"" without looking at him, then turned and walked away.

Once she got home, she treated her wounds and started packing her things.

The moment Clara's return made the news, Eric had told her to move out of the villa.

Back then, she'd left in a hurry, just tossed everything into a box, making a mess.

Now that she was going back to her hometown, she figured it was time to clean things up properly.

She got rid of the jewelry Eric gave her, the photos she'd secretly taken while he was asleep, the diary where she wrote about her crush on him at the university, and all the other little things.

Every now and then, gossip from the office group chat would pop up.

When Clara came back from shopping with sore legs, Eric got down to his knees and gave her a massage. When she complained the office lights were too bright, he had the entire building's lighting replaced overnight. When she was in a bad mood, he canceled all his meetings just to accompany her.

Elie kept scrolling quietly, repeating to herself, ""It'll be over soon. Just hang in there.""

Once her injuries healed, it was time for the company's annual party.

Eric showed up with Clara, and the whole room burst into applause. Everyone was saying how perfect they were for each other—rich, good-looking, a match made in heaven.

He helped Clara down the stage, fixed her dress, took off his jacket to put around her shoulders, and turned down the drinks others tried to toast her with.

Elie sat quietly in a corner, watching the way Eric smiled at Clara. She lowered her eyes silently.

Then came the award ceremony.

Just like every year, Elie won Employee of the Year.

With all eyes on her, Elie stepped onto the stage. The screen behind her started playing a slideshow of her accomplishments over the past year.

She adjusted the mic, ready to give her speech, but suddenly, there was a commotion in the audience.

People were whispering and looking at her with odd expressions.

\###Chapter 4

Elie's eyelid twitched. Something was wrong. She turned around and saw her PPT had been swapped.

The screen was now showing humiliating photos from college, ones that had been secretly taken without her knowing.

Mixed in were censored bed photos, in which her face was clearly visible.

Elie knew right away that those photos came from Eric's villa security footage.

Her whole body went cold, and her mind went blank. She glanced instinctively toward Eric.

He was frowning, but Clara beside him wore a smug, taunting grin.

Elie immediately knew it was her doing. Anger rushed up, and she stepped forward, ready to ask what it would take for Clara to finally leave her alone.

Eric's expression darkened as he stepped in front of her, his voice icy cold.

""What are you doing? Not feeling humiliated enough? Remember, you're just a secretary!""

With tears in her eyes, Elie looked at him. ""Mr. Lawrence, yes, I'm just a secretary, but I'm still a person. Don't I deserve respect? She deliberately showed those photos—

""Enough! Stop acting crazy here!"" Eric snapped, his face dark.

He called the security guards over and had her kicked out.

In front of everyone, they grabbed her by the hair and dragged her out, humiliated her, then shoved her down the high stairs.

She tumbled down, bruised all over, blood seeping out and staining the floor red.

A sharp, tearing pain shot through her whole body, hitting every nerve.

Tears she'd been holding back finally spilled over, clouding her eyes.

She curled up, hugging herself tightly, and slowly blacked out.

When she opened her eyes again, she was in a hospital.

She stared blankly at the ceiling for a long time, then picked up her phone. The office group chat was flooded with talk about the annual party.

Someone had even shared videos and photos, mocking her without holding back.

""Elie's not even that pretty, but turns out she's so wild in private? I thought she was frigid with that cold expression, but she's just a shameless flirt. No idea which guy she's messing around with, but taking that many photos? She must be thirsty.""

""Frigid? She's been all over Mr. Lawrence at work, basically throwing herself at him. Lucky for him, he's only into Ms. Grayson and has never fallen for someone that low.""

""A gold-digger using her body to climb the ranks, like she could ever compare to Ms. Grayson. It's a total insult. Honestly, she should just save herself the embarrassment and leave. If she stays, she's just making a fool of herself.""

Each word felt like a dull knife slicing into Elie's heart, causing unbearable pain.

Her palm was torrn up from clenching so hard, and she bit down until her teeth ached. She was finally barely holding it together.

She had no idea how much time had passed before the ward door opened.

When she looked up, a male coworker from the planning team walked in, holding a cup of water.

""Elie, you're awake! How do you feel? Want me to get the doctor?""

Elie was a little dazed, then shook her head.

""I'm okay. Was it you who brought me here?""

Marcus Schmidt scratched his head awkwardly, giving her a shy smile.

""Yeah, I saw you passed out by the door and got worried, so I brought you to the hospital. Luckily, the doctor said it was just stress.""

The word ""passed out"" brought back memories of the company party, and Elie's face froze.

Marcus realized he'd said the wrong thing and quickly went quiet.

The room stayed silent for a long time before he finally spoke up carefully. ""Elie, don't let those rumors get to you. They're not mad because you did anything wrong, but because they have a prejudice against you. Someone's definitely trying to hurt you by photoshopping those pictures. You can call the police, or if you don't want to deal with that pressure, I can help you. You can just say you're in a normal relationship...""

When she saw his ears turning bright red, Elie recalled how he'd always find random excuses to talk to her, and how he'd bring her coffee or snacks every now and then.

Only then did she realize that Marcus probably had a thing for her.

But she'd only ever seen him as a colleague, and she'd already made up her mind to leave.

So when he hinted at his feelings, Elie forced a small smile and politely turned him down.

""Thanks for your concern, but I can handle this on my own.""

Marcus looked a little crushed, but he wasn't backing down.

He reached under the bed, pulled out a bunch of roses, and nervously handed them to her.

He stammered, ""I-I've liked you for a while now. I just never had the guts to say it. I know the timing's not great, but I wanted to try. Could you give me a chance? Maybe we could try being together—""

Marcus didn't even get to finish his words before the door was kicked open.

Startled, they both turned toward the noise—Eric stood there, furious, with a sullen face.

He glared at Marcus as he spat out, ""Get out!""

\###Chapter 5

Intimidated by Eric's overpowering presence, Marcus shot to his feet and rushed out of the ward, bowing as he left.

Eric slammed the door behind him, then turned to the flowers beside Elie.

""So, he's into you and told you how he feels?""

Elie met his gaze but stayed quiet.

Without waiting for an answer, Eric grabbed the roses and tossed them out the window.

Elie had rejected Marcus, but she didn't want his feelings to be treated like trash.

She pulled out her IV to pick up the flowers, but Eric caught her wrist and pushed her back onto the bed.

He stared her down, eyes cold as ice.

""What are you doing? It's just a crappy bouquet. Don't tell me you like him too?""

Elie pushed him away and said coldly, ""Mr. Lawrence, you're just my boss. Who I'm with is none of your business.""

Eric's expression darkened, and he gripped her wrist so hard it left red marks.

""Yeah, but don't forget company policy says no office relationships. If you even think about saying yes to him, he's out of the Lawrence Group tomorrow.""

Elie knew he always meant what he said, and she didn't want to drag anyone else into this, so she told the truth. ""I don't like him, and I'm not planning to be with him.""

Only then did Eric's expression ease a little. He let go of her hand and finally got to the real reason he came.

""It was indeed Clara who changed the photo at the annual party. But now that she knows the truth, it's understandable she's mad at you. Once things settle down, I'll promote you to head of the secretary department, and your salary will double. Just focus on your work. Clara agreed this was the last time. She won't come after you again, so don't hold it against her anymore.""

His offer sounded great, but Elie wasn't moved.

She took a deep breath, about to tell him she was resigning.

But before she could speak, Clara's call came in.

""Eric, I want to go to the beach for a few days. Will you come with me?""

Eric spoke to her gently, leaving Elie behind without a second thought as he walked out.

He left in such a rush that he didn't hear what she said.

""I don't need a promotion because I already turned in my resignation.""

As the door closed behind him, Elie looked down.

""Forget it. He'll find out sooner or later,"" she thought to herself.

In the days that followed, while Eric stayed with Clara, Elie went back to work like nothing had happened.

Marcus was transferred back to his hometown branch the very next day. Elie didn't even get to see him one last time.

People at the office still gave her weird looks, but no one brought up the annual party anymore.

Things had finally calmed down. Elie went to the HR department to ask if she could leave early.

The HR staff looked troubled. ""Ms. Roberts, if you want to resign early, you'll need Mr. Lawrence's special approval.""

Elie nodded and got to work on her early resignation request.

Right as she was about to find Eric for a signature, he called and sent her an address, telling her to come immediately.

When she got to the private room at the club, Elie realized Eric's friends—and Clara—were all there, laughing and playing games.

As soon as he saw her, Eric looked up and nodded toward the drinks on the table.

""Clara lost a few rounds, but she's on her period and can't drink. You drink for her. 1.5 thousand dollars per glass.""

Elie knew Eric had damaged his stomach from drinking too much in the past. Now he couldn't touch any alccohol at all.

Otherwise, he would drink for Clara himself.

Elie looked at the dozen or so glasses of whiskey on the table.

She said quietly, ""Mr. Lawrence, it's after work hours. I have the right to refuse this assignment. But if you insist I drink for her, I don't want the money; I just want your signature.""

Eric frowned slightly. ""Signature? For what?""

Elie handed him the resignation form. He was just about to open it when Clara tugged on his arm, pouting.

""Eric, I lost again. Hurry up and make her drink for me!""

Eric responded gently to her and didn't bother reading the form.

He signed it without hesitation and tossed the pen back.

""All done. Now drink.""

\###Chapter 6

Elie slipped the agreement into her bag and downed her drink.

She kept going, glass after glass, until her stomach was in knots and she felt like throwing up.

After forcing down the last one, she got up, swaying, heading for the bathroom, but Eric's friends blocked her path.

""Eric, Clara lost again! She picked dare, and the card she got said she had to kiss a random single person here for three minutes!""

Hearing this, Eric didn't even hesitate. He just grabbed Clara and kissed her.

They were immersed in it, and the whole room erupted with cheers and shouts.

Elie sat there, groggy and dazed, watching them kiss like they were in their own little world. A bitter ache spread through her chest.

When the kiss finally ended, Eric still looked like he wanted more, while Clara blushed. But Eric's friends started teasing again.

""That kiss doesn't count! The card said she had to kiss a single guy. You're her boyfriend. Totally doesn't count.""

Eric's smile faded.

""Clara's mine. You really think I'd let her kiss someone else?""

Everyone could tell he was pissed, so they quickly tried to smooth things over and pulled Elie.

""Of course, we wouldn't touch Clara. But hey, there's always a backup option, right? Ms. Roberts can take the dare instead.""

Elie's face went pale in an instant.

She instinctively looked at Eric and saw him refuse with a stiff expression.

""She only agreed to drink. Kissing wasn't part of the deal.""

The guys exchanged glances, then started laughing.

""Come on, that's nothing a little money won't fix. Ms. Roberts always listens to you, doesn't she? Remember when we were racing, and the rule was that if your companion wouldn't get in the car, you'd lose a yacht? You didn't even say anything, just gave her a look, and she got in. If she was willing to risk her life for you, a kiss should be no big deal.""

Clara's eyes welled up with tears as she yanked her hand out of Eric's.

""Didn't you say you didn't have feelings for her? Then why did you take her racing with you? If you like her that much, go make her your girlfriend. I'll find someone else to kiss and finish the dare!""

Then, she stormed off.

Eric panicked. He took out a bank card and threw it at Elie before rushing after Clara.

""There's 150,000 dollars on that card. Kiss in Clara's place for three minutes.""

Watching him walk away, Elie felt like her heart was broken.

She didn't want to agree to this deal. She turned to leave, but Eric's buddies pushed her back down.

They brought over a stray dog, forced its jaw open, and pulled out its tongue. Then, they shoved her toward it with sneering voices full of spite.

""Clara told us everything. You're quite wild. Your bed photos are all over the office, aren't they? A slvt like you trying to seduce Eric? Disgusting!""

""No one would want to kiss you. Touch your saliva and we'll probably end up in the hospital. A dog's the only thing you're good for. You know what they say—sluts and dogs are a perfect match.""

Elie was so humiliated that tears streamed down her face as a wave of nausea hit her.

She threw up uncontrollably, bile mixed with blood splattered across the floor.

By the end of it, she was completely drained, her eyes blank and lifeless.

As they walked away, laughing out loud, only one thought remained in her mind—she was done with Eric. She would never come back.

\###Chapter 7

Elie submitted her early resignation form to HR and watched them stamp it.

""Since Mr. Lawrence approved it, Ms. Roberts, you should hand over all your work, and you can leave in three days.""

After days of feeling down, Elie's mood finally started to lift.

She headed back to her desk to finish up her remaining work.

After two days of sorting everything and handing it off to her coworkers, she packed up her things into a box.

Just as she finished, Eric walked in.

He glanced at her empty desk and was a bit caught off guard.

""Why are you packing up?""

Elie was about to answer, but he seemed to remember something and nodded.

""Yeah. Now that you've been promoted, you'll have your own office. You can pack up later. Come with me first.""

Without waiting for her response, he turned and left.

Elie hesitated for a second, then quietly followed him to the auction venue.

Clara was already there. When she saw Elie, a hint of disdain crossed her face as she stepped up and grabbed Eric's arm.

""Eric, I've already picked out the jewelry I want. No matter what, you have to buy all of it for me.""

Eric smiled dotingly and helped her sit down.

""Don't worry. Whatever you want, I'll get it.""

Elie stood quietly in the corner, watching them laugh and flirt, but she felt nothing.

Once the auction started, Eric would buy everything Clara had her eye on.

His over-the-top bids had the whole room stunned, with people turning to stare.

""Bidding on everything she wants? Mr. Lawrence is spoiling his girlfriend. She gets whatever she wants, like a personal wishing well. Ms. Grayson must've been a hero in a past life or something.""

""I heard that ever since they started dating, Ms. Grayson's gotten whatever she wanted. Guess nothing's changed after all these years. Mr. Lawrence is infatuated.""

Clara beamed at all the jealous praise.

She casually tossed the auction catalog at Elie, then turned to Eric and started acting cute.

""I wanna use the restroom. Eric, come with me?""

Eric got up without hesitation, leaving Elie with a quick instruction.

""Bid on everything that's marked in the catalog.""

Elie said nothing, just nodded, and made sure to bid on every single item as told.

Just as Elie was about to leave, the auctioneer suddenly introduced a brand-new item.

""Ladies and gentlemen, we're now moving on to the surprise lot of the evening—a pinkish-purple necklace featuring a 40.52-carat Alexandrite. The starting price is 1.5 million.""

The surprise item caught everyone off guard, and the sparkling necklace immediately stole the spotlight.

Bids quickly erupted throughout the room, driving the necklace's price sky-high.

Elie took a photo and sent it to Eric, asking if he wanted to bid on it.

But Eric didn't reply. She tried calling a few times, but he didn't pick up.

While she was still trying to reach him, the necklace was sold for 80 million.

The moment the final bid was called, Clara happened to come back.

Clara spotted the necklace and instantly wanted it. When she realized it had been sold, she picked up a glass of red wine and poured it on Elie's face.

""I told you to bid on everything I liked! What the hel were you doing?""

Elie's hair and clothes were soaked. She clenched her hands tightly, trying hard to keep her voice calm.

""This necklace wasn't in the catalog. It was a surprise item. I called Mr. Lawrence, but he didn't answer...""

But Clara didn't care about her explanation. She turned to Eric with a pitiful look.

""Eric, not only is Elie useless, but now she also shirks responsibility! I don't care. I want that necklace. If you don't get it for me, I will ignore you.""

Eric had seen Elie's message and knew it wasn't her fault.

But in front of Clara, he couldn't defend Elie. He could only go along and try to soothe Clara.

""Have I ever said no to something you wanted? Be good, I'll have someone buy it back right now.""

He called over a staff member, his tone stern. ""Find the buyer and negotiate. If they're willing to give it up, meet any condition they ask.""

Elie stood silently, her wet shirt stuck to her body, and wine still dripping from her hair.

Seeing the smug look on Clara's face, she suddenly had a bad feeling.

The staff member came back quickly, looking a bit uneasy. ""Mr. Lawrence, the buyer agreed to hand over the necklace, but...""

""Go on,"" Eric said, frowning.

""He has one condition..."" the staff member said hesitantly. ""He wants your secretary to spend the night with him. He said...""

He braced himself and continued, ""He said she may look plain, but after having nothing but gourmet meals, sometimes it's nice to try something simple.""

\###Chapter 8

Elie was struck as if by lightning, and she looked up suddenly at Clara.

The smug smile at the corner of the other's mouth confirmed her guess, which she couldn't hide in time.

What hidden items, what mysterious buyers, all are carefully designed traps.

""Mr. Lawrence, Elie's voice trembled, ""you can't agree, I'm leaving after today...""

""Eric,"" Clara suddenly threw herself into Eric's arms, interrupting him, ""I want that necklace! You promised me.""

She looked up, tears welling in her eyes, ""Am I not as important to you as a secretary in your heart?""

Eric looked down at Clara in his arms, then glanced at the pale-faced Elie.

He wiped away Clara's tears with his hand and whispered, ""Don't cry.""

Then he turned to the staff and said, ""Tell the buyer, deal done.""

Elie's blood froze in an instant: ""Eric! You can't-""

Before the words had even finished, someone had already grabbed her arm.

She struggled desperately, her nails scratching blood marks on the bodyguard's arm: ""Let me go! Eric! I'm quitting tomorrow! You have no right...""

Her voice was cut off by the slamming of the car door.

The black sedan sped away, and in the rearview mirror, Eric was gently putting a coat on Clara.

In the luxury suite, Elie was pushed in roughly.

With a click, the door locked behind her, and she turned around to see a beggar covered in dirt greedily staring at her.

The beggar grinned, revealing his uneven yellow teeth.

Elie trembled all over, staggering backwards. ""Don't come any closer... I can give you money...""

""Money? The beggar grabbed her wrist, his foul breath hitting her face as he chuckled. ""The money that lady gave me is enough to last me a lifetime! I don't need money now, I need a woman!""

Elie was desperate and could only grab the desk lamp for self-defense. When the beggar pounced on her, she fiercely smashed his head.

Blood flowed down his forehead, instead arousing his ferocity.

""Jerrk! he grabbed her hair and threw her onto the bed.""

The sound of fabric tearing was particularly harsh in the room.

Elie's nails left deep blood marks on the beggar's face, but they were no match for the man's strength.

Just when she was completely desperate—

""Bang!""

The door was kicked open.

Eric's bodyguard rushed in and quickly subdued the beggar.

""Ms. Roberts, the bodyguard holding out a coat began, ""Mr. Lawrence sent us to rescue you.""

Elie shivered as she wrapped her coat tightly around her, reaching for her phone to call the police.

The bodyguard quickly snetched the phone: ""Mr. Lawrence instructed that you cannot call the police.""

""What does it mean? Elie asked hoarsely.""

""Ms. Grayson didn't mean it, she just wanted to vent. Mr. Lawrence has already arranged for someone to save you, you're fine, let's just forget about it.""

Elie was struck as if by lightning: ""He... knew?""

The bodyguard resigned.

Elie suddenly laughed, laughing so hard that tears streamed down his face.

Originally, Eric knew everything, but still allowed Clara to push her towards the abyss.

Her eyes welled up with tears, ""What if I had to call the police?""

""No one in New York dares to take your case, the bodyguard said expressionlessly. ""Mr. Lawrence said to give you a week off, so you can rest well these days, consider it as compensation.""

After speaking, the bodyguard's figure disappeared at the end of the corridor, and the door made a soft ""click"" sound.

Elie sat down slowly on the ground, pressing his fingertips deeply into the palm of his hand.

The suit jacket slipped off her shoulders, revealing a torrn collar. She reached out to pick it up, only to find her hand shaking uncontrollably.

The phone suddenly rang, and the word ""Mom"" on the screen stabbed her eyes.

""Elie, have you finished the handover? Have you arranged all the blind dates?""

Elie bit down hard on his lower lip, the taste of rust spreading in his mouth, but it was nothing compared to the pain in his heart.

""Okay, Mom, she heard her own terrifyingly calm voice, ""I'll go back today.""

The moment the phone hung up, tears finally burst out.

Ten years of time passed by like a revolving lantern in front of my eyes.

On the college campus, the figure of a young man walking against the light.

In the president's office, his breath was scorching hot after he got drunk.

And tonight, he uttered the indifferent words ""deal"" as well.

Every frame of memory turned into a sharp knife, tearing her heart apart.

Ten years of infatuation, resulted in one trampling after another.

Elie slowly stood up, picked up the coat on the ground, straightened out his disheveled clothes, and returned to the apartment alone.

Her emotions had completely calmed down. Within just thirty minutes, she calmly cancelled the apartment rental, packed all her belongings, left the keys behind, and took a taxi with her suitcase.

The taxi drove through the puddles and headed towards the airport.

1m77itz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m77itz/aitah_for_talking_to_my_best_friends_mutual/,AITAH for talking to my best friends mutual friends brother.,"Im 20 female and I recently started talking to my best friends mutual friend’s brother. He’s 18, the sister I’ve met only a couple of times at an event or whenever she comes into my work to buy something. 

I met her brother at his work, he works at this dessert place, where me, my best friend(17) and her boyfriend(20) decided to go there for dessert. I didn’t really acknowledge him, I didn’t even say hi. After a few minutes I left didn’t hang round for the dessert. 

Days go by my best friends bf told me he found me attractive and wanted to start talking to me. Both my best friend and her boyfriend kinda said if he does hit you up give him a chance. Which I told her boyfriend to tell him I don’t go for guys my age or younger. My type is usually older guys. I also genuinely think he wouldn’t hit me up. Because weeks went by as well. 

But he did one night, I replied we started talking. The same day I told my best friend I wouldn’t mention anything about a relationship because I wasn’t fully prepared. I didn’t want to know what he wanted out this. But after that call ended he called and asked me. I was surprised and truthfully told him I don’t want things serious rn and rather be slow with things. He said the same thing. Because he kinda got stuck in some things with his family and some ppl from his school. 

Where he got fully vulnerable about it which I didn’t expect from him. I stuck with him and gave him all the advice I had to give and guide him through it all. In the mix of it he went through a lot and I suddenly realised recently I’ve fallen for him. Whenever I get mad or upset about he instantly wants to reassure me and talk it out. He communicates really well which I find really attractive. I also I haven’t done anything but kiss the guy. Which we both agreed on not to do anything until i felt comfortable with it. 

This is where the problem comes in, 3 months later I was at work and he was with his sister, she was getting her nails done but I was on break so went for some coffee mids if she came and asked me about what was going with us to, he wasn’t around and I kinda didn’t want to lie so I told her we’re talking but taking things slow, where apparently after I left she told him it was weird because I’m also older than her and she doesn’t like it. He didn’t say anything and just left it. 

My best friend is having a birthday in August, it’s a huge birthday party where she said she’s inviting his sister. She was gonna invite him as well but looking at what she had said about our relationship she decided to leave the decision up to me. Saying I’m giving you a plus one instead you can choose to bring him if you want, but just now i was just talking to him about it he goes she’s still a bit mad about us talking. 

I was telling my best friend, she straight away shut it down and said it’s weird and it’s not ok. Also adding I shouldn’t even bring him as a plus one. I just went quiet. Because in a way I have never been weirded out from age gaps only because my mum and my dad have a huge difference. But I genuinely like him and now I feel like I’m being judged for not being smart and continuing on talking to him.

I matched with this guy whose profile screamed 'casual vibes'—beach photos, chill captions, a whole zen master aura. Figured, sure, let's see how this goes, I'm always down for some laid-back, no-pressure dates. 

Fast forward to our coffee date... and boy, we were on different galaxies when it came to 'casual.' When I showed up in my comfy jeans and loose tee, he was suited up like he just stepped off the set of Suits. I'm not gonna lie, my first thought was, is this guy applying for a job or something? He was polite and all, but the more he talked about his 5-year life plan and whole intensity around every topic, the more I felt like I walked into a TED Talk rather than a date. 

He even brought a checklist of questions! 🤯 I mean, planning is great, but it was like an undercover interrogation. By the end, I was half expecting to sign a contract for our next ""casual"" meeting! 😅

1m77hbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1m77hbm/not_allowed_to_profit_from_the_sale_of_my_business/,'Not allowed to profit from the sale of my business',"I don't know if I'm asking for advice or just want to rant, but either way here goes:

Yesterday I met with commercial landlord (Mr X) and his assistant (Ms Y) about an offer I'de received to sell my business. Background, for the last several years I've owned and operated a small coffee shop in the city. I bought the business off an old boss as a pop-up just before the pandemic and worked nearly three months straight (doing takeways) during lockdown. I never asked or received any rental relief during the pandemic and didn't get any government assistance until summer of 2021. My landlord is the owner of the office above the cafe, I rent what would otherwise be an unused corner of the ground floor and act as a pseudo reception for the building. I'm on a rolling contract and pay a proportion of sales in rent, the previous owner had the same arrangement. I was quite young when I took over and thought this was a good deal, I don't anymore. Also noteworthy, the business was a popup when I took over and transitioned into a standalone during the pandemic. 

After many years of running this business, eleven years total in this industry, I've entirely burnt out. Revenue is down, my mental health is deteriorating and earlier this year, for the first time in my life, I was self harming. I fell a month into rental arrears on the cafe earlier this year and Mr X called me in for a meeting. We agreed on a repayment plan and I am back ahead now. Mr X also asked to raise my rent in this meeting as their lease on the building had just returned to pre-covid amounts. I was not aware they were still recieving relief and again, this was never passed onto me. In that meeting I expressed a desire to eventually move on from the cafe and go back to university. Mr X was enthusiastic about this, he later sent me an email pledging support for this, maintaining that he gets final say on any new tenant, but it sounds like we both have ideas on who that might be. I've shown this email to several friends, including two lawyers, who all agreed it was a green light to look for potential successors. 

Through a friend of a friend, I was approached by a potential buyer (Mr PB) who had nearly twice the experience in this industry I had, involvement with numerous cafes and roasters around the city and personal capital to invest into the business. He gave me a 20 page business proposal and an offer to acquire the equipment and of goodwill. The business plan detailed a minor revamp of the space, shift in focus towards food offerings (prepped off site) and extending closing hours from 5 to 8. The proposal estimated a significant increase in revenue and factored in an offer of nearly double what I already pay in rent. I thought this was perfect for everyone. I met with Ms Y, showed her the proposal and asked her how MR X would respond. She responded that he would be ultimately happy to recieve more money and schedueled a meeting the following afternoon with the three of us, here's how that went. 

Mr X sat down and told me he was 'pissed off' I had the nerve to even bring him a business proposal from someone else. He called their financials 'bullshit', implied I did not reading the proposal and repeatedly accused me of striking deals behind his back. When I reiterated that they approached me and that the financials of their other successful endeavours are redily available on Companies House he scoffed. He expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the shift towards food idea because of odour. I pointed out that it would mostly be prepped off site, creating less odour than the pastries I already make in the shop. At this point he accused me of introducing hot pastries without his permission. This is untrue, we had at least two meetings in 2022 about installing an oven, but unfortunately these were verbal. 

""Get it through your thick skull"" that this isn't your space. He continued to accuse me to going around town making illicit deals and abusing our relationship. I remained apologetic in hopes of diffusing the situation, but this pissed him off more. He then screamed at me demanding to know what was in it for me. I told him their offer (a bit over a years profit). He told me that was disgusting, called me outrageously arrogant for believing I could profit of the sale of my business and refused to even entertain a meeting with the potential buyer unless I offered him half of what they offered me. I pointed out that I paid goodwill to the previous owner, he replied that he was entitled to that money too. 

He started screaming to know how they came to that valuation. When I said goodwill he responded that goodwill is 'always' paid to the landlord. He then tried to tell me that by presenting him with a potential successor I was handing in my notice. I refused to accept this and said I could not afford to simply stop working, hence why I bought forward a potential new tenant. I told him the money could change my life and pay for my degree, while he'd also be making more money in rent. He replied it would change all of our lives, I don't deserve it and if I'm not in a good enough financial position to simply stop working without selling my business then thats my own fault. 

Mr Xs next rant was that his clients were 'embarrassed' to see me using the loo in their office when their in for meetings. I often go hours between toilet breaks as I've been told not to use the only toilet I have access to if there are meetings going on upstairs.   
  
He then proceeded to go into a tirade on how declining revenue was solely due to me not opening early enough and not cleaning the floors thoroughly enough. Revenue is down nearly 30% from 24 months ago, half the offices we rely on for customers have closed as have at least half a dozen other hospo business in this area in the last year alone. People are spending less and the cost of running a business has skyrocketed. Even Mr Xs business has halved its staff in the last two years. I am the only one still working at my shop. I barely take any time off and regularly do 12 day in a row stretches. At this point I would make more money working for someone else, but am still tied to my own business. 

Mr X has been unfriendly towards me for a while. Calling me at all hours accusing people I've had covering the cafe of triggering his offices alarm, even when the connecting door is locked or the cafes been closed for several hours.  Accusing me of lying when I've said that the shop literally wasn't open on (given day) and therefore I or someone working for me couldn't be responsible for (grievance that day). 

Now he knows I want out, but can't afford to walk away and he's holding it over me. He wants me to walk and has said he'll happily let the place go empty while he finds a new tenant, but refuses to entertain anyone I bring to him if I profit off it. He has now rejected an offer to double his receivable rent to spite me. If I sell all the equipment and cash out my lifetime ISA that will just about repay the businesses debts. I'd have to immediately get another job, doing exactly the same thing for someone else. I won't be able to go back to university and I'll be in a poor financial situation for some time. He knows this but 'everyone has problems'. For context I'm a renter in my 20s and he's easily a millionaire with multiple properties. 

I know that this is entirely personal. He's refuting that I don't deserve to profit of a business that I've fully funded myself because as a tenant of his, he sees my business as an extension of his. However when external windows and doors to the shop have needed repairs thats fallen on me because I am 'solely responsible' for the ground floor. This isn't in my contract, but was not the hill to die on. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm on the verge of a breakdown but I can't afford to just walk away, and there doesn't seem to be any logical reasoning with someone whose rejecting more money out of spite. I can't do much if I give him half of what they offered me, and I don't  trust that he would even take the meeting with the potential buyer seriously if I did. 

I've been sexually assaulted twice working in this industry. I've had three instances of attempted violence at the cafe alone. I've been spat at, sworn at and yelled at by the public since I was a teenager. I'm done, I know some people have what it takes to stick with this industry for life, but I'm not one of them. I feel like I am going to scream in the face of the next person who suggests a way I could've worked harder, or downplays the shit I put up with on a daily basis. Maybe I am just whining, I don't care. I've never taken a mental health day, never even taken a sick day. I was back at work the day after I broke my arm, pulling espresso shots with one hand.

Some days I feel like I need resurrection after a 12-hour workday!

Look, I get it. We're all running around like headless chickens, and the idea of simmering bones for 24 hours sounds about as realistic as having time for a proper vacation. But here's the thing, you don't need to be a kitchen wizard to get that liquid gold goodness.

My game-changing hacks:

Ice cube trays are your BFF – Make a big batch on Sunday, freeze in portions. Pop 2-3 cubes into your morning coffee (trust me on this one) or evening tea. Instant collagen boost without the fuss.

Pressure cooker magic – 2 hours gets you what used to take all day. Toss in chicken feet (yeah, I know, sounds gross but they're collagen bombs), some veggie scraps, and water. Set it and forget it.

Store-bought shortcuts – No shame in the convenience game. Grab a ready-made bone broth from the grocery store, just make sure it's certified halal.

Your gut will thank you, your skin will glow, and you'll actually have energy for Netflix. Win-win-win!

1m77cbb,https://youtu.be/nx87Nfv4LH4?si=9l4sIVHoaSd6Zr4-,Coffee Makers - Las Calles de Medellín [Instrumental],"🎶 Coffee Makers – “Las Calles de Medellín” “The Streets of Medellín” is a richly layered instrumental that channels the pulse of urban Colombia through ska and dub textures—no vocals, just groove, mood, and motion. Horns rise and fall like sirens in the distance, while the rhythm section holds steady like footsteps on worn pavement. It’s the opening track of El Camino (2004), an album widely regarded in Colombia’s reggae scene.

The band’s name—Coffee Makers—is no accident. It nods to Colombia’s iconic national export, but also reflects their craft: they brew rhythm and atmosphere the way others brew coffee—patiently, intentionally, and with unmistakable identity.

Build your perfect place in the comments.
Nothing is too much or too unrealistic.

I say that, as I think of my own ideal, which isn't too fantastical, and not really a dungeon either, but a place.

---

⛰️Mine would be a secluded wooden cabin, in a forest somewhere up on the mountain. Somewhere beautiful, like the Alps or Carpathians. No neighbors or civilization for a few miles. And ideally, my sub would have built it. It's his, but he craves my presence to fill the silence and need.

🪵It's a normal cabin with whatever a house might need - a kitchen he makes my coffee in, a bathroom he loves to wash and massage my feet in, a bedroom where he might get a break, a fireplace for when I'm soft and I let him fuck me properly.

🖼️Decorated nicely with memorabilia, photos, quilts and a big old colorful rug in front of the fireplace, where he kneels while I'm sipping some wine.

⛓️ It has a cold and stoney cellar, where a bunch of wine and supplies are kept - where he goes and serves when he forgets how to behave.

🌲The forest is right there, ancient and beautiful. Silent apart from trees creaking in the wind, birds and critters. No other humans around. There's damp thick moss everywhere, soft and perfect for walking around barefoot, for him to lay naked in it while he serves me daily. If it rains, he doesn't mind - we like the rain, and there's a fireplace back inside anyways.

I worked at this place for about 9 months, and I decided that I want to quit. Reasons for me wanting to quit include them being very inconsistent with my payments, sometimes they will be late other times they would only give me some of it and then later in give me the rest, not to mention that for most of it it was below the minimum wage.
The work environment is very bad at least in my eyes, I've never had a ""normal"" job before this one but I feel like this environment is bad. The coffee shop is owned by this pretty rich family, I'm the only one working there who is not part of the family, most of the time I'm working with the daughter of one of the owners, and she would be very mean a lot of the times, mood swings, one minute she'll be happy and we'd have normal conversations, the next she would be yelling at me over the smallest things and a lot of the times it had nothing to do with me. The mother would be mostly fine until she got close she would be very touchy, she would grab my hips and sometimes touch my ass which I very much did not like. The older daughter is the official owner of the coffee shop, to my mind she was the most normal one, the level headed professional one and I did look up to her because everytime I got to work with her it was great. I made the decision to quit because it really was getting out of hand and it is pretty far from where I live. I contacted the boss and messaged her that I want to quit. I had to message her because she lives in another city I couldn't tell her face to face. 
I wrote up my message as professionally as I could and told her I wanted out, she went on to ignore me that whole day but told her sister who I work with most of the time, so I got a message from the sister asking what happened and why I wanted to quit, I found this not cool ignoring me but telling her when she has nothing to do with this. I told the sister that I want to quit, she asked why and I ignored her because she really has nothing to do with it. At around 6pm I get a text from the boss saying she got out of work and that when she gets home she'll text me. She proceeded to not say anything that night. I get a text from her the next day at around 10am saying that she thinks the way I'm doing this is not nice that I had already agreed to work the month that is coming up and that if I want to work that month or if I want to do this differently, I genuinely don't remember agreeing to work that next month but It could have been my mistake as I am not the best at the language that is spoken here. I apologized and said that I would want to quit as soon as possible, and that my reasonings were the inconsistency with the payments and the extra hours the tell me I have to work only telling me when I get to work, and how it's a lot of work and I am always running the risk of not getting home because of my trains. She went on to say that the workload has always been the same and that of course the work is going to feel worse if I'm always showing up sleep deprived or hungover, granted I have shown up hungover and I do agree that it's not a good thing to do but it never really impacted on how I worked so I don't know why she brought that up. I completely ignored the weird insults and apologized again and said that I wanted to quit because of this unpaid month which they haven't paid and that the pay is below minimum wage, and that the reasons I'm sleep deprived are also because of the extra hours they have made me work. And that I would like to quit as soon as possible and asking how we could go on with this. They have only very recently raised my pay, and gave me a contract but the only reason this ever happened was because there was this big festival happening and they were scared the person controlling would stop by and check us. So she went on to say that I am in fact not paid less than minimum wage because I get paid this new salary,which I have only had for a month. And on a new message today she basically went back to Insulting me and that they actually have had my payment in an envelope at the coffee shop. However the last time I worked there the mother was saying that she still has to go and get my payment so all the sudden after I mentioned it,it's been at the coffee shop the whole time ? Well I have the the payment there waiting for me she said but I still have to get paid for this month and I don't know if they will try to somehow not pay me because they are some shady people, I just don't know how to proceed with this and any and all advice would be very helpful and I would very much appreciate it.

I hate that I have to hide the fact that I want someone to love me.

Even if someone did give me a chance they’d give up on me the minute I expressed any of my actual thoughts.

Oh, and I’m still madly in love (emphasis on madly) with a guy who forgot I exist. Is it an entirely self-inflicted and wholly idiotic thing to even feel? Obviously. But it still won’t go away, either. 

Dating Apps are still absolutely awful. I am so, so, so *tired* of men talking to me about sex lol. Can’t we go for coffee or talk about our interests and passions?

[$2500],"So I've been in love with coffee since I was a kid, I blame my mom who'd let me steal a sip from hers as a 5 yo, and I remember being in 6th grade, making a pot of coffee before school.  So my Son-in-Law is staying with me, and he's got a Breville, Impressa I think.  I've gotten hooked on making a few drinks a day, pretty much all Lattes and Iced Americano's.  

Anyways, I'm a bit overwhelmed looking at machines.  I was looking at The Gaggia Classic Pro and the Rancilio Silvia.  Also a double boiler seems nice, but maybe it's not a need.  I also read because of the larger boilers on some of these, they need to warm up, so it should have a timer and stay on all day?  I had a cheap machine at some point, but it broke and I absolutely want something I can fix if it breaks, but don't want to be tinkering with it more than every few years (descaling and normal maintenance seems fine).

Anyways, I could see myself going deep in here, but I can't help but feel spending 3x is just a waste.  I did get a nice single shot manual grinder which I use for the decaf in the afternoon when a 3rd - 5th cup would be super unwise.

Anyways, should I just go with a Bambino?  Seems like the simple Barista Express is about the same amount here.  Will I actually notice a difference?  
  
I will say on the grinding side, a solid GBW grinder, or something with a good timer, seems best for my personality.  I did the pour over thing because my BIL does, but after a week I went to a nice auto machine, with an insulated carafe, with daily grinding.  So I'm not going pre-weigh a single shot multiple times a day, that's half the reason my sourdough starter is inactive ATM.  I don't mind dialing in a machine over a few mornings for my beans, but most days I just want to make a good drink and be done, then jump back when I can (I work from home thankfully).  My SILs has already probably saved me a few hundred between me and my wife over the past month already.

I also need to get a full tamping setup if people want to share ideas.  I was close to getting one last week for the single shot grinder.  Also, how do you not make a mess pouring from the cup to the group?

It starts off innocent: you’re just matching random items. A rubber duck here, a coffee mug there. Cute, right?

* You need a new way to procrastinate
* You secretly want to be better at Tetris but with random household items

I'm looking for recommendations that are:

1. Good quality- doesn't have to be perfect, but something that has ok color, doesn't pill after a few washes, and is better than a crappy looking vinyl iron on.

2. User friendly! We're looking for something that is easy for us to upload about 20 different images in a week, and that has a simple interface for us being able to advertise to parents what is available and easy for them to navigate and make their orders.

3. We're a nonprofit, and the primary goals here are quality and ease, but making some money off of these would be super cool.

People have recommended redbubble and printify-I'm not sure if either of those is a good choice, or some other company?

Feel free to drop a referral link if you have one- we have no account set up yet so we would be creating a new one and would be happy to give someone some referral bonus if you help us find a good vendor!

It just came in from Gareth, who joined ROYA recently:

\----------------------------------

""1 for 1 🎯

Just got off a very fun & GREAT coffee date with someone in my warm network and his team.

The bot ran so smoothly & gave answers better than in the demo runs I was doing before the call 😂🦾

The company is a nationwide boiler fitter with a large list of 100k leads in the last 5 years, they also have access to a partner list of 750k leads they can sell a service plan to.

𝐅𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐫 𝐛𝐨𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐫 𝐟𝐢𝐭 𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞

100k leads, assuming a 30% response rate and then a 5% sale rate, is 2000 sales @ £150 (50% of profit) = £300k my way

𝐅𝐨𝐫 𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐬

850k leads, assuming a 30% response rate and then a 5% sale rate is 17,000 sales @ £312 (50% of profit) = £5.3m my way

Quite a few assumptions in there but tbh even if I earned £100k out of this, I'd be satisfied.

Meeting next Wednesday to discuss specifics.""

\----------------------------------

Did you catch that?

He's looking at a potential £5.6 MILLION in commission from just ONE client... after just ONE coffee meeting. Even Gareth admits this might be optimistic, but says he'd be satisfied with ""just"" £100k from this single deal.

It’s not every day you see someone post huge numbers in ROYA. But it’s happening more and more these days. And I know 2025 is shaping up to be another killer year for ROYA students.

Because we're not just selling ""AI tools"" - we're connecting businesses with the goldmine sitting in their dead databases.

Just like how Lawrence went from joining our program to consistently banking £20K profit WEEKS using our system...

Or how Liam secured a £100k deal over 12 months with a mortgage broker...

Gareth is using our exact process to tap into 850,000 untouched leads that could generate millions.

He works in a public-facing and busy role, and we initially connected over shared interest in an activity/hobby. He found me on Instagram, and we live in the same area. He reached out first, saying he had seen some of my work and was overall just nice. The conversation grew. He started with long messages, and I usually just mirror the person I’m talking to. And after a couple of days, he asked me for coffee. We did some time later. Felt normal, not weird. 

We agreed to exchange work over email, and he began with a long-winded intro. It was fine, but he used somewhat charged language. We’ve gone back and forth a bit, and his emails are a lot. Nice but long. His tone of language could be taken in different ways; it's confusing. 

It didn’t feel like a typical casual friendship. I’ve been away for the summer and just assumed it would die out until it came back. He also sent me a long farewell message the day before I left. We’ve engaged probably on a weekly basis over dm while I’ve been gone, plus email exchange. He almost always re-watches my stories (like three times). 

So I asked him straightforwardly and respectfully what his intentions were. Saying I value clarity. It was a very normal and nice message. He replied in an interesting way. He never answered straight out by saying platonic or something more. He admitted to ambiguity; he said he was trying to remain respectful because of the life stage difference. He said the interest in the shared hobby is just something extra now. He said he hasn’t wanted to assume where I’m coming from. He said our conversations have depth and ease. He also said something about maybe deepening into something more. This reply did not seem to imply a platonic relationship at all, which was fine to me. 

I replied, saying I’ve also enjoyed the connection. And ya it would need a convo because of the ""age gap"" (I don't know if this wording scared him), but also asked again for his intentions, because he didn’t answer in a straightforward manner the first time. 

Then he replied and said he “misread” my earlier message, and he has been purely platonic this whole time with no other motive. He said he wants to meet me honestly. He still avoided the actual question. He actually pushed the question back on me and asked me what I was implying. It was a very odd backpedal. I am unsure why he never said it was platonic the first time I asked. 

I’m not sure what to think. I don’t feel like I was projecting; I just wanted clarity. I also find it hard to believe this was just a platonic interest. How can I reply to the message to actually get clarity? I wonder if I misread the whole situation. 

TLDR: I (21F) have been talking to a man (35M) for about 3 months. We connected over a shared hobby. He found me online and initiated conversation. Things grew gradually. I asked him what his intentions were, and he responded vaguely, saying he’s been respectful due to the age gap, finds our conversations deep, and mentioned the potential to “deepen into something more.” It didn’t sound platonic. When I followed up for clarity, he suddenly backpedaled, said he misread my message, claimed it’s been purely platonic from his side, and then turned it around on me, asking what I was implying. It felt like a weird 180. Now I’m confused. Why didn’t he just say it was platonic from the start? And how do I respond to get actual clarity without it being deflected?

First story I have written in the format, it automatically gets removed by Nosleep, so I thought I would post it here. enjoy!

I have been working as an astrophysicist for years, today was the first time something interesting has happened. The day began like any other day, I woke up, drove up to the lab, and brewed myself a cup of coffee. I took my drink and carried myself through the hall and to the second last door where I would be working on my current project, but there was no one there, where there would usually be machines whirring, fluids bubbling, and just people talking in general. Was replaced by an almost uncanny silence. Most notable was the absence of Lance. Lance was one of my best friends from university, and always stayed late and came half an hour early, he was strange like that. I put down my cup and sat down until I heard yelling down the hall. I ran over and stumbled in to see everyone. They were standing or sitting around the table talking. “What the hell is going on?” I asked them. Patel spoke up. He was a small scrawny man, with glasses and messy hair. He was unconfident, stuttering  and then spat it out in his scared little quiet voice. “There's a hole in the sky.”

“What the fuck? What do you mean there's a hole in the sky?” I tried to yell, but the pure absurdity of the situation kept my voice down. “Last night Lance was looking through the telescope trying to study Callisto, and he saw it right by jupiter, a fucking hole in the sky!” I scanned the room but couldn't see Lance anyware.  “Where is he now? Did he tell you this?” “Well, we found this on a notepad he wrote, next to his body. He shot himself last night.” I tried to scream, I tried to say something, but before I realized what was happening I fell to my knees and I felt tears streaming down the sides of my face. Next thing I could remember it was the next week. I must have got through the week, I ate and I slept, but it is a complete lapse in my memory. After that I started going back to work. It was quiet there, no one wanted to talk after what happened, but it was hard to ignore. All work there had focused on the hole in the sky. This place has become so surreal and confusing. At least I still had the shitty coffee in the break room to take solace in. 

As I walked I was greeted by my coworkers. “Hi Neil” “Hi John” “Hello Neil” “Hi Patel.” I went over to the machine and tried to pour myself some coffee, it was out but at this point I didn't even care anymore. As I sat down, no drink in hand, I couldn't help but overhear my colleagues' conversation. “What do you think of all this?” “What is there to think about, why would you think about it? God knows I try not to.” “I think it's god punishing us.” “Ok.” I couldn't sit back and listen anymore. I had to interject and ask questions. “What does it look like?” I stammered, they were surprised to hear me, Patel even spilled his coffee a bit. “No ones seen it since Lance, of course.” John answered.”Why not?” “He killed himself.” “Well we’ll need to look eventually and what are we going to do for-” Patel cut me off. “Um, we're trying to get some uh less privileged people to test this out.” I understood, they were going to get homeless people to look at the hole. “Well, more power to you if that's how you're going to do it.” 

Today the first homeless person came in. His name was David, he’s been on the streets for a while and wrapped up in a lot of bad shit, a perfect target for the likely possibility that this goes wrong. He looked through it. “What the fuck is in this tellerscope?” “What the fuck, holy shit what the fuck is that whats in the fucking-” he paused for a moment “This is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, Its so beatiful, you have to look!” We looked at each other uneasily, then he got violent. “Look, you have to fucking look!” He came at Patel “Fucking look!” three other men restrained him “Its so beautiful, so fucking beautiful!” He was dragged out screaming. Patel was visibly shaken by this. I was the first to approach him. “You okay buddy?” No response. “Here let's go sit down in the break room.” I held his shoulder and led him into the break room while the rest of the lab just watched solemnly. I wanted to get mad, I wanted to scream at them for how they dismissed Patel, he was a real human being like the rest of them and he was basically being ignored, but when I saw their expressions I decided to bite my tongue. Everyone in that room went through the same thing, we all saw what happened, I was just the only one numb to it all. We both sat down on the old couch, it was comfortable but still a bare minimum for this lab. I was zoning out hearing the hum of the lights and pipes until Patel broke the silence. “I’m going to look at the hole.” 

It’s been a week since Patel looked at the hole, I thought it would be a bigger thing but it just kind of came and went. After arguing with us for hours he ran up to the telescope, looked at it, simply said “Oh” and then left. We didn't see him for a few days then he came back in. When we questioned him about the hole he just said “It is a hole, not much more to it” and wouldn't elaborate. We were at a standstill, one man had looked at the hole and killed himself, one had seemingly gone insane but that may not have been an effect of the hole, and one seemed completely fine. After a long evaluation we decided to cut our losses and start looking. There was no other way to study it, and if anyone was looking it should be us. We started taking shifts looking at it and documenting what we saw. Everyone had a partner, mine was Patel, just my luck. 

The first time I looked at the hole gave me an indescribable feeling. I thought it would just look like a strange galaxy or a colourful circle, but it was a full on hole in the sky. It was black, black doesn't even describe it, it's the blackest black ever observed, it's blacker than the middle of the night, it's blacker than an eclipse with no moon, it's blacker than a night sky, without a single illuminating star. It was noticeably darker than the rest of the sky, and noticeably indented into the sky with small cracks around it, but nonetheless it was beautiful. When my turn ended I was angry at first, I wanted to keep this beauty to myself, no one else should get this, it should be mine! Then I realized how insane I sounded and ran to the break room. I sat down, and I was greeted by John and Gerald. Gerald immediately started questioning me about the hole. “What was it like?” “Deep” “Well, what did it look like?” “Like a hole” “I know it looked like a hole what did it-” “Jesus would you leave him alone, he just looked through the hole!” It was John who finally interrupted him. Weeks started going by, blending together and life finally started to feel mundane. 

The hole started growing. We noticed it yesterday, it's definitely been growing, slowly but definitely. We have been observing the hole, but not learning about it. The hole still is a mystery. Late into one night we started proposing theories. “I think it's something from another world, looking in, trying to see more, but something much too large to truly experience the beauty this world has to offer” This was Lisa, she had been working here almost as long as me, she was smart poetic, and i'm not ashamed to say it beautiful, I held onto every last word. “I think its a fucking hole” It was Gerald “Shut up Gerald” It was John “This whole thing has just made me more religious, isnt this obviously god the rapture is imminent!” “Speaking of religion, what do you make out of all this Patel” it was Gerald again “Gerald I'm an atheist, I think this is a tear in the cosmos just a random possibility of probability that demonstrates the true randomness of the universe.” The rest of the night followed similarly with people proposing everything from aliens to time travel. The next week the hole grew more, then shrank then became larger than ever. 

The hole has gone public. Long story short, Gerald got drunk and told some reporters he met at a bar. To his defence he said she was really hot. We told him he shouldn't come back to the lab and so far he hasn't. It started small, we didn't think anyone would really believe in this hole, maybe a few crackpot conspiracy theorists, but otherwise we would be fine. 

We were wrong. As soon as the story hit the news cycle everything started to crack and crumble. Every country's government has made a statement on it, every podcast has something to say about it and no one knows what to do. Some sort of new religion has started up and is already the fourth largest in america. From what I can tell they worship the hole as some sort of deity. I went to the lab today and there were CIA agents everywhere, looks like we won't be the lead researchers in this anymore. I’m going to call Patel. It’s been a week since the news went public, there's now a constant video public online of the hole, it's getting bigger and can now be seen in the night sky, tiny but still there. I've been meeting up with some of the guys from work, and it seems like we’ve all been laid off. Real shame, but I don't know how much longer this will matter. It seems like every day they predict the economy will collapse, but it's been fine for now. Also there's a million news reports of people who have gone crazy from the hole. The streets are full of them, many preach about the holes in religion, many are just insane the more I speak on this topic, the more dread gets filled through me as I wonder if I can make it to tomorrow. 

I was bored and decided to go to the park today, a bad idea. The parks are just filled with people who aren't inside churches, or other places of worship. These people are driven mad by the hole, and find solace in treating it as though it was a deity, fear is how this religion must grow, fear and anguish. Some of these people seem sane or lucid, but most are just standing there staring ahead barely listening to what the “pastor” was saying. I looked around and jumped when I realized there was a man standing right behind me smiling, silently. “Would you like a flyer?” He reached out his hand and I noticed it was filled with an absurd amount of flyers advertising his religion. “No thank you” “Oh you must take one” “No I’m fine” “You must” Then he put his hand on my shoulder firmly, and I ran. I had to maneuver through the never ending labyrinth of the crowd. Nomatter how far I got I would look back and see the man following me. As I traveled inevitably deeper through this maze more and more people offered me flyers of a religion based on the discoveries of my deceased colleague, a gross cacophony of flesh and grass, the more men I pushed out of the way the more of an open path I left behind me for him to follow. I ran, and then I walked. I don't know for how long, but I do know that when the chase had ended and I was out of the park, it was dark out. I was sweaty and delirious, but I didn't see him anywhere and then I threw up, right outside the park and then I walked home. I stayed in my home for days just eating out of the fridge and sleeping, and watching the ever changing news cycle, although it stays stagnant on a topic now. 

This was until I ran out of groceries and knew I needed to go out. I walked out, I felt like the last man alive, there was noone around it was uncanny. I felt like I had to sneak around the town. There were people just sitting outside churches, and the parks were full of thousands of people, there were even people spilling into the streets. I went into the store and it took a while to find anything close to fresh, and then it took me even longer to find an open cash register. I would have just stolen it but then I noticed some teenage girl standing at the counter and felt bad for him. “Hey, I'll just get these” “You want a bag” “Yeah I guess” “You want a flyer” “What?” A flyer, what would she have a flyer for? Then she handed me the flyer for this religion. I took my food and ran out without leaving. I looked around and there was no one  around me right until I turned the corner and saw him. I ran home and almost dropped my food, but got there safe. At nine pm there was a knock at the door. It was him again, I didn't answer, and the knocks got louder, and I went to my room, and the news wouldnt work, and the knocks got louder, and I sat down, and I plugged my ears, and the knocking stopped, and he went away. I tried to sleep but I couldn't so I took some melatonin and eventually fell asleep. The next day I barricaded my door. 

Several days later I woke up in the middle of the night to a window breaking. I stayed in my bed and pulled the covers higher. I heard creaking and I knew I couldn't stay put forever. The bed was warm and hard to leave. The bed was safe. I didn't know if I could bear to run into possible danger. Then I decided that if there was an intruder they might not know I was home, and who knows, maybe the glass was from a different house? I spent around a half hour just rationalizing this for myself until I worked up the courage to go downstairs. I snuck around, my own house like I was in some villain's lair, I kept the lights off and made no noise. I patted the carpet, ever so slowly with my feet, I heard a creak, it was from my own feet, and it was the loudest thing I had heard in hours, my sweat went cold, and I froze. I didn't move for ten minutes, ten minutes spent just standing, then I prayed to god, not some hole in the sky, that anyone in this house had not heard me. I stepped, waited then stepped again. This went on for what felt like hours but I’m not quite sure just how long it took. After what felt like an eternity of feeling the walls and sometimes crawling because I couldn't see a thing, I made it to the kitchen. This had been my goal, my end point, I was here to grab a knife from the kitchen, although it didn't feel like mine anymore. I felt around and I found them, the knives, I felt instantly more confident and I grabbed my largest knife. This was my moment of hubris, the single moment in my life where I was so overconfident it could have led to my downfall. 

I yelled. “Try to fucking come at me now!” “Yeah I got a fucking knife!” Then another smaller “You’re fucked.” Then I saw his silhouette in the hallway, smiling at me ear to ear. He was watching me in the dark, I don't know for how long. He could've been by the kitchen the whole time but from his reaction I could tell he had been following me around my house, just out of sight, but I wasn't out of his. Stalking me, treating me like prey in my own home. For all I know he could have been watching me from my bedroom hall, and he likely was there when I stepped on the creaking step, in the darkness watching me thinking I was safe. I stepped towards him, a feeble intimidation attempt, then he stepped back, away from me. I could notice he still had the flyers in his hand, then he rushed at me. It caught me so off guard I almost fell back, and then I did when he pounced on top of me. He said in the most jarring calm voice based on the situation “How about taking a flyer?” I hit my arm on my cabinet and it started bleeding, I felt so helpless in my own home , I wasn't going to die like this I would let it happen. Then the next thing I realized the knife was in his chest, then out, then in again, and again, and again, until his body went limp on top of me. A tear started dripping down my cheek, then again, then again, and then I was crying.

 I've killed someone, I can't come back from this, I can't ever. I didn't know what to do so I called nine one one. I didn't know what to expect, but there was no answer. Then I called the next best thing John. Turns out he’s been staying at his family's old cottage outside of town, he says he can come get me but it will take a few days. I don't feel safe here anymore, but I have nowhere else to go so I just have to stay put in my room. I put a towel over my cut arm, and stayed there. The news still didn't work. I could hear people walking and talking just outside my house but no one came in.

I was beyond relieved when I got the text I’m outside, hop in. I was so happy to see John's car parked on the curb of my street. We drove up for a couple hours and talked. “How's this been for you?” “Horrible those cult members have been following me around, and one attacked me.” “What’s the deal with them? I went up to the cottage as soon as we got laid off and this is the first time I've seen them.” I couldn't believe that he had completely avoided these people while I was subjected to it? It felt bad, it felt unfair. Then I calmed myself down for the rest of the drive. 

We got to his cottage, it was a small place in the woods secluded next to a beautiful lake. We stayed and had an honestly good time. We would swim and cook, there was an insane amount of food there. When I asked where he got it he just said he took a lot when he left town, ominous. I had no objections. One night we made a fire and sat by it talking late into the night. “How do you think the hole started” “I think it's a mistake, an accident by some higher being, living out there in the cosmos, what do you think?” “I think it's a black hole, and if it's growing it might not be good for us” “That would suck” “Aren't the stars beautiful out here? Ever since I was little I've loved just staring up at it, I guess that's why I became an astrophysicist.” I looked up, it was beautiful. I could see all the stars, but the hole in sky was fucking huge, as big if not larger as the moon. “The hole has gotten bigger” “Yeah” “Why do you think Lance killed himself when he saw it, he's the only one” “Well everyone else pretty much has gone insane, have you seen the cult, and I’m sure there's others.” This world had become bleak, not a future worth living in. “You think?” “Yeah, I think and if it makes you feel any better you are really brave for not” “What”? That night at the fire John came on to me. I was taken aback, I’m not gay, I never have been. I ran back to the cabin and went to my room, making sure not to talk to John anymore, I couldn't believe he would use a vulnerable moment like that to get to me. 

I woke up late to someone knocking on the door then breaking in. I got up confused and made my way to the door of my room only to see him. “I thought you fucking dead?” How he was alive it didn't make sense. “You sure you wouldn't like a flyer?” I ran from him, I ran out the door and into the night, he was following me he chased after me into the forest, I ran for hours and even when I was exhausted in the woods leaning on trees. He was still following me. He wasn't slower than me, and he wasn't faster. He would always match my pace. After hours I thought the sun had started to come up, but it was just the hole. It had gotten so large. I fell over. He lept, or pretty much fell onto me. “Would you like a flyer?” The man's mouth frothing saliva all over my face. I couldn't overpower him and I couldn't get away. I finally exclaimed “Fine!” “Ill take a fucking flyer!” “Thank you.” He crawled back on all fours through the woods backwards; it was uncanny. I was going to look at the note but it was night, then I realized it was day and the sun was shining, it was hot, how had I not noticed this? I looked at the flyer but all it read was Kill Yourself! The new age religion, join us! Lance didn't, and you know what happened to him. What? How did the flyer know? Then I woke up. 

It was around three am. I couldn't fall back asleep and when six am came I knew what must be done. I needed to go to one of their gatherings and talk to a religious leader, take the flyer, and make that next step. I got up and took John's car. I felt bad but I really needed to get out of there. I'll apologize to John the next time I see him. I drove back to the city, back to the place I never thought I’d return to. The drive gave me time to think. A place where all of my nightmares come from and all of my friends and family have become distorted versions of themselves, and religion a mockery of the skies, and angels that came before. I’m not sure what's happening in other cities, states, and countries. Similar things must be happening. It was strange, knowing how important I had felt when this whole thing started. We were the ones that discovered this hole, and we felt like we were the lead researchers, keeping this huge secret from the rest of the world. Now I was as insignificant as anyone, I was a nobody, this wouldn't feel as bad if it didn't feel  like I used to be somebody, somebody important well, now where I go I’m going to get answers, whether the answers are true or answers are what I want will be subjective, but I will have a answer and that's what matters to me now. 

I got back into town and pulled into my driveway. Then I started walking to the park. Where there were once huge crowds of people there were buildings, they were like huge old wooden monasteries that must have been built by the crowds, giving them a true place of worship. I went in and was shocked, there were hundreds of more people than there used to be here and they were all packed into this space, just standing there. It didn't look like they had eaten anything, or slept, or moved from that spot in days. I made my way through the crowd. Coming now to the centre of the labyrinth very intentionally sacrificing any self respect I may have had. Once I got to the front I saw someone I never thought I would see again, Patel. “Patel what are you doing here I thought you were an atheist?” “I've decided I might as well take something up this time, everyone in the city has.” “Well everyone else here is crazy, are you?” “No but I stick with the crowd, it gives me food and shelter.” “Well can you take me to whoever the leader is here?” “What do you need?” “I need the answers.” “Ill take you to the prophet.” Patel led me back out through the corn maze with walls of flesh, he knew how to maneuver through it so well. He took me out which took forever, then took me through this park to the only relatively small tent. “I can't go in with you” “Why” “I have been baptized by the cosmos, he will only talk to those virgin to the stars.” 

I thanked Patel and then made my way into the tent. All there was in there was an old man sitting on a rock in front of a small pond. He was completely bald, wearing a long robe, and blind. “Hello” “Hello Neil.” He knew my name already. “Are you the prophet?” “Some people call me the prophet, some the oracle, some the moon man, some lesser minded call me a fortune teller, I will happily take on any of these names for our purposes.” “Ok Oracle” “I have foreseen you coming here, but the future paths split from there, what do you seek from coming here?” “I seek answers oracle.” He just fully launched into an explanation. “The hole opened in the sky, homunculi were not ready for it. The first man to gaze upon this hole could not live with the knowledge it granted, but the knowledge was granted only to him, and now there is no way for him to communicate it, No vessel for the hole. Humans always want answers and the fact the only one who could give it to them couldn't, caused them to find solace in false prophets. Religion is their ultimate form of escapism, they won't allow the questions gone, no matter how they are, no matter what position they place themselves in the will to continue, that's stubbornness, that's the beauty.” “Thank you oracle.” This explanation didn't help me at all. I still have no clue what's going on. I left the tent and went with Patel. “Did you find the answers you seeked?” “No, do you want to leave Patel?” “I would love to” Patel and I left the strange group of wooden churches and just started walking. We walked for hours, we just kept walking, it was night and we looked up the hole was bigger than ever. 

The hole has grown so large it has eclipsed the moon. I don't know if there is a moon anymore, I don't know how much of anything is still there. 

The abyss eclipsed the moon, the abyss eclipsed the sun. It may have swallowed them, it may have swallowed the entire galaxy. The abyss grew for months, it grew for years, it might have even grown for decades. Humanity changed throughout that time. It didn't develop, it stayed somewhat stagnant. Technology regressed, and politics suffered. The abyss didn't care, the abyss kept growing. It eclipsed the stars, it eclipsed the planets, swallowing everything like some, foreign creature from another world. There was no more history, there were no more nations to rise or fall. There was the abyss, and the abyss was all encompassing. As humanity collectively opened its eye to the abyss, it was unable to comprehend it.",1,1753271027.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

It’s not an excuse but it wasn’t a conscious decision — it was like a fight or flight reaction. She has severe health issues that are made worse by drinking. She’s a mom.

We were together for ten years—two of them engaged—and had just moved into a bigger apartment (Of course, paid for by me). Then suddenly, he meets someone at work. Nice woman, slightly older than me. They get along well, and of course, she’s *just a friend.*

We even go on double dates (she’s married, by the way), and we chat. My hyper-sensitive social radar already tells me she doesn’t like me, and she always tries to meet up with my ex alone. A normal person would’ve seen the writing on the wall. But after years of emotional manipulation, I couldn’t have recognized a red flag if it slapped me in the face.

So, a few weeks go by. My ex keeps acting the same—disgustingly manipulative—and still swears eternal love to me. Meanwhile, I’m adjusting to a new medication that absolutely wrecked me. Constant nausea, dizziness, extreme fatigue. It kept getting worse. What I didn’t know at the time: the medication had triggered pancreatitis. My body was literally starting to shut down. The sicker I got, the more annoyed my ex became with my chronic illness. “Go see a doctor,” he snapped (I was already going *weekly* since my diagnosis a year prior). “Stop being so dramatic.”

Then came his birthday. Things exploded. I was sick, lying on the couch, and he wanted to visit his family. Fine. I didn’t want to ruin his day. But I had a terrible feeling in my gut—and surprise, it was right. He came home, I couldn’t hold it in anymore, and broke down in tears. Instead of comforting me, he yelled that he didn’t know if he could do this anymore. I was stunned. I didn’t understand what was happening. He stormed out, took our (actually, *my*) car, and left me home alone without a way to get around.

Days went by. Silence. Then he came back, told me he’d chosen me, that he loved me. Oh—and by the way, he had fallen in love with that friend. And I—naïve and desperate—just... accepted it. I was relieved that “everything would be okay.”  
The next morning? He insisted on meeting her again. And the whole thing started over. He didn’t come home. Left me alone. Again. By now I couldn’t even eat.

Eventually, he graced me with the news that our engagement was off. And I accepted that too. My one rule: *That woman does not set foot in my home.*  
Fueled by the adrenaline of the breakup, my symptoms temporarily eased up. I took care of everything: packed my things, made arrangements for our two cats, finished renovating the apartment, and planned to move in with my family.

What did he do? Took his gaming PC and some paperwork. Left all the trash, mess, and random household junk behind—for me to clean up. And guess what I found while tidying? A bedroom reeking of her perfume, a torn-up bed, and a used condom on my new carpet.

Lovely.

I broke. Ten years of emotional abuse came crashing down at once. I was a wreck.  
A few weeks later, my body finally gave out, and I spent a week in the hospital.

Up to this point, it sounds like a sad story. But honestly? *Thank. God.*

  
In the hospital I finally saw things cllear:

The emotional abuse? Finally over.  
The affair? The only thing brutal enough to snap me out of the illusion that this was a happy relationship. There was no room left to blame myself.  
My self-worth? You can’t break what doesn’t exist.

A few weeks later, he sent me an email (I had blocked him everywhere else), asking for copies of his job application materials. For the first time in my life, I wrote back: *“You’re not getting them. Go fuck yourself.”* And I didn’t feel bad.

(For context: his original documents were stained with coffee and gross beyond belief. I’m a graphic designer, so I had cleaned everything up digitally to make them presentable. After the breakup, I deleted the files. No idea where his copies are now.)

Oh, and I told his mom what her darling son had been up to.  
Cost him his place to live—she and I had always been close.

And today?  
Thanks to therapy, I’ve learned that I already had complex trauma before I even met him—and that’s the only reason I tolerated the abuse for so long.  
One year of therapy and a hell of a lot of self-reflection turned me into a different person.  
I have my chronic illness under control, my mental health is the best it’s ever been, and I now have a partner who gives me everything my ex never could. He is kind, loving, helps me through rough patches when my disease strikes again. (And just to twist the knife a little deeper: My ex always felt insecure about not earning enough. My current partner makes *twice* as much as I do—*and I still earn more than my ex ever did.* It’s not about the money… but as payback? Chef’s kiss.) Im living my absolute best life and would have never been possible with this good for nothing piece of shit.

What my ex did was the *best* thing that could’ve happened to me.

During that time, I’ve been going on and off to the gym. But about 2 months ago, I got consistent with my workouts.

Fast forward to a few days ago a friend came over with some pre-workout (Total War). I took half a scoop and felt fine. Good energy, good session, no issues. Liked it enough that I decided to get my own tub.

The first day I took my own scoop (just half again), everything went sideways. Mid-session I started feeling super anxious, heart racing, hands shaking, chest tight, like I couldn’t breathe properly. Thought I was going to pass out. Ended up in the emergency room. It was that bad.

After that, I cut off all caffeine for 2–3 weeks. But now, even when I drink a small cup of coffee, my heart rate spikes, I feel anxious, jittery, and uncomfortable. I haven’t touched pre-workout since.

Of all the examples Starbucks could have used for training, they should have thought better. Sitting through more of this idiotic training that Ol Chipotle Steve thinks is helping his company, we get to the “negative part” where the customers are experiencing bad wait times, or they’re just having a bad day, blah blah blah, so  tell me this, why in the world would they use a “woman waiting for cancer results” as a example? My dad just died from cancer, my mother in law has cancer, and they put this voice behind this “customer” like the coffee is the only thing ruining  her day? Girl cancer is not something to play around with. And I am so sad Starbucks thought that would be a way to get baristas to have “sympathy” for impatient people.

[How China came to rule the rare earth world : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/23/nx-s1-5475137/china-rare-earth-elements)

[This is a satellite image collected on Nov. 13, 2012, of the Maoniuping Mine, one of China's largest rare earth elements mines, located near Mianning, Sichuan province, China.DigitalGlobe\/Maxar via Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/5o6qg4z7nlef1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=14c8fe81a037bdd99824c0930439e8ae4036b60f)

Deep in an underground, World War II-era vault on the outskirts of Frankfurt, Germany, investment manager Louis O'Connor guards his firm's most valuable assets. The treasure inside? Rare earth elements.

""Make no mistake about it, there's 3 1/2-meter walls and doors and armed security,"" says O'Connor, the CEO of Strategic Metals Invest, a firm that lets individual investors buy into stockpiles of rare earths.

Many so-called rare earth elements are actually quite common, and they are mined globally, but China has a near-monopoly on [refining them](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-rare-earths.pdf) for use in everyday electronics, like smartphones and speakers, as well as for crucial defense systems, like fighter jets.

When China decided to tighten control over supply chains for seven rare earth elements this spring, O'Connor says he felt the pinch immediately. One investor touring the company's vault at the time offered on the spot to buy O'Connor's entire inventory of terbium and dysprosium, two valuable ""heavy"" rare earth elements, he says.

The episode illustrated the power of China's dominance over the industry.

""They're installing what you might call a tap system, where they can turn that tap on and off,"" says O'Connor, remarking on China's recent policy.

That supply chain chokehold has given China a powerful tool it has wielded in a trade war with the United States. Within weeks of China requiring foreign companies to apply for a license to buy rare earths in early April, several [U.S.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ford-ceo-china-rare-earth-shortage-car-production/) and [European](http://autonews.com/europe/ane-china-exports-tariffs-rare-earths-evs-0604/) corporations said they were forced to shut down production lines. [Regaining access](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5429236/why-rare-earth-elements-are-central-to-u-s-china-trade-talks) to Chinese rare earths was a central point of contention in U.S.-China trade [negotiations](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/10/g-s1-71676/us-china-trade-talks-london) this spring.

But China did not always enjoy such dominance. Developing an export control regime they could minutely control took decades of sometimes painful trial and error.

[The Mountain Pass rare earth mine and processing facility, owned by MP Materials, is viewed from an airplane flying at 37,000 feet on Sept. 1, 2023, in Mountain Pass, Calif.George Rose\/Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/g6myf9xfnlef1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=16e0b982634b51f0f656cfe264303f4402f10c7d)

# Spotting strategic value

For much of the second half of the 20th century, the United States controlled the market on rare earth elements, after prospectors discovered them in [Mountain Pass](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/23/949590270/the-strategic-value-of-rare-earths), Calif., [in 1949](https://mpmaterials.com/history/).

China recognized the strategic value of rare earths, and starting in the 1960s, Chinese executives visited Mountain Pass several times, says Mark Smith, who was the CEO at Molycorp, a former rare earths processing company at the Mountain Pass mine.

""We toured them. We explained what we do, allowed them to take pictures and everything else. They took it back to China,"" Smith says, who gave tours of Molycorp to Chinese visitors in the 1980s and 1990s. 

Chinese refineries then improved on technology, and taking advantage of cheap electricity in China, hundreds of lucrative mining and processing firms in the country popped up to service mostly domestic demand for rare earths.

['](https://preview.redd.it/wbalpbelnlef1.png?width=867&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb77295d51d8a88e3fde964c4e1620c230289a11)

But the industry was highly unregulated and chaotic, as hundreds of small-scale, private mines and refineries competed against one another, undercutting each other's profits.

""They drive down the price against themselves,"" says Chris Ruffle, an investor who has worked in China for decades, including in the metals industry. ""They kill themselves.""

""China's rare earths aren't being sold at a 'rare' price but at an 'earth' price,"" Xiao Yaqing, a former minister of industry, [complained](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202109/1235016.shtml) in 2021.

# A dirty business

As Chinese producers sought an upper hand in rare earths, they also unleashed unrestrained mining that came at great cost to the environment.

In the early 2000s, Ruffle visited a private rare earths refinery in Jiangsu, a province in southern China. ""The thick smoke slightly gave it away,"" Ruffle says of the facilities. He describes huge piles of tailings — toxic, metallic by-products from other industrial processes — sitting on the bare ground.

Destructive, small-scale mining was especially prevalent in southern China, where the most valuable, natural deposits of ""heavy"" rare earth elements are.

""They would mine the side of the hill with their axes and picks and shovels, and then they would dig a hole in the ground, no liners or anything like that at all. Then they poured five gallon buckets of sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid … and let that certain stew for a while,"" remembers Smith, who frequently visited China during this period. ""When the storms come in, all that acid just washes out.""

The mining left China's terrain scarred with lasting groundwater and soil pollution. Local residents staged periodic protests against rare earth mining, but the industry provided local governments with [abundant revenue](https://news.sina.com.cn/c/2011-10-21/133523341196.shtml?from=wap), and they repeatedly ignored central government orders to close down dirty mines.

A Chinese media investigation into the industry in 2012 [compared](http://jingji.cntv.cn/20120418/116762.shtml) the rare earths industry in China during this time to trafficking illegal drugs. ""There are generally two types of people who can deal with rare earths: the first is someone who has just been released from prison, and the other is someone who can get someone out of prison. Those who are not afraid of death and leading cadres are all involved,"" the state media article said.

Multiple Chinese businesses and individuals declined requests to comment for this story.

# Consolidation or bust

By the late 1990s, Beijing had had enough of the domestic price wars and local pollution. It started imposing production and export quotas to incentivize more advanced processing of rare earths. The quotas also aimed to cut down on pollution by setting caps on how much mines and refineries could produce and protected the industry from foreign intervention.

The quotas created two sets of prices, ""in effect, two-tier pricing, when exports were limited to the rest of the world that resulted in lower rare earth prices for domestic Chinese consumers,"" says Rod Eggert, a professor at the Colorado School of Mines.

There was also a second, unintended consequence to the quotas: they created a thriving smuggling industry. Up to [30% of the country's](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-019-00214-2) rare earth products in the mid-2000s was illegal, smuggled out of China despite state controls, analysts estimate, because of demand from Japan and the U.S.

Then, American and European companies cried foul over the export quotas, and in 2014, the World Trade Organization [ruled](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2014/March/US-wins-victory-in-rare-earths-dispute-with-China) China could not use them.

But China was unfazed. It was already shifting tactics. It would seek global dominance in rare earths not through controlling the volume of outputs, but instead, by controlling which firms could operate.

# A ""secret war"" to consolidate

Chinese central authorities dubbed the campaign ""one plus five"": an ambitious, and often ruthless, effort to winnow down the entire rare earth industry to just six consolidated companies.

""I saw firsthand how the private sector got squeezed out,"" says Ruffle, the investor.

Within four years, China declared victory. It announced the closure of dozens of smaller mining and refining companies and guided the mergers of surviving companies into six supersized, mostly state-owned firms, nicknamed the Big Six in China.

Through the Big Six, China could now largely control both supply and price.

""Whereas before you had a lot more competition from different producers, now you get very homogeneous pricing,"" says Jan Giese, a Frankfurt-based rare earth trader. ""It's difficult to have competitive bids.""

# American upstarts

Unlike metal commodities like nickel or gold, there is no independent exchange for buying and selling rare earth elements.

Because Chinese companies can cause huge price fluctuations depending on how much they decide to produce or export, investors have been wary of pouring money into new ventures in the U.S., say U.S. refining and mining companies.

That has made raising capital to build refining plants a big challenge for American companies trying to break back into the industry.

**""They're putting their money into things like Alphabet and, you know, Amazon and, you know, all the high-flying types of investments and just very, very little, if any, is coming into the mining industry,"" says Smith, the former CEO of Molycorp.**

**Some are still trying. Smith's new venture, NioCorp, is opening new mines and refining capacity for rare earths in** [**Nebraska**](https://www.ketv.com/article/nebraska-rare-earths-mine-drilling/64626271)**.**

Phoenix Tailings, a startup in Massachusetts, is also among a handful of U.S. companies prepared to refine rare earths, by refining the tailings, or leftover waste, from mining companies.

""We have to be full speed on the gas to make sure we're successful here,"" says Nicholas Myers, one of the co-founders and CEO.

The company already makes rare earth magnets for automotive and defense companies, and it is currently building a second plant in New Hampshire which the company says can meet about half of the U.S.' defense needs for rare earth products.

For years, Myers says his company struggled to attract investment at the magnitude needed to compete with Chinese firms in scale.

This year, things changed, after China implemented a licensing system for foreign companies which caused rare earth exports to plummet.

""Definite tone shift,"" says Myers, ""I think what happened is the end customers, the folks at the big automotive companies or defense primes, realized that they had told their bosses that China would never shut off the supply for them.""

But China did shut off that supply.

The sudden cutoff galvanized U.S. investor interest in rare earths, Myers says.

# National urgency and investor backing propel Nebraska mine forward.

Following a successful three-month equity raise that secured approximately $60.7 million in institutional funding, NioCorp Developments Ltd. is preparing to launch a series of pre-construction activities at its Elk Creek critical minerals project in Nebraska.

Found roughly 80 miles south of Omaha in southeastern Nebraska, Elk Creek is a critical minerals project by every definition of the term – home to one of the only U.S. deposits capable of producing niobium, scandium, and titanium at commercial scale, with an added potential bonus of rare earths, positioning it as a uniquely consolidated source of materials essential to America's industrial and technological base.

Colorado-based NioCorp Developments has spent more than a decade in advanced planning and technical refinement, backed by an S-K 1300-compliant initial assessment that outlines an indicated mineral resource of more than 970,000 metric tons of niobium oxide, 11,337 metric tons of scandium oxide, and over 4.2 million metric tons of titanium oxides, with an additional 632,900 metric tons of total rare earth oxides currently under evaluation for potential byproduct recovery.

Based on these figures, Elk Creek is projected to produce 7,450 metric tons of ferroniobium, 12,063 metric tons of titanium dioxide, and 104 metric tons of scandium trioxide annually over a 38-year mine life – enough niobium to manufacture roughly 2 million metric tons of high-strength steel each year, enough titanium for widespread use in aerospace and pigment industries, and enough scandium to supply alloying applications across advanced transportation and defense.

Altogether, this mine could generate more than $2.8 billion.

Buoyed by growing federal urgency to strengthen U.S. supply chains and bolstered by recent investor confidence, NioCorp is now mobilizing to transition Elk Creek from planning into execution.

Backed by roughly $60.7 million in equity financing raised over the past three months – primarily from institutional funds – the company is accelerating a suite of early-stage activities aimed at de-risking construction and shortening the runway to full-scale development.

""NioCorp is now empowered to accelerate field activities and other pre-construction work streams so that the Elk Creek project can get out of the blocks that much faster once full project financing is obtained,"" said NioCorp CEO Mark Smith. ""Early capital helps us get a jump in many different areas that in turn should help us accelerate bringing our products to market that much sooner. There is both an economic and a national defense imperative to getting strategic U.S. resources like the Elk Creek Project online as rapidly as possible.""

As part of its early site advancement, NioCorp plans to initiate a broad range of activities, including land acquisition, geomechanical and hydrogeological fieldwork, detailed engineering, infrastructure development, utility hookups, and operational permitting-each designed to streamline the transition to construction once full project financing is in place.

The company also intends to expand its owner's team to support these pre-development efforts and maintain ongoing engagement with the U.S. Export-Import Bank and other prospective lenders as it works to finalize a full funding package.

Endless founder hustle. Five months of non-stop pitching, pressure, and pushing, but the growth stalled.

So I unplugged for a week. No emails. No socials. No calls. Just space.  
And it worked. I realized:  
**Rest isn’t weakness. It’s part of the system.**

Here’s what helped me reset:  
– Reading a non-startup book. Just for joy.  
– Morning walks with coffee instead of inbox panic.  
– Texted an old friend to reconnect as a human.

The watch fell face down on the hardwood floor from about 50cm. I regularly test my watches on a timegrapher and this particular Rolex was averaging about 1.6-2 spd gain over 5 positions since I bought it in March 2023. The beat error was 0.1-0.3 ms depending on position.

I tested it after the drop and it's now +9 spd on average with the beat error way up at 0.7-1.1 ms depending on position. It's not bad enough to justify me taking it in for a service but it's pretty disappointing to be honest. I'd expect even the cheapest mechanical movements out there to survive such a minor fall with timekeeping unaffected.

By contrast, my GO PanoMaticLunar, which you'd dismiss as a fragile dress watch, was dropped twice, once from the same height as the sub and once from a shelf that is about 140cm high. Timekeeping was entirely unaffected.",1,1753269840.0,rolex,0,1.0,False

She could only text him ten times a day, and she accidentally sent one extra ""good night.""  
Every time, she ended up begging him not to go through with the divorce.  
On the 99th try, she stayed on her knees in his study the entire night. Only then did he reluctantly agree to cancel it.  
That same night, she stumbled across a paper bag inside his locked safe.  
Inside were handwritten letters Cruz had penned for her, all the way back from when she first started chasing after him.  
It turned out that he'd had feelings for her all along.  
It turned out that all those divorce threats were just ways to make her cry, to keep her begging him not to leave.  
He craved her love, but treated her devotion like a toy to pass the time.  
The next day, Cruz filed for divorce for the 100th time.  
This time, it was over a cookie. She'd eaten one in his car and left behind a few crumbs.  
Nicole looked at the guy she'd been in love with for seven years and suddenly felt like she didn't even know him anymore.  
This time, she was done playing along with him.  
She wasn't going to lower herself again as he wished.  
It was completely over between them.  
She wiped her face roughly and went back to packing her suitcase.  
But halfway through, she realized something was missing.  
Her deceased mother's old silver necklace, the only thing she had left, was gone.  
Nicole turned the whole walk-in closet upside down, even checked under the bed, but the necklace was nowhere to be found. It was like it had just vanished.  
She sank to the floor, unconsciously gripping the edge of her shirt. Besides her, the only person who had been in the study was Cruz.  
Recalling what she overheard back at the courthouse, she bit her mouth, grabbed her coat, and walked out.  
Outside the private room at the club, loud voices and laughter could be heard clearly, even through the thick door.  
""I bet five days! No way Nicole makes it past that without begging Cruz to remarry her!""  
""Five? That's generous. Everyone knows she's hopeless without him. I'm going with three.""  
""I say just one! She was on her knees the last time!""  
""Cruz, what's your guess?""  
The room suddenly got quiet. Cruz sat in the centre, slowly swirling his whiskey, his expression unreadable.  
Right before he could answer, the door burst open. Nicole stepped in and said, ""It's forever.""  
  
Chapter 2  
Right as Nicole spoke, a soft voice cut in over hers.  
""Sorry, I'm late.""  
Angela Simpson strolled in, instantly drawing everyone's attention.  
With a sweet smile, she clung to Cruz's arm and leaned into him affectionately.  
Nicole looked at their intimate posture and tremblingly closed her eyes.  
Angela had been around since Cruz was a kid. From when he first started dating to his marriage to Nicole, Angela never left their lives.  
He never told her to back off. He even let her cross the line repeatedly, like it was nothing.  
Nicole used to wonder if Cruz had real feelings for Angela.  
But after reading those love letters, it finally clicked.  
Angela was just a way to make Nicole jealous.  
Cruz enjoyed seeing her jealousy.  
That was when he noticed Nicole standing at the door and frowned. ""Why are you here?""  
Nicole gripped the strap of her bag and realized he hadn't even heard her words.  
""My necklace is missing,"" she said, locking eyes with him. ""I just want to know if you've seen it.""  
Cruz froze for a second, then his mood shifted. ""That's it?""  
""What else would it be?"" Nicole asked, ""What do you think I'm here for?""  
His expression instantly darkened.  
Nicole was familiar with that expression.  
He always made it whenever she didn't play along with whatever version of the story he'd made up in his mind.  
""That silver necklace?"" Angela suddenly interrupted, ""I told Cruz I liked it, so he gave it to me.""  
She tilted her head like she was being innocent. ""But I lost it on the way home.""  
Nicole's head started spinning as she snapped, ""You gave her my necklace?!""  
""It's just a necklace,"" Cruz cut in coldly. ""Why are you getting so worked up? I'll purchase you ten more if you want.""  
""That's my mom's keepsake!"" Nicole shouted, her voice shaking.  
The whole room went dead silent.  
Cruz looked taken aback at first, but he quickly went back to his usual indifferent look. ""It's already gone. What do you expect me to do? Don't make a fuss.""  
Nicole bit her mouth so hard they started to bleed.  
She'd told him it was her mother's keepsake, and he still thought she was just overreacting.  
Did he like her in this way?  
Realizing she'd never see that necklace again, she turned around and walked away. If she stayed any longer, she might break down right there.  
Behind her, a chair scraped across the floor. Cruz got up. ""That's enough. Let's head out.""  
He came after her.  
Outside the club, the wind cut against Nicole's face like tiny blades.  
She kept her head down and moved fast, not wanting anyone to notice her red, puffy eyes.  
Then, she heard a strange creaking sound above.  
Before she could look up, someone behind her yelled, ""Watch out!""  
Nicole's eyes shot up. A giant billboard was crashing down toward them.  
Cruz dashed toward her without hesitation.  
But when their eyes met, he swerved at the last second and threw himself over Angela instead.  
Bang!  
Pain exploded through her body, and all Nicole could feel was how pathetic she was.  
He'd rather let her get hurt than let anyone see he might care.  
When she finally came to, all she saw was a plain white ceiling.  
Nicole slowly turned her head, but the ward was empty.  
""You're awake,"" a nurse said as she walked in to change her bandages. ""You've been out for two days. Good thing it was just a minor concussion.""  
Nicole's throat burned. ""Who brought me in?""  
""Your husband,"" the nurse replied while adjusting the IV. ""He was freaking out. You were covered in blood, and he looked like he was gonna lose it. But as soon as the doctor said you'd be okay, he rushed off. He said he had something urgent. Strange, right?""  
Nicole shut her eyes and gave a tired, bitter smile.  
She wasn't shocked at all.  
He'd never let her see how he truly felt.  
  
Chapter 3  
Cruz didn't show up for a few days.  
It wasn't until Nicole was getting discharged that he finally showed his face again.  
Angela was with him, smiling as she clung to his arm.  
""Wow, Nicole, you bounced back fast. I've been sickly since I was a child. I only caught a little cold, but Cruz freaked out,"" Angela said in a sweet voice. ""He dragged me here for a checkup.""  
Nicole kept folding her clothes, not even glancing up.  
Cruz couldn't stop staring, like he was trying to read her face.  
Then out of nowhere, he said, ""Good timing. We can give you a ride back. Angela's place is getting redone, so she's gonna stay with us for a while.""  
Nicole zipped her suitcase and said, ""Whatever.""  
It didn't matter. Once the month-long waiting period ended, they'd be done for good.  
Cruz could let whoever he wanted move in. It was none of her business.  
Her lack of reaction seemed to darken his mood.  
When they got back to the villa, he acted like he was mad, being all lovey-dovey with Angela right in front of Nicole.  
But no matter what tricks he tried, she just didn't care.  
At dinner, Cruz peeled shrimp and hand-fed Angela.  
Nicole kept eating, but it all tasted bland and dry, like chewing paper.  
""Ah!"" Angela yelped, scratching at her skin. ""It itches!""  
Nicole looked up and noticed a red rash spreading across Angela's neck. Her breathing was also getting worse.  
Cruz rushed over and scooped her up. ""Call the doctor!""  
The doctor came fast and said it was a peanut allergy.  
Cruz glared and called over the maid, voice cold. ""I told you many times that Angela can't have peanuts! Why was there peanut butter in the food?""  
The maid looked down, fidgeting with her apron and stealing a glance at Nicole. ""Mrs. Yarbrough told me to. I'm sorry, Mr. Yarbrough. I'm just the maid.""  
Nicole stood up in shock. The chair scraped loudly on the floor. ""When did I ever—""  
""Please, Mrs. Yarbrough, stop making excuses!"" the maid suddenly yelled, cutting her off. ""You told me you didn't want Ms. Simpson here, and you were jealous of Mr. Yarbrough's attention. You told me to teach her a lesson.""  
""Nicole.""  
Cruz's voice was sharp, and the dining room felt like it dropped ten degrees.  
He walked toward her, his shoes clicking hard on the marble floor.  
""You've been quiet since the courthouse. I figured you'd learned your lesson."" He stared down at her, like he could see straight through her. ""Guess I was wrong.""  
Nicole was about to respond, but she suddenly froze.  
She caught a tiny smirk at the corner of Cruz's mouth. It was quick, but it was there.  
""Since you want Angela to suffer..."" Cruz said as he turned and pulled a heavy bottle of liquor from the wine shelf. The bottle hit the table with a sharp clink. ""Then it's only fair you get a taste too.""  
Nicole's whole body went numb as her back pressed against the icy wall.  
He had always known she had reaction to spirits.  
Two guards stepped up and grabbed her by the shoulders, squeezing hard enough to make her flinch in pain.  
When the spirit slid down her throat, it felt like fire spreading from her mouth to her stomach.  
She coughed violently, her eyes filling with tears, yet somehow, she still ended up swallowing half the bottle.  
That horrible itching started immediately, rising from deep under her skin.  
Large red rashes started spreading across her neck and arms. Breathing got harder by the second, and her vision started to fade.  
Right before everything went black, Nicole caught one last image—Cruz standing there in the glow, wearing a faint smile.  
He was actually smiling.  
When she came to, the bedroom was dim, lit only by a soft wall lamp.  
Cruz was sitting on the bed, flipping through some documents. He didn't even glance up until he heard her move.  
""Oh, you're awake."" He shut the folder and spoke. ""Don't do that again.""  
Nicole tried to sit up. Her throat felt raw and sore.  
She saw Cruz's relieved expression, and something clicked. Her heart tightened.  
It didn't matter to him if Angela had an allergy or not.  
What bothered him was her acting cold lately, and what made him happy was seeing her get jealous.  
It was just like those letters he kept locked up. He got a kick out of watching her lose control over him.  
Unfortunately, she was done playing that game.  
There were two more weeks to go.  
After that, they'd officially divorce and go their separate ways.  
  
Chapter 4  
Angela's design won first prize two days later.  
Cruz went all out and threw a fancy party to celebrate.  
He stayed close to her the whole night under the shiny lights, stepping in when people offered drinks and even fixing her dress for her. He acted sweet and thoughtful.  
People whispered all around, saying how Cruz treated his childhood friend well, but he couldn't care less about his wife. They said if Nicole hadn't kept trying to save the relationship, their marriage would've ended long ago.  
Nicole stood alone, swirling her drink and ignoring the whispers.  
Midway through the event, she stepped out to the lake for some air.  
The cool wind helped clear out the smell of spirits.  
""You finally hit your limit, huh?""  
Angela's voice rang out behind Nicole, dripping with smugness.  
She strutted over in heels, smiling sarcastically. ""If I were you, I would've walked away a long time ago.""  
Nicole didn't even turn around. ""Get lost.""  
Angela sneered. ""Don't act like you don't care. You've chased Cruz for four years, been married three, and he still doesn't care about you. It's honestly sad. Want to bet? Even if I shoved you in the lake, he wouldn't even blink.""  
As the words fell, Nicole felt a hard shove.  
Splash!  
Freezing water rushed over her face. She tried to scream, but water filled her mouth and nose.  
Through her fading vision, she saw someone sprint toward her and dive in.  
""Nicole!""  
Cruz sounded more panicked than ever. He rushed through the water, holding her tightly around the waist.  
Nicole looked into his eyes and got lost for a second. He looked so fearful that it almost didn't feel real.  
On the shore, Angela just stood there, frozen in disbelief. She couldn't believe what she was seeing.  
Cruz, who usually treated Nicole like she didn't matter, had dived into the lake crazily.  
The way he held onto her was like he was afraid of losing something precious.  
Angela couldn't wrap her head around it.  
She thought she must have seen it wrong.  
Once they were back on land, Cruz dropped to the ground and started giving Nicole CPR. His fingers were visibly shaking. He didn't relax until she coughed up water.  
Then suddenly, his face changed. It was like he caught himself feeling too much.  
He stood up straight, shoved his emotions aside, and spoke coldly, ""How do you even end up falling in at a party?""  
Nicole sat there, drenched. She gripped the fabric of her dress tightly, and her voice came out sharp. ""I didn't fall. Angela pushed me.""  
Angela's eyes instantly turned red. She shook her head hard. ""Nicole, I didn't do that! How could you slander me?""  
""Fine."" Nicole sneered. With shaky hands, she pulled out her phone. ""If you're not gonna admit it, let's have the police solve it. You tried to end me—there's a price for that.""  
Just as she went to call, Cruz grabbed her wrist.  
""That's enough,"" he whispered, gripping so hard it hurt. ""Angela didn't mean to. Don't blow this up.""  
Nicole abruptly looked up in disbelief. ""She almost drowned me.""  
""And yet, you're still alive, aren't you?"" he said more firmly, squinting. ""Stop creating drama.""  
It was so absurd that it almost made her laugh.  
She knew Cruz was just using Angela to get a reaction out of her.  
But she didn't expect he'd go so far as to ignore her life.  
""I'm not being dramatic,"" she said, voice steady, pressing her thumb toward the call button. ""I'm calling the cops.""  
""Enough!"" Cruz snapped, yanking the phone away. ""You're not thinking straight. Go cool off.""  
Then, he called over a bodyguard. ""Put her in the confinement room. She can come out once she's calmed down.""  
Nicole fought hard as the bodyguard pulled her toward the confinement room.  
""Cruz! Have you lost your mind?!"" she screamed, voice cracking. ""She tried to end me! You know it!""  
Her nails dug into the bodyguard's arm, leaving bloody marks. Her heels slipped off in the scuffle.  
But he was too strong. She was like a butterfly trapped in someone's fingers. No matter how hard she tried, it didn't work.  
The door slammed shut behind her, and her eyes abruptly contracted.  
The tiny room of less than three square meters had no windows. Darkness poured in like a flood and swallowed her whole.  
""Let me out..."" Her voice shook as it left her mouth.  
Something invisible was tightening around her neck—claustrophobia hitting hard.  
Her mind flashed back to when she was ten. She was locked in a basement for three days by her stepmother.  
That same despair—like the whole world had turned its back on her—hit her again after all these years.  
Nicole sat huddled in the corner, her fingernails digging painfully into her palms.  
She could hear a mouse scurrying somewhere in the dark. Clamping her mouth shut, she didn't even dare to breathe too loudly.  
Time stopped making sense. Maybe it was an hour; maybe a day.  
She pushed away the food they gave her and knocked over the glass of water.  
Her throat burned like it was on fire, but it was the mental torment that broke her down, not the thirst.  
When the door finally opened the next day, the sudden brightness made her squeeze her eyes shut.  
""Still holding on to that?"" Cruz's voice came from above.  
She barely lifted her head and saw him standing there against the light.  
He still had on that same spotless suit, not even a wrinkle on the cuffs, while she looked disheveled and unkempt like a mad woman.  
Out of nowhere, Nicole let out a laugh, and tears streamed down her face. ""I won't hold on to that anymore...""  
Her voice was barely there. ""I don't want anything anymore.""  
All she wanted now was to be released—get away from Cruz, from Angela, and from this place that was tearing her apart.  
Cruz frowned when he saw how off she seemed. Something about it made him uneasy.  
Still, his face quickly went back to being indifferent. ""Hope you stick to that.""  
He turned around and walked away, not noticing the resolute look in her eyes.  
  
Chapter 5  
Nicole stumbled back into the room, collapsed face-down on the bed, and buried herself in the blankets.  
She thought the tears had dried up, but they still slipped out and soaked the pillow.  
She curled up tightly like a shrimp, even breathing hurt.  
She stayed like that, dazed, until the next day. Eventually, she got up, ate something without tasting it, and drank some water.  
Then her phone buzzed. It was a message in her old university group chat.  
""Class reunion tonight at seven at the Crown Hotel! Hope to see everyone there!""  
Nicole stared blankly at the screen.  
Since she'd be leaving soon anyway, it would be the last time she'd see any of them. She might as well treat it as a goodbye.  
The Crown Hotel was all lit up and glowing. Nicole lightly covered her swollen eyes with some makeup and picked out a plain white dress.  
""Nicole!"" Yvonne Lawrence, her university roommate, waved her over. ""This way!""  
A group of old classmates sat around, asking how she'd been.  
Yvonne winked and said, ""You chased after Cruz back then. Did you ever get him?""  
A few others looked over, clearly curious.  
Nicole's fingers paused mid-movement.  
Back then, everyone knew she was chasing after Cruz. But he didn't agree to be with her until after graduation, so barely anyone knew they were together.  
And Cruz had always hated the idea of a wedding. He never even gave her one.  
""I didn't,"" she said, smiling faintly.  
If she had the chance to start over, she'd never want to meet him at all.  
""No way! He didn't even go for someone as pretty as you?"" someone blurted. ""He must have crazy high standards!""  
""Don't be sad,"" Yvonne said, already pulling out her phone. ""I know a few great guys I can set you up with!""  
""What are you matchmaking for?""  
A cold, deep voice spoke from behind.  
Nicole froze and turned to see Cruz and Angela standing a short distance away.  
Cruz wore a sharp black suit, and the diamond pin on his tie caught the light.  
""Cruz?!"" the group gasped.  
Angela clung to his arm, glowing in a stunning red dress.  
Their entrance immediately stole all the attention in the room.  
""Is this... your girlfriend?"" someone asked.  
Angela gave a shy smile, and Cruz didn't say a word.  
The room quickly filled with excited chatter.  
""As expected! The most popular guy in school should end up with a gorgeous girl. They're a perfect match!""  
Nicole quietly sipped her water, acting like she didn't hear any of it.  
Cruz's eyes were locked on her, sharp as blades.  
The vibe picked back up. People broke into smaller groups, swapping stories and memories.  
Then, someone suggested playing truth or dare. After a few spins, the bottle pointed straight at Angela.  
""I choose to dare!"" she said sweetly, sneaking a glance at Cruz.  
""Kiss a guy here for ten seconds!""  
As soon as the dare was announced, the room erupted in playful booing.  
Angela blushed as she nervously played with the edge of her dress, but she still walked straight over to Cruz.  
He sat back lazily on the couch, but his eyes drifted past everyone and landed on Nicole, who was quietly scrolling on her phone.  
She didn't even flinch.  
His gaze turned icy.  
""Cruz..."" Angela stood right in front of him, shyly biting her mouth.  
Everyone watched as Cruz suddenly pulled her in and kissed her hard.  
""Wow—""  
The crowd exploded.  
The kiss went way past ten seconds. Cruz even made sure it sounded intense.  
Nicole finally glanced up, but she just gave him a calm look before turning back to her screen.  
His expression instantly darkened.  
  
Chapter 6  
After that, Cruz became even more affectionate with Angela.  
He fed her, hugged her waist, and whispered in her ear.  
But now and then, his gaze would unconsciously drift back to Nicole.  
She didn't even flinch.  
Once the party ended, Nicole headed to the restroom to fix her makeup.  
Just as she stepped out, Angela appeared at the corridor corner and blocked her way.  
""Did you see this?"" Angela waved her phone with a smug grin. The screen showed a photo of her and Cruz kissing. ""Cruz is into me. So do yourself a favor and sign those divorce papers. Don't embarrass yourself by begging this time.""  
Nicole didn't even spare Angela a glance. She walked past her without a word.  
Angela's face twisted in anger. She'd planned the whole thing, and now it felt like a complete joke.  
She clenched her jaw, ready to slap Nicole. But then, she heard familiar footsteps coming down the corridor.  
Changing her mind, she immediately switched tactics.  
The sound of slaps echoed through the restroom. Angela slapped herself hard twice. Her cheeks turned red and swollen within seconds.  
Right after, the door flew open.  
""Cruz!"" she cried, bursting into tears and running straight into his arms. ""Nicole hit me...""  
She complained through sobs, ""All because I was just playing around with you earlier...""  
Cruz held Angela, but his eyes locked on Nicole.  
He had been wondering why Nicole seemed so unaffected by his and Angela's intimacy all night. Now it made sense.  
She was secretly jealous.  
That thought made something stir inside him, like he was secretly satisfied. But his face stayed cold.  
""It was just a game. Why get so worked up?"" he said icily. ""And besides, we're divorced now. What I do is none of your business.""  
He stared at Nicole's pale face. ""Hurting Angela won't help. If you want another shot at us, show your sincerity.""  
""I didn't hit her,"" Nicole replied calmly. ""She was the one who—""  
""Enough!"" Cruz snapped. ""If you're going to play these little games, then reflect on yourself here tonight.""  
Bang!  
He slammed the door shut. The loud click of the lock followed.  
Nicole pounded on the door, her palms turning red and numb from the force.  
After a long time, she finally heard the lock click open.  
She breathed a sigh of relief, ready to leave. But before she could go far, three men stepped out from the shadows and cornered her.  
The leader yanked her hair and asked viciously, ""Are you Nicole?""  
""No, I'm not,"" she said quickly, sensing danger. She tried to bolt, but a punch slammed into her stomach.  
The pain doubled her over. Before she could catch her breath, someone else yanked her up by the hair.  
A harsh slap made her ears ring, and blood trickled from the corner of her mouth.  
""You've got a face, sure, but no shame, huh?"" The leader grabbed her chin and smacked her face frivolously with his other hand. ""We'll teach you a lesson today!""  
They started beating her without mercy.  
Nicole dropped to the ground, curling up and trying to shield her head.  
She heard something snap in her ribs. The pain was blinding, but she clamped her mouth shut, refusing to make a sound.  
""Hey, that's enough. Don't end her,"" one of them finally said. ""Ms. Simpson just wanted her roughed up.""  
Their footsteps faded, leaving her crumpled on the cold ground. Her whole body screamed in pain.  
Nicole tried to wiggle her fingers, but even that made her break into a cold sweat.  
Then, she heard Angela's mocking laugh echo down the corridor. ""Let's see if she keeps acting all high and mighty now.""  
Nicole struggled to turn over and stared up at the harsh, blinding ceiling lights.  
A single drop of blood slid down her forehead. Yet somehow, she smiled.  
So this was what Cruz wanted?  
He might've had feelings for her. But deep down, he wanted her wrecked, crushed, and stuck in a life that felt worse than dying.  
He got what he wanted.  
But it'd be the last time.  
  
Chapter 7  
Nicole barely made it through the door, her body aching all over. From upstairs, she heard Angela's sweet voice floating down.  
""Cruz, there's thunder tonight. Can you stay with me until I fall asleep?""  
Gripping the railing tightly, Nicole climbed the stairs, her body screaming with pain. Cold sweat beaded on her forehead with every step.  
Cruz was about to refuse. But when he saw Nicole, he changed his mind. ""Sure.""  
He slipped his arm around Angela and led her into the main bedroom like Nicole didn't even exist.  
Nicole smiled bitterly and dragged herself into the guest room without a word.  
Over the next few days, she stayed home and focused all her energy on a design competition.  
It was the path she wanted to reclaim once the divorce was finalized.  
Back in college, Nicole had been the top student in her department. Her instructor, Beatrice Anderson, once said she would shape the future of the design world.  
But that dream came crashing down after Cruz saw a coworker drop her off one day.  
""Quit your job or end the marriage,"" he said coldly.  
Without arguing, she resigned. Now, she was finally sketching again.  
As she was adjusting the final touches on her design, the door suddenly opened.  
Cruz came in with Angela. The moment he noticed the sketches, his expression darkened.  
""I told you I don't want you doing this stuff,"" he said, grabbing her paintbrush. ""If you're hoping I'll reconsider the divorce, then stop right here.""  
Nicole looked at him and almost laughed.  
Did he still think threats would work on her?  
She didn't say a word—just calmly packed up her drawings.  
Cruz thought she had given in and walked out, looking satisfied.  
Angela, though, paused for a moment, her eyes lingering on the draft with visible interest.  
Three days after she submitted her design draft, Nicole got a call from the organizer.  
Ms. Quinn, your work may be plagiarized. If you can't prove it yourself, we'll have to disqualify you.""  
""What?"" Nicole was shocked. ""Who did I supposedly copy?""  
""The piece matches a submission from Angela. She's a trending designer right now. Honestly, it's more likely the issue is on your end.""  
Right away, Nicole remembered the way Angela had stared at her sketches earlier.  
""I have the original,"" she said quickly.  
But after hanging up, she searched everywhere. The manuscript was gone.  
""Looking for this?""  
Nicole spun around. Angela stood there, holding the manuscript.  
""How did you get that?"" Nicole asked.  
Angela gave a smug smile and twirled the manuscript. ""I said I liked it, and Cruz gave it to me.""  
She leaned in and whispered, ""Cruz is into me. Just face the truth and stop dreaming about getting back with him. It's better for everyone if you let go now.""  
Nicole's mind went blank. She stormed off to find Cruz, but he didn't even blink. ""I told you before—I don't like you doing this kind of stuff. If you'd listened and stopped, none of this would've happened.""  
She stared at the man she had loved for seven years, her heart feeling like it was being cut open.  
Why was he always like that?  
He never cared about what she liked and never once considered how she felt.  
If it weren't for those letters, she would've thought he never had feelings for her at all.  
Nicole realized the original draft was gone, and arguing about it now wouldn't change anything. Everyone already saw her as a plagiarist.  
She returned to her room in a daze and shut herself in the darkness.  
It wasn't until her phone suddenly rang that she snapped out of her daze.  
""Nicole! Are you coming back into the design world?"" Beatrice's voice rang with excitement. ""I saw your work at the competition!""  
Nicole's voice cracked. ""Ms. Anderson, I didn't copy anyone...""  
""I believe you,"" Beatrice replied right away. ""No one out there matches your talent. I've always known that.""  
She sighed. ""It's such a waste you gave it all up because of Cruz.""  
""I was dumb back then,"" Nicole admitted, brushing away tears. ""But I've already filed for divorce. I'm ready to start fresh.""  
""That's great!"" Beatrice cheered. ""Wanna join my studio in Paris? All your seniors are there, and things are going great. If you come, we'll turn you into the brightest star in design!""  
""Can I?""  
""Of course! Who knows your talent better than me?"" Beatrice pretended to be angry. ""If you hadn't suddenly quit back then...""  
Nicole took a deep breath. ""Okay, I'll go. I'll leave once the divorce goes through.""  
Right after she said that, the door burst open. Cruz stood in the doorway, his expression dark and unreadable.  
""Where do you want to go?""  
  
Chapter 8  
Nicole hung up quickly and forced herself to stay calm. ""You probably misheard.""  
Cruz squinted at her, clearly suspicious, but he didn't push it.  
Instead, he said, ""You and Angela have been tense lately because of the design stuff. I'll take you both to the amusement park tomorrow. It'll help you relax.""  
Nicole wanted to say no right away, but she stopped herself.  
She remembered how she used to beg him to go to amusement parks, and he always called them childish.  
If she turned him down now, it might look weird.  
""Alright,"" she responded softly.  
The amusement park was packed with people.  
Cruz stayed close to Angela, buckling her into the roller coaster, helping her onto the carousel, and even feeding her ice cream.  
Nicole trailed behind like she wasn't even there.  
Then, Cruz got a call from the company and stepped aside to take it. Angela suddenly grabbed Nicole's wrist. ""Let's try bungee jumping!""  
Nicole instinctively pulled her hand back. ""I'm not going.""  
""Cruz said we should get along,"" Angela whispered, stepping closer. ""Still mad about the design thing? You really hold grudges.""  
People around them started staring curiously.  
Nicole pursed her mouth, not wanting a scene. She gave in and followed Angela onto the ride.  
Click!  
The safety bar came down. Angela leaned close again. ""Oh, by the way, Cruz promised me a trip to the Maldives after the divorce goes through—""  
Before she could finish, the ride went back violently.  
""Ah!""  
As soon as the seatbelt snapped, Nicole felt her body go weightless.  
She and Angela plummeted from over ten meters high.  
The air roared past her ears, and Nicole shut her eyes, bracing for the worst.  
But the pain never came. Instead, she landed in a warm embrace.  
When she opened her eyes, Cruz's panicked face was right there.  
He held her tightly, his breathing ragged.  
""You...""  
She barely got the word out before Cruz quickly pulled away like he'd touched something hot.  
""I grabbed the wrong person,"" he muttered awkwardly, then rushed over to Angela, who lay on the ground. ""Angela!""  
  
\---  
At the hospital, a doctor hurried up. ""She's losing a lot of blood and needs an urgent transfusion! The blood type is RH negative. The supply is low!""  
Cruz immediately looked straight at Nicole.  
""You're RH negative too."" That wasn't a question, but a statement.  
Nicole leaned on the wall, her knee still bleeding. She met Cruz's eyes and suddenly understood what he wanted.  
""Give blood,"" he said, stepping in close and whispering, ""If you do, I'll take back the divorce.""  
His breath brushed past her ear. It smelled cold and familiar.  
There was a time when being that close would've made her heart flutter.  
Now, all it did was make her feel empty.  
When the nurse handed over the consent form, Nicole signed it right away.  
She couldn't let Cruz start suspecting anything—not when she had plans to leave for Paris.  
She had to play it safe.  
As the needle went in, she turned her head away, watching the blood slowly drip into the bag.  
One bag filled, then another.  
""Stop right there!"" the nurse suddenly called out. ""She's already at her limit!""  
Nicole's vision blurred, and her ears rang.  
Everything felt hazy. She saw Cruz standing nearby, frowning. His mouth was moving, but she couldn't hear a word.  
Chapter 9  
The white walls of the hospital hurt my eyes.  
After Nicole had finished the blood transfusion, the doctor insisted that she stay in the hospital for observation. However, Cruz never came to see her once.  
The phone kept vibrating, it was a photo sent by Angela.  
The photo of Cruz feeding her porridge.  
A photo of Cruz standing by the sickbed.  
When Cruz was asleep, she stole a photo of him kissing his cheek.  
Nicole deleted one by one, her heart no longer wavering.  
When the heart dies completely, even the sense of pain will disappear.  
On the last day of the waiting period, Nicole woke up early.  
The sunlight streamed in through the curtains as she packed the last piece of clothing into her suitcase.  
The plane tickets to Paris lay quietly in the bag, for the flight at three in the afternoon.  
At that moment, the doorbell suddenly rang.  
Cruz stood at the doorway, dressed sharply in a suit, as if he had just returned from an important meeting.  
""Angela is out of danger,"" he cut to the chase. ""I promised to accompany you to withdraw the application, and I will keep my word.""  
Nicole quietly watched him.  
""However,"" Cruz added, ""if you make the same mistake again next time, I will still bring up divorce.""  
Nicole suddenly felt like laughing.  
There will be no next time.  
She was about to embark on her own journey of life.  
Along the way, the two of them remained silent.  
Nicole tightened her grip on the bag strap until the car stopped in front of the courthouse.  
""We're here,"" Cruz unbuckled his seatbelt, ""Hurry up, I still need to go to the hospital to see Angela.""  
Nicole looked at the familiar glass doors of the courthouse, absentmindedly running her fingertips along the edge of her phone.  
She needed to find a way to distract Cruz and make sure he didn't follow them inside.  
""I...""  
Just as he started speaking, Cruz's phone began to ring.  
""Angela?"" he frowned as he picked up the phone, ""What's wrong? Don't cry, I'll be right over.""  
Hanging up the phone, Cruz turned to Nicole and said, ""Angela is feeling unstable, I need to go over there first. You go in and cancel the application yourself, and let me know when it's done.""  
Nicole lowered her eyelashes, hiding the relief in her eyes: ""Okay.""  
She watched as Cruz's car sped away, then turned and walked into the courthouse.  
The familiar clerk greeted with a smile, ""Ms. Quinn, coming to withdraw your application again?""  
""No,"" Nicole took out the prepared documents from her bag, ""I came to pick up the Divorce Certificate today.""  
When she got home, Nicole placed the Divorce Certificate belonging to Cruz on the coffee table and picked up the already packed suitcase.  
The closing sound of the door was very soft, but it felt like a knife, completely cutting off seven years of infatuation.  
On the way to the airport, the sun was shining brightly.  
Nicole rolled down the car window, closed her eyes slowly, and felt the taste of happy in the air.  
Goodbye, Cruz.  
This time, I really didn't want you anymore.",1,1753269718.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
1m76l23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVoyager/comments/1m76l23/how_long_does_it_take_to_circle_oahu/,How long does it take to circle Oahu?,"Just got back from an incredible trip around Oahu, and I wanted to share my experience about circling the island. I've done it multiple ways, but I'll tell you what I found works best.

The complete circle around Oahu is roughly 112 miles on the main highways. If you were to drive straight through without stops, it would take about 4 hours. But here's the thing - you really don't want to do that. The whole point of circling Oahu is to experience everything the island has to offer.

During my latest trip, I took a Circle Island Tour with Waimea Waterfall, and it was honestly the best decision. The tour takes about 8 hours, which is the perfect amount of time to see all the major spots without feeling rushed. You can book it here: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island

What made this particular tour stand out was how well-organized everything was. Our guide knew exactly when to hit each spot to avoid the worst crowds. We started early (around 7 AM) from Waikiki, which meant we got to see Diamond Head before it got too hot.

The tour hits all the must-see spots:
- Diamond Head lookout (amazing coastal views)
- Halona Blowhole (nature's geyser - pretty impressive)
- North Shore beaches
- Waimea Valley and Waterfall (you can actually swim here)
- Dole Plantation

One thing I really appreciated was the local insight from our guide. You know those hidden photo spots and local stories you can't find on Google? That's what makes a guided tour worth it. Plus, they handle all the driving, so you can actually enjoy the scenery instead of navigating unfamiliar roads.

If you're considering doing it yourself, keep in mind that parking at popular spots can be a nightmare, and some areas like the Pali Lookout have entrance fees. The tour includes all these costs, plus you get extras like coffee tastings and macadamia nut sampling at Tropical Farms.

The North Shore stop was perfect for lunch - try the garlic shrimp trucks if you can. Just bring cash for food and maybe some extra for souvenirs.

A few practical tips if you book the tour:
- Wear comfortable shoes
- Bring a swimsuit (the waterfall swim is refreshing)
- Don't forget your camera
- Pack a light jacket (it can get windy at some lookouts)

I've tried rental cars and other tours before, but this format really works best for seeing the whole island. The 8-hour duration hits that sweet spot - enough time to see everything without getting exhausted.

My final take: If you want to circle Oahu properly, set aside a full day. Whether you self-drive or take a tour, rushing it would mean missing out on what makes the island special. Personally, I recommend the guided tour route - it's more relaxing and you actually learn about what you're seeing.

For anyone interested in booking the same tour I took, you can check availability and prices here: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island. They offer free cancellation up to 24 hours before, which is pretty convenient if your plans change.",1,1753269706.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

In Daxia, the only thing harder than living incognito is getting your spouse, in-laws, and everyone else to believe you’re actually the king of three hidden empires. The pattern is universal: you build their multi-billion deals, clean their toilets, save their cat, endure their ridicule, and when you finally proclaim your power, you’re met with, “Nice cosplay, buddy.”

That is, until the inheritance papers are dropped along with the keys to the four bankrupt families’ old mansions. At which point, everyone very belatedly starts buying humble fried rice.

1m76kj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive_islam/comments/1m76kj1/islam_and_ocd/,Islam and OCD?,"Now OCD (even with religious themes) is present in everyone, even those who are atheist. 

But I’m wondering when or why ocd behaviors became synonymous with fearing God or piety?

Before I found Islam (and even earlier into reverting before finding salafi mindset and diving too deep into Hadiths) I was very happy with God and Islam and yes I sinned but I didn’t constantly fear hell. 

Now it’s 24/7 to the point that even drinking a cup of coffee will bring on anxiety levels I’ve never before seen. 

I’ve spoken to imams and even when I vent on r/ocd there’s always one Muslim who says the exact same thing - that it’s piety and a fear of God just misplaced due to my nafs. 

Is there a historical reason why mainstream / majority of Muslims truly believe we have to spend every waking moment fearing hell and counting tasbih a certain amount of times to ensure we have enough good deeds to outweigh our bad deeds or triple doing our wudu just in case it’s slightly imperfect and God won’t accept it? 

Now granted the avg Muslim especially in this sub will tell me honestly that no, this isn’t what Gods intended and this is waswas and should be treated. 

But even with treatment, when the majority of Muslims treat this as a gold standard of living - it just begs the question as to why? 

Obviously God doesn’t want us to just live without thinking about tomorrow or our actions, but I can’t imagine He wants this level of fear?

I know epoxy is basically a two-part resin that hardens into a really durable, glass-like finish, and you can use it for floors, tables, sealing concrete, and I've seen ppl do art projects with it. I'll leave this [what is epoxy flooring](https://gliepoxyflooring.com/faq/) article if you need it, that's where I got most of my tips from.

And I also watched enough videos to get the basic process: mix part A and B, pour, spread, and let it cure. But what I don't know is - HOW SAFE is it to actually use indoors?

Some people say the fumes can be strong and you need major ventilation, but many others (on Reddit as well) act like it's no big deal if you just open a window. I've also seen ""low-VOC"" or ""no-VOC"" epoxy products online, so that raises some questions. The countertop I want to do is in my kitchen, and I don't want the whole house smelling like chemicals for days.

So if you've worked with it, is epoxy something a regular person can safely work with indoors? If you're careful? Or is it mostly used outside/in garages for a reason?",1,1753269507.0,HomeImprovement,1,1.0,False

1m76h6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contemporary_Romance/comments/1m76h6j/its_forever/,It’s Forever,"Nicole Quinn and Cruz Yarbrough had filed for divorce 99 times.

Each time, Cruz would quietly wait for her to cave in during the waiting period, knowing she'd come crawling back. She would coax him, and only then would he agree to cancel the paperwork.

At the 100th filing, as Nicole stood up to leave, a staff member behind the desk asked curiously, ""So, when are you coming back to cancel it this time?""

Nicole glanced at Cruz's cold figure walking away and told herself inwardly.

Would not cancel this time.

When the 30-day waiting period ended, it would finally be official.

The wind outside the courthouse was biting. Nicole stepped out and watched Cruz slip into his sleek black car without even glancing back at her.

She walked slowly along the sidewalk. It felt like something inside her had been ripped open, and the cold air just poured in.

Suddenly, screeching tires rang out behind her.

Before she could react, she was shoved to the ground. Her knees throbbed, and her palms burned.

Looking up through messy hair, she saw Cruz's friends scrambling out of the car.

""Crap! We just hit Mrs. Yarbrough!""

""Stop calling her that,"" someone muttered. ""They're getting divorced. Cruz hasn't agreed to cancel it yet.""

Nicole tried to stand, her legs trembling. Through her messy bangs, she saw the rear window of the car rolled halfway down. Cruz's cold profile was just barely visible in the shadows.

One of the guys asked, ""Should we take her to the hospital first, or just head to the party?""

Time froze for a moment. Nicole stared at that car window, her heart aching.

""To the party."" Cruz's cold voice came through the car window.

Those simple words cut deeper than a knife.

The car sped off, the exhaust fumes hitting her face.

Gritting her teeth, Nicole pulled herself up and limped all the way home.

Every step made her knees scream, but that was nothing compared to the way her heart felt—shredded and raw.

As soon as she got home, she started packing.

She pulled out everything that reminded her of their years together.

The jewelry he casually threw to her, the lighter he used that she secretly kept, the jar of 999 paper stars she folded for him...

One by one, she tossed them all in the trash. Then, she pulled out a paper bag from the deepest part of the drawer.

Her hands shook as she opened it again, even though she'd seen what was inside.

They were Cruz's love letters.

""You brought breakfast again today. But you didn't know I got up at five just to watch you quietly set it by my window.

""Your handwriting in those letters is terrible, but I kept them. I'll tease you about them on our 50th anniversary.

""That red dress looked good, but I wish no one else could see you in it.

""You've been chasing me for three years. I almost gave in. But I wanted to hold out a bit longer and enjoy being pursued.""

Every line felt like a punch to the heart.

If she hadn't randomly found those love letters a few days earlier, she never would've believed that Cruz, who'd always acted cold and distant, actually liked her.

The first time Nicole saw Cruz was during their university's opening ceremony.

He was speaking onstage as the student rep, looking sharp and untouchable.

With just a glance, she fell in love.

Many people pursued Cruz, but Nicole was the most stubborn one.

She kept bringing him breakfast, even though he never touched it. She memorized all his classes just to run into him. When he got hurt playing basketball, she climbed over the wall to get him medicine and ended up breaking her wrist for it.

She spent four years and 1,460 days chasing after him until they finally got together.

Even then, he was still distant, never showing much warmth. She even proposed to him first, and she didn't mind.

But after three years of marriage, Cruz had already asked for a divorce 99 times.

The first time was over salty food. He said she couldn't even handle something that simple.

The second was because he didn't like her dress.



\---

The 98th time they almost split was over a rule he made. She could only text him ten times a day, and she accidentally sent one extra ""good night.""

Every time, she ended up begging him not to go through with the divorce.

On the 99th try, she stayed on her knees in his study the entire night. Only then did he reluctantly agree to cancel it.

That same night, she stumbled across a paper bag inside his locked safe.

Inside were handwritten letters Cruz had penned for her, all the way back from when she first started chasing after him.

It turned out that he'd had feelings for her all along.

It turned out that all those divorce threats were just ways to make her cry, to keep her begging him not to leave.

He craved her love, but treated her devotion like a toy to pass the time.

The next day, Cruz filed for divorce for the 100th time.

This time, it was over a cookie. She'd eaten one in his car and left behind a few crumbs.

Nicole looked at the guy she'd been in love with for seven years and suddenly felt like she didn't even know him anymore.

This time, she was done playing along with him.

She wasn't going to lower herself again as he wished.

It was completely over between them.

She wiped her face roughly and went back to packing her suitcase.

But halfway through, she realized something was missing.

Her deceased mother's old silver necklace, the only thing she had left, was gone.

Nicole turned the whole walk-in closet upside down, even checked under the bed, but the necklace was nowhere to be found. It was like it had just vanished.

She sank to the floor, unconsciously gripping the edge of her shirt. Besides her, the only person who had been in the study was Cruz.

Recalling what she overheard back at the courthouse, she bit her mouth, grabbed her coat, and walked out.

Outside the private room at the club, loud voices and laughter could be heard clearly, even through the thick door.

""I bet five days! No way Nicole makes it past that without begging Cruz to remarry her!""

""Five? That's generous. Everyone knows she's hopeless without him. I'm going with three.""

""I say just one! She was on her knees the last time!""

""Cruz, what's your guess?""

The room suddenly got quiet. Cruz sat in the centre, slowly swirling his whiskey, his expression unreadable.

Right before he could answer, the door burst open. Nicole stepped in and said, ""It's forever.""



Chapter 2

Right as Nicole spoke, a soft voice cut in over hers.

""Sorry, I'm late.""

Angela Simpson strolled in, instantly drawing everyone's attention.

With a sweet smile, she clung to Cruz's arm and leaned into him affectionately.

Nicole looked at their intimate posture and tremblingly closed her eyes.

Angela had been around since Cruz was a kid. From when he first started dating to his marriage to Nicole, Angela never left their lives.

He never told her to back off. He even let her cross the line repeatedly, like it was nothing.

Nicole used to wonder if Cruz had real feelings for Angela.

But after reading those love letters, it finally clicked.

Angela was just a way to make Nicole jealous.

Cruz enjoyed seeing her jealousy.

That was when he noticed Nicole standing at the door and frowned. ""Why are you here?""

Nicole gripped the strap of her bag and realized he hadn't even heard her words.

""My necklace is missing,"" she said, locking eyes with him. ""I just want to know if you've seen it.""

Cruz froze for a second, then his mood shifted. ""That's it?""

""What else would it be?"" Nicole asked, ""What do you think I'm here for?""

His expression instantly darkened.

Nicole was familiar with that expression.

He always made it whenever she didn't play along with whatever version of the story he'd made up in his mind.

""That silver necklace?"" Angela suddenly interrupted, ""I told Cruz I liked it, so he gave it to me.""

She tilted her head like she was being innocent. ""But I lost it on the way home.""

Nicole's head started spinning as she snapped, ""You gave her my necklace?!""

""It's just a necklace,"" Cruz cut in coldly. ""Why are you getting so worked up? I'll purchase you ten more if you want.""

""That's my mom's keepsake!"" Nicole shouted, her voice shaking.

The whole room went dead silent.

Cruz looked taken aback at first, but he quickly went back to his usual indifferent look. ""It's already gone. What do you expect me to do? Don't make a fuss.""

Nicole bit her mouth so hard they started to bleed.

She'd told him it was her mother's keepsake, and he still thought she was just overreacting.

Did he like her in this way?

Realizing she'd never see that necklace again, she turned around and walked away. If she stayed any longer, she might break down right there.

Behind her, a chair scraped across the floor. Cruz got up. ""That's enough. Let's head out.""

He came after her.

Outside the club, the wind cut against Nicole's face like tiny blades.

She kept her head down and moved fast, not wanting anyone to notice her red, puffy eyes.

Then, she heard a strange creaking sound above.

Before she could look up, someone behind her yelled, ""Watch out!""

Nicole's eyes shot up. A giant billboard was crashing down toward them.

Cruz dashed toward her without hesitation.

But when their eyes met, he swerved at the last second and threw himself over Angela instead.

Bang!

Pain exploded through her body, and all Nicole could feel was how pathetic she was.

He'd rather let her get hurt than let anyone see he might care.

When she finally came to, all she saw was a plain white ceiling.

Nicole slowly turned her head, but the ward was empty.

""You're awake,"" a nurse said as she walked in to change her bandages. ""You've been out for two days. Good thing it was just a minor concussion.""

Nicole's throat burned. ""Who brought me in?""

""Your husband,"" the nurse replied while adjusting the IV. ""He was freaking out. You were covered in blood, and he looked like he was gonna lose it. But as soon as the doctor said you'd be okay, he rushed off. He said he had something urgent. Strange, right?""

Nicole shut her eyes and gave a tired, bitter smile.

She wasn't shocked at all.

He'd never let her see how he truly felt.



Chapter 3

Cruz didn't show up for a few days.

It wasn't until Nicole was getting discharged that he finally showed his face again.

Angela was with him, smiling as she clung to his arm.

""Wow, Nicole, you bounced back fast. I've been sickly since I was a child. I only caught a little cold, but Cruz freaked out,"" Angela said in a sweet voice. ""He dragged me here for a checkup.""

Nicole kept folding her clothes, not even glancing up.

Cruz couldn't stop staring, like he was trying to read her face.

Then out of nowhere, he said, ""Good timing. We can give you a ride back. Angela's place is getting redone, so she's gonna stay with us for a while.""

Nicole zipped her suitcase and said, ""Whatever.""

It didn't matter. Once the month-long waiting period ended, they'd be done for good.

Cruz could let whoever he wanted move in. It was none of her business.

Her lack of reaction seemed to darken his mood.

When they got back to the villa, he acted like he was mad, being all lovey-dovey with Angela right in front of Nicole.

But no matter what tricks he tried, she just didn't care.

At dinner, Cruz peeled shrimp and hand-fed Angela.

Nicole kept eating, but it all tasted bland and dry, like chewing paper.

""Ah!"" Angela yelped, scratching at her skin. ""It itches!""

Nicole looked up and noticed a red rash spreading across Angela's neck. Her breathing was also getting worse.

Cruz rushed over and scooped her up. ""Call the doctor!""

The doctor came fast and said it was a peanut allergy.

Cruz glared and called over the maid, voice cold. ""I told you many times that Angela can't have peanuts! Why was there peanut butter in the food?""

The maid looked down, fidgeting with her apron and stealing a glance at Nicole. ""Mrs. Yarbrough told me to. I'm sorry, Mr. Yarbrough. I'm just the maid.""

Nicole stood up in shock. The chair scraped loudly on the floor. ""When did I ever—""

""Please, Mrs. Yarbrough, stop making excuses!"" the maid suddenly yelled, cutting her off. ""You told me you didn't want Ms. Simpson here, and you were jealous of Mr. Yarbrough's attention. You told me to teach her a lesson.""

""Nicole.""

Cruz's voice was sharp, and the dining room felt like it dropped ten degrees.

He walked toward her, his shoes clicking hard on the marble floor.

""You've been quiet since the courthouse. I figured you'd learned your lesson."" He stared down at her, like he could see straight through her. ""Guess I was wrong.""

Nicole was about to respond, but she suddenly froze.

She caught a tiny smirk at the corner of Cruz's mouth. It was quick, but it was there.

""Since you want Angela to suffer..."" Cruz said as he turned and pulled a heavy bottle of liquor from the wine shelf. The bottle hit the table with a sharp clink. ""Then it's only fair you get a taste too.""

Nicole's whole body went numb as her back pressed against the icy wall.

He had always known she had reaction to spirits.

Two guards stepped up and grabbed her by the shoulders, squeezing hard enough to make her flinch in pain.

When the spirit slid down her throat, it felt like fire spreading from her mouth to her stomach.

She coughed violently, her eyes filling with tears, yet somehow, she still ended up swallowing half the bottle.

That horrible itching started immediately, rising from deep under her skin.

Large red rashes started spreading across her neck and arms. Breathing got harder by the second, and her vision started to fade.

Right before everything went black, Nicole caught one last image—Cruz standing there in the glow, wearing a faint smile.

He was actually smiling.

When she came to, the bedroom was dim, lit only by a soft wall lamp.

Cruz was sitting on the bed, flipping through some documents. He didn't even glance up until he heard her move.

""Oh, you're awake."" He shut the folder and spoke. ""Don't do that again.""

Nicole tried to sit up. Her throat felt raw and sore.

She saw Cruz's relieved expression, and something clicked. Her heart tightened.

It didn't matter to him if Angela had an allergy or not.

What bothered him was her acting cold lately, and what made him happy was seeing her get jealous.

It was just like those letters he kept locked up. He got a kick out of watching her lose control over him.

Unfortunately, she was done playing that game.

There were two more weeks to go.

After that, they'd officially divorce and go their separate ways.



Chapter 4

Angela's design won first prize two days later.

Cruz went all out and threw a fancy party to celebrate.

He stayed close to her the whole night under the shiny lights, stepping in when people offered drinks and even fixing her dress for her. He acted sweet and thoughtful.

People whispered all around, saying how Cruz treated his childhood friend well, but he couldn't care less about his wife. They said if Nicole hadn't kept trying to save the relationship, their marriage would've ended long ago.

Nicole stood alone, swirling her drink and ignoring the whispers.

Midway through the event, she stepped out to the lake for some air.

The cool wind helped clear out the smell of spirits.

""You finally hit your limit, huh?""

Angela's voice rang out behind Nicole, dripping with smugness.

She strutted over in heels, smiling sarcastically. ""If I were you, I would've walked away a long time ago.""

Nicole didn't even turn around. ""Get lost.""

Angela sneered. ""Don't act like you don't care. You've chased Cruz for four years, been married three, and he still doesn't care about you. It's honestly sad. Want to bet? Even if I shoved you in the lake, he wouldn't even blink.""

As the words fell, Nicole felt a hard shove.

Splash!

Freezing water rushed over her face. She tried to scream, but water filled her mouth and nose.

Through her fading vision, she saw someone sprint toward her and dive in.

""Nicole!""

Cruz sounded more panicked than ever. He rushed through the water, holding her tightly around the waist.

Nicole looked into his eyes and got lost for a second. He looked so fearful that it almost didn't feel real.

On the shore, Angela just stood there, frozen in disbelief. She couldn't believe what she was seeing.

Cruz, who usually treated Nicole like she didn't matter, had dived into the lake crazily.

The way he held onto her was like he was afraid of losing something precious.

Angela couldn't wrap her head around it.

She thought she must have seen it wrong.

Once they were back on land, Cruz dropped to the ground and started giving Nicole CPR. His fingers were visibly shaking. He didn't relax until she coughed up water.

Then suddenly, his face changed. It was like he caught himself feeling too much.

He stood up straight, shoved his emotions aside, and spoke coldly, ""How do you even end up falling in at a party?""

Nicole sat there, drenched. She gripped the fabric of her dress tightly, and her voice came out sharp. ""I didn't fall. Angela pushed me.""

Angela's eyes instantly turned red. She shook her head hard. ""Nicole, I didn't do that! How could you slander me?""

""Fine."" Nicole sneered. With shaky hands, she pulled out her phone. ""If you're not gonna admit it, let's have the police solve it. You tried to end me—there's a price for that.""

Just as she went to call, Cruz grabbed her wrist.

""That's enough,"" he whispered, gripping so hard it hurt. ""Angela didn't mean to. Don't blow this up.""

Nicole abruptly looked up in disbelief. ""She almost drowned me.""

""And yet, you're still alive, aren't you?"" he said more firmly, squinting. ""Stop creating drama.""

It was so absurd that it almost made her laugh.

She knew Cruz was just using Angela to get a reaction out of her.

But she didn't expect he'd go so far as to ignore her life.

""I'm not being dramatic,"" she said, voice steady, pressing her thumb toward the call button. ""I'm calling the cops.""

""Enough!"" Cruz snapped, yanking the phone away. ""You're not thinking straight. Go cool off.""

Then, he called over a bodyguard. ""Put her in the confinement room. She can come out once she's calmed down.""

Nicole fought hard as the bodyguard pulled her toward the confinement room.

""Cruz! Have you lost your mind?!"" she screamed, voice cracking. ""She tried to end me! You know it!""

Her nails dug into the bodyguard's arm, leaving bloody marks. Her heels slipped off in the scuffle.

But he was too strong. She was like a butterfly trapped in someone's fingers. No matter how hard she tried, it didn't work.

The door slammed shut behind her, and her eyes abruptly contracted.

The tiny room of less than three square meters had no windows. Darkness poured in like a flood and swallowed her whole.

""Let me out..."" Her voice shook as it left her mouth.

Something invisible was tightening around her neck—claustrophobia hitting hard.

Her mind flashed back to when she was ten. She was locked in a basement for three days by her stepmother.

That same despair—like the whole world had turned its back on her—hit her again after all these years.

Nicole sat huddled in the corner, her fingernails digging painfully into her palms.

She could hear a mouse scurrying somewhere in the dark. Clamping her mouth shut, she didn't even dare to breathe too loudly.

Time stopped making sense. Maybe it was an hour; maybe a day.

She pushed away the food they gave her and knocked over the glass of water.

Her throat burned like it was on fire, but it was the mental torment that broke her down, not the thirst.

When the door finally opened the next day, the sudden brightness made her squeeze her eyes shut.

""Still holding on to that?"" Cruz's voice came from above.

She barely lifted her head and saw him standing there against the light.

He still had on that same spotless suit, not even a wrinkle on the cuffs, while she looked disheveled and unkempt like a mad woman.

Out of nowhere, Nicole let out a laugh, and tears streamed down her face. ""I won't hold on to that anymore...""

Her voice was barely there. ""I don't want anything anymore.""

All she wanted now was to be released—get away from Cruz, from Angela, and from this place that was tearing her apart.

Cruz frowned when he saw how off she seemed. Something about it made him uneasy.

Still, his face quickly went back to being indifferent. ""Hope you stick to that.""

He turned around and walked away, not noticing the resolute look in her eyes.



Chapter 5

Nicole stumbled back into the room, collapsed face-down on the bed, and buried herself in the blankets.

She thought the tears had dried up, but they still slipped out and soaked the pillow.

She curled up tightly like a shrimp, even breathing hurt.

She stayed like that, dazed, until the next day. Eventually, she got up, ate something without tasting it, and drank some water.

Then her phone buzzed. It was a message in her old university group chat.

""Class reunion tonight at seven at the Crown Hotel! Hope to see everyone there!""

Nicole stared blankly at the screen.

Since she'd be leaving soon anyway, it would be the last time she'd see any of them. She might as well treat it as a goodbye.

The Crown Hotel was all lit up and glowing. Nicole lightly covered her swollen eyes with some makeup and picked out a plain white dress.

""Nicole!"" Yvonne Lawrence, her university roommate, waved her over. ""This way!""

A group of old classmates sat around, asking how she'd been.

Yvonne winked and said, ""You chased after Cruz back then. Did you ever get him?""

A few others looked over, clearly curious.

Nicole's fingers paused mid-movement.

Back then, everyone knew she was chasing after Cruz. But he didn't agree to be with her until after graduation, so barely anyone knew they were together.

And Cruz had always hated the idea of a wedding. He never even gave her one.

""I didn't,"" she said, smiling faintly.

If she had the chance to start over, she'd never want to meet him at all.

""No way! He didn't even go for someone as pretty as you?"" someone blurted. ""He must have crazy high standards!""

""Don't be sad,"" Yvonne said, already pulling out her phone. ""I know a few great guys I can set you up with!""

""What are you matchmaking for?""

A cold, deep voice spoke from behind.

Nicole froze and turned to see Cruz and Angela standing a short distance away.

Cruz wore a sharp black suit, and the diamond pin on his tie caught the light.

""Cruz?!"" the group gasped.

Angela clung to his arm, glowing in a stunning red dress.

Their entrance immediately stole all the attention in the room.

""Is this... your girlfriend?"" someone asked.

Angela gave a shy smile, and Cruz didn't say a word.

The room quickly filled with excited chatter.

""As expected! The most popular guy in school should end up with a gorgeous girl. They're a perfect match!""

Nicole quietly sipped her water, acting like she didn't hear any of it.

Cruz's eyes were locked on her, sharp as blades.

The vibe picked back up. People broke into smaller groups, swapping stories and memories.

Then, someone suggested playing truth or dare. After a few spins, the bottle pointed straight at Angela.

""I choose to dare!"" she said sweetly, sneaking a glance at Cruz.

""Kiss a guy here for ten seconds!""

As soon as the dare was announced, the room erupted in playful booing.

Angela blushed as she nervously played with the edge of her dress, but she still walked straight over to Cruz.

He sat back lazily on the couch, but his eyes drifted past everyone and landed on Nicole, who was quietly scrolling on her phone.

She didn't even flinch.

His gaze turned icy.

""Cruz..."" Angela stood right in front of him, shyly biting her mouth.

Everyone watched as Cruz suddenly pulled her in and kissed her hard.

""Wow—""

The crowd exploded.

The kiss went way past ten seconds. Cruz even made sure it sounded intense.

Nicole finally glanced up, but she just gave him a calm look before turning back to her screen.

His expression instantly darkened.



Chapter 6

After that, Cruz became even more affectionate with Angela.

He fed her, hugged her waist, and whispered in her ear.

But now and then, his gaze would unconsciously drift back to Nicole.

She didn't even flinch.

Once the party ended, Nicole headed to the restroom to fix her makeup.

Just as she stepped out, Angela appeared at the corridor corner and blocked her way.

""Did you see this?"" Angela waved her phone with a smug grin. The screen showed a photo of her and Cruz kissing. ""Cruz is into me. So do yourself a favor and sign those divorce papers. Don't embarrass yourself by begging this time.""

Nicole didn't even spare Angela a glance. She walked past her without a word.

Angela's face twisted in anger. She'd planned the whole thing, and now it felt like a complete joke.

She clenched her jaw, ready to slap Nicole. But then, she heard familiar footsteps coming down the corridor.

Changing her mind, she immediately switched tactics.

The sound of slaps echoed through the restroom. Angela slapped herself hard twice. Her cheeks turned red and swollen within seconds.

Right after, the door flew open.

""Cruz!"" she cried, bursting into tears and running straight into his arms. ""Nicole hit me...""

She complained through sobs, ""All because I was just playing around with you earlier...""

Cruz held Angela, but his eyes locked on Nicole.

He had been wondering why Nicole seemed so unaffected by his and Angela's intimacy all night. Now it made sense.

She was secretly jealous.

That thought made something stir inside him, like he was secretly satisfied. But his face stayed cold.

""It was just a game. Why get so worked up?"" he said icily. ""And besides, we're divorced now. What I do is none of your business.""

He stared at Nicole's pale face. ""Hurting Angela won't help. If you want another shot at us, show your sincerity.""

""I didn't hit her,"" Nicole replied calmly. ""She was the one who—""

""Enough!"" Cruz snapped. ""If you're going to play these little games, then reflect on yourself here tonight.""

Bang!

He slammed the door shut. The loud click of the lock followed.

Nicole pounded on the door, her palms turning red and numb from the force.

After a long time, she finally heard the lock click open.

She breathed a sigh of relief, ready to leave. But before she could go far, three men stepped out from the shadows and cornered her.

The leader yanked her hair and asked viciously, ""Are you Nicole?""

""No, I'm not,"" she said quickly, sensing danger. She tried to bolt, but a punch slammed into her stomach.

The pain doubled her over. Before she could catch her breath, someone else yanked her up by the hair.

A harsh slap made her ears ring, and blood trickled from the corner of her mouth.

""You've got a face, sure, but no shame, huh?"" The leader grabbed her chin and smacked her face frivolously with his other hand. ""We'll teach you a lesson today!""

They started beating her without mercy.

Nicole dropped to the ground, curling up and trying to shield her head.

She heard something snap in her ribs. The pain was blinding, but she clamped her mouth shut, refusing to make a sound.

""Hey, that's enough. Don't end her,"" one of them finally said. ""Ms. Simpson just wanted her roughed up.""

Their footsteps faded, leaving her crumpled on the cold ground. Her whole body screamed in pain.

Nicole tried to wiggle her fingers, but even that made her break into a cold sweat.

Then, she heard Angela's mocking laugh echo down the corridor. ""Let's see if she keeps acting all high and mighty now.""

Nicole struggled to turn over and stared up at the harsh, blinding ceiling lights.

A single drop of blood slid down her forehead. Yet somehow, she smiled.

So this was what Cruz wanted?

He might've had feelings for her. But deep down, he wanted her wrecked, crushed, and stuck in a life that felt worse than dying.

He got what he wanted.

But it'd be the last time.



Chapter 7

Nicole barely made it through the door, her body aching all over. From upstairs, she heard Angela's sweet voice floating down.

""Cruz, there's thunder tonight. Can you stay with me until I fall asleep?""

Gripping the railing tightly, Nicole climbed the stairs, her body screaming with pain. Cold sweat beaded on her forehead with every step.

Cruz was about to refuse. But when he saw Nicole, he changed his mind. ""Sure.""

He slipped his arm around Angela and led her into the main bedroom like Nicole didn't even exist.

Nicole smiled bitterly and dragged herself into the guest room without a word.

Over the next few days, she stayed home and focused all her energy on a design competition.

It was the path she wanted to reclaim once the divorce was finalized.

Back in college, Nicole had been the top student in her department. Her instructor, Beatrice Anderson, once said she would shape the future of the design world.

But that dream came crashing down after Cruz saw a coworker drop her off one day.

""Quit your job or end the marriage,"" he said coldly.

Without arguing, she resigned. Now, she was finally sketching again.

As she was adjusting the final touches on her design, the door suddenly opened.

Cruz came in with Angela. The moment he noticed the sketches, his expression darkened.

""I told you I don't want you doing this stuff,"" he said, grabbing her paintbrush. ""If you're hoping I'll reconsider the divorce, then stop right here.""

Nicole looked at him and almost laughed.

Did he still think threats would work on her?

She didn't say a word—just calmly packed up her drawings.

Cruz thought she had given in and walked out, looking satisfied.

Angela, though, paused for a moment, her eyes lingering on the draft with visible interest.

Three days after she submitted her design draft, Nicole got a call from the organizer.

Ms. Quinn, your work may be plagiarized. If you can't prove it yourself, we'll have to disqualify you.""

""What?"" Nicole was shocked. ""Who did I supposedly copy?""

""The piece matches a submission from Angela. She's a trending designer right now. Honestly, it's more likely the issue is on your end.""

Right away, Nicole remembered the way Angela had stared at her sketches earlier.

""I have the original,"" she said quickly.

But after hanging up, she searched everywhere. The manuscript was gone.

""Looking for this?""

Nicole spun around. Angela stood there, holding the manuscript.

""How did you get that?"" Nicole asked.

Angela gave a smug smile and twirled the manuscript. ""I said I liked it, and Cruz gave it to me.""

She leaned in and whispered, ""Cruz is into me. Just face the truth and stop dreaming about getting back with him. It's better for everyone if you let go now.""

Nicole's mind went blank. She stormed off to find Cruz, but he didn't even blink. ""I told you before—I don't like you doing this kind of stuff. If you'd listened and stopped, none of this would've happened.""

She stared at the man she had loved for seven years, her heart feeling like it was being cut open.

Why was he always like that?

He never cared about what she liked and never once considered how she felt.

If it weren't for those letters, she would've thought he never had feelings for her at all.

Nicole realized the original draft was gone, and arguing about it now wouldn't change anything. Everyone already saw her as a plagiarist.

She returned to her room in a daze and shut herself in the darkness.

It wasn't until her phone suddenly rang that she snapped out of her daze.

""Nicole! Are you coming back into the design world?"" Beatrice's voice rang with excitement. ""I saw your work at the competition!""

Nicole's voice cracked. ""Ms. Anderson, I didn't copy anyone...""

""I believe you,"" Beatrice replied right away. ""No one out there matches your talent. I've always known that.""

She sighed. ""It's such a waste you gave it all up because of Cruz.""

""I was dumb back then,"" Nicole admitted, brushing away tears. ""But I've already filed for divorce. I'm ready to start fresh.""

""That's great!"" Beatrice cheered. ""Wanna join my studio in Paris? All your seniors are there, and things are going great. If you come, we'll turn you into the brightest star in design!""

""Can I?""

""Of course! Who knows your talent better than me?"" Beatrice pretended to be angry. ""If you hadn't suddenly quit back then...""

Nicole took a deep breath. ""Okay, I'll go. I'll leave once the divorce goes through.""

Right after she said that, the door burst open. Cruz stood in the doorway, his expression dark and unreadable.

""Where do you want to go?""



Chapter 8

Nicole hung up quickly and forced herself to stay calm. ""You probably misheard.""

Cruz squinted at her, clearly suspicious, but he didn't push it.

Instead, he said, ""You and Angela have been tense lately because of the design stuff. I'll take you both to the amusement park tomorrow. It'll help you relax.""

Nicole wanted to say no right away, but she stopped herself.

She remembered how she used to beg him to go to amusement parks, and he always called them childish.

If she turned him down now, it might look weird.

""Alright,"" she responded softly.

The amusement park was packed with people.

Cruz stayed close to Angela, buckling her into the roller coaster, helping her onto the carousel, and even feeding her ice cream.

Nicole trailed behind like she wasn't even there.

Then, Cruz got a call from the company and stepped aside to take it. Angela suddenly grabbed Nicole's wrist. ""Let's try bungee jumping!""

Nicole instinctively pulled her hand back. ""I'm not going.""

""Cruz said we should get along,"" Angela whispered, stepping closer. ""Still mad about the design thing? You really hold grudges.""

People around them started staring curiously.

Nicole pursed her mouth, not wanting a scene. She gave in and followed Angela onto the ride.

Click!

The safety bar came down. Angela leaned close again. ""Oh, by the way, Cruz promised me a trip to the Maldives after the divorce goes through—""

Before she could finish, the ride went back violently.

""Ah!""

As soon as the seatbelt snapped, Nicole felt her body go weightless.

She and Angela plummeted from over ten meters high.

The air roared past her ears, and Nicole shut her eyes, bracing for the worst.

But the pain never came. Instead, she landed in a warm embrace.

When she opened her eyes, Cruz's panicked face was right there.

He held her tightly, his breathing ragged.

""You...""

She barely got the word out before Cruz quickly pulled away like he'd touched something hot.

""I grabbed the wrong person,"" he muttered awkwardly, then rushed over to Angela, who lay on the ground. ""Angela!""



\---

At the hospital, a doctor hurried up. ""She's losing a lot of blood and needs an urgent transfusion! The blood type is RH negative. The supply is low!""

Cruz immediately looked straight at Nicole.

""You're RH negative too."" That wasn't a question, but a statement.

Nicole leaned on the wall, her knee still bleeding. She met Cruz's eyes and suddenly understood what he wanted.

""Give blood,"" he said, stepping in close and whispering, ""If you do, I'll take back the divorce.""

His breath brushed past her ear. It smelled cold and familiar.

There was a time when being that close would've made her heart flutter.

Now, all it did was make her feel empty.

When the nurse handed over the consent form, Nicole signed it right away.

She couldn't let Cruz start suspecting anything—not when she had plans to leave for Paris.

She had to play it safe.

As the needle went in, she turned her head away, watching the blood slowly drip into the bag.

One bag filled, then another.

""Stop right there!"" the nurse suddenly called out. ""She's already at her limit!""

Nicole's vision blurred, and her ears rang.

Everything felt hazy. She saw Cruz standing nearby, frowning. His mouth was moving, but she couldn't hear a word.

Chapter 9

The white walls of the hospital hurt my eyes.

After Nicole had finished the blood transfusion, the doctor insisted that she stay in the hospital for observation. However, Cruz never came to see her once.

The phone kept vibrating, it was a photo sent by Angela.

The photo of Cruz feeding her porridge.

A photo of Cruz standing by the sickbed.

When Cruz was asleep, she stole a photo of him kissing his cheek.

Nicole deleted one by one, her heart no longer wavering.

When the heart dies completely, even the sense of pain will disappear.

On the last day of the waiting period, Nicole woke up early.

The sunlight streamed in through the curtains as she packed the last piece of clothing into her suitcase.

The plane tickets to Paris lay quietly in the bag, for the flight at three in the afternoon.

At that moment, the doorbell suddenly rang.

Cruz stood at the doorway, dressed sharply in a suit, as if he had just returned from an important meeting.

""Angela is out of danger,"" he cut to the chase. ""I promised to accompany you to withdraw the application, and I will keep my word.""

Nicole quietly watched him.

""However,"" Cruz added, ""if you make the same mistake again next time, I will still bring up divorce.""

Nicole suddenly felt like laughing.

There will be no next time.

She was about to embark on her own journey of life.

Along the way, the two of them remained silent.

Nicole tightened her grip on the bag strap until the car stopped in front of the courthouse.

""We're here,"" Cruz unbuckled his seatbelt, ""Hurry up, I still need to go to the hospital to see Angela.""

Nicole looked at the familiar glass doors of the courthouse, absentmindedly running her fingertips along the edge of her phone.

She needed to find a way to distract Cruz and make sure he didn't follow them inside.

""I...""

Just as he started speaking, Cruz's phone began to ring.

""Angela?"" he frowned as he picked up the phone, ""What's wrong? Don't cry, I'll be right over.""

Hanging up the phone, Cruz turned to Nicole and said, ""Angela is feeling unstable, I need to go over there first. You go in and cancel the application yourself, and let me know when it's done.""

Nicole lowered her eyelashes, hiding the relief in her eyes: ""Okay.""

She watched as Cruz's car sped away, then turned and walked into the courthouse.

The familiar clerk greeted with a smile, ""Ms. Quinn, coming to withdraw your application again?""

""No,"" Nicole took out the prepared documents from her bag, ""I came to pick up the Divorce Certificate today.""

When she got home, Nicole placed the Divorce Certificate belonging to Cruz on the coffee table and picked up the already packed suitcase.

The closing sound of the door was very soft, but it felt like a knife, completely cutting off seven years of infatuation.

On the way to the airport, the sun was shining brightly.

Nicole rolled down the car window, closed her eyes slowly, and felt the taste of happy in the air.

Goodbye, Cruz.

This time, I really didn't want you anymore.",1,1753269372.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False
1m76gwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/1m76gwv/can_never_get_the_last_nap_of_the_day_righthelp/,Can never get the last nap of the day right…help!,"My question is related to the last nap of the day: How on EARTH do you nail that final nap so it’s leaves an WW of about 60-90 mins before bed time? And if/when you do NOT get it right for the full nap, how do you choose to proceed? Do you stretch the WW so it’s super long, or cram in a short nap because something’s better than nothing? Or do you allow a full nap and just bump back bedtime? Or do you bring bedtime earlier!? 

Let me start by saying we’re in the ‘’establish a good routine’’ phase of sleep training, not a formal process that involves Ferber, CIO, etc. just yet. We’ll aim to get there in a couple of months when mom goes back to work, but want to build good habits slowly and gently now while she’s young.

I feel like we do a good job of this in the morning, but by the afternoon something’s always thrown it out of whack – an unavoidable car ride results in a nap that disrupts a WW and delays the next nap cycle, she’s fought a nap for 60 minutes only to then sleep for just 45, etc., she’s taken a super LONG nap and cut into the WW before bed, etc. It’s always something by that final nap, and I’m not sure how to respond to keep things on track. Or track-ish. I’m fine with track-ish….

So  - help me be more confident in deciding how to handle the end of the day sleep when the stars don’t align for a solid nap followed by a solid WW to ride right into bed time…

Some details for those of you who will surely ask for more info: 

\-Daughter is 13 weeks, born 3 weeks early but healthy and developing at her age (not her adjusted age), as far as we know. 90th percentiles for height, 30-50s for weight. She is EBF. 

\-She typically naps 3-4 times a day. We usually get in two before lunch and two after lunch time. At least two of these are typically close to 2 hours. She mostly contact naps, although I often transfer her at about 75-90 mins of the long naps to help her get used to sleeping in her crib. Occasionally, she’ll want to sleep more than 2 hours. I permit this if the sleep’s been crappy, but try to not to stretch past 2.5 or 3. She is typically grouchy when woken up from these long naps, FWIW. 

\-Yes, she’ll fall asleep in the stroller, but those naps never last long (30 mins if we’re lucky). She’ll also sleep in the carrier and I can get a full 60-90 mins nap this way, so long as I can keep the temperature consistent (e.g. she doesnt want me to walk for 30 mins and then go into the supermarket…). 

\-Wake windows are anywhere from 60-90 minutes, unless she decides to fight sleep and then they can be longer. Her cues are getting harder to detect until she’s fully fussy. This is new as of the 12 week mark, I’d say. 

\-She does fight naps sometimes, especially in the late afternoon, which is part of what’s behind this question!  There are days when I‘m rocking and singing and soothing for like an hour before she falls asleep, and then 45 mins later she’s back awake. 

\-We usually start bedtime routine between 7 and 7:30. In involves bath, belly rub, white noise, dark room, final feed, cuddles, transfer to basinet sleeping. (Yes, we hope to break this habit eventually…) The goal is to get her down by 8, if not before. 

\-She’ll usually sleep 4.5-6 hours for the first stretch at night (say 8-1 AM), followed by a 3 hour sleep (say 1:30-4:30 AM), and then it’s kind of a toss up. She can sometimes do another 2, sometimes she’s up in an hour. This is tricky to fix because her dad has to be up at 5 AM and his routine often wakes her up. I’m hoping this works itself out when she moves into her own room, but for now havent tried to break the early-wake habit because it’d involve denying my husband coffee and locking the dog out of the bedroom… 

  
Anyhow - THANKS FOR ANY HELP YOU CAN PROVIDE!!

**Recycling collection**
Our recycling has not been picked up for 4 weeks in a row, but they picked up the people’s recycling on the other portion of the street across the intersection. I live on the corner of Oak Hill Dr and Locust Ave. They have not picked up mine or my neighbors recycling. This has been an ongoing issue and it’s ridiculous. Whoever is on recycling duty for this portion of the street needs to do a better job because it’s happening too frequently.

Crown Castle has a cell tower on our property located at 333 Waller Avenue. The privacy fence surrounding it has been falling down and reported to Crown numerous times over the past three years. Nothing is being done to fix/replace it by Crown who is responsible. Now, The chain link fence behind it and adjacent to the rail road has been cut including copper theft. This lack of security is an eye sore and safety concern.

**Request for additional signage.**
Iwas curious about street signage. Our street has one sign that says “no parking” for one side of the road but people don’t abide by it I think because it’s really tall and crooked. Would it be possible to fix it or add additional signage to be more clear about the no parking as it makes driving and getting into driveways when both sides of the road are parked on.

1m76gcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1m76gcl/this_time_i_really_didnt_want_you_anymore/,"This Time, I Really Didn’t Want You Anymore","Nicole Quinn and Cruz Yarbrough had filed for divorce 99 times.

Each time, Cruz would quietly wait for her to cave in during the waiting period, knowing she'd come crawling back. She would coax him, and only then would he agree to cancel the paperwork.

At the 100th filing, as Nicole stood up to leave, a staff member behind the desk asked curiously, ""So, when are you coming back to cancel it this time?""

Nicole glanced at Cruz's cold figure walking away and told herself inwardly.

Would not cancel this time.

When the 30-day waiting period ended, it would finally be official.

The wind outside the courthouse was biting. Nicole stepped out and watched Cruz slip into his sleek black car without even glancing back at her.

She walked slowly along the sidewalk. It felt like something inside her had been ripped open, and the cold air just poured in.

Suddenly, screeching tires rang out behind her.

Before she could react, she was shoved to the ground. Her knees throbbed, and her palms burned.

Looking up through messy hair, she saw Cruz's friends scrambling out of the car.

""Crap! We just hit Mrs. Yarbrough!""

""Stop calling her that,"" someone muttered. ""They're getting divorced. Cruz hasn't agreed to cancel it yet.""

Nicole tried to stand, her legs trembling. Through her messy bangs, she saw the rear window of the car rolled halfway down. Cruz's cold profile was just barely visible in the shadows.

One of the guys asked, ""Should we take her to the hospital first, or just head to the party?""

Time froze for a moment. Nicole stared at that car window, her heart aching.

""To the party."" Cruz's cold voice came through the car window.

Those simple words cut deeper than a knife.

The car sped off, the exhaust fumes hitting her face.

Gritting her teeth, Nicole pulled herself up and limped all the way home.

Every step made her knees scream, but that was nothing compared to the way her heart felt—shredded and raw.

As soon as she got home, she started packing.

She pulled out everything that reminded her of their years together.

The jewelry he casually threw to her, the lighter he used that she secretly kept, the jar of 999 paper stars she folded for him...

One by one, she tossed them all in the trash. Then, she pulled out a paper bag from the deepest part of the drawer.

Her hands shook as she opened it again, even though she'd seen what was inside.

They were Cruz's love letters.

""You brought breakfast again today. But you didn't know I got up at five just to watch you quietly set it by my window.

""Your handwriting in those letters is terrible, but I kept them. I'll tease you about them on our 50th anniversary.

""That red dress looked good, but I wish no one else could see you in it.

""You've been chasing me for three years. I almost gave in. But I wanted to hold out a bit longer and enjoy being pursued.""

Every line felt like a punch to the heart.

If she hadn't randomly found those love letters a few days earlier, she never would've believed that Cruz, who'd always acted cold and distant, actually liked her.

The first time Nicole saw Cruz was during their university's opening ceremony.

He was speaking onstage as the student rep, looking sharp and untouchable.

With just a glance, she fell in love.

Many people pursued Cruz, but Nicole was the most stubborn one.

She kept bringing him breakfast, even though he never touched it. She memorized all his classes just to run into him. When he got hurt playing basketball, she climbed over the wall to get him medicine and ended up breaking her wrist for it.

She spent four years and 1,460 days chasing after him until they finally got together.

Even then, he was still distant, never showing much warmth. She even proposed to him first, and she didn't mind.

But after three years of marriage, Cruz had already asked for a divorce 99 times.

The first time was over salty food. He said she couldn't even handle something that simple.

The second was because he didn't like her dress.



\---

The 98th time they almost split was over a rule he made. She could only text him ten times a day, and she accidentally sent one extra ""good night.""

Every time, she ended up begging him not to go through with the divorce.

On the 99th try, she stayed on her knees in his study the entire night. Only then did he reluctantly agree to cancel it.

That same night, she stumbled across a paper bag inside his locked safe.

Inside were handwritten letters Cruz had penned for her, all the way back from when she first started chasing after him.

It turned out that he'd had feelings for her all along.

It turned out that all those divorce threats were just ways to make her cry, to keep her begging him not to leave.

He craved her love, but treated her devotion like a toy to pass the time.

The next day, Cruz filed for divorce for the 100th time.

This time, it was over a cookie. She'd eaten one in his car and left behind a few crumbs.

Nicole looked at the guy she'd been in love with for seven years and suddenly felt like she didn't even know him anymore.

This time, she was done playing along with him.

She wasn't going to lower herself again as he wished.

It was completely over between them.

She wiped her face roughly and went back to packing her suitcase.

But halfway through, she realized something was missing.

Her deceased mother's old silver necklace, the only thing she had left, was gone.

Nicole turned the whole walk-in closet upside down, even checked under the bed, but the necklace was nowhere to be found. It was like it had just vanished.

She sank to the floor, unconsciously gripping the edge of her shirt. Besides her, the only person who had been in the study was Cruz.

Recalling what she overheard back at the courthouse, she bit her mouth, grabbed her coat, and walked out.

Outside the private room at the club, loud voices and laughter could be heard clearly, even through the thick door.

""I bet five days! No way Nicole makes it past that without begging Cruz to remarry her!""

""Five? That's generous. Everyone knows she's hopeless without him. I'm going with three.""

""I say just one! She was on her knees the last time!""

""Cruz, what's your guess?""

The room suddenly got quiet. Cruz sat in the centre, slowly swirling his whiskey, his expression unreadable.

Right before he could answer, the door burst open. Nicole stepped in and said, ""It's forever.""



Chapter 2

Right as Nicole spoke, a soft voice cut in over hers.

""Sorry, I'm late.""

Angela Simpson strolled in, instantly drawing everyone's attention.

With a sweet smile, she clung to Cruz's arm and leaned into him affectionately.

Nicole looked at their intimate posture and tremblingly closed her eyes.

Angela had been around since Cruz was a kid. From when he first started dating to his marriage to Nicole, Angela never left their lives.

He never told her to back off. He even let her cross the line repeatedly, like it was nothing.

Nicole used to wonder if Cruz had real feelings for Angela.

But after reading those love letters, it finally clicked.

Angela was just a way to make Nicole jealous.

Cruz enjoyed seeing her jealousy.

That was when he noticed Nicole standing at the door and frowned. ""Why are you here?""

Nicole gripped the strap of her bag and realized he hadn't even heard her words.

""My necklace is missing,"" she said, locking eyes with him. ""I just want to know if you've seen it.""

Cruz froze for a second, then his mood shifted. ""That's it?""

""What else would it be?"" Nicole asked, ""What do you think I'm here for?""

His expression instantly darkened.

Nicole was familiar with that expression.

He always made it whenever she didn't play along with whatever version of the story he'd made up in his mind.

""That silver necklace?"" Angela suddenly interrupted, ""I told Cruz I liked it, so he gave it to me.""

She tilted her head like she was being innocent. ""But I lost it on the way home.""

Nicole's head started spinning as she snapped, ""You gave her my necklace?!""

""It's just a necklace,"" Cruz cut in coldly. ""Why are you getting so worked up? I'll purchase you ten more if you want.""

""That's my mom's keepsake!"" Nicole shouted, her voice shaking.

The whole room went dead silent.

Cruz looked taken aback at first, but he quickly went back to his usual indifferent look. ""It's already gone. What do you expect me to do? Don't make a fuss.""

Nicole bit her mouth so hard they started to bleed.

She'd told him it was her mother's keepsake, and he still thought she was just overreacting.

Did he like her in this way?

Realizing she'd never see that necklace again, she turned around and walked away. If she stayed any longer, she might break down right there.

Behind her, a chair scraped across the floor. Cruz got up. ""That's enough. Let's head out.""

He came after her.

Outside the club, the wind cut against Nicole's face like tiny blades.

She kept her head down and moved fast, not wanting anyone to notice her red, puffy eyes.

Then, she heard a strange creaking sound above.

Before she could look up, someone behind her yelled, ""Watch out!""

Nicole's eyes shot up. A giant billboard was crashing down toward them.

Cruz dashed toward her without hesitation.

But when their eyes met, he swerved at the last second and threw himself over Angela instead.

Bang!

Pain exploded through her body, and all Nicole could feel was how pathetic she was.

He'd rather let her get hurt than let anyone see he might care.

When she finally came to, all she saw was a plain white ceiling.

Nicole slowly turned her head, but the ward was empty.

""You're awake,"" a nurse said as she walked in to change her bandages. ""You've been out for two days. Good thing it was just a minor concussion.""

Nicole's throat burned. ""Who brought me in?""

""Your husband,"" the nurse replied while adjusting the IV. ""He was freaking out. You were covered in blood, and he looked like he was gonna lose it. But as soon as the doctor said you'd be okay, he rushed off. He said he had something urgent. Strange, right?""

Nicole shut her eyes and gave a tired, bitter smile.

She wasn't shocked at all.

He'd never let her see how he truly felt.



Chapter 3

Cruz didn't show up for a few days.

It wasn't until Nicole was getting discharged that he finally showed his face again.

Angela was with him, smiling as she clung to his arm.

""Wow, Nicole, you bounced back fast. I've been sickly since I was a child. I only caught a little cold, but Cruz freaked out,"" Angela said in a sweet voice. ""He dragged me here for a checkup.""

Nicole kept folding her clothes, not even glancing up.

Cruz couldn't stop staring, like he was trying to read her face.

Then out of nowhere, he said, ""Good timing. We can give you a ride back. Angela's place is getting redone, so she's gonna stay with us for a while.""

Nicole zipped her suitcase and said, ""Whatever.""

It didn't matter. Once the month-long waiting period ended, they'd be done for good.

Cruz could let whoever he wanted move in. It was none of her business.

Her lack of reaction seemed to darken his mood.

When they got back to the villa, he acted like he was mad, being all lovey-dovey with Angela right in front of Nicole.

But no matter what tricks he tried, she just didn't care.

At dinner, Cruz peeled shrimp and hand-fed Angela.

Nicole kept eating, but it all tasted bland and dry, like chewing paper.

""Ah!"" Angela yelped, scratching at her skin. ""It itches!""

Nicole looked up and noticed a red rash spreading across Angela's neck. Her breathing was also getting worse.

Cruz rushed over and scooped her up. ""Call the doctor!""

The doctor came fast and said it was a peanut allergy.

Cruz glared and called over the maid, voice cold. ""I told you many times that Angela can't have peanuts! Why was there peanut butter in the food?""

The maid looked down, fidgeting with her apron and stealing a glance at Nicole. ""Mrs. Yarbrough told me to. I'm sorry, Mr. Yarbrough. I'm just the maid.""

Nicole stood up in shock. The chair scraped loudly on the floor. ""When did I ever—""

""Please, Mrs. Yarbrough, stop making excuses!"" the maid suddenly yelled, cutting her off. ""You told me you didn't want Ms. Simpson here, and you were jealous of Mr. Yarbrough's attention. You told me to teach her a lesson.""

""Nicole.""

Cruz's voice was sharp, and the dining room felt like it dropped ten degrees.

He walked toward her, his shoes clicking hard on the marble floor.

""You've been quiet since the courthouse. I figured you'd learned your lesson."" He stared down at her, like he could see straight through her. ""Guess I was wrong.""

Nicole was about to respond, but she suddenly froze.

She caught a tiny smirk at the corner of Cruz's mouth. It was quick, but it was there.

""Since you want Angela to suffer..."" Cruz said as he turned and pulled a heavy bottle of liquor from the wine shelf. The bottle hit the table with a sharp clink. ""Then it's only fair you get a taste too.""

Nicole's whole body went numb as her back pressed against the icy wall.

He had always known she had reaction to spirits.

Two guards stepped up and grabbed her by the shoulders, squeezing hard enough to make her flinch in pain.

When the spirit slid down her throat, it felt like fire spreading from her mouth to her stomach.

She coughed violently, her eyes filling with tears, yet somehow, she still ended up swallowing half the bottle.

That horrible itching started immediately, rising from deep under her skin.

Large red rashes started spreading across her neck and arms. Breathing got harder by the second, and her vision started to fade.

Right before everything went black, Nicole caught one last image—Cruz standing there in the glow, wearing a faint smile.

He was actually smiling.

When she came to, the bedroom was dim, lit only by a soft wall lamp.

Cruz was sitting on the bed, flipping through some documents. He didn't even glance up until he heard her move.

""Oh, you're awake."" He shut the folder and spoke. ""Don't do that again.""

Nicole tried to sit up. Her throat felt raw and sore.

She saw Cruz's relieved expression, and something clicked. Her heart tightened.

It didn't matter to him if Angela had an allergy or not.

What bothered him was her acting cold lately, and what made him happy was seeing her get jealous.

It was just like those letters he kept locked up. He got a kick out of watching her lose control over him.

Unfortunately, she was done playing that game.

There were two more weeks to go.

After that, they'd officially divorce and go their separate ways.



Chapter 4

Angela's design won first prize two days later.

Cruz went all out and threw a fancy party to celebrate.

He stayed close to her the whole night under the shiny lights, stepping in when people offered drinks and even fixing her dress for her. He acted sweet and thoughtful.

People whispered all around, saying how Cruz treated his childhood friend well, but he couldn't care less about his wife. They said if Nicole hadn't kept trying to save the relationship, their marriage would've ended long ago.

Nicole stood alone, swirling her drink and ignoring the whispers.

Midway through the event, she stepped out to the lake for some air.

The cool wind helped clear out the smell of spirits.

""You finally hit your limit, huh?""

Angela's voice rang out behind Nicole, dripping with smugness.

She strutted over in heels, smiling sarcastically. ""If I were you, I would've walked away a long time ago.""

Nicole didn't even turn around. ""Get lost.""

Angela sneered. ""Don't act like you don't care. You've chased Cruz for four years, been married three, and he still doesn't care about you. It's honestly sad. Want to bet? Even if I shoved you in the lake, he wouldn't even blink.""

As the words fell, Nicole felt a hard shove.

Splash!

Freezing water rushed over her face. She tried to scream, but water filled her mouth and nose.

Through her fading vision, she saw someone sprint toward her and dive in.

""Nicole!""

Cruz sounded more panicked than ever. He rushed through the water, holding her tightly around the waist.

Nicole looked into his eyes and got lost for a second. He looked so fearful that it almost didn't feel real.

On the shore, Angela just stood there, frozen in disbelief. She couldn't believe what she was seeing.

Cruz, who usually treated Nicole like she didn't matter, had dived into the lake crazily.

The way he held onto her was like he was afraid of losing something precious.

Angela couldn't wrap her head around it.

She thought she must have seen it wrong.

Once they were back on land, Cruz dropped to the ground and started giving Nicole CPR. His fingers were visibly shaking. He didn't relax until she coughed up water.

Then suddenly, his face changed. It was like he caught himself feeling too much.

He stood up straight, shoved his emotions aside, and spoke coldly, ""How do you even end up falling in at a party?""

Nicole sat there, drenched. She gripped the fabric of her dress tightly, and her voice came out sharp. ""I didn't fall. Angela pushed me.""

Angela's eyes instantly turned red. She shook her head hard. ""Nicole, I didn't do that! How could you slander me?""

""Fine."" Nicole sneered. With shaky hands, she pulled out her phone. ""If you're not gonna admit it, let's have the police solve it. You tried to end me—there's a price for that.""

Just as she went to call, Cruz grabbed her wrist.

""That's enough,"" he whispered, gripping so hard it hurt. ""Angela didn't mean to. Don't blow this up.""

Nicole abruptly looked up in disbelief. ""She almost drowned me.""

""And yet, you're still alive, aren't you?"" he said more firmly, squinting. ""Stop creating drama.""

It was so absurd that it almost made her laugh.

She knew Cruz was just using Angela to get a reaction out of her.

But she didn't expect he'd go so far as to ignore her life.

""I'm not being dramatic,"" she said, voice steady, pressing her thumb toward the call button. ""I'm calling the cops.""

""Enough!"" Cruz snapped, yanking the phone away. ""You're not thinking straight. Go cool off.""

Then, he called over a bodyguard. ""Put her in the confinement room. She can come out once she's calmed down.""

Nicole fought hard as the bodyguard pulled her toward the confinement room.

""Cruz! Have you lost your mind?!"" she screamed, voice cracking. ""She tried to end me! You know it!""

Her nails dug into the bodyguard's arm, leaving bloody marks. Her heels slipped off in the scuffle.

But he was too strong. She was like a butterfly trapped in someone's fingers. No matter how hard she tried, it didn't work.

The door slammed shut behind her, and her eyes abruptly contracted.

The tiny room of less than three square meters had no windows. Darkness poured in like a flood and swallowed her whole.

""Let me out..."" Her voice shook as it left her mouth.

Something invisible was tightening around her neck—claustrophobia hitting hard.

Her mind flashed back to when she was ten. She was locked in a basement for three days by her stepmother.

That same despair—like the whole world had turned its back on her—hit her again after all these years.

Nicole sat huddled in the corner, her fingernails digging painfully into her palms.

She could hear a mouse scurrying somewhere in the dark. Clamping her mouth shut, she didn't even dare to breathe too loudly.

Time stopped making sense. Maybe it was an hour; maybe a day.

She pushed away the food they gave her and knocked over the glass of water.

Her throat burned like it was on fire, but it was the mental torment that broke her down, not the thirst.

When the door finally opened the next day, the sudden brightness made her squeeze her eyes shut.

""Still holding on to that?"" Cruz's voice came from above.

She barely lifted her head and saw him standing there against the light.

He still had on that same spotless suit, not even a wrinkle on the cuffs, while she looked disheveled and unkempt like a mad woman.

Out of nowhere, Nicole let out a laugh, and tears streamed down her face. ""I won't hold on to that anymore...""

Her voice was barely there. ""I don't want anything anymore.""

All she wanted now was to be released—get away from Cruz, from Angela, and from this place that was tearing her apart.

Cruz frowned when he saw how off she seemed. Something about it made him uneasy.

Still, his face quickly went back to being indifferent. ""Hope you stick to that.""

He turned around and walked away, not noticing the resolute look in her eyes.



Chapter 5

Nicole stumbled back into the room, collapsed face-down on the bed, and buried herself in the blankets.

She thought the tears had dried up, but they still slipped out and soaked the pillow.

She curled up tightly like a shrimp, even breathing hurt.

She stayed like that, dazed, until the next day. Eventually, she got up, ate something without tasting it, and drank some water.

Then her phone buzzed. It was a message in her old university group chat.

""Class reunion tonight at seven at the Crown Hotel! Hope to see everyone there!""

Nicole stared blankly at the screen.

Since she'd be leaving soon anyway, it would be the last time she'd see any of them. She might as well treat it as a goodbye.

The Crown Hotel was all lit up and glowing. Nicole lightly covered her swollen eyes with some makeup and picked out a plain white dress.

""Nicole!"" Yvonne Lawrence, her university roommate, waved her over. ""This way!""

A group of old classmates sat around, asking how she'd been.

Yvonne winked and said, ""You chased after Cruz back then. Did you ever get him?""

A few others looked over, clearly curious.

Nicole's fingers paused mid-movement.

Back then, everyone knew she was chasing after Cruz. But he didn't agree to be with her until after graduation, so barely anyone knew they were together.

And Cruz had always hated the idea of a wedding. He never even gave her one.

""I didn't,"" she said, smiling faintly.

If she had the chance to start over, she'd never want to meet him at all.

""No way! He didn't even go for someone as pretty as you?"" someone blurted. ""He must have crazy high standards!""

""Don't be sad,"" Yvonne said, already pulling out her phone. ""I know a few great guys I can set you up with!""

""What are you matchmaking for?""

A cold, deep voice spoke from behind.

Nicole froze and turned to see Cruz and Angela standing a short distance away.

Cruz wore a sharp black suit, and the diamond pin on his tie caught the light.

""Cruz?!"" the group gasped.

Angela clung to his arm, glowing in a stunning red dress.

Their entrance immediately stole all the attention in the room.

""Is this... your girlfriend?"" someone asked.

Angela gave a shy smile, and Cruz didn't say a word.

The room quickly filled with excited chatter.

""As expected! The most popular guy in school should end up with a gorgeous girl. They're a perfect match!""

Nicole quietly sipped her water, acting like she didn't hear any of it.

Cruz's eyes were locked on her, sharp as blades.

The vibe picked back up. People broke into smaller groups, swapping stories and memories.

Then, someone suggested playing truth or dare. After a few spins, the bottle pointed straight at Angela.

""I choose to dare!"" she said sweetly, sneaking a glance at Cruz.

""Kiss a guy here for ten seconds!""

As soon as the dare was announced, the room erupted in playful booing.

Angela blushed as she nervously played with the edge of her dress, but she still walked straight over to Cruz.

He sat back lazily on the couch, but his eyes drifted past everyone and landed on Nicole, who was quietly scrolling on her phone.

She didn't even flinch.

His gaze turned icy.

""Cruz..."" Angela stood right in front of him, shyly biting her mouth.

Everyone watched as Cruz suddenly pulled her in and kissed her hard.

""Wow—""

The crowd exploded.

The kiss went way past ten seconds. Cruz even made sure it sounded intense.

Nicole finally glanced up, but she just gave him a calm look before turning back to her screen.

His expression instantly darkened.



Chapter 6

After that, Cruz became even more affectionate with Angela.

He fed her, hugged her waist, and whispered in her ear.

But now and then, his gaze would unconsciously drift back to Nicole.

She didn't even flinch.

Once the party ended, Nicole headed to the restroom to fix her makeup.

Just as she stepped out, Angela appeared at the corridor corner and blocked her way.

""Did you see this?"" Angela waved her phone with a smug grin. The screen showed a photo of her and Cruz kissing. ""Cruz is into me. So do yourself a favor and sign those divorce papers. Don't embarrass yourself by begging this time.""

Nicole didn't even spare Angela a glance. She walked past her without a word.

Angela's face twisted in anger. She'd planned the whole thing, and now it felt like a complete joke.

She clenched her jaw, ready to slap Nicole. But then, she heard familiar footsteps coming down the corridor.

Changing her mind, she immediately switched tactics.

The sound of slaps echoed through the restroom. Angela slapped herself hard twice. Her cheeks turned red and swollen within seconds.

Right after, the door flew open.

""Cruz!"" she cried, bursting into tears and running straight into his arms. ""Nicole hit me...""

She complained through sobs, ""All because I was just playing around with you earlier...""

Cruz held Angela, but his eyes locked on Nicole.

He had been wondering why Nicole seemed so unaffected by his and Angela's intimacy all night. Now it made sense.

She was secretly jealous.

That thought made something stir inside him, like he was secretly satisfied. But his face stayed cold.

""It was just a game. Why get so worked up?"" he said icily. ""And besides, we're divorced now. What I do is none of your business.""

He stared at Nicole's pale face. ""Hurting Angela won't help. If you want another shot at us, show your sincerity.""

""I didn't hit her,"" Nicole replied calmly. ""She was the one who—""

""Enough!"" Cruz snapped. ""If you're going to play these little games, then reflect on yourself here tonight.""

Bang!

He slammed the door shut. The loud click of the lock followed.

Nicole pounded on the door, her palms turning red and numb from the force.

After a long time, she finally heard the lock click open.

She breathed a sigh of relief, ready to leave. But before she could go far, three men stepped out from the shadows and cornered her.

The leader yanked her hair and asked viciously, ""Are you Nicole?""

""No, I'm not,"" she said quickly, sensing danger. She tried to bolt, but a punch slammed into her stomach.

The pain doubled her over. Before she could catch her breath, someone else yanked her up by the hair.

A harsh slap made her ears ring, and blood trickled from the corner of her mouth.

""You've got a face, sure, but no shame, huh?"" The leader grabbed her chin and smacked her face frivolously with his other hand. ""We'll teach you a lesson today!""

They started beating her without mercy.

Nicole dropped to the ground, curling up and trying to shield her head.

She heard something snap in her ribs. The pain was blinding, but she clamped her mouth shut, refusing to make a sound.

""Hey, that's enough. Don't end her,"" one of them finally said. ""Ms. Simpson just wanted her roughed up.""

Their footsteps faded, leaving her crumpled on the cold ground. Her whole body screamed in pain.

Nicole tried to wiggle her fingers, but even that made her break into a cold sweat.

Then, she heard Angela's mocking laugh echo down the corridor. ""Let's see if she keeps acting all high and mighty now.""

Nicole struggled to turn over and stared up at the harsh, blinding ceiling lights.

A single drop of blood slid down her forehead. Yet somehow, she smiled.

So this was what Cruz wanted?

He might've had feelings for her. But deep down, he wanted her wrecked, crushed, and stuck in a life that felt worse than dying.

He got what he wanted.

But it'd be the last time.



Chapter 7

Nicole barely made it through the door, her body aching all over. From upstairs, she heard Angela's sweet voice floating down.

""Cruz, there's thunder tonight. Can you stay with me until I fall asleep?""

Gripping the railing tightly, Nicole climbed the stairs, her body screaming with pain. Cold sweat beaded on her forehead with every step.

Cruz was about to refuse. But when he saw Nicole, he changed his mind. ""Sure.""

He slipped his arm around Angela and led her into the main bedroom like Nicole didn't even exist.

Nicole smiled bitterly and dragged herself into the guest room without a word.

Over the next few days, she stayed home and focused all her energy on a design competition.

It was the path she wanted to reclaim once the divorce was finalized.

Back in college, Nicole had been the top student in her department. Her instructor, Beatrice Anderson, once said she would shape the future of the design world.

But that dream came crashing down after Cruz saw a coworker drop her off one day.

""Quit your job or end the marriage,"" he said coldly.

Without arguing, she resigned. Now, she was finally sketching again.

As she was adjusting the final touches on her design, the door suddenly opened.

Cruz came in with Angela. The moment he noticed the sketches, his expression darkened.

""I told you I don't want you doing this stuff,"" he said, grabbing her paintbrush. ""If you're hoping I'll reconsider the divorce, then stop right here.""

Nicole looked at him and almost laughed.

Did he still think threats would work on her?

She didn't say a word—just calmly packed up her drawings.

Cruz thought she had given in and walked out, looking satisfied.

Angela, though, paused for a moment, her eyes lingering on the draft with visible interest.

Three days after she submitted her design draft, Nicole got a call from the organizer.

Ms. Quinn, your work may be plagiarized. If you can't prove it yourself, we'll have to disqualify you.""

""What?"" Nicole was shocked. ""Who did I supposedly copy?""

""The piece matches a submission from Angela. She's a trending designer right now. Honestly, it's more likely the issue is on your end.""

Right away, Nicole remembered the way Angela had stared at her sketches earlier.

""I have the original,"" she said quickly.

But after hanging up, she searched everywhere. The manuscript was gone.

""Looking for this?""

Nicole spun around. Angela stood there, holding the manuscript.

""How did you get that?"" Nicole asked.

Angela gave a smug smile and twirled the manuscript. ""I said I liked it, and Cruz gave it to me.""

She leaned in and whispered, ""Cruz is into me. Just face the truth and stop dreaming about getting back with him. It's better for everyone if you let go now.""

Nicole's mind went blank. She stormed off to find Cruz, but he didn't even blink. ""I told you before—I don't like you doing this kind of stuff. If you'd listened and stopped, none of this would've happened.""

She stared at the man she had loved for seven years, her heart feeling like it was being cut open.

Why was he always like that?

He never cared about what she liked and never once considered how she felt.

If it weren't for those letters, she would've thought he never had feelings for her at all.

Nicole realized the original draft was gone, and arguing about it now wouldn't change anything. Everyone already saw her as a plagiarist.

She returned to her room in a daze and shut herself in the darkness.

It wasn't until her phone suddenly rang that she snapped out of her daze.

""Nicole! Are you coming back into the design world?"" Beatrice's voice rang with excitement. ""I saw your work at the competition!""

Nicole's voice cracked. ""Ms. Anderson, I didn't copy anyone...""

""I believe you,"" Beatrice replied right away. ""No one out there matches your talent. I've always known that.""

She sighed. ""It's such a waste you gave it all up because of Cruz.""

""I was dumb back then,"" Nicole admitted, brushing away tears. ""But I've already filed for divorce. I'm ready to start fresh.""

""That's great!"" Beatrice cheered. ""Wanna join my studio in Paris? All your seniors are there, and things are going great. If you come, we'll turn you into the brightest star in design!""

""Can I?""

""Of course! Who knows your talent better than me?"" Beatrice pretended to be angry. ""If you hadn't suddenly quit back then...""

Nicole took a deep breath. ""Okay, I'll go. I'll leave once the divorce goes through.""

Right after she said that, the door burst open. Cruz stood in the doorway, his expression dark and unreadable.

""Where do you want to go?""



Chapter 8

Nicole hung up quickly and forced herself to stay calm. ""You probably misheard.""

Cruz squinted at her, clearly suspicious, but he didn't push it.

Instead, he said, ""You and Angela have been tense lately because of the design stuff. I'll take you both to the amusement park tomorrow. It'll help you relax.""

Nicole wanted to say no right away, but she stopped herself.

She remembered how she used to beg him to go to amusement parks, and he always called them childish.

If she turned him down now, it might look weird.

""Alright,"" she responded softly.

The amusement park was packed with people.

Cruz stayed close to Angela, buckling her into the roller coaster, helping her onto the carousel, and even feeding her ice cream.

Nicole trailed behind like she wasn't even there.

Then, Cruz got a call from the company and stepped aside to take it. Angela suddenly grabbed Nicole's wrist. ""Let's try bungee jumping!""

Nicole instinctively pulled her hand back. ""I'm not going.""

""Cruz said we should get along,"" Angela whispered, stepping closer. ""Still mad about the design thing? You really hold grudges.""

People around them started staring curiously.

Nicole pursed her mouth, not wanting a scene. She gave in and followed Angela onto the ride.

Click!

The safety bar came down. Angela leaned close again. ""Oh, by the way, Cruz promised me a trip to the Maldives after the divorce goes through—""

Before she could finish, the ride went back violently.

""Ah!""

As soon as the seatbelt snapped, Nicole felt her body go weightless.

She and Angela plummeted from over ten meters high.

The air roared past her ears, and Nicole shut her eyes, bracing for the worst.

But the pain never came. Instead, she landed in a warm embrace.

When she opened her eyes, Cruz's panicked face was right there.

He held her tightly, his breathing ragged.

""You...""

She barely got the word out before Cruz quickly pulled away like he'd touched something hot.

""I grabbed the wrong person,"" he muttered awkwardly, then rushed over to Angela, who lay on the ground. ""Angela!""



\---

At the hospital, a doctor hurried up. ""She's losing a lot of blood and needs an urgent transfusion! The blood type is RH negative. The supply is low!""

Cruz immediately looked straight at Nicole.

""You're RH negative too."" That wasn't a question, but a statement.

Nicole leaned on the wall, her knee still bleeding. She met Cruz's eyes and suddenly understood what he wanted.

""Give blood,"" he said, stepping in close and whispering, ""If you do, I'll take back the divorce.""

His breath brushed past her ear. It smelled cold and familiar.

There was a time when being that close would've made her heart flutter.

Now, all it did was make her feel empty.

When the nurse handed over the consent form, Nicole signed it right away.

She couldn't let Cruz start suspecting anything—not when she had plans to leave for Paris.

She had to play it safe.

As the needle went in, she turned her head away, watching the blood slowly drip into the bag.

One bag filled, then another.

""Stop right there!"" the nurse suddenly called out. ""She's already at her limit!""

Nicole's vision blurred, and her ears rang.

Everything felt hazy. She saw Cruz standing nearby, frowning. His mouth was moving, but she couldn't hear a word.

Chapter 9

The white walls of the hospital hurt my eyes.

After Nicole had finished the blood transfusion, the doctor insisted that she stay in the hospital for observation. However, Cruz never came to see her once.

The phone kept vibrating, it was a photo sent by Angela.

The photo of Cruz feeding her porridge.

A photo of Cruz standing by the sickbed.

When Cruz was asleep, she stole a photo of him kissing his cheek.

Nicole deleted one by one, her heart no longer wavering.

When the heart dies completely, even the sense of pain will disappear.

On the last day of the waiting period, Nicole woke up early.

The sunlight streamed in through the curtains as she packed the last piece of clothing into her suitcase.

The plane tickets to Paris lay quietly in the bag, for the flight at three in the afternoon.

At that moment, the doorbell suddenly rang.

Cruz stood at the doorway, dressed sharply in a suit, as if he had just returned from an important meeting.

""Angela is out of danger,"" he cut to the chase. ""I promised to accompany you to withdraw the application, and I will keep my word.""

Nicole quietly watched him.

""However,"" Cruz added, ""if you make the same mistake again next time, I will still bring up divorce.""

Nicole suddenly felt like laughing.

There will be no next time.

She was about to embark on her own journey of life.

Along the way, the two of them remained silent.

Nicole tightened her grip on the bag strap until the car stopped in front of the courthouse.

""We're here,"" Cruz unbuckled his seatbelt, ""Hurry up, I still need to go to the hospital to see Angela.""

Nicole looked at the familiar glass doors of the courthouse, absentmindedly running her fingertips along the edge of her phone.

She needed to find a way to distract Cruz and make sure he didn't follow them inside.

""I...""

Just as he started speaking, Cruz's phone began to ring.

""Angela?"" he frowned as he picked up the phone, ""What's wrong? Don't cry, I'll be right over.""

Hanging up the phone, Cruz turned to Nicole and said, ""Angela is feeling unstable, I need to go over there first. You go in and cancel the application yourself, and let me know when it's done.""

Nicole lowered her eyelashes, hiding the relief in her eyes: ""Okay.""

She watched as Cruz's car sped away, then turned and walked into the courthouse.

The familiar clerk greeted with a smile, ""Ms. Quinn, coming to withdraw your application again?""

""No,"" Nicole took out the prepared documents from her bag, ""I came to pick up the Divorce Certificate today.""

When she got home, Nicole placed the Divorce Certificate belonging to Cruz on the coffee table and picked up the already packed suitcase.

The closing sound of the door was very soft, but it felt like a knife, completely cutting off seven years of infatuation.

On the way to the airport, the sun was shining brightly.

Nicole rolled down the car window, closed her eyes slowly, and felt the taste of happy in the air.

Goodbye, Cruz.

Nicole glanced at Cruz's cold figure walking away and told herself inwardly.  
Would not cancel this time.  
When the 30-day waiting period ended, it would finally be official.  
The wind outside the courthouse was biting. Nicole stepped out and watched Cruz slip into his sleek black car without even glancing back at her.  
She walked slowly along the sidewalk. It felt like something inside her had been ripped open, and the cold air just poured in.  
Suddenly, screeching tires rang out behind her.  
Before she could react, she was shoved to the ground. Her knees throbbed, and her palms burned.  
Looking up through messy hair, she saw Cruz's friends scrambling out of the car.  
""Crap! We just hit Mrs. Yarbrough!""  
""Stop calling her that,"" someone muttered. ""They're getting divorced. Cruz hasn't agreed to cancel it yet.""  
Nicole tried to stand, her legs trembling. Through her messy bangs, she saw the rear window of the car rolled halfway down. Cruz's cold profile was just barely visible in the shadows.  
One of the guys asked, ""Should we take her to the hospital first, or just head to the party?""  
Time froze for a moment. Nicole stared at that car window, her heart aching.  
""To the party."" Cruz's cold voice came through the car window.  
Those simple words cut deeper than a knife.  
The car sped off, the exhaust fumes hitting her face.  
Gritting her teeth, Nicole pulled herself up and limped all the way home.  
Every step made her knees scream, but that was nothing compared to the way her heart felt—shredded and raw.  
As soon as she got home, she started packing.  
She pulled out everything that reminded her of their years together.  
The jewelry he casually threw to her, the lighter he used that she secretly kept, the jar of 999 paper stars she folded for him...  
One by one, she tossed them all in the trash. Then, she pulled out a paper bag from the deepest part of the drawer.  
Her hands shook as she opened it again, even though she'd seen what was inside.  
They were Cruz's love letters.  
""You brought breakfast again today. But you didn't know I got up at five just to watch you quietly set it by my window.  
""Your handwriting in those letters is terrible, but I kept them. I'll tease you about them on our 50th anniversary.  
""That red dress looked good, but I wish no one else could see you in it.  
""You've been chasing me for three years. I almost gave in. But I wanted to hold out a bit longer and enjoy being pursued.""  
Every line felt like a punch to the heart.  
If she hadn't randomly found those love letters a few days earlier, she never would've believed that Cruz, who'd always acted cold and distant, actually liked her.  
The first time Nicole saw Cruz was during their university's opening ceremony.  
He was speaking onstage as the student rep, looking sharp and untouchable.  
With just a glance, she fell in love.  
Many people pursued Cruz, but Nicole was the most stubborn one.  
She kept bringing him breakfast, even though he never touched it. She memorized all his classes just to run into him. When he got hurt playing basketball, she climbed over the wall to get him medicine and ended up breaking her wrist for it.  
She spent four years and 1,460 days chasing after him until they finally got together.  
Even then, he was still distant, never showing much warmth. She even proposed to him first, and she didn't mind.  
But after three years of marriage, Cruz had already asked for a divorce 99 times.  
The first time was over salty food. He said she couldn't even handle something that simple.  
The second was because he didn't like her dress.  
  
\---  
The 98th time they almost split was over a rule he made. She could only text him ten times a day, and she accidentally sent one extra ""good night.""  
Every time, she ended up begging him not to go through with the divorce.  
On the 99th try, she stayed on her knees in his study the entire night. Only then did he reluctantly agree to cancel it.  
That same night, she stumbled across a paper bag inside his locked safe.  
Inside were handwritten letters Cruz had penned for her, all the way back from when she first started chasing after him.  
It turned out that he'd had feelings for her all along.  
It turned out that all those divorce threats were just ways to make her cry, to keep her begging him not to leave.  
He craved her love, but treated her devotion like a toy to pass the time.  
The next day, Cruz filed for divorce for the 100th time.  
This time, it was over a cookie. She'd eaten one in his car and left behind a few crumbs.  
Nicole looked at the guy she'd been in love with for seven years and suddenly felt like she didn't even know him anymore.  
This time, she was done playing along with him.  
She wasn't going to lower herself again as he wished.  
It was completely over between them.  
She wiped her face roughly and went back to packing her suitcase.  
But halfway through, she realized something was missing.  
Her deceased mother's old silver necklace, the only thing she had left, was gone.  
Nicole turned the whole walk-in closet upside down, even checked under the bed, but the necklace was nowhere to be found. It was like it had just vanished.  
She sank to the floor, unconsciously gripping the edge of her shirt. Besides her, the only person who had been in the study was Cruz.  
Recalling what she overheard back at the courthouse, she bit her mouth, grabbed her coat, and walked out.  
Outside the private room at the club, loud voices and laughter could be heard clearly, even through the thick door.  
""I bet five days! No way Nicole makes it past that without begging Cruz to remarry her!""  
""Five? That's generous. Everyone knows she's hopeless without him. I'm going with three.""  
""I say just one! She was on her knees the last time!""  
""Cruz, what's your guess?""  
The room suddenly got quiet. Cruz sat in the centre, slowly swirling his whiskey, his expression unreadable.  
Right before he could answer, the door burst open. Nicole stepped in and said, ""It's forever.""  
  
Chapter 2  
Right as Nicole spoke, a soft voice cut in over hers.  
""Sorry, I'm late.""  
Angela Simpson strolled in, instantly drawing everyone's attention.  
With a sweet smile, she clung to Cruz's arm and leaned into him affectionately.  
Nicole looked at their intimate posture and tremblingly closed her eyes.  
Angela had been around since Cruz was a kid. From when he first started dating to his marriage to Nicole, Angela never left their lives.  
He never told her to back off. He even let her cross the line repeatedly, like it was nothing.  
Nicole used to wonder if Cruz had real feelings for Angela.  
But after reading those love letters, it finally clicked.  
Angela was just a way to make Nicole jealous.  
Cruz enjoyed seeing her jealousy.  
That was when he noticed Nicole standing at the door and frowned. ""Why are you here?""  
Nicole gripped the strap of her bag and realized he hadn't even heard her words.  
""My necklace is missing,"" she said, locking eyes with him. ""I just want to know if you've seen it.""  
Cruz froze for a second, then his mood shifted. ""That's it?""  
""What else would it be?"" Nicole asked, ""What do you think I'm here for?""  
His expression instantly darkened.  
Nicole was familiar with that expression.  
He always made it whenever she didn't play along with whatever version of the story he'd made up in his mind.  
""That silver necklace?"" Angela suddenly interrupted, ""I told Cruz I liked it, so he gave it to me.""  
She tilted her head like she was being innocent. ""But I lost it on the way home.""  
Nicole's head started spinning as she snapped, ""You gave her my necklace?!""  
""It's just a necklace,"" Cruz cut in coldly. ""Why are you getting so worked up? I'll purchase you ten more if you want.""  
""That's my mom's keepsake!"" Nicole shouted, her voice shaking.  
The whole room went dead silent.  
Cruz looked taken aback at first, but he quickly went back to his usual indifferent look. ""It's already gone. What do you expect me to do? Don't make a fuss.""  
Nicole bit her mouth so hard they started to bleed.  
She'd told him it was her mother's keepsake, and he still thought she was just overreacting.  
Did he like her in this way?  
Realizing she'd never see that necklace again, she turned around and walked away. If she stayed any longer, she might break down right there.  
Behind her, a chair scraped across the floor. Cruz got up. ""That's enough. Let's head out.""  
He came after her.  
Outside the club, the wind cut against Nicole's face like tiny blades.  
She kept her head down and moved fast, not wanting anyone to notice her red, puffy eyes.  
Then, she heard a strange creaking sound above.  
Before she could look up, someone behind her yelled, ""Watch out!""  
Nicole's eyes shot up. A giant billboard was crashing down toward them.  
Cruz dashed toward her without hesitation.  
But when their eyes met, he swerved at the last second and threw himself over Angela instead.  
Bang!  
Pain exploded through her body, and all Nicole could feel was how pathetic she was.  
He'd rather let her get hurt than let anyone see he might care.  
When she finally came to, all she saw was a plain white ceiling.  
Nicole slowly turned her head, but the ward was empty.  
""You're awake,"" a nurse said as she walked in to change her bandages. ""You've been out for two days. Good thing it was just a minor concussion.""  
Nicole's throat burned. ""Who brought me in?""  
""Your husband,"" the nurse replied while adjusting the IV. ""He was freaking out. You were covered in blood, and he looked like he was gonna lose it. But as soon as the doctor said you'd be okay, he rushed off. He said he had something urgent. Strange, right?""  
Nicole shut her eyes and gave a tired, bitter smile.  
She wasn't shocked at all.  
He'd never let her see how he truly felt.  
  
Chapter 3  
Cruz didn't show up for a few days.  
It wasn't until Nicole was getting discharged that he finally showed his face again.  
Angela was with him, smiling as she clung to his arm.  
""Wow, Nicole, you bounced back fast. I've been sickly since I was a child. I only caught a little cold, but Cruz freaked out,"" Angela said in a sweet voice. ""He dragged me here for a checkup.""  
Nicole kept folding her clothes, not even glancing up.  
Cruz couldn't stop staring, like he was trying to read her face.  
Then out of nowhere, he said, ""Good timing. We can give you a ride back. Angela's place is getting redone, so she's gonna stay with us for a while.""  
Nicole zipped her suitcase and said, ""Whatever.""  
It didn't matter. Once the month-long waiting period ended, they'd be done for good.  
Cruz could let whoever he wanted move in. It was none of her business.  
Her lack of reaction seemed to darken his mood.  
When they got back to the villa, he acted like he was mad, being all lovey-dovey with Angela right in front of Nicole.  
But no matter what tricks he tried, she just didn't care.  
At dinner, Cruz peeled shrimp and hand-fed Angela.  
Nicole kept eating, but it all tasted bland and dry, like chewing paper.  
""Ah!"" Angela yelped, scratching at her skin. ""It itches!""  
Nicole looked up and noticed a red rash spreading across Angela's neck. Her breathing was also getting worse.  
Cruz rushed over and scooped her up. ""Call the doctor!""  
The doctor came fast and said it was a peanut allergy.  
Cruz glared and called over the maid, voice cold. ""I told you many times that Angela can't have peanuts! Why was there peanut butter in the food?""  
The maid looked down, fidgeting with her apron and stealing a glance at Nicole. ""Mrs. Yarbrough told me to. I'm sorry, Mr. Yarbrough. I'm just the maid.""  
Nicole stood up in shock. The chair scraped loudly on the floor. ""When did I ever—""  
""Please, Mrs. Yarbrough, stop making excuses!"" the maid suddenly yelled, cutting her off. ""You told me you didn't want Ms. Simpson here, and you were jealous of Mr. Yarbrough's attention. You told me to teach her a lesson.""  
""Nicole.""  
Cruz's voice was sharp, and the dining room felt like it dropped ten degrees.  
He walked toward her, his shoes clicking hard on the marble floor.  
""You've been quiet since the courthouse. I figured you'd learned your lesson."" He stared down at her, like he could see straight through her. ""Guess I was wrong.""  
Nicole was about to respond, but she suddenly froze.  
She caught a tiny smirk at the corner of Cruz's mouth. It was quick, but it was there.  
""Since you want Angela to suffer..."" Cruz said as he turned and pulled a heavy bottle of liquor from the wine shelf. The bottle hit the table with a sharp clink. ""Then it's only fair you get a taste too.""  
Nicole's whole body went numb as her back pressed against the icy wall.  
He had always known she had reaction to spirits.  
Two guards stepped up and grabbed her by the shoulders, squeezing hard enough to make her flinch in pain.  
When the spirit slid down her throat, it felt like fire spreading from her mouth to her stomach.  
She coughed violently, her eyes filling with tears, yet somehow, she still ended up swallowing half the bottle.  
That horrible itching started immediately, rising from deep under her skin.  
Large red rashes started spreading across her neck and arms. Breathing got harder by the second, and her vision started to fade.  
Right before everything went black, Nicole caught one last image—Cruz standing there in the glow, wearing a faint smile.  
He was actually smiling.  
When she came to, the bedroom was dim, lit only by a soft wall lamp.  
Cruz was sitting on the bed, flipping through some documents. He didn't even glance up until he heard her move.  
""Oh, you're awake."" He shut the folder and spoke. ""Don't do that again.""  
Nicole tried to sit up. Her throat felt raw and sore.  
She saw Cruz's relieved expression, and something clicked. Her heart tightened.  
It didn't matter to him if Angela had an allergy or not.  
What bothered him was her acting cold lately, and what made him happy was seeing her get jealous.  
It was just like those letters he kept locked up. He got a kick out of watching her lose control over him.  
Unfortunately, she was done playing that game.  
There were two more weeks to go.  
After that, they'd officially divorce and go their separate ways.  
  
Chapter 4  
Angela's design won first prize two days later.  
Cruz went all out and threw a fancy party to celebrate.  
He stayed close to her the whole night under the shiny lights, stepping in when people offered drinks and even fixing her dress for her. He acted sweet and thoughtful.  
People whispered all around, saying how Cruz treated his childhood friend well, but he couldn't care less about his wife. They said if Nicole hadn't kept trying to save the relationship, their marriage would've ended long ago.  
Nicole stood alone, swirling her drink and ignoring the whispers.  
Midway through the event, she stepped out to the lake for some air.  
The cool wind helped clear out the smell of spirits.  
""You finally hit your limit, huh?""  
Angela's voice rang out behind Nicole, dripping with smugness.  
She strutted over in heels, smiling sarcastically. ""If I were you, I would've walked away a long time ago.""  
Nicole didn't even turn around. ""Get lost.""  
Angela sneered. ""Don't act like you don't care. You've chased Cruz for four years, been married three, and he still doesn't care about you. It's honestly sad. Want to bet? Even if I shoved you in the lake, he wouldn't even blink.""  
As the words fell, Nicole felt a hard shove.  
Splash!  
Freezing water rushed over her face. She tried to scream, but water filled her mouth and nose.  
Through her fading vision, she saw someone sprint toward her and dive in.  
""Nicole!""  
Cruz sounded more panicked than ever. He rushed through the water, holding her tightly around the waist.  
Nicole looked into his eyes and got lost for a second. He looked so fearful that it almost didn't feel real.  
On the shore, Angela just stood there, frozen in disbelief. She couldn't believe what she was seeing.  
Cruz, who usually treated Nicole like she didn't matter, had dived into the lake crazily.  
The way he held onto her was like he was afraid of losing something precious.  
Angela couldn't wrap her head around it.  
She thought she must have seen it wrong.  
Once they were back on land, Cruz dropped to the ground and started giving Nicole CPR. His fingers were visibly shaking. He didn't relax until she coughed up water.  
Then suddenly, his face changed. It was like he caught himself feeling too much.  
He stood up straight, shoved his emotions aside, and spoke coldly, ""How do you even end up falling in at a party?""  
Nicole sat there, drenched. She gripped the fabric of her dress tightly, and her voice came out sharp. ""I didn't fall. Angela pushed me.""  
Angela's eyes instantly turned red. She shook her head hard. ""Nicole, I didn't do that! How could you slander me?""  
""Fine."" Nicole sneered. With shaky hands, she pulled out her phone. ""If you're not gonna admit it, let's have the police solve it. You tried to end me—there's a price for that.""  
Just as she went to call, Cruz grabbed her wrist.  
""That's enough,"" he whispered, gripping so hard it hurt. ""Angela didn't mean to. Don't blow this up.""  
Nicole abruptly looked up in disbelief. ""She almost drowned me.""  
""And yet, you're still alive, aren't you?"" he said more firmly, squinting. ""Stop creating drama.""  
It was so absurd that it almost made her laugh.  
She knew Cruz was just using Angela to get a reaction out of her.  
But she didn't expect he'd go so far as to ignore her life.  
""I'm not being dramatic,"" she said, voice steady, pressing her thumb toward the call button. ""I'm calling the cops.""  
""Enough!"" Cruz snapped, yanking the phone away. ""You're not thinking straight. Go cool off.""  
Then, he called over a bodyguard. ""Put her in the confinement room. She can come out once she's calmed down.""  
Nicole fought hard as the bodyguard pulled her toward the confinement room.  
""Cruz! Have you lost your mind?!"" she screamed, voice cracking. ""She tried to end me! You know it!""  
Her nails dug into the bodyguard's arm, leaving bloody marks. Her heels slipped off in the scuffle.  
But he was too strong. She was like a butterfly trapped in someone's fingers. No matter how hard she tried, it didn't work.  
The door slammed shut behind her, and her eyes abruptly contracted.  
The tiny room of less than three square meters had no windows. Darkness poured in like a flood and swallowed her whole.  
""Let me out..."" Her voice shook as it left her mouth.  
Something invisible was tightening around her neck—claustrophobia hitting hard.  
Her mind flashed back to when she was ten. She was locked in a basement for three days by her stepmother.  
That same despair—like the whole world had turned its back on her—hit her again after all these years.  
Nicole sat huddled in the corner, her fingernails digging painfully into her palms.  
She could hear a mouse scurrying somewhere in the dark. Clamping her mouth shut, she didn't even dare to breathe too loudly.  
Time stopped making sense. Maybe it was an hour; maybe a day.  
She pushed away the food they gave her and knocked over the glass of water.  
Her throat burned like it was on fire, but it was the mental torment that broke her down, not the thirst.  
When the door finally opened the next day, the sudden brightness made her squeeze her eyes shut.  
""Still holding on to that?"" Cruz's voice came from above.  
She barely lifted her head and saw him standing there against the light.  
He still had on that same spotless suit, not even a wrinkle on the cuffs, while she looked disheveled and unkempt like a mad woman.  
Out of nowhere, Nicole let out a laugh, and tears streamed down her face. ""I won't hold on to that anymore...""  
Her voice was barely there. ""I don't want anything anymore.""  
All she wanted now was to be released—get away from Cruz, from Angela, and from this place that was tearing her apart.  
Cruz frowned when he saw how off she seemed. Something about it made him uneasy.  
Still, his face quickly went back to being indifferent. ""Hope you stick to that.""  
He turned around and walked away, not noticing the resolute look in her eyes.  
  
Chapter 5  
Nicole stumbled back into the room, collapsed face-down on the bed, and buried herself in the blankets.  
She thought the tears had dried up, but they still slipped out and soaked the pillow.  
She curled up tightly like a shrimp, even breathing hurt.  
She stayed like that, dazed, until the next day. Eventually, she got up, ate something without tasting it, and drank some water.  
Then her phone buzzed. It was a message in her old university group chat.  
""Class reunion tonight at seven at the Crown Hotel! Hope to see everyone there!""  
Nicole stared blankly at the screen.  
Since she'd be leaving soon anyway, it would be the last time she'd see any of them. She might as well treat it as a goodbye.  
The Crown Hotel was all lit up and glowing. Nicole lightly covered her swollen eyes with some makeup and picked out a plain white dress.  
""Nicole!"" Yvonne Lawrence, her university roommate, waved her over. ""This way!""  
A group of old classmates sat around, asking how she'd been.  
Yvonne winked and said, ""You chased after Cruz back then. Did you ever get him?""  
A few others looked over, clearly curious.  
Nicole's fingers paused mid-movement.  
Back then, everyone knew she was chasing after Cruz. But he didn't agree to be with her until after graduation, so barely anyone knew they were together.  
And Cruz had always hated the idea of a wedding. He never even gave her one.  
""I didn't,"" she said, smiling faintly.  
If she had the chance to start over, she'd never want to meet him at all.  
""No way! He didn't even go for someone as pretty as you?"" someone blurted. ""He must have crazy high standards!""  
""Don't be sad,"" Yvonne said, already pulling out her phone. ""I know a few great guys I can set you up with!""  
""What are you matchmaking for?""  
A cold, deep voice spoke from behind.  
Nicole froze and turned to see Cruz and Angela standing a short distance away.  
Cruz wore a sharp black suit, and the diamond pin on his tie caught the light.  
""Cruz?!"" the group gasped.  
Angela clung to his arm, glowing in a stunning red dress.  
Their entrance immediately stole all the attention in the room.  
""Is this... your girlfriend?"" someone asked.  
Angela gave a shy smile, and Cruz didn't say a word.  
The room quickly filled with excited chatter.  
""As expected! The most popular guy in school should end up with a gorgeous girl. They're a perfect match!""  
Nicole quietly sipped her water, acting like she didn't hear any of it.  
Cruz's eyes were locked on her, sharp as blades.  
The vibe picked back up. People broke into smaller groups, swapping stories and memories.  
Then, someone suggested playing truth or dare. After a few spins, the bottle pointed straight at Angela.  
""I choose to dare!"" she said sweetly, sneaking a glance at Cruz.  
""Kiss a guy here for ten seconds!""  
As soon as the dare was announced, the room erupted in playful booing.  
Angela blushed as she nervously played with the edge of her dress, but she still walked straight over to Cruz.  
He sat back lazily on the couch, but his eyes drifted past everyone and landed on Nicole, who was quietly scrolling on her phone.  
She didn't even flinch.  
His gaze turned icy.  
""Cruz..."" Angela stood right in front of him, shyly biting her mouth.  
Everyone watched as Cruz suddenly pulled her in and kissed her hard.  
""Wow—""  
The crowd exploded.  
The kiss went way past ten seconds. Cruz even made sure it sounded intense.  
Nicole finally glanced up, but she just gave him a calm look before turning back to her screen.  
His expression instantly darkened.  
  
Chapter 6  
After that, Cruz became even more affectionate with Angela.  
He fed her, hugged her waist, and whispered in her ear.  
But now and then, his gaze would unconsciously drift back to Nicole.  
She didn't even flinch.  
Once the party ended, Nicole headed to the restroom to fix her makeup.  
Just as she stepped out, Angela appeared at the corridor corner and blocked her way.  
""Did you see this?"" Angela waved her phone with a smug grin. The screen showed a photo of her and Cruz kissing. ""Cruz is into me. So do yourself a favor and sign those divorce papers. Don't embarrass yourself by begging this time.""  
Nicole didn't even spare Angela a glance. She walked past her without a word.  
Angela's face twisted in anger. She'd planned the whole thing, and now it felt like a complete joke.  
She clenched her jaw, ready to slap Nicole. But then, she heard familiar footsteps coming down the corridor.  
Changing her mind, she immediately switched tactics.  
The sound of slaps echoed through the restroom. Angela slapped herself hard twice. Her cheeks turned red and swollen within seconds.  
Right after, the door flew open.  
""Cruz!"" she cried, bursting into tears and running straight into his arms. ""Nicole hit me...""  
She complained through sobs, ""All because I was just playing around with you earlier...""  
Cruz held Angela, but his eyes locked on Nicole.  
He had been wondering why Nicole seemed so unaffected by his and Angela's intimacy all night. Now it made sense.  
She was secretly jealous.  
That thought made something stir inside him, like he was secretly satisfied. But his face stayed cold.  
""It was just a game. Why get so worked up?"" he said icily. ""And besides, we're divorced now. What I do is none of your business.""  
He stared at Nicole's pale face. ""Hurting Angela won't help. If you want another shot at us, show your sincerity.""  
""I didn't hit her,"" Nicole replied calmly. ""She was the one who—""  
""Enough!"" Cruz snapped. ""If you're going to play these little games, then reflect on yourself here tonight.""  
Bang!  
He slammed the door shut. The loud click of the lock followed.  
Nicole pounded on the door, her palms turning red and numb from the force.  
After a long time, she finally heard the lock click open.  
She breathed a sigh of relief, ready to leave. But before she could go far, three men stepped out from the shadows and cornered her.  
The leader yanked her hair and asked viciously, ""Are you Nicole?""  
""No, I'm not,"" she said quickly, sensing danger. She tried to bolt, but a punch slammed into her stomach.  
The pain doubled her over. Before she could catch her breath, someone else yanked her up by the hair.  
A harsh slap made her ears ring, and blood trickled from the corner of her mouth.  
""You've got a face, sure, but no shame, huh?"" The leader grabbed her chin and smacked her face frivolously with his other hand. ""We'll teach you a lesson today!""  
They started beating her without mercy.  
Nicole dropped to the ground, curling up and trying to shield her head.  
She heard something snap in her ribs. The pain was blinding, but she clamped her mouth shut, refusing to make a sound.  
""Hey, that's enough. Don't end her,"" one of them finally said. ""Ms. Simpson just wanted her roughed up.""  
Their footsteps faded, leaving her crumpled on the cold ground. Her whole body screamed in pain.  
Nicole tried to wiggle her fingers, but even that made her break into a cold sweat.  
Then, she heard Angela's mocking laugh echo down the corridor. ""Let's see if she keeps acting all high and mighty now.""  
Nicole struggled to turn over and stared up at the harsh, blinding ceiling lights.  
A single drop of blood slid down her forehead. Yet somehow, she smiled.  
So this was what Cruz wanted?  
He might've had feelings for her. But deep down, he wanted her wrecked, crushed, and stuck in a life that felt worse than dying.  
He got what he wanted.  
But it'd be the last time.  
  
Chapter 7  
Nicole barely made it through the door, her body aching all over. From upstairs, she heard Angela's sweet voice floating down.  
""Cruz, there's thunder tonight. Can you stay with me until I fall asleep?""  
Gripping the railing tightly, Nicole climbed the stairs, her body screaming with pain. Cold sweat beaded on her forehead with every step.  
Cruz was about to refuse. But when he saw Nicole, he changed his mind. ""Sure.""  
He slipped his arm around Angela and led her into the main bedroom like Nicole didn't even exist.  
Nicole smiled bitterly and dragged herself into the guest room without a word.  
Over the next few days, she stayed home and focused all her energy on a design competition.  
It was the path she wanted to reclaim once the divorce was finalized.  
Back in college, Nicole had been the top student in her department. Her instructor, Beatrice Anderson, once said she would shape the future of the design world.  
But that dream came crashing down after Cruz saw a coworker drop her off one day.  
""Quit your job or end the marriage,"" he said coldly.  
Without arguing, she resigned. Now, she was finally sketching again.  
As she was adjusting the final touches on her design, the door suddenly opened.  
Cruz came in with Angela. The moment he noticed the sketches, his expression darkened.  
""I told you I don't want you doing this stuff,"" he said, grabbing her paintbrush. ""If you're hoping I'll reconsider the divorce, then stop right here.""  
Nicole looked at him and almost laughed.  
Did he still think threats would work on her?  
She didn't say a word—just calmly packed up her drawings.  
Cruz thought she had given in and walked out, looking satisfied.  
Angela, though, paused for a moment, her eyes lingering on the draft with visible interest.  
Three days after she submitted her design draft, Nicole got a call from the organizer.  
Ms. Quinn, your work may be plagiarized. If you can't prove it yourself, we'll have to disqualify you.""  
""What?"" Nicole was shocked. ""Who did I supposedly copy?""  
""The piece matches a submission from Angela. She's a trending designer right now. Honestly, it's more likely the issue is on your end.""  
Right away, Nicole remembered the way Angela had stared at her sketches earlier.  
""I have the original,"" she said quickly.  
But after hanging up, she searched everywhere. The manuscript was gone.  
""Looking for this?""  
Nicole spun around. Angela stood there, holding the manuscript.  
""How did you get that?"" Nicole asked.  
Angela gave a smug smile and twirled the manuscript. ""I said I liked it, and Cruz gave it to me.""  
She leaned in and whispered, ""Cruz is into me. Just face the truth and stop dreaming about getting back with him. It's better for everyone if you let go now.""  
Nicole's mind went blank. She stormed off to find Cruz, but he didn't even blink. ""I told you before—I don't like you doing this kind of stuff. If you'd listened and stopped, none of this would've happened.""  
She stared at the man she had loved for seven years, her heart feeling like it was being cut open.  
Why was he always like that?  
He never cared about what she liked and never once considered how she felt.  
If it weren't for those letters, she would've thought he never had feelings for her at all.  
Nicole realized the original draft was gone, and arguing about it now wouldn't change anything. Everyone already saw her as a plagiarist.  
She returned to her room in a daze and shut herself in the darkness.  
It wasn't until her phone suddenly rang that she snapped out of her daze.  
""Nicole! Are you coming back into the design world?"" Beatrice's voice rang with excitement. ""I saw your work at the competition!""  
Nicole's voice cracked. ""Ms. Anderson, I didn't copy anyone...""  
""I believe you,"" Beatrice replied right away. ""No one out there matches your talent. I've always known that.""  
She sighed. ""It's such a waste you gave it all up because of Cruz.""  
""I was dumb back then,"" Nicole admitted, brushing away tears. ""But I've already filed for divorce. I'm ready to start fresh.""  
""That's great!"" Beatrice cheered. ""Wanna join my studio in Paris? All your seniors are there, and things are going great. If you come, we'll turn you into the brightest star in design!""  
""Can I?""  
""Of course! Who knows your talent better than me?"" Beatrice pretended to be angry. ""If you hadn't suddenly quit back then...""  
Nicole took a deep breath. ""Okay, I'll go. I'll leave once the divorce goes through.""  
Right after she said that, the door burst open. Cruz stood in the doorway, his expression dark and unreadable.  
""Where do you want to go?""  
  
Chapter 8  
Nicole hung up quickly and forced herself to stay calm. ""You probably misheard.""  
Cruz squinted at her, clearly suspicious, but he didn't push it.  
Instead, he said, ""You and Angela have been tense lately because of the design stuff. I'll take you both to the amusement park tomorrow. It'll help you relax.""  
Nicole wanted to say no right away, but she stopped herself.  
She remembered how she used to beg him to go to amusement parks, and he always called them childish.  
If she turned him down now, it might look weird.  
""Alright,"" she responded softly.  
The amusement park was packed with people.  
Cruz stayed close to Angela, buckling her into the roller coaster, helping her onto the carousel, and even feeding her ice cream.  
Nicole trailed behind like she wasn't even there.  
Then, Cruz got a call from the company and stepped aside to take it. Angela suddenly grabbed Nicole's wrist. ""Let's try bungee jumping!""  
Nicole instinctively pulled her hand back. ""I'm not going.""  
""Cruz said we should get along,"" Angela whispered, stepping closer. ""Still mad about the design thing? You really hold grudges.""  
People around them started staring curiously.  
Nicole pursed her mouth, not wanting a scene. She gave in and followed Angela onto the ride.  
Click!  
The safety bar came down. Angela leaned close again. ""Oh, by the way, Cruz promised me a trip to the Maldives after the divorce goes through—""  
Before she could finish, the ride went back violently.  
""Ah!""  
As soon as the seatbelt snapped, Nicole felt her body go weightless.  
She and Angela plummeted from over ten meters high.  
The air roared past her ears, and Nicole shut her eyes, bracing for the worst.  
But the pain never came. Instead, she landed in a warm embrace.  
When she opened her eyes, Cruz's panicked face was right there.  
He held her tightly, his breathing ragged.  
""You...""  
She barely got the word out before Cruz quickly pulled away like he'd touched something hot.  
""I grabbed the wrong person,"" he muttered awkwardly, then rushed over to Angela, who lay on the ground. ""Angela!""  
  
\---  
At the hospital, a doctor hurried up. ""She's losing a lot of blood and needs an urgent transfusion! The blood type is RH negative. The supply is low!""  
Cruz immediately looked straight at Nicole.  
""You're RH negative too."" That wasn't a question, but a statement.  
Nicole leaned on the wall, her knee still bleeding. She met Cruz's eyes and suddenly understood what he wanted.  
""Give blood,"" he said, stepping in close and whispering, ""If you do, I'll take back the divorce.""  
His breath brushed past her ear. It smelled cold and familiar.  
There was a time when being that close would've made her heart flutter.  
Now, all it did was make her feel empty.  
When the nurse handed over the consent form, Nicole signed it right away.  
She couldn't let Cruz start suspecting anything—not when she had plans to leave for Paris.  
She had to play it safe.  
As the needle went in, she turned her head away, watching the blood slowly drip into the bag.  
One bag filled, then another.  
""Stop right there!"" the nurse suddenly called out. ""She's already at her limit!""  
Nicole's vision blurred, and her ears rang.  
Everything felt hazy. She saw Cruz standing nearby, frowning. His mouth was moving, but she couldn't hear a word.  
Chapter 9  
The white walls of the hospital hurt my eyes.  
After Nicole had finished the blood transfusion, the doctor insisted that she stay in the hospital for observation. However, Cruz never came to see her once.  
The phone kept vibrating, it was a photo sent by Angela.  
The photo of Cruz feeding her porridge.  
A photo of Cruz standing by the sickbed.  
When Cruz was asleep, she stole a photo of him kissing his cheek.  
Nicole deleted one by one, her heart no longer wavering.  
When the heart dies completely, even the sense of pain will disappear.  
On the last day of the waiting period, Nicole woke up early.  
The sunlight streamed in through the curtains as she packed the last piece of clothing into her suitcase.  
The plane tickets to Paris lay quietly in the bag, for the flight at three in the afternoon.  
At that moment, the doorbell suddenly rang.  
Cruz stood at the doorway, dressed sharply in a suit, as if he had just returned from an important meeting.  
""Angela is out of danger,"" he cut to the chase. ""I promised to accompany you to withdraw the application, and I will keep my word.""  
Nicole quietly watched him.  
""However,"" Cruz added, ""if you make the same mistake again next time, I will still bring up divorce.""  
Nicole suddenly felt like laughing.  
There will be no next time.  
She was about to embark on her own journey of life.  
Along the way, the two of them remained silent.  
Nicole tightened her grip on the bag strap until the car stopped in front of the courthouse.  
""We're here,"" Cruz unbuckled his seatbelt, ""Hurry up, I still need to go to the hospital to see Angela.""  
Nicole looked at the familiar glass doors of the courthouse, absentmindedly running her fingertips along the edge of her phone.  
She needed to find a way to distract Cruz and make sure he didn't follow them inside.  
""I...""  
Just as he started speaking, Cruz's phone began to ring.  
""Angela?"" he frowned as he picked up the phone, ""What's wrong? Don't cry, I'll be right over.""  
Hanging up the phone, Cruz turned to Nicole and said, ""Angela is feeling unstable, I need to go over there first. You go in and cancel the application yourself, and let me know when it's done.""  
Nicole lowered her eyelashes, hiding the relief in her eyes: ""Okay.""  
She watched as Cruz's car sped away, then turned and walked into the courthouse.  
The familiar clerk greeted with a smile, ""Ms. Quinn, coming to withdraw your application again?""  
""No,"" Nicole took out the prepared documents from her bag, ""I came to pick up the Divorce Certificate today.""  
When she got home, Nicole placed the Divorce Certificate belonging to Cruz on the coffee table and picked up the already packed suitcase.  
The closing sound of the door was very soft, but it felt like a knife, completely cutting off seven years of infatuation.  
On the way to the airport, the sun was shining brightly.  
Nicole rolled down the car window, closed her eyes slowly, and felt the taste of happy in the air.  
Goodbye, Cruz.

I am *not* a coffee drinker at all, never have been! I’m in my 40s in the US but it’s just too bitter to me. So why in the world I purchased a Nespresso Vertuo Pop is beyond me!! It was on an amazing Prime Day sale and I do love “cappuccinos.” Placed in quotes because the ones I like would cause any European cappuccino drinker to scoff at me in disgust and disbelief at the term “cappuccino” even being associated with this beverage, but it’s the kind you get at places like 7-11, Royal Farms, Sheetz, or Wawa (aka gas stations’ powdered hot beverage machines). 

So now I need to find a type of Nespresso pod with the lightest possible coffee roast available for Nespresso. I have a Keurig, too, and just can’t get into anything but their tea K-cups because their version of coffee is so much worse (poor quality and bitter) than actual coffee. 

I tried the lightest espresso and coffee pods in the variety pack that came with my new machine. I had to double or triple the water and then add tons of cream and sugar, and it was *still* too bitter for me to take more than a few sips. 

Don’t get me wrong, I can appreciate the higher quality of their coffee. It’s clearly much better than, say, Folgers or Maxwell House, but still too bitter as is. Please help!!

(Note: I don’t like flavored creamers at all… I literally just add tons of real cream and sugar to mine to make it cappuccino-adjacent!)",0,1753269139.0,nespresso,5,0.5,False

Anyway, I have a crush on this girl who works at a coffee shop I go to. As you probably guessed, I’m a girl too. Today something kind of embarrassing happened, but I also have a feeling she might like me back. She was serving me and we ended up exchanging a few words. She seems kind of shy. 

So, I had already paid, and while she was serving someone else, she turned towards me and I think she was looking at my chest. I was wearing a white top, and I guess my nipples got a little hard, lol. It was super embarrassing, but she kept looking at my chest for a bit while smiling. I don’t know, it sounds ridiculous. But what do you think? She might be attracted? ",1,1753268912.0,bodylanguage,2,1.0,False
1m76buc,https://www.reddit.com/r/GardeningUK/comments/1m76buc/gardening_tips_in_the_uk_mistakes_made_lessons/,"Gardening Tips in the UK: Mistakes Made, Lessons Learned, Plants Survived","Hellooo, I’m Crystal, been doing the garden thing for about five years now. It started with a packet of wildflowers and a windowsill tomato and suddenly I’ve got raised beds, half an allotment, and a garden notebook that looks like a crime scene. Gardening's been a massive help for my mental health and just gives me something solid to focus on. Thought I’d share a few things I’ve picked up along the way in case anyone finds it helpful.

I’m based in the UK so this is kind of aimed at folks with soggy springs, moody summers, and very confused plants.

Some of the stuff that’s helped me:

\-Start small and don’t overdo it. Seriously. It’s so tempting to buy ten seed packets and go wild but it’s way better to get a couple of things growing properly and learn what works in your space first.

\-Raised beds are worth it. They warm up quicker in spring and stop everything getting boggy when it chucks it down for a week. Mine are just made from old scaffold boards and they’ve held up fine.

\-Mulching is magic. I chuck bark chips or dead leaves down in autumn and spring and it keeps moisture in and weeds out. Plus worms love it and your soil stays healthier.

\-If you’re growing veg, don’t worry too much about textbook crop rotation unless you’re doing it on a big scale. Just avoid sticking the exact same thing in the exact same spot two years running.

\-Slugs are savage. I do night patrols with a torch, beer traps work pretty well, and I’ve had decent luck with copper tape around pots. Also coffee grounds around lettuce seems to help weirdly.

\-Save rainwater when you can. I’ve got a water butt hooked up to the shed but even just chucking buckets out when it rains has been useful during dry spells.

\-Plant apps actually help more than I expected. I use [Pipify](https://www.viralreach.org/apps/pipify?source=reddit) for IDing stuff I forgot the name of, spotting issues early with health scans, and tracking watering or feeds. It’s surprisingly smart. PlantNet and [PictureThis](https://www.viralreach.org/apps/PictureThis) are alright too if you just want to ID something quickly or log stuff. They’re a bit more basic but do the job.

\-Don’t give up on stuff too fast. Loads of plants look grim before they bounce back. My lavender looked totally dead for weeks and now it’s full of bees.

\-Companion planting is actually legit. I pop marigolds near the tomatoes and nasturtiums by the brassicas and it seems to help keep pests down. Plus it looks great.

\-Propagation is a slippery slope. Once you realise you can grow a dozen plants from one cutting, it gets out of hand fast. I’ve now got trays of baby sedum and mint I didn’t plan for.

Anyway, hope that helps someone out. If you’ve got a weird trick for keeping blackfly off your beans or a favourite hardy plant for unpredictable UK summers, I’d love to hear it.

Here’s the breakdown based on in-hand feel, fit, and first impressions. Most tees are TTS, but always check seller measurements just in case.

Godspeed New York Short Sleeves
Wasn’t sure at first, but this hits. Slight street-prep blend with the Godspeed NYC graphic — fabric’s soft with nice weight. Clean neck and sleeve stitching.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7503015281

Ami Shirt
Crisp button-up feel, slightly relaxed cut. Embroidered logo feels premium, not a glued patch. Great summer shirt — doesn’t scream “designer,” but gives quiet flex.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7494176359

Balenciaga Short Sleeves
Boxy and bold. Fabric’s heavy with a dry-touch texture, and the print is clean — nothing sloppy. It’s oversized by design, so size down if you don’t want the drop-shoulder look.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7502531665

Stüssy White Short Sleeves
Classic surfer-skater Stüssy vibe. Clean logo hit on white, comfy tee with a nice drape. This one’s easy to throw on with cargos or denim.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7501706350

Givenchy Short Sleeves
Sleek and understated. Black tee with sharp font logo — feels like an elevated basic. TTS but the length runs slightly longer than standard.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7510958053

Drew House Short Sleeves
Fun, cartoon-vibe tee with nice softness. Fits boxy but still flattering. The smiley logo’s clean — not oversized or peeling. Definitely a chill-day fit.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7490991678

Ape Pink Short Sleeves
Unexpected favorite. Color pops in person, print looks sharp, and cotton is solid quality. Runs slightly short in length but works for summer.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7504057042

Chrome Hearts Plaid Shorts
Super cozy with a subtle CH flex. Fabric feels more flannel than mesh — good for cooler evenings. Waistband has enough stretch, fit is slightly roomy.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7500632577

Gallery Dept Yellow T-shirt
Definitely loud. Dye job looks intentional, print holds up after first wash. Fit is boxy, sleeves drop low. Very streetwear, not for minimalist days.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7499835647

Ape White T-shirt
Thick and durable tee with classic BAPE logo. Fit is a little cropped and sleeves are wide — great with cargos or double-knee pants.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7499804748

Acne Studios Short Sleeves
Minimalism done right. Logo is tiny and clean, fabric’s light but smooth. This is one of those wear-anywhere pieces — coffee shop or night out.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7490790932

Ape Short Sleeves
Bold camo styling and classic Ape graphics. Print pops, and material is breathable. Slightly tight at the shoulders, so size up if you lift or want comfort.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7508850578

Gucci Short Sleeves
Logomania vibes but not too overdone. The fabric feels silky-soft, stitching looks decent. This one toes the line between streetwear and luxury well.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7513921290

Red Short Sleeves
This one’s simple but hits. Solid red with small logo text — gives Uniqlo x streetwear energy. Easy daily tee. Not the softest, but no complaints.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7504530328

Godspeed New York Short Sleeves (Repost)
Wanted to try a second colorway — same notes as above. Steezy cut, clean logo, comfy tee. Pairs well with baggy shorts or carpenter pants.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7503015281

Burberry Beach Shorts
Lightweight, breezy, and surprisingly durable. Print is on point and doesn’t feel cheap. Elastic waist is strong, mesh lining inside. Vacation-ready.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7496143768

Louis Vuitton Shoe
Surprisingly good structure. Sole feels sturdy, upper stitching is clean. Looks like retail from a few feet away. Took half-size up for comfort.

#  Éclairs – Manufacturing Process

1. **Preparation of Outer Shell (Caramel/Toffee Layer)**
   * Sugar, glucose syrup, and dairy fat are heated and blended to create a thick, pliable toffee mass.
   * This mixture is cooked to a precise temperature to achieve the desired chewiness and glossy texture.
2. **Forming the Shell**
   * The hot toffee is cooled slightly and passed through molds or extrusion systems to form cylindrical or oval shells with a hollow center.
3. **Chocolate Filling Preparation**
   * A creamy chocolate center is made using cocoa solids, milk solids, sugar, vegetable fat, and emulsifiers.
   * The filling is kept at a suitable temperature to maintain smooth flow for injection.
4. **Filling the Shells**
   * Using high-speed machines, the[ chocolate cream](https://bakemate.in/products/) is injected into the pre-formed shells through one end or via dual injection methods.
5. **Cooling & Wrapping**
   * Filled éclairs are cooled to set both shell and filling.
   * They are individually wrapped using high-speed flow-wrapping machines to ensure hygiene and freshness.
6. **Packaging**
   * Finished products are packed into pouches, jars, or display boxes, ready for retail distribution.

I smiled lightly to myself as I slowly wiped the make-up from my face, the gentle covering of concealer covering my soft skin easily coming off onto the wipe in my hand, as I think of Logan, and what tomorrow may hold…………



Tomorrow he would turn seventeen, in a matter of hours he would be out in the moonlight with his family shifting for the first time, those first few minutes into the hour of his seventeenth birthday and they would want to be out into the moonlight in the hopes to encourage the shift, a massive step in the life of a young werewolf, especially one as special as him, he would get to meet his wolf, the Alpha wolf that would one day take over from his Father in running our pack.



See, we were werewolves and that meant a few things for us, turning seventeen as Logan would tomorrow, meant the first shift for him, where we were finally able to change from our human form into our wolf form, the painful alteration of the bones changing shape was nothing compared to the exhilaration of being in wolf form out in the wild or so I had been told, and he would finally meet his inner wolf, which I knew he was so desperate to do, being a young Alpha too, I knew that his wolf would be a powerful and strong wolf, one capable of leading and protecting our pack when his father decided to hand it over to him, probably a different character to the kind, loving and caring character I had come to know in Logan, but then our relationship was different and those were sides of him that not everyone got to see…..



…….hmmm yeah, that first shift could be bad, as it meant your body wasn’t used to going from human form to its wolf form so easily, from what I’d heard from other wolves it felt unnatural at first and hella painful too as your bones dislocate, shifting shape, altering and cracking into the right places as your form changes, I gotta say I definitely am not looking forward to that part of it but then I can’t wait to meet my wolf either!



Once you get past the first shift it isn’t as bad, and the shifting between human and wolf form and back becomes easier and more natural to you; though obviously being werewolves we do have to watch where we shift as we don’t want to draw attention to ourselves, as that could be dangerous.



What I mean is that out in the human world I guess we are more a questioned myth, and we would rather it be kept that way so we avoid shifting around humans as much as we can, and tend to shift within our own pack territory or in other packs territory but that’s usually avoided for other reasons which are more territorial.



Each pack is like our group of wolves if you like, they vary in size and are run by one main Wolf, an Alpha, our current Alpha is Alpha Grayson, and is Logan’s Dad but he is also like a second Dad to me being my Dad’s best friend.



In a few years Alpha Grayson will step down for Logan to take over and become the Alpha once he completes his Alpha training, another reason I know when he meets his wolf he will be a powerful and intimidating wolf ready to take on this role. I couldn’t wait to meet his wolf either, and for my wolf to meet his when she comes along in a few months’ time when I turn seventeen…….



………You see having a wolf in your head is like having another personality in your head I guess, it’s another voice inside your head powering you to do the right thing, encouraging you, keeping you going……



I only had a few more months to go until I finally met my wolf and I couldn’t wait to meet her! I imagine she will be amazing, hopefully strong and powerful too…..she’d need to be if what everyone was saying was true…….. well it had to be true…… even the elders thought it……. It seemed like it was fated…… you see when a werewolf turns seventeen not only do you have the ability to shift and finally meet your wolf but this is the incredibly special part that I love about being a werewolf, you are able to find your mate………



…….I say find you mate, they may have been there all along right next to you and you just didn’t know it, but when you turn seventeen and your wolf is there you have the ability to sense your mate.



Finding you own mate is truly one of the parts I love about being a werewolf, we have our moon goddess, Selene, she carefully fates us all a mate, and that mate has a sacred bond with us and our wolf, that brings an undeniable and amazing connection, or so I’m told.



While this probably sounds crazy, it works, and is so special! Each wolf has their own scent, it helps a pack know who is who, especially when we are in wolf form, and that scent to a mate of their own is the most addictive scent imaginable, it is stronger to them than anyone else, more enticing to the point it could drive you insane!



Or again, so I’ve been told, I’m clueless really, as I’ve yet to find all this out, but it is all things that I’ve learnt as time has gone on, from friends gossiping and giggling, from what Mum has told me.



I guess I’ll find out for sure in a few months…… but anyway, this scent and draw to your mate pulls you to your mate like nothing else, and when you touch your mate the touch is like a static shock, a tingling, attracting you, pulling you to your mate.



There is an undeniable connection and attraction to a mate that no other wolf can have with you, they are there to protect and support you like no other, making the bond so strong which makes these fated mates an incredibly special blessing from our moon goddess.



And another reason I can’t wait for tomorrow is that Logan will be able to sense his mate, and for so long everyone in the pack has predicted we would be mates. Our families are so close, my Dad is Alpha Grayson’s Beta – which is like his second in command I guess you could say, (like a right hand man my Dad likes to say, or his skivvy if he is in a bad mood with Uncle Grayson ha-ha).



My Mum is best friends with Luna Talia, Logan’s Mum – a Luna is the mate of the Alpha and is a big part of a pack and is there to support the Alpha in so many ways.



So many packs, especially the elders in those packs believe that a pack does not run effectively without a Luna by the Alpha’s side. It is crazy to think that one day I am expected to step into Auntie Talia’s shoes as Luna with me being expected to be Logan’s mate; she is an amazing woman, so strong and an amazing mother to Logan and his two sisters, and like a second mother to most of the other young wolves in our pack.



Her and my mum were so close as friends, they were almost like sisters, but with my Dad being Alpha Grayson’s best friend as well as Beta so always being together it was inevitable really that they would end up close.



Our families were forever together, that is why Logan and I ended up being so close, only a few months apart in age we spent most of our time together as youngsters as our Mums were together all the time.



We were like siblings for so long, because I didn’t have any other siblings and Logan’s sisters weren’t born until we were in high school, so me and him had a really close connection, could read each other’s minds and Logan knew instinctively how to cheer me up and how to make me smile.



We must have been about six years old when I remember people joking about us being mates when we got older, and I still smile at our reaction even now. We both freaked out, big style! Haha, we were both like “eww that’s my friend!! Not my mate!!” we avoided each other for about a day, my logic behind that was if we weren’t together people wouldn’t think that we could be mates, as silly as that sounds when I look back.



Even sillier, is that by the next day I missed him and asked my Mum if I could go over to play video games with him, and weirdly he had asked his mum the same thing! We gave up trying to avoid each other, both agreeing that the old fogeys were being stupid.



But we did grow closer as we grew older, Logan would hang out with a group of us in school, both girls and boys but he was almost like a bodyguard, almost watching out for me, like he felt the need to protect me.



We ended up dating when we were about 14 I think it was, after Logan completely freaked out when Deyton another boy from our pack and one of our friends asked me out on a date. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do, I had thought Deyton was cute, but Logan was funny with me, saying that Deyton wasn’t good enough for me, and was so pissed off that I would, in his words “lower myself to go on a date with a guy like that”.



I couldn’t believe he’d been that nasty, Deyton was meant to be one of his friends, and we had a massive argument that night as I told Logan he had no right to dictate to me who I could and couldn’t see. He’d shouted some more about Deyton not being able to treat me right and not being able to ever be good enough for me.



I remember then screaming “ why is it your business Logan?! And who would be good enough?!” before running away from him crying, I had little intention of accepting Deyton’s offer of a date and was more flattered at the attention I think; but Logan had hurt me with his possessiveness, and the fact he’d shout at me that way as he knew I didn’t like people shouting at me.



He’d ran straight after me, grabbing my hand, pulling me close to him in an embrace and simply said “me, only me” before kissing me…………………



………… awwwww my heart that day, and every day since and even now when I remember it felt like it was exploding with happiness and fireworks, the guy I’d known forever, my best friend and my predicted mate according to most of the pack wanted me!!! I was in total heaven!! And the following three years our bond and connection had only got stronger, waiting for the day that we were finally so close to! Literally a matter of hours away until Logan would be able to know……..



The day we had the perfect confirmation that our moon goddess had blessed us as mates, destined us to be together. We already had the perfect basis for a strong relationship in the bond and friendship that was already there from our childhood, the mate bond and connection would only enforce that bond and make us stronger as a couple…………”We’ll be indestructible boo” Logan had told me, and I knew he would be right………………..



I could not wait to see Logan tomorrow, to see his shift, to see him shift into the perfect Alpha wolf I knew he would be, but more importantly to hear him call me mate when he could finally sense his mate – I just had to get to bed so morning would be here sooner!! Oh my goddess!! I seriously could not wait, tomorrow my future would begin!! I thought to myself as I snuggled into my bed for sleep……letting my mind wander to what Logan’s wolf may look like… what it would feel like to know he would be marking me…



# Chapter 2 - Lilah



I jumped slightly in my sleep, hearing noise from downstairs, groggily rolling my head into the softness of my pillow, I felt so tired, but the persistent banging around downstairs, I assumed from my parents, made me half open one eye sleepily, only to see the sun glaring around the edges of my bedroom curtains.



I sleepily banged my hand across my bed to make its way to my bedside table which sat next to my single bed “ow!” I cursed as I knocked my wrist on the corner of the wooden unit top as I went to reach for my mobile phone, a morning ritual by now…….. a good morning boo text waiting for me from Logan making me smile as it did every morning, before I noticed the time – 9.45am!!



\*Shit!! I’ve seriously overslept!!\* I tell myself. My plan had been to get up early and be over at Logan’s house for birthday breakfast with him…….\* Yeah that’s out of the window I tell myself by the time you’re ready and get over there he’ll have long done with breakfast Lilah! And likely be overrun with visitors for his birthday and that’s assuming Uncle Grayson hasn’t already dragged him off to the Pack House to spend time with the pack for his birthday! Idiot!!\* I cursed myself.



Quickly stepping from the warmth of my bed wanting to be as quick as I can to get to see Logan and start celebrating his special day with him I head toward the bathroom, grabbing a towel from the shelves near my bedroom.



Rushing as much as I could I showered and dried my long, wavy honey blonde hair leaving it loose down my back the way I preferred it. Doing my make up while sitting in my underwear at the dressing table in my bedroom, then threw on a pair of black skinny jeans and a white crop top before throwing a pair of my favourite boots before checking myself over in my full length mirror on the back of my bedroom door.



\* I’ll do\* I thought to myself, knowing that Logan loved me dressed like this, as I went to grab my phone and bag and pretty much run from my room knowing I wanted to get to my Logan as fast I could. I got to the bottom the stairs in our house as fast as I could without falling over my feet, which when you’re as clumsy as me and in a rush was an accomplishment in itself!



Both my Mum and Dad were sat at the breakfast bar in our family kitchen having coffee, which for this time of day in the week seemed odd in itself, my Dad being Beta would usually be busy at work in his office for the Alpha at the Pack House.



And Mum was often off out somewhere with Auntie Talia up to something or helping out with things around the pack. \*As I walked past them I could sense them watching me, and let’s just say the atmosphere in the room could be described as one of those that the tension could be cut with a knife - have they been arguing?\* I thought to myself that seems unlikely, as my parents were not ones for falling out, so this whole tension in the air thing was weird for my Mum and Dad as they were normally laughing and joking or hugging and kissing, which yeah I have to admit normally made me roll my eyes in a typical embarrassed teenager kind of way I guess.



I chose to ignore the atmosphere anyway and address it later if it was still the same when I came home, just wanting to get to see Logan and start enjoying his birthday with him. I walked across our brightly lit kitchen, to grab Logan’s birthday gift which was sat on the kitchen work surface, but as I did my Dad stood up.



“Mornin’ Lilah, you gonna have some breakfast with us?” he smiled kindly as he spoke.



“Nah is ok thanks Pops” I looked back at him “ I’m running real late and want to see Logan” the fact I was looking at my Dad when I spoke to him meant I saw the loaded look he gave to my Mum, and it was a weird one,



\*something is going on…….\*.I said to myself, but I didn’t think they were going to elaborate and to be quite honest I had no plan to stick round to find out.



“Awww come on Del” my Mum spoke up using another of my pet names friends and family used for me “ I’m sure Logey can wait a while longer, you know you should have something to eat……”



This time I saw a look from my Mum to me, then to my Dad,\* I had no clue what was going on, but I was not for listening today, I just wanted to get on my way to see Logan, I was already way behind my planned schedule, I wanted to be there for when he shifted for the second time so I really hope I hadn’t missed that as it was such a treasured moment for a young wolf when they shifted……. \*



And he was desperate for me to meet his wolf! He will have shifted for the first time in the early hours of his birthday with his family there, as that’s how most families do it as it’s a special moment in our werewolf lives, but Logan had begged me to make sure I was there for the next time he would shift as he was as desperate for me to meet his wolf as I was to meet him, saying he knew his wolf would love me as much as he did.



\* I really need to go……….\*I urge myself.



“nah I’m good, thanks though Mama” I said as I grabbed Logan’s gift from the kitchen worktop and walked out of the door before either one of them could try to stop me or delay me any further.



Where is he going to be? I pondered to myself, knowing he’d either be home or he’d be in the Pack House.



Our house was situated literally next door to the Alpha house where Logan lived with his family so it wouldn’t take me a minute to check if he was home. I hopped over the small fence they had around the garden like I always did rather than open the gate they had at the bottom of the footpath, and walked across the grass toward the large house.



I tried to glance inside the house for signs of life inside but couldn’t see much at all, I reached the front door in no time at all and knocked hard on the door on the off chance that perhaps Logan had slept in too. I stood waiting, enjoying the heat from the sunshine on my back,



the mornings are definitely getting warmer…… I told myself



…… doesn’t look like anyone is home, maybe I should try call him…….



So I do just that, I reach for my phone in my back pocket of my jeans and dial the familiar number of my boyfriend and soon to be mate, as I start walking along the garden path as I let the phone ring



…..Come on Logan……Where are you? This seemed odd. The phone rang but weirdly he didn’t answer, he normally always answered for me, but I wasn’t going to let it bother me, it was his birthday today, and a special birthday at that, and I imagine he had lots on his mind and lots of people wanting his attention – he was the future Alpha after all.



I looked at the time - now 10.30am, yeah I’d say the Pack House would have been the safer guess anyway at this time, Logan’s Dad was a strict Alpha and always wanted to be in work early, not quite a trait Logan had inherited or appreciated just yet but certainly one Alpha Grayson enforced upon Logan; though I imagine today with it being his birthday he will have been encouraged to go to the Pack House to spend time with his Pack members.



My guess would be Logan, his sisters and his Mum would have headed to the Pack House with Alpha Grayson this morning to spend time there while Uncle Grayson went to work in his office. The Pack House unfortunately was a little further away for me, so as I quickly stepped over the fence again, I picked up my pace walking down the quiet path ways of our pack.



The sun was really shining brightly today, I enjoyed the heat from it on my skin as I walked, noticing the leaves budding on the trees in the gardens of some of the nearby houses. I was walking at a quicker pace, more a jog now, doing my best to get to Logan as soon as I could, feeling so bad for being late….my speed walking was obviously helping as the Pack House was coming into sight.



The Pack House is basically a large house used by the entire Pack, much as the name suggests I guess. Ours looks a bit like a hotel to look at I think. It has lots of different purposes, single wolves can live there in the dorm style rooms, there is a full top floor which is for more senior wolves, and I know Logan plans to take the Alpha suite when he turns eighteen, there are kitchens, a large dining room where the whole pack eat together a few times a week, although food is served in the pack house daily for those that live here and for those that want to eat here as everyone is always welcome.



How it often works is though is that once a wolf meets their mate they move to one of the houses out in the pack land, a bit like the one I live in with my family, and settle there to bring up a family, so it isn’t unusual for mealtimes to be had at home with your own family; though Alpha Grayson does like to encourage the whole pack to come together as much as possible as it is good to keep the pack strong and united.



Also in the packhouse we have a library, two lounge areas, a games room and the pack offices – one for the Alpha, my Dad’s (the Beta) and also the Gamma’s office. Our Pack House also has some secure rooms underneath for security reasons too.



I’m sure to some the Pack House may look intimidating to look at, though outsiders would rarely be here anyway, but the Pack House is the most welcoming place to walk into when you’re a member of the pack, always the smell of home cooking wafting out of the kitchen; I especially loved it when it was the smell of home baking…….



There was always the laugh of pack members from the lounge or games room, and always someone there to talk to…… I am almost at a run as I approach the large double entrance doors to the Pack House, my heart really pounding in my chest…..



Maybe a combination of the fact I was excited and had been running a little, but considering I was used to exercise it was more likely because I knew the moment has almost arrived to see Logan and have him officially declare me as his mate when his inner wolf can sense…..oh goddess! I cannot wait!!!



I reach the doors as Dylan, one of our pack warriors was walking from the Pack House, likely on his way to start his border patrol for the day, he looks at me, normally he’d greet me with a friendly smile, but instead today he greets me with a quick glance, like he didn’t want to make eye contact and then he awkwardly stutters “ Oh hey Lilah, erh, what you doing here?”



Idiot, I thought, Logan is your friend, you’ll know it’s his birthday, why you asking why I’m here, surely you know? Seriously, what is it with people today?! Why are they acting so weird?



I chose to ignore my annoyance though, focusing on what I need to do “ Hey Dylan, just here to see Logan” I explain, though feeling like I am really explaining the complete obvious.



Dylan then does some weird thing with his eyes, shrugs and quickly walks past me.



\*What the hell?! Fuck it, I don’t have time for this….. I just want to get to Logan, wish him a Happy Birthday, give him a kiss and give him his gift….\*I’ve thought so long over what to get for him, wanting to make it extra special with it being the day he shifts, and the day we were certain we would become mates…



I walked through the heavy, double doorway of the Pack House, I have to say, the Pack House was busier than usual for this time of day, though I guess that was to be expected with it being the future Alpha of the pack having his birthday and everyone wanting to join in with the celebrations.



I walked down the familiar corridors, and could see people noticing me arrive; but instead of the friendly smiles I’m used to I was getting awkward smiles, people avoiding my gaze, or giving me awkward glances or even people straight up moving out of my way!



Seriously what is going on?! Something doesn’t feel right I tell myself I don’t think I like it…… I need to find Logan so I head to the main lounge area, knowing his favourite seat in there is the most likely place he’d be right now, probably with an army of devoted pack members surrounding him, chatting to him, wishing him a happy birthday….



He was certainly loved within our pack….. I walk into the large and cosy lounge area, which is full of many of our pack members chatting and laughing, but as I do an eerie silence descends on the room and a large number of pack members quickly make an exit…..



This shit is getting weirder, I tell myself as a feeling of dread fills my stomach, the need for Logan filling me even more. I am urgently scanning the room for him, and as I predicted he was sat on his favourite chair, the big black recliner armchair, almost in the centre of the room – his favourite he once told me because of how comfy it was, but also because of how soft the red fluffy cushions were that were usually sat on it, and also because of it’s prime position for the TV and gaming station; I remember laughing at him when he told me and calling him a “typical dude”.



My heart drops through the floor, as I said, yes, Logan was on his favourite seat, but he is not alone……….. far from it………… curled up on his knee is Anya Beckett, daughter of our Gamma. Logan’s eyes are staring intently into hers, hers gazing back into hers as she giggles and traces her finger up his cheek bone. Her petite body curled up on his knee, her long dark curls, loose down her back, with Logan running his hand through them….



What the fuck?! Why is she touching my Logan like that? Why is he touching her?...... My mind is working overtime, yet Logan doesn’t even seem to have registered that I have walked into the room!! He is MY boyfriend!! He is MY mate, everyone said so! MY mate….. isn’t he?!......................isn’t he?!.......



# Chapter 3 - Logan



I’m in heaven! I tell myself as I go to kiss the beautiful girl in front of me for the multiple time that morning, never tiring of the sparks it causes in my body, I swear it feels amazing! I run my hands through her long dark curls, as she gently touches my face….tingles spread all over me from the contact….



Then a familiar voice suddenly interrupts my thoughts “L..Lo..Logan?” a voice I recognise as Lilah stutters.



\*Oh shit! My brain trying to process what to say…. This could be awkward, I thought I’d have chance to explain to her what happened………… I didn’t know she’d walk in on us……………….. \*



\* …..wait, her fucking parents were meant to stop her so this didn’t happen! I think angrily, then I see the shock onher face… Oh fuck! Oh fuck!! Oh fuck!!........ I’m fucked!\*



“ Lilah, I can explain!” I say, gently lifting Anya off my lap and stepping toward Lilah. Anya looks dejectedly at me.



\* oh man, don’t start!\* I think, so gently shake my head at her and mutter “ I need to do this Ani” \*and hope to the goddess she has the decency to understand how hard this must be on Lilah.\*



Lilah looked up at me as I stood, and quite honestly she looked broken \*has she figured out what has happened this morning?\* I wonder to myself, \*how can fate be this fucked up? I love this girl in front of me, I think I always have………..I was so sure she was mine………..I felt like crying.\*



“I..I..I need to go” Lilah said as she started to walk out of the now almost empty room, everyone who had been here must have realised the awkwardness of what the situation would become and left when they saw Lilah.\* I couldn’t let her leave…………\*



\*You need to speak to her Logan……\*I tell myself, so I quickly grab her hand and take her to one of the offices nearby, the closest conveniently being her Dad’s, the Beta office.



\* Least I know it will be empty I think to myself \*seeing as he is at home, supposedly helping me out by delaying her getting here to give me a chance to fucking speak to her to avoid this shit show happening! \*



\*Some help he’d been! Maybe I couldn’t blame this all on him, I had gotten distracted…\*. I could feel Lilah resist my hold on her hand,\* I didn’t like that, she’s never done that before………..she’s always loved me holding her hand, saying it made her feel safe and loved……\*



“Lilah please….” I said as we sat down on the small leather sofa inside of the office to the side of the main desk and chairs. This room almost a carbon copy of my father’s own office.



“Please what Logan? I can’t do this……..” she sobbed as she broke down in a flood of tears. I instantly knelt in front of her and wrapped my arms around her and found myself sobbing a little too…..



\* This is my girl, the girl I thought would be my mate, the girl I’d opened up to, the girl everyone said would be my mate, how could we all be so fucking wrong?! \*



The thoughts inside my head made me want to scream, \*how can this have happened? Yet it seemed fate had another plan, and our closeness was likely to never be the same again… no, it never could, be the same again.



I can’t do this either….. \*I sighed.



We both held each other for a few minutes, both sobbing together. But I had to pull myself together…. …… we have to talk about this ………I got to do this for her………. For us………… we got to address this…………we have to talk about this………….my thoughts were like an internal battle with my emotions.



But I knew we couldn’t carry on like this anymore. My mate, not the one I expected but still my mate…… the one fated to me was waiting for me out in the lounge. I looked to Lilah, her beautiful aqua eyes now red and bloodshot from crying, her beautiful face forlorn with hurt and upset…..



I hated myself, I hated fate………..I still want her my mind battled no, there isn’t the mate link there like the unexpected one I found just an hour ago with Anya, but we have a connection……….we have a link………we have so much more………… we have a love for each other that went deeper…………… how can we throw that away?!



Lilah’s beautiful eyes gazed into my own teary grey eyes, her eyes I had never tired of looking into, her gaze usually able to give me goosebumps and make me smile, but today there was no smile, just pain “she’s the one, isn’t she?” she gasped in a sob “ she’s your mate isn’t she?”



I slowly nodded as she burst into a fresh flood of tears, and I instinctively pulled her close again as she sobbed into my chest…………this was torture……………



# Chapter 4 - Lilah



\*I didn’t want to be here but Logan felt the need to explain and I wasn’t going to get away with him not doing and I knew that, so I sat, letting him say what he needed to.



I know my Logan…………though it looks like he’s not my Logan anymore, not with a mate outside…………….but I still knew him all the same, and he seemed to be struggling as much as me with this situation. \*



\*Though surely the fact he’d found his mate should help with that! I just wanted the ground to swallow me up whole……..



I’d loved this guy for years…………told him all my secrets………grown with him………….shared my first kiss with him………….messed around with him…………oh………………..thank the goddess!!..........thank the goddess we never went further assuming we were mates! \*



A small feeling of relief washed over me, waiting until we had our wolves before we took our relationship to the next level was clearly the right thing to have done.



While sleeping with someone who isn’t your mate isn’t uncommon, it was most definitely frowned upon by many. I had always imagined my first time with my mate……….with Logan………but they were always one of the same to me in my mind, how wrong could I be?! I sobbed again. How wrong were we all?



“I’m sorry Lilah, I thought it would be you, I truly did, we all did. I couldn’t wait to see you this morning, I was hanging around waiting for you to come see me, Dad did what he does best and dragged me to the pack house with him so I was chilling out in the lounge” he begun to explain



“Ani was here with her Dad, as he’d come to start work, soon as she walked in my wolf was screaming at me Lilah, I thought you must have come in……………..I was looking all over for you…………..” he looked distraught as he explained the scene, his breathing becoming faster as he described the scene to me.



“Lilah, my eyes were darting all over the room, waiting to see you, to grab you and shout mate, and to see your smile when I could finally do that…………but I couldn’t see you! I was panicking so bad baby!” his breathing was getting harder as he explained, his panic from the situation evident in his voice.



“The only girl in the room was Ani, she was clueless as to what I was feeling, she came up to me smiling, and gave me a hug as she said happy birthday and my body was zapping with weird sparks, you know the ones they tell you about, my wolf was screaming mate at me, but my heart was breaking too Lilah, it was breaking that it wasn’t you” I was sat staring at him, tears now dripping down both our faces at what he had described.



\* How can fate be so cruel?\*

I sat on the bench, scrolling through my phone and debating ordering food when I heard someone say my name. I looked up and it was an old college friend I hadn’t seen in over six years. We used to be super close back then, but life kinda just took us in different directions.



We got to talking while waiting for the next train, and it was one of those effortless conversations where it feels like no time has passed. Turns out he’d recently moved back to the city and was now working at a fast-growing fintech startup. I told him about my job freelance UX designer for apps and he kind of perked up. Apparently, they were in desperate need of a product designer but hadn’t found the right fit yet.



We exchanged numbers, said we’d grab coffee soon, and I figured that was that. But two days later, he texted asking if I’d be open to doing some contract work for their team.



Long story short, I did a few mockups, they liked my work, and last week I officially joined them as a part-time product designer with the potential to go full-time.



All because I missed a train.



Funny how life has these little hidden detours that somehow take you exactly where you’re supposed to go.



Anyone else have a moment like that where one small ""inconvenience"" turned out to be a blessing?",11,1753268035.0,story,0,1.0,False

My daughter froze to death because my husband thought I kidnapped his bastards.

He tied her upside down to a utility pole. In the middle of a blizzard. And left her there all night.

By the time I reached her, her tiny lips were blue, her lashes covered in frost, and her arms hung limp like a broken doll.

I screamed her name—once, twice—but Kiara didn’t answer. My baby didn’t even flinch.

I fell to my knees, clutching her frozen body, barely breathing as I whispered, “Colsen, she’s your daughter too. How could you do this to her?”

“She’s my child,” he snarled, “just like Rafael and Brian. If you hate me, fine—but why punish innocent kids? Where did you hide them, Elsie?!”

My throat tightened. I didn’t know how to respond—because nothing I said would matter.

So he did worse.

He ordered someone to throw my already unconscious daughter into a frozen lake.

I dragged her out with trembling hands, screaming until my voice cracked. But Kiara never woke up.

At the hospital, the doctor shook his head. “There's nothing we can do. Her organs have shut down. It’s too late.”

She had just turned seven yesterday.

And now she was gone. Not because of illness. Not because of fate. But because I married a man who thought his mistresses’ children were worth more than our own.

I took her lifeless body to the funeral home that night, then wandered back to the house to fetch her favorite doll.

But the moment I opened the door, I heard laughter.

There they were—Colsen’s “missing” sons—playing happily in the living room.

And Colsen?

He was on the couch with her, arms wrapped around the woman who helped ruin everything.

My head started spinning at the sight. My mind went completely blank.

When Colsen noticed me, the grin on his face disappeared. ""Oh, you're back?"" he said flatly.

He gave me a cold glance and added, ""Looks like the punishment worked. You must've been scared enough to return Rafael and Brian in the middle of the night. Since they're both fine, and Astrid is kind-hearted, I'll let this whole thing go.""

I didn't respond. He narrowed his eyes and said with a chill in his voice, ""To keep the boys from going missing again, I'll be keeping them close from now on. Starting today, Astrid and her two sons will be living here too. You'd better drop whatever wicked ideas you've got and learn to get along.""

Get along? What a joke.

Kiara had just passed away, and he expected me to live under the same roof as his illegitimate twins, like nothing had happened.

I clenched my fists, but my throat was too dry to speak.

Seeing I was silent, he frowned and asked, ""Where's Kiara? What did you do with her? I shouldn't have tied her up like that, but you left me no choice. If you hadn't hidden my two sons, I wouldn't have gone that far. Kiara's always been a smart kid. I'm sure she'll understand.""

Understand?

But he had no idea that the sweet, gentle child who never gave him trouble was dead because of him. Killed by his own hands. Just thinking of Kiara made my chest feel like it was being torn apart.

I looked at those two boys laughing on the slide, and fury exploded inside me. If it weren't for them, my daughter would still be alive!

In a sudden rage, I lunged forward and grabbed both boys by the neck with all the strength I had.

""Elsie Flynn! What are you doing?!"" Colsen rushed over and yanked me back violently, throwing me to the floor.

""I thought you had changed, but you're still so cruel and full of hate! What did these boys ever do to deserve this from you?!""

Astrid quickly wrapped her arms around the crying children and burst into tears. ""Elsie, it's all my fault. If you're angry, be mad at me. Please, just don't hurt them anymore...""

""Colsen stared at me with a cold expression, his gaze sharp and cold.

""Elsie, Astrid has always been kind and never tried to take anything from you. Why can't you just accept her?""

My eyes burned with tears, and my heart felt like it was being torn apart. ""Colsen... do you even know... do you have any idea what you did to Kiara...""

Before I could finish, I suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood.

The sorrow overwhelmed me, and I collapsed unconscious.

Chapter 2​​​

When I opened my eyes again, I realized I was locked inside the room. I reached into my pocket to call for help, but my phone was gone.

Still in shock, I heard the door creak open slowly. Standing in the doorway, lit from behind, was Colsen.

He walked over and stopped near the bed, speaking in a calm but serious tone, ""Elsie, it's normal for rich men to have more than one woman. Can't you be more understanding? No matter how many women are out there, you'll always be my legal wife. Kiara will always be my eldest daughter. No one can take your place. Why can't you accept that?""

I looked at the man before me, crying silently. He felt like a stranger now, and it terrified me.

We had fallen in love back in college. We married after graduation and had been together for over ten years.

In the beginning, I gave him all my savings to help him get started. I stayed by his side as he grew from a broke student into a billionaire businessman.

But just a year after he became successful, he had an affair. Everything he had promised me became meaningless.

When I discovered he had another family, I lost control. I screamed, cried, and made a huge scene.

I refused to divorce him because I didn't want the money we built together to end up in the hands of his illegitimate children. So I clung to the marriage certificate, refused to sign the divorce papers, and did everything I could to keep control of the company's finances. I promised myself I'd protect Kiara's inheritance—no matter what.

But it was my refusal to let go that ended up causing Kiara's death.

Now I finally see things clearly. I'm done fighting and making a fuss.

In a raspy voice, I told him, ""Colsen, I won't argue anymore... I just want a divorce.""

""You're stubborn!"" he snapped, his eyes darkening as he slammed his hand on the table. ""You still don't understand the situation! Since that's the case, stay in this room until you reflect on yourself. Once you realize your mistake, I'll let you out!""

Then he turned and walked out, closing the door behind him with a loud bang.

""No!"" I screamed, rushing to the door and banging on it. ""Colsen, open the door! I can't stay locked in here!""

Kiara is still lying in the funeral home. I haven't even buried her yet. I can't be trapped here!

""Open the door, Colsen!"" I shouted.

But no matter how desperately I shouted, the only answer I got was the hollow echo of my own voice in the empty room.

Chapter 3​​​

It wasn't until later that night that the door finally opened again. Astrid came inside, holding a glass of water.

She stood in front of me with a mocking smirk, her voice dripping with provocation. ""Elsie, just look at yourself. You look completely drained. No spark, no youth, no life left in you. No wonder Colsen chose me instead!""

Her words didn't bother me anymore.

I truly didn't care who Colsen chose to love.

""Oh, right, did your daughter die?"" Astrid asked, sneering proudly. ""Honestly, I hid the twins on purpose to make you look like the bad one. And it was my idea to hang your daughter up in the freezing wind all night. I suggested it to Colsen. Who would've thought it'd work so well and kill that little brat in one go? She's just like you—weak and pathetic.

""Elsie, the Breslin family business will soon belong to my kids! And I'll be the next Mrs. Breslin!""

""Astrid!"" The second I heard her cruel words, I couldn't stay calm anymore.

Furious, I ran toward her, grabbed her hair, and screamed like a mad woman, ""You vile woman! My daughter didn't do anything to you. Why did you hurt her?""

""Ah!"" Astrid suddenly dropped to her knees with a loud thud and started begging with fake tears. ""Elsie, I'm sorry. I never should've gone after Colsen or destroyed your family. Please stop hitting me...""

Then, the door burst open with a loud bang.

Colsen stormed in, his face filled with rage. ""Elsie!""

He marched toward me and slapped me hard across the face. ""Astrid came in to bring you water out of kindness. Instead of being grateful, you hit her? How could you be so cruel?""

The blow knocked me over.

My forehead hit the edge of the table, and a sharp pain followed. Warm blood started dripping down my face.

But I didn't care about the injury. I stood up, pleading with him. ""Colsen, please let me go. Kiara froze to death because of you. Her body is still at the funeral home. She hasn't even been cremated. I can't let her leave this world without peace...""

""Stop lying!"" Colsen's expression turned harsh. He glared at me and said coldly, ""You're heartless enough to curse your own child? Kiara was always healthy. There's no way she froze to death! You're just trying to run away!""

But that night, the temperature was -20°C. Kiara was only seven. How could she survive that kind of torment?

""Colsen, I'm not making anything up. I can prove it with this death certificate..."" My hands were shaking as I pulled the document from inside my clothes.

Astrid gave a cold laugh. ""Elsie, where did you get that fake certificate from? My friend got one made for two dollars, but yours looks way more convincing.""

""You're terrible, Elsie!"" Colsen shouted, his face full of fury. He ripped the certificate from my hand and threw it at me.

""You really faked something like this just to trick me? I'm warning you, my patience is running out! Keep this up, and Astrid will replace you as my wife for sure! All the family's money will go to her twins!""

The sharp paper scraped across my face, cutting my skin and drawing blood.

A wave of despair washed over me.

Just then, a sudden clatter came from Kiara's room next door, followed by a strong scent of smoke.

My heart tightened in alarm. ""What's going on out there?""

Chapter 4​​

Astrid crossed her arms and spoke with tears in her voice, ""Elsie, Rafael, and Brian really like Kiara's room. Colsen said he'd clear out all of Kiara's stuff so they could move in. He also said she had too many useless toys, and the storage room couldn't fit them. So he told the nanny to burn everything.""

""What are you saying..."" I gasped, completely stunned.

I ran outside and shouted, ""Stop! Don't touch her things! Don't burn them!""

Colsen's face turned cold as he shouted, ""Enough! Elsie, don't you get it? Letting Kiara keep all this junk will destroy her future! This is your fault! You spoiled her. Myla, burn everything!""

""No, you can't do that..."" I rushed forward, trying to stop them, but Colsen yanked me back, holding me still.

Astrid pretended to comfort me. ""Elsie, please trust Colsen. He only wants what's best for the kids.""

In the end, all I could do was stand there, watching helplessly as Kiara's most beloved toys were swallowed by flames—reduced to ashes before my eyes. The fire roared, lighting up the room in a blaze of red, and all I could see was the burn in my eyes.

I collapsed to my knees beside the ashes, sobbing.

""I'm so sorry, Kiara. It's all my fault.

""I couldn't keep you safe, and I couldn't protect your things either.

""I'm a terrible mother.""

Then I was locked up again. No matter how many times I banged on the door or pleaded, Colsen wouldn't let me out.

I didn't eat or drink for three days. I just lay there, weak and crying for Kiara. The pain in my chest was endless, unbearable.

On the third day, it was the twins' third birthday. Colsen threw them a grand, extravagant party.

The sound of music and laughter downstairs made my pain feel even worse.

As I sat in silence, the door burst open with a loud bang. Astrid came in with the twins.

""Elsie, I brought you some cake,"" she said, proudly holding a plate of exquisite small cakes. ""Colsen made them himself! Can you believe it? A man who's never stepped foot in the kitchen actually baked for his kids. He dotes on the twins so much. Elsie, I bet you and your daughter never got to eat anything homemade by Colsen, right? What a shame, too bad your little girl never will...""

I was so furious that I jumped up and smacked the plate right out of her hands. The white cream splattered all over Astrid's clothes.

Her face turned red with rage as she raised her hand and slapped me across the face. ""Elsie, what are you even proud of? Do you still think you're the dignified Mrs. Breslin? Let me tell you, those days are over!""

Then, all of a sudden, she shoved her younger son, Brian Breslin, with force.

Brian lost his balance and toppled backward, hitting his head on the edge of the coffee table. Blood began to stream from the back of his head.

He wailed in pain, his cries echoing through the room.

Colsen rushed in, alarmed by the noise. ""Astrid, what's going on in here?""

Astrid looked terrified as she held the injured Brian close, crying. ""Colsen, Brian was just trying to be kind. He brought Elsie a piece of cake. She didn't want it, fine. But she actually pushed him! Brian hit his head and now he's bleeding... My poor boy, what did he ever do to deserve this?""

Her eldest son, Rafael Breslin, chimed in quickly, ""Daddy, that bad woman is so evil! She called Mommy a vile woman, threw her cake, and pushed Brian! She's so mean, you have to punish her for what she did!""

""Elsie!"" Colsen's eyes darkened with fury as he suddenly raised his hand and struck me across the face.

He grabbed me by the neck and shoved me hard against the edge of the window, his expression twisted with rage, eyes nearly blazing. ""Elsie, Astrid has always been gentle and always puts up with you. Why do you keep crossing the line? Looks like I've let you off too easily. That's why you act so full of yourself!

""Apologize to Astrid. Right now!""

My face burned, and it was getting hard to breathe. I felt like I was suffocating. But even then, I forced out a reply, ""I'll never... apologize!""

""You won't learn your lesson until it's too late, huh?"" Colsen growled, his voice low and threatening. His teeth were clenched as he glared at me. ""If you don't apologize to Astrid, I'll throw you out this window. Are you scared now?""

I laughed. Soft, bitter, unhinged.

After being married for a decade and sticking together through so many ups and downs, this is how it ends.

What a terrible ending.

""You don't have to do it."" I whispered, my lips trembling.

""I'll jump on my own.""

He grabbed me by the neck and shoved me hard against the edge of the window, his expression twisted with rage, eyes nearly blazing. ""Elsie, Astrid has always been gentle and always puts up with you. Why do you keep crossing the line? Looks like I've let you off too easily. That's why you act so full of yourself!

""Apologize to Astrid. Right now!""

My face burned, and it was getting hard to breathe. I felt like I was suffocating. But even then, I forced out a reply, ""I'll never... apologize!""

""You won't learn your lesson until it's too late, huh?"" Colsen growled, his voice low and threatening. His teeth were clenched as he glared at me. ""If you don't apologize to Astrid, I'll throw you out this window. Are you scared now?""

I laughed. Soft, bitter, unhinged.

After being married for a decade and sticking together through so many ups and downs, this is how it ends.

What a terrible ending.

""You don't have to do it."" I whispered, my lips trembling.

""I'll jump on my own.""

* **To increase happiness, you have two options:**
   1. **Improve your Reality:** Work hard, build better relationships, improve your health. This is the obvious path.
   2. **Manage your Expectations:** Practice gratitude for what you have, stop comparing yourself to others, and accept that life will have both ups and downs. This is the more powerful, internal path.

**2. The Positive Psychology Formula -> Happiness = P + E + R + M + A**

* **P - Positive Emotion:** This is more than just smiling. It's the ability to cultivate and savor feelings of joy, contentment, warmth, and hope.
   * **How to get it:** Practice gratitude, savor small pleasures (a good cup of coffee, a sunny day), and be optimistic.
* **E - Engagement (Flow):** This is the feeling of being completely absorbed in an activity. You lose track of time, and your sense of self fades away. It’s the opposite of boredom.
   * **How to get it:** Engage in hobbies you love, challenge yourself at work, or learn a new skill. Find something that uses your strengths and captures your full attention.
* **R - Positive Relationships:** Humans are social creatures. The single biggest predictor of human happiness, across all cultures, is the strength of our social connections.
   * **How to get it:** Invest time and energy in your family, friends, and community. Perform acts of kindness. Be present with the people you care about.
* **M - Meaning:** This is the sense that you are part of something bigger than yourself. It's about purpose.
   * **How to get it:** This can come from your career, raising a family, volunteering, spirituality, or contributing to a cause you believe in.
* **A - Accomplishment:** This is the pursuit of success, mastery, and achievement. It's not about winning for the sake of winning, but about the process of setting and reaching goals.
   * **How to get it:** Set realistic goals (both small and large), work towards them, and take pride in your progress.

**3. The Neuroscience Formula -> Happiness = Dopamine + Oxytocin + Serotonin + Endorphins**

* **Dopamine (The Reward Chemical):** Motivates you to take action toward goals and rewards.
   * **How to get it:** Break big goals into small, achievable steps and celebrate each one. Finish a task. Eat a good meal.
* **Oxytocin (The Bonding Chemical):** Creates feelings of love, trust, and connection.
   * **How to get it:** Hug someone, play with a pet, give a compliment, hold hands.
* **Serotonin (The Mood Stabilizer):** Contributes to feelings of well-being and importance.
   * **How to get it:** Get sun exposure, practice gratitude, meditate, engage in vigorous exercise like running or cycling.
* **Endorphins (The Painkiller):** Released in response to stress or discomfort, creating a feeling of euphoria.
   * **How to get it:** Laughter is a great way! Also, intense exercise (""runner's high""), eating dark chocolate, or watching a compelling drama.

Because he wanted to please his first love.

In seconds, my shirt buttons popped off, my skirt was ripped, and my bra strap snapped...

I clutched the shredded fabric to her chest, struggling forward in the heavy rain.

When I realized it was time to walk away, I thought everything was over.

But the next day, I found that everyone was discussing my neked photo in the rain.



Right after Elie Roberts submitted her resignation, her mom called.

""Elie, how's the resignation going?""

""I've already turned it in. I'll officially be out in a month.""

""That's great,"" her mom said, sounding more cheerful. ""The friends in town and I picked out a few decent boys for you. Meet them when you're back, okay? Let's try to get you engaged this year.""

Then she sighed. ""And stop thinking about that heir from the Lawrence family. He's from a whole different world. We're not the same.""

Elie's throat tightened, eyes started to tear up. ""It's okay, Mom. I get it. I'll be back after I finish the handover.""

After hanging up, Elie started packing up her desk.

Years at the Lawrence Group had left her with way too much to sort through. She was only halfway done when her phone vibrated again.

It was a message from Clara Grayson: a location pin, followed by two words, ""Come over.""

The address was none other than Eric Lawrence's villa.

Twenty minutes later, Elie was standing at his front door.

The front door was ajar, so she pushed it open and walked in. Clara was standing in the middle of the living room, holding a bracelet.

Elie's heart sank. She was sure she'd cleared everything out when she moved out of this place. How did something get left behind?

Before she could react, Clara slapped her across the face.

""I've been trying to figure out who was with Eric while I was abroad, and I never would've guessed—it was you, my best friend!

""Elie, with that plain face and flat figure? You really think you could seduce Eric?""

Elie trembled, shame crashing over her like a wave.

""Clara, it was a mistake between him and me. And we're just friends with benefits... It only happened after you two broke up. I never crossed the line before that.""

Smack!

Clara slapped her again. ""Breakup or not, Eric will always be mine. Who do you think you are?""

This one hit harder—Elie felt blood at the corner of her mouth. When Clara raised her hand for a third slap, Elie finally caught her wrist.

""Elie, what do you think you're doing?!""

The icy voice came from behind just before she was yanked away with force.

She stumbled and fell to the marble floor, her knee slamming against it with a sharp pain that made her gasp.

Eric stood in front of Clara, shielding her. His black suit made him look even taller and more imposing, but the coldness in his eyes made her shiver.

Clara's tears fell right away. ""Eric, I found out about you and Elie. My best friend and my ex... I was just upset and asked her a few questions, and she tried to hit me.""

""I didn't! She—""

""Enough,"" Eric snapped, cutting Elie off. But when he turned to Clara, his expression softened instantly, even a little panicked. ""Clara, what happened with Elie was a mistake. I just missed you so much that I lost control. You came back, and I chose you. Doesn't that prove who I love?""

Elie's heart felt like it was being crushed in someone's fist.

So that was it. In his eyes, she wasn't even a replacement—just a way to vent his desire.

Clara looked up at him, eyes full of tears. ""Are you sure you don't love her?""

""I don't,"" Eric said flatly, without a moment of hesitation.

""Okay,"" Clara said, pointing at Elie. ""Then prove it. Tell your bodyguards to strip her.""

Elie's whole body went cold. She turned to Eric, but he just stood there in silence, frowning.

""I knew you couldn't let her go!"" Clara shouted. ""Fine then, I'm leaving. I hope you're happy together!""

The words had barely left her mouth when Eric grabbed her arm and gave an order to the guards by the door. ""Do it.""

The two guards stepped forward. Elie struggled desperately, but she was no match for their strength.

""No... please, don't...""

The sound of fabric tearing echoed harshly through the villa. In seconds, her shirt buttons popped off, her skirt was ripped, and her bra strap snapped...

Just as the last shred of clothing was torrn away, Eric finally spoke, ""Enough.

""Get her out of here. I don't want to see you again.""

Elie covered her body and stumbled out the door.

She heard Eric's gentle voice behind her. ""Clara, don't be mad...""

Rain poured hard, stinging against her exposed skin, but it still wasn't nearly as cold as what she felt inside.

She clutched the shredded fabric to her chest, struggling forward in the heavy rain. Rain mixed with tears, running into her mouth, bitter and salty.

And then, like a flood, the past came crashing down on her.

Back in college, Eric was every girl's dream—tall, handsome, and the star of the basketball court. Every game he played brought out a chorus of screaming fans.

Clara was the campus belle—beautiful, fair-skinned, and from a wealthy family.

Elie, on the other hand, was practically invisible. Ordinary looks, ordinary life—nothing that stood out.

Then one day during lunch, Clara suddenly sat down across from her with a tray and a dazzling smile.

""Eating alone is so boring. Let's eat together from now on.""

That was the day Elie became Clara's so-called best friend.

People always said Clara was so nice for hanging out with someone like Elie, the ugly duckling.

But Elie knew the truth. Clara only kept her around to make herself shine brighter.

Then one day, Eric entered their little circle.

At first, Elie thought he liked her. That evening, when a few thugs cornered her in an alley, it was Eric who stepped in to help. The way he stood there, backlit by the sunset, became the brightest memory of her youth.

But it didn't take long for her to realize that Eric only got close to her to pursue Clara.

Because the easiest way was through her best friend.

Even so, Elie helped him.

She could still remember all the times she praised Eric in front of Clara—how she always found excuses to slip away when they were together, and how her diary was filled with ""Eric,"" written again and again, though no one ever knew.

After that, she became like an NPC in their story, watching Eric win Clara over and treat her like a queen.

She thought she'd spend the rest of her life watching them go from dating to marriage, and then having kids.

But everything changed right before graduation, when Clara suddenly broke up with him and left for overseas without looking back.

Eric chased her to the airport and stood in the rain for a full day and night, but all he got was her walking away without a glance.

During that time, Elie stayed by his side.

When he drank too much, she picked up the empty bottles.

When he hit rock bottom, she quietly kept his life in order.

Eventually, she even became his secretary, managing both his work and personal life.

Then came that night at the business banquet. Eric had been drvgged. When she was reaching for her phone to call a doctor, he lost control and pushed her down on the lounge sofa.

Afterward, he didn't even look at her. Still, she couldn't forget the heat of his skin, the sound of his heavy breathing.

It happened a few more times after that, always after he got drunk.

He never kissed her, never looked her in the eye. Just coldly used her.

They'd been friends with benefits for three years.

But the moment Clara came back a month ago, Eric went right back to her without hesitation.

That was when Elie realized it was time to walk away.

So she quietly turned in her resignation and agreed to go back home for the blind dates her mom had set up.

What she didn't expect was that even after all that, Clara still wouldn't let her go.

Elie returned home, drenched from head to toe, when her phone lit up.

She checked it and saw a large bank transfer from Eric. The note was just a cold word, ""Compensation.""

Then another message popped up. ""I know you like me.""

She stared at the screen, her breath catching in her throat.

So he had known all along.

Every stolen glance, every planned ""coincidence,"" the little acts of ""accidental"" kindness—she thought she'd hidden it so well.

""But we were never possible.

""Clara was just too upset today.

""Don't take it personally.

""And don't you dare get jealous and hurt her.""

Each message hit like a knife to the heart.

Elie laughed out loud, laughing so hard that tears spilled from her eyes.

She thought back to all those years.

When he held her while drunk, calling out Clara's name, she held back tears.

When she slipped his birthday gift in with a pile of packages, too afraid to even sign her name.

When he kissed her in the office, he always covered her eyes.

So he'd known all along.

Her fingers hovered over the screen for a long time. Then, finally, she replied, ""Don't worry, Mr. Lawrence. I'll never like you again.""





\###Chapter 2

The moment she hit send, she sank into a bathtub filled with water.

Bubbles slowly rose to the surface, like the love she had buried all these years, finally sinking for good.

The next day, Elie continued to go to work.

But she was shocked to find a photo of her, soaked on her way home, had gone viral online.

""Flat as a board and still dares to run neked? I wouldn't even look if she walked past me! She's clearly desperate for fame. She's gone crazy trying to gain views!""

""Look at how miserable she looks—doesn't seem like she's trying to gain attention, more like a homewrecker who got beaten up! Serves her right. Shameless woman messing with someone else's relationship. Why couldn't she just get hit by a car?""

Reading the cruel, hateful comments, Elie felt awful, but there was nothing she could do.

Worried her mom might see the photos, she anxiously kept scrolling and spent the whole morning reporting them.

Online discussions only grew more intense until someone tried to dox the woman in the photo. But within minutes, the entire trending topic was wiped, and all photos and videos vanished without a trace.

Elie had no idea why, but it brought her a sense of relief.

She forced herself to act normal and got back to work. When she brought some documents to Eric for a signature, she walked in on Clara angrily confronting him.

""You're the one who took down the trending topic, aren't you? No one else has that kind of power! Why would you do that? Do you like her?""

Elie froze; she hadn't expected it to be Eric.

Eric looked at Clara with a frown, clearly frustrated.

""I did take it down, but it's not what you think. She's my assistant. If her identity were exposed, it could hurt the company's stock. I swear, I don't have any feelings for her. Clara, I only like you. Please, believe me.""

Clara was about to say more, but Eric suddenly pulled her into his arms and kissed her, cutting off her words.

She struggled at first, but his skilled and gentle kiss slowly made her give in, her breathing growing unsteady.

Elie stood outside the door, watching the scene, feeling cold all over.

So this was what it looked like when he kissed someone he loved.

His long fingers slipped into her hair, gently pulling her into his arms, eyes filled with undeniable possessiveness and affection.

In three years, he'd done everything intimate with her—except kiss her.

She should've known then. It was because he didn't love her.

A sharp pain struck her heart. Just as she turned to leave, a coffee cup suddenly came flying toward her.

She stumbled and fell hard to the floor, a gash opening on her forehead from the hit. As she raised her hand to cover the wound, Clara's angry voice rang out.

""How long have you been spying at the door? Do you enjoy watching people kissing?""

Elie lowered her head, her voice hoarse as she tried to explain she was just there to deliver documents.

But Clara walked over coldly, lifted her heel, and crushed Elie's hand, grinding down hard on the fingers still clutching the papers.

""Ah!""

The papers were crushed under the pressure, and Elie's hand was scraped, blood seeping through the torrn skin.

Her body trembled from the pain, but Clara clung to Eric's arm and started to complain.

""Eric, look—she's not just a liar; she's incompetent. She ruined the documents, too. Can't you just fire her?""

Eric's gaze darkened. He stayed silent for a moment before speaking quietly, ""She's handling several important contracts right now. I can't fire her for now.""

Clara looked at him suspiciously, her tone laced with dissatisfaction. ""Can't or don't want to?""





\###Chapter 3

Eric lowered his voice and coaxed her, ""I do have work to handle, and I can't afford delays. If it were just about firing a secretary, why would I lie to you?""

Clara still wouldn't let it go. ""Fine, don't fire her. Then make her stay on her knees at the company entrance for a whole day. Is that okay?""

This time, Eric agreed and looked over at Elie.

""These contracts are tied to a major deal. You either pay eight million, or stay on your knees at the entrance for a day.""

Elie knew he was doing this to appease Clara.

There was no way she could come up with eight million, so she staggered to her feet and, enduring the humiliation, stayed on her knees at the front door.

She hung her head low, hiding the burn in her eyes, while the chatter of passing coworkers reached her ears.

""Isn't she Mr. Lawrence's most trusted secretary? Why's she on her knees out here in front of everyone? So embarrassing.""

""I saw it too. She didn't do anything wrong. She just pissed off Ms. Grayson and got punished for it.""

""Ms. Grayson is Mr. Lawrence's first love. Even after all these years apart, he still isn't over her. Messing with Ms. Grayson? Yeah, she had it coming.""

Each word stabbed into Elie like a needle, making it hard to breathe.

She suddenly thought back to school. On Clara's birthday, some boys had made fun of her, saying she was the cow dung that highlighted the campus belle.

Everyone burst into laughter. She'd bolted, hiding in the stairwell.

It was Eric who found her there, handing her a pack of tissues.

""Don't worry about others. Just focus on yourself, that's enough.""

Even now, Elie still remembered those words.

She always thought Eric saw something special in her, and that's why he kept her close. She gave everything to her work, never complained, and always did her best.

But the moment Clara came back, he threw all her years of hard work and loyalty aside, just for Clara.

Yeah... In the end, she was just a secretary he could fire at will.

Now that she was no longer useful, it was time to leave.

Elie stayed on her knees all day. Her skin was torrn and bleeding, and the pain made it nearly impossible to walk.

When work ended, she limped back to the office to grab her bag and ran into Eric.

He glanced at her injuries and frowned slightly.

""Take a few days off. Get some rest. Come back when you're better.""

Elie murmured, ""Okay,"" without looking at him, then turned and walked away.

Once she got home, she treated her wounds and started packing her things.

The moment Clara's return made the news, Eric had told her to move out of the villa.

Back then, she'd left in a hurry, just tossed everything into a box, making a mess.

Now that she was going back to her hometown, she figured it was time to clean things up properly.

She got rid of the jewelry Eric gave her, the photos she'd secretly taken while he was asleep, the diary where she wrote about her crush on him at the university, and all the other little things.

Every now and then, gossip from the office group chat would pop up.

When Clara came back from shopping with sore legs, Eric got down to his knees and gave her a massage. When she complained the office lights were too bright, he had the entire building's lighting replaced overnight. When she was in a bad mood, he canceled all his meetings just to accompany her.

Elie kept scrolling quietly, repeating to herself, ""It'll be over soon. Just hang in there.""

Once her injuries healed, it was time for the company's annual party.

Eric showed up with Clara, and the whole room burst into applause. Everyone was saying how perfect they were for each other—rich, good-looking, a match made in heaven.

He helped Clara down the stage, fixed her dress, took off his jacket to put around her shoulders, and turned down the drinks others tried to toast her with.

Elie sat quietly in a corner, watching the way Eric smiled at Clara. She lowered her eyes silently.

Then came the award ceremony.

Just like every year, Elie won Employee of the Year.

With all eyes on her, Elie stepped onto the stage. The screen behind her started playing a slideshow of her accomplishments over the past year.

She adjusted the mic, ready to give her speech, but suddenly, there was a commotion in the audience.

People were whispering and looking at her with odd expressions.





\###Chapter 4

Elie's eyelid twitched. Something was wrong. She turned around and saw her PPT had been swapped.

The screen was now showing humiliating photos from college, ones that had been secretly taken without her knowing.

Mixed in were censored bed photos, in which her face was clearly visible.

Elie knew right away that those photos came from Eric's villa security footage.

Her whole body went cold, and her mind went blank. She glanced instinctively toward Eric.

He was frowning, but Clara beside him wore a smug, taunting grin.

Elie immediately knew it was her doing. Anger rushed up, and she stepped forward, ready to ask what it would take for Clara to finally leave her alone.

Eric's expression darkened as he stepped in front of her, his voice icy cold.

""What are you doing? Not feeling humiliated enough? Remember, you're just a secretary!""

With tears in her eyes, Elie looked at him. ""Mr. Lawrence, yes, I'm just a secretary, but I'm still a person. Don't I deserve respect? She deliberately showed those photos—

""Enough! Stop acting crazy here!"" Eric snapped, his face dark.

He called the security guards over and had her kicked out.

In front of everyone, they grabbed her by the hair and dragged her out, humiliated her, then shoved her down the high stairs.

She tumbled down, bruised all over, blood seeping out and staining the floor red.

A sharp, tearing pain shot through her whole body, hitting every nerve.

Tears she'd been holding back finally spilled over, clouding her eyes.

She curled up, hugging herself tightly, and slowly blacked out.

When she opened her eyes again, she was in a hospital.

She stared blankly at the ceiling for a long time, then picked up her phone. The office group chat was flooded with talk about the annual party.

Someone had even shared videos and photos, mocking her without holding back.

""Elie's not even that pretty, but turns out she's so wild in private? I thought she was frigid with that cold expression, but she's just a shameless flirt. No idea which guy she's messing around with, but taking that many photos? She must be thirsty.""

""Frigid? She's been all over Mr. Lawrence at work, basically throwing herself at him. Lucky for him, he's only into Ms. Grayson and has never fallen for someone that low.""

""A gold-digger using her body to climb the ranks, like she could ever compare to Ms. Grayson. It's a total insult. Honestly, she should just save herself the embarrassment and leave. If she stays, she's just making a fool of herself.""

Each word felt like a dull knife slicing into Elie's heart, causing unbearable pain.

Her palm was torrn up from clenching so hard, and she bit down until her teeth ached. She was finally barely holding it together.

She had no idea how much time had passed before the ward door opened.

When she looked up, a male coworker from the planning team walked in, holding a cup of water.

""Elie, you're awake! How do you feel? Want me to get the doctor?""

Elie was a little dazed, then shook her head.

""I'm okay. Was it you who brought me here?""

Marcus Schmidt scratched his head awkwardly, giving her a shy smile.

""Yeah, I saw you passed out by the door and got worried, so I brought you to the hospital. Luckily, the doctor said it was just stress.""

The word ""passed out"" brought back memories of the company party, and Elie's face froze.

Marcus realized he'd said the wrong thing and quickly went quiet.

The room stayed silent for a long time before he finally spoke up carefully. ""Elie, don't let those rumors get to you. They're not mad because you did anything wrong, but because they have a prejudice against you. Someone's definitely trying to hurt you by photoshopping those pictures. You can call the police, or if you don't want to deal with that pressure, I can help you. You can just say you're in a normal relationship...""

When she saw his ears turning bright red, Elie recalled how he'd always find random excuses to talk to her, and how he'd bring her coffee or snacks every now and then.

Only then did she realize that Marcus probably had a thing for her.

But she'd only ever seen him as a colleague, and she'd already made up her mind to leave.

So when he hinted at his feelings, Elie forced a small smile and politely turned him down.

""Thanks for your concern, but I can handle this on my own.""

Marcus looked a little crushed, but he wasn't backing down.

He reached under the bed, pulled out a bunch of roses, and nervously handed them to her.

He stammered, ""I-I've liked you for a while now. I just never had the guts to say it. I know the timing's not great, but I wanted to try. Could you give me a chance? Maybe we could try being together—""

Marcus didn't even get to finish his words before the door was kicked open.

Startled, they both turned toward the noise—Eric stood there, furious, with a sullen face.

He glared at Marcus as he spat out, ""Get out!""





\###Chapter 5

Intimidated by Eric's overpowering presence, Marcus shot to his feet and rushed out of the ward, bowing as he left.

Eric slammed the door behind him, then turned to the flowers beside Elie.

""So, he's into you and told you how he feels?""

Elie met his gaze but stayed quiet.

Without waiting for an answer, Eric grabbed the roses and tossed them out the window.

Elie had rejected Marcus, but she didn't want his feelings to be treated like trash.

She pulled out her IV to pick up the flowers, but Eric caught her wrist and pushed her back onto the bed.

He stared her down, eyes cold as ice.

""What are you doing? It's just a crappy bouquet. Don't tell me you like him too?""

Elie pushed him away and said coldly, ""Mr. Lawrence, you're just my boss. Who I'm with is none of your business.""

Eric's expression darkened, and he gripped her wrist so hard it left red marks.

""Yeah, but don't forget company policy says no office relationships. If you even think about saying yes to him, he's out of the Lawrence Group tomorrow.""

Elie knew he always meant what he said, and she didn't want to drag anyone else into this, so she told the truth. ""I don't like him, and I'm not planning to be with him.""

Only then did Eric's expression ease a little. He let go of her hand and finally got to the real reason he came.

""It was indeed Clara who changed the photo at the annual party. But now that she knows the truth, it's understandable she's mad at you. Once things settle down, I'll promote you to head of the secretary department, and your salary will double. Just focus on your work. Clara agreed this was the last time. She won't come after you again, so don't hold it against her anymore.""

His offer sounded great, but Elie wasn't moved.

She took a deep breath, about to tell him she was resigning.

But before she could speak, Clara's call came in.

""Eric, I want to go to the beach for a few days. Will you come with me?""

Eric spoke to her gently, leaving Elie behind without a second thought as he walked out.

He left in such a rush that he didn't hear what she said.

""I don't need a promotion because I already turned in my resignation.""

As the door closed behind him, Elie looked down.

""Forget it. He'll find out sooner or later,"" she thought to herself.

In the days that followed, while Eric stayed with Clara, Elie went back to work like nothing had happened.

Marcus was transferred back to his hometown branch the very next day. Elie didn't even get to see him one last time.

People at the office still gave her weird looks, but no one brought up the annual party anymore.

Things had finally calmed down. Elie went to the HR department to ask if she could leave early.

The HR staff looked troubled. ""Ms. Roberts, if you want to resign early, you'll need Mr. Lawrence's special approval.""

Elie nodded and got to work on her early resignation request.

Right as she was about to find Eric for a signature, he called and sent her an address, telling her to come immediately.

When she got to the private room at the club, Elie realized Eric's friends—and Clara—were all there, laughing and playing games.

As soon as he saw her, Eric looked up and nodded toward the drinks on the table.

""Clara lost a few rounds, but she's on her period and can't drink. You drink for her. 1.5 thousand dollars per glass.""

Elie knew Eric had damaged his stomach from drinking too much in the past. Now he couldn't touch any alccohol at all.

Otherwise, he would drink for Clara himself.

Elie looked at the dozen or so glasses of whiskey on the table.

She said quietly, ""Mr. Lawrence, it's after work hours. I have the right to refuse this assignment. But if you insist I drink for her, I don't want the money; I just want your signature.""

Eric frowned slightly. ""Signature? For what?""

Elie handed him the resignation form. He was just about to open it when Clara tugged on his arm, pouting.

""Eric, I lost again. Hurry up and make her drink for me!""

Eric responded gently to her and didn't bother reading the form.

He signed it without hesitation and tossed the pen back.

""All done. Now drink.""





\###Chapter 6

Elie slipped the agreement into her bag and downed her drink.

She kept going, glass after glass, until her stomach was in knots and she felt like throwing up.

After forcing down the last one, she got up, swaying, heading for the bathroom, but Eric's friends blocked her path.

""Eric, Clara lost again! She picked dare, and the card she got said she had to kiss a random single person here for three minutes!""

Hearing this, Eric didn't even hesitate. He just grabbed Clara and kissed her.

They were immersed in it, and the whole room erupted with cheers and shouts.

Elie sat there, groggy and dazed, watching them kiss like they were in their own little world. A bitter ache spread through her chest.

When the kiss finally ended, Eric still looked like he wanted more, while Clara blushed. But Eric's friends started teasing again.

""That kiss doesn't count! The card said she had to kiss a single guy. You're her boyfriend. Totally doesn't count.""

Eric's smile faded.

""Clara's mine. You really think I'd let her kiss someone else?""

Everyone could tell he was pissed, so they quickly tried to smooth things over and pulled Elie.

""Of course, we wouldn't touch Clara. But hey, there's always a backup option, right? Ms. Roberts can take the dare instead.""

Elie's face went pale in an instant.

She instinctively looked at Eric and saw him refuse with a stiff expression.

""She only agreed to drink. Kissing wasn't part of the deal.""

The guys exchanged glances, then started laughing.

""Come on, that's nothing a little money won't fix. Ms. Roberts always listens to you, doesn't she? Remember when we were racing, and the rule was that if your companion wouldn't get in the car, you'd lose a yacht? You didn't even say anything, just gave her a look, and she got in. If she was willing to risk her life for you, a kiss should be no big deal.""

Clara's eyes welled up with tears as she yanked her hand out of Eric's.

""Didn't you say you didn't have feelings for her? Then why did you take her racing with you? If you like her that much, go make her your girlfriend. I'll find someone else to kiss and finish the dare!""

Then, she stormed off.

Eric panicked. He took out a bank card and threw it at Elie before rushing after Clara.

""There's 150,000 dollars on that card. Kiss in Clara's place for three minutes.""

Watching him walk away, Elie felt like her heart was broken.

She didn't want to agree to this deal. She turned to leave, but Eric's buddies pushed her back down.

They brought over a stray dog, forced its jaw open, and pulled out its tongue. Then, they shoved her toward it with sneering voices full of spite.

""Clara told us everything. You're quite wild. Your bed photos are all over the office, aren't they? A slvt like you trying to seduce Eric? Disgusting!""

""No one would want to kiss you. Touch your saliva and we'll probably end up in the hospital. A dog's the only thing you're good for. You know what they say—sluts and dogs are a perfect match.""

Elie was so humiliated that tears streamed down her face as a wave of nausea hit her.

She threw up uncontrollably, bile mixed with blood splattered across the floor.

By the end of it, she was completely drained, her eyes blank and lifeless.

As they walked away, laughing out loud, only one thought remained in her mind—she was done with Eric. She would never come back.





\###Chapter 7

Elie submitted her early resignation form to HR and watched them stamp it.

""Since Mr. Lawrence approved it, Ms. Roberts, you should hand over all your work, and you can leave in three days.""

After days of feeling down, Elie's mood finally started to lift.

She headed back to her desk to finish up her remaining work.

After two days of sorting everything and handing it off to her coworkers, she packed up her things into a box.

Just as she finished, Eric walked in.

He glanced at her empty desk and was a bit caught off guard.

""Why are you packing up?""

Elie was about to answer, but he seemed to remember something and nodded.

""Yeah. Now that you've been promoted, you'll have your own office. You can pack up later. Come with me first.""

Without waiting for her response, he turned and left.

Elie hesitated for a second, then quietly followed him to the auction venue.

Clara was already there. When she saw Elie, a hint of disdain crossed her face as she stepped up and grabbed Eric's arm.

""Eric, I've already picked out the jewelry I want. No matter what, you have to buy all of it for me.""

Eric smiled dotingly and helped her sit down.

""Don't worry. Whatever you want, I'll get it.""

Elie stood quietly in the corner, watching them laugh and flirt, but she felt nothing.

Once the auction started, Eric would buy everything Clara had her eye on.

His over-the-top bids had the whole room stunned, with people turning to stare.

""Bidding on everything she wants? Mr. Lawrence is spoiling his girlfriend. She gets whatever she wants, like a personal wishing well. Ms. Grayson must've been a hero in a past life or something.""

""I heard that ever since they started dating, Ms. Grayson's gotten whatever she wanted. Guess nothing's changed after all these years. Mr. Lawrence is infatuated.""

Clara beamed at all the jealous praise.

She casually tossed the auction catalog at Elie, then turned to Eric and started acting cute.

""I wanna use the restroom. Eric, come with me?""

Eric got up without hesitation, leaving Elie with a quick instruction.

""Bid on everything that's marked in the catalog.""

Elie said nothing, just nodded, and made sure to bid on every single item as told.

Just as Elie was about to leave, the auctioneer suddenly introduced a brand-new item.

""Ladies and gentlemen, we're now moving on to the surprise lot of the evening—a pinkish-purple necklace featuring a 40.52-carat Alexandrite. The starting price is 1.5 million.""

The surprise item caught everyone off guard, and the sparkling necklace immediately stole the spotlight.

Bids quickly erupted throughout the room, driving the necklace's price sky-high.

Elie took a photo and sent it to Eric, asking if he wanted to bid on it.

But Eric didn't reply. She tried calling a few times, but he didn't pick up.

While she was still trying to reach him, the necklace was sold for 80 million.

The moment the final bid was called, Clara happened to come back.

Clara spotted the necklace and instantly wanted it. When she realized it had been sold, she picked up a glass of red wine and poured it on Elie's face.

""I told you to bid on everything I liked! What the hel were you doing?""

Elie's hair and clothes were soaked. She clenched her hands tightly, trying hard to keep her voice calm.

""This necklace wasn't in the catalog. It was a surprise item. I called Mr. Lawrence, but he didn't answer...""

But Clara didn't care about her explanation. She turned to Eric with a pitiful look.

""Eric, not only is Elie useless, but now she also shirks responsibility! I don't care. I want that necklace. If you don't get it for me, I will ignore you.""

Eric had seen Elie's message and knew it wasn't her fault.

But in front of Clara, he couldn't defend Elie. He could only go along and try to soothe Clara.

""Have I ever said no to something you wanted? Be good, I'll have someone buy it back right now.""

He called over a staff member, his tone stern. ""Find the buyer and negotiate. If they're willing to give it up, meet any condition they ask.""

Elie stood silently, her wet shirt stuck to her body, and wine still dripping from her hair.

Seeing the smug look on Clara's face, she suddenly had a bad feeling.

The staff member came back quickly, looking a bit uneasy. ""Mr. Lawrence, the buyer agreed to hand over the necklace, but...""

""Go on,"" Eric said, frowning.

""He has one condition..."" the staff member said hesitantly. ""He wants your secretary to spend the night with him. He said...""

He braced himself and continued, ""He said she may look plain, but after having nothing but gourmet meals, sometimes it's nice to try something simple.""





\###Chapter 8

Elie was struck as if by lightning, and she looked up suddenly at Clara.

The smug smile at the corner of the other's mouth confirmed her guess, which she couldn't hide in time.

What hidden items, what mysterious buyers, all are carefully designed traps.

""Mr. Lawrence, Elie's voice trembled, ""you can't agree, I'm leaving after today...""

""Eric,"" Clara suddenly threw herself into Eric's arms, interrupting him, ""I want that necklace! You promised me.""

She looked up, tears welling in her eyes, ""Am I not as important to you as a secretary in your heart?""

Eric looked down at Clara in his arms, then glanced at the pale-faced Elie.

He wiped away Clara's tears with his hand and whispered, ""Don't cry.""

Then he turned to the staff and said, ""Tell the buyer, deal done.""

Elie's blood froze in an instant: ""Eric! You can't-""

Before the words had even finished, someone had already grabbed her arm.

She struggled desperately, her nails scratching blood marks on the bodyguard's arm: ""Let me go! Eric! I'm quitting tomorrow! You have no right...""

Her voice was cut off by the slamming of the car door.

The black sedan sped away, and in the rearview mirror, Eric was gently putting a coat on Clara.

In the luxury suite, Elie was pushed in roughly.

With a click, the door locked behind her, and she turned around to see a beggar covered in dirt greedily staring at her.

The beggar grinned, revealing his uneven yellow teeth.

Elie trembled all over, staggering backwards. ""Don't come any closer... I can give you money...""

""Money? The beggar grabbed her wrist, his foul breath hitting her face as he chuckled. ""The money that lady gave me is enough to last me a lifetime! I don't need money now, I need a woman!""

Elie was desperate and could only grab the desk lamp for self-defense. When the beggar pounced on her, she fiercely smashed his head.

Blood flowed down his forehead, instead arousing his ferocity.

""Jerrk! he grabbed her hair and threw her onto the bed.""

The sound of fabric tearing was particularly harsh in the room.

Elie's nails left deep blood marks on the beggar's face, but they were no match for the man's strength.

Just when she was completely desperate—

""Bang!""

The door was kicked open.

Eric's bodyguard rushed in and quickly subdued the beggar.

""Ms. Roberts, the bodyguard holding out a coat began, ""Mr. Lawrence sent us to rescue you.""

Elie shivered as she wrapped her coat tightly around her, reaching for her phone to call the police.

The bodyguard quickly snetched the phone: ""Mr. Lawrence instructed that you cannot call the police.""

""What does it mean? Elie asked hoarsely.""

""Ms. Grayson didn't mean it, she just wanted to vent. Mr. Lawrence has already arranged for someone to save you, you're fine, let's just forget about it.""

Elie was struck as if by lightning: ""He... knew?""

The bodyguard resigned.

Elie suddenly laughed, laughing so hard that tears streamed down his face.

Originally, Eric knew everything, but still allowed Clara to push her towards the abyss.

Her eyes welled up with tears, ""What if I had to call the police?""

""No one in New York dares to take your case, the bodyguard said expressionlessly. ""Mr. Lawrence said to give you a week off, so you can rest well these days, consider it as compensation.""

After speaking, the bodyguard's figure disappeared at the end of the corridor, and the door made a soft ""click"" sound.

Elie sat down slowly on the ground, pressing his fingertips deeply into the palm of his hand.

The suit jacket slipped off her shoulders, revealing a torrn collar. She reached out to pick it up, only to find her hand shaking uncontrollably.

The phone suddenly rang, and the word ""Mom"" on the screen stabbed her eyes.

""Elie, have you finished the handover? Have you arranged all the blind dates?""

Elie bit down hard on his lower lip, the taste of rust spreading in his mouth, but it was nothing compared to the pain in his heart.

""Okay, Mom, she heard her own terrifyingly calm voice, ""I'll go back today.""

The moment the phone hung up, tears finally burst out.

Ten years of time passed by like a revolving lantern in front of my eyes.

On the college campus, the figure of a young man walking against the light.

In the president's office, his breath was scorching hot after he got drunk.

And tonight, he uttered the indifferent words ""deal"" as well.

Every frame of memory turned into a sharp knife, tearing her heart apart.

Ten years of infatuation, resulted in one trampling after another.

Elie slowly stood up, picked up the coat on the ground, straightened out his disheveled clothes, and returned to the apartment alone.

Her emotions had completely calmed down. Within just thirty minutes, she calmly cancelled the apartment rental, packed all her belongings, left the keys behind, and took a taxi with her suitcase.

The taxi drove through the puddles and headed towards the airport.

There was a one-way ticket leading to a life without Eric. I Won't Give My Heart to You

Because he wanted to please his first love.

In seconds, my shirt buttons popped off, my skirt was ripped, and my bra strap snapped...

I clutched the shredded fabric to her chest, struggling forward in the heavy rain.

When I realized it was time to walk away, I thought everything was over.

But the next day, I found that everyone was discussing my neked photo in the rain.



Right after Elie Roberts submitted her resignation, her mom called.

""Elie, how's the resignation going?""

""I've already turned it in. I'll officially be out in a month.""

""That's great,"" her mom said, sounding more cheerful. ""The friends in town and I picked out a few decent boys for you. Meet them when you're back, okay? Let's try to get you engaged this year.""

Then she sighed. ""And stop thinking about that heir from the Lawrence family. He's from a whole different world. We're not the same.""

Elie's throat tightened, eyes started to tear up. ""It's okay, Mom. I get it. I'll be back after I finish the handover.""

After hanging up, Elie started packing up her desk.

Years at the Lawrence Group had left her with way too much to sort through. She was only halfway done when her phone vibrated again.

It was a message from Clara Grayson: a location pin, followed by two words, ""Come over.""

The address was none other than Eric Lawrence's villa.

Twenty minutes later, Elie was standing at his front door.

The front door was ajar, so she pushed it open and walked in. Clara was standing in the middle of the living room, holding a bracelet.

Elie's heart sank. She was sure she'd cleared everything out when she moved out of this place. How did something get left behind?

Before she could react, Clara slapped her across the face.

""I've been trying to figure out who was with Eric while I was abroad, and I never would've guessed—it was you, my best friend!

""Elie, with that plain face and flat figure? You really think you could seduce Eric?""

Elie trembled, shame crashing over her like a wave.

""Clara, it was a mistake between him and me. And we're just friends with benefits... It only happened after you two broke up. I never crossed the line before that.""

Smack!

Clara slapped her again. ""Breakup or not, Eric will always be mine. Who do you think you are?""

This one hit harder—Elie felt blood at the corner of her mouth. When Clara raised her hand for a third slap, Elie finally caught her wrist.

""Elie, what do you think you're doing?!""

The icy voice came from behind just before she was yanked away with force.

She stumbled and fell to the marble floor, her knee slamming against it with a sharp pain that made her gasp.

Eric stood in front of Clara, shielding her. His black suit made him look even taller and more imposing, but the coldness in his eyes made her shiver.

Clara's tears fell right away. ""Eric, I found out about you and Elie. My best friend and my ex... I was just upset and asked her a few questions, and she tried to hit me.""

""I didn't! She—""

""Enough,"" Eric snapped, cutting Elie off. But when he turned to Clara, his expression softened instantly, even a little panicked. ""Clara, what happened with Elie was a mistake. I just missed you so much that I lost control. You came back, and I chose you. Doesn't that prove who I love?""

Elie's heart felt like it was being crushed in someone's fist.

So that was it. In his eyes, she wasn't even a replacement—just a way to vent his desire.

Clara looked up at him, eyes full of tears. ""Are you sure you don't love her?""

""I don't,"" Eric said flatly, without a moment of hesitation.

""Okay,"" Clara said, pointing at Elie. ""Then prove it. Tell your bodyguards to strip her.""

Elie's whole body went cold. She turned to Eric, but he just stood there in silence, frowning.

""I knew you couldn't let her go!"" Clara shouted. ""Fine then, I'm leaving. I hope you're happy together!""

The words had barely left her mouth when Eric grabbed her arm and gave an order to the guards by the door. ""Do it.""

The two guards stepped forward. Elie struggled desperately, but she was no match for their strength.

""No... please, don't...""

The sound of fabric tearing echoed harshly through the villa. In seconds, her shirt buttons popped off, her skirt was ripped, and her bra strap snapped...

Just as the last shred of clothing was torrn away, Eric finally spoke, ""Enough.

""Get her out of here. I don't want to see you again.""

Elie covered her body and stumbled out the door.

She heard Eric's gentle voice behind her. ""Clara, don't be mad...""

Rain poured hard, stinging against her exposed skin, but it still wasn't nearly as cold as what she felt inside.

She clutched the shredded fabric to her chest, struggling forward in the heavy rain. Rain mixed with tears, running into her mouth, bitter and salty.

And then, like a flood, the past came crashing down on her.

Back in college, Eric was every girl's dream—tall, handsome, and the star of the basketball court. Every game he played brought out a chorus of screaming fans.

Clara was the campus belle—beautiful, fair-skinned, and from a wealthy family.

Elie, on the other hand, was practically invisible. Ordinary looks, ordinary life—nothing that stood out.

Then one day during lunch, Clara suddenly sat down across from her with a tray and a dazzling smile.

""Eating alone is so boring. Let's eat together from now on.""

That was the day Elie became Clara's so-called best friend.

People always said Clara was so nice for hanging out with someone like Elie, the ugly duckling.

But Elie knew the truth. Clara only kept her around to make herself shine brighter.

Then one day, Eric entered their little circle.

At first, Elie thought he liked her. That evening, when a few thugs cornered her in an alley, it was Eric who stepped in to help. The way he stood there, backlit by the sunset, became the brightest memory of her youth.

But it didn't take long for her to realize that Eric only got close to her to pursue Clara.

Because the easiest way was through her best friend.

Even so, Elie helped him.

She could still remember all the times she praised Eric in front of Clara—how she always found excuses to slip away when they were together, and how her diary was filled with ""Eric,"" written again and again, though no one ever knew.

After that, she became like an NPC in their story, watching Eric win Clara over and treat her like a queen.

She thought she'd spend the rest of her life watching them go from dating to marriage, and then having kids.

But everything changed right before graduation, when Clara suddenly broke up with him and left for overseas without looking back.

Eric chased her to the airport and stood in the rain for a full day and night, but all he got was her walking away without a glance.

During that time, Elie stayed by his side.

When he drank too much, she picked up the empty bottles.

When he hit rock bottom, she quietly kept his life in order.

Eventually, she even became his secretary, managing both his work and personal life.

Then came that night at the business banquet. Eric had been drvgged. When she was reaching for her phone to call a doctor, he lost control and pushed her down on the lounge sofa.

Afterward, he didn't even look at her. Still, she couldn't forget the heat of his skin, the sound of his heavy breathing.

It happened a few more times after that, always after he got drunk.

He never kissed her, never looked her in the eye. Just coldly used her.

They'd been friends with benefits for three years.

But the moment Clara came back a month ago, Eric went right back to her without hesitation.

That was when Elie realized it was time to walk away.

So she quietly turned in her resignation and agreed to go back home for the blind dates her mom had set up.

What she didn't expect was that even after all that, Clara still wouldn't let her go.

Elie returned home, drenched from head to toe, when her phone lit up.

She checked it and saw a large bank transfer from Eric. The note was just a cold word, ""Compensation.""

Then another message popped up. ""I know you like me.""

She stared at the screen, her breath catching in her throat.

So he had known all along.

Every stolen glance, every planned ""coincidence,"" the little acts of ""accidental"" kindness—she thought she'd hidden it so well.

""But we were never possible.

""Clara was just too upset today.

""Don't take it personally.

""And don't you dare get jealous and hurt her.""

Each message hit like a knife to the heart.

Elie laughed out loud, laughing so hard that tears spilled from her eyes.

She thought back to all those years.

When he held her while drunk, calling out Clara's name, she held back tears.

When she slipped his birthday gift in with a pile of packages, too afraid to even sign her name.

When he kissed her in the office, he always covered her eyes.

So he'd known all along.

Her fingers hovered over the screen for a long time. Then, finally, she replied, ""Don't worry, Mr. Lawrence. I'll never like you again.""





\###Chapter 2

The moment she hit send, she sank into a bathtub filled with water.

Bubbles slowly rose to the surface, like the love she had buried all these years, finally sinking for good.

The next day, Elie continued to go to work.

But she was shocked to find a photo of her, soaked on her way home, had gone viral online.

""Flat as a board and still dares to run neked? I wouldn't even look if she walked past me! She's clearly desperate for fame. She's gone crazy trying to gain views!""

""Look at how miserable she looks—doesn't seem like she's trying to gain attention, more like a homewrecker who got beaten up! Serves her right. Shameless woman messing with someone else's relationship. Why couldn't she just get hit by a car?""

Reading the cruel, hateful comments, Elie felt awful, but there was nothing she could do.

Worried her mom might see the photos, she anxiously kept scrolling and spent the whole morning reporting them.

Online discussions only grew more intense until someone tried to dox the woman in the photo. But within minutes, the entire trending topic was wiped, and all photos and videos vanished without a trace.

Elie had no idea why, but it brought her a sense of relief.

She forced herself to act normal and got back to work. When she brought some documents to Eric for a signature, she walked in on Clara angrily confronting him.

""You're the one who took down the trending topic, aren't you? No one else has that kind of power! Why would you do that? Do you like her?""

Elie froze; she hadn't expected it to be Eric.

Eric looked at Clara with a frown, clearly frustrated.

""I did take it down, but it's not what you think. She's my assistant. If her identity were exposed, it could hurt the company's stock. I swear, I don't have any feelings for her. Clara, I only like you. Please, believe me.""

Clara was about to say more, but Eric suddenly pulled her into his arms and kissed her, cutting off her words.

She struggled at first, but his skilled and gentle kiss slowly made her give in, her breathing growing unsteady.

Elie stood outside the door, watching the scene, feeling cold all over.

So this was what it looked like when he kissed someone he loved.

His long fingers slipped into her hair, gently pulling her into his arms, eyes filled with undeniable possessiveness and affection.

In three years, he'd done everything intimate with her—except kiss her.

She should've known then. It was because he didn't love her.

A sharp pain struck her heart. Just as she turned to leave, a coffee cup suddenly came flying toward her.

She stumbled and fell hard to the floor, a gash opening on her forehead from the hit. As she raised her hand to cover the wound, Clara's angry voice rang out.

""How long have you been spying at the door? Do you enjoy watching people kissing?""

Elie lowered her head, her voice hoarse as she tried to explain she was just there to deliver documents.

But Clara walked over coldly, lifted her heel, and crushed Elie's hand, grinding down hard on the fingers still clutching the papers.

""Ah!""

The papers were crushed under the pressure, and Elie's hand was scraped, blood seeping through the torrn skin.

Her body trembled from the pain, but Clara clung to Eric's arm and started to complain.

""Eric, look—she's not just a liar; she's incompetent. She ruined the documents, too. Can't you just fire her?""

Eric's gaze darkened. He stayed silent for a moment before speaking quietly, ""She's handling several important contracts right now. I can't fire her for now.""

Clara looked at him suspiciously, her tone laced with dissatisfaction. ""Can't or don't want to?""





\###Chapter 3

Eric lowered his voice and coaxed her, ""I do have work to handle, and I can't afford delays. If it were just about firing a secretary, why would I lie to you?""

Clara still wouldn't let it go. ""Fine, don't fire her. Then make her stay on her knees at the company entrance for a whole day. Is that okay?""

This time, Eric agreed and looked over at Elie.

""These contracts are tied to a major deal. You either pay eight million, or stay on your knees at the entrance for a day.""

Elie knew he was doing this to appease Clara.

There was no way she could come up with eight million, so she staggered to her feet and, enduring the humiliation, stayed on her knees at the front door.

She hung her head low, hiding the burn in her eyes, while the chatter of passing coworkers reached her ears.

""Isn't she Mr. Lawrence's most trusted secretary? Why's she on her knees out here in front of everyone? So embarrassing.""

""I saw it too. She didn't do anything wrong. She just pissed off Ms. Grayson and got punished for it.""

""Ms. Grayson is Mr. Lawrence's first love. Even after all these years apart, he still isn't over her. Messing with Ms. Grayson? Yeah, she had it coming.""

Each word stabbed into Elie like a needle, making it hard to breathe.

She suddenly thought back to school. On Clara's birthday, some boys had made fun of her, saying she was the cow dung that highlighted the campus belle.

Everyone burst into laughter. She'd bolted, hiding in the stairwell.

It was Eric who found her there, handing her a pack of tissues.

""Don't worry about others. Just focus on yourself, that's enough.""

Even now, Elie still remembered those words.

She always thought Eric saw something special in her, and that's why he kept her close. She gave everything to her work, never complained, and always did her best.

But the moment Clara came back, he threw all her years of hard work and loyalty aside, just for Clara.

Yeah... In the end, she was just a secretary he could fire at will.

Now that she was no longer useful, it was time to leave.

Elie stayed on her knees all day. Her skin was torrn and bleeding, and the pain made it nearly impossible to walk.

When work ended, she limped back to the office to grab her bag and ran into Eric.

He glanced at her injuries and frowned slightly.

""Take a few days off. Get some rest. Come back when you're better.""

Elie murmured, ""Okay,"" without looking at him, then turned and walked away.

Once she got home, she treated her wounds and started packing her things.

The moment Clara's return made the news, Eric had told her to move out of the villa.

Back then, she'd left in a hurry, just tossed everything into a box, making a mess.

Now that she was going back to her hometown, she figured it was time to clean things up properly.

She got rid of the jewelry Eric gave her, the photos she'd secretly taken while he was asleep, the diary where she wrote about her crush on him at the university, and all the other little things.

Every now and then, gossip from the office group chat would pop up.

When Clara came back from shopping with sore legs, Eric got down to his knees and gave her a massage. When she complained the office lights were too bright, he had the entire building's lighting replaced overnight. When she was in a bad mood, he canceled all his meetings just to accompany her.

Elie kept scrolling quietly, repeating to herself, ""It'll be over soon. Just hang in there.""

Once her injuries healed, it was time for the company's annual party.

Eric showed up with Clara, and the whole room burst into applause. Everyone was saying how perfect they were for each other—rich, good-looking, a match made in heaven.

He helped Clara down the stage, fixed her dress, took off his jacket to put around her shoulders, and turned down the drinks others tried to toast her with.

Elie sat quietly in a corner, watching the way Eric smiled at Clara. She lowered her eyes silently.

Then came the award ceremony.

Just like every year, Elie won Employee of the Year.

With all eyes on her, Elie stepped onto the stage. The screen behind her started playing a slideshow of her accomplishments over the past year.

She adjusted the mic, ready to give her speech, but suddenly, there was a commotion in the audience.

People were whispering and looking at her with odd expressions.





\###Chapter 4

Elie's eyelid twitched. Something was wrong. She turned around and saw her PPT had been swapped.

The screen was now showing humiliating photos from college, ones that had been secretly taken without her knowing.

Mixed in were censored bed photos, in which her face was clearly visible.

Elie knew right away that those photos came from Eric's villa security footage.

Her whole body went cold, and her mind went blank. She glanced instinctively toward Eric.

He was frowning, but Clara beside him wore a smug, taunting grin.

Elie immediately knew it was her doing. Anger rushed up, and she stepped forward, ready to ask what it would take for Clara to finally leave her alone.

Eric's expression darkened as he stepped in front of her, his voice icy cold.

""What are you doing? Not feeling humiliated enough? Remember, you're just a secretary!""

With tears in her eyes, Elie looked at him. ""Mr. Lawrence, yes, I'm just a secretary, but I'm still a person. Don't I deserve respect? She deliberately showed those photos—

""Enough! Stop acting crazy here!"" Eric snapped, his face dark.

He called the security guards over and had her kicked out.

In front of everyone, they grabbed her by the hair and dragged her out, humiliated her, then shoved her down the high stairs.

She tumbled down, bruised all over, blood seeping out and staining the floor red.

A sharp, tearing pain shot through her whole body, hitting every nerve.

Tears she'd been holding back finally spilled over, clouding her eyes.

She curled up, hugging herself tightly, and slowly blacked out.

When she opened her eyes again, she was in a hospital.

She stared blankly at the ceiling for a long time, then picked up her phone. The office group chat was flooded with talk about the annual party.

Someone had even shared videos and photos, mocking her without holding back.

""Elie's not even that pretty, but turns out she's so wild in private? I thought she was frigid with that cold expression, but she's just a shameless flirt. No idea which guy she's messing around with, but taking that many photos? She must be thirsty.""

""Frigid? She's been all over Mr. Lawrence at work, basically throwing herself at him. Lucky for him, he's only into Ms. Grayson and has never fallen for someone that low.""

""A gold-digger using her body to climb the ranks, like she could ever compare to Ms. Grayson. It's a total insult. Honestly, she should just save herself the embarrassment and leave. If she stays, she's just making a fool of herself.""

Each word felt like a dull knife slicing into Elie's heart, causing unbearable pain.

Her palm was torrn up from clenching so hard, and she bit down until her teeth ached. She was finally barely holding it together.

She had no idea how much time had passed before the ward door opened.

When she looked up, a male coworker from the planning team walked in, holding a cup of water.

""Elie, you're awake! How do you feel? Want me to get the doctor?""

Elie was a little dazed, then shook her head.

""I'm okay. Was it you who brought me here?""

Marcus Schmidt scratched his head awkwardly, giving her a shy smile.

""Yeah, I saw you passed out by the door and got worried, so I brought you to the hospital. Luckily, the doctor said it was just stress.""

The word ""passed out"" brought back memories of the company party, and Elie's face froze.

Marcus realized he'd said the wrong thing and quickly went quiet.

The room stayed silent for a long time before he finally spoke up carefully. ""Elie, don't let those rumors get to you. They're not mad because you did anything wrong, but because they have a prejudice against you. Someone's definitely trying to hurt you by photoshopping those pictures. You can call the police, or if you don't want to deal with that pressure, I can help you. You can just say you're in a normal relationship...""

When she saw his ears turning bright red, Elie recalled how he'd always find random excuses to talk to her, and how he'd bring her coffee or snacks every now and then.

Only then did she realize that Marcus probably had a thing for her.

But she'd only ever seen him as a colleague, and she'd already made up her mind to leave.

So when he hinted at his feelings, Elie forced a small smile and politely turned him down.

""Thanks for your concern, but I can handle this on my own.""

Marcus looked a little crushed, but he wasn't backing down.

He reached under the bed, pulled out a bunch of roses, and nervously handed them to her.

He stammered, ""I-I've liked you for a while now. I just never had the guts to say it. I know the timing's not great, but I wanted to try. Could you give me a chance? Maybe we could try being together—""

Marcus didn't even get to finish his words before the door was kicked open.

Startled, they both turned toward the noise—Eric stood there, furious, with a sullen face.

He glared at Marcus as he spat out, ""Get out!""





\###Chapter 5

Intimidated by Eric's overpowering presence, Marcus shot to his feet and rushed out of the ward, bowing as he left.

Eric slammed the door behind him, then turned to the flowers beside Elie.

""So, he's into you and told you how he feels?""

Elie met his gaze but stayed quiet.

Without waiting for an answer, Eric grabbed the roses and tossed them out the window.

Elie had rejected Marcus, but she didn't want his feelings to be treated like trash.

She pulled out her IV to pick up the flowers, but Eric caught her wrist and pushed her back onto the bed.

He stared her down, eyes cold as ice.

""What are you doing? It's just a crappy bouquet. Don't tell me you like him too?""

Elie pushed him away and said coldly, ""Mr. Lawrence, you're just my boss. Who I'm with is none of your business.""

Eric's expression darkened, and he gripped her wrist so hard it left red marks.

""Yeah, but don't forget company policy says no office relationships. If you even think about saying yes to him, he's out of the Lawrence Group tomorrow.""

Elie knew he always meant what he said, and she didn't want to drag anyone else into this, so she told the truth. ""I don't like him, and I'm not planning to be with him.""

Only then did Eric's expression ease a little. He let go of her hand and finally got to the real reason he came.

""It was indeed Clara who changed the photo at the annual party. But now that she knows the truth, it's understandable she's mad at you. Once things settle down, I'll promote you to head of the secretary department, and your salary will double. Just focus on your work. Clara agreed this was the last time. She won't come after you again, so don't hold it against her anymore.""

His offer sounded great, but Elie wasn't moved.

She took a deep breath, about to tell him she was resigning.

But before she could speak, Clara's call came in.

""Eric, I want to go to the beach for a few days. Will you come with me?""

Eric spoke to her gently, leaving Elie behind without a second thought as he walked out.

He left in such a rush that he didn't hear what she said.

""I don't need a promotion because I already turned in my resignation.""

As the door closed behind him, Elie looked down.

""Forget it. He'll find out sooner or later,"" she thought to herself.

In the days that followed, while Eric stayed with Clara, Elie went back to work like nothing had happened.

Marcus was transferred back to his hometown branch the very next day. Elie didn't even get to see him one last time.

People at the office still gave her weird looks, but no one brought up the annual party anymore.

Things had finally calmed down. Elie went to the HR department to ask if she could leave early.

The HR staff looked troubled. ""Ms. Roberts, if you want to resign early, you'll need Mr. Lawrence's special approval.""

Elie nodded and got to work on her early resignation request.

Right as she was about to find Eric for a signature, he called and sent her an address, telling her to come immediately.

When she got to the private room at the club, Elie realized Eric's friends—and Clara—were all there, laughing and playing games.

As soon as he saw her, Eric looked up and nodded toward the drinks on the table.

""Clara lost a few rounds, but she's on her period and can't drink. You drink for her. 1.5 thousand dollars per glass.""

Elie knew Eric had damaged his stomach from drinking too much in the past. Now he couldn't touch any alccohol at all.

Otherwise, he would drink for Clara himself.

Elie looked at the dozen or so glasses of whiskey on the table.

She said quietly, ""Mr. Lawrence, it's after work hours. I have the right to refuse this assignment. But if you insist I drink for her, I don't want the money; I just want your signature.""

Eric frowned slightly. ""Signature? For what?""

Elie handed him the resignation form. He was just about to open it when Clara tugged on his arm, pouting.

""Eric, I lost again. Hurry up and make her drink for me!""

Eric responded gently to her and didn't bother reading the form.

He signed it without hesitation and tossed the pen back.

""All done. Now drink.""





\###Chapter 6

Elie slipped the agreement into her bag and downed her drink.

She kept going, glass after glass, until her stomach was in knots and she felt like throwing up.

After forcing down the last one, she got up, swaying, heading for the bathroom, but Eric's friends blocked her path.

""Eric, Clara lost again! She picked dare, and the card she got said she had to kiss a random single person here for three minutes!""

Hearing this, Eric didn't even hesitate. He just grabbed Clara and kissed her.

They were immersed in it, and the whole room erupted with cheers and shouts.

Elie sat there, groggy and dazed, watching them kiss like they were in their own little world. A bitter ache spread through her chest.

When the kiss finally ended, Eric still looked like he wanted more, while Clara blushed. But Eric's friends started teasing again.

""That kiss doesn't count! The card said she had to kiss a single guy. You're her boyfriend. Totally doesn't count.""

Eric's smile faded.

""Clara's mine. You really think I'd let her kiss someone else?""

Everyone could tell he was pissed, so they quickly tried to smooth things over and pulled Elie.

""Of course, we wouldn't touch Clara. But hey, there's always a backup option, right? Ms. Roberts can take the dare instead.""

Elie's face went pale in an instant.

She instinctively looked at Eric and saw him refuse with a stiff expression.

""She only agreed to drink. Kissing wasn't part of the deal.""

The guys exchanged glances, then started laughing.

""Come on, that's nothing a little money won't fix. Ms. Roberts always listens to you, doesn't she? Remember when we were racing, and the rule was that if your companion wouldn't get in the car, you'd lose a yacht? You didn't even say anything, just gave her a look, and she got in. If she was willing to risk her life for you, a kiss should be no big deal.""

Clara's eyes welled up with tears as she yanked her hand out of Eric's.

""Didn't you say you didn't have feelings for her? Then why did you take her racing with you? If you like her that much, go make her your girlfriend. I'll find someone else to kiss and finish the dare!""

Then, she stormed off.

Eric panicked. He took out a bank card and threw it at Elie before rushing after Clara.

""There's 150,000 dollars on that card. Kiss in Clara's place for three minutes.""

Watching him walk away, Elie felt like her heart was broken.

She didn't want to agree to this deal. She turned to leave, but Eric's buddies pushed her back down.

They brought over a stray dog, forced its jaw open, and pulled out its tongue. Then, they shoved her toward it with sneering voices full of spite.

""Clara told us everything. You're quite wild. Your bed photos are all over the office, aren't they? A slvt like you trying to seduce Eric? Disgusting!""

""No one would want to kiss you. Touch your saliva and we'll probably end up in the hospital. A dog's the only thing you're good for. You know what they say—sluts and dogs are a perfect match.""

Elie was so humiliated that tears streamed down her face as a wave of nausea hit her.

She threw up uncontrollably, bile mixed with blood splattered across the floor.

By the end of it, she was completely drained, her eyes blank and lifeless.

As they walked away, laughing out loud, only one thought remained in her mind—she was done with Eric. She would never come back.





\###Chapter 7

Elie submitted her early resignation form to HR and watched them stamp it.

""Since Mr. Lawrence approved it, Ms. Roberts, you should hand over all your work, and you can leave in three days.""

After days of feeling down, Elie's mood finally started to lift.

She headed back to her desk to finish up her remaining work.

After two days of sorting everything and handing it off to her coworkers, she packed up her things into a box.

Just as she finished, Eric walked in.

He glanced at her empty desk and was a bit caught off guard.

""Why are you packing up?""

Elie was about to answer, but he seemed to remember something and nodded.

""Yeah. Now that you've been promoted, you'll have your own office. You can pack up later. Come with me first.""

Without waiting for her response, he turned and left.

Elie hesitated for a second, then quietly followed him to the auction venue.

Clara was already there. When she saw Elie, a hint of disdain crossed her face as she stepped up and grabbed Eric's arm.

""Eric, I've already picked out the jewelry I want. No matter what, you have to buy all of it for me.""

Eric smiled dotingly and helped her sit down.

""Don't worry. Whatever you want, I'll get it.""

Elie stood quietly in the corner, watching them laugh and flirt, but she felt nothing.

Once the auction started, Eric would buy everything Clara had her eye on.

His over-the-top bids had the whole room stunned, with people turning to stare.

""Bidding on everything she wants? Mr. Lawrence is spoiling his girlfriend. She gets whatever she wants, like a personal wishing well. Ms. Grayson must've been a hero in a past life or something.""

""I heard that ever since they started dating, Ms. Grayson's gotten whatever she wanted. Guess nothing's changed after all these years. Mr. Lawrence is infatuated.""

Clara beamed at all the jealous praise.

She casually tossed the auction catalog at Elie, then turned to Eric and started acting cute.

""I wanna use the restroom. Eric, come with me?""

Eric got up without hesitation, leaving Elie with a quick instruction.

""Bid on everything that's marked in the catalog.""

Elie said nothing, just nodded, and made sure to bid on every single item as told.

Just as Elie was about to leave, the auctioneer suddenly introduced a brand-new item.

""Ladies and gentlemen, we're now moving on to the surprise lot of the evening—a pinkish-purple necklace featuring a 40.52-carat Alexandrite. The starting price is 1.5 million.""

The surprise item caught everyone off guard, and the sparkling necklace immediately stole the spotlight.

Bids quickly erupted throughout the room, driving the necklace's price sky-high.

Elie took a photo and sent it to Eric, asking if he wanted to bid on it.

But Eric didn't reply. She tried calling a few times, but he didn't pick up.

While she was still trying to reach him, the necklace was sold for 80 million.

The moment the final bid was called, Clara happened to come back.

Clara spotted the necklace and instantly wanted it. When she realized it had been sold, she picked up a glass of red wine and poured it on Elie's face.

""I told you to bid on everything I liked! What the hel were you doing?""

Elie's hair and clothes were soaked. She clenched her hands tightly, trying hard to keep her voice calm.

""This necklace wasn't in the catalog. It was a surprise item. I called Mr. Lawrence, but he didn't answer...""

But Clara didn't care about her explanation. She turned to Eric with a pitiful look.

""Eric, not only is Elie useless, but now she also shirks responsibility! I don't care. I want that necklace. If you don't get it for me, I will ignore you.""

Eric had seen Elie's message and knew it wasn't her fault.

But in front of Clara, he couldn't defend Elie. He could only go along and try to soothe Clara.

""Have I ever said no to something you wanted? Be good, I'll have someone buy it back right now.""

He called over a staff member, his tone stern. ""Find the buyer and negotiate. If they're willing to give it up, meet any condition they ask.""

Elie stood silently, her wet shirt stuck to her body, and wine still dripping from her hair.

Seeing the smug look on Clara's face, she suddenly had a bad feeling.

The staff member came back quickly, looking a bit uneasy. ""Mr. Lawrence, the buyer agreed to hand over the necklace, but...""

""Go on,"" Eric said, frowning.

""He has one condition..."" the staff member said hesitantly. ""He wants your secretary to spend the night with him. He said...""

He braced himself and continued, ""He said she may look plain, but after having nothing but gourmet meals, sometimes it's nice to try something simple.""





\###Chapter 8

Elie was struck as if by lightning, and she looked up suddenly at Clara.

The smug smile at the corner of the other's mouth confirmed her guess, which she couldn't hide in time.

What hidden items, what mysterious buyers, all are carefully designed traps.

""Mr. Lawrence, Elie's voice trembled, ""you can't agree, I'm leaving after today...""

""Eric,"" Clara suddenly threw herself into Eric's arms, interrupting him, ""I want that necklace! You promised me.""

She looked up, tears welling in her eyes, ""Am I not as important to you as a secretary in your heart?""

Eric looked down at Clara in his arms, then glanced at the pale-faced Elie.

He wiped away Clara's tears with his hand and whispered, ""Don't cry.""

Then he turned to the staff and said, ""Tell the buyer, deal done.""

Elie's blood froze in an instant: ""Eric! You can't-""

Before the words had even finished, someone had already grabbed her arm.

She struggled desperately, her nails scratching blood marks on the bodyguard's arm: ""Let me go! Eric! I'm quitting tomorrow! You have no right...""

Her voice was cut off by the slamming of the car door.

The black sedan sped away, and in the rearview mirror, Eric was gently putting a coat on Clara.

In the luxury suite, Elie was pushed in roughly.

With a click, the door locked behind her, and she turned around to see a beggar covered in dirt greedily staring at her.

The beggar grinned, revealing his uneven yellow teeth.

Elie trembled all over, staggering backwards. ""Don't come any closer... I can give you money...""

""Money? The beggar grabbed her wrist, his foul breath hitting her face as he chuckled. ""The money that lady gave me is enough to last me a lifetime! I don't need money now, I need a woman!""

Elie was desperate and could only grab the desk lamp for self-defense. When the beggar pounced on her, she fiercely smashed his head.

Blood flowed down his forehead, instead arousing his ferocity.

""Jerrk! he grabbed her hair and threw her onto the bed.""

The sound of fabric tearing was particularly harsh in the room.

Elie's nails left deep blood marks on the beggar's face, but they were no match for the man's strength.

Just when she was completely desperate—

""Bang!""

The door was kicked open.

Eric's bodyguard rushed in and quickly subdued the beggar.

""Ms. Roberts, the bodyguard holding out a coat began, ""Mr. Lawrence sent us to rescue you.""

Elie shivered as she wrapped her coat tightly around her, reaching for her phone to call the police.

The bodyguard quickly snetched the phone: ""Mr. Lawrence instructed that you cannot call the police.""

""What does it mean? Elie asked hoarsely.""

""Ms. Grayson didn't mean it, she just wanted to vent. Mr. Lawrence has already arranged for someone to save you, you're fine, let's just forget about it.""

Elie was struck as if by lightning: ""He... knew?""

The bodyguard resigned.

Elie suddenly laughed, laughing so hard that tears streamed down his face.

Originally, Eric knew everything, but still allowed Clara to push her towards the abyss.

Her eyes welled up with tears, ""What if I had to call the police?""

""No one in New York dares to take your case, the bodyguard said expressionlessly. ""Mr. Lawrence said to give you a week off, so you can rest well these days, consider it as compensation.""

After speaking, the bodyguard's figure disappeared at the end of the corridor, and the door made a soft ""click"" sound.

Elie sat down slowly on the ground, pressing his fingertips deeply into the palm of his hand.

The suit jacket slipped off her shoulders, revealing a torrn collar. She reached out to pick it up, only to find her hand shaking uncontrollably.

The phone suddenly rang, and the word ""Mom"" on the screen stabbed her eyes.

""Elie, have you finished the handover? Have you arranged all the blind dates?""

Elie bit down hard on his lower lip, the taste of rust spreading in his mouth, but it was nothing compared to the pain in his heart.

""Okay, Mom, she heard her own terrifyingly calm voice, ""I'll go back today.""

The moment the phone hung up, tears finally burst out.

Ten years of time passed by like a revolving lantern in front of my eyes.

On the college campus, the figure of a young man walking against the light.

In the president's office, his breath was scorching hot after he got drunk.

And tonight, he uttered the indifferent words ""deal"" as well.

Every frame of memory turned into a sharp knife, tearing her heart apart.

Ten years of infatuation, resulted in one trampling after another.

Elie slowly stood up, picked up the coat on the ground, straightened out his disheveled clothes, and returned to the apartment alone.

Her emotions had completely calmed down. Within just thirty minutes, she calmly cancelled the apartment rental, packed all her belongings, left the keys behind, and took a taxi with her suitcase.

The taxi drove through the puddles and headed towards the airport.

There was a one-way ticket leading to a life without Eric.",0,1753267633.0,romancenovels,0,0.5,False

Okay, okay, let’s get real for a second. We all know life can sometimes feel like a never-ending grind, right? The truth is, some people seem to breeze through challenges while we’re over here looking for the nearest coffee shop to recharge after every tiny setback. But here’s the kicker—what if I told you that the difference often comes down to a simple habit that gives them that “unfair advantage”? 🎯

So, what’s yours? Let’s dive into this together!

**Here’s a few habits that I’ve found to be game-changers:**

- **Morning Rituals**: Ever notice how some people wake up like they just drank a gallon of positivity? For me, it’s a quick meditation followed by writing down three things I’m grateful for. It sets a vibe for the day, and suddenly that project deadline doesn’t seem so daunting.

- **Power Naps**: It’s like a cheat code for productivity. Seriously, a quick 20-minute nap can recharge your brain better than any energy drink I’ve tried. Why fight that post-lunch slump when you can just reset?

- **Learning in Bit-Size Chunks**: Instead of cramming information, I’ve turned learning into a little 15-minute daily challenge. TED Talks, podcasts, you name it. This keeps my brain fresh without overwhelming it. Plus, it feels less like a chore and more like a treasure hunt for knowledge. ✨

- **Scheduling “No” Days**: Sounds paradoxical, right? But taking a day off social commitments lets me refill my creative basket. It’s amazing how many “new” ideas come when you give yourself space to breathe. Can you relate?

- **Accountability Buddies**: Find someone to share your goals with—this isn’t just for workouts! Sharing that goal of finishing a book or diving into a side hustle can give you the little push you need. Plus, who doesn’t love appraising each other’s progress like you’re on a mini game show? 🎉

Here’s the glaring truth: **We all have something that gives us that extra boost** – that secret sauce that makes things flow in our favor. But what are the ones that work for *you*? 

So many folks out there have their quirky little “unfair advantage” habits, from the strategic use of sticky notes to visualizing success like it's their morning coffee. How do you find your groove in the chaos? 

Let’s spill the beans! What’s one habit that lifts you up and propels you forward? The floor is yours! 🍵",1,1753267630.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

She got into a college and our original plan was to visit her college and then go to a mall but it started raining so we skipped visiting her college and just went to the mall. 

At the mall, we visited a few stores and then I suggested that we try the Tokyo themed cafe since we both like anime. However, we didn’t check the prices and it was a tad pricey so we just ordered veg ramen (It was Tuesday and we can’t eat non-veg on Tuesday) and a coffee. She liked neither, said the coffee was too bitter (she prefers her coffee sweet and the cafe didn’t give us any sugar packets) and the ramen was bad, so I had to finish our meal and she was also on her phone the entire time but I didn’t say anything. 

At the mall, we wanted to visit a market nearby as it’s trendy on Instagram so we did. I don’t think she liked that as well. While we were leaving the market, she said that she wants to visit CP but I didn’t because I don’t like that place and I was already very tired. It was also 5pm at the time so we would arrive home late and her family doesn’t like it when she’s out late, (She doesn’t like being out late as well) so I said that we’ll go next time. She said that she won’t have the time since her college is starting and her course is tough. I argued that I have to go to college as well to do a tough course as well but I still find the time to have fun and I also told her to find a balance. She said that she can’t afford to find a balance because she has a single-mom who is a sole earner. I understand her problems but I know that her mom won’t mind if she had fun for a few days so I told her that. She just said that she’ll have fun on college fests which come once a year and I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to escalate the situation but she just went silent after that and I felt bad about the situation and because she didn’t like the food and the market. 

CP comes in between our route to home so I asked her multiple times if she still wants to go there but she didn’t say anything and I didn’t push her to answer because I felt really tired and was starting to feel sick and I just wanted to go home, but when I asked her one last time when we were at Rajiv Chowk, she said we can go if the sun is still up. The doors of the metro were open and I said yes because they were about to close and it felt as if I was put on the spot.

At CP, it finally felt as if she was enjoying herself since she bought the stuff she wanted but my condition was getting worse. I was going through my pre-menstrual week yesterday and I finally got my period today(my pre-menstrual week is worse than my menstrual week) but yesterday, I was struggling with cramps, back pain and leg pain since we walked a lot and also, it was very humid and crowded so it felt like I was going to throw up. I already told her about it earlier but I tried to put on a brave face since she was finally having fun but it got harder by the minute. 

I thought that she enjoyed the day but today she posted a story on her Instagram stating that she’s better staying at home than going out. I felt bad because I thought she had fun and when I asked her about it, she said that the Ramen ruined it. The ramen wasn’t great but I don’t think it can ruin anybody’s experience that much. I just wanted her to have fun but I think that I am responsible for the story but I am not sure how. AITK? ",4,1753267572.0,AmItheKameena,5,1.0,False

I've put together a collection of amazing spice cake recipes that'll make your kitchen smell incredible and your taste buds dance. Here are some highlights from my favorite recipes:

#1 Sweet Potato Cake
This might sound unusual, but trust me - sweet potato creates an incredibly moist, tender cake with natural sweetness and a beautiful orange hue. The natural sugars caramelize during baking, creating complex flavor notes that pair perfectly with warm spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.

#2 Carrot Cake Cupcakes
These handheld bites of joy are perfect when you're craving carrot cake but want something more portable. Packed with freshly grated carrots, warm spices, and topped with classic cream cheese frosting, they're ideal for sharing (or not - we won't judge).

#3 Vegan Carrot Cake
Yes, you can have your carrot cake and eat it too - even if you're plant-based! This version doesn't compromise on taste or texture, using clever substitutions that result in a perfectly moist, flavorful cake that everyone will love.

#4 Applesauce Cake
Using applesauce in this recipe not only adds moisture but also reduces the need for excess oil. The result? A lighter cake that still maintains that classic spice cake character you're looking for.

#5 Pumpkin Chiffon Cake
Light as air but rich in flavor, this pumpkin chiffon cake is a beautiful marriage of delicate texture and bold autumn spices. The secret is in the technique, which creates an incredibly fluffy crumb.

#6 Pumpkin Chai Coffee Cake
When pumpkin meets chai spices, magic happens. This coffee cake features a tender crumb and a spiced streusel topping that'll make your morning coffee break feel extra special.

#7 Cardamom Lemon Cake
This isn't your typical spice cake - the bright citrus notes of lemon perfectly complement the unique, aromatic cardamom. It's sophisticated yet simple, and absolutely unforgettable.

#8 Apple Crumb Cake
Think of this as the perfect breakfast cake (because breakfast cakes are totally a thing). Fresh apples, warm spices, and a generous buttery crumb topping make this an irresistible treat any time of day.

These are just a taste of what's in store! I've actually compiled a full list of 29 amazing spice cake recipes, complete with detailed instructions, ingredient lists, and helpful baking tips. You can find them all at https://bakerepeat.com/spice-cake-recipes/. Whether you're an experienced baker or just getting started, there's something there for everyone.

Each recipe has been tested and perfected, so you can bake with confidence. From classic combinations to unique twists, these recipes will keep your kitchen warm and your family happy all year round. Happy baking!",1,1753267313.0,BakeEat,0,1.0,False

I (F, 28) was in a long-distance relationship for 3 years. It was full of fights and on-and-off breaks. 2.5 months ago, he (M, 25) broke up with me — it was mostly my fault, and I begged him to come back, but he refused. So I started healing and decided to try dating again.

I reconnected with a guy (let’s call him A) I briefly dated during one of our past breaks. We only went on two dates and didn’t kiss or sleep together. Last year, I cut him off when I got back with my ex. This time, we grabbed coffee and dinner, just once.

But my ex found out and went ballistic. He pressured me to block A and accused me of “cheating” last year — even though we were on a break and I hadn’t done anything physical. He made me choose between him or A, even though we weren’t back together. At first I picked A, but 30 minutes later I realized I still loved my ex and called him. We had a great 2-hour talk.
Then I found out my ex had texted A — in a super disrespectful way about me. That was the breaking point, and I told him I didn’t want to get back together. But then he started begging me to try again.

Here’s the kicker: he’s been seeing a girl from a dating app for 1.5 months and has slept with her several times. He says they’re incompatible and he’ll end it soon, but wants me to not date anyone and wait for him.

Meanwhile, I’ve never slept with anyone but him. I feel hurt, manipulated, and confused — but I still love him. I don’t know what to do.
Has anyone dealt with something like this? Can trust or love even survive this kind of mess? Or is he just controlling and I need to walk away?

1m75r4f,https://i.redd.it/vk88ntprqlef1.jpeg,How do you think it took?,"In S4E: Shotgun, Mike tells Walter “Jesse is with me today, BUT NOT AS THE GUY THO. I HAD A GUY NOW I DONT. HE. IS NOT. THE GUY 😳”

And in the following montage feat. Maik and Jessy we see Wultuh doing the cook all by his lonesome and the close up camera angles and intense breathing puts you in Wolt’s perspective over how difficult and out of breath bro is and how much more beneficial it would be to have a younger, more physically capable bod like Jesse’s to lift the heavier chemical containers into the big metal tubs. 

Later in the episode he lashes out to the camera in the lab when he fails to operate a forklift (aw naah bro ain’t forklift certified?😭🙏🏽🥀🥀), and unless I grievessly misremember— Hartwell doesn’t know fs here that Guz also bugged the place so it’s real funny to me to think of bro so upset so as to let it all out in Guss’s spiritual direction regardless of if he could actually hear him or not.

This got me noggin’ a-thinkin’, tho: How long does it actually take for the two of them (Mr. Jackson & Mr. Hwhite) two make a batch in Guz’s lab? It’s clear that on his own a cook with just Wult was virtually impossible but if he did take a few courses in forklifting at 10x speed so he finishes in just 20 minutes I’m sure a Wolt solo cook would take at least less than 24hrs, with the two of them..? how long would one “batch” take them? I know they’ve made plenty of batches throughout the show in the lab but I could never quite nail down a concrete time frame, the narrative always goes in and out of them cooking and other stuff happening and then back to them taking their suits off and leaving the lab.

I’m counting one “batch” as the moment the first button or switch is manipulated when one of them starts the day (if they don’t arrive at the same time to work) to when the max available space for the cooling trays is filled up and they crack the glass of all of those even if there is excess product being put into the now available once again trays. 

In my professional opinion (psychology student, basically a professor already just give me a few more years) is roughly 6 hours. My field is not chemistry but I think 6 hours is being generous. If Welter explained the time frames of “having to let the hydrogen peroxide calibrate for 2 hours then we add the flouride” and so on it would’ve been at the very beginning of the show (it’s been a while since I last seen it I think I saw Better Call Saul twice all the way through first and I put this on but from the start of S3 two weeks ago) so it would’ve been in the RV, so how would that compare to an industrial grade, German+Gus+Gale manufactured lab with bigger, more sophisticated equipment? 

And I mean like, on a normal ass day too— on the median day in the life of cooking meth for Gluckgluckstavo, where both Weltah and Jezzy probably had a cup of coffee before their shifts give or take, a decent night’s sleep, Jess-E is clean off the meth but not going through severe withdrawls bro is just.. in a neutral state. No buffs no nerfs no braps no interruptions minus the occasional Walt yelling at Mr. Jackson for not hearing what he said cuz he has his headphones in—how long does one cook take?

TL;DR on a normal ass day with both of them in a good headspace locked in to the cook but not rushing either, how long does one batch of crystal take in Gus’s lab?

1m75quj,https://i.redd.it/swayp31pqlef1.png,✈️ Living abroad? Here’s a simple way to treat someone back home,"If you’re Irish and living abroad, you’ll know this feeling:

You want to do something small but thoughtful for someone back home — maybe a parent, a mate, someone having a rough week — but it’s tricky. You’re not going to send flowers for €60, and Revolut isn’t exactly meaningful.

That’s what Brontie is for.

It lets you send someone in Ireland a real coffee, cake or combo — instantly, via a link. No app. No logins. Just a warm message and a QR code they scan at the café counter.

Right now we’re live in cafés in Maynooth & Leixlip while we test — and we’re building slowly, with feedback from here on Reddit and word-of-mouth.

If you're abroad, would something like this make staying connected feel a little easier?

Also curious: What do you usually do to send love home from overseas?

I started Brontie to make kind, thoughtful gifting feel instant, simple, and human.

It’s inspired by something I experienced while living in South Korea, where people could send a coffee or small treat to a friend through a sharable link — no app, no login, just a little gesture that brightened someone’s day.

Now I’m building the same idea here in Ireland — with Brontie.

> The name Brontie comes from the Irish word bronntanas — meaning to gift or to bestow.
It’s a small nod to the emotional and cultural heart of what this is about.



You can send someone a redeemable coffee, cake, or both, instantly via a link. The person scans a wooden QR plaque at a local café, and that’s it. Real café, real treat, no app required.

We’re now live in a few cafés in Maynooth and Leixlip, and this community is here for a few reasons:

To share updates as we grow

To get honest feedback from real people

To spotlight Irish cafés & gifting stories

And hopefully to connect with anyone who believes in small acts of kindness 💛


Feel free to post your ideas, questions, or wishlist of cafés you’d love to see us in next.
This is still a work in progress — and I’m building it in public, mistakes and all.

Thanks for being here. You’re part of the journey now.
