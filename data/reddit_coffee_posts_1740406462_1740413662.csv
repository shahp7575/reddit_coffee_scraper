I’ve been riding the Lobster Sender for the past two seasons and have been happy with it overall. However, I’ve noticed it struggles a bit with edge hold in more gnarly and icy conditions, and it seems a slightly too stiff for my liking. 

I’ve had my eye on the Bataleon Beyond Metals board for a few weeks and recently spotted it on sale at a local shop - and I’m on the fence about swapping it for my Lobster Sender. From what I’ve read, it’s generally well-liked—being called a “Swiss army knife with good pop.” I’m especially curious if it might offer better edge hold in tougher conditions without feeling stiffer than my current setup. I also love the shape and the minimal graphic. 

For a bit of context: I’m a 40-year-old rider who’s been on a board off and on since my teen years. I’d say I’m somewhere between intermediary and advanced (although that can definitely vary depending on how much coffee is in my system). While I don’t spend much time in the park anymore (aside from a small, medium jump line), I do love hitting side hits, charging groomers, and, on those rare occasions, carving up some pow.

I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences, especially if you’ve made a similar switch or have insights on the Beyond Metals versus the Sender. Thanks in advance!",1,1740413577.0,snowboarding,0,1.0,False

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I'm curious about one particular thing. I'm going to an out of state training event for a job I was hired for less than a week ago. The company will be covering the hotel cost and tolls. I found out through a friend who works there already that I'd be sharing a hotel room with another staff member.  I was interviewed and hired through zoom, so I've never met anyone on the team in person. Is there a standard I should be following? I've never worked a corporate professional job before and everything about this is so new to me. I'm a little nervous about sharing a room with someone I don't know. I'm a lot socially anxious and awkward but I'm trying to push myself through so I can have a ""big girl job"".

After this, the taste starts to degrade, and it may not be as enjoyable.**

Coffee lovers often wonder about keeping their brew fresh. Knowing how long brewed coffee lasts can save you from wasted cups. Storing coffee in the fridge can extend its life, but only for a few days. Beyond this period, the flavor changes, and it may even develop an off-taste.

Understanding the best ways to store your coffee ensures you enjoy every sip. In this post, we’ll explore the shelf life of brewed coffee in the fridge, why it changes over time, and tips to maximize its freshness. Stay tuned to keep your coffee tasting great for as long as possible!

# Brewed Coffee Lifespan

How long does brewed coffee last in the fridge? This is a common question for coffee lovers who want to enjoy their favorite drink later. Brewed coffee can last in the fridge, but its lifespan depends on various factors. Understanding these factors and the [different types of brewed coffee ](https://gomehedi.com/best-coffee-on-amazon/)can help you know how long you can store your coffee and still enjoy its taste.

# Factors Affecting Freshness

Several factors affect the freshness of brewed coffee in the fridge. Knowing these factors can help you keep your coffee fresh for a longer time.

**1. Temperature:** The temperature of your fridge plays a crucial role. Coffee stored at a consistent, cool temperature will last longer. Ideally, keep your fridge between 34°F and 40°F (1°C to 4°C).

**2. Container:** The type of container you use is essential. Store your coffee in an airtight container to prevent exposure to air. Glass or stainless steel containers are the best choices. Avoid using plastic containers as they can affect the flavor.

**3. Exposure to Light:** Light can degrade the quality of coffee. Store your coffee in a dark container or a part of the fridge that does not receive much light.

**4. Coffee Additives:** If you add milk, cream, or sugar, the coffee will spoil faster. Plain black coffee lasts longer.

|Factor|Effect on Freshness|
|:-|:-|
|Temperature|Cool temperature extends freshness.|
|Container|Airtight, glass, or stainless steel containers are best.|
|Light Exposure|Less light exposure keeps coffee fresh longer.|
|Additives|Additives like milk and sugar reduce lifespan.|

# Types Of Brewed Coffee

[Different types of brewed coffee have varying lifespans in the fridge](https://gomehedi.com/best-beginner-espresso-machine/). Here are some common types and their expected storage times:

**1. Black Coffee:** Plain black coffee can last up to a week in the fridge. Ensure it is stored in an airtight container to maintain its freshness.

**2. Coffee with Milk or Cream:** Coffee with milk or cream has a shorter lifespan. It is best to consume it within 2 to 3 days to avoid spoilage.

**3. Cold Brew Coffee:** Cold brew coffee can last longer than regular brewed coffee. You can store cold brew for up to two weeks in the fridge. Cold brew is less acidic, which helps it stay fresh longer.

**4. Flavored Coffee:** Flavored coffee often contains syrups and other additives. These can reduce its lifespan. Consume flavored coffee within 2 to 3 days for the best taste.

|Type of Coffee|Storage Time|
|:-|:-|
|Black Coffee|Up to 1 week|
|Coffee with Milk or Cream|2 to 3 days|
|Cold Brew Coffee|Up to 2 weeks|
|Flavored Coffee|2 to 3 days|

# Storage Methods

Brewed coffee is a delight, but knowing how long it lasts in the fridge is crucial. Proper storage methods ensure you enjoy your coffee at its best. Let’s explore the best ways to store brewed coffee and how different factors can affect its freshness.

# Containers For Storage

Choosing the right container is essential for keeping your brewed coffee fresh. **Airtight containers** are the best option. They prevent air from getting in, which can cause your coffee to go stale.

Here are some suitable containers:

* **Glass Jars**: Great for short-term storage. Ensure they have a tight lid.
* **Stainless Steel Containers**: These are durable and keep light out, which helps preserve flavor.
* **Plastic Containers**: Use only food-grade plastic. Ensure they are BPA-free.

Avoid using containers that are not airtight. They let in moisture and air, which can spoil your coffee faster.

Here is a quick comparison of different containers:

|Container Type|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Glass Jars|Non-reactive, clear visibility|Breakable, not always airtight|
|Stainless Steel|Durable, blocks light|Can be expensive|
|Plastic|Lightweight, affordable|May retain odors, less durable|

# Temperature Considerations

The temperature of your fridge plays a significant role in how long your brewed coffee lasts. **Ideally, brewed coffee should be stored at or below 40°F (4°C)**. This temperature slows down the growth of bacteria and mold.

Here are a few tips for maintaining the right temperature:

* Set your fridge to the correct temperature. Use a thermometer to check if unsure.
* Store coffee in the middle shelf of the fridge. This area maintains a consistent temperature.
* Avoid placing coffee near the fridge door. The temperature fluctuates more in this area.

Cold temperatures help maintain the flavor and freshness of your brewed coffee. If stored properly, brewed coffee can last up to 3-4 days in the fridge. After this period, it may develop a sour taste.

Remember, **improper storage** can lead to faster spoilage. Always check the temperature settings and ensure your coffee is stored in the best possible conditions.

1ix5ouu,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ix5ouu/entire_world_is_extremely_biased_on_caffeine/,Entire world is extremely biased on caffeine consumption,"Just some observations which I noticed from being in this space for few years.

I tried to quit caffeine several times in my life, and I was caffeine free few times for 3-4 months. Due to weak moments, I would eventually each time go back to drinking coffee, but as a caffeine user, I would always have it in back of my head I would be way better off without consuming caffeine. For me, it's more like cigarettes. I know it's not good for me, but right now I enjoy it and I don't want to stop. If I only knew back then that 2nd to 4th month of quitting is hardest. After that it gets better, and you get your natural energy back.  
  
But what I noticed that most of people think caffeine is some superior supstance that is good for them. After browsing youtube searching for experience of people who quit coffee, most of them are coping hard, coming back to drinking coffee after only 30 days, or coming back to it after abstinence and now driniking every other day (cope imo - that's like smoking cigarettes every other day). And most of them are being incredibly biased about coffee just because they have been drinking it for so long. 

Even doctors won't tell you truth about caffeine. Most doctors are caffeine addicts, so they are OFC biased as hell. They will tell you good things from studies, but skip bad ones.

1ix5h24,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetOutOfBed/comments/1ix5h24/hello_its_me_3_am/,"Hello, It's me, 3 AM","I have always been a morning person.

When I was in grade school, I would wake up on weekends around 6 AM so I could watch the Disney channel through our satellite TV. I would make myself a bowl of cereal, turn the tv on and watch until my parents woke up. I would always beat them.

In middle school, when my mom would come into my room to wake me up for school, I would already be awake before she had the chance to wake me.

In high school, by the time I was able to drive, when my parents were fighting with my brother to wake up, I was already headed out the door to pick my friends up and head to the 7 AM morning classes.

By the time college hit, I was working and going to school full-time. I worked at a grocery store then and my shift would either start at 3 AM or 4 AM. After work ended at 12 PM or 1 PM I would head to my first class at college.

Even when I had my worst hangovers and would be up all night drinking and partying until 3 AM I would always be the first to wake up amongst my friends.

And now, today-these days are no different. I intentionally decide to wake up at 3 AM on weekdays and ""sleep-in"" on weekends, which really just means that I sleep until 5:30 AM/6 AM.

What is it with me and the mornings?

It's not as if I am chasing the sunrise looking for the beauty that mother nature blesses us with. It's not that I have insomnia. It's not I am anxious and have ruminating thoughts of running to-do lists that are so attractive that it pulls me out of bed.

I believe my attraction to waking up early is because it is the only time that I get to myself. I get to prioritize myself. I get to think about myself. I get to hear the quiet of the house while drinking my coffee and I get to do this while not being interrupted. It's the only time during my day that is mine and it is FABULOUS.

I realize that waking up at 3 AM is rather extreme but I work at a job that has meetings that start at 6 AM and if I am planning on getting enough ""me"" time to fill my cup then I need to stick to the 3 AM.

I also realize that I am very privileged to have this time to myself. I don't have anyone in my household that relies on me for survival, other than my plants and they don't care what time I wake up. Not everyone will be able to do the 3 AM wake up and that is totally ok, probably normal even.

So, what do I do in the mornings? How do I spend this time? The first thing I do is 108 Korean Buddhist bows ( I am neither Korean nor Buddhist) and stretching followed by a 10 minute meditation. After, I jump into the shower (10 min of hot water and 5 min of cold -ICE COLD water). Get dressed. Walk to the living room where the coffee is already made and waiting for me. I drink my coffee while reading the news and catching up on the ""outside"" world. When I have caught up on the news, I grab my second cup of coffee and head to my computer to do some personal learnings that I have lined up and I am excited to complete. By 6 AM or 7 AM (depending on the day) I start my day job and get into other business.

Could I do all of this at the end of my day? YES-of course. But from my experience anytime I wait to do something until after my workday, it never gets done. I also LOVE that I put myself first every day. It reminds me of when I get on the airplane and the flight attendant explains to us that we need to put our ""oxygen mask on first before we help others"", this is how I look at my morning time. I am ensuring that my cup is full and that I am fully prepared to go into the day fulfilled and intentional.

I am not suggesting that you wake up at 3 AM. Everyone's life is very different. But what I would suggest is that you intentionally carve out time in your morning for yourself. For you to fill your cup, focus on what your needs and wants are, find time with no distractions and really start leaning in to discovering who you are - in the quiet without all the noise of life and the day.

The best way that I have found for you to do this: An example, you currently have an alarm that is scheduled to go off at 6:30 AM, try to set your alarm 15 min earlier-and you have reclaimed 15 min of your day. You can keep setting the time 15 min earlier each week or month, whatever cadence you decide for you.  You may also want to try setting your alarm on the other side of the room to ensure you need to get out of bed.  

These are the easy tactile things.  The more complicated ones are really understanding your motivation for wanting to reclaim some of your time back.  Understanding the ""why"" you want to wake up earlier will be what will be the difference of you waking up once or twice vs making it a habit.  Understanding that you will be uncomfortable with waking up early and that you will survive.  Creating a plan of how you want to spend your time will excite you to get out of bed-Make it exciting for you-something that motivates you to get out of your comfort zone.

3 AM is the best time for me to meet truest self. Is it hard to wake up-YES. Do I crave more sleep-of course, but I am also someone who knows myself well enough that if I give myself an excuse to sleep in one day-I will use that excuse the next day and the next day.

Waking up at 3 AM allows me to fulfill my commitments to myself and that makes me feel very proud of myself.

I encourage you to open yourself up and find what time is best for you to meet the real you.

1ix5fgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emmachamberlain/comments/1ix5fgs/emma_knows_nothing_about_fashion/,Emma knows nothing about fashion,"Unpopular opinion, and I swear I’m not being a hater, but I think that Emma’s attempt to brand herself a lover of “real fashion”, i.e. runways, fashion houses, fashion history, etc., doesn’t work because she doesn’t actually know anything about fashion.

Don’t get me wrong, she’s had some cool fashion moments - most notably, her editorial-style Chamberlain Coffee marketing shoots - but I was listening to her most recent “trendy vs timeless” podcast and for every single item or style that she mentioned, she said practically nothing of substance.

It’s always, “I saw this item I liked once and then last summer I bought it and now I think it’s timeless” or some random anecdote, but she never actually delves into the history behind the item, or the current trend/discourse surrounding the item online, or gives any concrete examples.

I usually quite like her “trendy vs timeless” episodes but this one, where she was focusing on this season’s runways in particular, felt so wishy-washy and pointless to me, which was disappointing.

For fur coats, she mentioned nothing about the faux vs vintage debate; for patterns, she mentioned nothing about polka dots already being trendy; for lace, she mentioned nothing about the boho chic revival; for the flip flops, nothing about Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, etc.

I understand that her podcast is just her chatting about her own views and likes/dislikes, but in this one, when she was trying to put on her “fashion lover” hat and delve “deeper” into current high fashion, I was expecting some actual interesting points. But there was nothing.

I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised though; at the end of the day, she’s a YouTuber and not a fashion model/designer, so she doesn’t know about fashion. She was thrust into fashion stuff because she became an influencer. Plus, her recent changes to her own wardrobe reflect her lack of fashionability, in my personal opinion - I find her recent style kind of boring and unflattering.

All this to say, I think she should steer away from trying to be a “fashion influencer” and focus more on what she’s actually good at, which is making YouTube videos.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

My husband is depressed. He has been ever since our son was born. I experienced a bout of extreme depression too, but for 4 weeks now I’ve been feeling much better. 

The background — I’ve always (vocally) wanted kids, he was open to them. Together 8 years. He agreed to have kids & be a SAHD as I don’t want to send a kid to daycare and my salary is the only one we’re able to sustain a family on; he’s OK with this as he doesn’t like working. He used to be high 24/7 but we got to a good place where he’s only smoking weed after work. Started trying for a baby at my suggestion, it took us 6 months of trying, we finally conceive a son. At my behest, he quits smoking weed entirely when I got pregnant. 

We welcomed our son home on Christmas. He was on his phone scrolling for most of the delivery and only “came to” when the doc said I needed an emergency c section. Our son needed to spend a day in the NICU. I was then readmitted 8 days later with postpartum preeclampsia; our son stayed with my parents & he was “supporting” me (in the hospital, but again on his phone scrolling bluesky 24/7; I needed to ask him to come over and hold my hand, reassure me, do some light cleaning around the room, etc.). 

I have 16 weeks parental leave. He quit a job he hated in December to be a SAHD. I was hit HARD by PPA (cried constantly, felt like a shell of a human) but I still was contributing 50/50 and got help, and am now enjoying being a parent. 

The situation — we’re 9 weeks in. Our daily routine is: he goes to bed at 1 AM. I wake for the 3:00 feed, he takes the 5:00 feed, I wake up at 7:30 & hang solo with our kid. He wakes up at 10:30ish and scrolls for about an hour. I give him the baby after 11:30 to pump, then we hang out together (he holds our son & scrolls, I do chores) until around 2 or 3. Then we go for a walk together, then I take the baby to my parents house to give husband solo time. Husband comes over at 6 & we all have dinner together. We head home & I go to bed at ~8; he looks after baby until 1 AM. 

Occasionally we’ll break routine for me to take the baby out & grocery shop, go to a coffee shop, etc. , for therapy (we both have therapists), or he’ll go practice with his band from 6-11:30P, and a few times my parents have babysat so we can go on a date && have sex, but even during sex I find he’s disengaged. 

The past week or so, he’s back to smoking weed occasionally (3-4x/wk) when I’m at my parents. 

Today — I told him I’ve finally been enjoying being a parent these past few weeks. He said he hasn’t. That he loves our son, but he’s just going through the motions when he’s with him; our son really has never brought him any joy. He went on to say that he’ll be almost 50 by the time he gets to be a human again, or later if we have another, and that he’s coming to terms with the fact that his life is over. He said that he’s putting on a fake happy face for our son’s sake, but our son is basically a potato at this point (he’s not, he’s starting to coo/“talk” and smile, but that’s not enough ig) and he doesn’t enjoy “pretending” to engage ; moreover, having dinner with and being around my parents stresses him out (my dad has different political opinions). 

Outwardly I reassured him that it’s normal, it will get better, I’m so proud of him, but truthfully — I’m crushed. Our whole relationship he’s been unhappy with his lot (it’s always “it’ll get better, babe! Once you start a masters program!” Then “once you finish your masters program!” Then “once you get a job!” Then “once you quit this job & get a new one!” (Repeat 3x) and most recently “once you quit & become a stay at home dad!”), so “it gets better” is starting to get old. 

I want to emphasize that he’s a wonderful dad, he just doesn’t like it & doesn’t see any light at the end of the tunnel and that destroys me. I want to be a happy family. I want him to be happy. 

Idk. I wanted to vent and ask for anything — understanding, advice, hope, something. Thank you so much for reading. ",1,1740412615.0,newborns,2,1.0,False

This in-depth comparison breaks down everything you‍ need to no to make the ⁢best choice.‌ We will explore the rumors surrounding the AirPods 4 release date, compare features, dissect‌ specifications, and ultimately,⁤ help you decide: should I buy AirPods 4 or AirPods Pro 2?

## Introduction: Navigating the airpod Landscape

Apple’s AirPods have⁣ redefined how we listen on the go. From the​ original AirPods to the premium AirPods Pro, each iteration brings⁢ something new.The AirPods Pro 2 have set a high bar with their superior noise cancellation, ‌enhanced audio quality, and⁣ a host of smart features. however,the anticipated AirPods⁢ 4⁣ promises to bridge the‌ gap between the⁣ standard AirPods​ and the Pro lineup. This comparison will‍ help you navigate the landscape with clarity and confidence, ‌whether you’re after‍ the‍ best AirPods​ 2024 has to offer or simply exploring the possibilities.

## Design and Comfort: A⁣ Tale of two Fits

Comfort and⁤ design ​are paramount when choosing earbuds, especially for extended listening sessions. Let’s delve into how the AirPods 4 and‍ AirPods Pro 2 stack up.

###‍ AirPods 4: ​A⁣ Fresh Take ‌on Familiarity?

Rumors suggest ⁤that the AirPods 4 will feature a⁤ redesigned stem, potentially shorter and more⁣ contoured for improved ergonomics. Speculation also points towards interchangeable ear tips, a first for ‍the standard AirPods line.This would⁢ significantly enhance comfort and ​provide a better seal ⁢for ⁣improved ⁢sound isolation, though the level of isolation might not reach the capabilities of active noise cancellation. Many are curious ⁣about the airpods 4 comfort relative to the pro model.

### AirPods Pro 2: The Gold Standard in Ergonomics

The AirPods Pro 2 boast a sleek, in-ear ‌design ​with four⁤ sizes of silicone ear tips (XS, S, M, L) to ensure‍ a ⁢snug⁢ and pleasant fit for a wide ​range of ear shapes.Their lightweight construction​ makes them ideal for all-day wear, whether⁢ you're commuting, working out, or simply relaxing.The inclusion of ​an ear tip fit test further ensures ⁣optimal comfort and seal, maximizing audio quality and noise ‍cancellation. How the AirPods 4 fair against this standard will be key ⁢to it's ‍success.

### Which wins on Comfort?

While speculation‌ surrounds‍ the AirPods 4's potential improvements to comfort, the⁣ AirPods ⁢Pro 2 currently hold the edge due to their proven ergonomic design, multiple ear tip options, and the ear tip fit test. If the rumors about the AirPods 4⁣ materialize, the competition will become much ⁤closer, addressing a ​long held‍ issue with the standard line of⁤ airpods.[[Explore Top Rated airpod 4 vs airpod pro 2 on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/airpods-pro/?kw=airpod 4 vs airpod pro 2)
## Sound Quality: Immersive ⁢Audio vs. Balanced Performance

The core⁣ of any earbud experience lies in its sound quality. Let's analyse what the AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 bring to‌ the table.

### AirPods 4 ​Sound Quality Expectations

While details remain scarce, expectations ​are that the‌ AirPods 4 will receive a significant audio upgrade over their predecessors. Improved drivers‍ and enhanced processing​ should ⁢deliver clearer, more detailed sound with a broader ​soundstage. The addition of adaptive ⁣EQ,​ a feature previously exclusive to the Pro models, may be included to ‍tailor the audio to the‌ user's unique ear anatomy. Though, we can⁣ expect them to remain a 'step down' ‍to the premium‍ AirPods Pro 2 sound quality.

### AirPods Pro 2: Audio prowess Unmatched

The AirPods Pro 2 raise the bar for wireless audio fidelity. Apple's H2 chip powers custom ⁤high-excursion drivers and amplifiers, resulting ⁢in rich, detailed sound with deep bass, crisp highs, ⁤and extraordinary clarity. Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking creates an immersive listening experience, placing sound all around you with remarkable precision. ‍Many regard the AirPods Pro 2 as class-leading for portable audio.

### The Verdict on Audio

The‍ AirPods pro⁣ 2 undoubtedly lead in sound quality. Their ⁣advanced audio architecture and Spatial Audio capabilities offer⁣ a superior listening experience. While the AirPods 4 might offer an improved audio ‌experience compared to previous generations, it's unlikely to match the Pro 2's performance.

[[Explore Top Rated airpod 4 vs airpod pro 2 on amazon.]](https://storeins.com/airpods-pro/?kw=airpod 4 vs airpod pro 2)
## Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): Silence the World Around You

Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is a game-changer for anyone who wants to block out distractions and immerse ​themselves in their music.

### AirPods 4 Noise Cancellation: A Possible Inclusion?

One ‍of the biggest unknowns surrounding the ‍AirPods 4 is the presence of active noise cancellation. Some rumors ‍suggest that Apple might offer‍ two versions of ⁤the AirPods 4: one with ANC and one without. If ANC is included, ‌it's ‌likely to be a less powerful version than what's found in‍ the​ AirPods Pro 2. Information on airpods 4 anc will be crucial for⁤ those that travel frequently.

### airpods Pro 2 ANC: Industry-Leading Performance

The ⁤AirPods Pro ⁣2 boast industry-leading active noise cancellation. Their advanced H2 ⁢chip and sophisticated algorithms effectively silence a wide range of ambient noises, from the rumble of an⁣ airplane engine to⁤ the chatter of a busy coffee shop. Adaptive Transparency mode intelligently adjusts the level of ‌noise cancellation to allow essential sounds, like conversations or traffic, ⁣to pass through. The AirPods Pro 2 anc is a‌ major selling point.

###⁣ ANC Showdown

The AirPods ⁤Pro 2 decisively ⁤win the ANC​ battle. Their superior noise ​cancellation capabilities provide a more immersive and distraction-free listening experience. If the AirPods 4 offer ANC, it⁣ will be ⁤a‍ welcome addition, but likely not on par with⁤ the Pro 2's level of performance.

[[Explore Top Rated airpod 4 vs airpod pro 2 on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/airpods-pro/?kw=airpod 4 vs airpod pro 2)
## Battery Life: Powering Your Day

Battery life is⁣ a critical factor for on-the-go listening. Let's see how​ the AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 compare.### AirPods 4 Battery Life expectations

Apple typically aims for improvements in battery ​life with each new generation of ‌AirPods. ​The AirPods 4 are​ projected to offer upwards of 6 hours of listening time on a single charge, with the⁤ charging ​case providing⁣ an additional 24 hours. Many users ‌are hoping ​for significant improvements‍ to stand in the airpods 4 battery life.

### ‍AirPods Pro 2 Battery Life:⁣ Solid Performance

the AirPods Pro 2 deliver respectable battery life, offering up to 6 ⁢hours of listening time with ANC enabled, and‌ up to 30 hours with the charging case.### Battery ‌Life Comparison

Based on projected⁤ figures, the ​battery life between the Airpods 4 and Airpods Pro 2 very similar. With‌ similar battery‌ performance, users in this⁣ case would likely not weight battery life very high in a purchase decision.

[[Explore top Rated airpod 4 vs airpod pro 2 on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/airpods-pro/?kw=airpod 4 vs airpod pro 2)
## Features and Functionality: Smart Technology at⁣ Your Fingertips

Beyond sound quality and noise ‌cancellation, the AirPods offer a range of smart features that enhance the user experience.

### AirPods 4 Specs and Potential Features

The AirPods 4 are expected to inherit some features from ‌the Pro‌ models, such as ⁤adaptive EQ, skin-detect sensors for improved automatic pausing, and potentially Find My network integration for enhanced tracking. Rumors⁢ of airpods 4 pro rumors also suggest possible new health monitoring capabilities.

### AirPods Pro 2 Features: A Wealth of Functionality

The AirPods Pro 2 are packed with features, including:

*   **Personalized Spatial Audio:** Tailors the Spatial Audio ‍experience to your unique head shape.
*⁢  ​ **Adaptive Transparency:** Intelligently ‍adjusts the level of noise​ cancellation to let essential sounds through.
*   **Conversation Awareness:** Automatically lowers the volume and enhances voices when you start‍ talking.
*   **Touch Control:** Allows you to control playback, ‍volume, and answer calls with simple gestures.
*   **magsafe Charging Case:** Compatible with ‍MagSafe chargers for convenient wireless charging.
*   **U1 Chip:** Enables Precision Finding with the Find My app.

### Feature Face-Off

The AirPods pro 2 currently offer a more comprehensive suite of features. While the AirPods 4 may gain some Pro-level functionalities, they're unlikely to match the Pro ⁤2's full feature set. The airpods 4th generation​ vs airpods pro 2nd generation in ⁢features favor the Pro model.

[[Explore Top Rated airpod 4 vs airpod pro 2 on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/airpods-pro/?kw=airpod 4 vs airpod pro 2)
## Price⁤ and Value: Balancing Cost with⁣ Performance

Price is a critical consideration for many buyers. Let's ⁢compare the expected prices of the AirPods 4 and⁢ the current‍ price ⁣of the AirPods Pro 2.

### AirPods ⁤4 ‍Price Expectations

The AirPods 4​ are expected⁣ to be priced higher than ‍the previous generation of standard AirPods,reflecting‌ their potential new features and improved⁢ performance. Depending on if Apple decides on‌ the dual release ‍of an ANC and non-ANC enabled model of the airpod‍ 4, this ‌may result in a range of costs.

### AirPods Pro 2 Price: A premium Investment

The AirPods Pro 2 are priced as a ‌premium product, reflecting their advanced ⁣features and superior performance. However, it’s crucial⁤ to keep an eye out for airpods pro 2 price drop, especially around⁣ major shopping events ⁣like Black Friday.

### Value Proposition

Determining which offers better value depends on your​ individual needs​ and budget. If you ⁤prioritize top-tier audio quality, noise ⁤cancellation, and features, the AirPods Pro​ 2 are worth the investment. However, if you're looking for a more affordable option with improved sound and features over the standard AirPods, the ⁢AirPods 4 might be the better‌ choice, especially if‍ the ""airpods 4 release date price"" is compelling.⁢ Keeping an eye ‍out for ""airpods black friday deals"" ‍or a ""airpods pro‍ 2 sale"" can significantly impact the value proposition.

[[Explore Top Rated airpod 4 vs airpod pro 2 on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/airpods-pro/?kw=airpod 4 vs airpod pro 2)
## Water Resistance: Handling ⁣the Elements

Water​ resistance⁤ is a valuable feature for anyone who plans to use their earbuds during‌ workouts or in wet conditions.

### ​AirPods ‌4 Water Resistance: Improved Protection?

The AirPods 4 are expected to offer improved water resistance compared to previous generations, ⁣potentially with an IPX4 rating, protecting them from splashes ​and sweat. ‍A look into the airpods 4 water⁤ resistance will ​be vital before buying.### AirPods Pro 2 ⁤Water Resistance: Built⁣ for‌ Active Lifestyles

The AirPods Pro 2 ​are also IPX4-rated, providing protection⁤ from sweat ⁢and water splashes.

### Water​ Resistance Verdict

Both the‌ AirPods 4 and airpods Pro 2 offer similar levels of water resistance, making them suitable for workouts and everyday‍ use.

## Should You Upgrade?

The decision to upgrade⁣ your exiting Airpods depends on what you are looking for.

### ⁢Should You ​Upgrade ⁢to AirPods 4?

If⁤ you own an⁤ older generation of standard AirPods and‍ are looking for improved sound quality, potentially active noise cancellation⁤ and a more comfortable fit (with adjustable‍ ear tips), the airpods 4 might be a ‌worthwhile upgrade.

### Should You Upgrade to AirPods Pro 2?

If you prioritize the best possible⁣ audio quality, industry-leading noise cancellation, and a comprehensive set of features, upgrading to ‌the AirPods Pro 2 is a compelling option.

[[Explore Top Rated airpod 4 vs airpod pro 2 on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/airpods-pro/?kw=airpod 4 vs airpod pro 2)
## AirPods pro 2 Alternatives:⁣ exploring Other ‍Options

If neither the AirPods 4 nor the AirPods⁣ Pro 2 seem like the perfect fit, here are some ​choice wireless earbuds to consider:

*   **Sony ⁣WF-1000XM5:** Known for their ⁢exceptional noise cancellation⁢ and sound quality.
*   **Bose QuietComfort ⁤Earbuds II:** Another top contender in the noise cancellation category.
*   ‌**Samsung‍ Galaxy Buds2​ Pro:** Offer excellent sound quality and integrate seamlessly with⁣ Samsung devices.
*   **Cheaper AirPods⁢ Alternatives:** ⁤Plenty of budget-friendly wireless earbuds that deliver impressive sound and features⁣ for the price.

## Conclusion: Making the Right Choice

Choosing between the AirPods 4 vs‍ AirPods Pro 2 ultimately depends on your individual priorities and budget. The AirPods Pro 2 remain⁢ the ⁤champions in audio quality, noise cancellation, and features. However, ‌the AirPods 4, if the rumors prove true ‍offer a compelling upgrade path from older AirPods, potentially bridging ⁤features from‌ pro models. ‌If finding the ""cheapest airpods"" and ‍you do not mind foregoing features, a standard Airpod model may suit your needs.

As you weigh your options, consider these key factors:

*   **Sound Quality:** How important is top-tier audio fidelity to you?
*   **Noise Cancellation:** Do you need industry-leading ANC to block out ⁣distractions?
*   **Features:** Which features are most important for your‍ listening⁢ experience?
*   **Price:** How much are you willing to spend on wireless earbuds?
    Keep an ​eye out for sales or special offers on both airpods and alternative brands ⁢as⁢ you decide.
    Remember to‍ research ‌and read reviews thoroughly before making a purchase. Armed with this information, you can confidently choose the AirPods that best fit your needs and elevate your listening experience. Happy listening!

Thursday - Joe went to work. Trip to coffee shop. Claimed homelessness on her page, lots of posts, comments, and deleting. Discussed concert plans again, Joe brought her more coffee,  went to nail salon, DoorDashed Joe Chick-Fil-A, got road trip snacks, Joe cooked her stir fry.

Friday - went to coffee shop. Talked about concert plans again. Sadfished about Grams, claimed sweet mama stopped by with Pineapple Bliss. Packed for concert, left for concert with Joe driving. Ate What-a-Burger. 

Saturday - shopped all day. Ate What-a-Burger again. Got ready for concert. Went to concert. 

Sunday - Joe drove home from concert. Joe went grocery shopping. Joe cooked dinner. Kooky allegedly did laundry. 

Now, please tell me what was so busy about this week other than the concert? Where was she so “on the go” to other than the coffee shop and the concert? Joe cooked almost every meal or they got takeout. Joe drove to and from the concert. Joe cleaned snow off the cars. Joe went to the grocery store. She barely left the house all week, and only for things SHE wanted to do, like nails and coffee and the concert. She barely cooked anything all week. Anyone who believes she is SO BUSY needs their head checked.

1ix5bc4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ix5bc4,Lazydaze Coffeeshop on St Marys,"Cool new (to me) coffee shop that offers much more than just your average caffeine fix! Word to mouth recommendation from my brother brought me in the door and I was pleasantly surprised. This coffee shop dually operates as a dispensary/smoke longue.

Great interior vibe and decor. We happened to go on a Sunday which they had a few vinyl record DJs spinning some good tunes. The staff was super friendly and offered insight to all the different products they offered. 

They offer a variety of coffee based drinks and flavored tea options. The cool part is they offered THC, CBD, and mushroom infusions to their drinks. For other recreational use they offer cannabis in both flower and concentrate form. The flower can be bought by the gram or they offer house pre rolls. For on site concentrate use they rent out their bongs and dab rigs too which I'd only seen in states like Colorado, California, or up in the PNW. 

Only thing I wasn't sure about is if the THC was any of the delta 9 or THCA that is often seen in San Antonio but it definitely was advertised as just THC. I only purchased a pre rolled joint that was an Indica dominant hybrid and it was pretty good! ",8,1740412574.0,sanantonio,1,0.75,False

Well a few weeks ago I applied for a role asking for 2+ years of experience. For reference, the job has been reposted every few weeks or so since last summer (which is always a great sign). Finally, I got a phone interview for today at 10:30.

The interviewer calls me from a different country at 10:05, when I’m literally making coffee. Immediately grilling me about where I live, no friendly greetings. It started with the usual “Where are you located?” and “Can you make the commute?” questions. Then came the dealbreaker:

Interviewer: “Do you have 2+ years of experience in mechatronics design?”
Me: “I’m a new grad, but I have 16 months of related internships and more than two years of experience with all the technologies listed in the job posting.”
Interviewer: “Sorry, the company is very strict—it must be 2+ years of working experience. Good luck.”

And that was it.

1ix57b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ix57b6/aitah_for_trying_to_check_up_on_my_friend/,Aitah for trying to check up on my friend?,"Context: My friend A (24, f) struggled with suicidal thoughts and self harm in the past. she took years and years of therapy and I was under the misconception that she was over those issues and was feeling better mentally. A few months ago, she posted a story on her private account that she hadn't been feeling well mentally and nearly attempted suicide. I tried reaching out to her but she didn't reply to any messages or calls for hours and hours. I was very distraught, and thought I should reach out but did  research and her boyfriend gave me advice to give her space. She replied at the end of the day saying she's feeling better now. I tried my best to be more present and attentive after that day,  now that I knew she was still struggling. 

A few months after that, I woke up to messages from her boyfriend that they almost split up last night after a major fight and she's shut herself in the bathroom with a knife (or blade, I don't remember) A few minutes later he texted shes out of the bathroom now and is sleeping. Again, I tried reaching out to her but she didn't reply. In both these scenarios she wasn't alone and her bf who she lives with was with her or not too far, keeping tabs on her.

I had plans with her tonight and she cancelled yesterday around midday saying she's not in the best mental space. I obviously understood and said to let me know if she needed any help or wanted to talk over a coffee anytime during the week. She declined. I told her take care and we ended that there. Yesterday night around 9 pm I sent her an SMS to check in on her as I thought her mental health is bad due to the work stress she's been under. She didn't reply till late night. 

Next morning I saw her bf texted me around 3.30 am saying that her childhood dog (we don't live in our home countries, so she found out over a video call) passed away and they had a fight over text and he asked me to check in on her and if possible go visit her. ( He's overseas on a family trip) As soon as I saw the messages I texted her again, a simple hi...no replies. I thought she obviously needs space. I went on about my day, a bit worried but trying to be understanding. 

The whole day passed and there's still no communication from her no messages no reels nothing. She hasn't been replying to me, her bf or her other very close friend (B) who also lives overseas so we're all very worried. I text her again around 11.20 saying just send me a dot so we know your okay.

At this point, I've decided that I will just go visit her tomorrow morning, If she doesn't reply to my message by the next morning. I text the same thing to her boyfriend that I will go to your house if she doesn't reply to my message by tomorrow morning to which he replies that she just replied to my messages and she is really pissed that I told you guys about her dog passing. I said I understand why she would be mad about that but we just care about her and just want to know that she is okay.

 Soon I get a message from this friend. A who hasn't replied to me in the last 24 hours. The message tone  extremely angry. she said she didn't owe me a reply and said  that I was hijacking her grieving time and she didn't get to grieve the way she wanted because he told everybody about her dog. She said she wasn't ready and that's why she wasn't replying or talking to anybody and he deprived her of that privilege. 

I completely understand why she would be mad about not having control over how the news went out but I feel like he's not wrong being worried when he's overseas given her history. 

In the long angry message that she sent me, she also included how her boyfriend hasn't reached out to her called her or anything on his quote"" family trip and that instead of messaging her and hijacking her grieving time, I should message him and ask him instead of her. She said we're only ""checking in"" on her for our peace of mind as we're worried she'll turn up d*ad the next day (her exact words) She sent a similar message to B as well. 

Her message really hurt me. I was just trying to be a good friend. I'm the only person who's kinda close to her in the same city as her bf and B are both overseas. I'm extremely upset and I don know what to do. Was I the as-hole?

1ix571l,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1ix571l/i_win_worst_roommate/,I win worst roommate.,"When i (f/25) first met our roommate (m/28 lets call him Nate) in 2021 he immediately gave me the creeps. One of the first things he said to me was that he is a ""diagnosed sociopath"". That was a lie. You can't be in the military with that diagnosis.

My husband (29 lets call him Miles) and i started dating in may of that year. When I met him (rm) I tried to do everything I could to make him feel welcome (he had just came home from the military) He didn't really seem interested and didn't care. About a month or so later He and my husband were talking about getting a house together. I told my husband that i didn't think it was a good idea. You should NEVER live with your friends if you want to stay friends with him.

I've always been pretty good at reading people. He is not good company.

We have all been living together since Dec. of 21. So about 3.5 years. Over these years there have been several fights between me and Nate specifically. Always started by Nate, and ONLY when he thought Miles wasn't around to hear the way he spoke to me. In the beginning I tried not to argue back, tried to ignore him, until one day I had enough of him yelling and screaming at me. I told Miles every time something happened and he would go talk to Nate. There has been 1 occasion where it got physical between them. Over how he's been speaking to me. They broke my damn bookshelf.

**Important things to know about Nate:**

\~He hates women.

\~He has 2 s/a allegations against him 3 days apart.

\~He's never wrong.

\~He's better than me, you, everyone on this earth. Possibly even God himself.

**Important thins to know about Miles:**

\~He has always been one to help everyone.

\~It takes a lot to make him upset.

\~He and Nate have been friends since they were 16.

\~He doesn't see when people are taking advantage of his kindness.

**Important things to know about me:**

\~I'm typically really kind and polite. But my mom taught me how to stand up for myself.

\~I'm a prek teacher, I have nothing but patience and love for everyone.

\~I will do anything to protect those I love and care about.

\~My intuition has NEVER steered me astray.

Miles and I got married in Oct. so naturally for a little while there was wedding stuff everywhere. One day in late Aug. early Sept. I was in the office working on some signs for the wedding while on ft with one of my bridesmaids. He decided to come in and tell me that all of my friends are ugly and how it would be awesome if they all just slit their wrists in front of me. I told him the conversation was over and he needed to get out. The morning of wedding rehearsal (at the house) Miles and I had started cleaning and gathering things to get ready to load and take to the venue the following morning. Nate had offered to help. By help i mean he shoved random things into random boxes and put them in random places. Causing us to have to run back and forth between home and the venue on our wedding day. Luckily it was only 15 min away. However, I didn't find the cake topper until we got back from our honeymoon, along with other odds and ends.

On Dec. 3 my husband had a septoplasty. When I got him home that night he was still in and out from the anesthesia, pain meds, and ya know... surgery. I had him set up on the couch and I was sitting on the living room floor. Nate comes into the living room asking me to move my cricut machine, desk, and all my crafting supplies out of the office that we shared because he was planning on moving his girlfriend (22) in and wanted to make the office an art studio. I politely told him no, there's nowhere else to put it and that its a shared space. He starts getting loud telling me how it's happening and there's nothing i can do about it. I then told him again how its a shared space and I'm not willing to give up my crat area. He started getting loud and I kept telling him to quiet down and reminding him how Miles is resting and he will not wake him up with this bullshit. Mind you its 11 pm and my husband is on the couch trying to recover. He came back like 10 minutes later asking me if i was pregnant. (I had just bought a box of ovulation tests and they were in MY bathroom) I told him no, and he said ""If it were me I'd wait till I was stable and in my own place. But that's just me"" now I know that doesn't sound like much, but put a condescending tone on it. I then told him that its none of his business. Somehow it had escalated to him yelling and screaming at me, not even about the office but about cleaning the house and how my bedroom was a mess. I told him several times I'm nobody's maid and how my bedroom is none of his business. He then kept trying to open my bedroom door and went on about how in court it's evidence of me being unfit to have a child. (It was laundry by the way. I was in the process of going through my clothing and getting rid of things.) I went back to the living room to check on Miles and make sure he was still sleeping, and sur enough Nate followed me, yelling and screaming. Now, this isn't my proudest moment. I definitely could and should have handled it better. He kept going on about how Miles deserves better than me and how I'm worthless. I'm a child, and how I should do everyone a favor and just end my pathetic life. I looked Nate dead in the face and lost my shit. I said ""I'm a child? really? Says the only person in the house that can't seem to hold a fucking job longer than a month. The guy that can't wipe his ass if it weren't for me. You think you're so much better than everyone else, that's why you have 2 s/a allegations against you, got kicked out of the military, have inappropriate conversations with little girls, and only have the balls to talk to me when Miles can't do anything."" He then tried to tell me that if it weren't for him Miles wouldn't be where he is today. He can afford all the bills by himself. To which i said ""you can? Then do it, stop mooching off of us"" 4 days later he called his mom to ask for money for groceries.

He did move his girlfriend in and that poor girl. (Rachel) They met online when she was 16. (he would've been 21) Been ""dating"" on and off for years. Every time it ended with her ghosting him. But she's actually here now. She is super sweet and all he does is lie to her. Things have been pretty okay since she got here. Except for Nate purposely trying to inconvenience us. (drinking all the milk that we buy and not replacing it. Hopping up to cook dinner every time i say I'm going to start dinner. Stupid stuff like that) They haven't been cleaning up after themselves, doing their dishes, or anything. Yesterday, Miles was in the dinning room drinking coffee and playing video games. Rachel and Nate started cleaning the kitchen and the whole time Nate is sitting there telling Rachel that Miles and I are the sole reason for the mess in there, how we're disgusting etc. meanwhile their dishes have been sitting in the sink for 2 weeks straight and Miles has been doing our dishes. Every time I cook I clean the stove top off etc. The kitchen wasn't nasty or anything at all. Miles got tired of hearing it and said how its not our mess, how we've been cleaning up after them. I'm not entirely sure what happened. I was in the bedroom until I heard them yelling back and forth and then a loud thud. Apparently Nate kept getting in Miles face screaming and spitting on him, so Miles picked him up and threw him. I came out of the bedroom took my dogs outside and well mainly to see what was going on. Miles was telling Nate that he is no better than anyone else in the house, how we've all had to clean up after each other. To which Nate responded \*best god complex voice\* ""YES THE FUCK I AM!! I AM BETTER THAN EVERYONE IN THIS HOUSE"" then somehow everything was my fault. Mugs that I didn't use, with coffee i didn't drink sitting out all day, my fault. Their dirty dishes left in the sink, my fault. Food in the fridge that needs thrown out, my fault. His ROTTING fruit, my fault. The grease trap in the air fryer I hardly use, my fault. The mess on the stove top from Rachel cooking last night, my fault. And how dare I keep a jar of dried flowers and petals Miles gave me. Then he started in about our bedroom again. Again its JUST LAUNDRY. Our washer broke so when we fixed it we had to play catch up. He started saying how there's a smell coming from our room. Lmfaoooo IT'S AIR PLUGS!! Miles told him the smell in the house is from Nate and Rachel smoking weed in the house 24/7 and Nate smoking cigarettes.

I pulled miles out of the kitchen and dinning room area and into our bedroom. I called my mom and she's letting us stay here for a few days. On our way out I overheard their conversation. Rachel was saying how it looks like we're leaving and Nate said ""Good. If their leaving that just boosts my ego"" Before i walked out the door I yelled ""Fuck your ego! Fuck your god complex! Fuck you thinking your superior to everyone else!"" and left.

There have been several arguments between Nate and I. I won't bother you with the details of all of them but here are the ones that made the highlight reel:

\~Me cleaning up the mess from the grease fire HE STARTED, him coming in yelling and bitching to me about who knows what. Wouldn't stop or leave me alone until i went into my bedroom and called Miles.

\~The one about my friends \^

\~Him bucking up to my dogs, then wondering why they don't like him.

\~Him telling me I'm worthless.

\~I asked him if he was okay one time when he was viably upset. I got told i was piece of shit then he punched a hole in his door.

\~He tried to tell me I know nothing about cooking because I told him the only difference between heavy cram and whipping cream is the fat content. (guy can't even cook frozen crab cakes)

\~He got mad when we asked him not to eat the instant noodles we bought for lunches and ripped the handle off the microwave.

\~I came home from grocery shopping one day to see his bedroom window open all the way middle of winter in the Midwest!! We've asked him several times to stop doing that. I told Miles and sent him a snapchat with the window open. He kept calling me a liar. Then threw a hissy fit. I have the voice memo.

Anywaaaaay. We're working on getting out of there asap. But I don't think I can go back there when Miles does. I don't want our relationship to suffer from me not being there, but I also can't be there. I can't keep getting blamed for everything, getting yelled at by man child, and I'm tired of walking on eggshells in my home.

One last thing, this is going back to him being a ""sociopath"" the traits and behaviors of someone who is in fact a sociopath do not align with him at all in anyway shape or form. Yes, he throws tantrums. Yes, he doesn't care about other peoples things. Yes, he's extremely shallow and self centered. NONE of that is due to him being a ""sociopath"" That just a little rich boy not getting his way. I mean this guy was waited on hand and foot his whole life. His parents are so rich they have a live in ""cleaning lady"". Anything Nate wants, he gets from his parents. These are the type of people who go to Disney every year, sometimes twice. Nate is just a spoiled rotten brat who was never disciplined as a child.

1ix55ny,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1ix55ny/dating_app_tips_for_women_from_a_guy/,Dating App Tips for Women (from a guy),"Wanted to share some dating app and dating tips for women as a man. Some of these may also help men as well. I see a lot of posts in this sub like ""Where are all the good Christian guys?"" or ""I'm giving up dating apps; they don't work!!"" The answer is good Christian guys are able to quickly find good Christian women if both parties are attractive and trying fairly hard to find and be found. 

I'm a guy, 30, kinda suburban Illinois, pretty average looks, started using dating apps extensively at the end of 2023 after a ton of research. I've been on dates with 7 women during 2024, and entered 4 relationships (including my current, and God willing last, one of four months). 

- Put yourself out there on lots of the apps. Some really great people are only on one or two so you should be willing to take the 20 minutes to sign up for and put your profile on a variety to better spread the net. Here's what I recommend for US Christians in order: Hinge (most populous, profiles have a guaranteed minimum standard), Upward (most populous Christian app), HOLY (very good user interface and user experience, and fairly large amount of people). After signing up for those 3 if you want to do more: Bumble (secular, but OK number of people on it), SALT (this is more if you want a LDR. It's Christian but not very many people), Coffee Meets Bagel (I had a date from this one and also a few good conversations although it's an older and smaller app), FacebookDating (I never got around to using this but have heard good things from some friends). That's probably enough to juggle but there are a dozen more if you REALLY want to throw out your profile super wide. 

- Actually spend time on your profile. Just because you're a woman doesn't mean you shouldn't care. I've seen so many (even Christian) women's profiles where it's obviously where they only spent 3 minutes on it. It was unattractive to me. It shows you're less likely to care about other things in your life if dating is such a low priority. Put good pictures up and put a good profile up. Do research on this. A good source is the Hinge subreddit which is mostly profile reviewing where you can see mistakes other women and men are doing and learn from them. 

- Be enthusiastic. I believe every women I actually asked out through apps was enthusiastic with me. That means they replied relatively soon (after a few hours or within 24 hours at most), they weren't dry, and they actually asked me questions. If a woman didn't ask me questions, I was turned off and didn't really feel like pursuing her (rightfully so). 

- Be bold. Being bold can really pay off for you. My longest term ex-GF offered me her number when we were on the app very soon and without me explicitly asking for it. My current GF messaged me first with a funny line and was very responsive to me, especially once I asked her out for our first date. Also, flirting goes a long way from the side of the woman; it shows interest.

- Be desirable. What I think a lot of guys want comes down to this: physically attractive, spiritually attractive, emotionally attractive. Physical is pretty obvious - take care of yourself in all manners. Like yes, actually lose that weight that will get you out of the overweight category on the BMI chart. I cannot emphasize this enough - such a huge portion of attractiveness is weight. I'm not a hypocrite - I lost 50 lbs in about 4 months in early 2024 and saw drastic improvements in confidence and who I could attract. Spiritually - love Jesus, don't be afraid to show that on your profile (i.e. my GF literally said she loves Jesus and wants her partner to be on the ""same stand with their faith walk"" on her Hinge profile). She asked me good questions and made it clear therefore that she was interested. After 4 or 5 messages I asked for her number because I knew she was special and wanted to progress with her. It's so weird but looking back at the photos she chose for her profile, a lot of them are not her ""best"" look - I was at the time way more attracted to the outpouring of her faith and her spirituality and intentions. She is very beautiful though. Another element I would put under spiritually is modesty - I think Christian men almost always want someone who is modest. It's hot to have a woman only interested in showing a lot of skin or dressing up for her future husband. Emotionally - Christian men want Christian women who are stable and secure. My GF has issues and problems in her life, but she approaches them in a calm manner. She is not hot and cold with me. She always makes me feel secure and loved in the relationship and I do the same for her. We don't play games with each other. We are deliberate. 

- Don't be financially in ruin. I don't think a lot of guys care about their partner's career that much. We just don't want her to be in a mountain of debt because of irresponsibility. Have some sort of career if you can and don't just say ""I want to be a housewife."" Men want a partner and not just to be taken advantage of financially. 

- Don't mess around when you have a good thing. It's good to have options. I remained on dating apps until my 3rd date with my GF and she did the same. However, she brought up having a ""defining the relationship"" talk in between our 2nd and 3rd dates and I remember talking in my car in the mall parking lot on our 3rd date about how we're both not seriously talking with anyone else and expressing exclusivity. Why did we do this? Because we both realized that we actually did like each other and knew each other's character fairly well enough to see a future with each other. When you reach that point stop messing around or playing games and focus on each other. It may come later, it may come earlier. But try your best to know when that moment is. 

- Have hobbies / interests. It's unattractive to just watch TV in all your time off or scroll through your phone. 

- On dates, be attentive and kind and interested in the guy. I have been on dates where my date asked me barely any questions about myself. It's a sucky feeling as a guy. We want to talk about ourselves a bit too. It doesn't have to be 50/50 but be cognizant of actually trying to get to know the man you're on a date with. 

- Don't be afraid of serious questions. I asked my GF a ton of serious questions on our first date. I was genuinely interested in her responses. I didn't want to waste my time or hers. She asked me a few too. Don't be afraid to be serious and not waste time. We went on a walk first, where I kept things casual, then I asked her if she was having a good time and since she was, I met her at a casual restaurant and then asked the questions (we had both expressed a lot of interest at that point). 

- Don't be afraid of silly mistakes. On our first date, my GF went to the wrong park, at the complete wrong part of town. I waited 30 minutes for her to get to the right park and by that time there were no more parking spaces so we both had to park half a mile away. She felt embarrassed. I didn't care. It makes for a nice, cute story now that we can tell other people. And it's not a terrible thing to keep someone waiting for a bit (maybe not 30 minutes though haha) as they will think to themselves ""It's OK - she's worth it."" 

- It's OK to be slow. My GF didn't want to hold my hand on a walk on our 2nd date. It threw me off a bit but I understood and we talked about it. And at the end of our date I just asked if I could put my arm around her and she said yes and really liked that. She actually ended up texting me after that she'd be comfortable holding hands in the future because I respected her. We didn't kiss until our fifth date despite me really wanting to. Looking back, these boundaries and slowdowns were attractive. It made her higher value in my eyes. It made me willing to wait for her because God helped me realize she was worth it. 

- Have time for dates. I dated a woman who did not really have time for dates, who shortened or cancelled dates a lot. We were both very physically attracted to each other and I expressed a lot of desire to spend time with her, we lived 10 minutes away, but she frequently did not make me a priority and that ultimately led to our break up. I felt very used because all she would want to do usually is go to dinner (and I paid for it) and then she would have something else to do. If you want to date, have that time to date. My GF and I usually do 2-3 dates a week; we usually spend most of Saturdays together. Another very attractive thing my GF does is always plan/confirm the next time we'll see each other towards the end of our date so we both know for sure. It's nice because it shows she actually cares. Also, guys don't care a ton about what we do. I've been to Walmart with my GF as she buys her groceries like 5 times. I just like spending time with her; I don't really care that the activity isn't the most exciting thing in the world; I appreciate her wanting to do the boring things with me. 

- Don't be afraid to take SOME of the lead. Guys generally want to lead but we don't want to lead 100% of the time. We usually love it when our GFs come up with date ideas that we'd both enjoy. I would say I like leading 75-90% of the time. One woman I dated, I set up the entire first date, we had a couple phone calls, I set up the 2nd date, but she didn't want to do that so she suggested an entirely different date on a different, later day in an entirely different city just to go to a fancy restaurant. Very unattractive to me. If she would have just gone with my original 2nd date idea, we probably would have dated longer. Instead, God intervened and I got set up with a different woman whom I ended up pursuing instead. Since I didn't like that 2nd date idea and liked the other woman more, I broke it off with the woman who changed the date plans. 

- Don't be afraid of commitment. Men like the security of having the DTR talk too. Men like a woman who expresses to them in multiple ways that they like them a lot, that they are having a lot of fun, that they appreciate their qualities and want to progress further. And men like compliments - we don't get a lot from people other than our mom and our GFs. 

- Be selective of who you go on dates with. I was. I never had a bad first date. I made sure the women I asked out were Christians, met most of my dealbreakers, and were interesting and interested in me enough to have fun with. But also at the same time don't be super picky. Give guys a chance if their character appears good, they seem intentional about pursuing you, and you are at least somewhat attracted to them.

In summary, be the most attractive woman you can be. Start this by investing time into your profile and pictures on multiple apps. Continue this by being emotionally available on dates. Know when to let the man lead but don't be afraid of setting your own boundaries. Don't be afraid to flirt, ask your dealbreaker questions, and define the relationship. Enthusiasm, kindness, emotionally maturity, and boldness go a long way. And above all - don't give up! A lot of the good men are going to get very quickly swept up after a few weeks on the apps. Be active enough and swiping enough to come across them. Don't throw your hands up in the air after a few bad experiences. You are looking for ONE man who will be there for you and lead you into marriage. The bozos before him are lessons and experiences to help you better know who you are and who you're looking for.",5,1740412192.0,ChristianDating,1,1.0,False

I've known my best friend Mia (20f), since we were kids, because our parents were friends so we practically grew up together. 

My brother and I are quite close. Our parents got divorced when I was around 5, and our mom got full custody, and we lived with her and my stepdad, along with his two kids. Our mom spent a lot of time more focused on her new family than Liam and I, and she even asked Liam to move out once to make more room since he was older, and the kids were growing and needed their own rooms.

As far as I know, after Liam moved out for college, he stopped talking to mom altogether.

The issue is Mia recently told me that she liked my brother. The three of us would hang out a lot. Back when I was living with mom, I'd spend a lot of time with Liam and Mia just to get out of the house, though my mom did try to make me bring the kids every once and a while.

Shee asked me if I knew if she had a shot, and I told her probably not because Liam's last relationship didn't go so well.

He didn't talk about the relationship much, but one night he called around 2 in the morning, and I could tell he had been crying. He said that he had broken up with his ex because things were getting really toxic. I won't give into everything that happened, but his ex tried to unalive him, then tried to unalive himself. 

I could tell it really messed him up because he started crying again while we talked. We met up for coffee the next day and we talked for hours. He said that his ex was getting really angry recently, accusing him of things, cheating, lying, hiding things. He had tried to leave before, but he ex threatened to unalive himself and even sent him a picture of an empty bottle of pills. (He didn't take them, he flushed them.)

Needless to say, I didn't tell Mia this, but she picked up that I wasn't saying everything, and kept asking why, and I told her that it was personal and that Liam just wasn't ready for another one.

I thought that'd be it, but I found out from Liam that Mia reached out to him asking why he wasn't ready for a relationship, and Liam didn't tell her either, which caused me to have to tell him that Mia liked him. He doesn’t like her back.

Since then Mia's been snappy, and she stopped telling me things, saying that I thought we kept secrets from each other now, and making posts about how some people keep secrets, and the differences between a real friend and a fake one.

I don't know what to do. She's my best friend, and I don't think I'm in wrong as what happened is really personal to my brother, but I don't want to lose her over this.",2,1740412183.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

I've been using the Ninja Cafe Luxe ES601 (EU) for a while now, and overall, I’m really happy with it. The espresso is great, and I love the ease of use. But there are a few small things that are bothering me, and I was wondering if anyone has experienced the same issues—or better yet, found solutions.

1. Barista Assist keeps changing the grind size for the single basket – Even though I always use the same beans, it starts at grind size 14 and then gradually lowers it to around 6 over multiple uses. At some point, it jumps back to 14 and starts the cycle again. This doesn’t happen with the double basket. Is this normal? And is there a way to keep it consistent?


2. Inconsistent espresso yield – Even when I don’t change the grind size, I get different amounts of espresso each time. I’m not sure if this is due to tamping or something else the machine is doing automatically. Any ideas?


3. Leftover coffee grounds in the single basket – When I knock out the puck, there’s always a lot of coffee left in the single basket, while the double basket is almost completely clean after just one knock. Not a huge deal, but it’s a bit annoying.


Has anyone else had similar experiences with this machine? Any tips on how to fix or minimize these issues?

1ix509y,https://i.redd.it/bv8ink6vx3le1.jpeg,FORTUNE—Forget Quiet Luxury: America’s Wealthier 1% are Adopting a New Approach🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮,"FORTUNE—Billionaires and wealthy consumers are going bold—from opting for loud fashion choices, to making flashy public appearances. It’s a far cry from the popular “quiet luxury” trend of muted colors and nonexistent logos that’s dominated for years in an attempt to hide wealth and power. 

At this year’s New York Fashion Week events, attendees were starting to break from the mold of quiet luxury. The looks weren’t exclusively understated—bolder prints, luxe fabrics, and even fur pieces were spotted on and off the runway from top designers such as Michael Kors, Coach, and Carolina Herrera. This change in consumer tastes reflect a growing hunger for individuality.

“There are two tracks in this luxury trend: There’s a quiet version, there’s a loud version,” Chandler Mount, founder of Affluent Consumer Research Company, told Fortune.

America’s billionaires and corporate elite are getting bolder, which could be empowering the luxury shopping class to do the same. CEOs are stepping out of the shadows and into the limelight—a prime example being this year’s presidential inauguration, attended by tech leaders Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Tim Cook. It’s unusual for titans of industry to attend the event, let alone be seated in front of the incoming president’s chief staffers. Jeff Bezos’ wife Lauren Sánchez also made a splash by wearing a daring white bralette peeping from her low-cut pantsuit. 

CEOs once lead without drawing too much attention to themselves for the sake of their companies, but that is no longer the case. Billionaires are getting bolder, mirroring wealthy society’s growing desire for individuality and expression—especially in fashion. Sturdy, hand-dyed cotton shirts and satin skirts can get boring, just like making big business moves in the background. 

BOLDLY STEPPING INTO THE SPOTLIGHT 

Billionaires are no longer as inconspicuous as they once were.

Tech CEOs have become entertaining personalities that the public tunes into each week. The likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk all rose to prominence as unassuming, hoodie-wearing tech-bros. Now, they’ve leaned into high-flying, leather jacket-wearing, public-facing personas. 

Zuckerberg has hosted livestreams to chat with online users, is lobbying at the U.S. capitol, and trailed behind an MMA fighter walking into the sports area. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos lounges on his $500 million megayacht, fielded the public questions for who should star in his studio’s upcoming movie, and is photographed donning edgier looks alongside his manicured wife. The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is no exception to the trend. He towered above President Donald Trump giving press briefings in the White House, wielded a chainsaw at a conservative conference, and went onstage at Dave Chappelle’s comedy show. 

This behavior is a far cry from the likes of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Both tech leaders were billionaires and pioneers of industry, but didn’t radiate an energy of grandeur. They didn’t make grandiose public appearances, or tried to spur attention towards themselves. Oftentimes, the CEOs only stepped into the spotlight to promote and demo their products: like the iPhone, or Microsoft Windows software. They certainly weren’t being loud—and didn’t seem to crave that.

But a shift has taken place in corporate America and amongst the country’s 1%. Wealthy individuals are turning to bold expression. This trend is reflected in ways rich people are expressing status—and themselves.  

LUXURY MOVING INTO LOUD EXPRESSION: ‘THE TIME HAS COME’

Mirroring the attitudes of forward-facing billionaires, more people are moving away from inconspicuous styling to loud expression.

“The time has come, and the next generation of luxury consumers is here. That 18 to 34-year-old consumer group is constantly redefining luxury, because they are the primary buyers of it,” Mount said. “They’re looking for more expression in what they’re wearing. They want people to learn something about them by what they wear.”

Quiet luxury initially rose as a style staple when many consumers were disillusioned with flashy branding and fast fashion—and it became the new “stealth” signifier of wealth. But the tables may have turned again, and people want to stand out; at this year’s New York Fashion week, fashion photographer and writer Simbarashe Cha noticed a turn in the tides of quiet luxury. 

Cha noted that show-goers and models were rocking new trends: an abundance of fur coats, animal prints, exaggerated silhouettes, and layered textures. The looks were subversive to the navy and all-black styles people were donning just a couple years before. Cha said that fashion is turning loud again—and certainly, some boundaries are being broken.

John Rogers, a U.S. fashion designer who has styled the likes of Zendaya and Gigi Hadid, has also witnessed the shift. His clothing combines that quiet luxury timelessness and quality with rich color and patterns. Behind the scenes of his New York Fashion Week show this year, he spoke with BBC about divergence from the plainness of quiet luxury. 

“We want newness; we want transformation,” Rogers said. “But we have to be willing to try some fresh approaches. We have to make people excited to get dressed again, to use clothes as a tool for hope… Even if you’re just wearing them to go down the street for coffee.”

1ix5065,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ix5065/confused_by_a_flirty_coworker/,Confused by a flirty coworker,"Disclaimer: I m not asking for dating advice per se but I dont know where else I should ask that question

I (50M) am married. I have a female co-worker (48F) who works on the same floor as me, lives in my neighborhood, and goes to the same gym.

I’ve been working here for about three years, while she has been here for over 15 years. She is a very attractive woman. Due to COVID, different work schedules, and other circumstances, I never really noticed her before. To be clear, I’m not looking for an affair—especially not at work.

A neighbor of mine, who also goes to the same gym, works in the building next to ours but for a different company. One day, he asked me if I knew her because he was aware that she worked at my company. He then mentioned me to her, and soon after, she appeared in my doorway. I was blown away by her beauty, but again, I’m not looking for anything.

That was about a year ago, and since then, I’ve started noticing her more—at work, at the gym, and sometimes even in my neighborhood.

Now, she is extremely flirty and touchy with me, even though we don’t talk much. It’s very confusing. I don’t respond flirtatiously, nor have I ever touched her.

In the past few weeks, she has taken things to another level. For instance, I was getting coffee when she placed both hands on my shoulders and asked if I wanted to do something together. I jokingly told her that I couldn’t because it would be too expensive—I’m married. In hindsight, maybe I shouldn’t have said that, but it just slipped out. Her response was: *“I was actually thinking of something like a bank robbery...”* as she walked out of the break room.

Then, last week, I was getting coffee again, and as I took milk out of the fridge, she walked by and said, *“You should drink mine. It tastes better, and it’s lactose-free.”* I was confused because I’m not lactose intolerant. About two minutes later, it hit me what she might have meant.

A couple of days later, I saw her at the gym. As she passed me, she bumped her ass against mine.

On Friday, I told her that she shouldn’t use a particular nickname for me because a former female coworker used to call me that, and she cried when I left the company. I find it silly to be called that. Her response? *“I would cry too if you left.”*

That was the last straw for me. Today, I asked if she wanted to go for a walk because I needed to talk to her. She seemed slightly irritated and asked, *“A walk???”*

Once we were outside the building, I asked her what this was all about. I told her that, while I felt flattered, I’m married, she’s married (with two children), and I don’t understand why she’s behaving this way. I asked if she was looking for a romantic relationship or if there was something else behind it. I also brought up specific instances—like the *bank robbery* comment and the time she placed both hands on my shoulders and asked if we should do something together. To my surprise, she claimed she couldn’t even remember saying that, which only made the whole situation even more confusing for me.

She denied everything, called the idea ridiculous, and insisted that she is very happily married—saying that no man could ever be a match for her husband.

So, what’s the deal here? Again, I’m **not** looking for dating advice. I just want to understand what is going on.",1,1740411802.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

“Rad!” exclaimed Spike, rushing in.

The room consisted of a desk with a computer, a bed, and a chaise lounge identical to the one in the office they had glimpsed. On the wall above the desk was a full cast poster of _Eternal Love_. Just over the fluffy pillows of the bed hung a life-size cutout of the Argentine footballer Lionel de Borges. On the far side of the room, an open door revealed a bathroom with a small shower. A miniature basketball hoop hung above it. Spike pulled it shut, picked up the plush ball from the desk, and took a shot—nothing but net. He slapped his chest with an open palm, then dove onto the bed, burying his head in the pillows.

Hawk sat at the computer, opened a browser, and started clicking. The screen filled with little boxes of security camera live feeds. He expanded one of the windows to full screen. It showed the ramp and entrance to the Cage with the black sedan parked in front, and half a dozen indistinct figures in trench coats stood around it as if on guard.

“Hunters _seki_,” said Spike.

Hawk hit a key, and another video opened. The front desk of the Cage, shot from an overhead angle, filled the screen. He pulled the time slider back until it showed the portly hipster opening a bag of chips and kicking his feet up on the desk.

“Fucking Kevin,” said Spike. “Does that guy even work?”

A moment later, a man in a black tracksuit walked in from the outside.

“That’s him. That’s Andreas,” Spike said in earnest, crawling to the end of the bed.

Hawk hit a button on the keyboard, and they had audio.

“I am looking for two boys. One of them is Asian, and the other one is African American.” The man spoke English with a fulsome, sophisticated accent.

“Not our line of work, bruh,” said Kevin the hipster.

“I appreciate that. I have it on good authority that they were here only moments ago.”

Kevin chuckled and popped a potato chip into his mouth. _Chomp crunch._

“Can’t you see that I’m busy?” he said. He crunched down on a handful.

“How much to make it worth your while?” asked the man. He had folded his arms across his chest.

“Five million dollars.” _Chomp, chomp, crunch, crunch._

“Fucking Kevin. Respect!” exclaimed Spike. He kissed two of his fingers and blew it at the screen.

“Hey man, there’re six million kids in the BAT. I don’t keep track of any of them. This is supposed to be a place where they don’t have to worry about the creepy shit that goes down out there. _Dumabikya_! Get lost! I’m on break.” _Chomp chomp._

“Perhaps I did not make the gravity of the situation clear. This is a matter of life and death,” said Andreas.

“Fuck, dude. I make it my business _not_ to see shit.”

“Can I look around?” said Andreas.

“Sure. A hundred bucks.”

Andreas slapped money on the desk and went into the Cage.

Hawk clicked the mouse, switching the feed.

Andreas walked without hurry around the ramps to the back where Nash had met the boys. At one point, he took a knee, touched the ground, brought his fingers to his nose, and lifted his head as if sniffing the air. He stood and climbed to the second level.

Hawk switched cameras again.

He leaned on the railing next to the bent-in-half metal table. In the background was the empty theater, the man in the chef’s shirt and pompadour haircut was spinning pizza dough into the air.

Hawk zoomed in on Andreas’s lean face. He wore a neatly groomed goatee and shiny black hair pulled back into a tight bun.

“It’s not the same guy who was talking to you,” said Nash.

“No, this is their leader,” said Spike, his eyes transfixed on the screen.

“The other two are his recruiters,” Hawk added. “They give you a choice: join up, or die. This guy is Spike’s tracker. He gets in his dreams.”

“Son of a bitch,” whispered Nash. He thought of the scars that marked the bodies of Francis and Ty. He now understood what Bridger tried to tell him on their midnight run out of the Mission Valley.

The monitor showed Andreas returning to the front desk where Kevin the hipster still munched on potato chips.

“Last chance,” said Andreas.

“You’re still fucking here?”

“I’m looking for two boys. One of them is Asian, and the other one African American. They were here a few minutes ago.”

“Oh yeah, them. You want their addresses?” said Kevin. “I have them right here.” He made like he was reaching into his pocket, coming back with a fat middle finger. “Get lost, asshole.”

In a fluid motion, faster than the eye could track, the hunter whipped out a pistol with a long silencer on the barrel. _Pfzzt pfzzt, pfzzt pfzzt pfzzt._

Kevin, in the middle of shoving chips into his face, flew back into his chair, hitting shelves behind him, and sending skateboards crashing down on top of him as he fell to the floor.

“No!” cried Spike.

Hawk’s hands reached out to the monitor.

Andreas looked at his handiwork. “Thanks for the help, _bruh_,” he mocked and walked out of the Cage.

Spike climbed into Hawk’s lap, and the teen encircled him with his arms. “I’m sorry,” he said. “You’re okay. He can’t track you.”

“Kevin,” said Spike.

“I know,” said Hawk.

Nash took out his Little Joe special and called Bridger. “It’s me. Remember I told you the back door?”

“Yeah,” said Bridger.

“Wait about ten minutes, then use it. Meet us at the van. Get in and wait. We’re coming.”

“Okay—Umm, _we_?”

But Nash had already ended the call.

“Don’t let him get me,” Spike said.

“I won’t,” said Hawk, who kissed his forehead. “I promise.”

“I have a van. Let’s go. It’s near the Minnesota Avenue entrance.”

Back in the hall, Hawk called to the bouncer, “Diesel, we need an exit.” Diesel drew a velvet ribbon across the hallway and escorted them through a hidden door behind the podium. A long, dark corridor stretched away.

“Follow that. Turn right at the end,” said Diesel. “The gates are unlocked.”

“Thanks, man,” said Hawk.

“Will I see you again?” asked Diesel.

“I don’t know,” Hawk said. “Shit’s fucked up.”

Diesel ran his fingers through Hawk’s hair, his hand lingering on his chin. Their eyes sharing an unwritten history. “You be careful out there, Hawk.”

The hallway stretched on for fifty yards, getting colder and colder. At the T-end, they turned right into the open-air cage of the skywalk that interlinked the upper city of the BAT. The gray day had dimmed to a cerulean evening, and the flashing lights and holographic advertisements were blinking into existence.

They passed through a gate, and when it shut, it locked behind them with an electric buzz and click. They climbed the stairs to a rooftop full of food carts and cooks preparing their evening meals. They crossed a bridge to another building where huge vents, like open mouths, belched plumes of steam.

Spike took it like a parkour trail for the exhibition of his athletic prowess, while Nash tried not to break an ankle.

At the edge of the building, a group of men smoked and drank tea from little paper cups. Even in their hurry, they stopped to honor the vista. The last finger of the setting sun broke the carpet of clouds and skyscrapers. Its orange beam hit the icicles on a scaffold, turning them into crystal fire. The faces of Hawk and Spike were lit by this fire also. Their young and curious eyes surveyed a savage and fallen world. A world that was out to get them.

***

They emerged from the stairs at street level a block from where Bridger waited in Ol’ Betsy, the heater running.

“What took you so long?” said Bridger as they piled in.

“Made some friends,” said Nash. “Bridger, meet Hawk and Spike.”

The boys sat in the back of the van, taking in the handiwork. Spike held on to Hawk.

“What happened?” asked Bridger.

“Crazy shit,” said Nash. “What… you’re smiling?”

“I’m not smiling.”

“You look different. You’re smiling,” observed Nash.

“I said I ain’t smiling.” He stared forward, but a smile crept back into his features. “All I got to say is I love that coffee shop.”

Nash negotiated a turnabout between a noodle cart and a Mercedes. He crossed Minnesota Avenue, taking them out of Asiatown into the low brick buildings of that city on the Rocky Mountain front.

“West End,” said Hawk.

Nash kept an eye on the rearview but saw no sign of ominous black cars. He took a right and headed east. He’d cut through the Heights, up and around on Airport Road, giving him plenty of time to detect a follower. In the back, the boys spoke quietly.

“Don’t tell Nine,” said Spike.

“Dude, it wasn’t your fault.”

“I chanted. The Hunters heard it. Andreas heard it. He’s here now… and Kevin is dead.”

“It will be okay. We’re close to finding the Maji. Goofy Foot here has already heard him. He’s real. It all happens tomorrow.”

The boy drew his young friend near as Ol’ Betsy zoomed through the streets.

They traversed the ritzy neighborhoods of the Heights, and then they were on the Airport Road, looking down on the city, sparkling and alive in the night. The massive structures of the BAT rose up like a bazaar monolith from a science fiction movie.

Far on the West End of Billings, Spike guided him to a cul-de-sac of expensive homes, except for one, which had been boarded over. Notices stuck into the lawn on stakes. A muscular boy in a tight muscle shirt stood in the cold in front of an open garage, his arms crossed, watching Nash pull up.

“Shit,” whispered Spike, “he looks pissed.”

“You did not come back in a strange fucking car after dark with my little brother!” the boy shouted.

“S’okay, Nine. We just got a ride. They cool,” said Spike.

“The fuck, Hawk?”

“Good evening to you too,” said Hawk.

“Three hours late, I don’t know where the fuck he is. Mom is flipping biscuits.”

Nash got out. “Hey, man, it’s all good. I was just giving them a ride home.”

When the older brother’s eyes fell on Bridger, he took a step back.

“I know, right?” said Spike. “He looks like Dad.”

Nine glared at Hawk. “Thing is, when you say ‘ride,’ I gotta wonder what the fuck you mean, nigga.”

“Fuck off, Nine,” Spike spit back, but before the boy could finish, his brother reached out and slapped. The sound of it echoed off the houses.

Spike grabbed his face and stared at his brother. “I hate you!” he shouted and ran into the house.

“Shit, Nine. What the fuck, man?” said Hawk.

Nine was pulling back to slug Hawk.

“Guys. Guys,” said Bridger, his voice baritone and authoritative.

The bigger boy dropped his hand and slapped his own face hard, twice.

“Nine, come on. Stop that,” said Hawk.

“Look, I got this.” Hawk pulled something from his pocket and tossed it to the youth, who deftly snatched it from the air. “Quarter vile. It’ll help her for a couple days. She can rest. And I got this.” He took the money Nash had given him from his pocket. “There’s almost enough now. We’ll get the spin. She’ll be okay.”

Nine took the money and shuffled it. “Already?”

“Yeah, I guess I’ve been busy.” Hawk turned and started walking down the sidewalk.

“Fuck, nigga, come on!” shouted Nine. “Hey, you know I didn’t mean it. Come on, help me apologize to him. He never fuckin’ listens to me.”

“Start by not hitting him!” Hawk shouted.

“I know, fuck. I’m such a fuck up.”

“Fuck you, Nine.”

“I know. Fuck me, just fuck me. I’m sorry, bro.” He laughed, slapped his friend’s ass, and hoisted him over his shoulders.

Hawk laughed and yelled. “No, Christ!”

“Come on, I guess,” said Nine to Nash and Bridger.

Nash looked at Bridger, who swallowed a lump in his throat and shrugged.

The house was vacant of furniture. A small fire burned in the fireplace, surrounded by blankets and pillows. Spike sat in the midst of them, reading a comic book by the light of the flickering flames.

“Hey, little man, I’m sorry, man.” Nine apologized. Plopping down behind him on the bedding, he encircled Spike in his strong arms.

“You hit me.”

“I know. Fuck me. I’m sorry.”

“Why’d you hit me?”

“Cause I was fucking scared for you.”

“I was with Hawk.”

“I know, man. I know.”

“Hawk knows how to keep me safe.”

“I know.” Nine squeezed his little brother to him. “Look, you wanna make Momma feel better?” Spike nodded and wiped a tear away. “Here.” He gave him the box with the drugs. The boy opened it and held up the blue vial.

Spike was upstairs with his mother for a long time. He returned, wiping tears from his eyes, and fell sobbing into the pillows.

“It’s no fair. It’s no fucking fair. Why does it have to be like this?”

Nine looked at Hawk and said, “Tomorrow, this Maji sings?”

Hawk nodded.

“Okay, we’ll be there. He better be for real.”",1,1740411469.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1ix4oih,https://www.reddit.com/r/wirelessearbudsreview/comments/1ix4oih/what_makes_the_best_true_wireless_earbuds_sony/,What makes the best true wireless earbuds? Sony WF1000XM5 review,"Testing the Sony WF1000XM5 earbuds has been an enlightening experience. As someone who spends hours listening to music or taking calls daily, I was genuinely curious about whether these would live up to their reputation. My verdict? They pack some serious punch but come with minor quirks you should know about.

**Fit & Comfort**

One of the first things I noticed was how snug these earbuds feel. Despite their relatively compact size, they fit securely without causing discomfort during extended wear. I’ve used them while jogging, working at my desk, and even during my daily commute. However, choosing the right ear tips is critical. The stock tips didn’t fit me perfectly, so I switched to third-party foam tips, which made a world of difference. Without the correct fit, you might miss out on noise cancellation and sound quality.

[Check Sony WF1000XM5 price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0cj144xk3/)

**Noise Cancellation & Ambient Mode**

The noise-cancellation feature on these earbuds is nothing short of phenomenal. I tested them on a noisy train ride, and they drowned out the chatter and hum of the engines effortlessly. The ambient mode is equally impressive, allowing external sounds—like announcements or conversations—to filter through without removing the earbuds. That said, the ambient mode occasionally feels a bit artificial, and there’s room for improvement in making it more natural.

**Battery Life & Charging**

Battery life is solid, offering about 8 hours on a single charge, with the case providing an additional 24 hours. Quick charging is a lifesaver; ten minutes in the case gave me roughly an hour and a half of playback. The wireless charging feature is convenient, especially if you own a Qi-compatible charging pad. Personally, I found myself relying on quick charges more often than I expected.

**Sound Quality & Performance**

The sound quality on these earbuds is stellar. I tested them across various genres—from classical to EDM—and they did not disappoint. The bass hits deep without overwhelming the mids and highs, creating a balanced listening experience. Streaming high-resolution audio via LDAC amplified the clarity, but it’s worth noting that LDAC requires a compatible device. While the soundstage is wide and immersive, I occasionally felt the midrange could use a touch more warmth.

**Design & Build Quality**

The minimalist design is both sleek and functional. The earbuds and case have a matte black finish that resists fingerprints, which is a blessing for someone like me who can’t stand smudges. However, the case feels somewhat lightweight and less premium than I’d like. Dropping it on a hard surface might not end well, so handle with care.

**Durability & Water Resistance**

An IPX4 rating means these earbuds can withstand sweat and light rain, making them ideal for workouts or quick outdoor runs. I wore them during a drizzle while walking my dog, and they worked perfectly fine afterward. However, they’re not meant for heavy rain or underwater use.

**Warranty**

Sony provides a standard 1-year warranty for these earbuds. While I haven’t had to use it yet, it’s reassuring to know that support is available should anything go wrong.

**Features**

The touch controls are intuitive, letting you adjust volume, skip tracks, or summon voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant with a simple tap or swipe. The adaptive sound control, which adjusts settings based on your location and activity, is a nifty feature. For instance, it switched to ambient mode automatically when I entered a coffee shop—a subtle but useful touch.

**Advantages**

* Excellent noise cancellation that blocks out most external sounds.
* Impressive sound quality with deep bass and clear highs.
* Seamless pairing with Bluetooth 5.2 and LDAC support.
* Compact, ergonomic design for a secure and comfortable fit.
* Long battery life coupled with quick charging capabilities.

**Disadvantages**

* Stock ear tips may not fit everyone perfectly.
* The ambient mode could feel more natural.
* The lightweight case doesn’t offer a premium feel.

**Competitive Options**

Comparing the Sony WF1000XM5 to AirPods Pro 2 and Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II, it’s clear that Sony excels in noise cancellation and sound customization. However, the AirPods Pro 2 offer smoother integration with iOS devices, while the Bose earbuds provide slightly better comfort for extended use. If sound quality and noise cancellation are your top priorities, Sony wins hands down. Still, for seamless ecosystem compatibility, you might lean toward Apple or Bose.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

While the price might initially seem steep, the feature set justifies the investment. The combination of stellar noise cancellation, high-quality sound, and convenient touch controls makes these earbuds a great choice for audiophiles and casual listeners alike. If you find them on sale, it’s an even better deal.

1ix4nrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ix4nrx/just_got_let_go_fresh_out_of_training/,"Just got let go, fresh out of training.","Just wrapped up my termination meet. I worked for a certain Hospital Corporation that's based in America. 

8 years with them and my old position was automated and I got displaced. To their credit, they allowed me 3 months to find a new department to continue my employment, but almost all applications would be auto-rejected within the day. Some 40 plus applications just never got to the hiring manager and when I brought that up to leadership, they just scratched their heads and would just.....not do anything about it.

The 3 month period had expired and they sent me to the department I had asked NOT to be moved into, specifically, under a particular micro manager I had experience with. 

3 month ramp up period sounded decent enough, until I looked through their training material. Garbage. Team lead who was assigned to train me, garbage. It was the most difficult job I had ever had, and I was in charge of optimizing work flow in an entire Amazon Outbound facility. This place convinced me I was stupid and stressed me out. I was so stressed, my memory got shot. My memory retention got so bad, I thought I was sick. Like, cancer type of sick. But I started to think about my YouTube channel and pondered about the monetization process and turns out I'm closer to qualifying for monetization than I had expected (4000 view hours over the last 365 days. I'm at 3000 hours now).

A small group of friends, my wife, and I talked a bit about a YouTube concept and I was gonna construct a business plan for it, equipment needed for it, and to shoot a couple of pilot concepts to get feedback from friends and strangers. Now that my job told me how I was not being productive during my training period, I guess I have time to get to work on this YouTube route. Just gotta get those extra 1000 hours and I'll submit my application to be a YT partner.

It's a dreary Monday morning and while it's nice to romanticize the quiet moments with a cup of coffee, it would be made perfect by chatting with someone.

I'm E, a plus sized mega nerd with a lot of opinions about my passions! Some of which include:

Dungeons & Dragons: I'm a pro DM and have been running games for two years! I could talk about it for 14hr straight so if you start this conversation, know what you signed up for lol.

Video Games: I've been a fan of Pokemon since 2nd grade and still play to this day! Right now I'm starting Avowed but haven't gotten very far. Cozy games, action/adventure and rpg are my main games of choice but I'm down to try anything once! Okami is my favorite game of all time.

Animals: big animal lover! I have two cats currently and grew up around lots of different animals. Dogs, cats, horses, goats, turtles, snakes, and I even had a ferret once! Send me all your pet pics!!

Reading & Writing: I love a good book. Audiobooks have really helped me get back my love of reading, and I'm always up for book suggestions! I mainly stick to fiction, but I read a couple memoirs last year I really enjoyed. I'm an aspiring author and currently writing spicy content (that's what is popular rn) so if you're not cool with that, you know ahead of time.

Political: Conservatives need not apply. I'm very liberal and obviously part of the alphabet mafia (LGBTQIA+), of which you should at MINIMUM be an ally.

Other: I'm child free and never plan to have any. I am not against folks who have kids.
I like hiking and nature, museums and coffee dates, thrifting and jamming out in the car, dressing up and exploring new cuisines, movies and concerts. Not a big sports fan but I dont mind if you are!

I'm looking for another hopeless romantic like myself. A hype person who enjoys giving and receiving compliments. I am relatively vanilla, enjoying a more sensual kind of intimacy. I am not your manic pixie dream girl. I am your emotionally mature, in therapy, medicated, long term relationship woman. I'd really like if my next partner has a physical touch love language!

In terms of attraction, I have a wide range that I'm attracted to but I mostly find myself drawn toward masculine styles. Tattoos & piercings are a huge plus (painted nails + wrist watch just does something to me 😩). Age range is 29-37, I have my reasons.

Here is what I look like:

I would usually create a new account with some of my photos the same. There is this 1 guy, we have matched 3 times now. Each time he would swipe right first and always initiate the first message. Many times the conversation dies off. Last time he asked for my number and coffee, never falls through - this was a month ago. I just got back in the app again, here he is again that swiped right.

But I am curious as to why he continues to swipe right? Does guys don’t remember who they match with?

This morning we stopped for coffee and a local asked what we were up to and when we told him he said you can absolutely drive the coast down. 

Anyone have any insight into this? Can we drive the coast from Tamarindo down? It seems way more direct anyway? Don’t want to end up lost or stuck though.

1ix4hh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/FearFics/comments/1ix4hh7/ooze_of_the_heart_pt1/,Ooze of the Heart (pt1),"""Cupid? And that's your real name?"" Hedge Rayland asked his newest patient, Devlin Cupid, a newly married man age 24, Tall, Average build, curly red hair, and seeking help with self-control. At least that's what it said on his patient application form he filled out a week prior.

Chuckling Devlin responded ""Yeah, it's real. I get that a lot. People just think I'm messing with em' given the hair and all."" He looked down at the oak coffee table at a half-drank cup of coffee that separated the two men as he finished his sentence.

Dr. Rayland's office had a warm venerable aspect to it, from the Victorian-style furniture to the posh lighting fixtures adorning the burgundy and emerald walls. Seeming out of time for the modern 1980s world they lived in. Rayland looked a man far out of his own age, only 33 he carried himself very properly with combed-back brown hair and a tidy mustache, a vest with a black blazer and an antique pipe he would puff on occasionally throughout his appointments. However the addition of Rayland's light Bostonian accent made for a contrasting persona, the voice not matching the face and all that. Devlin didn't quite know what to make of the man. 

""A fine name son, no worries of it, now what I like to do for first appointments is break the ice a little. I tell you something about me, you tell me something about you, so on and so forth. For instance, crosswords, I adore a good crossword in the morning, really gets the brain moving, y'know what I mean?"" Hedge said, giving Devlin a calming gaze, sitting in anticipation. 

Nothing, Devlin just sat there giving a blank-faced open mouth stare at the Dr.

With a wide-eyed grimace, Rayland leaned forward and gave a gesture of ""Okay now you go"" 

The red haired man's gears finally started cranking as he fumbled with his words ""Oh ugh yeah, I ugh, football, I like watching football"" 

""Ah, football very nice! A big sports fan!"" Rayland exclaimed, internally thinking ""Wow this guy is the real deal, a true bonafide dullard""

""Okay so you're a sports guy, I'm a words guy. How about you tell me what you do for work?"" Rayland inquired not wanting to drag this appointment out longer than he needed.

""I work down at Hemms, you know the chemical disposal plant near the Commonwealth flats, I ugh. Well you know I take out the old barrels and ugh. I put em in the trucks and the guys, they ugh they take em away."" Devlin stuttered out

""Oh disposal work, keeping the earth clean, very noble work my friend"" Rayland kept a very professional front but could not get this over with faster, he had spent the night prior with a slim, dark hair 25 year old he met down at Muse. Up until 3am, barely a drop of sleep and a hangover that could put a bear into early hibernation.

Wanting to get on with the appointment Rayland asks ""So I see you're having issues with impulse control? What exactly are these impulses of yours?""

Nervously Devlin responds ""Well you see doc, I ugh. Now haha now this is gonna sound just so out there, but it's about my ugh. My wife ya see."" Devlin pauses

""Your wife? Is there some kind of overzealousness you have with your wife in a sexual manner? You know that's pretty normal for newlyweds Mr. Cupid."" Rayland rebutted 

""Oh no no haha no it's nothing like that at all doc, I ugh ha we don't exactly do that"" visible uncomfortable Devlin adjusts himself in his chair.

""Hmm okay well what is it then?"" Rayland becoming more impatient with every interaction with Devlin and he fears his frustration is starting to show.

""Well you see, I want to kill my wife."" Devlin stated in a cool and collected time ""I want to cut her open and pull her heart right out of her chest."" The man's tone changed on a dime.

A chill runs up Rayland's spine as he stares at the coffee cup in front of him, wide-eyed, not quite sure if he should make eye contact, he just lets Devlin continue.

""I just love her so much doctor, I can't stand to see anyone even look at her, I want to take her away from this gawking world. Take her heart and put it in my pocket."" Devlin says, grasping at something invisible with his hand.

Finally looking up to the man Rayland finds his cold gray eyes staring directly at him. Another chill runs up his spine and into his head, rattling his brain with a shiver. A primeval desire to get the hell out of this room right now almost overtakes him. 

""N-now, why would you want to go and do that, Devlin?"" Stammered Rayland.

""Mr. Cupid if you don't mind, doctor."" Devlin stated plainly

""Oh, ugh, of course, sorry Mr. Cupid."" it seemed Rayland had the roles reversed on him and he felt like the scared bumbling idiot now. 

""Didn't you hear me before doctor? I love her."" A smirk crept up on Devlin's face as he spoke.

""That's what I'm not understanding here. Mr. Cupid, if you loved her, well why on earth would you want to take her life?"" Questioned Rayland.

""Wouldn't you do anything for the ones you love, doctor? She made vows to me, not to this vile world, not to these sick people. To me. I need to take her away from it all before it's too late.""
Again another overwhelming urge to flee washed over Rayland, fighting it back with all his will he sat planted and tried to keep his composure.

""But, why tell me any of this?"" Not knowing if he wanted the answer to that question or not

""Well, cause you killed your wife too, Dr. Wayland. Isn't that right?"" Asked Devlin ""You smothered her to death in her sleep, you're just like me"" giving a devilish grin.

""DONG"" The antique clock rang off signaling an end to the appointment.

""Well, that's our time!"" Rayland shot up and quickly hurried to rush Devlin out of the door.

""Oh, uh, oh already doc?"" Devlin's previous demeanor returned as the act of Rayland grabbing and rushing the man out.

""I am afraid so lad, all the time we have today"" hastened Rayland. 

""Oh uh, okay doc I uh I guess same time next week huh?"" Asked Devlin.

""Yes yes lad, same time, best be off now."" Rayland rushed 

""Okay bye d...."" Rayland slammed the door on Devlin before he could finish his sentence.

Turning quick the doctor rushed over to his cupboard and poured a stiff glass of gin, dowing the floral liquor Rayland took a deep gasping breath ""Fucking madman, crazy fucking psychotic madman!"" 

""You smothered your wife in her sleep."" The words rang in his mind. 
""Did I hear him right? Rayland? No Wayland!"" Rayland shouted. ""He got me confused for Duluth Wayland!"" Another practicing therapist Wayland had been in the news recently but only by name. Remembering the still active case from earlier in the year, the police suspected murder and Wayland was high up in the list of possible suspects.  

""I just got roped into some maniac's murderous delusion over mistaken identity!!!"" Rayland bent over with the anticipation of vomiting. 

""BZZZZZ!!"" The buzzer to Rayland's office went off and the door swung open, Chelsea Valenta, Rayland's 24 year old receptionist. Chelsea had been working for Rayland for the better part of three years now screening clients and collecting payments. She came marching in over to Rayland with a deeply concerned look on her pale face, her blue eyes peeking through her soft blonde hair with worry. 

""Okay that guy, what the hell is up with him? He just walked past and gave me the craziest stare down I've ever seen."" She said in a whispered yell.

""I need you to get the police on the line now, that guy can't be allowed to go home to his wife."" Rayland said, adjusting his coat in an attempt to compose himself. 

________________________________________________

""His wife?"" The Boston police officer asked 

""Yes, he said he wanted to cut her open!  I really don't think we should take a chance with this guy."" Rayland said as he poured himself another glass of gin

""And he just up and told you all this, for no reason?"" Questioned the officer 

""No, I think he thought I was Duluth Wayland, similar names, same job. I think he just got me confused with that guy and he thought I would relate to him?"" Rayland knew how it sounded and could tell he wasn't exactly getting through to the cop in front of him.

""Look, can you just go and check up on him? Make sure nothing is going on?"" Rayland pleaded 

""As soon as you called in we went to the guy's apartment but no one was home, we'll try his work tomorrow to see if we can catch him there and take him in for evaluation. You said the Hemms plant right?"" The officer gave a reassuring gesture to the disheveled man.

""Yes that's correct, just please find this guy. In all my years I've never seen a man so resolute in his own bullshit."" Rayland said, speaking through lighting his pipe.

""We'll be on it, Doc. I promise. Look you've had a rough day, just go home and try to get some rest, we'll keep you updated okay?"" The cop put his coat back on and slipped out of the office. 

""Yes, very good, thank you officer. I'll be hearing from you"" Rayland waved the cop off and closed up his office for the night. Laying in bed after nearly a whole bottle of 80 proof gin, Rayland tossed and turned trying to get some shut eye but knew none would come to him this night, or any night soon. His hands trembled by the day's happenings and opted to do some late night reading. He decided to finally finish off Lightning by Dean Koontz, he'd been a sucker for a good horror novel since he was a boy growing up in midtown. They had an oddly soothing effect on him, often sending him off to his own dream world before he could finish a chapter. Tonight was no different, a mere 10 words away from the chapter's end Hedge Rayland was in a restless slumber.

1ix4gqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcrimore/comments/1ix4gqb/off_the_air/,Off the air,"Hello, my loves. I have another tale for you.

Here at the station, there is one true dread: overtime. No one likes it. Who would? You get to work at 8 AM, you survive the long hours, the stale coffee, the hum of the fluorescents, and by the time night falls, you should be free. But no—sometimes, the hours stretch on, and before you know it, the clock reads 10 PM, then 3 AM, and you’re still there. Still breathing in the stale, recycled air.

Still trapped.

Our office is an old building with a new face. If you’ve ever played Resident Evil or House of the Dead, you know the kind of place. If not, imagine this: a towering structure, isolated, looming over the streets like it was built to keep something in. It was meant to be an aristocrat’s manor once, back when wealth meant something tangible—stone and wood and iron gates—but that was before it became a sanitarium.

Before it became something worse.

The Radcliffe Psychiatric Institute for the Insane opened its doors in 1861 and closed them just as quickly. The patients revolted, the building burned, and no one made it out. No one except five staff members, who vanished not long after. The building stood empty for decades, the kind of empty that doesn’t truly mean vacant.

Then it became KCRP radio.

And now it’s mine.

I work the late shifts, but I don’t mind. Management is always there—he’s always there. Unlike the others, I feel safe with him around.

Usually.

But Tuesday was different.

The night started like any other. Coffee, an energy drink to keep me sharp, and a quick hug for Rhys, my Program Controller. His skin was always cold—not in a way that felt wrong, just… different. A pleasant kind of cold, the kind that keeps you grounded.

We were going through pre-show checks when the vacuum tube system clattered to life. A single slip of paper dropped into the tray. Management’s handwriting.

“Out. Handling an issue. Keep the station running.”

He never used modern tech. And he never left for long.

But that night, he was gone for three hours.

By the time the show ended, I was expecting some kind of response to my usual jab at him. A growl from the vents, a deep thud that rattled the walls. Something.

But there was nothing.

Rhys and I packed up, heading toward the exit, when we spotted Melissa, one of the night cleaners. The halls were… quiet. Not office-quiet, wrong quiet. The kind of silence that presses in, waiting for something to break it.

At 5 AM, there should have been movement—shift changes, tired greetings. But there was no one.

No one but Melissa.

And Sara.

“Shit, I left my ID,” Rhys muttered as we reached the doors.

To enter or exit the building, you need to scan your ID. Without it, you’re stuck. He turned back.

“Go ahead, I’ll be right behind you.”

I waited. Thirty minutes.

Rhys didn’t come back.

I went looking.

The studio was empty. The halls wrong. The air felt thick, charged, like walking into a room where someone had been screaming just moments before.

“Better check the break room.”

That’s when I saw it.

Standing in the emergency lights—now a dull, pulsing red—was something that wasn’t human.

A black, shifting mass, its form barely holding shape, its edges flickering like a dying film reel. And within it, faces—twisting, screaming, stretched impossibly wide before dissolving into the darkness.

Sara stood frozen in place. She didn’t run. Didn’t scream. Just stood there, shaking, lips moving in silent prayer as the thing enveloped her.

It didn’t kill her.

It took her.

Swallowed her whole, her body twisting as she was pulled into the writhing dark, until her face was just another in the mass.

I turned and ran.

I tripped—something wet. A leg.

Melissa. Or what was left of her.

The thing shifted, noticing me for the first time. And as it slithered over Melissa’s remains, something awful happened—her body convulsed, her mouth opened, and she started to scream.

I ran.

I don’t remember how I got to the intern’s hallway. I don’t remember how I started pounding on the locked door, screaming for them to open up.

Josh shoved it open just as something dark and wet and wrong slammed into him, sending him sprawling.

Rhys was running—his limp heavy, his eyes wide—and the thing took him down.

I don’t remember making it to the attic, but I did. The only place left. The only chance. The old iron gate was there—the one that Management never let us touch.

I tore it open.

Eddie—poor Eddie—didn’t make it. He stayed back, buying us time.

The thing got him.

And then it cut the rope.

The iron gate slammed shut.

The darkness pressed in.

Rhys screamed. It had him. Legs first, pulling him down, the tendrils twisting through his skin like veins turned inside-out.

A tendril snapped around my wrist, and I felt it. Not just on my skin—inside. Digging. Hollowing. Consuming.

I was slipping.

Then, just as my vision blurred—

A shadow.

A voice.

“There it is.”

And then—

Nothing.

I woke up three days later. At home. My arm burned, a twisting, jagged scar running from wrist to elbow.

Management messaged me. Texted me, of all things.

“You have a week off for your transgressions.”

No explanation. No answers. Just that.

When I returned, Rhys was in his booth.

“Thank the Old Ones you’re okay,” he said, voice rough, tired. “Management just said you were resting.”

He grabbed a crutch and pulled me into a hug. His skin was still cold.

His leg was gone.

The same leg the creature had started to devour.

“I guess Management made a deal,” he murmured laughing.

I turned to him, to his tired eyes, his too-calm smile. As I was leaving. 

I didn’t say anything. Just walked to the break room, the scent of coffee grounding me.

And that’s when I saw it.

The memoriam board.

Eddie.

Sara.

Melissa.

I’ve literally spooned her for hours before and I want the same treatment. I can’t even kiss her or put my face on her because my “facial hair is too poky” and she won’t use her words she’ll just abruptly shove my face or arm off of her and it hurts my feelings. Often she would roll over and read web comics and frequently she’ll have a tone with me when I interrupt her, and the tone will be like I’m the fucking scum of the Earth for interrupting her and I’ve tried bringing this up. She  said she doesn’t have a tone. She just acts helpless and expects me to constantly take car of her, a frequent interaction we have is “im hungry” and if I don’t feed her she will just sit there getting more pissed off at the fact she’s hungry till i fix it.

It's a dreary Monday morning and while it's nice to romanticize the quiet moments with a cup of coffee, it would be made perfect by chatting with someone.

I'm E, a plus sized mega nerd with a lot of opinions about my passions! Some of which include:

Dungeons & Dragons: I'm a pro DM and have been running paid games for two years! I could talk about it for 14hr straight so if you start this conversation, know what you signed up for lol.

Video Games: I've been a fan of Pokemon since 2nd grade and still play to this day! Right now I'm starting Avowed but haven't gotten very far. Cozy games, action/adventure and rpg are my main games of choice but I'm down to try anything once! Okami is my favorite game of all time.

Animals: big animal lover! I have two cats currently and grew up around lots of different animals. Dogs, cats, horses, goats, turtles, snakes, and I even had a ferret once! Send me all your pet pics!!

Reading & Writing: I love a good book. Audiobooks have really helped me get back my love of reading, and I'm always up for book suggestions! I mainly stick to fiction, but I read a couple memoirs last year I really enjoyed. I'm an aspiring author and currently writing smut content (that's where the money's at) so if you're not cool with that, you know ahead of time.

Political: Conservatives need not apply. I'm very liberal and obviously part of the alphabet mafia (LGBTQIA+), of which you should at MINIMUM be an ally.

Other: I'm child free and never plan to have any.
I like hiking and nature, museums and coffee dates, thrifting and jamming out in the car, dressing up and exploring new cuisines, movies and concerts. Not a big sports fan but I dont mind if you are!

I'm looking for another hopeless romantic like myself. A hype person who enjoys giving and receiving compliments. I am relatively vanilla, enjoying a more sensual kind of intimacy than a kinky one. I am not your manic pixie dream girl. I am your emotionally mature, in therapy, medicated, long term relationship woman. I do want to get married one day, I want to be someone's wife. My love languages are acts of service, words of affirmation, ans gift giving. I'd really like if my next partner has a physical touch love language!

In terms of attraction, I have a wide range that I'm attracted to but I mostly find myself drawn toward masculine styles. Tattoos & piercings are a huge plus (painted nails + wrist watch just does something to me 😩). Age range is 29-37, I have my reasons.

Here is what I look like:

Summary:
I keep feeling bad ( mentally ) and with diagnosis of subclinical hypothyrodisme, migraines, generalised anxiety and treatment of all I am not sure what is cause or result anymore.

1. 4 years ago I randomly started feeling like shit, so I visited a Doctor. I got an bloodtest done and echo.
My TSH was 5,9 and they found Diffusely distributed hypoechoic nodules. They concluded I probably had a inflamed thyroid and all would be well soon

2. Kept feeling like shit, so went to a psychologist. They concluded generalised anxiety. Had treatment for 2 years which kinda went fine but I remained stuck with a random bad feeling without cause like something was wrong

3. random blood test done, showed my TSH was 5,4 and a trial with levo was suggested. I started feeling a lot better for couple of months. Until it constantly felt like I had 8 cups of coffee.

4. Lowered back the dose, to 37,5. But started feeling worse again for 2 months. So went back up again to 50 levo, but never got back the good feeling of the first time I was taking 50.

5. All this time I'Ve also been suffering from migraines, and received sumatriptan for treatment. And I had to take it last weekend and the day after I just felt awe full. Full blown anxiety. And a little research showed me this was associated with migraine prodrome, and also a possible side effect of sumatriptan.

I am now 4 days further and the feeling still remains/ was also already there to start with . I ve already decided to quit alcohol as it seems to be a migraine trigger. But I am not quite sure anymore what is and what isn't the cause of the shitty feeling.

## What ⁤to Consider When ⁤Choosing a Collapsible Water Filter Bottle

Selecting the **best collapsible water filter bottle** ⁣involves considering several factors to ensure it meets your specific needs. Here are ​some key aspects to‌ evaluate:

*   **Filtration⁣ Technology:** ‍Different bottles employ various filtration methods, including activated carbon, hollow fiber membranes, and chemical treatments.

Look⁢ for ‌bottles that meet or ⁤exceed​ NSF standards for water filtration.

*​   **Filtration Capacity and‌ Flow Rate:** Filtration capacity refers‌ to the amount of water the filter can purify before⁤ needing replacement. Flow rate determines how quickly⁤ water​ passes through the filter. Balance filtration capacity (especially for long trips) with your need for the immediate ability to drink quickly. ⁤It is ‍important to find a balance ‌of ​filtration capacity⁢ and​ flow rate to best fit your usage needs.

*   **Bottle ‌Material and Durability:** Opt ‌for bottles made‌ from durable, BPA-free materials that can withstand the rigors of ⁤outdoor use ⁤or ⁢frequent travel. Look for high-quality plastics or silicone that are resistant to punctures ‍and ⁢tears.

*   ⁣**Price:** **Collapsible water filter bottles** ‌range⁢ in price, so set a‍ budget and ‍compare features within your price range. While a higher price doesn't always ⁢guarantee better quality, investing in ‌a ⁣reputable‍ brand with ‍positive reviews is often a smart move.

Time and location is all I need and these guys can’t even do that. I don’t even expect the guy to pay! 

I stopped planning first dates about 6-7 months ago. I’m on Bumble and found a lot of guys were just expecting me to put in all the mental load. I got tired of it and have started saying “what did you have in mind” when they pick a day for the first date. The number of guys who will say “we can play it by ear” or “it’s whatever” is INSANE! “Hey, there is a coffee shop on x street. What time are you free?” It’s really not that hard! 

“Why not just do if it’s not that hard?” Because I don’t want to get stuck planning 100% of dates. I don’t think either person should get stuck doing it all the time but my rule is the guy must plan the first date or I’m not going. It’s been an awesome way to weed out guys who don’t put in any effort. 

I get guys are tired for paying for dates but even a park date with some coffee / tea / whatever is fine! Hell! Just say you’ll both meet at a location and no money needs to be spent or you grab orders separately. I don’t want guys to think they have to pay but just put an ounce of work into the date.

background: SUPER small town. i dated this guy for a year in 2022, dumped him, his mom worked with me and hated me for it, made life terrible for leaving her terrible son and often talked to this cop about me telling him lies to get him on me. 

she has his number as well and i know they still talk to this day because last weekend this cop mentioned speaking with her very recently to my coworker who knows her too but not me. 

last year, this cop comes to my apartment when i attempt to commit suicide and he’s the one to take the call and he’s allowed to go inside my house to “look around” while the ambulance took me away. i felt so sick and violated knowing HE was there when i was trying to take my life already but oh well i just had to suck it up :D

anyways, he’s been coming in to my work frequently since my ex’s mom quit there. 
if i show up late, he says “why were you late? i know you live right down the road.” and lately i’ve been purposely showing up later than when he comes in because i refuse to serve him and i’m the only server on the floor so i HAVE to if i’m there. 

i also go by a nickname at my waitress job for privacy reasons. most of my coworkers (but ALL CUSTOMERS) only know me by this name so when my coworker was referring to me around him, he chimed in to say “i don’t know a ******? who’s ******? that’s not her real name. i know her real name.” and technically the only reason he should know my real name is because he saw my ID when i attempted suicide. congratulations? 

NOW he’s even coming in on his off days from being a cop :D he came in, sat around FOREVER and poked more fun about knowing where i live and kept talking about my name thing in front of everyone and what happens conveniently THE NEXT DAY? i see him in his little police truck driving around my apartment building in particular 🥰 the cops will drive down the apartments main road maybe once a week for safety, but my lovely cop friend made a special effort to see my building and my boyfriend saw him on his way inside :)

i was diagnosed with ptsd after my visit to the psych ward last year for that attempt and admit i still struggle so much because a lot of my trauma is around law enforcement and now i have this guy trying to watch me like a hawk. my hands will violently shake when he’s in the restaurant to the point i can’t write orders or pour anyone coffee. 

i can only afford to work within this short range of my apartment too so i couldn’t up and leave even if i wanted to and it’s very frustrating and adding to my diagnosis 💔",2,1740409420.0,venting,1,1.0,False

Job questions surface pretty regularly here so I figured this could be interesting to a few people. I am not on reddit 24/7 so my answers might be slow to come from time to time. That being said, I plan on leaving that AMA open as long as interesting questions come in.

Another quick disclaimer, english is my second language! Sorry if stuff I write here sounds weird... bear with me, I've only had two cups of coffee so far today!

Now a bit about me and why I think I have something to bring to this topic. I have been a scrum master for a few years for a medium sized software company. As is the case in a lot of organization, that company does not know how to handle a team of scrum masters so they decided to create a department around continuous improvement and I ended up playing the role of ""manager"" for our scrum master team. What does that mean? It means that I am the one in charge or hiring them, coaching them, doing their performance review, helping them achieve their goals and further their career, etc etc etc. (I am willing to answer more question about my role or the structure of our scrum master team in this AMA too.). My team has been pretty stable the past few years so I have only had to hire one scrum master recently but I am in the middle of a reflection with my boss with regards to the structure and making of my team which might lead to new hires in the next few months.

I am myself also a scrum master with a scrum team within the organisation. I hold the PSM I, PSM II, PSPO I, SPS, PAL-E and PSK certifications from [scrum.org](https://scrum.org/).

A last final disclaimer : I do not claim to hold ""the truth"" and what I will express here are just my personnal experiences and views in the hope that it helps a few people.

1ix421n,https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1ix421n/c7_coffee_factory_and_building_purchasing_issues/,C7 Coffee factory and building purchasing issues,"Hey there! I searched the sub and google (and the Civ 7 issue tracker) to make sure this wasn't already talked about. After submitting tickets I thought I would share in case anyone has any insight that I overlooked or well... as a warning while you play.

These are two important issues in my book, particularly the second one.  
\-Coffee factories don't seem to work  
\-Purchasing an almost complete building charges you full price!

I noticed these issues during multiplayer, but went back after the game ended to an autosave, kicked the other human, and began testing. (diety diff, if it matters)

**Issue 1- Coffee factory**  
  
Coffee is suppose to give +5% production to buildings/wonders. However it doesn't appear to actually work. I stacked +35% production on a factory and no buildings/wonders wound up with less turns to complete. This includes unqueue'ing the building, closing/reopening cities, etc, etc. I also ended turns during the original play- all other factory things I slotted seem to have an effect you could see just by closing the menu (growth, culture, science, happiness). Just production is messed.

[Radio time using 7 coffee at 8 turns.](https://preview.redd.it/hia72at9n3le1.png?width=3282&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b02829a37aa19cb7fa8959db32c156db6d27d40)

Note the production value of 53 in the city. I don't expect it to change on that menu because the bonus only applies to specific things (buildings/wonders). However I do expect that functionally I should have about 71 production for the purpose of building that radio station (about 34% more than 53).

For comparison I took out all the coffee and slotted a single whale (+6 production). This increases all production in that city to 59 (about an 11% increase). This also reduces the time it takes to complete the radio station by 1 turn.

[Radio time using 1 whale at 7 turns.](https://preview.redd.it/1rnb49i9o3le1.png?width=2524&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fdced7ff723fd67939aea318347ec47187ba7ed)

So for whatever reason coffee doesn't seem to be actually functioning. At least during the mp game it didn't work, and in my testing after when I switched it to single player- also didn't work.  


**Issue 2- purchasing production**

When having a building close to completion if you go to the purchase menu and remove the building from the queue, you have the option to purchase it for the gold value of the remaining production. In my example for the Rail Station it is 204 gold to buy. However notice that my gold goes from +1037 to -82. This is the full price of the rail station. This happened multiple times- didn't matter the building. I didn't notice it until the modern era because that is when I was doing it more, however I have to assume that the couple times I went negative during Exploration when I thought I had more money- it was because of this.

[Ouch!](https://preview.redd.it/3u3s35bnp3le1.png?width=2344&format=png&auto=webp&s=23c299066b754457cd58570fe4e6418a518da49d)

If you haven't run into this issue, I'd like to know. Maybe it was something introduced more recently. Hopefully this saves anyone banging their head (unless it's to heavy metal) over missing gold, etc, until it is fixed (and as mentioned I already submitted bugs).",4,1740409339.0,civ,3,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ix3uaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ix3uaj/trip_report_egypt_feb_2025/,Trip Report | Egypt | Feb 2025,"My wife and I visited Egypt in February 2025. We flew in Hurghada on Feb 5th and flew out of Sharm-el-Sheikh on Feb 17th. It was in total 13 days. 

Since I read a lot about Egypt on Reddit, this article is a way of giving back to the community. I will share our itinerary, how we managed everything, and advices I got from my experience and from locals. Hope this will be useful for many!

# TL;DR

After visiting many countries across Europe, Asia, North Africa, and North America, Egypt was the best trip we had so far. I know this might surprise many of you but Egypt met all of our interests: history, culture, food, and beautiful coasts along the deep blue Red Sea! 

Since the country is surrounded by desert, it doesn't have beautiful mountains with lush greenery. But this was absolutely fine given what we experienced throughout the country.

# Itinerary

* **Feb 5th - 6th | Hurghada**: We flew into Hurghada. Stayed there for 2 nights. On the second day, we had a day trip to the beautiful Orange Bay with snorkeling and water sports. Unfortunately, it got cancelled due to windy weather. Yes the weather on that day was a chilly all day long (around 19 degrees at peak) but it was still very sunny.
* **Feb 7th - 9th | Luxor**: From Hurghada, we took [Go Bus](https://go-bus.com/) to travel to Luxor. I bought tickets online and it was very seamless. On the next two days in Luxor, we had two guided tours on the west and the east bank consecutively. We also took the balloon ride over the west bank. It was a pleasant experience indeed!
* **Feb 10th - 11th | Aswan**: On 10th Feb, we took a guided trip from Luxor to Aswan. The purpose was to visit Edfu and Kom Ombo temples on the way and drop off our hotel in Aswan. The next day on 11th, we took a day trip to Abu Simbel temple. In the evening, we visited the Old Souq in Aswan.
* **Feb 12th - 14th** **| Cairo**: From Aswan, we flew to Cairo on 12th. The following two days were two fantastic trips: one in Giza, another in Islamic, Old and Coptic Cairo. At night, we also walked around the famous Khan-el-Khalili bazaar and adjacent mosques. It was a Friday and the whole area was buzzing with colours, lights, and life!
* **Feb 15th - 16th | Sharm-el-Sheikh**: We took another flight from Cairo to Sharm on Feb 15th. The next day we had a full-day trip to Dahab and the majestic Colored Canyon. We also did snorkeling in the Gulf of Aqaba, which was a bit difficult due to the strong waves! Thanks to the guide who literally took us over the reef. At night, we visited the Old Market and the very interesting Al-Sahaba Mosque.
* **Feb 17th | Return:** Finally, we flew back on 17th. I realised I was feeling a bit sad when we were ready to leave for the airport. A rare feeling, but I totally get why! :')

# Visa

Egypt requires many nationalities to take on-arrival visa in the airport. In the Hurghada airport, there were counters of various tour agencies and there were also counters of banks. 

Guess what, banks are the original counters from where you take the visa unless I guess you travel with a tour agency. Go straight to the bank counter, give 25 USD (gave in cash), and take the ""visa fee"" sticker. I suspect the agencies charge a bit more, which is why some people had to pay 30 USD or more.

You also need to fill up a small form with your details like name, passport number, accommodation. This form are free of charge. Take them from the tour agency counters. Also, the immigration counters have them.

There was a guy calling the name of our flight to drive all the passengers to the agency counters! 😂 Just ignore him!

Note that according to on-arrival visa rule, you are also eligible for it if you have a visa of countries like US, UK, Schengen, etc.

# Register within 7 Days

Not applicable for everyone, but there is a rule where some nationalities, even if they are eligible for on-arrival visa, have to register within 7 days upon entering the country. In such a case, the immigration office gives a seal on your passport. 

It might feel like a problem, but all you need to do is to go to the nearest Passport and Immigration Office and get another seal. It's a rule so people who get the seal will have to abide by. Otherwise, you will be charged a fine upon leaving Egypt.

# SIM Cards

We got Orange and WE SIM cards from the airport. They cost 5 and 6 euro respectively for 10 GB data for a month. I think it's more expensive compared to buying a SIM from the city. But I preferred buying it from the the airport because we landed in the afternoon and didn't want to go around for buying SIM card.

Orange gets activated immediately and the lady did it for us. WE activates automatically but takes 1 hour or more. It took more than 1 hour for me before I could see the network sign. I think buying Orange is probably better if this bothers you.

# Accommodation and Food

Accommodation in Egypt is significantly cheap. You get 5 star hotels at the same price of a typical 3 star hotel in touristic cities in Europe! Similarly, the food is extremely delicious and also very cheap. Having a full meal for two in a good and highly rated restaurant took less than 15 euro at most, and frequently less.

# Transportation

We used bus, flight, and taxis in Egypt. Didn't take any trains.

* We found Go Bus decent. Not super clean or tidy, but we didn't really care. The driver was good, no hard breaks or so. It was easy to buy tickets online.
* We took flights with Nesma Airlines. Pretty standard flights, nothing different compared to an EasyJet flight in Europe.
* Taxis are everywhere in Egypt. But we didn't pin down taxis from the side of a road to avoid annoying bargaining. Every time we needed taxis, we used one of Careem, Uber, or InDrive. InDrive is probably less known to tourists, but it was the most useful one! We always found drivers whenever we needed on InDrive, while Careem and Uber had scarcity of drivers a few times. Only caveat is that InDrive has an auctioning system where you propose a fair and drivers propose counter offers. But it was not an issue.
* We took airport transfers. But it's not really needed if you can use Careem, Uber, or InDrive.

# Tours

We took guided tours to the historical places, and visited some mosques and souqs on our own. Generally, we do travel on our own, unless we figure a guided tour is necessary. And my recommendation for Egypt is to *take guided tours*. 

Every guide we met were *very* knowledgeable. They had bachelors, masters, and even PhD on tourism, antiquities, and had professional training as well as licenses for working as tour guides. I asked them a lot of questions and all of them were very patient to answer my questions thoroughly. They seemed to enjoy their job a lot! I even asked this question whether they enjoyed what they were doing, and all of them replied with a resounding yes!

And all the guides were fantastic! This is their job and they care a lot about their reviews. Looking back, I am very happy that we took the guided tours. It helped us learn a lot not only about the history of Egypt but also its culture, food, its people and their daily life.

I booked all the guided tours on GetYourGuide. I later noticed Booking\[dot\]com had lower prices for the same tours, but not completely certain about it. It's better to check for yourself and make sure the ratings are good.

# Tickets

All the tickets of all the monuments we visited could be bought online [here](https://egymonuments.com/). You can avoid queuing simply by buying the tickets online. No need to take guide's help or ask the tour company to arrange it.

On our trip to Edfu and Kom Ombo, I bought tickets online but for the wrong date. I thought I would have to buy tickets again, but in both places, someone from the ticket office contacted their Cairo office to manually fix the date of the tickets in their database! Having our guide with us definitely helped because they were not English speakers. But I really liked the gesture. And no, those people in the ticket offices didn't ask for tips.

# Food

Egyptian food was very delicious and I personally loved Egyptian bread! I recommend going to local restaurants with high rating on Google Maps (very easy to find). 

Note that some of the guided tours we took had lunch included. Surprisingly, those lunches were pretty bad. But every time we ate on our own finding Egyptian restaurants, the food was just fantastic.

# Tipping

Tipping is a culture in Egypt and I generously tipped. Egypt had a large population of poor people and many working long hours just to manage food and shelter.

In our 13 days of being in this country, only thrice someone asked for tip: one time when a guy handled our luggage in the bus, second time in a mosque, and third time a kid after I got off the camel he took me on a ride with. Tipping 10/20 EGP in such cases were just fine. But you can always give a lot more, or just ignore.

When you use an app to call the taxi, it felt the drivers were not expecting tips, and when I did tip them, their faces lighted up every single time.

For guides, I tipped them based on my satisfaction. If I liked someone a lot, I even tipped 500 EGP. 

Bottomline, never in a single occasion someone was adamant about tipping. If you don't feel like it, just ignore and walk away. I think one time it happened where some guy said to give him a tip, and I pretended not to hear and walked away. I didn't have a meaningful interaction with him to tip, so I didn't bother.

# Bargaining

Bargaining is a culture in Egypt, and across many countries all over the world. This is where sellers in Egypt try to get as much profit as possible from a tourist. And reading Reddit, I realised this is one of the reasons why tourists, specially from the western world, feel dissatisfied with Egypt.

We haggled prices in Aswan Old Souq. The rule we followed was easy:

* You ask for the price, and counter it with 1/3rd.
* If what you offered was ridiculous, they will immediately react and pretend to be annoyed.
* Just leave that shop and go to another one. This time, you know offering 1/3rd is likely ridiculous, so up the offer a bit.

We bought souvenirs in Aswan. We also visited Khan-el-Khalili in Cairo, but we didn't have to haggle there. Here is a **pro tip** we got from one of our guides: in the same area of Khan-el-Khalil, there is a shop named **Galal Souvenir Shop** which sells in fixed prices! We visited the shop and it was indeed a fixed price shop. It had a good collection, all the items were price tagged, and there were other people in the shop who were also buying with the fixed price. And prices seemed very reasonable to us.

The shop can be found in Google Maps but spotting the stairs (it's on the 1st floor of a building) was not obvious. We asked someone and he helped.

Lastly, buying things like coffee or crisps from touristic places will inevitably be more expensive. In the cafe of Edfu Temple, we were asked for 300 EGP for two 30 EGP packets of crisps. We could read the Arabic numerals that it was 15 EGP per packet. I was annoyed by this so our guide took us to a local store.

# Safety and Security

We didn't feel insecure at all. But that also doesn't mean we roamed around random street corners in the dark. Just used our common sense everywhere. And left our passports in the hotel safe. 

I read a lot on Reddit about Egyptian men annoying or harassing women tourists, specially when they are white or blonde. Let's discuss the issue.

Firstly, there are women everywhere in Egypt. The country didn't come as an unsafe place for its local women. In the streets of Aswan, Cairo, or Luxor - we saw countless of women in the bazaars, on the bank of Nile, in restaurants and hotels - basically everywhere.

Secondly, there was no short of white/blonde or women tourists. They were also everywhere in all the places we visited.

According to one of our guides, the largest group of tourists in Egypt comes from Asia, and second comes from Spain. He couldn't breakdown which part of Asia, but indeed we encountered numerous Asian tourists - from China, Japan, Indonesia etc. And half of them would be women. We also saw women-only groups and solo woman travelers.

Reading a lot about harassment of women in Egypt, I was a bit surprised to see women tourists everywhere in Egypt. I talked about this with a guide we had in Cairo. She was a woman, and I asked her how safe she feels in Cairo. She replied she uses the metro every day, and she doesn't feel unsafe in Cairo. Then I asked about the issue of Egyptian men harassing women tourists. She acknowledged that Egyptian men like white women specially. Her advice was to set boundaries with them while interacting. They take niceness as encouragement. If you are not interested, just keep your answers short and show your annoyance.

In our resort in Sharm, I saw middle-age Egyptian men hitting on middle-age western women. It seemed both parties were having a good time. But if you ignore and be rude, they cannot do anything about it. So don't feel afraid.

In the worst case, keep numbers of tourism police with you and call them if you need it. I heard they are serious about tourist problems. Don't know for certainty, of course.

In short, Egypt didn't seem more or less secure compared to a typical tourist destination in Europe. It was the usual.

# Concluding Remarks

As I already pointed out, we had fantastic time in Egypt! If you are thinking of traveling this wonderful land, take all the precautions you need for your peace of mind, and just go. 

Egypt had around 16 million tourists in 2024. Many people are traveling the country every year from all around the world, and they are putting effort to ramping up the number of tourists in upcoming years.

1ix3u0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopEatingSeedOils/comments/1ix3u0e/2_months_seed_oil_free_wow/,2 months seed oil free WOW,"I need to share this with someone as I’m almost two whole months into a seed oil free diet.

Last year I had a cancer scare (it wasn’t cancer thank god) that made me rethink what I eat.

I’m going to be honest my diet before was a coffee with artificial creamer, chickfila or snacks for lunch, and a dinner of usually a protein like chicken and potatoes and mayyybe a vegetable. I loved snacks like cheez its, nerds clusters were my favorite candy…. Please don’t judge, I see now that these foods were just addictive and left me craving more.

I started with just looking at items in the grocery store and their ingredients. I just want to know, why does everything have canola oil? Things you wouldn’t expect!

I’m happy to report today that my diet usually goes like this now:
Coffee with almondmilk (no seed oils, no gums)
Organic sourdough w/ grass fed butter 
Pasture raised free range eggs
Lunch is usually a chicken salad with homemade dressing
Dinner is different everyday but I’ve loved cooking Mediterranean meals like fish and some nice grass fed steak with a bed of veggies
Snacks are dried fruit, raw veggies, smoked meat, whole nuts, olives, etc
And of course, no fast food and if we go out it’s usually to nicer restaurants and steakhouses where I can order fish or steak with veggies.

I am sure I could do even better so I’m open to suggestions but I wanted to tell you my biggest changes:
No more bloating. I had such a distended stomach every day.
Clear mind: I was always craving more and feeling exhausted after working a few hours a day.
My skin isn’t breaking out as much: I have struggled my whole life with acne, and even though u still have one or two spots, almost all of it has gone away.

Sorry for the long post, I’m just so excited to see these changes and see how I feel in a year! And if you are looking into stopping eating seed oils, you won’t regret it.",16,1740408781.0,StopEatingSeedOils,10,0.94,False

Fat burners and metabolism boosters have gained popularity as [supplements](https://www.truegether.com/category/health-and-beauty) that claim to accelerate weight loss and energy levels. But how safe are these supplements? Do they truly provide an advantage, or do they pose hidden risks? This article dives deep into the science behind fat burners, metabolism boosters, and their safety for athletes.

https://preview.redd.it/t0euq8lso3le1.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2055c6b1272367b5d0bcf4ed8bd5304ba62e7d1

**Understanding Fat Burners and Metabolism Boosters**

Fat burners are dietary supplements formulated to increase fat oxidation, suppress appetite, or enhance thermogenesis. Common ingredients include caffeine, green tea extract, L-carnitine, and capsaicin. Metabolism boosters, on the other hand, aim to increase the body’s resting metabolic rate (RMR), leading to higher calorie burn throughout the day.

**Market Trends and Statistics**

* The global market for weight loss supplements, including fat burners, was valued at **$33.4 billion in 2022** and is expected to grow at a **CAGR of 6.9% from 2023 to 2030**.
* A study by the **National Institutes of Health (NIH)** found that nearly **15% of U.S. adults** have used weight-loss supplements, with athletes comprising a significant portion of users.
* A report from the **International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN)** indicates that about **65% of elite athletes** have used some form of metabolism-boosting supplement to improve performance and body composition.

**Potential Benefits for Athletes**

**1. Increased Energy Levels**

Many fat burners contain **caffeine**, a well-researched stimulant known to enhance alertness and endurance. Studies show that caffeine can **improve exercise performance by 3–7%** by increasing adrenaline production and fat oxidation.

**2. Enhanced Fat Oxidation**

Ingredients like **green tea extract** (rich in EGCG) have been shown to **increase fat oxidation by 17%** during moderate-intensity exercise. This can be particularly beneficial for endurance athletes who rely on fat as an energy source.

**3. Appetite Suppression**

Compounds such as **Garcinia Cambogia and Yohimbine** claim to curb cravings and reduce calorie intake. This can help athletes maintain a lean physique without compromising essential nutrients.

**Risks and Side Effects**

**1. Cardiovascular Concerns**

Stimulant-based fat burners, especially those containing **high doses of caffeine or synephrine**, have been linked to **increased heart rate, high blood pressure, and even arrhythmias**. In extreme cases, these effects can lead to serious heart conditions.

* A **2018 study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology** found that excessive caffeine intake from supplements could **increase heart attack risk by 20%** in individuals predisposed to hypertension.

**2. Impact on Athletic Performance**

While fat burners may provide an energy boost, they can also lead to **dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and reduced endurance**. For endurance athletes, excessive reliance on metabolism boosters could **hinder long-term performance and recovery**.

**3. Liver and Kidney Stress**

Some fat-burning supplements contain unregulated herbal extracts that may strain the liver and kidneys. In **2019, the FDA issued warnings against multiple weight loss supplements** linked to cases of liver toxicity and kidney failure.

**4. Dependency and Tolerance**

Long-term use of stimulants like caffeine can lead to **tolerance buildup**, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effects. This can contribute to addiction-like symptoms and withdrawal effects such as **fatigue, headaches, and irritability**.

**Legal and Ethical Concerns**

Not all fat burners are approved for athletic use. **The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)** has banned several metabolism-boosting compounds, including **ephedrine and clenbuterol**, due to their performance-enhancing and health-risk concerns.

* In 2020, a professional cyclist tested positive for **clenbuterol**, leading to a **four-year ban from competition**.
* Many over-the-counter fat burners contain unlisted ingredients, making it risky for athletes undergoing **doping tests**.

**Safer Alternatives**

Athletes looking to manage body composition and boost metabolism safely can consider natural approaches:

**1. Nutrient Timing and Diet Optimization**

* Consuming **protein-rich meals** can increase the **thermic effect of food (TEF)**, naturally boosting metabolism.
* **Omega-3 fatty acids** found in fish help regulate fat metabolism and reduce inflammation.

**2. Hydration and Electrolyte Balance**

* Proper hydration can prevent metabolic slowdowns and **enhance fat oxidation by 10–15%**.

**3. Strength Training and High-Intensity Workouts**

* **Resistance training** has been proven to increase **resting metabolic rate (RMR) by up to 7%**.
* **HIIT workouts** (High-Intensity Interval Training) can elevate calorie burn for **up to 24 hours post-exercise**.

**4. Natural Metabolism-Boosting Foods**

* **Green tea, black coffee, spicy foods (capsaicin), and apple cider vinegar** have been scientifically proven to support fat metabolism without harmful side effects.

While fat burners and metabolism boosters can offer **short-term benefits**, their long-term safety for athletes remains questionable.

Instead of relying on supplements, athletes should focus on **natural metabolism boosters, proper training, and a well-balanced diet** to achieve sustainable performance and fat loss. If supplements are considered, it’s crucial to **consult a sports nutritionist or healthcare professional** to ensure safety and compliance with sports regulations.

Would you take the risk, or would you rather stick to natural alternatives for peak athletic performance? The choice is yours!

She was twenty minutes early.

She ordered an English breakfast, with three sugars.  
I ordered an English breakfast, with two sugars.

She had a paperback—bent and worn—saying she preferred books over e‐readers.  
I had an e‐reader, easy to carry but not the same.

She said she doesn’t know what she wants to do with her life.  
I told her I’m still working it out.

She said she’s thinking about getting a tattoo but is scared.  
I showed her mine—carrying our grandma with us, who protected us more than we ever realised.  
She smiled at that.

She said she was trying to fix things with her parents.  
I told her I stopped trying.

She said she stayed up at night, wondering what she did wrong.  
I told her she did nothing wrong.

She said she often wonders what she could’ve said or done to make them care.  
I told her that some people—even parents—just aren’t capable of giving the love you deserve, and it’s not her job to break herself to earn it.

She said she was scared she’d end up with no family at all if she let them go.  
I told her she already had more family than she realised—she just needed to open up to them.

She said, “But they are your parents.”  
I told her we'd get sick of hearing that, and that being a parent is no excuse for treating their child like crap.

She said she feels hard to love.  
I told her she isn’t.  
She never was.

She asked if it’s okay to let go.  
I told her sometimes it’s the only way to breathe.

She asked if it gets better.  
I told her it does.

She asked if I’m happy now.  
I told her I’m not always, but I’m free.

My Take,"Hey u/keonehd and [u/billmondays](https://www.reddit.com/user/billmondays)  Ive been testing Monad testnet over the past few days, and honestly? Im blown away. As someone whos tried dozens of testnets many of which feel like half-baked dress rehearsals Monad stands out in ways I didn’t expect. Here’s my unfiltered review: 

The Good Stuff 

Speed Demon: Transactions feel instant. I’m talking sub-second finality for basic swaps, which is wild for a testnet. Even during stress-test windows, it held up better than most mainnets I’ve used.

Decentralization Done Right: 500 and more active validators already Node sync times are improving daily, and the network feels robust against outages.

Mainnet Energy: Deploying dApps here doesn’t feel like a test. The EVM compatibility is seamless I used Foundry Hardhat without tweaks and the ecosystem already has legit DeFi NFT projects.

Team They’ve squashed early latency issues FAST. Day 1 was rocky with congestion, but by Day 3 Smooth 

sure there is room for Improvement 

when occasional Lag Spikes coz  When 100k+ users swarm the same NFT drop or farm things get issue. Not unexpected but worth noting.

Team Transparency: Core devs are in Discord daily, answering questions and iterating based on feedback. No vaporware vibes here. 

Monad = SPEED.  Transactions finalize faster than my coffee brews. EVM-compatible, 500+ nodes, and a community shipping like there’s no tomorrow. Not perfect faucet limits, pls but after years of L1 letdowns? This one’s different.

Cons- I am wondering if consistency will be good or not since the rotisserie motor is pretty slow.
If anyone has tried this method pls drop temperature recommendations for the best results.
2. Using that rotisserie basket hooked up to a faster  (not too fast) motor and using a small room heater as the heat source.
Cons - cumbersome, not precise temp control on heater
Pros - more agitation of beans due to faster rpm and having a higher airflow low temp heatsource for roasting slowly

While I am well versed in all of the knowledge about good sleep, how to fall asleep, and how to stay asleep, putting the ideas into practice that actually works isn't working for me. 

For example, I have had a long history of watching Tik Tok throughout the evening until my eyes get heavy. The blue light and the highly dopaminergic elements of the app are obviously bad for falling asleep. However, when I try to cut out social media at night, I just lay in bed until well past midnight. With watching Tik Tok, I can fall asleep around 10:30/11:00pm. Doing light reading instead of social media always ignites my brain even if it's a boring or lightweight read, and I've laid in bed until 2am after reading for 20 minutes before going lights out. 

I've tried backing up my dinner time from 6:30/7:00pm-ish to 5:00/5:30pm-ish. I've also tried limiting how heavy that last meal is and getting the bulk of my calories earlier in the day. But when I eat earlier and lighter, I find myself feeling really hungry as I try to fall asleep. I just lay there and don't fall asleep because of the hunger pangs.

Let's say I watch social media and eat a late dinner and fall asleep at 10:30pm. I don't *need* to necessarily wake up until 6:00am. That would be a nice 7.5 hours of sleep, right? Wrong...I pop awake at in the middle of the night with my mind racing. 

Like last night. I fell asleep at 11:00pm and my alarm was set for 6:00am. I woke up at 2:30am with ""Two Tickets to Paradise"" blasting in my brain. I haven't listened to that song in 15 years. Why was it in my head randomly in the middle of the night? I never fell back asleep.... 

I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle. I don't sleep, so my inhibitions go down. I end up not sticking to the plan or watching Tik Tok because I'm tired and can't handle not being distracted. If I stick to the diet plan and not watch Tik Tok, I lay in bed struggling to fall asleep. If I don't fall asleep until late, I wake up tired and repeat the cycle. If I don't stick to the diet plan and do watch Tik Tok, I fall asleep but wake up too early. And repeat the cycle. 

Here's my actual protocol currently if you want to critique. I really need help here. If I could just sleep, I feel like a lot of things will fall into place with my goals and habits. But the insomnia is messing me up and I don't know how to address it. Maybe it just takes a long time to adjust to not watching social media before bed? Or takes a long time to adjust to eating earlier in the day?

Should I inform the police and my bank of the address?

I live in BC.  
Someone tried using my credit card to purchase approximately $1,500 worth of goods from an online merchant in Ontario. My bank sent me an automated alert; so the transaction was cancelled. I called my bank, got my credit card cancelled, requested a new one, and updated my online banking password. The fraud department is investigating. I did not use this merchant before.

The next morning, I received a “Hey you forgot something in your cart” email from the merchant in Ontario. When I went to the cart, I realized that the person trying to use my credit card knew my phone number and my email. They also put in their shipping address to the web form; a single-family home in Quebec. Now I have the “ship to” address for the attempted unauthorized transaction.

Something interesting to note; the compromised credit card was new, and had only a few transactions on it. I had used it only at one online merchant (a coffee/kitchenware shop in Quebec) where I shared my email, phone number and credit card number for the same transaction.

Considering all of these, I think an employee of the coffee/kitchenware shop is stealing customer information. 

Here are my questions:

1.     Do I need to file a police report for the compromised credit card? 

2.     Is there any benefit in contacting the coffee/kitchenware shop to give them a heads-up? The only way to contact the merchant is a general email on their website, or through snail mail. No phone number.

3.     Should I let my bank know about the rest of the story, including the “Ship to” address of the attempted transaction?

**Now i have unflavored electrolytes** but I am a bit unsure on how to best use them to my advantage.

Looking for some help/guidance on how to navigate this with electrolytes. Do I start taking them from day 1? or wait until day 2/3? Although it will be difficult, would it be better to cut out the tea and coffee? 

For context I will be trying to retain as much muscle as possible and I am doing this as a fat burning exercise, not necessarily to lose a lot of weight (I am aware that it will be an indirect benefit with water weight)

I will be training twice per day - one hour weight sessions and a 30min-45min cardio session. Is there an optimal way of timing this? Cardio in the morning and weights in the afternoon?

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I’m a 26-year-old from London, and I’m v excited to travel to Colombia and Brazil at the end of this year! I’ll be spending around a month and a half in Colombia and a couple of weeks in December and early Jan in Brazil. I’m currently learning Spanish (still a beginner), but I don’t speak Portuguese yet, so any advice on navigating Brazil without the language would be amazing!

Here’s my current itinerary for Colombia which I know I might have to cut some things out because a month isn't long enough:
- Land in Bogota
- Bus to **San Gil** (for adventure activities)  
- **Santa Marta** (base for the Lost City Trek)  
- **Lost City Trek** (4-5 days)  
- **Minca**  
- **Tayrona National Park**  
- **Palomino**  
- **Cartagena**  
- **Medellín**  
- **Jardín**  
- **Salento** (Coffee Region)  
- **Cali**  

From what I've seen from this forum and my research it's good to have a rough plan but not to commit to certain towns until I'm there and I get the right vibes so I'm happy to cut certain places out.

After Colombia, I’ll head to Brazil for a couple of weeks, but I’m still figuring out the exact route so I've done a lot less research here. I’m thinking of flying into São Paulo and then staying in Rio where my pals will join me.

I’d love your advice on the following:  
1. Colombia Itinerary: Does my route make sense? Are there any must-see spots I’m missing or places I should spend more/less time in?  
2. Lost City Trek: Any tips for preparing or choosing a tour operator?  
3. Transportation: What’s the best way to get around Colombia? Are buses reliable and safe?  
4. Brazil Itinerary: With 2-4 weeks, where should I focus? 
5. Language Tips: How easy is it to get by in Brazil with only Spanish/English? Any key Portuguese phrases I should learn?  
6. Hidden Gems: Any lesser-known places or experiences I shouldn’t miss in either country?  

Also, if anyone has recommendations for great hostels, local tours, or food spots, I’d love to hear them!  

Thank you in advance guys!

The pen tool was not working right, the app was unresponsive.

I killed the app, relaunched, same problem.

Restarted the ipad (2024 m4 pro)

When I did that, ALL OF MY NOTES WERE MISSING.

I panicked, so I tried turning icloud on and off, but it was ""taking too long"" and so restarted as it suggested.

Then it showed all my categories, but there were ZERO notes showing.

I removed the app, reinstalled it, but categories with no notes.

The notes were on my iphone

And when I launched on MacOS (I hardly run the app) they started loading, so I know they were in the cloud still.

**Here was the fix.**

1. I had to turn on icloud sync
2. I turned it OFF and REMOVED all the notes on my ipad
3. I turned icloud back on but it wasnt working.

**Here is what was strange.** I have two wifi connections. I was on the BETTER connection, but my phone and my macbook were on the ""slower"" one.

**I switched to the slower connection on the iPad, and all my notes started to INSTANTLY load.**

This cannot be a coincidence, and I know it seems like nonsense, but all of my notes loaded instantly and even though it is a pretty huge 1.2 gb backup, they are still slowly propagating, showing up as ""yes these exist"" and have the loading icon on them.

***Edit - All notes are back. They showed loading forever until i changed categories and then they were all available again.***

This is somewhat unacceptable. I use this for professional purposes and this was too crazy to have to deal with like this.

Making this so Google can index it and the AI models can eat it and digest it and hope it helps someone else.
