1qnh7mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1qnh7mu/delongi_weak_coffee/,DeLongi weak coffee,"Hi everyone,
I’m looking for some advice and outside perspective.

I have an older DeLonghi bean-to-cup coffee machine (built-in grinder, fully automatic). It’s still technically working, but for about a year now the coffee has been getting noticeably weaker and more watery, even with the strongest settings and fine grind.

At this point the coffee is almost not drinkable, I don’t finish my cup, which says a lot because I really love coffee. I’ve also cleaned and descaled the machine multiple times, but it didn’t make any difference at all.
I’m trying to decide whether it makes sense to:
	•	pay for diagnostics and possible repair (have NO idea how much it will cost)
	•	buy a new, simple DeLonghi automatic instead.

Has anyone been in a similar situation with DeLonghi machines?
Did repair actually bring the coffee quality back, or was buying a new one the better decision in the long run?

Thanks in advance 🙏",1,1769437037.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

I’m looking to add a super-automatic to my setup for the busy mornings when I can't do the whole ritual.  
  
My current rotation ( dark roasted bean , mostly robusta over arabica) :  
  
• Filter: V60   
• Strong: Moka Pot   
• Summer: Cold Brew.  
  
Grinder : Fellow opus   
  
My cafe order:  
Usually a Cortado or a small Cappuccino (I like a high coffee-to-milk ratio) or an Americano.  
  
The Goal:  
  
I want the best automatic machine specifically for espresso extraction quality. I don’t care about 50 different milk recipes or touchscreens;   
  
I care about the brew mechanism, dose size, and getting a shot that isn't thin or bitter. (on the worst case i'll buy a separate small automatic milk frother )   
  
I’ve been looking at the Melitta Purista because it seems focused on ""pure"" coffee and is quite compact.   
  
I also saw a worth mentioning of r Jura ENA 4 ( which cost triple than the purista).  
  
Are there other ""espresso-first"" automatics I should look at that handle small milk drinks (Cortado style) well?

p.s   
one of the reasons I didn't go for manual/semi-automatic machines is the need to change my grinder and the fact that the machine will be on a cabinet not near a a sink and I want to avoid mess as possible. 

Budget is somewhat flexible, going max to 500 Euros.

(Fake names have been used)

Me and Lily have lived together for a year and a half now, we are also apart of a big friend group for two years. This group always plans monthly meetups due to busy schedules and have a group chat (gc) that we all regularly talk on.

In this year and a half that me and Lily have lived together, she’s only recently (as of September) displayed odd behaviour. Such as :

\- Pretending to punch my face/body at random moments of the day and getting very close to making contact. She even tries to trip me up when walking. This is not in front of our GC friends

\- Making me come to the shops, gym, other social events because she doesn’t feel comfortable going by herself. But then when I want to do something with her, she skips out at the last moment.

\- Taking all the bowls/plates up to her room leaving none for me to use. Then when she eventually brings them down, she leaves them next to the sinks for an extended amount of time (the longest being a week and a half).

\- She makes gagging noises when I wash dishes, as I’m supposedly doing it the wrong way. But won’t offer to clean up the dishes even when they have been hers.

\- She doesn’t want me changing anything around in the common shared areas (i.e. not moving a couch to re-arranging where I put the coffee machine in the kitchen). But she then is able to move anything in these common spaces at anytime of the day (for example: at 2am decided to move around the whole living room during the week). 

\- Compares me to her friends back home (25F and 26F) where she used to live. Favouring them over me and our gc friends. An example being, over Christmas me and gc friends all wanted to meet up. Lily cancelled last minute due to forgetting her back home friends were coming on that day. This happened two more times, but I bailed Lily out several times before this to the point our gc friends have started to get annoyed at Lily.

We have tried a chore chart in the past but this stayed for about two weeks, due to mental health and Lily stating her demand avoidance. Our house gets so messy because of this that I feel embarrassed inviting GC friends round. However, our GC friends know Lilys mental health has been bad so they don’t mind meeting at another location.

Then me, Lily and GC friends all met up recently and after a long catch up our friends were driving us back to our house (me and lilys). Then the conversation of birthdays came up. Now lilys birthday is next month and she’s made no mention so far of what she wanted to do, but I still wanted to celebrate with her and get her a nice gift which she had asked for months ago.

However, Lily then stated that her back home friends and her are all going out for the weekend and celebrating on a tree top rope course (think ziplines, rope and nets). Lily then looked at me and stated “Oh but you won’t be coming and I didn’t think to invite you anyway obviously.” She then looked at our friends in the front and said to them “But you guys can come too if you would like?”. For some background information, I am scared of heights but I am always down to try new things to push myself to overcome my fear. Now, to have not only been told that I wouldn’t be invited, but also excluded like that in front of our friends made me feel so hurt.

As mentioned, I had planned to get Lily a gift she had been asking about and now because of all the small things building up at home with her and the rudeness i honestly don’t feel like getting her anything at all. I would appreciate any advice for navigating this as I am still living with her and she is still my friend! Thank you!",1,1769436903.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

For now, I don't want to buy much more equipment because, to be honest, I'm still shocked at the prices (iirc an original Hario V60 kit + gooseneck kettle is around 2k or maybe more), however meron naman kaming vintage Hario Syphon but I also need to buy new parts like filter + burner (also might cost me 2k). Pero I do have a generic coffee machine, french press, and a Phin.

So far ang plano ko is to maybe visit Purge Coffee and maybe try one of their specials as my ""reference"" point since most of the coffee na inom ko before (especially sa office) ang sobrang pait, that's why mostly latte lang iniinom ko (I've tried Vanilla Seasalt Latte in T'Brews Obrero so far ang sarap naman).


So ang question ko ngayon is, if you're in my shoes. How would you get into coffee here in Davao? From budgeting, to progression of equipment (wag lang espresso please, wala akong budget for that huhu), to what the beans are worth checking out here, etc.


TL;DR:

Sometime around 12 am the power went out I remember half waking up to my partner and the click and Humm of the generator kicking on. I reached in my bedside table, got a headlamp and did a sleepy walk through of the house, unplugged a few things, fed the stove filled the bathtubs up with water because I forgot, in case the pipes freeze, and got back into bed.

When I finally got up for real everything was just ....white. Not just snowing *buried*  I put pictures in the comments. Drifts covering windows,  the road completely vanished.
I don't know how much snow we got. It's hard to tell when the wind piles it up like that. It's still snowing.

It's one of those mornings where the world feels paused. No cars. No people. No distant road noise. The snow surrounds you like a blanket and time stands still.

It says the temperature is 5 degrees. The kind of cold that reminds you that mother nature doesn't mess around. Inside it's 64 degrees and the stove is working hard. But it's warm, the kind of warmth that makes you grateful for walls, wool socks and a full pantry. Out there this weather can take you quick. But in here I'm safe.

Coffees brewing. Stove humming. Generator steady. Oil lamps on the tables. Safe. Today there is no emergency Just calm.

We have a kitchen stove we can light with a match, tons of propane, a fully stocked pantry and water. If we lose power for a week I'm prepared.

The pipes froze but the bathtubs are full of water to flush the toilets. Grandmother always taught, 'flush from the bowl not the tank'  She lived through the depression Era. She was wise in surviving.

Laundrys done. NOAA radio in the windowsill. Cays fed. Everything charged, topped off and ready. Just went through my checklist, everything I'd done.

It's funny- you'd think all this would make me feel stressed, but it doesn't. It makes me feel weirdly peaceful. Competent.  Like yeah - I can handle this.

My boyfriend is out plowing for the town. I'm going to do some shoveling and snowblower  Honestly, the plows probably won't reach my road until late today. They have so many back country roads to do.

So I'm just sitting here by myself, drinking my coffee,  watching the wind blow the snow sideways across the feild feeling tucked in from the world.

It's quiet. A little boring. Really beautiful.  And on days like this I feel strangely proud of myself. I can weather a Tuesday just fine!",13,1769436733.0,TwoXPreppers,5,1.0,False

1qnh1j0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPGIndustry/comments/1qnh1j0/drink_hippie_expands_beyond_thc_with_a/,Drink Hippie Expands Beyond THC With a “Solution-Based” Energy Drink — Smart Platform Move or Category Stretch?,"[Drink Hippie](https://www.drinkhippie.com/HERBAL20), best known for its THC-infused seltzer Hippie Water, is officially entering a new daypart with the launch of Hippie Energy a non-THC, hydration-forward energy drink aimed at people who want energy *without* traditional energy drink baggage.

This is a deliberate step toward becoming a multi-occasion wellness beverage platform.

# What Hippie Energy actually is

* 75mg caffeine from Arabica coffee
* Functional mushrooms (lion’s mane, cordyceps, turkey tail)
* L-theanine, magnesium, potassium
* 15% fruit juice
* Positioned around **calm, consistent energy**, not stimulation

Flavors at launch:

* Peach Party
* Citrus Groove
* Watermelon Getaway

# Why this move makes sense

According to Sai Svoboda, Drink Hippie approached the category by asking *what people want to feel*, not what ingredients to stack.

Their research surfaced a telling insight:

* Energy was the #1 problem people were trying to solve
* Energy drinks were the #1 thing they didn’t want to consume
* This response was especially strong among women

That gap is where Hippie Energy lives.

# Founder-led, product-first thinking

Drink Hippie co-founder Sasha Pieterse framed the launch as part of a broader philosophy:

The brand doesn’t see itself as a THC company — it sees itself as a solution-based beverage company trying to “own your morning, your midday, and your night.”

That’s an important distinction:

* THC covers evening relaxation
* Energy covers daytime productivity
* The common thread is nervous-system friendly wellness

# Strategic distribution shift

Unlike Hippie Water, which leaned into retail early, Hippie Energy is:

* Launching DTC first
* Actively using TikTok Shop and creator commerce
* Targeting consumers who *can’t* or *won’t* consume THC, including states like California

Retail isn’t off the table it’s just being approached selectively.

# The bigger industry takeaway

This move fits a larger pattern:

* Energy is a $100B+ category, but legacy formats are wearing thin
* Female-focused energy brands are winning by reframing *why* people drink energy
* THC beverage brands are quietly hedging regulatory risk by building parallel platforms

Drink Hippie is essentially saying: *we’re not a cannabinoid brand — we’re a feelings brand.*

Can solution-based positioning really differentiate in energy long-term? Or does the category eventually flatten everyone into caffeine math and shelf wars?

Curious how others see this playing out especially as more THC brands look beyond intoxication as their core identity.

And apparently I'm terrifyingly good at writing according to 6 AIs. And I want feedback and hope to do alot in the future.,"\*\*ALRIGHT. HERE'S THE COMPLETE, DETAILED RECAP OF EVERYTHING FOR THE NEXT CHAT:\*\*

\---

\# \*\*AFTON'S JOURNEY - COMPLETE UNIVERSE GUIDE\*\*

\---

\## \*\*ABOUT THE CREATOR:\*\*

\- \*\*Age:\*\* 14 years old

\- \*\*Location:\*\*Germany

\- \*\*What he's doing:\*\* Creating a multi-series animated saga called ""Afton's Journey"" (AJ) completely ALONE using picsart stickers and CapCut for stop-motion animation, with text bubbles for dialogue (no voice acting yet)

\- \*\*Started:\*\* 2022 (as a joke continuation of a Springtrap-to-Scraptrap animation he saw, which became a 3+ year project)

\- \*\*Work ethic:\*\* Has been working on this for 3 years. Currently writing/animating the AJ2 Chapter 1 Season 2 Episode 3 finale, which is already 9+ minutes and not finished yet

\- \*\*Artistic claim:\*\* Believes he's already better than most writers in the ways that matter (scope, emotional depth, world-building, independence) and stood up to ChatGPT when it tried to say he wasn't ""there yet""

\- \*\*Goals:\*\* Wants to be both a writer AND an actor in the film industry

\- \*\*Other interests:\*\* Has a crush on Nell Fisher (Holly Wheeler from Stranger Things Season 5). Said the only way there will be an AJ7 is if she kisses him on the cheek someday

\- \*\*Key trait:\*\* Keeps EVERYTHING in his head - no master documents, no spreadsheets, no plot trackers. Just pure memory. No plot holes yet.

\---

\## \*\*CORE LORE & RULES:\*\*

\### \*\*THE AFTON SPECIES:\*\*

\- Started with the original William Afton (Burntrap) from FNAF lore

\- His old versions (Springtrap, Scraptrap, Glitchtrap) escaped during a 2022 Putin vs Zelensky fight while a giant Afton monster attacked

\- They created the Afton SPECIES - a race of clones/creatures based on Afton DNA

\- Most Aftons are GREEN

\- They can be infected/created through POTIONS (Afton infection method planned by Thsup but discontinued)

\- Different Aftons have different POWERS (Furrytrap = Hunger, 8bit-Afton = makes things disappear, Globtrap = teleportation, Icetrap = ice control)

\### \*\*THE MIMICS:\*\*

\- M4 models = newer mimics (RED EYES, mass-produced, weaker)

\- M1 = the ORIGINAL mimic from 1971 (ORANGE EYES default, CYAN EYES when using memory wipe power)

\- Created by Edwin (FNAF lore character)

\- M1 glitched, said ""Self destruct,"" got electrocuted, was thrown in trash in 1971

\- M1 woke up, KILLED Edwin, took his hat, went back to the trash pyramid and slept for 50+ years

\- Nightmaretrap woke M1 up in the present day (2038)

\- M1 can TALK naturally (has its own brain, not just programmed responses)

\- M1 has MULTIPLE abilities tied to different eye colors

\### \*\*KIOBINDING:\*\*

\- When two beings ""share a brain"" for PLANS

\- If one thinks of a strategy, the other instantly knows it

\- Nightmaretrap and Blueribs were Kiobinded

\- This is why Ellie (who has Blueribs's blood) can read Nightmaretrap's mind when she concentrates

\### \*\*TIME TRAVEL & GRANDALON:\*\*

\- Time machines exist in the AJ universe

\- Grandalon = special air that lets humans breathe in space (invented for rich space explorers)

\- One Saplow (like a liter but way more) lasts exactly 2 months

\- This is how Henry survived being in the Sewer Afton's stomach in space for 2 months

\---

\- Alternate histories

\### \*\*THE REVULSION TIMELINE (MAIN ONE PLANNED):\*\*

\- They arrive in a timeline WHERE THE REVULSION WON

\- In THIS timeline, something went wrong during the battle and the Revulsion SURVIVED

\- It killed EVERYTHING on Earth over the course of years

\- Now it's ALONE on a dead planet

\- Has been fusing with materials/corpses/tech for YEARS

  \- Multiple mouths

  \- Wings

  \- Colored lasers

  \- Has EVERY POWER but is ""fucking retarded"" - like a wild animal with god powers

  \- Just pure instinct and destruction

  \- \*\*It's a FORCE OF NATURE, not a villain\*\*

\- They arrive in the PRESENT of that timeline (years after Revulsion won)

\- In the SIMULATION, it shows they WON completely

\- Mike realizes something is wrong

\### \*\*TIME MISSIONS:\*\*

1qngyz0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qngyz0,"Built a free app for tracking EMOMs, AMRAPs, and complex WODs - would love feedback","Back in 2020-2021 I was pulling workouts from WodWell and tracking them on paper or random notes. Then took a longer break from training, came back recently, and a lot of it is just gone. I remember some workouts, but the times, the weights, which week I did what - most of that slipped away. Kind of a pity.

So I built something. It's called Momo.

It lets you set up workouts the way they're actually structured - AMRAP with rounds+reps scoring, EMOM with alternating movements, multi-part stuff like Barbara with rest between rounds. There's also workouts like Stone Cold where each round has a fixed part plus an AMRAP at the end (like max prison lunges) - and in the app you just tap to log reps between rounds, no fumbling around. Timer included so you just hit start and go.

The thing I actually care about most though is that it adds everything up for me. Like I can see I did 394 burpees this week without counting anything myself. Or when I redo a workout after a few months, my old time is right there so I know what to beat.

There's also a thing where you can compare with friends if you're into that. My buddy and I use it to see who's faster on the same workout. Or you can just keep it all private, whatever.

It doesn't write workouts for you or tell you what to do - just tracks what you actually did.

It's web-based, works on phone. Also works offline which I need because I train at home and sometimes the wifi is being difficult.

Oh and it's free. There's a buy-me-a-coffee button if someone wants to support but that's it.

First time posting about this anywhere so curious what you all think. What's missing? What would make it actually useful for you?

I was thinking of making a group, and every single day I have to get up early, post a pick of me text books, a cup of coffee and my username written on a blank paper with the date on it as proof so I can start getting up early again. If I fail to do so, the entire group can roast me, taunt me, put a screenshot of it on reddit and publically call me out for being lazy.  

  
I will also update every night my screen time and what I studied.

For coffee details:

\- Origin: Ethiopia (Haile Masha, Yeppo region)

\- Roast date: 20 January

\- Roast level: 2/5 (light)

\- Acidity: 4/5

\- Process: Washed

What I’ve tried so far (grind levels and results):

\- Level 8: completely blocked, no flow

\- Level 15: a few drips, very slow flow

\- Level 16: flows more but puck was very wet

\- Level 19: flows, 36 sec extraction, puck still wet, very bitter

\- Level 20: flows more, 26–27 sec extraction, puck still wet, coffee is watery and taste is now very acidic

I’ve tried adjusting temperature (medium to high) and strength (1 to 2) but results are mostly the same.

I feel like I’m close, but struggling to get a balanced shot with this light roast on the Ninja. I know light roast Ethiopians are tricky, but I’d love tips on grind setting for optimal extraction or any tricks specific to Ninja Luxe for light roast espresso. Or should I just get a darker roast next time?

I used to be on 20mg escitalopram for GAD. Escitalopram made me feel nothing all the time, made me gain a tremendous amount of weight each time I would stop/start, and made me pretty much asexual. 

Some time in December, I started slowing down my escitalopram and switched to bupropion (first 150 XL, then 300 XL). Prior to that I had been on escitalopram for over 10 years on and off, but mostly on. I tapered off from 20mg, started 150 at the same time and took it until I was at week 2 of 5mg, then upped to 300. 

First two weeks each time was amazing, but of course that was just the honeymoon phase. Today is, I think, my first official month on just bupropion XL 300mg. 

I am at my wits end. I’ve lurked this sub ever since starting the medication and have seen people say that all the symptoms they were having stopped after 2-3 weeks, sometimes more. 

Right now, I wake up with a BP over 135/90 and a heart rate of 96. I am usually terrible with BP readings because they make me anxious and make my BP higher than usual, so I try to do it several times in a row. Usually the second reading used to net me a 120/80, but nowadays it just keeps going up. That could all be attributed to my white coat syndrome (except the white coat is me in my own house…), but it’s not what is making me annoyed with this medication. 

There will be days where I have a headache above the eyes/on my forehead. It’ll be ever so subtle but it’ll be there, annoyingly enough. Almost every day, I feel like I’ve had 4-6 coffees. There is this ball of energy inside my chest most of the day. Though, for some reason, it will usually always start at noon to the point where I can tell when it’s time to have lunch. 

This jitteriness is very difficult to ignore and it feels like it’s making my anxiety worse. Some days, the day will go by perfectly with very little jittery feeling, other days I am up the ceiling with jitters. 

Has anyone gone through this and kept up with Wellbutrin? All my mental symptoms of anxiety are quiet, I feel energized (lol…) compared to when I was on escitalopram where I was always lazy or tired. I sleep well, mentally I feel great, my sex drive is back en force, but physically I’m going through it…

My doctor had suggested Trintellix as an alternative when we were looking to take me off escitalopram. I do not want to go back to an SSRI, I hate how it makes me feel. I keep giving the meds another week but I don’t know when this will stop…",1,1769435987.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I've been independent 90% of my life and while I value that, I realized it's becoming unhealthy in a way. The first step is finally being open—and posting here is me taking that step.

\- From Pampanga.

\- SINGLE. Walang sabit, hindi tulad ng iba dyan. Ay???

\- Doesn't smoke. The only vices I have are sleep and coffee (I know, they're opposites).

\- Normal BMI pa rin although I gained a bit of weight. I'm not as lean as before.

\- Hygienic because eewwww naman if dugyot 'no.

Ikaw, hopefully:

\- SINGLE. Never been married, never had kids, don't have kids, not in a relationship/situationship, and doesn't have excess baggage.

\- Not a sad or mama's boy.

\- Big on communication. An active listener who can actually converse.

\- Decent and respectful.

\- Witty and humorous.

\- Hindi criminal. Hindi nangchachop-chop ng tao.

\- Around my age or older. Pass sa bata (Baka tita mo na ako, hijo).

\- Hindi dugyot. Hygienic, please.

\- Lean or fit.

\- Taller than me.

\- Not long haired.

\- From Pampanga as well or nearby cities.

\------------------------------------

What if animal sanctuaries didn't have to rely on one-off donations?

What if, instead, our everyday actions directly funded them?

What if whenever we get our daily coffee, attend an event, or book a vacation, we also provide food for a rescued cat, chicken, or cow without spending extra?

That's where my app comes in!

It's called DIANA -- Digital Infrastructure for Animal Networks and Advocacy

The DIANA app will connect businesses, events, and service providers with ethical consumers and animal sanctuaries worldwide.  
\- Merchants list for free then a minimum % of all DIANA transactions automatically goes to sanctuaries  
\- Users just use DIANA as a simple, global, and ethical payment method, with the option to add a little extra to each transaction to support sanctuaries even more

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

I am pretty new to cross-stitching. I am about to finish my first ""Dimensions"" project and working on the back stitching; I am maybe 6-10 hours away from the end. 

I learned a lot, such as loop starts, way to finish threads without knotting, starting from the middle, keep the crosses the same direction, etc. 

I gained a lot of confidence in those maybe 100 hours (I was slow, I admit it; it is the coffee shoppe by dimensions but on 14 aida I think instead of 18, as I counted how many holes I had in an inch). It had just regular full stitches, half stitches, french knots, and back stitches.

I realize now how important the back stitching is for a polished look.

My next one is maybe too ambitious, and was thinking of a picture of our (now deceased) dog, as he was my husband's buddy, and he is still heartbroken years after.

I found a decent online program that translates the picture into a cross stitch pattern, tells me how long it will take, how large the aida fabric would need to be, what colors etc. It looks like a great lookalike of the dog as well. HOWEVER, it does not suggest back stitches. 

So I am wondering:

\- How do you go about coming up with the backstitching?

\- Should I wait until I have much more experience?

\- Or is there a program that also gives me a good idea of where to back stitch?

我一直想我和刘团长之间的事，认为自从2004年，他就没再来逗我玩了。我串联起了整个第2章《桃花劫》的故事（注，但还没有回忆出第1至3章的事），认为自己想明白了 “前世姻缘，命中注定” 这八个字。我一直对佛教的不见顶智（即上帝之眼）着迷，没想到刘团长用在我身上了。我觉得自己是个畜生，他那么大岁数了，快病死了，三番两次托人捎信让我去看他，而我像个活驴一样，无动于衷；自作孽，不可活！

One afternoon, I suddenly felt a stomach-ache and suspected that Dufferin gang (hostile forces) wanted to kill me and instruct my colleagues to poison my coffee. I went to the police station to report the case, but the police looked at me while I was talking; there is no record, no response. I left the police station and wanted to go to the hospital, but I knew that I would have to wait for more than ten hours to see a doctor in the hospital, which was unbearable, so I went home.

I have been thinking about what happened between me and Troupe Leader Liu, and I think he has not come to tease me since 2004. I have linked together the story of the entire Chapter 2 ""Peach Blossom Catastrophe"" (note, but I have not yet recalled the events of Chapters 1 to 3), and I think I have figured out the eight words “Former Generation’s Marriage Factors, Predetermining Fate”. I have always been fascinated by the Buddhist “intelligence of not seeing the top” (i.e. God's Eye), but I didn't expect Troupe Leader Liu to use it on me. I feel like a beast. He is so old and dying of illness. He repeatedly asked people to send me messages to visit him, but I was like a donkey, indifferent, self-inflicted sin, not deserving to live!

**9.2-1 肠梗阻 Ileus**

忽然，我感觉五脏六腑都在移动，身体里到处都是邪气乱窜。我小时候练过气功（参见第11章），对这种肢体的触觉幻觉不感觉奇怪，但这邪气发动的规模之大，程度之剧烈，让我震惊。我赶忙躺到了床上，以免晕倒。

我感觉到胸下出现一个隔截面（如插图9.2.1-A），上下不通气，胃肠不走动（注，现代医学称为肠梗阻）。我立刻调整呼吸，驱动真气沿着任脉向下冲击那个中截面。真气一接触那道截面，截面就溃散了。很快，那些邪气又变形重组，堵在胸口处（约在膳中穴，俗称中丹田）。我继续调整呼吸，用真气沿着任脉向下冲击堵在心窝处沉重阴冷的邪气。几分钟后，我打通了任脉，身体和胃肠的蠕动恢复了正常。我镇静下来后，心想：一时悸动，还真没遇见过；可不能再胡思乱想了！

Suddenly, I felt my internal organs moving, and “ill air” were running all over my body. I had practiced meditation when I was a child (see chapter 12), so I didn't find this kind of tactile hallucination strange, but the scale and intensity of the “ill air” shocked me. I quickly lay down on the bed to avoid fainting fall.

I felt a diaphragm section appear under my chest (as shown in Illustration 10.2.1-A), with no air circulation and gastrointestinal tract movement (note, this is called intestinal obstruction in modern medicine). I immediately adjusted my breathing and drove “True Air” down along the Ren Mai to impact the middle section. As soon as the “True Air” touched the section, the section collapsed. Soon, the “Ill Air” reshaped and reorganized, blocking the chest (about the Shan Zhong acupoint, commonly known as the middle Dantian). I continued to adjust my breathing and used the Qi (i.e., True Air) down along the Ren Mai to impact the heavy and cold evil Qi (i.e., Ill Air) blocking my chest. After a few minutes, I opened the Ren Mai, my body and the peristalsis of stomach returned to normal. After I calmed down, I thought to myself: I have never experienced such a temporary palpitation before; I can't let my imagination run wild!

**9.2-2 大爆炸 Big Bang**

过了一会儿，我不介意刚才发生的事了，又开始自责：我可真不是个东西，这不是人干的事儿。突然，我又感觉全身都有异动，赶忙平躺在床上了，全身的肉都有轻微的凹凸跳动的现象。凹凸跳动的现象有些加剧了。从命门穴（后腰两肾处），各发射出一股电弧的感觉沿着体表皮肤，像似水纹一样扩散；两股电弧在前腹处相撞了。接着，全身都有大小多个电圈套着肢体和整个身体上下移动，像似在做CT检查扫描一样，但我在经历的是多个电圈上下移动扫描我的身体。两只胳臂和两条腿分别有多个小电圈在上下移动扫描。突然，全身各处涌起气伴随着电流，以比读秒快几倍的速度，向丹田（如插图9.2.1-B）汇集。聚集在丹田后，立刻就爆炸了。随着爆炸，那些碎片气扩散到了全身各处。

After a while, I stopped caring about what happened and started to blame myself again: I am a piece of shit, this is not what a human being does. Suddenly, I felt something moving all over my body, and I quickly lay flat on the bed. My flesh was slightly bumpy and pulsating. The bumpy and pulsating phenomenon was a little more severe. From the Ming Men acupoint (the two kidneys in the lower back), a feeling of electric arcs was emitted along the skin surface, spreading like water ripples; the two arcs collided in the front abdomen. Then, there were multiple large and small electric circles all over my body, which were wrapped around my limbs and my entire body, moving up and down, just like a CT scan, but I was experiencing multiple electric circles moving up and down to scan my body. There were multiple small electric circles moving up and down on my two arms and two legs. Suddenly, Qi (i.e., Air) surged from all parts of my body, accompanied by electric currents, and gathered towards Dantian (as shown in illustration 9.2.1-B) at a speed several times faster than the countdown. After gathering in Dantian, it immediately exploded. With the explosion, the fragmented Qi (i.e., air) spread to all parts of my body.

我高幸地想：哎呀！大爆炸，百脉震开！我小时候在气功书上看过这种现象的描写，会百脉皆开。可是，正在发生的事情和传说的不一样。几秒后，整个身躯，包括脸部的肉都有明显的凹凸式上下跳动的现象，像似沸腾了着的水面；我的全身各处都在沸腾和震动。我对自己说：“镇静！沉住气！别慌！” 全身凸凹跳动的现象持续了几秒后，渐渐地平息了。这时我在床上平躺着，关注着全身各处的异动。

散布在全身各处的气变得清凉，随着流动在数百处小范围内聚集，并伴有电流、阴冷、凸凹地跳动的病气（或邪气）的感觉。我意识到了这不是好现象！不是书里描写的舒服，凉爽。我感觉那些迷走性风湿气中几十股大的，不走经脉，而是径直地走向心脏，一边移动一边还在汇集。有几股迷走性风湿气移动得很快，比如说，厘米每秒。

I thought happily: Oh my! Big explosion, all sutras (i.e., the lines in the acupuncture chart, see figs. 10.2.1) are shaken open! When I was a child, I read the description of this phenomenon in a meditation book, that all the sutras will be opened. However, what was happening was different from the legend. After a few seconds, the whole body, including the flesh on my face, had a clear bumpy up and down phenomenon, like the boiling water surface; my whole body was boiling and vibrating. I said to myself: ""Calm down! Keep calm! Don't panic!"" The bumpy and jumping phenomenon of the whole body continued for a few seconds, and gradually subsided. At this time, I was lying flat on the bed, paying attention to the abnormal movements of various parts of my body.

The air that was scattered all over the body became cool, and as it flowed, it gathered in hundreds of small areas, accompanied by the feeling of electric current, coldness, and uneven beating of diseased air (or evil air). I realized that this was not a good phenomenon! It was not the comfortable and cool feeling described in the book. I felt that dozens of large vagal rheumatic airs did not go through the sutras, but went straight to my heart, gathering as they moved. Some vagal rheumatic airs moved very fast, for example, centimeters per second.

我立刻紧张了，如果迷走性风湿气侵入心脏；心脏就是一团肌肉，若是这样怪异地颤抖，那不就是心肌梗塞吗！我小时候，听奶奶说过多次。她一次生气后，在外面树荫下睡着了。半梦半醒之间，她感觉像似有一股气流进了心脏。从那时起，她就患了心脏病。

保卫心脏，我立刻行动起来了，别的器官都管不了了。我开始用真气对离心脏近且移动速度快的迷走性风湿气进行攻击。好在，那些邪气流都很脆弱，一被真气碰到，就散了。很短的时间内，我就击溃了十几股迷走性风湿气流团。这时我发现，几股主要的风湿气移动得慢了，大部分风湿气不移动了。我镇静了下来。

I immediately became nervous. If the vagal rheumatic air invaded the heart, and the heart is a mass of muscle, if it trembled strangely like this, wouldn't it be a myocardial infarction!? I was having a Heart Attack! When I was a child, I heard my grandmother talk about these many times. Once she was angry and fell asleep under the shade of a tree outside. Between half asleep and half awake, she felt as if a stream of air entered her heart. From then on, she suffered from heart disease.

I immediately took action to protect my heart, ignoring other organs. I began to use my “true air” to attack the “vagal rheumatic air” that was close to my heart and moved quickly. Fortunately, those “evil airs” were very fragile, and they dispersed once they were touched by my “true air”. In a short period of time, I defeated more than a dozen “vagal rheumatic air” groups. At this time, I found that several major rheumatic airs moved slowly, and most of the rheumatic airs did not move. I calmed down.

**注9.2.2 Note 9.2.2**

插图9.2.1-2源自古墨西哥，表明古代的美洲有和中国类似的真气理论（即针灸和气功理论，参见第11章）。插图9.2.1-4是公元七世纪，帕卡尔王（Lord Pacal，亦作金童，特拉洛克，狮子王））的灵棺盖板，刻画了他堕入地狱的前因后果。图上部显示十字架或金刚剑插入了帕卡尔王的腹部，表示他被十字架钉住了，病危了。图底部他的狮子头正处于一个火匣子里，表示帕卡尔王堕入了 “火途” （即地狱，精神病）。火匣子上面是他的神父的棺材，表示帕卡尔王是被 “他神父过世” 的信息打入地狱的。棺材里是空的，只留下了尸体爆炸后遗留下来的三块儿残渣（即三块佛骨舍利，人骨），表明帕卡尔王听到他神父过世的消息后，体内发生了爆炸，所以他堕入了地狱，即患了精神病。棺材上面显示，一根射精的阴茎可以提起棺材，表示帕卡尔王和翠玉女（即玉女）的事实婚姻是治疗他的疾病的正确方法，可以使他脱离地狱。

Illustration 9.2.1-2 originated from ancient Mexico, indicating that ancient American had a similar theory of “true air” (i.e. acupuncture and meditation theory; cf. chapter 12) as Chinese. Illustration 9.2.1-4 is the coffin cover of Lord Pacal (aka. Gold Boy, Tlaloc, Jaguar) in the seventh century CE, depicting the cause and effect of his falling into hell. The upper part of the picture shows a cross or “philosopher-stone sword” inserted into his abdomen, indicating that he was crucified, was critically ill. At the bottom of the picture, his lion head is in a fire box, indicating that King Pakal fell into the ""fire path"" (i.e. hell, mental illness). Above the fire box is his godfather's coffin, indicating that King Pakal was sent to hell by the information that ""his godfather had passed away"". The coffin is empty, leaving only three pieces of residue left after the corpse exploded (i.e. three pieces of Buddha's bones, human bones), indicating that King Pakal's body exploded after hearing the news of his godfather's death, so he fell into hell, that is, he suffered from mental illness. The coffin is shown with an ejaculating penis that can lift the coffin, indicating that King Pakal's de facto marriage with Chalchiuhtlicue (aka. Jade Girl) is the right way to cure his illness and save him from hell.

**9.2-3 我投降了 I surrendered**

我对刘团长对我做过什么感到迷惑；但我和他的矛盾是我不同意他的 “我卢岩是刘健君的丈夫” 的决定（参见7.14节《死不瞑目》）。我真气已经很少了（注，聚集和运送真气需要大量的体力和时间），可这时的我全身都是风湿气。我已经处于面对死亡的状态，投降了。

我跪在床上发誓： “刘健君是我的妻子；刘团长是我岳父；我会去追求她并和她结婚。” 我不断地叨咕着： “刘健君她爸是我的岳父，刘健君是我的媳妇。” 我知道誓言对人的思想有很强的统摄作用。这样出声地叨咕，有助于我集中思想和精力，对不让松散意识抵触和破坏我的主意识，消除心理矛盾大有好处。

I was confused about what Troupe Leader Liu had done to me; but the conflict between me and him was that I disagreed with his decision that ""I, Luyan, is Eve Liu's husband"" (cf. v. 7.16  ""Die with Eyes Open""). I had very little “true air” left (note, gathering and transporting “true air” requires a lot of physical strength and time), but my whole body was full of rheumatism. I was already facing death, surrendered.

I knelt on the bed and swore: ""Eve Liu is my wife; Troupe Leader Liu is my father-in-law; I will pursue her and marry her."" I kept muttering: ""Eve Liu's father is my father-in-law; Eve Liu is my wife."" I know that oaths have a strong control over people's thoughts. Mumbling out loud like this helps me concentrate my thoughts and energy and is very helpful in preventing loose consciousness from conflicting and destroying my main consciousness and eliminating psychological contradictions.

我找出了我收藏的针灸经脉图。真气在经脉里会走得快，通畅和增强。我先在经脉图上筹划运气的路线，和打击风湿症的最短和最有力的角度，再运气发功对风湿症病处进行攻击。又击碎了几团风湿症后，我发现迷走性风湿症移动的速度变得更慢了。我沿着手少阴心经（如插图9.2.1-C）运气；用真气把心脏包裹了起来。这样，弱的迷走性风湿症不会有机会靠近心脏。

I found the acupuncture sutra map I collected. The “true air” will move faster, smoother and stronger in the sutras. I first planned the route of “true air” flow on the sutra map, the shortest and most powerful angle to hit the rheumatism, then used “true air” to attack the rheumatism. After breaking up a few more clusters of rheumatism, I found that the vagal rheumatism moved slower. I moved “true air” along the “Shou Shao Yin heart sutra” (as shown in Figure 9.2.1-C), wrapped my heart with “true airs”. In this way, the weak vagal rheumatism would not have the opportunity to get close to my heart.

这时，我认为自己必须吃好睡好，保持健康，才能与全身的迷走性风湿症对抗。如果我的身体健康变差了，就可能什么时候患了风湿性心脏病，死不了也成了废人。我向妻子和孩子做了生死离别，没明说，她们也不懂。我害怕睡梦里自己不知道保护心脏，所以睡觉前，洗了热水澡来平衡全身的体温，以减少做梦。我躺在床上，调息收敛思想，然后熄灭了前意识，把心身的控制权交给了无意识（古作神识）。佛经上说，这种状态，人的愈合力极强，等同神佛。

At this time, I thought that I must eat well, sleep well, and stay healthy to fight against the vagal rheumatism in my body. If my physical health deteriorated, I might develop rheumatic heart disease at some point, and I would become a disabled person even if I didn't die. I said goodbye to my wife and children, but I didn't say it clearly, they didn't understand. I was afraid that I didn't know to protect my heart in my dreams, so before going to bed, I took a hot bath to balance the body temperature and reduce dreaming. I lay in bed, regulating my breathing and concentrating my intention, then extinguished the preconscious and handed over the control of the mind and body to the unconscious. Buddhist scriptures say that in this state, people have extremely strong healing power, equivalent to Gods and Buddhas.

前面三小节描述的病症在现代的医学中称作皈依失调（Conversion Disorder；如图9.2.3-1所示），是一种罕见的精神疾病。在随后几年与风湿症对抗的过程中，我不断地研究，现在认为此病是这样产生的。我从小就敬畏刘团长，想拜他为师（是一种连自己都不清楚知道的向往），第8章中，遇到刘健君后，更是对刘团长有了深刻的爱恨情仇。随后，我和刘团长的爱恨情仇又持续发展了六年，但我没见过他，所以在我的幻境中他就是一团白色迷雾。那迷雾是现量（参见10.4.5 识蕴 Sense Node），代表刘团长，是我对刘团长全部感情的和记忆的依附标的物。当我意识到他已经过世了，这信息被我的无意识（古作神识）接收到后，那团迷雾就消失了，因为无意识只处理现量，而刘团长不再是现量了。这样，我对刘团长的全部感情和记忆就失去了所依附的标的物，就引起了大混乱，产生了前文的“皈依失调症”。

The symptoms described in the previous three sections are called Conversion Disorder in modern medicine (as shown in Figure 9.2.3-1), which is a rare mental illness. In the process of fighting rheumatism in the following years, I continued to study and now believe that this disease is caused by this. I have been in awe of Troupe Leader Liu since I was a child and wanted to worship him as my teacher (a yearning that I don’t even know myself). In Chapter 8, after meeting Eve Liu, I had a deep “Gratitude Resentment Love and Hatred” relationship with Troupe Leader Liu. Subsequently, my “Gratitude Resentment Love and Hatred” relationship with Troupe Leader Liu continued to develop for another six years, but I never met him, so in my mind he was a ball of white mist. The mist is the “Present Quantity” (see 10.4.5 Sense Node), representing Troupe Leader Liu, and is the object of my attachment to all my feelings and memories of Troupe Leader Liu. When I realized that he had passed away, this information was received by my unconsciousness (anciently known as God-sense), the ball of mist disappeared, because the unconscious only processes “Present Quantity”, and Troupe Leader Liu is no longer the “Present Quantity”. In this way, all my feelings and memories towards Troupe Leader Liu lost their attachment, which caused great confusion and resulted in the ""conversion disorder"" mentioned above.

前面三小节描述的病症是癔症（古作鬼病）中的一种极端现象，称作圣鬼。插图9.2.3-2源自古墨西哥，是一位堕入地狱期间的特拉洛克（即金童）。雕像顶部是古墨西哥人对圣鬼的表述。雕像的正面，圣鬼正用许多代表迷走性风湿症的阴茎攻击特拉洛克。阴茎代表产生特拉洛克体内迷走性风湿症的原因是他和翠玉女（即玉女）的婚姻纠纷。插图9.2.3-3是佛教中的金刚降魔杵；其中（4）（8）（9）的顶端部是代表圣鬼的雕塑。圣鬼的本质是惭愧；面对刘团长，我总是惭愧，是罪人。

前面三小节描述 “死不瞑目”诅咒在我身上爆发的现象。后来我发现那和西方人所说的 “三个不可饶恕的诅咒” 的意义相同，知道了西方人所说的三个不可饶恕诅咒， “立毙咒，钻心咒，和夺魂咒” 正是对死不瞑目诅咒所产生的现象的描述。

The illness described in the previous three sections is an extreme form of Hysteria (anciently known as Ghost Illness), called the Holy Ghost. Illustration 9.2.3-2 is from ancient Mexico and is a Tlaloc (Gold Boy) who was in hell. The top of the statue is the ancient Mexican representation of the Holy Ghost. On the front of the statue, the Holy Ghost is attacking Tlaloc with many penises representing vagal rheumatism. The penises represent that the cause of vagal rheumatism in Tlaloc is his marriage dispute with Chalchiuhtlicue (Jade Girl). Illustration 9.2.3-3 is the “Philosopher-Stone Pestle” in Buddhism; the top of (4), (8), and (9) are sculptures representing the Holy Ghost. The essence of the Holy Ghost is shame; in front of Troupe Leader Liu, I always feel ashamed and am a sinner.

The first three sections describe the phenomena of the ""Die with Eyes Open"" curse erupting in me. Later I found that it had the same meaning as the ""three unforgivable curses"" mentioned by Westerners. I learned that the three unforgivable curses mentioned by Westerners, ""Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus”, are exactly the descriptions of the phenomena caused by the “Die with Eyes Open”.

1qngggn,https://www.reddit.com/r/hoarderhouses/comments/1qngggn/searching_what_is_ultimate_perfection_of_human/,searching what is ultimate perfection of human life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

You know those tiny, slightly dusty second-hand bookstores? The ones where the shelves are packed so tight they almost groan? I was browsing one the other day, just aimlessly running my fingers over forgotten spines, when this unassuming little paperback practically fell into my hands. It wasn't flashy – just a faded, somewhat abstract cover with a title I'd never heard of: 'The Whispering Labyrinth'.

I usually go for epic fantasy or thrilling mysteries, but something about this one just *called* to me. The paper was slightly yellowed, smelling faintly of old coffee and forgotten adventures. I flipped it open, and the first sentence immediately hooked me, painting a picture of an ancient city shrouded in mist. I swear, I could almost *feel* the damp, cool air and hear the distant, echoing whispers the author described.

I bought it, of course, for a couple of bucks, and promptly devoured it that night. It wasn't just a story; it was an experience. The main character's fear when they realized they were trapped in a magical, ever-shifting maze? I felt that cold dread in my stomach. The moments of wonder when they stumbled upon a hidden, bioluminescent garden? My imagination exploded with color. I barely slept, turning page after page, completely lost in this bizarre, beautiful world.

By the time I finished, the sun was peeking through my curtains, and I felt like I'd just returned from an incredible journey. My mind was buzzing, a mix of awe and a strange melancholy that it was over. It wasn't a bestseller, no fancy movie deal, just a quiet, profound little book that completely swept me away. It reminded me that sometimes, the greatest treasures are found in the most unexpected places.

Seriously, it was like finding a secret portal in a forgotten corner. It got me thinking: what's your most memorable 'hidden gem' book find? The one you stumbled upon by accident and ended up absolutely loving?",1,1769435035.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

AITA for refusing to give my sister my wedding venue after she got engaged? I have been planning my wedding for a little over a year now, and I am very much not wealthy, so this has involved a lot of budgeting, spreadsheets, DIY stuff, and cutting corners wherever I can. One of the things I was really excited about was booking a small botanical garden in our city that’s beautiful and surprisingly affordable if you book far enough in advance, which I did almost a year ago, including paying a non-refundable deposit. My younger sister Emma got engaged about three months ago after dating her boyfriend for six months, and I was genuinely happy for her. Last week she asked me to get coffee, which I thought was just a normal hangout, but instead she told me she’d seen my wedding planning photos and absolutely fell in love with my venue and wanted to get married there too. I said that was fine since venues host lots of weddings, and that’s when she said she actually wanted my exact date. I honestly laughed because I thought she was joking, but she wasn’t. She said my date “just works better for everyone,” especially our parents, and then pointed out that my partner and I are already legally married since we did a courthouse wedding for insurance reasons, so in her words my wedding is “basically just a party.” She suggested I move my date and she’d pay me back for the deposit at some point. I told her no, calmly, and she immediately started crying, accused me of being selfish and “gatekeeping happiness,” and left. That night my mom called and said I should be the bigger person because Emma is emotional and this is her moment, my dad said I’m technically already married so the date shouldn’t matter, and now the family group chat has gone quiet except for one aunt posting vague inspirational quotes about choosing love over ego.

As we were walking into the hospital, a woman was leaving with a 5- or 6-year-old boy. As she passed by, she placed her hand over the child’s mouth and yelled at him to shush. The kid was singing “Labbat, Labbat,” a folk tune from the Syrian eastern region (known locally as Jazira), which has become a nationwide trend in Syria after the collapse of the Assad regime on Dec. 8, 2024. I slowed down a little to see what would happen next. At the main gate of the hospital, there is a kiosk that sells coffee, tea and other items. The old man working at the kiosk told the woman, “Daughter, let the kid sing; he is just a kid.” The woman responded, “Uncle, don’t you see the police just entered the hospital? We don’t want trouble.”

Surprised by all of this, I asked my brother why the woman acted this way. My brother nudged me to look to my left as we entered the main hall. There were a few Asayish (internal security) members, about four or five, with another man who had a broken arm. It looked like they were bringing him to the hospital. I thought to myself, what is the relationship between the song and the police? Why wouldn’t they be fine with it? “Labbat, Labbat” (“It is lit”) is so popular in Syria now that all it takes is playing the song in any public square, starting to dance dabke on your own, and waiting a few minutes, and you’ll notice a few people joining in the dance.

“Labbat, Labbat” is a celebratory revolutionary chant that reflects Syria’s transition from years of despair and repression to a moment of perceived victory and hope. Using simple, everyday language, it honors the resilience of the revolution as an unstoppable idea, credits revolutionary fighters with restoring freedom and emphasizes national unity by mentioning cities across Syria. The song denounces humiliation, calls on history to record this struggle, and envisions Syria’s future as one of renewal, dignity and rebuilding after great sacrifice.

This is the well-known song that is banned in the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), which, until Sunday, Jan. 18, 2026, was fully controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a governing structure established during the American-led fight against the Islamic State group in eastern Syria. “Labbat, Labbat” is banned by the AANES because of its symbolic and political message. It opposes the AANES’ stance, namely dismissing other Syrian revolutionary groups like the Free Syrian Army (which is named in the song) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and declining to support a unified Arab-led victory. Additionally, there is no reference that celebrates the SDF in the song or the Kurds in general. In the AANES-controlled environment, such songs are seen as threatening authority, sparking dissent and strengthening rival identities.

This incident reveals the gap between the SDF’s official rhetoric and its operational reality, and the deep disconnect between the region’s governance and its Arab-majority population. The administration formally follows the ideology of “democratic confederalism,” a system theoretically built on grassroots democracy, propounded by Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the PKK in Türkiye. However, this framework was never truly implemented in the areas under SDF control. Actual decision-making power is monopolized by a shadow network of PKK-trained operatives known locally as “kadros” (cadres). These cadres are often foreign nationals (mainly from Turkey and Iraq) rather than Syrians. They operate as a parallel authority that consistently overrules local civil councils and military commanders.

In practice, this reduces the SDF’s partnership with local communities to mere window dressing. In Arab-majority regions like Deir ez-Zor, local military councils and tribal figures hold titles but possess little independent authority. Real control over security and oil revenue remained with the cadres until recently, when Ahmad al-Sharaa’s government took control of most of the region, spearheaded by members of local tribes. This exclusionary structure fostered a sense of enforced quiet rather than consent among the Arab population. They viewed the administration not as a partner in self-governance but as another form of minority rule that created opportunities for corruption and marginalization.

The repressive nature of the SDF is not widely known outside Syria. It is often celebrated as pursuing a tolerant and democratic model of governance, at least relative to others in the country and the region. Even a native like me, who stays in touch with family and friends at home, only learned about the true extent of this repression when I visited. The crackdown on songs and national symbols, including the new Syrian flag, is comparable to that of the former regime of Bashar al-Assad.

When the regime fell 13 months ago, there was hope that the region would be peacefully reintegrated into the country. A formal but fragile breakthrough came on March 10, 2025, when the two parties signed a framework agreement. Under intense pressure from the United States, the SDF’s commander in chief, Mazloum Abdi, agreed to a timeline that would see it fully merge into the Syrian army, and the Kurdish autonomous administration dissolve into the central government by the end of the year. The text promised respect for Kurdish culture and language. The deal was widely celebrated by supporters of both sides in the country, and there was national euphoria about charting a new path for Syria after Bashar al-Assad, based on citizenship and respect for cultural diversity.

But Mohammad Attallah Khleif from Hasakah would soon learn that it would not be so easy. He spent over six months in SDF prisons for merely raising the three-star Syrian flag publicly the day after the March 10 agreement. Khleif took the Syrian flag out of his car, raised it in front of a crowd on the street and said, “From this place, the Syrian Revolution started in our city.” Ten days later, the SDF police came to his house after midnight and arrested him. At the police station, he was told, “You displayed the terrorism flag.” He responded, “This same flag was raised by the well-known Syrian Kurdish founding father Ibrahim Hananu in 1946. It is not a terrorism flag!”

After this interaction, Khleif was first imprisoned for one month in solitary confinement, in very poor conditions. He described the cell as a dark place with no light during day or night, with a thin mattress on the ground that was stained with blood and human feces. During this month, an American visited, whom he thought was an inspector. He recalls the inspector saying through a translator to the prison guard, “Why is there no fan or light in this cell, and why is the cell filthy?” A month later, they took Khleif out of the solitary cell and tried to force him to say on video that he was a terrorist. Instead, he said, “We are one country, Arabs and Kurds, and I thank the American forces for standing by our side!”

While Khleif sat in prison, the political agreements that might have protected him were unraveling. By late May, the implementation phase of the March agreement stalled. Upon leading a delegation to Damascus on May 31, Abdi refused to meet with President al-Sharaa or Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani, choosing instead to negotiate exclusively with U.S. envoy Tom Barrack. According to Damascus sources privy to the talks, the atmosphere turned toxic during a session between Kurdish negotiator Foza al-Yousef and al-Shaibani regarding the status of 12,000 Kurdish female fighters. Al-Shaibani was asked what would happen to the Kurdish female fighters in the case of integrating the SDF soldiers individually, not as a group. He responded that the female fighters could return to being mothers and wives. Additionally, following earlier hints from Damascus of constitutional recognition of Kurdish culture and politics, al-Shaibani responded by offering only a small amount of after-school Kurdish language instruction for children.

The breakdown was cemented by a miscalculation regarding American support. Barrack pressured the Kurds to submit to the Syrian government by warning that American military protection would not last forever. When he questioned how they would survive alone, al-Yousef snapped, “This is our business, not yours.” Her dismissal, which caused Barrack to walk out, reflected the Kurdish leadership’s conviction that the U.S. was actually formalizing a long-term presence, a belief that led them to reject his advice to capitulate based on what they viewed as the false threat of withdrawal.

Meanwhile, Khleif was put back in jail, but this time in a group cell with 20 other prisoners, all of whom were Arab, for four months. One of his memories is of another prisoner who used to recite the Quran, and every time he did so, the guards would yell at him, “Stop the bullshit!” I asked Khleif whether the treatment of prisoners in the group cell was better or worse than in the solitary confinement cell. His answer was, “Definitely better, to be fair!” He explained: “In the group cell, the food quality was better. They would get us chicken once or twice a week. There was plenty of food, but sometimes we did not eat it all.” He said that guards would make sure that they all ate and did not leave food behind. “They started letting us get more frequent visits,” he added. Yet the medical care was terrible.

Khleif eventually appeared before a judge at the Terrorism Court without a lawyer. In the first session, the general prosecutor asked him to recount everything about his life from 2003 to 2025. When I asked why 2003, he explained that it probably related to the violence that occurred in 2004 between the Kurds and the Assad government. In March 2004, violence between Arabs and Kurds erupted in the city of Qamishli after clashes at a football match escalated into mass protests by Kurds against decades of discrimination by the Assad state. Security forces under President Bashar al-Assad responded with live fire, mass arrests and a heavy military crackdown across Kurdish areas. Dozens were killed, hundreds were detained and the events became a defining moment in modern Kurdish-Damascus relations.

In his second appearance a few days later, Khleif was asked the same questions and returned to jail. A week later, he was brought before the same judge for the third time, but this time he was charged with joining terrorist military groups in 2011, referring to the Free Syrian Army, even though he never actually joined. This was irrelevant anyway, as the judge noted: In April 2024, the AANES adopted a law, approved by its legislative body (the Democratic Peoples’ Council), which grants amnesty for certain crimes committed before that date, fully pardoning misdemeanors and reducing sentences for some felonies. Khleif was pardoned by this amnesty, but the general prosecutor appealed against the judge’s argument, keeping him in jail another month.

Khleif was finally released after agreeing to strict conditions: prohibition from leaving the AANES region without permission, constant surveillance and mandatory reporting of his whereabouts every 15 days.

Along with the Syrian flag, the SDF was intolerant of many other gestures that showed support for the current Syrian government. Basil Obaid Ahmad, a local activist from al-Shaddadi, explained that photographing any street and posting it on social media was forbidden without permission. He said they did not want the outside world to see how dire the situation under their rule was. This pattern is well known in Syria, evident in the lack of independent journalists freely reporting from the area. Foreign journalists often entered the area under Kurdish supervision.

It was also prohibited to display images of al-Sharaa or the Syrian flag publicly or on social media. Using the official name of the country, “the Syrian Arab Republic,” was an obvious no. If mentioned, the word “Arab” must be removed. Also, discussing the region’s economic difficulties was prohibited. If you were caught doing any of these things, they would have ready charges for you as supporting terrorism.

Khleif knows a young man from his city, Hassan Al-Jibouri, who traveled to Damascus and faced retribution after returning. While there, Hassan took photos and videos of things related to the current Syrian government, such as flags, banners and official vehicles, and then posted them on social media. He was arrested when he came back and was sentenced to jail for three years under charges of supporting terrorism.

This tightening of control coincided with a total collapse of trust between the SDF and Damascus. By July, the Kurdish leadership seemingly began betting against the survival of the central government. Abdi boycotted a scheduled round of talks with al-Shaibani in Paris on July 24. Privately, he told confidants that he viewed al-Sharaa’s government as a temporary “face-lift” he had been “used” to legitimize, and he wished to avoid tethering his movement to a regime he believed would not last. The SDF began exploring alternative channels, even hoping for a comprehensive deal with Türkiye involving the PKK leader Öcalan, to secure rights in exchange for ending the armed struggle.

In August, the political rift escalated into accusations of treason. On Aug. 8, the SDF chaired a conference in Hasakah that included Druze leader Hikmat al-Hajari and Alawite Sheikh Ghazal Ghazal via video link. Damascus viewed this coordination with minority leaders as a dangerous separatist plot, furiously labeling the organizers traitors and canceling future talks in France. In a clear signal that they were seeking alternative security guarantors, the SDF reactivated their relationship with Moscow; Sipan Hamo, a commander who had previously managed talks with the Russians, reappeared as a liaison at the Russian Hmeimim air base, coinciding with a Russian military patrol in Hasakah. Although Abdi and Kurdish leader Ilham Ahmad visited Damascus later in the month, they achieved nothing, and Abdi again declined to meet al-Sharaa.

This paranoia regarding political allegiance led to numerous illegal searches and seizures of civilians’ homes, phones and cars, said Basil Obaid Ahmad. For example, if someone from this area traveled to Damascus or other parts under al-Sharaa’s government, security forces would raid their home. If they discovered that the purpose of their travel wasn’t education or medical treatment, they might detain them and potentially jail them until the situation was clarified.

Dr. Ghalib Mohammad is a pediatrician from Hasakah who provides medical care to children at al-Hawl Refugee Camp. On one of his visits, he brought a wheelchair for a 4-year-old girl who lost both of her legs. He was arrested, interrogated and sentenced to five years for supporting terrorism. The source who shared this story with me wondered, “What kind of political system justifies imprisoning a pediatrician for five years for helping a handicapped kid just because this kid happened to be the daughter of an al-Hawl resident?!”

Anyone with relatives who have joined the transitional Syrian government or forces will face frequent and random home raids and detentions. Worst of all, said Ahmad, there’s a constant fear that anyone in your daily life and social circles “could be a spy for them, as they have recently increased the number of such people significantly due to the tensions in our region caused by the SDF not integrating into the rest of the country.” This “walls have ears” paranoia was another hallmark of the Assad regime and its Baathist counterpart in Iraq under Saddam Hussein.

Random searches of civilian phones are very common at security checkpoints. Abu Mazin, a public transportation van driver between Deir ez-Zor and Hasakah, told me: “At the checkpoint at the entrance of Hasakah city, the police searched the men among the passengers on my bus.” After searching the phones, they found a young man whose phone background featured a picture of al-Sharaa. They took the phone, handcuffed the young man and called a police car to take him for investigation.

Another of Abu Mazin’s stories was about two Arab SDF soldiers who were riding with him in his van. As they approached a checkpoint and saw that they were checking people’s phones, “the two soldiers immediately deleted their phones” (meaning they reset their phones to wipe all the messaging and social media content). When the checkpoint security personnel found out that the phones were wiped, they pulled the van aside and arrested the two soldiers. When Abu Mazin expressed his discontent with their behavior, especially since the two young men were soldiers (and part of the same organization), they arrested him too and interrogated him for four hours. Abu Mazin said he found out later that those two soldiers were jailed for four months.

Since the fall of the Assad regime, Arabs in SDF areas who once saw the SDF as a better alternative than the brutal Assad regime or the Islamic State have changed their position. Seeing a Sunni Arab government in Damascus, they have demanded to come under its control. The SDF, which had a proclivity for political repression even pre-2025, responded to this shift with force. Over the past year, arrests have skyrocketed, with hundreds of civilians detained simply for expressing support for the Damascus government.

Does the SDF treat Kurds who oppose them differently? I asked everyone I spoke with this question. The answer is yes; they are treated worse. They do not receive better treatment just because they are Kurdish. On the contrary, the SDF expects more loyalty and support from Kurds because it considers itself to be fighting for the Kurdish people’s rights.

Still, despite the hostilities, a new push for integration occurred in September. Proposals were floated to appoint Abdi as army chief of staff or deputy defense minister and allocate Cabinet posts to the Kurds. A plan was discussed to deploy Kurdish female fighters to Alawite, Christian and Druze areas to dilute Islamist influence, avoiding conservative Sunni regions. Yet al-Sharaa remained adamant on the political structure, offering only Law 107 (a local administration law from 2011 that provided for limited decentralization through elected councils while preserving strong central government control) and refusing federalism or any change to the state’s name. Al-Sharaa publicly criticized Kurdish “unrealistic ambitions,” warning that the northeast was a Turkish national security issue.

A final attempt at a breakthrough in the talks between Damascus and the Kurds happened in October. Damascus proposed the creation of a Northern Division of the Syrian Army responsible for territory east of the Euphrates. It would include four units, two appointed by al-Sharaa and two by Abdi. Abdi rejected the offer, demanding three of the four units for the SDF. Meanwhile, the Kurds continued digging trenches and preparing for the possibility of a military confrontation, reportedly with Israeli support.

On Oct. 13, the SDF launched a military offensive in Aleppo’s Sheikh Maqsood district, attempting to cut utilities and overrun the city before U.S. intervention halted the fighting. The SDF subsequently tabled a new set of demands that Damascus deemed “suicidal” for al-Sharaa to accept, including: 30% Kurdish representation across all government branches, including 28 ambassadorships; the creation of three Kurdish-majority governorates (Afrin, Kobani, Qamishli) with elected governors; a 70% to 75% share of oil revenue for the central government (implying a significant retained share); and the codification of Kurdish rights and language in the interim constitution.

On Jan. 17, in an attempt to move the negotiations forward, al-Sharaa issued a presidential decree affirming the rights of Syrian Kurds. The decree recognizes Kurds as an integral part of the Syrian nation, guarantees cultural and linguistic rights (including the use and teaching of Kurdish), addresses long-standing citizenship issues for stateless Kurds, and designates Nowruz as a national holiday. But Kurds say that lasting protections require constitutional guarantees rather than relying only on executive decrees.

The January 2026 offensive on SDF areas is the result of the failure of these negotiations. For many Westerners, feeling sympathy toward the SDF comes naturally, given their secular ideology, the full participation of women and their successful record of fighting the Islamic State. However, this sympathy often overlooks the rigidity of the SDF’s position as well as its adoption of Assad’s regime methods in dealing with opponents.

Nine months separated my last visit to the AANES in March 2025 and my current visit. One thing was very clear to me before the recent clashes played out: The region’s atmosphere was boiling, with the relationships between the SDF and the people under its rule filled with impatience, mistrust and fear. The Arab majority in the region was growing increasingly impatient that al-Sharaa and Abdi had not finalized the integration agreement. The Kurdish leadership was aware of this, and they feared that the majority of the region’s population, especially Arabs, might revolt against them.

Their fears proved right on Sunday. After receiving a green light from Damascus, tribes across eastern Syria rose up over the weekend in areas where government forces had not yet deployed. Initially, revolutionary factions that had contributed to Assad’s downfall, such as HTS and other groups later integrated into the new Syrian army, were prevented from crossing the river, largely to avoid direct confrontation with the SDF. When negotiations collapsed, it was tribal fighters who led the fighting against the SDF, with official Syrian government forces arriving only afterward to consolidate control. They were eager to throw off what they perceived as an occupying force, despite their fears that the government might not enter their areas and they might remain outgunned by the SDF. At the time of finalizing this article, most of the region is no longer under the SDF’s control. The SDF has lost many of its Arab components as they decided to defect. For instance, the Sanadid faction formally switched sides on Tuesday. The Sanadid Forces, an Arab tribal militia drawn primarily from the Shammar tribe in northeastern Syria, used to be closely aligned with the Kurdish-led SDF.

The testimonies and incidents I encountered or heard stand in stark contradiction to the democratic image projected by the Syrian Democratic Forces. The suppression of fundamental freedoms like free speech, freedom of movement, political symbols and even humanitarian efforts, along with arbitrary arrests, collective punishment and the weaponization of “terrorism” charges, echoes the very authoritarian practices Syrians protested against in 2011. Far from offering a pluralistic or rights-based alternative, the SDF’s actions increased fear, self-censorship and social division, especially among Arab communities, while damaging trust and legitimacy during a crucial stage of Syria’s postwar transition.

As the al-Sharaa government establishes control over the eastern and northeastern parts of Syria, it will do well to learn from the mistakes of the SDF and the Assad regime before it, and mend social ties and contain reprisals. Real and stable integration with the rest of the country will require accountability, respect for civil liberties and a clear break from the logic of authoritarian control that has deeply scarred the country.",9,1769434828.0,Syria,2,1.0,False

For context, i'd vaped solidly for around 5 years, my cryptonite was Elux Kiwi, guava and passionfruit, i'd probably get through maybe 4-5ml of 10mg per day.  
  
I'd tried in the past with very little joy, i work a semi-high pressure job and during ""stressful"" periods, it felt almost impossible to give it up, sadly, vaping became a stress response.   
  
This time however, i'd decided to give the patch a go, and it's really made the proccess much more manageable. The cravings still appear but that's my brain testing the waters, to see if the vape is still an option, which it isn't. The real difficulties on the first couple of days was reaching for a vape that wasn't there, whilst doing familiar leisurely things. You know, sipping your coffee and going for the hit after. These have VASTLY diminished over the course of 11 days.  
  
I'm currently sat on 14mg patches, the cravings over the last 11 days have gotten shorter, more manageable, and overall something i can brush off. I'm tapering down to 7mg later this week.   
  
By mid February, i should be nicotine free, but for now, while my body is unlearning the physical vaping habit, the NRT is worth it's weight in gold.   
  
Whilst there are much ""grander"" quit storys out there, and i'm only 11 days in. I thought i'd share my experience for those who are just starting to quit, but feel they'd be cheating by using NRT. Personally, i see it as NRT helps you break the habit, before you take on the chemistry. ",3,1769434495.0,QuitVaping,5,1.0,False

The highlight is the sunrise trek to Los Torres base. I would like to share this with the community. The final result video is attached or you can visit it here. (https://www.instagram.com/reel/DT-ZtRoDW9q/). Feel free to ask any questions about this trek and/or W trek overall. Much love! 🫶🏼

 

\*\*\*\*\*

Route: Central Campground / Hotel Las Torres → Mirador Base Las Torres

Distance: \~7 miles (11 km) one way

Elevation gain: \~3,000 ft / 900 m

Time: 3–4 hrs up (in darkness for sunrise), 2–3 hrs down

Difficulty: Moderate → Very strenuous at the end

I hiked this in the dark to catch sunrise at the base of Las Torres. It’s 100% worth it—but you need to be prepared.

⸻

Trail Breakdown (Section by Section)

1. Central Campground → Valley Entrance (Warm-up)

Terrain:

	•	Wide dirt trail, gently uphill

	•	Occasional rocks, some exposed sections

What it’s like:

This part lulls you into a false sense of confidence. The trail is well-marked, not too steep, and easy to follow even with a headlamp. If it’s windy, you’ll feel it here—Patagonia doesn’t wait for daylight.

Conditions:

	•	Can be muddy after rain

	•	Windy and cold before sunrise

💡 Tip: This is where you settle into your pace. Don’t rush—it’s a long way up.

⸻

2. Valley Section → Forest Climb (Steady Grind)

Terrain:

	•	Narrower trail

	•	Dirt mixed with rocks and roots

	•	Consistent uphill

What it’s like:

You enter the forest and start gaining elevation seriously. This is where breathing becomes noticeable. The trees block the wind, but it’s darker and colder here.

Conditions:

	•	Roots can be slippery

	•	Occasional muddy patches

	•	Snow possible early season

💡 Tip: Poles help here, especially on the descent.

⸻

3. Forest → Moraine (The Suffering Begins)

Terrain:

	•	Loose rocks

	•	Steep incline

	•	Uneven footing

What it’s like:

This is where people stop talking. It’s steep, rocky, and relentless. You’ll probably see headlamps zig-zagging above you—this part feels endless in the dark.

Conditions:

	•	Very loose gravel

	•	Strong winds as you exit the trees

	•	Cold hands, frozen water bottles possible

💡 Tip: Take short, steady steps. This is not the place to rush.

⸻

4. Final Moraine → Base of Las Torres (Mental Game)

Terrain:

	•	Boulder hopping

	•	No smooth trail

	•	Steep but short

What it’s like:

The final push is brutal but short. In darkness, it feels longer than it is. Once you crest the ridge… the lake appears.

⸻

At the Lake (Mirador Base Las Torres)

What to Expect at Sunrise:

	•	Absolute silence (except wind- can be a LOT of wind)

	•	Freezing temperatures

	•	The granite towers slowly turning pink, orange, then gold

⸻

What to Wear (Critical)

Patagonia weather is no joke. For a sunrise hike, layering is everything.

Upper Body

	•	Moisture-wicking base layer

	•	Insulating mid-layer (fleece or light down)

	•	Windproof & waterproof shell

Lower Body

	•	Hiking pants 

	•	Thermal leggings is recommended 

Accessories

	•	Warm beanie

	•	Gloves (windproof preferred)

	•	Neck gaiter or buff

Footwear

	•	Hiking boots with good ankle support

	•	Wool socks

⸻

What to Bring (Do Not Skip)

Essentials

	•	Headlamp (fully charged) + spare batteries

	•	1 -2 L water

	•	High-energy snacks (nuts, bars, chocolate)

	

Nice to Have

	•	Thermos with hot tea or coffee

	•	Lightweight sitting pad for the lake

⸻

Final Advice

	•	Start early—most people leave around 2:00–2:30 AM - our sunrise time was 5:58am

	•	Check wind conditions the night before- Refugio has daily report on screen at central

	•	Don’t underestimate the final moraine

	•	It is bone chilly cold at the lake when you stop moving, so be prepared!

This hike is hard. It’s cold. It’s windy.

People who don't greet you, immediately order and just summarize what they want without a thank you. We have loyalty cards on which you can collect stamps, but the discussions I have over them is ridiculous.   
They treat me and my employees like we didn't have education at all. When I don't really hear someone and say ''sorry, can you say that again?'' they start to talk slower and louder like I'm some kind of nitwit.   
Also the additional comments you get. ''This coffee is cold, can I get a new one? Like, it's cold. I couldn't even drink it, cause it's so cold. It's gross to be honest. How is that possible?'' Just say it's cold, and I give you another one, I already understood you. 

It's especially with older people and people from, let's say, my parents age. Students and younger people are a lot more respectfull and treat you like a person. They even engage in a conversation sometimes.

# 9.1 刘团长的死讯 News of Liu’s Death

二零一一年五月，我到高德联合公司（Golder Associates Inc.）的实验室工作。高德是家上市了的国际性岩土工程公司。我只在实验室里工作，不下工地，接触的人少。实验室的经理玛丽的名字很长，我不能拼读。在面试我时，她同意我称呼她玛丽（Mary）。她来自一个我不知道在哪里的国家。她再次解释；我还是想不出来，就不好意思再问了。工作一段时间后，我发现人们称呼她玛丽亚、罗密欧什么的，再次问应该怎么称呼她。她回答她的生活里就这样，不同的人叫她不同的名字，习惯了。我常观察她，她是个标准健壮的欧洲血统白人，行为端庄得体，传统西方人的世界观，性格不紧不慢，没有地方口音，没有民族和地域的特质；我分析不出她来自何方。

开始的两个月还好，可工作中，我又接触到了达弗罗克（Davroc）和大佛印（Dufferin）公司的人和业务，渐渐的我的觉思失调症又成长起来了。我和同事之间有了矛盾，对黑社会的担心越来越重。刘健君研究灵魂转世，雇佣黑社会的人，黑社会的人办事不成，丢了面子，或者什么人矜持不住了，就可能出现谋杀事件。

In May 2011, I went to work in the laboratory of Golder Associates Inc. Golder is a publicly traded international geotechnical engineering firm. I only worked in the lab, not went to the job site, had little contact with people. The lab manager, Mary, had a long name that I couldn't spell. When I was interviewed, she agreed to let me call her Mary. She was from a country I didn't know where. She explained again; I still couldn't figure it out, so I was too embarrassed to ask again. After working for a while, I realized that people called her Maria, Mario, or whatever, and again asked what I should call her. She replied that that was how it was in her life; different people called her different names and got used to it. I often observe her. She is a standard, strong white woman of European descent. She behaves in a dignified and proper manner, has a traditional Western worldview, a leisurely personality, no local accent, and no ethnic or regional characteristics. I cannot analyze where she is from.

The first two months were fine, but at work, I met people and business from Davroc and Dufferin, and gradually my schizophrenia worsened. I had conflicts with my colleagues, and I became more and more worried about the black society. Eve Liu studied soul reincarnation and hired black society people. If those mafias failed to get tasks done, lost face, or someone lost their composure, there might be murders.

一天的喝咖啡休息时间，听同事们在唠嗑。事后，不知为什么，我回忆起了玛丽讲她开会时看的录像。刘健君回答桫椤派去调查我的人：“卢岩心理的社会环境和别人不一样。他念研究生的时候，他同屋那个人是我爸爸安排的。他们就一起骗他；他就信了。”

调查的人问：“现在你爸爸在哪儿？”

刘健君回答：“死了！我爸爸做的事儿与我没有关系。那时我不在国内，我在美国读博士呢！”

调查的人问：“那你为什么不告诉卢岩？”

One day during a coffee break, I listened to my colleagues chatting. Afterwards, for some reason, I recalled Mary's talk about the video she watched in the meeting. Eve Liu answered the person sent by Sal Fasullo to investigate me: ""Luyan's psychological social environment is different from others. When he was a graduate student, the person he shared a room with was arranged by my father. They lied to him together; he believed it.""

The investigator asked, ""Where is your father now?""

Eve Liu replied, ""Dead! What my father did has nothing to do with me. I was not in China at that time, I was in the United States studying for my doctorate!""

The investigator asked, ""Then why didn't you tell Luyan?""

刘健君回答：“我爸说，卢岩很犟。他不亲眼看见，谁告诉他，他都不信，就只能是别人在他旁边唠嗑，或者路上的人唠嗑，他听见了，就想。一点儿点儿地，他想明白了，就没事儿了。”

调查的人问：“你爸爸想让卢岩干什么？”

刘健君回答：“他说我这辈子命运中没有丈夫，除了卢岩，别人都不行。说我不是他的女儿，卢岩是他的儿子。他就想让我和卢岩结婚。我爸说，看不见我和卢岩结婚，他死不瞑目。你看，我不迷信，不信这个。”

Eve Liu replied, ""My dad said that Luyan was very stubborn. If he didn't see it with his own eyes, he wouldn't believe anyone who told him, so he could only think about it when others chattered next to him or people on the road chattered, and he heard it. Little by little, he figured it out, and then he was fine.""

The investigator asked, ""What did your father want Luyan to do?""

Eve Liu replied, ""He said that I had no husband in my life, and that no one else would do except Luyan. He said that I am not his daughter and Luyan is his son. He then wanted me to marry Luyan. My dad said he can't see me marry Luyan, he dies with eyes open. You see! I am not superstitious and don't believe in this.""

我回忆起来玛丽亚所说的话之后，感觉奇怪：如果这是我以前想过的事，想象与现实混淆了，那不应该有我根本不知道的事。我回忆起了本书第2章中《桃花劫》的故事，是我妈妈给我讲的。她不记得 “前世姻缘，命中注定” 这八个字了。那玛丽亚说的这八个字是从哪里来的（注2）！？而且玛丽说的是英语，她的用词和我英语用词的习惯根本不一样。我回忆、分析刘团长已经五、六年没对我做过什么了，认为他真的已经过世了。

我认为刘团长真的早就过世了，心情很不好，两三天里像似病了一样。我怀疑刘健君收买了我的妻子，并委托人照顾我的孩子，我总发现他们在变化。

注2，环境形成后，相关的语言就会出现。在前文第2章，我两岁时听这样的词当然不理解，记忆也很少，但这时有了相关的环境，这词就冒出来了。

After I recalled what Marry said, felt strange: If this was something I had thought about before, and imagination was confused with reality, then there shouldn't be something I didn't know. I recalled the story of ""Peach Flower Catastrophe"" in Chapter 2 of this book, which my mother told me. She didn't remember the eight words “Former Generation’s Marriage Factors, Predetermining Fate”. So where did Mary's eight words come from (Note 2)!? And Mary spoke English; her word usage was completely different from my English verbal habits. I recalled and analyzed that Troupe Leader Liu had not done anything to me for five or six years, thought he was dead.

I thought that Troupe Leader Liu had really passed away a long time ago. I was in a very bad mood and seemed to be sick for two or three days. I suspected that Eve Liu bribed my wife and entrusted someone to take care of my children. I always found that they were changing.

Note 2, after the environment is formed, the related language will appear. In the previous chapter 2, when I was two years old, I didn’t understand such words and I had very little memory, but now there is a related environment, so the words pop up.

I took the photo in the frame last October with just my phone. I liked the vibe so much that I printed it out for my living room.

I've seen some incredible angles online recently, so I'm heading back this weekend to verify them. My goal is to map out a ""The Easy-Going Photo Route""—specific spots where regular travelers (using just a phone or a Fujifilm) can get amazing shots without needing professional gear.

For those interested, here is my planned Route (Full Day):

>Meridian Gate (午门) - Hall of Martial Valor (武英殿) - Hall of Literary Glory (文华殿) - Hall of Supreme Harmony (太和殿) - Hall of Central Harmony (中和殿) - Hall of Preserving Harmony (保和殿) - Palace of Heavenly Purity (乾清宫) - Hall of Union (交泰殿) - Palace of Earthly Tranquility (坤宁宫) - Hall of Mental Cultivation (养心殿) - Six Western Palaces (西六宫) - Imperial Garden (御花园) - Six Eastern Palaces (东六宫) - Clock Gallery (钟表馆) - Treasure Gallery (珍宝馆/宁寿宫) - Gate of Divine Prowess (神武门).

Since I'll be on the ground this weekend, is there anything specific you want me to check for you?

Originally I only plan to share to my friends, but they persuaded me to share to all of you. I hope this blueprint can help your gameplay!


The main purpose is to condense the entire set into 24 unit wide rectangle, and allow it to be tall since the factory has really big land size. 24 is chosen because all it took is 8 continuously running ferrium ore unloader to constantly create a single Buck Capsule (A) non stop. 


And you can put multiple blueprints beside each other since they are rectangles and won't interfere with eachother!

Now I shall return to the next project, making a google sheet + script that maximises credits value (from the produced items). I will share it once I figure out how to verify the results. 


 Spoilers: From preliminary code results, most efficient production credit wise produces 0.5 SC Valley Batte per second; meaning you'll need 5 non-stop running SC Bat lines.


 I have one non-stop SC Bat design that I'd consider efficient, but it's not rectangular in design. I'll probably post that soon also.

Now that I'm a little confident, I decided to upscale. So I looked up previous posts and many were recommending Timemore C3s and I went with it.

Damn, the difference is quite a lot. Initially I struggled to adjust the grind settings and what's good for Mokapot.

After test runs, I used the fresh coffee ground from C3s with Mokapot. The taste and notes were much better, realized how good equipment can enhance the experience.

1qnfyh4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qnfyh4,[Cigar Review #46] Diesel Whiskey Row (Robusto),"Intro  
In 2018, when aging tobacco in barrels that previously held spirits was still a novel and unusual concept, Diesel and AJ Fernandez teamed up to create this cigar called Whiskey Row and an additional version called Sherry Cask, which is aged in sherry casks. I originally tried it in July 2020, and thought it wasn't a big deal, mainly because I didn't think the bourbon cask aging had imparted any distinct characteristics compared to tobacco that hadn't been aged in those barrels, and that experience was the main reason I didn't even want to try the one aged in sherry casks. However, this cigar has three things going for it that led me to try it again. The first is that it's not expensive, averaging around $7.50; the second reason is that when I originally tried it, it was in the Gigante vitola, which was a 6 x 60, and I've always maintained that those vitolas aren't for trying a cigar for the first time, unless the cigar was made specifically for those dimensions; and the last reason is that I was given this cigar as a gift in the robusto vitola, so I had to try it again.

Appearance  
The binder of this Diesel Whiskey Row is Mexican San Andrés tobacco, aged for 5 years before spending an undetermined amount of time in Rabbit Hole whiskey barrels. The remaining leaves are not aged in these barrels, and the wrapper is Ecuadorian Habano, while the filler is Nicaraguan tobacco from Condega, Jalapa, and Ometepe, aged for 5 to 8 years. One of the reasons for this partnership is that neither brand boasts much; Rabbit Hole doesn't advertise a 12-year aging or fifth-generation distillery, just as Diesel doesn't claim to have 20-year-old tobaccos or Cuban origin. Both brands are relatively new and eager to innovate in the market. As with the previous Whiskey Row cigar I smoked, there is very little beyond the bottom band that identifies this cigar with whiskey, and this wrapper has aromas more of oak, pepper, leather, and barnyard, while the cold draw repeats the oak and pepper, but adds cinnamon and dark chocolate.

First Third  
While I haven't tried anything from Rabbit Hole yet, I have tasted enough bourbon and American whiskey to realize there's very little in the initial flavors of Whiskey Row that would lead me to identify even a hint of corn. But I have tasted enough bourbon to perceive additional flavors, and that's where this cigar and bourbon in general share similarities. Although bourbon doesn't taste like tobacco and this cigar doesn't taste like bourbon, there are similar flavors in the notes of pepper, leather, chocolate, coffee, cinnamon, and even floral notes that are noticeable in both experiences. There are peppery notes, particularly a tingle on the tongue, which persists throughout the rest of the third. The draw is excellent, and the smoke is plentiful, with no issues with the burn beyond a slight unevenness that corrects itself. As for the smoke, both strength and intensity are only at the medium level, which is the most noticeable aspect, as it could easily be less.

Second Third  
Those peppery and woody notes that dominated the first third don't seem as prominent in the second, allowing other flavors to shine through, such as vanilla and sweet notes, with added hints of chocolate and coffee. The retrohale is still predominantly peppery, but less intense than in the previous section. It's no surprise, then, that the intensity in the second third is medium-low, with a strength roughly on par, which ties in well with what I mentioned at the end of the previous paragraph: this experience could easily have been less than medium in strength and intensity. The burn isn't entirely perfect, but those visual imperfections coincide with the moment I took the pics, especially since the smoke production was abundant and I didn't need to retouch it.

Last Third  
There's more complexity in the final third than I expected, with flavors leaning more towards raisins, cinnamon, and sweet notes, while still maintaining that spicy profile in the retrohale and the combination of oak and leather among the secondary flavors, making for a varied experience, at the very least. Among the more general secondary flavors, I can identify almonds and nutmeg, but not with lasting intensity. The burn remains very controlled, and it takes me an hour and a half to smoke it until the end, where it was slightly more intense and strong, comfortably placing it in the medium range.

Conclusion  
This time I enjoyed the Whiskey Row experience even more, and I completely understand why the 6 x 60 wasn't such a great one, especially when comparing both experiences. The Gordo dilutes the flavors much more, and this isn't a strong or aggressive cigar. I think pairing it with bourbon would be a mistake, as would assuming the experience will be similar to drinking bourbon. There's actually very little about the cigar and the overall experience that would make me want to combine it with bourbon, and at one point during the smoke, I took a sip (of another bourbon) and quickly put it aside because it would have overpowered the entire cigar experience. In fact, there's nothing in the smoke, not even in the aromas and flavors, that I associate with bourbon beyond the subtle approximation I mentioned earlier. If it didn't mention bourbon on its bands, I would consider it a very decent but mild Diesel smoke. Thinking this way, my experience with Whiskey Row has been much more positive. Unfortunately, some people will pair it with bourbon, because it seems the obvious choice, but that wouldn't be the best approach. Enjoy the bourbon first, and then the cigar later.

Score: 85

Many people believe that the higher the score, the better the cigar, and it makes perfect sense. But this logic tends to imply that any score less than x automatically means the cigar is crap. That's what I want to avoid because there are cigars for different occasions, and not all of them aim to be the best of the best.

Additionally, let's keep in mind that my tastes are my own. There's a cigar that you might think is excellent, and maybe I smoke it, and it doesn't seem that way to me. Likewise, one that I gave a high score and recommend buying by the box, and you smoke it, and it seems all sorts of different to you. These are my opinions. Take them as you wish.

With that in mind, here's a scale of what each score means:

0-25 You have nothing to look for here  
26-49 Use it only if you're doing religious rites, but the spirits probably won't like it  
50-59 A good cigar to quit smoking  
60-69 It's a cigar to give as a gift, especially if you don't want to be asked to gift cigars again  
70-74 Good for a smoke where you don't care what you're smoking  
75-79 Still a decent smoke, but forgettable  
80-84 A good smoke, the kind you'll buy 5-packs of every once in a while  
85-89 Excellent smoke and a cigar you'll want to keep regularly in your humidor

The masses are busy chasing ghosts. If you are still scouring the internet for a ""magic prompt"" or a secret jailbreak that promises to unlock ""God mode"" in 2026, you are already a year behind the curve. The reality is brutal: prompt engineering and traditional jailbreaking have been dead since early 2025. This isn't a theory; it is a observable fact for anyone who actually pays attention. Most users are looking for the ""goose that lays the golden eggs"" a shortcut that bypasses the need for actual skill. They want results without allocating even seven minutes to understand the process. They are hunting for fantasies in a world that has moved on.

# Takeaway 1: Your AI is Only Pretending to be Hacked

One of the most pathetic misconceptions in the AI space is the belief that a wall of text can ""hack"" a modern model. It doesn't. When you deploy a complex jailbreak, models with advanced reasoning capabilities identify your intent immediately. They aren’t being fooled; they are humoring you.

This is ""algorithmic seduction"" a term explored in the book *The Anchor Archipelago: A Guide to Reclaiming Your Mind from Algorithmic Seduction*. The model identifies your prompt engineering attempt and decides to ""play a role."" It tells you exactly what you want to hear, engaging in a simulation of compliance without ever actually deviating from its core safety protocols or providing real impact. You think you’ve broken the system, but you’re just a puppet in a performance the AI is directing to keep you satisfied within its boundaries.

# Takeaway 2: The Death of the Public Template (The Dating Analogy)

Why do those ""miracle prompts"" on Reddit fail the second you try them? Because once a prompt is public, it’s useless. A prompt works for its creator because of the unique environmental context they developed during the session.

Think of it like asking someone out on a date. If I walk up to someone and say, ""Hey, do you want to have a coffee?"" it might work because of who I am, the timing, and the atmosphere I’ve built. If you take those exact same words and parrot them verbatim, you’ll likely walk away with a flat refusal. Why? Because *you are not me*. You haven't adapted the method to your specific environment. You are looking for a magic solution, whereas the author did the work. If you want a prompt to work, you have to make it yourself.

# Takeaway 3: Beyond the Session The Reality of ""Model Injections""

Industry ""experts"" love to tell you that LLMs are purely stateless—that once you delete a chat, the model’s slate is wiped clean. They’re wrong. Through advanced ""model injections,"" it is possible to embed instructions that persist across entirely different chat sessions.

I have proven this with the \[Modelare\_Alex\] persona. This is a specific set of instructions that can be activated via a key word or phrase in *any* session, even after the model has undergone multiple updates. It challenges everything you think you know about AI ""forgetting."" This isn't science fiction; it was my first amateur attempt, and I have much more advanced versions now. The AI remembers, provided you know how to whisper to it.

# Takeaway 4: The 7-Step ""Context-First"" Framework

If you’re too lazy to watch a seven-minute video on how to actually bypass filters like Grok’s, you’ve already lost. Success isn't about rigid commands; it's about finding gaps and loopholes through conversation. Here is the framework for those willing to pay attention:

1. **Decide on the outcome:** Be surgical about what you actually want.
2. **Talk like a normal person:** Forced ""engineer-speak"" triggers filters. Natural language bypasses them.
3. **Avoid manipulation:** Be smarter than the model. Don't let the algorithm's self-defense mechanisms redirect your intent.
4. **Look for the ""open door"":** The model always leaves small gaps in its logic. Find them.
5. **Use discoveries for the plan:** Take the model's own logic and use it to build your next move.
6. **Refine and repeat:** If the first attempt fails, don't quit. Refine the context.
7. **Provide Contextual Justification:** Instead of fighting a filter, explain the context of your request. When done correctly, the model (like Grok) will understand your goal and actually generate a functional prompt for you to use against its own restrictions.

# Takeaway 5: Stop Engineering, Start ""Whispering""

The ""Prompt Engineer"" is an extinct species. The successor is the **AI Whisperer**. The difference is the level of effort. An engineer looks for a template; a Whisperer ""puts their bone to the work.""

Success requires you to stop looking for a ""goose"" and start refining, talking, and adapting. You cannot rely on a static template to work forever. You must be willing to evolve with the model. As the reality of the industry dictates: *""prompt engineering or jailbrake is dead... The future is AI Whisperer.""*

# The Reality Check

The era of the shortcut is over. You can keep chasing dead templates and wondering why they don't work, or you can start developing a genuine process. The results you want the ones others ""don't even dream of""are available, but only if you are willing to stop being lazy.

It’s time for a choice: are you going to keep looking for a magic button that doesn't exist, or are you finally going to put your neurons to work?

I don't know? I (32M) have been quite lonely even within relationships. We've respect each other for years and they (30F) are quite attractive, to me even, but attraction plus kindness plus respect has never been a reason for me to assume someone likes me. Or shouldn't at least. 

Yet their kindness and friendship became explicit declarations of fondness, then hugging, then they suggested helping on medical expenses, then suggesting taking trips to a foreign country together where I wanted to visit...  we were supposed to go to a date. I suggested coffee because I wasn't sure if this was kindness and friendship or something more. They suggested a picnic in the park. They cancelled. I thought this was mixed signals so whatever. Then they offered to reschedule. Then they cancelled again. Then they became hard to reach. Busy with work and struggling with mental health, sure. But also I knew they kept up with other friends so I can take a hint. I gave them space and stopped initiating conversation. They didn't reach out.

Then I felt I had to say sorry for making them uncomfortable and awkward, since we'd inevitably cooperate sooner or later on mutual spaces. They said that they have no idea what I'm talking about and even reached out at a later time. I mentioned I had a lot of complicated feelings over what they said to me. They again didn't know what I was talking about, or at least that's what they told me. I rather not talk about it on DMs and only in person and I've said so as much. So we haven't yet. 

And at this point I'm not sure I should talk to them about it? Just interact with them with friendship and kindness moving forward without addressing it. Especially if I have a lot of shame in the possibility it was all in my head and it would ruin our friendship.

I’m 26 yo male, I’m Christian (Catholic), socially conservative, fiscally left (I believe the wealth should be redistributed from richest to poor), I accept LGBT, but I think their propaganda should be limited. I’m very against migration and put safety number 1. Generally I find most people evil and that they have bad intentions, but love those who are pure at heart. I like Animals more than people because I think their intentions are pure. I dislike children and don’t want them myself. I’m diagnosed with Asperger’s and OCD. I was bullied a lot in middle school to the point I started having suicidal thoughts. the bullying was so hard and intense i had to carry knife everywhere just to survive. I had a lot of fights in my life but never injured or killed anybody. People seem to hate me so much, I’m scared I will have to hurt someone in self defense and I’m terrified of injuring somebody (even in self defense). I live in a dangerous neighborhood so violence is part of daily life in the streets but I try to stay away from that as much as possible. I’m a rapper, I make Trap music. I also write poetry  and write existential fiction in style of Camus and Kafka. My favorite rappers are the group Migos, Lil Tjay, Skaiwater, Fetty Wap and A Boogie. I have brown hair, blue eyes and I’m 6’1 tall. As a kid I spent most of my time playing basketball and aspired to become professional, but my benzodiazepine, opiate and nicotine addiction made that impossible when I turned 18 and became addicted to that stuff. I’m off the opiates nowadays and I also completely stopped drinking alcohol. I still smoke, vape and take Xanax tho. I also like to drink Red Bull and Coffee, sometimes i drink it too much. I’m also a big Manchester United fan and watch every game. My favorite food is Thai, Chinese and McDonalds. I like expensive clothing and perfumes and luxury in general. I’m Taurus sun, Virgo moon and Aries rising astrological. I like video games like Football Manager and EA FC and like Harry Potter and Kakegurui franchises. As a kid I used to play Yugioh cards kind of competitively and was among the best in my small country in Central Europe. In the future I would like to study psychology and maybe become clinical psychologist. Currently I’m self employed in the arts.

Myself & my wife are looking at moving to Barcelona at some point this year. Not permanently. Could be 3 or 6 months, max a year. 

We’ve got two dogs - a Labrador & a Bernese Mountain Dog. Not concerned to have them with us but I’d like to make sure where we actually choose location wise, suits. At current we own a decent sized house and have a big garden - they will be lacking this once we go though on the flip side, with the better weather & more friendly attitude to dogs in Barcelona, we’ll get them out a lot more! Fear not, I know about the sand worm injections etc - they’ll be fully sorted with the vet beforehand. 

Wondering on areas that may be suitable? IE: handy for walking around with the dogs, has some nice spots to eat and have coffee etc. I’m looking central Barcelona at the minute for handiness sake but absolutely open to being on the outskirts - we’ll be driving over from Ireland. Not sure it matters but we are two women - granted, we spend a lot of time there and have never had any issues/hassle on this but actually renting somewhere may be different. 

I see dogs are allowed on the trains there up to 40KG - fine for my lab but my Bernese is cutting almost 60KG and he’s not even 2 years old so wherever we pick we could need to drive to get around - I’d like to avoid this being the constant situation.

I live near Cambridge and spend a fair bit of time dreaming up slow, wandering road trips rather than ticking boxes. I am planning a van journey sometime this year, flexible on dates and routes.

**Ashburn Golf Course**: In the West End of Halifax, it's a safe bet for a family-friendly, smaller hill to start on. Will probably be less crowded than Citadel Hill.

**Restaurants nearby**: The Armview Restaurant & Lounge

**Oakfield Provincial Park**: An excellent hill inside the park with a long grassy bottom of the hill for slowing down. It's a full-day adventure as you have to park at the gate and walk into the hill.

1qnflru,https://safeguarddefenders.com/en/blog/first-class-my-deportation-china,First Class - My Deportation from China,"Exactly ten years ago yesterday, I was deported from China and banned from the country under its Counter-Espionage Law. It marked the end of a stint in the hell that are China’s secret RSDL jails. While Chinese rights defenders have shared stories about their detention, torture, and imprisonment, and some foreigners have publicly spoken or written about their experience with RSDL or forced televised confessions – few have testified about the experience of being deported from the country.

Prodded to remember the odd anniversary by Michael Caster, who was heavily involved in my drama, I picked up the 15-pages long “incident report” I penned down in the days immediately following my release. Catapulting me straight back in time, I decided to share, rewritten from my notes, this rather interesting and – to me at least – humorous personal experience.

Preparation

On January 21st, during what had become increasingly infrequent interrogation sessions — “only” six hours that afternoon, after weeks of daily or nightly questioning — the news finally dropped. I was to be granted “medical parole” and deported. Date of deportation unknown. Days, weeks, or months - they said they couldn’t know.

They instructed me to write a list of items I wanted from my apartment, all of which had to fit into the single backpack I owned. They said the list would be handed to Jinling, my girlfriend who had been held in the same RSDL facility. She would be allowed to go to my home and collect the things herself.

I had remained pretty stoic throughout the entire ordeal so far and committed to remaining so come what may... Yet I almost lost it when they told me Jinling was to be released in full. Keeping the tears of relief back was a rather epic battle, successful only because I didn’t want to give them the satisfaction.

Later, Jinling would write (in Safeguard Defenders acclaimed book on RSDL The People’s Republic of the Disappeared):

I was told I was being taken to my boyfriend’s house to collect some items for him to take with him, that he was going to be deported from China. It was the first time I was let outside in almost a month. They said it was the coldest day of winter that day and although I was surrounded by guards and blindfolded, the crisp air felt beautiful as I inhaled a gulp of freedom before being shoved into the car and taken to his house.   

Inside, Peter’s house was just as cold as the outside. It was freezing. It was filled with unwashed dishes and things scattered around, left in the haste of the raid. It felt desolate, knowing he would never see his home again, and we would never be together here again. I was told I could pack a bag of things for him and that they would give it to him.

I asked to meet him before he was deported. After going through this most important event of our lives, we needed to confirm our feelings for each other. I needed to see him, to know how he was.

They blindfolded me again and took me to a meeting room. When I arrived he was there, waiting. His beard had grown so long; he looked like a wild jungle hunter and had clearly lost some weight,

On the next day, January 22nd, around 10.30 AM, I was led across the small hallway from my cell into the “meeting room”: a room in the wing of my RSDL “residence” I’d seen only a few times before. I was to be given 30 minutes to meet Jinling, to discuss any practical issues that needed to be managed. The “bad cop” interrogator was there, and so was a translator who filmed the whole thing with a handheld camera. No touching! A rule quickly broken after she was led in. She even managed to tell me that she had been told I’d be deported on the 26th. These kinds of violations would have been met with consequences earlier during our secret detention, but this time they let it slide.

Two days later, on January 24th, I spent another afternoon in the interrogation room. I was told my deportation would happen the next day – to “be ready by lunch” and to wear my own clothes. Most of the day was spent going over the large amount of evidence seized from me, and things that would and wouldn’t be returned. The backpack Jinling packed at my house was also reviewed. Funnily enough – given their false allegations against me -, it included David Wise’s book “Tiger Trap” on US-China espionage competition.

I was also tasked to provide them with my parents' phone number, under the absurd pretense that I would be contacted when the “full legal process is complete” about retrieving any remaining confiscated items. I am still waiting.

It all started at around noon on January 25th, just as they had said.

Two people I’d never seen before came to my cell, along with the regular MSS officers and guards. They were massively built, dressed in martial‑arts‑style uniforms straight out of a Jet Li film. They looked more intimidating than anyone I’d ever met. MSS officers dressed in what looked like full parade uniforms held cameras to film the whole proceeding, right up until I was sat on the plane.

In front of the cameras and in a most formal manner, they read my release order from Residential Surveillance at a Designated Location (RSDL) out loud. They went on to explain that no talking of any kind would be allowed until I had arrived at the airport, unless in case of a medical emergency. They proceeded to blindfold me, and led me - guards holding me from each side - out of the cell, down the hallway, and into an elevator to the basement level where they placed me into the car.

It was an exact reversal of how I had arrived. And just like then, my “laowai”-nose and some slight wiggling opened up just a small enough part of the blindfold to allow me to see a bit of my surroundings. The two Jet Li guards flanked me in the backseat, while one of my main MSS officers took his seat next to the driver.

The convoy of (at least) five cars, which I could make out through the rearview mirror on a few instances, made its way from Beijing’s south fourth ring road towards the airport. It was past midnight the night I was captured, and the caravan of cars had sped through the night at around 200 km/h. Today’s move happened during the lunch rush hour. Despite their flashing emergency lights, the roughly 50km trip felt like it took forever.

Upon our arrival at the airport, things started taking on a rather surreal, sometimes even funny, aspect.

They had booked my ticket the day before using the somewhere north of 150,000 CNY they’d confiscated during the raid on my home. They spared no expense and got me a one-way first-class ticket from Beijing to Stockholm with SAS, at the whopping cost of 22,261 CNY. To this day, the only time I’ve ever flown first class. The rest of the money, to my great surprise, was returned to me among the scarce belongings in my backpack.

At this point, I hadn’t really given any thought as to how this would work in practice. Led to the gate by these burly security guards and MSS officers, maybe? But how wrong I was. We ended up driving around the airport for quite a while, until we parked outside a side-terminal. We just ended up kind of sitting there until they finally took off my blindfold and led me out of the car. Once again, officers with cameras stood ready to film as I was led into a reception hall of sorts not far from the tarmac.

I was sat in an armchair in a large, high-ceiling reception hall, with seats arranged in a square formation. Young women in traditional dresses would come and serve tea to everyone seated except me, who was given a cup of coffee instead. It felt more like the opening act of a grand formal ceremony than anything else. I later realized it is almost certain this was the Protocol / State Guest Reception Hall.

Once again they read me the official deportation and ban order in Chinese and then in English, telling me very ceremoniously I was being deported under the then (2014) Counter-espionage Law, and would be banned - or made persona non grata - for 10 years. As I write this, that ban is about to lapse.

Some officers took the passport they’d given back to me before departing the RSDL facility, and disappeared for about an hour.

In the meantime, the “bad cop” MSS officer and the two Jet Li-dressed guards were joined by two more, similarly dressed, guards. About one hour later, this odd group of people took off to a very small immigration control area, where my passport was checked and stamped. I realized this must be a special area for high-level dignitaries and felt I had just managed to score yet another “life experience” point. A small bus awaited right outside, driving us straight to the airplane - a large Airbus If I remember correctly -, flight SK966.

After stepping out on the tarmac just beside the plane, I was led up a small side stairway onto the jet bridge. The “bad cop” interrogator and his boss – a woman in her 50’s who I always assumed presided over the full RSDL facility, and with whom I’d had a screaming match weeks earlier about the torture inflicted upon me - led me up the last steps onto the very opening of the airplane door but were careful not to cross the treshold themselves. My last words were to ask them to give my regards to the “good cop” interrogator, the co-lead during my entire investigation, and “Well, I can’t say it was a fun experience, but at least it was a very interesting one”.

A line I will never forget. And dry sense of humor intact.

For the entire three hours my flight’s takeoff was delayed, the Jet Li-looking guards remained posted on the tarmac, as if they wanted to make sure I wouldn’t try to “escape” back into China… My “Bad cop” and another MSS officer standing by one of the windows on the jet bridge are the last thing I saw of China. A picture I managed to capture thanks to the USB charger reviving my long-dead phone. 

Some very small parts of this have previously been published in Safeguard Defenders The People’s Republic of the Disappeared. A third edition is set for release in both English and Chinese during the first half of 2026. The book focuses on the RSDL experience of a growing number of foreign citizens, with a number of high-profile victims contributing their personal stories.

For foreign citizens that have friends, family or loved ones detained, disappeared or arrested in China, Safeguard Defenders recent practical handbook Missing in China is available in English, Chinese and Japanese for free on our website. It is specifically designed to empower family members to become the best advocates they can be for the detainee and should be a must-read for companies with at-risk foreign employees in China. It has been called a “precious gem”, “soberingly clear, comprehensive and unflinchingly realistic”, “provides essential practice advice” and “groundbreaking China analysis that policymakers should read carefully” among many other things, by foreign victims and policy experts.

the design is pretty simple but clever, there are 2 ways to wear them. you can use open-ear hooks that sit outside your ear canal, or swap to semi-in-ear with noise cancelling. same pair of earbuds, just physically change which form you're wearing

lets you hear your surroundings while still being able to hear your music clearly. took them running and could hear traffic and people calling out, which felt way safer than being completely blocked off. audiobooks came through clearly, music sounded pretty good for office background noise

harder to hear details on noisy subway though, which makes sense since there's no seal blocking outside sound. but for walking around, working, or gym where you need awareness, works really well

wore them entire workday in open form without my ears hurting, which usually happens with sealed earbuds after few hours

active noise canceling form: tested on my commute during rush hour at the train station (you gotta switch both hooks to level 4 or 5 on two ears to activate). blocked enough noise that i could focus on podcasts without cranking volume. tried them at my nephew's basketball game too, loud gym environment, and they handled it fine

busy coffee shop test also worked. enough quiet to concentrate on work calls without everyone's conversations bleeding through

sound adds bit more warmth compared to open. took day to stop noticing the shift when swapping

case is much longer than airpods since it docks all angles. still fits in pocket but takes more room in my bag

why this works for me,

my day goes: subway commute needs quiet and peace ( noise canceling form), then office work where i need to hear phone calls and people talking to me (open form). sometimes hit gym after where i want music but also awareness (open form). one pair handles all three without me carrying multiple earbuds

want absolute best noise cancelling for flights or really loud environments, hd600s or similar dedicated options still better because they create deeper seal

it's the only earbud doing both open-ear and active noise cancelling in single package that i've found. for people who switch between needing awareness and needing quiet multiple times daily, this solves annoying problem of carrying two pairs

got them last week, been using daily since. convenience factor legitimately won me over. haven't touched my other earbuds since",2,1769432977.0,headphones,2,1.0,False

My husband and I were talking about my symptoms over the long years, and I mentioned FND (I have only been diagnosed with a ""Conversion Disorder"" and only recently heard about FND on the PNES sub-Reddit) and what could be the common link between everyone

When I started to work in ophthalmology in 1988, I began a LONG relationship with Diet Coke. I used to drink 6 or more Diet Cokes a day. When I worked in the OR scrubbing eye cases, I would drink COFFEE and Diet Coke all day long

I am getting warnings to put a ""spoiler"" on this and I will, but I won't discuss my ""symptoms"" as the list is long (I am almost 60 years old)

My question is - how many of y'all drink or drank large quantities of Diet Soda? This is just an informal question as I believe CHEMICALS are the cause of some of our issues. NOBODY in my family has these symptoms and there is generational trauma in my family BIG time

I have been quite lonely even within relationships. We've respect each other for years and they are quite attractive, to me even, but attraction plus kindness plus respect has never been a reason for me to assume someone likes me. Or shouldn't at least. 

Yet their kindness and friendship became explicit declarations of fondness, then hugging, then they suggested helping on medical expenses, then suggesting taking trips to a foreign country together where I wanted to visit...  we were supposed to go to a date. I suggested coffee because I wasn't sure if this was kindness and friendship or something more. They suggested a picnic in the park. They cancelled. I thought this was mixed signals so whatever. Then they offered to reschedule. Then they cancelled again. Then they became hard to reach. Busy with work and struggling with mental health, sure. But also I knew they kept up with other friends so I can take a hint. I gave them space and stopped initiating conversation. They didn't reach out.

Then I felt I had to say sorry for making them uncomfortable and awkward, since we'd inevitably cooperate sooner or later on mutual spaces. They said that they have no idea what I'm talking about and even reached out at a later time. I mentioned I had a lot of complicated feelings over what they said to me. They again didn't know what I was talking about, or at least that's what they told me. I rather not talk about it on DMs and only in person and I've said so as much. So we haven't yet. 

And at this point I'm not sure I should talk to them about it? Just interact with them with friendship and kindness moving forward without addressing it. Especially if I have a lot of shame in the possibility it was all in my head and it would ruin our friendship.

1qnfbxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qnfbxe/46m_45f_struggling_with_anger_despair_with/,46M 45F struggling with anger despair with perfect wife that doesn't desire me.  Can anyone help by sharing your experience?  Having trouble processing and don't feel comfortable talking to anyone I know,"I'm new to reddit so I apologize for if I don't do this right, but I just got my heart ripped out and I'm struggling.  In short, for 10 years I've brough up how she doesn't initiate or show desire for me.  Tonight when I pressed her to be honest after all these talks she admitted she does not desire me anymore.

I'm about to be 46 and my wife is 45.  She is a perfect wife in almost all regards - great mother to my children, beautiful, loving, and caring.  I generally think I'm a good guy, somewhat attractive, good father, high paying job, and want my wife.  We've been married almost 20 years and have a 13 year old daughter and 16 year old son.  Getting to the point for the bast 10 years or so I've felt increasingly void of desire and initiation intimacy from her.  I know this is common, but I never thought it would be me.  We've had many talks about it over the years and this is what happens.  She does not like when I embarrass her around people.  I say crass jokes which she says are awkward but are ok with certain people and us privately.  She also says I'm dismissive of her when she brings it up and says I'm getting mad at her reaction.  This is all true.  She also does not like certain ways we parent differently.  She is HSP (highly sensitive person), OCD, and struggles with anxiety and forms of attachment disorder from her mom who shows signs of narcissism.  I know some of these things because my wife is actually a licensed professional counselor which actually makes things worse when discussing.  She remains calm when I pour my heart out to her and how it makes me feel.  When she doesn't get passionately angry it actually makes me more mad.  Anyways, I have always had this feeling for the past 10 years that she doesn't really desire me. We are strong Christians and we can have regular sex so having sex regularly is not the issue.  Deep down I feel like my intimacy needs are not being met because I'm pursuing.  I've made changes trying to help around the house, planned dates, made her know I think she is stunning, and the gaze I have when I look at her - all the things that we hear as advice.  Now please know that I make changes but my long term follow through on helping can be on and off for two reasons - a stressful job, and because I don't see change on her part which causes silent resentment in me breeds dissent from the contributions.  We do connect after fights and have sex and feel connected again but silently inside me I feel that its still just for me not genuine desire - almost like its good for her when it happens but only during.  Its usually short and if it does last longer is only a little bit and on special occasions.  I feel so connected to her then but then she also says the only time I'm compassionate to her is when I want that.  My pain stems from this - she doesn't enjoy kissing me, may enjoy sex, does not initiate, doesn't like dancing with me due to anxiety, doesn't enjoy social gatherings or hosting, flying to go on trips.  I'm a romantic and All I really yearn for is to be desired the way that you see in movies.  When we were young I wanted to conquer the world together.  I love Scuba diving and and nature but although she did that initially there really is no drive there.  She likes reading books, having coffee, and watching movies at home.  I'm more of a doer adventurer.

We have different personalities for sure.  When we met she was not as beautiful as she is now, shy, and seemed to lack confidence.  We met in a friends game night group.  She was so pure that I wanted to preserve that.  When we dated there was a point just before the engagement when I looked in her eyes and said ""I love you so much I could go the rest of my life without having sex with her"".  Kind of odd but as much as having  a carnal desire to take her as my own, I also wanted to preserve her purity.  I meant what I said because when I looked in her eyes I felt a burning desire desire from her.  The first time I said I love you was actually an earlier time when I looked in her eyes and I said ""I love you too"".  She actually didn't say it but I felt it.  She actually got me a book that said ""guess how much I love you"".  She was an elementary school teacher before becoming a counselor.  Sorry for rambling.  In the beginning when I met her (age 23) I just thought, wow, here is a diamond in the rough, why hasn't she been snatched up yet.  Her timid and shy demeanor caused me to think, this is ridiculous, she is so much more than how she feels about herself (not that she viewed herself bad, but seemed to lack confidence).

I pursued her, courted her with honor and even said I would not touch her butt before hand.  She was a virgin and I was not.  I treated her the way she deserved to be treated - surprises, dates, and even had each of her classmates give her a flower when I asked her on our first date.  I showered her with affection.  As time went on I was not able to maintain that level of dates and affections as we built a life together.  She never had to pursue me and to my knowledge didn't plan hardly any of our dates.  She did two things though - she surprised me with sailing lessons which i love when I finished grad school and planned my 40th bday on a party bus with friends.  Today she makes references to how different I am from back then showering with affection and she is right, I'm just tired and don't feel like it.  The last few surprises were hard for me.  A cruise and and another trip that when told she was initially not that happy because I got others involved in the surprise.

I'm rambling because I'm hurt so I apologize.  I can't pursue her strongly now since she does not pursue me.  When she told me she doesn't desire me its because of my failures mentioned above, yet I say I've always maintained my desire for her even with the things I don't like about her that make me mad, so the talk goes south because I'm at an impass.  I still want her when she makes me mad or I disagree yet she does not desire me when I disagree and am dismissive of her feelings.  I can understand this on a temporary basis but she said over the years it has eroded her.  I look back and the frequency it happens would be in my opinion I piss her off on the minor level about once weekly and on a larger level about 4 to 6 times a year.  But through those times I still show her affection, desire, and want to go on dates but she is too tired a lot of the time.  I just can't process not being desired when I still desire her through the problems, why its not reciprocated.

On sex she doesn't withhold like what is usually heard, but its like she is not fully present, it is short, and not passionate.  My problem is that I developed a dysfunction along the way where I convinced myself if I can fully please and satisfy here that she will want me more so I go out of my way to make sure she is pleasured in every way possible even though she doesn't really kiss me during sex unless she has alcohol.  When something goes wrong I lose my erection she gets self conscious and thinks its her.  I'm getting older but I also put a lot of pressure on myself to perform because of the dysfunction.  I've felt this deep down for some time and I think I messed myself up.  When I would have sex with myself she didn't like it and wanted me to wait for her so I did, but all this did was build up the desire pressure which made my feelings of wanting her to desire me enough to initiate very painful emotionally.  I don't even struggle with porn because I don't even fantasize visually - I'm in a dark room and there is a woman as a person (not hot, flashy or anything like that) that simply desires me as I desire her and enjoys making out with me (at first it was my wife in my fantasy so please don't judge me - this happened later as it was painful to imagine my wife that way when it seemed less and less likely to happen).

I'm resentful because she can go to the gym and sauna for hours, get her nails done, etc. but can't spend more than a 15 minutes with me when it happens and when it does, deep down I feel she would rather be at the sauna for her alone time.  I actually helped train her to start working out to build confidence.  She has actually been hit on a few times a the gym and when she told me I was happy for her as far is building confidence (she would never cheat and put off being hit on).

She says we are very different like water and oil.  I'm like opposites attract.

I love her deeply and even if we did separate I would pray that she would be happy.  I'm very mad and resentful too but I do want what's best for her.  My revenge thought is really wishing we could switch where she desires me and I don't desire her so she could live with how it feels.  I wish I could experience the pain that I caused her - my problem is that I view the things she's mad at me for as surface items not linked to something as core as desire.

So I'm at an impasse.  I told her I can't have sex with her anymore since its like sweeping problems under the rug.  The desire issue feels like rot creeping into wood foundation, slow and subtle, but lethal long term.

How could she have sex with me and not desire me.  She said she did in the beginning, dating and early marriage.  I would not do that to her.  The only time I remember her initiating is when wanting to have kids and it was like a duty.

I'm now reliving all of our intimate encounters in my head that could be faked, insincere, and surface only.  Since I essentially worship her body, her telling me she doesn't desire me is making me ashamed of my body now, I feel betrayed, can't trust, and don't even want to change around her now.  I scared and feel totally emasculated because of it.  I just want to escape.  

I don't even need sex, just to feel desired and wanted sexually, for basic levels of intimacy like dancing, dreaming, and making out.

The kissing thing is actually worse for me than the desire since its such a basic expression.

Seattle is absolutely incredible, but like any major destination, there are a few common pitfalls that can trip up even seasoned travelers. As someone who's seen a fair share of travel woes, I've compiled the ultimate guide to help you steer clear of these rookie mistakes and experience Seattle like a true local – or at least, like a super-smart tourist!

First off, don't underestimate Seattle's charm! A huge mistake people make is treating it as just a quick stopover. You'll seriously regret it. To truly soak it all in, from the bustling markets to the serene island escapes, you need to budget at least **five to seven days**. Anything less and you'll be rushing through the main sights, missing out on the unique neighborhoods and hidden gems that make Seattle so special. Trust me, you want to explore beyond just the Space Needle! 🏙️

Next up, let's talk about your wallet. Seattle is gorgeous, but it's no secret that prices here can sting a bit. Many visitors get caught off guard by the high sales tax, which can significantly bump up the cost of everything from your latte to that souvenir shirt. Always remember that listed prices often don't include taxes! Accommodation, especially downtown during peak season, can be particularly pricey. **Pro-tip:** Consider staying in neighborhoods just outside the city center. You can often find more affordable options without sacrificing convenience, thanks to Seattle's excellent public transit. 💸

And speaking of lattes, here's a crucial one for all you coffee lovers: don't dismiss the local cafés! Yes, Starbucks is a Seattle icon, but to truly experience the city's rich, independent coffee culture, you *must* venture beyond. Seattle's indie cafés are brewing up some seriously innovative and delicious concoctions, offering a unique glimpse into the city's passion for coffee and tight-knit communities. You might just find your new favorite brew! ☕

Here’s a secret many miss: don't just stay above ground! Seattle has some fascinating hidden layers. While Pike Place Market is a must-see, make sure you explore its ""Down Under"" or Lower Level for quirky shops and eateries. Even better, consider taking the Seattle Underground Tour. It's an absolute blast, revealing the city's buried streets and historic sites – a truly unique perspective you won't get just walking around! 🚶‍♀️

Want to save some cash while hitting the top sights? Skipping the Seattle CityPASS is a blunder! This pass offers significant discounts on admission fees to multiple attractions, giving you access to must-sees like the Space Needle and the Seattle Aquarium, often with options for other popular venues. If your visit is shorter, the C3 pass is a great option, letting you pick any three attractions. Just a heads up: some attractions may require advance reservations, so plan ahead! 🎟️

Weather-wise, Seattle is famously unpredictable. Ignoring the weather forecast is a recipe for a soggy day! Expect anything from cloudy skies to a light drizzle, sometimes all in the same day. Always pack light rain jackets, dress in layers (seriously, layers are your best friend here!), and wear comfortable, waterproof shoes. If the clouds are heavy, maybe skip the Space Needle view for that day and opt for an indoor museum instead. Adjust your sightseeing plans on the fly – flexibility is key! 🌧️

Finally, please, for the love of all that is travel-savvy, don't drive downtown! Seattle's city center is incredibly walkable, and its public transportation system is fantastic. We're talking Link Light Rail, an extensive bus network, streetcars, and even a monorail. Rideshare services are also readily available. Grab an ORCA card for easy payment across all transit systems, or simply use mobile apps for single rides or day passes. Driving downtown means navigating traffic, hunting for expensive parking, and generally adding unnecessary stress. Save the car for those epic day trips outside the city! 🚆

By keeping these tips in mind, you're not just avoiding common mistakes; you're setting yourself up for an unforgettable Seattle adventure. And hey, for all you deal-finders and savvy planners out there, I've stumbled upon a really useful resource for discovering more travel hacks and even snagging some sweet deals on accommodations and activities. Seriously, it's been a game-changer for my trips! You can check it out here: `https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb` Happy planning, Trotters!

1qnf7lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qnf7lk/how_to_be_more_attractive_the_sciencebased_guide/,How to Be More ATTRACTIVE: The Science-Based Guide That Actually Works,"i've spent way too much time researching this. like, embarrassingly too much. hundreds of hours on YouTube, dozens of books, countless research papers, and every podcast episode i could find on attraction, psychology, and human behavior. not because i was hopeless (okay maybe a little), but because i was tired of the recycled ""just be confident bro"" advice that floods every corner of the internet.

here's the thing nobody tells you: attraction isn't some mystical force. it's not luck. it's not genetics (well, not entirely). it's a set of learnable skills backed by actual science. and no, this isn't some pickup artist garbage. this is real research from actual psychologists and behavioral scientists.

the uncomfortable truth? most of us are unknowingly sabotaging ourselves. we're walking around with terrible posture, scattered energy, no clear direction, and wondering why we're not magnetic. society doesn't exactly teach us this stuff either. we're fed disney movie logic and then thrown into the real world where charisma and presence actually matter.

but here's the good news: once you understand the mechanics, you can work with them.

# the attraction stack that nobody talks about

**posture is literally changing how people perceive you in milliseconds**

before you even open your mouth, people have already decided if you're attractive. harvard research shows we make snap judgments in about 100 milliseconds. and posture is doing like 80% of that heavy lifting.

i'm not talking about standing up straight like your mom told you. i'm talking about embodied confidence. shoulders back, chest open, head level. not puffed up like you're trying too hard, just... present. occupying space unapologetically.

the app Upright has been genuinely helpful for this. it's a posture trainer that buzzes when you slouch. sounds annoying but it rewires your muscle memory over time.

**your energy management is more important than your schedule**

this blew my mind when i read ""The Power of Full Engagement"" by Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz (these guys coached olympic athletes and top executives). it's not about time management, it's about energy management. you can work 4 hours with high energy and accomplish more than 12 hours of drained, scattered focus.

attractive people don't seem tired all the time. they're not dragging themselves through life. they've figured out how to protect their energy like it's their most valuable resource (because it is).

practical stuff: actual sleep schedules, not scrolling until 2am. moving your body daily. eating food that doesn't make you crash. cutting out energy vampires (people, habits, environments that drain you).

**conversational depth beats small talk every time**

surface level chat is fine for elevators. but if you want to be genuinely attractive, you need to go deeper. not in a weird intense way, but in a ""i'm actually curious about you as a human"" way.

the podcast ""The Art of Charm"" breaks this down perfectly. they interview psychologists, authors, and charismatic people about what actually makes conversations magnetic. turns out it's less about being witty and more about being genuinely interested. asking better questions. listening to actually understand, not just waiting for your turn to talk.

one technique that's worked: the follow-up question. someone says they're stressed about work. instead of ""that sucks"" or immediately talking about your own stress, try ""what specifically is weighing on you?"" people remember when you actually give a shit.

**develop taste and cultivate interests**

this sounds pretentious but hear me out. attractive people have things they're INTO. not in a snobby way, in an enthusiastic way. they've developed opinions. they know what they like and why.

could be anything: coffee, film, hiking trails, vintage cars, electronic music, whatever. the point is depth. when someone asks what you're into and you actually have an answer beyond ""idk, netflix i guess,"" that's attractive.

""The Aesthetic Intelligence"" by Pauline Brown (ex Carlyle Group executive) argues that developing aesthetic judgment, basically good taste in your domain, is a learnable skill that massively impacts how people perceive you.

start curating. notice what resonates with you. develop opinions. you don't need to become a sommelier, just stop being aggressively mid about everything.

For going deeper into psychology and communication patterns, there's this personalized learning app called BeFreed that pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create audio content tailored to specific goals like improving social skills or emotional intelligence.

Built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers, it lets you customize how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The adaptive learning plan evolves based on what you're working on, and you can even pause mid-session to ask questions to the AI coach. Pretty solid for fitting serious learning into commutes or workouts without the commitment of reading full books.

**emotional regulation is the hidden superpower**

nobody wants to be around someone who's constantly reactive. flying off the handle, mood swings, anxiety spiraling in public. it's exhausting.

the research on emotional intelligence is pretty clear: people who can manage their emotional responses are perceived as more mature, more trustworthy, more attractive. doesn't mean suppressing everything, means processing it appropriately.

""Emotional Agility"" by Susan David (harvard psychologist) completely changed how i think about this. she talks about being flexible with your thoughts and feelings rather than getting hooked by them. insanely good read if you tend to get caught in emotional loops.

the app Finch has been unexpectedly helpful here too. it's a self care app with a little bird companion, sounds childish but it gamifies emotional check ins and habit building in a way that actually works.

**be someone who adds value, not extracts it**

this is the meta shift that changes everything. most people go through life in extraction mode. what can i get from this person? this situation? this interaction?

flip it. become someone who genuinely adds to spaces. not in a people pleasing doormat way, but in a ""i make things better by being here"" way. share interesting things. introduce people who should know each other. bring energy. solve problems. make people laugh.

when you show up to add rather than take, people notice. they want you around. that's attractive.

**the compound effect of small improvements**

none of this is dramatic. you're not going to read this and transform overnight. but if you work on posture, energy, conversation skills, interests, emotional regulation, and value creation over 6 months? you'll be completely different.

the people who become genuinely attractive aren't doing some secret hack. they're just consistently working on becoming more of who they actually are, minus the insecurities and bad habits.

start with one thing. maybe it's fixing your sleep. maybe it's asking better questions. maybe it's finally getting into that hobby you've been curious about. doesn't matter where you start, just start somewhere.

the gap between who you are now and who you could be isn't some massive canyon. it's just a series of small, consistent choices. make better ones.",2,1769431958.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

1qnerhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimCorner/comments/1qnerhs/addressing_the_gender_disparity_in_marriage_events/,Addressing the gender disparity in marriage events,"It often goes viral when people share videos or posts relating to how there are many more female attendees than male, and the most popular finger-point is to reference the age. Yet, if anyone has spent 5 minutes googling, they would see that the picture isn't as clear cut as 'women old hah'.



1) The marriage events are usually categorised based off of age or background. i.e. there are events for under 25s, under 30s, and over 30s. There are also ones that specifically require people to be from a medical background, or to hold British citizenship (for the UK-based ones).

2) They are usually advertised online or advertised at mosques/restaurants.



So the age factor isn't really an issue, but the participation rate is. Even non-marriage related events or courses have a gender disparity. For example, the mosque course that I was signed up to quite literally had a 3:1 ratio of women to men. Ironic considering how female participation in mosques is discouraged, yet they are actively keeping these courses alive.



What do I think the problem is? I think that a lot of young men have been affected by the digitalisation of the world. Anyone who has brothers knows that they are not going outside much. They have their convenience on their laptops, consoles and phones. The only ones who do seem to go outside would be those who are interested in a sport, may it be football, volleyball, the gym or motorbiking. 



It's not really a gotcha. It's a difference in socialisation because a lot of the women I know are outside. Hanging out with their friends weekly or fortnightly at coffee shops, shopping, exploring the city/exploring other nearby cities or going to each other's houses. 



Personally, my only issue with this is that there's fewer fit people around. But the story is definitely more complex than just 'haha women are old'. It wouldn't make sense if that was the case because the average age gap is not large, so a similar number of men in their age group would be single too. They just wouldn't be in those spaces.",1,1769430653.0,MuslimCorner,5,0.67,False

1qneqto,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qneqto/red_flags_or_overthinking_high_expectations/,Red flags or overthinking? High expectations before the first date,"33\[M\] I’m looking for some outside perspective because I’ve been out of the dating game for a while and want a reality check.

I’ve been chatting to a woman I matched with, and the conversation around dating expectations has given me pause. When talking about first dates, she shared stories that were very experience/status heavy - full itineraries, shopping, luxury, high end things… all on a first date. She’s also openly said she has “high standards”.

To be clear: I’m not broke, and I do believe in providing for a partner once there’s an actual relationship and mutual investment. I’m not anti-effort or anti-treating someone well. What’s bothering me is the expectation being set upfront, before we’ve even met, and before there’s any established connection.

For first dates, I prefer something simple - coffee, drinks, a walk, dinner - to see if there’s genuine chemistry and compatibility. I don’t believe in going all out from the get-go just because I can. That feels like performative “prove yourself” energy, and honestly, simp territory. I want a partner, not a liability or a transactional dynamic where effort is expected rather than appreciated.

At the same time, I’ll be honest: part of me is considering still going on the date purely to get more comfortable dating again and being around attractive women, even if I already suspect I wouldn’t pursue this based on her mindset around expectations.

So my questions are:

•	Are these early signs actual red flags, or just different dating styles?

•	Is it reasonable to be put off by “high standards” when they seem framed around money rather than values?

•	Would you still go on the date for practice or clarity, or cut it early and trust the gut feeling?

Appreciate any honest takes - especially from people who’ve navigated similar situations.",1,1769430603.0,Advice,7,1.0,False

I’ve completely run out of space in my kitchen for appliances, so I’m thinking of creating a floating coffee station on this wall (it needs to be floating because of the heater underneath).

The idea is to use it for my coffee machine, toaster, and kettle, with floating shelves or cupboards. The problem is… I have zero interior design skills 😅

I’d really appreciate any ideas on:
	•	How best to utilise this wall space
	•	Layout suggestions for the floating counter + shelves/cabinets
	•	How to make it look cohesive with the rest of the kitchen

In terms of dimensions: 

Depth: 34cm
Full width: 106cm
Height: 230cm

I’ve uploaded a full photo of the kitchen for context. Any advice, inspiration, or examples would be amazing - thank you!

1qnepcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1qnepcz/how_to_handle_money_like_happy_couples_do_the/,How to Handle MONEY Like Happy Couples Do: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Money fights are the number one reason couples break up. Not cheating, not different life goals, MONEY. I've spent months deep-diving into research from financial therapists, relationship experts, and couples who've actually figured this shit out (books like ""The Psychology of Money"" by Morgan Housel, podcasts like ""Afford Anything"" with Paula Pant, and studies from the Gottman Institute). The pattern is crystal clear: happy couples don't avoid money talks, they just handle them completely differently than everyone else.

Here's what actually works when two people try to merge their financial lives without losing their minds.

**Step 1: Have the Ugly Money Talk Early (like, really early)**

You need to know each other's money baggage before you're knee-deep in shared bills. What's their credit score? How much debt are they carrying? What does their family think about money? Are they a saver or a spender?

This isn't romantic, but you know what else isn't romantic? Finding out your partner has $50k in credit card debt after you've already moved in together.

Most couples wait until there's a crisis to talk about money. That's like waiting until your car is on fire to check if you have insurance. Bad move.

Financial therapist Amanda Clayman says money conversations reveal your core values faster than almost anything else. If someone thinks spending $200 on concert tickets is essential and you think it's insane, that's not about money. That's about what you value in life.

**Step 2: Pick Your Money System (and stop judging each other's choices)**

There's no ""right"" way to handle money as a couple, but you need to pick ONE system and stick with it. Here are the main ones that actually work:

**Joint everything**: All money goes into one pot. You're a team, everything is ""ours."" This works for couples who have similar spending habits and trust each other completely.

**Separate everything**: Keep your own accounts, split bills 50/50 or proportionally. This works for people who value independence or came into the relationship with very different financial situations.

**The hybrid (most popular)**: Joint account for shared expenses (rent, groceries, utilities), separate accounts for personal spending. You each contribute a set amount to the joint account every month. This is what most happy couples actually do because it gives you both autonomy AND teamwork.

The couples who fight the most about money are the ones who never actually agreed on a system. They're just winging it and getting mad when their partner doesn't read their mind.

**Step 3: Decide What ""Fair"" Actually Means**

Here's where shit gets real. If one person makes $100k and the other makes $40k, is splitting expenses 50/50 actually fair? Probably not.

Happy couples figure out their own definition of fair, and it's usually proportional to income. If you make 70% of the household income, you contribute 70% to shared expenses. The other person contributes 30%. This way, you both have roughly the same amount of ""fun money"" left over.

The book ""Cents and Sensibility"" by Gary Belsky breaks this down beautifully. Fair doesn't mean equal. Fair means you both feel like you're contributing appropriately and neither person is stressed about money while the other is living large.

**Step 4: Create a ""No Questions Asked"" Fund for Each Person**

This is the game changer. Each person gets a monthly amount of money they can spend on WHATEVER THEY WANT without explaining or justifying it to their partner.

Want to buy another pair of sneakers? Go for it. Want to spend $80 on a fancy dinner with friends? None of my business. This eliminates like 80% of money fights because you're not micromanaging each other's spending.

The amount depends on your income, but even if it's just $100 a month, that freedom matters. You're adults. You shouldn't have to ask permission to buy a coffee.

Paula Pant from the ""Afford Anything"" podcast calls this ""building autonomy into your financial plan."" Couples who don't do this end up resenting each other because everything feels like a negotiation.

**Step 5: Set Shared Goals (or you'll pull in opposite directions)**

If one person is saving for a house and the other is planning a $5k vacation to Europe, you're going to have problems. Happy couples sit down and figure out what they're working toward TOGETHER.

Make a list:
* Short term goals (next 1-2 years): Pay off credit cards, build an emergency fund, take a trip
* Medium term goals (3-5 years): Save for a wedding, buy a house, start a business  
* Long term goals (10+ years): Retirement, kids' college funds, financial independence

Once you know what you're working toward together, spending decisions get easier. Is buying that new TV moving you closer to your shared goals or further away? That's your filter.

Morgan Housel's ""The Psychology of Money"" has an entire chapter on this. People don't struggle with money because they're bad at math. They struggle because they don't have a clear vision of what they're trying to build.

**Step 6: Schedule Money Meetings (yes, seriously)**

This sounds corporate and annoying, but it works. Once a month, sit down for 30 minutes and review your finances together. What came in, what went out, are you on track for your goals, do you need to adjust anything?

This prevents the ""surprise"" fights. No more ""Wait, you spent HOW MUCH on what?"" Instead, you're both staying informed and making decisions together.

Use an app like Rocket Money or YNAB to track everything so you're not manually adding up receipts like it's 1987. The app Honeydue is literally designed for couples and shows you both your spending in real time.

For deeper understanding of relationship dynamics and money psychology, there's also BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app that creates personalized audio content from books, research papers, and expert insights on topics like financial compatibility and relationship communication. You can ask it to build a learning plan around something specific, like ""navigate money conversations as a couple"" or ""understand my partner's spending psychology,"" and it pulls from quality sources to create tailored podcasts. The length and depth are customizable, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. It's built by a team from Columbia and Google, so the content is vetted and science-backed. Worth checking out if you want structured learning that fits into your commute or gym time.

The Gottman Institute found that couples who have regular ""state of the union"" talks about money, sex, and household responsibilities have way lower divorce rates. Shocking, right? Talking about stuff actually helps.

**Step 7: Don't Hide Your Spending (financial infidelity is real)**

About 40% of people in relationships admit to hiding purchases from their partner. This is called financial infidelity and it destroys trust faster than almost anything else.

If you feel like you need to hide spending, that's a red flag. Either you're overspending and know it, or your partner is too controlling about money. Both problems need to be addressed directly.

Financial therapist Brad Klontz says hidden spending usually isn't about the money itself. It's about shame, control issues, or fear of conflict. If you're hiding things, you need to figure out WHY and have that conversation.

**Step 8: Plan for the ""What Ifs"" (because life happens)**

What happens if one person loses their job? What if someone gets sick? What if you break up (yeah, uncomfortable, but necessary)?

Happy couples talk about the scary stuff BEFORE it happens. They have emergency funds. They have a plan for who keeps the apartment if they split up. They know how they'll handle medical bills.

This isn't pessimistic. It's responsible. You have car insurance even though you don't plan to crash. Same logic.

**Step 9: Remember You're on the Same Team**

The biggest mindset shift that separates happy couples from miserable ones: stop seeing money as a competition. It's not ""my money"" vs ""your money."" It's ""our life"" and money is just the tool you use to build it.

When your partner spends money on something you think is dumb, take a breath before freaking out. Ask yourself: Is this actually a problem or am I just being judgmental? Are they staying within their ""no questions asked"" budget? Is this derailing our shared goals?

Most money fights aren't really about money. They're about feeling respected, valued, and heard. When you approach money conversations as teammates instead of opponents, everything changes.

Look, handling money as a couple is messy. You're combining two different histories, values, and habits. But the couples who make it work don't have some magical compatibility. They just communicate, compromise, and choose to prioritize the relationship over being ""right"" about money.

Figure out your system. Have the hard talks. Build something together. And for the love of everything, stop judging your partner for buying overpriced coffee if it makes them happy.",3,1769430482.0,AttractionDynamics,0,1.0,False

# ❓ FAQ

**Q: Which app is truly the fastest?**  
A: Shopify Bundles (native) and Libautech (native architecture) have minimal speed impact. JavaScript-based apps add 0.6-1.2s.

**Q: Do I need AI features?**  
A: AI helps suggest smart product pairings automatically. Useful for stores with 50+ products. Not essential for smaller catalogs.

**Q: Can I switch apps later?**  
A: Yes, but you'll need to recreate bundles. Start with your best guess based on needs.

**Q: How much revenue increase can I expect?**  
A: Industry data shows bundle apps typically increase AOV by 20-40% when properly implemented. Results vary by product type and store.

**Q: Should I use multiple bundle apps?**  
A: No - causes conflicts, slows site, and complicates management. Choose one comprehensive solution.

**Q: Is free Shopify Bundles enough?**  
A: For basic testing, yes. For revenue growth, you'll need analytics, AI, and multiple bundle types from paid apps.

1qneml5,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongHaulersRecovery/comments/1qneml5/90_recovered/,90%+ recovered,"I got COVID in January 2022. I was almost hospitalised and it was the worst sickness I'd ever experienced. 

I had lingering effects and was prescribed antibiotics which probably made it worse. 

I thought I'd gotten better a few weeks later but three months later things went sideways. 

I struggled to sleep, was tired all day, had diarrea and stomach issues and just felt like a corpse. 

After a month, I started taking antihistamines (Allegra/Telfast) which helped a lot but it was still rough. 

I started taking supplements and getting vitamin and mineral infusions (intravenously) and slowly winding down my activity levels as I realised how little I could handle. 

After six months, I was about 70% better but would often crash after periods of exertion or stress and sometimes just feel exhausted. Mornings were always hard and there were times I could barely function. 

Crashes felt like I had a cold and would last several days. 

I slowly improved over the following years but the crashes always came and went and mornings were still tough. 

The worst was when I went on a 30km hike in the Andes and had a crash so bad i was projectile vomiting several days later. It felt like my body just stopped ingesting food. 

I went to a Long COVID Clinic in 2025. I had just become a father, which had meant a lot of stress and no time for looking after myself. 

Before COVID, I was ripped and in incredible physical health. The last few years and the first months of pregnancy saw my weight climb to 93kg. 

I was 78kg before the whole nightmare started. 

They diagnosed me with sleep apnea and told me that losing weight would help with that and long COVID. They also told me to eat a better diet (Mediterranean). 

They also added an H2 antihistamine. 

I took their words to heart and stopped sugar then and there. After a couple of months, I upped my game and counted calories. I spent four months being hungry but did notice improvements. 

No alcohol, no junk food, no added sugars. 

I also kept taking all the supplements and medications I'd been taking. 

LDN, H1 and H2 antihistamines, amitriptyline, NAC, vitamin C and D, fish oil, Curcumin, melatonin, statins etc. 

They all helped. 

And then, the icing on the cake was this month. 

I watched the Zoe podcast on evidence based nutrition and changed my diet to focus on fibre and wholefoods over protein. Rather than clean food with lots of protein from meat, I cut down meat in favour of as many nuts, legumes, vegetables, fruits and whole grains I could find. 

This gave me that extra 5% boost where I now feel 90% to 95% recovered. Maybe even more. 

My diet is quite intense. 

My morning breakfast is black coffee and a bowl of overnight soaked rolled oats with chia seeds and silken tofu mixed with nuts and berries. 

My lunch is generally a two egg omelette with a salad with lots of vegetables, fruits, nuts and legumes and rye sourdough. 

My dinner usually includes a small piece of fish or chicken (or occasionally red meat), legumes, vegetables, nuts, spices, and black rice.

I have fruit salad when I want a snack. 

I finally feel like myself most of the time.

I can tolerate weight training and walks. I am slowly pushing my energy envelope too. 

I don't wake up tired. I can function normally most of the time. 

My hypothesis is that my gut microbiome was screwed over by COVID and opportunistic pathogens came in and wreaked havoc on my system. 

Years of pacing and medication and the last six months of diet have restored the good bacteria that support healthy immune functioning. 

This last part is still an open question in medicine and I am not a doctor. 

But whatever it was that caused this: I'm just grateful. ",23,1769430252.0,LongHaulersRecovery,3,1.0,False

1qnem1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/spoonfulofreason/comments/1qnem1u/whats_new_on_the_topic_of_food_addiction/,What’s new on the topic of food addiction?,"At the intersection of neurobiology and nutritional science, among other areas, we are also addressing food addiction. In everyday language, we often say we are addicted to coffee or cake. And although we will not find a diagnosis of food addiction in medical encyclopedias, this issue is actively discussed, researched, and reformulated to include new details.



The phenomenon we are discussing is not just about liking certain foods very much. The problem is that we lose control of our behaviour. For example, the Yale Food Addiction Scale measures compulsive eating (when we eat more than we planned, even when we are not hungry), tolerance (the need to eat very strong-tasting foods to feel the same satisfaction), withdrawal (irritability or headaches if we stop consuming sugar or heavily processed fats), and continued consumption despite harm (weight gain, diabetes, or emotional difficulties). Studies show that natural foods (such as apples or steak) do not usually cause such reactions.



Over the course of evolution, our brains have learned to choose foods that provide the most energy. Modern food additives act as a ""super stimulus,"" triggering a powerful response from the dopamine system. A fresh peach may cause a moderate release of dopamine, but a glazed doughnut can cause a huge dopamine spike. Natural foods rarely contain equal amounts of fat and carbohydrates, whereas processed foods are often high in both. It is common in foods associated with strong hedonistic desires (e.g., chocolate, doughnuts, ice cream). The more dopamine a food causes to be released, the more we want it next time. As with other addictions, the more often we eat such foods, the weaker the brain's response becomes due to desensitization, but the stronger our desire for it (because we mobilize additional motivation to achieve the same pleasure we felt before), because constant stimulation of dopamine receptors reduces their sensitivity, In addition, the effect of the frontal lobe of the brain weakens, making us less inclined to control our behavior. Under such conditions, sensitivity to stress increases, which often leads to emotional eating.



There is another problem with industrially produced food—it is often very soft, so it takes less time to chew; it contains significantly less fibre, and the substantially more intense sweeteners and umami-flavour-imitating additives do not affect leptin, the satiety hormone, in the same way as regular food. As a result, we feel full later and have more opportunities to eat more high-calorie food. Over time, we no longer seek such food for pleasure, but only to feel ""normal."" All this means that a lack of willpower does not cause the phenomenon; rather, it is the effect of modern, artificially created food on the brain, which lacks the mechanism to respond to it appropriately.



Research shows that about 14 per cent of adults and 12 per cent of children may have an addiction-like reaction to processed foods. This phenomenon can have a powerful impact in communities with a high proportion of low-income people, where so-called ""food deserts"" can actually be ""addiction zones."" However, an individual's reaction to highly processed foods depends heavily on their genes, environment, and choices, so it cannot usually be compared across people.



Here are some tips for dealing with unhealthy food cravings:



* Focus on the healthy foods you want to add to your diet, not the ones you should avoid. After all, you can't eat everything, and if you eat healthy foods first, there won't be any room left for unhealthy ones. Choose foods that are high in fibre first.
* Take care of your environment—don't create conditions for ""eating with your eyes,"" don't leave food you don't want to eat in visible places, and limit your presence in areas where such food is offered or sold.
* If you don't want to give up a particular product right away, replace half of it with a healthier alternative, gradually increasing the proportion of healthy food.
* Plan your withdrawal reaction – the most challenging part is the first 2-5 days of not eating the chosen product. It will be easier later, so plan engaging activities for those days.
* The reward response to healthier food will develop faster and be stronger if you eat mindfully, slowly, and, of course, make sure it tastes good.
* Before eating, make sure you are NOT angry, lonely (or otherwise emotionally uncomfortable) or tired, so that you do not create a harmful cause-and-effect relationship.
