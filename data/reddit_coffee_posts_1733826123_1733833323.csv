Here it is, the one chapter I promised to post before the 14th. Honestly, I was a bit surprised that TaE won the poll, but it was quite close.  
I'm sorry if the ending of the chapter feels a bit akward, I was trying to end it somewhere that would give my ficnapper a direction or something to latch to should they choose to ficnapp TaE.

**-Date \[relevant time unit: Skalgan\]: 9th paw of the 2nd deci of the 1st heard, 78 p.u.**

*This is bullshit. Here I am, on an alien planet surrounded by its inhabitants, stuck on a bed because I broke my legs. Awesome.*

 Sigh

*Well, it could have gone way worse considering what I’ve been through. It’s a miracle that I’ve only broken my legs and nothing else -well, nothing else if I don’t count the micro-fractures I probably have-* and *I can still feel my toes so it’s not like I’ll be left paralyzed. I just have to be patient and wait a month I guess. Assuming some days have already passed while I was out cold, God I hate not being able to know how much time has passed.*

*The only thing that vaguely helps me tell the time are the visits from the doctor, even though they are a bit awkward… I suppose that’s inevitable, with me being completely alien to them and not knowing how to communicate. they seem to act extra careful with every check, like I was made of glass, and always made sure to not leave me alone with… his? hers? ah whatever, the other two aliens, which I assume are either nurses, assistants or junior doctors.* 

*Damn it, I’ve already met four different aliens and I still can’t ask them any of the questions I have! What do they call themselves? Are there any others? Will they like pizza? Wait, can they even eat cheese? Can* I *eat alien cheese?* 

***Gurgle*** 

*Great, now I’m bored* and *hungry.*

While my basic nutrient needs were met thanks to the IVs, that didn’t mean I couldn’t feel hunger. *Especially* if I fed the desire by thinking about pizza. Like a dumbass.

*Well, it’s not like I don’t have anything to eat…* I glanced at the bedside table, where one of the doctor’s assistants left what looked like granola bars packaged in what I thought was plastic, but revealed itself to be either paper or something that felt like paper after further inspection.

I was, admittedly, a bit hesitant to try them out. Questions like “*What if I was allergic to the ingredients? What if it was toxic to Humans?*” and, worst of all, “*What if it tasted French??”* popped into my mind as I valued the pros and cons of eating the foreign food.

*Ah whatever, I’m already in a medical facility, aren’t I? What’s the worst tha-.... Ok, maybe I shouldn’t jinx myself just in case.*

I took one of the bars and carefully unwrapped one side,revealing a whitish combination of grain and seeds, held together by… *something.* It had a faint smell that vaguely reminded me of cinnamon.

*Welp, here goes nothing.*

I took a bite and started chewing.

…

It wasn’t *bad,* but it definitely was unusual. The grains and seeds tasted like, well, grains and seeds, but the stuff that held them together was slightly spicy? And tasted a bit like resin, I  think. Now that I’m savoring it more carefully, I think that there are nuts too? There’s something that reminds me of peanuts and something else that’s kind of airy, like puffed rice.

All in all it was somewhat filling and I could get behind the taste.

*Eh, I guess it’ll do for now.*

I quickly finished the one I was already eating and the others I left on the bedside table before settling back on the bed. With nothing else to do other than stare at the ceiling and wait for someone to enter I decided that it was the perfect moment to take a nap, after all, I was awake for God knows how long and wasn’t able to sleep sooner due to the excitement of my situation. 



**-Event\_Log\_Time: Skipping 2.34h ahead of the last script.**

***FSSShhhhhh***

*Uh ? Wha?*

I was suddenly woken up by the sound of the airlock opening up again and groggily rubbed my eyes to stave off some sleepiness.

*Uff, maybe the nap was a bad idea, I feel even more tired than before… God, I would kill for some coffee right now.*

I looked back at the door to see If it was the doctor again, and was instead surprised to see three aliens, a couple of whom were dragging a cart carrying a crate that was obviously filled with a bunch of stuff, given the rattling sound that it made while passing the bump of the airlock.

*Oh? What’s that ? This doesn’t seem like the other medical checkups…* 

I propped myself up on my elbows, tiredness being replaced with burning curiosity, and tried to take a peek at the content of the crate. I couldn’t really look inside it due to how I was positioned, but I saw something resembling a book poking out of the container.

*This definitely isn’t like the other medical examinations… could it be that they decided I was fine enough to properly start interacting with me?*

My thoughts were interrupted by the sound of someone whistling repeatedly, kind of like if someone was repeatedly putting a finger to plug the hole of a boiling kettle, except without all the screaming.

The sound was coming from one of the aliens and, with how its tail was wagging, I think it is safe to say that it was a laugh.

*Hmpf so you think it’s funny because I’m eager to do something else other than laying around? Well, I’d like to see you in my place! Wait, this one seems familiar…*

I squinted my eyes to get a better look at the laughing alien, the suits not doing me any favors, and although I wasn’t completely sure of it, I could swear that this was the same alien that came into my room when I first woke up.

*Huh, so they are here again. I wonder what their job is… if they were a doctor they would have been there with the other medical exams, right? Hmm, maybe I’ll find out soon enough.*  
I thought as the aliens stopped at the foot of my bed.

One of those that were carrying the cart walked up to me, allowing me to take a better look at his grayish wool, and twisted its tail until it was pointing back at himself, a commendable feat considering how jittery it was just a second before. Then it spoke.

“Venlil”

Then, the tail was pointed at his colleague, and it spoke again.

“Venlil”

Finally, it was pointed to the familiar one.

 “Venlil”

*OH! LANGUAGE! FINALLY! Ok, ok, let’s see, same word for everyone… it must be the species name, there’s no other obvious answer.*

I tried to repeat the word, to see if I could get the pronunciation right.

“Wentil?”

Hearing me trying to speak their language made them ecstatic, but they immediately helped me correcting myself.

“Venlil”

“Venti?”

“Venlil”

“Vén-lil… Venlil!”

They seemed pleased with my last attempt and started to say something more, too fast for me to catch any of it, but it was probably something along the lines of ‘Yes! that’s it!’.

*Aha! At last, a passable effort! Now it’s my turn!*

I placed a hand on my chest, which caught their attention, and said “Human”

To my surprise, all three of them tried to say it at the same time, making it almost impossible to correct them as they repeated the word to themselves attempting to correct each other. 

They were speaking too quickly and too much for me to hear all of the attempts, but the few I managed to understand weren't that far off: ‘Hooman’, ‘HughMann’ and ‘Youmen’ were the closest.

Then, I heard one of them pronouncing it almost perfectly and snapped my fingers to interrupt them and point it out.

“Bingo! That’s how you say it!” I exclaimed happily.

This, however, seemed to startle them and they all turned to look at me, ears straight up in attention. I was starting to get a little worried that I’d done something taboo when the one I was pointing at tentatively repeated “Human?”

Hearing this I vigorously nodded and said “Yes! Human! You got it!” to pass my point across as best as I could.

They seemed to understand what I was trying to convey and relaxed a little. Then, the one who stated the communications, pointed back at themselves and said “Verim”

Then, while pointing at the one who said ‘Human’ correctly “Leeea”

And finally, the last one “Seva”

*This time they are all different, so it must be names right? They said only one thought, do they not have surnames? Or are the surnames part of the name and I’m just hearing it all as one word? Eh, I’ll figure it out later.*

I decided to skip the whole pronunciation part to speed the process up, as I was getting impatient, and directly told them my name.

Lore Snippets!

Somewhere in the Night-side of Skalga's habitable belt there is a valley hidden inbetween hills, where the flora and soil has taken a peculiar shade of red.   
Some of that flora has developed  a bioluminescent glow that attracted the early Venlil who founded the settlemen which was later called ""Red Haven"". Over time the Venlil that settled there gave birth to younglings with a red tint in their wool and that's why some Venlil are red, or so the legend says.   
That valley and it's hills are now called Skalga's crown and they are one of the natural wonder of their planet.   
It's speculated that it was the site of a meteorite impact that carried a bacteria rich with iron.

I just needed to dump my thoughts out somewhere that wasn't my friends. As much as I love them I don't want to worry them any more than I already do. To anyone who reads this also, take care of yourself, god knows it isn't easy.  
  
I've been struggling quite a lot with what is either a flare or just my condition getting way worse. I don't even know what's wrong, I know its some sort of dysautonomia but my heart rate doesn't seem to peak consistently or dramatically enough to be pots, and I don't have a blood pressure monitor to test for OH. I'm diagnosed with vasovagal syncope and headaches, but the worst thing is the fatigue.  
  
 I can't DO anything, my depression has leapt on the opportunity and I have no interest in doing anything either. I have almost no appetite, which is playing directly into my paranoia that I'm too thin, and I LOVE food, at least I used to. The only things I can bring myself to eat are sweets, which makes me feel like shit because I know it isnt healthy. It doesnt help either that every time I eat I struggle to breathe and or swallow, and after eating I get stomach cramps and nausea. I used to love cooking, but I just have zero energy to do it without sitting down anymore, and I don't have a stool or anything. Internalised ableism isnt helping, and neither is my mum and her not-very-concealed ableism. She's so critical of me all the time and thinks I'm just being weak or something, which is neither here nor there but it certainly isnt very helpful when she keeps telling me I should drink red wine and coffee which I can't drink because it fucks me up so bad. It honestly almost feels like shes embarrassed of me when i talk about my cane.

I keep having to pretend I'm fine and I'm happy when really I've attempted twice this month. I'm just not good enough at anything, not even ending it, probably because i actually dont want to deep down? idk. It doesn't help that everything I used to do for fun and be praised for I either iced out because they weren't related to my future career or I just dropped. Now that I can't even work anymore I feel like I don't know who I am. I feel worthless if I can't work, and now not only am I worthless, but I'm also a burden. All I do is listen to true crime podcasts, doomscroll and online shop for groceries, CDs and second hand clothes since those were my only ""hobbies"" since year 11 when school work got harder. I already knew my work habits werent healthy but as an undiagnosed autistic person making work my whole personality was the only way I could keep up with my classmates, and yet I was never enough and I still borderline failed my exams and missed all my uni offers. It's only through a stroke of luck I ended up at a good university at all and now I'm fucking it up by being sick. At least before it got worse I was only mentally ill, now I'm physically ill too. I miss the person I used to be and everyone says it only gets better but I've been stuck in the cycle for so many years that I just know it'll always get worse again, and it's just so hard to bear.

On top of that I only recently felt like I know who I am, but I've lost that again, I don't know who I am and I feel alienated because of it. Either way if you've read this far, thank you, I hope you're doing ok.",1,1733832717.0,ChronicIllness,0,1.0,False

1hb0bvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/afterlife/comments/1hb0bvr/more_visits_from_my_atheist_husband/,More visits from my atheist husband.,"I began this journal under the name, baby cakes 123. many of you have seen it so I apologize for redundancy, but there are more now. Here is my journal to date:

Visit 1:
My husband, Ed, died on September 27, 2024 in our home. He died at around 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Ed firmly believed that once you die, it’s over. No afterlife, no nothing.
In between the time that he died, and the Funeral home people arrived, five of my friends came over to be with me and his daughter came over as well. Seven of us were sitting in our living room talking and the TV popped on. It was flicking through the channels really fast. I asked who turned on the TV and nobody knew. I got up and took the remote off the table and shut it off.
We were all looking at each other like what the hell just happened. One of our friends there said that was Ed’s energy. Ed was a huge Mets fan and one of his friends who was there said that the Mets had just hit a huge home run. It was about 9 PM.
 
Visit 2:
I had a service for Ed in town at the Funeral Home and a few days later, a celebration of his life at our home. They were both very well attended. Ed would have loved the celebration we had at our home.
The morning after the celebration, I was completely off the rails. I woke up at around 5 AM. I was crying and scared and this went on for at least an hour and a half. My brother and his wife were staying at my house at the time. They did not hear me as I was downstairs.
At around 7 o'clock I took two photographs off of our mantle which I had placed there for the celebration, and I went upstairs into our bedroom. I put the pictures back on my bedside table where they had always been, and I took another photograph of Ed as a child and Ed’s baby shoe and walked across the room and put them on a dresser. The TV in the room was now facing away from me. I heard a noise which I assumed was coming from outside as the windows were open. I walked towards the windows and saw that the TV was on. This is a totally different TV.
I called out and my sister-in-law came into our bedroom and stood there, so I sat down and watched. I told her that I had not turned on the TV. At first, the TV was flicking through channels just like had happened downstairs. Mind you this is all on Wi-Fi and these TVs are controlled by firestick remotes. This time I didn't want to turn the TV off because I wanted to see what he was trying to tell me. The channel flicking stopped and then very serene scenes of mountains and valleys and rivers started floating by. I do not have screensavers on. This has never happened before. So about eight of these beautiful scenes floated by and the TV shut itself off. He was trying to calm me down and it worked.
Visit 3:
A very dear friend of ours who had visited Ed on his deathbed several days before he died came over to see me. Ed loved him and it was mutual. He and I were sitting in the living room talking and the lights in our sconces over the mantle started flickering. First one light started going on and off really fast so I checked the lightbulb which I knew was not loose and it wasn’t. Then the other light started flickering. They were both going on and off the entire time our friend was over. I turned the lights off from the switch and turned them back on and it continued. These are Hue light bulbs that I normally control with my phone. I never use the light switch. When he left, it stopped. That had never happened before.
Visit 4:
At Ed’s daughter’s house a mirror that we had given them 12 years ago and that has been on the wall for 12 years just dropped off the hanger. It did not break, but was just leaning against the wall on the floor.
Visit 5:
I was searching the house for a cord to an electric blanket that should have been with the blanket in a trunk in our room. I went through the entire house and was going nuts looking for it. I went back to a closet that I had already checked to check again and saw a pair of his boots that I thought was silly to leave there. I brought the boots to closet in the basement where I have his other winter boots. I put them down and shut the closet door. I turned around and there was the cord, in a place that it absolutely should not have been. I pass by that spot several times a day. The cord was literally hanging off a shelf right on a bar that he had built, I know what was on that shelf and the cord should not have been there. It was also wrapped up neatly which I would not have done. I thanked him for helping me.
 
Visit 6:
I had some of my girlfriends over to celebrate a birthday. Everyone brought something to eat. We were sitting out on the porch talking and drinking. It got chilly outside, so I suggested that we get food from the dining room and eat in the living room. The first person to make up a plate went into the living room and sat on the couch. We all got our plates and were sitting around and talking. I looked at the coffee table and saw a plate with food and a fork just sitting there and asked whose plate it was. It wasn’t anyone’s. The first person who came into the room said it was there when she came into the living room.
Visit 7:
I had just received two Amazon speakers. I hooked up the first one in our living room and I asked Alexa to play a song for me. Normally Alexa says something when asked to play music, like “this is from a playlist” but she said nothing.

A Willie Nelson song came on. Ed was a huge Willie Nelson fan but I had nothing in Amazon Music or my playlists of Willie Nelsons at that time. I never played it. All Willie Nelson songs were in Ed's Apple Music
Here are the lyrics to the song that played:

My window faces the south
I'm almost halfway to heaven
Snow is falling but still I can see
Fields of cotton calling to me

My window faces the south
And though I am far from the Swanee
I'm never frowning or down in the mouth
My window faces the south

I went to the kitchen and I thought about it and thought how strange that was that Alexa played Wille Nelson, and that song in particular which I had never heard before.

I went back into the living room and asked Alexa to repeat the last song. She said there was no song to repeat.
I went to the computer a searched for the song based on what I remembered hearing and found the lyrics. Now when I ask Alexa to play My Window Faces the South by Willie Nelson, she plays a totally different version.
 
Visit 8:
I had a horrible day during the first week of November. I was depressed and crying all day long. I had a few drinks in the evening which made it worse. I was in our bedroom crying and was terrible dire thoughts.
I had left my phone downstairs in my living room. I heard my text notification go off, so I went downstairs. A friend asked how was doing and I told her that I was having a horrible day, so she called me. We “accidentally” ended up facetiming.
I was telling her about all of the visits from Ed. I was telling her about the time that living room lights were flickering and just then the lights started flickering again. Since we were facetiming, she was able to see what I was seeing. This time, the lights were much more pronounced, meaning that they were flashing almost frantically. The lights were flashing bright and very fast. It was apparent that was very worried about me and wanted me to know that he was still here with me.
 
Visit 9:
November 27 – 2 Months after Ed’s Passing.
My friend Mary Ellen came over at around 4:30 and we were in the living room talking and listening to music by a band that I had just discovered. At around 5:30 we're listening to this music and all the sudden the speaker in the living room shut off. Then we heard music coming from the kitchen. There was no music playing in the kitchen before, so we get up and walked to the kitchen. A Willie Nelson song, “Keep Me in Your Heart” was playing. I had never heard before. 5:30 is around the time when Ed passed away. Mary Ellen was also at our house when Ed passed away
Here are the lyrics to the song:
Shadows are fallin' and I'm runnin' out of breath
Keep me in your heart for a while
 
If I leave you, it doesn't mean I love you any less
Keep me in your heart for a while
 
When you get up in the mornin' and you see that crazy sun
Keep me in your heart for a while
 
There's a train leavin' nightly called When All is Said and Done
Just keep me in your heart for a while
 
Keep me in your heart for a while
Keep me in your heart for a while
 
Sometimes you're doin' simple things around the house
Maybe you'll think of me and smile
You know I'm tied to you just like the buttons on your blouse
Keep me in your heart for a while
 
Hold me in your thoughts
Take me to your dreams
Touch me as I fall in view
 
When the winter comes, keep the fires lit
I'll be right next to you
Engine driver headed north to Pleasant Stream
Keep me in your heart for a while
 
These wheels keep turnin' but they're runnin' out of steam
 
Keep me in your heart for a while

1hb08ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1hb08ni/adding_bleach_to_the_dishwasher/,Adding bleach to the dishwasher,"I have recently (in the last month) moved into a spare room with a live in landlady who has quite specific house rules that I have to abide by.
One in particular is that I am not allowed to put the dishwasher on - I am allowed (and encouraged) to put my dirty dishes in the dishwasher but I am not allowed to turn it on unless it is a Sunday or particular energy saving times or the day.
This is fine by me as I like to be ecologically mindful - however - landlady has an unusual habit when it comes to using the dishwasher.
I tend to leave it to her to turn the machine on so I don't disrupt her routine but she loads it so full that it looks to me that things couldn't possibly be getting 100% clean.
Often things come out after a cycle with bits of food/cat food residue on them... 🤢
I discovered that she is running the dishwasher on eco mode even when it is overly filled and to top that off, she has been pouring straight /bleach/ into the bottom of the machine before running the cycle.
I have never heard of anyone doing this before but I put it down to her being quite unique and a bit of a germ phobe.. 
However
After 5 weeks of living here I am starting to notice that I and experiencing digestive issues - D&C... In combination... It's been 6 days now of symptoms persisting, I'm not thinking I might need to go to the GP..
I was at a loss of what could be causing these issues until I was eating my cereal yesterday and noticed a strange taste along with my coco shreddies and oat milk.. also my morning coffee tasted off! I think it might be the presence of bleach residue 🤢

| Final Mission | - | I don't know how to redesign this |

I set a coffee machine via EVRI (1st mistake) and didn't pay more for coverage (2nd mistake). The package with in a big cardboard box with MIELE printed on the side, very distinctive. When it arrived however, there was a small black bag with my label on it, containing a dress. The person who received it took a video of himself opening it, as it was obvious it wasn't what he expected. The label still had the original weight on it. I contacted EVRI about this and after some back and forth they have offered my the £20 plus postage back, which is the standard. They said that's all I'm covered for. My argument is that isn't accidental damage or loss, someone has deliberately stolen my parcel, and either reprinted my label, or removed my label and stuck it on another parcel. I don't believe you should have to purchase cover because you expect the delivery company to steal your parcel.

1hb02s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1hb02s0/suspicions_proved_correct/,Suspicions proved correct,"14 year relationship. Step Children. Christmas. My gut has been on high alert for 2 months. All the flags presented them selves…more dinners with the guys. More overnight golf trips with guys. Picking of fights. Cold and dismissive behavior. Then I saw unusual activity on our 2nd home WiFi router… “womans-name”- MACBOOK AIR just logged on to your router for the first time. 
Process of elimination based on unique spelling of her name crossed reference with social media of a restaurant he frequents. 
I asked. Of course met with denial and gaslighting. Sent her a follow request from my personal IG…it was accepted. Seemed odd ? Does she not know? Or does she not care? Maybe I’m wrong? 

Then found the not totally deleted voicemail from her saying her entire name. 

Asked again. Without showing cards. 
Partial denial. “Friends” but no intimacy.  “Never spent night.” (Okay😂). Does she know about me? Doesn’t she know my name? 

Queue his anger and storming away from conversation. 

I know they stayed together last night. I didn’t bother calling his phone. Or texting. 

This morning I am however tempted to reach out to her - does she know he’s in a relationship? Does she care? 

I know risks of course…it could draw them closer. If he has in fact told her to any extent he’s got a whole life I suspect he probably used the old “I’m unhappy and we are separated so this needs to be a secret please be patient”. Or something to that effect. 
It could infuriate him and cause more upset to our home during the holidays. 
He may not say anything as that would cause him to be incriminating himself. 
She could be oblivious and say I had no clue. And ghost him. 

While I have no intention of staying after this blow. And that it came so out of left field I wasn’t prepared 
for leaving - financially ie; no emergency nest egg., and with the holidays this recent blow has already made the season a challenge. 
Trying to keep the smile on my face. Fear and hurt hidden. And trying to even get a tree up. So hard when Ive just had whole blowup. 
But I just need some time. 

And of course I’m so pissed that while I’m home handling our life and trying to smile and not barf in sink or cry in coffee he’s off getting his ****wet. All happy and s****
And so yea I kinda want to subtly engage to see if she is the widowed (4years ago after married for 27) mother of two college age girls that based on social media pictures seems like a women supporting women kinda broad that might be like omg had no clue and may vanish. Cause I just want him to hurt and come home and grovel and I would have bought myself some time to line ducks up for departure. 
Or if she’s just the worst kind of woman - and thinks she found her golden goose. And doesn’t give a shit.

I spent almost 2000 Euros in Thailand (not including planes from/to home country)

Some details were money was spent apart from food:

* A lot of Bolt and Grab
* \+-10 nights of hostels (4x full moon hostel days were expensive)
* Private room + some nights sharing with people I met
* Internal flights:
   * Bangkok to Ko Samui
   * Bangkok to Chiang Mai
   * Chiang Rai to Bangkok
* Snorkel Tour
* \+-10 massage
* Open Water diving course (+- 300EUR)
* Some presents and shopping (+- 150EUR)

**Notes**

* No big drinker and no smoker
* A lot of specialty coffee (european prices)

# Itinerary

As said, I had nothing booked nor planned. I missed to visit the islands in the West coast, but the weather was also not nice so I ended up not going there. The table below show where I spent each day starting from day 1. For example, ""1-4"" means that I spent day 1, 2, 3 and 4 of my trip in the specific location.

Wishing you peace and success for today :)

# Today's check in:

What is something you can do to be kind to yourself today?

# Bonus exercise: an emergency kit

Do you have days where you just cannot for whatever reason? Can't muster the energy to cook the meal you planned to cook, had a bad day, didn't sleep the night before, got some really bad news, feel like crap, need to hide under a blankie or self-soothe big time? And is this a risk time for you to binge? An emergency kit might come in handy!

An emergency kit can be an actual box or basket full of things (and I've seen people really go to town with these and decorate them etc) or it can be as simple as a list on your phone, it's basically a ready-made action plan for when you really need some 10/10 comforting and self-soothing. Leaving decisions about 10/10 comforting to when you actually need it can potentially lead to unwanted outcomes (we've all been there!)!

Here are some things that could go in an emergency kit:

* a scented candle
* a comforting scented spray (bubblesandbooks)
* some nice crystals (slapstickanarchist)
* a notebook and pen to write out feelings
* a fidget spinner
* fairy lights (bubblesandbooks)
* play doh (zodiahck)
* a cozy blanket
* a comfortable outfit
   * anything fuzzy and cozy (bubblesandbooks)
   * some oversized sweats (MSH0123)
   * fuzzy socks (depressionkitten)
* some helpful media
   * a dvd or mp3 of your favourite movie of all time
   * christmas movies (maybe even a whole little christmas tree!) (bubblesandbooks)
   * a list of fun podcasts or comedy youtube channels
      * The Office Ladies (MSH0123)
* a note with a detailed take-out or order-in plan:
   * it's highly recommended to have a specific item already chosen from the menu, it can be hard to make good choices in an emergency
   * something from a place you haven't tried yet or wouldn't ordinarily get (MSH0123)
* some chewing gum (zodiahck)
* kept in the freezer:
   * a non-binge portion of a food that you love
   * a nice microwave meal (slapstickanarchist),
   * a comfort meal from childhood (bubblesandbooks)
* a single wrapped serving of a treat food
* a written list of friends to call
* positive, loving or encouraging notes to yourself
   * nice notes you've received from friends (guavatc)
   * remind yourself that this isn't permanent and you deserve good things (bubblesandbooks)
* some bubble bath or a single pack facial or foot wrap
* an unread issue of your favourite magazine

1hazxrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1hazxrk/metal_v60_experience/,Metal V60 Experience,"So I've been using Hario V60 SS Metal dripper lately and compared it with other 02 variants: Plastic, Glass, Mugen ceramic/plastic (these two are in their own category).  
All I can say about metal version is it just feels superior to the rest of them.  
\- Holder made out of Silicone Rubber. Makes this version **the most stable one**. As a bonus you can take it off easily and pair it with Glass V60 or Mugen if you want to (but there's no handle on these, so...)  
\- Handle. Feels nice and doesn't get warm. Makes it much easier to work with.  
\- Durability... it's metal. But I won't recommend to air dry it like any other metal dripper. I think it can be an issue for coated Black/Copper version, non-coated version may have stains from hard water if you air dry it.  
\- Lightweight. To compare it with other V60 02's:

1. Mugen w/o holder: 71g
2. V60 plastic (transparent clear): \~110g
3. **V60 SS metal w/o holder 103g; w/ holder: 142g**
4. Mugen Ceramic w/o holder: 194g
5. Glass w/o holder: 218g

I don't have a Ceramic V60 02, but I borrowed W60 and it's a nicely made product but it's huge: **498-ish g.** Kinda scary to handle on a glass server.

\- Temperature of the coffee. I honestly can't see much difference in the end if I rinse paper filter with a warm water before I start to make my coffee. After the process is done coffee still feels a bit too hot to drink anyway.

And no ""metallic taste"" like I've experienced with Moka Pot.

One serious flaw I can think of: it's not compatible with Switch base. It will leak because of outer grooves, they are concave shape on metal V60 (**outer surface on metal is not flat like on other versions**). And steel ball will fall out too, so be very careful if you'll try to modify it somehow.

So yeah, I really don't understand why it gets overshadowed by other versions.

I'll conjure up the memory of your voice saying ""I could shove your face right through that wall,"" just to keep from breaking down while opening one last fucking gift.  
I'll get through New Years Eve without you this year.

All of the times I had to grab my coat, purse, heart, and tongue, before putting on boots to leave after you'd tell me to ""fuck off.""  
If it helps, I'll even tow up the memories of walking through what I thought was our front door, (which you threw all of my belongings out of when you were done with me after a couple of years,) to the silence and your cold shoulder.  I'd break the silence by telling you that my tire went flat again, and how my car is burning oil somewhere but my hands were too cold to check it.  I'll remember your stoic responses, if you gave any at all.  I'd go another few months running low on oil and stopping here and there to fill my tires with air in hopes that maybe you'd change your mind about me, that you'd come help me get it fixed.

And I'll get through New Years without you next year.  I'll live moment to moment through all twelve empty months without you.  
I'll continue to wander aimlessly through the woods, stores, space, and time wondering what about me wasn't enough, and why you kept me around.  I'll marvel at the thought of still being here, or how I managed to stay in a space where I was so rejected and hated.  How it helped me down my spiral of being mostly dejected.

------------------------------------------------------

Foraging for edible plants in the wild can be an exciting and rewarding venture. However, safety is crucial to ensure a positive experience. Here are some techniques that will help you forage safely and with confidence.

### Know the Basics of Edible and Poisonous Plants

Before you set off into the wild, take some time to educate yourself about local edible plants and their toxic lookalikes. Here are some key points to remember:

- **Field Guides:** Invest in a good field guide specific to your region. This can help you identify plants accurately.
- **Trusted Sources:** Learn from experienced foragers or attend workshops to deepen your knowledge.
- **Botanical Groups:** Join local plant identification groups or forums online where you can share information and experiences.

### Carry Essential Tools

Having the right tools will make your foraging trip safer and more effective. Consider packing the following items:

- **Knife:** A small knife is handy for cutting plants without damaging roots.
- **Basket or Bag:** Use a breathable basket to store your finds. Avoid plastic bags, as they can trap moisture and spoil the plants.
- **Gloves:** Wear gloves to protect your hands from thorns, stings, or possible allergens.

### Learn the Environment

Understanding the ecosystem you're foraging in is crucial. Different plants thrive in different conditions, and knowing these can guide your search.

- **Soil Type:** Some plants prefer sandy soils, while others thrive in clay or loamy soils.
- **Sunlight Exposure:** Observe if plants grow in full sun, partial shade, or mostly shaded areas.
- **Seasons:** Different plants will be abundant in different seasons. Research what is in season to maximize your finds.

### Practice Responsible Foraging

It’s important to forage ethically and responsibly. Follow these guidelines to ensure sustainability:

- **Only Take What You Need:** Avoid overharvesting. This helps maintain the plant population for future foragers.
- **Don’t Disturb Wildlife:** Respect the habitats of wildlife. Be mindful of where you tread and avoid sensitive areas.
- **Leave No Trace:** Follow the Leave No Trace principles. Clean up after yourself and avoid leaving any trash behind.

### Utilize the “Universal Edibility Test”

If you're unsure whether a plant is safe to eat, the Universal Edibility Test is a helpful method for determining edibility:

1. **Prepare:** Choose a small portion of the plant.
2. **Skin Test:** Place a small piece on your skin and wait for 24 hours. If no reaction occurs, proceed to the next step.
3. **Smell:** Smell the plant to check for any off-putting or strange odors.
4. **Taste Test:** Chew a small piece without swallowing it. Wait for another 24 hours to see if any adverse effects arise.

It’s vital to not skip any of these steps as they help identify whether a plant is potentially safe for consumption.

### Stay Hydrated and Plan Ahead

Before heading out to forage, plan your trip carefully. Make sure you have enough water and snacks to keep your energy up. Here are some quick tips:

- **Timing:** Forage during cooler parts of the day, such as early morning or late afternoon.
- **Location:** Choose a safe foraging location away from roads and pollution to avoid contaminated plants.
- **Know Emergency Contacts:** Have a way to contact someone in case of an emergency or if you become lost.


By following these safe foraging techniques, you can enjoy the bounty of nature while minimizing risks. Remember, knowledge and preparation are your best allies in foraging successfully. Equip yourself with information, tools, and respect for the environment. This way, you can explore the wild with confidence and delight in the treasures it has to offer.

Identifying Common Edible Plants and Their Uses
-----------------------------------------------

Exploring the world of wild edibles can be an exciting adventure. As you walk through parks, fields, or even your backyard, you may be surprised at the variety of edible plants available. Understanding how to identify common edible plants can enhance your outdoor experiences and even assist in your survival skills. Below, discover some familiar edible plants along with their uses.

Check out the blog for more information https://griddownguide.com/how-do-i-forage-for-edible-plants-safely/  
  
### Dandelion

Dandelions are often overlooked as mere weeds, but they are a treasure trove of nutrition. Both the leaves and flowers are edible. Here’s how you can use them:

- **Leaves:** These can be added raw to salads or cooked like spinach.
- **Flowers:** You can make dandelion wine or use them in pancakes.
- **Roots:** Dandelion root can be roasted and brewed as a coffee substitute.

### Clover

Another common plant is clover, easily spotted with its three-leaf clumps. Clover is nutritious and full of protein. Here’s how you can incorporate clover into your diet:

- **Flowers:** The white and red blossoms are sweet and can be added to salads.
- **Leaves:** Young leaves are tender and can be used in soups or as a seasoning.

### Wild Garlic

Wild garlic is another gem often found in damp woodland areas. Recognizable by its strong scent, it can elevate many dishes. Here are its uses:

- **Leaves:** Use them fresh in salads or as a garnish in soups.
- **Bulbs:** The bulbs can be roasted or used in place of regular garlic for flavor.

### Plantain

This versatile plant grows in lawns and gardens. Both the broadleaf and narrowleaf varieties are edible. Here’s how you can use them:

- **Leaves:** Young leaves are tasty in salads; mature leaves are better cooked.
- **Seeds:** The seeds can be harvested and ground to make flour.
- **Infusion:** You can steep the leaves in hot water to make a soothing tea.

### Chickweed

Chickweed is a tender, mild-flavored plant ideal for fresh salads. Its small, star-like white flowers are a hallmark of this plant. Here’s how to use chickweed:

- **Raw:** Chickweed can be eaten fresh in salads.
- **Cooked:** You can also sauté it lightly with garlic or add it to soups.

### Mint

Many are familiar with mint as a culinary herb, but wild mint can be found in many places. The aromatic leaves can enhance your meals. Consider the following uses:

- **Fresh leaves:** These are great for flavoring drinks, salads, and desserts.
- **Tea:** Steep the leaves in hot water to create a refreshing herbal tea.

### Persimmons

If you're lucky enough to find wild persimmon trees, their fruit is a delightful treat. Both ripe and unripe fruit has different uses:

- **Ripe fruit:** Eaten fresh, it’s sweet and juicy.
- **Unripe fruit:** Can be used in cooking, as it is less sweet and more astringent.

### Wild Berries

While many locations offer a variety of wild berries, it's crucial to know which are safe to eat. Common types include:

Check out the blog for more information https://griddownguide.com/how-do-i-forage-for-edible-plants-safely/  
  
- **Blackberries:** Sweet and perfect for jams and desserts.
- **Blueberries:** Great for snacking or baking.
- **Raspberries:** Tart and delicious in numerous recipes.

Each of these plants has its unique characteristics and flavor profiles. Remember to forage responsibly. Always ensure you accurately identify them before consuming anything from the wild. When in doubt, consult a field guide or expert. This knowledge not only enhances your meals but connects you deepened appreciation for nature. So why not embark on your culinary journey into the wild and discover the flavors waiting for you?

### Conclusion

Foraging for edible plants can be an enriching and rewarding experience when done safely and knowledgeably. By implementing safe techniques while exploring the wild, you not only protect yourself but also enhance your ability to connect with nature. Always start by familiarizing yourself with the local environment and choosing well-trodden paths. Understanding how to observe the surroundings, practicing good hygiene, and respecting the ecosystem will ensure that you prosper as a forager.

Identifying common edible plants is a vital skill that unlocks a wide array of culinary possibilities. Whether you’re encountering dandelions, wild garlic, or clover, knowing their characteristics can make a huge difference in what you can safely consume. Make it a habit to learn about the plant's uses beyond just nourishment—many edible plants contain beneficial properties that can enhance your health or even serve as natural remedies.

As you embark on your foraging adventures, remember that practice builds confidence. Take the time to engage with local experts, join foraging workshops, or participate in community events. The more you immerse yourself in the world of edible plants, the more knowledgeable and skilled you will become.

Ultimately, foraging is about appreciating nature and maintaining a healthy relationship with the environment. So grab a basket, jot down a few notes, and get ready to safely explore the abundant, edible treasure just waiting to be discovered around you.

Eve got mad about it and told Taylor got mad and I think Taylor started to manipulate Eve. Eve and Taylor told me that Anna is a bad person, talked bad about me calling me a pick me etc. They also told me she supports the Israelis in Palestine and has a shrine for the Prime minister.

I texted him on Saturday to get coffee during work which he agreed to. I feel like he was flirty. He left his other friends to sit with me and we both ended up skipping work for a couple hours to talk. He moved from sitting opposite me to next to me. Played with my clothes and my fingers. We swapped phones and made a playlist together. He complemented me. I was really nervous and awkward but he’s really nice and fun. 

I felt really good afterwards, and texted him first, he responded to my initial text but nothing since, it’s radio silence again.

He needs constant petting and attention. Unfortunately we are not able to stay home as much for him due to work  and believe he could benefit from a bunny friend who can be with him 24/7. 

The rescued I talked to say that he has to stay at the rescue for at least a week for them to do the bonding process. Zion gets so stressed and depressed whenever we leave him at the sitter’s or boarder’s places when we go away on vacation. We had to cancel our trips or come back earlier upon discovering he stopped eating and would get very depressed. When he returned home, his poops would be very small and dried out from not eating at the sitter’s or boarder’s house. 

My concern is that he will not be able to stay at the rescue for a week key alone a few days due to his separation anxiety/depression which leads to stasis. I’m afraid he may die of stasis if we do.

My husband and I have no time to supervise the bunnies to go through the bonding at home.

Is there a way to resolve his need for companionship? I do want to get him a bunny friend but I don’t know how to do it. I’m just praying for a love at first sight situation for him where he would meet a bunny that does not require the bonding process.

Any thoughts or advice?

Eve got mad about it and told Taylor got mad and I think Taylor started to manipulate Eve. Eve and Taylor told me that Anna is a bad person, talked bad about me calling me a pick me etc. They also told me she supports the Israelis in Palestine and has a shrine for the Prime minister.

Today Anna confronted me with a cup of coffee and apologised in their name and feels bad for staying quiet through their discussions and not saying word, telling me that Taylor would laugh and  make  fun of all of my moves calling me socically inept (when they legit walked up to my bsf in uni—Olivia—and took a tomato with no questions asked).

The Beltel reports:

    A Stormont official’s suggestion that workers spend an extra week day working from home to help ease gridlock in Belfast city centre is “deeply disheartening”, an NI business leader has said.
    Department for Infrastructure (DfI) deputy secretary Colin Woods made the suggestion on Monday morning during a lengthy interview with BBC NI’s The Nolan Show.

    “If people would use public transport or work from home one day a week even, you would start to see significant reductions in congestion,” he said.

    “We hear the frustration people are expressing.

    “There is not enough space for vehicles trying to use (the roads) and we can see the impact on people’s journey times.

    “The network of streets in Belfast were laid out when horses and pedestrians were the only people using them and there isn’t the space to put as many vehicles as possible.”

That is an eminently sensible suggestion from Colin, one that I am sure would go down well with staff who are extremely reluctant to leave their warm, cosy homes to sit on the dark and gloomy Westlink for 2 hours a day, slowly watching their lifeforce leave their bodies.

There is just one problem. The Department for Infrastructure is one of the civil service departments trying to force people back into the office. I know staff there who have been told they must return to the office whether they like it or not.

These people have zero desire to lose two hours of their day commuting into Belfast. Going slowly mad with the gridlock traffic (courtesy of The Department for Infrastructure), paying £4 for a coffee, £7 for a sandwich, and a tenner for parking.

But, but, but, they should be taking public transport, I hear you cry. That’s a great idea, except the buses are also caught in the traffic, and trains are at capacity.

I suggest Colin Woods urgently requests a meeting with Colin Woods. I hear he is the kind of blue sky thinking problem-solving chap we need at a time like this.

We’ve all been there: huddled close, sharing a laugh, when suddenly, a whiff of something… unpleasant… wafts our way. It’s a universal social cringe. While we often point fingers at garlic, onions, or coffee, a more insidious culprit might be lurking in our pockets: the vape pen. But does vaping *really* contribute to bad breath? Let’s dive into this hazy topic and clear the air (pun intended!).

Can Vaping Cause Bad Breath? The Vapor Trail of Trouble
-------------------------------------------------------

Before we explore the specifics, it’s important to understand that bad breath, or halitosis, is typically caused by bacteria in the mouth. These little critters feast on food particles and release volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), which are the real source of the stink. Think of it like tiny, microscopic garbage disposals gone rogue. So, where does vaping fit into this equation?

### How Vaping Dries Out Your Mouth (Xerostomia and Halitosis)

One of the primary ways vaping contributes to bad breath is through dry mouth, also known as xerostomia. Picture your mouth as a self-cleaning oven. Saliva is like the self-cleaning cycle, washing away food particles and neutralizing those pesky VSCs. But vaping, much like smoking, can hinder this process. The ingredients in e-liquids, especially propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG), can absorb moisture, leaving your mouth feeling like the Sahara Desert. And in a dry mouth, bacteria thrive, leading to… you guessed it… bad breath. It's a vicious cycle.

### The Role of E-Liquid Ingredients (Flavorings, Nicotine, and More)

Think about your favorite vape flavor: sweet strawberry, cool mint, or maybe even a creamy dessert. While these flavors might tantalize your taste buds, some of the ingredients can linger in your mouth and contribute to unpleasant odors. Certain flavorings, especially the sweeter ones, can stick to your teeth and tongue, providing a veritable feast for bacteria. Additionally, nicotine itself can restrict blood flow to the gums, further impacting saliva production and exacerbating the problem. It’s a double whammy of dryness and sticky residue!

### Vaping and Gum Disease (The Link You Might Not Expect)

""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

Beyond dry mouth, vaping can also increase your risk of gum disease (gingivitis and periodontitis). The chemicals in vape aerosol can irritate the delicate gum tissue, making it more susceptible to inflammation and infection. And as we know, gum disease is a notorious contributor to bad breath – another piece of the puzzle. It’s like poking a bear – you’re just asking for trouble!

Can Vaping Cause Bad Breath? Beyond the Basics
----------------------------------------------

Now that we've covered the fundamentals, let's delve deeper into some less obvious ways vaping can impact your breath. It’s not just about dry mouth and flavorings; the picture is more complex than that.

### The Impact of Vaping Frequency (How Much is Too Much?)

Just like eating too much garlic, the more you vape, the more pronounced the effects on your breath can be. If you’re constantly puffing away, your mouth has less opportunity to rehydrate and clear out those odor-causing bacteria. Think of it as overloading the garbage disposal – eventually, it’s going to start to stink.

### Vaping and Your Overall Health (A Holistic Perspective)

Believe it or not, the impact of vaping on your breath can also be a reflection of its overall effects on your health. If vaping is causing inflammation or irritation in your respiratory system, this can indirectly contribute to bad breath. It’s like a canary in a coal mine – your breath might be trying to tell you something about your overall well-being.

### The Vaping Community and Breath Awareness (Addressing the Elephant in the Room)

Let’s be honest, talking about bad breath can be awkward. But it’s important for the vaping community to address this issue openly and honestly. Greater awareness can lead to better hygiene practices and help vapers minimize the impact on their breath. It's like ripping off a band-aid – it might sting a little at first, but it’s better in the long run.

Can Vaping Cause Bad Breath? Practical Tips for Fresher Vapor
-------------------------------------------------------------

So, what can you do about it? Thankfully, there are steps you can take to combat vape-related bad breath. Here are a few tips to keep your breath minty fresh:

1. **Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate!** Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your mouth moist and wash away debris.
2. **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Brush and floss regularly, and consider using a tongue scraper to remove bacteria from the surface of your tongue.
3. **Chew Sugar-Free Gum:** Chewing gum stimulates saliva production, helping to neutralize those foul-smelling VSCs.
4. **Choose Less Sugary E-Liquids:** Opt for flavors that are less likely to stick to your teeth and create a breeding ground for bacteria.
5. **Consider Reducing Your Vaping Frequency:** Giving your mouth a break can allow it to recover and rehydrate.
6. **See Your Dentist Regularly:** Regular checkups can help identify and address any underlying oral health issues, including gum disease.
7. **Carry Breath Mints or Mouthwash:** These can provide a temporary fix in a pinch.

Beyond Vaping: Other Causes of Bad Breath (Ruling Out the Usual Suspects)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

It’s important to remember that vaping isn't the *only* cause of bad breath. Other factors, such as certain medical conditions, medications, and dietary habits, can also contribute to halitosis. If you’re concerned about your breath, it’s always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical issues.

Conclusion: Clearing the Air on Vaping and Bad Breath
-----------------------------------------------------

So, can vaping cause bad breath? The evidence suggests a resounding ""yes."" While vaping might not be the sole culprit, it can certainly contribute to the problem, primarily through dry mouth, e-liquid ingredients, and its potential link to gum disease. However, with proactive measures like staying hydrated, practicing good oral hygiene, and being mindful of your vaping habits, you can mitigate the impact on your breath and keep things fresh.

I take a drink of my coffee and savor the silence, the calm, and the freedom to ponder without being interrupted by anything.

 

This is savoring. It's an act of magic.

 

A good meal is typically savored by putting a single square of dark chocolate in your mouth without chewing or swallowing it. As it melts in your mouth, let it sit there and enjoy its earthy aromas, citrus undertones, and creamy texture. After allowing it to linger, you swallow it almost regrettably, enjoying its deliciousness and considering the individuals who farmed the beans, roasted and ground them, and fashioned them by hand into this square of delight.

 

Savoring food is only the beginning, though; you should and can relish anything. It's fulfilling. And everything is altered. You may learn to be aware, to stop putting things off, to exercise at last, to eat less and more healthy, to live in the now, and much more by savoring.

 

*The way to develop the habit of savoring is to pause when something is beautiful and good and catches our attention - the sound of rain, the look of the night sky - the glow in a child's eyes, or when we witness some kindness. Pause... then totally immerse in the experience of savoring it. \~ Tara Brach*

 

**What Does It Mean to Savor Life?**

 

The phrase ""savor life"" refers to the ability to appreciate and pay attention to life's wonderful daily gifts. It may entail paying attention to your feelings, to the minor details of your day. Realizing the relationships in your life has more meaning. Being thankful while engaging in activities you enjoy. Eat with an awareness so you are fully embracing the flavors. Take pleasure in routine tasks. Slowing down and not rushing through life. Living life to the fullest can improve mental health by lowering stress and boosting resilience.

 

Using ideas to heighten the intensity, length, and pleasure of pleasant feelings and experiences is known as savoring. In order to relish an experience, you must first be totally present in every way. This includes feeling your body completely and taking in all the subtleties that contributed to the event's richness. After that, you must recall a fond memory and spend a few minutes relaxing in the moment.

 

The constructive alternative to coping is to recognize and value life's pleasant features. Savoring entails mindfulness and conscious attention to the experience of pleasure besides enjoyment. When you consciously work to prolong a pleasant experience, you are savoring it.

 

Savoring, then, is the deliberate and concentrated enjoyment of something wonderful in order to heighten, deepen, and improve the positive experience. Subsequently, being able to associate that event with an accessible memory. Like a small, memory bank of wonderful remembrances that may be accessed at a later time.

 

*Seize every second of your life and savor it. Value your present moments. \~ Wayne Dyer*

 

**Savoring Is A Practice**

 

Enjoy a warm cup a tea once a day is a wonderful indulgence to have. My Aunt Marylou showed me when I was very young how to make tea, which I enjoy since it's so light (compared to sugary coffee beverages) that you have to pay close attention to get the most out of it.

 

You slow down when you enjoy tea, chocolate, or a handful of fruit. You listen carefully; the more attentive you are, the more you will enjoy the moment. Instead of hurrying on to the next thing, you pause and allow the activity some room. You are living in the moment, not worrying about what has to be done later.

 

Savoring is what this is, and it requires practice. No matter where you are, you may take a moment to stop, take in your surroundings, and enjoy the present. Enjoy it even if it doesn't feel spectacular because you've done it a thousand times. Give the present you've received your full appreciation.

 

Find a few rituals for savoring, such as taking a bath, reading to your child, having a tea ritual in the middle of the day, snuggling with a loved one, or enjoying your morning coffee. This is a conscious practice that you may perform many times a day. You'll get better the more you practice.

 

*Every morning I awake torn between a desire to save the world and an inclination to savor it. This makes it hard to plan the day. But if we forget to savor the world, what possible reason do we have for saving it? In a way, the savoring must come first. \~ E. B. White*

 

**Why You Procrastinate**

 

You put things off because you find them unpleasant or uncomfortable and prefer to do activities that are more familiar. Since writing that report, article, or chapter is challenging, you would rather check your emails and complete a few minor jobs. Delaying those strenuous activities is easy.

 

Savoring, however, can assist. The method is the same for anything, from filing taxes to cleaning your bathroom, so let's use writing as an example. You know it's essential, and you have something to write. ""Okay, I should write this, but maybe I'll check to see if anything important came into my email first,"" is the standard response. And maybe my Facebook and Twitter accounts as well. Oh, what is this fascinating piece I came across?

 

Take this writing activity and slow it down when you relish it. Give the task time; you don't jump on to the next item. You see it and identify its pleasant features. In fact, if you slow down and focus, there are delightful parts of any task. When you savor, you note these things and give them your complete attention. You allow yourself to find joy in the activity and the pleasure of accomplishing the task and revel in the present moment.

 

You therefore sit there with the writing rather than moving on to something else. Since you're enjoying this, you can't merely switch, so you acknowledge and resist the impulse to do so. You let them go while you consider other things you must accomplish. Here, you're enjoying.

 

*Sometimes we need the salt of tears to remind us how to savor the sweetness of life.        \~ Lysa TerKeurst*

 

**Choices In What You Can Do Right Now**

 

As one writes, you just observe how your fingers feel on the keys, relish the sensation of your thoughts spilling onto the screen, and pay attention to your breathing, shoulders, jaw, legs, and feet. You are thankful for this moment since you know many individuals are not fortunate enough to accomplish something as opulent as writing.

 

""Am I doing the right thing, right now?"" is a common cause of worry for most individuals in this day and age when you can do nearly anything at any time. Instead, should I be working out? Should I check my social networks to see what else is happening? Does anyone else have a better idea? Is there a better tool, a more efficient approach, or a quicker way to accomplish this?

 

This worry might vanish as you savor. You let go of all other ideas and immerse yourself in this activity because you are enjoying it. You give it room and simply do this, and you are very grateful for it. Nothing can be as wonderful as enjoying this moment, so you know that whatever you're doing right now is great.

 

*Try to acquire the weird practice of savoring your mistakes, delighting in uncovering the strange quirks that led you astray. Then, when you have sucked out all the goodness to be gained from having made them, you can cheerfully forget them and go on to the next big opportunity. \~ Daniel Dennett*

 

**Eating Mindfully**

 

Overeating is one issue (perhaps the primary issue) that contributes to the obesity of many people. Eating a lot of food rapidly is a major contributing factor to overeating. Devour it because it's delicious! Get some more, too! Society has been encouraging this behavior for years.

 

However, I've also learned to appreciate my cuisine most of the time. You don't just shove food down your throat when you do this; instead, you give it room, taste it, and pause for each mouthful rather than reaching for the next one as soon as the last one is in your mouth. This implies that you truly pay attention to every bite's flavor and texture and consider its origin, manufacturer, ingredients (hopefully free of chemicals), and potential health benefits.

 

When you take your time and enjoy every meal, it's difficult to overeat. In this manner, you may also learn to like healthy meals, like dark leafy greens or raw pistachios and walnuts or plain Greek yogurt or tofu. Because you only need a small amount to really appreciate birthday cake, you can eat to rejuvenate your body most of the time and then indulge in a small amount without going overboard.

 

*I was taken by the power that savoring a simple cup of coffee can have to connect people and create community. \~ Howard Schultz*

 

**You Must Live in the Present to Savor Life**

 

You are so frequently motivated by haste and immediacy. Better, faster, and more. Living in a society where your head is mostly focused on the past or the future, but your body lives in the present. What has become of living?

 

I want you to do just one thing today: savor.

 

Enjoy every moment and all you do. No moment is too little to be cherished, not even the mundane ones, the arguments with others, or the times when you're alone yourself and have nothing to do. The art of savoring is learning to live in the present, to appreciate each moment as a gift, and to give it the time and consideration it merits. It's a simple practice, but it requires repetition.

 

Savor and enjoy every second of your day by absorbing what makes you feel alive, like the ability to accept what causes you pain and annoyance or to enjoy a meal with no interruptions or electronics. You, the meal, and your taste sensations are all that are involved. You are the only one who is completely enjoying the flavors in your tongue and how they support your body.

 

Go take a stroll down the street while taking in your surroundings. In what way does your foot press against the ground or note the cloud formations or the hue of the sky? The puppy barks and wags its tails. What sensations of pain, suffering, happiness, and vitality do you feel?  Sensing the experience of another person's delight and then letting go.

 

*The French have no such expression as 'killing time.' In their more philosophical vocabulary, the term is 'passing time,' which means savoring all moments of it each to his individual enjoyment. While we battle with time, they relax with tempo. \~ Cornelia Otis Skinner*

 

**How To Better Relish Life**

 

Take part in the experience on purpose. To savor an experience positively, you must fully immerse yourself in it, be aware of every detail you can take in, and truly appreciate it. In fact, attempt to relish in the moment.

 

Look for specifics. No detail, insight, or emotion is too minor to enrich the experience.

Make use of all your senses. Examine and feel each sensation separately. Every good encounter has taste, smell, sound, sight, and sensation; look for them. Have your own unique experience with each.

 

You should listen to the information your body is providing you when you lie in bed at night. Tightness. Tension. Relaxation. Calm. By slowing down and paying attention to your body when it talks, you may establish the ritual of mindfulness.

 

Move past your senses now. Feelings, energies, souls, spirits, and memories transcend the limitations and faults of the senses. Songs, scents, flavors, and sensations transcend our current consciousness and understanding.

 

Let's try an exercise using an activity you enjoy. Choose something you truly love. Do it for at least 5 minutes. Be deliberate and write about the experience of savoring it as profoundly as you can. How did it feel? Which tale was it? Which memories did it evoke?

 

*Slow living is a curious mix of being prepared and being prepared to let go. Caring more and caring less. Saying yes and saying no. Being present and walking away. Doing the important things and forgetting those that aren’t. \~  Brooke McAlary*

 

**Moving Forward Savoring Life**

 

Life is not brief. When you take the time to enjoy and value every day, it's actually very lengthy.  Pay attention. Purposely be conscious of the experience. As you experience and remember, pay attention to your breathing and your soulful self.  Pay attention. Develop your mental toughness and push yourself to concentrate fully on the task at hand.

 

Identify and record the times when you feel stimulated and captivated. Recognize and journal about the times when you feel exhausted and irritated. To only observe, without passing judgment.

 

Reduce the speed with which you move through life. Pause and extend the moment in a good way. You can't really experience everything a situation may offer if you rush through it. Take a moment to breathe in the fresh air. Take your time at being fully present.

 

If you took more time to embrace life and relish it, I wonder what would happen to our planet.

 

*I've always believed in savoring the moments. In the end, they are the only things we'll have.      \~ Anna Godbersen*

 

As you become more mindful of the moments in your life and become courageous about savoring all parts of your life, happiness is the natural outcome.

1hayy9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1hayy9p/ive_eaten_the_same_thing_for_the_past_two_months/,I've eaten the same thing for the past two months and lost 14 lbs. How can I make my diet more healthy and sustainable?,"Hey all\~!

I'm 19M, 5'7"" and currently weigh 160lbs. Two months ago, I weighed about 175lbs. To lose weight, all I have changed is my diet, but I changed it BIG. I used to eat greasy fried foods, junk food, and ultra processed snacks for every meal. I was easily eating almost 3,000 calories a day. The main reason I changed my diet was for weight loss, but the only reason I've stuck with it is because of how good it makes me feel. I didn't realize how awful all that shitty food made me feel everyday until I switched to healthy foods.

So, now to my diet! I have eaten basically the same thing every day for the past nine weeks:

Breakfast: I have two cups of coffee with zero sugar creamer (30 calories), one piece of fruit, either an apple or a banana (120 calories), and two slices of multigrain toast (180 calories).

Lunch: I often don't eat lunch, but when I do, I either have a zero carb vanilla protein shake (250 calories, 35g protein) or a fruit smoothie (260 calories).

Dinner: I always eat the same meal for dinner: a grilled chicken salad with low calorie salad dressing and low fat cheese. The calories vary a bit depending on my portion size for the night, but I always eat about 200-300g of grilled chicken breast, two servings of a salad mix (I want to do homemade salad but I don't know where to start...), two servings of low fat cheese, and one serving of low calorie salad dressing. This averages to about 500 calories usually, sometimes less sometimes more. On days where I don't eat lunch, I then have the protein shake or fruit smoothie with dinner (often the smoothie cause the shake is hard to get down...)

Snacks: I used to be really bad at snacking, often eating like 1,000 calories of pure junk food like chips and cakes every day. But after changing my mindset to only eat for fuel, I found my snacking has drastically decreased. I now only have one snack: flavored rice cakes. They're like 60 calories a piece and so so good. I've actually been trying to cut them out of my diet, but it's tough haha. I eat about 4 rice cakes (240 calories) throughout the day. Mostly at night before bed (I know it's bad I'm trying to stop LOL).

Well, sorry for that long walk through of my eating! I just really have fallen in love with trying to fuel my body with good food instead of junk. I've never eaten like this in my life, and it feels really rewarding. However, I also feel like my diet could be improved A LOT. One, I don't think I eat enough right now. This is due to the weight loss aspect, but I want this to be sustainable, not just a quick ""cut calories and bounce back."" Two, I'm trying to eat ""whole foods"" but I'm not really doing a good job. I still use coffee creamer, protein powder, frozen fruit, premade salad mixes, processed cheese. I could be doing a lot better, I think, but it's just really hard to shop for this stuff when I've never done it before. I also dislike eating a lot of protein heavy foods, like meat and eggs, so it's tough to get my protein intake up.

I think I'm on the right track for changing my life for the better, but I have a lot to improve on. Which is why I'm making this post! I am humbly asking for any and all advice regarding a healthy diet and lifestyle, because I am making this change a new lifestyle, and not just a fad diet!

Got diagnosed a few months ago along with ADHD and anxiety, but figured that the OCD was mild based on what I knew - also because the doctors I have access to here can sometimes not be very reliable which makes all the consultations and prescriptions a little hard to trust.

Recently there's been a noticeable increase in my lifelong habit of picking at my skin. Thought it was common/benign but recently I've been doing it a lot more than before. Not only do I pick at the sides of fingernails to the point of sometimes bleeding, but I'm now constantly trying to separate my fingernails from the skin underneath because the way the fingernails sit naturally on my skin feels like torture. I really can't explain it, and it's getting a little bit scary how fixated my mind becomes on this and interrupts pretty much any task in my day. It's also affecting my relationship with my wife, which is probably the issue that set me in motion in taking all of this seriously.

I'm actively getting more professional help despite the limitations in my country of residence, but I also want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience. Did any specific medications or therapies help? Is meditation and breath work helpful at all for this? Most importantly, do I have to give up coffee? 

Excuse my ignorance please, just really new to addressing all of this and understanding its impact. Would really love some recommendations on learning these behaviors, whether it's a book, article, doc, etc.

$Shibussy: The tired revolution, or whatever

$Shibussy is like... doing crazy stuff. Numbers go up, lines go brrr, and the chart looks like it's had way too much coffee. Launched on Base just 8 days ago, this token's been growing faster than my need for sleep. The community's wild even though everyone's kinda tired, but the vibes are totally sleepy-awesome. Grab a pillow, or a coffee, or whatever, and stay tired with Shibussy.

Key Highlights of Shibussy:

- Rapid Growth: Since its launch, $Shibussy has shown impressive growth in both value and community engagement.

- Community Vibes: The community is always buzzing, despite being a bit sleepy. It's a mix of fun, tired humor, and genuine excitement.

- Continuous Buzz: With charts looking like they've had a shot of espresso, $Shibussy is capturing attention and keeping everyone on their toes.
