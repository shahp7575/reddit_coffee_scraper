1nn8tzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/1nn8tzo/i_f_had_my_first_encounter_with_a_bicurious_woman/,I (F) had my first encounter with a bi-curious woman… I now understand…,"I’m a 25 y/o bi woman. I have a small friend group, and one girl in that group (Emma) has been open about exploring her sexuality. My first time really meeting her/going out with our now group of friends was last November, and one of the first things she asked me was if I’m into girls. I said of course, I swing both ways. That was that. Her, her roommate, myself, and my roommate have all become a tight group of friends since then. 

I was unaware at the time that she hardly had had any experience with men, let alone women. She’s outgoing so I just assumed she was experienced when she initially asked if I was into girls as well. However, I was never attracted to her and would not/have not pursued her. 

Fast forward to last weekend — I match with a girl on Hinge and she was looking for a FWB arrangement, which I was seeking as well. She also wanted to make new friends since she’s new to the area! I thought it was perfect, she’ll have a blast with my group I’ve gotten close with this past year! 

I bring my friend Emma along with me to my Hinge date’s place and we all go to the bars. However, Emma was like… overly excited. She blatantly ignored me and I literally felt like I was third wheeling between her and my Hinge date. Okay, whatever, weird.

Now to yesterday… we threw a party at my place for my roommate’s birthday. I had sent the invite to my Hinge date while we were out at the bars last weekend. But halfway through last week, Emma says to me “oh ___ is coming on Saturday, I hit her up!” And I was like hm… okay. I know. I sent her the invite? 

Then all throughout the night, Emma was embarrassing tf outta herself. At one point, my Hinge date turned to me and said “I’m gonna go sit down!” And I said “oh okay! Like on the couch? I’ll come wi-“ and before I could even finish my sentence, Emma interrupts and says “OH I’LL COME SIT WITH YOU!”… and actively speed walks past me on the way to the couch. My roommate and his girlfriend were already on the couch with my dog, so there was only room for 2 more people. Emma laps me around the coffee table and plops right down next to my Hinge date, basically on top of her. She literally accidentally elbowed me in the head in the process of her darting around the coffee table to sit down. I felt so incredibly awkward, so I just reached to pet my dog from across the coffee table while standing, then just… grabbed my phone and drink I had just set down and walked away. 

This was also right after my Hinge date asked if I wanted to sit outside, and Emma followed us out and yet again bolted past me and sat on the outdoor loveseat practically on top of her. I then just sat on a separate chair completely across from them because there was no room for me. I got up and walked away after like 5 mins. 

Then my Hinge date mentioned she planned on getting drunk yesterday at the party and someone had asked if she drove here — Emma proceeded to jump in and say “oh yeah I already invited her to our place to sleep since she’s drinking!” I was like ???? Major side eye. 

I now understand why there’s hesitation around bi-curious women among us bisexuals and even within the lesbian community. I was confused about the “hostility” (for lack of a better term) I faced from women when I myself was exploring yearsss ago. Emma was just treating my Hinge date like fresh meat or something? Like I had literally never seen her act like that before. She almost acted like a creepy man who’s just overly excited to get handsy. Throwing herself — literally — on her and inserting herself?? I don’t know, I’ve never experienced this before and it’s just weird. 

Emma had also went on 2 dates with 2 different men from Hinge last week too?? And one literally picked her up from the bar on Friday, the day before our party the next day ??? Like can I spend time with my date, please ?????",0,1758502581.0,bisexual,0,0.5,False
1nn8tnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1nn8tnt/26_m4f_in_a_newly_enm_dynamic_and_looking_for/,26 [M4F] In a newly ENM dynamic and looking for people that have a lack of attention in their everyday life and a desire for it to increase (details in post!) #Australia #Online,"Hi everyone!

Me and my partner have just recently become ENM (her idea) due to her lack of motivation for going on dates or anything of a sexual nature (due to her busy work schedule as well as personal reasons). I’ve had one good experience so far but since then I’ve really been struggling on the apps to find someone interested in our specific scenario.

A little about me: I’m 26 male, Italian/Australian with a decent build (that’s improving due to gym 4 days a week). I am into all things video games and pop culture (so your typical movies and tv shows that goes along with all that), I love my sports (AFL and Formula one my two standouts but I have a team in basically all AU and US sports) and just in general love spending the plethora of free time I have either with my friends getting dinner/lunch/coffee or going out drinking, or having nights in with the cats and watching movies (hopefully with a new cuddle buddy in one of you soon haha).

I Just thought I’d make this post to see if their are any women that would love a higher level of attention, messages, sexting, dates or basically any form of attention they would want. I am full time work from home and my job isn’t really that busy so I have so much free time I could devote directly to you.

I'm basically looking for someone that is okay that I have a primary partner and very willing to receive more attention. I am also super flexible regarding what this 'attention' can look like, so whether that's daily chats and fun (both in person and online) or once a week/fortnight. Whatever 'attention' means to you in regards to what you're lacking and would love in your life I'm fairly certain I can fill that role.

Not being interested in in-person meetups is not a deal breaker either! But ideally i'd like to have a minimum of an online dynamic that also has a sexual component (due to my high sex drive). But happy to define this a little more once we connect!

If any of this sounds interesting to you please feel free to send me a DM! we can just chat to start with some pic exchanges to see if we’re interested in one another and I can give you more specific info on the dynamic and we can take it from there?

Hope to hear from some of you!26 \[M4F\] In a newly ENM dynamic and looking for people that have a lack of attention in their everyday life and a desire for it to increase (details in post!)",1,1758502557.0,r4r,1,1.0,True
1nn8tal,https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1nn8tal/the_seagulls_are_bringing_my_mother_back_to_me/,"The seagulls are bringing my mother back to me, piece by piece by piece.","


The first morning, it was a dull gray tooth, speckled with sand and smelling strongly of brine, deposited on my bedroom windowsill like a gift. I didn’t understand how it was on the *inside* of my home, given that the window had been closed and locked all night.

I tried not to think about it.

The next morning? It was a damp white clot the size of a golf-ball, with a cloudy pupil and an iris the color of moss, a lush and familiar green-brown. 

Woke up earlier that morning, before sunrise. I could still hear them - the flock. Cawing on my front lawn. Tapping along the shingles. Skittering somewhere inside my house, though it was hard to say *where* exactly. Sounded like they were in the walls, but the space was only a few inches thick. They couldn’t fit. Lying in bed, desperately pretending to be asleep, I theorized they must be in the vents, then; it’s the only hollow space they could fit in.

Some quiet part of myself knew that theory was wrong, though.

They were inside the walls.

Even if they shouldn’t be able to fit.

The third night, it was a finger, swollen with sea-rot and inflexibly straight, as if pointing, the digit severed mid-accusation. They left it for me to find on the windowsill, same with the eye, same with the tooth. At that point, I could deny the truth no longer.

There was a wedding ring tightly fixed on the finger, and I recognized the jewelry.

They were bringing her back to me.

\- - - - - 

I threw those profane totems in the trash, slamming the steel lid shut like they were liable to jump out after me. Within the hour, I had my real estate agent on the phone. He kept asking me questions, but I couldn’t make out what he was saying. High-pitched static plagued our connection. My end of it, at least. He claimed he could hear me just fine.

Out of the blue, inexplicably, I had an idea.

*“Could you hold on a second?”*

I set the phone down, paced across the kitchen, opened the trashcan, and submerged the water-logged flesh under a thick layer of unused coffee grounds; a makeshift burial for a few fractions of my long-lost mother.

When I got back on the line, the connection was crystal clear.

*“Yup, I can hear you now. Bad coverage, I guess.”*

I walked into the backyard, closing the screen door behind me. The gulls hadn’t delivered an ear yet, but I didn’t think that precluded the flesh from hearing me.

*“Tim, I need you to get me the fuck out of this house,”* I whispered.

Wild fear thrummed at the base of my skull. My mind raced, imagining all the possibilities.

The sun was setting.

I wondered what the flock was going to bring me tonight.

\- - - - - 

Before the week was up, I’d moved to the opposite end of the city. Not sure why I believed that’d make a damn bit of difference, but I couldn’t do *nothing*.

Without skipping a beat, they started from the beginning.

The first night, it was a tooth.

The next, an eye, and then, a pointing finger with a wedding ring.

There was only one difference.

Each piece was lightly dusted with unused coffee grounds.

So I moved again. Didn’t even bother unpacking. Clearly, I hadn’t traveled far enough. I needed to migrate further from the sea, further inland. That’s where I’d be safe.

When I arrived at my next home, two states over, I felt a glimmer of hope in my chest. Nothing changed, though.

The first night, it was a tooth.

What’s worse, the flock seemed to be getting angry with my futile relocations. I don’t think I slept that first night, and yet, when I examined myself in the bathroom mirror the following morning, I found my skin newly covered in cuts and bruises. Nips and pecks up both forearms, across my chest, down my back - everywhere - and I didn’t feel any pain until I laid my eyes on the wounds. Standing in front of my reflection, mouth gaping, color draining from my face, agony rushed across my body like a tidal wave, the sensation of a hundred beaks pulling and prodding at my skin until it burst.

The second night, I attempted to catch them in the act.

When I heard them cawing on the front lawn, I leapt out of bed and sprinted to the window, pulling the blinds up with such force that the drawstring broke.

Didn’t see a single gull outside, but I heard a bevy of gentle wingbeats overhead. They moved before I could get a look. Maddened by exhaustion, I bolted out of the bedroom, to the windows on the opposite side of the house. I was dead-set on at least *seeing* them.

As I tumbled through the hallway, panting, tripping over myself, there was the soft, muffled clicking of talons meeting wood beside me.

They were in the walls.

With a grin and an uncontrolled fit of laughter, I ran downstairs and pulled a hammer from a half-empty moving box. I stood still. Steadied my breathing and perked my ears. Another few muffled clicks emanated from somewhere behind me.

I swung around and sent the hammer’s claw crashing into the plaster. When I wrenched it out, I saw a glimpse of something in the small, splintered hole.

Pulpy, white, feathered meat, squishing through the crawlspace at an unnatural speed.

Something about the sight extinguished my frenzy.

I released my grip. The hammer clattered to the floor. I collapsed shortly thereafter.

Cautiously, tears welling under my bloodshot eyes, I plodded towards the hole. Once I was close enough, I placed two trembling lips to the orifice.

*“Hey…M-Mom…M-Mom…I’m…I’m sorry,”* I muttered, pleading, groveling.

*“No more deal…no more deal…”*

I repeated that phrase over, and over, and over, and over again, until sleep finally took me.

Some time later, bright light gleamed against my closed eyes, body cradled tightly in the fetal position, head resting on the floor.

My eyelids creaked open. My vision focused.

A single cloudy pupil stared back at me.

\- - - - - 

Want to know the worst part?

I don’t even remember *what* we argued about, all those years ago.

I mean, I was eight, for Christ’s sake.

We were at the beach, just her and me. I don’t remember the car ride. I don’t recall walking along the boardwalk or setting up our umbrella in the sand.

I just remember anger. Vicious, seething, white-hot anger.

I sat on our towel, stewing, rage marinating in its own venomous juices. She was ignoring me, reading a book, sipping dark liquor from a silver flask. Or maybe she was trying to start a conversation; maybe I was the one ignoring her. Maybe the flask is a detail I added after the fact, something to make me feel better about my part in her disappearance. It’s all so hazy.

At some point, she stood. Went to the bathroom, I think.

While she was gone, something began creeping towards me from across the beach.

Superficially, it *looked* like a gull - beady eyes with gray wings and a down-turned beak - but there was something fundamentally wrong with it. I could see chaotic clusters of tangled blood vessels throbbing beneath its chest. Its breathing was hoarse, labored, and deep. It walked on a pair of six-toed feet, most of which were talons, but some of them were more akin to elongated, human-like toes.

No one seemed bothered by its presence. Kids ran by it without blinking. Adults talked and laughed and threw frisbees around it, completely indifferent to the creature.

Eventually, it was right in front of our umbrella, unblinking eyes locked on mine, and I sort of just…knew.

This thing was offering me something. 

A deal. 

And I was still so, so angry.

I wanted Mom gone. 

Vanished. Extinct.

I wished her *dead*.

The gull’s beak rasped open. A wet, pink tongue unfurled from inside its mouth, unraveling like a fire hose that’d been coiled into a taut spiral. The glistening appendage twirled towards me until it landed at my feet.

It wanted something in return.

It desired tribute.

Something to seal the deal.

I didn’t have much of myself to give, but before too long, I had an idea.

I reached into my mouth and pinched one of my upper canines. It was a baby tooth. A part of myself that was due to fall from me any day now. I twisted and yanked on the canine until its thready connections broke. Without hesitation, I laid the chunk of bloodstained enamel onto the tongue. Like the crack of a whip, the salivating tendril and its prize receded, flying back into the hungry blackness of its maw. The sound of it chewing on my tooth, grounding it into a fine dust, was unbearable. 

Suddenly, movement in my peripheral vision pulled my attention away from the gull.

It was Mom.

She was walking towards the ocean, arms fully extended at her shoulders, her body a cross. Her steps were languid, but deliberate. Like the gull, nobody seemed bothered by her odd spectacle. Even when her legs carried her into the ocean, even when her head disappeared below the tide, no one cared.

I cared. I think I cared.

Or maybe I smiled.

Like I said, my memories are hazy.

This was all so long ago.

\- - - - - 

Fearing the damage that might be done if I don’t stay put, I haven’t moved a fourth time.

Over the last few months, they’ve returned most of her to me. Unsure of what else to do, I've decided to give Mom a true burial. 

Her piecemeal body looms below the dirt in my backyard.

As I type this, I can hear her through my closed bedroom window.

She isn’t speaking, per se.

The sound is higher. Shrill, guttural, dripping with spite and confusion.

A caw of sorts. 

Mom wants me to know that she feels like I did that day.

So, so angry.

And once she’s finally complete, I think she’ll find me.

She’ll rise from the earth, trudging through the house in the dead of night. 

From the false safety of my bed, I’ll hear her lumber up the stairs, down the hall, and into my room, with a question burning on the tip of her festering tongue.

Mom will want to know why I did that to her, why I agreed to its deal.

I think she’ll be curious about why I was so, so angry as well. 

And when she realizes I don’t have anything to tell her, when she really understands that I don’t have an explanation to give,

She was my first girlfriend (I’m 32M she’s 30F) and I was her first boyfriend—we were together for 3 years when I was 22 and she was 20. We didn’t break up because of cheating or a third party, we just outgrew each other while starting our careers and lost time for each other, but we ended on good terms. I eventually moved on, even had another relationship that didn’t work out, and I had no idea what happened to her since I changed my Facebook and we had no mutual friends. Then on March 1, 2025 I ran into her at a mall, recognized her instantly, and we both looked shocked. She was alone, so I casually asked if she had a husband and she laughed saying she had no plans, which loosened me up. We decided to eat together even though I’d already eaten, and honestly the whole time I just wanted to freeze the moment—she looked even more beautiful, smelled the same as when we were dating, and it all felt familiar. After grabbing coffee we parted ways but when I got home I added her online and she accepted quickly, then we started chatting like teenagers again. I can’t hide how much kilig I feel right now. Last night she even posted lyrics on her story that went “All along there was some invisible string tying you to me?” and it made me wonder if I’m reading too much into it. Is it normal for a 30-year-old guy to feel this giddy and hopeful? Ladies, I’d love your advice. For fun I even posted lyrics from “Marry Me” by Train on my own story and she replied “Sino naman? 😛😛” What does that even mean haha.",1,1758502064.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

My alarm would go off, I'd hit snooze three or four times, and then stumble out of bed feeling groggy, dehydrated, and just... off. My brain felt fuzzy, and I'd immediately be on the hunt for coffee just to feel like a human.

I’m a big believer that ""the way you start your day determines how you live your day."" And if that's true, I was setting myself up for a very slow, sleepy day, every single time.

So I decided to try something almost ridiculously simple. The moment my alarm goes off, before I even look at my phone, I do two things: I open my blinds to let the light in, and I immediately drink a full glass of water.
That's it. No scrolling. No emails. Just two very basic actions.

And honestly? It's been a game-changer. The sunlight on my face is a biological cue for my body to wake up, and the water is like a jolt of hydration that tells my brain it's time to get going. It takes less than a minute, but it completely resets my energy and mindset. It feels like I'm giving myself a fresh start before the day's chaos begins.

Didn’t want to make this too long, but I shared more thoughts in my profile journal.

I'm super curious to hear from you. What's that one tiny, non-negotiable thing you do that just makes your morning feel right?

We stayed at Charter Hotel in downtown Seattle the night before the cruise. Lovely hotel and perfectly located pre-cruise. The next morning we took an Uber black car (so much luggage!) to Pier 66. It was around 10:00 am and we immediately found a porter and went in to the terminal. Checked in and waited in the Main room until maybe 11:00 am and began boarding. Very organized and orderly. Made our way to the Surf Bar up top for a few drinks before lunch at American Diner and set sail for Alaska.

We were on the 9 day so had extended days in Alaskan ports. It was our first time here but after enjoying such leisurely days in ports, I would never book a shorter cruise. We truly were able to explore and wander and enjoy every nook and cranny!

We enjoyed our dining. We were in a Club Balcony ""Suite"" on Deck 15 and went to the Observation Lounge every day, just a short walk forward from our stateroom, it was lovely.  Got a coffee from Starbucks daily using the app and YES rewards points were recorded regardless of what everyone says! We would get croissants and boxed cereal to take back to the stateroom.  Just perfect, really. Loved the stateroom for the proximity to Observation Lounge.  I think we will always book Deck 15 ona Breakaway+ ship going forward. A few days we would go up to buffet for eggs and one day we ordered Room Service which was a bargain at $4.99 + tip. Saved us a lot of time in Juneau!

Our itinerary was:
Seattle
Sea Day
Sitka
Juneau 
Skagway
Ketchikan 
Sea Day 
Victoria BC
Seattle

We walked around Sitka and went to the Orthodox Church. Nothing else really to see there. In Juneau, we booked Harv and Marv's whale watching excursion and it was excellent!! Skagway we did the cruise excursion of White Pass Railway which was fantastic, a very relaxing train ride with jaw-dropping scenery.  We had a tour bus back down that stopped at Alaska 360 for gold panning; we thought it was a bit corny and headed into the gift shop for coffee and cookies. In Ketchikan, we just walked around and had a blast! Ended up eating a delicious and memorable pizza at Panhandle Pizza on Dock Street. Perfect day just wandering Ketchikan for hours; you gotta love the long port stops on this itinerary. 

We were in Victoria, BC for 13 hours!  A gorgeous day just wandering and shopping. A charming city!

Did I mention yet that our cruise was blessed with perfect weather? When booking near the end of the Alaska season, you really have to think about the weather being rainy and cold, so I packed accordingly. But, except for Glacier Bay Day, every day was sunny, rain-free, 60-70°. Swoon!

Food was good.  Loved Teppanyaki, La Cucina, Cagney's.  Apps (deviled eggs, brisket sliders) were yummy at Q Texas Smokehouse but mains were meh; the band was fantastic though! We did not eat in any of the MDR's, we used the buffet sparingly and we loved The Local and American Diner. I feel like people complain about food so much but really, it was good. Fine. And in the specialty restaurants it was actually really yummy!

Shows: Bring Back The 90's and Wild Cards. Same cast in both shows. 90's show was so endearing and Wild Cards was very high energy. Both are jukebox shows featuring pop music. 90's show was our favorite and so nostalgic. 

This matters a lot to me: the internet access was fantastic! I purchased the unlimited streaming package and found it seamless and fast! No difficulty texting or calling or browsing or streaming. Really impressed. 

Every crew member we encountered was kind, friendly, endearing. We were delighted eith our favorite bartenders especially, and our cabin steward was terrific; we met him when we embarked and he brought us a mattress topper and blankets for the balcony! 

We saw the Northern Lights at about 1:35 am local time leaving Juneau. One of those bucket list moments. Sigh..

Truly an excellent cruise.  The Joy is a wonderful ship and Alaska is simply magical. Happy to answer any questions anyone might have!

 ETA: You Guys, you simply have to use the **totally free** Port Valet if cruising from Seattle. It is like magic. No dragging of luggage, walk right off the ship hands-free. I wish so much for everyone to do this. Finally, Seattle STS Town Car was excellent from airport to hotel and from cruiseport to airport. Please consider a car service for your transfers because it just makes travel less stressful. ",4,1758501922.0,NCL,2,1.0,False

[Opens to Vaggie sleeping in bed. she squirms before waking up, yawning and rubbing her eyes. She turns to the left side. Camera zooms out to reveal Charlie gone.]

Vaggie: Charlie?

[It cuts to Charlie in the hotel lobby, panicking and planning out everything with lots of paper with strings attached with everyone else watching her, disturbed by her behavior. Vaggie comes down the stairs fully dressed.]

Charlie Morningstar: I'm just not quite understanding why it's not working. Okay, okay, think Charlie. Think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think. Okay if I do this, it's going to be- (gasp) I have trust falls every single morning. We can do- (gasp)

Angel Dust: Yikes.

Charlie Morningstar: C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, Charlie!.

Vaggie: Charlie?... Sweetie? You, uh, you good?

[Charlie looks back with sleep-deprived, insane look in her eyes that red veins were shown in the sclera.]

Charlie Morningstar: Nope, no! Not really! Haha! I've been up all night trying to figure out why the hotel isn't working. [Crushes paper with hand] We've done trust falls. We've tried sharing our feelings. We only have a couple months left before the angels come- [Turns into demonic form and laughs maniacally before turning back to normal] And at this rate...

Vaggie: Maybe it's time-

Charlie Morningstar: NO.

Vaggie: to ask-

[Charlie gets up close to Vaggie's face, holding her cheeks desperately.]

Charlie Morningstar: DON'T SAY IT.

Vaggie: your dad.

[Charlie groans, knowing what this means for her.]

Vaggie: Charlie, I know you don't want to, but we need every advantage we can get.

Charlie Morningstar: He let the extermination happen to begin with. They just had a meeting and said, ""Go ahead and kill everyone!""- (gasp) Wait. That's it!

Vaggie: Kill everyone?

Charlie Morningstar: No! He could get me a meeting with Heaven!

Vaggie: Didn't we already try that?

Charlie Morningstar: Well. yeah, with Adam, he was an asshole. But he isn't in charge of all of Heaven. We could go to the top! There's sure to be some angels who will listen.

[Charlie scrolls through her contacts. In her contacts, she has Egg Boiz 1,2, and 3, before her thumb lingers on top of her ""Dad"". However, she was hesitant to call her dad]

Husk: What's the holdup? You got daddy issues?

Charlie Morningstar: No, we just have never been close. After he and mom split, he never really wanted to see me. He calls... sometimes, but only if he's bored or like, needs me to do something.

[Husk was aware that this is just an excuse that Charlie does have issues with her dad and turns to the others.]

Husk: Daddy issues.

Angel Dust: Well I'd like to meet the big dick in charge.

[Niffty was holding a knife in her hands.]

Niffty: The ultimate bad boy. [laughs like a gremlin with excitement, holding a knife while Angel takes her knife away without her knowing] I bet he's scary.

[Scene cuts to Lucifer's house, showing framed photos of his family in a dark spooky room. Lucifer can be heard making snarling noise as he was working on something. As the scene goes, his room is revealed to be filled with a lot of rubber ducks, and stacks of them filled the boxes and tubs.]

Lucifer Morningstar: That's it... Almost there... Now presenting... the magic-tastical backflipping rubber duck! Ha ha! That spits fire! [rubber duck shoots flamethrower from its mouth] Hoo hoo hoo! Hold the applause! Please, okay. Oh, thank you, thank you. Oh God, who am I kidding, This sucks!

[He throws the rubber duck at his family portrait and looks sad. Suddenly his ringtone plays. he picks up his phone, and was shocked who was calling him.]

Lucifer Morningstar: Daughter? Daughter calling, daughter, daugther calling! OH! Uhm-uh. Hello, Charlie. H-Hey, heyyy, hey Char-Char. No! No. That's not good. Oh, this is the first time she's called you in years. This has to be perfect. [takes a deep breath before he picks up phone] Hey, bitch!

[Intercut conversation between Lucifer and Charlie during the phone call from the hotel to his house.]

Charlie Morningstar: Hi, Dad.

Lucifer Morningstar: Hey! How are you? Oh ho. Wh-Wh-where are you these days?

Charlie Morningstar: You know where I am Dad. I've told you before.

Lucife Morningstar r: You have? Oh, yeah uh, well, you know, I um uh-

Charlie Morningstar: I told you when you called me five months ago, or did you not listen?

Lucifer Morningstar: No, no, no, no. Just, you know, just forgot. I've just been really busy! Ya know, with, um… Important things. [kicks rubber duck]

Charlie Morningstar: Well, I'm actually running a hotel to rehabilitate sinners. Maybe you saw our commercial.

Lucifer Morningstar: Oh… sadly, I missed it. heh heh. You know I haven't been watching much TV lately. Scrambles the brain. [makes silly noises]. But, hey, A hotel! Fun!

Charlie Morningstar: (Sighs) Listen, Dad, I've got… kind of a big ask.

Lucifer Morningstar: [coughs and sets down his tea] Yeah, of course. Anything in my power is yours for the asking. You just name it~

Charlie Morningstar: I need to speak to Heaven. Well, whoever's in charge up there, above Adam, above anybody. I need to go to the top.

Lucifer Morningstar: Oh, no. No~ No, no, no, no, Charlie, no, no, no. That's, uh hah, no.

Charlie Morningstar: [angrily] Look Dad, [normal] I don't ask you for much, I never have, but this, this is really important to me. It's the most important thing I've ever done. And I... need you. I need your help.

Lucifer Morningstar: I don't know, Charlie.

Charlie Morningstar: Please, just come see what I'm trying to do. You'll see why it's a really good idea. And Heaven is bound to agree if I get the chance to talk to them. Please, Dad.

Lucifer Morningstar: Wait. You're... inviting me over? Absolutely! Hoh! I'll be there in an hour. [hangs up] ♪ My daughter wants to see me~! ♪ [points at the rubber duck below him] Take that depression!

[Back at the hotel, Charlie and Vaggie prepare for Lucifer's arrival.]

Charlie Morningstar: Welp, we have an hour until he gets here.

Vaggie: Okay people, [Everyone stands at attention, but Husk spills coffee over himself and Niffty collapses on the floor.] Lucifer is on his way. So we are going to get this place presentable and we are going to make an amazing impression. Vamanos!

[Everyone scatters to get the place tidy and ready for Lucifer. Sir Pentious and Niffty bakes cookies, then Niffty starts sweeping and Husk is cleaning up. Alastor walks in and watches Razzle and Dazzle put up a ""Wellcum Daddy"" banner up. Angel puts on some makeup before closing the mirror, revealing to be Niffty staring creepily at him, making Angel recoil back in surprise.]

Charlie Morningstar: [sighs] Okay everyone, it's showtime!

[Charlie opens the door, revealing to be Lucifer, excited to see his daughter.]

Lucifer Morningstar: Chaaaarlie!

Charlie Morningstar: Hey, Da-

[Charlie doesn't get to finish because Lucifer hugs her really tight like a bear. Unbeknownst to them, Alastor was right behind them, with his wicked smile strained and left eye twitching in anger when Alastor saw Lucifer.]

Lucifer Morningstar: [hugs Charlie] Oh, it's so good to see you. Haha!

Charlie Morningstar: *strained* It's uh, good to see you, too, Dad.

[Charlie pushes Lucifer off to give herself a breather.]

Charlie Morningstar: [clears throat] Welcome! to the Hazbin Hotel!

[Two Egg Boiz pops some party poppers as a warm welcome. KeeKee curls up to Lucifer and rubs her face against his legs. Lucifer notices her and goes all enchanted by her cuteness. He crouches down and rubs her head.]

Lucifer Morningstar: Oh, hewwo, KeeKee!

[Razzle and Dazzle flies by and Lucifer greets them,]

Lucifer Morningstar: Razzle, Dazzle. [makes endearing noises] Oh, look how much you haven't grown! Still fun sized. You taking care of my wittle girl? [speaks in a very deep ominous threatening tone] You better be… [snickers] Wow, this place sure looks, uh... Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh. It's got a lot of character.

[Lucifer finds the bar at the corner and was immediately repulsed by it.]

Lucifer Morningstar: OH! What in the unholy hell is that?!

[Alastor reappears from the fog and in front of Angel Dust.]

Alastor: Just some of the renovations we had done. Adds a bit of color, don't you think?

[Lucifer looked at him suspiciously, and points his stick at him.]

Lucifer Morningstar: And you are?

[Alastor reappears behind Lucifer, catching his attention.]

Alastor: Alastor! Pleasure to be meeting you, sir. Quite a pleasure! [Alastor shaking Lucifer's cane and wiping his hand in somewhat hidden disgust] It's nice to finally put a face to the name. [indicates the height by the camera]. You are much shorter in real life.

[Alastor making a hand gesture indicating the height difference between the Morningstars]

Lucifer Morningstar: Who is this? Who is this nut? Are you the bellhop?

Alastor: Haha! No! I am the host of the hotel. You might have heard of me from my radio broadcast.

Lucifer Morningstar: Hmm. Nope! I guess that's why Charlie called it the Has-been Hotel! Hahaha.

Alastor: Ha ha ha! It was actually my idea.

Lucifer Morningstar: Ha ha ha! Well, it's not very clever!

Alastor: [Strained] Ha ha! Fuck you.

[With each sentence, Alastor and Lucifer were getting closer to fighting before Charlie gets in the way to stop them in between.]

Charlie Morningstar: Okay! Okay, anyway. Dad, look at this lovely parlor where people can get to know each other and share secrets and stories and intimate feelings! Without Alastor, we wouldn't have been able to pretty it up this much.

Alastor: Charlie has a very unique vision. I am happy to fulfil her bizarre requests.

[Alastor places hand on her shoulder. Lucifer is grumpy that he is winning over Charlie more than he is, which makes him very angry to the point where he growls in frustration.]

Charlie Morningstar: Oh, thank you, Alastor.

Alastor: Quite an impressive young lady. (condescendingly) We're all very proud of her.

Lucifer Morningstar: [clears throat] Charlie, dear, why don't you introduce me to your OTHER friends?

[Lucifer walks right between them before pointing his stick to the others at the table. Angel Dust tries to get a cookie from Sir Pentious, but he doesn't want Angel touching the cookies without Lucifer trying them and hides them underneath him.]

Charlie Morningstar: Oh, yes, of course. This is Vaggie. She's my girlfriend!

Lucifer Morningstar: Oh ho my golly! You like girls? So do I! We have so much in common! You put er' there, Maggie! Hey! [hugs her while laughing] She's so pretty.

Vaggie: Uh, lovely to meet you, uh, sir!

Charlie Morningstar: And this is Sir Pentious and Angel Dust, our guests!

[Sir Pentious hears his name being called and stands at attention, making a salute to him.]

Sir Pentious: Your Majesty!

[Sir Pentious falls down into the cookies right before Angel Dust takes one for himself.]

Angel Dust: Heya, short king~

Charlie Morningstar: Husk is our bartender, and Niffty is our housekeeper.

Husk: Nice to meet you.

[Niffty was super-excited to meet the ultimate bad boy that she scurries over and climbs up on his coat.]

Niffty: Hello. [laughs] I clean. Hehehehe.

[Suddenly the chandelier falls and produces a huge amount of dust which makes everyone cough. Lucifer and Alastor were at the chandelier when Lucifer knows Alastor did that on purpose.]

Lucifer Morningstar: [Laughs]. Alright, then.

[With one swing of his own stick, the fallen chandelier disappears and starts to sing the song, Hell's Greatest Dad to Charlie.]

Alastor: Mimzy!

Mimzy: Alastooorr, sweetie, doll-face! So good to see you. How you been? Good? Good.

[Mimzy and Alastor hug each other.]

Mimzy: Listen, I was in the neighborhood. I heard you were staying at this ritzy slob factory, and I figured I'd stop by, say hi! For old times sake.

Alastor: Of course, sweetheart! Everyone is welcome here!

Charlie Morningstar: Oh, how nice! So you two know each other?

Mimzy: Oh, yeah, we go way back, ran in the same circles when we were alive. You know, this one used to frequent the club where I used to perform. He's the only one I knew who could pound whiskey like a sailor then keep up with me on the dance floor.

Alastor: Oh, quite a talent, this gal. Ho ho, you should have seen her in her hayday!

Mimzy: Hey, watch it tall, dark and creepy. I'm still in my prime!

[Mimzy spots Lucifer in the open, and was immediately infatuated with the sight of the King of Hell.]

Lucifer Morningstar: Charmed, I'm sure.

Alastor: As much as I'd love to catch up, Charlie and I have a tour to continue.

[Lucifer heard this and takes his daughter by the arms before dragging her front.]

Lucifer Morningstar: I'm sure Charlie can handle showing me around.

[Alastor appears in front of them.]

Alastor: Nonsense! *grabs Charlie and drags her forward* We started the hotel together, and we'll show it off together. Right, Charlie?

[Alastor stops dragging Charlie so she can be the one to lead the tour for her father.]

Charlie Morningstar: Oh, right.

[As Charlie leads on with Vaggie and Lucifer following behind, Alastor turns to Mimzy.]

Alastor: Why don't you let the others help you settle in, and I'll be back before you know it.

[And with that, Alastor leaves to follow the tour. Mimzy turns to the bar and walks up to get a drink.]

Mimzy: So, where can a girl get a drink around here?

[Husk doesn't like Mimzy's company and groans in irritation as he cleans a glass. Mimzy takes a seat and notices him.]

Mimzy: My, my, is that Husker? Alastor still has you slinging hooch for him, I see. *chuckles* Classic! How ya been, fur ball?

Husk: Good! Until five minutes ago.

Mimzy: Oh, don't tell me you're not happy to see me. You might hurt my feelins. *giggles*

[While Husker gets a drink for Mimzy, she turns to Niffty who was looking for the bugs that were scattering on the floor.]

Mimzy: Hey Niffty, whatcha' been up to, girlie?

Niffty: Fighting bugs.

Mimzy: And uh, how's that going for ya?

[Niffty turns to one of the bug she sees.]

Niffty: They're winning. *sadistically pulls out a large knife with a insane smile* But not for long.

Mimzy: Uh-huh... *a glass was given to her* Thanks, pussy cat!

Husk: Oh, fuck you.

[As Husk leaves the bar, Angel and Sir Pentious takes up a seat right next to her.]

Angel Dust: So uh, you and Alastor are like, what? Friends?

Mimzy: Well, that's your word, not mine, but I think it fits. Why so surprised?

Angel Dust: Well, just didn't know he had any of those. He's been here a while and is still a big, creepy mystery. What's his deal?

[Mimzy begins her tale by making a short flashback story of how Alastor came to be. A shadowy demon is seen holding a drink, which Alastor Takes out of his hand, in the next scene, Demons are seen dismissing him as another sinner, but then, in a dark alley, an unnamed Overlord is cornered by a sinister-looking Alastor, before it cuts to a female overlord, presumably Alastor's next victim. One by one, more overlord Demons disappeared, leaving only Alastor to reign supreme over all the others. Then, a radio tower sends neon green signal waves all over hell.]

Mimzy: Well, you probably heard the stories. He appeared in Hell suddenly, making a splash quicker than anyone had ever seen. At first, people wanted to dismiss him. But soon, overlords started goin' missing, and not small ones neither. We're talking heavy hitters. No one knew what happened to 'em until these strange radio broadcasts started going out. All you could hear were screams. Every time an overlord went missing, there'd be a new voice screaming in the broadcast! That's when Alastor revealed himself as the Radio Demon, and anyone that would mess with him... *laughs* Well, let's just say, his broadcasts never lacked new voices.

[The flashback story ends to the present where Mimzy was concluding her tale of Alastor before getting back to being nonchalant about him.]

Mimzy: That's the story most people know, but underneath it all... he's a total sweetie. Put on some jazz and pour a couple fingers of rye and he becomes a kitten!

[As Mimzy concludes her story, Angel and Sir Pentious were spooked by Alastor's dark history in hell while Mimzy doesn't seemed bothered by their disturbance.]

Mimzy: Stop with the looks. He hasn't done any of that in a while. *raises a glass* Can I get another one of these?

[Mimzy realized that Husk is nowhere in the bar or in the lobby, much to her annoyance..]

Mimzy: Oh, what the fuck!

[In the creepy dark hallways, Charlie was showing her father about the interiors of the hotel.]

Charlie Morningstar: So, once we have the proof that redemption is possible, this whole hotel will be full of demons wanting to check out into Heaven! We just need a little time to prove it. The sharing circles haven't been working as fast as I hoped-

[While Charlie was in the middle of explaining everything to her father, Husk calls his owner from out of nowhere.]

Husk: Ey, Boss? Can I have a word...?

[Alastor stops and twists his head 180 degrees to have his face turn to him before his body rotates.]

Alastor: What is it?

Husk: You and I both know Mimzy only shows up when she needs somethin'. That bitch is trouble, and who knows what kind of demon she fucked with to come running to you this time?

Alastor: it's nothing I can't handle. Don't worry, Husker. Who in their right mind would cross me?

Husk: I mean… you've been gone a while, and it's not like anybody knows why.

Alastor: They don't need to know, and don't you worry your fuzzy head about it.

{Alastor rubs Husk's ears which angers him.]

Husk: *growls* You may own my soul, but I ain't your fucking pet!

Alastor: *chuckles* But you are! Haha!

[Alastor turns around to join back with the tour.]

Husk: *whispering* Big talk for someone who's also on a leash.

[Alastor immediately halts after hearing this, his eyes turned into radio dials. The lights in the hallway flickered from his anger rising. Slowly, Alastor looks over his shoulder to Husk.]

Alastor: Aha, what did you say?

[Before Husk could even respond, a green chain pulls his neck before he's forced down. He realizes what he's done and tries to come up with an excuse.]

Husk: Oh, fuck! Nothing! I, um...

[Alastor slowly approaches him with the green chain twirling from his mic-stick. The more he steps closer, the lights flickers on and off from his anger.]

Alastor: If you ever say that again, I will tear your soul apart and broadcast your screams for every other disrespectful wretch who dares to question me.

[Alastor's threat makes Husk shiver in fear when he realizes he had crossed too far with him.]

Husk: *scared* Understood.

[The lights turn back to normal, and Alastor is back to his old jolly good self.]

Alastor: Lovely. *chuckles* Good talk, my good man! Always nice to catch up.

[Alastor leaves the shaking Husk on the floor. Husk was too scared to even move, and was left shivering in fear.]

[Back to the tour, Vaggie was taking her turn explaining more about the hotel's role to redeeming demons so they can go to Heaven, most notably Angel Dust.]

Vaggie: And we've almost been able to find all of Angel Dust's drug stashes... Almost.

Charlie Morningstar: So, once that's out of the way it should be much smoother sailing.

Lucifer Morningstar: Well, that certainly is, uh... is-is something.

Charlie Morningstar: So… what do you think?

Lucifer Morningstar: About what?

Charlie Morningstar: The hotel.

Lucifer Morningstar: Oh yes, it does… it does look much better now, doesn't it? *chuckles* Ya know, but I'm thinking this railing needs work, one good push and you'd just go right over the edge! Whoopie, bye bye! *chuckles*

Charlie Morningstar: What? No, no, the plan, Dad! What do you think about using the hotel to help sinners?

[Now matter how much Lucifer hates to admit it, he wants Charlie to get one thing straight about what her plans are going.]

Lucifer Morningstar: *exhales* Alright, I mean, look… I love that you want to see the best in people, but these sinners… You know, they're just the worst. I, I don't know how much you can realistically expect from them in Heaven. *Adjusts his collar* Hohooo boy, Heaven is not exactly as carefree as you might think. Yeah, they have rules. Lots of rules, and they aren't very open minded as you'd hope.

Charlie Morningstar: These are our people, Dad! I... I have to try.

Lucifer Morningstar: Our ""people"", Charlie, are awful! They got gifted free will and look what they did with it! Everything's terrible! *wheeze* I just don't want you to put yourself on the line for people like-—

[Lucifer was interrupted when a loud thud shakes the hotel, rocking the three of them on the balcony.]

Vaggie: Geez! What now?!

Lucifer Morningstar: Well, like that.

[To prove his point, Lucifer gesture to dozens of loan shark demon mafia on the ground. The loan shark mafia were armed to the teeth with guns, melee weapons, and a battering ram as they try to ram the front door open. The leader of the loan shark mafia looks up at the balcony.]

Loan shark: Mimzy! We know you're in there you lousy bitch!

[Inside, the lobby, Mimzy realizes that the loan shark mafia found her and cartoonishly goes down in a sheepish wince, now already busted.]

Mimzy: Oh, shit.

[A portal opens up by Lucifer and all three of them return to the lobby as the loan shark mafia continues to ram the front door.]

Vaggie: Que carajo?! (What the fuck?!)

Charlie Morningstar: What's going on?

Mimzy: I maaaaaaay be in trouble with some loan sharks I may or may not have borrowed fifty grand from—*loud thud* Eep!

[Scared, Mimzy cowers behind the bar counter to hide before peeking up to Charlie and Vaggie.]

Loan Shark: You better come out!

Mimzy: And I may have also stolen a car... and crashed it... into the loan shark's girlfriend. But that bitch had it coming!

[Before Charlie and Vaggie could even respond, the windows and the walls were barraged with fireballs from the outside. The windows crashed and the floors are hammered with fireballs. Charlie and Vaggie screamed as more fireballs came raining on them. Niffty was horrified that the windows were destroyed after cleaning it so long ago. Angel Dust scoots back to his seat after a fireball nearly hits him.]

Niffty: My windows!

[Sir Pentious realized what was happening while holding his baked cookies.]

Sir Pentious: Ah! We're under siege! *dodges a fireball* Ah! Take cover!

[Everyone in the hotel scrambles in panic and defense as more fireballs fall down on them. Charlie dodges one of the fireballs close to her. Niffty was nearly crushed by one fireball before Angel picks her up, shocked.]

Vaggie: Look out!

Angel Dust: What the fuck?!

[Angel throws Niffty out of the way, but she scurries around all over the lobby while Lucifer remains composed, oblivious to their dire situation. The lobby was on fire from the fireballs. Husk tries to put out the fire close to his bar, stomping on it in anger while Mimzy hides behind the counter. Angel runs for cover, and Sir Pentious can be heard screaming as fireballs meteor through the windows. While everyone finds some cover, Lucifer gives Charlie a lecture that makes her angry enough to where her eye twitches.]

Lucifer Morningstar: Ya see, thus is exaaactly what I'm talking about, Charlie. You build something nice, you invite people in and offer them everything and they just bring violence and chaos to your doorstep. It doesn't matter how well intentioned you are, they're always going to disappoint you.

[Niffty was on the floor recovering the windows that were shattered, unaware that falling debris was about to crush her.]

Sir Pentious: Niffty, come along!

[Sir Pentious grabs Niffty before debris nearly crush her. Vaggie appears with her spear ready at arms.]

Vaggie: All of you, get a safe distance. I'll take care of this.

[Before Vaggie could go out to deal with the mafia, Alastor appears out of nowhere and places a hand on Vaggie's spear to lower it.]

Alastor: No, my dear, leave it to me. It's time I remind everyone why I am here.

[Upon saying those sentence, Alastor turns demonic with his eyes turning to a radio dial. Mimzy pops up from the counter.]

Mimzy: Oh, finally! Took ya long enough!

[Alastor goes into his demonic form as a green aura lights up from the outside. The mafia outside were just about to reload their catapult when they notice the eerie greenish glow before Alastor turns to his sinister demon form.]

Alastor: A reminder to all, not to mess with the Radio Demon! *evil laugh*

[With Alastor now in his demon form, he expands his tentacle tendrils outside where one smashes the catapult, the other killing several mafia gangsters. The remaining gangsters panic at the sight of the radio demon's magic.]

Mimzy: Yeah!

[Alastor's body grows larger and limbs become longer before exiting the front door with a sinister unmoving grin.]

Alastor: I will devour each and every one of you!

[Alastor heads out to massacre the mafia for attacking the hotel. As he exits the front door, Mimzy, Charlie, and Lucifer come out to watch the bloodbath. Charlie was totally appalled that Alastor is truly terrifying and maliciously monstrous. Lucifer nodded once to make his point. From the back point of view from the camera, Lucifer lectures Charlie about the sinners while Alastor devours and kills the mafia outside. Body parts spread all over the front door, while Lucifer was oblivious to the mess.]

Lucifer Morningstar: Mhm, ya see? What I tell ya? Charlie, sinners are violent psychopaths, hell bent on causing as much pain and destruction as they can. There's really no point in trying.

Charlie Morningstar: Dad, stop! He's defending this hotel! *turning to see Alastor eating a mafia loan shark* It may be a bit more sadistic than I'd hoped, but he's doing it for me! How come he can have faith in me but my own father can't?

[Nearby, behind the turned table, Angel, Sir Pentious, and Husk saw the melodrama that was occurring between Lucifer and Charlie.]

Angel Dust: Ooh, drama.

[Excited, Angel gets out a bucket of popcorn to watch the scene unfold. Husk also picks up a handful of popcorn to eat.]

[Outside, Alastor has finished massacring the mafia as he shrinks back down to his usual self, now satisfied that he's killed a lot of demons today.]

Alastor: Oh, I missed getting to let off steam!

[Mimzy checks outside if the coast was clear before approaching to Alastor.]

Mimzy: Oh, Alastor! What a fantastic show! Bravo! As always. Thanks for helpin' lil' old me out of a tough spot, you're always such a pal!

[A railroad debris falls close to Mimzy, making her back away in surprise.]

Mimzy: Oops. Heheheh... sorry about the mess, but I'm sure the lil' bug can take care of it for ya.

Alastor: I think you should go, Mimzy. Now.

Mimzy: Oh pff, Alastor, you're such a kidder, you! Haha, you are so funny!

Alastor: I mean it. You deliberately brought danger to this place just to have me clean up your mess. I can't have that here.

Mimzy: But you love takin' care a' me! What? You don't actually give a shit about this tacky place, do ya? Come on. I know you.

[Mimzy pokes his chest with every word in the sentence.]

Mimzy: You *pokes his chest* heartless *pokes* son- *pokes* of- *pokes* a- *pokes* bitch~

[Alastor casually moves her finger away. He moves around Mimzy before standing in front of her with his microphone stick placed in front.]

Alastor: You are welcome if you actually want to give redemption a shot, but I think we both know that's not really your style, so you need to leave.

Mimzy: Well, fine! Who needs ya? Have fun with ya little princess and ya little hotel. See if I care.

[Insulted and offended, Mimzy turns around and flips Alastor off before walking away.]

[Husk was rather amused before turning back to the melodrama between Charlie and Lucifer, now with a bucket of popcorn of his own. Angel has his, but he also has a drink to go along with it. Sir Pentious was holding a TV guide by Vox.]

Angel Dust: This is really getting good.

[In a heartfelt scene, Lucifer retreats to the lobby while Charlie follows him behind.]

Charlie Morningstar: Dad… just... help me.

Lucifer Morningstar: I... I can't.

Charlie Morningstar: Why can't you?

Lucifer Morningstar: Charlie! You don't understand. Heaven never listens. They didn't listen to me. They won't listen to you.

Charlie Morningstar: You don't know that!

Lucifer Morningstar: I do!

[With tears filling his eyes, Lucifer begins to express his feelings through a song, More Than Anything.]

Lucifer Morningstar: ♪ You didn't know that when ♪

♪ I tried this all before, my dreams were too hard to defend. ♪

♪ And in the end, ♪

♪ I won't lose it all again. Now you're the only thing worth fighting for. ♪

[While he is singing, silhouettes of higher angels appear, surrounding Lucifer with spears. Next shot shows Charlie being surrounded by spears that slowly come towards her, with Lucifer noticing them in horror, and pulls Charlie away on the other side to defend her.] ♪ More than anything, more than anything. ♪

♪ I'll shelter and adore you more than anything ♪

Charlie Morningstar: *spoken* Dad, I don't need you to protect me from this.

Lucifer Morningstar: I just don't want you to be crushed by them like- Like I was.

Charlie Morningstar: Dad... ♪ When I was young, I didn't really know you at all. ♪

[In a flashback scene, a young Charlie saw her father by his workshop who looked all sad and moopy. He notices her and takes her into his lap to show her some magic. A silhouette of Lilith appears before taking Charlie away. Charlie looks at her father sadly while Lucifer gazes at her with sadness too.]

♪ I always felt so small. ♪

♪ But I heard your stories and I was enthralled. ♪

♪ The tales about your lofty dreams, I listened breathlessly. ♪

♪ Imagining it could be me. ♪

♪ So in the end, it's the view I had of you, that showed me dreams can be worth fighting for ♪

[Flashback ends to the present.]

Lucifer Morningstar: ♪ I've been dyin' to find out who you are. ♪

Charlie Morningstar: ♪ I've been waiting, wanting the same thing. ♪

Charlie Morningstar Lucifer Morningstar: ♪ I'm grateful you're my (Charlie Morningstar: father) /(Lucifer Morningstar: daughter) more than anything. More than anything. ♪

[As the song ends, Lucifer and Charlie returns to the lobby after traveling across the dimension to a mystical place. Sir Pentious was teary after seeing the sweet tendered moment between Lucifer and Charlie.]

Sir Pentious: *spoken* Aww, that was ssssweet.

Lucifer Morningstar: Okay, I can get you the meeting, but once you're in Heaven, I won't be able to go with you. Will you be ok?

Charlie Morningstar: I'll be fine.

Lucifer Morningstar: That's my girl. *sighs* Good luck kiddo.

[And with that, Lucifer turns into a violet red mist before disappearing away from the lobby. Vaggie comes over to talk to Charlie with uncertainty.]

Vaggie: This next part is going to be scary. You ready?

Charlie Morningstar: I'm ready, *hugs Vaggie* cause you'll be with me.

[Vaggie looks reluctant, hoping she does not mean 'physically being in heaven']

Vaggie: In spirit, right?

Charlie Morningstar: In Heaven.

Vaggie: Yay!

[Vaggie's face winced at the thought of going to Heaven as the episode ends.]",3,1758501876.0,hazbin,2,1.0,False
1nn8l3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_jadegreen88/comments/1nn8l3m/the_houseboat/,The Houseboat,"It's been about a month now that Kenny's been gone. Three weeks and five days to be exact. He left in his pirogue one night just after sunset to go frogging and never came back. Man just up and disappeared like a fart in the wind. Now, it's just me out here on this old houseboat, alone. 

The law found the pirogue a week later, hung up on a cypress knee. No oar, no frogs, no Kenny. Just a dozen crushed-up Budweiser cans and half a pack of Marlboro Reds. Only thing is, Kenny didn't smoke. 

They had it towed back in, and I haven't seen the damn thing since. Kept it for '*evidence*', Sheriff Landry said. So, now I'm stuck out here. Unless I wanna trudge through fifty miles or so of isolated swampland—and Kenny left with the one good pair of rubber boots we had.

Search only went on for a couple more days after that. To no avail, of course. After that much time in the bog, you don't expect to find a body. At least not intact. They called it off on the first of October. My husband, Kenny Thibodeaux, presumed dead, but still officially considered a missing person. 

Some said the gators musta got him. Some thought he ran off with another woman. Some had, what I'll just call, other theories. But no one in the Atchafalaya Basin thought it was an accident. 

Hell, I ain't stupid. I know exactly what they all whisper about me. It's all the same damn shit they been saying since I was a youngin'. 

*Jezebel. Putain. Swamp Witch.*

Ha, let 'em keep talking. Don't bother me none. Not anymore. You gotta have real thick skin out in the bayou or you'll get tore up from the floor up. Me? I can hold my own. But no one comes around here anymore. Not since Kenny's been gone.

Up until a few nights ago, that is. 

I was in the galley, de-heading a batch of shrimp to fry up, when I heard it.  

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I froze with the knife in my hand. Wudn't expecting visitors; phone never rang. Maybe Landry was poking around with more questions again. I set the knife down onto the counter next to the bowl, then crept over to the front window to peek out. 

As I squinted through the dense blackness of the night, I saw something. Out on the deck, was the faint outline of a large figure standing at the edge. But it wudn't the sheriff. 

My heart dropped. I stumbled backward from the window in a panic and ran for the knife on the counter. My fingers wrapped around the handle and,

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

The sound pulsed through the floorboards beneath my feet. Sharp, like the edge of a knuckle hitting a hollow door. I lifted the knife, shrimp guts still dripping from the edge of the blade. Then, I took a deep breath and flipped the deck light on.

Nothin'. 

I paused for a moment, scanning what little area was illuminated by the dim, flickering yellow light. No boats. No critters. No large dark figures. Just a cacophony of cicadas screaming into the void, and the glimmering eyes of all the frogs Kenny never caught. 

I shut the light back off and threw the curtains closed.

""*Mais la.*""

My mind was playing tricks on me. At least that's what I thought at the time—must've just been a log bumping into the pontoons. I shrugged it off and went back to the shrimp. De-veined, cleaned, and battered. I chucked the shrimp heads out the galley window for the catfish, then sat down and had myself a good supper.

Once I'd picked up the mess and saved the dishes, I went off to get washed up before bed. After I'd settled in under the covers, I started thinking about Kenny. 

He wudn't a bad man. Not really. Sure, he was a rough-around-the-edges couyon with a mean streak like a water moccasin when he got to drinking. But he meant well. I turned over and stared at the empty side of the bed, listening to the toads sing me to sleep.

The light of the next morning cut through the cabin window like a filet knife through a sac-à-lait. I dragged myself up and threw on a pot of coffee. French roast. I had a feeling I'd need the kick in the ass that day. 

I sat on the front deck, sipping and gazing out into the morning mist, when I heard the unmistakable sound of an outboard approaching. I leaned forward. It was Sheriff Landry. He pulled his boat up along starboard and shut the engine off. 

""Hey Cherie, how you holding up?""

""I'm doin' alright. How's your mom and them?"" 

""Oh, just fine,"" he chuckled. ""Mind if I get down for a second? Just got a couple more questions for ya.""

""Allons,"" I said, gesturing for him to come aboard. ""Let me get you a cup of coffee.""

""No, no, that's okay. Already had my fill this morning."" 

I nodded. He stepped onto the deck with his hands resting on his belt and shuffled toward me, his boots click-clacking against the brittle wood. 

""Now, I'm not one to pry into the personal affairs between a husband and his wife, but since this is still an ongoing investigation, I gotta ask. How was your relationship with Kenny?""

I took a long sip, then set the mug down. 

""Suppose it was like any other, I guess."" 

""Did you two ever fight?""

""Sometimes,"" I shrugged. 

He paused for a beat, then spat out his wad of dip into the water. 

""Were y'all fighting the night he came up missing?""

""Not that I recall.""

""Not that you recall. Hmm. Well, I know one thing,"" he said, turning to look out into the water. ""There's something fishy about all this. Man didn't just disappear—somethin' musta happened to him.""

I took a deep breath. 

""Sheriff... I wanna know where he's at just as much as y'all do.""

""That so?""

He smiled, and I folded my arms in front of me. 

""Funny thing is, Mrs. Thibodeaux, you ain't cried once since Kenny's been  gone."" 

A cool breeze kicked up just then, sending the knotted-up seashells and bones I used as a wind chime clanging together. He looked over at it with a hairy eyeball. 

""With all due respect, Landry, I do my cryin' alone. Now, can I get back to my coffee? Got a lot to do today. Always somethin' needs fixin' on this old houseboat."" 

He tipped his hat and shot another stream of orange spit over the side of the deck, then got back in his boat and took off.

Day flew by after that. Between baiting and throwing out the trotlines, setting up crab traps, and replacing a rotten deck board, I already had my hands full. But then, when I went to scrape the algae off the sides of the pontoons, I found a damn leak that needed patching. 

There was a small hole in the one sitting right under the galley. Looked like somethin' sharp had poked through it—too sharp to be a log.  Maybe a snapping turtle got ahold of it, I thought. Ain't never seen one bite clean through metal before, though. 

Before I knew it, the sun was goin' down, and it was time to start seein' about fixin' supper. No crabs, but when I checked my lines, I'd snagged me a catfish. After I dumped a can of tomatoes into the cast iron, I put a pot of rice cooking to go with my coubion. I was in the middle of filleting the catfish when I heard it again. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I jerked forward, slicing a deep gash into my thumb in the process.

""*Merde!* Goddammit to hell!"" 

It was damn near down to the bone. I grabbed a dish rag and pressed it tight against my gushing wound, holding my hands over the sink. The blood seeped right through. Drops of red slammed down against the white porcelain with urgency, splattering as they landed. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I winced and raised my head to look out the galley window. Nothing but frog eyes shining through the night. 

""What in the fuck is that noise?!"" I shouted angrily to an empty room. 

Just crickets. The frogs didn't have shit to say that time. 

I checked the front deck, of course, but wudn't nobody out there. Then, I hurried over to the head to get the first aid kit, bleeding like a pig and cussin' up a storm the whole way. Once I'd cleaned and bandaged up my cut, I went back into the galley, determined to finish cooking. 

I threw the catfish guts out the galley window, ate my fill, then went to bed. Didn't hear it again that night. Ain't nothing I could do about it right then anyway—Kenny left with the good flashlight. I was just gonna have to investigate that damn noise in the daytime. Had to be *somethin’* down there in the water tapping at the hull...

The next morning, I woke up to my thumb throbbin'. When I changed the bandage, let me tell ya, it was nasty—redder than a boiled crawfish and oozing yellowish-green pus from the chunk of meat I'd cut outta myself. The catfish slime had gotten into my blood and lit up my whole hand like it was on fire. 

*Damn... musta not cleaned it good enough.*

I scrubbed the whole hand with Dawn, doused the gash with more rubbing alcohol, then wrapped it back up with gauze and tape. Didn't have much more time to tend to it than that; I had shit to do.

First order of business (after my coffee, of course) was checking the traps and lines. The air smelled like a storm coming. Deep freezer was getting low on stock, and I was running outta time. A cold spell was rippin' through the bayou, and winter was right on its ass. 

I blared some ZZ Top while I started hauling in. One by one, I brought up an empty trap, still set with bait. It seemed only the tiny nibblers of the basin had been interested in the rotten chicken legs. Until I pulled up the last trap—the one set closest to the galley window. 

Damn thing was mangled. I'm talkin' beat the hell up. Something had tore clean through the metal caging, ripping it open and snatchin' the bait from inside. I slammed the ruined trap onto the deck in frustration. 

""Damn gators! Motherfucker!""

I stared down at the tangled mess of rusty metal. Maybe that's what's been knocking around down there, I thought.  Just a canaille, overgrown reptile fucking up my traps and thievin' my bait. 

Still, something was gnawin’ at me. The  taps—they seemed too measured. Too methodical. And always in sets of three. Gators, well... they can't count, far as I'm aware. 

Had a little more luck on the trotlines. Not by much, though. Got a couple fiddlers, another good-sized blue cat, and a big stupid gar that got itself tangled up and made a mess of half the line. Had to cut him loose and lost 'bout fifty feet. The bastard thrashed so hard he just about broke my wrist, teeth gnashin' and snappin' like a goddamn bear trap. 

Of course my thumb was screaming after that, but I didn't have time to stop. I threw the catch in the ice chest and re-baited the rest of the line I had left. After that, it was time to figure out once and for all just what the hell was making that racket under the hull.

I went around to the back to start looking there. Nothing loose, nothing out of place. I leaned forward to look over the side.

Then, I heard a loud splash.

I snapped back upright. The sound had come from around the other side of the houseboat. I ran back through the cabin out onto the front deck. 

""Aw, for Christ's sake.""

Ice chest lid was wide open—water splattered all over the deck. I approached slowly and looked inside. Fiddlers were still flapping at the bottom. But that big blue cat? Gone. Damn thing musta flopped itself out and back into the water. Lucky son of a bitch.

No use in cryin' about it, though. I was just going to have to make do with what I had left. I closed the lid back and shoved the ice chest further from the edge with my foot. When I did, I noticed something. 

On the side that was closest to the water, there was something smeared across it. I blinked. It was a muddy handprint. A big one. Too big to have been mine. 

""Mais... *garde des don*.""

I bent down to look closer. It wasn't an old, dried-up print—it was fresh. Wet. Slimy. Still dripping. My heart dropped. I slowly stood back up and looked out into the water. First the tapping, now this? Pas bon. Somethin', or somebody, was messing with me. And they done picked the wrong one. 

I went inside and grabbed the salt. Then, I stomped back out and started at one end, pourin' until I had a thick line of it all across the border of the deck.  

""Now. Cross *that*, motherfucker.""

I folded my arms across my chest. Bayou was still. Air was silent and heavy. The sun began to shift, peaking just above the tree line and painting the water with an orange glow.

For about another hour, I searched that houseboat left, right, up, and down. Never found nothin' that would explain the tapping, though. I dragged the ice chest inside to start cleaning the fish just as the nighttime critters started up their song.

Figured I could get the most use out of the fiddlers by fryin' 'em up with some étouffée, so I started boiling my grease while I battered the strips of fish. My thumb was pulsing like a heartbeat by then, and the gauze was an ugly reddish brown. Wudn't lookin' forward to unwrapping it later.  

That's when I realized—I hadn't heard the taps yet. Maybe the salt had fixed it. Maybe it had been a bayou spirit, coming to taunt me. Some tai-tai looking to make trouble. Shit, maybe it was Kooshma. Or the rougarou. Swamp ain't got no shortage of boogeymen.

I tried to shrug it off and finish fixin' supper, but the anticipation of hearing those taps kept me tense like a mooring line during a hurricane—ready to snap at any moment. The absence of them was almost just as unsettling. By the time the food was ready, I could barely eat.

That night, I laid there in the darkness and waited for them. Breath held, mind racing, heart thumping. 

They never came.

Sleep didn't find me easy. I was up half the damn night tossin' and turnin'. Trying to listen. Trying to forget about it. The thoughts were eatin' me alive, and my body was struck with fever. Sweat seeped out from every pore, soaking my hair and burning my eyes. And my thumb hurt so bad I was 'bout ready to get up and cut the damn thing off. 

I rested my eyes for what felt like only a second before that orange beam cut through. My body was stiff. Felt like a damn corpse rising up. I looked down at my hand and realized I'd forgotten to change the bandage the night before.

""Fuck!"" 

The whole hand was swollen and starting to turn purple near the thumb. I hobbled over to the head, trembling. As soon as I unwrapped the gauze, the smell of rot hit the air instantly. The edges of my wound had turned black, and green ooze cracked through the thick crust of yellow every time I moved it. I was gonna need something stronger than alcohol. But I couldn't afford no doctor.

I went over to the closet, grabbed the hurricane lamp, and carried it back to the head with me. Carefully, I unscrewed the top, bit down on a rag, then poured the kerosene over my hand, dousing the wound. It fizzed up like Coke on a battery when it hit the scab. As it mixed with the pus and blood, it let out a hiss—the infection being drawn out. 

My whole body locked up as the pain ripped through me. Felt like a thousand fire ants chewin' on me at once. I bit down on that rag so hard I tore a hole through it. Between the fumes and the agony, I nearly passed out. But, it had to be done. Left the kerosene on there 'till it stopped burning, then rinsed off the slurry of brown foam that had collected on my thumb. 

With the hard part over with, I smeared a glob of pine resin over the cut, then wrapped it back up real tight with fresh gauze and tape. That outta do it, I thought. 

At least the taps seemed to be gone for now, and I could focus on handling my business. Goes without sayin', didn't need the coffee that morning, so I got myself dressed and headed out front to start my day. 

I took a deep breath, pulling the thick swamp air into my lungs. It didn't settle right. I scrunched my eyebrows. There was a smell to it—an odor that didn't belong. Something *unnatural*. Couldn't quite put my finger on what exactly it was, but I knew it wudn't right. That's for damn sure. 

Salt line was left untouched, though. Least my barrier was working. I bent down to pull in the trotline, and just before I got my hands on it, a bubble popped up from the water, just under where I was standing. A huge one. And then another, and another.

Each bubble was bigger than the last, like something breathin' down there. As they popped, a stench crept up into the air, hittin' me in the face like a sack of potatoes. That smell...

""Poo-yai. *La crotte!*"" 

It was worse than a month's old dead crawfish pulled out the mud. So thick, I could taste it crawlin’ down my throat. I backed away from the edge of the deck, covering my face with my good hand. Then, the damn phone rang, shattering the silence and makin' me just about shit.

The bubbles stopped. 

I stared at the water for a second. Smell still lingered—the pungent musk of rot mixed with filth. After the fourth ring, I rushed inside to shut the phone up. 

""Hello?"" I breathed, more as an exasperated statement rather than a greeting.

""Cherie!"" an old, crackly-throated voice said. 

""Oh, hey there, Mrs. Maggie. How ya doin'?""

""I'm makin' it alright, child. Hey, listen—Kenny around?""

I sighed.

""No, Maggie. He's still missing.""

""Aw, shoot. Well... tell him I need some help with my mooring line when he gets back in. Damn things 'bout to come undone.""

""Okay, I'll let him know. You take care now, buh-bye.""

I hung up the phone, shaking my head. Mrs. Maggie Wellers was the old lady that lived up the river from me. Ever since ol' Mr. Wellers dropped dead of a heart attack last year, Maggie's been, as we call down here, *pas tout la*. Poor thing only had a handful of thoughts left rattling around in that head of hers—grief took the rest. The loss of her husband was just too much for her, bless her heart.

Her son, Michael, had been a past lover of mine. T-Mike, they called him. He and I saw each other for a while back in high school, till he up and disappeared,  too. After graduation, he took off down the road and ain't no one seen him since. Guess I got a habit of losin' men to the bayou. 

Me and Maggie stayed in touch over the years—couldn't help but feel an obligation. She was just trying to hold onto whatever piece of her boy she had left. Kenny even started helping her out with things around the houseboat once ol' Wellers kicked the bucket. Looked like now we'd both be fendin' for ourselves from here on out.

By the time I got back out to the trotlines, the stink had almost dissipated. My thumb was still tender, but the pine resin had sealed it and took the sting out. Enough playin' around—time to fill up the ice chest. 

I went to pull at the line, but it didn't budge. 

""What the fuck?""

Maybe it was snagged on a log. I yanked again, hard, and nothin'. Almost felt like the damn line was pulling back—maybe I'd hooked something too big to haul in. I planted my feet, wrapped the line around my hands twice, then ripped at it with all my might. 

Suddenly, the line gave way, and I went tumbling backward onto the deck.

I landed hard on my tailbone, sending a shockwave up my spine like a bolt of lightning. When I lifted my head up and looked over at the line, I slammed my fist onto the wood planks and cursed into the wind. My voice echoed through the basin, sending the egrets up in flight. 

Every single hook was empty. All my bait was gone—*taken*. The little bit of line I had left had snapped, leaving me only with about four feet's worth. Fuckin' useless.

The bayou was testing me at every turn. I almost didn't wanna get up. Thought I might just lie there, close my eyes, and let it take me. Couldn't do that, though. I still had shit to do. I took a deep breath, pulled myself back onto my feet, and flung the ruined line back into the water. 

I went out to the back deck, prayin' for crabs. Only had four traps left, and I'd be doing real good to catch two or three in each one. Water was a little warmer than it had been in the past week or two, so I had high hopes. Shoulda known better. 

Empty. Ripped apart and shredded all to hell. Every single goddamn one of them. Didn't even holler that time. I laughed. I threw my head back and cackled into the face of the swamp. 

The turtles shot into the water. The cicadas screamed. The bullfrogs began to bellow, the toads started to sing, and a symphony of a thousand crickets vibrated through the cypress trees.

Then, the bayou suddenly fell silent. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I 'bout jumped right outta my skin. And then, a fiery rage tore through my body like a jolt of electricity. I stomped back three times with the heel of my boot, slamming it down against the deck so hard it nearly cracked the brittle wood holding me up. 

""Oh, yeah? I can do it too, motherfucker! Now what?!"" 

I was infuriated. I stood there, breathing heavy, fists balled up—just waiting for it to answer me. A few seconds passed, then I heard it again. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

But it was further away this time, toward the back of the house. 

""Goddamn son of a bitch... IT’S ON THE MOVE!""

And then the thought dawned on me: maybe it wudn't comin' from underneath like I thought. Maybe it was comin' from inside the houseboat. 

I ran in like a wild woman and started tossin' shit around and tearin' up the whole place, looking for whatever the fuck was tapping at me. Damn nutria rat or a possum done crawled up and got itself stuck somewhere. Who knows. Didn't matter what kinda swamp critter it was. When I found it, I was gonna kill it. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I pulled everything out of the cabinets and the pantry. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I cleared out all the closets and under the bed.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I flipped the sofa and Kenny's recliner. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

Each time they rang out, it was coming from a different spot in the house. I was 'bout ready to get the hammer and start rippin' up the floorboards. But by that time, the sun was gonna be settin' soon. I'd wasted a whole 'nother day with this bullshit, and I was still no closer to finding the source of that incessant racket. Least my thumb wudn't bothering me no more. 

I gave up on my search for the night and went to the deep freezer. Only one pack of shrimp left and a bag of fish heads for bait. I pulled both out to start thawin’. With my trotline ruined and all my traps torn to pieces, I needed to go out and set up a few jug lines so I'd have something to eat the next day. Wudn't gonna be much, but a couple fiddlers was better than nothin'. 

About an hour had passed with no tapping, but I knew it wudn't really gone. My heart was pounding somethin' fierce and I couldn't take the silence no more. I turned on the radio and started blasting Creedence Clearwater Revival through the speakers while I gathered up some empty jugs and fashioned me some lines. I had to hurry, though—that orange glow was already creepin' in. 

Finished up just as the twilight was fading. Now I'd just have to bait the hooks, throw 'em out, and hope for the best. I picked the radio up and brought it back inside with me. Whether it was taps or silence, didn't matter. I was gonna need to drown it out. 

I decided to start supper first. By then, my stomach was growlin' at me like a hound dog. I put a pot of grits cookin', then went to the pantry to get a can of tomatoes to throw in there, too. Least I had plenty dry goods on hand. And Kenny's last bottle of Jack. 

I bobbed my head to some Skynyrd while I drank from the bottle and stirred the grits. I tried to ignore it, but I could feel those taps start vibratin' up from the floorboard through my feet while I was cleaning the shrimp. 

After I seasoned them, I put them to simmering in the sauce pan with the tomatoes and some minced garlic. Then, I turned the fire off the grits and covered the pot. I took a deep breath. Time to go handle up on my business. Hopefully supper would be ready by the time I was done.

I dumped the fish heads into a bucket and set it down by the front door while I turned on the deck light. Then, I went out front to set the jug lines. 

As soon as I stepped out onto the deck, something stopped me in my tracks. The salt line had been broke. A huge, muddy, wet smear draped across it, ‘bout halfway up to my door. My heart sunk. And then, I heard a noise. But it wudn't the taps. This time, it was... different.

A *hiss.*

I slowly turned. There was somethin' hanging onto the side of my boat, peering just over the edge from the water. 

I dropped the bucket of fish heads on the deck and the blood splattered across my bare legs. 

It was Kenny. 

Only... it wasn't. His eyes pierced through the night like two shiny, copper pennies. His skin was a dark, muddy green, completely covered in hundreds of tiny bumps and ridges. Long, yellowed nails extended from his short, thick fingers, curling to a sharp point at the ends. They dug deep into the wood, tiny splinters peeling around them as he clung to the side of the houseboat.

""No,"" I whispered. ""*Fils de putain...* it's you, Kenny.""

He recoiled in a violent snap, slithering into the black water with a loud splash. The wave rocked the houseboat, nearly tipping me over the edge. 

I ran back inside, slamming the door shut and locking it behind me. My chest heaved as I gasped for air. There was no mistaking it. He'd come back. My eyes shot across to the galley—I needed a weapon. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

""Fuckin' stop it, Kenny!!"" 

Right as I got my hand on the knife, the houseboat began to shift, like something tryin' to pull down one side, and the damn thing went flyin' out of my hand. I stumbled forward and grabbed onto the kitchen counter as the whole boat slowly started to tilt toward starboard. 

The cabinets flew open and my Tupperware scattered all across the floor. Food went slidin' off the stove, and the bottle of Jack hit the ground and shattered. The motherfucker was tryin' to sink me. I opened up the galley window and shrieked, 

""Get the hell off my boat, you goddamn couyon!!"" 

A hand shot up from the darkness, wrapping its slimy, thick fingers around the pane of my window. Those yellow claws sunk deep into the wood below, like a hot knife in butter. I swallowed hard. He wudn't tryin' to pull me down, he was tryin' to come inside.
 
The boat slammed back down as he shot up from the murky swamp and lunged through the window. I was thrown backward into the mess of hot grits and glass, knocking my head against the floor. In a split second, he was right on top of me. 

My husband, Kenny Thibodeaux, now a monster. A reptilian abomination. A grotesque mixture of man and beast—both, but neither. The swamp had taken him. 

He wrapped his massive, slimy fingers around my throat, poking his claws into my skin. Then, he leaned in closer. My heart flopped in my chest like a brim caught in a bucket. He was cold. He was angry. And he was *hungry.*

Slowly, the corners of his mouth pulled back into a smile, revealing a row of razor sharp teeth dripping with black sludge. *That smell.* His hot breath hit me like an oven as he opened his mouth to hiss,

""Hey, Cherie... Did ya miss me?""

His grip around my neck began to tighten. I could feel the blood starting to drain from my face. This was it—he was gonna kill me. 

I turned away. I didn't want his ravenous gaze to be the last thing I saw before I left this world. When I did, I noticed the knife sitting there on the floor... right next to me. 

I smiled, then turned back to look straight into the orange glow of his copper penny eyes. I slowly reached my arm out, wrapped my fingers around the handle, then choked out, 

""Yeah, Kenny. I was hopin' you'd come back soon.""





It's been about a month now that Kenny's been gone. Such a shame they never found him. Got a freezer full of meat now, though. Good enough to last all winter. 

'Bout time for Sheriff Landry to bring back my damn pirogue. Ain't no evidence left to find. Besides, I'm gonna have to make a trip into town soon—runnin' low on cigarettes. Might as well try to find me a new man down there, too, while I'm at it. Always somethin' on this old houseboat needs fixin'.

And, hell... would ya look at that? It's almost Halloween. Maybe I'll pick me up a witch hat and a new broom at the dollar store. That outta be festive. All in all, life ain't too bad out here in the swamp. 

But every once in a while, when the bayou is still and the frogs are quiet, I can still hear the faintest little

Something’s been tapping at the hull at night.,"It's been about a month now that Kenny's been gone. Three weeks and five days to be exact. He left in his pirogue one night just after sunset to go frogging and never came back. Man just up and disappeared like a fart in the wind. Now, it's just me out here on this old houseboat, alone. 

The law found the pirogue a week later, hung up on a cypress knee. No oar, no frogs, no Kenny. Just a dozen crushed-up Budweiser cans and half a pack of Marlboro Reds. Only thing is, Kenny didn't smoke. 

They had it towed back in, and I haven't seen the damn thing since. Kept it for '*evidence*', Sheriff Landry said. So, now I'm stuck out here. Unless I wanna trudge through fifty miles or so of isolated swampland—and Kenny left with the one good pair of rubber boots we had.

Search only went on for a couple more days after that. To no avail, of course. After that much time in the bog, you don't expect to find a body. At least not intact. They called it off on the first of October. My husband, Kenny Thibodeaux, presumed dead, but still officially considered a missing person. 

Some said the gators musta got him. Some thought he ran off with another woman. Some had, what I'll just call, other theories. But no one in the Atchafalaya Basin thought it was an accident. 

Hell, I ain't stupid. I know exactly what they all whisper about me. It's all the same damn shit they been saying since I was a youngin'. 

*Jezebel. Putain. Swamp Witch.*

Ha, let 'em keep talking. Don't bother me none. Not anymore. You gotta have real thick skin out in the bayou or you'll get tore up from the floor up. Me? I can hold my own. But no one comes around here anymore. Not since Kenny's been gone.

Up until a few nights ago, that is. 

I was in the galley, de-heading a batch of shrimp to fry up, when I heard it.  

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I froze with the knife in my hand. Wudn't expecting visitors; phone never rang. Maybe Landry was poking around with more questions again. I set the knife down onto the counter next to the bowl, then crept over to the front window to peek out. 

As I squinted through the dense blackness of the night, I saw something. Out on the deck, was the faint outline of a large figure standing at the edge. But it wudn't the sheriff. 

My heart dropped. I stumbled backward from the window in a panic and ran for the knife on the counter. My fingers wrapped around the handle and,

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

The sound pulsed through the floorboards beneath my feet. Sharp, like the edge of a knuckle hitting a hollow door. I lifted the knife, shrimp guts still dripping from the edge of the blade. Then, I took a deep breath and flipped the deck light on.

Nothin'. 

I paused for a moment, scanning what little area was illuminated by the dim, flickering yellow light. No boats. No critters. No large dark figures. Just a cacophony of cicadas screaming into the void, and the glimmering eyes of all the frogs Kenny never caught. 

I shut the light back off and threw the curtains closed.

""*Mais la.*""

My mind was playing tricks on me. At least that's what I thought at the time—must've just been a log bumping into the pontoons. I shrugged it off and went back to the shrimp. De-veined, cleaned, and battered. I chucked the shrimp heads out the galley window for the catfish, then sat down and had myself a good supper.

Once I'd picked up the mess and saved the dishes, I went off to get washed up before bed. After I'd settled in under the covers, I started thinking about Kenny. 

He wudn't a bad man. Not really. Sure, he was a rough-around-the-edges couyon with a mean streak like a water moccasin when he got to drinking. But he meant well. I turned over and stared at the empty side of the bed, listening to the toads sing me to sleep.

The light of the next morning cut through the cabin window like a filet knife through a sac-à-lait. I dragged myself up and threw on a pot of coffee. French roast. I had a feeling I'd need the kick in the ass that day. 

I sat on the front deck, sipping and gazing out into the morning mist, when I heard the unmistakable sound of an outboard approaching. I leaned forward. It was Sheriff Landry. He pulled his boat up along starboard and shut the engine off. 

""Hey Cherie, how you holding up?""

""I'm doin' alright. How's your mom and them?"" 

""Oh, just fine,"" he chuckled. ""Mind if I get down for a second? Just got a couple more questions for ya.""

""Allons,"" I said, gesturing for him to come aboard. ""Let me get you a cup of coffee.""

""No, no, that's okay. Already had my fill this morning."" 

I nodded. He stepped onto the deck with his hands resting on his belt and shuffled toward me, his boots click-clacking against the brittle wood. 

""Now, I'm not one to pry into the personal affairs between a husband and his wife, but since this is still an ongoing investigation, I gotta ask. How was your relationship with Kenny?""

I took a long sip, then set the mug down. 

""Suppose it was like any other, I guess."" 

""Did you two ever fight?""

""Sometimes,"" I shrugged. 

He paused for a beat, then spat out his wad of dip into the water. 

""Were y'all fighting the night he came up missing?""

""Not that I recall.""

""Not that you recall. Hmm. Well, I know one thing,"" he said, turning to look out into the water. ""There's something fishy about all this. Man didn't just disappear—somethin' musta happened to him.""

I took a deep breath. 

""Sheriff... I wanna know where he's at just as much as y'all do.""

""That so?""

He smiled, and I folded my arms in front of me. 

""Funny thing is, Mrs. Thibodeaux, you ain't cried once since Kenny's been  gone."" 

A cool breeze kicked up just then, sending the knotted-up seashells and bones I used as a wind chime clanging together. He looked over at it with a hairy eyeball. 

""With all due respect, Landry, I do my cryin' alone. Now, can I get back to my coffee? Got a lot to do today. Always somethin' needs fixin' on this old houseboat."" 

He tipped his hat and shot another stream of orange spit over the side of the deck, then got back in his boat and took off.

Day flew by after that. Between baiting and throwing out the trotlines, setting up crab traps, and replacing a rotten deck board, I already had my hands full. But then, when I went to scrape the algae off the sides of the pontoons, I found a damn leak that needed patching. 

There was a small hole in the one sitting right under the galley. Looked like somethin' sharp had poked through it—too sharp to be a log.  Maybe a snapping turtle got ahold of it, I thought. Ain't never seen one bite clean through metal before, though. 

Before I knew it, the sun was goin' down, and it was time to start seein' about fixin' supper. No crabs, but when I checked my lines, I'd snagged me a catfish. After I dumped a can of tomatoes into the cast iron, I put a pot of rice cooking to go with my coubion. I was in the middle of filleting the catfish when I heard it again. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I jerked forward, slicing a deep gash into my thumb in the process.

""*Merde!* Goddammit to hell!"" 

It was damn near down to the bone. I grabbed a dish rag and pressed it tight against my gushing wound, holding my hands over the sink. The blood seeped right through. Drops of red slammed down against the white porcelain with urgency, splattering as they landed. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I winced and raised my head to look out the galley window. Nothing but frog eyes shining through the night. 

""What in the fuck is that noise?!"" I shouted angrily to an empty room. 

Just crickets. The frogs didn't have shit to say that time. 

I checked the front deck, of course, but wudn't nobody out there. Then, I hurried over to the head to get the first aid kit, bleeding like a pig and cussin' up a storm the whole way. Once I'd cleaned and bandaged up my cut, I went back into the galley, determined to finish cooking. 

I threw the catfish guts out the galley window, ate my fill, then went to bed. Didn't hear it again that night. Ain't nothing I could do about it right then anyway—Kenny left with the good flashlight. I was just gonna have to investigate that damn noise in the daytime. Had to be *somethin’* down there in the water tapping at the hull...

The next morning, I woke up to my thumb throbbin'. When I changed the bandage, let me tell ya, it was nasty—redder than a boiled crawfish and oozing yellowish-green pus from the chunk of meat I'd cut outta myself. The catfish slime had gotten into my blood and lit up my whole hand like it was on fire. 

*Damn... musta not cleaned it good enough.*

I scrubbed the whole hand with Dawn, doused the gash with more rubbing alcohol, then wrapped it back up with gauze and tape. Didn't have much more time to tend to it than that; I had shit to do.

First order of business (after my coffee, of course) was checking the traps and lines. The air smelled like a storm coming. Deep freezer was getting low on stock, and I was running outta time. A cold spell was rippin' through the bayou, and winter was right on its ass. 

I blared some ZZ Top while I started hauling in. One by one, I brought up an empty trap, still set with bait. It seemed only the tiny nibblers of the basin had been interested in the rotten chicken legs. Until I pulled up the last trap—the one set closest to the galley window. 

Damn thing was mangled. I'm talkin' beat the hell up. Something had tore clean through the metal caging, ripping it open and snatchin' the bait from inside. I slammed the ruined trap onto the deck in frustration. 

""Damn gators! Motherfucker!""

I stared down at the tangled mess of rusty metal. Maybe that's what's been knocking around down there, I thought.  Just a canaille, overgrown reptile fucking up my traps and thievin' my bait. 

Still, something was gnawin’ at me. The  taps—they seemed too measured. Too methodical. And always in sets of three. Gators, well... they can't count, far as I'm aware. 

Had a little more luck on the trotlines. Not by much, though. Got a couple fiddlers, another good-sized blue cat, and a big stupid gar that got itself tangled up and made a mess of half the line. Had to cut him loose and lost 'bout fifty feet. The bastard thrashed so hard he just about broke my wrist, teeth gnashin' and snappin' like a goddamn bear trap. 

Of course my thumb was screaming after that, but I didn't have time to stop. I threw the catch in the ice chest and re-baited the rest of the line I had left. After that, it was time to figure out once and for all just what the hell was making that racket under the hull.

I went around to the back to start looking there. Nothing loose, nothing out of place. I leaned forward to look over the side.

Then, I heard a loud splash.

I snapped back upright. The sound had come from around the other side of the houseboat. I ran back through the cabin out onto the front deck. 

""Aw, for Christ's sake.""

Ice chest lid was wide open—water splattered all over the deck. I approached slowly and looked inside. Fiddlers were still flapping at the bottom. But that big blue cat? Gone. Damn thing musta flopped itself out and back into the water. Lucky son of a bitch.

No use in cryin' about it, though. I was just going to have to make do with what I had left. I closed the lid back and shoved the ice chest further from the edge with my foot. When I did, I noticed something. 

On the side that was closest to the water, there was something smeared across it. I blinked. It was a muddy handprint. A big one. Too big to have been mine. 

""Mais... *garde des don*.""

I bent down to look closer. It wasn't an old, dried-up print—it was fresh. Wet. Slimy. Still dripping. My heart dropped. I slowly stood back up and looked out into the water. First the tapping, now this? Pas bon. Somethin', or somebody, was messing with me. And they done picked the wrong one. 

I went inside and grabbed the salt. Then, I stomped back out and started at one end, pourin' until I had a thick line of it all across the border of the deck.  

""Now. Cross *that*, motherfucker.""

I folded my arms across my chest. Bayou was still. Air was silent and heavy. The sun began to shift, peaking just above the tree line and painting the water with an orange glow.

For about another hour, I searched that houseboat left, right, up, and down. Never found nothin' that would explain the tapping, though. I dragged the ice chest inside to start cleaning the fish just as the nighttime critters started up their song.

Figured I could get the most use out of the fiddlers by fryin' 'em up with some étouffée, so I started boiling my grease while I battered the strips of fish. My thumb was pulsing like a heartbeat by then, and the gauze was an ugly reddish brown. Wudn't lookin' forward to unwrapping it later.  

That's when I realized—I hadn't heard the taps yet. Maybe the salt had fixed it. Maybe it had been a bayou spirit, coming to taunt me. Some tai-tai looking to make trouble. Shit, maybe it was Kooshma. Or the rougarou. Swamp ain't got no shortage of boogeymen.

I tried to shrug it off and finish fixin' supper, but the anticipation of hearing those taps kept me tense like a mooring line during a hurricane—ready to snap at any moment. The absence of them was almost just as unsettling. By the time the food was ready, I could barely eat.

That night, I laid there in the darkness and waited for them. Breath held, mind racing, heart thumping. 

They never came.

Sleep didn't find me easy. I was up half the damn night tossin' and turnin'. Trying to listen. Trying to forget about it. The thoughts were eatin' me alive, and my body was struck with fever. Sweat seeped out from every pore, soaking my hair and burning my eyes. And my thumb hurt so bad I was 'bout ready to get up and cut the damn thing off. 

I rested my eyes for what felt like only a second before that orange beam cut through. My body was stiff. Felt like a damn corpse rising up. I looked down at my hand and realized I'd forgotten to change the bandage the night before.

""Fuck!"" 

The whole hand was swollen and starting to turn purple near the thumb. I hobbled over to the head, trembling. As soon as I unwrapped the gauze, the smell of rot hit the air instantly. The edges of my wound had turned black, and green ooze cracked through the thick crust of yellow every time I moved it. I was gonna need something stronger than alcohol. But I couldn't afford no doctor.

I went over to the closet, grabbed the hurricane lamp, and carried it back to the head with me. Carefully, I unscrewed the top, bit down on a rag, then poured the kerosene over my hand, dousing the wound. It fizzed up like Coke on a battery when it hit the scab. As it mixed with the pus and blood, it let out a hiss—the infection being drawn out. 

My whole body locked up as the pain ripped through me. Felt like a thousand fire ants chewin' on me at once. I bit down on that rag so hard I tore a hole through it. Between the fumes and the agony, I nearly passed out. But, it had to be done. Left the kerosene on there 'till it stopped burning, then rinsed off the slurry of brown foam that had collected on my thumb. 

With the hard part over with, I smeared a glob of pine resin over the cut, then wrapped it back up real tight with fresh gauze and tape. That outta do it, I thought. 

At least the taps seemed to be gone for now, and I could focus on handling my business. Goes without sayin', didn't need the coffee that morning, so I got myself dressed and headed out front to start my day. 

I took a deep breath, pulling the thick swamp air into my lungs. It didn't settle right. I scrunched my eyebrows. There was a smell to it—an odor that didn't belong. Something *unnatural*. Couldn't quite put my finger on what exactly it was, but I knew it wudn't right. That's for damn sure. 

Salt line was left untouched, though. Least my barrier was working. I bent down to pull in the trotline, and just before I got my hands on it, a bubble popped up from the water, just under where I was standing. A huge one. And then another, and another.

Each bubble was bigger than the last, like something breathin' down there. As they popped, a stench crept up into the air, hittin' me in the face like a sack of potatoes. That smell...

""Poo-yai. *La crotte!*"" 

It was worse than a month's old dead crawfish pulled out the mud. So thick, I could taste it crawlin’ down my throat. I backed away from the edge of the deck, covering my face with my good hand. Then, the damn phone rang, shattering the silence and makin' me just about shit.

The bubbles stopped. 

I stared at the water for a second. Smell still lingered—the pungent musk of rot mixed with filth. After the fourth ring, I rushed inside to shut the phone up. 

""Hello?"" I breathed, more as an exasperated statement rather than a greeting.

""Cherie!"" an old, crackly-throated voice said. 

""Oh, hey there, Mrs. Maggie. How ya doin'?""

""I'm makin' it alright, child. Hey, listen—Kenny around?""

I sighed.

""No, Maggie. He's still missing.""

""Aw, shoot. Well... tell him I need some help with my mooring line when he gets back in. Damn things 'bout to come undone.""

""Okay, I'll let him know. You take care now, buh-bye.""

I hung up the phone, shaking my head. Mrs. Maggie Wellers was the old lady that lived up the river from me. Ever since ol' Mr. Wellers dropped dead of a heart attack last year, Maggie's been, as we call down here, *pas tout la*. Poor thing only had a handful of thoughts left rattling around in that head of hers—grief took the rest. The loss of her husband was just too much for her, bless her heart.

Her son, Michael, had been a past lover of mine. T-Mike, they called him. He and I saw each other for a while back in high school, till he up and disappeared,  too. After graduation, he took off down the road and ain't no one seen him since. Guess I got a habit of losin' men to the bayou. 

Me and Maggie stayed in touch over the years—couldn't help but feel an obligation. She was just trying to hold onto whatever piece of her boy she had left. Kenny even started helping her out with things around the houseboat once ol' Wellers kicked the bucket. Looked like now we'd both be fendin' for ourselves from here on out.

By the time I got back out to the trotlines, the stink had almost dissipated. My thumb was still tender, but the pine resin had sealed it and took the sting out. Enough playin' around—time to fill up the ice chest. 

I went to pull at the line, but it didn't budge. 

""What the fuck?""

Maybe it was snagged on a log. I yanked again, hard, and nothin'. Almost felt like the damn line was pulling back—maybe I'd hooked something too big to haul in. I planted my feet, wrapped the line around my hands twice, then ripped at it with all my might. 

Suddenly, the line gave way, and I went tumbling backward onto the deck.

I landed hard on my tailbone, sending a shockwave up my spine like a bolt of lightning. When I lifted my head up and looked over at the line, I slammed my fist onto the wood planks and cursed into the wind. My voice echoed through the basin, sending the egrets up in flight. 

Every single hook was empty. All my bait was gone—*taken*. The little bit of line I had left had snapped, leaving me only with about four feet's worth. Fuckin' useless.

The bayou was testing me at every turn. I almost didn't wanna get up. Thought I might just lie there, close my eyes, and let it take me. Couldn't do that, though. I still had shit to do. I took a deep breath, pulled myself back onto my feet, and flung the ruined line back into the water. 

I went out to the back deck, prayin' for crabs. Only had four traps left, and I'd be doing real good to catch two or three in each one. Water was a little warmer than it had been in the past week or two, so I had high hopes. Shoulda known better. 

Empty. Ripped apart and shredded all to hell. Every single goddamn one of them. Didn't even holler that time. I laughed. I threw my head back and cackled into the face of the swamp. 

The turtles shot into the water. The cicadas screamed. The bullfrogs began to bellow, the toads started to sing, and a symphony of a thousand crickets vibrated through the cypress trees.

Then, the bayou suddenly fell silent. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I 'bout jumped right outta my skin. And then, a fiery rage tore through my body like a jolt of electricity. I stomped back three times with the heel of my boot, slamming it down against the deck so hard it nearly cracked the brittle wood holding me up. 

""Oh, yeah? I can do it too, motherfucker! Now what?!"" 

I was infuriated. I stood there, breathing heavy, fists balled up—just waiting for it to answer me. A few seconds passed, then I heard it again. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

But it was further away this time, toward the back of the house. 

""Goddamn son of a bitch... IT’S ON THE MOVE!""

And then the thought dawned on me: maybe it wudn't comin' from underneath like I thought. Maybe it was comin' from inside the houseboat. 

I ran in like a wild woman and started tossin' shit around and tearin' up the whole place, looking for whatever the fuck was tapping at me. Damn nutria rat or a possum done crawled up and got itself stuck somewhere. Who knows. Didn't matter what kinda swamp critter it was. When I found it, I was gonna kill it. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I pulled everything out of the cabinets and the pantry. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I cleared out all the closets and under the bed.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I flipped the sofa and Kenny's recliner. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

Each time they rang out, it was coming from a different spot in the house. I was 'bout ready to get the hammer and start rippin' up the floorboards. But by that time, the sun was gonna be settin' soon. I'd wasted a whole 'nother day with this bullshit, and I was still no closer to finding the source of that incessant racket. Least my thumb wudn't bothering me no more. 

I gave up on my search for the night and went to the deep freezer. Only one pack of shrimp left and a bag of fish heads for bait. I pulled both out to start thawin’. With my trotline ruined and all my traps torn to pieces, I needed to go out and set up a few jug lines so I'd have something to eat the next day. Wudn't gonna be much, but a couple fiddlers was better than nothin'. 

About an hour had passed with no tapping, but I knew it wudn't really gone. My heart was pounding somethin' fierce and I couldn't take the silence no more. I turned on the radio and started blasting Creedence Clearwater Revival through the speakers while I gathered up some empty jugs and fashioned me some lines. I had to hurry, though—that orange glow was already creepin' in. 

Finished up just as the twilight was fading. Now I'd just have to bait the hooks, throw 'em out, and hope for the best. I picked the radio up and brought it back inside with me. Whether it was taps or silence, didn't matter. I was gonna need to drown it out. 

I decided to start supper first. By then, my stomach was growlin' at me like a hound dog. I put a pot of grits cookin', then went to the pantry to get a can of tomatoes to throw in there, too. Least I had plenty dry goods on hand. And Kenny's last bottle of Jack. 

I bobbed my head to some Skynyrd while I drank from the bottle and stirred the grits. I tried to ignore it, but I could feel those taps start vibratin' up from the floorboard through my feet while I was cleaning the shrimp. 

After I seasoned them, I put them to simmering in the sauce pan with the tomatoes and some minced garlic. Then, I turned the fire off the grits and covered the pot. I took a deep breath. Time to go handle up on my business. Hopefully supper would be ready by the time I was done.

I dumped the fish heads into a bucket and set it down by the front door while I turned on the deck light. Then, I went out front to set the jug lines. 

As soon as I stepped out onto the deck, something stopped me in my tracks. The salt line had been broke. A huge, muddy, wet smear draped across it, ‘bout halfway up to my door. My heart sunk. And then, I heard a noise. But it wudn't the taps. This time, it was... different.

A *hiss.*

I slowly turned. There was somethin' hanging onto the side of my boat, peering just over the edge from the water. 

I dropped the bucket of fish heads on the deck and the blood splattered across my bare legs. 

It was Kenny. 

Only... it wasn't. His eyes pierced through the night like two shiny, copper pennies. His skin was a dark, muddy green, completely covered in hundreds of tiny bumps and ridges. Long, yellowed nails extended from his short, thick fingers, curling to a sharp point at the ends. They dug deep into the wood, tiny splinters peeling around them as he clung to the side of the houseboat.

""No,"" I whispered. ""*Fils de putain...* it's you, Kenny.""

He recoiled in a violent snap, slithering into the black water with a loud splash. The wave rocked the houseboat, nearly tipping me over the edge. 

I ran back inside, slamming the door shut and locking it behind me. My chest heaved as I gasped for air. There was no mistaking it. He'd come back. My eyes shot across to the galley—I needed a weapon. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

""Fuckin' stop it, Kenny!!"" 

Right as I got my hand on the knife, the houseboat began to shift, like something tryin' to pull down one side, and the damn thing went flyin' out of my hand. I stumbled forward and grabbed onto the kitchen counter as the whole boat slowly started to tilt toward starboard. 

The cabinets flew open and my Tupperware scattered all across the floor. Food went slidin' off the stove, and the bottle of Jack hit the ground and shattered. The motherfucker was tryin' to sink me. I opened up the galley window and shrieked, 

""Get the hell off my boat, you goddamn couyon!!"" 

A hand shot up from the darkness, wrapping its slimy, thick fingers around the pane of my window. Those yellow claws sunk deep into the wood below, like a hot knife in butter. I swallowed hard. He wudn't tryin' to pull me down, he was tryin' to come inside.
 
The boat slammed back down as he shot up from the murky swamp and lunged through the window. I was thrown backward into the mess of hot grits and glass, knocking my head against the floor. In a split second, he was right on top of me. 

My husband, Kenny Thibodeaux, now a monster. A reptilian abomination. A grotesque mixture of man and beast—both, but neither. The swamp had taken him. 

He wrapped his massive, slimy fingers around my throat, poking his claws into my skin. Then, he leaned in closer. My heart flopped in my chest like a brim caught in a bucket. He was cold. He was angry. And he was *hungry.*

Slowly, the corners of his mouth pulled back into a smile, revealing a row of razor sharp teeth dripping with black sludge. *That smell.* His hot breath hit me like an oven as he opened his mouth to hiss,

""Hey, Cherie... Did ya miss me?""

His grip around my neck began to tighten. I could feel the blood starting to drain from my face. This was it—he was gonna kill me. 

I turned away. I didn't want his ravenous gaze to be the last thing I saw before I left this world. When I did, I noticed the knife sitting there on the floor... right next to me. 

I smiled, then turned back to look straight into the orange glow of his copper penny eyes. I slowly reached my arm out, wrapped my fingers around the handle, then choked out, 

""Yeah, Kenny. I was hopin' you'd come back soon.""





It's been about a month now that Kenny's been gone. Such a shame they never found him. Got a freezer full of meat now, though. Good enough to last all winter. 

'Bout time for Sheriff Landry to bring back my damn pirogue. Ain't no evidence left to find. Besides, I'm gonna have to make a trip into town soon—runnin' low on cigarettes. Might as well try to find me a new man down there, too, while I'm at it. Always somethin' on this old houseboat needs fixin'.

And, hell... would ya look at that? It's almost Halloween. Maybe I'll pick me up a witch hat and a new broom at the dollar store. That outta be festive. All in all, life ain't too bad out here in the swamp. 

But every once in a while, when the bayou is still and the frogs are quiet, I can still hear the faintest little

(Not sure how much I had, and I've been adding copious amounts of milk). Anyone feel like their thoughts wibble wobble a bit after quitting coffee for a couple weeks?

And then my mental health slumps a bit. Massively reduced my sugar intake as well but it was always imperfect and with added stress who knows whats up really. It all feels so fluid though? Anyone's thoughts feel like they flow more and have extra fluidity? On some level, I have more to type/talk about? In some way the words come out much easier. On another level, hand, everything is where it is and its like I'm floating in space slightly collecting words and gently piecing them together in order to form sentences, and paragraphs? I had an adhd diagnosis, i'm not sure if its adhd now and I was tested under very dubious circumstances.

Anyhow. Quit/reduce your caffine intake, reduce sugar consumption, and then let your thoughts fly in the wind like little bees buzzing and humming about to no end.

Its like theres an added level of abstraction here? I'm sure everything is understandable, I've unfortunately run into a couple people more now misunderstanding what I'm trying to say and there being a few slight miscommunication issues. If i let it my mind could float free without form or shape it comes up with sentences that are just that, sentences. Words without meaning, thoughts im not gleaning, and a whole amazing sylablary of indented figures paragraphing along the solar solstice without a jolt of fear or pain... and on and on and just kine meandering without no course or care as if to go idk where. See? Like not much coffee for a while nad my mind just relaxes beyond its original form. Like a heated metal being melted out of its predetermined shape.

its probably bad mental health however Ive noticed it multiple times after quitting coffee. I wonder if its depression on some level as I don't think I'm depressed but apparently coffee can help with depression. (And then some level of coffee, undiluted with other things just helps solidify the mind).There is a calmness to it though. Not really the relaxed kind of calmness but calm. And then down on some dark trail my mind meanders... to what end i'll never know

Personally coffee doesn't really give me a buzz? Its made me feel depressed a few times, but never super active. (except when it does and I just feel over the top excited and energized).",1,1758501778.0,decaf,1,1.0,False
1nn8jmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1nn8jmk/i_live_alone_in_a_houseboat_on_the_bayou/,I live alone in a houseboat on the bayou. Something’s been tapping at the hull at night.,"It's been about a month now that Kenny's been gone. Three weeks and five days to be exact. He left in his pirogue one night just after sunset to go frogging and never came back. Man just up and disappeared like a fart in the wind. Now, it's just me out here on this old houseboat, alone. 

The law found the pirogue a week later, hung up on a cypress knee. No oar, no frogs, no Kenny. Just a dozen crushed-up Budweiser cans and half a pack of Marlboro Reds. Only thing is, Kenny didn't smoke. 

They had it towed back in, and I haven't seen the damn thing since. Kept it for '*evidence*', Sheriff Landry said. So, now I'm stuck out here. Unless I wanna trudge through fifty miles or so of isolated swampland—and Kenny left with the one good pair of rubber boots we had.

Search only went on for a couple more days after that. To no avail, of course. After that much time in the bog, you don't expect to find a body. At least not intact. They called it off on the first of October. My husband, Kenny Thibodeaux, presumed dead, but still officially considered a missing person. 

Some said the gators musta got him. Some thought he ran off with another woman. Some had, what I'll just call, other theories. But no one in the Atchafalaya Basin thought it was an accident. 

Hell, I ain't stupid. I know exactly what they all whisper about me. It's all the same damn shit they been saying since I was a youngin'. 

*Jezebel. Putain. Swamp Witch.*

Ha, let 'em keep talking. Don't bother me none. Not anymore. You gotta have real thick skin out in the bayou or you'll get tore up from the floor up. Me? I can hold my own. But no one comes around here anymore. Not since Kenny's been gone.

Up until a few nights ago, that is. 

I was in the galley, de-heading a batch of shrimp to fry up, when I heard it.  

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I froze with the knife in my hand. Wudn't expecting visitors; phone never rang. Maybe Landry was poking around with more questions again. I set the knife down onto the counter next to the bowl, then crept over to the front window to peek out. 

As I squinted through the dense blackness of the night, I saw something. Out on the deck, was the faint outline of a large figure standing at the edge. But it wudn't the sheriff. 

My heart dropped. I stumbled backward from the window in a panic and ran for the knife on the counter. My fingers wrapped around the handle and,

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

The sound pulsed through the floorboards beneath my feet. Sharp, like the edge of a knuckle hitting a hollow door. I lifted the knife, shrimp guts still dripping from the edge of the blade. Then, I took a deep breath and flipped the deck light on.

Nothin'. 

I paused for a moment, scanning what little area was illuminated by the dim, flickering yellow light. No boats. No critters. No large dark figures. Just a cacophony of cicadas screaming into the void, and the glimmering eyes of all the frogs Kenny never caught. 

I shut the light back off and threw the curtains closed.

""*Mais la.*""

My mind was playing tricks on me. At least that's what I thought at the time—must've just been a log bumping into the pontoons. I shrugged it off and went back to the shrimp. De-veined, cleaned, and battered. I chucked the shrimp heads out the galley window for the catfish, then sat down and had myself a good supper.

Once I'd picked up the mess and saved the dishes, I went off to get washed up before bed. After I'd settled in under the covers, I started thinking about Kenny. 

He wudn't a bad man. Not really. Sure, he was a rough-around-the-edges couyon with a mean streak like a water moccasin when he got to drinking. But he meant well. I turned over and stared at the empty side of the bed, listening to the toads sing me to sleep.

The light of the next morning cut through the cabin window like a filet knife through a sac-à-lait. I dragged myself up and threw on a pot of coffee. French roast. I had a feeling I'd need the kick in the ass that day. 

I sat on the front deck, sipping and gazing out into the morning mist, when I heard the unmistakable sound of an outboard approaching. I leaned forward. It was Sheriff Landry. He pulled his boat up along starboard and shut the engine off. 

""Hey Cherie, how you holding up?""

""I'm doin' alright. How's your mom and them?"" 

""Oh, just fine,"" he chuckled. ""Mind if I get down for a second? Just got a couple more questions for ya.""

""Allons,"" I said, gesturing for him to come aboard. ""Let me get you a cup of coffee.""

""No, no, that's okay. Already had my fill this morning."" 

I nodded. He stepped onto the deck with his hands resting on his belt and shuffled toward me, his boots click-clacking against the brittle wood. 

""Now, I'm not one to pry into the personal affairs between a husband and his wife, but since this is still an ongoing investigation, I gotta ask. How was your relationship with Kenny?""

I took a long sip, then set the mug down. 

""Suppose it was like any other, I guess."" 

""Did you two ever fight?""

""Sometimes,"" I shrugged. 

He paused for a beat, then spat out his wad of dip into the water. 

""Were y'all fighting the night he came up missing?""

""Not that I recall.""

""Not that you recall. Hmm. Well, I know one thing,"" he said, turning to look out into the water. ""There's something fishy about all this. Man didn't just disappear—somethin' musta happened to him.""

I took a deep breath. 

""Sheriff... I wanna know where he's at just as much as y'all do.""

""That so?""

He smiled, and I folded my arms in front of me. 

""Funny thing is, Mrs. Thibodeaux, you ain't cried once since Kenny's been  gone."" 

A cool breeze kicked up just then, sending the knotted-up seashells and bones I used as a wind chime clanging together. He looked over at it with a hairy eyeball. 

""With all due respect, Landry, I do my cryin' alone. Now, can I get back to my coffee? Got a lot to do today. Always somethin' needs fixin' on this old houseboat."" 

He tipped his hat and shot another stream of orange spit over the side of the deck, then got back in his boat and took off.

Day flew by after that. Between baiting and throwing out the trotlines, setting up crab traps, and replacing a rotten deck board, I already had my hands full. But then, when I went to scrape the algae off the sides of the pontoons, I found a damn leak that needed patching. 

There was a small hole in the one sitting right under the galley. Looked like somethin' sharp had poked through it—too sharp to be a log.  Maybe a snapping turtle got ahold of it, I thought. Ain't never seen one bite clean through metal before, though. 

Before I knew it, the sun was goin' down, and it was time to start seein' about fixin' supper. No crabs, but when I checked my lines, I'd snagged me a catfish. After I dumped a can of tomatoes into the cast iron, I put a pot of rice cooking to go with my coubion. I was in the middle of filleting the catfish when I heard it again. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I jerked forward, slicing a deep gash into my thumb in the process.

""*Merde!* Goddammit to hell!"" 

It was damn near down to the bone. I grabbed a dish rag and pressed it tight against my gushing wound, holding my hands over the sink. The blood seeped right through. Drops of red slammed down against the white porcelain with urgency, splattering as they landed. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I winced and raised my head to look out the galley window. Nothing but frog eyes shining through the night. 

""What in the fuck is that noise?!"" I shouted angrily to an empty room. 

Just crickets. The frogs didn't have shit to say that time. 

I checked the front deck, of course, but wudn't nobody out there. Then, I hurried over to the head to get the first aid kit, bleeding like a pig and cussin' up a storm the whole way. Once I'd cleaned and bandaged up my cut, I went back into the galley, determined to finish cooking. 

I threw the catfish guts out the galley window, ate my fill, then went to bed. Didn't hear it again that night. Ain't nothing I could do about it right then anyway—Kenny left with the good flashlight. I was just gonna have to investigate that damn noise in the daytime. Had to be *somethin’* down there in the water tapping at the hull...

The next morning, I woke up to my thumb throbbin'. When I changed the bandage, let me tell ya, it was nasty—redder than a boiled crawfish and oozing yellowish-green pus from the chunk of meat I'd cut outta myself. The catfish slime had gotten into my blood and lit up my whole hand like it was on fire. 

*Damn... musta not cleaned it good enough.*

I scrubbed the whole hand with Dawn, doused the gash with more rubbing alcohol, then wrapped it back up with gauze and tape. Didn't have much more time to tend to it than that; I had shit to do.

First order of business (after my coffee, of course) was checking the traps and lines. The air smelled like a storm coming. Deep freezer was getting low on stock, and I was running outta time. A cold spell was rippin' through the bayou, and winter was right on its ass. 

I blared some ZZ Top while I started hauling in. One by one, I brought up an empty trap, still set with bait. It seemed only the tiny nibblers of the basin had been interested in the rotten chicken legs. Until I pulled up the last trap—the one set closest to the galley window. 

Damn thing was mangled. I'm talkin' beat the hell up. Something had tore clean through the metal caging, ripping it open and snatchin' the bait from inside. I slammed the ruined trap onto the deck in frustration. 

""Damn gators! Motherfucker!""

I stared down at the tangled mess of rusty metal. Maybe that's what's been knocking around down there, I thought.  Just a canaille, overgrown reptile fucking up my traps and thievin' my bait. 

Still, something was gnawin’ at me. The  taps—they seemed too measured. Too methodical. And always in sets of three. Gators, well... they can't count, far as I'm aware. 

Had a little more luck on the trotlines. Not by much, though. Got a couple fiddlers, another good-sized blue cat, and a big stupid gar that got itself tangled up and made a mess of half the line. Had to cut him loose and lost 'bout fifty feet. The bastard thrashed so hard he just about broke my wrist, teeth gnashin' and snappin' like a goddamn bear trap. 

Of course my thumb was screaming after that, but I didn't have time to stop. I threw the catch in the ice chest and re-baited the rest of the line I had left. After that, it was time to figure out once and for all just what the hell was making that racket under the hull.

I went around to the back to start looking there. Nothing loose, nothing out of place. I leaned forward to look over the side.

Then, I heard a loud splash.

I snapped back upright. The sound had come from around the other side of the houseboat. I ran back through the cabin out onto the front deck. 

""Aw, for Christ's sake.""

Ice chest lid was wide open—water splattered all over the deck. I approached slowly and looked inside. Fiddlers were still flapping at the bottom. But that big blue cat? Gone. Damn thing musta flopped itself out and back into the water. Lucky son of a bitch.

No use in cryin' about it, though. I was just going to have to make do with what I had left. I closed the lid back and shoved the ice chest further from the edge with my foot. When I did, I noticed something. 

On the side that was closest to the water, there was something smeared across it. I blinked. It was a muddy handprint. A big one. Too big to have been mine. 

""Mais... *garde des don*.""

I bent down to look closer. It wasn't an old, dried-up print—it was fresh. Wet. Slimy. Still dripping. My heart dropped. I slowly stood back up and looked out into the water. First the tapping, now this? Pas bon. Somethin', or somebody, was messing with me. And they done picked the wrong one. 

I went inside and grabbed the salt. Then, I stomped back out and started at one end, pourin' until I had a thick line of it all across the border of the deck.  

""Now. Cross *that*, motherfucker.""

I folded my arms across my chest. Bayou was still. Air was silent and heavy. The sun began to shift, peaking just above the tree line and painting the water with an orange glow.

For about another hour, I searched that houseboat left, right, up, and down. Never found nothin' that would explain the tapping, though. I dragged the ice chest inside to start cleaning the fish just as the nighttime critters started up their song.

Figured I could get the most use out of the fiddlers by fryin' 'em up with some étouffée, so I started boiling my grease while I battered the strips of fish. My thumb was pulsing like a heartbeat by then, and the gauze was an ugly reddish brown. Wudn't lookin' forward to unwrapping it later.  

That's when I realized—I hadn't heard the taps yet. Maybe the salt had fixed it. Maybe it had been a bayou spirit, coming to taunt me. Some tai-tai looking to make trouble. Shit, maybe it was Kooshma. Or the rougarou. Swamp ain't got no shortage of boogeymen.

I tried to shrug it off and finish fixin' supper, but the anticipation of hearing those taps kept me tense like a mooring line during a hurricane—ready to snap at any moment. The absence of them was almost just as unsettling. By the time the food was ready, I could barely eat.

That night, I laid there in the darkness and waited for them. Breath held, mind racing, heart thumping. 

They never came.

Sleep didn't find me easy. I was up half the damn night tossin' and turnin'. Trying to listen. Trying to forget about it. The thoughts were eatin' me alive, and my body was struck with fever. Sweat seeped out from every pore, soaking my hair and burning my eyes. And my thumb hurt so bad I was 'bout ready to get up and cut the damn thing off. 

I rested my eyes for what felt like only a second before that orange beam cut through. My body was stiff. Felt like a damn corpse rising up. I looked down at my hand and realized I'd forgotten to change the bandage the night before.

""Fuck!"" 

The whole hand was swollen and starting to turn purple near the thumb. I hobbled over to the head, trembling. As soon as I unwrapped the gauze, the smell of rot hit the air instantly. The edges of my wound had turned black, and green ooze cracked through the thick crust of yellow every time I moved it. I was gonna need something stronger than alcohol. But I couldn't afford no doctor.

I went over to the closet, grabbed the hurricane lamp, and carried it back to the head with me. Carefully, I unscrewed the top, bit down on a rag, then poured the kerosene over my hand, dousing the wound. It fizzed up like Coke on a battery when it hit the scab. As it mixed with the pus and blood, it let out a hiss—the infection being drawn out. 

My whole body locked up as the pain ripped through me. Felt like a thousand fire ants chewin' on me at once. I bit down on that rag so hard I tore a hole through it. Between the fumes and the agony, I nearly passed out. But, it had to be done. Left the kerosene on there 'till it stopped burning, then rinsed off the slurry of brown foam that had collected on my thumb. 

With the hard part over with, I smeared a glob of pine resin over the cut, then wrapped it back up real tight with fresh gauze and tape. That outta do it, I thought. 

At least the taps seemed to be gone for now, and I could focus on handling my business. Goes without sayin', didn't need the coffee that morning, so I got myself dressed and headed out front to start my day. 

I took a deep breath, pulling the thick swamp air into my lungs. It didn't settle right. I scrunched my eyebrows. There was a smell to it—an odor that didn't belong. Something *unnatural*. Couldn't quite put my finger on what exactly it was, but I knew it wudn't right. That's for damn sure. 

Salt line was left untouched, though. Least my barrier was working. I bent down to pull in the trotline, and just before I got my hands on it, a bubble popped up from the water, just under where I was standing. A huge one. And then another, and another.

Each bubble was bigger than the last, like something breathin' down there. As they popped, a stench crept up into the air, hittin' me in the face like a sack of potatoes. That smell...

""Poo-yai. *La crotte!*"" 

It was worse than a month's old dead crawfish pulled out the mud. So thick, I could taste it crawlin’ down my throat. I backed away from the edge of the deck, covering my face with my good hand. Then, the damn phone rang, shattering the silence and makin' me just about shit.

The bubbles stopped. 

I stared at the water for a second. Smell still lingered—the pungent musk of rot mixed with filth. After the fourth ring, I rushed inside to shut the phone up. 

""Hello?"" I breathed, more as an exasperated statement rather than a greeting.

""Cherie!"" an old, crackly-throated voice said. 

""Oh, hey there, Mrs. Maggie. How ya doin'?""

""I'm makin' it alright, child. Hey, listen—Kenny around?""

I sighed.

""No, Maggie. He's still missing.""

""Aw, shoot. Well... tell him I need some help with my mooring line when he gets back in. Damn things 'bout to come undone.""

""Okay, I'll let him know. You take care now, buh-bye.""

I hung up the phone, shaking my head. Mrs. Maggie Wellers was the old lady that lived up the river from me. Ever since ol' Mr. Wellers dropped dead of a heart attack last year, Maggie's been, as we call down here, *pas tout la*. Poor thing only had a handful of thoughts left rattling around in that head of hers—grief took the rest. The loss of her husband was just too much for her, bless her heart.

Her son, Michael, had been a past lover of mine. T-Mike, they called him. He and I saw each other for a while back in high school, till he up and disappeared,  too. After graduation, he took off down the road and ain't no one seen him since. Guess I got a habit of losin' men to the bayou. 

Me and Maggie stayed in touch over the years—couldn't help but feel an obligation. She was just trying to hold onto whatever piece of her boy she had left. Kenny even started helping her out with things around the houseboat once ol' Wellers kicked the bucket. Looked like now we'd both be fendin' for ourselves from here on out.

By the time I got back out to the trotlines, the stink had almost dissipated. My thumb was still tender, but the pine resin had sealed it and took the sting out. Enough playin' around—time to fill up the ice chest. 

I went to pull at the line, but it didn't budge. 

""What the fuck?""

Maybe it was snagged on a log. I yanked again, hard, and nothin'. Almost felt like the damn line was pulling back—maybe I'd hooked something too big to haul in. I planted my feet, wrapped the line around my hands twice, then ripped at it with all my might. 

Suddenly, the line gave way, and I went tumbling backward onto the deck.

I landed hard on my tailbone, sending a shockwave up my spine like a bolt of lightning. When I lifted my head up and looked over at the line, I slammed my fist onto the wood planks and cursed into the wind. My voice echoed through the basin, sending the egrets up in flight. 

Every single hook was empty. All my bait was gone—*taken*. The little bit of line I had left had snapped, leaving me only with about four feet's worth. Fuckin' useless.

The bayou was testing me at every turn. I almost didn't wanna get up. Thought I might just lie there, close my eyes, and let it take me. Couldn't do that, though. I still had shit to do. I took a deep breath, pulled myself back onto my feet, and flung the ruined line back into the water. 

I went out to the back deck, prayin' for crabs. Only had four traps left, and I'd be doing real good to catch two or three in each one. Water was a little warmer than it had been in the past week or two, so I had high hopes. Shoulda known better. 

Empty. Ripped apart and shredded all to hell. Every single goddamn one of them. Didn't even holler that time. I laughed. I threw my head back and cackled into the face of the swamp. 

The turtles shot into the water. The cicadas screamed. The bullfrogs began to bellow, the toads started to sing, and a symphony of a thousand crickets vibrated through the cypress trees.

Then, the bayou suddenly fell silent. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I 'bout jumped right outta my skin. And then, a fiery rage tore through my body like a jolt of electricity. I stomped back three times with the heel of my boot, slamming it down against the deck so hard it nearly cracked the brittle wood holding me up. 

""Oh, yeah? I can do it too, motherfucker! Now what?!"" 

I was infuriated. I stood there, breathing heavy, fists balled up—just waiting for it to answer me. A few seconds passed, then I heard it again. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

But it was further away this time, toward the back of the house. 

""Goddamn son of a bitch... IT’S ON THE MOVE!""

And then the thought dawned on me: maybe it wudn't comin' from underneath like I thought. Maybe it was comin' from inside the houseboat. 

I ran in like a wild woman and started tossin' shit around and tearin' up the whole place, looking for whatever the fuck was tapping at me. Damn nutria rat or a possum done crawled up and got itself stuck somewhere. Who knows. Didn't matter what kinda swamp critter it was. When I found it, I was gonna kill it. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I pulled everything out of the cabinets and the pantry. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I cleared out all the closets and under the bed.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I flipped the sofa and Kenny's recliner. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

Each time they rang out, it was coming from a different spot in the house. I was 'bout ready to get the hammer and start rippin' up the floorboards. But by that time, the sun was gonna be settin' soon. I'd wasted a whole 'nother day with this bullshit, and I was still no closer to finding the source of that incessant racket. Least my thumb wudn't bothering me no more. 

I gave up on my search for the night and went to the deep freezer. Only one pack of shrimp left and a bag of fish heads for bait. I pulled both out to start thawin’. With my trotline ruined and all my traps torn to pieces, I needed to go out and set up a few jug lines so I'd have something to eat the next day. Wudn't gonna be much, but a couple fiddlers was better than nothin'. 

About an hour had passed with no tapping, but I knew it wudn't really gone. My heart was pounding somethin' fierce and I couldn't take the silence no more. I turned on the radio and started blasting Creedence Clearwater Revival through the speakers while I gathered up some empty jugs and fashioned me some lines. I had to hurry, though—that orange glow was already creepin' in. 

Finished up just as the twilight was fading. Now I'd just have to bait the hooks, throw 'em out, and hope for the best. I picked the radio up and brought it back inside with me. Whether it was taps or silence, didn't matter. I was gonna need to drown it out. 

I decided to start supper first. By then, my stomach was growlin' at me like a hound dog. I put a pot of grits cookin', then went to the pantry to get a can of tomatoes to throw in there, too. Least I had plenty dry goods on hand. And Kenny's last bottle of Jack. 

I bobbed my head to some Skynyrd while I drank from the bottle and stirred the grits. I tried to ignore it, but I could feel those taps start vibratin' up from the floorboard through my feet while I was cleaning the shrimp. 

After I seasoned them, I put them to simmering in the sauce pan with the tomatoes and some minced garlic. Then, I turned the fire off the grits and covered the pot. I took a deep breath. Time to go handle up on my business. Hopefully supper would be ready by the time I was done.

I dumped the fish heads into a bucket and set it down by the front door while I turned on the deck light. Then, I went out front to set the jug lines. 

As soon as I stepped out onto the deck, something stopped me in my tracks. The salt line had been broke. A huge, muddy, wet smear draped across it, ‘bout halfway up to my door. My heart sunk. And then, I heard a noise. But it wudn't the taps. This time, it was... different.

A *hiss.*

I slowly turned. There was somethin' hanging onto the side of my boat, peering just over the edge from the water. 

I dropped the bucket of fish heads on the deck and the blood splattered across my bare legs. 

It was Kenny. 

Only... it wasn't. His eyes pierced through the night like two shiny, copper pennies. His skin was a dark, muddy green, completely covered in hundreds of tiny bumps and ridges. Long, yellowed nails extended from his short, thick fingers, curling to a sharp point at the ends. They dug deep into the wood, tiny splinters peeling around them as he clung to the side of the houseboat.

""No,"" I whispered. ""*Fils de putain...* it's you, Kenny.""

He recoiled in a violent snap, slithering into the black water with a loud splash. The wave rocked the houseboat, nearly tipping me over the edge. 

I ran back inside, slamming the door shut and locking it behind me. My chest heaved as I gasped for air. There was no mistaking it. He'd come back. My eyes shot across to the galley—I needed a weapon. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

""Fuckin' stop it, Kenny!!"" 

Right as I got my hand on the knife, the houseboat began to shift, like something tryin' to pull down one side, and the damn thing went flyin' out of my hand. I stumbled forward and grabbed onto the kitchen counter as the whole boat slowly started to tilt toward starboard. 

The cabinets flew open and my Tupperware scattered all across the floor. Food went slidin' off the stove, and the bottle of Jack hit the ground and shattered. The motherfucker was tryin' to sink me. I opened up the galley window and shrieked, 

""Get the hell off my boat, you goddamn couyon!!"" 

A hand shot up from the darkness, wrapping its slimy, thick fingers around the pane of my window. Those yellow claws sunk deep into the wood below, like a hot knife in butter. I swallowed hard. He wudn't tryin' to pull me down, he was tryin' to come inside.
 
The boat slammed back down as he shot up from the murky swamp and lunged through the window. I was thrown backward into the mess of hot grits and glass, knocking my head against the floor. In a split second, he was right on top of me. 

My husband, Kenny Thibodeaux, now a monster. A reptilian abomination. A grotesque mixture of man and beast—both, but neither. The swamp had taken him. 

He wrapped his massive, slimy fingers around my throat, poking his claws into my skin. Then, he leaned in closer. My heart flopped in my chest like a brim caught in a bucket. He was cold. He was angry. And he was *hungry.*

Slowly, the corners of his mouth pulled back into a smile, revealing a row of razor sharp teeth dripping with black sludge. *That smell.* His hot breath hit me like an oven as he opened his mouth to hiss,

""Hey, Cherie... Did ya miss me?""

His grip around my neck began to tighten. I could feel the blood starting to drain from my face. This was it—he was gonna kill me. 

I turned away. I didn't want his ravenous gaze to be the last thing I saw before I left this world. When I did, I noticed the knife sitting there on the floor... right next to me. 

I smiled, then turned back to look straight into the orange glow of his copper penny eyes. I slowly reached my arm out, wrapped my fingers around the handle, then choked out, 

""Yeah, Kenny. I was hopin' you'd come back soon.""





It's been about a month now that Kenny's been gone. Such a shame they never found him. Got a freezer full of meat now, though. Good enough to last all winter. 

'Bout time for Sheriff Landry to bring back my damn pirogue. Ain't no evidence left to find. Besides, I'm gonna have to make a trip into town soon—runnin' low on cigarettes. Might as well try to find me a new man down there, too, while I'm at it. Always somethin' on this old houseboat needs fixin'.

And, hell... would ya look at that? It's almost Halloween. Maybe I'll pick me up a witch hat and a new broom at the dollar store. That outta be festive. All in all, life ain't too bad out here in the swamp. 

But every once in a while, when the bayou is still and the frogs are quiet, I can still hear the faintest little

1nn8jff,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nn8jff/my_ex_is_stalking_me/,My ex is stalking me,"I broke up with him over the summer. We weren’t compatible plus we came from completely different backgrounds, and no matter how much we tried to make it work, it just didn’t feel right. It ended, and I thought that was it. But when the university year started again a few weeks ago, things started to feel... off. I didn’t attend uni for the first two days. A close friend of mine, who also happens to be his friend, did. She told me he completely ignored her when I wasn’t there, didn’t even say hello. But the moment I came back, he changed. He suddenly became bubbly and friendly with her again, jumping into our conversations, even when he wasn’t invited. It was obvious he was trying to get my attention, inserting himself wherever he could. The next day, I tried to return the cheap Valentine’s gift he gave me. I told him I wanted nothing to do with it anymore, and that the other option was just to throw it in the trash. He refused to take it back, telling me “It holds memories” and that if I threw it away, he’d have to give back the silver ring I got him. I didn’t care. I threw it away anyway. Another time, I was heading to a nearby coffee shop with a friend to grab something and come right back. He tagged along uninvited. As we were walking, he kept inserting himself between us. When I sped up, he did too, just to stay close to me. I didn’t even notice how obvious it was until my friend pointed it out later that afternoon. When we returned to uni, I went upstairs to grab something from class. He followed me. We were alone. He sat awkwardly on his phone, pretending to be distracted, then suddenly asked if we could stay friends. I gave him a cold, unclear response. I wasn’t interested in reconnecting. I needed space. Still, he closed the door behind us. I felt suffocated. Later, I was sitting in class next to another girl, someone who didn’t know we had dated. Out of nowhere, she asked if something had happened between me and him. Confused, I said no and asked why. She told me she had noticed him staring at me a lot not once or twice, but constantly, in class and outside. She also pointed out that when I returned to uni, he only greeted me and ignored the rest of the group. It was strange. She wasn’t the only one who noticed. Other friends started saying the same thing; that he always showed up wherever I went, that it looked like he was listening in on our conversations, and that he never took his eyes off me. That’s when it hit me: he might be stalking me. Every time I went to sit with my friends, he was already there. Every time we were alone in the classroom, he shut the door and started talking about himself or some personal problem, like I owed him empathy. I made it clear I wanted nothing to do with him, but he never listened. He’d talk about taking Xanax or going to therapy, but to me, it only made it seem like he was using his mental health to manipulate guilt. Like he wanted me to feel bad for leaving. My friends and I even planned to avoid him altogether. We came up with a strategy to exclude him from our usual coffee shop hangouts. One couple (mutual friends) told him I wouldn’t be there and that they just wanted some time alone. Somehow, he still showed up. He had two cheaper coffee shop options right by campus, but he chose the one he knew we were going to. It felt deliberate; like he came just to see if we were lying to him. He sat right next to me and didn’t speak. Only listened whenever I talked. And then today, everything came crashing down. I was looking for my favorite jewelry and couldn’t find it anywhere. That’s when I remembered something strange: just this week, when I came home, some of my belongings were in places I don’t remember leaving them. My vanity drawer was wide open. Mind you I NEVER leave it like that. I brushed it off at the time, but now I can’t. Because the only things missing are the items that mean the most to me. He didn’t come to uni that day. He knows where I live.He’s been to my home. And maybe, just maybe… he made a copy of my key without me noticing. The things that were taken weren’t random. Not my money. Not my mom’s gold. Not even my own gold. No electronics. No valuables. Just: ⁃	My favorite necklace: the one I almost never take off. ⁃	The silver ring: the one he once wrapped in paper when its stone fell out. ⁃	And the ring my best friend gave me. He knew what those pieces meant to me. He knew they were irreplaceable — tied to memory, love, and identity. Not just jewelry, but parts of me. Tomorrow I’m checking the building’s security footage. It’s Sunday today, and the guy who handles it doesn’t work weekends. I’m praying. Honestly, BEGGING that it’s not him. That this is all in my head. That it’s some weird misunderstanding. But deep down, I know this isn’t just a coincidence. Everything fits too perfectly. Every little moment adds up. And yet I still find myself asking: Am I crazy? Please, tell me I’m not. Your friend needs some advice on what to do in this situation. I’m talking… very subtle and serious advice. Please. I’m desperate.",1,1758501727.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Something’s been tapping at the hull at night.,"It's been about a month now that Kenny's been gone. Three weeks and five days to be exact. He left in his pirogue one night just after sunset to go frogging and never came back. Man just up and disappeared like a fart in the wind. Now, it's just me out here on this old houseboat, alone. 

The law found the pirogue a week later, hung up on a cypress knee. No oar, no frogs, no Kenny. Just a dozen crushed-up Budweiser cans and half a pack of Marlboro Reds. Only thing is, Kenny didn't smoke. 

They had it towed back in, and I haven't seen the damn thing since. Kept it for '*evidence*', Sheriff Landry said. So, now I'm stuck out here. Unless I wanna trudge through fifty miles or so of isolated swampland—and Kenny left with the one good pair of rubber boots we had.

Search only went on for a couple more days after that. To no avail, of course. After that much time in the bog, you don't expect to find a body. At least not intact. They called it off on the first of October. My husband, Kenny Thibodeaux, presumed dead, but still officially considered a missing person. 

Some said the gators musta got him. Some thought he ran off with another woman. Some had, what I'll just call, other theories. But no one in the Atchafalaya Basin thought it was an accident. 

Hell, I ain't stupid. I know exactly what they all whisper about me. It's all the same damn shit they been saying since I was a youngin'. 

*Jezebel. Putain. Swamp Witch.*

Ha, let 'em keep talking. Don't bother me none. Not anymore. You gotta have real thick skin out in the bayou or you'll get tore up from the floor up. Me? I can hold my own. But no one comes around here anymore. Not since Kenny's been gone.

Up until a few nights ago, that is. 

I was in the galley, de-heading a batch of shrimp to fry up, when I heard it.  

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I froze with the knife in my hand. Wudn't expecting visitors; phone never rang. Maybe Landry was poking around with more questions again. I set the knife down onto the counter next to the bowl, then crept over to the front window to peek out. 

As I squinted through the dense blackness of the night, I saw something. Out on the deck, was the faint outline of a large figure standing at the edge. But it wudn't the sheriff. 

My heart dropped. I stumbled backward from the window in a panic and ran for the knife on the counter. My fingers wrapped around the handle and,

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

The sound pulsed through the floorboards beneath my feet. Sharp, like the edge of a knuckle hitting a hollow door. I lifted the knife, shrimp guts still dripping from the edge of the blade. Then, I took a deep breath and flipped the deck light on.

Nothin'. 

I paused for a moment, scanning what little area was illuminated by the dim, flickering yellow light. No boats. No critters. No large dark figures. Just a cacophony of cicadas screaming into the void, and the glimmering eyes of all the frogs Kenny never caught. 

I shut the light back off and threw the curtains closed.

""*Mais la.*""

My mind was playing tricks on me. At least that's what I thought at the time—must've just been a log bumping into the pontoons. I shrugged it off and went back to the shrimp. De-veined, cleaned, and battered. I chucked the shrimp heads out the galley window for the catfish, then sat down and had myself a good supper.

Once I'd picked up the mess and saved the dishes, I went off to get washed up before bed. After I'd settled in under the covers, I started thinking about Kenny. 

He wudn't a bad man. Not really. Sure, he was a rough-around-the-edges couyon with a mean streak like a water moccasin when he got to drinking. But he meant well. I turned over and stared at the empty side of the bed, listening to the toads sing me to sleep.

The light of the next morning cut through the cabin window like a filet knife through a sac-à-lait. I dragged myself up and threw on a pot of coffee. French roast. I had a feeling I'd need the kick in the ass that day. 

I sat on the front deck, sipping and gazing out into the morning mist, when I heard the unmistakable sound of an outboard approaching. I leaned forward. It was Sheriff Landry. He pulled his boat up along starboard and shut the engine off. 

""Hey Cherie, how you holding up?""

""I'm doin' alright. How's your mom and them?"" 

""Oh, just fine,"" he chuckled. ""Mind if I get down for a second? Just got a couple more questions for ya.""

""Allons,"" I said, gesturing for him to come aboard. ""Let me get you a cup of coffee.""

""No, no, that's okay. Already had my fill this morning."" 

I nodded. He stepped onto the deck with his hands resting on his belt and shuffled toward me, his boots click-clacking against the brittle wood. 

""Now, I'm not one to pry into the personal affairs between a husband and his wife, but since this is still an ongoing investigation, I gotta ask. How was your relationship with Kenny?""

I took a long sip, then set the mug down. 

""Suppose it was like any other, I guess."" 

""Did you two ever fight?""

""Sometimes,"" I shrugged. 

He paused for a beat, then spat out his wad of dip into the water. 

""Were y'all fighting the night he came up missing?""

""Not that I recall.""

""Not that you recall. Hmm. Well, I know one thing,"" he said, turning to look out into the water. ""There's something fishy about all this. Man didn't just disappear—somethin' musta happened to him.""

I took a deep breath. 

""Sheriff... I wanna know where he's at just as much as y'all do.""

""That so?""

He smiled, and I folded my arms in front of me. 

""Funny thing is, Mrs. Thibodeaux, you ain't cried once since Kenny's been  gone."" 

A cool breeze kicked up just then, sending the knotted-up seashells and bones I used as a wind chime clanging together. He looked over at it with a hairy eyeball. 

""With all due respect, Landry, I do my cryin' alone. Now, can I get back to my coffee? Got a lot to do today. Always somethin' needs fixin' on this old houseboat."" 

He tipped his hat and shot another stream of orange spit over the side of the deck, then got back in his boat and took off.

Day flew by after that. Between baiting and throwing out the trotlines, setting up crab traps, and replacing a rotten deck board, I already had my hands full. But then, when I went to scrape the algae off the sides of the pontoons, I found a damn leak that needed patching. 

There was a small hole in the one sitting right under the galley. Looked like somethin' sharp had poked through it—too sharp to be a log.  Maybe a snapping turtle got ahold of it, I thought. Ain't never seen one bite clean through metal before, though. 

Before I knew it, the sun was goin' down, and it was time to start seein' about fixin' supper. No crabs, but when I checked my lines, I'd snagged me a catfish. After I dumped a can of tomatoes into the cast iron, I put a pot of rice cooking to go with my coubion. I was in the middle of filleting the catfish when I heard it again. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I jerked forward, slicing a deep gash into my thumb in the process.

""*Merde!* Goddammit to hell!"" 

It was damn near down to the bone. I grabbed a dish rag and pressed it tight against my gushing wound, holding my hands over the sink. The blood seeped right through. Drops of red slammed down against the white porcelain with urgency, splattering as they landed. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I winced and raised my head to look out the galley window. Nothing but frog eyes shining through the night. 

""What in the fuck is that noise?!"" I shouted angrily to an empty room. 

Just crickets. The frogs didn't have shit to say that time. 

I checked the front deck, of course, but wudn't nobody out there. Then, I hurried over to the head to get the first aid kit, bleeding like a pig and cussin' up a storm the whole way. Once I'd cleaned and bandaged up my cut, I went back into the galley, determined to finish cooking. 

I threw the catfish guts out the galley window, ate my fill, then went to bed. Didn't hear it again that night. Ain't nothing I could do about it right then anyway—Kenny left with the good flashlight. I was just gonna have to investigate that damn noise in the daytime. Had to be *somethin’* down there in the water tapping at the hull...

The next morning, I woke up to my thumb throbbin'. When I changed the bandage, let me tell ya, it was nasty—redder than a boiled crawfish and oozing yellowish-green pus from the chunk of meat I'd cut outta myself. The catfish slime had gotten into my blood and lit up my whole hand like it was on fire. 

*Damn... musta not cleaned it good enough.*

I scrubbed the whole hand with Dawn, doused the gash with more rubbing alcohol, then wrapped it back up with gauze and tape. Didn't have much more time to tend to it than that; I had shit to do.

First order of business (after my coffee, of course) was checking the traps and lines. The air smelled like a storm coming. Deep freezer was getting low on stock, and I was running outta time. A cold spell was rippin' through the bayou, and winter was right on its ass. 

I blared some ZZ Top while I started hauling in. One by one, I brought up an empty trap, still set with bait. It seemed only the tiny nibblers of the basin had been interested in the rotten chicken legs. Until I pulled up the last trap—the one set closest to the galley window. 

Damn thing was mangled. I'm talkin' beat the hell up. Something had tore clean through the metal caging, ripping it open and snatchin' the bait from inside. I slammed the ruined trap onto the deck in frustration. 

""Damn gators! Motherfucker!""

I stared down at the tangled mess of rusty metal. Maybe that's what's been knocking around down there, I thought.  Just a canaille, overgrown reptile fucking up my traps and thievin' my bait. 

Still, something was gnawin’ at me. The  taps—they seemed too measured. Too methodical. And always in sets of three. Gators, well... they can't count, far as I'm aware. 

Had a little more luck on the trotlines. Not by much, though. Got a couple fiddlers, another good-sized blue cat, and a big stupid gar that got itself tangled up and made a mess of half the line. Had to cut him loose and lost 'bout fifty feet. The bastard thrashed so hard he just about broke my wrist, teeth gnashin' and snappin' like a goddamn bear trap. 

Of course my thumb was screaming after that, but I didn't have time to stop. I threw the catch in the ice chest and re-baited the rest of the line I had left. After that, it was time to figure out once and for all just what the hell was making that racket under the hull.

I went around to the back to start looking there. Nothing loose, nothing out of place. I leaned forward to look over the side.

Then, I heard a loud splash.

I snapped back upright. The sound had come from around the other side of the houseboat. I ran back through the cabin out onto the front deck. 

""Aw, for Christ's sake.""

Ice chest lid was wide open—water splattered all over the deck. I approached slowly and looked inside. Fiddlers were still flapping at the bottom. But that big blue cat? Gone. Damn thing musta flopped itself out and back into the water. Lucky son of a bitch.

No use in cryin' about it, though. I was just going to have to make do with what I had left. I closed the lid back and shoved the ice chest further from the edge with my foot. When I did, I noticed something. 

On the side that was closest to the water, there was something smeared across it. I blinked. It was a muddy handprint. A big one. Too big to have been mine. 

""Mais... *garde des don*.""

I bent down to look closer. It wasn't an old, dried-up print—it was fresh. Wet. Slimy. Still dripping. My heart dropped. I slowly stood back up and looked out into the water. First the tapping, now this? Pas bon. Somethin', or somebody, was messing with me. And they done picked the wrong one. 

I went inside and grabbed the salt. Then, I stomped back out and started at one end, pourin' until I had a thick line of it all across the border of the deck.  

""Now. Cross *that*, motherfucker.""

I folded my arms across my chest. Bayou was still. Air was silent and heavy. The sun began to shift, peaking just above the tree line and painting the water with an orange glow.

For about another hour, I searched that houseboat left, right, up, and down. Never found nothin' that would explain the tapping, though. I dragged the ice chest inside to start cleaning the fish just as the nighttime critters started up their song.

Figured I could get the most use out of the fiddlers by fryin' 'em up with some étouffée, so I started boiling my grease while I battered the strips of fish. My thumb was pulsing like a heartbeat by then, and the gauze was an ugly reddish brown. Wudn't lookin' forward to unwrapping it later.  

That's when I realized—I hadn't heard the taps yet. Maybe the salt had fixed it. Maybe it had been a bayou spirit, coming to taunt me. Some tai-tai looking to make trouble. Shit, maybe it was Kooshma. Or the rougarou. Swamp ain't got no shortage of boogeymen.

I tried to shrug it off and finish fixin' supper, but the anticipation of hearing those taps kept me tense like a mooring line during a hurricane—ready to snap at any moment. The absence of them was almost just as unsettling. By the time the food was ready, I could barely eat.

That night, I laid there in the darkness and waited for them. Breath held, mind racing, heart thumping. 

They never came.

Sleep didn't find me easy. I was up half the damn night tossin' and turnin'. Trying to listen. Trying to forget about it. The thoughts were eatin' me alive, and my body was struck with fever. Sweat seeped out from every pore, soaking my hair and burning my eyes. And my thumb hurt so bad I was 'bout ready to get up and cut the damn thing off. 

I rested my eyes for what felt like only a second before that orange beam cut through. My body was stiff. Felt like a damn corpse rising up. I looked down at my hand and realized I'd forgotten to change the bandage the night before.

""Fuck!"" 

The whole hand was swollen and starting to turn purple near the thumb. I hobbled over to the head, trembling. As soon as I unwrapped the gauze, the smell of rot hit the air instantly. The edges of my wound had turned black, and green ooze cracked through the thick crust of yellow every time I moved it. I was gonna need something stronger than alcohol. But I couldn't afford no doctor.

I went over to the closet, grabbed the hurricane lamp, and carried it back to the head with me. Carefully, I unscrewed the top, bit down on a rag, then poured the kerosene over my hand, dousing the wound. It fizzed up like Coke on a battery when it hit the scab. As it mixed with the pus and blood, it let out a hiss—the infection being drawn out. 

My whole body locked up as the pain ripped through me. Felt like a thousand fire ants chewin' on me at once. I bit down on that rag so hard I tore a hole through it. Between the fumes and the agony, I nearly passed out. But, it had to be done. Left the kerosene on there 'till it stopped burning, then rinsed off the slurry of brown foam that had collected on my thumb. 

With the hard part over with, I smeared a glob of pine resin over the cut, then wrapped it back up real tight with fresh gauze and tape. That outta do it, I thought. 

At least the taps seemed to be gone for now, and I could focus on handling my business. Goes without sayin', didn't need the coffee that morning, so I got myself dressed and headed out front to start my day. 

I took a deep breath, pulling the thick swamp air into my lungs. It didn't settle right. I scrunched my eyebrows. There was a smell to it—an odor that didn't belong. Something *unnatural*. Couldn't quite put my finger on what exactly it was, but I knew it wudn't right. That's for damn sure. 

Salt line was left untouched, though. Least my barrier was working. I bent down to pull in the trotline, and just before I got my hands on it, a bubble popped up from the water, just under where I was standing. A huge one. And then another, and another.

Each bubble was bigger than the last, like something breathin' down there. As they popped, a stench crept up into the air, hittin' me in the face like a sack of potatoes. That smell...

""Poo-yai. *La crotte!*"" 

It was worse than a month's old dead crawfish pulled out the mud. So thick, I could taste it crawlin’ down my throat. I backed away from the edge of the deck, covering my face with my good hand. Then, the damn phone rang, shattering the silence and makin' me just about shit.

The bubbles stopped. 

I stared at the water for a second. Smell still lingered—the pungent musk of rot mixed with filth. After the fourth ring, I rushed inside to shut the phone up. 

""Hello?"" I breathed, more as an exasperated statement rather than a greeting.

""Cherie!"" an old, crackly-throated voice said. 

""Oh, hey there, Mrs. Maggie. How ya doin'?""

""I'm makin' it alright, child. Hey, listen—Kenny around?""

I sighed.

""No, Maggie. He's still missing.""

""Aw, shoot. Well... tell him I need some help with my mooring line when he gets back in. Damn things 'bout to come undone.""

""Okay, I'll let him know. You take care now, buh-bye.""

I hung up the phone, shaking my head. Mrs. Maggie Wellers was the old lady that lived up the river from me. Ever since ol' Mr. Wellers dropped dead of a heart attack last year, Maggie's been, as we call down here, *pas tout la*. Poor thing only had a handful of thoughts left rattling around in that head of hers—grief took the rest. The loss of her husband was just too much for her, bless her heart.

Her son, Michael, had been a past lover of mine. T-Mike, they called him. He and I saw each other for a while back in high school, till he up and disappeared,  too. After graduation, he took off down the road and ain't no one seen him since. Guess I got a habit of losin' men to the bayou. 

Me and Maggie stayed in touch over the years—couldn't help but feel an obligation. She was just trying to hold onto whatever piece of her boy she had left. Kenny even started helping her out with things around the houseboat once ol' Wellers kicked the bucket. Looked like now we'd both be fendin' for ourselves from here on out.

By the time I got back out to the trotlines, the stink had almost dissipated. My thumb was still tender, but the pine resin had sealed it and took the sting out. Enough playin' around—time to fill up the ice chest. 

I went to pull at the line, but it didn't budge. 

""What the fuck?""

Maybe it was snagged on a log. I yanked again, hard, and nothin'. Almost felt like the damn line was pulling back—maybe I'd hooked something too big to haul in. I planted my feet, wrapped the line around my hands twice, then ripped at it with all my might. 

Suddenly, the line gave way, and I went tumbling backward onto the deck.

I landed hard on my tailbone, sending a shockwave up my spine like a bolt of lightning. When I lifted my head up and looked over at the line, I slammed my fist onto the wood planks and cursed into the wind. My voice echoed through the basin, sending the egrets up in flight. 

Every single hook was empty. All my bait was gone—*taken*. The little bit of line I had left had snapped, leaving me only with about four feet's worth. Fuckin' useless.

The bayou was testing me at every turn. I almost didn't wanna get up. Thought I might just lie there, close my eyes, and let it take me. Couldn't do that, though. I still had shit to do. I took a deep breath, pulled myself back onto my feet, and flung the ruined line back into the water. 

I went out to the back deck, prayin' for crabs. Only had four traps left, and I'd be doing real good to catch two or three in each one. Water was a little warmer than it had been in the past week or two, so I had high hopes. Shoulda known better. 

Empty. Ripped apart and shredded all to hell. Every single goddamn one of them. Didn't even holler that time. I laughed. I threw my head back and cackled into the face of the swamp. 

The turtles shot into the water. The cicadas screamed. The bullfrogs began to bellow, the toads started to sing, and a symphony of a thousand crickets vibrated through the cypress trees.

Then, the bayou suddenly fell silent. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I 'bout jumped right outta my skin. And then, a fiery rage tore through my body like a jolt of electricity. I stomped back three times with the heel of my boot, slamming it down against the deck so hard it nearly cracked the brittle wood holding me up. 

""Oh, yeah? I can do it too, motherfucker! Now what?!"" 

I was infuriated. I stood there, breathing heavy, fists balled up—just waiting for it to answer me. A few seconds passed, then I heard it again. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

But it was further away this time, toward the back of the house. 

""Goddamn son of a bitch... IT’S ON THE MOVE!""

And then the thought dawned on me: maybe it wudn't comin' from underneath like I thought. Maybe it was comin' from inside the houseboat. 

I ran in like a wild woman and started tossin' shit around and tearin' up the whole place, looking for whatever the fuck was tapping at me. Damn nutria rat or a possum done crawled up and got itself stuck somewhere. Who knows. Didn't matter what kinda swamp critter it was. When I found it, I was gonna kill it. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I pulled everything out of the cabinets and the pantry. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I cleared out all the closets and under the bed.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I flipped the sofa and Kenny's recliner. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

Each time they rang out, it was coming from a different spot in the house. I was 'bout ready to get the hammer and start rippin' up the floorboards. But by that time, the sun was gonna be settin' soon. I'd wasted a whole 'nother day with this bullshit, and I was still no closer to finding the source of that incessant racket. Least my thumb wudn't bothering me no more. 

I gave up on my search for the night and went to the deep freezer. Only one pack of shrimp left and a bag of fish heads for bait. I pulled both out to start thawin’. With my trotline ruined and all my traps torn to pieces, I needed to go out and set up a few jug lines so I'd have something to eat the next day. Wudn't gonna be much, but a couple fiddlers was better than nothin'. 

About an hour had passed with no tapping, but I knew it wudn't really gone. My heart was pounding somethin' fierce and I couldn't take the silence no more. I turned on the radio and started blasting Creedence Clearwater Revival through the speakers while I gathered up some empty jugs and fashioned me some lines. I had to hurry, though—that orange glow was already creepin' in. 

Finished up just as the twilight was fading. Now I'd just have to bait the hooks, throw 'em out, and hope for the best. I picked the radio up and brought it back inside with me. Whether it was taps or silence, didn't matter. I was gonna need to drown it out. 

I decided to start supper first. By then, my stomach was growlin' at me like a hound dog. I put a pot of grits cookin', then went to the pantry to get a can of tomatoes to throw in there, too. Least I had plenty dry goods on hand. And Kenny's last bottle of Jack. 

I bobbed my head to some Skynyrd while I drank from the bottle and stirred the grits. I tried to ignore it, but I could feel those taps start vibratin' up from the floorboard through my feet while I was cleaning the shrimp. 

After I seasoned them, I put them to simmering in the sauce pan with the tomatoes and some minced garlic. Then, I turned the fire off the grits and covered the pot. I took a deep breath. Time to go handle up on my business. Hopefully supper would be ready by the time I was done.

I dumped the fish heads into a bucket and set it down by the front door while I turned on the deck light. Then, I went out front to set the jug lines. 

As soon as I stepped out onto the deck, something stopped me in my tracks. The salt line had been broke. A huge, muddy, wet smear draped across it, ‘bout halfway up to my door. My heart sunk. And then, I heard a noise. But it wudn't the taps. This time, it was... different.

A *hiss.*

I slowly turned. There was somethin' hanging onto the side of my boat, peering just over the edge from the water. 

I dropped the bucket of fish heads on the deck and the blood splattered across my bare legs. 

It was Kenny. 

Only... it wasn't. His eyes pierced through the night like two shiny, copper pennies. His skin was a dark, muddy green, completely covered in hundreds of tiny bumps and ridges. Long, yellowed nails extended from his short, thick fingers, curling to a sharp point at the ends. They dug deep into the wood, tiny splinters peeling around them as he clung to the side of the houseboat.

""No,"" I whispered. ""*Fils de putain...* it's you, Kenny.""

He recoiled in a violent snap, slithering into the black water with a loud splash. The wave rocked the houseboat, nearly tipping me over the edge. 

I ran back inside, slamming the door shut and locking it behind me. My chest heaved as I gasped for air. There was no mistaking it. He'd come back. My eyes shot across to the galley—I needed a weapon. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

""Fuckin' stop it, Kenny!!"" 

Right as I got my hand on the knife, the houseboat began to shift, like something tryin' to pull down one side, and the damn thing went flyin' out of my hand. I stumbled forward and grabbed onto the kitchen counter as the whole boat slowly started to tilt toward starboard. 

The cabinets flew open and my Tupperware scattered all across the floor. Food went slidin' off the stove, and the bottle of Jack hit the ground and shattered. The motherfucker was tryin' to sink me. I opened up the galley window and shrieked, 

""Get the hell off my boat, you goddamn couyon!!"" 

A hand shot up from the darkness, wrapping its slimy, thick fingers around the pane of my window. Those yellow claws sunk deep into the wood below, like a hot knife in butter. I swallowed hard. He wudn't tryin' to pull me down, he was tryin' to come inside.
 
The boat slammed back down as he shot up from the murky swamp and lunged through the window. I was thrown backward into the mess of hot grits and glass, knocking my head against the floor. In a split second, he was right on top of me. 

My husband, Kenny Thibodeaux, now a monster. A reptilian abomination. A grotesque mixture of man and beast—both, but neither. The swamp had taken him. 

He wrapped his massive, slimy fingers around my throat, poking his claws into my skin. Then, he leaned in closer. My heart flopped in my chest like a brim caught in a bucket. He was cold. He was angry. And he was *hungry.*

Slowly, the corners of his mouth pulled back into a smile, revealing a row of razor sharp teeth dripping with black sludge. *That smell.* His hot breath hit me like an oven as he opened his mouth to hiss,

""Hey, Cherie... Did ya miss me?""

His grip around my neck began to tighten. I could feel the blood starting to drain from my face. This was it—he was gonna kill me. 

I turned away. I didn't want his ravenous gaze to be the last thing I saw before I left this world. When I did, I noticed the knife sitting there on the floor... right next to me. 

I smiled, then turned back to look straight into the orange glow of his copper penny eyes. I slowly reached my arm out, wrapped my fingers around the handle, then choked out, 

""Yeah, Kenny. I was hopin' you'd come back soon.""





It's been about a month now that Kenny's been gone. Such a shame they never found him. Got a freezer full of meat now, though. Good enough to last all winter. 

'Bout time for Sheriff Landry to bring back my damn pirogue. Ain't no evidence left to find. Besides, I'm gonna have to make a trip into town soon—runnin' low on cigarettes. Might as well try to find me a new man down there, too, while I'm at it. Always somethin' on this old houseboat needs fixin'.

And, hell... would ya look at that? It's almost Halloween. Maybe I'll pick me up a witch hat and a new broom at the dollar store. That outta be festive. All in all, life ain't too bad out here in the swamp. 

But every once in a while, when the bayou is still and the frogs are quiet, I can still hear the faintest little

1nn8in9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Better_Pea_3455/comments/1nn8in9/my_ex_is_stalking_me/,My ex is stalking me,"I broke up with him over the summer. We weren’t compatible plus we came from completely different backgrounds, and no matter how much we tried to make it work, it just didn’t feel right. It ended, and I thought that was it. But when the university year started again a few weeks ago, things started to feel... off. I didn’t attend uni for the first two days. A close friend of mine, who also happens to be his friend, did. She told me he completely ignored her when I wasn’t there, didn’t even say hello. But the moment I came back, he changed. He suddenly became bubbly and friendly with her again, jumping into our conversations, even when he wasn’t invited. It was obvious he was trying to get my attention, inserting himself wherever he could. The next day, I tried to return the cheap Valentine’s gift he gave me. I told him I wanted nothing to do with it anymore, and that the other option was just to throw it in the trash. He refused to take it back, telling me “It holds memories” and that if I threw it away, he’d have to give back the silver ring I got him. I didn’t care. I threw it away anyway. Another time, I was heading to a nearby coffee shop with a friend to grab something and come right back. He tagged along uninvited. As we were walking, he kept inserting himself between us. When I sped up, he did too, just to stay close to me. I didn’t even notice how obvious it was until my friend pointed it out later that afternoon. When we returned to uni, I went upstairs to grab something from class. He followed me. We were alone. He sat awkwardly on his phone, pretending to be distracted, then suddenly asked if we could stay friends. I gave him a cold, unclear response. I wasn’t interested in reconnecting. I needed space. Still, he closed the door behind us. I felt suffocated. Later, I was sitting in class next to another girl, someone who didn’t know we had dated. Out of nowhere, she asked if something had happened between me and him. Confused, I said no and asked why. She told me she had noticed him staring at me a lot not once or twice, but constantly, in class and outside. She also pointed out that when I returned to uni, he only greeted me and ignored the rest of the group. It was strange. She wasn’t the only one who noticed. Other friends started saying the same thing; that he always showed up wherever I went, that it looked like he was listening in on our conversations, and that he never took his eyes off me. That’s when it hit me: he might be stalking me. Every time I went to sit with my friends, he was already there. Every time we were alone in the classroom, he shut the door and started talking about himself or some personal problem, like I owed him empathy. I made it clear I wanted nothing to do with him, but he never listened. He’d talk about taking Xanax or going to therapy, but to me, it only made it seem like he was using his mental health to manipulate guilt. Like he wanted me to feel bad for leaving. My friends and I even planned to avoid him altogether. We came up with a strategy to exclude him from our usual coffee shop hangouts. One couple (mutual friends) told him I wouldn’t be there and that they just wanted some time alone. Somehow, he still showed up. He had two cheaper coffee shop options right by campus, but he chose the one he knew we were going to. It felt deliberate; like he came just to see if we were lying to him. He sat right next to me and didn’t speak. Only listened whenever I talked. And then today, everything came crashing down. I was looking for my favorite jewelry and couldn’t find it anywhere. That’s when I remembered something strange: just this week, when I came home, some of my belongings were in places I don’t remember leaving them. My vanity drawer was wide open. Mind you I NEVER leave it like that. I brushed it off at the time, but now I can’t. Because the only things missing are the items that mean the most to me. He didn’t come to uni that day. He knows where I live.He’s been to my home. And maybe, just maybe… he made a copy of my key without me noticing. The things that were taken weren’t random. Not my money. Not my mom’s gold. Not even my own gold. No electronics. No valuables. Just: ⁃	My favorite necklace: the one I almost never take off. ⁃	The silver ring: the one he once wrapped in paper when its stone fell out. ⁃	And the ring my best friend gave me. He knew what those pieces meant to me. He knew they were irreplaceable — tied to memory, love, and identity. Not just jewelry, but parts of me. Tomorrow I’m checking the building’s security footage. It’s Sunday today, and the guy who handles it doesn’t work weekends. I’m praying. Honestly, BEGGING that it’s not him. That this is all in my head. That it’s some weird misunderstanding. But deep down, I know this isn’t just a coincidence. Everything fits too perfectly. Every little moment adds up. And yet I still find myself asking: Am I crazy? Please, tell me I’m not. Your friend needs some advice on what to do in this situation. I’m talking… very subtle and serious advice. Please. I’m desperate.",1,1758501661.0,u_Better_Pea_3455,0,1.0,False

My last relationship was two years ago and since then, I've been out of the dating scene due to my career and fear of another messy breakup. I don't have much social media either, and being a workaholic and natural homebody, I'm not really going to bars.

Ive come to the conclusion that I need to get myself out there and try this again. I'm really looking for real companionship and love. 

Some stuff about me: I'm 32, white, 5'8"", long dark curly hair, dark blue eyes and wear glasses. I take care of myself and have impeccable hygiene. I work out four times a week and keep myself in really good shape. Been told by many that I'm handsome. Personality wise, I'm pretty quiet and reserved, with some nerdy interests and topics I can blab about under the right circumstances.

I work in Manhattan for a well known tech company and currently live in Suffolk County. Well off financially and also financially savvy. I trade stocks often and have made a healthy nestegg for myself. I live on my own in a condo.

Hobbies wise I'm into a lot to keep busy. I'm a tech nerd and like to build computers and play PC games. I love RPGs, FPS games, some moba stuff (recently got into Deadlock) and others. I love vintage electronics, especially stereo equipment and old computers. I am also a big music fan who listens to just about everything (rap, r&b, rock, metal, classics, some jazz). I repair electronics as a hobby and enjoy restoring equipment when I can. I love to cook, making myself meal prep, and would love to cook you a delicious meal for a date night. I'm also an avid reader, I love sci-fi, some fantasy and non fiction. Currently collecting tons of books and vinyl records. Big on thrifting in general.

I'm looking for the following:

25-35, Woman, height/weight proportional (sorry, not into bigger women). Financially independent. Beautiful in your own way and confident to offset my shyness is a huge plus. Located in NYC or Long Island. Looking for someone to grow with and trying for long term. Some similar interests and hobbies would be great,  but I'm happy with chill vibes on the couch, watching a TV or movie while cuddling... Dinner and Movie Dates are lovely as well.

Send me a chat here if you're interested. Please send a picture at some point and will do the same. Happy to arrange a date or to grab coffee before taking anything further. ",0,1758501362.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False

Alt text: Professional business people in a boardroom setting., Bahrain’s GDP grew 3.8% year-on-year in Q1 2025, outstripping regional expectations despite oil market fluctuations (Reuters). The Economic Development Board (EDB) confirms that 2025 saw foreign direct investment hit $1.3 billion, with tech and manufacturing driving expansion.\
Importantly, the government doubled down on compliance modernization. The digital Sijilat platform now auto-validates more documents, while MOICT introduced stricter anti-money laundering (AML) checks in March 2025 (bahrain.com). Tamkeen has launched new SME support schemes, making Bahrain’s landscape both competitive and closely regulated.\
The Core of Maintaining Good Standing: What Does It Really Mean?\
Staying in good standing in Bahrain is more than paperwork. It’s about meeting regulatory, tax, and licensing obligations—and being seen as a responsible, value-adding part of the business community. Companies out of standing face account freezes, fines, or even criminal penalties under 2025’s updated Company Law.\
What “Good Standing” Entails (And What Can Trip You Up)\
\
Annual commercial registration (CR) renewal via Sijilat\
Maintaining updated corporate records and license information\
Timely submission of audited financial statements (Keylink’s accounting overview)\
Compliance with LMRA labor and immigration rules\
Adherence to VAT and tax filing deadlines (even “zero-rated” must file)\
Proper AML/KYC protocols—especially after March 2025's regulatory update\
\
Recently, I watched a competitor’s trading license get suspended due to a missed Sijilat notification about document expiry—an avoidable mistake. My takeaway? Diligence pays.\
Choosing the Right Business Structure: Foundations for Compliance\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.: Popular for SMEs. Requires two or more shareholders; can be 100% foreign-owned for many activities (see full options).\
* Single Person Company (SPC): Simplest; ideal for solo founders.\
* Branch Office: Ties you directly to a foreign parent, with strict annual reporting.\
* BSC (Bahrain Shareholding Company): Higher capital; needed for certain regulated sectors.\
* Free Zone Entity**: No customs, easy logistics—great for regional distribution (free zones explained).\
For a detailed breakdown and comparison, see Keylink’s guide to Bahrain business type structures.\
My tip: Always verify ownership options against the latest official government source before signing contracts. Activities like real estate or legal consulting still require a Bahraini partner.\
The Step-by-Step Process: Maintaining Good Standing From Day One\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation. Practices\
- Use the Sijilat portal: submit core documents (MOA, tenancy contract, director passports).\
- Insider tip:** The Sijilat branch at Bahrain Bay processes applications fastest between 8-10 AM.\
- Triple-check your tenancy contract details—tenancy mistakes cause 70% of delays, especially for Seef and Diplomatic Area offices.\
2. Timely License Renewals & Annual Filings\
\
Set digital reminders one month before CR and municipal license expiry.\
Upload annual financials—engage a reputable provider for accounting services to ensure no missed filings.\
2025 update: As of April 1, late CR renewal incurs a BHD 100 penalty (was BHD 50).\
\
3. Labor Market and Immigration Compliance\
\
Register all staff with the LMRA. Always update work visas before Ramadan, when government offices reduce hours.\
Tamkeen wage subsidies and LMRA green channel processing now require strict on-time reporting.\
\
4. Tax, VAT & AML Compliance\
\
Even if VAT-exempt, submit “nil” returns every quarter.\
Ensure proper AML (Anti-Money Laundering) documentation, especially if handling client funds.\
2025’s new eKYC system now links Sijilat, LMRA, and banking data for real-time flagging.\
\
5. Keep Communication Lines Open\
\
Respond promptly to all Sijilat and MOICT notifications.\
Attend majlis-style business mixers; local relationship-building can save your reputation in a regulatory crunch.\
\
(Believe me, one missed WhatsApp from a licensing officer nearly cost me a contract. An apology delivered with a box of local dates smoothed things over—priceless.)\
Ownership and Sponsorship: Navigating Foreign Participation\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.\
* For banking, law, or real estate, local sponsorship may be required. Local sponsorship details\
* Company law revisions in 2025 increased monitoring of nominee structures; beneficial owner declarations are now mandatory.\
A UAE business friend spent weeks setting up a free zone LLC in Dubai, only to be restricted from onshore business. Bahrain, by contrast, let me open my doors in both Seef and Manama, with almost no barriers.\
Cost Considerations: 2025 Pricing, Smart Budgeting, and Avoiding Pitfalls\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.: BHD 300-1,200/month\
- Annual License Renewal: BHD 100-350 (updates in 2025—see Bahrain company formation cost)\
- Audited Financials: BHD 600-2,000/year\
- Visa & LMRA Fees: BHD 250-550 per work visa\
- Bookkeeping/Compliance (outsourced):** BHD 50-150/month\
Surprisingly, many founders forget to budget for mandatory insurance or municipality taxes (approx. BHD 120/year for most offices).\
Time and Money-Saving Tips\
\
Opt for coworking spaces in Bahrain Bay for fast tenancy approvals.\
Prepare MOA in both English and Arabic—Sijilat sometimes requests both, and notaries in Diplomatic Area can translate same-day.\
Avoid peak month (September) for CR renewals—queues at MOICT can triple.\
Outsource payroll and VAT filing to a local specialist to avoid fines and free up your time.\
\
When I first set up my fintech venture, I underestimated renewal costs. I later used Keylink’s online calculator to create a 12-month expense projection—no more nasty surprises.\
Compliance Requirements: Avoiding the Red Flags\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation. require instant shareholder address verification.\
* Store all receipts and contracts for 5 years—even cancelled ones, per BHD Central Bank edict.\
A recurring slip-up: founders using personal bank accounts for business. Bahrain’s Central Bank now cross-checks CRs against bank data, flagging mismatches instantly. Remedy: Open a business account at a recognized institution and use only CR-linked cards.\
Insider Insights: Local Customs, Landmarks, and Networking\
\
The best time to file paperwork? Early morning at Bahrain Bay’s Sijilat—officers are alert, queues are short, and local lawyers often mingle.\
During Ramadan, government offices close earlier; bring patience and arrange meetings post-iftar for stronger rapport.\
Accepting coffee (gahwa) at majlis-style meetings isn’t optional—it’s an important trust signal.\
\
One tangent: I once attended a business lunch where the conversation veered into pearl diving history—a favorite Bahraini pastime. Odd, perhaps, but that local history lesson opened doors with a government client who valued my effort to understand Bahrain’s heritage. Never underestimate cultural connection.\

Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)\
\
Missing renewal deadlines (set two calendar reminders and subscribe to SMS alerts via Sijilat)\
Relying on non-translated documents\
Using residential addresses for commercial tenancy (strictly prohibited since January 2025)\
Ignoring random audit requests—respond within 2 business days\
Overlooking post-formation requirements, especially for VAT and labor compliance\
\
Prevention: Engage a trusted advisor early, make document templates, and treat every interaction with authorities as a relationship-building opportunity.\
Bahrain vs. UAE/Saudi: The Competitive Edge\
Bahrain requires less paperwork than Saudi, and offers true 100% foreign ownership in most sectors, unlike many UAE free zones. Plus, setting up a “real” onshore business lets you access the GCC market with minimal hassle. Regulatory processes are faster, and the government genuinely supports entrepreneurship—a difference you’ll feel the first time you walk into EDB’s offices in Manama.\
FAQ: Bahrain Company Formation & Compliance\
How long does it take to set up a company in Bahrain?\
Typically, a straightforward WLL or SPC can be ready in 1-2 weeks with proper documents. Complex regulated activities may take up to 4 weeks. See step-by-step guide here.\
What are the key annual compliance tasks?\
Renew your Commercial Registration, update licenses, submit annual audits, file annual tax/VAT returns (even if zero-rated), renew LMRA registrations, and keep all documents current. More details: accounting and bookkeeping requirements.\
How can I ensure my company stays compliant with 2025’s regulations?\
Use digital tools for reminders (the Sijilat portal is indispensable), subscribe to MOICT updates, work with a recommended local consultant, and always maintain current records for every shareholder and director.\
Can foreigners really own 100% of their company in Bahrain?\
For most sectors, yes. See the full list of foreigner-friendly activities and ownership overview.\

1nn8chd,https://i.redd.it/no5o5hdt2mqf1.jpeg,I live alone in a houseboat on the bayou. Something’s been tapping at the hull at night.,"
It's been about a month now that Kenny's been gone. Three weeks and five days to be exact. He left in his pirogue one night just after sunset to go frogging and never came back. Man just up and disappeared like a fart in the wind. Now, it's just me out here on this old houseboat, alone. 

The law found the pirogue a week later, hung up on a cypress knee. No oar, no frogs, no Kenny. Just a dozen crushed-up Budweiser cans and half a pack of Marlboro Reds. Only thing is, Kenny didn't smoke. 

They had it towed back in, and I haven't seen the damn thing since. Kept it for '*evidence*', Sheriff Landry said. So, now I'm stuck out here. Unless I wanna trudge through fifty miles or so of isolated swampland—and Kenny left with the one good pair of rubber boots we had.

Search only went on for a couple more days after that. To no avail, of course. After that much time in the bog, you don't expect to find a body. At least not intact. They called it off on the first of October. My husband, Kenny Thibodeaux, presumed dead, but still officially considered a missing person. 

Some said the gators musta got him. Some thought he ran off with another woman. Some had, what I'll just call, other theories. But no one in the Atchafalaya Basin thought it was an accident. 

Hell, I ain't stupid. I know exactly what they all whisper about me. It's all the same damn shit they been saying since I was a youngin'. 

*Jezebel. Putain. Swamp Witch.*

Ha, let 'em keep talking. Don't bother me none. Not anymore. You gotta have real thick skin out in the bayou or you'll get tore up from the floor up. Me? I can hold my own. But no one comes around here anymore. Not since Kenny's been gone.

Up until a few nights ago, that is. 

I was in the galley, de-heading a batch of shrimp to fry up, when I heard it.  

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I froze with the knife in my hand. Wudn't expecting visitors; phone never rang. Maybe Landry was poking around with more questions again. I set the knife down onto the counter next to the bowl, then crept over to the front window to peek out. 

As I squinted through the dense blackness of the night, I saw something. Out on the deck, was the faint outline of a large figure standing at the edge. But it wudn't the sheriff. 

My heart dropped. I stumbled backward from the window in a panic and ran for the knife on the counter. My fingers wrapped around the handle and,

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

The sound pulsed through the floorboards beneath my feet. Sharp, like the edge of a knuckle hitting a hollow door. I lifted the knife, shrimp guts still dripping from the edge of the blade. Then, I took a deep breath and flipped the deck light on.

Nothin'. 

I paused for a moment, scanning what little area was illuminated by the dim, flickering yellow light. No boats. No critters. No large dark figures. Just a cacophony of cicadas screaming into the void, and the glimmering eyes of all the frogs Kenny never caught. 

I shut the light back off and threw the curtains closed.

""*Mais la.*""

My mind was playing tricks on me. At least that's what I thought at the time—must've just been a log bumping into the pontoons. I shrugged it off and went back to the shrimp. De-veined, cleaned, and battered. I chucked the shrimp heads out the galley window for the catfish, then sat down and had myself a good supper.

Once I'd picked up the mess and saved the dishes, I went off to get washed up before bed. After I'd settled in under the covers, I started thinking about Kenny. 

He wudn't a bad man. Not really. Sure, he was a rough-around-the-edges couyon with a mean streak like a water moccasin when he got to drinking. But he meant well. I turned over and stared at the empty side of the bed, listening to the toads sing me to sleep.

The light of the next morning cut through the cabin window like a filet knife through a sac-à-lait. I dragged myself up and threw on a pot of coffee. French roast. I had a feeling I'd need the kick in the ass that day. 

I sat on the front deck, sipping and gazing out into the morning mist, when I heard the unmistakable sound of an outboard approaching. I leaned forward. It was Sheriff Landry. He pulled his boat up along starboard and shut the engine off. 

""Hey Cherie, how you holding up?""

""I'm doin' alright. How's your mom and them?"" 

""Oh, just fine,"" he chuckled. ""Mind if I get down for a second? Just got a couple more questions for ya.""

""Allons,"" I said, gesturing for him to come aboard. ""Let me get you a cup of coffee.""

""No, no, that's okay. Already had my fill this morning."" 

I nodded. He stepped onto the deck with his hands resting on his belt and shuffled toward me, his boots click-clacking against the brittle wood. 

""Now, I'm not one to pry into the personal affairs between a husband and his wife, but since this is still an ongoing investigation, I gotta ask. How was your relationship with Kenny?""

I took a long sip, then set the mug down. 

""Suppose it was like any other, I guess."" 

""Did you two ever fight?""

""Sometimes,"" I shrugged. 

He paused for a beat, then spat out his wad of dip into the water. 

""Were y'all fighting the night he came up missing?""

""Not that I recall.""

""Not that you recall. Hmm. Well, I know one thing,"" he said, turning to look out into the water. ""There's something fishy about all this. Man didn't just disappear—somethin' musta happened to him.""

I took a deep breath. 

""Sheriff... I wanna know where he's at just as much as y'all do.""

""That so?""

He smiled, and I folded my arms in front of me. 

""Funny thing is, Mrs. Thibodeaux, you ain't cried once since Kenny's been  gone."" 

A cool breeze kicked up just then, sending the knotted-up seashells and bones I used as a wind chime clanging together. He looked over at it with a hairy eyeball. 

""With all due respect, Landry, I do my cryin' alone. Now, can I get back to my coffee? Got a lot to do today. Always somethin' needs fixin' on this old houseboat."" 

He tipped his hat and shot another stream of orange spit over the side of the deck, then got back in his boat and took off.

Day flew by after that. Between baiting and throwing out the trotlines, setting up crab traps, and replacing a rotten deck board, I already had my hands full. But then, when I went to scrape the algae off the sides of the pontoons, I found a damn leak that needed patching. 

There was a small hole in the one sitting right under the galley. Looked like somethin' sharp had poked through it—too sharp to be a log.  Maybe a snapping turtle got ahold of it, I thought. Ain't never seen one bite clean through metal before, though. 

Before I knew it, the sun was goin' down, and it was time to start seein' about fixin' supper. No crabs, but when I checked my lines, I'd snagged me a catfish. After I dumped a can of tomatoes into the cast iron, I put a pot of rice cooking to go with my coubion. I was in the middle of filleting the catfish when I heard it again. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I jerked forward, slicing a deep gash into my thumb in the process.

""*Merde!* Goddammit to hell!"" 

It was damn near down to the bone. I grabbed a dish rag and pressed it tight against my gushing wound, holding my hands over the sink. The blood seeped right through. Drops of red slammed down against the white porcelain with urgency, splattering as they landed. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I winced and raised my head to look out the galley window. Nothing but frog eyes shining through the night. 

""What in the fuck is that noise?!"" I shouted angrily to an empty room. 

Just crickets. The frogs didn't have shit to say that time. 

I checked the front deck, of course, but wudn't nobody out there. Then, I hurried over to the head to get the first aid kit, bleeding like a pig and cussin' up a storm the whole way. Once I'd cleaned and bandaged up my cut, I went back into the galley, determined to finish cooking. 

I threw the catfish guts out the galley window, ate my fill, then went to bed. Didn't hear it again that night. Ain't nothing I could do about it right then anyway—Kenny left with the good flashlight. I was just gonna have to investigate that damn noise in the daytime. Had to be *somethin’* down there in the water tapping at the hull...

The next morning, I woke up to my thumb throbbin'. When I changed the bandage, let me tell ya, it was nasty—redder than a boiled crawfish and oozing yellowish-green pus from the chunk of meat I'd cut outta myself. The catfish slime had gotten into my blood and lit up my whole hand like it was on fire. 

*Damn... musta not cleaned it good enough.*

I scrubbed the whole hand with Dawn, doused the gash with more rubbing alcohol, then wrapped it back up with gauze and tape. Didn't have much more time to tend to it than that; I had shit to do.

First order of business (after my coffee, of course) was checking the traps and lines. The air smelled like a storm coming. Deep freezer was getting low on stock, and I was running outta time. A cold spell was rippin' through the bayou, and winter was right on its ass. 

I blared some ZZ Top while I started hauling in. One by one, I brought up an empty trap, still set with bait. It seemed only the tiny nibblers of the basin had been interested in the rotten chicken legs. Until I pulled up the last trap—the one set closest to the galley window. 

Damn thing was mangled. I'm talkin' beat the hell up. Something had tore clean through the metal caging, ripping it open and snatchin' the bait from inside. I slammed the ruined trap onto the deck in frustration. 

""Damn gators! Motherfucker!""

I stared down at the tangled mess of rusty metal. Maybe that's what's been knocking around down there, I thought.  Just a canaille, overgrown reptile fucking up my traps and thievin' my bait. 

Still, something was gnawin’ at me. The  taps—they seemed too measured. Too methodical. And always in sets of three. Gators, well... they can't count, far as I'm aware. 

Had a little more luck on the trotlines. Not by much, though. Got a couple fiddlers, another good-sized blue cat, and a big stupid gar that got itself tangled up and made a mess of half the line. Had to cut him loose and lost 'bout fifty feet. The bastard thrashed so hard he just about broke my wrist, teeth gnashin' and snappin' like a goddamn bear trap. 

Of course my thumb was screaming after that, but I didn't have time to stop. I threw the catch in the ice chest and re-baited the rest of the line I had left. After that, it was time to figure out once and for all just what the hell was making that racket under the hull.

I went around to the back to start looking there. Nothing loose, nothing out of place. I leaned forward to look over the side.

Then, I heard a loud splash.

I snapped back upright. The sound had come from around the other side of the houseboat. I ran back through the cabin out onto the front deck. 

""Aw, for Christ's sake.""

Ice chest lid was wide open—water splattered all over the deck. I approached slowly and looked inside. Fiddlers were still flapping at the bottom. But that big blue cat? Gone. Damn thing musta flopped itself out and back into the water. Lucky son of a bitch.

No use in cryin' about it, though. I was just going to have to make do with what I had left. I closed the lid back and shoved the ice chest further from the edge with my foot. When I did, I noticed something. 

On the side that was closest to the water, there was something smeared across it. I blinked. It was a muddy handprint. A big one. Too big to have been mine. 

""Mais... *garde des don*.""

I bent down to look closer. It wasn't an old, dried-up print—it was fresh. Wet. Slimy. Still dripping. My heart dropped. I slowly stood back up and looked out into the water. First the tapping, now this? Pas bon. Somethin', or somebody, was messing with me. And they done picked the wrong one. 

I went inside and grabbed the salt. Then, I stomped back out and started at one end, pourin' until I had a thick line of it all across the border of the deck.  

""Now. Cross *that*, motherfucker.""

I folded my arms across my chest. Bayou was still. Air was silent and heavy. The sun began to shift, peaking just above the tree line and painting the water with an orange glow.

For about another hour, I searched that houseboat left, right, up, and down. Never found nothin' that would explain the tapping, though. I dragged the ice chest inside to start cleaning the fish just as the nighttime critters started up their song.

Figured I could get the most use out of the fiddlers by fryin' 'em up with some étouffée, so I started boiling my grease while I battered the strips of fish. My thumb was pulsing like a heartbeat by then, and the gauze was an ugly reddish brown. Wudn't lookin' forward to unwrapping it later.  

That's when I realized—I hadn't heard the taps yet. Maybe the salt had fixed it. Maybe it had been a bayou spirit, coming to taunt me. Some tai-tai looking to make trouble. Shit, maybe it was Kooshma. Or the rougarou. Swamp ain't got no shortage of boogeymen.

I tried to shrug it off and finish fixin' supper, but the anticipation of hearing those taps kept me tense like a mooring line during a hurricane—ready to snap at any moment. The absence of them was almost just as unsettling. By the time the food was ready, I could barely eat.

That night, I laid there in the darkness and waited for them. Breath held, mind racing, heart thumping. 

They never came.

Sleep didn't find me easy. I was up half the damn night tossin' and turnin'. Trying to listen. Trying to forget about it. The thoughts were eatin' me alive, and my body was struck with fever. Sweat seeped out from every pore, soaking my hair and burning my eyes. And my thumb hurt so bad I was 'bout ready to get up and cut the damn thing off. 

I rested my eyes for what felt like only a second before that orange beam cut through. My body was stiff. Felt like a damn corpse rising up. I looked down at my hand and realized I'd forgotten to change the bandage the night before.

""Fuck!"" 

The whole hand was swollen and starting to turn purple near the thumb. I hobbled over to the head, trembling. As soon as I unwrapped the gauze, the smell of rot hit the air instantly. The edges of my wound had turned black, and green ooze cracked through the thick crust of yellow every time I moved it. I was gonna need something stronger than alcohol. But I couldn't afford no doctor.

I went over to the closet, grabbed the hurricane lamp, and carried it back to the head with me. Carefully, I unscrewed the top, bit down on a rag, then poured the kerosene over my hand, dousing the wound. It fizzed up like Coke on a battery when it hit the scab. As it mixed with the pus and blood, it let out a hiss—the infection being drawn out. 

My whole body locked up as the pain ripped through me. Felt like a thousand fire ants chewin' on me at once. I bit down on that rag so hard I tore a hole through it. Between the fumes and the agony, I nearly passed out. But, it had to be done. Left the kerosene on there 'till it stopped burning, then rinsed off the slurry of brown foam that had collected on my thumb. 

With the hard part over with, I smeared a glob of pine resin over the cut, then wrapped it back up real tight with fresh gauze and tape. That outta do it, I thought. 

At least the taps seemed to be gone for now, and I could focus on handling my business. Goes without sayin', didn't need the coffee that morning, so I got myself dressed and headed out front to start my day. 

I took a deep breath, pulling the thick swamp air into my lungs. It didn't settle right. I scrunched my eyebrows. There was a smell to it—an odor that didn't belong. Something *unnatural*. Couldn't quite put my finger on what exactly it was, but I knew it wudn't right. That's for damn sure. 

Salt line was left untouched, though. Least my barrier was working. I bent down to pull in the trotline, and just before I got my hands on it, a bubble popped up from the water, just under where I was standing. A huge one. And then another, and another.

Each bubble was bigger than the last, like something breathin' down there. As they popped, a stench crept up into the air, hittin' me in the face like a sack of potatoes. That smell...

""Poo-yai. *La crotte!*"" 

It was worse than a month's old dead crawfish pulled out the mud. So thick, I could taste it crawlin’ down my throat. I backed away from the edge of the deck, covering my face with my good hand. Then, the damn phone rang, shattering the silence and makin' me just about shit.

The bubbles stopped. 

I stared at the water for a second. Smell still lingered—the pungent musk of rot mixed with filth. After the fourth ring, I rushed inside to shut the phone up. 

""Hello?"" I breathed, more as an exasperated statement rather than a greeting.

""Cherie!"" an old, crackly-throated voice said. 

""Oh, hey there, Mrs. Maggie. How ya doin'?""

""I'm makin' it alright, child. Hey, listen—Kenny around?""

I sighed.

""No, Maggie. He's still missing.""

""Aw, shoot. Well... tell him I need some help with my mooring line when he gets back in. Damn things 'bout to come undone.""

""Okay, I'll let him know. You take care now, buh-bye.""

I hung up the phone, shaking my head. Mrs. Maggie Wellers was the old lady that lived up the river from me. Ever since ol' Mr. Wellers dropped dead of a heart attack last year, Maggie's been, as we call down here, *pas tout la*. Poor thing only had a handful of thoughts left rattling around in that head of hers—grief took the rest. The loss of her husband was just too much for her, bless her heart.

Her son, Michael, had been a past lover of mine. T-Mike, they called him. He and I saw each other for a while back in high school, till he up and disappeared,  too. After graduation, he took off down the road and ain't no one seen him since. Guess I got a habit of losin' men to the bayou. 

Me and Maggie stayed in touch over the years—couldn't help but feel an obligation. She was just trying to hold onto whatever piece of her boy she had left. Kenny even started helping her out with things around the houseboat once ol' Wellers kicked the bucket. Looked like now we'd both be fendin' for ourselves from here on out.

By the time I got back out to the trotlines, the stink had almost dissipated. My thumb was still tender, but the pine resin had sealed it and took the sting out. Enough playin' around—time to fill up the ice chest. 

I went to pull at the line, but it didn't budge. 

""What the fuck?""

Maybe it was snagged on a log. I yanked again, hard, and nothin'. Almost felt like the damn line was pulling back—maybe I'd hooked something too big to haul in. I planted my feet, wrapped the line around my hands twice, then ripped at it with all my might. 

Suddenly, the line gave way, and I went tumbling backward onto the deck.

I landed hard on my tailbone, sending a shockwave up my spine like a bolt of lightning. When I lifted my head up and looked over at the line, I slammed my fist onto the wood planks and cursed into the wind. My voice echoed through the basin, sending the egrets up in flight. 

Every single hook was empty. All my bait was gone—*taken*. The little bit of line I had left had snapped, leaving me only with about four feet's worth. Fuckin' useless.

The bayou was testing me at every turn. I almost didn't wanna get up. Thought I might just lie there, close my eyes, and let it take me. Couldn't do that, though. I still had shit to do. I took a deep breath, pulled myself back onto my feet, and flung the ruined line back into the water. 

I went out to the back deck, prayin' for crabs. Only had four traps left, and I'd be doing real good to catch two or three in each one. Water was a little warmer than it had been in the past week or two, so I had high hopes. Shoulda known better. 

Empty. Ripped apart and shredded all to hell. Every single goddamn one of them. Didn't even holler that time. I laughed. I threw my head back and cackled into the face of the swamp. 

The turtles shot into the water. The cicadas screamed. The bullfrogs began to bellow, the toads started to sing, and a symphony of a thousand crickets vibrated through the cypress trees.

Then, the bayou suddenly fell silent. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I 'bout jumped right outta my skin. And then, a fiery rage tore through my body like a jolt of electricity. I stomped back three times with the heel of my boot, slamming it down against the deck so hard it nearly cracked the brittle wood holding me up. 

""Oh, yeah? I can do it too, motherfucker! Now what?!"" 

I was infuriated. I stood there, breathing heavy, fists balled up—just waiting for it to answer me. A few seconds passed, then I heard it again. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

But it was further away this time, toward the back of the house. 

""Goddamn son of a bitch... IT’S ON THE MOVE!""

And then the thought dawned on me: maybe it wudn't comin' from underneath like I thought. Maybe it was comin' from inside the houseboat. 

I ran in like a wild woman and started tossin' shit around and tearin' up the whole place, looking for whatever the fuck was tapping at me. Damn nutria rat or a possum done crawled up and got itself stuck somewhere. Who knows. Didn't matter what kinda swamp critter it was. When I found it, I was gonna kill it. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I pulled everything out of the cabinets and the pantry. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I cleared out all the closets and under the bed.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I flipped the sofa and Kenny's recliner. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

Each time they rang out, it was coming from a different spot in the house. I was 'bout ready to get the hammer and start rippin' up the floorboards. But by that time, the sun was gonna be settin' soon. I'd wasted a whole 'nother day with this bullshit, and I was still no closer to finding the source of that incessant racket. Least my thumb wudn't bothering me no more. 

I gave up on my search for the night and went to the deep freezer. Only one pack of shrimp left and a bag of fish heads for bait. I pulled both out to start thawin’. With my trotline ruined and all my traps torn to pieces, I needed to go out and set up a few jug lines so I'd have something to eat the next day. Wudn't gonna be much, but a couple fiddlers was better than nothin'. 

About an hour had passed with no tapping, but I knew it wudn't really gone. My heart was pounding somethin' fierce and I couldn't take the silence no more. I turned on the radio and started blasting Creedence Clearwater Revival through the speakers while I gathered up some empty jugs and fashioned me some lines. I had to hurry, though—that orange glow was already creepin' in. 

Finished up just as the twilight was fading. Now I'd just have to bait the hooks, throw 'em out, and hope for the best. I picked the radio up and brought it back inside with me. Whether it was taps or silence, didn't matter. I was gonna need to drown it out. 

I decided to start supper first. By then, my stomach was growlin' at me like a hound dog. I put a pot of grits cookin', then went to the pantry to get a can of tomatoes to throw in there, too. Least I had plenty dry goods on hand. And Kenny's last bottle of Jack. 

I bobbed my head to some Skynyrd while I drank from the bottle and stirred the grits. I tried to ignore it, but I could feel those taps start vibratin' up from the floorboard through my feet while I was cleaning the shrimp. 

After I seasoned them, I put them to simmering in the sauce pan with the tomatoes and some minced garlic. Then, I turned the fire off the grits and covered the pot. I took a deep breath. Time to go handle up on my business. Hopefully supper would be ready by the time I was done.

I dumped the fish heads into a bucket and set it down by the front door while I turned on the deck light. Then, I went out front to set the jug lines. 

As soon as I stepped out onto the deck, something stopped me in my tracks. The salt line had been broke. A huge, muddy, wet smear draped across it, ‘bout halfway up to my door. My heart sunk. And then, I heard a noise. But it wudn't the taps. This time, it was... different.

A *hiss.*

I slowly turned. There was somethin' hanging onto the side of my boat, peering just over the edge from the water. 

I dropped the bucket of fish heads on the deck and the blood splattered across my bare legs. 

It was Kenny. 

Only... it wasn't. His eyes pierced through the night like two shiny, copper pennies. His skin was a dark, muddy green, completely covered in hundreds of tiny bumps and ridges. Long, yellowed nails extended from his short, thick fingers, curling to a sharp point at the ends. They dug deep into the wood, tiny splinters peeling around them as he clung to the side of the houseboat.

""No,"" I whispered. ""*Fils de putain...* it's you, Kenny.""

He recoiled in a violent snap, slithering into the black water with a loud splash. The wave rocked the houseboat, nearly tipping me over the edge. 

I ran back inside, slamming the door shut and locking it behind me. My chest heaved as I gasped for air. There was no mistaking it. He'd come back. My eyes shot across to the galley—I needed a weapon. 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

""Fuckin' stop it, Kenny!!"" 

Right as I got my hand on the knife, the houseboat began to shift, like something tryin' to pull down one side, and the damn thing went flyin' out of my hand. I stumbled forward and grabbed onto the kitchen counter as the whole boat slowly started to tilt toward starboard. 

The cabinets flew open and my Tupperware scattered all across the floor. Food went slidin' off the stove, and the bottle of Jack hit the ground and shattered. The motherfucker was tryin' to sink me. I opened up the galley window and shrieked, 

""Get the hell off my boat, you goddamn couyon!!"" 

A hand shot up from the darkness, wrapping its slimy, thick fingers around the pane of my window. Those yellow claws sunk deep into the wood below, like a hot knife in butter. I swallowed hard. He wudn't tryin' to pull me down, he was tryin' to come inside.
 
The boat slammed back down as he shot up from the murky swamp and lunged through the window. I was thrown backward into the mess of hot grits and glass, knocking my head against the floor. In a split second, he was right on top of me. 

My husband, Kenny Thibodeaux, now a monster. A reptilian abomination. A grotesque mixture of man and beast—both, but neither. The swamp had taken him. 

He wrapped his massive, slimy fingers around my throat, poking his claws into my skin. Then, he leaned in closer. My heart flopped in my chest like a brim caught in a bucket. He was cold. He was angry. And he was *hungry.*

Slowly, the corners of his mouth pulled back into a smile, revealing a row of razor sharp teeth dripping with black sludge. *That smell.* His hot breath hit me like an oven as he opened his mouth to hiss,

""Hey, Cherie... Did ya miss me?""

His grip around my neck began to tighten. I could feel the blood starting to drain from my face. This was it—he was gonna kill me. 

I turned away. I didn't want his ravenous gaze to be the last thing I saw before I left this world. When I did, I noticed the knife sitting there on the floor... right next to me. 

I smiled, then turned back to look straight into the orange glow of his copper penny eyes. I slowly reached my arm out, wrapped my fingers around the handle, then choked out, 

""Yeah, Kenny. I was hopin' you'd come back soon.""





It's been about a month now that Kenny's been gone. Such a shame they never found him. Got a freezer full of meat now, though. Good enough to last all winter. 

'Bout time for Sheriff Landry to bring back my damn pirogue. Ain't no evidence left to find. Besides, I'm gonna have to make a trip into town soon—runnin' low on cigarettes. Might as well try to find me a new man down there, too, while I'm at it. Always somethin' on this old houseboat needs fixin'.

And, hell... would ya look at that? It's almost Halloween. Maybe I'll pick me up a witch hat and a new broom at the dollar store. That outta be festive. All in all, life ain't too bad out here in the swamp. 

But every once in a while, when the bayou is still and the frogs are quiet, I can still hear the faintest little

I know Americans started drinking coffee more over tea after their feud with the British empire, and coffee has sort of become one of the iconic traits of America but that's just almost 3 centuries ago.

1nn83fs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1nn83fs/things_ive_learned_in_my_first_year_of_marriage/,Things Ive learned in my First Year of Marriage,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share my experience after being married for a year. I’m going to preface this with that no two marriages look alike and these are just things in my experience that I’ve noticed.

My husband spent a good portion of our marriage at sea so we were long distance. I wouldn’t say it challenged our marriage as so much as made it stronger. But there are definitely things we experienced that made it harder just by being apart.


1. Always communicate with your spouse, if you leave things unsaid it leaves room for resentment to grow and rot between the couple. Talk about your days. When “how was your day?” Seems to hit a brick wall what we did was a version of rose, petal, thorn at the end of each day. Something good about our day, something bad or we didn’t like about our day, and something random we just wanted to share. This has opened up a lot of conversations between us and connected us a lot more and made us closer.

2. Initiate intimacy, no matter your role in the relationship. And always do aftercare. Dont fall into your phones and immediately disconnect, cuddle and talk about the experience.

3. Some things are just not worth fighting over. Agree to disagree. This is different for every couple but there were just some things we learned about the other person that are just part of who they are and it’s best to accept it and not try to persuade them otherwise. It saves you alot of headaches. For example my husband likes to fold shirts and put them in drawers and I like to hang mine. I tried hanging his up and he just didn’t like it. So we put our clothes away how we each like to. Another example is that I have always wanted a cat and my husband has never liked cats. But the cat distribution system blessed me with a kitten while he was deployed and he said I could keep it because he saw how happy she made me. Does he now like cats? Yes. Will we be getting more? Yes. Does my cat hit him any chance she gets? Also yes.

4. Don’t keep secrets that could come out and harm your marriage in the long run. Personally, don’t keep secrets at all. Nothing good comes from it and you should be able to tell your partner everything.

5. Assume good intent. If a fight spikes from a miscommunication or anything at all, remember it’s you and your partner vs the issue, not you vs your partner.

6. Respect their rituals. I always have a cup of coffee before I do ANYTHING to start my day. My husband learned the hard way what happens when I don’t have my coffee. My husband on weekends has to have an energy drink and read the news for a bit before he’s up to do anything during the day.

7. Dont stop flirting!!!! Just because you’re married doesn’t mean the fun has to stop! Makeout like teenagers, send them flirty texts, call them pretty/hamdsome, ask them out! Keep your spark alive.

8. Don’t lose each other through boring times. We just spent a year apart and then finished planning our wedding ceremony (we had a courthouse wedding privately and are now having a bigger one for family) routine will become monotonous. Continue to do fun things together, watch a show together, do a puzzle, have a couples bookclub, go on dates, join a dnd campaign etc.

9. Make sure your goals are clear. Do you want kids or not? If so when? Do you have a savings goal? A career goal? Do your paths look similar? If your life goals are vastly different you need to discuss them preferably before you tie the knot. Same thing with discussing values.

10. While you are a team, enjoy your own activities too. We enjoy doing our own things in the same space. I’ll work on my book while he plays video games and we check in on each other periodically. If I’m going out I leave making sure he doesn’t feel left out and most time he doesn’t since we have our own friend groups.


I hope some of these help anyone who just got married! I’m only 23 and I have a long marriage ahead of me and I’m sure there will be many bumps down the road. Let me know what works for you as well!",5,1758500457.0,Marriage,4,1.0,False

Shouldn't drag, should be fun and good for both parties. I'm not interested if you're not and you shouldn't be interested if I'm not, either. 

Not so secretly hoping for: Someone who sticks. I wish I talked less, and wasn't so myself so early on. I usually find myself throwing my guts at brick walls like someone checking to see if their spaghetti is ready. (I've actually never done this, just taste test the noodle, you coward) The metaphor works nonetheless, yeah? 

Things about me that I like: I'm really good at talking, so good, you're gonna wanna take a backseat and let me take the wheel. (don't though, please also be good at talking) I'm really good at cooking, appreciate and have weird preferences. I think food is a good way to get to know someone. We all have to eat and I hope you did so today. I'm pretty sharp. In all kinds of ways: My chin, mind and the words I say. You'll like it or you won't, I guess that's okay. I'm aware enough to know I \*could\* change it. I guess I don't want to. Or maybe I'm scared to. Who knows (you don't) I have really good taste in movies. I don't watch that many but I'm pretty good at picking what I will watch when I feel like it. I'm artsy, creative and, a little odd. It'd be neat to draw with someone sometime. I'm trying to find myself in that again. I've made work my personality for far too long. 

The basics: I'm an optician, not happy with the state of the world, find solace in doom scrolling and dinner with friends or some people peeping at the local coffee shop. Only child, single, have a dog, have fantastic taste in furniture and t-shirts. A closeted cry-baby.

There is something for everyone here - you can get drunk in 500b at some cheap 70B beer bars or choose to blow money 10 times more, the very next night! 

Smoke some brocolli at 10am or have iced coffee during the same time, just another world only. Limitless options. 
Also, met some beautiful tourists with some great conversations! 

Wild story-
On my second last night, I was with a local Thai girl getting back to my hotel and dropped my phone in the tuk tuk at 4am! She and I then successfully managed to call and trave it back and the tuk tuk driver gave my phone back at the place he dropped us in 25 mins! ( Yes, I was stupid. Yes I was drunk)

Right after we got the phone back, we juned across the street to a massage parlor to reward us each with a foot massage at 4.30 am 🙂 and made love till 8.30am to snuggle in till 2pm at my hotel. 

I must admit, Thai girls and other locals are the sweetest specially when you respect them and be polite to them. It just makes everything much happier. Good karma takes you a long way in Phuket! (And Thailand in general)

I've just began my third year as a sociology major but in my time here I haven't been able to make a single friend. I've tried connecting with roommates but they either already had their own clique or were a bad experience and singled me out. I've tried joining clubs, talking to classmates, talking to coworkers, even going to parties, but it doesn't go anywhere. If I'm lucky maybe I'll have a classmate to talk to in lecture and maybe we even share social media handles. But we never hangout outside of class and as soon as the quarter is over I never talk to them again. I even try to initiate hangouts but they never respond or leave me hanging.

I know I'm introverted and kind of awkward and weird. And maybe it was doomed from the start for me to go to a party school as a non party girl. But I really do try talking to others but it seems like everyone already has their own group.  

At first it didn't bother me as much since I'm used to being on my own, but now it being my third year I'm afraid of it being just like the last two and I really can't stand being alone anymore. It's honestly getting really hard having absolutely no friends and being away from family. All I really want is just one person to be nice and hangout with me. I've even debated about dropping out because of how bad it's been and how much it's affected my mental health. 

Is anyone else struggling with horrible loneliness?  If you're someone who maybe doesn't party a lot, enjoys coffee and matcha, books, rom coms, trinkets, shopping, fitness  or are just another weird person looking to find their space please don't hesitate.

1nn7g6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nn7g6i/i_found_a_bunch_of_student_projects_for_a_school/,I Found a Bunch of Student Projects for a School That I Don’t Think Exist,"I teach Freshman English at the local university. Not exactly a prestigious gig. People hear “professor” and assume you’re pulling six figures, but adjuncts don’t get that luxury. I make less than a grand per class, and I teach two a semester—if I’m lucky. It’s enough to pay rent without roommates or side hustles.

The one thing that *is* nice, though, is how supportive the community around teaching can be. There are entire forums and websites dedicated to helping college instructors cobble together a half-decent syllabus. You can find everything: reading lists, scaffolded assignment plans, and sample grading rubrics. Hell, the *New York Times* even sells a ready-made course calendar if you’re phoning it in.

Lately, I’ve been digging through educator forums trying to find writing prompts that are weird or engaging enough that my students *won’t* just plug it into ChatGPT.  Part of that process involves browsing examples of student work that other instructors have shared online—usually to showcase how a particular assignment engages with course objectives. The identifying details are stripped out, of course; what’s left is just the work itself. You’re meant to look at how the student responded to the prompt, how the assignment fostered critical thinking or multimodal literacy, that sort of thing.

That’s how I came across what I’ve started calling the “Student Works.”

They were posted like examples, links buried in old discussion threads, sometimes with broken preview thumbnails or “archived” tags. Just one after another: PDF portfolios, zipped folders, embedded galleries, a few Vimeo passwords still live. Most of them were stripped of identifying information, like proper examples should be.

At first, they looked like the usual multimodal assignments. You know the type: podcasts stitched together from borrowed audio clips, half-finished photo essays, the kind of mini-documentaries English departments like to assign so freshmen feel like they’re “participating in the discourse.” But these were… wrong. Off in a way that prickled at me the longer I stared. It’s hard to explain to anyone who hasn’t spent hours combing through student work, most of what students make is clumsy but earnest, but these projects didn’t carry the marks of inexperience. They weren’t fumbling toward ideas; they seemed to know exactly what they were doing. Every image was too deliberate, every sound too carefully chosen, every line of text polished in a way no freshman is capable of achieving.  And beneath that polish, there was something else—something I can only describe as *intent*. 

I know I sound like a crazy person, and maybe if you’ve never seen student works, I sound like I am freaking out over some edgy content. But trust me, these projects weren’t for *any* course I recognized. The content was beyond edgy; it was disturbing. Deep web type stuff (or what I assume you could find there). If these were meant for some sort of course, then it’s loaded with dense, incomprehensible artistic theory, some teaching method I have never been exposed to.  It's like someone had taught a film seminar on *fever dreams* and *disassociation*. A few had no title or context at all. Like fragments of a movie made up of broken sound and flashing clips coming through static. 

I need to be clear about something before I go any further: I’m not sharing links. I don’t even know if I could find them again, and if I did, I’m not convinced it would be legal—or safe—to post them here. Some of what I stumbled into looked like it should’ve been locked away in a police evidence folder, not floating around an old teaching forum. But I can’t just sit on this, either. I need to tell someone what I saw, if only to make sense of it myself. So instead of the files, I’m going to describe them, as best I can. 

  
The first file I opened was a video. The folder labeled it plainly enough: student\_projects/video/33\_late\_night\_host.mp4.

I thought it would be a satire or some art school skit. A mock talk show, maybe, or a media studies final. What it actually was… I don’t know what it was. I’ve shown it to no one.

The footage begins already mid-roll. A group of three people—two men and one woman—stand in the center of what appears to be an abandoned film set. It’s all shadows and scaffolding beyond the frame, but they’re caught in a single harsh spotlight. A giant studio bulb dangles above them, casting everything else in deep, oily black. The camera quality is bad, grainy, smeared, VHS-level fidelity. It makes what happens so much harder to watch. 

They're all smiling. Not just smiling—**beaming.** Their teeth look too white, too big, stretched across waxy, pallid skin. One of the men is tall, looming over the others with the posture of someone who’s used to being looked at. A kind of game show host charisma but hollowed out. The other two nod along and clap intermittently, like extras cued by some unseen stage manager.

They hiss to each other in some glottal, phlegmy language. Guttural and wet, like someone gargling glass. I thought maybe it was fake—some kind of made-up dialect. But it doesn’t feel like a performance. It feels like a ritual.

Then a figure is wheeled into the frame. A man, maybe mid-twenties, slumped in a wheelchair. His head lolls back, mouth ajar, eyes half-lidded like he’s sedated. I paused the video here the first time and didn’t go back for a week.

When I finally resumed, I noticed how animated the trio became. They lean toward him like he’s a guest of honor. One claps and stamps their feet in excitement. The tall one crouches beside the wheelchair and begins “interviewing” the guest—still in that viscous, foreign tongue. Every so often, the woman laughs explosively, slapping his knee and pointing at the camera. It’s all silent but for them. There's no crew. No audience.

Then the second man—he’d disappeared offscreen earlier—returns holding a dented metal bucket. Inside it: something white, something slick, something moving. Maggots, I thought. Or eels. But they writhe like they have purpose. Too thick for worms. Too fast for grubs.

The tall host claps. So does the woman.

She moves behind the unconscious man, lifts his chin, and pries his mouth open.

That’s when he wakes up.

His eyes shoot wide. He thrashes in the chair—**strapped down**—and starts screaming. English now. “No, no, please! Stop! Don’t—” But the bucket is already being tipped forward.

The things inside pour into his mouth.

I watched the whole thing. I wish I hadn’t, but I did. The camera lingers as they crawl across his lips, his face, his clothes. His muffled cries are swallowed along with the parasites. His body shakes.

Then silence.

The woman clamps his jaw shut, pinches his nose. The others start some kind of countdown. Their language is still incomprehensible, but the rhythm of it is unmistakable—**a performance** for the viewer.

When she lets go, the man raises his head. Smiles.

His mouth is full of white pulp. The creatures cling to his gums. His skin is pale and damp. But his eyes—his eyes are calm.

He looks directly at the camera and nods.

Everyone applauds. The video ends.



I shouldn’t have watched that entire thing. I closed the file, shut my laptop, made a coffee I didn’t finish, and still couldn’t stop thinking about the way they smiled at the camera like they’d already agreed to it. For the next twenty-four hours, I tried to remain rational—I ran reverse searches on the file name, pulled the metadata (which was almost nonexistent), and chased every breadcrumb I could find back through dead forums and archived directories. A few of the broken links and stray citations pointed to a name I didn’t recognize, Arrowridge—and then to something that reads like a bad typographical echo: Marrowridge University. All my poking around the internet yielded no results for either university or any other scholastic program with that name.

So I’m asking you: am I being trolled? Did someone stage this as an art piece so elaborate and gross I can’t tell performance from evidence? Or is this something that should be reported to the police? I don’t know. I do know I can’t stop looking. I’ll describe another project if anyone is interested or can help me make heads or tails of this. But it's creeping me the fuck out, I don't know if I want any more to do with it.

I just moved to El Paso about 3 weeks ago and have mostly been hiking (very familiar with Hueco Tanks, Franklin Mountains, and the surrounding areas) and volunteering at the animal shelter + Catz at the Zoo. I’ve also been hanging out at 787 Coffee a lot.

I’m 26F, hoping to meet some new people and make friends while I’m here. A little about me:
	•	I love rock climbing (been to Sessions already)
	•	Currently training for the Flying Horse Half Marathon
	•	Into yoga and wellness
	•	Big fan of parks and being outside
	•	Collect vinyls, CDs, and cassettes (love physical media + music)
	•	Enjoy thrifting & antiquing, photography, museums, and authentic flea markets

I’m not looking for food or hiking recommendations this time (I like finding those on my own). What I’d really love are ideas for unique experiences, events, shops, spots, and hidden gems that locals know about. For example, I just found out about a renfest happening next weekend in NM and “Brews at the Zoo” coming up here in El Paso. I was also recommended Game Vault (not my usual thing but so excited for this rec!) and plan to check it out today.

I’m really open to trying out anything, even things outside my usual interests. So if there are festivals, events, community gatherings, or fun niche activities or spots El Paso is known for, I’d love to hear about them. And if anyone’s into similar things, I’d be glad to meet up with some fellow girlies and make some new friends!

It’s been a little while since my last post, and I thought I’d update you all on the website.



I had been meaning to get around to it for a while, but I was getting behind in my studies and I couldn’t let this video feed lead me astray.



First off, I’d like to provide my reasoning for continuing to keep tabs on this website. Even if this website is not a work of unfiction, I believe it is important for someone to document the events that have occurred. I mean, if this is some kind of stalking incident then wouldn’t it be best for evidence to be collected? Hopefully I will be able to provide a complete history of the site through these posts.



Anyway as I mentioned at the end of the last post, the cameras have been following someone new. I’ll start by telling you about the morning of the switch.

At that time, the cameras had been continuing through the same cycle, following the absent man’s usual route. Because of this, I gradually checked on it less and less; the itching feeling I had previously felt between viewings was gradually subsiding into a quiet, but persistent, confusion. After a couple days of not even looking at the website, I got another message.



Him: “check the site”



I tripped over my feet as I made my way to my computer.



I opened up the page but, as the bars of pixels lit up in descending order, changes became immediately apparent.

First, the quality of the video was significantly improved. Not exactly to the quality of a movie, or even an old sitcom, but markedly clearer than the smudge of an image that I had become familiar with. There was now color; hazy shades of tans and whites that distorted into random hues at the ends of fluorescent lights.

Next, instead of the parking lots and alleyways I was accustomed to, there was tile flooring and plaster walls. There were some potted plants, a front desk with a receptionist, and a man looking at some papers. Several other people walked by in dress shirts and sensible heels, off to fax machines and busywork I can only assume.

Lastly, as the man finished whatever he was doing and walked off, the camera switched, now not only displaying a hallway, but also the most important change. The same man was walking, checking his phone as he gradually made his way.

This was the new target.



Me: “How long since it switched to this place?”

Him: “about 15 minutes”

Him: “he was in a parking garage then walked to this building”



The man passed another metal desk, stopping for a moment to search his pockets, then opened the door.

The camera switched again, now revealing a moderately sized, adequately furnished office. He sat down, booted up his computer, and leaned back in his chair. He remained there for the rest of the time that I watched.



\------------------------------



I got back on the website towards the end of his work day after a call from my grandmother. I’ve been trying to reconnect with my grandma since her trip to the hospital. We were really close when I was a kid, but things became complicated as I got older as many things do.

I had also promised myself that if the video started again I would be more discerning with my time. The higher-ups likely wouldn’t be happy with me putting my life on hold to watch a stranger wander around.



He was just finishing his business and got up to leave. As he did, the cameras reversed their order from that morning: the metal desk outside his office, now manned by a dark-haired woman, the hallway, and the front lobby. They then made their way to new scenery - a sidewalk, and a parking garage. He found his car in a parking spot near the entrance, then got in.

As he did, the camera shifted to a view of the inside of his car. This shocked me more than it maybe should have, but given that the previous victim had stayed outdoors the majority of his time, the close view of the man from the shoulders up, turning on his car, was a novel one. This was the clearest image of either of the subjects I had ever seen.

He looked middle-aged, tired, his hair a little out of place. His clothes were nice though; a recently pressed gray suit.



I stared at this man for about 10 minutes, taking in every detail I could; watching his expressions, his gestures, and his subpar driving until the image of a driveway took over the feed.



As he parked and got out of his car, I was *sure* that I would lose sight of the man. He was entering his suburban house, leaving the public square. His home ought to be the most private of places, his own holy space, veiled from the outside world by the curtains on his windows. Tsikuri did not seem to have the same reservations. Not a minute later I was viewing an entryway.



Me: “Wait, we’re in his house now?”

Him: “its just a set dumba\*\*”



His claim, though logical, was hard to fully believe, as the quality of the supposed set was very impressive. It was fully furnished with rather nice, if a little worn, furniture. The trash can was not-quite full of paper towels, boxes and wrappers. The recycling bin next to it was empty. His sink had a few dishes in it, but only a reasonable amount. I told myself that the most simple solution was that it was just the actor’s real house. On the coffee table in his living room was a photo album I would later find him looking at occasionally. Looking back it struck me as odd, as he didn’t seem like a very sentimental person. He had a lot of these kinds of contradictions.

  


The next few days went by with little to note. His job required a pretty steady routine, as one might expect. His days were uneventful, and his nights even more so; only the mindless shifting of position in his bed, and the occasional trip to the bathroom.

The only substantial change in that time was on the fourth day, when the receptionist outside his office was gone. By the next week though, there was another woman to take her place. This one was a little younger, with blonde hair that neatly fell on either shoulder.



It was around this time that my internet associate added me to a FairSeas group chat. I didn’t know any of the people in it besides him, but they were the only ones I was aware of that were following Tsikuri. I had to discuss it with someone, so I took whatever interaction I could.



I disavow any controversial opinions expressed or inappropriate language used by the people in that chat.



Me: “Do any of you guys know what’s going on?”

“no clue”

“I’ve only been watching for a few days now.”

“You didnt miss much.”

“just a hobo gettin murked”

Me: “What do you think happened to him?”

“who gives a f\*\*\*”

“That was just the preview. This guy’s the real main character I bet”

“as if this lame a\*\* show will have a plot.”



They weren’t much help.



After a few weeks, I became very acquainted with this man’s schedule. On Mondays he would talk to his computer for the first few hours of his shift, his attitude more reserved than at any other time. Tuesdays through Thursdays were indistinguishable, solely consisting of him working at his desk and occasionally meeting with his staff. Fridays usually had meetings in another room in the office building.



I’m trying to stay as neutral as possible while I’m writing this but… I don’t like this new person very much. Whenever an employee comes into his office, his attitude slowly becomes more aggressive. His wild gesticulations and the downturned expression of the workers show a tenuous relationship. The meetings usually lasted a long time as well; the miserable look of his employees doing little to calm his temper. The only person who seems safe from direct hostility is the woman working the desk outside of his office. While she doesn’t receive his unbridled wrath as consistently as the intermittent individuals, she often gets caught in the blast zone. Whenever she would poke her head in to relay some information, she seemed to consistently regret it.

When he’s not yelling at his staff, he spends a lot of time putzing around his room; straightening his desk, cleaning his shelves - I’ve even spotted him taking a nap in his chair a couple times. Another contradiction I suppose.

Outside of work, his hobbies primarily include watching movies on a television I can’t see the screen of, eating out at extravagant restaurants, and driving erratically while yelling at any person in his sight.



I know I have no right to judge him, but I can’t help but resent his behavior.



The members of the group chat don’t seem to have the exact same feelings as I do:

“D\*\*n I wish I had his job”

“I would love to f\*\*\*ing yell at people all day”

“I can’t believe that p\*\*\*\* is crying”

“geez I hope he fires that fat f\*\*\*”



Like before, the group hasn’t provided much new insight on what these videos are for, but another notable conversation happened while the man was walking from his car to a restaurant one night.



“Wait, this kinda looks like a building on my street”

“stop trying to f\*\*\* with us”

“No he’s right, the street sign says r\*\*\*\*d road”

“F\*\*\* you man”



The initial comment once again calls into question the origin of these videos. At the time I still found little reason to believe them to be non-fiction, but with no confirmation of who was putting these videos online the question still nagged at me. Hopefully someone will be able to come up with a new piece of evidence soon, though it seems like we are all equally in the dark.



Whether or not these videos are real, it makes me painfully aware of all of the many cameras that surround me every day. The lens on top of my computer burns my skin like a magnifying glass. It makes me want to stay wrapped in a blanket all day. I’ve spent my whole life in the company of a spectator; I ignored his plastic gaze for a while, but now when I have the chance to peer through these faceless eyes I’m unable to ignore it. I can’t help but think of all the innocuous things I’ve done in the pretend privacy of my room. All the words I’ve ever said. Surely there’s something that could be worthy of reprimanding.

I’ve started changing my clothes as quickly as possible, in the corner of my room farthest from my computer. I would cover the camera, but the thought of potentially bringing attention to myself is a petrifying one.



\------------------------------



One day, he left his office to use the bathroom, and, at the desk outside his office, the first receptionist was there, from the very first couple days. I had almost forgotten about her existence at this point, so her return as an actor in this film was more than enough to catch my attention. She was standing at the desk, seemingly caught mid-conversation with the new woman. The blonde one smiled nervously to the man as he spoke briefly to them. The dark-haired one had frozen in place, then after a moment ducked her head and quickly left. I wished I could follow her out of the room. I doubt that she could be as unbearable as the man I was stuck with. Unfortunately, as she left the frame of the video feed, she departed from my world.



Looking back on the past few weeks, I have pretty substantially fallen short of my goal to not let this silly website take over my life again. I made a valiant effort the first few days, but now it’s practically all I can think about. Why do I care so much about this frustrating man driving back and forth from work, going to the bathroom in the middle of the night, and making everyone around him miserable?

It’s like there’s something hypnotic about the wavering mist of pixels, like blurry raindrops covering the screen. Something in the dark shadows of the room is luring me in, telling me that if I just keep watching I’ll gain the understanding that I seek.

  


A few days later, the man was pacing around his room, having a notably unproductive day even for him. He would frequently stop by his door, seemingly peeking out at something. After about 30 minutes of this, he opened the door and called to his receptionist. She entered after a minute or so and he sat down at the desk, offering her the seat opposite his.

He spoke to her for a while, seemingly lecturing her, though in a much more reserved manner than usual. Instead of flailing about, his hands were folded on the surface in front of him.

Over time, the woman seemed to grow uncomfortable. She began fidgeting with the collar of her dark button down shirt, her legs pressed tightly together. After a few minutes, he pulled out his cell phone with a stern look on his face, and gestured for her to stand up.

She took a long pause. For a moment her eyes turned, to look at me. Not truly at me of course, but her expression, somewhere between embarrassment and desperation, felt like a condemnation.

She then reluctantly stood up, holding the collar of her shirt closed. A light on his phone flashed. He motioned for her to turn around. She hesitated even longer then slowly turned. Her legs were stiff under her pencil skirt. Another flash.

She turned back around to face him, her face hidden from view. He opened the door for her to leave, smiling and lightly grabbing her elbow as she trudged past him.



Later that day, after eating his microwave dinner in the armchair in his living room, he printed out some items from his home computer. He walked to the coffee table and picked up his photo album. He flipped through page after page, his hands caressing the smooth plastic. He licked his finger despite the glossy texture of the film, and flipped one last page. He took one of the printed items, clear now as a photograph, and impatiently jammed it between the two clear layers. It didn’t penetrate the sleeve on the first try, so he smoothly but forcefully slid it between the clear layers, wriggling it to get it all the way in. He repeated this motion with the other photos, fitting them into place until he was satisfied with the layout.



I despise this man. A lot. I have to keep reminding myself that this is all a facade, and that there was nothing I could do to punish him for his actions. I’m sure that the creators of this narrative will give him what he deserves.



\------------------------------



The next morning I was greeted by a familiar surprise. The car was back. It was across the street from his house as he left for work. It was in the parking garage as he got his things out of his car. It was there as he walked to his office building, in the corner of the video.



As he got to his office, there were two men waiting for him with his receptionist standing off to the side. She looked unwell. The man, clearly caught off guard, greeted them. They spoke to him for about 15 minutes, then left, leaving the man by himself to enter his office. He slowly sat down in his chair, his head in his hands. Then, he abruptly slammed his fists into his desk, jostling the various items lying on top of it. He punched the computer monitor, causing it to fall onto the floor. He flailed, and screamed, and punched his chair until he was out of breath.



By lunchtime, his things were packed up, and he was out of his office.

As he passed his receptionist’s desk she froze, clenching the boxes in her own hands.

  


He drove home quietly, his face twisted and inscrutable. He sat in his car for a few minutes, unmoving. He eventually got out of his car, then walked up his driveway; his pace tired and slow. After he finally made it to his door, he dropped his keys on the ground. Instead of picking them up, he collapsed, his hands scuffed on the pavement, and his pants got dirtied by the lawn. He looked exhausted; drained of all feeling.



Despite my disdain for this man, it felt cruel to watch him at his lowest point; transgressive even. I almost exited the page. To see any adult reduced to the actions of a child was deeply uncomfortable; let alone a complete stranger, a middle-aged man with some level of authority. Even though his behavior was deplorable, he was still a person. I had seen him too tired to eat breakfast. I had seen him run to the bathroom after he got home from work. I had seen him nervously waiting for a meeting with his superiors. He picked his nose in the car, fell asleep at work



I wondered how long this website would continue to thoroughly and vividly document his breakdown.

My answer came much more quickly than I had expected.



When the camera switched to the entryway of his house, he was gone.

1nn7d7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nn7d7x/caught_feelings_while_traveling_internationally/,Caught feelings while traveling internationally..,"Long story short. I’m (27F) stationed in Germany. Rode my motorcycle all the way down to Italy as a solo trip. Met a German guy who was also riding his bike solo on the summit of the mountain, dramatic sunset. I’m talking something straight out of a movie haha. I was previously in a long-term relationship about a year ago and so I had no interest in dating or hookups. But we hit it off immediately although I was hesitant and fought back feelings. He suggested we exchange numbers to plan a ride together the following day. We rode all that day, got coffee. Talked for 3hrs. Decided we wanted food. Literally closed the bar down until 1am. We didn’t even drink, literally just had food and coffee and chatted for several more hours. I headed back to my place after that and we just hugged. We stayed in touch and he offered for us to go mountains biking near his home in Switzerland. We did that, I crashed and got a gnarly cut. He swooped in, patched me up and went out of his way to take care of me. He cooked me dinner, cleaned up my bloody face and hands, etc. sat at the hospital with me the entire time holding my hand. Took off all my gear immediately to make me comfortable and wrapped me in his hoodie. I’d say I instantly caught feelings, probably from the adrenaline haha. He was very kind and respectful, slept on the couch. However we wound up sleeping together. The following weekend he planned all these amazing dates and dinners and refused for me to pay for anything. The sex was amazing. Our chemistry was strong and we never stopped talking. We planned all these trips together and how we were going to road-trip to Croatia to race a rally event together. I was so hyped, like what a catch. However, at some point we had to buy tickets for a small tour we wanted to do. It asked for my birthday information. After that I noticed he acted a bit differently. And then before I left, he said he wanted to be upfront with me. The German way of honesty. He said he would like to remain just friends. And that he’s also looking for someone to settle down with and because he wants children. And because there was a small age gap between us, but didn’t tell me his age. He seemed quite young, I’m guessing mid 30s. But he said basically until he finds that person, he wants us to continue being friends and “just having fun.” But didn’t want me to feel used.. I respected his feelings but told him I couldn’t be just friends and that I caught feelings. He understood and we’ve since stopped talking. Although he still texts me. But it sucks and I’m feeling rather lost. And frankly used. Why claim you’re looking for a serious relationship while messing around with people? It doesn’t add up. Based on the sex, I’d say he’s very experienced. He mentioned he “experimented a lot” before knowing what he wanted. And that I’m young and have so much more to do before I settle. Even though I very much want to settle. And while I agree the relationship was bound to be casual if anything, considering I’m military and he’s German. I still caught those damn feelings and feel so disappointed. I can’t say I regretted our time together but I know it’s best to cut the cord once you catch feelings",2,1758498391.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1nn7bs0,https://i.redd.it/lozrhim8ulqf1.jpeg,"“Breakfast, but make it a sandwich 🥪✨ … steam-fried in ghee so it fights back with fluff 💪🥞”","

So I went rogue in the kitchen today and ended up making the thickest blueberry pancake sandwich of my life. Here’s the chaos recipe:🫐🥞

### Pancake chaos🫐🥞

* Batter = 1 cup flour, 1 egg, splash of milk, 2 tbsp hot water, pinch of salt, lil sugar (skippable).
* Cooked in real butter/desi ghee (because flavor > calories).
* Pancakes were **thicc** (1.5 cm at least).
* Trick: only embed blueberries on *one* side. To cook the top, I sprinkled water + extra butter on the pan → kinda like steam + fry = fluffy + golden.
* Took about **5 mins per pancake** to cook.

### Quick jam hack🫐

* Same buttery pan (because why waste flavor?).
* Handful of frozen blueberries + enough sugar to coat.
* Pinch of salt.
* Smash and cook till it turns jammy (can stay chunky or go smooth).

### Assembly

* First pancake → spread blueberry jam.
* Second pancake on top, blueberry side up.
* Sprinkle brown sugar + tiny bit of coffee milk powder (trust me, it works).
* **1 min to plate and stack**.

Result: crispy edges, fluffy middle, oozy jam, and that desi ghee kick.
Would 100% make again — might even roll it next time like a dessert burrito 👀.

This seems unreasonable and I’m attempting to be better about it but I have a hard time telling when I’m either overthinking it or letting things slide. For example, I was sick and had been sick for a few days. While she was at work she asked me to make her dinner so that she can eat when she gets home. I said yes without thinking about it and was struggling the whole time, not only that but the recipe she gave me was a 2 hour recipe where I had to consistently be up and stirring for the first hour. I felt like shit and like fainting multiple times. It’s my fault for saying yes before knowing what I was getting myself into but doesn’t this seem like a bit of an excessive request to ask a sick person? I feel as if anything she should be the one making food until I’m at least feeling better.

It seems like she consistently will only do things if I ask her and maybe she expects the same out of me. I don’t want a partner like that, but if that’s normal/healthy, then I’d like to know so I can change my expectations and work on myself in that way. I also don’t want either of us to be expecting things out of each other that are unreasonable.

Is it too much to ask for a partner who makes you coffee in the morning without you asking? Or lunch while you’re working and they’re not? To take your dog out to go to the bathroom while you’re in the middle of a work call. Is it normal to have to ask for these things every day and not expect them to say “why didn’t you tell me? I would’ve done it if you asked” when it’s every day tasks that are consistent? I understand for things out of the ordinary like “can you replace my towel?” Or “can you grab me this from the grocery store?” But mundane everyday tasks feel like we should both be trying to make our lives easier with. I know I do, and typically on my days off I do everything that I said at the beginning of this paragraph, that I expect out of her, for her.

**Edit:**

Thank you to everyone who responded. I’m going to change my expectations and I really needed to hear other people say that “you shouldn’t expect that out of your partner” because therapy was of no help. All multiple therapists that I went to said was “what would make you happier?” and I kept thinking of how self centered that line of thinking was. I’m glad I asked this community and got some solid advice. I plan on asking about the coffee just because it does make me feel really loved and is a small thing to ask for, same way she asks me to put toothpaste on her toothbrush for her. I think that’s pretty fair and not egregious. Besides that, I’ll be more open about my communication and not expect her to do some of the other things I had mentioned.",1,1758498234.0,relationship_advice,16,0.99,False
1nn7aca,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1nn7aca/people_can_be_hurt_by_the_church/,People CAN be hurt by the Church,"Hey guys, to be honest, I'm not even sure what percentage of the people on this subreddit identify as Christian. I would often come here and try to leave a few posts to try and gently push some people here that may still have a bigoted mindset- One that did not have to experience the same hardships of modern Gen Z and Gen Alpha folks- Posts to help offer a different perspectives for those who feel the youngsters are going down the wrong path and show that maybe just because things are changing, doesn't mean that things are getting worse.

However, the last few posts I made had brought in some rather surprising responses.

I get people who are... Against me- Not because they are stuck in the past... For the exact opposite reason.

They essentially try to make ME trust in young people more. Make ME feel like I'm the boomer who just doesn't get it.

Here's the things guys- I'm a Gen Z like just like y'all. I'm a trans girl who has made enemies out of mega churches for standing up against their anti lgbtq behaviors.

I am On your side.

That being said... I've been pretty worried with some of the comments I've been seeing here.

People often try to tell me that I shouldn't assume someone leaves the church because they are hurt by it. That people do leave for intellectual reasons, or simply losing interest.

Let me state this very Clearly- 

""Yes. I know.""

If someone stops attending church, and you reach out to them and they say that they just weren't feeling it anymore and they'd rather sleep in on Sunday or do whatever it is else that they want to do- 

Then, Yes. Of coruse, by all means, believe them.

BUT- 

There are people out there who Do leave because they have been hurt.

They Want to come back. They want to be able to step into a church again and feel the same warmth and welcoming environment that they felt when they first attended.

They are a minority, but they Do exist. People who turned to Christ in a time of darkness, and felt a sense of community so great, that it warmed their soul in a way so intensely, that it made the moment they realized they had to leave hurt all the more.

How do I know these people exist?

Because I'm one of them.

I can easily name 4 churches off the top of my head that I would actively feel scared entering. Not bored. Not annoyed.

Scared.

Scared of someone yelling at me. Or worse- Taking me aside and telling me with a bright warm smile that I'm not longer welcome in their building.

For no reason, other than me leaving them a bad review and expressing my problems with them in the kindest way I could bring myself to.

For the people like me, all I want is for them to feel safe. To feel like someone from that old church cares about them. That maybe, if they Did come back, things would be okay. That it's possible to rebuild trust and heal old wounds.

So, if there's someone out there you know who left the church on not so great terms- Please. Reach out to them. Ask them if they're okay. If they want to have coffee sometime, or see a movie, or whatever.

Not to drag them back kicking and screaming to the church.

Simply to remind them that they still have real bonds from those old places.

They might not respond. They might tell you to screw off. If that happens, wipe the sand off your feet a move on.

But simply reaching out to someone can easily make someone's whole day.

Since September 9, I’ve been experiencing episodes of irregular heartbeats, mostly in the evening. These episodes last anywhere from 1 to 3 hours. During that time:

It feels like the heart skips a beat or hits harder, every 5 to 15 seconds

No chest pain

No dizziness, no nausea, no shortness of breath

Heart rate stays between 75–100 bpm (smartwatch)

Sometimes light activity helps (walking, playing with my dog), sometimes not

No obvious trigger — it can happen while sitting, eating, or resting



---

What I’ve already done:

Sept 10: Went to the ER — ECG was normal

2024: Had an echocardiogram, 24-hour Holter, and full bloodwork — all normal. These were done for a different issue at the time: I was having strong palpitations several times a week (not the same pattern as now).

This week: Saw a private physician — said it doesn’t seem concerning due to lack of pain or dangerous symptoms. Ordered repeat blood tests and may do 24h BP monitoring.

I’ve started a detailed log of each episode (date, duration, symptoms, heart rate, etc.)



---

Why I’m posting:

I’m not worried that something critical is being missed, but I’m frustrated by the lack of direction. The symptoms are frequent and real, and I’m just not sure what to do next.

Any feedback would help:

Could this be a benign arrhythmia that still warrants more follow-up?

Should I push for a longer Holter monitor (7–14 days)?

Anything I can try during an episode to calm things down?

Any specific terms/tests I should ask about?

1nn7984,https://www.reddit.com/r/Procrastinationism/comments/1nn7984/i_read_40_books_last_year_and_heres_what_i_learned/,I read 40+ books last year and here's what I learned,"this year I set an ambitious goal to read one book per week. I ended up finishing 44 books across fiction, non-fiction, and self-improvement genres.

Here's everything that worked, everything that failed, and the surprising lessons I learned about reading in 2024.

What DIDN'T work:

Speed reading techniques are BS. All those speed reading methods online are mostly garbage. I spent weeks trying different techniques and apps (tried several on both iOS and Android), but faster reading meant worse comprehension. Sometimes slower is actually faster.

Reading only self-improvement books. I burned out hard trying to read only ""productive"" books. By month 6, **I was forcing myself through business and self-improvement titles that felt like homework. Variety is crucial for sustained reading.**

Digital-only reading. I'm a tech person, so I started with just Kindle and reading apps on my phone. While convenient, I found myself getting distracted by notifications and other apps. Physical books kept me focused longer.

What ACTUALLY worked:

The 25% rule. If I wasn't engaged after 25% of any book, I'd quit and move on. This single rule increased my completion rate dramatically. Life's too short for boring books.

Mixed format approach

* Physical books for deep focus sessions
* Audiobooks for commutes and walks
* E-books (iOS Kindle app) for travel
* Summary apps only for books I'd already read to review key points

Genre rotation system. I alternated between fiction, non-fiction, biography, and self-improvement books. This kept reading fresh and prevented burnout from any single category.

Note-taking apps integration. I used Obsidian (available on both Android and iOS) to create connected notes between books. Linking ideas across different books created deeper understanding than reading in isolation.

Morning reading ritual. 30-45 minutes every morning with coffee before checking any apps or social media. This became a sacred time that I protected fiercely.

Podcasts as book replacements. I love podcasts and using them as content was pretty good. I especially liked it when people talked about their experience on how they applied the book.

Podcast supplementation (the right way). Instead of replacing books with podcasts, I found podcasts where authors discussed their books in detail. This reinforced learning without replacing the deep reading experience.

Reading 40+ books taught me that the goal isn't consuming more content it's building a better thinking system. The best self-improvement comes from deeply understanding fewer ideas rather than superficially knowing many. It's better to read 10 good books again and again than to read 100 books without understanding any of its principles.

For anyone starting their reading journey: **Forget the apps promising shortcuts. Get comfortable books in whatever format works for you, quit the boring ones ruthlessly, and focus on understanding over speed.**

I'm looking for my future favorite person. I want a real, long-term relationship. We can start online and see where it goes.

Me!: https://imgur.com/a/pictures-XdqmQIl

Please introduce yourself and show what you look like so I know you're real. <3

A little about me: I'm a nerdier but active person. A bit of a hopeless romantic. I value traditional things like patience, loyalty, and honesty. I'm an honors student going for my Master's in English: Creative Writing. I'm a big mental and physical health advocate. My dream is to be a fantasy author one day, to write stories and characters that help people be inspired by or find comfort in.

What I bring to a relationship: Bookstore, coffee shop, or park dates in person. Home cooked meals. Online we could have calls watching anime, talking, gaming, reading, or anything else interesting! My long-term goal is that I'm considering teaching English in Japan one day. Plus you get my game and book collections AND someone who you can rant about things to.

The woman I'm looking for: You're a kind, loyal woman who shares my values and isn't into hookup culture. You enjoy nerdy things, meaningful talks, and being best friends with their partner. I'm most drawn to someone healthy or athletic, with a sweet face and eyes I can fall for. You want a genuine bond.

Some of my hobbies are writing, gaming, cooking, anime, weightlifting, and long walks in nature. Some major game faves are Final Fantasy, Pokémon, NieR:Automata, Baldur's Gate, and pretty much any RPG. I also read (and write) fantasy! Think like Lord of the Rings, Mistborn, but also Star Wars novels. I'd love to find someone to do cosplay with, maybe a Cloud x Tifa/Aerith or something!

I'm in Indiana (EST) and open to online in the US. So if you love calm calls, shared hobbies, and want a lasting connection, please feel free to message. I mainly use discord and will be most active there if we talk. Have a good day!

I can’t imagine buyers renting out their guest suite to strangers, especially since these homes will most likely appeal to retirees looking for a new home base or a getaway house. Sure, I can see it being handy if you’ve got friends or family who want their own little retreat, but even then, is a full kitchenette necessary?

Personally, I feel like a coffee nook with a machine, kettle, and a mini fridge would have been more than enough. It would still give you that “half kitchenette” vibe where guests could make themselves a morning cuppa and enjoy a quiet moment, without taking up so much space. Instead, the full kitchenette eats into space that could have been put to better use, like extra wardrobe or storage.

Curious what others think:

* Do you see value in a full kitchenette for guests?
* Or would you rather have the extra wardrobe or storage space?
* What’s the most useful bonus feature you would actually want in a guest suite?

I’ve only known her for a few weeks, so I’m not saying I want to jump into a relationship, but I’m starting to feel something more than friendship. I’m kind of on the fence about whether or not I should make my interest in something potentially romantic clear.

We recently went on a late-night drive together in my car (around 11 PM) for about three hours. We grabbed ice cream and talked the entire time. Honestly, everything she shared about herself just made her more attractive to me — it’s a feeling I haven’t had for a woman in a long time.

We also study together a lot after class, we text pretty regularly, and she seems genuinely interested in what I have to say. On top of that, she’s done some things that kinda sound like she might be interested in me.

* She’s offered to bake treats for me
* Invited me to keep her company while she bakes/cooks at her place
* offered to come over to my place while I cook
* Asked me to go to the gym with her
* Told me she’d love to go on another night drive
* Bought me coffee

All of that seems promising. But here’s where my confusion is coming from — some of her phrasing sounds like she sees me as a friend. She’s said things like:

* “I love having friends over when I cook/bake”
* “I love baking for friends.”
* “I’ve been wanting a gym buddy.""

Im not sure if this is just how she talks, but it's making me confused but also I could just be looking to much into it.

So now I’m stuck debating whether I should express that I see her as someone I could be romantically interested in. I really don’t want to make things weird for her and me in class, but I also don’t want to suppress my feelings or let the moment pass. I know this isn't all the details, but what do y'all think about whats going on?

TL;DR

I’ve been getting close to a girl from my class — we hang out a lot, text often, and recently had a long late-night drive that felt meaningful. She’s invited me to do things like bake at her place, go to the gym, and even bought me coffee, which feels flirty. But she also uses friendly language that confuses me. I’m interested in her romantically, but unsure if I should say something or just keep it friendly to avoid making things weird.",2,1758497592.0,datingadviceformen,1,1.0,False

First of all, y’all are way kinder and chill than the ATX subreddit. Thanks for that. My husband (35, White) and I (41F, Black) are strongly considering moving to Chicago after he received a job offer there. I would really appreciate your help with narrowing down neighborhoods to consider.

We are dual income, little dog owners, thus my goofy title. Childfree.

Our estimated household income if he accepts the job will be $350k+. 
His job will be in office every day, long hours, and in West Town close to the border of Ukrainian Village (as far as I can tell). I work from home or coworking spaces with a flexible schedule—so I’m going to need to make some friends and quick!

What neighborhoods should we search in for a furnished 6-month rental while we get our bearings?

What might we be missing as we consider moving from way South Austin to Chicago? In Austin, we live way South in a completely non-walkable area, but we live near a great dog park.

Top Desires in a Neighborhood:

- if possible, within 2 miles of husband’s job in West Town on the border of Ukrainian Village (there’s a bonus for living close by)
- coworking space like WeWork or Industrious close by for me to hot desk occasionally (I’m self employed)
- great park very nearby for the dog to run and play off leash
- well-stocked grocery store close by
- very close to public transport
- ideally rent a unit that is 4 bedrooms so we can each have a home office or 3BR + finished basement + parking for 1 car

For daily life, I (41F) like:

- dining out (Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese, “Healthy,” Neapolitan Pizza), protein-y smoothies
- coffee shops, bookstores, book clubs, writing classes
- yoga and casual witchy community activities like crystals, tarot, etc.
- nerdy small business gatherings and conversations about content marketing, sales calls, team management, Meta ads, etc. (Think: reading/implementing/discussing books by the Basecamp founders, Cal Newport, or Alex Hormozi)
- having a racially diverse and politically progressive group of women friends and gay men friends who are sort of the “business-y” MBA grad type but who are also very loud and raunchy at times 
- podcasting, making Youtube videos, and listening to podcasts

He (35) likes:

- 3D printing
- mountain biking
- nerding out on home automation
- gaming with friends
- being handy, doing stuff in workshops and Makerspaces
- architecture (loved the architecture river tour!)
- talking tech and working on tech projects
- watching Youtube videos of people renovating old castles
- likes to have diverse friends who are progressive, techy, nerdy, and bikey

For daily life, we both like:

- going out to eat (Can you tell I like food?!)
- going to the movies (Alamo Drafthouse season passholders but normal cinemas work too)
- hosting friends for dinner
- being on Reddit and Lemmy and discussing what we find
- playing with our dog
- concerts with seating
- being at home
- talking about ADHD, autism, and other topics related to neurodivergence 
- We are not big drinkers, partiers, or late night folks

Shatter (Grodziskie) - Verx nothing. Has some alright aromatic and smoke taste. Better than a generic macro brew, but I would not intentionally drink this over anything else

Muy Juicy (new England IPA) - It's seeped with cammomile, which gives it some very interesting oily and tea notes. Unfortunately it's loaded with so many different hops it just has a very generic ""hoppy taste"" that doesn't swing in any direction. Still good, but like it intentionally made its taste profile ""nothing"" in hope that cammomile gimmick will make it good instead of leaning into it

Õhtu (American Porter) - Very noticable freshtaste and sweetness from the lactose. Some coffee and nutty aromas, and a pleasa tly subtle sweet vanillya finish.

1nn6zs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1nn6zs8/golan_heights_change_my_mind/,Golan Heights: Change my Mind,"So I have an opinion that I admit isn't too deeply thought out, so I'd probably be willing to change it. But it's also different from the repetitive posts on here, and likely to conflict with people on all sides, so I figured I'd share it and start a new type of discussion!

I'm a left wing Jewish citizen of Israel who is very much against the war in Gaza and the occupation, favouring an immediate move towards a Palesyinian state. BUT on the other hand I think Israel should keep the Golan Heights. 

First off, I don't much care for historical justificatioms and international law. These things are less important preserving peace and prosperity in the here and now. So when people argue over treaties signed in the previous century it really seems like a distraction to me. If someone were to prove beyond any shadow of a doubt that Israel was the legal sovereign over the West Bank, I would still support immediate withdrawal. Because when I went to the West Bank, both as a soldier and as a tourist, I saw that it was not Israeli. I had to pass a border to get there, with a sign saying Iaraelis were forbidden to enter. Nobody spoke Hebrew, people acted differently, and clearly wanted to make decisions for themselves. As a tourist I would not want anyone to evenknow I was Israeli. The whole area is kept quiet and under Israel's thumb only because tens of thousands of troops implement a huge security apparatus. People there are willing to fight and die to not be part of Israel. Hundreds if not thousands of Israelis have died in the effort to force it to be Israel. It's not Israel and makes life worse for everyone to pretend it is. How we got to this situation is to me largely irrelevant to the fact that it still creates suffering today and that's why it has to stop.

Meanwhile, in the Golan, I could easily take a bus or taxi there without passing any serious border. Military presence is minimal. Or, more accurately, they are there to watch the Syrian and Lebanese borders. You don't need soldiers to keep the populace under control and raid terrorist groups. I can go to a coffee shop and sit down and order in Hebrew and talk to people there, even if it isn't their first language. Although for some of the young people, it basically is their first language. Some of them may have misgivings about discrimination and the current rise of extreme ethnonationalists in power, but they also seem even more scared of what would happen if they went back to Syria. And the level of discrimination is more comparable to the ethnic conflicts that most democratic states have to overcome, not a horrific tragedy and continuous disenfranchisement of breathtaking scale like with Palestinians. Especially the young Druze seem to feel part of Israel at this point. In the Gokan Heights there are great hiking trails that I walked alone without any worries about safety, following standard Israeli national park formats (honestly the well-kept but still natural feeling hiking trails are one of the best parts of Israel.). There is just no feeling of it being a separate country, or a big push from the majority of people there to be one.

I get that Israel's taking of the territory was illegal, and that a hundred thousand Syrians were expelled or fled. Their villages were razed and replaced with Jewish ones. I would think Israel is perhaps obligated to offer compensation to those who had to flee or were forced to leave. Twenty years ago I would say it should have been given back, at least as part of a peace deal. But right now everything and everyone seems largely fine as it is, and that to me seems more important than trying to reverse illegal actions from 60 years ago, especially when we saw only a few months ago what horrors Druze there can expect if they returned to Syria.

Buuuuut perhaps I'm missing something and someone here could point out that I'm mistaken or being hypocritical.",3,1758497336.0,IsraelPalestine,20,0.8,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Chiefs vs. Giants: A Tale of Two Zeroes (and a Lot of Sighs)**

Ladies and gentlemen, strap in for a Sunday Night Football clash that’s less *Monday Night Football* and more *Tuesday Morning Coffee*—bitter, confusing, and best consumed with a sense of resignation. The Kansas City Chiefs (0-2) and New York Giants (0-2) meet at MetLife Stadium, where the air is crisp, the lights are bright, and the collective hope of both fanbases is about as sturdy as a Jenga tower built by a toddler. Let’s break this down with the precision of a quarterback who doesn’t throw picks… unlike these teams.

---

### Parse the Odds: When Zero Meets Zero

The article’s projection has the Chiefs edging the Giants 30-17, a line that feels less like a prediction and more like a mercy ruling. Kansas City’s Pythagorean theorem of despair includes losses to the Chargers and Eagles, while New York’s “Wilson Magic” show (450 yards, 3 TDs in Week 2) ended in overtime heartbreak against Dallas. Statistically, both teams are playing 2014-level football—Chiefs’ first 0-2 start since 2014, Giants’ first 0-2 since… well, also 2014. It’s like a time machine of futility.

The implied probabilities? Let’s math this out. If we assume the Chiefs are -200 favorites (a rough guess based on the article’s “projected to beat” language), their implied win probability is 66.7% (100/(200+100)). For the Giants (+150), it’s 40% (100/(150+100)). Combine that with Mahomes’ 98.8 QB rating vs. Wilson’s 92.3, and the Chiefs’ edge in defensive rankings (10th vs. Giants’ 24th), and the numbers lean… well, they lean toward Kansas City not being the team that loses to the Cowboys in OT.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Quips, and Russell Wilson’s “I Can Do It Alone” Tour

The Chiefs’ news is as spicy as a Mahomes’ postgame press conference: no major injuries, but their offense looks like a man trying to parallel park—a lot of honking, no progress. Travis Kelce is still catching passes, but even he might be questioning why he’s still out there. The defense? They’ve allowed 30+ points in both losses. If they were a cheeseburger, they’d be the “hold the lettuce” version—missing key elements.

The Giants, meanwhile,

I have an amazing partner. I wanted to start there because no matter how much they love me I think there will always be a gap in their understanding of how I got where I am today in how I deal with my bpd parent. 
 constant mental “handling” of a BPD parent. We are both in the south we’re both phrase to say yes ma’am no man to elders. I do it now even though I’m in my 30s however I cannot say yes ma’am to my BPD mother. I don’t know how to explain it, but you all probably understand. I grey rock essentially all the time. We help take care of her and live in the same home and boundaries are extremely important. Once I show any kind of affection sheatches on and it’s very hard for me to live my life. Something as small as saying, yes ma’am can quickly go downhill and turn into hugs and other things that give her hope that we can get coffee or go on little dates like we did growing up when I’ve made that clear we can’t do that anymore - it’s so hard to explain but I have to manage her “hope” or she’ll spiral. So I just say yes and keep it like that and help take care of her and I don’t tell her anything about my life other than the facts that pertain to her care. Believe it or not it’s working as well as it can considering. However, when company comes over and I say say ma’am to then but don’t say yes, ma’am to my mom it is really weird and he has started to tell me as much. I love him and it’s just one of those things that look weird and we have to agree to disagree on 

I was wondering, if other folks have similar stories of little things they do or big things they do they look really weird in public or in front of their partners because they still have to navigate this complexity.",6,1758496936.0,raisedbyborderlines,1,0.88,False

1nn6sp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nn6sp8/the_seagulls_are_bringing_my_mother_back_to_me/,"The seagulls are bringing my mother back to me, piece by piece by piece.","The first morning, it was a dull gray tooth, speckled with sand and smelling strongly of brine, deposited on my bedroom windowsill like a gift. I didn’t understand how it was on the *inside* of my home, given that the window had been closed and locked all night.

I tried not to think about it.

The next morning? It was a damp white clot the size of a golf-ball, with a cloudy pupil and an iris the color of moss, a lush and familiar green-brown. 

Woke up earlier that morning, before sunrise. I could still hear them - the flock. Cawing on my front lawn. Tapping along the shingles. Skittering somewhere inside my house, though it was hard to say *where* exactly. Sounded like they were in the walls, but the space was only a few inches thick. They couldn’t fit. Lying in bed, desperately pretending to be asleep, I theorized they must be in the vents, then; it’s the only hollow space they could fit in.

Some quiet part of myself knew that theory was wrong, though.

They were inside the walls.

Even if they shouldn’t be able to fit.

The third night, it was a finger, swollen with sea-rot and inflexibly straight, as if pointing, the digit severed mid-accusation. They left it for me to find on the windowsill, same with the eye, same with the tooth. At that point, I could deny the truth no longer.

There was a wedding ring tightly fixed on the finger, and I recognized the jewelry.

They were bringing her back to me.

\- - - - - 

I threw those profane totems in the trash, slamming the steel lid shut like they were liable to jump out after me. Within the hour, I had my real estate agent on the phone. He kept asking me questions, but I couldn’t make out what he was saying. High-pitched static plagued our connection. My end of it, at least. He claimed he could hear me just fine.

Out of the blue, inexplicably, I had an idea.

*“Could you hold on a second?”*

I set the phone down, paced across the kitchen, opened the trashcan, and submerged the water-logged flesh under a thick layer of unused coffee grounds; a makeshift burial for a few fractions of my long-lost mother.

When I got back on the line, the connection was crystal clear.

*“Yup, I can hear you now. Bad coverage, I guess.”*

I walked into the backyard, closing the screen door behind me. The gulls hadn’t delivered an ear yet, but I didn’t think that precluded the flesh from hearing me.

*“Tim, I need you to get me the fuck out of this house,”* I whispered.

Wild fear thrummed at the base of my skull. My mind raced, imagining all the possibilities.

The sun was setting.

I wondered what the flock was going to bring me tonight.

\- - - - - 

Before the week was up, I’d moved to the opposite end of the city. Not sure why I believed that’d make a damn bit of difference, but I couldn’t do *nothing*.

Without skipping a beat, they started from the beginning.

The first night, it was a tooth.

The next, an eye, and then, a pointing finger with a wedding ring.

There was only one difference.

Each piece was lightly dusted with unused coffee grounds.

So I moved again. Didn’t even bother unpacking. Clearly, I hadn’t traveled far enough. I needed to migrate further from the sea, further inland. That’s where I’d be safe.

When I arrived at my next home, two states over, I felt a glimmer of hope in my chest. Nothing changed, though.

The first night, it was a tooth.

What’s worse, the flock seemed to be getting angry with my futile relocations. I don’t think I slept that first night, and yet, when I examined myself in the bathroom mirror the following morning, I found my skin newly covered in cuts and bruises. Nips and pecks up both forearms, across my chest, down my back - everywhere - and I didn’t feel any pain until I laid my eyes on the wounds. Standing in front of my reflection, mouth gaping, color draining from my face, agony rushed across my body like a tidal wave, the sensation of a hundred beaks pulling and prodding at my skin until it burst.

The second night, I attempted to catch them in the act.

When I heard them cawing on the front lawn, I leapt out of bed and sprinted to the window, pulling the blinds up with such force that the drawstring broke.

Didn’t see a single gull outside, but I heard a bevy of gentle wingbeats overhead. They moved before I could get a look. Maddened by exhaustion, I bolted out of the bedroom, to the windows on the opposite side of the house. I was dead-set on at least *seeing* them.

As I tumbled through the hallway, panting, tripping over myself, there was the soft, muffled clicking of talons meeting wood beside me.

They were in the walls.

With a grin and an uncontrolled fit of laughter, I ran downstairs and pulled a hammer from a half-empty moving box. I stood still. Steadied my breathing and perked my ears. Another few muffled clicks emanated from somewhere behind me.

I swung around and sent the hammer’s claw crashing into the plaster. When I wrenched it out, I saw a glimpse of something in the small, splintered hole.

Pulpy, white, feathered meat, squishing through the crawlspace at an unnatural speed.

Something about the sight extinguished my frenzy.

I released my grip. The hammer clattered to the floor. I collapsed shortly thereafter.

Cautiously, tears welling under my bloodshot eyes, I plodded towards the hole. Once I was close enough, I placed two trembling lips to the orifice.

*“Hey…M-Mom…M-Mom…I’m…I’m sorry,”* I muttered, pleading, groveling.

*“No more deal…no more deal…”*

I repeated that phrase over, and over, and over, and over again, until sleep finally took me.

Some time later, bright light gleamed against my closed eyes, body cradled tightly in the fetal position, head resting on the floor.

My eyelids creaked open. My vision focused.

A single cloudy pupil stared back at me.

\- - - - - 

Want to know the worst part?

I don’t even remember *what* we argued about, all those years ago.

I mean, I was eight, for Christ’s sake.

We were at the beach, just her and me. I don’t remember the car ride. I don’t recall walking along the boardwalk or setting up our umbrella in the sand.

I just remember anger. Vicious, seething, white-hot anger.

I sat on our towel, stewing, rage marinating in its own venomous juices. She was ignoring me, reading a book, sipping dark liquor from a silver flask. Or maybe she was trying to start a conversation; maybe I was the one ignoring her. Maybe the flask is a detail I added after the fact, something to make me feel better about my part in her disappearance. It’s all so hazy.

At some point, she stood. Went to the bathroom, I think.

While she was gone, something began creeping towards me from across the beach.

Superficially, it *looked* like a gull - beady eyes with gray wings and a down-turned beak - but there was something fundamentally wrong with it. I could see chaotic clusters of tangled blood vessels throbbing beneath its chest. Its breathing was hoarse, labored, and deep. It walked on a pair of six-toed feet, most of which were talons, but some of them were more akin to elongated, human-like toes.

No one seemed bothered by its presence. Kids ran by it without blinking. Adults talked and laughed and threw frisbees around it, completely indifferent to the creature.

Eventually, it was right in front of our umbrella, unblinking eyes locked on mine, and I sort of just…knew.

This thing was offering me something. 

A deal. 

And I was still so, so angry.

I wanted Mom gone. 

Vanished. Extinct.

I wished her *dead*.

The gull’s beak rasped open. A wet, pink tongue unfurled from inside its mouth, unraveling like a fire hose that’d been coiled into a taut spiral. The glistening appendage twirled towards me until it landed at my feet.

It wanted something in return.

It desired tribute.

Something to seal the deal.

I didn’t have much of myself to give, but before too long, I had an idea.

I reached into my mouth and pinched one of my upper canines. It was a baby tooth. A part of myself that was due to fall from me any day now. I twisted and yanked on the canine until its thready connections broke. Without hesitation, I laid the chunk of bloodstained enamel onto the tongue. Like the crack of a whip, the salivating tendril and its prize receded, flying back into the hungry blackness of its maw. The sound of it chewing on my tooth, grounding it into a fine dust, was unbearable. 

Suddenly, movement in my peripheral vision pulled my attention away from the gull.

It was Mom.

She was walking towards the ocean, arms fully extended at her shoulders, her body a cross. Her steps were languid, but deliberate. Like the gull, nobody seemed bothered by her odd spectacle. Even when her legs carried her into the ocean, even when her head disappeared below the tide, no one cared.

I cared. I think I cared.

Or maybe I smiled.

Like I said, my memories are hazy.

This was all so long ago.

\- - - - - 

Fearing the damage that might be done if I don’t stay put, I haven’t moved a fourth time.

Over the last few months, they’ve returned most of her to me. Unsure of what else to do, I've decided to give Mom a true burial. 

Her piecemeal body looms below the dirt in my backyard.

As I type this, I can hear her through my closed bedroom window.

She isn’t speaking, per se.

The sound is higher. Shrill, guttural, dripping with spite and confusion.

A caw of sorts. 

Mom wants me to know that she feels like I did that day.

So, so angry.

And once she’s finally complete, I think she’ll find me.

She’ll rise from the earth, trudging through the house in the dead of night. 

From the false safety of my bed, I’ll hear her lumber up the stairs, down the hall, and into my room, with a question burning on the tip of her festering tongue.

Mom will want to know why I did that to her, why I agreed to its deal.

I think she’ll be curious about why I was so, so angry as well. 

And when she realizes I don’t have anything to tell her, when she really understands that I don’t have an explanation to give,

I think I’ll be in really, really [big trouble.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1j88zl3/welcome_to_a_very_chaotic_horror_subredditupdated/)",19,1758496805.0,nosleep,2,0.92,False

Hi! It's nice to meet you. I am a 29 year old cisgender asexual/omniromantic female who is looking to meet anyone who considers themselves to be male. My hobbies include watching cooking , baking, knitting, sewing, reading, anime, reading manga, reading comic books, reading manhwa, watching cartoons, reading webtoons etc. Those are not all my hobbies you'll have to message me to find out more. I would like to get married eventually. I would like to have kids. I consider myself to be sex repulsed and would prefer a partner who is the same. I am looking for someone kind, caring, accepting, honest, loyal, respectful, someone who makes me feel safe. I want someone accepting because I have some disabilities. They are autism, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizoaffective disorder. I also have a genetic defect that makes me extremely sensitive to certain things such as caffeine, so no coffee dates. Being accepting of me and my disabilities is a requirement. As for my appearance I am 5'6, 166 pounds (so slightly overweight), dark brown curly hair that is somewhat long, dark brown eyes, and olive skin tone.

-

*loud and continuous knocking at the door, followed by a deep and gentle* ""Hello?.""

""What the fuck?"" I thought to myself 

No one should be out here. Rich told me during our conversation at the station, that nobody is allowed in the area besides staff because of the fire near by. But maybe it is just a lost hiker or something? I don't know. 

*knocking continues. Getting louder and harder than before*

But I should check, the machete Rich told me about is right by the desk, I want it just in case this isn't a lost hiker. I get out of my seat slowly and I pick up the machete and put it behind me so I don't scare whoever might be behind the door, if this is just a lost hiker. And than I slowly walk to the door. And before I get to the door, just to be safe. 

""Hello?"" 

And just like that. No more knocking. Nothing at all now. 

I approached the door and put my hand on the knob. I slowly turn it and pull the door open gently. 

Not a thing standing there. Nothing at all. 

I quickly turn around and go to grab the flashlight on the desk and take a walk around the cabin while basically touching it by staying so close.

Not a sign of anyone being here besides me. Absolutely nothing at all. 
Crickets chirp around me, owls who-ing in the distance. As peaceful as a night should and can be.

""What the actual hell was that?"" 

I make my way back inside and shut and lock the door. I make sure all windows are shut and locked. And turn everything off in the cabin. 

It was close to 1:30am by this point. and since I had basically done my nightly check in outside like Josh said and everything was normal. Besides what just happened. 

I decided that I should just get in bed and hopefully go to sleep. 

I brushed my teeth and cleaned my face, just trying to ignore what just happened. thankfully the water does work well and is even heated. So that's a plus right now. I Got my clothes changed and started into bed. 

I made sure I brought my own sleeping bag and pillows, didn't wanna use the old and God knows how many people's heads have used pillows here. 

The bed is nothing amazing. It's a twin size bed that looks like it has been clearly well used. But thankfully has visibly clean sheets and a comforter. But I still put my sleeping bag on top of the cover. I get in and zipped up inside and got all good and comfortable. Its pretty cool in the cabin this time of the year, so the sleeping bag was a good choice. 

After a little while I ended up passing out and apparently sleeping through the whole night. Without a peep from me. but with plenty of sounds all around me. Peaceful.
A Goodnight to me.

I woke up the next morning around 8:30am.
it was cold that morning so it took a lot of energy and motivation to get out of my sleeping bag. Cause who like's waking up freezing. 

But once I did get out, I started on my normal morning routine. Got coffee, brushed my teeth. Clean clothes on and prepared myself for the start of a new day and my new life for awhile. 

(Several months pass)
-

Time went by rather quickly being out here. When I first came out here it was had just started to get chilly and leafs just started falling off of the trees and bushes. But still nice out 

Now a blanket of snow has covered everything all around me. Giving my zone an air of beauty I didn't know was possible. 

I've been spending most of time walking around during the day. So far I'm getting to know my zone well, I've marked everything I've come across on my map and take notes for reference points and land marks. 
I made sure to take plenty notes of all animals activities like they told me to.

All the patterns of the herds of Deer I see around take and do, this one particular Buck in the herd. He was massive and one of the most impressive Racks I've ever seen on a Buck. 
I talk about how often I see a squirrel take a dump. I saw a Duck fly over head the other day, I couldn't recognize it but it had gorgeous colors and a unique band around its neck. 
I even got an awesome picture of two chipmunks sitting on a snow covered log while it lightly sprinkled over top of them.

I've also been getting my daily routine down pat at the cabin. Making sure to radio into the Ranger station of my accounts throughout the day and filing my reports on the computer to send to headquarters and Rich. With all my down time, I'm also getting pretty good at Texas Hold 'Em. 
I still haven't been able to make out the temp on the oven. So I just set it to something and wait til it gets warm and throw my food in and just watch it until it looks cooked. What a life.

I haven't had any more moments of silence or any guest show up to the cabin like the first night here.
I make sure to say hello everytime I step outside, walk to a new spot I haven't been. And everytime I walk back inside the cabin. It's becoming a second nature thing for me to do by this point. Things were normal, for awhile at least. 

There was one morning after waking up. Something wasn't normal. It was quiet.

I woke up later than I have most mornings, but normal for the most part. except I couldn't hear anything. 

""you just woke up, maybe just still asleep some and not hearing everything right away."" 

So I get up and walk to the bathroom which isn't far from my bed. I pee and start my morning bathroom routine. 
I still couldn't hear anything. Not evening me peeing. 

Still just thinking I'm half asleep. I went to go start washing my face and hands, and also brush my teeth. I turn the water on and couldn't hear the faucet running, nor anything on the sink making noise when I moved them. Absolute silence. 

I thought that maybe I haven't said enough hellos or missed saying it at some point yesterday. Wasn't sure but again, better safe than sorry. I said ""Hello"" and waited for the sweet sounds of the woods to creep back in like they have before. Except this time, Nothing happened. I couldn't even hear myself talk.
I haven't even heard the gentle ""Hello"" I have everytime before. Just absolute and utter silence. 

I start to panic a little and get some clothes on fast as I can and walk outside to start saying ""Hello"" and hope everything goes back to normal. 
Get my pants on, a shirt and some slippers I brought.
I open the front door. Walk to the bottom of the last step going outside. Take a deep breath and yell ""Hello!"". 
Still absolutely deafening silence. 
""Oh shit. this can't be good.""
""I know, I can send an email to the Station and let them know what's happening."" 
after that I headed back inside, got on the computer and wrote to the station a message. 

""Rich or Josh are you guy's there? I just woke up and I can't hear anything. What's going on?"" 

I Sent it and waited by the computer for a response. 

It took a few minutes to get a response but when I did, it was Jonah. 

He said. 
""Alex it's Jonah. Rich and Josh left out earlier this morning to go meet with the neighboring County Ranger teams to discuss some roads being blocked by some downed trees on the line and to see what needs to be done. They told me to wait inside for messages or calls on the radio. have you been making sure to say Hello?"" 

Me.
""Yes I have, literally every time I make a step or breath I take I say it so the silence stays away. 
Have you been making sure to say it?"" 

Jonah.
""Of course I have, I have worked here for 4 years now and have never slipped up once. And I can hear just fine! Are you 100% sure you've been saying it?""

Me.
""YES IVE BEEN SAYING IT I SWEAR!. Is there any reason you know why it's happening if everyone here makes sure to says it? Obviously we all have been saying it, or less I could hear right?""

It took Jonah a good few minutes to respond, When he did he said. 

Jonah.
""Right, this has happened like this before. About a year ago, during the off season. a homeless man wondered into the park and got lost. it happened then, stayed quiet while they looked for them. Police got involved, Rich had me stay at the station while him and Josh went out looking with the Police. After probably 3 hours of searching they found him and brought him back to the station. He couldn't speak so he couldn't answer questions, the police took him away and that was that. The silence wouldn't go away until nearly a week later. It just went away like it normally does. We never knew why it finally lifted.

Me.
""Okay, so does that mean there's possibly someone lost out here and they're causing this to happen? And why couldn't he speak?

Jonah.
""Yes it's a high probability, even though the park has been closed for the season.
No we don't know and couldn't find out. He couldn't write or sign anything, he didn't even acknowledge we were there. Just a dead stare on his face the whole time he was here.""

I had to ask. 

Me.
""What happened to him?"" 

Jonah.
""I don't know, never heard anything after they left with him. But like then, I'm guessing if you can't hear anything. Someone's gotta be out there."" 

Me.
""Okay, should I start making my way to the station, then we set out and both start looking together?""

Jonah.
""No I can't leave. Rich said no matter what, don't leave the station. someone's gotta be here to radio into and take calls from headquarters. Except now it's a message headquarters thing. You should head out and start by your cabin and work your way around til you get to the station, check in with me before heading back around."" 

Great, now I have to go look for someone who's not supposed to be out here and bring them back to safety, while not being able to hear a dang thing. Obviously a lost person isn't good, just not sure how easy it'll be since I can't hear anything. And not knowing what happens with it quite like this for a long time. But i gotta look for them. No just for their safety. But possibly for all of us out here.

I reply to Jonah. 
Me.
""Okay, I'll get a bag packed with some supplies and start from the east side of the cabin and work my way to you. And what's the code to the safe in my cabin with the gun?""

Jonah. 
""I'm not allowed to share the code unless it's an emergency situation."" 

I wanted to beat Jonah through the screen. 
Me. 
""THIS IS A FUCKING EMERGENCY JONAH! GIVE ME THE DAMN CODE NOW!"" 

Jonah.
""It's 2709. All the shells for it should be in there and have a bag to carry them in."" 

Me.
""Thank you. I Hopefully won't have to use it for anything. But better safe than sorry.
If I don't make it by night fall to the Station. Come looking."" 

Jonah.
""Understood. Bring your radio with you too just in case you find the person and can call it in. Good luck, and Be safe.""

Me. 
""I'll do my best. Thank you.""

I get out of my seat and start throwing on my cold weather clothes and boots and Pack a bag with some food and water and an extra jacket. Flashlight and batteries, the radio. And get the gun from the safe and load it full and throw the ammo bag over my shoulder as fast I could move. 
I grab my map and head out looking for someone out here, hoping to stop this soon.

I start to head east and make my loop toward the station, I'm looking at probably a probably a good 10 mile plus I have to cover,  and I have to try and make it there before night and hopefully have found someone on the way and make the silence go away. 

Time passes and I've made it probably close to five miles by now. Still haven't found anyone and the silence hasn't gone away yet. I started walking after 11am and it's 2pm now. at least I'm making good time, given everything going on. 
But thick and dark clouds begin to close in over head, it starts to snow and it's comes down hard. 

After a short time. I start to get close to a spot I marked on my map that has a small pond that usually the animals around here drink out of. I was expecting it to be frozen over from the cold and no animals around.

I was wrong.

I see the Buck I took note of, his thrashing all around in the pond breaking up the ice. The Buck is mangled and covered in blood, and laying all around the pond are the bodies of the hard of Deer he ran with. All dead. 

""What the hell is going on?"" I think to myself. 

And after a few seconds of watching it. It turns and sees me. And it starts to come towards me.

End of Chapter 4. 
-

Chapter 5.
-

*It starts to run towards me.*

It jumps out of the water faster than I ever thought a Deer could. Pushed through all the ice like it was nothing. I stood frozen in disbelief as to what I was seeing. 

""What's making the Buck do this? Is it the silence?"" I think to myself. 

Before I could react, The Buck reaches me and goes head first right through my left shoulder, impaling me with its Antlers and then it picks me up high into the air. Violently shaking its head around. 
I fight to get my gun shouldered while it swings me around, I manage to get the gun steady and cram the barrel onto the back of the Bucks head. 

With just a simple pull of my finger. 
I fire the gun. Not a shot heard at all. 
But I kill the Buck.

With me still stuck in it's antlers, we both fall to ground. after we hit hard and settle, I start to pull myself off of the antlers and lay over on my back. 

""FUCK!"" I scream from the pain. 

After laying on the ground and to take a second to breathe. It suddenly hits me, something I've not heard for the last few hours. 

""I just heard myself scream""

I take a deep breath and let out a gentle.

""Hello?"" 

Nothing answers, and I hear noting. Besides my own voice still. 

""I actually can hear myself talking again""

 This is a start. but now I'm really confused. 

""How could I not hear myself before, but only after killing the Buck I can? What can that mean? no time to dwell on it now. I gotta move and get to the station."" 

I slowly pick myself up and take my backpack off to get to a trauma kit I brought with me and start applying a quick clot powder to help stop the bleeding. it burns like hell to put on, in case you didn't know. So yeah I screamed a good few times doing that, and than I bandage my shoulder up the best I can. 
Once I'm patched up enough to move. I stand up, I get my bag back on. I take my right arm and rack a new shell in by slimming it to the ground to operate the pump. And now, its time I take a good look at this Buck.

Its antlers are basically destroyed, chipped and cracked. Except for a few points he impaled me with. It looks like he fought a hundred other bucks with these.
His whole body looks like he's been attacked by a pack of wolves and lived to tell the tail. 
Foam coming out of the mouth and absolutely no life left in its eyes. 
Of all my time out being in the woods, I haven't seen anything like this. 

I've seen Deer before with CWD, But this wasn't like that, It's literally as if it went mad and started fighting everything in sight. Like something drove it to do all this. 

After inspecting the Buck. I walk over to check all the other Deer to see what happened to them. Every last one has also been impaled by antlers similar to my wounds.

""That Buck killed them. But why and what made him do this?""

With no time to hang around and try figure things out yet. I have to get to the station. 

""I need to get my shoulder fixed up better soon. It's still early, so I have time to make there before dark"" 

I slowly start to make my way there, having to stop occasionally to adjust my backpack and make sure I'm not bleeding through my bandages. I keep pushing the best I can, it was all well and good until clouds covered over head and began to start snowing really heavy on me. 

""I gotta move quicker than this. I can't get stuck out here in this much snow right now.""

The snow started coming down heavier and heavier by the second. And getting colder and colder by the second. 
I walk as fast as I can and keep pushing. I stop to take a breath, it's than I notice something else in the distance. A person standing alone and looking around. Obviously lost and confused. 
I quickly run into their sight and start waving my hands around. 
They see me, they waved back to me. I start to head towards them. 

""Come on say it, please!"" 

I hoped the person would start to call out for me and say Hello. 
I run over to them and kept waving to show them I mean no harm. I can now clearly see it's a younger woman, shes been out here for awhile, almost blue from the cold, barely wearing anything fit for a snowy hike in the woods.

I try to talk to her in hopes she would talk back and maybe say hello and hopefully make the silence go away. 
She jesters to her ears and shake her head ""No"" meaning she can't hear. 
I jester for them to speak, she shakes her head no again. 
I forgot my phone at the cabin or i would have used that to talk to each other. But thankfully I remembered I had my note book in my pocket, so I pulled it out and write down a question, I showed it to her. 

""Can you hear anything?""

Obviously she shakes her head no.

So I asked another question. 

""can you talk?"" 

*She shakes her head no*

So then I asked. 

""Why can't you talk? Are you deaf?"" 

*She again shakes her head saying no*

It took me a second to piece together what might be up with her, I thought of only one other thing I can think of to ask her. I write. 

""Are you mute?"" 

*she nods yes* 

After that it makes some sense. 
this is probably why the silence hasn't gone away.  She can't speak so she can't say Hello, probably just like the homeless man Jonah mentioned. He was probably mute too. But why didn't Jonah mention it getting crazy like it has been? I guess We'll find out soon enough. 

Seeing how absolutely cold this girl is.
I take my backpack off and pull out the extra jacket I brought and give it to her to put on and get warm. After she put its on zips it up. 

I write down that she needs to follow me and that I'll take her to safety. I show her the note and she reads it and nods her head ""yes"" understanding. 
I hold out my hand for her to take it and she does. We start walking in the direction towards the station and slowly make our ways there. 

Not far after we start walking we get to an open field in a valley, I have been here many times before. It was always so beautiful and peaceful. But not this time. 
More animals are running around, going absolutely crazy. 
Squirrels fighting and killing each other. 
Birds flying into trees and rocks taking their own lives.
More deer tearing each other to shreds. Absolute chaos is occurring in these woods. No time to sit and watch, and potentially get us both hurt or even killed. 

""We have to get out of here and make to the Station."" 

I take her arm and pull her along with me. We run as fast as we can, and get as far out of sight as as we can.

After several hours of running since I found the girl and us seeing the animals chaos in the field. We finally reach sight of the Station in the distance, thankfully right before the sun starts to set, and the snow falls gets even worse. We pick up our pace and hurry up over there, we get into the trail head gate that I entered in many months ago and headed into the parking lot and towards the front of the building. All is calm out here surprisingly. so I felt good having her stay outside while I head in to get Jonah. 
I get to the front door and try opening it, only to found it's locked. 

""Damn it Jonah!, Gotta try the back door.""

I go back to the front and I write down in my notes to tell the woman to stay by the table out front while I go around and try to get inside. She nods yes and takes a seat on the outsides tables benches. 
I make my way around back and find the back door and go over to open it. It's unlocked. I get inside and start looking for where Jonah is. 

After a few minutes of searching throughout the whole downstairs, the offices, kitchen and common area. No ones here. 
I quickly head upstairs to look room to rooms and bathroom to bathrooms. I check every inch, under beds and in closets. Not a sign of Jonah inside anywhere. 

Thinking he must have left to go find me or to go look for the lost person. I go back to the woman out front, she's no longer sitting at the outside table. But she's near the main gate entrance, she's looking out at the road coming into the station. 

There he is, Jonah just standing there in the middle of the road. Looking forward and seems to be on the phone. Not phased by what's happening. 
I go beside the woman and jester we both walk over to him. 
But before we leave out the gate to the road. For the first time all day, and for what now seems like forever ago. 
I hear it. 

""Hello""
Flying through the air like many times before and gently brushing against my ears.

I look to the woman and she's also looking at me. A very concerned and confusing look. She must of heard it too. 

""Why now? Why do we hear it but not a sound or word the entire time we were in the woods. Why do we hear it now?""

I nod to her that I heard it too. She takes my hand and we walk to Jonah. The second my foot hits the asphalt to the main road. Is when it hits me, the moment we entered the gate. 
All the noise of the world is entirely back. Birds singing, squirrels barking and water roaring. I can even cars on the highway a few miles away. Everything is normal here. Dang near brought me to tears. 
And I only just now noticed. 

Jonah turns and see us, he yells, ""ALEX!"" And starts to run toward us

He reaches us and begins to talk. 

""Alex! I was gonna say I'm glad you're alright. But that shoulder tells me otherwise, what the hell happened out there?""

I explain to him most of what happened, the Buck and the Deer by the pond, finding the girl and us seeing all the animals losing their minds. 

""Holy shit."" Jonah reply's. ""What a crazy day this has turned into. And who's the girl?""

Great question, cause this whole I haven't even asked her who she is. Jonah ask before I could. 

""Ma'am what were you doing out here and how did you get into the park? And are you okay do you need any medical assistance? What's your name?"" 

She looks to me and jesters a writing move, obviously wanting my note pad. I hand it to her and tell Jonah. 

""I haven't asked her name or anything like that. I was kind of taken up by other things going on out there and really didn't think it was time for chit chat or even her name. She can't talk, she's mute. So she'll have to speak to us in writing."" 

He nods understanding, he looks to the woman and hands her his phone and takes my note pad from her. 

""Use this so you can type it out faster okay?"" 

She nods yes. Starts typing a message and finishes rather quickly given what she wrote, she hands us the phone. 
It reads.

""My name is Mia, I was in the Little Hungry Gamelands not far from here, I went out yesterday morning to hike to Bottle Neck Rock. 
(The area she's talking about is in the country over. A good 7 or so miles from my cabin and Bottle Neck Rock is about 5 miles from my zones end, near where I found her in the zone.)
I go hiking a lot and felt confident to do this one. but this was my first going hiking during this time of the year. while I was on my way up there. It started snowing pretty bad. I decided it was best to start heading my way back to my car, I took a wrong turn at one of the forks in the trail, And ended up lost and managed to make it all the way out here, I found a hole in the fence from a downed tree and went through it.
After sometime of walking. 
I slowly stopped hearing things and then suddenly I couldn't hear anything anymore. I got scared and just kept moving and trying my best to not stop until I found somewhere to hide out and get warm. I thought I was done for, until he showed up and found me.""

I don't know what was going through Jonah's mind. But his face had a mix of anger and fear. For what reasons I was unaware of now. But he looked to her

""Ma'am I'm happy Alex here was able to find you and bring you back to safety. I need to tell you two something because with all respect ma'am, You being out here has caused a massive shit show. but let's go inside so Mia here can get warm and me get you cleaned and bandaged up Alex. And I'll explain everything then.""

We get inside and Jonah sits me at the kitchen table and gets me comfortable. He then helps Mia get some blankets and puts her by the fire to sit and get some heat back in her. 

He gets a Med Kit from one of the closets and comes back to the table and pulls a chair up beside me. He helps me take my layers off so he can start treating my wounds. 

Apparently between the Adrenaline and Fear I was going through out, I hadn't realized or noticed how bad that Buck actually got me. While cleaning me up Jonah tells me. 

""This thing got you freaking good, almost got your Subclavian Artery, pretty sure your collarbone is broken. And they came out the back of your shoulder blade. Jesus Christ""

He begans cleaning the wounds and uses some type of anti septic spray. It burns like absolute hell. I start banging my fist on the table from the pain. he goes as fast and as safely as he can, sowing up the wounds and applying antibiotic ointment. He then starts wrapping up my shoulder and begins to explain what's all going on. 

""Alright so both you listen. Mainly you Mia, these woods are home to something, what it is I'm honestly not sure of. We're never told anything about it other than, we have to say hello every time we go somewhere out here. 
The station area and road are safe. You ever wonder why there was a fence all the way around, it's to obviously keep people out."" 

He continues. 

""For normal people who do get lost, these situations kind of sort themselves out. Cause anyone lost is at some point is going to say Hello. 
Except for 2 times I've noticed. 
The first was a story I told Alex about a homeless man getting lost, and now you Mia. And with you not being able to speak, Well. I genuinely don't know what happens when we don't say it. You two seeing the animals go ape shit isn't something I've ever experienced my whole time here."" 

He looks to Mia.

""So in short. We gotta find a way to get you to say hello, or God knows what'll happen to us all."" 

End of Chapter 5.
-
Chapter 6.
-
The look on Mia's face when Jonah said this. Was a look of  fear and dread like I had never seen before. 
Worry being clearly shown through her eyes, tears start to form in the corners and slowly fall down her cheek. 

I ask Jonah a question regarding the previous time this occurred. 

""What really happened to the Man? If he couldn't speak, why did all the stop and not continue? What was done?"" 

He took a deep breath and then answered.

""I really don't know, he was old and looked like he was on his last leg.
After they took him. it didn't calm down and we had to shut the entire park down and even had to send workers home still it got sorted out. A week after we found him, It all went back to normal. So my guess is he must have died."" 

I gave Mia a worried look and then looked back to Jonah and I asked. 

""So will she have to. Well, You know?"" 

He replied. 
""No i don't want it to come to that. We'll do whatever we can besides that."" 

We didn't know what else to say or do. So we just waited. For something to happen.

Close to an hour of sitting quiet amongst ourselves and thinking of all the possibilities we have. The front door opens and in walks Rich, he looked directly at me and says.

""Alex, I'm going to need you to come with me."" 

""Why, what's?"" Before I could finish my sentence, Rich interrupts me and yells 

""OUTSIDE NOW ALEX!.

I hurriedly get out of my seat and walk past Rich holding the door open for me. 
Three men all wearing uniforms similar to Rich's are standing around Josh and are looking at the woods and what chaos unfolding out there. One of the men with a White uniform shirt on, turns around and faces us. He looks directly at me and says. 

""Alex you get yourself over here now, I have some questions for you."" 

I go and stand beside the man, who puts his arm around me and starts to walk me towards the gate into the woods. He begins to speak. 

""Now Alex, I know you don't know me, but I clearly know you. I'm Leigh McMurray, one of the seat members for the WRC in the State house. I personally picked you for this job. I saw your resume when you applied. You had lots of time outdoors, took some navigation and survival training courses. You were a good fit, I thought I could trust you with this job, and now I'm not so sure. And as your boss, I have to ask. do you care to explain to me what in Gods good earth is happening out here? And I want the truth."" 

I take a deep and began to explain everything. What happened the morning I woke up and couldn't hear anything. all the animals killing each other and themselves and terrorizing the woods. every detail in between. Except for one part. I leave her out. 
He starts to pat me on the back and laughs. He takes a few steps forward and turns around to face me.

And he says. 
""Now now Alex, Tall tails don't do you, me or anyone any good. Why lie?"" 

I give him a very confused look and ask.
""what do you mean? I swear I'm telling the truth."" 

Leigh laughs even more. And says.
""Come on now boy. You should know that ain't the truth I wanna hear. But since you don't know, I'll fill you in. 
A year ago some shit stain of a homeless guy got himself lost out here and well, he couldn't talk and make things better. We've seen many times before. Ol' Rich and me were partners working this Station. We know the deal. 
When someone can't speak and steps foot out here. The woods is angered. Now I wont lie to you, what's controlling everything and making the whole place into hell on earth, is not something I plan to piss off anymore by not doing what it wants. I know It's pleased when people say hello to it. And We all who work here make sure that happens. Even when several poor soul can't. Like the Cat got their tongues apparently. 
The homeless bastard clearly did. He had to please the damn thing one way or another. We looked into who he was and he was no one and a no one means no one to miss him. So he paid the price, just like someone's gonna have to. I know you found a girl out there. And she has a price to pay."" 

I know what he's getting at, I just can't believe it. 

""So telling me, that girl has to die. And I have to kill her, In order to please this thing?""

He's response makes me sick. 

""Well I'm not getting blood on my hands, and us having rotating employees like you makes things so much easier. Why do you really think we'd pay someone as well as we do to just watch some trees? You'll afford the therapy afterwards. Just get it done."" 

After he finishes talking, he just turns around and walks to Rich and tells him a few things. He waves to his man and they all begin to leave. Rich then walks up to me and leans in close. He says 

""Take her to the cabin, keep it clean and throw her down the outhouse hole. There's a reason we never put a real toilet in, makes for a good cover. And once you've done that. Radio in that it's taken care of. Do I make myself clear?""
 
After he finishes. I think to myself. 
""The bathrooms hole, of course it has something to do with what's happening. What a shitty job.""

After that thought, I then squint my eyes to him and ask. 

""Well, what if I say I'm not just going to kill some girl for some spirit because you told me to. What then?"" 

He looks down and shakes his hand. 
""You think we're okay with throwing just her in the hole? Be real with me son, you can't just back out of this. You have no real choice. Take her to cabin and end this."" 

I don't know what to feel right now, I'm at a loss for words. why do I have to do this? how can they make me do this? I can't believe I took this job. How can Rich and Leigh be perfectly fine with just killing people if needed. And what's making all of this happen. I have to know, and the only way I could think of. The hole may tell me. We have to go down there. 

""Okay, I'll take her there now. It'll be done."" 

I head back inside, when I enter Mia and Jonah both are waiting. 

Jonah ask. 
""Alex what's going on? Who was outside talking with you?"" 

I don't answer Jonah. I look to Mia. 

I say to her. 
""Mia, I need to take you somewhere. It'll be okay I promise."" 
I turn to Jonah and say. 
""Keep Rich and Josh here best you can. I'll get this taken care of."" 

He nods, I get my clothes back on and my backpack. I sling my gun over my shoulder. Then me and Mia out towards the cabin. 

The way there was pure insanity. 
So many dead creatures lay around everywhere. Rabbits and Raccoons. Deer by the dozens. Birds in the hundreds. It looks like a War Zone. Some animals are still alive, running wild and killing each other when the opportunity presents itself. I've truly never experienced anything like this in all my life. 
We rush and run for our lives. After hours of running, We get within seeing distance to the cabin and hurry inside. Once in I shut and lock the door. 
We take a minute to catch our breath and once we have. I explain to Mia what I was told to do. 
Everything. 
She starts to sob and falls to her knees. 
I go over to her and wipe her tears and begin to explain what my plan is. 

""We're going into the hole. I have rope and plenty of lights. We either find a way out of here. Or we find out what's causing of all of this. Do you trust me?"" 

She nods yes, I take her hands and stand her up. I get a new set of clothes for myself on, I've still been in my bloody ones from the Buck earlier. After I get changed, I ask her if she wants anything new to wear or anything warmer. She nods yes so I grab her one of my shirts and another one of my other jackets. She's changes and after that. We both get some water down our throats. Then I get the rope ready to go down in the hole. One way or another. I will put an end to this. No matter what. 

I head into the bathroom and start tearing the wood off of the outhouse seat. Once I get it all torn apart. 
I take a chem light from a pack I found in the cabin when I first got here. I open one up and break it on. I drop it down the hole and watch for it to hit bottom. 
It falls and falls. It eventually hits ground.

""Has to be at least eighty feet or more. You can get down this no problem right Mia?"" 
I ask, she looks to me and nods no. 
""Can I lower you down first? I promise I'll be right behind you. I'll get you out of this."" 
She nods yes. 
I tie the rope around the bathtub, it's full metal and bolted to the floor. It'll hold both of our weights. 

I make sure my knots are tight and secure. 
I get myself and her a makeshift climbing harness and get us both set and ready to go down. I get her ready and set up to send her. I put a flash light in her pocket with extra batteries just in case. 

I help her Into the home until she's low enough that I can just ease her down. My shoulder isn't going to make this easy, but I push through the pain and gently lower her in. I told her when she reaches the bottom to tug on the rope three times and then I'll come down. 

After a several long and painful minutes. 
She hits bottom. 
I then set myself up and slowly lower myself into the hole. 
Time to finally see what's behind all of this. Whether it's good or bad. I have to know.

My lonely farmhouse is surrounded by acres upon acres of sprawling cow pasture. It’s been just me out here for going on four years now- unless you count the occasional stray cat coming to my door for the odd piece of bologna. 

I don’t get visitors, I don’t get solicitors, I don’t get Jehovah’s Witnesses breaking down my door or Mormons asking me if I’d like to try their magic underwear. Yes, I *didn’t* get visitors, until last Thursday, when I was watching one of the few channels that come in on my old box TV. It takes a lot to unglue me from my recliner, but a knock at my kitchen door startled me so bad that I bolted up immediately. I crept through the archway that led into my kitchen.

The sight of her through the door’s thin glass window stopped me dead in my tracks. Through the sheer white curtain I could see her staring straight at me. She rapped on the door again, rattling the glass. So much for hiding from company.

I glanced up at the quietly ticking clock on the wood-paneling. 10:17 P.M. I heaved a sigh as I trudged towards the door. My nose scrunched at the sickening smell of butterscotch and Bengay that wafted through the cracks in the doorframe. 

The brass of the doorknob was oddly cool under my touch, like a warning. But I opened the door just an inch. The damp night air seeped into my kitchen, and so did her stench. 

This old woman had a bent-over frame, like she should’ve been shuffling around with a walker or a cane. But there was none. I grit my teeth, staring into her sagging lower-eyelids that allowed me to see under her gummy eyeballs.

I couldn’t help but ask. “How are you here?” 

Her shaking hands smoothed over the mud that marred her floral dress. Under her decaying fingernails were dirt and splinters like she clawed her way up my driveway. She responded with a voice as sickeningly sweet as the butterscotch scent surrounding her, “I walked.” 

I glanced behind her and down my steep, dirt road that stretched for miles. “No, you didn’t. Go back to wherever the hell you came from.” 

I slammed the door in her face. It’s not one of my proudest moments. I stared her down as I clicked the lock on my door and flicked off the kitchen lights. She didn’t knock again. The rest of the night was normal- I sat in my recliner watching Gunsmoke reruns until I felt inclined to go to bed. 

I didn’t let the thought of the old woman plague me for one whole day. My daily routine mostly consisted of drinking stout black coffee at my kitchen table, then migrating to my porch to watch the cows and snap peas. It’s too simple a life for some, but if you inherit an old farmhouse and a fortune from your late grandparents, then you may criticize me. 

In the month of August, the sun here sets around 8:30. I glanced outside the window just above my sink, and the sky was a deep blue with just a hint of the yellow disappearing behind the mountains. I had occupied myself with baking bread that evening- a decent enough hobby and it kept me fat and happy. 

I sprinkled flour on my rolling pin before working out the dough on the countertop. My eyes tended to wander with such a quiet hobby, and I’d always find myself glancing out that sink window. I loved to watch the calves nestle close to their mamas for the night, and that night was no exception. Even as I watched a particularly odd cow- short and stubby with movements more like an injured dog than a heifer. I stopped rolling out the dough and squinted my eyes. The other cows were terrified, letting out moos of horror as they hurried away from that one. 

All the cattle on this property were Angus- pure black, but this one had a head of stark white. Perhaps it had gotten loose from some neighboring property miles away. 

I thought this issue could wait until the morning, until I heard it moo. The moo was all wrong. Too high-pitched, too mucusy. Too butterscotch.

I grabbed a rifle I had propped next to the unused wood stove, and stormed out onto my porch. This heifer was standing on two feet now, watching me. Though it was a heifer of a different sort- an old woman. It was somewhat dark, but I could see her crepe-paper skin and distant eyes. She was wearing a black gown now, dragging against the dewy grass below. 

Against my better judgment, I yelled at her in warning. “You’d better start hobbling the *fuck* out of here.” 

She tilted her head at me, as though she was some poorly trained puppy. Then she was on her hands and knees again, launching herself towards me. She closed most of the distance between us before I could even blink. 

I should’ve shot her, but my heart sank to my stomach, and all I could think to do was run back inside. I latched my door, and watched out the narrow window as she slowly stood again, just outside the threshold. Placing a sweaty palm against the glass, her rampant breath cast a heavy fog on the other side. 

It took me an hour to catch my own breath afterward. Even after this long, I still can’t understand what happened. 

I taped a trashbag over the glass on the door that night. I checked the locks on my windows and my cellar door. I slept with my rifle propped up against the garish floral wallpaper of my bedroom. The wallpaper itself reminded me so much of that hag’s dresses, all I could do was scrunch my eyes shut and pray for sleep to take me. 

The next morning, I admit, I was rattled. Looking in the dusty mirror of my dresser, heavy bags enveloped my undereyes. I scrubbed my hands over my face, hoping that would somehow wipe the delirium of a restless night from me. 

This old woman was animalistic. I couldn’t help but think what would’ve happened if she caught me the night before. I prayed she had gone away, but I would be prepared for her arrival tonight regardless. 

But, I still had some responsibilities. I forced myself downstairs that morning, frying a few lackluster scrambled eggs for myself. I filled an old Stanley thermos with my strong coffee, and opened a junk drawer to reach for my late grandfather’s rusty bowie knife. Then, I cautiously opened the kitchen door and glanced out on my porch. No sign of the old woman- I wasn’t even certain this old broad would be as terrifying in the daytime. 

I decided I needed to check on the cattle, hence my excursion outside. I walked up the side of the grassy hill, glancing at each cow as I went for anything out of the ordinary. They were all fine- grazing as usual and somewhat agitated by my presence. It wasn’t until I reached the crest of the hill and looked down that I realized not all of the cattle had been left unharmed. 

Keeled over on its side, a bull lay dead, flies already starting to swarm and surround it. Wrapped around the bull’s neck was a lacy black gown, pulled tight enough to kill. I shuddered, giving a brief glance all around me to make sure the hag wasn’t watching. Then, I stooped low, doing my best to lift up the dead cow’s head. I turned it a certain way, and heard the telltale pop of a broken neck. 

I tried not to dwell on it, the absurdity of a little old lady breaking a bull’s neck with her discarded dress. I also tried not to think about an old woman running around naked on my property. The rest of my evening was consumed with moving the bull to our bone pit with my tractor. I dropped the bull on the bones of the rest of the cattle from many years past, and lugged over my bag of quicklime to sprinkle on its corpse. The smell of death around here carries for miles when left unchecked. 

I eventually settled down enough to sit in the rocking chair on my porch. The cicadas were unusually loud that day. I nursed a glass of sweet tea as though it were something stronger, and gawked at the greens and yellows of the August trees. August was a slow death. The days trudged on as summer begged to die. 

The rest of my day was relatively normal, though I kept an extra watchful eye on my surroundings. 

Then it was time for me to turn in for the night once more. It was 11:49 P.M. The old woman had not dared knock yet, and part of me thought perhaps she’d given up. I felt the chill of the damp summer night settle in around me as I lay in bed. I pulled up my grandmother’s itchy afghan blankets, and stared at the water-damaged ceiling. I felt wrong that night. I knew why, but perhaps I didn’t have the guts to admit it. 

My eyes were heavy, yet my mind refused to let me shut them. Without moving my head, my eyes darted around the walls- to the poorly-done taxidermy mounts and deer horns, to my grandparent’s wedding photos from back in the ‘60s, to where Grandma’s dark velvet robe still hung on a nail in the corner of the room. There was an entire wall dedicated to crucifixes of all shape and size. This house didn’t have anything from myself in it, save for a drawer-full of clothing. In some way, the house still belonged to them. Still smelled like Grandpa’s aftershave. Still had Grandma’s energy and presence somewhere within it. Every time I walked into that kitchen, I half-expected her to be leaning over the stove, stirring a skillet of gravy. 

I had just begun to drift off to sleep, when a thunderous bang echoed outside. I jolted up, chucking my blankets off and slipping my chilled feet onto the floor. I snatched my rifle from where it leaned against the wall, and slipped out into the hallway. 

I was incredibly cautious not to make much noise as I slinked down the wooden staircase.  My left hand braced against the wood paneling as I went down, careful not to knock any family portraits off the wall. 

I took the final step down, and felt the yellow shag carpet of my living room beneath my feet. I took a quick scan. The ceiling fan steadily hummed as I glanced around. My twin tan recliners sat empty, and the plaid couch against the far wall was the same. The ancient Magnavox television was off, just how I left it. The glass of milk I left on the dark oak coffee table was untouched. Nothing was out of place here. So I crept forward, raising my rifle slightly. I was creeping up on the archway in the left wall that led into the kitchen. 

I took a deep breath in, then whipped around the corner. I expected to see her face staring back at me. But the pane of glass on my door was still covered, and the room was empty. Dark. 

I refused to be fooled by her. Just because she wasn’t in my home- it didn’t mean she wasn’t nearby. I turned my head to the right, glancing out the window above the sink. I saw no cattle, only empty, rolling hills of grass. 

I laid my rifle up against a cupboard, before peeling back the garbage bag taped over the door. I peered out into the night. My porch was as I left it that afternoon. 

I waited for probably twenty minutes, just listening. I was frozen to that spot in the kitchen until I deemed it safe to go back to bed. 

My breathing was unusually heavy that night. I remember feeling this weight on my chest, pushing down on my straining lungs. I forced my eyes shut and tried to relax just enough for sleep to take me. I calmed my breath to a steady, shallow rhythm. It was only then did I notice that I was not the only one breathing in here.

My ears locked onto the dog-like panting in the darkened corner of my room. My heart thudded in my throat, blood draining from my face. I debated not opening my eyes, just laying there and playing dead, but I couldn’t. 

I cracked my eyes open. The corner was black. The breathing grew. Excited. Hungry. 

My eyes adjusted too slowly, but I could see a slash of yellowed teeth through the blackness. I could see her gummy, clouded eyeballs, and they were looking straight at me. 

I clutched the blankets around me like I was holding on for dear life. I willed myself to look away from her, to snap my head over towards my rifle. It was supposed to be propped on the wall. Supposed to be. 

I left it downstairs.

I didn’t know what to do. I was shaking so hard my teeth chattered. 

It took me about a half an hour for my heavy tongue to form words. “Wha- What the hell do you want from me?” 

She didn’t answer me. She didn’t move the whole night. Her breath did eventually slow to something more contented, like a purring cat. 

I heard the cuckoo clock chime for each hour throughout the night. Twelve, one, two, three, four. I didn’t sleep, just stared at her as she stared at me. 

It wasn’t until 6 A.M that the eerie smile was instantly wiped from her face. Her countenance turned blank, spaced out. Then she shuffled over to the door, and I heard her slowly walk down the stairs. The steps creaked and popped like her weary old bones.

I am not ashamed to admit I cried after she left. I released a sob I’d been holding in all night. Part of me thought if I made too much noise, she’d launch herself at me. 

I was unsteady on my feet as I rose. I tore open the bottom dresser drawer, and hastily threw on some clothes. I was about to set foot out into my hall when the wall of crucifixes caught my eye. I carefully removed one and clutched it to my chest as I walked downstairs. 

It did not deter her.

She sat across from me at my kitchen table that morning. She was eating stale cereal I didn’t even know I had. The woman couldn’t seem to close her mouth quite right- I couldn’t take my eyes away as milk seeped through the jagged gaps in her teeth and dribbled back into the bowl. Needless to say, I lost my appetite for breakfast as I watched her slurp the same disgorged milk back into her mouth for a half hour.

She made herself at home, stoking up the wood stove until it was a thousand degrees inside. Then, she took up residency in my grandfather’s old recliner for the rest of the day. I tried to talk to her a few times. To urge and beg and plead her to go. She didn’t listen. She didn’t even respond.

I was going to kill her today. I just had to work myself up to it. 

That evening after supper, she had occupied herself with looking through month-old newspapers. She would raise a shaking, withered hand to her mouth, before slobbering all over it. She used her saliva to wet her fingers and turn to the next page. She occupied herself with the obituaries for a while, before moving to the crossword puzzle. She was stuck on 6-Down, an eight-letter word synonymous with ‘forever’. I knew the answer, but it got caught in my throat. 

Eventually, she used a blotchy ink pen to circle job advertisements. Positions for funeral home attendants, meat cutters, butcherers. Her blank eyes met mine when she slid the paper in front of me. 

Somehow, that was the final straw.

I pushed back from the table, my chair scraping against the floorboards. I crossed the room for my rifle, right where I’d left it. I knew it was loaded. My hands found the stock, and I nestled it in the crook of my armpit. I grimaced as I clicked the safety off. There was no going back from this. I leveled the barrel at the back of her stark white head. My breath rattled in my lungs as I tightened my grip, then squeezed the trigger.

The gunshot echoed in the confines of my kitchen, making my ears sing. It dazed me.

I sat the rifle on the countertop, taking a few steps closer to inspect her. Bits of brain and fragments of skull pelted themselves against the table. She lay face down, arms splayed out in front of her. The hole in the back of her head oozed out a bloody sludge. 

I couldn’t deal with more death today. Shaking and trying to pull myself together, I stumbled into the living room. I plopped down on the plaid couch, sinking down into it. I closed my eyes and heaved a sob. I would clean her up later, I thought. 

But that’s not the worst part. The worst part was, she was back an hour later, bent over my stove. She was gumming on a ladle of cream of mushroom soup. Just enough for her. There was a vague whisper of a wound on her forehead. I watched it closely. It seemed to fade with each passing second.

I’m afraid I haven’t been entirely honest with anyone reading this up until this point. I am afraid of the old woman not because she’s found her way in my house- but because she is alive in the first place. I say this with complete conviction- I buried this sagging old bitch under my floorboards on August 1st. I remember. She hobbled up my driveway with purpose that very first time. I watched her from my porch. Maybe she had dementia or Alzheimer’s, maybe she was lost and her car broke down. I didn’t think much of it until she sat down in the rocking chair on my porch, pretending like the place was hers. She didn’t say too much to me for the entire ten minutes I questioned and threatened her. Then, by way of greeting, she said, “Irene and Harlan used to live here.” 

My grandparent’s names. 

I leaned against the peeling white post of my porch and gave her a quizzical look. “Yeah. Used to. What business is it of yours?” 

She really looked at me for the first time then. There wasn’t much life in her eyes, and that made my stomach drop. She pointed a wrinkled talon at me. “You weren’t very good to them.” 

I scoffed. “I took care of my grandparents for years when the rest of my family would’ve had them thrown in a nursing home.” 

The old woman leaned back, fishing a piece of strawberry candy out of a dress pocket. “How did they die?” 

A droplet of sweat rolled off my brow, and I squinted my eyes at her odd question. “...Grandpa Harlan was so heartbroken about Grandma’s cancer, his heart couldn’t take it.” 

The old woman hummed in consideration, popping the candy in her mouth. I cringed at the smacking sounds her ancient mouth made around it. Then she spoke again. “I find it unusual that neither of them had a funeral.” 

I cleared my throat awkwardly. “It just wasn’t in the cards financially,” I said, doing my damndest to feign ignorance. “They were cremated,” I clarified.

She made an overt display of turning around, gawking at the farmhouse and the land surrounding it. “You sure gained plenty from their passing.” 

I grew tired of her catty statements. “Listen, I’m exhausted and I don’t like company. I don’t know how you made it up here or why, but you’d better be getting back. If you need to use the landline phone, that’s fine, but otherwise, *leave*.” 

Her swinging jowls drooped impossibly lower at that. She grunted as she pushed herself out of the rocking chair, stumbling back onto her feet. Now face to face with her, I tried to be casual as I stepped away from her and towards my kitchen door. “Have a good day,” She said, her face now as neutral as ever. 

I breathed a little easier for just a moment as I turned my doorknob. Then the words she said next stopped me in my tracks. 

“I just don’t think under that old oak tree is where I would’ve chosen to bury them.” 

I whipped around to look at her, my heart sinking to my stomach. “What did you just say?” 

Her vile lips looked like two slimy earthworms as she said, “Irene and Harlan deserved better than this. Better than the likes of *you*.” 

I could feel the blood rush to my face. “You old fucking windbag. You don’t know what you’re talking about. Go home, *now*.” 

She smiled at me then, wicked, with too many teeth. “This will be my home someday. I rather like it here.” 

The way she looked at me made something under my skin buzz with rage and made my stomach weak with nausea. I vaguely remember feeling the cool steel of my grandfather’s old bowie knife strapped to my side, and that was it.

I don’t know what overtook me. I am not some murderer. 

But she was dead, and I was covered in her blood, and I buried her under my floorboards. I peeled up the disgusting yellow shag carpet in my living room, through the layers of plywood, then to the original wood. I kept going until I hit dirt, and I dug her a shallow grave with my bare hands. 

She didn’t stink up the place. I covered her body with quicklime. Plenty to go around on a farm- nobody wants to smell the corpse of a bloated cow, in either sense. 

I didn’t know what she meant when she said it was her home now. I don’t know why something like this would happen to me. Perhaps it’s divine justice, or cruel and unusual punishment.

That first time meeting her was the only time she spoke. She tormented me then, and now she torments me with utter, maddening silence. 

She torments me in many ways. It’s always hot in here now. She keeps feeding the wood stove. It hadn’t seen a flame since my grandfather tended to it; now it never rests. It’s so hot, but my body betrays me and won’t allow me to sweat. So I must endure the feverish burn against my face and body at all times. 

She could go outside. Why was she allowed outside? I am stuck in this house. Some unseen force is trapping me between these four walls. I feel suffocated. Like some invisible hands are pressing full-force against my throat and lungs if I even attempt to step out onto my porch. It is unbearable, the suffocation. My vision turns black and every primal urge inside my brain is fighting to keep me alive. So I give up, I come back inside, I watch James Arness shoot another man on TV. The hag steals the remote, she turns the volume down just low enough to where I can’t quite hear what they’re saying. 

Eventually, my appetite disappeared. The food in my cabinets dwindled every time I ripped them open. The old woman was eating it all, but somehow, no matter how much time passed, there was always enough for her. But it didn’t matter. The thought of eating made me sick after a while, until the concept of hunger became a numbness in the pit of my stomach. I was turning into a ghost, each of my functions as a human decaying and then fading away entirely.

Yesterday, I had enough. I forced myself to walk outside, to be suffocated. I never felt so scared, so helpless in my entire life. Trying to gasp for air, but nothing comes… There is no feeling like it. But I withstood it, in hopes of finally resting like my grandparents under the oak tree. 

By all means, I was dead. I remember this blackness- soupy and swirling around me, engulfing my sense of self. It was a comforting breeze across my stagnant river of a body. It filled my nostrils, then my lungs, and seeped into my veins. I remember thinking… Nothing. I’ve always been an overthinker, yet my brain was just… Still. 

I was at peace, or so I thought. Then this morning, I woke up under the floorboards, coughing out lumps of warm August dirt and wriggling worms. I could hear the staticky TV mutter. I could hear the hag sucking on a piece of candy, and the wrapper crumple to the floor. 

I tried taking a mouthful of the dirt, choking myself on it. I always woke up. Terror struck my heart each time, an overwhelming terror of life itself. 

I tore my way out of the floor, lifting up the loose carpet. I was panting, and dirt clung to me as I trudged towards my recliner. The old woman didn’t look at me once, just smacked her tongue around the candy and stared blankly at the TV. 

As time crawled on, the old woman made herself more at home. One night, I forced myself to lie down in my bed for a dreamless sleep. Then I heard her flat feet patter up the steps, and across the bedroom floor. 

The bed dipped and the mattress springs squealed. I bolted up, but her movements were not so frantic. She sat down slowly, calculatingly. Her back was to me at first, then she mustered the strength to swing her swollen legs over the bed. Her shaking hand pushed me so I fell flat on my back. I took a deep, wavering breath. She laid down next to me, curling into my body and draping her arm over my heaving chest. Her thin skin was so cold. I tried not to gag- her arm was full of liver spots, and I swore they reeked of dead cow. Wiry, spindly gray hairs poked through each one of them. 

Her putrid breath was oppressive against my face, sticky in my lungs. I could hardly breathe. She laid there, staring at me. I thought she was incapable of sleep until wet snores escaped her throat. She fell asleep with her eyes open. 

I extracted myself from the bed that night, and sat on the couch until I could calm down. If the old bitch wanted the bed, she could take it. I didn’t need it anymore. I wasn’t sure I even needed *sleep* anymore. 

At 6 A.M, I attempted to kill her again. I wrapped a dish towel around her throat. She wheezed, she writhed. I didn’t let go until I heard her windpipe snap. It was a long morning. I hauled her body downstairs, tossing her corpse outside the threshold of the house and onto the porch. A naive part of me thought that would banish her for good.

But a few hours later, I heard her ragged, pained breathing coming from my bedroom. When I found her, she was on her bony knees, throwing out all of my belongings from my lone drawer. 

I let her. I hadn’t been able to stop anything she’d done so far. She replaced my few items of clothing with her own floral dresses and some collectible salt and pepper shakers wrapped carefully in newspaper. 

Days faded into weeks, and I etched each calendar day away with a slash of dried Sharpie. Then came August 31st. I was glued to my kitchen chair that day, just staring at the calendar taped on the side of the refrigerator. I was shaking. I would’ve been biting my fingernails, but I discovered after a few weeks that they didn’t grow back now. 

The hag occupied herself with something upstairs. I didn’t even care enough to see what, even if it was outside of her regular routine. The occasional thud or bang would echo down the staircase, but it didn’t move me from my spot. 

I sat there until it was dark, just listening to the refrigerator hum and the wood stove crackle. 

My vision tunneled, fixated on the calendar only to occasionally dart to the clock. 

11:59 P.M. 

It was almost midnight, and it was almost September. 

My jaw clamped down tight, grinding my teeth together. I prayed and I prayed and I prayed.

I’d never prayed before my grandparents died. Only after, I prayed not to get caught. Now I pray for the hag to release me. 

My mouth went bone-dry as I listened to the clock tick the final seconds of August. 

My leg bounced frantically. 

Five, four, three, two, one. 

I thought I’d been successful in leaving August behind. 

Then all the lights in the house went dark. I was sitting in the pitch black, the warm wood of the kitchen chair underneath me. My refrigerator went quiet. The TV snapped off. Hot air puffed against my face like a foul breath. 

I didn’t move. I kept my eyes where I thought the calendar was. I knew exactly what was going to happen. I knew it and it didn’t make it any less devastating. 

After an agonizing minute, I heard power hum back through the wiring in the house. A lone lightbulb stuttered on overhead. 

My jaw quivered as I looked at the calendar. My Sharpie markings were gone. It was blank. August 1st. It was August 1st. 

When I could beckon myself to move, I pointed my rifle at the roof of my mouth and pulled the trigger. 

The momentary darkness that washed over me like tides on a beach supplied me little comfort this time. I woke up, my tongue laved over a mushy pit where the roof of my mouth should’ve been. My hair and scalp shifted on their own volition as the top of my skull weaved itself back together, second by second. I felt no pain. God save me, I felt no pain.

The month of August was eternity, and I was stuck in it. I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’m not afraid of the old woman- I am afraid of said eternity. And I’m stuck with both in a house that smells like mothballs and butterscotch, with a TV that only plays old westerns, and with crocheted blankets that smell like death. I am prohibited from truly living my life, yet I cannot die. 

This is my eternity. ",2,1758496710.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Since I was a kid I’ve been in friend groups with both genders. I work at a coffee shop as a barista where I’m much of the time the only guy, so on a daily basis I interact and socialize with women. 
I, however, have never been in a relationship and I’m getting pretty old for that. I’m 26 and I’ve dated a little and have plenty of hookup experiences but that’s not something I’m proud of. 

My issue is overthinking. I can be comfortable talking to someone over DMs until I think of saying something that might be taken the wrong way so I overthink the message I’m about to send and end up saying something in a different wording, usually boring and watered down. Problem is it was usually something harmless and the modified message usually has more potential to be taken the wrong way.

Once that overthinking happens, it’s done, I can’t fix it and the connection is ruined for me regardless of what she thinks. my best bet is to give up and find someone else. 

I have a lot of shame in this BECAUSE I have a history of having women as friends as well as having  good interactions with women and don’t always even have a hard time attracting until I fuck it up by overthinking. 
I really want to be better than the “can’t talk to women” trope because i think that’s cringe. I’m definitely more sensitive so I think emotional connection with women is a strong point for me but I need to be better than this.

So any productive advice would be appreciated

1nn6o8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nn6o8e/crushing_on_a_girl_from_class_but_also_super/,"Crushing on a girl from class, but also super confused if she's interested, should I make things clear?","I'm currently talking to this girl from my class — we’re both juniors in college and have a few classes together. I’ve only known her for a few weeks, so I’m not saying I want to jump into a relationship, but I’m starting to feel something more than friendship. I’m kind of on the fence about whether or not I should make my interest in something potentially romantic clear.

We recently went on a late-night drive together in my car (around 11 PM) for about three hours. We grabbed ice cream and talked the entire time. Honestly, everything she shared about herself just made her more attractive to me — it’s a feeling I haven’t had for a woman in a long time.

We also study together a lot after class, we text pretty regularly, and she seems genuinely interested in what I have to say. On top of that, she’s done some things that kinda sound like she might be interested in me.

* She’s offered to bake treats for me
* Invited me to keep her company while she bakes/cooks at her place
* offered to come over to my place while I cook
* Asked me to go to the gym with her
* Told me she’d love to go on another night drive
* Bought me coffee

All of that seems promising. But here’s where my confusion is coming from — some of her phrasing sounds like she sees me as a friend. She’s said things like:

* “I love having friends over when I cook/bake”
* “I love baking for friends.”
* “I’ve been wanting a gym buddy.""

Im not sure if this is just how she talks, but it's making me confused but also I could just be looking to much into it. 

So now I’m stuck debating whether I should express that I see her as someone I could be romantically interested in. I really don’t want to make things weird for her and me in class, but I also don’t want to suppress my feelings or let the moment pass. I know this isn't all the details, but what do y'all think about whats going on? 

TL;DR

I’ve been getting close to a girl from my class — we hang out a lot, text often, and recently had a long late-night drive that felt meaningful. She’s invited me to do things like bake at her place, go to the gym, and even bought me coffee, which feels flirty. But she also uses friendly language that confuses me. I’m interested in her romantically, but unsure if I should say something or just keep it friendly to avoid making things weird.

1nn6mok,https://www.reddit.com/r/PsycheOrSike/comments/1nn6mok/you_overestimate_female_choice/,You overestimate female choice,"In reality, guys choose. Take for example my life, perfectly normal life.

When I was 10, guys were like ""haha you're ugly, girls are ugly"". When I was 14, I was very slowly starting to make guy friends, but out of all the girls in the school, it was never me that the guys wanted to date, they were fighting to talk to the best-looking girl in the class, and I was catching trickle-down friendship because I was open and super chill. By the time I was 17, I had several male friends who never had a crush on me. Then I started doing my hair with a hot iron and suddenly some of my male friends started to see me as a girl.

It wasn't like they wanted to date me all of a sudden. It's just that one guy was like ""I think she's pretty"" and some other guy was like ""she's not!"". The fact that my name was even mentioned raised my stock enough that I received non-platonic crumbs from 3 unpopular guys. It wasn't 1000 guys, it was 3, and it already felt like I was obligated to pick one. 2 were tall and good-looking guys who just wanted to fuck me when they were drunk so I wanted to escape from that pressure.

The 3rd guy was my favorite. He was short and shy and I saw him cry a few times before we even became a couple. He didn't outright say that he was interested in me, but he asked for my number and then asked me to meet him at a coffee shop. That turned into a hellish meeting from hell, but he was still the only human being to ever ask me out, so we became a couple that lasted 2 years. 

Honestly I was VERY determined to make this last forever. I was the kind of person who's one and done, a guy asks me out, I stay with him forever and marry him. Unfortunately, he was super rapist and he treated me like shit. So on one hand, I was trying to make it last forever, and on the other hand, he was raping me and treating me like shit. 

Eventually I couldn't bear it anymore, I was like I'll take the L of not having my first partner be my forever partner, this guy is too evil, I'd rather die alone. But then he wouldn't accept the breakup. He kept crying and saying he couldn't live without me. I was 19! I had the weight of this guy's happiness on my shoulders and he wouldn't let me go.

I was single for about a year, then there was a wannabe college fuckboy who wanted to fuck me. I still never wanted to have casual sex so I declined.

Then there was a short shy guy who didn't say anything but my friend played matchmaker and I ended up with this second short boyfriend. He was also a terrible boyfriend who treated me like garbage, but since he wasn't as bad as my first boyfriend, I thought I was the luckiest girl in the world. And by the way, you wouldn't believe the lengths I went to to make my boyfriends happy, crazy stuff. It turned out he was kind of a college fuckboy in disguise. He wanted a steady girlfriend *while in college*, so he could have steady hot sex and so I could help him with his homework, then he wanted to go passport bro.

As I was chilling alone and single, I tried a chat-roulette type of video group call and a cute guy there kept asking ""is she real, can you move"" and I was like ""yes I'm real"" and he said ""you're the most attractive I've ever seen on the internet"". For some reason I didn't grab his contact info. I thought that was flattering because he was himself hotter than any of the guys I knew, but I also dismissed the compliment because it didn't fit with my real life experience. Literally nobody in my real life had ever thought I was pretty. Not even the two boyfriends I had.

Then I met a guy at a sporting competition, and we connected over our similar chill, humble, self-deprecating personalities. It really felt like he was the first guy who looked past my looks and liked my personality. This guy was both hot and nice and into me, and he was the ONLY non-abusive guy who ever was into me, but he was leaving the country, so he said he couldn't date me at the time. I waited for his return for 9 months just in case he might still hold a flame for me, but by then he had moved on. I'm so tired of people saying ""girls are never single"". I was so single at 22 that I waited 9 months just on the off chance that a guy would still like me.

Then I finally tried the dating apps. I was 23. There was no big revelation of ""wow a lot of guys want to be with me"" like you guys all think. It was just more of the same, a lot of indifferent guys, nobody saying I'm pretty, nobody trying to get with me. I went on a few first dates (a drink or coffee date) and they were all nice guys, but indifferent, nobody was ""coming off strong"", and I never got asked on a second date.

Then I met a guy on a trip who searched me up on social media and asked me out to a fast-food joint. ""Oh social media has ruined society, you receive hundreds of DMs!"" It happened once in my entire life that a guy asked me out on social media. Once. He became my third boyfriend. And he was once again an awful abusive boyfriend. A different kind of abusive, more manipulative, controlling, jealous, moody, unreasonable, rapist.

Since then I have to deal with every guy looking at me and saying ""anyone would want to date her, thousands of options, she chose the abusive ones, life on easy mode, she could have found a rich guy"". Bitch where? And even if what you say is true, how was I supposed to know? Maybe it's obvious for your male brain that you know many would have been happy to date me, but nobody wears that on their sleeve, so in my female brain, I was convinced that I wasn't good enough and that guys would not be happy to be with me. Every time a guy was open to me I thought I better be grateful because I'm obviously not good enough.",0,1758496344.0,PsycheOrSike,24,0.33,False

1nn6hyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1nn6hyy/dont_die_from_falls_here_is_the_best_scientific/,Don't die from falls. Here is the best scientific tips to prevent that.,"Falling might seem like a small thing. Just a slip or a trip. But for many people, especially as we age, falls can be life-changing, even life-ending. The good news? Most falls are not random accidents. They're signals, and with the right strategies, you can make your home, your body, and your habits strong enough to stop them before they ever happen. You don’t have to live in fear. You just have to live smart, strong, and prepared.

It all starts with your body. The stronger your legs, the steadier your balance, the safer you are. Simple daily movements like squats, heel raises, or even standing on one leg while brushing your teeth can train your body to stay upright and in control. Gentle exercises like Tai Chi and yoga are also powerful: they build strength, awareness, and calm all at once. It’s not about being an athlete. It’s about making your body your own best protector.

Your home should be your safest place, not your biggest risk. Most serious falls actually happen at home: on familiar stairs, in dark hallways, or slippery bathrooms. So fall-proofing your space is essential. Clear out clutter. Tape down cords. Add grab bars by the toilet and shower. Install brighter lights, especially in walkways. One small change (like removing a throw rug) could literally save your life.

Don’t forget your eyes and ears. If you can’t see the edge of a step or hear someone coming from behind, your chances of falling go up fast. Getting regular vision and hearing checkups is simple and powerful. Update your glasses or hearing aids as needed, and wear sunglasses outside to keep your depth perception sharp. Clear senses give you confidence, speed, and clarity. Exactly what you need to stay steady.

When it comes to fall prevention, your legs are your foundation. The stronger they are, the more stable you'll be. Think about it: every step, every shift in weight, every time you catch your balance, it's your leg muscles that do the work. Simple exercises like squats and lunges build power in your quads, hamstrings, and glutes, giving you the strength to stand up from a chair or climb stairs without struggle. Calf raises, performed while holding onto a counter for support, improve stability in your ankles and feet, which is crucial for navigating uneven surfaces. You don't need a gym or heavy weights; you can use your own body weight to build a powerful base.

​Beyond just raw strength, it's about control. Balance is a skill, and like any skill, it gets better with practice. Exercises like standing on one leg (even for just 30 seconds at a time) retrain your brain and body to work together to stay steady. You can do this while waiting for coffee to brew or while brushing your teeth. Incorporating simple balance challenges into your day builds proprioception, your body's awareness of where it is in space. This awareness is what allows you to react quickly and effectively if you trip.

The shoes you wear matter more than you think. Slippers, flip-flops, or heels might be stylish or comfortable, but they can be slippery and unstable. Instead, wear shoes with good grip, strong support, and a snug fit. The right footwear connects you to the ground, giving you the traction and posture you need to move safely and confidently.

Many falls happen because of hidden problems: like medications or chronic conditions. Dizziness, sudden drops in blood pressure, or numbness in the feet can sneak up on you. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to review your medications and how they interact. Keep chronic illnesses like diabetes or arthritis well-managed. These conditions don’t have to slow you down. They just require awareness and smart care.

Tools like canes or walkers are not signs of weakness: they’re signs of strength. They give you extra support when you need it most, and they’ve prevented countless falls. If you ever feel unsteady, even occasionally, ask a physical therapist about proper fittings and training. Empowering yourself with the right tools can keep you moving freely and safely for years to come.

Finally, remember that your brain is just as important as your body. Falls don’t just happen because of muscle weakness. They also happen when we’re tired, distracted, or mentally checked out. Get good sleep every night. Stay sharp with brain games and balance challenges. Be present when you walk: put the phone away, take in your surroundings, and walk with intention.

\------------------------------------------------------------

Hi everyone! 👋

This is my first attempt at designing a PCB, and I’d really appreciate your feedback. I’ve read through the review guidelines and tried to follow them as closely as possible. I’m using EasyEDA and have only been working with it for about two weeks, so some settings may not be perfectly replicated - hopefully what I’ve provided is sufficient.

# Project Overview

This is a two-board setup for controlling a coffee grinder:

* **Main Board**: Powered directly from 230VAC mains. A HLK module steps down to 5V.
* **Relay Control**: An SRD relay switches the L line to activate the grinder motor (mirroring the original functionality). The relay input is selectable via a sliding switch:
   * Controlled by ESP32-C6 logic through a MOSFET
   * Or constantly on via direct GND
* **ESP32-C6**: Flashable via an off-board USB-C connector (connected through headers on the left side of the PCB).
* **LDO Regulator**: I chose the AP7361C instead of the AMS1117 due to widespread complaints about thermal performance and dropout voltage of the latter.
* **Peripheral Control**: The ESP32 switches power to an HX711 and TM1637 via MOSFETs and communicates with them using DIO/DOUT/SCK/CLK/RATE.
* **Indicators**: LEDs show 3.3V presence on the main board and 5V on the accessory board.
* **Connectors**: 2x JST connectors between boards
* **Interfaces**:
   * Sliding switch on main board (Const. on / ESP32 control)
   * Wake button on accessory board (hardware interrupt / deep sleep)

The ESP32 is intended to control the grinder based on weight input from the HX711.

# Design Notes

* The two switches placed on the lower section of the PCB will be soldered to the underside once I receive the board from PCBA (top-side mounting only, for cost reasons).
* I tried to reference example schematics for the individual components (TM1637, HX711, ESP32-C6 Mini, HLK, SRD, etc.) but might have missed some (essential) steps during the integration step.
* The “std. parts” section in the schematic can be ignored for this reason.
* The designators were added for review purposes and will be removed from the silk screen.
* I’m strongly considering ordering the boards separately - the price difference seems minimal.

# What I’d Love Feedback On

* Routing and placement
* General concerns or best practices I might’ve missed
* Any suggestions before I finalize the order

1nn6ggz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1nn6ggz/if_you_want_to_get_more_matches_as_a_male_be_gay/,"If you want to get more matches as a male, be gay","Yes. It worked for me as a heterosexual man and it's going to be 2 amazing years with my girlfriend in November this year.

I used Bumble on and off for several times. Each time, I got zero matches and likes and thought ""man I hate dating apps"" and deleted it. But I had a, dare I say ""brilliant"" idea that would make my last install...well, the last one.

If you're a man, you know men. If you know men, you know that a huge portion of them just swipe right without even looking. I've had a friend who was drinking with one hand and swiping with 2 fingers on the other hand while talking about casual stuff.

And Bumble is an algorithm-based app. If you get more likes, you get pushed more to the top. More people see your profile.

You see where I'm going with this?

I made my profile visible to also men this time, not only women and immediately I started getting likes. Like, from 0 in a week to 50-60 in an hour. Mind you, I'm not a sexy or super handsome guy. Just an average dude.

Obviously most of those 50-60 are guys, but you can tell who is a ""he"" and who is a ""she"" even if their profile is blurred. I swiped left the dudes, and only the women remained. Swiped them to my taste and there she was, my first and last Bumble date.

I've met the love of my life for the first time at a coffee shop by registering myself as a homosexual in an online dating app. I've never met with anyone from an online dating app before. She was the first, and I hope to God, will remain as the last.

Just wanted to put this out there. I don't know if it's a common trick or anything, just wanted to help my fellow average men.

1nn6g48,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyWitch/comments/1nn6g48/i_do_feel_like_a_witch_sometimes/,I do feel like a witch sometimes,"Hello everyone. 

So I don't really know where I'm gonna go. I've always felt a link in me towards something magical, felt a really special link with nature and other animals. But I have to say (and I'm really scared to sound offensive, that's really not my intention) that I don't have the most positive opinion on the way it is showed and done to this day. I find things to be pretty liberal, I don't really like the fact that a lot of products surrounding magic are being made and sold, because it goes against my political values. Philosophically I also feel like it tends towards something really essentialist. That's why growing up I never gave that much into it (where as when I was a child yes).

Anyways today something happened again that made me feel those special little things. I woke up, I had to go to work some hours after, at first I felt ok and normal, but I started to feel extremely anxious for no reason. I am an anxious person, I know how it is, but here it just felt super odd, as if I had drank 5 coffees even though I did not drink one. I was literally telling myself outloud how weird it felt, as if I was back a morning before school, before a stressing exam or idk what. It was really strong and weird. So I went to sit on the couch, I literally told myself ""I should text someone rn"" like it felt so bad and strong. At this exact same moment my sister texted me ""I am so stressed :((("". I asked her why, turns out she had an important thing happening to her in some hours for her work, it had been hours she was really scared and anxious about it (I had no idea she had this thing or what). And so I told her that I was feeling like that too the whole morning without knowing why, I instantly reassured her about the thing (it went really well) and instantly felt really really better. It just felt like my body was telling me. It might seem silly and ridiculous but it felt really weird. She told me that not a long time ago she was explaining to her gf that I always receive her anxiety, she answered to her that we're just crazy hehehe.

I can tell you about something that happened some years ago. I went to see my great-grandmother. Mind you I loved her so freaking much. I was not seeing her often at the time. She was doing well, yes she was really old but had no specific health problem or what. We had a really wholesome moment, I put music, danced and made her laugh, she was being so cute and funny, she told me to come back see her soon.

The day after I was working. And I went back home, with my ex after work. And I started crying so so so much. I cried the whole night, had panic attacks, talking about her the whole night. My ex was so weirded out by it, I was feeling extremely sad about her without knowing why, he didn't know what to tell me or do. It lasted the whole night, I couldn't sleep I was just crying really loud thinking about her. The day after I went to work, I was a cleaner it was a tiring day. Then my shift was over and I see him, my ex, he had come to my work, with a really sad look on his face. She had passed away that day. She just fell asleep like that and passed. I was so sad about it that I didn't think about the past night at all, it's him who talked to me about it after a while. Telling me he was really really weirded out by the situation. My grandma told him to tell me cause she couldn't, and he stayed to whole day thinking about the situation without comprehending.

Those are not at all the only things. I just have this weird stuff, where I feel yes really strong emotions without knowing why and turns out something is actually going on with someone I love. I just have also a weird stuff like that with people who are passing away if I may say???

I had never never meet my biological grandmother on my father side. She's from another country and it was a really heavy story. We never talked. One night she tried to call me on messenger, we didn't speak the same language and I was worried about it, I didn't pick up (which I regret deeply) thinking I'll just send a message the day after. I didn't know her at all, and we didn't speak the same language I was just feeling a bit lost. The day after her daughter sent me a message, because she saw that call and was wondering about it. She announced me she passed away from an aneurysm really just after the call, some hours after max I would say. I know it's not like the rest and it might just be a weird coincidence but it does stick with me.

Am I just a crazy person (yes)? Or do you go through similar stuffs in your life?",2,1758495851.0,BabyWitch,0,1.0,False

I've gotten into espresso making recently (hyperfixation lol) and desperately need a grinder. I'd like the preface this by saying that I am in the United States and I am a minor (I'm not allowed to spend money, even if its my own from working).

Alright, here's the situation: I got into espresso \~2 months ago. I've always loved coffee and partially got into espresso because it would prevent impromptu Starbucks visits filled with overpriced, mediocre coffee. Anyways, I got my espresso machine for my birthday along with all the little knick-knacks and tools (WDT, spring-loaded tamper, bottomless portafilter, gram scale), so I'm all set in that area.

Also I make 1-2 lattes a day (i mean that loosely--they're more like a sorry cappuccino) with fresh beans from a café local to my state (they're actually a roaster sold on Trade, but I don't use that website).

But the darned grinders are stumping me. I didn't ask for one for my birthday because we already had a Hamilton Beach blade grinder (I started hating using it almost instantly--getting a good shot with it is *so rare*), but now I'm looking into trying to get one for Christmas. Anyways, after the painstaking process of binging James Hoffmann and Lance Hedrick, I still can't figure one out.

Obviously, I've looked at the Fellow Opus, Breville Smart Grinder Pro, and Baratza Encore ESP, but those are all \~$200. When I mentioned that the grinders I was looking at were \~$200 to my mom, she freaked and said absolutely not. Then I looked at the KinGrinder P1 and mentioned hand grinders just for her to say no hand grinders??? She seems to think I'll be able to find a <$100 espresso grinder that won't die in a couple months, but I doubt it. I haven't mention buying used to her yet (I'm fine with it), but I'm pretty sure she won't like that either. She's impossible. *Absolutely impossible*.

I have really low expectations on this subject and I'm already guessing I'm doomed to use the crummy blade grinder or deal with not being able to dial in my shots (not to mention the café where I get my beans ground my bag too coarse for espresso), but if it is *somehow possible to get a decent grinder for* ***that cheap***, I'd love to know what to get. If this is hopeless, thanks for reading the ramblings of an overcaffeinated goober and have a good day.

1nn6de3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmilingFriends/comments/1nn6de3/smiling_friends_and_powerpuff_girls_crossover/,Smiling Friends and powerpuff girls crossover,"Story Synopsis: No monsters have attacked townsville lately, which means Buttercup has been feeling grumpy and no amount of cheering up has been able to help her. So it seems the professer hs no other choice but to call two familiar friendly faces as a last resort.

The city of Townsville! A shining beacon of progress and civility! A metropolis where the citizens can walk the streets without a care in the world, knowing they are safe, sound, and secure. But for some, too much safety, too much soundness, and an overabundance of security can be… well, a little boring!

The Utonium residence, a colorful splash of mid-century modern architecture nestled in a quiet cul-de-sac, was experiencing a profound and unusual quiet. Inside, slumped on the living room floor, was Buttercup, the toughest fighter of the Powerpuff Girls. Her brow was furrowed into a permanent scowl, her arms crossed so tightly they looked like a pretzel, and a low, rumbling growl emanated from her chest.

For three solid weeks, not a single monster had attacked Townsville. No giant monsters, no bank-robbing gangsters, no cross-dressing devils. The Mayor’s emergency hotline had been silent. Mojo Jojo hadn’t so much as plotted an evil scheme. The city was peaceful. Blissfully, agonizingly peaceful.

""Buttercup, sweetie,"" said Professor Utonium, kneeling beside her with a plate of freshly baked cookies. ""I made your favorite! Double-fudge destruction chunks!""

Buttercup glanced at the cookie, then back at the wall. ""Not hungry.""

Bubbles floated down, clutching Octi, her beloved stuffed octopus. ""Wanna play dress-up, Buttercup? We can be space princesses fighting evil moon slugs!"" She made a little ‘pew pew’ sound.

""Lame,"" Buttercup grumbled.

Blossom descended, a large, leather-bound book in her hands. ""Perhaps some intellectual stimulation? I've found a fascinating treatise on advanced quantum mechanics. It posits that multiple timelines could—""

""BOR-ING!"" Buttercup shouted, the force of her voice rattling the windows. She stood up and began pacing like a caged tiger. ""What's the point of having super strength if there's nothing to punch?! I need to punch something! I need to smash! I need to feel the satisfying crunch of a knuckle sandwich to a monster’s jaw!""

The Professor sighed, stroking his chin thoughtfully. Blossom and Bubbles exchanged worried glances. They had tried everything: games, movies, even a trip to the malodorous Townsville Dump so Buttercup could smash old refrigerators. Nothing worked. Her grumpiness was a thick, green fog that had settled over the entire house.

Later that evening, as the girls were upstairs (Buttercup was likely punching her pillow into oblivion), the Professor sat in his armchair, sipping lukewarm coffee and perusing the Townsville Chronicle. He scanned past headlines about bake sales and lost cats, his eyes glazing over with worry. Then, a small, peculiar ad in the classifieds caught his attention.

It was starkly minimalist. Just a simple, black-and-white drawing of a smiling face, almost childlike in its design. Beneath it, a single, confident tagline: “Smiling Friends. Guaranteed to make you smile.”

A phone number was listed below. The Professor stared at it. It seemed… unconventional. But at this point, he was desperate. He picked up the large, red telephone on the end table and carefully dialed the number.

The next morning, two figures stood on the Utonium’s manicured lawn. The first was Pim, a short, pink, vaguely humanoid creature with a single antenna-like strand of hair sticking up from his head. He was practically vibrating with positive energy, his wide eyes taking in the vibrant colors of the house.

""Oh, golly, Charlie, look at this place!"" Pim chirped. ""It's so whimsical! I have a really good feeling about this one. I can just feel the potential for smiles radiating from the very foundation!""

Beside him stood Charlie, a taller, yellow creature with a long, drooping nose and a perpetually tired expression. He took a drag from an imaginary cigarette. ""Yeah, it's a real trip, Pim. Looks like a-a-a… like a cartoon threw up, you know? Like one of those old, uh… one of those old shows my grandma used to watch. I'm just sayin', it's a lot. My eyes are kinda hurtin'.""

Pim adjusted his tiny, non-existent lapels. ""Well, let's stay positive! A client in need is a friend indeed! Let's go make a new friend!""

Pim marched confidently to the door and pressed the doorbell, which chimed a cheerful little tune. Charlie shuffled behind him, hands stuffed in his pockets.

The door swung open to reveal Professor Utonium, beaming with academic warmth. ""Ah, you must be the Smiling Friends! Hello! It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Professor Utonium.""

""A pleasure to meet you too, sir!"" Pim said, extending a hand for a vigorous shake. ""My name's Pim, and this is my partner, Charlie! We're here to turn that frown upside down!""

""Uh, yeah, hey,"" Charlie mumbled, giving a slight nod.

""Wonderful!"" He said ""Please, do come in."" He led them into the living room, gesturing for them to take a seat on the sofa.

""Nice, uh… nice house. It's got that whole… Jetsons-but-on-the-ground kinda thing goin' on. It's… it's big."" Said Charlie looking around the place.

""Why, thank you!"" the Professor said, either missing or ignoring the backhanded compliment. ""I hope you can help. It's my daughter, Buttercup. She's one of my three girls, and she's been in a terrible funk lately. Nothing seems to cheer her up. I must warn you, she can be a little… complicated.""

""No client is too complicated for the Smiling Friends!"" Pim declared, puffing out his chest. ""We’ve dealt with everything from closet-dwelling ghouls to, you know, that guy who wanted to end his favorite TV show. We can handle it!""

""Right, right,"" Charlie added, sinking into the couch cushions. ""Just, uh… just so we're clear, she's not gonna, like, throw us through a wall or anything, right? 'Cause the insurance for that is a whole… it’s a whole thing.""

""Oh, heavens no!"" the Professor chuckled. ""She's just a little girl!"" He then turned to the base of the stairs. ""Girls! Could you come down here, please? We have company!""

Three streaks of light—pink, blue, and green—shot down the stairs and hovered in the air. Blossom and Bubbles wore polite, curious expressions. Buttercup looked like she had just swallowed a lemon.

""Girls, these are Mr. Pim and Mr. Charlie,"" the Professor announced. ""They're the Smiling Friends, and they're going to help Buttercup feel happy again!""

Buttercup’s eyes narrowed. ""I don't need help,"" she growled. ""I'm not a baby.""

""Nonsense, dear,"" the Professor said reassuringly. ""I'm certain you'll be smiling by the end of the day!""

""We'll help too!"" Bubbles chirped.

""It will be a fun experiment in emotional recalibration,"" Blossom added with a nod.

Pim floated slightly on the balls of his feet, his enthusiasm infectious to everyone but its intended target. ""That's the spirit! Don't you worry, little lady! Pim is on the case, and my smile-o-meter has never failed me!""

Charlie looked from the flying, super-powered child to Pim and back again. He sighed softly. ""Uh, yeah,"" he said, pointing a thumb at Pim. ""What he said.""

Buttercup shot them a glare that could curdle milk. ""Fine,"" she spat. ""But this is gonna be stupid."" She reluctantly lowered herself to the floor, still floating an inch off the ground out of sheer defiance.

The Narrator chimes in: Ah, the first step to happiness! A fun-filled day of activities! Surely this will do the trick!

Their first stop was the Professor's attic. Pim had suggested they seek out happy memories among old belongings. The attic was a dusty, cluttered treasure trove of scientific gizmos and forgotten family heirlooms.

""Ooh, look!"" Bubbles squealed, holding up a faded photograph of the girls as toddlers, covered in finger paint. ""Remember this?""

""I remember I got more paint on Blossom than on the paper,"" Buttercup said, a flicker of something almost-not-miserable in her eyes before it was extinguished. ""Whatever.""

Pim rummaged through a box. ""How about this, Buttercup? Your first training helmet! Think of all the heroic thoughts you had while wearing this!""

Buttercup just grunted and kicked at a pile of discarded blueprints. ""It's all useless junk.""

Charlie, meanwhile, was idly poking at a box of old toys. His fingers brushed against something cold and metallic. He pulled it out. It was a small, die-cast toy sports car, a sleek silver model with red racing stripes. He stared at it, his usual mask of ironic detachment slipping for a moment.

""Whoa,"" he said, his voice quiet. ""My… my uncle had one of these. The exact model. I remember he, uh… he never let me play with it. Said it was a collector's item."" He turned the little car over in his hand. ""He was a real piece of work, that guy. Kinda reminded me of Mr. Frog, actually. Just, like, always screamin' about something, you know?"" He pocketed the car and shrugged. ""Anyway. What's next on the, uh… on the fun-list?""

Next was a picnic in Townsville Park. Pim had laid out a perfect checkered blanket and was now pointing at the sky. ""Look, Buttercup! That cloud looks just like a smiling puppy! And that one over there looks like a happy little ice cream cone!""

Buttercup lay on her back, arms behind her head, staring blankly at the sky. ""It's water vapor, weirdo. They look like clouds.""

Their day continued at Townsville's theme park, ""Thrill-a-delphia."" Pim insisted they ride the tallest, fastest rollercoaster, ""The Vomit Comet."" As they rocketed through loops and corkscrews, Pim shrieked with unadulterated joy, Bubbles and Blossom screamed uncontrollably in delight, Buttercup remained stoic, her expression unchanged, as if she were merely sitting on a park bench. Charlie, meanwhile, just looked casual.

After the park, Pim suggested a calming yoga session. The instructor began demonstrating a tree pose as everyone followed her lead. Pim, wobbled precariously in a tree pose, sweat beading on his pink forehead as he chanted, ""I am… a happy… willow tree… bending with the winds… of joy… whoa!"" before tipping over. Bubbles and Blossom executed perfect poses without effort, while buttercup just sat with her arms crossed, a look of utter contempt on her face. Charlie had simply lay down and was fast asleep, a soft, wheezing snore escaping his long nose.

Finally, as the sun began to set, they went to see a movie. Pim had chosen an animated feature called ""Barnaby Bear's Big Hug."" It was an hour and a half of saccharine songs and cloying morals. As the credits rolled and they filed out of the theater, Pim was wiping a tear from his eye.

""Wow!"" he exclaimed, his voice thick with emotion. ""That was just… that was awesome! When Barnaby shared his honey with the grumpy badger? Gosh, that just… that really got me.""

""It was just a kids' movie, Pim"" said charlie still sipping his soda ""The badger had no motivation. I didn't really like it that much, to be honest. The animation was kinda cheap, that's Just- in my Opinion is all im saying.""

""I loved it!"" Bubbles sang, clutching a plush Barnaby Bear she'd gotten at the concession stand. ""The songs were so happy!""

Blossom turned to her green-clad sister. ""So, Buttercup? What did you think of today? Did you have any fun at all?""

It was the wrong question.

Buttercup stopped walking. She spun around, her face a thunderous mask of pure rage. ""Fun?"" she screamed, her voice echoing through the theater lobby. ""FUN?! The whole day was STUPID! Looking at junk was stupid! The clouds were stupid! The rollercoaster was okay, I guess, but your screaming was stupid! That stupid yoga thing was stupid! And that movie… that movie was the STUPIDEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! NOTHING WORKED! I'M STILL NOT HAPPY! I just want to PUNCH something!""

A silence fell over the group. Passersby gave them a wide berth. Pim’s cheerful facade finally cracked. His shoulders slumped, his antenna drooped, and his wide eyes looked watery. ""But… but we tried everything… we've never failed a client before, Charlie.""

Charlie put a hand on his partner's shoulder, a look of pity mixed with relief on his face. ""Hey, it's alright, man. We gave it a shot. She's a tough case."" He turned to the girls. ""Look, uh… no offense, but I kinda think we're, we’re startin' to get on her bad side here. We should probably just call it a day."" He looked at Pim. ""We gotta go back to the office anyway. She's gotta fill out the, uh… the failure-to-smile paperwork.""

""Oh great, more boring stuff!"" Said buttercup, punting her lips.

The Narrator chimes in: Oh dear! It seems our plucky little heroes from another company have failed! Whatever will they do now? 

The trip back wasn't anything special, it was mostly blossom berating buttercup about how rude she's been all day and how disappointed the professer is going to be when they get back, while Charlie and Pim, just talk about... stuff.""

The Smiling Friends office was a small, unassuming building wedged between a pawn shop and a laundromat. As the five of them approached, the street was quiet.

""Okay, so it's just a, it's just a few forms,"" Charlie was explaining. ""Standard stuff.

Suddenly, the ground began to shake. A deafening roar split the air. From behind a skyscraper, a colossal creature emerged. It was a grotesque beast made of living garbage and scrap metal, with glowing red tires for eyes and a massive, rusty dumpster for a mouth. It bellowed again, sending cars flying.

The monster’s enormous, trash-strewn foot slammed down right in front of the Smiling Friends office. The facade of the building crumpled inwards with a sickening crunch of brick and glass.

Inside, at his desk, Alan was meticulously polishing a block of cheese, his headphones blasting heavy metal. The wall behind him imploded. He didn't flinch. Glep, a small, green creature, was sitting across from him, tapping away on his iPad. A chunk of ceiling landed on Glep’s desk. He didn't look up.

Alan finally took off his headphones. The sound of screaming and destruction faintly filtered in. ""Hey, Glep,"" he said calmly. ""Did you hear a noise?""

Glep looked up from his iPad for a fraction of a second and made a small, indifferent sound: ""Meh.""

Alan shrugged. ""Huh. Must've been a bird."" He put his headphones back on and returned to his cheese.

Outside, chaos reigned. People were screaming and running in every direction. The monster’s gaze fell upon the small group standing on the sidewalk. With a swift, clumsy motion, a giant claw made of rebar and old bicycle frames swooped down and snatched Charlie and Pim off the ground.

""WHOA! HEY!"" Charlie yelled, dangling a hundred feet in the air.

""AHHHH! CHARLIE! IT'S GOT US!"" Pim shrieked, his little legs flailing wildly.

The monster brought them towards its gaping, foul-smelling maw. In that moment, staring into the abyss of rotting food and rusted metal, Charlie went pale. ""Oh my god, Pim! Oh my god, this is it! We're gonna die! I'm gonna puke! I'm definitely gonna puke!""

But down on the street, something had changed. Blossom and Bubbles were ready to leap into action, but they stopped and stared at their sister.

Buttercup was looking up at the monster, at the pure, unadulterated chaos, at the imminent danger. And for the first time all day, a slow, wide, predatory grin spread across her face.

""Now this,"" she said, her voice filled with a terrifying glee, ""is what I'm talking about.""

She shot into the air like a green cannonball.

What followed was a beautiful, brutal ballet of destruction. Buttercup became a blur of motion, a verdant comet of fury. She delivered a lightning-fast series of punches to the monster's metallic gut, each impact echoing like a thunderclap. WHAM! BAM! POW! She flew up and grabbed its two antennae—a pair of bent streetlights—and tied them into a pretzel. The monster roared in pain and frustration, dropping a terrified Pim and Charlie.

Blossom swooped in, catching them with a pink energy field just before they hit the pavement.

Buttercup wasn't done. She zipped around the beast, dismantling it piece by piece, throwing tires into orbit and ripping off chunks of its garbage hide. For the grand finale, she flew straight up into the clouds, then came down in a power-dive, her fist glowing with green energy. She struck the monster square in the head with a punch that shook the entire city block. The colossal garbage beast teetered, its tire-eyes spinning, before it collapsed into a massive, stinking heap of junk, utterly defeated.

Buttercup landed softly amidst the wreckage, dusting off her hands. She was breathing heavily, her hair was a mess, and she was covered in grime. But she was radiating pure, unadulterated joy. She was finally, truly happy.

""You did it, Buttercup! And you're smiling!"" Bubbles cheered, flying over with Blossom.

""The Professor is going to be so happy you're feeling better!"" Blossom said with a proud smile.

Pim and Charlie staggered to their feet, brushing themselves off. Pim rushed over to Buttercup. ""Wow! That was amazing! Thank you so much for saving us! And you're smiling!""

Charlie stumbled after him. ""Yeah, man… thanks. I… I genuinely thought I was gonna die. My whole life flashed before my eyes. It was mostly just me watching TV. It was really underwhelming, actually."" He took a deep breath. ""So… uh.""

A strange, awkward energy settled over the group as the adrenaline faded.

""I Guess,"" Charlie began, looking at Pim, ""that, uh… you know. I guess we didn't really… do anything. To, uh… to make her smile.""

Pim’s brow furrowed in serious thought, his cartoony demeanor replaced by a look of genuine professional concern. ""Yeah, no, you're right, Technically, the monster made her smile. So, does that… does that count as a success for us? Or…""

""I don't know, man,"" Charlie said, rubbing the back of his neck. ""Because, like, we were here. You know? Our presence led to this whole situation. If we hadn't been
here, maybe the monster wouldn't have… well, no, the monster probably still would have shown up. But uh- we were here. So…""

""So, yeah by being here"" Pim continued, talking over him, ""it was the monster showing up that made buttercup smile. So, does that still count? do we still have to do the paperwork? The failure paperwork? Because this feels more like a… like a circumstantial success.""

""Yeah, a circumstantial success, I like that,"" Charlie nodded."" But does that mean are we gonna get paid aswell? 'Cause the boss is real specific about the whole 'we have to be the ones who make them smile' clause. It's like, right there in the handbook. Page four, I think. Under 'No Proxies'.""

""Yeah, no, i get that But it just seems like a grey area, Charlie, It just feels more like grey area to be honest."" Pim insisted, his voice getting more serious. ""Like, I dunno, should We probably consider—""

Finally, Buttercup had had enough. ""OH, FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD!"" she bellowed, her good mood already starting to fray. ""SHUT UP!"" The three girls had been watching this exchange in complete, baffled silence.

Blossom gave a nervous chuckle. ""Right! Well, we should probably be going now! Before… uh… before she turns grumpy again."" She grabbed Buttercup's arm.

""It was nice meeting you!"" Blossom called as she and Bubbles pulled Buttercup into the air. ""Bye, Smiling Friends!"" Called Bubbles.

Pim and Charlie watched them fly away into the evening sky as they waved at them. ""Wow, ya know that genuinely freaked me out, man, that startled me, like I honestly thought she was gonna laser us or something, or like punch us."" Said Charlie looking back at Pim.


""Actually, ya know what, now that I think about it, it probably doesn't matter ya know. Cus like- remember... remember when we were with- Desmond and you kinda... went into that sort of existential crisis, ya know, after he said a bunch of stuff about how the sun's gonna explode and all that- .""

""Yeah, I don't... I don't really wanna think about that."" Said pim.

Yeah, no sorry man, but... but what I'm sayin is, we went back to the office and there were these all bliblies everywhere, and like... Desmond shot one of them and he uh... that made him smile, and then he got into that uh... that bliblie buisness.""

""Yeah, no, and we... Still got paid for that, didn't we? that counted didn't it? But I mean, I'm just thinking, even if we weren't called up by the professer, the monster would have still showed up.""

""Yeah no, I Don't think it really matters or anything.""

""Yeah, yeah you're probably right, but, charlie I just remembered, the office is destroyed."" Said pim, as their gaze fell upon the smoldering, gaping hole that used to be the front of their office.

""Yeah no, you're right I don't think the Boss is gonna be happy about this, Pim,"" Charlie said with a heavy sigh.""

The Narrator chimes in: ""looks like the Smiling Friends won't be smiling when they see that repair bill! HaHaHa""

Charlie looked up at the sky again, his expression calm but firm. ""Hey. No offense, man,"" he said to the empty air. ""But you've kinda been getting on my nerves all day, and I mean... now- nows not really the time dude the office has been destroyed, and ya know.. you're being kind of a douche about it.""

The Narrator's voice, suddenly flustered: Oh! Uh… my apologies. I- I didn't realize…

""Yeah, no worries, man, it's all good. Sorry I called you a Douche and all that."" Charlie said, waving a dismissive hand.

A moment of silence passed.

The Narrator, regaining his composure: AND SO ONCE AGAIN, THE DAY IS SAVED! THANKS TO… THE POWERPUFF GIRLS!
