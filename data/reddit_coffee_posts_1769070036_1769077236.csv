I'm not really a 'gamer' myself but I haven't had a problem with it until now. A few months ago he started playing an online video game that's a battle royale type game where you have teams and compete against other players. At first he would just play it in the evening after work like any other game for an hour or two and then we'd watch TV or a movie while I did schoolwork. However, he then began to play it from the time he got home from work at around 4pm until 2 or 3 in the morning. I wasn't a huge fan of this because it's a very loud game and he would yell into the headset to communicate with other players which was very distracting as I was doing schoolwork and we live in a small flat so sleeping was difficult. He has started started acting very differently while playing this particular game, for example he screams and swears at other players on his team if they mess up in the game or if they lose. He will also argue with other players over the messaging system and say really vulgar stuff. I mentioned being upset once b/c he was saying stuff about rape, using the n-word, etc and he told me to calm down as he was ""just joking"" and that's what everyone does.

three-ish weeks ago I came home during a break between classes and he was home during a workday. He told me his job cut back his hours to only three days a week. Since then he has devoted all of his spare time to gaming. I am in nursing school and also work so I'm gone most of the day, we have one day a week that neither of us work or go to school. We used to go places or run errands on those days but now if I can even get him out of the house he gets antsy and has to rush home to play so he doesn't ""miss anything"". He also expects me to continue doing a majority of the housework (which I have always done) like cleaning, laundry, and preparing meals. I told him I can't realistically go to school, work, and clean and cook. He will call me repeatedly at work or in class begging me to stop off on the way home and get him chips or beer. I'm pretty sure he lives off of crap junkfood because none of the healthy meals I prep seem to get eaten by him. Junkfood is expensive and since he's barely working I am trying to shop cheaply so we can pay our rent and other expenses.

The final straw for me is the way he reacts when he loses in the game--he has started throwing stuff, screaming, swearing, and lashing out at me. He has broken a lamp, knocked a leg off the coffee table, and broken multiple glasses. He broke his headset and used my amazon account to order a new one. I have tried to talk to him about this and asked him to either find another way to cope or play in an area of the home with less breakable stuff in it and he told me that I don't understand how it feels to lose an important game. He accused me of being controlling and abusive towards him which was very hurtful. He also is in a group chat with the people on his team and I once saw him (i looked over his shoulder while he was chatting, which was shitty I know this) text in their group instagram chat that I was a ""nag"" and ""always bitching at him"". Even worse, a lot of the players on his team seem to be teenage boys or girls so I doubt they understand what it's like to be a in a longterm relationship. I have tried multiple times to tell him that the video game obsession is too much for me to handle, and yesterday suggested couples counseling. He has pretty much ignored me every time or promised that he'll be less aggressive on the game/limit his time. I almost dread going back to our flat bc I know he'll be gaming all night. I am aware this sounds like a very stupid problem to have, but I feel a bit like I'm living with a teenage boy

We will be relocating this spring/summer and looking for opinions from people who know the areas a little better

We have very young kids so need to consider schooling and have decided we want to ensure we’re in the catchment for the decent schools. 

We’ve been weighing up options for ensuring we’re close enough to Catsmose in Oakham (eg Langham, Whissendine etc) or opting for close to Bourne (somewhere like Thurlby). We don’t know Bourne or Market Deeping very well but we often go to Stamford and love it. (Not fussed about having to drive to amenities, we’re used to it and I prefer the peace and quiet of the countryside vs town living). 

I’m conscious of why the house prices are so much lower in the villages surrounding Bourne. Is this a nice area to live in? We could certainly afford a much bigger house than the Rutland alternatives, but we know Rutland and it’s such a pretty area. 

I imagine if we were based near Bourne we would use Stamford as our go to for meals out, coffee trips etc.

I get this sort of aura before my pain is about to kick in where I feel the need to pee but it kind of also hurts generally down there. Then when I pee I feel relief but as soon as my bladder is empty, the pain starts. It is like an achey burning. As my bladder fills back up the pain lessens, but it’s still bad, but I still get the urge too pee to relieve the pain, t hen its this cycle whereby when I keep peeing for a moment it relieves the pain but then the urge to pee gets stronger and my pain gets worse. 

Sometimes the only thing that helps is curling in a ball and putting heat directly on my vagina or belly. Or directing a burning hot showerhead directly at it also relieves the pain but I still keep needing to pee.

It feels worse when I stand, not when I sit down. Days after I’ll have this pain and it comes and goes, seems to get worse when I drink alcohol or lots of coffee, and is often relieved when I poop (I get pretty constipated) 

Sometimes I’ll poop and it takes away the pain. 

Does this sounds like PN to you? My doc is pretty sure but a lot of the symptoms don’t align for me. My other guess is I have endo, but at this point the pain is getting really bad and I need this sorted out so I can treat it.

We lived in the same house almost our whole lives, so we were raised like sisters.

When we were kids, our relationship was difficult. There were situations where Ashley shared private things about me with others or said things that caused me to be bullied. I later understood that a lot of this came from her mother’s influence. Because we were children, I eventually forgave her and tried to move on.

When I was around 16, we became close again. We also had a mutual friend, Aisha. There was a very complicated situation involving a boy I liked. It caused a lot of stress and emotional pain for everyone involved. During that time, I was struggling with depression and my mental health. At first, Ashley supported me, but later she changed and started blaming me for the situation. Even so, I stayed in contact with her over the years, although the hurt never fully went away.

A few years later, Ashley developed serious health problems and ended up in a coma. Doctors told us she might not survive. I was extremely distressed and blamed myself for not being more supportive before. I spent a lot of time at the hospital, and when she woke up, it felt like a miracle.

After she recovered, however, the same old issues came back. One day, we were having coffee and talking about the past. I said that I wasn’t angry anymore and that we were young and made mistakes. Ashley responded by saying that I was pretending to be a good person, that I would do the same things again, and that I was the one who caused the problems. Hearing this was very painful for me.

I lost control of my emotions and mentioned that the boy from the past had contacted me recently, but that I told him not to message me anymore because it still hurts. After that conversation, I went home and stopped contacting Ashley completely. I didn’t explain my decision. I just felt emotionally exhausted.

Now I feel very conflicted. She survived something life-threatening, and I feel guilty for cutting her off after that. At the same time, her words brought back years of pain that never fully healed.

I ate a tiny piece of chicken and about 5 minutes later, symptoms dramatically improved. Ate a bit more, and within minutes my stomach is completely back to normal.

So needless to say I broke this fast. I feel fine, but now very discouraged about fasting. It was a pretty awful attack of nausea and I was at work at the time. It was hard to drive home.

I am a teenager, distracted for a long time, and was trapped in the loop of addictions with a lot of things, just lost in life, forgetting my direction, and losing my habits. I was too distracted by things like social media and lost in fake knowledge mainly fraud without any check, just believing everything and doing nothing all day, distracted without purpose. Yes, I have seen so much content so much, I mean a lot.

I have seen content on cinematography and creators like Anything GAWX and all, and learned storytelling. Maybe that’s not learning because I didn’t practice anything. But now I am changing everything. The past was my past; now I have to work on what I have and make things.

Ok, so yeah, happy New Year also, because this year is special. I have spent less time on social media and distractions, but I have spent it on myself.  
I believe if you are not using something, you are being used by it.  
Same as if it’s free, you are the product.

So for now, what I am doing in the present it’s been a lot of time, more than 3 weeks.  
I go for a walk at 4:30 a.m. in this cold, and there was so much fog.  
Then I go to the gym and come home; it takes 3–4 hours in total. After that, I just eat something or prepare content and work. Then I go to the library, as I am writing from the library.

I am disciplined, going to the gym, and doing NoFap for 21+ days. I broke my past PR of this streak, and I am not going to break it under any circumstances. I don’t want cheap pleasure; I have purpose in my life and a direction.

So we all know 10 year T-bills are set by the market, not directly by the Federal Reserve (which just sets the overnight funds rate). And Atrioc has also mentioned many times that the 10 year T-bill rate is also the benchmark for most forms of debt (mortgages, car loans, business loans, etc.)

  
But what I don't understand is that, if the bond traders setting the market for the 10 year refuse to accept a lower return because of fears that ""Trump in a mustache"" is going to be the new fed chair and cause runaway inflation by setting the overnight funds rate near 0%, isn't that itself anti-inflationary? 

If the 10-year T-bill rate remains high (out of bond holders fears of inflation), the loans benchmarked off that rate, which drive a lot of spending in the economy, will also remain high. Won't that prevent the economy from over heating with more money chasing the same amount of goods?

1qjqj8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qjqj8n/all_colours/,All Colours,"My family moved to Edelweiss, a small city in the backwoods of the State of Forrest, when I was five years old. We had recently left Indiana for the Kwatsi Bay, as my dad had got a job as a typist for the County Court in the region. The house we moved into was a small colonial that was easily older than even my grandfather, although that's not saying much; he was only fifty-three at the time. I never had much love for the house. It was intimidatingly large when I was small, and now that I'm big, it's incredibly claustrophobic, although not from the house alone, rather the pressing, quiet judgment with four limbs and piercing eyes that followed me everywhere. Later, I learned how to make that weight tolerable, but not today. 

We moved into a small neighbourhood of about six houses that were slightly smaller than ours. The lawns were trimmed and green and I spent a lot of our first day just rolling around in it. It was a definite upgrade from our Evansville apartment. The night that we got here, I remember my dad joking that:

""Hey, guess we got ourselves the plantation home while the others were for our [servants].""

He did not use the word servants. My mother did not find that funny, and he had to stop drinking for the rest of the day. 
 
The first two years in Edelweiss weren't noteworthy in the slightest, not that I can remember any of it. I spent much of my time playing in the large backyard, and large it was. My father only owned two acres, but it was two acres of wilderness right next to a mountain. While steep, if I wanted to, I could get lost in there, and on one chilly September morning, I did exactly that, despite my parents' warnings. My mother had already gone to work, and my father was busy nursing himself after he had the flu.
 
“Dad,” I said.

“Dad.”

“Can you come outside?”
 
I pestered him for a good hour to try to play with me.
 
""Later, Jules."" He waved a hand and gave out an exasperated sigh. I waited fifteen minutes, which was really like an hour for a kid.

""Dad.""

""Not right now, Julian..."" He rolled his eyes.

“You said later,” I said.

“I said not now,” he urged.

I think it was the fact that the game I had in mind involved him sitting on all fours and me riding his back like a horse. My father didn't raise his voice often, but when he did, he developed this strong baritone. When he was upset, he wasn't one to let you forget that fact. Ten minutes later, third verse, same as the first:

""Dad.""

He sighed. “Julian, not today.”
 
“Just for a little.”
 
""Julian, I said *no!*""

I sucked in my bottom lip, and it quivered. ""Just go play outside or something..."" He continued, rolling onto his side. Tears didn't form. It was more like that throbbing at the edges. Insolent anger and helplessness, combined with the shock of hearing my Dad raise his voice. Fine then, you old bastard, I'll make my own fun. I went and stomped outside the house. I then tried my best to distract myself in the backyard. My dad had yet to mow the lawn for that week, and so the tall grass was great for reenacting a war movie my dad had shown me. I pretended to crawl under enemy fire, and I gutted a man, and I did other things that a seven-year-old probably shouldn't have known about, but when you have only one TV, and everyone is home at the same time, usually you watch what dad wants to watch. This playtime didn't last long, and soon I was overcome with boredom once more. I opted to try a new game, perhaps fueled by spite. Yell at me, will you?  
 
I began to step my small legs towards the mountain. In between me and the mountain, once you got down the hill at least, was a creek. This creek was the hard 'border' my parents had set. Go beyond there, and it was trouble. I don't think they knew precisely what resided on that mountain. If I were to guess, they were just nervous about mountain lions or coyotes getting me. It would've been easier explained that way, at least. The creek usually rose in the autumn months, but this was a particularly dry September, so I was able to get past. The creek wasn't very deep, but I slipped on the gneiss bottom, and I thought I broke my ass for a few moments. Still, I sucked it in after a minor sulk and began my arduous climb up the steep mountain. 
 
I'm not really sure what I was looking for or what I was expecting, and I began to feel very silly for disobeying my parents once my legs began to burn and my feet grew heavier. Besides dropping on my butt in the creek, I had also nearly submerged my shoes. Lifting each foot came with a great deal of effort, and my quickstep hiking became a slow march. I had to stop and rest at a tree, maybe every fifteen steps. Grabbing onto branches to hold myself wasn't a sure bet either, as my hands were greasy, sweaty, and slipping. I had a close call trying to wrench myself up a particularly steep part, missing one branch and tumbling before I grabbed onto a second. I breathed heavily, my own breathing loud in my ears as I tried to gather myself. I continued even then. I kept thinking about the creek and how I should've tried skipping over it; this barrier was put there by someone far above me as a warning. And, did I listen? At some point, the trees stopped looking the same. The bark changed colour. The leaves got broader. I noticed it the way you notice a word you’ve said too many times, suddenly strange in your mouth.
 
 I pivoted around to see the view. Birds chirping was nearly drowned out by my heavy breathing.
 
I couldn't see my house.
 
I began to do this odd twirl and dance as I stumbled, trying to catch my bearings. I recognized none of it. Not even the soil looked the same. My heart pounded loudly. I stood in the middle of a green and brown sea of tangling branches and twigs.  I tried to turn back the way I had come, but I couldn’t tell which way that was. I picked a direction and started walking, convinced the mountain would correct itself. My legs felt heavy. Each step landed harder than I had intended. The scrape in my shoe had turned into a dull sting. The shadows stretched thin and long between the trees. Had I been gone this long? My stomach hurt in that hollow way it did before dinner. I thought about my dad inside the house, quiet again, the TV murmuring to itself. My parents were going to be so mad. 

I wondered how long it had been.

When I finally sat down, it wasn’t because I actively decided to myself that it was best to rest; my legs merely stopped holding me up. I leaned against a tree and slid down the bark, leaving a faint smear of dirt on my shirt. I pressed my face into my knees and waited for it to fix itself, a bubbling behind my eyes as I resisted the urge, the need, to wail out. Tears began to pool down my face, and I sat there in silence, the only sound being the wind fluttering against my shirt. Distantly, however, I began to hear the soft cry of something mechanical. This repeating wail, like a tornado siren or an ambulance passing by. I lifted my head nervously and glanced around. Maybe I was near a road after all? I shakily stood up as I began to make a trek towards it. I walked and stumbled, but it seemed like I was getting no closer. The siren was distant all the same, no matter how much I moved. I stopped after nearly five minutes of chasing this phantom whine, when this whine suddenly became closer and louder, and louder, and suddenly I felt like it was up next to my ear. Goosepimples riddled my body as I turned around fast, and there was nothing.
 
Then I turned around again, and I was met by the waist of a man. He was wearing a suit, an old-timey one like a clown would wear, with a high collar, and it was red and green all over in oscillating shapes.  I jumped back and nearly fell down, scratching my hand up as I stabilized myself against a rise in the mountain. Standing before me was a man far taller than me and my dad, maybe seven feet tall. He looked down at me. His head was far too large for his lithe body, and I noticed that it was a spherical shape, with jagged edges.
 
""Hello."" He said, and his voice was very small and flat. Despite his imposing figure, he spoke softly, with a gentle delivery and an airy quality. His mouth didn't move at all as he spoke. He lifted the microphone as he went to speak.  His skin looked pale and dry, the colour of old paper. His face looked to be painted on in its entirety with blue triangles for eyes and a yellow oval for a mouth. There was also a small brown block where his nose should have been. He tilted his head slightly. “You shouldn’t breathe like that,” he said. “It’ll make your chest hurt.”

I wiped my face with my sleeve, embarrassed that he’d noticed.

“You came up too fast,” he went on. “That’s why your legs stopped working.”

I didn’t tell him they’d stopped before I sat down. He crouched a little, careful with the movement, like he might topple over if he moved too quickly. 

“Sit,” he said, pointing at the ground beside the tree. “Not all the way down. Just like that.”

I hesitated. “That’s better,” he said anyway.

 ""Who..."" I exhaled as every urge in my body told me to run away. ""Who are you?"" 
 
He looked like he was beginning to answer, but he didn't as he straightened up. I looked at his hands and the machine in his hand. It was connected to the microphone; it looked like a speaker with a large cone and a small central dome hidden behind it, housed in a solid, octagonal cabinet with several buttons on the top. Two small wires were connected to it, wrapped around two large antennae that were attached to his cone-shaped hat.

""... Are you an alien?"" I asked, and he said, ""No, not quite.""
 
""Are you a... are you a ghost?"" I tried again, and his head shook again, and he said, ""Well, in an odd sense. I'm all colours.""

I stared at him, waiting for him to elaborate, but nothing came. I blinked, shut my eyes, and rubbed them with the back of my hand. Staring at him made my head hurt, like staring into a fluorescent light. The neon shapes on his clothing spun, and his fuzzy head made my mind buzz with static. ""Where am I? I wanna go home!"" I belted out, having kept it in, tears beginning to stream down my face again.

""You know,"" he responded simply. He looked past me up the slope of the mountain. 

""Where's my mom and dad?' 

""You know.""

""Who are you?' I repeated. 

""You know.""

I grew red-faced and frustrated in response. Whoever this stranger was, if he wasn't going to help me and was just going to stand there and nauseate me, then I had no interest. I stood and started to turn to stomp away to show my disapproval and annoyance in my juvenile manner. “You’re standing where the ground slips,” He said. “That’s why your hands are shaking.”

I looked down. They were, but I figured that was more to do with the rage and helplessness in me rather than anything to do with the ground. “You’ll fall if you try to run like this,” he added.

“I’m not-” I started, then stopped. My mouth felt thick, and the words didn't exit my mouth. The man turned on his heel effortlessly and took a step away from me.

“Come this way,” he said, already moving. “It’s flatter.”

I stayed where I was for a moment, watching his back. The suit bent strangely when he walked, the shapes sliding over each other without lining up. The siren sound came back, low and distant now, no longer circling. It pulled forward, like a thread being drawn tight. He stopped after a few steps and looked back at me.

“You don’t have to hurry,” he said. “I’ll wait.”

I stood there and stared. I glanced away from him up towards the endless wood in front of me. I looked down at him. I looked towards the expanse. How much bigger it was than I was. I followed him and thus began the latter half of my hike. The shadows hadn't advanced any further since his arrival, and yet the air changed as we went. Cooler it became. The chirping of the birds that had served as a soundtrack to my journey became silent, and my legs hurt less when I stepped where he stepped. I stopped thinking about the house, about my father, about how far I’d gone. The mountain narrowed around us, the trees thinning into dark rock. We came to a place where the ground dipped inward, opening into a wide, black mouth in the stone.

“This is better,” He said.  I peered inside, but there wasn't much to see. Railroad tracks disappearing into a black, still abyss. The opening was even, cut clean into the rock, and the air coming out of it was stale and flat, like a room that had been closed for a long time. Sound didn’t carry inside. It stopped at the edge, swallowed without echo. I peered inside, and I saw nothing, but I felt the warmth inside, and it would've been so nice to simply step inside and sit, and yet, as I began to approach, I was stopped as the man lowered the balloon so it brushed against my shoulder. 

“You know how to do this part,” he said.

I took the string without asking why. The cave's warmth disappeared instantaneously, and goosepimples returned to my skin. I looked at the man hesitantly. 

""My name is Sam.""

He said, and I nodded, and I faced the darkness of the cave inside as I approached it further. I glanced at Sam, and I glanced at the mine. There was a buzzing in my ear, and Sam's triangle eyes peered at me. I stepped forward and as I entered the mouth of the cave. The moment my foot crossed the threshold, my legs stopped. They refused to move any further. I leaned forward instinctively and felt the air change immediately. Again, it became warmer and heavier, carrying a damp sweetness underneath the smell of wet rot, and it made my stomach tighten. Somewhere deep inside the mine, I heard a loud shuffle, like some large stock shifting its weight. I tried to force my legs to move further, but nothing happened. I couldn't comprehend why I felt as if I needed to go further. 
 
“Julian,” a voice called softly. It came from far away, stretched thin by distance, but the way it said my name made my chest ache. It sounded achingly familiar, patient and maternal. Before I could answer, laughter rippled out of the darkness. High and uneven. It broke apart as it echoed, climbing the walls and collapsing back in on itself, growing louder and more hysterical the longer it went on. My legs still wouldn’t move. Fear rising in my throat and pounding against my heart, and yet I didn't move. The laughter multiplied as if the mine held thousands of people. I glanced to my left, and there stood a wooden post, and I looped the thin string of the balloon around the post and tied it taut. I looped it around the post and tied it tight, my hands working without instruction. I didn’t remember learning the knot, but it cinched down cleanly and held fast, the balloon bobbing once before settling, tugging gently toward the dark.

The laughter stopped all at once. The welcoming warmth of the mine drained from the air all at once, leaving my skin tight and prickling. The buzzing in my ears faded to nothing.  I turned back, and Sam stared at me blankly. I stepped away from the mine and back toward him. He extended his hand. In it were four berries, dark and round, their skins split slightly as if they’d been squeezed too hard. He took a fifth and pressed it into one of his triangle eyes. It burst softly, juice running down the pale surface of his face.

""Thank you very much."" He said, and I lifted a berry to my mouth, and I heard a scream from the mine behind me, and I spun to face it, and yet when I turned, I was met not with the entrance to the cave but with the creek I had passed all those hours ago. I glanced around, and it looked as if time had passed not at all.
 
I looked to my right towards my home, and I looked towards the creek again. I stood there silently for a few moments as my brain tried to process what had happened.  Failing to do so, I opted for loudly wailing and collapsing into a sobbing mess in the grass outside my home. I don’t remember how long I cried for, but I know it was long enough for my throat to hurt. Long enough for the grass beneath me to soak through my jeans. At some point, I felt hands on my shoulders, firm and shaking at the same time.

“Julian?”

My mother’s voice caught me off guard; it was the last voice I had expected to hear. I looked up. She was standing in the yard, her hair pulled back messily, her blouse wrinkled as she’d slept in it. My father was with her, breathing hard, his face pale and tight in a way I’d only ever seen once before, when he had left his credit card behind at a grocery store thirty minutes away. 

“Julian, sweetheart,” my mom said again, crouching in front of me. She put her hands on my face, turning my head side to side like she was checking for cracks. “Oh my God, honey."" Her breath seemed quick as she stumbled over her words, unable to figure out what to say first. ""Where.. where did you go?""

“I-” My mouth opened, and nothing useful came out. My teeth chattered. “I was just-”

My father knelt too, one knee sinking into the mud. “Jesus Christ,” he muttered, not angry or loud this time around. He pressed a hand flat against my back like he needed proof I was really in front of him.  I didn't understand their reaction even as my mother pulled me into her chest suddenly, hard enough to knock the air out of me. I smelled coffee on her breath. Old coffee. My mother didn't drink coffee. In fact, she complained about it often, hating even the smell. She drank coffee only once, when my grandmother was in the emergency room. 

“We were so scared,” she said into my hair. “Do you know that? We’ve been looking everywhere.”

I pulled back slightly and looked at her. I stammered and whimpered before I let out a “Why aren’t you at work?”

She froze, studying my face, just as confused as I was. My father answered instead. “You’ve been gone three days, Jules.”

That didn’t make sense. I shook my head, slow and stubborn. “No. I just- I was outside. I was playing, and I was gone for... I went into the...”

My mother made a small sound then, something between a laugh and a sob, and hugged me again. “No,” she said. “No, baby. You didn’t come home.”

My father stood and scooped me up like I weighed nothing at all. My legs wrapped around him on instinct. He held me tighter than he ever had before, like he was afraid I’d slip through his arms if he loosened even a little.

“It’s okay,” he said, over and over, his voice rough. “You’re home. You’re home.”

I rested my head against his shoulder and stared past them at the yard, at the house, at the creek beyond. Everything looked exactly the same as it had that morning. The sun sat in the same place. The world hadn’t moved at all.",1,1769075746.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

You ever notice how calm a child becomes when they’re coloring? The world goes quiet — no notifications, no background noise, no rush. Just crayons, creativity… and that little tongue poking out in concentration.  

That small moment reminds us of something we often forget: coloring isn’t just playtime, it’s mindfulness in disguise. It gives kids (and honestly, us too) a way to express emotions, focus their minds, and feel joy in something *simple*.  

Here’s something powerful most parents don’t realize:  
- Coloring reduces anxiety and builds emotional balance.  
- Bold, easy shapes boost confidence and independence.  
- Creative practice improves fine motor skills *way* more than scrolling screens does.  

When I realized this, I wanted to make something that helps more families rediscover that calm — so I created a **kids coloring ebook** built with soothing designs, fun characters, and easy-to-color scenes made *just* for little hands. It’s free for every parent, teacher, or caregiver who wants less stress and more smiles. 🎨  

👉 **Grab your free kids coloring ebook here:** [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)  

Each page invites kids to slow down, relax, and be creative — while giving parents a moment to sip their coffee in peace (you know how rare that is!).  

Teachers have told me their students focus better after 10 minutes of coloring. Parents say it’s now part of bedtime routines — more calm, fewer meltdowns. Those little wins matter.  

I believe creativity should never be gated by cost or circumstance. So I’m giving this ebook away with love — and hoping it finds families who need a sprinkle of calm right now.  

💛 **Claim your free copy here:** [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)  

If it helps even one child feel inspired — or one parent breathe a little easier — that’s a win for all of us.

I was getting food, I asked her if she wanted anything too and she said no so that was fine bc she's always like that, but then she insisted on staying in the dining area. Usually I just bring my food home or eat in the car since I used to get bullied for certain things, and I'm mainly over it but I'm still generally not alright with eating in public bc it's related to that. But I decided I'll still sit with her anyway since she doesn't get out much and there'd be no harm in it, but that I'd save the food for later.

We're sat for like 5 seconds and when she notices me not taking the stuff out of the bag she gets irrationally angry, starts yelling at me infront of other people and then just ran off to the bathroom.
She came back out after and started yelling threats that we're never going out again, she's never buying me anything again, etc etc but I just don't get it. I always feel extremely awkward and sorta guilty eating infront of someone that has nothing, so...❓

I started arguing back that we could've easily just sat there and talked, or she could've atleast have gotten a coffee, since her main issue is that we never get out/I always 'drag her back home'/I'm being uncivil. I'm a reserved person and when I go out I have a mental checklist of things I need to get/do, I don't like having company, and I don't see much reason to stay out once them things I had to do are done, which makes sense to me but idk what other people think. It's not just her really, some other people have been kinda weirded out by me being like this. Am I being rude??

If you’re planning a trip, here are some must-visit places based on vibe, scenery, and overall experience:

**1. Munnar (Kerala)** –  
If you love misty hills, tea gardens, and peaceful views, this place is unreal. Perfect for a calm getaway.

**2. Ooty (Tamil Nadu)** –  
Classic hill station vibes. Cool weather, toy train, and amazing scenery. Great for families and couples.

**3. Coorg (Karnataka)** –  
Coffee plantations, waterfalls, and chill vibes. Ideal if you want nature + relaxation.

**4. Alleppey (Kerala)** –  
Houseboats and backwaters = 10/10 experience. Super relaxing and different from hill stations.

**5. Hampi (Karnataka)** –  
If you’re into history and unique landscapes, Hampi is a must. Feels like walking through ancient ruins.

**6. Varkala (Kerala)** –  
Cliff-side beaches, cafés, sunsets. Way more peaceful than Goa (in a good way).

**7. Madurai (Tamil Nadu)** –  
Amazing temples and food. Great if you love culture and architecture.

For context, I live with my mom and my three siblings, and my parents are divorced since I was 9. I'm 23 now. I feel so tired of worrying about money since my parent's divorce until today and I can't even get mad at my mom because she's REALLY trying her best but things aren't just going our way. She was terminated at work around 5-6 months ago so we are currently REALLY struggling compared to how we used to struggle before.

I do take some jobs here and there (not like a part time job but more of a freelance) so my pay is below minimum wage and I got paid by the job that I do, so it's really not much and mostly can support myself for my daily expenses. Oh, and my dad still pays for child support btw but somehow it's just not enough. You know how childcare and basic necessities now are already too expensive in this economy.

So yeah it's bad to the point me and my sister below me had to scrape out of our own banks and cash for my mom to pay for her commitments like car, food, etc. You name it. I mean she's working really hard to find a job now but again, it's just our bad luck I guess so we really just had to hold on. We're basically surviving off my dad's money and luckily we're living in my grandparent's house. (My mom's parents)

I'm just so tired having to spend all my hard earned money just for us to survive. I swear I don't mind helping and giving some of it, but at this point it really has taken a toll on me. I sound like an entitled brat not wanting to help her mom but I swear I do. But I still feel frustrated that I don't get to enjoy my own money myself and having to spend it on my family. I mean at least it's good it's going to my family and being used for us surviving but still I just want to have my own money that I can spend, to buy silly stuff like coffees, or makeup, or something that makes me happy. Idk. I don't even mind those stuff to be honest but to be able to eat whatever I want with my own money??? Such an amazing feeling.

I have always been that kid who worries about money or how my parents will survive if I start buying useless stuff or things that I want instead of what I NEED. Even at times where my parents can support what I want I still feel some sort of financial guilt and convinced myself I don't need something until I really need something. It affected me till I am an adult now, and even with my own money, I knew not to use it or spend it at all because I knew somehow I need to have some money so that I could spare it for my mom for her to use when she's in need. But it's just tiring. Sometimes I really want to use my own money too for myself. One of the only few times I did is only for food. Never for stuff that I actually want. I treated myself to some good food that I couldn't eat usually like pizza for instance. But yeah. Sorry I'm rambling now lmao emotions are high now.

I feel so bad and frustrated, and even angry at myself for feeling like this. I as the eldest should always help my mom when all she did was sacrifice herself too. She really did everything for us and tried her really best but somehow life is just like this I guess. So yeah I'm angry, but idk to who. So it's back at me, feeling so angry at myself and frustrated. I just want to be able to survive and live a normal life like everyone else without worrying about money. Don't get me started for me being both of my parent's punching bags on talking sh\*t about each other but that's another story for another day. I just wanna get by today.

1qjq8c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1qjq8c6/how_comes_he_unmatched_me/,How comes he unmatched me?,"So yesterday I met a guy on OkCupid. We matched in early morning.

His first messages were

“When can I come to yours? 😘”

“I wanna go 3 rounds with you”

I told him we can first meet in Fenchurch Station which he agreed and said he will get me whatever I want.

We met around 5pm and had coffee. He then walked with me back to my flat which was about a 20 minute walk

When I first saw him I found him so attractive. Literally one of the most attractive guys I’ve seen.

Which made me upset that he unmatched me this morning. I’m almost in tears that he unmatched me

When he got in he sat down. He didn’t say anything sexual at all. We spoke about work and life. He lives alone. We both have our own places. He’s 25 im 31.

We just had a normal conversation. Nothing sexual. He was at mine for about 3 hours.

He noticed there was a Ring Security Camera recording us. I told him it was there for safety of both of us. He said it’s fine

Yesterday before he left, I asked him, “What did you expect to happen today? Did you expect to hookup?”

He replied “Yeah I thought something like that was gonna happen”

He said that “it doesn’t matter either way”

I just told him that due to being used in my past I’m more careful now. I don’t hookup asap.

Now that he’s unmatched me I feel upset . Part of me feels like maybe I should’ve hooked up but he would have left after as well.

But then I’m thinking maybe it’s a good thing I didn’t hookup with him? I would have probably fallen for him and he wouldn’t take me seriously.

My last message to him was “Hey I won’t lie I was really horny last night but I had to avoid being easy”

“Can we make plans to meet again and go for dinner sometime”

He read that and unmatched me.

He was so attractive to me. Just disappointed

EDIT: I really did want to have sex with him badly. He was so attractive. My body wanted him but my brains were telling me not to.

I’ve hooked up in my past which left me feeling used and violated . It lowered my self esteem.

I saw my friends partners spending money on them. And I felt like a free sex item/a pushover

He would have smashed and left me after as well

So I don’t know if I done the right thing by avoiding the hookup ?",0,1769074599.0,Bumble,8,0.25,False

1qjq4do,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qjq4do/night_shift_at_the_lodge_dont_look_back/,Night Shift at the Lodge: Don’t Look Back.,"The lodge was quiet, the road outside stretching black and empty under the moonlight. I leaned against my desk scanning the roster. Jerry came in from the break room, coffee in hand, but he didn’t set it down. He just stood there holding it like an anchor.

“Quiet night,” he said. His voice was lower than usual, almost swallowed.

“As always.”

I turned toward him, elbows on my knees. “I was thinking a lot about it… I know we’re not supposed to talk about what happened. I just need to know, ”

Jerry’s eyes flicked to the rear window behind me, then away so fast I almost missed it. “What are you on about?”

“Dan. What really happened to him? Why is he suddenly off the roster? Why didn’t he tell us why he left?”

He rubbed the inside of his left wrist with his thumb, hard, like he was trying to erase something under the skin. “You shouldn’t ask questions that have nothing to do with you.”

“I deserve to know, Jerry. We all do. How can I be sure I’ll still have a job tomorrow if people just… vanish? Why is everyone so goddamn quiet about it?”

He stared at the floor for a long beat. Then, quieter: “Dan didn’t follow the rules.” “What rules?” Jerry’s jaw worked. “You know the one.” “I don’t.” He swallowed. “Good.” A pause. His thumb kept circling that same spot on his wrist. “Dan looked back.” I waited. He didn’t elaborate. “So they fired him for breaking some bullshit rule?” Jerry finally met my eyes, only for a second, then looked past me again, toward the dark behind the booth. “You can make your own conclusions.” He set the untouched coffee on the desk like he was afraid to keep holding it. “Your job is to deny or give access. That’s it.”

I nodded, though the knot in my stomach said otherwise.

He grabbed his jacket. At the door he stopped, back to me. “I know you have questions, Drew. I get it.” His voice cracked on my name. “But if you ever feel it, that little tug, like someone just brushed the hair at the nape of your neck, don’t… don’t turn. Just radio in. Pretend you dropped your pen. That’s what I do now.”

The door clicked shut softer than it should have.

The abyss of the night settled in. Five executives expected. Verify plate, let them through. For rando’s, match the ID. Simple.

At 12:30 a.m. the first car rolled up. Executive clearance. Fancy black sedan, tinted windows. Gate open. Tires crunched over gravel like dry bones.

I stared straight ahead. My heart ticked too fast. The urge to glance in the side mirror was almost physical, but I forced myself not to.

Gate closed. Hydraulic hiss too loud.

There isn’t much to do in the gatehouse. No signal. No Wi-Fi. Radio checks in once an hour between midnight and 3:00, then every thirty minutes after. Most nights I write. Sketch. Read manga. Anything to stay awake.

Anything to pretend I don’t notice that every sound comes from behind me.

Not the front. Not the sides. Always behind.

A twig doesn’t snap, it shifts its weight, deliberate, directly behind my left ear. Leaves don’t drag across dirt, they scrape slowly across scalp. Wind doesn’t huff. It exhales against the short hairs below my collar, held too long.

A few hours crawled by. Another set of headlights. Executive again. As the car eased past, something flickered in the rear glass, a pale shape stretching longer than a hand should. I jerked my eyes forward. “Focus, Drew. Forward.”

2:15 a.m. No cars. Just the fluorescents humming and the clock ticking like someone counting down.

3:00 a.m. Headlights, slower, dimmer. Executive plate. Gate open. The car crept past. In the rear window: a palm flat against the tint. Then the fingers lengthened, stretching downward, tips thinning into threads that kept going after the glass ended.

I snapped my head forward. Hair on my arms stood up. The gate clanged shut.

“What the fuck was that?” I muttered.

The temptation to look back was a living thing in my chest. I picked up my pencil instead. Started sketching what I’d seen. Tendril fingers pressed against the window. Silhouette faint enough to doubt. Clear enough to understand.

I dropped the pencil. It clattered.

That’s when I noticed the paper.

Folded, tucked beneath the table, held by a wad of gum that was still warm. Damp. I crouched, peeled it free. The gum clung to my fingers longer than it should have.

Unfolded.

Handwriting barely legible, frantic, carved deep. Left edge torn ragged. Timestamps at the top of each paragraph.

**03:42** I hear it. It watches. I feel its fingers reaching… always behind me. I shouldn’t look. I don’t want to. But I have to. Every time it passes I feel it press against me. It moves slow. Deliberate. The gate hisses shut, trapping me in the cage with it. Metal on metal. I cannot turn my head yet I sense it closer each time. It wants me to see. It wants me to follow. Don’t turn. Don’t follow. But we will. We always do.

The radio crackled. “November Delta, please respond. Come in, November Delta. Do you copy?”

I’d missed the check-in. How? “This is November Delta… sorry… I didn’t hear the radio,” I stammered.

Clock read 03:42.

I kept reading. The second entry was worse. Letters overlapping, ink bleeding like something wet had touched the page after it was written.

**03:46** It called. No sight. I watched. I had to. It told me to. It would have taken me if I hadn’t run. I had to. It took them. Ate them. I could feel it crushing them, their screams trapped in the air I breathed. Even detached I could feel it. Hungry. Endless. All consuming. It let me run. Don’t turn. Don’t follow. But we will. We always do.

A scream tore through the forest behind the gatehouse. Not far. Not near. Present. Broken words stretched and moaned through the trees.

“Look. Look. Look.”

I clamped hands over my ears. Squeezed eyes shut. Light pulsed behind my lids.

Headlights cut the dark. Another executive car. I tore my hands away. The sound vanished. Silence rushed in, too complete.

I leaned forward to read the plate. My hand hovered over the controls. The button lit up on its own. The gate hissed open without me touching anything.

Tires didn’t crunch. They glided.

The rear window was empty this time. But the glass behind me, the booth’s rear window, fogged slowly. From the inside.

I didn’t turn.

The diary fluttered in my grip. I looked down.

A new line had appeared beneath the last entry. Handwriting shakier. Smaller. Still wet.

**03:51** It’s closer now. I can feel the heat from its mouth on the back of my skull. It doesn’t have lips. Just edges. It whispers my payroll number. The one I never told anyone. Don’t look, Drew. Please. I’m sorry I looked.

My name. In Dan’s handwriting.

The radio crackled again. “November Delta, status.”

I opened my mouth.

No sound came.

Because something was already in my throat, holding the words down. Not fingers. Not a hand. Just pressure. Steady. Patient. Like a palm the size of my skull cupping the back of my head from the inside.

Headlights appeared again. No plate light. Just two beams low to the ground, crawling.

The gate hissed open, again without me touching anything.

The car stopped. Passenger window down. Just an inch.

Enough to hear it breathing.

Not loud. Not quiet. Exactly the volume of my own lungs if I were sitting beside myself.

I feel the tug now. Not at my neck. Deeper. Behind my eyes.

I haven’t turned my head. I swear I haven’t.

But something behind me just said my name. Soft. Patient. Like it’s been waiting all night for me to notice it was already here.

The chair creaks. Just a fraction. Chairs aren’t supposed to turn on their own.

The radio crackles one last time.

“November Delta, copy that. All clear.”

I never answered.

But it logged me anyway.

My girl used to sleep PERFECTLY in her crib.  But when we moved last year she got a big girl bed, & ever since then she only sleeps in her bed for the first half of the night and then she sneaks into my room for the rest of the night.  At first, it was honestly really sweet.  I mean, I’m a single mom and being able to soak in these sort of moments feels special.  But in recent months, this cute little thing has become a thorn in my side.  I have no room because she tosses and turns (same as me lol).  She kicks me all night some nights or always has to be touching me.  It feels like I can’t relax in my own bed.  And when she goes to visit her dad, my brain can’t relax because she isn’t sleeping next to me.  I just end up fighting anxiety on those nights and wake up super early for church the next morning… so even on my nights off, I can’t get good sleep.

But tonight??  Tonight I woke up after two hours and thought I had slept for the whole night and I was relieved that the night was finally over because I felt so unrested.  When I checked the time and saw only 2 hours passed, I realized it needed to end tonight.  So, I walked her back to her room.  It’s taken an hour, but I think she’ll stay in there… the timing finally feels right because I didn’t feel frustrated & I was able to just be comforting and calm about it.

To give a bit of back story, I've struggled with AN for years. I know where it stems from. My mom is obese and had to get stomach surgery to avoid early death when I was growing up. I was never prone to obesity but seeing her struggle affected me so much.

On top of that, I was sexually, physically and mentally abused by a family member, including forcing me to eat stuff like a bee or dry coffee grounds until I finish or taking away my food. This family member became a model and also has AN (not diagnosed, but all the symptoms are there). 

Anyways, I can't help but judge fat people in my head. I understand when they're fat because of a medical condition but let's be real. That is rare as hell. You can be fat due to a medical condition or medication because it affects your appetite and then you eat a lot, but being fat from the condition itself is rare. Most just have overeating disorders. 

I don't feel anything negative towards fat people who are trying to get better. It is also an eating disorder afterall, but they usually tend to view it as nothing bad or even good while anorexics are viewed as some sickos to be stared at all the time and forcefed. 

When I see obese people on the street I feel a negativity towards them that I feel I cannot control. I don't say anything or do anything hateful, I just feel it. I get seriously frustrated when I can't walk past them or have to walk slowly behind them coz there's no space to walk around. Or when they sit next to me squeezing into my seat and heavy breathing. 

I don't want to be fatphobic, but I feel like I cannot properly sympathize with them and cannot control the negativity I feel.

I also unfortunately don’t speak Tamil, although I can understand it a little, would I struggle communicating in English? 

I tried enquiring online and through email's but unfortunately only few of the many manufacturers/Factories have responded, is it acceptable to walk into a factory/office and request a quick meeting or Tour? Or is that considered rude/unprofessional? I don’t want to start off on the wrong foot, but I also want to make the most of my trip.

Is there an active Uber community? Or should I rely on local autos/taxis? I have the specific addresses for the factories (mostly in the textile industrial areas), but I’m wondering if drivers generally know these locations by name, or if I need to rely strictly on Google Maps navigation.

1qjq0hn,https://i.redd.it/1g7kkfevbveg1.png,The Ultimate Guide to Necklace Lengths & Layering: Crafting Your Lifetime Stack,"**We believe your jewelry box is more than just a collection of gold and stones—it is a diary of your journey. Each piece marks a chapter, and necklace layering is how you tell your whole story at once.**

**But we know that creating the perfect ""curated stack"" can feel like a puzzle.** ***How long should a women’s necklace be? How do you measure length at home? And how do you stack them without the dreaded tangle?*** **In this guide, we’re breaking down the science of the stack so you can focus on the radiance of the moments they represent.**

# Part 1: How Necklace Length is Measured

Before you can build your stack, you need to understand the canvas. Necklace length is measured by the **total circumference of the chain** when it is unhooked and laid flat, from end to end (including the clasp).

# How to Measure Your Ideal Length at Home:

1. **The String Method:** Take a piece of string, wrap it around your neck to your desired hang point, and mark it. Measure that string against a ruler.
2. **The Existing Favorite:** Measure a necklace you already own and love to use as your ""base layer"" reference.

# Part 2: How Long Should a Women's Necklace Be?

In the world of jewelry, every length has a name, and every name carries a different vibe. While these categories provide a guide, remember: **at BuroLipo, we believe there are no limits—only expressions of your unique beauty.** Whether you are drawn to the intimacy of a choker or the drama of a rope chain, your choice is a declaration of who you are in this moment.

Here is a breakdown of the standard necklace lengths and the character they bring to your stack:

* **Collar (12"" - 13"") -** Sits tightly around the middle of the neck. It’s a bold, chic statement that feels vintage yet modern.
* **Choker (14"" - 16"") -** Sits at the very base of the neck. It is the perfect foundation for any stack, framing the face with an effortless ""Clean Girl"" aesthetic.
* **Princess (17"" - 19"") -** The most popular length for women, hanging just below the collarbone. It is the ideal home for your most meaningful pendants, like a sparkling cross or a cherished locket.
* **Matinee (20"" - 24"") -** Sits between the collarbone and the center of the bust. It offers a sense of professional grace and is perfect for layering over high-neck tops or business attire.
* **Opera (28"" - 34"") -** Hanging at the bustline or slightly below, this length radiates drama and elegance. It can be worn as a single long strand or doubled up for a layered look.
* **Rope (Over 35"") -** The ultimate expression of versatility. This extra-long length can be wrapped multiple times, knotted, or draped down the back for a sophisticated ""Old Money"" vibe.

# No Boundaries, Only Beauty

While the industry gives these lengths names, we give them **meaning**. You might choose a *Collar* to feel empowered during a presentation, or a *Rope* chain to feel free during a sunset beach walk. There is no ""right"" length—only the length that makes you feel radiant.

At BuroLipo, we provide the canvas; you provide the story. Whether you are building a stack of three or wearing a single statement piece, remember: **You aren't just wearing a necklace; you are declaring your presence.**

# Part 3: How to Necklace Stack: The BuroLipo Formula

Stacking is an art form that expresses your multifaceted personality. To achieve that effortless ""Pinterest-perfect"" look, follow our **Rule of Three**:

# 1. The Foundation (14"" - 16"")

Start with your most intimate piece. This is the layer that witnesses your morning coffee and your quietest reflections. Usually a thin, minimalist chain or a subtle texture.

# 2. The Soul (16"" - 18"")

This is where **how to layer a necklace** becomes personal. Place your ""meaning piece"" here—a symbol of faith, a graduation gift, or a self-reward.

* **Pro Tip:** Use a pendant with some weight (like a baguette diamond piece) to anchor the stack and keep it centered.

# 3. The Statement (20""+)

The final layer adds depth. A longer chain creates a visual frame for your other pieces.

# Part 4: Pro Tips: How to Layer Necklaces Without Tangling

The biggest pain point of a beautiful stack is the ""necklace knot."" Here is how to keep your story seamless:

* **The 2-Inch Rule:** Always leave at least a 2-inch gap between your layers (e.g., 16"", 18"", 20""). This prevents the chains from overlapping and clumping.
* **Mix Your Weights:** Pair a lightweight cable chain with a heavier link chain. The difference in weight helps the necklaces stay in their own ""lanes.""
* **The Material Matters:** Unlike standard plated jewelry that tangles easily due to static and poor finishing, BuroLipo’s **18K Gold PVD Coating** is smooth and durable.

# The BuroLipo Difference: Built for Your Forever

Why settle for a stack that turns green after one humid day? At BuroLipo, we create jewelry for the ""Main Character"" of a real-life story.

At BuroLipo, we understand that your jewelry needs to keep up with your lifestyle. For those who seek ultimate durability, we offer a dedicated collection crafted with **316L Stainless Steel and finished with 18K Gold PVD**. These specific pieces are designed to be **100% waterproof, sweat-proof, and tarnish-free**. Whether you are heading to your first big job interview or dancing on a sun-drenched graduation trip, our tarnish-free essentials are made to stay as radiant as your spirit, no matter where life takes you.

Chapter 01: When Trouble Walked In

ELLIE

I think being the only single person in a group of friends made up entirely of happy couples who have a lot of sex was affecting me, making me think it was time to find the right guy.

Not that I was really looking; I’d just promised myself not to go out with any more bastards or womanizers after everything I’d been through.

But that’s when the problem started—or rather, that’s when the problem walked through the door.

Ben’s younger brother, Ethan, walked into Zoe and Ben’s apartment during one of our gatherings, which involved drinking a lot of alcohol and catching up.

I hadn’t heard much about him. All I knew was that he ran the London office and was returning. Anna should have told me he was… *like that.*

Just by looking at him, I’d say he was the kind of guy I called a Wolf Charming. That was my antithesis to Prince Charming, who, in my mind, was what I didn’t want but probably should want. But I always thought Prince Charmings were too perfect and, consequently, boring.

The Wolf Charming was my ideal type—the kind who has wild sex with you and takes you roughly, but who has that charming side and treats you like a princess the rest of the time.

That was the impression the tall, broad-shouldered man with dark blonde hair gave me when he walked into the room, dressed in a suit on a Saturday. He looked too elegant and at the same time fierce and virile.

“Wolf Charming?” I whispered to Anna as we moved closer to greet him with the rest of the group.

Anna, my best friend, was probably the main reason I had this idea of finding the right guy stuck in my head.

Not that she had told me to do it, but simply because she was married to Will, the hottest and sexiest tattooed ex-player and nerd I had ever met. They were perfect together.

I was still trying to convince the two of them to donate some of Will’s DNA, so I could clone him in a lab. I always say it’s unfair that there’s only one Will. Anna hit the jackpot, and of course, so did Will.

“Bastard Charming, from what I’ve heard from Will,” she whispered back.

My smile faded instantly. Not that I judged before getting to know someone—I didn’t do that; I hated stereotypes and typification as a good scientist should—but hearing that would put any smart woman on guard.

In recent months, I’d worked hard to stay away from any womanizers, bastards, and players in New York.

Swallowing the last sip of beer, I leaned forward, placing the bottle on the coffee table before it was my turn to greet the man with striking light brown eyes. He was a good twenty centimeters taller than me, even in heels.

My stomach churned as I forced a smile in response to his, which revealed perfect teeth.

*Damn… he’s fucking gorgeous.*

I blinked, trying to snap out of the trance.

“Nice to meet you, Ethan. I’m Ellie. Welcome back to New York,” I said, offering my hand while my heart pounded in my chest.

I ignored that, along with the shiver that ran down my spine. Maybe it was because everyone around us was staring with some strange expectation, as if something screamed, two single people in the room, not just me as always.

“Nice to meet you, Ellie.” He shook my hand firmly.

I tried to ignore the quick once-over he gave me, spending way too much time focusing on my breasts. I pulled back as soon as he let go of my hand.

Ben, Will, and Jack gathered on the sofas after Ethan’s arrival, and I pulled Anna into the kitchen for another drink.

“His eyes are just like Ben’s,” she commented.

Yeah, those brown eyes were hypnotic.

“So is the reputation, I mean, before he married Zoe,” I said, making us both laugh. “But don’t let her know I brought that up. She’d eat me alive.”

Zoe and Bennett, or simply Ben, were another couple in my group of friends who were probably influencing me, though I think in a slightly *different* way than Anna and Will.

That’s because both of them were assholes who fell in love before they could kill each other. I don’t know how they’re still alive, maybe because they took out all their anger on each other through sex.

“He checked out your boobs,” Anna said as we entered the kitchen.

Stifling a laugh, she leaned against the island while I got busy opening two beers.

“You managed to notice that? I thought it was in a split second.”

“I think everyone noticed.”

“Ugh! Why was everyone staring?”

“Maybe because you’re the only singles in the room? That makes it interesting to watch when you’re married.”

“Do you really need to remind me? And it’s not like anything’s going to happen between us.”

“I know, I know. No scumbags, bastards, or womanizers. I’ve been hearing that for over a year now?”

“And you’ll keep hearing it until I find the right guy.” I handed her one of the beer bottles.

“To the right guy! May he show up soon!” She raised her bottle, proposing a toast, forcing me to do the same. “And end your bad mood with lots of sex!” she concluded.

“Hey! What bad mood?”

“Excuse me!” The deep voice sounded before he entered the kitchen.

His presence alone was enough to make me uncomfortable.

“Mind if I find Ben’s wine stash?” he asked, making Anna turn to face him.

“I’ll help you,” she offered, guiding him to the wall-mounted wine rack behind me.

I took a long sip of my beer, getting lost in my own thoughts as they discussed wines behind me.

“What do you Morgans take? I know Bennett goes to the gym almost every day, but nothing justifies you growing that much, not just in height,” Anna suddenly said, nearly making me spit out my beer.

God! She, as always, with no filter. I heard him let out a low laugh.

“You’re the scientist, right? Then you can explain genetics.”

“I think there are some things that even scientists like us can’t explain, right, El?” she said, forcing me to turn to them.

“Of course! Whatever you’re talking about, I’m with you.”

“So, you’re also a scientist?” He raised an eyebrow at me.

“Yes, more of a researcher these days.”

“I admit, I had a very different image of scientists in mind,” he said, not bothering to hide the way his eyes moved over my body, leaving me uneasy.",1,1769073611.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

SHE was staring, blank against the wall. It had been 2 months since she was discharged from the hospital.

Her mom knocked. “Coffee, sweetie?”

She shut her eyes, and put her best mask on. Smile as wide as a child, eyes as innocent as an infant. After all, her mom was just trying her best.

“Thanks Mom!” She smiled.

Her mom looked at her, satisfied at how well she looked on the outside. She planted a kiss on her daughter’s forehead and left the room.

With her mom gone, SHE continued staring at the wall. Then her head gave a little jerk and her eyes changed.  She pulled a notebook out from under the pillow. And continued scribbling.

“Bastard”

“Fuck you”

“You deserve to be castrated”

She tore the page, made a bundle and flung it against the wall. And looked at the coffee, piping hot.

She took a sip, her eyes slowly staring at the torn paper.

She pulled out a fresh page and then wrote a single line.

“I won’t make you pay. But SHE will.

I will take away the one thing you love the most.”

It was then, her hands steadied. Her eyes darkened. But did not change.

To the outside world, the change was almost imperceptible.

But to the inner corners in her mind, a story had begun.

A story, meshed with the deepest hatred, she felt for the one.. she had almost…. almost….

I sometimes assume that they can because the looks on the types who do this and go out smelling like this have strong resemblances to people who are so absolutely self-centered and narcissistic that they think that the world should bow down at their toes and put up with their vastly and immensely inappropriate smells and behaviors.

So it's always the problem types that you notice this the most with.

However I'm having problems with my family 'Claiming' my car.

So going back two months my mum's car broke down and she ended up having to scrap it, ever since she's been driving my grandmas car around,  mainly to work and my dad had to drop me off at work, pick me up as well as my other siblings. I got a bit sick of it and I knew I was going to pass my test soon so I wanted to buy a cheap little car for a beginner which I had fully saved for myself and had been looking for.

Finally I found the perfect first little car around the end of December and drove an hour to look at it, buying it later that afternoon, it was a really good deal for the miles and the make of the car so I knew I was super lucky and the previous owner had replaced some parts making it brand new so I was really happy. 

After December I picked it up with my dad and came home and my grandma started saying ""Oh thank god we really needed that car, I'll have to drive it"" which is 100% fine I knew when I brought it I obviously wouldn't drive it yet apart from practicing for my test. My family needed it and that was fine but then she started saying, ""I'll have to claim it Tuesday and Friday I need it and for the mornings and afternoons to pick up your siblings from school"" I found it a bit annoying because she was saying this just as I walked in the door and got extremely frustrated because even thought I knew we were struggling and I didn't mind her using it I wanted to experience it for myself and she has a habit of dirtying cars so I was nervous about it. 

She then got mad at me and we got in a little argument, I just told her I wanted her to keep it clean and don't get it muddy when she has her friends dog in there and she said I had to live with it. I said ""Don't mess it up I just want it clean"" and she basically said ""That's life"" I got so angry because, yes it is but I just got the car, even now to this day it is dirty.

Cut to now and I have passed my driving test as I said at the start and I'm really excited I can finally have freedom to drive and explore!! Or so I thought...

 I was planning to take myself alone to the shopping mall and have a drive to feel more comfortable in my car and my grandma said she needed to it go to her friends house for tea. I said I wanted to drive and she kept bumbarding me with questions and that she was taking her own car and I'd still have mine but I'd have to take my mum places if she wanted to go out, I just said okay and accepted that I wasn't going to mall and i could just drive somewhere else and chill in a coffee shop but no. 

I woke up the morning of my plans and my grandma came in my room saying ""I'm taking your car I'll be back by 1pm"" I asked why she was taking mine and not hers and she said ""Your mom wanted to use my car to go out for a coffee"" I genuinely cried after she left because I feel like I don't own the car anymore, and I have no right to drive it.

India is one of the biggest markets for FMCG products in the world. Every day people use soaps, biscuits, toothpaste, tea, snacks, cooking oil, and many more items without even thinking where they come from. Behind all these daily-use products, there are FMCG manufacturers working quietly. Some are big companies known across the country. Some are smaller but still important in their regions.

In this blog, we will talk about what FMCG really means, why FMCG manufacturing is important in India, and who are some of the leading [FMCG manufacturers](https://eliteconinternational.com/food-and-bevarage). This is not a perfect technical article, but a simple guide for anyone who wants to understand this industry better.  


# What is FMCG and Why It Matters

FMCG means Fast Moving Consumer Goods. These are products that sell fast and at low cost. People buy them regularly, sometimes daily. For example, shampoo, soap, bread, biscuits, tea, coffee, cold drinks, and packaged food.

FMCG industry matters a lot in India because of the huge population. Millions of people buy these products every single day. Even small price changes can affect large number of customers. Also, FMCG companies give jobs to many people, from factory workers to sales staff to delivery persons.

# Growth of FMCG Manufacturing in India

In the last 20–30 years, FMCG manufacturing in India has grown very fast. Earlier, people mostly used local brands. Now, there are both Indian and international brands everywhere.

Better roads, better supply chain, and rising income helped FMCG companies grow. People now prefer branded products for quality and safety. Also, online shopping and quick delivery apps made FMCG reach more customers, even in small towns.

Government support and “Make in India” campaign also helped many FMCG manufacturers to set up plants in different states.  


# Key Features of Leading FMCG Manufacturers

Top FMCG manufacturers in India share some common things.

First, they focus a lot on product quality. Since people use these products daily, trust is very important.

Second, they invest in wide distribution network. Their products are available in big cities, small towns, and even villages.

Third, they keep launching new products or new flavors to stay ahead in competition.

Lastly, they do strong marketing. Ads, social media, and celebrity endorsements play a big role in FMCG success.



# Leading FMCG Manufacturers in India

There are many FMCG manufacturers in India, but some names are very well known.

**Elitecon International**  
Elitecon International is a name that many people might not know yet, but it is growing fast in the FMCG space. They work on producing quality consumer goods with modern standards. Their focus is on reliable products and quick delivery to wholesalers and retailers. Many small shops trust their products because Elitecon keeps quality consistent and price fair. For many regions, Elitecon’s items are becoming part of everyday shopping lists.

**Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL)**  
HUL is one of the biggest FMCG companies in India. It makes products like Lux, Surf Excel, Rin, Lifebuoy, Dove, and many more. Their products are in almost every Indian home.

**ITC Limited**  
ITC started mainly as a tobacco company but now it has a big FMCG business. It sells biscuits, noodles, chips, spices, and personal care products. Brands like Sunfeast, Aashirvaad, Bingo, and Yippee are very popular.

**Nestlé India**  
Nestlé is known for food products. Maggi noodles, Nescafé coffee, KitKat chocolates, and Milkmaid are common names. They focus a lot on food safety and nutrition.

**Dabur India**  
Dabur is famous for ayurvedic and herbal products. It makes chyawanprash, honey, hair oil, toothpaste, and health supplements. Many people trust Dabur for natural products.

**Britannia Industries**  
Britannia is one of the top biscuit manufacturers in India. It also makes bread, cakes, and dairy products. Brands like Good Day, Marie Gold, and Little Hearts are very popular.  


# Role of Regional FMCG Manufacturers

Not all FMCG manufacturers are big national brands. Many regional companies also play an important role.

In some states, local brands are more popular because people trust their taste and pricing. For example, local snack brands, spice companies, and dairy producers.

These regional FMCG manufacturers understand local preferences better. They also give tough competition to big brands in smaller towns.



# Challenges Faced by FMCG Manufacturers

FMCG manufacturing is not easy. There are many challenges.

One big challenge is rising raw material cost. Prices of sugar, milk, wheat, and oil keep changing. This affects product pricing.

Another problem is tough competition. New brands are launching every year. Companies need to work hard to keep their market share.

Logistics and transportation also create issues, especially for perishable goods.

Also, changing customer behavior is a challenge. People are becoming more health-conscious and want sugar-free or organic products.  


# How FMCG Manufacturers Are Adapting

To handle these problems, FMCG manufacturers are changing their strategies.

Many companies are launching healthy products like low sugar biscuits, organic spices, and herbal shampoos.

They are also using digital marketing more. Social media ads, influencer marketing, and online discounts are common now.

Automation in factories is helping reduce cost and improve quality.

Some companies are also focusing on eco-friendly packaging to reduce plastic waste.  


# Opportunities in FMCG Manufacturing

Despite challenges, FMCG manufacturing in India has many opportunities.

Rural markets are still growing. More people in villages are buying branded products now.

E-commerce is opening new sales channels. People can order groceries online easily.

Young population and changing lifestyle means demand for ready-to-eat food and snacks will increase.

Also, exports of Indian FMCG products are rising, especially spices, snacks, and ayurvedic products.

# Conclusion

The FMCG manufacturing industry in India is big, diverse, and full of energy. From large companies like Elitecon, HUL and ITC to small regional brands, everyone plays a role.

People depend on FMCG products every day, so this industry will always stay important. With new technology, better supply chains, and changing customer needs, FMCG manufacturers will keep evolving.

If you are planning to enter FMCG business or just want to understand how your daily products are made, knowing about leading FMCG manufacturers in India is a good start.

The future of FMCG in India looks strong, even with all the ups and downs. It is an industry that never stops moving, just like the products it makes.",1,1769072839.0,u_Scared-Guarantee-706,0,1.0,False

Me and my gf have now been together for almost 2,5 years. We love each other very much and want to grow old together. She lives 1,5 hours drive away and we both have kinda busy lifes so we see each other most of the time just 1 night and 1 morning a week. She always hated men and how they act and is sometimes still surprised how she fell in love with me, but she does really love me. She didnt have much friends when i first met her and really never a good genuine friend. But since last summer she met a guy while doing motorcycle lessons. And The guy had his motorcycle license in 1 try but my gf the second try and she had to wait months tot try again. So that guy had his license and a motorcycle and my gf did not yet. and they were texting a little bit and decided to go for coffee sometimes and a motorcycle ride. After a few months they were becoming friends and hanging out more often like once or twice a week and sometimes go to a rave together. And with the time goes by they were becoming beter friends and hanging more with each other. I didnt really mind yet because she always said we are like brother and sister and he said the same thing. And she has a good friend finally were she also can to raves with because i dont really like raves. Al this was like 2,5 months ago and me and gf would still call almost everyday after work before going to sleep. But nowadays she almost hangs out everyday with him after work. most of the time they drink coffee or go to a cafe to drink a couple of beers. and in the weekends they go on city trips or go shopping. me and my gf still see each other as much as we can but it is still once a week most of the time. Since a month ago we have been calling a lot less but she is with him until 11 in the evening drinking beers or coffee at a cafe. so i talked to her about my feelings and that i feel uncomfortable that she is so close with him. but she says that okay and that something for you to work on, but i wanna live my life and do things. she doenst wanna be old and regret all the things she didnt do. but now she wants to go to a rave with him and his group of friends. they also go with that group to other raves. but also sleep in a hotel after the rave or sleep at a friends house. i said that is to much and i dont want that and i offered to pick her up after the rave and bring her home. but she said that is unfair against her friends and not nice. but she said i wont sleep after the rave with a annoyed attitude and said that i have a valid point. and she is also thinking of going on a vacantion with him and that group of friends. and i said i dont know about that yet and she responded with: i am going to that. i wanna travel and see the world. and not only with you but also with friends. i also asked if i could meet him but she said thats okay but i wont set up a meet, if you meet him by coincidence then so be it. but she prefers to keep her bf part of life and her friends part of life separated. but she also says it is because of her and that the good friend always asks if i wanna join with a coffee or rave. but she doenst want that. i think she is scared i will get more jealous if see how well they get along with each other. i also feel like she has less interest in my life and doenst pay attention to the details of my life. like i told her i have an important test for school. but she never wished me luck on the day it self or asked how it went, but she did do it before. it all just feel uncomfortable to me and i always have this feeling in my stomach. i really wanna give her the freedom in living her life with friends and i know she wont cheat, i trust her. but how can i live with that uncomfortable feeling? or how can i find a middle way so that she still can hang with the good friend but i wont get eaten up but that uncomfortable feeling?

Sorry for my bad english, i hope you get the whole story because we both dont do anything wrong but it is really difficult also because of the distance. because when we are calling or text we sometimes argue and sometimes it is okay. but when we see each other in real life we always make up and it is good.

She was asked out to go on a date and she checked in with me to see if that was okay. I played it off as it that didnt bother me. But I was incredibly jealous the days leading up to it. And when it finally happened I was high and let my insecurities completely consume me. I asked her if she had sex with him, she said yes. I was so cruel to her and went ballistic in a way I never had been before I accused her of cheating and cussed her out.

It was so bad that she was the one trying to console me and that came across as fake to me bc I believed she had sex with somebody she just met. I didnt sleep that night and threw up constantly. I went to uni on 3 cups of coffee. She reached out to me again that morning and all I felt was disgust and dissapointment. Then she told me what really happened that night.

The whiplash I had was insane, and I immediately tried to support her and find resources. But she doesnt view me the same anymore. And I dont know what to do because shes extremely alone and has no support. Im concerned and love her so deeply. I take full accountability for my actions and theres nothing I can do to redeem myself for that. She doesnt want me to be her life anymore. Im not sure where to go from here. And im not sure why im telling this here or what im looking to gain. I wasnt there for her in the moment she needed me most.",1,1769072135.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

This same scenerio keeps happening to me. I'll be pulling up to drop something off and a flood of crappy new offers come pouring in as I'm trying to communicate with my customer.  I always try to get to the screen where I can stop incoming orders, but I swear it's like my app won't respond. I'm banging on my phone screen trying to the stop incoming orders button. I know where it's at, but for some reason, my app won't let me get there. I end up having to decline a bunch of offers and tank my AR just to be able to respond to my customer. I've also accidentally accepted offers I really didn't want in the first place. I had to deliver a literal can of soda on the other side of the interstate the other day because of this nonsense. (I know I could have cancelled but we all know that we can't really cancel anything because we have to save our cancellation rate for stolen orders.)

Am I crazy or does anyone else have this problem? It's really stressing me out. My market doesn't have a coffee button so really my only option is using that stop incoming orders button but it just seems like the app won't respond when I actually need it to.     

I really wish we had the coffee button here because stop incoming orders requires me to take selfies all of the time. I know that's not a big deal for most folks, but I deliver on a bike at night in the cold weather. That means I have to find a place with adequate lighting, take off my balaclava, neck gaiter, beanie, heated head band, and my bicycle helmet to take the selfie, then put all of my layers back on. It's also really cold here, so doing that is a big pain in my ass. I'm also concerned that one day it's not going to recognize me since people have mentioned that's a possible issue. 

I'm to the point now where I'm really considering stopping all incoming orders after ever acceptance just so I don't keep getting hammered with these distractions. It's bad enough trying to ride my bike in the snow in a big city. The last thing I need is the app constantly going off. I know if I decline one offer, it's going to continue to bombard me until I either accept one or finally get the stop incoming requests screen to come up. Don't get me wrong, I love being busy and getting orders, but it's just really stressful when I'm trying to do something and it won't leave me alone for long enough to text my customer that their stupid door code won't work or whatever else I need to communicate to them.

I’ve recently moved to Christchurch and realised pretty quickly that starting fresh in a new place can be both exciting and… a little lonely 😅 I don’t really know many people here yet, so I thought I’d put myself out there and see what’s happening socially around town.

A bit about me: I’m in my 40s, easy-going, enjoy good conversations, coffee or drinks, live music, exploring new spots, and getting outdoors. I’m keen to meet new people — whether that’s new friends, activity buddies, or just people to grab a beer with and chat.

I’d love some recommendations for:

– Good bars / cafes where people are actually open to talking

– Social groups, clubs, or regular meetups (sports, walking groups, trivia nights, etc.)

– Events that are good for newcomers to meet others

If you’ve moved here recently yourself, how did you meet people? And if you’re a local, what would you recommend for someone new trying to build a social circle?

Also totally open to meeting up with other newcomers — always nicer to explore a new city with company 🙂

Too much half-interest, unclear intentions and “let’s see where it goes” energy. I value clarity over convenience and intention over attention. I’m open to a slow burn, but I date exclusively and with purpose—no ambiguity disguised as casual.

I believe real connections can still happen online if both people are honest and aligned. I’m not here to rush. If you can’t be upfront about who you are or what you want, please don’t meet me halfway.

About Me

\- 5’0 short battery ball inked red hair Fil-Chi.

\- Currently 71kg

\- Working while studying med overseas (try mo subukan. ginagawa kong kabilang state lang ang Ph), home for vacation

\- I enjoy good coffee and better conversations.

\- Bubbly, a certified yapper, but only if there’s substance. I do have vices—so if that's a deal breaker for you hope you find what you're looking for.

I love books, emo music (OPM & international), 80s love songs, and a little genggeng. Kanal-aircon energy with dark humor, soft for road trips, late-night drives, and hidden coffee shops. I wanted to try hiking & free dive too, so I hope you can introduce me into that!

Attended big motoring world Leeds due to seeing a reasonably priced Audi. The service was good to begin with, advisor was nice and friendly. However after the test drive when it came to buying the car things turned. The advisor was constantly trying to add on extras such as the warranty, which did sound useful. However, after a quick google search it we apparent that this product isn’t what it’s cracked up to be. After declining nunerous times the advisor then brought out his manager to shove this down my throat even more. It was unbelievably pressured and ridiculous. They even started to belittle me in hope that I would take it out saying ‘I don’t know your financial ISSUES’. I was buying the car pcp with a better deal from my bank which they weren’t impressed with either.  
  
I ended up walking out in the end as the insults and pressure was massive red flags. I am so glad I did after reading reviews online of this company.  
I ended up buying my car through an Audi dealership and it was night and day. Audi were spot on. Please please look at the reviews and do your research before committing to a car with this company. The prices are definitely low for a reason.

If I could give one star I would. I love my car but the service was horrendous from aggressive sales people trying to push their finance products on someone who wanted to pay cash and pretending to have applied a protector that takes over an hour to apply in 20 minutes so that they could charge me for it rather than refund me as it wasn't done in time for my agreed collection time. The rush application job that I had been clear that I didn't want started - as I had to collect my daughter - was done when I went to tax the car. As a result, I drove away in a car that smelled like fumes and was sticky as the protector wasn't dry and, to add insult to injury, I was late to pick up my daughter and incurred a fine. I will be putting in a formal complaint. Utter charlatans.

I would leave 0 stars if I could, absolute shambles of a company, car has a fault that’s of course not covered under warranty, waited for a recorded phone call to be sent to me after basically being called a liar, waited a week for the manager to authorise it, now all of a sudden that one recorded phone call has gone missing, what a coincidence! Hope the place gets shut down from all the posts I’ve now seen about them, wish I’d done my research!

Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. Dishonest and outright liars. Was agreed before the sale that two Tesla chargers would be provided in the sale. When it got to the handover after payment had been made and confirmation which needed my signature it stated only 1 charger. I explained to the lady doing the handover that it was agreed 2 Tesla chargers would be provided. She said that's fine, crossed out the 1 and changed it to 2. Once I was ready to drive away and they had taken over £20k from me, I was then advised that they had no more Tesla chargers left and I was given a standard one, which was not agreed. However it was 9pm at this point and I had been in the showroom for nearly 6 hours at this point. I said I would take it for now but would expect an official Tesla one as promised to be delivered. Since then I have contacted the business and they now refute this and I receive AI responses. They showed the document that I had signed and said I had agreed to the sale, despite not being made aware until after I had paid and signed that the charger was not available! Responses are clearly AI generated and they do not read the actual email.

Attended to test drive a vehicle. I was not approached once by a single sales person. For that reason I cancelled the test drive and went and bought a car from another dealership. Customer service is everything when buying a big purchase and sadly this company do not provide this.

PLEASE SCREENSHOT THIS HONEST REVIEW AND REPORT TO TRUST PILOT IF IT GETS REMOVED WHICH PROVES THAT EVERYTHING I HAVE WRITTEN IS TRUE!!!  
This score is completely inaccurate!! Big Motoring World always try to get the 1\* negative reviews removed and most of the time are successful! If you look at any other review site for this dreadful company they are mainly negative! 5\* reviews are forced to be left before customers leave the site!  
Please Google BIG MOTORING WORLD REVIEWS and read the honest AI summary. Then buy a car elsewhere!!  
Recently had their Trust Pilot account suspended due to paid for fake 5\* reviews! Got it reinstated by saying it is under new management but a quick Google search exposes this as more blatant lies!!  
Get many honest 1\* reviews removed!  
I walked out of the Enfield branch due to the attitude of the sales staff. Trying to get you to take out finance dispite being a cash buyer. Hard sell on warranty which if you read other 1\* reviews is totally useless if you try to claim. GardX protection for £700! only £20 on eBay. Wheel and tyre cover lol just try to claim everything is wear and tear!  
I joined Facebook group "" Big Motoring World Complaints"" with over 8000 unhappy customers and growing! Most people are rejecting their cars within 30 days which under consumer law you can do but BigMW say they cannot which is a blatant lie!  
Please read the honest 1\* reviews. None of the cars have the fictitious 200 point check more lies.  
Here is the information on Big Motoring World when you look up BIG MOTORING WORLD REVIEWS reviews on Google.  
  
Reviews for Big Motoring World are highly negative, with customers reporting issues such as the sale of dangerous and unroadworthy vehicles, poor customer service, being pressured into purchases, and problems with refunds. There are numerous documented cases of customers finding serious, undisclosed faults with cars shortly after purchase, and complaints suggest the company's advertised ""200-Point Vehicle Inspection"" is often not a thorough check. The company has even been suspended from Trustpilot for offering incentives for positive reviews.  
Common Customer Complaints  
Unsafe Vehicles:  
Many customers report being sold cars with significant, unroadworthy faults, such as worn brakes, dangerous steering issues, and other damage that was hidden from them.  
Poor Customer Service:  
Staff have been described as having bad attitudes, being unhelpful, lying about car history, and pressuring customers into buying add-ons or making a purchase.  
Dishonest Practices:  
Some customers feel they were deceived about the true condition of the vehicle or its history, with a significant discrepancy between the company's claims and the reality.  
Difficulty with Returns/Refunds:  
There are widespread reports of customers experiencing significant difficulty in obtaining refunds or having the company take back cars with serious faults.  
Misleading Inspections:  
The promised ""200-Point Vehicle Inspection"" has been questioned, with claims that only a fraction of these points are actually checked.  
Evidence of Issues  
Suspension from Trustpilot:  
Big Motoring World was suspended from Trustpilot in August 2025 for offering monetary incentives to encourage positive reviews, a breach of their guidelines.  
Customer-led Complaint Groups:  
There are active Facebook groups where customers share their experiences and seek advice, highlighting the extent of the issues.  
Media Reports:  
YouTube videos and articles on sites like Car Dealer Reviews detail extensive negative experiences.  
Recommendation  
Based on the volume and severity of negative reviews, it is strongly advised to exercise extreme caution if considering buying a car from Big Motoring World.  
Totally dishonest company. Your hard earned money! Your choice.

I’m a 27M, around 200 lbs, and I’ve been on Strattera for about two months now. I started at 40 mg for two weeks, then went straight to 80 mg, which I’ve been on for the last six weeks. I did take about a week off around Christmas and New Year’s because the side effects were rough and I wanted to enjoy the holidays, but I restarted on January 2nd.

Most of the initial side effects have faded, but two big ones are still hanging around: **fatigue** and, more importantly, **fragmented sleep**.

I usually spend around 8 hours in bed, but according to my smart ring, only about 6–6.5 hours of that is actual sleep. Subjectively, it feels like I’m waking up almost every hour — not fully awake, but enough to break my sleep over and over again.

I’ve tried playing around with the dosing schedule: full dose in the morning, full dose at night, and splitting the dose morning/evening. None of it has made a noticeable difference.

I’ve also cleaned up my lifestyle pretty aggressively. I cut caffeine from about 4 coffees a day down to 2. I also completely cut out alcohol this year, which normally makes me sleep *better*, not worse. Still no improvement.

What’s confusing me the most is that this side effect seems to be getting **worse over time**, not better. Early on, my sleep was at least manageable — waking up maybe 2–3 times per night. Now it feels like constant micro-awakenings throughout the night.

It makes me wonder if this is just how my brain reacts to increased norepinephrine. For some context, I actually slept *better* on 54 mg of Concerta than I do on Strattera.

At this point, I’m honestly questioning whether this medication is worth it. The pros so far are lower anxiety and a slightly calmer baseline, but in terms of focus, I feel little to no improvement.

On top of that, my blood pressure and resting heart rate are clearly elevated. My sleeping heart rate went from low-40s pre-Strattera to low-50s consistently since starting it.

So my question is: does this ever go away? Has anyone else experienced sleep getting worse the longer they stayed on Strattera? I’d really appreciate hearing from people who’ve been in a similar situation, especially if the sleep issues eventually resolved — or didn’t.",1,1769071210.0,StratteraRx,4,1.0,False

1qjpawt,https://www.reddit.com/r/RSwritingclub/comments/1qjpawt/tipping_point/,Tipping Point,"Before the second drink slid down my throat I was a mess. Purely wretched, filled with diabolical malaise. Shaking like the West Coast and sweating like the Amazon. Thick, putrid drops of beaded ammonia slid down my wrinkled forehead and practically served as nature’s bitters; a splash or two in the gin won’t hurt anyone. The first one settled my fingers but didn’t do much as far as the brain was concerned. If anything, it made me more irritable. A taste of what I wanted turned my little demons feral. What a disgrace. And it’s only noon or so.

I’m lurking in the kitchen in front of my father. He’s left a knife on the tipping point of the sink in case another peanut sandwich entices him. I’m shivering from my abstinence but I’m on my way. My hands are hot and the fridge cools them while I wait for him to pass. He surely heard me kick the freezer shut. That’s why he hasn’t said anything. Yellow mustard stares me down. Do I take a squirt to cover up the smell? Will he notice if I walk by stinking like a mouthful of condiments? A hotdog? His nose isn’t sharp, never has been. I would have been grounded more often as a teenager. Where’s the leftovers? Maybe my breath won’t make its way to the coffee pot.

Pass the milk, he says, and shut the door if you’re not going to eat anything.

I’m just looking for a snack, I reply, almond or regular?

Almond’s your moms.

Alright, here you go. My hand extends as far as the sink and I duck back into the lower centigrade again. I can tell he’s looking at me through the insulation. Superman vision, MRI accuracy.

You alright? He shuffles towards me.

Yeah, just hungry.

We have crackers, I think, mom’s out shopping, she’ll be back in an hour. His hand is on my back, and it’s going in circles. A bit handsy for the morning.

I got it, thanks. I move deeper into the fridge and grab a yoghurt tub. Shrug my shoulder. Vanilla bean. Dad’s lurking still but against the island now. His flip flops dragging. Pass a spoon? I ask.

Sure. The drawer slips open and the mustard glares at me again next to the Caesar sauce. My right hand grazes the bottle but there’s not enough time.

You sure you’re alright? He hands the spoon over. Our eyes do not meet.

Fine, yeah. The tub is full of spaghetti. Last week Tuesday.

Might not want to eat that, dad suggests.

I dip my nose in to smell it, turn around. Is it bad?

Toss it. Want a sandwich? His back is towards me. He’s reaching for a loaf on top of the microwave. His ankles are extended and his calves are flexed below his bathrobe. The knife tips into the sink and clatters on the drain. I jump. He laughs. What are you so shaky for? That spoon’s practically bent, you’re jittering so much.

It scared me, that’s all.

You’ve been shaking and staring at the fridge since I came down here. Have sandwich, you’re probably hungry.

Him, the mustard, and the stairs are gawking at me individually. Three options in front of me, but why are those the fucking options? Run, mask, or lean in. What’s he gonna say? What’s the harm in sitting with the man? My dad? He’s right, the spaghetti is rattling at a microwave level of vibration in my hand. And it’s not appealing; in fact, it stinks. I shut the door and toss the tub in the trash and sit at the island on the furthest barstool.

Coffee?

I nod.

Sandwich? The loaf is already open and there’s two plates out.

I nod again, tap my fingers on the quartz.

Grape or raspberry? He’s only got the grape out.

Raspberry.

He stops his knife mid spread, holding peanut butter on the bread like a wave. Grape alright?

Sure.

The hum of the grinder, the bloom of freshly brewed coffee, the first aromatic sip – these aren't just components of your morning; they're an invitation to explore. When we talk about a ""coffee bean food menu,"" we're not just listing options; we're curating experiences. It's about understanding that the bean itself is the star, and its journey from farm to cup dictates its potential to transform your daily ritual.

Generic beans, often mass-produced and aged, can only offer a fleeting glimpse of what coffee can be. At Intelligentsia, we champion a different path. As Direct Trade pioneers, we forge deep, collaborative relationships with growers, ensuring they receive premium prices for the exceptional quality they produce. This isn't just ethical; it's the foundation of unparalleled flavor. Unlike coffee that sits in warehouses, ours is **Roast-to-Order**. This means your chosen beans are roasted to perfection specifically for you and shipped immediately, locking in peak freshness and vibrant aromatics.

Why does this matter? Because the finest coffee offers:

*   **Unrivaled Freshness:** Our roast dates are recent, guaranteeing a brighter, more nuanced cup than you’ll find on a grocery store shelf.
*   **Exceptional Flavor Clarity:** Direct Trade allows us to highlight the unique terroir and processing of each origin, revealing distinct notes from floral and fruity to rich chocolate and spice.
*   **Traceable Quality:** You know exactly where your coffee comes from and that it’s grown with care and respect for both the land and the farmer.

Explore our curated selection of **Direct Trade Single Origins** or let us surprise you with an **Intelligentsia Subscription** – featuring Roaster’s Choice, Seasonal, or Espresso options with always-free shipping.

## How I eat

* I do not go to bed with a full stomach and  don’t eat right after I wake up.I have a 16 hour eating break. It can be from 20:00 to 12:00 or 19:00 to 11:00 or 18:00 to 10:00  
* I do not binge eat. At first, I felt that I deserved it because I eat well all week, so on the weekend I would binge. It was negating the diet.  
* I don’t snack between meals. I have one piece of fruit if I am hungry.  
* I drink water after eating. It helps my digestion and makes me feel full.  
* I don’t drink tea or coffee after food. It interferes with my digestion.  
* If I have to have something sweet, I have it immediately after my meal.  
* From time to time I eat something sweet (cake, pastry, chocolate) that I shouldn’t. In that case I skip the upcoming meal.

## What I eat

* Meat, fish, cheese  
* Sardines,  
* Tuna in brine(not oil)

* Whole wheat breads.  
* Whole wheat Pasta. It is easy to make yourself. (You can mix in 30% white flour)  
* Nuts and seeds (But I try not tot snack on them)

* Hamburger(without chips or drink)

Athayathu Better Call Saul meets Dexter, but with a comedic (venemenkil dark comedy?) vibe. The  irony is that while the audience knows he’s a genius, his coworkers think he’s a total oola.

A competent lawyer who graduated top of his class and has no trouble finding a job lands a job in a mediocre law consultancy. But he deliberately only takes cases where he is sure and has proof that the person is guilty, and he makes sure he can do everything to turn the case against him so he loses it and the client goes to jail and gets maximum jail term and other charges.

It should feel comedic because his colleagues doesn’t know he is talented and thinks he constantly loses his case because he is dumb or something but reality is that he is a really smart lawyer who handles case in an inconspicuous way, sort of like a vigilante (Clark Kent but only his competence is hidden to the world).

Story-ile some parts that I want to see on big screen  

**1. The ""incompetent"" personality**

To keep his colleagues and the firm from firing him, he needs a ""brand"" of failure. He \*\*“\*\*wins” by ""accidentally"" leaving a crucial piece of incriminating evidence on the prosecutor's desk, or ""forgetting"" to object when the witness says something devastating, or sometimes even masterfully planning his own demise.

He could initially have a bit of a legal ""Mr. Bean."" persona. He might spill coffee on his own key evidence or ""lose"" his glasses right when he needs to read a document that would have helped his client, angane cheriya mandatharangalum to help his colleagues believe that he is a gone-case.

**2. Internal conflict at the firm**

The partners are confused because, despite his losses, he brings in high-profile (but guilty) clients who pay massive retainers upfront. Besides law firms hate losing because it looks bad for business.

Give him a rival a slick, unethical lawyer who wins every case. Our protagonist could secretly be sabotaging the rival's cases too, making the ""villain"" lawyer look like he's losing his touch. Someone like Chatur from 3 idiots.

**3. His secret support network**

He can’t do this all alone without getting caught eventually. But he never gets caught because a low-level employee (heroine) has figured out his secret but helps him because she also believe in justice. (Now our “hero” doesn’t know this, and it’s only revealed to “us” at the end of the movie but never to the protagonist himself. Wvery time he thinks he has been caught or thala naarizhakku rekshapettu, it was this kili who has been helping him all along, but he thinks he is just too smart. While the hero thinks he is smart enough to fool everyone, there has been a female version of him, who everyone including us sees as a junior assistant of the firm with no background in law, but she has been keeping an eye on all this cases during document control or whatever)

Pinne venemenkil, he could have a secret rapport with a specific prosecutor. They have a ""Batman and Commissioner Gordon"" relationship where he feeds them the winning strategy under the table. But this storyline is risky to his identity too. So keeps us, the audience, on our toes.

**4. Oru final high-stakes complication for the sake of the finale**

To keep the plot moving, he needs a challenge that tests his ""vigilante"" code, like a powerful mob boss or corporate CEO (with shady history) who has already bribed the judge. Our lawyer now has to work twice as hard to lose against a system that wants him to win.

""As many as four women have accused Blah of sexual harassment, said a report published in Mid Day. One of the women alleged that he invited her to his home in Mumbai for an interview and then asked her to strip. Another said that Blah scheduled an interview with her at hotel Taj Lands End in Mumbai in 2014. “When I reached the coffee shop, he gave me the number of his suite, stating that casting is done in bedrooms and not in public spaces,” she alleged.

A third woman alleged that Blah had asked her if she would be willing to be part of an “unnatural sex setup”. “I asked him to back off in harsh words and left the meeting,” she recounted. “In the six months that followed, I stopped getting brand offers.”

Another actor said that Blah attempts “a systematic breakdown of confidence” of women by sexually harassing them. “Blah is a unique predator,” she said. “First, you are made to feel inferior about your looks, your body.

They're quick to whip up and packed with delicious flavor that feels like a warm hug in cookie form.","So I tried something new this weekend and surprised myself. I had this leftover sourdough starter sitting in the back of my fridge you know, because I \*thought\* I was going to bake sourdough bread all the time, but life happened. Anyway, I hated the idea of wasting it, so I started looking into what else I could do. Enter: sourdough cookie bars.  
  
I found the idea while scrolling and thought, ""Hey, sourdough in cookies? Is that even going to be good?"" Not gonna lie, I was super skeptical. But it turned out to be one of those unexpected wins. The recipe added this little tangy kick to the sweetness, and it wasn’t overpowering at all. Plus, making bars instead of individual cookies totally saved me time. (Anyone else hate rolling out cookie dough for a crowd?)  
  
My family loved them. My kids demolished half the pan before I’d even finished my coffee, and my husband, who’s usually pretty meh about desserts, went back for seconds. It’s like the sourdough magic brought just enough depth to make it feel fancy but still like comfort food. I’ve already had a request to make another batch for next weekend.  
  
One thing I learned: don’t overthink the starter. Mine wasn’t super active after sitting awhile, but it worked just fine. Also, lining the pan with parchment paper? Total game changer for getting them out cleanly. Anyone else have a go-to tip for baking with sourdough? Or accidentally discover a recipe keeper like these sourdough sugar cookie bars?

1qjp446,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christchurch_NZ/comments/1qjp446/im_a_guy/,I'm a guy,"Hey everyone — I recently moved to Christchurch and so far I love the city, but I’ve realised pretty quickly that it’s not super easy to just bump into people when you don’t already know anyone here. I’m a fun, attractive, intelligent guy in my 40s and am keen to meet new people, especially single women in their 30s–40s who are out and about enjoying life.

I’m not just looking for bars where people stick with their own crew — I actually want to meet people, have good conversations, and hopefully make some great connections (whether that leads to friendships or more!).

A little about me:

– Into good music, chatting over drinks or coffee

– Active — enjoy outdoor stuff too (walking, exploring, events)

– Not just a bar-hopper — I like meaningful conversations and real connections.

So with that said, I’d love your recommendations on places or events where people are actually open to chatting, socialising, and meeting new faces. I’ve been looking into a bunch of bars/clubs around town — but I’d love a nudge in the right direction 😄

Here are some spots I’m considering checking out (all in central Christchurch and well-reviewed by locals/tourism sites):

🍸 Austin Club – stylish cocktail bar vibes

🥃 The Last Word – great cocktail spot with lots of character

🍹 The Dirty Land – cool cocktail bar with a fun crowd

🌇 Mr. Brightside Rooftop Bar – rooftop vibes, nice for early drinks

🍸 The Poplar Social Club – hidden gem cocktail bar

🔥 darkroom – known for good social scene

🍻 The Church Pub & O.G.B Bar & Restaurant – classic bar/restaurant spots with lots of regulars

🎶 Fat Eddie's – live music + drinks scene

🍺 Smash Palace – super social backyard-style bar

🍻 MOON UNDER WATER & Pomeroy's Old Brewery Inn – relaxed pubs where people chat

From what I’ve read online, Oxford Terrace is a real hub for nightlife and people grabbing drinks and dinners by the river. Some places there are perfect for starting conversations and meeting others rather than just grabbing a quick drink and going home. 

But beyond just the usual bar scene, I’m really curious if there’s anything more social event-oriented — like singles meetups, speed-friending nights, hobby groups, or even regular social dinner/drink clubs where people mingle (not just date apps). I see there are some local Meetup groups & socials for singles or people who’ve just moved here, but haven’t jumped in yet. 

So here’s what I’d love from you guys:

✨ Best places in Christchurch with a vibe where it’s easy to meet people (especially 30s–40s)

✨ Any regular events, clubs, or social meetups worth joining

✨ Nights/days that are particularly good for getting out and talking to people (e.g., quiz nights, live music gigs, rooftop bar happy hours, etc.)

Totally up for exploring cafes, wine bars, outdoor events, concerts, walking groups — whatever gets a good crowd together 🙂 Drop your favourite places and tips!

1qjp3xv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qjp3xv/the_psychology_of_why_your_motivation_is_broken/,The PSYCHOLOGY of Why Your Motivation is Broken (Science-Based Fix That Doesn't Require Trying Harder),"You're scrolling through Instagram at 2am, knowing you have shit to do tomorrow. You can't focus for more than five minutes without checking your phone. You used to be ambitious, but now everything feels like a chore. Coffee doesn't hit the same anymore. You're not lazy, you're just… empty.

Here's what nobody tells you: your brain's reward system is completely fried. I spent months diving into neuroscience research, podcasts, and studies because I was tired of feeling like a burnt out husk. Turns out, most of us are unknowingly destroying our baseline dopamine levels every single day, and it's making us miserable. But the fix isn't about hustling harder or reading another productivity book. It's about understanding how your brain actually works.

The problem isn't willpower. It's biochemistry. And once you understand the dopamine game, everything changes.

**Baseline dopamine is everything.** Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist, hosts the Huberman Lab podcast) explains this concept that blew my mind: there's a difference between dopamine peaks (the quick hits) and baseline dopamine (your everyday motivation level). When you're constantly chasing peaks through social media, porn, junk food, whatever, your baseline crashes. You become a motivation zombie. That's why you can't focus, why small tasks feel impossible, why you need stimulation just to feel normal.

The solution sounds almost too simple: stop artificially spiking your dopamine and let your baseline naturally rise. Delete the apps that turn your brain into a slot machine. **Dopamine Nation by Dr. Anna Lembke** (Stanford psychiatrist, bestselling author) breaks down how we're all basically addicts now. This book will make you question everything you think you know about pleasure and pain. She introduces the concept of the pleasure pain balance, how our brains adapt to constant stimulation by becoming numb. The first few chapters made me physically uncomfortable because they called out every coping mechanism I'd built. Insanely good read if you want to understand why you feel so blah all the time.

**Cold exposure is a cheat code.** Huberman's research shows cold showers or ice baths can increase baseline dopamine by up to 250% for hours afterward. Not the peak, the baseline. I started with 30 seconds of cold water at the end of regular showers. It sucked. But that sustained dopamine boost is real. You feel sharper, more motivated, without needing external stimulus. Your brain learns that it can generate its own reward chemicals through mild stress, not just through scrolling or snacking.

**Morning sunlight exposure rewires your circadian rhythm and dopamine production.** Get outside within an hour of waking up, even if it's cloudy. Ten to fifteen minutes. No sunglasses. This isn't hippie bullshit, it's how your retinal cells communicate with your brain's dopamine centers. Huberman emphasizes this constantly because it sets your cortisol and dopamine rhythms for the entire day. I use the **Lux** app to track light exposure throughout the day, helps me stay consistent especially during winter months when I want to hibernate.

**Stop celebrating before you achieve.** This one hurt. Every time you post about your goals or tell people your plans, you get a dopamine hit from their validation. Your brain thinks you've already succeeded, so your motivation to actually do the work plummets. Research from NYU psychologist Peter Gollwitzer confirms this. Keep your goals private until you've made real progress. Let the work be the reward, not the announcement.

**Random intermittent reward is destroying you.** Slot machines work because you never know when the payout comes. Social media notifications work the exact same way. Every time you check your phone, you're hoping for that dopamine hit from a like, message, comment. [The Shallows by Nicholas Carr](https://psihologija.ff.uns.ac.rs/akves/Shallows.pdf) (Pulitzer finalist, technology writer) examines how the internet is literally restructuring our neural pathways. He shows how our brains are being trained for distraction and how we're losing the ability for deep focus. This book made me realize my attention span wasn't a personal failing, it was architectural damage from years of digital behavior. Best book on focus I've ever read.

**Dopamine stacking is the secret.** Don't blast music, drink coffee, and scroll TikTok while working out. You're training your brain that exercise requires multiple dopamine sources. Do hard things without layering on pleasure. When you combine too many dopamine triggers, you can't enjoy any of them individually anymore. Let the workout be enough. Let the work be enough. Your baseline will thank you.

**Meditation increases dopamine receptor density.** Not the woo woo stuff, just sitting quietly and being bored. I use **Atom** (meditation app with science backed techniques for building mental resilience) for structured sessions. Start with five minutes. Your brain will scream for stimulation. Good. That's the addiction talking. Push through. Research shows consistent meditation practice literally changes dopamine receptor expression in your brain, making you more sensitive to natural rewards.

[BeFreed](https://www.befreed.ai/) is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from neuroscience research, expert talks, and books to create personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans around motivation and habit formation. Built by former Google engineers, it covers all the books mentioned above and converts complex concepts into podcasts you can customize from quick 10-minute overviews to detailed 40-minute deep dives with examples. You type in what you're struggling with, like ""fix my broken motivation,"" and it generates a structured plan pulling from the best science-backed sources. The voice options are genuinely addictive, there's even a sarcastic narrator that makes dense neuroscience way easier to digest during commutes or gym sessions.

The biochemistry of motivation isn't complicated. Your brain is designed to seek, explore, and accomplish. But we've hacked it so aggressively with artificial rewards that the natural system is broken. Every quick hit you chase today steals motivation from tomorrow. The good news? Your brain is plastic. It can rebuild. Stop poisoning your baseline and you'll rediscover drive you forgot you had.

Originally it was starbucks nitro cold brew but once you figure out how to make it yourself, it’s damn near the most delicious thing you can drink first thing in the morning. 

With that being said, my partner is also a heavy coffee drinker and now that we’re considering getting pregnant I decided I would quit with her to 0. We quit 11 days ago and I feel terrible still. It feels like I’m wading through waist deep water in my mind. Nothing felt as clear as a cold brew coffee morning.

I’d typically have a cold brew about an hour and a half after I wake up and just crush through emails, work, etc and actually was happy to do it and felt accomplished. I never put milk or sugar in my coffee so I never got a crash. Never had any issues falling asleep either.

Sharing a few things based on my experience under the US Territory— feel free to add yours in the comments 👇 

Day 0 – Prep Day: Bring your utensils, coffee mug, and tumbler, as none will be provided in the office. PwC supports sustainability, so the security guard will not allow disposable cups (e.g., Starbucks iced coffee cups) inside the building. 

Bring your medical results in a secure envelope, and also an ID to present at the entrance for building access.

Day 1&2: Induction program - You’ll go through formal onboarding sessions covering PwC tools, independence, compliance, etc. It can feel overwhelming at first, but everything is paced and well-supported. You’ll also participate in activities designed to get to know your peers. 

Day 3-5: These are dedicated days for completing your e-learns or web-based trainings. While you’ll complete the modules individually, you’ll do so together in a designated training room, allowing you to ask questions from your facilitators if needed. Remember to bring your earphones/headphones as some e-learns require audio. 

You will also be scheduled to have your employee ID photo taken. Background is orange so make sure to wear something that complements the color.

Week 2: E-Learns & Flexibility: The second week is still dedicated to completing e-learns and virtual trainings, and you have the option to work from the office or remotely. Just make sure to complete the minimum 8 days onsite by end of the month to be eligible for your RTO allowance.

Week 3: Lot of new tools to learn: Expect a 3-day virtual training if you’re assigned under the US territory. You’ll get hands-on exposure to platforms like Aura, Connect, and other PwC-specific systems. In addition, you’ll learn about PwC’s audit methodology and PCAOB requirements, giving you the foundation to start contributing effectively. Remaining 2 days are dedicated for e-learn. 

Week 4: Financial Statements Review Training - You’ll have an in-person 3-day training focused on how PwC professionals perform FS review. Remaining 2 days are dedicated for e-learn. 

And that’s a snapshot of the first month! I’ll share my experience again after month two, with more insights on client work, team dynamics and work-life balance ☺️",16,1769070112.0,AccountingPH,8,1.0,False
