( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1paj63r,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDailyDose/comments/1paj63r/unmuted_say_so_chapter_10_voices_in_the_bible/,"Unmuted, Say So | Chapter 10: Voices in the Bible","# Chapter 10: Voices in the Bible

>*This is the perfect way to deepen and anchor the message of this book in* ***biblical examples of courageous speech***\*. These men and women didn’t just live by faith—they\* ***used their voice***\*, and heaven moved because of it. This chapter will give readers both inspiration and conviction: if God used\* ***their*** *voices, He can use* ***ours*** *too.*

* **“And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?” –** ***Esther 4:14***
* **“Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ‘Whom shall I send?’ And I said, ‘Here am I. Send me!’” –** ***Isaiah 6:8***

# XXXV) God Has Always Used Willing Voices

From Genesis to Revelation, Scripture shows us that **God chooses to speak through people**. Not the perfect, not the qualified—but the willing.

When God's people speak, things shift:

* **Nations are warned**
* **Captives are freed**
* **Kingdoms are shaken**
* **Hearts are turned to God**

This chapter will walk through several biblical voices—men and women who stepped up, spoke out, and made eternal impact. Their stories remind us:

>**God still calls. And He still uses voices.**  
Your voice may be the next one He wants to use

**1. Esther: The Voice of Courage**

**Key Verse: Esther 4:14**

Esther was a young Jewish woman in a pagan palace. She didn’t sign up to be queen. She didn’t plan to be a deliverer. She was quietly positioned by God **in power for a purpose**.

When the lives of her people were threatened, she had a choice: remain silent and safe—or speak up and risk everything.

>“If you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance... will arise from another place.” – *Esther 4:14*

Esther chose courage. She chose her voice. And her words before the king *saved a nation*.

>***What we learn:*** *God places us in rooms for a reason.* *Sometimes your greatest risk is your greatest assignment.*

**2. Isaiah: The Voice of Surrender**

**Key Verse: Isaiah 6:8**

Isaiah wasn’t seeking a platform. He was seeking God. And in the presence of holiness, he felt unworthy.

But when God asked, *“Whom shall I send?”* Isaiah didn’t point to someone else. He said:

>“Here am I. Send me.” – *Isaiah 6:8*

That single moment of surrender launched Isaiah into a prophetic ministry that shaped nations and still speaks today.

>***What we learned:*** *God doesn’t need perfect speakers—He calls willing servants. Your “yes” can echo through eternity.*

**3. Moses: The Voice That Almost Stayed Silent**

Moses argued with God at the burning bush. “I’m not a good speaker.”  “Send someone else.”

>But God replied: *“Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.”* – *Exodus 4:12*

Moses reluctantly obeyed—and through his voice, God **confronted Pharaoh, delivered Israel**, and gave us the foundation of the Law.

>***What did we learn:*** *God’s power is made perfect in your weakness.* ***Your excuses don’t disqualify you—your obedience empowers you.***

**4. Mary: The Voice of Surrendered Praise**

Mary’s voice wasn’t loud with preaching—but **bold in praise**.

When told she would carry the Messiah, she didn’t run or resist. She responded:

>“May it be to me as you have said.” – *Luke 1:38*  
Later, she declared:  
“My soul glorifies the Lord…” – *Luke 1:46*

Her voice carried faith. Her song still echoes through history.

>***What did we learn:*** *Even your yes and your worship can change the world.*

**5. Peter: The Redeemed Voice**

Peter was bold—but broken. He denied Jesus three times. He wept. He failed. But Jesus restored him—not just to forgiveness, but to **function**.  
Three denials were followed by three questions:

>“Do you love Me?” – *John 21:15–17*

And then came the call:

>“Feed My sheep.”

Peter stood up weeks later and preached at Pentecost.  
**3,000 souls were saved through the voice of a once-fallen man.**

>***What did we learn:*** *Failure doesn’t silence your calling. Jesus restores your voice and sends you again.*

**What Do All These Voices Have in Common?**

They weren’t perfect. They weren’t the most qualified. They didn’t always feel ready.

But they were:

* *Available*
* *Willing*
* *Obedient*

And because they opened their mouths, **God moved.**

**Final Reflection: Your Name Could Be the Next Chapter**

1. Esther.
2. Isaiah.
3. Moses.
4. Mary.
5. Peter.

And maybe… **you.**

What if heaven is asking:

>*“Whom shall I send? Who will speak for Me?”*

And what if your response is simply:

>**“Here am I. Send me.”**

Because **God is still calling voices.**

* Voices in schools.
* Voices in boardrooms.
* Voices in blogs and pulpits and parking lots and prisons and platforms.
* And one of those voices—**is yours**.

Let your life join the story.  
Let your voice echo their faith.  
Let heaven use your “yes.”

# XXXVI) God uses both loud and quiet voices for His purposes.

>*This line beautifully communicates that* ***boldness in the Kingdom isn’t about volume—it’s about obedience.*** \*Whether your voice is soft or strong, public or private, whispered or shouted—\****God can still use it*** *to move mountains, reach hearts, and declare truth.*

* God Uses Both Loud and Quiet Voices

Some voices thunder across crowds. Others whisper in quiet conversations.

And **God uses both.**

The Kingdom isn’t built on personality—it’s built on **obedience**.

In the Bible, we see:

* **Moses**, who was slow of speech, yet became a national spokesperson
* **Isaiah**, who saw the Lord and cried out, “Send me”
* **Esther**, who didn’t preach but *spoke one bold sentence* at the right moment
* **Mary**, whose voice lifted praise, not sermons
* **Peter**, who shouted truth to the crowds
* **Ananias**, who quietly laid hands on Saul in a back room and changed history

Whether they spoke loudly in public or quietly in private, **God used every voice. It’s Not About Volume—It’s About Surrender** God doesn’t ask, “How loud are you?” He asks, “Will you let Me speak through you?” Some of the most life-changing conversations happen:

* In whispered prayers
* Over quiet coffee tables
* Through typed messages
* In tearful, one-on-one encouragement
* Through blogs, journal entries, and small group sharing

The Holy Spirit isn’t limited by sound waves. He moves through surrendered vessels.

**Final Word: Use the Voice You Have**

You don’t have to sound like anyone else. You don’t have to match someone else's boldness. You just have to **say what God gives you**—in the way He wired you to say it. Whether your voice is **a shout, a song, a post, a prayer, or a whisper**, if it’s Spirit-led, **it’s powerful.**

>“Let the redeemed of the Lord **say so**…” – *Psalm 107:2*

* So say it
* Live it
* Share it
* Whisper it
* Write it
* Declare it.
* Declare it.

God doesn’t need you to be loud. He just needs you to be faithful.

# XXXVII) You’re not too late, too small, or too broken to be used.

This is for the one who thinks they’ve missed it. For the one who’s buried their voice under shame. For the one who feels ordinary, overlooked, or off track. *Let heaven interrupt your silence with trut***h:**

>**You’re not too late.** **You’re not too small.** **You’re not too broken.** And you are *absolutely not* disqualified.

God has always written His story with imperfect pens:

* Moses had a stutter
* Rahab had a past
* Jeremiah thought he was too young
* Sarah thought she was too old
* Jonah ran away
* Peter denied
* Paul persecuted
* Mary Magdalene wept

**And God used them all.** He didn’t wait for them to be polished—He met them in their surrender.

**What Disqualifies You in Your Mind Doesn’t Dismay God**

God doesn’t recruit the impressive—He equips the obedient.

>“But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.” — *1 Corinthians 1:27*

If you feel weak, you’re in perfect position for **God’s strength**. If you feel broken, you’re right where **grace works best**. If you feel behind, don’t forget—**God is not bound by human timelines.**

**What Matters Is This: Will You Say Yes?**

The question isn’t:

* Are you good enough?
* Are you qualified?
* Are you ready?

The question is simply: Will you say so?

>“Let the redeemed of the Lord **say so**…” — *Psalm 107:2*

* *Say so… even if your voice shakes.*
* *Say so… even if your past feels loud.*
* *Say so… because the world needs to hear what Jesus has done in you.*

This is not the end of your story. It’s the **turning point**. The part where you stop hiding, stop hesitating—and start *speaking*. Because when you open your mouth, **heaven moves**, and **hell trembles**.

**Final Word: If You’re Breathing, You’re Not Too Late**

You don’t need to fix yourself. You don’t need to catch up. You don’t need to wait until you “feel” bold. You just need to **trust the One who called you.** Your voice matters. Your story matters. **Your obedience matters.**

1. So say it.
2. Speak it.
3. **Live it.**

Let your whole life become a megaphone for the gospel.  
Because **you are not too late, too small, or too broken to be used.**

* You are chosen.
* You are sent.
* You are ready.",1,1764511783.0,TheDailyDose,0,1.0,False
1paj4v2,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1paj4v2/39_m4f_online_looking_for_friends_of_the_best/,39 [M4F] #Online - Looking for friends of the best variety,"Hey, internet strangers. I’m out here on Reddit like a raccoon holding a shiny object, hoping it turns out to be friendship and not a discarded LaCroix can.

I’m looking for people who want to connect in that real, warm, “we both survived another day of late-stage capitalism and deserve a gold star or at least a high-five gif” kind of way.

A few things about me: • I read and write like I’m being chased by a deadline no one actually gave me. • I dip my fries in Frostys because that is how God intended potatoes to be enjoyed. • I pour liquids into bottle caps and pretend they’re shots, because sometimes you just need to feel like you’re at a club even though it’s Tuesday at 3pm and your “drink” is orange Gatorade. • I invent elaborate backstories for strangers at Target, usually involving secret royal bloodlines, cursed heirlooms, or mild tax fraud. • I embarrass my loved ones using offensive-to-no-one but highly dramatic accents in public. • I hunt for new music like it’s treasure, and when I find a song that emotionally drop-kicks me, I listen to it while curled up in the shower like I’m in an A24 coming-of-age movie.

I’m hoping to meet people who are… real. Real complex. Real simple. Real funny. Real soft where it matters. Real in need (or want) of a connection that’s based on mutual kindness, random serotonin drops, and daily attempts to make each other smile.

Bonus points if you are also powered by a chaotic blend of coffee, energy drinks, and pure stubborn willpower — the kind of person who wakes up, cracks open a caffeinated potion, and thinks, “Yes. I choose life.”

If you’re the type who finds joy in tiny things — like the perfect playlist, a particularly chaotic group chat, or the moment your caffeine finally kicks in and you achieve temporary godhood — we’ll get along beautifully.

So yeah… if you’re looking for a friend who’s funny, genuine, occasionally poetic, occasionally feral, and always up for a laugh, send me a message.

Let’s build something soft, silly, and real.",1,1764511686.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1paj1as,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiKeto/comments/1paj1as/mct_creamer_with_coffee/,MCT creamer with coffee,"Every morning I start my day with plain coffee, and it definitely wakes me up, but the problem is what happens after. Some days the energy feels okay, but on most days I get that weird crash by late morning where my brain slows down and I feel half sleepy again. And the worst part is, on days I drink stronger coffee, my sleep cycle gets messed up at night. I feel tired but can’t fall asleep properly, which then affects the next day again. 

That’s why I got curious when I saw neulife has an MCT creamer. I’ve heard a few people say MCT with coffee gives a more steady kind of energy, but I’ve never tried it myself. I’m tempted to try it but also scared of wasting money because so many supplements I bought earlier felt good for two days and then did nothing after.

So I wanted to ask people who actually mix MCT into their morning coffee every day. Basically, does adding MCT actually change anything in real daily life or is it one of those things that sounds good online but doesn’t feel much in reality. Would really appreciate hearing from someone who has used it consistently and not just for a day or two.

1paj028,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1paj028,The ZeroRed cable upgrade,"The ZeroRed are awesome! However after about a year or less of use, I really got tired of the cable as the ear hooks became weirdly deformed (see second picture). So while I was not really searching for an alternative, I saw a post where someone talked about a cable he got and this was the cable he recommended: NiceHCK RedAg 4n. 

Now I am no expert and personally I think a cable really doesn’t matter so much for sound quality (you can bring your pitchforks, I said what I said), but I do appreciate nice craftsmanship of the cable. I think most times that’s what an IEM cable is, a fancy looking accessory. For me the ZeroRed with this cable look great and the ear hooks are more comfy for me (at least for now). I also really love the material feel instead of rubber. In the last picture you can see how they look with the new cable, awesome right? One warning is that the cable is not that long so if you plan to plug it to your desktop DAC/AMP setup and it’s far inside the you might not reach it. 

Anyways, now that I have the cable, I need to explore some ear tips. For now I ordered a pair of coffee tips because I really love what they have done for my CrinEar Daybreak experience. If anyone else has some good recommendations would be happy to hear them. 

btw I got the cable with 3.5 plug because I still want to use the Bass+ adapter sometimes. ",1,1764511322.0,iems,1,1.0,False

1paiy0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/1paiy0t/what_economic_system_could_actually_work_better/,What economic system could actually work better for ordinary people than capitalism?,"***TL;DR:*** **We all know U.S. capitalism is creaking at best. I genuinely don’t know what better system in practice would look like, and I’d love a calm, informed conversation about realistic alternatives or meaningful reforms.**

Hello: Old white lady (54) from the Northeast US here. Apparently Sunday mornings are for me sitting around asking myself Big Questions About Society, so grab your tea/coffee/favorite beverage and settle in. This may wander a bit. Externalizing is my process.

So that you know where I'm coming from: I am divorced, childless by choice (not why I'm divorced), dog mom to a loving rescue pittie, and a former Catholic school girl who left it when I realized my religion had no more validity than anyone else's. 

* My first presidential vote was for Bubba Clinton when I was 21. (And if he is in the Epstein files, arrest and/or sue his ass where relevant.) 
* I've voted Democrat for every president since, sometimes joyfully, sometimes ""John Kerry was a nice man but a terrible candidate."" 
* When an eloquent young state senator said in his [2004 DNC keynote speech](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/keynote-address-the-2004-democratic-national-convention), ""If there's a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me, even if it's not my child,"" that resonated with me deeply.
* I'm an agnostic who tries to live a moral life by using the advantages I've been given to share with others who haven't been as fortunate. 
* Basically ""don't be a dick.""

**Late stage capitalism has become increasingly unsustainable in very visible ways, especially over the past five years since the COVID pandemic.**

* Wages have been stagnant for decades.
* Health insurance being tied to employment is a whole disaster of its own.
* Things are run for profit that should never have been: education, health care, the friggin Post Office

**But genuinely, what is better?** And I don’t mean an “in theory” answer. I mean what system actually works for real humans, with real flaws, who panic, mess up, hoard power, and so on.

**Private equity (PE) is a great (terrible) example:** 

A PE firm sees a hospital as a line on a spreadsheet. They can save 3 percent by closing it. So they do. Click. Done.

They don’t care that this is the only hospital for *500 miles*. They don’t care that the rest of the local healthcare system is held together with Scotch tape and vibes. It’s just close the line item, juice the return.

**So how do you fix that?** 

* Ban private equity? 
* Regulate it out of existence? 
* Nationalize things? 
* Would any of that even work without breaking everything else?

**Example: the “Home Depot Problem”:** Home Depot sucks in many obvious ways. But I live near Trenton, NJ, and the Home Depot in Ewing is a *major* employer here, particularly of Black and brown people. If they closed tomorrow, where do all those workers go? What is the transition plan? Who replaces that labor ecosystem?

**It highlights this weird contradiction where the things we hate are also the things we rely on because of the system we are already in.**

**Sometimes it feels like the cure to capitalism’s excesses is more capitalism.**

Insurers in climate disaster prone areas of Florida are pulling out or raising rates into orbit. Suddenly people care about climate mitigation.

Is that good? Bad? Is it capitalism accidentally doing its job? Yes, normal people are hurt by raising insurance rates, but those people aren't buying million-dollar mansions that are suddenly getting flooded every afternoon.

**Socialism and communism: Humans ruin everything** 

I'd like to think people are basically good. In my experience, individuals are usually kind and thoughtful.

Groups, however, can get loud and panicky and dumb when they are scared. Power corrupts no matter the system.

So I am left feeling **capitalism agnostic**. Like Churchill’s “democracy is the worst except for all the others,” but for the economy.

So what I am asking is: **what actually works?**

I would really love:

* examples of hybrid or mixed systems that actually function well
* ideas for meaningful reforms inside capitalism
* explanations of alternative systems that are not purely theoretical
* how we might transition away from private equity dominance without crushing workers
* reading recommendations for someone trying to get a clearer picture

If you made it to the end, I truly thank you, and DM me for a picture of said adorable doggo. I would love to hear your thoughts, especially calm and grounded ones.",1,1764511178.0,AskALiberal,1,1.0,False

We are planning to camp from Drymen to Inveroran at which point we will stay in hotels for the last two nights.

We are experienced hikers and campers but we are hoping to carry light packs with tent, sleeping bag and only snacks/emergency food. We are hoping to keep the packs light by not carrying all of our food with us and eating at pubs and restaurants.

Looks like there are plenty of pub and restaurant options except at Rowardennan. If we stay at the Sallochy Campsite, it looks like over an hour's walk to the The Clansman Bar Restaurant. Are there other food options that aren't showing up in Google Maps? Perhaps across the loch by ferry?

Our planned campsites and food stops:

Drymen Camping - Drymen

Sallochy Campsite - eat where?

Beinglas Campsite - The Drovers Inn

Tyndrum Holiday Park - The Real Food Cafe

Wild camp at Bridge of Orchy - Bridge of Orchy Hotel

Does any of the above look unworkable? We'll definitely stay flexible and stop along the way if it makes sense but our plan is to arrive at a campsite, set up camp, walk into town, eat dinner. In the morning, pack up and go back into town and eat breakfast.

For lunches, we'll try to buy takeaway or bring protein bars and snacks. One of us will bring a stove but only for coffee/tea and instant soups or oatmeal.",1,1764511057.0,WestHighlandWay,1,1.0,False

I’ve just got a Sage Express espresso machine, and with it came 2 free bags of Kiss the Hippo Donna Blend. I’ve gone through both bags trying to dial them in, but they taste bitter no matter what I do. I’m guessing it might be to do with the dark chocolate notes, but I’m not sure. 

Can anyone recommend any other beans? Ideally something that’s easier to dial in (if that’s a thing). I’m thinking the lighter end of a medium roast might suit me better, avoiding any notes that can come out bitter, but I am a beginner so grateful for any advice on this. I was considering the Kiss the Hippo George Street blend, but unsure if I should try a different brand altogether.

Wake up early, rush through ablutions, possibly have breakfast or a cup of tea or coffee, sit for hours in traffic, plonk down in your office chair, feel the pressure build until you reach your optimum efficiency, work , work ,work, lunch on the go, more work, back in the traffic, home, cooking, cleaning, house chores, evening ablutions, sleep, REPEAT….

How many of us can relate to a daily routine similar to this?

How do we remain focused and inspired every normal day?

We are always busy – but alone!



# How to stay focused

It is very easy for me as a “coach” to jump up on to the stage of your life and say;



WOW!!!!



Every one stand up and stretch and take a deep breath!

Close your eyes and imagine your self living your passion!



WOW!!!!



How fun is that? Now go out and do it!



Your body responds as follows;

Excitement, a mild stress response heightening your awareness, Stretching and breathing adds oxygen to your system helping to relax your muscles, linked to the positive emotions of visualising your passion and hey presto! – you feel great and inspired right there in the seminar!



# Creative Visualisation

 

How do we maintain this motivation over time to get us to where we want to be?

**The first step** is to decide where you want to be. Look back at the vision that you imagined in

the above mentioned example.

Allow your imagination to be totally free. Populate that vision with as much detail as possible. Feel yourself in that space and ask yourself if this is what you actually want, or is this a fun fantasy. 

Both these outcomes are acceptable, but for now we need to decide if these goals are real and attainable, and if they are not, we need to see how we can insert smaller “way station” or sub-goals to lead us into our expectation.



**The Second Step** \- Once you have some sub-goals in place, review your imagined journey to your goal and take some time to edit and smooth the rout as best as you can. 

Intentionally associate these sub-goals with your main goal and structure a simple affirmation around it. repeat that affirmation to yourself while you are commuting every day or while you are driving between clients. 

Make a point of repeating this affirmation at least 40 times a day. Once a week, observe your progress and fine tune your vision as required.



# Success is a state of constant progress

Success is a state of constant progress along and intended path, it is not a destination, so observe your changes and you will see your success grow and mature. Success is something that you create alone and enjoy alone. No one but you can really understand what your success means to you!

1pait8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/WoadStressManagement/comments/1pait8j/the_gift_of_giving/,The Gift of Giving," We often think of stress management as something we do for ourselves: meditation, a warm bath, a walk in nature. These are all wonderful tools. But what if one of the most effective ways to soothe your own anxious mind is to focus on someone else?

A growing body of scientific research reveals a profound truth: giving is a powerful, two-way street that reduces stress and builds unshakeable self-worth.

When we are stressed, our world can feel small and overwhelming. Our focus narrows to our own problems, triggering a cycle of worry and cortisol.

The act of giving, whether it’s your time, resources, or simple kindness, forces a shift in perspective. It moves you from a state of lack to a state of abundance, breaking the negative feedback loop of anxiety.

# The Science of the “Helper’s High”

This isn’t just a nice idea; it’s neurochemistry. When we give without expecting anything in return, our brains light up in a very specific way:

**Dopamine Release:** Giving triggers the same reward centres in the brain associated with pleasure and motivation. This surge of dopamine creates a feeling of euphoria often called the “helper’s high.”

**Oxytocin Boost:** Acts of kindness and generosity increase levels of oxytocin, the “bonding hormone.” Oxytocin buffers the effects of cortisol, lowers blood pressure, and promotes feelings of trust and calm.

**Reduced Activity in the Amygdala:** This is the brain’s fear center. Studies have shown that altruistic behaviour can quiet this region, directly reducing feelings of anxiety and threat.

In essence, giving tells your nervous system, **“You are safe, you are connected, and you have enough to share.”** This message is the antithesis of the stress response.



# How Giving Builds the Self-Worth That Shields Us from Stress

Beyond the chemical reaction, giving builds a psychological fortress against stress. When you help others, you receive undeniable proof of your own value and agency.

I**t Creates a Positive Identity**: Regularly engaging in giving allows you to see yourself as a “helper,” a “generous person,” or a “compassionate friend.” This positive self-perception is a core component of self-worth. When life gets tough, you can lean into this identity, remembering that you are a person who makes a positive impact. This is far more resilient than self-worth based solely on achievement or external validation.

**It Fosters Connection:** Stress thrives in isolation. Giving, by its very nature, connects us to our community. It reminds us that we are part of something larger than ourselves. This sense of social connection and belonging is a fundamental human need and a known protective factor against anxiety and depression.

**It Offers a Healthy Perspective**: Helping someone else with their challenges can instantly reframe your own. It doesn’t minimize your problems, but it does place them in a wider context. This shift can reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed, replacing it with a sense of proportion and, often, a feeling of wonder at the resilience of the human spirit.



# Practical Ways to Reap the Stress-Relieving Benefits of Giving

You don’t need vast wealth to start. The key is consistency and genuine intent.

**Micro-Generosity:** Pay for the coffee of the person behind you. Offer a genuine compliment. Hold the door open. These tiny acts activate the same neural pathways as larger ones.

**Give Your Time:** Volunteer for a cause you care about, even if it’s just an hour a month. Mentoring someone offers a profound sense of purpose.

**Give Your Attention:** Sometimes the greatest gift is to truly listen to someone without looking at your phone or waiting for your turn to talk. This deep, present connection is a gift to both of you.

**Leverage Your Skills:** Can you write? Offer to help a non-profit with their website. Good with animals? Walk dogs at a shelter. Using your unique talents feels incredibly validating.

By making giving a regular practice, you are not depleting your resources. You are investing in a virtuous cycle: reducing your stress in the moment while building the long-term self-worth that makes you more resilient to it in the future. In giving to others, you truly give one of the greatest gifts to yourself.

1paiscn,https://www.reddit.com/r/WoadStressManagement/comments/1paiscn/a_sense_of_wonder_reduces_stress/,A Sense of Wonder Reduces Stress," In our relentless pursuit of productivity, our lives have become a curated list of notifications, deadlines, and to-dos. This constant state of “doing” triggers our fight-or-flight response, flooding our bodies with cortisol and keeping us in a low hum of anxiety.

But what if the most powerful tool for stress management isn’t another app or technique, but a primal emotion we’ve slowly forgotten? What if the answer is to simply rediscover wonder.

Wonder is that breathtaking feeling of amazement and awe we experience when we encounter something vast, beautiful, or that transcends our ordinary understanding of the world.

It’s the gasp at a stunning sunset, the silence under a canopy of stars, or the curiosity sparked by a intricate flower. And science is now proving that this feeling is not just pleasant—it’s a profound reset button for our overloaded nervous systems.



# The Science of Awe: How Wonder Quiets the Noise

So, how does this work?



Researchers studying the emotion of awe have found several direct pathways through which wonder dismantles stress:

**The “Small Self” Effect**: Stress often makes our problems feel monolithic, placing us and our worries at the center of the universe. Wonder does the opposite. When we are captivated by the vastness of the ocean or the complexity of a historical monument, we experience what psychologists call the “small self.” Our personal concerns shrink to their proper size against the grand backdrop of the world. This shift in perspective is instantly freeing, reducing the weight of our anxieties.



**Slows Down Time:** Have you ever noticed how time seems to stretch in a moment of pure amazement? This isn’t just an illusion. Awe-rich experiences make us feel like we have more time available, countering the frenetic, time-poor feeling that is a hallmark of chronic stress. This altered time perception reduces impulsivity and increases patience.



**Dampens the Inner Critic:** The default mode network (DMN) is the part of our brain responsible for self-referential thought—the endless loop of worrying about the past and future that fuels anxiety. MRI scans show that during experiences of awe, the DMN quietens down. Wonder literally pulls us out of our heads and into the present moment, offering a vacation from our chattering minds.



# How to Cultivate Wonder in a Busy Life

You don’t need to book a trip to the Grand Canyon to experience this (though it wouldn’t hurt!). Cultivating wonder is about shifting your attention in everyday life. Here’s how to start:



**Practice “Awe Walking”:** On your next walk, whether in a park or just your neighbourhood, make a conscious effort to look up and out. Notice the patterns of clouds, the architecture of a building you’ve passed a hundred times, or the determined path of an ant. Intend to find one thing that amazes you.



**Consume Awe-Inspiring Media:** Watch documentaries about nature, space, or deep ocean exploration. The goal is to find content that showcases the scale and mystery of our world.



**Engage in “Deep Looking”:** Choose a single object—a leaf, a piece of art, even the bubbles in your coffee. Spend five minutes intently observing it, exploring its every detail, texture, and color as if you were seeing it for the first time.



F**ollow Your Curiosity:** Let a question lead you. Wonder about how something works or why something is the way it is, and fall down a small rabbit hole of learning about it.



By intentionally seeking out wonder, you are not being unproductive. You are engaging in a vital act of self-care. You are re-calibrating your nervous system, trading cortisol for connection, and reminding yourself that you are part of a magnificent, mysterious whole. In a world that prizes busyness, make room for the quiet power of amazement. Your stressed-out mind and body will thank you for it.

1paiiij,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1paiiij,AIO/AITA to this text fight between me and my sister before Thanksgiving?,"Ok I (F26) had this fight with my older sister (F39) this month. 
It’s A LOT and there’s a lot of backstory between us but I’ll try to keep it brief as I can.

She lives about an hour away from me, we see each other an odd dozen times a year.

This all started when I went to visit my grandpa in his nursing home. I invited her along, she declined, asked me how it went, I didn’t respond for 2 days, and boom.
(I didn’t maliciously not respond. She has every right to feel however she does. But we are both sporadic texters who sometimes take days to respond or we don’t at all. I get it. If I want to talk to her I usually call or leave a voicemail or something.)

I am diagnosed major depressive, anxiety, and ADHD. So I feel her. She’s had a rough year with bad dates and stuff and I’ve offered to talk to her about her depression. 
She accuses me constantly of not wanting to hang out with her because she’s depressed, but then whenever I offer she says no or straight up ignores my texts. 

*so that text at the end after I left a voice memo - we had made rough plans to hang out after I was in her city at a concert with my boyfriend. I had a minor motorcycle accident that broke my motorcycle foot peg and rear brake. I managed to ride the motorcycle to my parents (half way between our respective apartments) and left her a voicememo explaining how my boyfriend was just gonna take me home because I was so frustrated and stressed and apologizing for not being able to see her. 
She compared me to her ex boyfriend from years ago (Soko). I never met him or anything but she told me he was a narcissist. So I’m assuming she was implying that my apology for not being able to get together was narcissistic? 

And then she mentions a motorcycle accident she had about 8 years ago - we were riding together in the rain, we had agreed to split off because I was going to work and running late and she was gonna head home. When we split off on our different highways she slid out in the rain on her on-ramp. I didn’t see and kept going to work. As soon as I got home I called her to see if she made it home. She didn’t answer so I called my dad and he let me know she had slid out. She was totally ok thank god but her bike was basically totaled - frames cracked and everything. I felt really bad she was there alone, but we were splitting off in different directions, I was running late to work, I feel it’s kinda unfair for her to hold that over me.

And THEN after that Thanksgiving text I thought we were going better. But she went to my mom’s side of the family for Thanksgiving and told them all that we’d had a fight and that I was mad at her and needed space. So I heard from a few of my brothers and aunts and my mom 😵‍💫 all telling me I should just forgive her and move on and that made me feel so frustrated. 

I guess I’m just wondering if I’m actually being the a**hole here? Am I being cold and narcissistic? 
I feel bad because I know my sister is in a tough mental spot rn, but I kinda feel like she uses me as an emotional punching bag sometimes. 
If she wanted to hang out I wish she would just call and ask me to come over or go for coffee instead of just blowing up my phone and accusing me of not loving her enough.

I know she desperately needs a friend rn and I had leaving her alone and emotionally distancing myself but I feel like that’s my best recourse to keep my own sanity until she can meet me in a more emotionally regulated place.",1,1764509939.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

My favorites (so far) are the lady finger/baby bananas: sweet, custardy, delicious! My ritual is to have them with unsweetened cold brew coffee with heavy cream (anyone else on Planet Earth do this??). Like the Cavendish, I like them at peak ripeness and sweetness: brown spots all over, but still firm. 

I’ve also had Red bananas and Thai bananas. Reds are okay, but part of the floral flavor I get from them is not entirely pleasant; still good, though. And the Thai seems to have a tartness, even “green-ness”, about it that I’m not crazy about, but still okay. But maybe both of the above should be riper/darker before peeling? Should I use the same standard for determining ripeness as I do with the Cavendish and Ladyfinger varieties? 

So I wanna do some banana exploring, and I’m thinking to go with the Large Miami Fruit monthly large box. Anyone else do this? Whaddaya think about it?

The problem is, it’s a little expensive and it’s a LOT of bananas, so I’d like to find someone locally to split some of the cost and bananas with me. I tried reaching out to some friends and neighbors here in NW Arkansas, and posted to some groups on Facebook, but have had zero interest so far. Anyone here from NWA? Interested?

Finally, when I do — if I do — opt for this monthly shipment, is this group a good source of info about determining peak ripeness of the different varieties?

Thx!

1paih3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chennai/comments/1paih3h/marina_mall_inox_scam/,Marina Mall - Inox Scam,"So I had a pretty frustrating experience at PVR Inox – Marina Mall on 29 Nov, 10:50 PM show (Tere Ishq Mein - Hindi), and I honestly can’t believe how casually they handle their own policies.

Here’s exactly what happened:

Interval comes, I go to the F&B counter — literally no one else in the queue except me. I ordered a medium Coke + filter coffee (₹460). I paid through UPI, and no bill. I told them i’ll get my coffee first and then collect the coke.

While waiting for the coffee, I noticed their menu display board which reads “If you don’t get a bill, your order is on us.”

So I went back and asked the guy about it. He casually said “The printer is jammed.” That’s it. No “I’ll send you the bill,” no “I’ll get it to your seat,” nothing. and of course, the show was about to resume, so I went back inside.

Later at home, I emailed PVR support thinking they’ll sort it out.

Then comes the fun part:

Today I get a call from the manager from the theatre and suddenly the story completely changes.

He says the staff had offered to send me a snap of the bill, or check with the back-end and deliver it to my seat. This never happened. Not even close.

He also says i “should have asked the officials right then.” Bro… I came to watch a movie, not to run around the mall investigating their billing machine. He said these all are recorded in cctv. i asked him to reply to my mail with the video attached, he said he will not. “Enakku send pannanum nu avasiyam illa sir”

Then he tells me:

“Next time you visit Marina Mall, we’ll show you the CCTV.”

Why on earth should I drag this into my next movie visit? Just resolve the issue now?!

For the record, I have: payment proof, photos of the policy, and a recording of the phone call.

I’m not after free food.

I just want them to honor the policy they themselves plaster on the screen. If they can’t, then why display it so boldly?

Has anyone else dealt with this nonsense? What’s the best way to handle PVR when they start backtracking like this?",6,1764509834.0,Chennai,5,1.0,False

• **My specialties:** game design debates, remembering pizza exists at 2AM, and maintaining healthy confidence levels (some call it cocky, I call it self-aware 😉)  
• **Love finding** hidden gem coffee shops with strong wifi and better atmosphere - my mobile office away from the screen  
• **Into** sci-fi films, soundtrack music that feels epic while coding, and spontaneous ""let's actually do this"" energy  
• **I appreciate** cozy gaming nights, last minute adventures, and people with quick wit who can make me laugh  
• **Current side quest:** Trying to keep one (1) plant alive on my desk. It's not going well, but I'm great at maintaining conversations 🌱  
• **Seeking Wisdom:** I believe the best solutions in code and in life, often come from experience. There's a quiet respect I have for the kind of wisdom that you can't just google.

I keep thinking in months: how many months I need to learn the language… how long I must work just to afford new tires or brake discs… how long I can keep listening to music in the car to ignore the small noises I can’t afford to fix yet, because rent is more important.

How long I have to pretend to be someone I’m not at a job that slowly kills the person I used to be — a job where I don’t think, I just switch off warning lights and assemble parts.
And then you remember you’re already past 30, you still don’t have children, and time isn’t endless.
Where would you even bring children into a world where you don’t feel safe or settled?
Because the only thing that truly belongs to you here is an old Mercedes that desperately needs service — and you keep postponing it, again, because survival costs more.

So I just finish my morning coffee with these thoughts.
And then the next day again.
And again.

The weather doesn’t matter anymore — it’s just weather.
Style doesn’t matter — everyone at the factory wears the same uniform.
And the whole day, while switching off those lights, your mind loops around the same problems and what you’ll cook for dinner just to distract yourself for at least an hour.

But the thing that breaks you the most is the realization that this might be forever.
That you might always be a foreigner here.
Even if one day you get the passport.
Even if you learn the language perfectly.
Even if you validate all your qualifications.
You still won’t truly belong.
Maybe your children will — if you ever have them. Or maybe that’s just the lie you tell yourself to stay sane.

As I get older, the idea of “forever” scares me more than anything.

Have you ever left forever?
Packed your whole life into one suitcase?
Arrived somewhere you’ve never been, speaking a language you never planned to learn?
Trying to find housing, a job, transportation — with your last $100 spent on the move?

How did you handle it?

I'm a 29 year-old guy living and working in Gurgaon, and I'm looking for a woman who shares one of the most important values in my life: being childfree. I’ve known for a long time that parenting isn't part of my path, and I’m hoping to find someone who feels the same—not just someone without kids, but someone who doesn’t want them at all.

I’m into meaningful conversations, mutual growth, and building a partnership based on shared goals, freedom, and curiosity. Whether that means spontaneous road trips, quiet weekends at home, or exploring new hobbies together, I want a relationship that feels like a team—not one that's headed toward the traditional family model.

A few quick things about me:

I love to cook/bake, go for comedy gigs, read crime novels, manga and binge watch sitcoms (anime ,crime, mystery). Also have spent a good chunk of my 20s (about 7 years) in Australia.

I'm doing fairly well financially/career vise (debt free and try to invest wisely to the best of my capabilities) and usually don't take life that seriously but happy to put in effort and time to build something together.

I prefer someone who's open minded, ambitious, has their own hobbies and opinions, and would also put in genuine effort & time to build the relationship together.

I'm looking for someone who’s emotionally mature, knows what she wants, and is committed to living a fulfilling life on her own terms. If you're tired of swiping past “maybe someday” profiles and want someone who’s on the same page from the start, I’d love to hear from you.

Let’s skip the small talk and talk about the big stuff—without a baby monitor in the background.

Looking forward to connecting.

1paibfd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1paibfd,What is this type of coffee for?,"Hi everyone!

Been to Brazil quite a few times now and I am stumped by this coffee. Is this normal?

I was in the supermarket and thought I would go for a ""better"" coffee than pilão or 3 corações tradicional, one that was more region specific. When I made the coffee (pour over filter, coado) it came out like a weak tea and tasted pretty awful (at least for my tastebuds). Even when I steeped the coffee for a few minutes, and then filtered, it was the same. Watery, with a suggestion of coffee. Also, it seemed to extract all the bad qualities of the coffee.

The coffee is super coarse as well with huge chunks of coffee bean in it. Surely, you can never get a good cup of coffee from such thing?

But a person I know from Parana insists this is the way the coffee is purposely made.

1paiat7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChateauUnhinged/comments/1paiat7/age_and_ageing_coffee_break_musings/,Age and ageing - coffee break musings.,"I've been a number of conversations recently where age and ageing has come up, and our relationship/attitude to those younger or older than ourselves.  Seeing the latest vlog from Sicily has got me musing about Philip.    
  
Philip on holiday with a woman old enough to be his mother, a man old enough to be his grandfather, and a couple old enough to be his great grandparents.  In reality they are supposed to be his fiance, his future brother in law (sort of), and his future mother in law and step father in law.  

In taking up with Stephanie, is he also filling other emotional, and possible greed, needs, such as grandparent replacements/substitutes?  In his subconscious, or probably conscious, thinking, is he expecting to ingratiate himself enough to inherit from the seniors too?  (Probably not Percy as he has his own family.)  Does Gerry have any family, other than Stephanie which he's not actually related to or connected by legal adoption?  
    
Age and ageing is such a deceptive thing, often your head thinks you are one age, but as you get older your body often says different.  I wonder what age Philip really thinks he is.   
It is good to see young people who are happy to spend time in older people's company, but looking the senior LaLander's and him on holiday together in Sicily is a little uncomfortable.    
  
The child in him wants ice cream and he has to have it no matter what.  The more mature person in him takes in every brush stroke of the painted ceilings.  If the clips of the filming is to be believed, he's spending more time with the older folk than he is with Stephanie. Yet, whilst they were happy to throw off their inhibitions and dance for the camera in the amphitheatre, he was hiding away and, I dare say, cringing.   
  
Whilst something of an enigma, I do still think that Philip is out for Philip and all he can get from his relationship with Stephanie.  She has changed since he came on the scene, and not for the better.  Her vulnerability made her an easy target for a predator, making her more vulnerable in a different way.

I wonder does getting rid of staff or outsourcing to cheaper countries always work in companies favour. I would like your views on the following points.

* Wages are a major expense and if companies get rid of staff or outsource to lower wage countries, companies will reduce their costs and hence increase profits. Is this view too simplistic and companies can still have major costs after removing staff or outsourcing jobs. 

* The wages of workers creates the demand for goods and services and by making staff redundant companies kill off what creates this demand. If a company sheds staff this may affect other companies. For instance, a coffee shop receives a lot of custom from commuters. If these commuters get made redundant, the coffee shop looses this trade. Can fewer  staff deter customers. For instance, restaurants cut waiting and cooking staff. It takes longer to get served and tables don't get cleaned which puts customers off. If people see colleagues made redundant they are reluctant to spend as they fear the same fate. 

* If staff are made redundant, remaining staff may worry they could be next and  have to take on the work of the staff who have gone which leads to a demoralised workforce.

1pai7zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1pai7zf/upgrade_your_life_now_daily_habits_mindset_shifts/,🚀 Upgrade Your Life NOW! Daily Habits & Mindset Shifts for Ultimate Happiness & Success ✨🧠,"Hey Maximizame crew,

Ever feel like you're running on a hamster wheel? You're busy, you're doing stuff, but you're not actually *going* anywhere new. The days just sort of... blur together. I've been there, and it's a frustrating place to be.

The biggest lie we tell ourselves is that a life ""upgrade"" requires some massive, earth-shattering event. It doesn't. The real secret is in the small, almost invisible choices you make every single day. It's about stacking tiny wins until they become an unstoppable force.

If you're ready to break the cycle, here are a few simple things that have a huge impact.

**Daily Habits That Actually Work:**

*   **The 2-Minute Rule.** If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. Don't put it on a list. Just do it. Clearing these tiny hurdles clears up so much mental space.
*   **Hydrate Before You Caffeinate.** Before you reach for the coffee, drink a big glass of water. It kickstarts your metabolism and brain function. You'll be surprised how much better you feel.
*   **""Input"" vs. ""Output"" Mornings.** For the first hour of your day, don't consume—create. Don't scroll social media or check emails (input). Instead, write, stretch, plan your day, or meditate (output). You start the day in control, not in reaction mode.

**Mindset Shifts That Change Everything:** 🧠

*   **""I get to"" instead of ""I have to.""** You don't *have* to go to work; you *get* to have a job. You don't *have* to work out; you *get* to move your body. This simple language swap turns obligations into opportunities.
*   **Embrace ""Good Enough.""** Perfectionism is just a pretty word for fear. A ""good enough"" workout is infinitely better than the ""perfect"" one you never do. A ""good enough"" project launch is better than the ""perfect"" one that never sees the light of day. Progress over perfection, always.
*   **See Failure as Data.** When something doesn't work, it's not a reflection of your worth. It's feedback. It's a data point telling you what to try next. Winners aren't people who never fail; they're people who aren't afraid to.

Look, a lot of this is practical, but the biggest game-changer is often sorting out the stuff going on in your head and heart. The self-doubt, the anxiety, the feeling of not being enough... that's the real boss battle. It’s tough to build new habits when your emotional foundation is shaky. I've found having a structured approach to managing those feelings is key. If you're looking for a solid game plan for that inner work, check out **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)**.

It's all about building momentum, one tiny win at a time. You've got this.

So, I'm curious—what's one small habit or mindset shift that completely changed the game for you?",1,1764509088.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1pai7ik,https://i.redd.it/zx98rj6cbe4g1.jpeg,The Promise You Can Actually Keep,"
That heaviness in your chest when you can’t trust your own voice? 
When ""I'll start tomorrow"" becomes a ghost that haunts you?

You’re not lazy. You’re not weak. You’re just carrying the weight of every promise you’ve broken to yourself.

I’ve been there. Staring at a reflection of someone I used to be, someone who followed through. 
The unused gym membership. The abandoned business plan. 
The three-day-old ""new routine.""

I didn't need another motivational speech. I needed one tiny, undeniable proof that I could still keep my word.

So I started with a promise so small it felt almost foolish: I will make my bed every morning.

Two minutes. No excuses.

Not because a tidy bed changes your life, but because keeping your word to yourself does.

What happens when you stop breaking promises to yourself?

· Day 7: The promise felt real.
· Day 15: Other decisions became easier.
· Day 30: I looked in the mirror and saw someone reliable.

That one micro-promise rebuilt my trust in myself. My confidence didn't explode; it accumulated, brick by brick.

True confidence isn't a lightning bolt. 
It's the quiet certainty that you are someone who does what they say they'll do, especially when it's small, and especially when it's just for you.

Your turn. Your first promise starts now.

Think of one action. So small you can’t fail. So meaningful it matters.

· One glass of water before coffee.
· Three sentences in a journal.
· One deep breath before you check your phone.

This is your moment. Stop planning. Start proving.

Reply with “PROMISE” and tell me your one small commitment.

I’ll be here to witness you become the person you’ve been waiting for.

Your Mindset Matters,
Joseph James

1pai1gb,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmProducts/comments/1pai1gb/what_mini_home_projector_suits_family_game_nights/,What mini home projector suits family game nights?,"Looking for the perfect mini home projector to level up your family game nights? You're in the right place.

Family game nights hit different when you've got a big screen experience right in your living room. Whether you're crushing it at Mario Kart, solving trivia questions, or watching your kids battle it out in Just Dance, a portable projector can turn any wall into an entertainment zone.

**What Makes a Good Mini Projector for Gaming?**

You need something that won't break the bank but still delivers solid picture quality. Brightness matters – look for at least 5000 lumens so you don't have to turn your living room into a cave every time you want to play. Nobody wants to fumble around in the dark looking for snacks.

Screen size flexibility is huge too. Some nights you'll want a massive 100-inch display, other times something smaller works better. The best compact projectors let you adjust easily.

**Key Features to Consider**

Connection options are essential. HDMI ports let you hook up your Switch, PlayStation, or Xbox without hassle. Some home theater projectors even have built-in speakers, which saves you from dealing with extra equipment.

Battery life or power cord length matters for placement flexibility. You might want your projector on a coffee table one night and mounted across the room the next.

Resolution is another biggie. 1080p is the sweet spot for gaming – sharp enough to see all the action without costing a fortune. The colors pop, text is readable, and fast-moving scenes stay smooth.

**Making Your Choice**

You can check out quality options that tick all these boxes at **[this collection of mini home projectors](https://athomewave.com/mini-home-projector)**. They've got different models for different budgets and needs.

The right multimedia projector should be easy to set up, reliable, and bright enough for casual use without dimming all the lights. Portability is a bonus if you ever want to take game night outside or to a friend's house.

**Bottom Line**

Don't overthink it. A decent LED projector transforms ordinary game nights into something your family actually looks forward to. The investment pays off in memories and fun.

Ready to upgrade your entertainment setup? **[Browse mini home projectors here](https://athomewave.com/mini-home-projector)** and find one that fits your space and budget. Your next game night is about to get a whole lot better.",1,1764508564.0,UmmProducts,0,1.0,False

**""App Name""** is an interactive app that turns everyday life into spontaneous adventures. Our app guides users on fun and unexpected journeys, where each step is determined by random prompts, community suggestions, or interactions with others based on user input. Whether you're exploring new places, trying new activities, or exploring in your own town, ""App Name"" makes every day an opportunity for discovery. It’s perfect for solo adventurers, couples, or groups looking to add a spark of excitement to their routine, all while earning rewards and sharing experiences.

This app would help create opportunities for users to make new memories they wouldn't have otherwise made. By following a generated prompt, they have the option to complete the task/action. This could include prompts like ""Go to a local book store and buy a book that is recommended by a staff member"" or ""Go to a local coffee shop and buy the person's coffee who stands behind you"", etc. Users can input if they want to receive prompts that will incur expenses or have a free day, how long they want to ""play"" the app (i.e. how many prompts they are given), what the weather is like so it can give them appropriate prompts, how many people are with them, if they want to include a meal as a prompt, etc. Once the task is completed, they can receive points on a system that will give them rewards/etc.

This idea was thought of after a trip I went on where every experience, no matter how small, became a new memory for me. My wish would be to connect users with their environment and make ""travel"" accessible to everyone, by creating this small little memories which can create larger impacts down the road.",1,1764508473.0,Businessideas,0,1.0,False

1pahxma,https://www.reddit.com/r/TollywoodGossips/comments/1pahxma/coffee_about_anasuya/,Coffee about Anasuya,"All this info from a friend who worked with her sister. Not first hand.

Anasuya is the eldest daughter and has 2 sisters. We all know her love story from her interviews but we have to give it to her , she is self made. Her dad used to roam in politics and didn't contribute financially. All the 3 sisters started working part-time during/after intermediate post college hours. Recently when one reporter asked her how she was able to afford a defender worth crores, she said she earns and her parents gave money too. All that is bullshit. They are strictly middle-class and strapped for money. That's the reason for her job in Sakshi TV as a news reader.

2nd sister is married to a Mallu, 3rd used to work in Aadhan media as a director and she is as cunningly smart, ruthless, career oriented as Anasuya but nothing in looks. Anasuya tried hard  to push the youngest sister in front of camera but failed as she was just below average looking. 3rd one moved to America few years ago and got settled there, still unmarried. 

Literally every asset she has, her abroad trips with her family all is her hard earned money, using Instagram profile as a soft Only fans clone profile, showing off her figure and showroom inaugurations in tier2 and tier3 cities.Her father wasn't happy with her dressing or her love marriage but mother stood like a rock behind daughters. She is fiercely loyal to her husband and family and all those escorting talk is rumours. 

Highly ambitious and cunningly street smart, so dodged all the couch offers, let go of few big chances because she doesn't wanted to compromise. Sri Reddy tried hard to drag Anasuya by taking her name repeatedly(both worked for Sakshi) but Anasuya dodged that as well. Heard Anasuya was super pissed about that issue.

Lakshmi Manchu took Anasuya's name in one interview and said how impressed she is by the way Anasuya is leading her life fiercely. Few days later, Anasuya appeared in high profile Diwali bashes with the super rich reddy families. Guess Manchu Lakshmi 's friendship is working well for Anasuya.

All the woke feminism, outrages in the media, picking fights is all part of her media game according to that friend who worked with Vaishnavi (younger sister) in Aadhan. They said Anasuya mastered the game of staying in limelight and to convert that limelight into money, and is smart enough to multiply that money ten folds.",23,1764508236.0,TollywoodGossips,5,0.81,False
1pahws0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThisAintAdderall/comments/1pahws0/im_finally_getting_better_results/,I’m Finally Getting Better Results!,"While I don’t put it past Big Pharma to screw us over by reducing the effectiveness of our meds, I do want to verify that not eating or drinking anything except water for 45 minutes before and after I take 20 mg of generic Adderall XR (from Amneal Pharmaceuticals) has made a big difference for me. If I’m sitting still after I take it, I can actually feel shivers when it’s kicking in. That happens after maybe 20 minutes, but I continue to wait the full 45 min before I have my coffee or Crystal Light (a citric acid drink.)

(Note: I posted previously about how certain foods, drinks, and meds we ingest are are capable of fully dissolving amphetemine before it reaches our bloodstream.) 

My current dose is 10 mg higher than I was previously taking in the mornings, but it keeps me going pretty much all day, as long as I don’t sit down (I’ll still nod off if I sit down, regardless of stimulant use. I seem to have a bit of Type 2 narcolepsy.) 

Not only am I moving and working on things all day, but my upper lip sweats for hours every day. I’m constantly wiping it, hoping no one notices. (It’s 4 hours after taking Adderall and my mustache area just started sweating, lol.)

Anyway, I’m getting much better results now and can really feel the medicine working. I’m also waiting an hour or two before I take my Suboxone, which is a CNS depressant that may have been counteracting the effects of stimulants.

This is my first time taking Amneal brand, so that might be part of it, but it’s not like they have a good reputation. They’re an Indian manufacturer who has received warnings from the FDA for bad practices. 

It’s so stupid how the pharmaceutical companies and government used to warn us not to take cheaper overseas drugs, but that’s practically the only thing available now. My guess is that they were being made overseas the whole time. Big Pharma just wanted to import the drugs themselves so they could mark them way up before we bought them. 

Of course, you can’t buy Schedule 2 drugs directly from India (that I know of), but you can buy other prescription drugs direct from India, including the so-called “cognitive enhancer”, Provigil, which is only a Schedule 4. I’m not trying to promote Indian pharmacies, but I feel it’s something people should know, in case Adderall patients are affected by a shortage again. They could take Provigil if they run out of Adderall. (Note: Among other warnings, I just read that Provigil can make birth control less effective.) It’s used off-label to treat ADHD, so it might be worth a try if you have nothing else. Here’s how Joe Rogan describes his experience taking it:

https://youtu.be/FvzzGrRKJHc?si=LzHW1Gi1doJPC79P

Sorry, I get off-track easily (it’s my ADHD - y’all understand). But the point was, the medicine works better, now that I’m not eating or drinking around the time I take it. So I hope that info will help some of you get better results too. ",2,1764508165.0,ThisAintAdderall,0,1.0,False

We’re gay if you can’t tell. I am six foot 230lbs, I am a race car driver and a hockey player. He is 5 foot 8 165lbs. I could one punch him if i really wanted to. 

Two weeks ago today we broke up. Amicably. In the conversation however he told me in the conversation that he had fallen in love with another man. This DESTROYED ME. It caused me to immediately download grindr. I then sought comfort in the arms of a stranger and found it. I could have done worse. Sweet guy. Still a bit of a shitty thing to do so fast after an 11 year relationship ended. 

All week he talked about the man he had fallen for, confiding in me as his best friend. Every time was like a knife stuck in my chest and twisting it. He wasn’t trying to hurt me but he was hurting me. 

Fast forward to last Monday night. We’re talking about gay stuff. I told him for some dumbass reason i had hooked up. He is not happy. He lectures me. Expresses disappointment in me says he never loved me and only got with me because he felt sorry for me and leaves. 

Hours pass. Im extremely depressed and borderline suicidal. I fall asleep. Its now 10:22. I wake up and worried, i call him. He is cool at first. Then hangs up. I call back and he starts screaming at me soooo loud i cant understand me. He calls me sick, a loser, disgusting, awful. Everything. This goes on for an hour. He demands i call my parents and tell them everything. I did. They now know my entire sex life including my kinks. Yay. 

He comes in, im still on the phone with my mom he screams and punches me twice in the head. He gets two inches from my face and yells so loud. Repeating the same insults over and over again. I smell the alcohol on his breath. He is an alcoholic, sober a year. He had previously gotten mildly violent with me 3-4 times in 11 years with open handed slaps. Again. My build and his are above. 

He throws more punches i get up to get away from him. He grabs a heavy candle holder on the coffee table holding a yankeeish candle and bashes me over the back of the head with it. The candle flies out and it shatters on the floor. Im dazed. I get towards the door he follows me punching me in the sides and going for my head. He then retreats to the living room and collapses on the floor in tears. Accusing me of cheating…we were broken up when i did what i did. 

I go to our room, i own weapons. I throw them in a go bag to keep them away from him along with some clothes, i go to the door and he yells at me “you’re leaving?!”

I tell him i am for his protection. I assumed 911 had been called. We live in an apartment. He rushes me and punches me multiple more times, i shield myself he gets me above the eye. I dash out the door he slams it behind me. My face is throbbing from the last hit, i get to my car and speed off. I call my mom. 

I get to a hotel and check in. Afraid. Scared. Suicidal. I leave the weapons in the car in a remarkable moment of clarity. I grab my clothes and go to the room. I spent the next 14 hours bouncing between suicidal and just embarrassment. 

My dad drove seven hours to get to me. 

I have talked to my ex twice since then. We’re…cordial. My head still hurts a bit, the black eye is almost gone and in a few hours for financial reasons. I am going back home after living in hotels for a week. Im actually lying on a friend’s air mattress now in his basement. 

Im scared. I dont know what to do. He has my dogs. We are financially dependent on one another. Sober, he is fine. Im not afraid of sober him. Drunk him? I am utterly terrified of.

My wife enjoys having cappuccino when we are away, yet at home she dos hardly drink some, as she thinks it's to must of a hustle to prepare while she's home working.

Bonus points if it was relatively grounded beforehand.

Most climaxes in the Kirby series. I know it's a meme that Kirby games get super dark out of nowhere, but it's often true. But nowhere is that more apparent than Forgotten Land's climax. For most of the game, Kirby has been exploring the New World, fighting the Beast Pack along the way. Then, right at the literal final level of the game, who get a gigantic lore dump that potentially ties into a bunch of previous lore throughout the series. This is then followed up with the battle against Fecto Forgo/Elfillis, which is one of the most insane boss fights in the whole franchise.

The original Shin Megami Tensei has a pretty nutty case of escalation. One of the first things you're tasked with is getting coffee for your mom. Then, suddenly, *actual fucking demons* start showing up and causing mayhem. As the game goes on, not only do more and more demons start invading, the U.S. comes and places Tokyo under martial law.

I’ve tried using crystals by cleansing them, setting intentions, etc. but I’ve never noticed a difference. That is, until recently

I might’ve become a bit desperate for a romantic relationship a few weeks ago so I looked up what I could use to manifest a relationship. I saw a lot of people saw rose quartz and green aventurine. I’ve never tried mixing stones intentionally, but it was worth a shot.

Because I have a bunch of unused crystal chips for making jewelry, I decided to make a bracelet. As I beaded them, I set my intentions. Once I finished, I wore it to work. After the first day I felt like there was too much energy so I didn’t wear it again.

2 days after I wore the bracelet, a regular customer gave me his number in a very romantic gesture. We started talking that day and haven’t stopped since. We’ve already gone on a date that was just supposed to be chatting over coffee, but we ended up losing track of time and talked from 9am to almost 4pm. He’s already planning a 2nd date, and we both see this going far.

1pahkrl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pahkrl,AirPods Max V3TB review,"AirPods Max V3TB vs Retail AirPods Max – Full Review

The quick comparison table is at the bottom of the post))

After spending real time with both the retail AirPods Max and the 5.3 TB High City clones, I’ve put together a full, realistic breakdown covering design, build, comfort, performance, ANC, transparency, sound, mic quality, firmware, Find My, leakage, glitches, and everyday usage. This is written as a proper long-form Reddit-style review instead of raw bullet points, but still structured enough to skim.



⸻



Design & Build Quality



The design is genuinely impressive. The color is spot on and looks premium — easily my favourite part visually. They sit very clean on the head, and despite being metal headphones (so naturally heavier than plastic ones), the weight distribution is good enough for office use, travel, or casual walking. I can lay in bed, sit in the office, or move around without really feeling like they’re bulky or annoying. The ear cups texture is like retail very soft and durable (better than v2). The hinge moves back and foward very nicely smooth closely to retail and again better than v2. 

The battery life is very good, I only used them in either ANC or transparency which activated all 8 microphones I guess and using them for 4-5h straight drains about 10-16% at most, that includes FaceTime calls and recording on them.

The fit is a very big upgrade from the v2 which put all of the pressure onto the headband and top of ear cups.

However: neither these nor the retail Max are good for the gym.

They’re metal → they’re heavy → they will start sliding off during exercises or jogging. If you really want to use them in the gym, you need silicone ear cups, because the standard mesh ones will soak sweat and the headphones will become unstable.

⸻

Comfort & Fit

The ear fit is surprisingly good. My ears don’t touch the drivers or the inside walls at all, and they seal decently well around the head. Comfort lasts roughly a “movie length” — about 1.5 to 2 hours — without needing breaks.

Oh, please don't get them if you have a big head, they may be quite tight so the comfort varies from what you are. They are similarly tight to Sony mx6.

The digital crown feels great: not a click, more like a subtle haptic feel similar to a MacBook trackpad. The dedicated ANC/Transparency button is noticeably improved over the previous TB versions but still not identical to Apple’s tighter, more premium button feel.

You can reverse the digital crown direction in the Apple settings, just like on real AirPods Max.

⸻

Microphone Quality

Honestly, one of the biggest surprises.

Recording in Voice Memos sounds really good — there’s a slight hiss, but even the retail Max (which are now 5 years old) have that. Phone calls, voice messages, and even talking to ChatGPT all worked with no issues. They are basically identical to retail in this category.

⸻

Sound Quality

The sound quality itself is impressive at this price point. Out of the box, it hits similar character to retail Max: warm, deep bass, detailed mids, good treble without harshness. They get very loud — my friend who normally listens at \~70–75% found \~55–60% loud enough on these.

For movies, these are excellent.

Even though I have a proper home surround setup with Sonos speakers and various headphones, I will still reach for these 30% of the time for movie watching. They give a very full, immersive sound and are genuinely satisfying for cinematic use.

Here’s the thing — they sound really, really good.

I tested: Soundstage videos, Frequency sweeps, Hertz tests, My usual music playlists, Movie scenes.

Signature vs Retail

Retail: 9.4/10

V3TB: 9/10

Retail feels slightly:

• Bigger

• Fuller

• More “studio recording room” vibes

But the V3TB is still on par with £250 headphones.

Equalizer:

Unlike the rich EQ on AirPods Pro 2 5.3TB, the Max V3TB app only has:

• Normal

• Ultra bass

• Voice

Ultra bass = muddy

Voice = very odd

Normal = the only usable one

But honestly, even with limited EQ, the default sound is enjoyable and doesn’t feel like it needs major tweaking. There are firmware bugs that cause inconsistent results. Better to leave EQ alone until (or if) a stable update drops.

⸻

Connectivity, Firmware & Glitches (This Is the Main Weak Point)

Okay, so this is definitely the biggest downfall of these headphones, and honestly the only part where you really feel they aren’t retail. The hardware is great, but the firmware/connection side is just… annoying. There are so many little things that stack up.

First thing, when you connect them for the first time, you don’t even get the pop-up. No nice Apple animation, nothing. You literally have to go into Bluetooth settings and do it manually. And what I realised is that the pairing order actually matters. If you connect them to your Mac first, and then to your iPhone, the automatic switching works perfectly afterwards. If you do it the other way around, you’ll get random issues. I tested it multiple times and it’s consistent.

Then you’ve got the general connection problems. Like, there’s always something. A problem with the iPhone, sometimes something with the Mac — it’s just not stable the same way real ones are. And on my iPhone 13 Pro specifically, the volume doesn’t match what the crown is doing. The crown boosts the headphone audio, but the phone basically limits it, so the levels don’t line up. This does not happen on the iPhone 15 Pro Max or my MacBook Air M3, so it’s definitely a weird compatibility thing.

Resetting them is also odd. Instead of the usual flashing white/orange, you just get a green flashing light only, which makes it impossible to tell what state they’re actually in. And every time I reset them, the device identity changes. Like one reset it shows as “My AirPods Max,” another time it shows as “ AirPods Max”, sometimes the colour shows as Midnight, sometimes Starlight — it’s just inconsistent.

Another thing: the digital crown sometimes makes a scratchy metal sound when you turn it while wearing the headphones. If they’re off your head, you don’t really hear it, but on your head you feel that scratch in the sound.

And then the ear-detection — the auto-pause is way too sensitive. If my ear moves even a forward away from the sensor and the sensor doesn’t feel it properly, the headphones pause the audio as if I took them off. Maybe it’s because my ears are smaller, but still, it happens enough to notice.

Little mention - ""hey Siri"" doesn't work on there, you have to hold down the Digital Crown and then talk. And when someone calls you on snapchat it doesnt always work (you have to end call and call person back).

So yeah, this whole section boils down to this: the headphones themselves are amazing, but the firmware and overall connection behaviour feel unpolished. Once they fix that in updates, these will be unbelievably good — but in their current state, this is the biggest flaw.

⸻

Spatial Audio

Spatial Audio actually works pretty decently on these. I wasn’t expecting it to function at all, but it does — and for the most part it feels smooth. There is a slight delay, but it’s nearly zero, like it’s there if you really pay attention, but not something that ruins the experience. For watching movies or YouTube it’s totally usable.

There are some bugs, though. Sometimes Spatial Audio doesn’t activate properly, or it activates but feels a bit off until you reconnect. It’s not a constant problem, just one of those occasional little glitches you get with these headphones in general. But when it works, it’s honestly surprisingly close to the real thing considering what they are.

⸻

Transparency Mode



Transparency mode honestly surprised me. I didn’t expect it to be this good at all. It’s extremely detailed — like almost too detailed. The way I described it earlier is literally like looking at something under a microscope but for sound.

Example: when I walked out of my office at night and went to the bathroom, the sound of my piss hitting the toilet was ridiculously crisp and clear 😆. Same thing when I was lying in bed typing on my Mac — I could feel every key press. It picks up the small high-frequency sounds so well that it almost feels clinical.

So yeah, transparency on these is way better than I thought it would be. It’s not retail AirPods Pro 2 level natural but it picks up every detail and works well.

⸻

Active Noise Cancelling (ANC)

ANC is a big upgrade compared to the V2 versions. The V2s had basically zero noise cancelling; these actually do something. You can tell these are using some sort of adaptive system, because indoors the ANC “blurs” sounds nicely, but outside or in public the ANC noticeably boosts itself and gets stronger. Outside it actually becomes very quiet.

When you start playing audio, it gets even better. At around 50% volume I’d say about 95% of outside noise is gone. And once you hit 70%, yeah — you don’t hear anything anymore. Sudden noises like a door shutting can still come through slightly, but that’s expected with most ANC.

Retail AirPods Max still beat these in raw ANC strength and that vacuum-seal effect, but honestly these clones are really good for what they are.

⸻

App, Settings & Find My

The EQ in the settings is super limited — you get Normal, Ultra Bass, and Voice. I tried all of them but I didn’t like Ultra Bass or Voice at all, so I just kept it on Normal. Thankfully Normal sounds really good so I didn’t feel the need to change much.

In terms of system info: the serial and model number show correctly, and even AppleCare+ shows up, which is wild. Obviously that doesn’t mean you actually have coverage, but it appears legit in the settings.

Find My works, but not fully. You can make them play a sound, and you get a near location / last seen type of tracking. But you can’t do the full precise search like on real AirPods Max. No directional arrows, no full U1-style tracking — just the basic features.

And throughout all this you still get those random pop-ups and little glitches I mentioned earlier, so the app/settings experience definitely feels tied to the same firmware issues.

⸻

Microphone Quality

The microphone shocked me — in a good way. It’s really, really good. I tested it everywhere: voice memos, phone calls, voice messages, talking to you (ChatGPT), and it all sounded absolutely fine. Honestly I can barely tell the difference from the real ones.

There is a little bit of hissing, but I had the same thing on my old retail Max, so I don’t care about that and it doesn’t affect calls or recordings.

Bottom line: microphone is basically retail-tier for my usage.

⸻

Sound Leakage



This is a problem on both the clones and the retail Max, so this part is fair.



Here’s what I found:

• Quiet indoor environments (office, classroom):

• Anything above \~40–45% volume can be heard by someone sitting next to you.

• Normal environments:

• At 50–60%, you’re usually okay unless someone is very close.

• Outside:

• Below 70%: mostly fine

• Above 70%: leakage becomes clearly audible to people walking close by.

Again, silicone ear cups reduce leakage, but I don’t recommend using them unless you really need them (like for gym sweat resistance).

⸻

Water Resistance & Outdoor Usage

Neither the retail Max nor these clones are waterproof.

Not even sweatproof.

I avoided wearing them outside in rain and avoided humid weather entirely. In dry conditions or indoor spaces (office, coffee shop, car), they perform perfectly. But I wouldn’t risk moisture with either version.

⸻

Long-Term Expectations

I won’t know longevity until a couple of months in, so I’ll probably do a follow-up review. But right now:

• Hardware seems solid.

• Comfort is good.

• No immediate physical issues.

• The only real long-term question mark is firmware stability.

I’ll be testing them with editing, movies, long study sessions, and more to see how they hold up.

⸻

Final Verdict (So Far)





|Strengths|Weaknesses|
|:-|:-|
|• Strong build quality and great design • Excellent mic quality • Very good sound for music and exceptional for movies • Comfortable enough fit for long sessions • ANC decent enough, especially with music • Good digital crown feel • Apple integration mostly works • Packaging almost Apple-like • Price-to-performance is insane |• Firmware bugs are the biggest issue • Connectivity inconsistent • ANC not as strong/not as functional as retail • Sound leakage above \~40–50% in quiet rooms • Not waterproof, not gym friendly • Find My not fully functional • |

In conclusion I would like to say that they are very good for what they do, and hopefully after time they will fix the bugs and glitches with an update, other than that they are totally worth the price. Just try AirPods Max at a store to acknowledge the weight on those as these are similar.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Le Havre vs. Lille: A Tale of Two Sieves (With a Side of Confidence)**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a Ligue 1 clash that’s equal parts chess match and slapstick comedy! Le Havre, 13th in the league, hosts Lille, 5th, in a battle where both teams are missing key players like a toddler’s incomplete LEGO set. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Frenchman ordering a croissant—and the humor of a stand-up comedian stuck in a sports bar.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The bookmakers have spoken, and they’re about as subtle as a megaphone at a rock concert. **Lille is the clear favorite**, with odds hovering around **1.8 (decimal)**, translating to an implied probability of **55.5%**. Le Havre, meanwhile, is a longshot at **4.3–4.5**, or **22%**, while the draw sits at **3.6 (27.8%)**. These numbers scream, “Bet on Lille unless you enjoy the thrill of regret!”

But let’s not let the math do all the talking. Lille’s recent 4-0 Europa League thrashing of Dinamo Zagreb? That’s the sports equivalent of a karate kid kicking a piñata—confident, decisive, and leaving opponents in pieces. Le Havre, on the other hand, is clinging to 17 points like a drowning man holding a cork. Their most recent win over Lille in February? A 2-1 stunner, but let’s be real: history is just a fancy word for “what happened before they spilled the coffee on the tactics board.”

Both teams are fielding lineups that would make a backup band jealous. **Le Havre** is missing **Delaine, Zagadou, and Touré**, leaving their defense as patched up as a 10-year-old’s patched jeans. Coach Didier Digard is likely feeling the pressure like a waiter balancing 17 espresso cups.

**Lille**, meanwhile, is sans **Verdonk (suspended)** and a quartet of injured players

 maybe thats just my eyes being fried idk   i’ll just talk it thru the way it happened cuz fixing anything rn feels pointless anyway.

  It started w/ that, heavy thump outside my door like someone dragging their whole body down the hall. not fast. not slow. just…… steady enough 2 make my chest kinda tighten??  

i thought it was the neighbor but nah this was closer. like RIGHT against my door.  

The peephole went dark.  

The light in the hall was still on tho so it didnt make sense unless smth… big… was standing there covering all of it. i leaned in (so dumb i swear im gonna hate myself for this forever) & the darkness *moved upward* like the person was too tall & trying 2 match my height but... overshot it.

my stomach dropped like i missed a stair.  

then this tiny,soft scratch across the wood, not sharp or scary just… gentle?? like trying 2 feel the shape of the door. i whispered “h-hey?” & my voice turned into this pathetic squeak.  

the top of the doorframe creaked.  
the *top.*  

I had this weird memory flash of my grandma brushing my hair when i was little w/ her long nails & for some reason THAT made my eyes tear up way faster than fear did. like something in her voice was getting pulled out of me??

i looked again. WHY DID I LOOK AGAIN.  
her eyes were RIGHT THERE.. wide & shiny like she didnt know blinking existed. she wasnt angry tho which somehow made it so much worse she just…… stared like
.
.
 she’d been waiting for me to show up to this exact second in time.

I tripped back over my stupid coffee table (hate that thing) & the tv flickered like smth walked between me and it even tho NOTHING was in the room with me except my own panic which honestly felt like it had legs at that point.

Then she whispered my nickname.  
not my regular name,
the childhood one,the one no one uses cuz the person  who used it is gone.  
my whole chest cracked open, i actually cried out loud.  

  “Why did you lock it?”  
her voice sounded confused. hurt even. like… why wouldnt i open the door for her??  

Two slow taps,Like she was practising a rhythm she barely learned.

Then nothing except that pressed-in silence that makes ur ears go warm & cold at the same time.

In the morning i opened the door & saw the 5 long marks at the VERY top of the frame. too spaced out,too high, the wood was warm.  

She wasnt trying to get IN,she was waiting for me 2 COME OUT.

and i swear i’m not imagining it but
something just moved behind the door again...

1pahdr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1pahdr0/weird_family_circumstances/,Weird family circumstances,"I’m 29F and married living abroad. Though I feel stressed on most of the days because of parental family especially my siblings.

I always had a different mindset from my siblings and was always blamed for every mistake that my younger brother makes.
I belong to a conservative country and my whole family is also one of those. 

My brother grew up to be big losers and patriarchal to the next level. They always wanted to rule over the women in the family but I never let them walk over me. It was too difficult for me because my father was sick in bed and my mother was too weak to protect me. She never disciplined her sons and put all the pressure on daughters. 

Thankfully I went to good educational institutes and met different strong women and had a good influence over me.

One of my brother got engaged to my sisters’ husband’s cousin sister (lets call her A) and she was my friend from even before that. 

I never realised that she was a backstabber.
She started talking shit about me to my brother and my brother already didn’t like my outgoing behaviour. She added spice to his feelings about me. She compared herself to me and to satisfy her jealousy she ranted to my brother with lies about me

During that time, I was working in a toxic workplace and a senior guy started bullying me by making unprofessional remarks sabotaging my work and making me miserable overall just because he tried to flirt and I pushed him away.

On the other hand at home my brother’s behaviour at home was horrible with me. 
He used to scream at every opportunity possible and what not and poor me didn’t know what his fiancée (A) was upto.

I switched job and A asked me why I switched job and I told her that there was a guy ( K) and I didn’t know his intentions at first. He started making moves on me and I said No that he couldn’t take. Actually I told her that one time I had to stay late at work and there was no one at home that could pick me up. I lived in a remote area and it was not safe to take taxi at that time. My HR told me: Hey you should go with K. He will drop you off and I was naive enough to say yes.

On our way he started talking about his past love life and offered that we should grab a coffee and sit somewhere bla bla. 

I politely said no and told him to quickly drop me off. I could see the anger on his face like he was so pissed that he used all that petrol for nothing. 

But (A) interpreted this story to my brother as 
I’m a loose character girl and I attract boys towards me at my workplace and named that K boy infront of him to confirm him that whatever she is saying is authentic.

There was no point in the story where it shows that I lured that guy towards me and something was going on between us instead I left the job because of that piece of shit. 

A huge fight started at my home when my brother called me a 3rd class girl blah blah and I told him that I will complain about you to your fiancée and she will straighten your head.
Innocent me thought she was my friend and an educated girl. In the heat of moment he spilled that she is the one who told me about your this and that story with that guy’s name.

When I tried to talk to her she blocked me and I moved on with my life. My sister is another stupid character. Since A is her sister in law she started calming her down instead of taking my side until she realized later that A was also brainwashing my brother about her as well.

Now my sister always brings up A into our conversations and when I get angry and tell her I don’t want to talk about her, she gaslights me oh why do you boil your blood. Also she blames me for whatever happened that if I didn’t have shared my office stories to A then she wouldn’t have anything against me. She always blames me. I haven’t talked to my sister for around 6 months now and life is comparatively peaceful.
Now I am just worried when we have to go back to our home country and see her face again and listen to her stupid typical bullshit. It makes me angry for a long time….
Sometimes I wonder if it is okay to completely cut off your siblings

1pahdqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1pahdqi/coworker_got_fired_for_faking_inspections/,coworker got fired for faking inspections,"i work in environmental compliance which sounds boring but basically i inspect industrial sites to make sure they're following environmental regulations. waste disposal, air quality, that stuff



field inspections are honestly the best part because you get out of the office and you get paid mileage. like if you finish early you can just go home instead of coming back to sit at your desk



my coworker chad LOVES field inspections. volunteers for them constantly. probably does 3 or 4 a week when most of us do like 1 or 2



so last month my boss marlene asks me to shadow chad on an inspection because it's a new client and she wants two people there. standard thing we do sometimes



i meet chad at the site. it's this manufacturing place maybe 40 minutes outside boise? i had my coffee in the car and spilled some on my shirt on the way there which was annoying



anyway we pull into the parking lot and chad immediately starts taking photos. of the building. from his car



i'm waiting for him to finish and i'm like ""are we going inside or""



he goes ""oh yeah in a minute i just like to get exterior shots first""



so he takes like 15 pictures of the outside of the building from different angles. through the windshield. doesn't even get out of the car



then he goes ""okay i think that's good""



and i'm like... what? we haven't even gone inside yet??



he looks at me like i'm the weird one and says ""i mean we can go in if you want but usually i just do a visual inspection from outside. if everything looks good from here there's no need to bother them""



i just stared at him



that's not how this works. we have to actually INSPECT things. go inside. check their waste logs. look at storage procedures. verify monitoring equipment. the whole point



i said ""chad we need to go inside that's literally the job""



he got all defensive like ""i've been doing this for 3 years i know what i'm doing""



so i'm like fine i'm going in with or without you and he follows me but he's clearly annoyed about it



the actual inspection took like 90 minutes. we found some minor violations they need to fix. chad barely did anything just stood there on his phone



on the drive back i'm thinking about all his previous inspections. he's always gone for like 6 or 7 hours for what should be a 2-3 hour thing max. where the hell has he been



i didn't want to just throw him under the bus without being sure so i mentioned to marlene that the inspection went fine but took longer because we did a thorough walkthrough



marlene's like ""longer? chad's reports usually show 5-6 hours on site""



that's when i knew something was fucked



so i asked if i could look at chad's mileage logs and gps data. we have gps in the company vehicles which i forgot about honestly but it tracks everything



oh my god



chad's been going to the inspection sites, staying for like 20-30 minutes tops, then just... leaving. and going to random places. movie theaters. shopping centers. restaurants



one inspection he was supposed to be at this facility in mountain home which is like an hour away. gps shows he got there at 9am, left at 9:30, then was at a target in meridian from 10am to 1pm



his mileage claim for that day said 6.5 hours of fieldwork



TARGET. he was at TARGET for 3 hours during a paid inspection



marlene pulled him into her office with hr. showed him the gps logs. he tried to say the gps was wrong but like. timestamped location data for MONTHS



fired on the spot. didn't even finish the day. watched him pack up his desk and leave



now we have to go back and re-inspect every single site chad claimed to inspect in the past year because we genuinely don't know if he actually did any of them properly



some of us might have to work weekends to catch up. i'm annoyed about that



also the company might get in legal trouble if any of those facilities had violations that chad didn't catch because he was too busy at target buying... idk, home decor? groceries? 



what do you even do at target for 3 hours



anyway yeah. don't commit fraud i guess. especially if your company vehicle has gps",532,1764506516.0,coworkerstories,67,0.99,False

1pahcu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pahcu7/masks/,Masks,"

Tina checked her face in the car mirror. 

The dark circles didn’t lie. Nor did the heavy grooves running from her nostrils to the corners of her lips. Oh god, she felt she could see them deepen in real time. 

But nobody else could see them. She needed her mask. She couldn’t risk the other moms or Noah seeing her like this. The school bell would ring in about two minutes, which was as much time as it would take for her mask to “settle” on her face. Even being out like this- by the school fully surrounded by other parents and cars- was risky. She should have put it on before she left the house. 

But she wanted that fresh air on her face- just a splash of that cool lowlighted fall sun.      

At least she had already taken her mask out of its container and thrown it on the empty passenger seat next to her- a piece of crumpled, translucent plastic. She knew she didn’t take proper care of it, which was probably why it felt so uncomfortable, as the company customer reps were quick to point out when she called to complain. 

She picked it up, and looked at it for a second, turning it over. It felt warm, and soft. It was pleasant to the touch- just like human skin.  The colour was exactly what she had ordered –just a few shades lighter than her own, already contoured and bronzed in a tasteful, appropriate manner. 

It made her look so much better, happier, fresher- she knew that. But it was still itchy and uncomfortable. The customer service rep said they would look into a replacement, but also hinted she might be imagining it. And then made the comment about proper care. She had already had it for six months- the free replacement was over. But they had promised to get back to her as soon as they could. They were a good company.  

She smoothed the folds of the mask. It was exactly the temperature of human skin. Carefully, she lifted it, stretched it out a bit and stuck it into place on her face, smoothing it down over the curves and contours of her face and neck.  

The itching began immediately. She looked at herself again. She looked so good- almost as radiant as her wedding day. She remembered her mom saying that to her the first time she saw Tina in her mask. Somehow the comment hadn’t pleased her.

She felt the mask tighten and “grip” into her skin. The masks were  supposed to be intangible after the first few moments- you weren’t supposed to feel them on your face at all. But that’s not how Tina felt it. If anything, the itchiness became worse. 

Noah slammed into the car. Tina turned towards him, stretching her lips into a bright smile.   

“Easy Tiger!” she said merrily. Noah didn’t answer, just stared out of the window. He was always in a terrible mood when she picked him up. 

There was a knock on the window. Tina turned, thanking god she had her mask on. It was Sandra, another mom on pick-up, also masked and smiling.  

“Hi you!” exclaimed Sandra, her eyes glinting at Tina. “We should get the boys together this weekend!” 

“I’ll check his schedule- I think we have a free spot on Sunday at 2!” Tina chirped back. They exchanged a few more pleasantries on how busy the kids were and how gorgeous this November was turning out. 

In these parenting circles, it wasn’t ok to sound depressed or tired anymore, and especially not when you were masked. Save that shit for the therapist who’s paid to put up with it. It was fine to mention how busy you were, running around for the kids’ schedule, but that had to be done in a bright, “sparky” manner. So much research had been done on how parents who showed irritation, misery, annoyance, worry or just simple fatigue could cause anxiety in their kids- it could even impact their schooling and future mental health! That was why the masks had become such an essential tool in any parent’s toolbox.       

Tina drove off. Without thinking, she itched her cheek furiously, and Noah shot her a look. She checked herself and shot him a wide smiling glance. She knew the research- she was a responsible, devoted mother after all, and knew it was harmful for children to see their parents unhappy or uncomfortable- they had to know they were safe and happy. This nugget of childhood development was what really sold the masks to parents, now the primary consumers of the objects which had started as high fashion. Especially mothers. 

Stella was leaving as Tina and Noah walked in- at fourteen, she came and went as she pleased. They crossed each other in the hallway. She scowled at Tina. “It's not fair!” she snapped, ignoring Tina’s cheerful “Hello love! How was school today!”

Stella continued. “Rana just got her first mask for her birthday, she literally looks like Sabrina when she puts it on. Why can’t I have one for my fifteenth? I’m literally going to be the only girl showing up to class with a mask!” 

Tina looked at her daughter’s soft flushed angry expression, her teenage  acne, her knitted brows, and sighed. It was true. Children were getting masks younger and younger. There was nothing wrong with it- in fact some child specialists argued it was an important phase of self-expression.  

The itching seemed to reach Tina's eyeballs. With a sudden cry, she ripped off her mask, in a painful, uncontrolled movement, and threw it on the floor.   

Noah and Stella froze at the rare sight of their mother’s naked face. Red welts ran up her cheeks and across her forehead. Tina, horrified at what she had done, covered her face with her hands.   

Then the children unfroze. Stella banged through the front door, making an inarticulate sound. Noah wordlessly went into the kitchen, picked up Tina’s half-drunk stale cup of coffee left from the morning, and came up and pushed the mug towards her.

There are two core contentions between these machines that hold up my decision.

1. PID & Gauge

 The Lelit has both of these. The Gaggia has neither. Is the consistency worth the extra Rs. 10,000? Does pressure feedback affect things materially on every single shot? What is the daily and accumulated long-term penalty for not having PID? Is it frustrating enough for owners of the Gaggia to wish they had spent more?

2. Attachments

 How important is it to stick to the 58mm standard for attachments? Again, keep my disinclination towards modding in mind. The coffee machine is an appliance, not my side-project. If the stock portafilter, tamper and basket are good, then I will drive them into the ground before buying replacements.",1,1764505924.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False
1pah77y,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeas/comments/1pah77y/looking_for_gift_ideas_for_a_stamp_collecting_bf/,Looking for Gift Ideas for a Stamp Collecting BF to be Organised,"Hi all! I am looking for gift ideas for my bf to help him be more organised with his stamp collection. Now I know what you're thinking, 'get him an album or stamp evaluation book' and yes, he has plenty of those, but the issue comes from the way he obtains and sorts his stamps. He basically buys bags of them in bulk and sorts through them for anything interesting. He currently does this by sorting them into various piles on our coffee table, and then leaving them there until he's ready to continue sorting. He's reluctant to put anything in his albums because he will inevitably find more and then have to shift everything around to make room. The act of sorting stamps, going through them one by one, researching them, learning about their history, and all that, this is what he enjoys. He's not looking for a Penny Black or anything like that (though I'm sure he'd love to stumble across one!) but he enjoys the relaxing nature of sorting things. I love that he has found this activity, as it's great to see him take time away from his phone and computer, and I love when tells me about interesting things he finds. 

But as you might see, the way he goes about sorting his stamps causes problems for him (and for me haha). For one I'd like the coffee table back! And it also causes him problems, as his stamps are being kept in the open to be blown around by people passing by etc. So, I am looking for ideas for an organisation solution for him. Something that will let him sort things into different sections and will protect those various sections from being disturbed. 

I was thinking something like a jewellery box or an old sewing box could work - but am eager to hear any other suggestions!

I run Vibe & Flow a tiny Pilates grip sock brand built around inclusion, representation, and celebrating cultural heritage through fun designs (like Vietnamese Coffee, Lucky Cat, Karaoke Shiba!) It started because I noticed most grip socks felt the same and looked the same, and I wanted something that actually felt like me and also grips well in my workouts.

1pah684,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1pah684/i_accidentally_catfished_my_own_brother_for_six/,I accidentally catfished my own brother for six months and kind of fixed his life,"A few years ago my brother went through a pretty rough patch. Break up, dropped out of college, moved back home, the whole cliché. We are not super emotional as a family, so the vibe at home was just him in his room with the door closed and my parents pretending everything was fine.

Back then I was spending way too many nights on this small gaming Discord server. Very low stakes, a few regulars, mostly talking about games, work, life, whatever. People joined and left all the time.

One night this new user joins, calls himself “lostinmidgame” and starts venting in voice chat. It was oddly specific stuff. Talking about how his ex used to say he had no ambition, how he felt like he ruined his life dropping out, how he did not want to be the disappointment of the family.

It hit way too close to home. I typed to one of the regulars like, “This sounds exactly like my brother, wtf.”

A day later, “lostinmidgame” posts a selfie in the pet channel with his dog. I nearly dropped my phone. It was my brother. Same dog, same ugly couch from our living room in the background. He had found this random Discord through some Reddit comment and had no idea I was in there under an old username he did not know.

So now I am sitting there, listening to my brother trauma dump to complete strangers instead of talking to any of us. And I froze. I did not tell him. I did not tell the server. I just muted my mic and listened.

That should have been the end of it.

But then he started coming on every night. He would hop in, talk about job hunting, feeling like a failure, how he missed who he used to be, and the regulars would give advice. Most of them were nice but not very helpful. Stuff like, “Bro just grind and it will work out” which is basically nothing.

At some point one of the regulars joked that the server needed an “old wise uncle” to give proper life advice. I do not know what possessed me, but I made a second account. Brand new email, different voice settings, deeper tone, all of that. I joined as “UncleRay”.

I pretended to be in my forties, divorced, working some boring office job. I borrowed stories from coworkers and older cousins, mixed them together, and played this fake older guy who had already made every mistake in the book.

And my brother clicked with “UncleRay” immediately.

He would join the call and say “Ray, you on tonight?” and I would change my mic settings and answer in that slightly lower voice. I started giving him the kind of advice I always wanted to give him as myself, but was too awkward to say to his face. Stuff like:

“Make a stupid small goal for tomorrow, then do it. Clean one corner of your room. Apply to one job that feels slightly too high for you. You are allowed to be scared and still do it.”

It felt easier coming from a fake older guy than from his sibling who he thought did not understand him.

He started sending me his resume to “look over.” So now I am literally editing my brother’s resume under a fake name. I knew his work history anyway, so it was not hard to give specific suggestions.

Then it got more personal. He would type me long DMs about how he always felt like the background character in his own life, how he thought I was the “smart one” growing up, how he respected me but felt like he could not talk to me because I always seemed busy.

Reading that as “UncleRay” while knowing he was talking about me was one of the weirdest experiences of my life. I was sitting there with this knot in my chest, trying not to cry at my own computer while typing back like some budget therapist.

The messed up part is that it worked.

Within a few months he got a part time office job. Then a full time offer. He started going to the gym with a coworker. The way he talked in the server changed. Less self pity, more “I tried this and it actually helped.”

One night he said in voice chat, “Honestly, if I had not met you guys, especially you Ray, I think I would still be in bed all day. So, like, thanks man.”

I muted my mic and just sat there staring at the screen. I had no idea how to even process that.

But the longer it went on, the worse I felt. Every time he said “love you, old man” or “you saved my life, Ray” I felt like I was stealing something. Like I had taken this role in his life that should have been real.

I tried to slowly distance “UncleRay.” I said I was getting busier at work. Logged on less. Sent shorter replies. Encouraged him to talk to other people, to his actual friends, to his family.

Then the guilt finally snapped me in half one afternoon at home. He was in the kitchen, making coffee, humming this stupid song he always hums when he is in a good mood. He looked better than he had in years. Clean clothes, decent haircut, actually smiling.

He saw me and went,

""Yo, you heard of this Discord I am in? There is this old guy in there, legit the only adult who gets it. You would like him.""

I almost said it. Right there. I almost said, ""That is me, you idiot.""

Instead I just said, ""Nice, I am glad you found cool people.""

I went back to my room, opened the Discord, and deleted the “UncleRay” account on the spot. Did not say goodbye, did not explain anything. Just gone.

The next night I watched him check his phone, frown, refresh the app a few times. He looked a little disappointed at dinner and mentioned that Ray had not been online. I felt like a complete fraud.

He is still doing fine, by the way. Better than fine. He is working, saving money, talking about maybe going back to school part time. He still logs into that server sometimes and hangs out with the regulars. He seems proud of himself in a way I had not seen before.",70,1764505829.0,confessions,8,0.94,False

1pah46x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pah46x/aita_for_losing_it_at_my_mil_because_she_tried_to/,AITA for losing it at my MIL because she tried to gaslight my husband into thinking he was overreacting?,"Thanks everyone for the advice and opinions on my previous post. Updating as a few asked. 

TLDR for Part 1: In-laws (51F & 60M) took drugs at family get together for FIL’s 60th birthday. My husband (24M) and I (24F) have 2 year old daughter who was also present at the lunch. There’s previously been issues so MIL told people not to tell us they were high. We’re not comfortable with her having daughter now. 

To read the full story, you can find it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p7x0lg/aita_for_losing_it_at_my_mil_because_she_tried_to/

FIL called my husband on Friday to say he wanted to catch up to have a chat on Sunday about the current situation. We went in skeptical but eventually agreed to get a coffee with him on Sunday Morning. 

On Friday, MIL transferred us money for daughter’s swim classes. We promptly returned it as that was one of the leverage points she tried using in our phone conversation with her. This lead to her to add herself, FIL, husband, and I to a group chat to berate us about not accepting the money. Husband explained that we didn’t want to accept any more money from her but she wasn’t satisfied with the response and was asking FIL to back her up. FIL didn’t say anything in the chat as we were going to be talking to him on the Sunday. 

This morning (Sunday) we received a passive aggressive message from MIL with a picture of the invitation for the birthday party she wanted to take daughter to, trying to make out that we should feel guilty that daughter is missing out. 

The conversation with FIL was interesting, to say the least. For the first approximately 10-20 minutes, he was talking to us as if there was no problem at all. After our food had arrived at the cafe, he abruptly changed the topic by saying “Okay, we need to talk about your mum.” 

We started by asking how much she had actually told him, and unsurprisingly, it was just information that she had skewed to make herself seem like the victim. We have previously had extensive conversations with MIL about not wanting daughter around drugs, this was not information that had been passed on to FIL (not that it should really matter because surely that’s a no-brainer). 

FIL also hadn’t been made aware of the fact that OBIL was told not to tell us specifically by name. 

FIL mentioned that he didn’t think MIL was using the money as leverage so we started going in to details of the phone call (he works night shifts so wasn’t home at the time of the call). 

Finally, we mentioned to him about a message that MIL sent to all husband’s siblings. The message outlined that MIL couldn’t trust any of them to keep secrets to themselves and that now none of them can trust what she says because she’s never going to be truely honest again (definitely not the way to regain the trust of your grandkid’s parents 🥴). 

We told him that the biggest issue wasn’t even the drug use, it’s the lack of respect for our wishes and the consistent lying and lack of remorse for the whole situation. 

He started trying to come up with excuses for her behaviour, saying that she’s had a hard life and that she’s got an addictive personality, etc. but as we kept telling him how she’d been acting, he slowing started to agree that her behaviour has been completely inexcusable. 

Eventually FIL was asking what it would take for us to let MIL have daughter again and he was trying to ask us to “build a bridge” for his sake, as he’s the one that has to put up with her persistent whinging. 

We told him that she’s broken our trust and she can’t even admit that she’s got a problem and that until there is some kind of breakthrough in her life, she won’t be having daughter. We told them that they can still see her with us present, at a neutral location. 

FIL continued pushing by asking whether they’d be able to have her without us if he was around to keep an eye on MIL. We explained that it wouldn’t be an option as he is too close to MIL, and knowing her, she would be able to convince him to leave for an hour or two. We said to him that it wouldn’t be a fair situation as that would be asking him to choose between the wishes of his kid and his wife.

He then was trying to say “well what if you get assurances from her that she’ll be sober for the 24 hours before watching daughter” to which we told him that she’s broken our trust so her assurances hold no weight for us. 

He then steered the conversation in a very strange direction, asking if we knew about MIL’s sexuality. We’d previously talked to husband’s sister, who said, during one of MIL’s drunken rants, MIL was talking about previous sexual conquests, and her best girl friend’s (BGF, 60?F) name had come up. We mentioned this and said that we didn’t think much of it at the time as Sister and MIL don’t have the best relationship, so we thought she was just making up gossip (that and we really don’t care what MIL wants to do in consensual situations). We mentioned what sister had said to which he nodded as if he was confirming what we were saying, and went on to say that MIL had been unfaithful to him, so he no longer wore his wedding band. 

I’m not exactly sure the reason he even brought up the infidelity to begin with, but on further reflection, I think that was his way of saying “well I don’t trust her, but I still put up with her, and you should too.”

We explained to him that although she’s been unfaithful to us in a different way, we still have a similar feeling to what he explained, there will always be a sense of doubt as to whether she’s actually being honest, or just saying what we want to hear. 

By the end of our conversation, he seemed like he fully understood the situation, what we are upset about, and what MIL had been doing. We were pleasantly surprised to have him on our side, although realised later that he never actually apologised for his part in the situation, he mostly came up with excuses for it. As we were leaving, he gave us a hug and told us to be safe and keep daughter safe. 

We had told them both our piece and given them the opportunity to explain, so we believed all conversation regarding the situation had concluded. 

We were wrong. 

FIL called us while we were eating dinner and seemed quite detached and squirrelly. He was saying that he’d talked to sister and that she hadn’t recalled talking to us about MIL and BGF and he was asking where we’d really heard that, as it was untrue. We reiterated that it was something we heard from sister and we’d only brought it up because he’d asked. It wasn’t something we had spread around, let alone even mentioned to anyone else and at the time we mentioned it, he was acting as if it was something he was confirming and knew about.

This line of conversation lead to “Well clearly there’s been a lack of open honest communication and we just need to bridge the issue and get back to normal.” 

Husband and I were both confused because he’d offered that information just today, without prompt, and it seemed like he was trying to relay as if that was the main problem for the current situation. 

Husband told FIL that he was confused as to how that had anything to do with the current situation and why we’re upset. 

He didn’t really have a good response for that, and started going on a tangent about how it was unfair that we would judge them for what they’d do, when we don’t judge my parents for the decisions they make. 

When Husband and I first found out I was pregnant, we weren’t married yet and our families hadn’t met so MIL and FIL invited my dad and step-mother over for drinks and lunch so they could get to know each other. Dad and S-Mum were there most of the day, right up until after dinner, so they did go through a bit of wine but they were also eating and dad didn’t have as much as S-Mum as he knew he had to drive. This was one of the things FIL brought up as being something we should judge my dad for, as he’d been drinking and drove home. He doesn’t actually know what our reaction was at the time and that was over 3 years ago! My dad is the most loving and playful grandad you’d ever meet now. 

The point FIL said we should judge my mum on was that she didn’t get the COVID Vaccine. This argument point honestly just puzzled me as, not only has it been proven to not work and cause different issues, I wouldn’t have gotten it if it wasn’t so severely mandated in the country I live in. (We’re not anti-vaxxers btw and I don’t need opinions of vaccines in the comments)

After FIL came up with these examples, I stepped in and explained to him that he was “completely missing our point” (likely intentionally). We explained that we’re not judging them for what they want to do in their own time, we’re upset about the betrayal of trust and blatant disrespect for our wishes. 

After I finished speaking, FIL said “Well, just to let you know, we’ve changed all the locks on the house and only your mum and I will have the key, and since we’re no longer going to be looking after our granddaughter we don’t need any of her things at our house so you can organise a time with us for you to come retrieve them.”

Husband said to them that that’s fine and that we could do that if they wanted us to and the conversation ended quite promptly after that. 

The entire phone call we could hear MIL in the background, we couldn’t hear exactly what she was saying but we think she was just telling him what to say. Also, the entire time, it sounded as if he was on something but we weren’t sure whether he was quite drunk or had taken more drugs. The way he was acting made us think it was drugs rather than drinks, just as he was being about as comprehensible as he was when he’d taken LSD at his birthday party. 

If any further drama happens when we go to pick up daughter's things, I’ll update again, but honestly we’re just hoping that we can sort it without issues because we’re so beyond wanting to worry about this.

On **Thursday, December 11, from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. ET**, the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center, in partnership with FGS Global, will host the **2025 Critical Minerals Supply Chains Summit**, focused on the theme “From Mine to Market: Financing, Partnering, and Innovating for Mineral Security.”

This inaugural summit will convene senior government officials, industry leaders, and global experts to chart a path toward secure and competitive minerals supply chains. Demand for critical minerals is surging, and the United States is taking bold steps to expand production, strengthen processing, and drive innovative supply chain solutions. Through a series of high-level conversations, participants will explore how evolving US financing authorities, strategic global partnerships, and innovation-led resilience can unlock growth and secure the foundation of the energy and manufacturing economy.

Over the past year, there has been a monumental shift in how the United States, its international partners, and foreign adversaries approach minerals security. 2025 made one thing unmistakably clear: minerals security is inseparable from both national and economic security. Washington has moved beyond rhetoric to action—deploying bold new policy tools such as price floors, equity stakes, and offtake agreements—while embedding minerals strategy at the core of its foreign policy agenda.

Join the CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program for a flagship event, **Critical Minerals: 2025 Year in Review & Looking Ahead to 2026**, on **December 15, 2025**, from **9:00 am – 6:00 pm ET**. This full day gathering will bring together policymakers, industry executives, and thought leaders to reflect on key trends in critical mineral markets and policy over the past year and explore what lies ahead.

The event will feature a series of fireside chats and keynotes from **Jarrod Agen**, **Executive Director of the White House’s National Energy Dominance Council, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV**), and **Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN**), alongside panel discussions with leaders from government and industry. Speakers will explore how the minerals landscape has shifted in defense, domestic processing, and diplomacy, as well as offer a forward-looking forecast as the U.S. strengthens its mineral production and processing capabilities to meet evolving demand.

**December is shaping up to be the most important policy month for U.S. critical minerals in years — and it lands** ***directly after*** **NioCorp’s Dec. 5th Open House, where new drill assays could confirm the expanded TREO district.** The three major DC events (Atlantic Council’s Critical Minerals Supply Chain Summit on Dec. 11, CSIS’s “2025 Year in Review & 2026 Outlook” on Dec. 15, and DOE’s Critical Minerals Program Session on Dec. 16) all focus on *government financing tools, price-floor policy, domestic sourcing mandates, DPA/EXIM support, and securing supply chains for defense and clean energy.* This cluster of meetings is not just academic talk — it’s timed ahead of the FY2026 budget cycle and designed to set the *action list* for which projects will receive grants, loans, permitting accelerations, and offtake backing. In other words: December is where the government decides *who gets funded in 2026.*

**For NioCorp, the timing is extremely favorable.** If the Dec. 5 Open House provides positive drill assays and confirms Elk Creek’s larger TREO envelope, Niocorp enters these DC meetings with momentum at precisely the moment agencies and primes (DoD, EXIM, DOE, DFC, Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon) are preparing their 2026 “domestic supply” portfolios. Niocorp already checks the strategic-materials boxes: niobium for hypersonics & naval alloys, scandium for aluminum-scandium and advanced airframes, and Nd-Pr–Dy–Tb for magnet independence. December’s meetings could therefore elevate Niocorp from “project under review” to “priority U.S. supply-chain asset.” Combined with the expected DFS in early 2026, this December policy cycle may effectively set the stage for **price floors, offtake agreements, government financing windows, and accelerated permitting** — exactly the catalysts needed to push NioCorp toward FID in mid-2026 and finally force shorts to cover ahead of U.S. strategic capital entering the sector.

[The Rare Earth Metal Driving Tensions Between the US and China | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/yttrium-rare-earth-metal-china-us/)

**Yttrium plays a critical role in everything from aircraft engines to semiconductors. China controls the vast majority of the market—and that’s not changing anytime soon.**

[Inside a rare earths facility.Photograph: Doug Kanter; Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/o950s4wspd4g1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ee6b51faeda9517bbdd6e0f53d1bc1fcc365b11)

**The alarm hasn't** yet reached the general public, but tension is beginning to build in the corridors of the aerospace industry, in microchip laboratories, and in government offices. For months, an element almost invisible to the world—yttrium—has become the silent center of a new global dispute. Supplies are thinning, prices are skyrocketing, deliveries are stalling. And while China and the United States have [promised a truce over rare earth minerals](https://www.wired.com/story/rare-earth-minerals-china-tariffs/), the wheels of advanced technology are beginning to slow.

Although a late-October meeting in South Korea between Chinese president Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump raised hopes for a détente, the [Chinese export restrictions](https://www.wired.com/story/2-obscure-clean-energy-metals-are-caught-in-the-crosshairs-of-the-us-china-trade-war/) introduced last April remain substantially in place. Beijing granted a one-year reprieve on the mandatory government licensing system for shipments of rare earths and products containing related materials (including those made abroad with at least 0.1 percent Chinese resources), in exchange for a similar suspension of the White House's latest restrictions on technology supply chains.

But other measures introduced before the latest escalation remain in place. The result is a tightening of the international supply chain that threatens to slow advanced technological production, raise costs, and challenge entire industrial sectors. Yttrium plays a crucial role in the functioning of contemporary technologies. Without yttrium, the production of aircraft engines, high-efficiency turbines, advanced energy systems, and semiconductors would immediately slow down.

Yttrium's value lies in its ability to impart thermal and mechanical strength to materials subjected to extreme temperatures. Jet engines blades, for example, must withstand prolonged overheating and intense vibration; yttrium is what allows them to maintain structural integrity and efficiency. The same is true for industrial chip manufacturing, where yttrium-based coatings protect machinery from chemical wear and ensure precision in plasma etching. Its indispensable nature has made it a key element of modern technology and the military.

# China's Role

The problem is that, as with several other resources, China controls almost the entire global yttrium supply chain. Not only does it produce most of it, but it also has the know-how and infrastructure to refine and separate it from other rare earth minerals, a complex and technologically advanced process. According to US data, the United States imports 100 percent of its yttrium needs, 93 percent of which comes directly from China. Such stark dependence creates enormous geopolitical vulnerability.

When Beijing decided to introduce export restrictions as a response to US tariffs, the entire international supply structure began to falter. Companies reported delays, difficulties in obtaining licenses, and uncertainty about delivery times. In the rare earths trade, lack of predictability is often more damaging than reduced volumes: An industry accustomed to just-in-time deliveries can be thrown into crisis by even a few weeks of delay.

The effects were immediate. In Europe, yttrium oxide prices have soared, reaching a 4,400 percent increase since the beginning of the year. Aerospace companies, which rely heavily on this material, have expressed alarm and demanded urgent measures from the US government to expand domestic production. The semiconductor industry is no less concerned: Some companies have called the situation a “serious” threat, predicting impacts on costs, efficiency, and production timelines. Gas-fired power plants, which use yttrium in the protective coatings of turbines, are also monitoring Chinese developments with increasing attention, although they maintain that they have not yet experienced disruptions.

The situation in warehouses outside China adds further layers of complexity. Available reserves, according to piecemeal estimates, range from one to 12 months, depending on the producers. Some traders have already reported running out of material; from quantities in the hundreds of tons range, many are down to just a few units. Others are completely out of stock. This volatility makes the market extremely fragile and underscores how the global supply chain depends on a small number of players.

Chinese exports to several countries have fallen by about 30 percent. China, which aims to become an autonomous tech powerhouse, therefore maintains a position of strength and a high degree of discretion, carefully regulating the quantities released to the international market. Moreover, the measures introduced by Beijing in the sector from the outset are flexible enough to allow it to modulate the flow of shipments according to political priorities.

# Xi Puts US Defense in the Crosshairs

On the political front, the trade truce between Washington and Beijing has yet to produce concrete results. The two sides have given negotiators until the end of November to outline clearer terms for rare earth exports to the United States, but the gap between their respective priorities remains wide. Beijing continues to work on a licensing system, inspired by mechanisms already used by the United States, that would allow for faster flow only to companies deemed to have no ties to the US military industry. This would leave many Western companies operating in the delicate boundary between civilian production and defense applications at a disadvantage, further complicating access to materials.

China's strategy involves not only controlling trade flows, but also managing technical expertise internationally. Authorities have begun requiring detailed lists of technicians specializing in rare earths, restricting their travel abroad and monitoring potential transfers of expertise to rival countries. At the same time, bans on the export of advanced rare earth processing technologies continue, a sector in which China holds a leadership position that is unlikely to be replicated in the short term. This dual approach—control of physical resources and human capital—strengthens Chinese primacy and hampers attempts to build an alternative supply chain.

# US Countermoves and Alliance With Japan

The United States is nevertheless trying to fight back. New industrial projects, such as that of ReElement Technologies in Indiana, aim to produce yttrium oxide domestically starting in December, with an initial capacity of 200 tons per year, set to double within a few months. While this figure isn't enough to cover total US needs, it represents a first step toward diversification.

During Trump's recent visit to Asia, Japan and the United States signed an agreement to jointly exploit the giant Minamitori undersea deposit, discovered years ago in the Pacific seabed. Washington and Tokyo announced the launch of a joint study to develop technologies and infrastructure capable of extracting these strategic materials from extreme ocean depths, a feat that will require enormous investment and advanced technical cooperation.

Yet the absence of a complete supply chain—from extraction to refining—makes the transition slow and complex. China has no intention of giving up its dominant position, a crucial and potentially decisive negotiating lever.

# 🔥 The Yttrium Crisis Proves NioCorp MUST Be Built NOW...

# ⭐ Net Result for NioCorp

This WIRED story — combined with the December Open House, pending DC policy events — pushes NioCorp up the strategic priority list because:

# ✔ Heavy REEs (Dy/Tb) are now recognized as the next crisis (*Niobium, *Dysprosium & *Terbium top 10 USGS list)

# ✔ DoD wants domestic supply before 2030

# ✔ NioCorp’s DFS is coming in early 2026

# ✔ Elk Creek is the only near-term heavy REE + Sc/Nb/Ti source ~ SEVEN Critical Minerals at one site!

# ✔ Lockheed, Boeing, and Raytheon are already lobbying for these materials. Lockheed working with DoD & Niocorp/IBC on ScAl alloys.

# ✔ MP Materials alone cannot meet military demand!

**NioCorp’s Seven-metal basket is now more important than EVER.**  
The geopolitical, economic, and defense environment is aligning to make Elk Creek a **“U.S. National Security Asset”!**

The *WIRED* article on **yttrium** quietly exposes the bigger truth Washington has been afraid to say out loud: **China completely dominates the heavy rare earth chain**, including Dy, Tb, Y, and other elements essential for missiles, hypersonics, night-vision systems, lasers, fighters, and every next-gen weapon the U.S. is racing to deploy. What the article *doesn’t* say — but absolutely matters — is that the U.S. has **one project** capable of producing BOTH heavy and light magnet materials **plus** the aerospace alloys needed for NGAD, F-35, Aegis, nuclear subs, and hypersonics: **NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project.**

NioCorp’s **Seven-material basket** is strategically irreplaceable: **Scandium (for ScAl), Niobium, Titanium/TiCl₄, Neodymium, Praseodymium, Terbium, and Dysprosium.** No other U.S. project delivers heavy REEs (Dy/Tb) + light REEs (Nd/Pr) + superalloy metals (Sc/Nb/Ti) in a single, DFARS-compliant, domestic source.

DoD is staring at a 2027–2032 bottleneck in hypersonics, lasers, radars, and fighter production — EXACTLY the systems that depend on the metals Elk Creek will produce. With the December DC critical minerals meetings, the 2026 DFS, Title III funding windows, and new federal price-support programs being drafted, the writing is on the wall: **Elk Creek isn’t optional anymore; it’s mandatory.** The U.S. cannot meet its defense goals without this mine!

**Bottom line:** The WIRED piece just confirmed what we already knew! —  **Elk Creek must be built ASAP, and 2026–2029 will be the acceleration window.** The seven-metal basket is no longer a “nice to have” — it’s the most strategically important mineral suite in the United States.

**This is why the NDAAs flag these materials.**  
This is why Lockheed, Boeing, DOE, AMES, and defense labs keep circling back.  
This is why IBC, Nanoscale, Creative Engineers, L-3 processing, & other partners work matters!!  
And this is why **IMHO** a full **mine → oxide → alloy → component** ecosystem is forming around Elk Creek.

**No other U.S. critical minerals project checks every box at once — not MP, not Lynas USA, not anyone!**

Niocorp is the only one that can become a **single-site strategic metals hub** powering multiple defense and industrial supply chains at the same time.
