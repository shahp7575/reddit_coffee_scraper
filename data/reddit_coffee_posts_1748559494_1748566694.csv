1kyr8l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHealth/comments/1kyr8l4/21m_no_energy_despite_healthy_lifestyle_looking/,21M – No Energy Despite Healthy Lifestyle (Looking for Any Insight),"I’m writing this because I’m out of options. I’m a 21-year-old male and I have zero energy. I eat pretty healthy (high protein, rice, fruits), I work out regularly, and I ride my bike 6 miles almost every day. I recently went in for my yearly physical and all of my blood work came back normal. My thyroid was a little bit low, so I thought that might be the issue and started taking iodine, but I’ve noticed no difference.

All day I just feel tired. I feel like I have to force myself to do anything, and I never feel like my true self. The only times I feel like myself are when I drink moderately on the weekends (not enough to be causing this) or the few times I’ve taken my buddy’s Adderall in the past.

I feel like I’ve tried everything. I’ve basically cut bread out of my diet. I’ve stopped drinking for a month — no difference. I drink coffee during the day just to get a little more energy, but all it really does is make me jittery and honestly feel worse.

I’m not depressed — I actually love my life. I just wish I had more energy to enjoy it.

I also sleep over 10 hours every night, and still find it nearly impossible to wake up in the morning. I have to force myself to get up, and when I do, I feel like absolute shit for the first 30 minutes even though I sleep really well. I go to bed around 10 p.m. and usually wake up around 8:30 or 9 a.m.

It’s frustrating because I feel like my parents have more energy than me — and I’m way younger and take care of myself way better. I honestly feel like I’m missing out on so much of life feeling like this. It’s hard to see others with so much energy and drive when I want to feel like that too.

Sorry this is so long — I just wanted to include everything. If anyone has any ideas, advice, or has gone through something similar, please let me know. I didn’t always feel like this — I think it started around late 17 or early 18.

1kyr89q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlcoholicParents/comments/1kyr89q/one_final_outcome/,One final outcome,"I am a 27 y/o man with an alcoholic father who was not present most of my life. I got a call on May 15th from my father’s sister. She told me that my father had passed away and that she didn’t have a ton of info as she was only the emergency contact and not the next of kin. That night I had to tell my mom and younger brother. The next day I received a call from the coroner of the county to give me information. They told me he had been there for 6-8 weeks in his apt since he died, and was found by a maintenance man posting his second late rent notice. I authorized an autopsy and started making arrangements to travel to that county to sign for his belongings and begin cleaning out his apartment. Cleaning out the apartment was the most traumatic thing I have ever done, he had just moved in to this apartment and didn’t even unpack anything. The entire apartment looked like wild dogs had been living there using the whole place as a toilet and ordering ipa six packs on DoorDash. Apparently it is known as coffee ground emesis and is a symptom of end stage alcoholism. He didn’t ever reach out for help from anyone. He was going through tons of Valium from a dark web source and the spot where he was found in his apartment has basically been dissolved from where he laid on it.

I don’t know how I am going to go forward, I keep having nightmares and not eating. I have to be back at work and I can barely function or take care of myself.

The last time I saw my dad was the first time in over a year and a half and he was not doing well. I can’t stop blaming myself for not intervening and forcing him to go to treatment or something. The fact he never reached out to ask for help or anything is so disheartening.

Please help.

Edit: we are currently planning his memorial and trying to find out how to proceed with removing his totality of belongings from his apartment with assistance from a biohazard specialist. The problem is it’s so far away and I don’t trust people who I can’t meet first.

He also has a storage unit that is extremely far away. This has affected every aspect of my life negatively and it has been really hard to find support anywhere which is why I’m posting here.",1,1748566408.0,AlcoholicParents,0,1.0,False
1kyr7lo,https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1kyr7lo/review_6_jack_daniels_single_barrel_barrel_proof/,Review #6: Jack Daniels Single Barrel Barrel Proof Rye,"

https://preview.redd.it/j8x0ij4xht3f1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d256f1cced3acd1780262a852c3e8140e3a9fe74

Jack Daniels Single Barrel Barrel Proof Rye

Distillery: Jack Daniels

Age: NAS

Price: $59.99 (best price I've seen)

Proof: 132.5

Nose: much less rye spice than expected, a little underlying sweetness almost like a shortbread cookie dipped into coffee, menthol, honeysuckle, black pepper, slight dill

Palate: would think its closer to 110 proof than 132.5, easy to sip, a little hot but it doesn't feel like you're nearing hazmat territory by any means, more rye spice than came from the nose, some cereal grain and allspice, a touch of vanilla icing sweetness, the slightest bitterness but not necessarily off putting

Finish: on the longer side but again not in your face considering the proof point, more dilly rye, cinnamon but more along the lines of a baked cinnamon apple than a cinnamon stick, warming, campfire-like, enjoyable

Score: 7.6

Summary: Who doesn't love the good old Jack Daniels distillery? This is just more confirmation that their barrel proof stuff is fantastic. As a bourbon drinker through and through I don't often venture into rye's, but had been wanting to get this bottle for awhile. Was expecting a bomb of intense rye flavors that weren't necessarily in line with my preferred flavor profile, but was pleasantly surprised. Well balanced, high proof, lots of flavor, lots to explore, but also not in your face. Just a great sip. Gave it a 7.6 which is an outstanding score. Part of the score was influenced by the fact I paid $59.99. I can't give it an 8 because that would beputting it into very rare territory, but it's certainly pretty close. Worth trying even if you're not into rye's. Oh yeah and this pour was my bottle kill, so there's the proof I enjoyed it.

Rating Scale

1. Terrible | Drain pour after the first sip
2. Very Bad | Trying to choke it down but possible drain pour
3. Poor | Would drink if forced to but never under my own will
4. Below Average | Not off-putting but not my cup of tea
5. Average | I'll take it
6. Good | Enjoyable sip
7. Very Good | Well above average
8. Excellent | A drink I will remember
9. Incredible | Something truly extraordinary
10. Best of the best | Peak Bourbon

Recently I was in a highway reststop bathroom and saw two quarters on the floor in front of the toilet stalls. I left the bathroom to get a coffee but could not stop thinking about those quarters. I got my coffee and then went back to the bathroom. I picked them up and then washed them (and my hands!) Thoroughly.

Yerba mate is a tea type beverage drunk hot or cold and it's very healthy. It was popularized in Syria by the Druze community after returning back from Argentina.
It has the beneficial compounds found in coffee, chocolate,and tea and has an energizing effect without the typical coffee crash.

I wonder if the Isaeli Druze or anyone have adopted it.

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zghhOJ8)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! What is the best movie or tv show that you’ve watched recently?

**How I Successfully Quit Smoking Cold Turkey**

Quitting smoking was one of the hardest but most rewarding challenges of my life. After failing multiple times, I finally stopped for good nine years ago. Here’s the method I used, focusing on **Mental, Emotional, Social, Relationships, and Physical** aspects.

# 1. Mental Preparation

* I started by educating myself on different techniques and found **Allen Carr’s ""Easy Way to Stop Smoking""**. While I didn’t finish the book, I skimmed through key ideas and watched testimonials on YouTube.
* I made quitting **a clear goal**: Before turning 30, I wanted to be free from my bad habits, especially smoking. At the time, I was 28.
* I challenged the **false beliefs** that kept me addicted. I had convinced myself that smoking had benefits, but I flipped my reasoning. Instead of viewing cigarettes as an escape, I began seeing them as a **trap**—an illusion that kept me in prison.
* I imagined my **non-smoking self** as a brand-new version of me, completely free. I focused on the joy and health I once had as a child, living without worry.

# 2. Emotional Reinforcement: Painful Consequences vs. Positive Rewards

#  The Painful Consequences of Smoking

To make quitting feel urgent, I imagined the worst possible outcomes if I continued smoking:

* **My family might resent me** for neglecting my health. My future children might **shout at me** in frustration if I couldn’t walk properly due to lung disease.
* If I lost my ability to speak due to throat cancer, I imagined my loved ones **staring at me with pity and regret**, wishing I had made better choices.
* My siblings might **cry out in anger**, saying, *""You knew smoking was killing you, but you still let it happen!""*
* My friends might look at me with **disappointment**, knowing I ignored their advice to quit.
* If I ended up in a hospital bed, struggling to breathe, **I would become a burden to those around me**.

**How My Friends Might React**

* I pictured myself at a **social gathering**, sitting alone because my bad health made me too weak to join in. My friends would **look at me with pity**, saying, *""I wish he had quit smoking when he had the chance.""*

# How My Own Body Would Betray Me

* I pictured myself **trapped in a hospital bed**, unable to walk, unable to breathe properly.
* I imagined **struggling to speak**, barely able to whisper because my throat was damaged beyond repair.
* I saw myself **on an oxygen machine**, dependent on a device just to do something as basic as breathing.

# The Shame of Addiction

* I feared becoming **a cautionary tale**—the smoker who ignored the warnings and suffered the worst outcome.
* I imagined **friends and family pitying me**, seeing me as someone who wasn’t strong enough to break free.
* The thought of **my children growing up fearing cigarettes** because they saw firsthand what it did to me felt unbearable.

These painful emotions made quitting smoking feel **urgent and necessary**. I refused to let this imagined future become reality.

* I imagined **my best friends losing respect for me**, knowing I ignored their advice to quit.
* If I ended up sick, I feared hearing my friends say, *""Man, you did this to yourself. You had the chance to stop, but you didn’t.""*
* I saw myself in a scenario where **my friends moved on without me**, living healthy lives while I remained stuck, suffering because of my addiction.
* Worst of all, I imagined some friends **using me as an example**: *""Don't be like him. He knew smoking would ruin him, and now look at him—he's barely hanging on.""* That thought alone was devastating.

#  The Positive Rewards of Quitting

To counter those fears, I focused on the **best possible version of myself**—healthy, free, and thriving:

* **My family would respect me** for making a smart decision. My children would **see me as a strong role model**, someone who conquered addiction.
* I imagined my siblings **proudly supporting me**, knowing I chose discipline over self-destruction.
* My friends would **admire my willpower**, saying, *""Man, you did it! I wish I had your discipline.""*
* Instead of being weak and sick, I saw myself **full of energy, laughing, and enjoying life to the fullest**.
* I pictured myself waking up every morning feeling **fresh, breathing deeply**, and feeling **free from cravings**.
* I imagined **running effortlessly**, my lungs strong and full of life.
* My voice would remain **clear**, my skin **glowing**, and my body completely **free of toxins**.
* Instead of shame, I would feel **empowered**, looking in the mirror and saying, *""I did it. I broke free.""*
* I envisioned myself **helping others quit**, becoming an inspiration rather than a warning.
* Best of all, **I had peace of mind**, knowing that I had made the best choice for myself and my loved ones.

Seeing the stark contrast between these two realities made quitting feel **even more urgent and necessary**—I wasn’t just avoiding suffering, I was stepping into a **better life**.

# 3. Social Pressure and Influence

* I recognized that **social environments** can make quitting harder. Friends who smoked, peer pressure, and routines that involved smoking kept me hooked.
* To counter this, I **avoided triggers**:
   * I stopped hanging out in smoking areas.
   * I distanced myself from social events where I knew smoking was encouraged.
   * I found **healthier social activities**, like exercising or meeting friends in smoke-free places.
* I sought **support** from non-smokers and people who encouraged my decision. Their motivation helped me resist temptation.
* I reminded myself that **quitting would improve my social life**, giving me more energy, better breath, and making me more approachable.

# 4. Relationships and Long-Term Impact

* I thought deeply about how smoking affected my **relationships**:
   * I didn’t want my future children to suffer because of my poor health choices.
   * I feared how my family, spouse, or loved ones might **resent** me for damaging my health.
   * I wanted to be **a strong and respectable figure**, someone others looked up to instead of pitied.
* Thinking of the long-term consequences made quitting feel **urgent and necessary**.

# 5. Physical Cleansing (VERY POWERFUL THING I DID) I cleaned and reset the Spiritual, Mental, Emotional, and Physical parts of my self

* To reset my body, I tried **water fasting using the Master Cleanse method**, which I learned from YouTube.
* I allowed myself to smoke during the first few days but stopped completely by day four.
* I actively **discouraged my addiction**. To break the illusion of cigarettes, I even **ate one**—an extreme but effective way to make the taste revolting.
* The fasting process helped detox my mind and body, making quitting feel like **a fresh start**.

# Pros and Cons of Quitting Smoking

#  Pros: The Benefits of Quitting

* **Better Health** – Lower risk of lung disease, heart disease, and cancer.
* **More Energy** – Improved stamina and breathing.
* **Clearer Skin** – No more dull complexion caused by smoking.

#  Cons: The Challenges of Quitting

* **Withdrawal Symptoms** – Cravings, irritability, difficulty concentrating.

* **Breaking Routine** – Many habits involve smoking (coffee breaks, stress relief).
* **Weight Gain Risk** – Some people overeat as a replacement for smoking.
* **Emotional Battles** – Overcoming self-doubt and negative thoughts.

# Final Thoughts

This approach helped me align my **mind, emotions, social environment, relationships, and body** toward quitting smoking for good. If you're struggling, I encourage you to find your own powerful motivation and commit to change. Freedom from addiction is possible, and life without smoking is **better than you can imagine**.

Don't get me wrong, I admire a lot about this country. The trains (when they work), the insurance obsession, the forest walks, and the weirdly good bakery culture.

But I’ve been here for a while now, and honestly…
It’s hard to make real connections.

Small talk? Doesn’t exist.
Inviting someone for coffee? Feels like proposing marriage.
Trying to make friends as an adult here is like trying to get through Bürgeramt without an appointment: impossible.

I know Germans value privacy and space, and I respect that. But coming from a more open culture, it can feel… cold.
Efficient, yes. But warm? Not really.

I’m saying this as someone who genuinely wants to integrate. Learn the language. Respect the culture. Be part of something.

But sometimes I wonder:
Are Germans really distant… or do foreigners just not understand how closeness works here?

Germans: Is this just our misunderstanding? Or is this cultural distance real?
Expats: Have you felt the same?

Nakatira sya before sa Baguion then La Union habang ako nasa Laguna pero ginagawan namin parehas ng paraan para makapag kita every 3-5 months throughout the course of our relationship. Now she is currently in another country naka student visa and working since September 2024, while I am currently in my internship and graduating this year. 

Context: after a month of her arriving in another country we broke up for a few days due to a lot of circumstances and inaadmit ko na I failed to show up for when she needed me nung wala pa sya work at bago pa lang sya don. Mostly bonding time namin is playing Valorant habang naka call or watching movies pero since she moved there bihira nalang kami nakakapaglaro and mostly needed to rely on videocalls and doon ako nagkulang that time. Most of the time nasa sala lang ako at don din ako natutulog at lagi palabas labas mama at ate ko and ako naman nahihiya ako pag naririnig nila usapan namin and I communicated that to her and okay lang naman daw sakanya. But we went on like this for many months until a month ago she went cold, nagcommunicate ako na I felt unheard or unseen kasi pag nagkkwento sya ng araw nya mataas energy nya pero pag ako nagkkwento ng akin wala syang interest. It went on like that for a few days until napuno ako and temporarily blocked her (I know that was wrong)

After unblocking her, I found out she blocked me too and in other social medias and I tried to reach out to her. When we talked again, she said that she has no feelings and broke up with me. I tried to fight for her for weeks but it doesn't go well.

Previous Attempts: After a few weeks of no contact, we catched up a bit and she still has no feelings yet but says she can only see me as her friend. I'm currently trying to win her back, I have tried doing some assignments for her and treating her coffee and meals. I don't know yet if she will eventually ease up on me but I'm trying everything that I can. Now, napapaisip ako tama ba tong ginagawa ko?

The table attaches mechanically to this piece from the side (not shown, laying down) using two bolts. In the top half, the bottom left hole has an insert that allows a bolt to thread in. This is not supposed to be there. I think during assembly someone threaded this in mistakenly thinking that this was the side that attaches to the table, saw the mistake, but moved on. The bottom half of the picture shows where a wood screw attaches this piece to the leg proper plus glue residue. You can see the pilot hole for the other side where the incorrect insert was put in. The result is that over time the leg has gotten loose and pulled away from this piece. The one wood screw has worked itself out, destroying the wood it drilled into.

My initial idea was to remove the insert (would need ideas). Put in a new wood screw. Drill out and fill in the destroyed side so I can put a wood screw back in (would need ideas/pointers for what to use and how to do this). Then put it all back together with wood glue (I have ratchet straps, and/or wouldn't mind getting a few clamps).

The Waste king⁢ line of ​garbage disposals ⁣boast several distinguishing factors that set them apart from ⁣the competition.​ These features are designed to provide reliable performance, durability, and user convenience.

**High-Speed motor:**
Waste King disposals are known ⁤for their powerful, high-speed motors. These motors,typically ranging ⁣from 1/3 HP to⁢ 1 HP,operate at speeds of 2600 RPM or higher.

Continuous feed operation enhances both speed and convenience, ​making it an ​ideal choice for busy households.**No-Splash⁣ Baffle:**
The no-splash baffle is a critical component of Waste King’s⁤ design. It's usually made of rubber and sits at the⁢ top of the disposal opening.This baffle prevents food and​ water from ‍splashing back ‌up during operation, keeping the surrounding sink area clean and dry. The baffle is typically removable for easy cleaning and maintenance.

**EZ Mount System:**
Waste King’s ⁢EZ Mount system is designed for easy installation and replacement. this system uses a simple twist-and-lock mechanism that allows homeowners to quickly attach and detach the disposal ​unit without requiring specialized tools or professional assistance.

## Core Benefits

The Waste King garbage disposal delivers several significant benefits⁢ to ⁤its users, improving both efficiency and convenience within the kitchen. These benefits justify the investment for many homeowners, enhancing their‍ overall quality of life.

**Improved Kitchen Hygiene:** The Waste King garbage disposal‍ plays a crucial role in maintaining a clean and hygienic kitchen.

**Reduced Landfill Waste:** By⁢ processing food scraps in the‌ garbage disposal, ‌users can divert a significant amount of organic waste from landfills. ⁤Landfills ⁢contribute to environmental pollution, and diverting food waste helps reduce methane ​emissions ​and conserve valuable landfill space.

1kyqjmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1kyqjmu/the_concept_of_slut_nowadays_is_more_focused_in/,The concept of slut nowadays is more focused in attention seeking behaviour other than actually having sex,"Just a thought. I love sex. I've not been celibate for longer than three weeks since 16 years old(I'm almost 22). I don't dress provocatively, or go out a lot, or post sexual content in social media, none is needed to get laid. I just shoot my shoot at anyone I find decently attractive and like its personality. And during hornier times have used dating apps.

It's not even necessary to be too straight forward, I usually let men take me out on a very decent date for dinner or coffee and just offer at the end that they sleep over at my house. 

I think because of this, because I like letting them sleep over and cuddle afterwards, make them coffee in the morning and ask about their life and how I generally present myself they tend to assume I never do this, and they are just the exception of that one incredible date that ended in sex. And then the next three weeks I invite them over every other day to just sleep over if I enjoyed it, they assume it comes from a place of me discovering my sex life for the first time.

They compliment that I don't hide my body, can maintain eye contact, can keep dirty talk, etc. I feel it comes from a place where they assume I'd be inexperienced and insecure.

Most of the break ups tend to happen when they assume they hold a bigger power over me than they actually do and think they can be disrespectful or unattentive or make me do something I don't want to do. I am a very loving person, doesn't necessarily mean I love you or even really care.

I have friends with half or less my body count that just give off a different vibe and are treated completly different because of it. It's extremely silly.

So, just know, if you are one of those men that believe in body counts or that a woman's worth is based on their sex life, next time you meet a very modestly dressed girl, who doesn't  post in social media at all, has a great family life and has very good grades in a very niche stem field degree, don't let your guard down. ;)",0,1748564368.0,self,3,0.29,False

I have always been a person who is able to FOCUS. I could study for 12 hours straight, at a coffee shop, doing repetitive tasks, and feel totally fine the next day. I was able to crush tasks and innovative thinking at work. As a kid, I was definitely very ""energetic"" (annoying to teachers) and did not enjoy school, but college was great and I have been successful at work.

After having my son (almost 2 years ago) my brain is all over the place. I force myself to accomplish tasks by making extremely specific lists (for example - ""write this line of code"" or ""schedule meeting with this individual before 8 am""). I am still getting good reviews at work but at home I'm a total mess. I have a hard time finding motivation or focusing, a hard time regulating, a hard time accomplishing basic household tasks.

In this time I kind of got emotionally too attached to him. We spend 4/7 days a week together. In my everyday life I just try to exist trough the time that I can’t see him. Life didn’t feel like life the last months. I told him that I desperately miss him everyday, he didn’t say that as often and definitely not as desperate. If we didn’t see each other on a day that we could’ve spent together, i was devastated and crying. Yesterday I told him about it and how unhealthy it is, he supported me in my decision to change my behavior and get used to spending time without him. So forward to today: Thursday we talked about how we spend our weekend. I‘ll drive to him on Friday, that’s what we agreed to. He has Home Office until 4pm. Keep that in mind. My friend (F23) asked me to meet up on Friday. I was happy, because she works full time in a different city and barely has time. So my quitting time as at 1pm. So I told her that we could meet at like 2pm and after drinking a coffee, I would drive to my bf.  I told him at ca. 11.30pm that I will meet her before I come to him. He crashed out completely. He said he mentally prepared for me to be at his place at 2pm and that 2 days ago I would’ve done anything to spend every second with him. I told him that ofc I want to spend every minute with him, but I think I might break the unhealthy patterns by meeting friends. And while agreeing to her, I kept in mind that he has HO until 4pm. We didn’t see each other for 4 days and he was the one who said „4 days aren’t the world“ but makes a scene about 2 hours that he has HO anyways?? We didn’t choose a time to meet up, so?! He got completely irrational and respectless. I told him that I don’t tolerate this behavior. He answered with „sometimes it‘s not possible to be respectful“. We discussed this until 2am then he said things like he has to get up early and how I would keep him awake. Dude.. I have to get up at the same time.

1kyqhuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kyqhuv/37_and_burnt_out/,37 and burnt out.,"I have no one else to talk to so, internet, here I am. 

At 19 I had my first child, the dad ended up in jail due to selling marijuana out of my home while I was at work. He went to jail for 8 months, during that time I went to hang out with an old friend and she mentioned her older brother was there. I never even knew she had a older brother he was in and out of the foster system so never around. So I'm 21 now and pregnant from that one night stand, I was scared, thought about abortion and couldn't do it. About 2 months into my pregnancy he calls me and says he wants to be a part of my life and the baby, we got together. 11 months later I gave birth to my 3rd child. The year after at 23 we got married. It was never great, he drank and we fought horribly, I was always with the kids, I tried to work a few times but he would say things like I can make more money faster, or the car I drove would break down or better yet he would get into a hit and run with it. At this time in my life my grandparents who raised me were both dead. My grandma when my first was 2 weeks old and my grandpa when my 3rd was 3 months old. I was never close with my mom but we had a relationship of sorts. She was all I had now also and alcoholic and drug addict. It was really hard raising them poor, with no support all while trying to do my best. (There's a ton more life to fit in here) skip to 12 years later. We were fighting, fighting, I dreaded when he would come home. Sex was non existent. Just zero relationship left. In 2018 while still with him I got a scholarship through Google and got a nano degree in Web Development. To me, it was my ticket to get me and my children out of there and never have to look back. Covid hit. It put a huge damper on my plan. And then... we are driving one night and get into a wreck and the police come. They ask where my husband is and I pointed over to where the tow truck was. They arrested him on sexual exploitation of a minor. I was floored. He got bonded out by a guy he was working for (construction) and I had a million questions. Like wtf. It was all over the news. I was devastated. He blamed it all on his friend / work partner and knowing the friend I did believe some of it. I always had suspicion he was lying but I could never prove anything. I started talking to my best friend who knew everything from my marriage and we decided I would leave him and go to her house to stay June 1st 2020. It was her wedding, he wouldn't think anything of it and I just never go back. April 20th this guy I always crushed when I was younger messaged me out of nowhere. I'd known him about 20 something years at this point but hadn't talked to him in about 18 years lol. I didn't explain everything but I told him a lot. How my marriage was over and how what he seen on social media of my life wasn't real life. After talking to my then husband, the new guy came down to help me pack and leave. He knew everything and wanted us out of there. My mother and her boyfriend also came to help me move (from SC to Michigan) it was not an easy task. While packing my ex took my car and like I said had a ""hit and run"" and wrecked my car... the new guy had to literally buy us a $800 mini van from a guy who promised it would make it to michigan. That took like 2 weeks to get, 2 weeks of me, the new guy, my kids, my mom and her boyfriend. My ex was down the hill messing with the lady down there. I didn't care. We had been over. I couldn't shake his charges it was my final straw. Fast forward to the day we leave... as soon as we hit the border to our new state, my daughter 11 at the time starts telling us that her dad was having her and her sisters smoke weed and was touching them. I had suspicion ever since the day he got those charges and arrested we would even fight and I'd say are you touching my kids?! The fights were horrid. And there it was smacked in my face. We had to do forensic interviews and 2 out of 3 said they were molested. As a mother I'm still sick to my stomach over it. He was arrested 2 years ago and still sitting in jail. During his time in jail it was brought to my attention that he also touched neighbor children and he has all types of charges. I also told how he told me he murdered a woman once. It was about a week before I was moving so I didn't know if it was to scare me or true. I've always said there was 2 times during our relationship I think that he drugged me.. so I'm talking to my mom one day and she tells me she thinks he drugged her and raped her one night. She was so detailed I believed her. Skip to today. Today my children are 15, 16 and 18. My ex has been in jail for 2 years now. My 16 year old is a mother to a baby girl, my 18yr old won't talk about it, doesn't want to go to trial, my youngest doesn't remember much and says she was never touched.. my oldest has had an abortion, my middle has tried to commit suicide a lot of times. We all have so many issues and to top the cake my mom died the day before the baby was born. Literally the only person I had left died the day before my young daughter gave birth. I'm still devastated. This was only 10 months ago. 
We have trial coming up in Septmeber and I'm dreading it. I have so many thoughts and fears and just a sickening pit in my stomach. I can't think, my mind is constantly running I'm in constant fight or flight mode, the new guy and I have been together 4 years now and this relationship is barely hanging on yet we are engaged, I have no income, I don't go anywhere and if I do I do not go alone. I have my mom's car broken down and live in public housing. I miss appointments because of anxiety, my middle daughter has had cops and cps here a million times. She takes great care of her baby but it's the drama with kids at school. They all know she was molested and they all say horrid things like she's a slut of the town. The new guy I'm with is probably the dad, they hope the baby dies. I pulled her out of school last week. There's only a week left. My new relationship is nothing like I'd imagined it for years in my head. He is also an alcoholic and struggles. I do not drink or do drugs. We all have his income. He's tried to kick us out before literally 3am calling shelters that are all full. My middle child is acting out again since I told her trial is starting. All I ever wanted to be was a mom. A good mom I never had I wanted to be that angel grandma everyone wanted to be around. I wanted to be a psychologist. I went to college for it until I couldn't. I have student debt out of this world, children that hate me, the love of my life who regrets ever meeting me, and I keep going. Every single day I take all the hate the silence and I cook and clean and smile and help and try to be patient and read my Bible and try to keep the peace, he hates my kid. My middle one. This is so hard. Life is ok some days we have made a lot of good memories but nothing is what it could be. I'm here and I'm so alone.  This is never what I had planned for my life. I always did so good in school I was such a good kid at 14 I was working... why so much shit. When will I be ok. I can't pull myself out of this one. I've isolated so much family doesn't even know my kids. They also don't know them. It all sucks it's all shit and it all never had to be. Idk why I'm here writing this, what I'm looking for, idk much of anything anymore. I can't even boil water right, I went from Susie homemaker to EBT section 8 one wrong step away from homeless with nothing, me. I'm also 5ft and 220lbs ugly mess who has been wearing the same  handful of clothes since I left..so it's not like I have natural beauty going for me, or anything really. I need a break so bad. I need my head to stop burning with thoughts ( literally I feel my head turn hot) idk how much more I can take. I'll stop writing and get the kids and snack and say I love you with no I love you back, I'll clean up dinner and head to bed to lay with someone who's been mostly silent towards me all day. Some days I think he never even glances my way. I'll wake up again and start the coffee and smile and run the dishwasher and chase the little one and clean and cook and clean and cook and help and help and help... on repeat.

1kyqeyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/1kyqeyw/its_been_a_72_hour/,It's been a 72 hour.,"Hey Yall, i posted a few weeks ago when mom had her first hospital trip. It was a mini strokes and she ended up needing to go to rehab for 2 weeks. Ngl and be selfish it was great to finally have ""time off"". It was also nice that since rehab was in the city my little brother lives (45 mins away from me) he visited her every other day to allowed me to have days off. 

Well this is my life and that sweet peace of course couldn't stay. Mom got her discharge for Wednesday. Meaning on Tuesday because my mom was ""locked away"" I had to step into one of her roles and I am not sure how I'm going to make it when mom goes. 

I'm sitting at work about to get going on my end of month paperwork and my phone is a glow. My eldest brother is calling. I already know this is red alert. He only calls when its red alert. 
""Hey what's up""
"" 'wife' got fired"" 
FUDGE. his Wife the only one who works was just fired. They have a house and animals and now no income. Obviously this is a reason for crisis.

 Now some important information for anyone reading questions why this is my problem. My eldest brother is late diagnosed autistic who instead of having the wonders of today's knowledge of how to help those with autism he was raised to mask and turned to alcohol for the burn out. When his panic attacks started he would was prescribed tranq  and he never learned how to work through emotions. Well pat on the back because the man got diagnosed and is now trying to ""grow up"". 

See my eldest brother when he is experiencing big feelings like his dog being sick he has been asking mom to come sit with him (body double). Math time eldest in crisis + mom locked away = now hes my responsibility. So leaving work I go to drive to him and hour away. I took his Wife and dog for a walk. The dog is 65lbs+ the temp is about 80. I'm in dress shoes, pants polo and sweater. I took the dog so the wife could have her emotions while not losing the dog. I spend maybe an hour or so with them and explain that I'm sorry but I do have a meeting and had to go. Went to my work meeting and came out to texts from him asking if I could please come back that night. I explained to him that it was my self care night (rupaul smoking dinner with my husband and bestie) texted through the night

Wednesday its 9am and he is already asking me to come down and be with him. I explain that I do have to work a bit and I am picking mom up from rehab in the afternoon. Maybe an hour or so later my eldest brother calls asking if I would mind when I pick mom up if I could bring her to his house and spend time. I told him I had my husband to cook dinner for but I'd drop off mom. Did what I needed and picked up mom. Got her home and to bed. Im on the couch enjoying the 15 I am rewarded when I hear the crash. Mom fell again. This time of her stupidity and not health. She dropped her phone out of bed and leaned too far over the edge. 

This morning we had a PET scan and plumber bother at 8am. Husband worked the night before but will stay up and handle plumber its just a quote (I say sarcastically) I take mom to get her scan. Nurse says she'll be done in an hour and a half. Hour twenty later the nurse without mom return and the plumber showed up 45 mins late. Hey can come with us. We had a issue with a machine and we need to redo it will be 15 but she's been mad since she got here (coffee addict without coffee) and wants another appointment but blah blah blah. So now I get to fight with my mother, yippy. Oh and my husband is now call must habe the quote. Nope hes is pissed because they need a 2nd to come out. SMH. 

Convinced mom to just do it again instead of having us do another 3 hour trip. My reward? My mother telling me that she seriously dislikes me right now. Thanks for the knife. Called husband back and listen to his frustration. While rolling my eyes when he says he feels his only use in life is to be used by others. Not me whole other story hes not abusive. 

Finally things settle, get home, head to work. Scrap my husband car while pulling a u turn at my first stop. Had to listen to him lecture about how the only body damage on his car is caused by me :) I take full responsibility and have already given him consent to murder me. He told me he'd wait till after the car was fixed, hes annoyed but still loves me.

1kyqdrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1kyqdrt/lemon_balm_extract_in_a_moka_pot_how_is_this/,Lemon balm extract in a moka pot; how is this stuff legal?,"A couple of months ago I found a really sweet vintage Bialetti moka pot at my local Goodwill. Long before this, I had read an article about how lemon balm was incredibly effective for sleep. Even more effective than prescription medications. This was in a peer-reviewed journal. Long before I got the moka pot I've always had issues with sleep caffeinated or uncaffeinated. So I ordered some lemon balm extract off of Amazon. I got a big old pouch of it. I heaped a bunch of the powder into the filter funnel and packed it in. Word of precaution, don't pack it too tight otherwise nothing will come out. I took about two or three shots and walked out to my vegetable garden to do some some weeding. Within about 30 minutes, it was coming on so strong that it felt like a wave of ketamine about to hit you. The active component is rosemarinic acid which blocks the degradation of gaba. Gaba is the same receptors that Valium and or Xanax target. The difference is rosemarynic acid simply gets you high on your own supply. I had waves of euphoria moderate euphoria coming over me. On top of that I noticed that all of my internal organs were completely numb. My pain tolerance definitely was higher because I tore the back of my hand against a rose Thorn and had no idea until I saw blood dripping down. I decided to do a cheek bite test to see how much pressure I could put on my cheek before the pain became too much. I had to stop because I was worried I was going to draw blood! I've worked in quite a few pharmacies and I've never seen or experienced an herbal compound that was this strong. 

If any of you out there have really bad arthritis and or other painful diseases like endometriosis, which by the way a friend of mine tested lemon balm out and they said it was the first time that they were ever not in pain, this stuff will work amazing for you. Please do not get behind the wheel on this stuff.

Side notes:

1. I realize it's already lemon balm extract but what the mocha pot does is it separates all the waxes and resins out from the extract so what winds up in the collection chamber is an aqueous extract of rosemerinic acid. The downside to this is you need to clean out your moka pot with either grain alcohol or lab-grade acetone. Be sure to remove all the rubber parts when cleaning.

2. There's no way to describe this except for it honestly tastes like what I would imagine old moldy herbal gym socks would taste like. Although, just like a new flavor of cafe You may not like it at first but it grows on you. The lemon balm does the same thing. You're never going to like it but you appreciate some of the notes it actually has in it.

3. Do not get behind the wheel or operate any heavy machinery with this stuff! It can be very mild in low doses or incredibly anesthetically sedating at high doses.

4. If you are already on a gabaminergic drug, you need to talk to your doctor before trying this stuff. Let him know that it's rosemarinic acid. More than likely they'll probably tell you to not try this stuff which they would probably be 100% correct. 

5. If you are on heavy blood pressure medications, don't try this either.

6. It's relatively mild and safe in low doses such as 1 to two shots. I wouldn't go beyond 5 to 6 shots of this stuff. In fact, lower doses such as 1 to two shots are usually more enjoyable. It's kind of like hanging out in a hammock with a nice glass of red wine watching the sunset. Versus your body has stopped communicating with your exterior consciousness that exist in quantum space because your brain is partially shut down. You'll have some pretty wild out of body experiences. I also find one to two shots is really nice right before I start meditating. Something I'd like to hear other people's experiences with.

7. I'd say this stuff is pretty on par with coffee. 1 to 2 shots is perfect. Once you go over 5, you start getting into tweak from South Park territory, increased heart rate, thoughts racing a mile a minute etc. The only difference between this is that it does the opposite of what caffeine does.

8. If you're looking where to source this I recommend Amazon and just look for the company that sells the 500 g bag of lemon balm extract.",1,1748563906.0,mokapot,8,0.57,False

1kyqc7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1kyqc7u/still_confused_after_mothers_day/,Still confused after Mother’s Day,"I had a bizarre Mother’s Day and I don’t know what to make of it, or how to feel about it. 

We have been married for 20 years this year and I don’t expect much on Mother’s Day. My husband got gifts for his mom and my mother and cards for all which was really nice that I did not have to do it this year. He asked if I wanted a hanging flower basket, but I have zero green thumb and told him no, it would die because I would forget to water it and he travels for work. 

On Mother’s Day I came downstairs and I had wilting red roses and a bag. He did let me sleep in and cleaned up the kitchen which was a nice treat. He apologized about the flowers and said he didn’t know why they look like that today (I’m assuming he left them in his car overnight) in the bag he had 2 bags of gummy bears and 2 Dr.Peppers. Both my favorite, but a little underwhelming. The card said “let’s find you a nice table saw”. I have been wanting a table saw and he said it would be better to wait until Father’s Day because that’s when tools go on sale. I know he doesn’t want a table saw and wouldn’t use it, so that is not his motive. I just felt underwhelmed. 

The confusing thing that happened is he was going to make me coffee and I suggested he make me an espresso, he has never cared to learn how to use the machine so I end up making his drink. I start to show him but notice my espresso coffee is all gone and he said he used it for his daily coffee. I joked and said how dare you use my expensive espresso for your drip, but he took it personally. Like…really personally. He starting pouting and getting defensive and angry with me and no other way to describe it, but was throwing a tantrum. I was frustrated so I told him to leave the kitchen because he was acting like a butthead and I’ll just make my own coffee. I know I shouldn’t have called him a butthead, but he was having a big reaction to something that was so small and he is not normally like that. 

He continues to give me the silent treatment for the next hour so I was done with it and decided to just go to my room so we both can cool off. He follows me up there and said what I said about the coffee really hurt his feelings and that me calling him a butthead was cruel when he knows what I really meant. (Never got ask what he thinks I really meant) he starts to sob (also not like him) I told him I was sorry and I was only joking about the coffee but I was sorry that it hurt him and console him while giant tears are running down my head. At this point I am so confused because my husband doesn’t get offended easily and can take jokes and we get in tiffs and cool off and all is good, but never sobbing. It was just odd and confusing and uncomfortable for me. 

We went to his mothers, and had brunch and then my mothers and I gardened with her. I asked about dinner and suggested we go out to eat, he hadn’t even thought about dinner and ended up going to the grocery store and getting us steak for dinner. I just felt like an afterthought all day.  I just know that he will never get me a table saw, I will need to look for it and get it. So that means my gift was wilted flowers, gummy bears and soda and confusing mixed emotions. 

I’m trying to plan for Father’s Day and I have zero idea what I should do. Should I forget about the mixed up Mother’s Day and just celebrate him like normal? I feel like I should because he is traveling for work and going to school to get his masters, so I imagine he is just stressed out and doesn’t know how to handle those feelings and it came out as tears on Mother’s Day. Or do I give the same energy? I feel that leans on being petty and spiteful. 

I need your input on what I should do.

In a world where coffee can be paid for with crypto and grandmas are HODLing, Bitcoin ATMs are popping up faster than mushrooms after rain. These futuristic kiosks are the new-age cash machines—except instead of boring old fiat, you’re dealing with sweet, decentralized Bitcoin. But here’s the twist: it’s not just about the machines anymore. It’s about how *you* interact with them, and that’s where our handy little tool comes in—[Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).

Let’s start with the basics. Bitcoin ATMs (also called BTMs) look a lot like traditional ATMs, but instead of pulling out $20 bills, you’re buying or selling Bitcoin. Most machines let you insert cash to buy BTC, or scan a QR code to send Bitcoin and receive cash. They’re often found in convenience stores, gas stations, and even some hipster cafes (because, of course). Whether you're a first-timer or a seasoned Bitcoiner, BTMs offer a fast, simple way to jump into the crypto stream without needing a bank.

Here’s where things get *really* cool.

When you use a Bitcoin ATM, you need a Bitcoin address—basically, your wallet’s public key where the crypto will be sent. Typing that long string of letters and numbers? No thanks. That’s where our app comes in like a Satoshi-powered superhero.

At [Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), we turn your Bitcoin address into a sleek, scannable QR code in seconds. No typos, no hassle—just pure, click-and-scan magic. Whether you're buying Bitcoin at a machine or showing someone your address to receive payment, having a QR code is the fast-pass to crypto convenience.

Imagine this: You walk into a shop, spot a Bitcoin ATM in the corner, and decide it’s time to stack some sats. You pull up your wallet, generate a fresh receiving address, hop onto our app, paste it in, and BOOM—instantly you’ve got a QR code ready to scan at the machine. Insert cash, scan your code, and ka-ching! You’re now the proud owner of some brand-new BTC.

Better yet, if you’re running a business, you can even create QR codes with *fixed amounts*—perfect for Bitcoin tips, donations, or payments. Add the QR to your website, display it at your checkout counter, or tattoo it on your bicep (not recommended, but hey, you do you).

So whether you're exploring Bitcoin ATMs for the first time or you’re a crypto cowboy blazing a trail through the wild west of Web3, our QR Code Maker is the sidekick you didn’t know you needed.

The future is here. It’s fast, fun, and full of QR codes. Try it out today at [Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)—because in the world of Bitcoin, who has time to type?",1,1748563694.0,BitcoinQR,0,1.0,False

I could still go home and get changed. I’d be living a lie, but I’d be respectable. I’d be dead inside, but I’d still be a promising young man on the outside. The value of a decision is what it costs you to make it, that’s why the important ones are never easy.

I might be late for work, but it’s not too late for me, yet.

But once you’ve been let out of the cage you’ve been in your whole life… even for just one day, you have created a serious problem: how will you live the rest of your life back in the cage, knowing you could’ve been free?

With that thought, I pushed away. My heart was pounding so hard I couldn’t hear anything else. Before I had a chance to second guess myself again, I stepped out of the car and closed the door behind me. I looked around and saw no one was in the parking lot. I took a deep breath, stepped forward and nearly face-planted. I’d forgotten I was wearing heels. I straightened myself up, then marched toward the office door.

1kyqanp,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1kyqanp/its_done_canada_experience_detailed/,It's done! Canada experience (detailed),"I'm home from my bisalp! So far, so good. Reading these posts really helped me know what to expect prior to surgery, so hopefully someone else can benefit from my experience!

Referral/Consult (Extremely positive!)

I was referred to a local hospital in July 2024 by my family doctor. I went in to get my IUD removed (was giving me side effects-- cramping, nonstop bleeding, etc) and requested a bisalp referral. She referred me to a gyno right away, no questions asked. My surgical consult was in August 2024 and went super smoothly. Again, I stated that I wanted a bisalp and, after confirming that I knew what to expect, I was added to the schedule. For reference, I am late 20s and married (but my age/marital status weren't raised as issues/barriers to access).

Surgery scheduling 

I was officially scheduled in February 2025 for my May 2025 surgery. Two days prior I received my arrival and surgery time (9:30 and 11:30 respectively). The hospital is about an hour away from my home. 

Prep (very minimal)

I purchased Tylenol, stool softener (Colace), and gas x. I set up our guest room with the meds and lots of pillows (6 I think). I put stretchy clothes, PJs, and other small essentials on a small table next to the bed. I wore gaucho pants, comfy bra, t shirt, warm jacket, and slip on sneakers to the hospital. I brought my book, phone, and headphones to keep my company.
Snacks-- got Gatorade, ginger ale, applesauce packets, and fibre one bars. I ate a fibre one bar and drank a Gatorade the night before. I generally tried to stay very active and eat fibre in the weeks prior. I always walk a ton and took a several kilometre bike ride 2 days before surgery. I drank a lot of water in the days prior.

The big day! pre-op

My husband dropped my off at the hospital (no one other than patients allowed in surgical unit). Said our goodbyes, then headed inside and confirmed my info at the arrivals desk. I headed to the surgical unit where they immediately checked me in and took a urine sample (pregnancy test) and then I was brought to a bed. Stripped down and put on a gown and a blanket. They took basic vitals (BP, temp, heart rate, oxygen, height, weight) and gave me ~1000mg of Tylenol pills. They inserted the IV in the crook of my arm and started me on saline. To the very best of my knowledge, I was not given any sedatives/opiates prior to surgery. I had visits from the surgical ward nurse, anesthesiologist, head OR nurse, gynecologist, two assisting doctors, and two assisting OR nurses. Everyone was so nice and helpful!

I was especially afraid of the anesthesia because I had a terrible experience during my one prior surgery (lap chole). I told the anesthesiologist and he definitely calmed me down and said that he would give some motion sickness meds in the anesthesia (no patch). 

In the OR

I was brought back around 11:15. They gave me a little hat and booties. They had me pee first to try and avoid the catheter (but I think they had to insert one anyway). I certainly flashed the entire surgical ward when going from the bed to the bathroom but oh well!!! They brought me into the OR and I chatted with everyone again, confirmed my info and surgery, and then it was lights out. I was nervous when they put the oxygen mask on me and heard the heart rate monitor beeping, but I was out of it about 30 secs later. The IV anesthesia burned slightly but wasnt unpleasant.

Recovery 

I woke up in the OR and could speak to the doctor right away. I glanced at the clock and it was around 1:30. My right shoulder was in unbearable pain from the get-go. I wasn't super groggy at all. We spoke briefly and then I was wheeled to the ""laying down"" recovery area for about 15 mins. They called my husband and told him that I would be ready around 2:20.
I was crying a bit (from anesthesia) and my throat was very sore. The recovery nurse was super nice. She gave me fentanyl for my shoulder pain and that did the trick. I had to ask her multiple times for the exact name of the ""pain killer"" she was giving me. I had some moderate bleeding; there was a pad on me from post-op and they gave me another one to put on when I got dressed.
At about 2:10 I was getting dressed and headed over to the ""sitting down"" recovery area. Putting my pants on was a little difficult but I persevered (didn't want to flash people twice in one day).
There was some confusion over my insurance for the anesthesiologist (that they were trying to explain to me as I was getting dressed) but they figured it out. I do not expect to receive a bill for any part of my surgery.
They offered me ginger ale, apple juice, cranberry juice, cookies, or crackers. I had apple juice and crackers and it was delightful. My surgeon came to see me and told me that I had some endometriosis cauterized in a few spots (not entirely unexpected). She gave me lots of pictures and told me that I have ""beautiful"" ovaries. 
I felt great while in the chair area! I got lots of messages and could respond well. I never really felt out of it once I woke up.

Going home!

They wheeled me outside to my husband around 2:45. If I didn't have to wait for the insurance confusion to clear up it probably would've been sooner. I felt great (maybe the fentanyl). We went straight to get coffee and I had a nice oat iced coffee and a small amount of pastry (like 3 bites). Ride home was pleasant. My husband said that I was very pale in the car but I felt okay. Went straight to my guest room and put on PJs, peed several times, and called my parents. I ate a little bit of ramen and drinking water and Gatorade. I still have some bleeding and shoulder pain, and the sutures have just started to hurt a bit (around 6:45pm). I took a Colace and advil and set my alarm for late night/early morning pain pills (Tylenol and advil). I'm walking around inside as often as I can. My cat is very happy that I'm just hanging around and is being very good and sleeping on my legs.

Going forward

My surgeon said to walk as much as I was able and can return to usual activity (cycling, running, etc) when I felt comfortable/see how I feel in a week or so. Everything else (lifting more than a couple kilos, sex, vigourous activity) should wait 2+ weeks. 4-6 weeks for heavy lifting. 

That's it for now! It was a long but positive experience from referral to post-op. Hoping for a smooth and pleasant recovery. So glad to have this over with!",5,1748563667.0,sterilization,0,1.0,False

1kyq7hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpiritsParanormal/comments/1kyq7hh/is_it_possible_to_befriend_a_ghost/,Is It Possible to Befriend a Ghost? 🤝👻💬," 



Hello 👋 Ever wondered if those creaks in the hallway or chills down your spine were more than just random? Maybe… just maybe… there's someone on the other side trying to say hi. 👀👻 The idea of befriending a ghost might sound like something out of a movie, but many people who've had encounters will tell you — some spirits aren’t out to scare you. They’re just there.

**✨ Get Your Psychic Reading NOW, Available 24/7! 🔮 Check out the top post in this subreddit for instant insights and guidance. Your future is waiting! 🌟**

Now, before you start leaving snacks out for your new invisible friend, let’s talk. Ghosts, spirits, energies — whatever you want to call them — are believed to be souls that haven’t fully moved on. Not all are angry, sad, or stuck. Some just hang around places they loved, or people they still care about. They can be protective, curious, or even playful. So yes, it might be possible to form a connection — not like texting or coffee dates, but still something real and felt. ☕🕯️

People who’ve experienced repeated signs — flickering lights, objects moving, dreams with specific people, or just a strong feeling of “someone’s here” — might already be halfway into that ghostly friendship without realizing it. Some even feel comforted by the presence, as if they’re not alone anymore. It can be spooky at first, but over time, it’s like living with an invisible roommate who’s mostly chill. 😅👻

But how do you know if it’s a ghost and not just your imagination? That’s where intuition, energy, and sometimes even psychic guidance comes in. A real psychic can help you feel out whether there’s a spiritual presence in your life, what their intention is, and if there’s a message they’re trying to deliver. Ghosts don’t always speak in words — they show up in synchronicities, in sudden emotions, in patterns. And when you start recognizing those patterns, the connection gets stronger. ✨🔮📩

Still, befriending a ghost isn’t about control. It’s about respect. Just like with people, spirits have boundaries. Some might just want to check in and leave. Others might hang around a bit longer. If you want to build a peaceful relationship, keep your space calm, light a candle, speak with honesty. Say hi. Say thank you. Let them know they’re seen. That can mean the world to a wandering soul. 🕯️🫶💫

Also, protect your space. Use crystals, cleansing rituals, or prayers — not out of fear, but out of love and safety. A good friendship, even with the unseen, comes with care. You’re sharing space with energy, so make sure that energy feels good to you. If anything ever feels too heavy or intense, it’s totally okay to ask it to leave. Your peace comes first. 💎🛑🌿

People often find that once they stop fearing the unknown and start listening with curiosity, everything shifts. Ghosts don’t always want to scare — sometimes, they just want to be remembered. To be heard. And if you're the one who hears them, maybe that’s a gift. Maybe you’re meant to bridge two worlds. 🕊️🌌🤲

Psychics often say spirits come to those who are open. Not in a dangerous way — but because your energy is soft enough to feel, and strong enough to hold space for them. That’s kind of a superpower. It means you’re sensitive, empathetic, aware. If you think there’s something or someone around you… you’re probably right. Trust that instinct. 🌠🧘‍♀️💖

So yes, it is possible to befriend a ghost. Not in a Hollywood way, but in a real, soul-level way. It takes patience, care, boundaries, and a lot of inner listening. If you’re experiencing signs, if you’re curious, or even if you just want to feel less alone — maybe there’s more around you than you think. The universe is way bigger and weirder than most of us ever realize.

And remember — if you want help figuring this out, or even just want to confirm if someone is really with you from beyond, psychic readings are available 24/7. You don’t have to figure this out alone. 🧿🔍💬",1,1748563414.0,SpiritsParanormal,0,1.0,False

Diary chronicles 2,"Sooo I (24F) posted yesterday about my relationship because I was spiraling and I needed to think out loud. It’s hard and isolating because I can’t go to my friends or family without feeling judged or humiliated tbh… 
Anyways- this man (28M) got back over the weekend and Tuesday night he decided to go out for drinks with my uncle in law. Cool fine. Wednesday we had our regularly scheduled couples therapy which he tells me he won’t attend because he’s too tired from traveling. Ok fine. But we ended up fighting yesterday morning to the point that I was having anxiety in my office and I left early. I got in my pajamas and sobbed to my therapist later that day. She helped me understand that I was feeling jealous of the social drinking because he showed up for others when I was getting bare minimum interactions when he got back. Today I tried reaching out by asking to do a date night to reconnect maybe dress up go to our favorite restaurant for drinks and just have fun. And planning a small fishing date. I was getting minimal responses like “sure” “okay” “whatever you want”. Texts me after work that he’s out and our usual tradition is talking on the phone after work because he’s normally working at home after hours too. So I try calling and same thing, no responses. So I try small talk like how’s work, what did you have for lunch, etc. I’m getting “fine”, “it was ok” “yea someone bought me coffee”. He holds back who he interacts again. Sorry I’m spiraling but he has a history of holding back even genders and will later say it’s bc I overreact or when I’m upset he’ll say see this why I don’t tell you”.  Am I wrong for believing the more you hold back the less I trust the more upsetting it is rather than being upfront and allowing me to express some discomfort some insecurities and just being comforting and understanding and reassuring? To go back to the call after work he tells me he’s gonna end the call because he’s going to his moms. I KNOW FOR A FACT if I come to him about it and say it’s upsetting he’ll only focus on the idea that I’m upset he’s with family but it’s the fact that again you show up for others more than your partner. Being physically together isn’t the same as being emotionally spiritually present with who you claim the love of your life right?

I have a nice thick mostly blue grass (I think) lawn that was put in just before I purchased the house 3 years ago. I maintain the lawn very well. I cut it, pretty short, at a minimum of once a week. Sometimes more often if it's rained and grown a lot. I have a rabbit problem. They burrow in my yard all over the place. I know it's rabbits, I see them. They dig a burrow, remove a 10 inch circle of grass around the burrows and then cover it to have babies in the burrows. It gets worse every year. I must have 20 patches across my yard, front and back this year. My backyard is fenced in but they go under. I could burry a fence for my back yard, but I can't do this for my front yard. Last year I bought traps and would catch them and take them miles out into the country and release them. I probably caught 10 or more but there must be hundreds around the neighborhood, and it ultimately made no difference. They seem to really like my grass as my neighbors dont have as big of a problem, but their yards are half clover and weeds. Ive seen deterrent online, but they're more for localized areas, like garden beds, not an entire plot and isn't feasible or cost effective to treat my entire yard over and over. Apparently it's not common for them to just burrow in grass like this because most stuff i see only talks about gardens, but they're all over my yard, front and back, middle and edges.

Once this manuscript series is finished it will be showing the unbroken chain from Sumerian priest-kings to Silicon Valley algorithms - 5,000 years of the same project, continuously refined but never fundamentally changed. Every institution we trust, every idea we hold sacred, every technology we celebrate represents another advancement in humanity's systematic mental enslavement disguised as progress.

The series will provide the complete historical genealogy of consciousness control from its origins to its digital completion. Exposing the devastating truth: **Every development we celebrate as human progress - from literacy to democracy to digital technology - represents the continuous refinement of control systems that were embedded in the very structure of symbolic communication from the beginning.**

1kyq026,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kyq026/aita_for_watching_a_girl_park_because_i_was/,AITA for watching a girl park because I was impressed and getting called a sexist creep for it?,"I (48M) was walking back to my car after grabbing lunch downtown when I saw a girl probably early 20s trying to parallel park an older SUV into an extremely tight spot. It was one of those gaps where even newer cars with parking sensors would struggle. I could tell right away her SUV was an older model, no cameras or sensors at least not from the factory, so I figured it’d take some real skill to get in cleanly.

I stopped on the sidewalk and watched. I wasn’t staring like a weirdo, just standing with my coffee, kind of interested. I actually thought she must be a really good driver to even try that spot with that car. I even told myself maybe I’d pick up a technique or two. Also, as she was parking, we made eye contact and I smiled, kind of like an encouraging “you got this” thing. I also figured if she ended up tapping the car in front or behind and drove off, I could leave a note or something. I wasn’t looking to get involved, but I’ve seen people drive off after a hit before.

She ended up pulling it off fast and clean, two moves, right in, no issue. As she got out, she looked right at me and said, “Are you serious?”

I said, “Sorry?”

She goes, “You’ve just been standing there watching me this whole time like I’m some kind of show. What, you think I can’t park because I’m a girl?”

I said, “No, not at all. It was just a tight spot and an older car, and you handled it really well. I was just—”

She cut me off. “Save it. You’re literally just standing around watching a young woman try to park like it’s entertainment. It’s creepy and pathetic. Don’t pretend it’s about the car.”

I said, “Look, it had nothing to do with you being a woman. I just figured you must’ve known what you were doing to even attempt that spot, and I was curious. That’s all.”

She scoffed and said, “Yeah, sure. You’re not the first guy to pull the ‘I was just being impressed’ line. It’s sexist and weird. Try minding your own business next time.”

She walked off before I could say anything else. I’ll admit I was kind of stunned. I didn’t say anything rude, I wasn’t leering or making comments, just quietly watching in public for maybe 30 seconds.

Later, I told my sister about it, and she didn’t even hesitate. She just said, “Yeah, that’s exactly the kind of thing that makes women feel uncomfortable. Don’t be surprised she called you out.”

I honestly don’t see how it was sexist. I didn’t assume she couldn’t park. If anything, I assumed she could, which is why I watched. It had nothing to do with gender. It was a tough park, an old SUV, and I was just observing. It’s a public sidewalk. I didn’t touch her car, didn’t speak to her, didn’t do anything but stand there.

It was a  beautiful day in downtown LA. The sun was sparkling like a diamond ring on a brides finger. Tom Hart private investigator got a good spot right on his block. Had the makings of a great day. 

That’s when a kid maybe eighteen walked up and asked for a light.
Tom took out a match with his left hand striking it with his thumb in one swept motion.
The kid nervously took the light of his cigarette before whipping out a switchblade.
“Give me your wallet old timer and I won’t hurt you.”

Before the kid knew what happened Tom had cracked him on the nose with his .38 revolver. He was sitting on the sidewalk looking up.
Tom put his heel on the kids chest and pressed hard. 
You’re lucky I’m in a good mood punk. Get lost and if I see you around here again it’ll be a bullet up your nose next time. Now get outta here.

Tom noticed a cherry red Alpha Romeo convertible in front of his office. How could he not.
 He walked up the two flights of stairs.

Beth was already behind her desk typing. When Tom walked in. Beth motioned with her eyes to the leather couch opposite her in the waiting area. 
“Hello Tom.” 
“Oh Christene. I should have known when I saw the cherry red spider downstairs.”
“Step inside.” Ushering her into his office.

Tom sat behind his desk and Beth brought him a cup of strong black coffee.
“So how’s Andy?”
“That’s why I’m here. He’s missing. Three days I haven’t heard from him.”

Christene is the cousin of Tom’s ex wife Ann. Her and Andy had a volatile marriage with affairs on both sides but it wasn’t normal for Andy to disappear like this.
“How have you two been getting along lately.”
“Same old. We live our own lives and see people on the side. But we always come home. That’s never been a secret.”
“Is Andy still into the bookies.”
“Yes unfortunately. Victor Malone. Andy owed him five grand. He’s having trouble coming up with it. That’s why I’m hesitant to go to the police.”
“Anyone else who might want to hurt Andy?”
“He’s got a girl Angel. He told her going in about our open marriage. She was good at first but seems to have gotten crazy lately telling Andy to divorce me so they can be together.”

Christene Mary was a tall large boned woman with dirty blonde hair and big blue eyes. She was heavier than he last remembered but it’s been about ten years.

“Give me everything you got on Malone and Angel. I’ll start there. And it’ll be $200 up front.”
She reached into her purse and pulled out two hundred dollar bills laying them on Tom’s desk.
“Always business.” She said as she left the room.

Chapter 2

Tom pulled up in front of “Finest” butcher shop on Ventura Boulevard which also fronted for Victor Malone’s gambling and loan sharking operations.

LA was sunny and hot. The sun beat off the plate glass windows like a neon light on the Vegas strip.

Malone really was a butcher. He learned the trade of cutting joints and bones because it came in handy in disposing of a welching client.
But he took pride in the legitimate side of his front, providing a good product to his neighborhood patrons.

Tom entered the shop. It was like a mini supermarket almost.
He asked for Malone and was told he was in his office on the second floor. Malone was dangerous. Tom knew he could push but only up to a point.

Tom walked up the stairs and knocked. 
“What is it.” Barked Malone.
“Tom Hart private investigator. I’m working on the Andy Mary case. A customer of yours. His wife hasn’t heard from him for three days. That’s not like him. Anything you know about it.”
“You actually just told me something I didn’t know. Sounds like Andy may be running out on paying a debt. Now I’ll start looking for him myself” Said Malone.
“Maybe you already found him and grounded him into chopped meat.” Said Tom.
“Not a bad suggestion. You wanna work for me Hart. Seems like you’re giving more information than you’re getting.”
“Yeah I can see this is going nowhere.”

“Ask Benny to make you a hero sandwich on me. I appreciate you letting me know Andy’s hiding from me.”

Tom took him up on the sandwich. Italian with oil and vinegar. 
He wasn’t sure if Malone was really surprised to hear Andy was missing or covering up his murder.
He’d go back to the office for lunch before meeting with Angel next.

Chapter 3

Tom went back to the office and broke out the sandwich. He gave half to Beth who smiled impressed. 
He sat behind his desk and took a bite. Something didn’t make sense. Andy was struggling to pay a five thousand dollar gambling debt, meanwhile Christene was driving around in an Alpha Romeo. She obviously had a high end boyfriend on the side like Andy had this Angel girl. He filed it in his mind for later and headed for Ventura beach where Christene said he could find her tanning everyday.

She was a pole dancer at the Cougar Club which specialized in women over 30. A trist with a customer in a vip room can earn a girl a good living. That’s where she met Andy according to Christene.
Andy was around 45. A carpenter by trade he always was a good provider. He supplemented his income by doing collections for Malone and Enrique Costa a loan shark with a Mexican crew. Could be he was skimming off of Costa to pay Malone and got himself offed. But who knows. Just speculation. Christene provided plenty of intel.

Tom took off his shoes and socks and rolled up his pants.
The sun was stifling. He rolled up his sleeves and undid his tie.
Angel was on the beach right where Christene said he’d find her.
“Angel. My name’s Tom Hart. Your boyfriend Andy’s wife is paying me to find him. Hasn’t heard from him in three day’s. Wondering if you have.”
“Andy’s a loser. I’m done with him. He chose her over me so to hell with him.”
“According to her you’ve been acting crazy lately. Calling the house showing up all hours. What with the sudden change.”
“I run into a lot of men at work. They come and go. Andy was a terrific guy handsome, tough. A real man’s man. I fell for him yeah. But I ain’t into hopeless causes.”
“So you don’t know anything that can help me find him?”
“Well did she tell you she’s been sleeping with Costa. Heard it’s really hot and heavy. He bought her that convertible she’s driving around in. Maybe they have a motive to get rid of Andy. Ask her.”

Tom thanked her for her time. She was a hot little number in her bikini.
“Stop by and see me at the club. Bring your checkbook I’m worth it.”
“I’m sure you are sweetheart.”
Tom put on his socks and shoes on on the boardwalk after shaking the sand off his feet.
Christene never mentioned her affair with Costa which makes them suspects. Time to follow up with Christene.

Chapter 4

Enrique Costa worked out of his nightclub on South Hill Street on the Latin Strip. It was high end and catered to classy patrons with plenty of money.

Every night was New Year’s Eve was the club’s slogan and Costa was its charismatic King.
The giant chandelier hanging over the dance floor was its shining prize.

Tom walked in around 11pm. The place was packed with revelers as he made his way to the bar. Just as he suspected Christene was sitting at Costa’s  private table holding court with several banker types.

When their eyes caught she yelled out “Tom come join us.”
“We need to talk Christene. Why didn’t you tell me about your relationship with Costa. Didn’t you know it would put you in a compromising situation.”
“Oh Tom please you know Andy and I have our side affairs that was never a secret.”
“Maybe so but don’t you see this could make it appear like you and Costa knocked off Andy so you two could be together.”
“Why would we kill him silly. We could just get a divorce if that’s what we wanted. When I asked you to find Andy I meant it.”
“Ok well according to Angel Enrique bought you the car. Is he supporting you financially. Andy can’t pay off a five thousand dollar gambling debt while you’re buying sports cars how does that look?” Said Tom.
“Exactly what it is. Maybe Enrique and I will be together but for now I want you to find Andy. I still care about him.”

Tom was getting frustrated. Christene was drunk and not making sense. That’s when Enrique Acosta a barrel chested Latin lover type appeared and kissed Christene like you kiss your wife.
“So is this the private eye you hired to find Andy?” 
“Enrique, Tom- Tom, Enrique.”
They shook hands and Costa commented on how he’s paying Tom.

“You do understand how this looks. Andy worked for you making collections. Now he owes money to Malone. Money he doesn’t have. Meanwhile you’re dating his wife. I wish you would have been up front about this with me Christene.”

“Look let’s all have a glass of champagne. I wouldn’t be paying you to find Andy if I killed him now would I. Christene cares about Andy and doesn’t want him hurt. After you find him she’s going to get a divorce so we can be married. That’s the truth.” Said Enrique.

It was so crazy it just might be true. Tom always liked Andy and Christene. They were the only ones from his ex wife’s family who were decent to him. They drank the champagne and Tom resolved to unravel this web.

Chapter 5

Victor Malone was alone in his office. He was tallying the receipts for the day from what the Butcher store brought in.

He picked up the phone to order an associate to find Andy Mary and bring him in. But before he could dial the phone an assassin in a black hoodie burst in shooting him three times in the chest killing him instantly.

Tom got a call from Steve Foley his old friend from his LAPD days and homicide detective.
“Victor Malone was murdered last night in his office. Your card was on his desk. You working on something related?”

Tom told Steve the story. Steve told him there was nothing to link Costa to the murder. 
Tom knew the missing piece was Andy. He had to get to the bottom of his disappearance.

He put a tail on Angel and wasn’t convinced she let on all she knew. It was a little too convenient how she went from crazy ex girlfriend to calm pragmatist about losing Andy.
She left for her job at the Cougar Club around 10pm.

He walked up the stairs to the fourth floor. He picked the lock to Angel’s apartment door with a paper clip. When he went inside he could hear someone in the bedroom. Tom drew his .38 commanding the person not to move. Not too much to his surprise it was Andy.
“I thought I’d find you here. Angel wasn’t very convincing yesterday at the beach.”

“Tom. What are your doing here.”
“Christene put me on the case. Said she hadn’t heard from you in three day’s and was getting worried.”
“Who’s paying you Costa?”
“Christene is paying me. Where she’s getting the money isn’t my concern.”

“I’m hiding here from Malone. I owe him five grand Tom and I ain’t got it. Angel and I are planning our escape to Mexico before Malone finds me and throws me in the grinder.”

“Well Malone’s dead. Shot in his office last night. This is your alibis? Being here?”
“Malone’s dead?” Andy asked again unable to believe it.
“Yeah Malone’s dead and I’m having a hard time believing you didn’t have something to do with it. “

Tom turned for the door.
“Look you haven’t done anything illegal. But you’re in the middle of something I don’t know what, that can blow up in your face.”
Tom left pulling the door shut figuring if I was able to find Andy here I’m sure that Costa knows as well.

Chapter  6

Tom got in his car and drove away. He noticed a black Chevy sedan parked on the corner. He got about two blocks before realizing that car had followed him from his office to Angel’s place.

Whoever it was used him to find Andy.
He made a u-turn and sped back to Angel’s building. The black sedan was gone. Tom ran up the stairs two steps at a time. He burst into Angel’s apartment but it was too late. A singular bullet between Andy’s eyes. 

Tom was overcome with guilt. Costa used him to find Andy and now that he did he had him taken out so he was free to marry Christene his girl in the cherry red convertible. They even toasted to it an inside joke between the two of them.

It didn’t take long for Detective Steve Foley to arrive.
“This is Andy, Steve. They used me to find him. It’s Costa.”
“You have a theory but do you have anything concrete that can incriminate Costa in court?”
“Nothing it was a perfect plan. They set me up from the minute she stepped into my office.”

“Look. I’ll work that angle and anything else you can give me. But we need more than we have to make an arrest. There’s nothing more you can do here. Go home Tom and sleep on it. You might see things clearer in the morning.”

Tom couldn’t let it rest. He had to settle with Christene. He realized he couldn’t believe a word she said just like with her cousin Ann his ex wife.

He pulled up to her house. Andy’s house and rang the doorbell.
“Tom” she said seemingly oblivious. “What brings you here at this hour.”
Tom’s face was gray like ash. He was furious but he controlled it.

“The case is closed Christene I found Andy tonight, unfortunately somebody else found him too after me and killed him.”

Christene went down on one knee crying hysterically.

“Well there’s nothing stopping you from marrying Costa now.”
She looked up enraged. “How dare you say that. I loved Andy that’s why I hired you damn it.”

“Make it make sense then Christene. I want to believe you but it’s not easy.”
“I can’t. Andy had Angel and I had Enrique. We moved on but we still loved each other. I know it’s sick but that’s what it is.”

“Ok. Andy also had demons he was wrestling with. Anyway my job is done. Homicide got it now.”

“No your jobs not done. Find his murderer. Help them do it you’re the best. If it’s Enrique prove it.”

Chapter 7

Tom went back to his apartment. He lay down on his couch and put on the television. An old John Wayne movie was playing. Stagecoach. Tom wasn’t paying attention but he left it on as background noise. It soothed his brain.

There was something puzzling about Christene’s reaction. It was honest maybe too honest and passionate about an ex losing her husband. 

Tom started putting together a theory. Maybe it’ll add up.
Andy was into Malone for five grand he couldn’t pay. Christene starts dating Costa a rival loan shark. They get hot and heavy enough where he buys her an Alpha Romeo. Enrique talking about forever.

Can it be Christene played Costa to take out Malone to get Andy out of his debt. 

Maybe Costa got wise to it,that he was being played and took out Andy. Something to consider anyway.

For now he figured he should talk to Angel. She was his current squeeze and he was killed in her apartment. What did she know if anything.

Tom gave Steve a call. “Anything on Angel? Andy’s girlfriend?” “Nothing much. Had a couple arrests for fighting with customers. Broke a bottle of champagne over one’s head. Both were married neither wanted to make anything of it.”

“Thanks for the info I’ll remember to mind my manners when I go see her.”

“Surprised you’re still on the case. What gives?” Said Steve.

“Christene wants me to help find the murderer. Figured I’d see what Angel knows.”

The LA sun was blazing again turning skin red the moment it hit.

Tom pulled up in front of Angel’s apartment. He knocked on her door not knowing what to expect.

Angel opened the door in panties and a bra. Tom wasn’t expecting that. 
“Come on in she said.” Obviously been drinking.

“Angel we got to talk but you have to cover up some.”
“Your loss then.” She laughed before crying. She covered herself with a short silk robe.
“So who do you think killed Andy? How can you help me?”

“I think she killed him. Or she got her boyfriend to. She still wanted him and was pissed that I had him. Now no one’s got him.” She began crying harder now. 

“How about Malone’s crew? Any of them been coming around?”
“No. Andy said if he couldn’t pay he’d have to work collections full time until he paid it off. Something he wasn’t thrilled about.” Said Angel.

“Hey Cop. I can use someone to comfort me.” She dropped the robe and went to bed. “If you’re not going to take me up on it then shut the door on your way out.”

Tom was tempted. She was gorgeous after all but this was too weird. He never thought he’d be dismissed like that.

Chapter 8

Tom pulled up to the Stardust Lounge on Hollywood and Vine.
His contact Rusty a man of the alleys and whispers could usually be relied on for some good intel.

Rusty was playing a slot machine hidden in the back. Tom interrupted. “ We gotta talk my friend.”

Seeing an opportunity to get the twenty dollars he just lost back the two sat in a back booth out of sight.

“What can you tell me about this case I’m on? Any idea who killed Malone? How it ties in?”

Tom shoved a ten towards him.
“Come on Tom. I can use a twenty.”
“Let me hear what you got first.”

“A stripper’s been bragging about how her boyfriend took out Malone over a five grand debt he couldn’t pay. Then the boyfriend gets taken out yesterday. Pretty open and shut.”

“What’s her name?” 
“Come on Tom. Like you don’t know already.”

“Ok is that it? “ asked Tom.
“Yeah heard they were waiting for a PI to leave the apartment last night before taking him out for killing Malone. But by the time they got up the stairs he was already dead. Saw the girlfriend running away. She took him out for them.”

Tom pushed a twenty towards Rusty and hustled out. 
He was worried about Christene and Angel’s vengeance.

Chapter 9

Tom’s Ford roared to a hault in Christene’s driveway.
The Hills dark like a cave inviting terror.

He could hear Angel screaming unhinged.
He drew his .38 and burst through the front door.

Angel had Andy’s gun trained on Christene. Costa’s dead body lay motionless on the floor. She shot him going for his weapon.

“I killed Malone for Andy because he couldn’t pay his five grand debt. You’d think he’d have chosen me. But I heard you two talking about getting back together. So now I’m going to put you back together in Hell.”

“Angel stop. Put the gun down. It’s me Tom. I don’t want to hurt you. Drop the gun and talk to me.”

“That’s all you want to do is talk. I’m going to kill her Tom then you can kill me. A perfect end to this tragi triangle.”

A loud bang filled the air. Angel was hit in the chest she dropped the gun and fell to the ground next to Costa.

Christene seeing Angel distracted by Tom’s pleading reached for Costa’s gun, ending it for Angel.

She was shaking uncontrollably.
Tom covered her with a blanket that was on the leather couch.

“You had to do it Christene. She was going to kill you.”
Tom called Steve Foley told him to get down there.

1kypucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1kypucf/dating_liberal_men_vs_conservative_men_whats_the/,Dating Liberal men Vs Conservative men. Whats the differences?,"I’ve been with my conservative boyfriend for almost a year and we don’t really seem to have the same beliefs and values. Personally, i’d say i’m far from being a liberal woman. Mainly because i 100% believe in gender roles and a traditional life style. 

My partner doesn’t seem to believe in that which is shocking to me. He wouldn’t pay for the first date which threw me off considering he’s the one that wanted to take me out. Sometimes he’ll make me venmo him $5 for a drink or something when we’re out. His friend that was with us seen me paying for my own drink and instantly goes “dude, you’re not buying ur lady a drink?” He rolled his eyes and goes “i mean i can.” and it always puts a bad taste in my mouth considering i believe men should provide. I don’t mind taking turns too! It just feels as if he believes he doesn’t owe me anything. He never complains about money too so it’s not like it’s that type of “he’s broke” situation? He’s always buying things for himself which is fine. I genuinely think he just doesn’t believe in that type of lifestyle. Which is fine also! It’s not for everyone and i understand and respect that 100%. We truly have a great relationship otherwise. We never fight and usually have a good time together! This worries me though because of the future i want and what i believe in. 

Let me add that this is a nonnegotiable for me. i want to be a stay at home mother one day and raise my babies while my husband works. I’d love to cook homemade meals for the family, doing the cleaning, and try to provide a stress free household for my husband and kids. Sometimes i offer to wake up when he gets up for work to cook breakfast and even pack his lunch and make him coffee. He always laughs at that and shakes his head? So i stopped trying to do that for him. He’s always demanding that i get a good job too and make a ton of money. I understand that i need to work until we get to that point in our lives of course. I have a good career but again, i want that traditional lifestyle. It’s just looking like he doesn’t really want that? As if he expects me to provide as well even while pregnant? I’ve brought this up and he just gets annoyed and walks off. It almost feels like i have to teach him how to have more of a provider mindset. Again, it’s completely fine if he doesn’t believe in that life style but i’d like to find someone who does. 

I’m posting this because i’m very curious as to how liberal men think in relationships. Now in my opinion, my boyfriend seems to be more liberal than conservative. I’ve always been told growing up that conservative men love to provide for their wife and children and feel obligated to achieve that. I’ve also seen true conservative men providing for the family and just living that traditional lifestyle that i want so badly. That’s why i’m just not believing he’s conservative? Let me know what you think though. Also, we have a ton of liberal friends and we all get along great! I have noticed that my friends that have liberal husbands actually provide for them too though? It left me kinda shocked cause they seem to do more for them when we’re talking about traditional lifestyle.  At least more than my boyfriend lol

I guess i’m just asking if there is any truth to conservative men being the providers and liberal men just don’t believe in that life style? Not sure if my boyfriend and i will last with his mindset so this is definitely something on my mind. He’s always saying how much of a republican he is but most of the time i feel like the manly one in the relationship and i don’t enjoy that. For example, when my hands are full and i’m carrying heavy bags he doesn’t help. I have to get an attitude and be like “can you grab a bag or something?! i can’t carry this all by myself.” He just acts prissy about it and will say “What i have to cause i’m a man?” i simply say “Absolutely.” That’s just a small example, there’s many others lol. It just seems like he wants to be provided for and that’s just not for me. Any advice or thoughts? Hopefully this makes sense cause i’m not sure how else to explain it lol. 

Thanks guys!

1kypuc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hilton/comments/1kypuc7/stay_recap_hilton_kyoto_and_doubletree_osaka/,Stay Recap - Hilton Kyoto and DoubleTree Osaka Castle,"During my recent trip to Japan I stayed at the Hilton Kyoto and DoubleTree Osaka Castle. I posted some pictures of castle view from the latter earlier on, but I wanted to go over both hotels a bit.

The Doubletree is around one year old and a pretty solid hotel. Location wise, it's walking distance from a major train station, but the immediate nearby area, aside from the castle, is a bit bland. View wise, both sides of the hotel have good views, but I do think the Castle view is superior, especially since you can see the castle lit up at night. The city view does include the nearby river, so that's nice.

The standard room with the castle view was decent. My big issue is they do the 'kings get a shower, no bathtub' setup, which isn't unique, but I do want to call that out since tubs are pretty common in Japan, Hilton or otherwise. Rooms are otherwise very modern and have a decent amount of space, especially compared to some rooms at other hotels in Japan. People used to North American Hiltons may find the rooms slightly on the smaller side but only slightly. Big thing is the rooms have the nice modern master consoles next to the bed, so you can close the curtains and shut off all the lights from the comfort of your bed. 

The hotel amenities are pretty good. Wasn't the biggest fan of the pool, but that's due to the ladders being very narrow, so my bigger feet found it hard to balance. Actual facility is real nice and they have these fun machines that can dry your bathing suit in about 10 seconds. The hotel restaurant is fantastic and the breakfast (which you can get included as a Gold member) is a must-try, as it features a lot of local food options as well as typical staples. Given Osaka has a lot of local favorites given it being 'Japan's Kitchen', they did good stuff. They do the pretty efficient method of handing you a card you just turn back in when you're done so they know to clean a table and also track who gets a free breakfast, etc. 

Staff are fantastic. Of note, I wanted to mention that the hotel lobby is on the 6th floor of the building, but there's a reception area on 1st next to the elevators, and they can stash your suitcases there for you. 

Moving on to the Hilton Kyoto, I'm not sure the exact age of this one, but it's a pretty modern build, with a lattice style interior meant to better invoke Japanese design. It definitely doesn't feel like a typical Hilton, but you still get everything you'd expect. It's located along the Kamo River, right near a couple of major train stations with a lot of amenities nearby. View wise the hotel isn't super exciting, but I imagine some rooms can get a river view (maybe?).

Room wise, this was incredibly spacious. I could invite people in to sit and it didn't feel cramped at all. The room was a bit more open concept but in a Japanese style, with the bathroom having two sliding doors to hide it away, with a full tub as well as a rainfall shower. The master controls by the bed are also a thing, and they include a blackout curtain. The style I think is best described as neo-classical, featuring modern comforts but in a classic Japanese design?

Hotel amenities were a bit inferior to the Doubletree for me. Specifically, the pool was basically the same as the one in Osaka but without the bathing suit cleaner, so boo. It also has a rooftop bar... which is basically all gimmick. Drinks are overpriced and while hanging out on a roof is cool, the view isn't the most exciting. The one thing I really liked is the entrance has a sort of artificial bamboo forest (basically a stylish fence) with a water feature to give walking in from the street a nice romantic feeling to it. The hotel has an incredible amount of style.

  
Breakfast was also fantastic. I think the Osaka one was slightly better, but the Kyoto one suffered from only having one coffee machine (and in a horrible place) plus I just wasn't as impressed with the local features. I will mention, gold members and above also got a free bonus drink, either a breakfast yuzu lemonade thing or a chilled matcha. So that was also nice. 

Staff were great. I wanted to specifically call out their handling of umbrellas on rainy days, they were really good about that.

  
So in the end I do recommend both properties but I wanted to add a bit of nuance. ",3,1748562389.0,Hilton,0,1.0,False
1kyptv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1kyptv2/acne_anyone_else_triggered_by_certain_kinds_of/,[Acne] Anyone else triggered by certain kinds of coffee?,"About a month ago, I found Walmart brand coffee because they sent it to me by accident, and I loved it. It had a bit of that chocolatey flavor coffee can sometimes take on, was nice and strong, and its cheaper than my usual Folgers or Maxwell house, so I switched for a bit. Around this time, I also went on a sea salt chocolate kick, and admittedly ate way too much. I started getting a few white heads pop up that didn't wanna go away, which I hadn't had in a long time! So I assumed it was the chocolate, and while stopping the chocolate two weeks ago has lessened it, I'm still getting some. So I've come to conclude it is most likely the coffee, and have switched back to Folgers. I'm really hoping this takes care of it.

I'm also on Spironolactone for hormonal acne, and have PCOS. I know caffeine in general can cause issues when you have PCOS, but I drink a lot of Folgers, Maxwell House, and the occasional giant Starbucks iced white mocha. Never had this issue. Hopefully I'm not going through yet another hormonal change, but again it did get somewhat better after stopping the chocolate.

Anyone else have these issues? Any advice? Except to tell me I should never drink coffee. That's not happening, lol. <3

1kypsym,https://www.reddit.com/r/MiamiBachelorette/comments/1kypsym/miami_bachelorette_party_tips_itinerary_ideas/,"Miami Bachelorette Party Tips, Itinerary Ideas, & Must-Knows! 🎯🌴🍾","We had the best time in Miami for my Bachelorette party that the girls & I are still talking about that weekend! And I want to pass on what I now know/have learned in the process from the experiences we had, and let it serve as guidance for those who may need it amidst all the planning and questions that arise. I found that most other posts/comments on Reddit weren’t actually as helpful as I had hoped, primarily because the information was from 2-3 years ago and was already so outdated that most of the places/clubs mentioned there have long closed.

I left comments on other people’s posts who were asking for guidance/recommendations in Miami and my inbox blew up with messages and follow up questions. So I figured the best and most constructive way to share our experience and recommendations is through this recap post.

I’ll share the recap and all of my recommendations for clubs, pool parties, how to get on the guest list, restaurants, where to stay, how to get around, etc. Basically everything that you will need to know so you’re prepped and ready for Miami. Also creating this guide because I wish something like this would have existed when I was planning my Bachelorette party. But luckily we figured it out and came out with amazing memories!

**Overall Impressions:** I’m so happy that I went with Miami for my Bachelorette party destination. I’m obsessed with Miami now. It’s such a beautiful, vibrant and sexy city. There are so many things to do and places to go. We never ran out of ideas or things to do, and everything is so easily accessible.

**Where to stay:** I highly recommend staying in Miami Beach, this way you’re close to everything and anywhere you go is a quick walk/ride. There are so many hotels right on the beach all along Collins Ave and there are many Airbnb options. The choice you will go with will, of course, ultimately depend on your group’s budget and group size. Ideally, I think all Bachelorette groups want to be together in one house to hang out. But if you don’t find a good Airbnb option for your group size, and have to go with a hotel option instead, just ask for the customer service/front desk to get you rooms close together, so it’s easy for you to go room to room. You could also get one of the rooms that is more like a suite and is bigger, and have it be the designated group hangout spot. In terms of location in Miami Beach, anything on Collins Ave from 5th to 50th St, South Beach, South of Fifth, Sunset Harbor, and West Avenue. Another neighborhood that’s great in Miami is Edgewater or Design District, while it’s inland, it’s still very close to Miami Beach and very easy to get around anywhere. Brickell has its own mini tropical New York vibe but it’s the furthest neighborhood, so expect to spend a lot more time on commuting and in traffic, and more $ Ubering back and forth to Miami Beach.

**Transportation:** We Ubered everywhere, and needed 2 cars to fit everyone. Everything was very accessible and easy to get to and prices were actually very reasonable. Uber XL was anywhere between $10-20, depending on how far we were going, of course. Premier SUV would be somewhere around double the price of Uber XL. But there are so many Luxury SUVs in Miami that whenever we requested Uber XL, a Luxury SUV showed up every time.

**Restaurants:** There are so many incredible places in Miami. You guys will have a fun time choosing where to go. Here are the restaurants that we loved + new places that recently opened that I’ve been to and loved on my recent trips back to Miami, so you guys have the most updated list to choose from.  
**In Miami Beach:** MILA, Japon at The Setai, Jaya at The Setai, Pao at Faena Hotel, WATR at 1Hotel, Cecconis, Call Me Gabby (last three all are great for both lunch or dinner)  
**In Edgewater/Design District:** Zuri, Mandolin (great lunch spot), Dior Cafe (another cute lunch/coffee spot)   
**In Downtown:** Casa Neos, Seaspice   
**In Brickell:** Sexy Fish

We were a big group. It was 13 of us total. Some of the restaurants might ask you for a deposit to secure your reservation or if you request a table outside. It all depends on the size of your group and also on the season. My Bachelorette was in the summer, which is considered to be Miami’s off season, so mostly all places were more laid back with their policy and we got away without having to do a deposit. The one place that did ask us for a deposit, it was for $25/person, which I thought was more than reasonable and we agreed. There are other places like Kiki on the River that asked us to commit to a minimum spend of $250/person for a table outside, which I thought was ridiculous and not worth it. But as you can see from the list, there are so many options to choose from. Just try to book 1-2 months in advance. Leaving it to the last minute will not go well in Miami, especially for big groups.

**Clubs/Pool Parties:** For everything nightlife/pool parties related, [@theguestlistmiami](https://www.instagram.com/theguestlistmiami/) on Instagram took care of us with everything. They actually ended up saving my entire Bachelorette weekend. They are amazing, very professional, reliable, and communicative/responsive. They have a lot of vip hosts at every venue in the city and can get you on the guest list to anywhere you want to go.

I’ll tell you exactly how my bachelorette weekend almost went to shit so you don’t make the same rookie mistake I did. The nightlife aspect was the only element that was completely unaccounted for because I read so many other posts and comments on Reddit suggesting to just “wing it” and leave it to the last minute because “you will end up running into so many promoters on the beach or the street”. *Bad, bad idea and huge mistake.* Yes, you will get approached… but either by snake oil salesmen or straight up scavenging vultures.

We got to the beach on Friday afternoon as soon as we landed in Miami. We got approached by like 10 different promoters. Some of them tried sell us fake tickets, some tried to sell us tickets to clubs that don’t even sell tickets, and some were so sketchy promising us the moon. Each approaching promoter was hilariously sketchier than the other. So we decided to go with one that seemed more decent than the rest. He invited us to a pool party at SLS on that Friday afternoon and promised us a “vip table and everything is free”. We get there, and as soon as he walks us in, and counts us like some herd to get credit for us from the pool party, he pulls us aside and tells us to pay him $50 each if we want to be with him at his table and have free drinks. We didn’t like his attitude and the fact that he deceived us, so we declined to pay. He rolled his eyes and left us. We ended up buying our own drinks at the bar and leaving shortly after.

Later that night, we messaged a different “moon promising” promoter that we met at the beach, who promised to take us to LIV if we would go with him to Vendome first. We reluctantly agreed because we wanted to go to LIV and heard stories about how expensive it is to get into LIV. We get to Vendome, and same thing happens. He asks us to pay him $50 each to be at his table (we didn’t even want to be at that club and only went there because he promised he would take us to LIV for free). This time we decided to just pay this guy $50 each (as that’s what 2 drinks ended up costing us at SLS earlier that day when the other promoter left us hanging).

Everything was going ok, we had some shots and drinks at his table, until 1 hour later when we asked him about LIV. He was stalling and brushed it off saying that the plans have changed and the guest list is closed. We got super annoyed and felt deceived again. We decided to go to LIV anyway by ourselves. We get to LIV, the line at the door was so crazy that we waited 20 minutes to get to talk to a doorman, just so we can get quoted $5k for a table or $200 each just to get in. There’s no way we were going pay that, so we told the doorman that we were on the promoter’s guest list (the one who was supposed to take us there). The doorman told us they only do tables or cover charge, and that there is no guest list for LIV and he had no idea who that promoter was. So that guy didn’t even work there and completely ripped us off!

We decided to continue “winging it” and go to E11even, just so we can spend more money on Uber going all the way across town, to be quoted even crazier prices at the door. E11even asked us for $7k for a table or $300 each to get in.

I was so frustrated and nearly in tears thinking that my entire Bachelorette weekend would be ruined. The girls & I went on Instagram and started looking up clubs by location, and kept seeing story posts from @theguestlistmiami, so we decided to message them. The fact that it was an actual company and not some random promoter with 100k fake followers or a private account seemed more promising. Especially seeing their online presence, and many people tagging them on instagram in both stories and posts (you can’t fake those!).

I mentioned to them our earlier experiences and they were very compassionate. They told me that, unfortunately, it happens all the time, especially with beach scammers, lying promoters, and without proper planning. They also confirmed the crazy prices and the fact that there is no guest list at LIV and E11even.

They replied super fast, asked us for pictures of our group, which I find slightly strange, but apparently this is how the guest list works in Miami. They quickly presented us with all of their options available of where we can go so last minute and explained to me how it works.

They recommended us Gala, so that’s what we decided to go with that Friday night. After we completed the form they sent over to get on the guest list, they immediately got us in touch with a VIP host, who would greet and take care of us.

When we arrived at the club, our host met us at the door, we skipped the entire line outside and he walked us right in. It felt so cool! The host took us to his table, brought us bottles, and he made sure we were having fun. What I also loved and appreciated was that he was very attentive and would check in on us, but he didn’t hover over us and would just let us have fun and do our thing.

They also ended up surprising me with a Bachelorette sign, which I didn’t expect or even knew I could ask for. It was very sweet and considerate!

We didn’t have to pay for any tickets/cover charge at the door, or for any drinks. We had free admission, vip entry, skipping all the lines, and the host brought us more bottles, so we had drinks all night (we even left a full bottle on the table when we were leaving). The only thing we paid was the service fee/tip on the form we completed, as they told us that no promoter or host is allowed to ask us for money.

After that amazing Friday night, I ended up using them for the rest of the weekend! We decided to go for a pool party on Saturday and another nightclub on Saturday night. We went through the same process to get on the guest list and they had their hosts taking care of us. We ended up doing the pool party at Strawberry Moon (the music wasn’t the best, but we had lots of fun) and later that Saturday night, we went with them to MAD club. Their promoters/hosts for the rest of the weekend were all very professional and attentive.

As you can see, the nightlife aspect was the only part that gave us a tough time in the beginning because I followed poor advice to just “wing it”, instead of being more intentional.

Overall, we loved Miami and had such an amazing experience! It’s a really fun and vibrant city with so much to offer. I hope you will have the best time in Miami, and with all of this information, you will be better prepared than I was and you won’t have to waste your time figuring it out as you go.

1kypozp,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1kypozp/physical_side_effects_all_point_to_zyn/,Physical Side effects all point to Zyn,"First post on Reddit here - Found this thread when I quit last year (relapsed earlier this year after some life bullshit, breakup, new job, etc.) and figured I would share my quitting journey while I kick these zyns in the dick for good.

Usage: 2 years (with the exception of when I quit for two mths). Consistently 15 pouches (1 can) of 6mg per day. Sometimes 1 1/2 cans…

Physical symptoms: (i.e. why I am quitting) 
-extreme fatigue in the morning. Need 3 lip pillows to get me back to equilibrium
-can’t drag myself out of bed in the morning/lack of motivation
-muscle pains everywhere
-joint pain
-lost vascularity in my arms that I used to have in my arms (signaling circulatory impact of nicotine) 
-winded very easily during cardio
-went from losing a few pounds when I initially started zyn to putting on 15 lbs from before I started. 

All of the symptoms above have led me to a handful of doctors appointments and a bunch of blood tests. Everything is normal (except slightly elevated BP)

We all know this….but this shit is fucking poison. Why do we even do it? Just to control withdrawals….the buzz that originally came about is long gone and we just maintain by jamming more of these motherfuckers into our upper lip. 

Lessons learned from the first time I quit: 
-expect a few sleepless nights or nights with minimal zzz’s
-set expectations up front by telling yourself that you are going to have “the flu” for a few days and that it will suck. I found that the physical symptoms were not quite as bad as I expected. 
-try to quit at the beginning of a week so (if you happen to drink) you will be past the first 72 hrs by the time Friday rolls around. 
-when cravings come, chew gum violently and go for a walk. If you are driving, have sunflower seeds or a nicotine free pouch (coffee or caffeine pouch etc.) 
-welcome the cravings and celebrate the fact that this bullshit is leaving your body.
-bump some great tunes and envision several days from now when the physical withdrawal symptoms will be gone. 

I will be tracking my journey here. Today is Day 1 - also, fuck the taper method. There is a dr on YouTube that explains a taper just extends the withdrawal period. Cold turkey worked for me last time,e despite a more challenging initial few days. 

Wishing you guys all the best in your journey kicking these little suckbags to the curb. Sending good vibes to everyone starting their journey 👌🏻

1kyphbx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kyphbx,It lasted 2 nights,"Texts between me and my mom. 
We recently bought a camper because she had been coming over more often. My children love her so even though I didn’t have the best relationship with her as a child I thought I would try to fix it as an adult.

TDLR: my mom begs us to come get her so she can stay in the camper we bought specifically for her if she wanted to come stay at times then she gets mad and says she never asked us to do anything for her because I asked her to give me a freaking crumb of help or at least acknowledge her grandchildren that freaking adore her for some reason. She told me I was overreacting and that I’m too much because I’m sick of her sitting on her ass 24/7 and bitching about everything. 

This may be long so sorry: 
She always complains about how no one else cares about her and treats her like trash. She says when she stays with her mom (my grandma) that she cleans and everything for her but they treat her so bad blah blah blah SO we got the camper so she’d have her own area when she’s here. She brought all of her stuff which isn’t much because she doesn’t have an actual place to live, just staying with family or her boyfriend. 

My husband is the only one that works. He buys her cigarettes and coffee constantly. She can go through 2 packs a day when she’s with us. She has no job so he was willing to take her in completely as long as she helped me out or even just acknowledged her grandchildren but she hasn’t even done that. 

She sits on the couch and sleeps all day. If the kids come up to her she tells them to stop or tries to make them sit down and “nap” with her…. They’re TODDLERS. They’re not gonna just sit all day. 

We just moved so I’m busy unpacking everything. Husband works but helps when he’s off. She’s done nothing to help. The only time she gets up off the couch is to use the bathroom or go out to smoke. Instead of getting up and walking two feet to the basket of blankets, she decided to take my couch cover off and use as a blanket after bitching that it was too hot so I turned on the air then she bitched that it was too cold. She just complains constantly. 

So it really set me off today when I was unpacking for the billionth day in a row and the toddlers dumped out and threw their cards all over the living room floor. No big deal, I left them unsupervised with them so I expected it BUT she walks in laughing about it, sits down and just watches my sweaty ass clean it all up.. didn’t even offer to help. I guess that along with everything else made me crash out. My husband comes in and is helping me but he tells me to relax so I’m like “it’s hard to relax when I’m the only one here not getting to sit on their ass 24/7 and no one offers a single bit of help” 

I haven’t even mentioned how she’s tried making my toddler turn on the air conditioning for her even though it’s not 6 steps from her sitting on the couch. I don’t want the children thinking it’s okay to mess with it, pushing buttons constantly. When I told her to stop telling them to turn it on she said “I didn’t, I told them to stop touching it” lied right to my face like I HEARD YOU CLEARLY? What the fuck? She even helped one over the GATE TO THE KITCHEN EVEN THOUGH THE GATE IS THERE FOR A REASON? I don’t want them in there pushing the buttons on the stove? She also let one of them go outside with her without any clothes on, just a diaper while the other one was inside screaming her head off. I had to chase after them and bring them back in. She also for some reason thought they weren’t allowed in THEIR OWN BEDROOM? She stood at their door yelling for them to get out of the bedroom and go to the living room…. My entire house is baby proofed in the areas they have access to and they’re allowed in their room alone. Not sure why she was forcing them to the living room for her to just sit and fall asleep and get pissy when they try to get her attention. 

I have really bad sciatica pain right now from moving and unpacking. It’s so bad at times that I can’t even move until the pain passes but I’m still not complaining as much as she is over EVERYTHING. 

Anyway I tell her that she makes no sense and she’s ungrateful as fuck not because of what we do for her even though I think that too but I don’t wanna throw up stuff we’ve done for her in her face but let’s just say not even considering the cigs and coffee, she does not hesitate to fucking spend our money. Nobody complains though but I am now because she tells me “I DIDNT ASK YOU TO DO ANYTHING” when I ask her to acknowledge my children or maybe help me pick stuff up every once in a while when I’m the main person unpacking. She tells me I’m TOO MUCH and OVERREACTING. That’s honestly when I lost it on her. 

I asked her what her problem was. Why she needs to sit on the couch all day ignoring her grandkids and acting like she’s wore tf out when she does nothing, literally nothing. Like I’m surprised she’s not too lazy to breathe on her own at this point. She’s not an old grandma either. She had me as a teen and I had my kids young too. She’s not even 50 years old yet. She then tells me to just take her back. I said “okay pack your shit and you can go when *husband* is off work.” 

She kept saying she never asked us to do anything and I told her that’s not the point. The point is she fucking messages me all the time and tells me about how everyone treats her like shit and she wants us to come get her which is a VERY LONG DRIVE. I am trying to fix our “relationship” when she clearly doesn’t give a shit so I’m done. She can go back to where everyone treats her like shit and tell them how I treated her like shit lol which I know she will do. 

I’m probably going to block her on social media and go 100% no contact instead of low contact which is what it’s been for the past few years for good reasons. I’m sick of her always playing the victim and guilting me. Since we had that spat she’s been saying she can’t hear, that she thinks she has an inner ear infection causing vertigo and anytime she stands up from the couch she falls over. I’ve not been acknowledging her little act at all.

I never had actual loose leaf Yerba mate before. My family is Brazilian but not from the South, so I was never introduced to it. I learned to love coffee in college, and after a brief time drinking black tea, I switched over to coffee permanently.

For whatever reason I got Yerba Mate Lab's short's on my YouTube reel and the curiosity got the best of me. I ordered his starter pack of Argentinean Cruz de Malta mate with a stainless steel bombilla and gourd. I tried it, I frankly found it yucky and soupy. It tasted like a nutty green tea. 

For whatever reason I tried it again a day later and the taste grew on my a little. But what got me very intrigued was the sense of alertness I got while also feeling calm and chill from Yerba. I also enjoyed ""setting up"" and preparing my mate, and I think it's nice that the drink is not as hot as coffee, it's a more relaxed set up. I also really enjoyed using a bombilla and the stainless steal gourd. Seems cool.

But still, the taste of Cruz de Malta was weird. But I saw that Messi liked Canarias mate, which is Uruguayan and a more fine powder and it's supposed to be stronger tasting, which as someone who is used to coffee I think it'd be more up my alley. I went to Fiesta and found some and bought, tried it out and now I really like the taste. It's herbaceous, kind of similar to green tea but stronger, its a fuller grassy taste and while some of the nuttiest is still there, it's better than Cruz de Malta. 

I think I'd like to experiment with added flavors though, but I want to maintain the quality that Canarias as. Should I experiment with just added extra things myself to the Mate powder like chopped up orange/lemons rinds, or maybe cardamom like the Lebanese do, or maybe is there a good brand that adds flavor for me?",3,1748560926.0,yerbamate,3,1.0,False

\-----

The joint training exercise ended not long after I was ‘rescued’ and brought back to the Marine transport. I soon found out the only major bummer from the entire deal is I would be required to wear my new Marine issued void suit for the next 24 hours as part of testing.

Given that I would have to eat meal paste provided by the suit’s systems, I felt this was more VI-Punishment instead of VIP treatment. But hey – I got a shiny new experimental void suit, so a day of eating meal paste and pooping in my new void suit to test the waste systems wasn’t a bad deal. I might take advantage of that during Rosa’s next engineering briefing…

Because I was already on the Marine ship and appropriately pre-drunk, I got to sit in on the after-action report of The Dread Pirates Engi-nerd against the Terran Marines.

Entering the conference room, you could tell how this was about to go. Chief Engineer Rosa and First Officer Auggie were sitting in chairs up front wearing pirate hats and smug grins. The Marine commanders were… well, about as happy as Auggie had been when I knocked his first cup of coffee out of his hand a few weeks back.

Scratch that. They were way less pleased than when Auggie lost his first cup of coffee of the day. More like they just been told there would be no coffee for a month.

The short version? The 40-man Marine team suffered over 50% casualties. While they succeeded in saving me from the horrible pirates, they had shot me in the arm and completely failed in their secondary objective of taking control of the ship due to high casualties forcing them to withdraw. How did they ensure such a high level of “success”?

A lot of it came down to laziness and stupid assumptions.

First, many of the Marines didn’t take the exercise seriously. Something about scientists supposedly spending too much time in labs and not enough time in the gym, more likely to be pacifist, and so on.

Have you seen what happens when one scientist goes into another person’s lab and moves things around? Or borrows something without asking? Break out the riot gear. I thought mechanics and engineers were protective of their tools, but scientists and their stuff? Yikes.

Second, because they didn’t take things seriously, they didn’t read the briefings and figured superior training would win and cover any mistakes. They forgot (or missed) that our team outnumbered theirs, as well as a few minor details such as how fast I can run (which was intentionally not documented and somebody should have looked up – it’s not like we Py’rapt’ch haven’t been part of the greater galaxy for a few centuries now).

But that wasn’t all. While our team had numbers, we also played a few dirty tricks. Like Auggie giving me hard cider to be “drugged” and difficult when the Marines found me. As the briefing went on, one of the Marines grumbled loud enough to be heard.

“They didn’t follow the rules,” he said. This instantly caught the attention of a Marine Sergeant, the one I saw in the hall being very shouty as I ran past at the end of the exercise. Instantly he was next to the Marine who had grumbled.

“Do you have something to contribute, private?” he yelled at the man who now looked just a wee bit worried. “Stand up and contribute, son! Make your opinion known!”

“Yes, Sergeant!” the Marine called out as he stood up at attention. “They didn’t follow the rules, Sergeant!”

“DO YOU THINK PIRATES ARE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE RULES, PRIVATE?”

Rosa and Auggie didn’t. And the private quickly found himself in agreement with Auggie and Rosa, although not necessarily by choice.

Rosa had taken a number of the training pistols and attached them to cleaning bots, which are only about 9 inches off the ground. Then the cleaning bots were handed over to be controlled by our crack team of gamers with full VR headsets and Playdeck controllers.

Even better, when the Marines threw smoke grenades to block vision the cleaning bots were unaffected due to their radar and other sensors which typically prevent them from running into walls, objects, or people. Not to mention the smoke grenades reduced visibility for the Marines so it took longer for them to figure out the real threats were the bots, not the standing crew they took down quickly. There was also the fact that cleaning bots fit conveniently into vents and other tight spaces even with a laser pistol strapped on, so they could ambush and retreat with ease.

The kill ratio for the bot team was hilariously high, and the Marines had to use an obscene number of grenades to get past all ten of them.

Auggie worked with Doctor Franklin to tie our booby traps into the ship biometric systems. Our team could run past all the booby traps, but the Marines would set them off. As a result, our team was able to lure a bunch of Marines to their ""deaths"" just by retreating. And you couldn’t disable any of the booby traps unless a live member of our crew was within one meter, so they had a dead man’s switch of sorts. Try to disarm and it go boom. Big badda boom.

Then came the Marine commanders admitting those were the only two dirty tricks allowed as both could be done easily by pirates with limited knowledge and training. The rest? One of the guest ‘referees’ for the exercise from some division called SpecOps had the following to say.

“Regarding the other 15 pages of ideas and suggestions for the pirates from Susan’s science team and Rosa’s engineers, my only conclusion is there is something seriously wrong with those people. Each team submitted two pages dedicated to just Susanoff or Rosanoff cocktails using standard cleaning materials and starship drive fluids, and I don’t even want to get into what they could to with their scientific supplies. All I can say is our operators don’t fight that dirty, and we plan to test and steal a few of their tricks.”

Rosa’s grin turned absolutely wicked at that comment. Auggie just looked a bit sheepish.

Just a quick follow up to the previous escapade felt appropriate. Can't leave you wondering how the Dread Pirates Engi-nerd got the Marines so angry and shouty! Next, Haasha will be a void suit test dummy. Will there be more angry-shouty Marines? Finger guns? Real guns? Place your bets now!",22,1748560899.0,HFY,6,0.97,False

i am calling on you for some help with a start up business that is doubling as a community project! in March, i took over a distressed business, an alternative bar in the same plaza as haywood quikstop in west asheville. with intention to create a 24 hour community safe space and non-alcoholic bar, ""JUST BE Kava x Coffee"" was born. our first day of operation was April 30. we serve kava, coffee, tea, n/a beverages, and cannabis infused mocktails for now, with other products in the works. we have been soft opening every day for a nightcap window of 8pm-10ish, and with no advertising or signage, i can't believe how awesome the turnout has been. thank you to everyone who has visited! a great sign of what's to come. 

i believe this incredible space can be a hub for so many creative things. there are a few items on the agenda that i would like to start pulling interest for. feel free to fill out a [google form](https://forms.gle/ogvifbLZQFZwjcen9) if you are interested in any of these:

    \- food truck vendor
    
    \- community art project/collaborative outdoor wall mural/s
    
    \- pollinator habitat restoration
    
    \- hosting events (there's a stage out back, it's going to be a fun summer)
    
    \- employment
    
    \- any other ideas	

i was gifted with this opportunity to steward this special space in the aftermath of all this past year has brought to our city. it has not been easy to get to this point, but my vision and intention is clear. i want this business to be a landing spot for our community, for whatever it needs. asheville needs a 24 hour chill spot/safe space. sometimes, people need a place to just be. i am here to serve, but i need more funding to make it happen as quickly as i want it to. if you would like to have access to a 24 hour lounge with a healing/grounding vibe here in asheville, please support my business by paying for your patronage in advance. you can purchase a [square giftcard](https://app.squareup.com/gift/MLWKY0E5CVK06/order) for any amount to support JUST BE Kava x Coffee directly. your purchases in advance will help me retain full ownership of my company as i build my first brick and mortar business.

i am reaching out in hopes that you may resonate with and answer my call, as i believe i have answered the call to rebuild a space for the highest good i can do with the resources i have! thank you. cheers to great coffee, kava, and more, 24/7 in west asheville, coming soon. 

thank you for your attention to this post, i appreciate it! i am here for any questions, just reach out ...or stop by if you're in the area!

If you have read and enjoyed my Harry Potter writings, you may want to download or print yourself a copy by this Sunday, June 1, 2025, because I've made the heartbreaking decision to delete them.

My one-shots, Legilimens, Defensive Magic, and Offensive Magic are still available on AO3 until Sunday.

Harry Potter consumed me body and soul from when I read the first book in 2001. From 2004 to 2013, I wrote over 500,000 words in fanfics, including collaborating with my Mum on my 350K+ word magnum opus, *Harry Potter and the Battle of Wills*, when I was a law student in 2004-2005. It was well-received, getting over 6000 reviews, and I still get a few almost every month! 

Along with that, I damn well *worshipped* J.K. Rowling. At a study abroad session in London in 2005, I went to all the sites, and sometimes sat in coffee shops writing my stories just like she had once done.  I obsessively followed her website and blog, applauded her charity contributions and her feminist and anti-eating disorder remarks.

But in more recent years, I've seen that same author engage in continuing, escalating, open, and downright *gleeful* activism to oppress and torment the transgender population, devoting her fanmade fortune to funding bigoted legislation and her public voice to cruel harassment.

I had already withdrawn from most fandom activities as a result, but today as I saw she's created and funding yet another organization for this vile ""cause"", I decided there was one final step that I needed to take to end even the most indirect and passive way of encouraging people to consume her content and put money in her pocket.

And so I'm removing my fics, those labors of love for the content and for my fellow fans over so many hours, days, months, and years spent writing and discussing and sharing, for which I still get reviews. On my conscience, I can't continue to do anything that encourages or inspires people to consume J.K. Rowling's content.

It's breaking my heart. I'm saving the reviews pages, making myself cry as I do it. I never would've thought to see this day back in those days. Writing those fics helped me get through the brutality of law school and the very rough first years I spent as a practicing lawyer.

Even some older fics I wrote nearly 30 years ago that I think are cringe nowadays, I've never been able to make myself delete. Every fic I've ever written is so full of memories, both of the writing process and engaging with readers.

I don't understand how it came to this. No doubt some will huff that it's silly to delete my beloved fics for ""political reasons"", but it is so much more than that. I'm cisgender, but it doesn't matter. Bigotry is bigotry, and trying to legislate bigotry into law and using it as a weapon to harass and intimidate already-vulnerable people is something that I can't tolerate even passively.

**ETA:** For the record, let me be very clear - I completely understand that there are many fanwriters who can't, for any number of reasons, bring themselves to take down their works no matter how despicable the original creator's actions. It's a deeply personal decision, and for those of us who've devoted hours to years to our stories through writing and reader interaction, it's an extreme act. I don't blame anyone who can't do it even if they despise their original creator's behavior and denounce it.

I see past threads broached this subject but maybe not to the specific situation I have. I respectfully ask the question below to the medical experts that frequent this group.

Are there cases of people actually being able to induce something akin to 'seizures'' voluntarily? I've never been diagnosed with a seizure disorder but since I was a small child I've always been able to create such a feeling by doing what feels like ""squeezing"" something in my brain as if there were a diaphragm around a particular gland in it. Obviously there's no such muscle to do that (that I'm aware of - I'm just describing what it feels like. I can do this at any time of my choosing and control it just like it were any other skeletal muscle although it requires a little more focus and effort. 
When I do it causes a strange sensation that feels like the jitters you would get from drinking way too much coffee but accompanied by what I can only describe as ""nerve panic"" where an electrical sensation runs through my brain and eventually causes involuntary twitching through the rest of my body if I keep doing it.

I always wondered if this is something other people can do but when I've asked people just look at me weird. Also sorry to all the people with actual seizure disorders.

I also wonder if my case would make for a useful case-study to some type of researcher. I've never done this when hooked up to an EEG or anything and I'm curious if it would pick anything up.",0,1748560471.0,Epilepsy,6,0.38,False

* Improved ground surface textures. The locations are pretty but the textures are pixellated and distorted a lot. This is particularly evident on above-sea islands where it resembles Far Cry 1
* Fix for the fish swimming through player bases, apparently able to phase through walls
* Controls prompt when driving the Cyclops for the first time as not obvious how to rise/descend

As our city evolves, many historic sites face demolition or transformation, risking the loss of their spectral stories. Our mission is to document and discuss these tales before they’re lost to time—because even if the buildings disappear, the spirits remain.

Here are some of Miami’s most haunted locations, steeped in history and mystery:

🏛️ Villa Paula (Little Haiti)

Built in 1926 as the Cuban consulate, it’s now an art gallery. Visitors have reported piano music, the aroma of Cuban coffee, and apparitions of a one-legged woman believed to be Paula Milord.  ￼

🏚️ Deering Estate (Palmetto Bay)

Situated on ancient burial grounds, this estate is known for ghostly voices and apparitions. Ghost tours are offered, sharing tales of its haunted past.  ￼

🎭 Coconut Grove Playhouse

Closed since 2006, this historic theater is rumored to be haunted, with reports of ghostly figures and unexplained phenomena.  ￼

I wear baggy clothes a lot so it's hard to tell sometimes but when I do wear things that show my body a little better I feel like they just kinda feel sad for me? 

They're all mothers so of course I guess I should see this coming. My director asked me one day if I had lost weight and she said I looked kind of gaunt, and me, and my autistic ass, just full out admitted that I dont usually have enough money to buy food. In retrospect I am super embarrassed I admitted that. They make comments about how I dont eat, I dont eat any goodies that come in from lovely parents either like donuts or coffee etc. 

Today there was a graduation party for our pre-Ks and there was food. When it was over and we cleaned up, my director packed me a whole portion of the brownies that were out and a bunch of the grapes, too, and told me she hardly sees me eat and wants me to bring them home.

I wore a shirt from my old job — a tech company with a pretty distinct logo on the back — because, well, it was comfortable and I wasn’t expecting to be recognized hundreds of miles away.

Big mistake.

While waiting in line for coffee, someone stormed up to me asking about a billing issue with their small business account. At first, I was confused — then I realized they recognized the logo and assumed I was staff. I politely told them I don’t work there anymore (and certainly not at 7am on a Saturday in a different city), but they weren’t having it.

They *insisted* I “just check the account” since I “probably still have access,” which was wild because I hadn’t even worked there in months.

Eventually, I just walked off mid-sentence, coffee in hand, muttering: “I really don’t work there anymore. And even if I did, I’d still be off the clock.”

Google images is useless so I need a better jumping off point. 

Books? Blogs? Underground films? Small forgotten movies that feel real? Coffee table books? Other subreddits? But I would also love to hear from people who lived it or see any photos you can share.

Dunno if it helps but my characters will be riding the subway, hanging out in art studios and the exteriors of such buildings, looking at street art, art galleries, hanging at a bodega, and partying at an illegal rave type place in an abandoned building. But anything of the city from that era would be helpful. 

Bonus: if anyone can tell me what neighborhood these people would live in, realistically —

One is a successful artist (26 year old gay man) with a type of apartment that has the tall ceilings of probably some converted warehouse/factory but impossibly cool of course. I feel like he'd want to be close to the art scene? 
One other character is a rich, socialite nepo baby type who mostly likes to party. There's also a shared art studio that the starving artists use. 

I've been to NYC many times but not enough to learn the connotations of certain areas and especially not in the early 90s and I wouldn't know if things have changed.",2,1748559776.0,AskNYC,2,1.0,False
1kyowqd,https://i.redd.it/ax765rawxs3f1.jpeg,Some tips I've picked up after playing for a while...,"Hay.

A day or so before your first winter, harvest all the grass and weeds on your farm. Doesn't matter if you don't have a silo or animals yet just store it in a chest. This will give you more than enough hay for the following months. 

Keep all the fiber for crafting and later you can use a dehydrator to turn it into hay if you run out.

Fish.

When you unlock bamoo nets put one in each fishing area. Preferably near a spot you are likely to visit like near the lake temple teleport and the mine enterence teleport. They will sometimes catch rare fish for you.

You can do the same with bug traps.

Every morning I use my ""coffee  machine"". An auto chest where I dump all my coffee beans  next to a keg.

Chests have a checkbox in the upper left hand corner labeled ""Include chest in global inventory."" I unchecked all my chests except for any containing cooking items. This saves scrolling through multiple chests when choosing cooking ingredients in the kitchen.

Consider putting all frequenty used crafting materials into chests set to global inventory.

Some tips I'd like...

What do you think is the best use for the greenhouse?
I currently have fruit trees and strawberries in mine.

What's the best way to catch a Luner Moth and Orchid Mantis?

1kyova7,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1kyova7/baptist_pastor_coming_over_for_coffee_help_needed/,Baptist pastor coming over for coffee - help needed,"Bear w/ me as I try and articulate my question.

I’m a typical white, regular guy who bounced around religiously in my youth. 

I’m married to an Armenian / American. We have been an active member in the Armenian Apostolic Church for 25 years. We got married there, raised our kids there, monthly Bible study, etc…

I have grown to deeply love the Armenian Church despite going to an evangelical college for 4 years. 

We recently moved and now live an hour away from our Armenian Church. 

We started attending a little struggling Baptist church a couple times a month because it was 200 yards down the street from our house and we wanted to still be able to attend church on busy weekends. 

The Baptist pastor is awesome. He is young, articulate, well educated and a true believer. I love his sermons but truly distain the service (feminine music, prayers, projection TV’s, lack of real communion, etc…)

He is coming over for coffee next week to talk to us about membership. 

I have zero interest in entertaining becoming a Baptist but he is a good guy and it’s his job to grow his flock. My wife is also soft so she said “yes” to hearing his sales pitch. 

So my question is:
How to a politely defend my Apostolic faith against a guy who studies the Bible for a living?

A lot of why I love the Armenian Church is intangible and I can’t necessarily articulate it. The music, the ancient prayers, the liturgy, the reverence & seriousness of worship, etc… all make me love to worship Christ in that environment. 

Thanks in advance for any advice provided.

They’re tiny and mostly in my living room near a large balcony door (which is not closing properly I’ve emailed my landlord about this but they’ve not got back to me yet) - we have fly nets on all but one window in the kitchen (which I’ve now kept closed) 

For scale the bugs are crawling on standard vertical blinds - they’re super tiny like maybe the size of an ordinary ant and smaller than a lady bug 

I’ve found a couple crawling on me when sat on my sofa and it’s making my skin crawl just thinking about it 

Any advice? I’ve checked the living room for a source but I’ve not found more than 3 or 4 at a time - we vacuum regularly and these things do seem to fly short distances

1kyotk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1kyotk1/nbd_goruck_bullet_xpac_15l/,NBD: Goruck Bullet X-Pac 15L,"Of course I thought I was ""done"", but Goruck just released their VX21 [X-Pac collection](https://www.goruck.com/collections/x-pac) and their [green Bullet 15L](https://www.goruck.com/products/bullet-x-pac?variant=45897552724068) spoke to me.

This version of the Bullet emphasizes what the bag excels at: it is lightweight from its materials *and* its simple construction. It omits all external webbing, and given the stiffness of the xpac it actually *stands on its own* better than other versions of the backpack, yet with weatherproof fabric and zippers, this must be the lightest yet most-functional for its purpose Bullet they've ever made.

Goruck have done a few [VX21](https://www.x-pac.com/product/vx21/) Bullet releases before, afaik most recently the [Carryology Kaidan 2.0](https://www.carryology.com/projects/carry-collaborations/exclusive-release-goruck-x-carryology-kaidan-2-0/). The [Kaidan 3.0](https://www.carryology.com/projects/carry-collaborations/goruck-x-carryology-kaidan-3-0-ultra-collection/) was in Ultra and featured their double-compartment Bullet, all of which I'm not as interested in. There are a bunch of videos on youtube comparing all the releases! In addition, this production release is comparatively very reasonably priced for Goruck.

# Purpose

I find that one backpack gets 90% of my usage. It should be extremely light and comfortable for long walks, just big enough to throw in my [Side Effect](https://www.tombihn.com/products/side-effect), a water bottle, and hold my hoodie and hat if I get hot on a walk, and have an internal laptop sleeve that fits my Macbook Air so I can bring it to a cafe. Bonus if it can do overnight, which isn't easy in the Apex Mini, but the Bullet has a lot more capacity. I was very hopeful for this bag to compete for that ""most of my usage"" slot with my Apex Mini and overall it hasn't disappointed.

# Photos

Here are some photos, next to other similar bags I've used for my EDC bag slot.

* My [current beloved EDC bag](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1ikefk6/nbd_ile_apex_mini/) is an [ILE Apex Mini in forest waxed canvas](https://ilequipment.com/products/apex-mini?variant=41354782048433). Love it. Rolltop + center-zip is a unique design, and despite being their ""heaviest"" fabric version of the bag it is so light from its simple construction.
* I used an [Alpaka Metro 12L in Army Green Axoflux](https://alpakagear.com/products/metro-backpack?variant=43930285342882) as an EDC for a while. This Bullet in xpac is **so much** lighter despite holding a lot more, and is nearly as light as my Apex Mini. **Finally** I have a very-light clamshell, which is the most-superior bag design!
* My [CT15](https://ctactical.vn/collections/ct15-backpack) 2.0 introduced me to clamshell bags a few years ago and is my molle and patch and multicam outlet (Cordura 500d fabric)
* [CT21 ""Black Knight""](https://chuyentactical.com/balo/balo-ct21-v3-0-backpack-black-knight/) (Ecopak 400 fabric). I love its internal lining color.
* CT Sun Bear (Ultra 400 fabric)

# Notes

* The Bullet xpac feels like it will need a lot of breakin, esp for the straps and the zippers
* The zippers are shockingly stiff. Compared to my CTactical weatherproofed zippers, these are much stiffer out of the box.
* Unlike the CT21, Goruck provides no counter-pull loops so you just have to manhandle the bag to use the stiff zippers. I *do* appreciate that this is further simplicity in construction, but it does make the bag slightly harder to use in practice.
* NO ORANGE LINING hooray. I appreciate the white on the reverse side of the un-lined xpac, and same-color internal lining that's still visible since the bag isn't black!
* Well, except in the top quick access pocket :) Which is surprisingly limited! Also -- you can see this in their product photos as well -- the way the bag is constructed the back padding pokes out at the top of the pocket, making the already-stiff zipper quite cumbersome to use sometimes. Hopefully all this breaks in over time without impacting the fabric.
* For this size of carry, I prefer no separate laptop compartment, so this is the optimal version of the Bullet for me. I have a CT21 with a big laptop compartment and two external water bottles for coffee and water for ""office"" carry if I need. To be honest, the CT21 feels like the ""nicer"" bag in many ways, but with the Bullet's size and lightness it wins for most usage!
* I was worried the bag would be too tall for my small frame or too crinkly from the xpac for everyday use, both of which are not a problem. It is slightly less comfortable than my ILE Apex Mini because of its height, but it is a more functional bag overall.
* In looking for a small EDC clamshell, I even tried the for-kids [CT Junior](https://ctactical.vn/products/ct-junior-backpack?variant=44446184440083), but it didn't look right on an adult. I didn't think to include it in the lineup...
* Finally, shout-out to this [Montbell shoulder pouch](https://www.montbell.com/us/en/products/detail/1133407?color=GN), which works without webbing on the shoulder straps! I of course had to get the green to match the Bullet. I usually use a [Matador Speed Stash](https://www.matadorequipment.com/products/speed-stash?variant=47333248368961) but that requires a sternum strap to keep it in place.
* If I were to get an after-market sternum strap for the Bullet (which I don't expect to want for that size of bag, but some people say the xpac is slippery when using so I'll find out), I'd grab [this Savotta sternum strap](https://www.savotta.fi/products/universal-sternum-strap) that doesn't depend on shoulder webbing.",6,1748559525.0,ManyBaggers,7,1.0,False
