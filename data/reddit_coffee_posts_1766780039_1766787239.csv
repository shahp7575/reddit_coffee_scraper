1pwgkjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pwgkjd/the_unexpected_catharsis_of_houseplants/,The Unexpected Catharsis of Houseplants,"I notice that tending to my plants has become a sort of therapy for me. The simple, quiet routine of watering, repotting, studying their leaves for signs of health or distress, even just watching them grow, carries a strange kind of peacefulness. The other day, I was holding a conversation with a friend who was going through a stressful time at work. As we talked, I found myself idly pruning my peace lily, the action oddly grounding in the midst of my friend's frustration.

There's a strange sort of parallel there, I guess. Even the hardiest plant can falter if not treated right, and so too can we. And just as a plant needs a proper environment and care, so do we. Is it that strange that I find such comfort in tending to something else, in seeing it thrive under my care?

Title: An Unanticipated Encounter at the Coffee Shop

Body: Yesterday, sipping my morning coffee at the local café, I recognized an old flame sat at the corner table. The ease with which we fell into conversation was startling, as i had always associated our past with tension and conflict. We sat there, for what seemed like hours, chatting about our current lives with no reference to our past misgivings. It was one of those surreal moments where time and history seem to stand still for a bit, allowing you to pause and take a breath. Has anyone else experienced such an unplanned, unanticipated encounter that ended up being surprisingly pleasant?

Title: Reflection on the Perfect Imperfection

Body: I’ve been contemplating the beauty of the imperfect recently. It’s interesting how the pursuit of perfection, for so long, had me overlooking the charm and authenticity in flaws. The other day, I tripped over a rug at home and knocked over a ceramic vase. After the initial shock, I saw the pieces scattered on the floor, each shard a story of imperfect beauty. There was something extraordinarily mesmerizing about it.

Contrarily, this doesn’t negate the appeal of perfection, but it’s this balance between perfection and imperfection that’s intriguing me. Has anyone realized the beauty of the imperfect after a lifetime pursuit of perfection?",1,1766787118.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

What to do now?,"I matched with a pilot on tinder 3 days ago. I was in his city and swiped on him. He swiped right when I was already gone. So he wasn't using the passport or layover swiping. I added this for the context. 

We matched and he asked me if I also live in his city? Lets say Boston.

I said no, but was there for a wedding (true). I am from (other city)

He said: oh, I see. So, it would be good if you return sometime. If I have a layover in your city I will let you know ;)

I asked him what he uses tinder for and he said: just for fun. 

I didn't ask more about the fun part. But on his profile he sad he wants a relationship. 

He was kinda not interested and I understood. I mean different cities, like 6 hours drive. So I just said it was nice talking to him and if he still wants to meet and we have this opportunity to let me know. He said he will and asked me to do the same if I return to Boston.

Then he asked for my social media.

I gave it to him. In the past few days he heart reacted some posts and sent a fire reaction to a beach photo on my story but when I tried to talk to him he was still not interested in the conversation.

I wouldn't think too much of all this but I guess I will go to Boston after New Year and considered having a coffee date or something with him. Is it worth it or what does his behaviour says?",0,1766787049.0,WhatShouldIDo,0,0.5,False

1pwgjdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Barber/comments/1pwgjdy/i_built_an_android_app_for_salonbarbershop/,"I built an Android app for salon/barbershop appointment management - no subscriptions, no commissions, no cloud. Would love your honest feedback.","Hey everyone,

I’m a solo developer from Romania and I spent the last year building an appointment management app specifically for barbers, nail techs, hairdressers and small salon owners.

I’m not here to drop links or spam - I know that’s against the rules and honestly I respect this community too much for that. I just genuinely don’t know how else to reach the people this app was made for, so I figured I’d just be upfront about it and ask for your thoughts.

Here’s what makes it different from the usual suspects (Fresha, MERO, etc.):

	∙	One-time payment - around €10, basically the price of two coffees. No monthly fees, no yearly subscriptions, no “premium tiers”

	∙	Zero commissions - you keep 100% of what you earn

	∙	Fully offline - works without internet, your data stays on YOUR phone, not on some server

	∙	No account needed - just download and start using it

	∙	No online exposure - your clients don’t see other salons, no marketplace, no competition for your own customers

It handles appointments, client database, SMS reminders, inventory/stock management, and work schedule. Available in English and Romanian.

I built this because I noticed most apps in this space either want a monthly subscription or take a cut from your bookings. I thought there should be an alternative for people who just want a simple, private tool that they actually own.

So my question to you guys: Is there actually demand for something like this? Or do most of you prefer the cloud-based subscription model?

I’m not trying to sell anyone anything here - if you’re curious about it you can search for it, but mainly I just want to understand if I’m solving a real problem or if I’m just yelling into the void.

Thanks for reading, and sorry if this post feels out of place. Happy to answer any questions.",1,1766787037.0,Barber,0,1.0,False

Almost 2 years ago my husbands older sister was about to have a baby so he asked if if they wanted to go get coffee just the two of them before she has her baby. She said yes but my husband has to come bc when we got married we became one. (We are Christian’s so this makes sense but not to this degree lol) my husband was like um are you ok? Bc they sounds very controlling and that worries me a bit. They took that are my husband trying to pit her against her husband and then it turned into them not speaking to everyone in the family until recently when my husband called and kissed their asses until they “forgave him”. So they came to Christmas. We all know no one can touch their baby bc everyone else in the family is Catholic and apparently babies are vulnerable and bc they aren’t Christian’s they can idk possess the baby? I have no clue. So they were holding their 14 mo baby the entire time even when he wanted to get down and play with HIS COUSIN my son who is 23 mo. It was so weird. My fil said that earlier at church their son wanted to be held by him he had his hands reached out. My FIL said his daughter, my husbands sister almost said yes but then paused looked at her husband. He said no and she said sorry no. WHAT THE HELL?! I feel so bad for this child that he can’t have a normal life bc his parents are freaks. I want her to divorce that man SO BAD no one likes him. This has happened for ever mind you.

1pwggf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1pwggf4/traffic_etiquettes/,Traffic Etiquettes,"Hi 

In the last year, I have been feeling this weird thing that San Francisco slowly has been changing in terms of diversity, traffic etiquettes and general sense of tolerance been really high to people doing anything and everything. 

  
Among all things the thing which has been bothering the most are the food delivery folks who has been blatantly violating traffic rules with these e-motorbikes, riding on sidewalks, violating signals and posing a serious risk to themselves and other people who are on the road. I am not a hater, but I feel this is a serious issue. Often food delivery folks are immigrants, who have a very different idea of road etiquettes and laws and they are making the streets very dangerous. 

  
I am thinking to put a dash cam on my car and record these people, so that I have evidence of the kind of blatant mockery of traffic rules that these folks showcase every single minute they are on the road. 

  
Today I saw a uber driver just offload this load of coffee on the streets. This was the last straw for me, which made me post here. 

  
Is there anything we can do to enforce better road safety on the road. ",0,1766786826.0,sanfrancisco,1,0.29,False

Last Pick: **Darius Garland 8+ Asts✅+1.3U (7-2 Last 9 POTDs)+1.3U**

Today's Pick: **Davion Mitchell 8+ Asts**

**Score Bet**: **+120**

Wager Amount: 1.5U to WIN 1.7U

League: Atlanta Hawks vs Miami Heat (6PM CST on NBA League Pass)

**Recap**: Garland cooked in the 2nd half! I knew we were good when he ended up wit 4 Asts in the 1st half. Wit Mobley back in the lineup I should have sprinkled on Garland Dbl-Dbl as well! But damn, **that pass from Garland to Mitchell in mid-air for alley-oop was awesome! Garland is such a great passer! 8 Asts for plus money was a steal!**

**Matchup:** Going another Asts player prop but I am betting on a dude that I have never wagered on before and that's Davion Mitchell. It's a shame that this is the first time I'm wagering on him (I've tailed plays from other cappers on him, but never featured or found value placing bets on Davion). I oftentimes look at superstars player prop or look for game props, but today I see a lot of value at plus money on Davion to record 8+ Asts against the Hawks today. **But I do not disagree wit this line by the books, I think this line is exactly where it should be, I just favor him to get more Assists in this game because of the matchup.** **Mitchell averages just below this line (7.5 APG) and he has not covered this line in his 11-career games against the Hawks.** Basically this will be a first for him to record 8 or more Asts against this opposing team, but look at those 11 career games against the Hawks, he was not a starter in those games. **This season he has not only started more games but got an increase in his minutes this season (bumping from 27.4 mpg last season to 30.3 mpg this season). So that's one advantage I see** and the Hawks gives up a ton of points, they allowed the 4th most points in the league. What I love about Davion Mitchell is that he is a very selfless player, he loves dishing out passes to his teammates. The Heat also puts up a near 120 points per game, (119.2 ppg this season) which is 9th most team points in the league and wit the Hawks giving up a ton of points, especially their last 6 games (allowing an average of whopping 133.2 ppg) I really like this matchup for Davion Mitchell!

**So although Mitchell does not have trends of this line or has ever hit this line against the Hawks**, I just love supporting data and stats on Mitchell. 

**The Play & Prediction :** 1.5U on Davion Mitchell 8+ Asts. I really like this value which is why I am going 1.5U today. I think he dishes just enough so I won't be laddering up either. Mitchell records 4+ Asts in each half.

I bought a Samsung Bespoke Smart Things microwave ME19CB704112AA and (as I should have guessed) started failing to warm after the warranty was up. It didn’t even warm slightly. Also a month later the over range lights went bad and both burnt out.

I scoured forums and tried to contact Samsung but the only troubleshooting was basic and anything further required a tech on-site. 

Randomly since the microwave was still installed above the range I bought a replacement bulb set (LED) for it and at least that started working. Then a few days later I took the bread out (it was being used as a glorified bread box) and dropped my coffee in out of pure curiosity and it came out piping hot. No troubleshooting or help docs mentioned the over range bulbs would have anything remotely to do with microwave function.. but if this happens to help anybody else who has exhausted other options it’s worth it. I wonder if there’s a safety shutoff circuit that runs through the lights as an unlisted feature…. Or a planned obsolescence feature?

**We, TXEC by the Grace of God King of Talossa and of all its Realms and Regions, King of Cézembre, Sovereign Lord and Protector of Pengöpäts and the New Falklands, Defender of the Faith, Leader of the Armed Forces, Viceroy of Hoxha and Vicar of Atatürk, Azul àd ár citaxhiens es cestours:**  
  
Today marks the 46th anniversary of our Kingdom's founding. Nearly half a century ago, Robert Madison dreamed an impossible dream that became a living reality. The Kingdom of Talossa may have begun as a 'silly notion' in a Milwaukee bedroom, and perhaps in some ways it still is—but it has thrived, evolved, and matured into a resilient nation.  
  
The past year has tested us, yet it has also been a season of remarkable growth. We have welcomed new citizens into our fold, conducted two general elections, and faced internal strife with a steadfastness that defines us. We Talossans are a unique people: resilient, idealistic, and always carrying a necessary touch of the magical.  
  
Last Independence Day, I proposed two themes for our year: Community and Partnership. Looking back, I see those themes in action despite the miles between us. Whether through the TMT special edition, the Fantasy Hockey League, or our 'Coffee With the King' sessions, we have found joy in simply being together. Partnership was equally evident in our leaders, who chose to do what was required rather than what was easy during our most serious moments. While election seasons often bring incivility, I remain hopeful that this new government will rise to its own high standards while honoring the foundations laid by previous administrations. Our democracy is strong; it is our shared duty to keep it so.  
  
Because of this, I am renewing our commitment to Community and Partnership for the coming year. While we rallied as a people, we also recognized that pockets of distrust remain. Talossa has the opportunity to rise above the fray and prove to the world that our 46-year experiment is not just surviving, but thriving. We must reject cruelty and demagoguery, striving instead to be what John Winthrop first envisioned and Ronald Reagan later championed: 'a shining city on a hill.'  
  
I close today with the same words I shared last year, for their poignancy has only grown: What we have is precious. We must cherish it, foster it, and allow it to flourish. Let us work as one community to welcome new citizens, to speak and use el Glheþ as often as possible, and to weed our garden of anything that threatens our joy. We have a forty-six-year history that is rich, unique, and entirely our own. Let us honor it together.",1,1766786285.0,micronations,0,1.0,False
1pwg7yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1pwg7yq/stuck_on_what_machine_to_get_1500/,Stuck on what machine to get [$1500],"Right now we have been using a Cafe by GE (an old version of the Cafe Affetto I believe) and it has stopped working. We're looking into getting a new machine to replace it and want something more reliable that we won't have to replace in another 2-3 years. Our machine is our most used appliance in our home, we work from home and have multiple drinks a day.

I'm looking for some advice on what machine to get. I would like to say I narrowed it down the the following choices, but every time I feel like that I come across something else that makes me second guess myself.

We care a bit more about convenience than getting the best possible quality so we've been debating a super automatic, but I only drink milk drinks and am concerned they may not be hot enough.

Right now, our machine goes from bean to cup but does not do any milk drinks or anything like that. Just grinds the beans to shot, portions, and brews the shot.

We are currently between:

Gaggia Accademia - We REALLY like that it is a super automatic that also has the option of a manual steam wand, but I can't find many reviews on it and am a little worried about spending that much on it if I don't LOVE the coffee coming out. We also really like the steam cleaning of the milk jug spout after each drink. We don't love that the current sale is only from whole latte love and their return policy seems questionable at best.

Ninja Cafe Luxe Pro - This seems to have a lot of really good features for the price point, but it's a bit more manual than we have now and worry we may regret not getting more of an auto that we don't have to worry about cleaning after every shot. I also can't figure out if the reviewers for this are all paid promoters. I've seen a lot of comments and posts about having to send units back, so it has me worried.

Kitchenaid kf8 - We keep seeing this one being compared to the jura z10. I have a couple buddies who have the jura and rave about it, but that's out of my price range. The kf8 seems to be comparable for half the price? I also can't figure out if all these ""rave"" reviews on the kf8 are paid promoters. The lack of a manual steam wand on here has me hesitant as if the milk drinks aren't hot enough I can't really do much.

I'm also open to other suggestions, but I am NOT looking for a separate grinder. I am looking for something that at the very least does something like the Ninja that will portion and grind each shot for you all in one machine

Started writing it all down. Changed the names. Altered the details. Protected the guilty.
My Girlfriend asked why Im doing it now. After all these years of silence.
Because, I told her, keeping their secrets was my job. But Im retired now. And these stories? Theyre mine. They always were.
She smiled. Poured me another glass of wine.
Make them dark, she said. Make them funny. Make them true.
What if they recognize themselves?
They wont. People like that never see themselves clearly. Thats why they needed drivers in the first place.
Shes right. She usually is.
So I write. Every morning. Coffee and cigarettes and forty years of secrets carefully disguised as fiction.
Mario Pilgrim, theyll call me. Not my real name. Not my real story.
But real enough.
And when they read it, the ones who are left, the ones who might remember, theyll wonder.
Theyll wonder if that chauffeur. That invisible man. That nothing person who drove them for all those years.
Theyll wonder if he was paying attention after all.
Let them wonder.
Ive earned that much.

This is my very first Reddit post so please be gentle, I’m still figuring out how this works.

I’m 29F and moved to Minneapolis a couple of months ago from Dallas for work. The move + new job + travel + general life chaos has made settling in take… longer than expected. I’m finally getting a bit of a breather starting January and realizing that while I love my own company, being home all the time is probably not great for my mental health.

I’ve been trying to make friends, but between work being hectic and the anxiety that comes with moving to a new city alone, I honestly don’t even know where to start. I’d really love to meet new people and build a social life here, I just don’t know how.

So I’m looking for recommendations for:

	•	Safer, low-pressure, not-super-intimidating ways to meet people

	•	Places or activities where it’s normal to show up alone (even if you’re not good at said activities)

	•	Groups, classes, clubs, or events that are friendly to newcomers

I’m pretty chill, enjoy cozy things, coffee, walks, trying new hobbies, and I’m not a huge party person, but I’m open to stepping a little outside my comfort zone.

If you’ve been new here before, or have ideas on where a slightly anxious but friendly human can go to meet other humans, I’d really appreciate it 🫶

I am still processing how to feel about it. This happened on Christmas eve. We were at my family’s home. I don’t know if I will ever go back there. My wife took a break to go for a long walk and pop over to her mom’s house that is only a mile or two away. I went into the garage to also take a break and the door was cracked so I could hear them talking. I sat there for about 10 minutes while they dumped on my wife, and a little bit me as well.

Reasons include:

* when we went outside to leave, my wife looked up at the sky and smiled and said hello to the moon. They mocked her saying it.
* when the sun was setting she said we should come look (Yes, of course I did, she has never asked me to get up and look at a sunrise or sunset that wasn’t 100% worth it. One of the best things she has given me is the thought to look more and appreciate my surroundings.)
* she holds coffee cups with both hands wrapped around them and this is apparently cringe?
* she has a braid of hair she wraps with different colored string and does holiday colors. My mom said it was “sooooo tacky”
* she wears holiday themed earrings like jingle bells or peppermint candies and that is also cringe
* she wears “weird” outfits and tells people she got her clothes at a thrift store if that’s where she got them. I don’t think her clothes are weird. She was wearing a plaid skirt, white top, and a silly cardigan with snowmen and stuff embroidered on.
* they were talking about ozempic at dinner because my mom and sister are on it and they said they could get it for my wife and they were offended she said “i’m happy with my weight” because, according to them, she needs to lose 20lbs and it made her seem pretentious. They were also like ""did you see how much she ate"" with gagging.
* she always asks for a smaller fork
* she one time said she thinks a celebrity my sister is a mega fan might be gay, and my sister brought it up and somehow found it extremely offensive and called my wife “psycho” and “disgusting” over it (she is a hypocrite because she used to talk about this ALL the time with other celebrities somehow her favorite is just not allowed)
* she doesn’t get her clothes professionally tailored which has always been an issue with them, something they brought up before we got married
* She read over 100 books this year and they think that’s “cringe” how she also always brings a book with her in her purse. They said “does she not have any friends”
* “speaking of her purse did you see what she was carrying” it was a kate spade bag… I thought kate spade was designer. I was the one who got it for her....
* She had “blank nails” and I guess she has the type of hands where she should really wear fake nails to elongate them?
* My sister kept saying ""cus she's a QUIRKY"" girl with weird inflection

Now I know you’re going to say, why would you sit there and listen to people bash the woman you love. Number one, if she had been there I wouldn’t have. But it was also a surprise for me because aside from the closeted celebrity thing and off the rack clothes, no one has ever expressed disliking her before. I was very confused because I also had to wonder, was I missing obvious signs before. I felt bad because what if I was one of those guys who was obliviously letting their wife get pummeled by their family emotionally. I would be so upset with myself if I let that happen. 

I left abruptly and went to my mother in law’s house to be with my wife. Later on I asked her if my family has ever made her feel uncomfortable and she just didn’t tell me to avoid drama. She was hesitant to answer and then she said that my sister might have anonymously harassed her about the celebrity but she never had proof it was her so she never said anything. But she doesn’t go on social media except to see pictures from her friend circle, she’s never talked about that celebrity online so she doesn’t know why anyone else would have. She said she also noticed my mom making a face at her outfits when she takes off her coat but she knows my mom is very into appearances.

I did not tell my wife any of what they said at least yet. I don’t know what to do next. I am giving myself time to process. People are allowed to have their opinions I get that. But I am really sad that they would say all those things about her like this. I get now why for example my sister tried to sell her handbag and shoes to her all the time.

Would it be overreacting for me to call mom and say “*I heard the things you said about my wife at Christmas Eve. I am beyond disappointed to find out how catty and mean you two were about someone who has only ever wanted to be a part of this family. Please do not contact me again unless it is to apologize for the horrible things you said and for being superficial and childish to boot.*”

And if I do that my instinct is to tell my wife the truth but not the things they said. Just say “I overheard some things they said and it disgusted me.”

I have gained work related experience starting at 18 through internships and various student jobs. In my current role, I notice that my practical knowledge is often on par with or even exceeds that of colleagues who have been with the company for several years.

I really appreciate the positive and open working atmosphere. Communication is very accessible. I can easily ask questions to colleagues or my team leader, and they can just as easily approach me. Which I see as a strong point within the team.

Depending on the project, I carry out site visits to check installations and collect the necessary technical information. Which I then further work out in detail at the office. Travel times can vary from a short 30 minute drive to in some cases, journeys of 3–4 hours one way, making some days quite long.

I experience a strong learning curve in this role and benefit from a high degree of autonomy. Projects are largely developed and executed independently. Once my work is prepared, it is reviewed briefly with my team leader, mainly to finetune details.

Overall, this leads me to the following question: would you consider this to be a below-average, average, or good employment contract, given that this is my first full-time position and I have limited points of comparison? Based on earlier contract proposals, the gross salary offered here is the lowest I have received (previous offers were closer to EUR 2,800 gross with largely comparable benefits). However, I consciously chose this position because of the positive company culture and working environment.

Additionally, the company is growing at a strong pace, which I also see as a positive factor for the future. I joined in August as employee number 48, and by January the team has already grown to around 55 people, which may create further opportunities as the organization continues to expand.",2,1766785480.0,BESalary,1,1.0,False

1pwfvyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1pwfvyy/inside_the_actors_studio/,Inside the Actors Studio,"A couple of weeks ago I posted a notice about my book, ""Acting, Autistically: A Journey on the Spectrum,"" which is a practical and metaphysical guide to acting, and also a memoir. You can read the first two chapters for free on Barnes & Noble, and most of the first chapter on Amazon. The following excerpt is from the book, to wit: 

Auditioning for the Actors Studio Drama School was a big day for me. I had already failed three huge auditions: the first was a combined format, where more than fifty representatives from as many schools sat in the audience while I performed; the second was for Yale, and the third was for Juilliard. In the first audition, MAPs, sponsored by the University of Missouri, I played it safe, as suggested by my undergraduate advisor, using one of the narrator monologues from *Our Town*. I got tongue-twisted in the first two sentences, lost my place, and started over. The rest of the audition was nearly flawless, but fifty or so pens went down and wrote on fifty or so notepads, and I never heard from any of those schools.

Second audition, for Yale, playing it safe again, the audition was near-perfect, but I failed the interview. After being asked why I wanted to go to Yale, I eloquently described the benefits of the program—the *Actors Studio’s* program. After being informed that I had described another school, I said “Um..., I’ve always wanted to live in Connecticut!” Oh, well, moving on.

Third audition—Juilliard: alma mater to Kevin Kline, Robin Williams, Christopher Reeve, Ving Rhames, Patti LuPone, Viola Davis. Tough acts to follow, but I was *ready*—or so I thought. Seven hundred fifty people auditioned that day, many of them nearly half my age. Did I play it safe again? Yes, I did, and I paid for it. My audition was before the artistic director, James Houghton, just the two of us. He sat there and said, “Tom…, that was a pleasant monologue.” *Pleasant*. “We’ll let you know.” A couple of hours later, the announcement was made about who had made the cut—two eighteen-year-old boys who had recently graduated from *high school*. Out of seven hundred fifty. One of them looked like Timothée Chalamet, or so I imagine.

Fourth audition, the Actors Studio Drama School (ASDS), the house of James Lipton. Bradley Cooper wasn’t a star yet, and I had no idea what was waiting for me. No more playing it safe, time to *man-up*—I used the infamous monologue given to Roy Cohn in *Angels in America: Millennium Approaches*, where he talks to Joe Robertson about Ethel Rosenberg. I, 6’ 6”, blonde hair, blue eyes, coming off like a 'Nazi,' probably offending everyone in the room. Who was in the room? James Lipton, Barbara Poitier, and *Roy Cohn* himself, veteran actor Ron Leibman, who originated the role, and was awarded a Tony. Had I known Ron was sitting there, I’d have gone back to *Our Town*. I kicked off my shoes, performed the monologue, and sat down for my interview with James Lipton.

Jim asked about my about my process, and why I had taken off my shoes. Looking around Tishman auditorium, I answered, “It’s *my building*. In the play, Roy either owns the entire floor or the entire building, so I’m going to take my shoes off in my building.” Jim went on to ask more questions, about my time in the Navy as a Hospital Corpsman and Field Medic (I wrote ‘Combat Medical Specialist’ for the application), and if I had ever been in combat. “No, but I was trained for it, with live-fire exercises and fake injuries (moulage),” was my answer. Jim then said something like, “Three years is hardly enough time to give you the basics in acting, but we do take the program seriously—are you sure you’re ready?” Thinking back on my time in the Navy, and the Marine who nearly beat me to death, I answered simply, “I survived five years in the Navy, three of those with the Marines—I think I can handle it.” Jim replied, in that gothic voice, even an octave deeper, “I’m sure that you can.”

**The Actors Studio Drama School / The New School for Drama**

During three years at the ASDS, which became the NSD at the end of my second year, I managed to make many enemies and a few friends (see *Basic Technique*), and left in disgrace (see *Social Media*). My autism was running high in those days, I still had much to learn after nearly two decades of arrested development, and I’m still a *work-in-progress*, as are most of us. Something clicked during those years, I discovered what it took *for me* to become a talented actor, and this book is a guide for you to do the same, though your results may vary—as well they should.

My ‘cohorts’ and I received three years of acting training, movement and voice. Some of my colleagues went on to professional careers in NYC, where they actually got paid, and I went on to seventeen years as a *mostly* unpaid professional, with a two-page resumé. Looking back on my time at the ASDS/NSD, some of my best moments came during the tapings for *Inside the Actors Studio*, hosted by James Lipton.

**A View from Within**

Have to be careful here, because James Lipton wrote a book called “Inside *Inside*,” and I have no desire to get hit with potential copyright infringement. I haven’t read that book, this section is a recollection of my experiences, and I’ll keep it relatively brief. My first experience with *Inside* was the interview with **Barbra Streisand**, which was fantastic, except for the fact that she kept fidgeting with the collar of her turtle-neck. I am often distracted by movement, especially back in 2003, so I remember almost nothing of the interview, except that Barbra engaged well with James Lipton. I was present for many interviews, except the end of 2005 and into 2006, because after the ASDS went to Pace University, we of the New School weren’t welcome in their auditorium. We had to go through a bureaucracy to get in, and as I recall, a class-action lawsuit.

**Hugh Jackman**

Arriving early at Tishman Auditorium, I was the first person in line (queue, if you’re a Brit or an Aussie) and was delighted when Hugh Jackman and Deborra-Lee Furness entered the building. Hugh was magnetic during the interview, his trademark, and then came the Q & A. Sitting three rows behind Deborra-Lee, who was seated in the first row, I prepared to ask my question. Take note: I mispronounced the name of actor Dougray Scott, saying “DUG-ray” instead of “DOO-gray.” It’s also important to note that at the time, Hugh was almost unknown in the United States, despite his brilliant performance in the London revival of *Oklahoma!* When Dougray Scott had to honor his commitments to *Mission Impossible II*, one of director Bryan Singer’s people suggested Hugh for *X-Men* — a perfect choice, obviously.

“Hello, Hugh, my name is Tom. (Hugh looks at my 6’ 6” frame, standing in Doctor Marten’s boots—6’ 8”—and says, “Whoa, maybe I should stand up!” The audience laughs.) “After Dougray Scott was called back to do reshoots of *Mission Impossible II*, due to the success of the *Matrix*, you got the call to play the *Wolverine*. Yet, there were people close to you who said, ‘Don’t do it; don’t let an American comic book movie become your first Hollywood film.’ You made the movie and here we are. My question is, are you better at keeping your own councel when choosing roles, or do you entertain the advice of others?” Hugh looks at me with an even countenance and says, “*Look, mate, you take the roles that come your way, and you never look over your shoulder.*” That’s it, nothing more; passed the mic on to the next person. I had practiced the question several times that day, after doing online research the previous night. How was I supposed to know that Deborra-Lee would sit three rows in front of me? Had I wanted to get barred from future interviews, I would have said, “Happy *wife*; happy *life*, right?” in an Aussie dialect. Seeing Deborra-Lee in front of me, knowing that she was the one who suggested that Hugh pick another first Hollywood film, I should have said, “What was it like working with Kate Beckinsale?” Would that have been better? Probably.

**Angelina Jolie**

Sitting house right, in the third row of Tishman, Angie took the stage and I was smitten. She really is *that* gorgeous. Jim addressed her as Angelina, and she told him that in the business she was known simply as *Angie*. She talked about the movies she had made, including the one she was promoting, *Mr. and Mrs. Smith*, with demigod Brad Pitt (a look-alike for my late uncle Clark), and she discussed her adoptive son, Maddox. I, too, am an adopted son, so my interest was piqued. Then came the Q & A.

“Hello, Angie, my name is Tom. I’m a … second year actor.” Had to think about it, still smitten. “A few years ago, you were quoted in *Rolling Stone*, saying that you were waiting for someone, ‘man or woman,’ to ‘reel you in, tie you down, tame you—make a woman out of you.’ *It would seem that perhaps your son Maddox does that for you* (an adlib), so I’m wondering—have you found the essence of those ideas in the body of your work?” Angie looks out at the audience and says, “Have I found the essence of those ideas in the body of my work? What a *great question!*” She leans forward towards the packed auditorium and says, “By the way, I’m still looking for that person!” The audience cheers, I still have the mic. “I’m … thirty-six.” Angie turns to face me, smiles, and flips her hair behind her left ear. I hold her gaze with mine and I melt, but with *composure*. It’s what Brad or my uncle would have done. She went on to answer my question, but I don’t remember any of it, I was far too proud of my success—notably the hair flip.

Two of my colleagues came up to me after the interview, and one, Cris, congratulated me for the question, and my other colleague, Rob, told me, “Eh, it was kind of weird.” Rob was one of our *James Dean-like* actors, or perhaps David Duchovny, and didn’t like anyone upstaging him. I’ve had three lucid dreams of Angie in the past two decades—two, as her co-star in a Hollywood film, and in the third she was my director. *If only!*

**Charlize Theron**

Charlize is 5’ 10” and wore heels that night, getting her close to my height. She answered questions about her South African heritage, the proper pronunciation of her last name, getting rid of her accent, and how her mother had to shoot her father to save their lives, when Charlize was fifteen. Then came the Q & A.

My colleagues inundated Charlize with questions like, “What was it like working with Keanu Reeves?” “What was it like working with Al Pacino?” Her answers were thoughtful, especially the one on Pacino, that he tried something new on each take during the filming of *Devil’s Advocate*, but I couldn’t take it anymore! After being handed the mic, I threw out the question I had practiced and said, “Hello, Charlize, my name is Tom. What would your colleagues say it’s like working with *you*?” Standing, I looked down at the person who had asked about either Pacino or Reeves, who met my glance, and handed the mic to my left at the same time. Was that toxic masculinity? Probably.

Charlize was taken aback, undoubtedly prepared for another, “What was it like to work with \[insert actor or director\],” and engaged a moment of self-reflection. I don’t remember her words, I was far too proud of myself for the question, and to my colleagues and the audience in attendance, *you’re welcome*.

**Morgan Freeman**

Jamie Foxx had been interviewed maybe two weeks earlier, promoting his new movie, *Ray*, where he discussed being raised by his grandparents, notably his grandmother, and that it “takes a village.” His grandmother also had recently died, and telling the story brought Jamie to tears. During the interview with Jim, Morgan made a comment about being raised by a village, among other topics. Then came the Q & A.

“Hello, Morgan, my name is Tom.” (Morgan, sitting in a director’s chair, says, “My, you’re a *tall* one!” The audience laughs.) “Jamie Foxx was here recently, and he spoke about being ‘raised by a village.’ It seems that being raised by a village has distinct advantages, what was it like for you?” Morgan went on to speak about visibility and accountability, something that had been lacking in my own upbringing. Morgan’s gravitas, from the first moment to the last, could have shattered a mountain, and I was grateful for his answer.

**Jennifer Connelly**

Jennifer was the crush of my teen years (along with Wynona Ryder), with her performances in *Once Upon A Time In America*, *Creepers*, and *Labyrinth*; then as an adult in *The Rocketeer*, *Mulholland Falls*, and *Dark City*. Jennifer talked about her movies, and she and Jim spent a fair amount of time on her Oscar for *A Beautiful Mind*, starring Russell Crowe. Then came the Q & A!

I was reaching for the mic when Jim told the audience that Jennifer had to leave stage to nurse her newborn. I don’t think she came back, but I don’t remember. I do remember that I was going to sing *As The World Falls Down*, by David Bowie, in my best Bowie impression, which is quite good, but it was never to be. I also remember the question I had prepared.

“Hello, Jennifer, my name is Tom. In *Labyrinth*, Sarah goes on a journey to save her baby brother from the Goblin King. She starts as an entitled brat, but becomes a responsible young adult. In my estimation, the first true sign of this is when Hoggle gives you the peach. You say, ‘Hoggle, you’re a life saver!’ Then you say, ‘This tastes strange,’ followed by, ‘Hoggle, what have you done?’ You back up against the tree branch and say, “Everything’s dancing!” Your voice changes on that line, you sound like an adult. When did the transformation first come for you?”

I never got to ask that question, and it’s probably just as well, Jim would have likely told me to pass the mic right after the song. That same night, Jim took me aside, after Jennifer left the Q & A, and said to me, “Tom, you ask the best questions of anyone in the cohort, but your stature upstages the guest, and I will never air them on the show. But keep up the great questions.” That broke me quite a bit. I put considerable thought into each question, doing research as necessary, but the studio edit of Jennifer’s interview was upcoming, and Jim invited me personally to the session.

Jim was wearing a suit, I dressed in sports coat and slacks, and the two colleagues flanking me also dressed for the occasion. We sat quietly in reverence, as the producer’s worked their magic. At one point, Jim asked Jennifer two questions in a row, but got a better response on the second one, so he spliced the first half of the first question with the second half of the second, and used Jennifer’s answer to the second, cutting around her to create the illusion of a continuous question. It was flawless. Then came my moment.

One of the producers inserted a photo into the edit for the conversation over *A Beautiful Mind*, but placed a slide from *The Rocketeer*. Taking a deep breath, I said, “Pardon me, Jim, but that photo is from *The Rocketeer*.” The producer’s head snapped on a swivel; eyes locked on to mine. Jim said, “Tom, are you sure?” and I said, “Yes, that photo is from the moment when Jennifer takes off the fur coat given to her by Timothy Dalton, in his last act of chivalry aboard the zeppelin.” The producer pulled out a monocular to view the slide, but I could see it from my chair, the border of the slide read, “*The Rocketeer*.” Jim thanked me for the save, and I said “You’re welcome,” with as much humility as I could muster, which wasn’t much in those days.

***Sophia*****, Stage Manager**

One of my colleagues, whom I refer to as *Sophia* in *Alexander Technique*, was a stage manager for *Inside*, doing her part to keep the show running smoothly, tending to the guests’ needs. I loved that woman, despite the fact that she had little use for me, and it was a joy to watch her graciously attend to her duties. In early 2024, I had three lucid dreams of her—one where we kissed, and we both knew that it was a dream; one where we did a scene together for a class project, then broke character to profess our love for each other; and a third where we met in a coffee shoppe, after the romance ended, and I had clearly interrupted her life, preventing her from becoming the woman she is now. I awoke from the alternate timeline, heart-broken and relieved that Sophia and I never were. Sophia, if you’re reading this, I regret having wasted your counterpart’s life. You deserved better—and you got it.

**Some of the Best Moments**

My days at the ASDS/NSD were among the most formative of my life. I managed to partly close the gaps in my arrested development, but not without pain, as I alienated myself with many of my colleagues, but more on that in *Social Media*. Most of the dreams I’ve had of actors have been in the form of being co-stars with them in movies, among them—Keanu Reeves, Hugh Jackman, Hugo Weaving, Angelina Jolie, Anthony Michael Hall, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, Bradley Cooper, Wynona Ryder, and others. During an astral plane scene with Hall, we were taking a break while the cameras were being reset, and I went into an impression of his work in *Weird Science*, the scene inside the nightclub—“Fats man, let me tell you my story, man!” Anthony looked up from his mark and said with an embarrassed smile, “*You’re killing me, man!*” My dreams tend to function as explorations of possible states (multiverse) or as laboratories, but more on that in *Quantum Acting* and the chapters which follow it.

Despite the late-stage growing pains, and the fact that I never made it to Hollywood, and nearly made it to Broadway three times, I cherish my memories of graduate school—the opportunities seized and the ones that escaped me. During a workshop scene in third year, I performed a thug character, ‘Donnie’ from *American Buffalo*, in front of Ellen Barkin, who sternly reprimanded me for the effort. “Tom, you are too tall and elegant to ever get cast as a thug! You are more laconic, like Bill Hurt. If you *ever* bring another thug into this classroom, I will fail you and you will not graduate, is that understood?” “Yes, it is,” was my humiliated reply. I was expelled from six schools before the age of ten, thus I knew all about humiliation, and I handled it quite well. I’ve spent nearly fifty-seven years getting to know the man whose personality continued to develop, both in spite of the autism, and because of it. Still a *work-in-progress* to be sure.

Since my questions during the Q & A of *Inside* were never aired, this chapter has been the highlight reel. You’re welcome.",0,1766785374.0,AutisticAdults,0,0.5,False

I’m planning a solo stay in Bali from February to March and will be working remotely while I’m there.

It’s been a while since my last solo trip, and this will be my first time doing Bali alone as a digital nomad, so I’d love some insights from people who’ve stayed longer there.

Would love recommendations on:

• Best areas to stay for a longer nomad-style trip (walkable, good cafés, decent internet)

• Coffee shops or cafés that are comfortable for working a few hours

• Nature spots / rice fields / quiet views to unwind after work

• Beaches that are more chill than party-heavy

• Affordable food spots (especially local food — bonus points for good babi guling that’s not overhyped 👀)

• Money-saving tips for staying 1–2 months in Bali

• What to pack / what to wear for a longer stay + remote work

I’m also interested in experiencing Nyepi while in Bali — for those who’ve stayed during Nyepi, would you recommend it as a solo nomad?

Lastly, any tips on meeting people organically while working remotely in Bali?

(Coworking spaces, gyms, cafés, communities, etc.)

1pwfsjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1pwfsjn/a_different_kind_of_relationship/,A different kind of relationship,"I wonder what the initial human/Vulcan interactions would've been like if they hadn't stumbled across us soon after WW3, but instead during a time of relative prosperity. 

Think about what we could offer them:

It wouldn't be surprising to find that some of the products we would consider inconsequential, would be viewed as ‘hot-ticket’ items by the Vulcans. Amongst some of the more mundane items are board games like Monopoly, Pictionary, and Scrabble, which offered the logically-minded Vulcans a way to test their creativity. Video games, both single-player and online multi-player, especially those that had been developed with both human and Vulcan mythology and folklore characters in mind, would be snapped up the moment they went on the market. Granted, the online community would have to wait a while until the Vulcan High Command was ‘urged’ by their eager general populace to offer subspace communication relay technology with Earth.

Trading cards like Pokemon, Star Wars Unlimited, and Magic the Gathering would see a whole new group of youngsters getting excited over them. Hand-held puzzles like the Rubic’s Cube, Jenga, or those wooden ball escape puzzles become incredibly popular to our newest neighbors. Children and teenage Vulcans’ awed reactions to comic books, manga, pulp novels and magazines. (According to some online sources, the concept of these items never really went beyond the inspirational or conformity messages that their leaders passed off as ‘learning materials'). Another item that has the potential of creating chaos in an orderly society are those toys that mimic whatever they hear like the Furbies; those cute and fuzzy creatures with the creepy stare.

I think what tickles my amusement would be seeing Vulcan parents spending time with their children poring over the Where’s Waldo books in a race to find the man first.

When you see images of Vulcan with its harsh desert-like climate, it’s not difficult to imagine that they wouldn’t have access to a variety of crops or materials. Even though they did have spices, inevitably there would have to have been some species that never evolved on their world but did on ours. For example, the spice trade is a pretty lucrative market here on Earth but frankly, it would be shocking to see some Vulcans get positively giddy when they discovered and willing bought saffron at USD$30,000 per kilogram! Chocolates, coffee, and other beverages plus the cuisines from the cultures around the Earth (Can you picture Ambassador Soval chowing down on a slice of cheese or veggie pizza?) 

Seeds too, imagine growing up never knowing what an orange or a mango tasted like? Farms and ranches would all see an increase of off-world sales. I'm picturing some famous Vulcan chef putting out a contract of sorts offering up to what amounts to be USD$50,000 for a thousand pounds of watermelon. That’s astounding when you consider the average US farm price for watermelons in 2020 was $16.80 per cwt. The national seasonal average retail price for non-organic, red-fleshed, seeded type ranged between $0.31to $0.38 per pound, and $0.46 to $0.55 per pound for red-fleshed seedless.

Of the hard goods, lumber is another commodity that would see a tremendous upswing in prosperity. As a desert world, Vulcan doesn’t have the ability to grow sustainable forests to build homes or furniture. As a result, when they found out about Earth’s abundance, it wouldn't be a shock to see Vulcans lining up to buy things like desks, coffee tables, or even just wooden sculptures at what we would consider to be inflated prices. (I'm envisioning numerous Vulcan executives who love to brag and boast about the new hand-carved executive desk made from English Oak or Brazilian Bloodwood they had imported from Earth.)

It wasn’t just the consumable goods that would become wildly popular. When the tourist travel begins between our two worlds, the sight of the normally stoic and seemingly unflappable adult Vulcans decked out in winter clothing strapping a pair of ‘thin strips of laminated wood’ to their feet and wobbly learning how to enjoy skiing or snowboarding; it's a pretty clear indication that we have a good thing going here. The cinemas, music concerts, Comic-Con, all of the world’s various holidays, national parks and preserves, it didn’t matter; the Vulcans want to see and do it all.

So here's the general situation: I'm 19, my parents are divorced so I grew up living with my mom but would visit my dad regularly. 
He's always been difficult. I could go on for very long but basically he's a heavy drinker, always blames everyone else and never admits he's at fault and doesn't really.. care? At least that's what it seems like. And that's what this post is kind of supposed to be about. 

Soo it's Christmas. I celebrated with him and his family yesterday, got him a CD of a band he loves. He got me a mug and a book. Perfectly fine, right? I feel bad complaining about it but like.. the book is one he's had in his shelf for years and had coincidentally recently gotten a newer copy of. It's not his favourite, nor is it anything I've ever expressed interest in (in fact it is the one and only genre I never read.) The mug has a picture of us, which is cute!! except it's also from 18 years ago because that is quite literally the only picture of us where we're both happy. (Plus I don't even use mugs cause I don't drink tea/coffee) 
I know I shouldn't complain. It's a gift and I should be thankful. It's not his fault he doesn't know those things right? He doesn't live with me after all. 

Except he kind of also never paid attention. He would insist that I visit him every weekend but he'd always be drinking with friends and then be hungover so it's not like we ever did anything together. He asked me what I wanted for Christmas (a camera) and he said no. Not because of money (he's rich enough to take girlfriends on vacations like 5 times a year) but because he just.. thought it was stupid? Idk. 

There's a lot, lot more to this story and his behaviour but today I'm mostly just upset because it feels like he doesn't know me at all. He doesn't know my hobbies, or my favourite show or what I'm studying. I don't doubt that he thinks he loves me, but I think he's got a different version of me in his head. Like way different. Or just very nonspecific. I mean he loves being a dad because he'd show up to official events but I don't think he sees me or ever cared about seeing me.

1pwfrnq,https://i.redd.it/d9stedq2bm9g1.png,New Release: One More Christmas,"Hello everyone, hope you all had a wonderful Christmas! This came out a day later than I'd wished but it's out now and thankfully only a day later, this is a deeply personal time loop adventure similar to the movie ""Groundhog day"" so for those who are familiar with that movie they should find some similarities between the two although I added some variety to things.

I'm unsure if I can explain the entirety of the adventure properly so you'll have to experience it for yourself but I did take my time with it and I won't spoil anything beyond what the adventure's description already provides so as to not ruin the experience! I hope you enjoy it if you do check it out and as always I'm open to all feedbacks/suggestions.

Now I'm also sure that many are probably (quite likely even) confused by some of the attributes (primarily the ""Setting"" and ""Root Emotional Attitude"" attributes) so I shall offer some brief (or at least as brief as can be) explanations on both attributes and their drop-down options, if you're interested in the adventure but find some parts of the set-up confusing then I hope this helps clear things up, makes the choices easier and in turn improves your experience and immersion:

Setting: This is your chosen location. It defines recurring locations, weather intensity, travel options, NPC density, atmospheric tone and also influences available activities. The following are drop-down options and what they mean:

• Small Snowy Hometown: A quiet, close-knit town where you grew up — everyone knows your name, your past, and your family. Main street lined with independent shops decked in lights, a central ice-skating rink, community caroling events, and neighbours who wave whether you want them to or not. The loop amplifies familiarity: old classmates bump into you, childhood friends invite you over, gossip travels fast. Perfect for attitudes tied to family history, childhood memories, or small-town judgment. Snow falls heavily, streets are walkable, secrets are hard to keep.

• Bustling City Neighborhood: A vibrant urban district (think Brooklyn or Chicago’s Lincoln Park) — crowded holiday markets, high-rise apartments with doormen, subway access, rooftop parties, and anonymous crowds mixed with familiar local faces (barista who knows your order, street vendor etc). The loop creates endless opportunity: flashing billboards, late-night bars open on Christmas Eve, charity bell-ringers on every corner, strangers in need. 

• Quiet Suburb: Tree-lined streets of comfortable houses with big yards, cul-de-sacs decorated in competing light displays, families hosting open houses, kids building snowmen. Everyone drives; the local community center hosts events, and neighbours drop by with cookies. The loop emphasises domestic pressure: invitations to potlucks, kids asking you to judge snow-fort contests, couples walking dogs together. 

• Coastal Off-Season Tourist Town: A seaside resort town gone sleepy in winter — boardwalk shops mostly shuttered, a few hardy cafés open, windswept beach with frozen waves, empty vacation homes, and a small year-round community of locals. The loop brings isolation mixed with unexpected visitors: tourists stuck by snow, lonely lighthouse keeper, beachcombers, holiday pop-up events. 

• Isolated Mountain Cabin: A rented (or owned) remote cabin high in the mountains — wood stove, no cell service most of the time, nearest town a 30-minute snowy drive away. Supplies are limited, radio crackles with holiday music, windows frame endless pines and peaks. The loop strands you with minimal distractions: occasional lost hikers, a friendly ranger checking in, distant neighbours visible through binoculars. 

Each setting offers a unique experience: different NPCs whose names are also determined by the naming conventions that would be common to such locations, different approaches to your chosen attitude/flaws, different lifestyles that would be unique to such locations or set them apart from one another etc

That leads to the Root Emotional Attitude which is likely the most confusing aspect so let's get to it:

Root Emotional Attitude: This is the loop’s “target” — growth past this flaw is the only escape, how? That's your journey to find out if you can and that is the fun part. It is the primary reason for your current predicament, in other words, it is the reason why you've been kept in a time loop. This also determines certain details in the opening (and reset sequences) such as the bedroom details and opening song in your room (which yes, also includes the very much dreaded song ""All I want for Christmas is you"" from Mariah Carey), with these details being unique to your chosen attitude. This particular section is deeply detailed as it also acts as the backstory for your character and you'll soon see just how detailed it is if you stick around through the explanation of each (which I hope will be of assistance):

• Jaded Romantic: Your heart was broken on a past Christmas — an ex left you on Christmas Eve, or a proposal went disastrously wrong under the tree. Now you view holiday romance as cliché manipulation. You mock couples kissing under mistletoe, roll your eyes at love songs, and keep everyone at arm’s length with sarcasm. Your flaw is cynical emotional walls that block joy and intimacy. The loop places you in a snowy town filled with seasonal romance triggers — old flames visiting, charming strangers, office parties. The Loo will surround you with romantic triggers and potential partners, forcing repeated opportunities to stay bitter or slowly let someone in. 
Wake-up song: “Last Christmas” by Wham!. Bedroom: faded mistletoe still hanging from last year (never taken down), box of old love letters half-hidden under bed, single stocking with a hole in it.

• A Fractured Family: 
You grew up in a home that splintered years ago — parents divorced bitterly on Christmas Eve when you were young, or a sibling cut contact after a blowout fight during the holidays. Ever since, you avoid family gatherings entirely, spending Christmas alone with takeout and Netflix. You tell yourself it’s easier than the inevitable arguments. Your flaw: emotional avoidance and refusal to be emotionally vulnerable. You reject invitations, make excuses, and secretly believe connection always ends in pain. The loop traps you in your hometown with family nearby, forcing repeated chances to skip, confront, or rebuild bridges. 
Wake-up song: “I’ll Be Home for Christmas” (classic Bing Crosby version). Bedroom: sparsely decorated, no holiday touches, packed suitcase by the door (as if ready to leave town), family photos turned face-down or removed.

• The Relentless Perfectionist: Childhood Christmases never matched the “perfect” ideal you saw in movies and read in books. Now you over-plan, overspend, and micromanage every detail — gifts must be flawless, decorations magazine-worthy, dinner gourmet. Anything less feels like failure, making you critical and stressed. When things inevitably go wrong (burnt turkey, delayed flights), you become irritable and critical. Core flaw: control and perfectionism that robs yourself and others of spontaneous joy. The loop guarantees imperfections (delayed flights, burnt food, mismatched gifts) and watches whether you double down on control or learn to laugh and let go.
Wake-up song: “It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year” (upbeat Andy Williams version). Bedroom: meticulously organised, colour-coordinated decorations, to-do list on nightstand with “Christmas checklist” items already half-checked in permanent ink.

• The Hollow Workaholic: Work always came first. You’ve missed countless Christmases canceling plans for deadlines, promotions, or “just one more email.” Colleagues call you unstoppable; family calls you absent. Deep down, you fear that without achievement you’re unworthy of love. Your flaw: selfishness masked as ambition, valuing productivity over people. The loop strands you snowed-in with family or friends you’ve neglected, phone signal conveniently dead. The loop removes work distractions and strands you with your neglected loved ones.
Wake-up song: “Jingle Bell Rock” (cheerful but tinny phone-ringtone version). Bedroom: laptop open on desk with work emails, unopened gift boxes stacked neatly (bought online, never wrapped), phone charging with 47 unread family messages.

• The Grief Frozen Heart: A loved one died near Christmas years ago. Ever since, you shut down during the season — no decorations, no music, forced smiles through obligations. You believe celebrating would betray their memory or invite fresh pain. Your flaw: emotional suppression and isolation, denying yourself and others shared comfort. The loop places you in the town where memories are strongest, with gentle reminders everywhere. Growth means allowing grief to surface naturally, sharing stories, accepting comfort, and discovering that joy can coexist with sorrow.
Wake-up song: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” (melancholy Judy Garland version). Bedroom: bare except for one small, dusty ornament from childhood on the windowsill, curtains half-drawn, faint scent of pine from a long-dead wreath.

• Holiday Cynic: You’ve grown openly bitter and dismissive of Christmas — seeing it as commercialised hype, forced cheer, or meaningless ritual. You scoff at traditions, grumble at carols, and spread negativity to others. Deep down, you’ve lost touch with wonder and generosity. Your flaw: general grumpiness and rejection of holiday spirit. The loop immerses you in cheerful community events and enthusiastic neighbours. 
Wake-up song: “Blue Christmas” (Elvis Presley, moody version). Bedroom: absolutely no decorations, stack of unopened holiday cards in the trash bin, blinds fully closed despite snow outside, half-empty bottle of scotch on the nightstand.

• Festive Grinch: You actively ruin Christmas for others — complaining loudly, refusing to participate, deliberately dampening cheer with sarcasm or outright sabotage. Deep down, your own unhappiness makes you resent others’ joy. Flaw: selfish spite and intentional negativity. The loop will place you in the center of community celebrations where your actions will directly affect vulnerable or kind people. 
Wake-up song: “You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch” (Thurl Ravenscroft). Bedroom: stolen outdoor decorations piled in corner, “Bah Humbug” sign on wall, empty coal sack by the unused fireplace.

• Holiday Prankster: You treat Christmas as an opportunity for chaos — elaborate pranks, sabotaging events, stealing the spotlight with stunts. You claim it’s “fun,” but deep down you use mischief to avoid genuine connection or emotion. Flaw: destructive chaos masking fear of sincerity. The loop places you in situations where pranks may backfire spectacularly or hurt others, forcing confrontation with consequences. 
Wake-up song: “Jingle Bells” (up-tempo, mischievous instrumental version). Bedroom: prank supplies scattered (whoopee cushions, fake snow spray), half-eaten stolen cookies, tangled Christmas lights used as “trap” string.

• Emotionally Detached: You’ve never let yourself love or care deeply for anyone — romantic or otherwise. Family and friends repeatedly tried to pull you into relationships or traditions, setting up dates or inviting you to gatherings, but you coldly shut them down, prioritising independence and solitude. Deep down, you believe giving time or affection to others only creates obligation, disappointment, or loss of freedom. Core flaw: broad emotional detachment and refusal to invest in any human connection. The loop fills your day with people — old friends reaching out, lonely neighbours, kind strangers, children looking for attention — who genuinely want your company and care.
Wake-up song: “All I Want for Christmas Is You” (Mariah Carey — ironic considering the context). Bedroom: impeccably tidy but starkly impersonal, no photos of others anywhere, calendar completely blank except self-focused notes, single coffee mug and plate by an otherwise empty kitchen table, locked journals or ""do not disturb"" sign on door.

• Serial Charmer: You’ve made a lifestyle of charming people — seducing partners for sex, money, status, ego boosts or fleeting thrills, then discarding them coldly once you’ve gotten what you wanted. Christmas becomes prime hunting season with parties and vulnerable hearts. Family and friends have long stopped trying to set you up for dates after you mocked or ghosted their efforts. Deep down, you fear genuine attachment would mean losing control or being truly seen and rejected. Core flaw: manipulative romantic exploitation and refusal of real emotional commitment. Loop surrounds you with attractive, kind, or vulnerable people offering sincere connection (no strings). Wake-up song: “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” (playful but ambiguous classic version). Bedroom: scattered cologne/perfume bottles and grooming products everywhere, drawer of unused items-that-shall-not-be-named due to 18+ reasons and “trophies” (jewelry, phone numbers on scraps), mirror covered in flirty selfies or past conquest notes, wardrobe of sharp party outfits ready to go.

• Christmas Scammer:
You run elaborate holiday cons — fake charity drives, phishing “gift card” schemes, selling counterfeit luxury items, or posing as a desperate traveller needing help. You see the season’s goodwill as easy marks. Deep down, you distrust genuine generosity and believe everyone is ultimately selfish, so taking first is survival. Core flaw: deceitful greed and lack of compassion for victims. The loop puts you face-to-face with trusting, vulnerable people (elderly donors, excited kids, struggling families) whose lives your scams would devastate, forcing growth through understanding guilt and consequences of actions. 
Wake-up song: “Feliz Navidad” (cheerful but deeply ironic José Feliciano version). Bedroom: multiple burner phones charging, stacks of fake charity flyers and forged documents, laptop open to scam email templates or dark-web listings, envelope of cash from “previous” cons tucked under mattress, fake ID cards in a hidden drawer.

• Serial Hoarder: You compulsively hoard holiday items year-round — stealing decorations from public displays, grabbing excessive free samples, stockpiling gifts you never give, or buying mountains of discounted Christmas goods you don’t need. You tell yourself it’s “preparation,” but deep down it’s a way to feel secure and in control amid emotional emptiness. Core flaw: possessive greed and isolation through material obsession, denying yourself and others the joy of giving or sharing. The loop overwhelms you with abundant holiday generosity around you (community giveaways, neighbours offering food/decor, charity drives) while your hoarded space becomes increasingly meaningless. 
Wake-up song: “The Christmas Song” (Nat King Cole — warm contrast to cold hoarding). Bedroom: barely navigable paths between towering stacks of unopened Christmas boxes, tangled lights, unused ornaments, expired holiday food tins, multiple artificial trees still in boxes, locked closets bulging with more stockpiles.

With all that said I suppose I'll end there, have fun if you do check it out and if you've made it this far in my post I assume you're interested so my best advice (if you choose to play it) is to simply have fun— the adventure is one of self-discovery but it will have it's naturally arising comedic moments and even moments of romance amidst the drama, however, it should noted that you cannot *force* the loop to come to an end— the end must be genuine.

1pwfr5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pwfr5e/stuck_on_what_machine_to_get_1500/,Stuck on what machine to get [$1500],"Right now we have been using a Cafe by GE (an old version of the Cafe Affetto I believe) and it has stopped working. We're looking into getting a new machine to replace it and want something more reliable that we won't have to replace in another 2-3 years. Our machine is our most used appliance in our home, we work from home and have multiple drinks a day.

I'm looking for some advice on what machine to get. I would like to say I narrowed it down the the following choices, but every time I feel like that I come across something else that makes me second guess myself.

We care a bit more about convenience than getting the best possible quality so we've been debating a super automatic, but I only drink milk drinks and am concerned they may not be hot enough.

Right now, our machine goes from bean to cup but does not do any milk drinks or anything like that. Just grinds the beans to shot, portions, and brews the shot.

We are currently between:

Gaggia Accademia - We REALLY like that it is a super automatic that also has the option of a manual steam wand, but I can't find many reviews on it and am a little worried about spending that much on it if I don't LOVE the coffee coming out. We also really like the steam cleaning of the milk jug spout after each drink. We don't love that the current sale is only from whole latte love and their return policy seems questionable at best.

Ninja Cafe Luxe Pro - This seems to have a lot of really good features for the price point, but it's a bit more manual than we have now and worry we may regret not getting more of an auto that we don't have to worry about cleaning after every shot. I also can't figure out if the reviewers for this are all paid promoters. I've seen a lot of comments and posts about having to send units back, so it has me worried.

Kitchenaid kf8 - We keep seeing this one being compared to the jura z10. I have a couple buddies who have the jura and rave about it, but that's out of my price range. The kf8 seems to be comparable for half the price? I also can't figure out if all these ""rave"" reviews on the kf8 are paid promoters. The lack of a manual steam wand on here has me hesitant as if the milk drinks aren't hot enough I can't really do much.

I'm also open to other suggestions, but I am NOT looking for a separate grinder. I am looking for something that at the very least does something like the Ninja that will portion and grind each shot for you all in one machine",1,1766785022.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I’m planning a solo trip to Bali from February to March, and it’s been a while since my last solo travel. I’ve also never done Bali alone before, so I’d love to hear your tips and recommendations 🤍

Would love advice on:

• Beaches (swimmable / chill / not too party-heavy)

• Sawah / nature spots

• Places to just enjoy Bali views (sunrise, sunset, quiet spots)

• Money-saving tips for staying longer in Bali

• Babi guling (or any pork dishes that are genuinely good and not overrated 👀)

• Coffee shops — especially cozy ones for reading or working

• What to bring / what to wear for a longer stay

— I’m also really interested in experiencing Nyepi in Bali.

Do you recommend staying during Nyepi as a solo traveler?

Lastly, any tips on making friends in Bali?

Besides hobbies or the gym (though I’m planning to try a gym too).

Thank you so much in advance! 🤍",1,1766784963.0,BaliTravelTips,1,1.0,False

1pwfoyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1pwfoyl/aio_for_wanting_autonomy_on_the_holidays/,AIO for wanting autonomy on the holidays?,"I'm like really really furious right now, but maybe I'm really antisocial? Please help me to decide. Sorry if I'm rambling I'm still pretty worked up after an argument and english is not my first language.

I have to admit, I don't have a family on my own for a very long time and in the last 10 years or so I had full autonomy over my life and free time. I'm pretty independent and can only rest actively.  
My boyfriend of 3 years is a people pleaser. At Christmas he usually goes to his brother's apartment and spend the holidays with him and his wife. They always do what they want to do and he just tags along, without any plans on his own.

Knowing this - and having the pleasure of spending a whole week at the beach this summer doing absolutely nothing because they didn't want to do anything at all -, when my boyfriend told me he wanted me to go there with him for Christmas, I was vary.   
He's on vacation for 3 weeks while I only got a break between 23 and 29. I'm attending university and working full time so I need to be very strict about my free time and I already gave away almost all of my whole year worth of PTO wasting time with his family instead of doing things I love.  
  
I agreed to go there with him at the 23rd but with the stipulation that I'll go and have a little trip on my own to a tourist city nearby at the 26th and come home on my own instead of staying one more day and having a family visit with them.

He immediately went behind my back and told my plans to his brother who offered to just drive me there. I declined politely and later changed my mind completely because I realized that shops won't be open during the holidays and I wanted to drink a coffee and meet the locals etc., so I wanted to save the location for later and told them so.

Updated my plans to go to a christmas market before coming home on my own. They also changed plans and told me that they would go to their father's at the 26th instead and because they cut short the time and already planned a whole day family visit for the 25th, I have to change my mind yet again and drop my solo travel plan altogether.

Anyway, we arrived there, did shopping, watched a movie they wanted to watch, ate what they wanted to eat and slept when they wanted to sleep because there's no guest bedroom, we stayed at the living room. Woke up when they woke up, had breakfast when they had and then they just told me that we'll go visit my tourist location and didn't gave me an option to decline.   
We went there, walked around for an hour and left. I told them that I would prefer a coffee and a cake at a place they know was open but they just didn't stop anywhere :)  
It was literally what I wanted to avoid at all cost.  
  
They told us later that we could play board games, I must've looked too excited because we just never did.  
Bro was sick btw and infected us. At the 25th we were so sick that the family visit never happened, they left us and went to have lunch with them instead, then came back and again, we just did what they wanted, when they wanted, like children. And I stayed silent and polite because I knew it was important to my boyfriend and knew that the next day I'll be free.  
  
26th arrived and they just slept in then boyfriend's brother told us that their father asked them to stay at home if they're sick so without even consulting me, they decided that they'll just gonna drop our already paid bus tickets and come get us home by car and stay the night over here.  
On the route home they decided to visit the cinema and go to the market tomorrow morning already talking like we're all gonna go. They never asked us what we wanted to do in our own home lol Also I wanted to study on my way back and couldn't because I've got motion sickness if I try to read in a car.  
  
I declined and told them that I wanted to be at home w my cat. Now I'm in my own bed, yet still can't make myself comfortable because they'll soon arrive from the cinema and they already hogged this night and half of the next day. I literally only have 2 days left to rest or do something meaningful from my whole christmas break. I feel like they stripped me from my autonomy completely and decided every single thing over my head while I asked some freedom months before we even arrived there. They just trampled through all of my plans and boundaries on the go, like they were nothing.

Tried to explain it to my boyfriend but he just told me that I'm antisocial, he just can't make me happy (?) and that next time I won't have to come.  
I would be glad to miss this misery to be honest lol

I tried so hard to make my boyfriend comfortable while maintaining at least some of my boundaries, or at least trying to feel like an adult - 35 btw -, making adult choices but now I don't even have a say in my own home for a day.  
And I'm angry.

Might be a bit of a long shot, but I figured I’d ask anyway. I’m keen to get into bouldering as a new hobby in the new year and was wondering if anyone would be open to taking a newbie along for a session or two at Urban Climb or 9 Degrees? 

I’m 38F, reasonably active (though zero bouldering experience) and mostly just looking to learn the basics, get comfortable, and ideally even meet some people socially through it as well. Even at the friendliest place, turning up solo as a beginner can feel a bit intimidating, so thought I’d put it out there! 🤞🏻

Not expecting coaching or anything, just someone (or a small group) happy to climb, give a few pointers, and make it a bit less scary than walking in alone!.. Totally understand beginners aren’t everyone’s vibe, but happy to shout a coffee after, bring good banter/have a laugh while falling off walls repeatedly… Thanks legends!

1pwfma6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout4Mods/comments/1pwfma6/issues_with_sim_settlement_2_mod_in_storywealth/,Issues with Sim Settlement 2 mod in StoryWealth collection,"Hi!

Help! I've been googling, searching forums, and troubleshooting this for three days now to no avail. I've posted on relevant Nexus discussions and no one seems to help there, it's just a flood of other issues. So I'm hoping perhaps there may be some helpful and knowledgeable people in the community over here.

I've done a clean install of F4, fresh updated install of the StoryWealth mod collection off of Nexus according to the pages instructions, and am using a fresh new save.

When playing through the first quest 'Laying Foundations' to start Sim Settlements 2, the Stranger asks you to build a 2x2 settlement plot. I do, he has a quick dialogue, then walks to the middle of the plot and is supposed to start constructing it. That is where he just stands there and freezes. The script doesn't execute properly. Using the cheat menu to skip the main quest just lands me in the same issue with agricultural plots in the second quest. I'm hoping this might be a load order issue? Does anyone have any insights to this? Any insight is appreciated.

1pwflk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/thecampaigntrail/comments/1pwflk5/good_for_me_the_definitive_edition/,GOOD FOR ME: The Definitive Edition,"Hiya fellas — how’s everyone holding up? Hopefully you’ve been winning a few campaigns against Pat Buchanan and keeping Hillary happy with universal healthcare.

With the year winding down and the community dropping mod after mod, I wanted to announce the **Definitive Edition of** ***Good For Me***.

This update has been a long time in the making — pretty much ever since I released the last version — and it’ll be the one that closes the book on this project. It was my first mod, and it’s given me an equal mix of fun, stress, and work… in the best way.

*What’s new in the Good For Me Definitive Edition?*

https://preview.redd.it/n7cltb0n8m9g1.png?width=1471&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bd72ad3a4e3bc04acb2c3b022b9085c2e17ac47

* A huge expansion for the game’s secret character: **good ol’** ***Tricky Dick***\*\*.\*\* After failing to make Edward Brooke your running mate, Nixon takes control of the party and gets one last real shot at the presidency… or a third straight defeat. This isn’t a short side-route like before: the new Nixon path includes **four new running mates**, **a new opponent**, and **multiple endings**.
* Secrets, alternate branches, and a small “mini-game” built into Nixon’s route. We won’t spoil the specifics here, but let’s just say Nixon won’t be playing as clean as Lindsay.

[Bitter still](https://preview.redd.it/vbpnly749m9g1.png?width=1409&format=png&auto=webp&s=7920de416fe1522a1735a463234e5317a39e9445)

* Thanks to the kind comments you sent me on Reddit and Discord, the mod now has **four additional questions** — not just for Nixon, but across all three Lindsay routes (Dole, Nixon and the succesful Brooke). That brings the total from 21 to 25. On top of that, a few existing questions have been reworked so they offer multiple answer options instead of just one, which should add a lot more variety from run to run.
* More depth for the Dole and Nixon routes vs. Henry Jackson. These paths now include *three running-mate* options for Henry Jackson, each with real impact.

On top of all that, there are cosmetic and quality-of-life improvements: a **searchString highlight system** (the “glowing words” with extra descriptions), **Chartenhancer**, soundtrack swaps for better atmosphere, bug fixes, and some code cleanup to make the mod run smoother.

[Is Lindsay too Woke?](https://preview.redd.it/odsh04yo9m9g1.png?width=1457&format=png&auto=webp&s=32ce4d4ff8e4b06c34b235226ef95d79000e8367)

I’m genuinely proud of how this turned out, and I can’t wait for you to play it. I do not Hope that is goes toe-to-toe with the biggest mods of the season — but I hope this Little Big ~~Man~~ Mod earns a spot in your memory (and maybe your favorites tab).

See you on **December 30th**.

*(Well — December 30th is when I’ll open the pull request. After that, it’s up to how long approvals take.)*",48,1766784632.0,thecampaigntrail,7,1.0,False
1pwfjnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pwfjnr/sfthe_keene_lattice/,[SF]The Keene Lattice,"Maggie didn’t notice the time until the building went quiet.

The campus physics lab had emptied hours ago, leaving her alone with the hum of the chilled water loop and the faint tick of cooling metal heat sinks. The containment rig sat in the center of the test bay, a ribbed steel frame wrapped with coils and sensor nodes, cables spilling out across the concrete floor.

“Last one,” she muttered, rubbing at the crust in her eyes as she keyed in the sequence.

Field geometry model, stable. Power draw, at the upper limit but within tolerance. Error margins flickered amber, then settled green. On the monitor, her equations stacked over the CAD model of the device.

She armed the test. The relay bank clacked in the control cabinet as capacitors came online.

“Come on,” she said. “Just give me thirty seconds.”

The countdown hit zero. The rig shivered as current slammed into the coils. Air pressure in the room shifted. The fluorescent tubes above buzzed louder, light warping at the edges of her vision.

Lines bent subtly inward, as if the room were trying to fold around an invisible point. A pen she’d left on the cart near the frame rolled uphill.

Then the breaker tripped.

The world snapped back into place as every light in the lab went out. The hum died, leaving a sharp, ringing silence. Somewhere in the building, a transformer let out a muffled thud.

“Shit.”

Emergency strips along the floor flicked to life, bathing everything in dim amber. Maggie sat there a moment, hands still resting on the key pads heart racing. She pushed back from the console, the chair’s wheels squeaking in the quiet.

On the tablet beside the monitor, the last readings froze mid‑spike. The power draw had leapt far beyond projected values in the final fraction of a second.

The final result of her experiment was a building‑wide power outage and a more than likely irate facilities manager in the morning. She shut down what she could manually, checking the rig for heat or damage, then grabbed her bag.

By the time she stumbled back to her cramped office, the clock on her monitor read 4:17 a.m.

She curled up on the dusty old couch beneath the whiteboard, still dense with integrals and diagrams, set her phone alarm for two hours, and drifted off

The alarm buzzed against her skull. Maggie sat up too fast and the room tilted, her eyes gummy, her neck screaming in protest from being smashed against the arm of the couch. Yesterday’s clothes were wrinkled and smelled faintly of coolant.

She splashed water on her face in the bathroom down the hall, then followed habit more than thought down to the ground floor café, guided by the scent of burned coffee and baked sugar.

The line was mercifully short. She tugged her hair into a loose knot, blinking at the chalkboard menu without taking any of it in.

“Rough night?”

The voice came from just behind her. Maggie looked back. The man behind her, one hand stuffed in the pocket of his work jacket, the other wrapped around a to‑go cup. He had a few days’ worth of stubble softening a strong jaw, dark circles under his eyes that mirrored her own, and a maintenance badge clipped to his chest: BEN HART, FACILITIES.

“Power techs love you physicist grad students.” he added. “Keeps us employed.”

Maggie winced. “That bad?”

“Campus grid logged a spike big enough to trip half the building,” Ben said. “Security report says ‘possible equipment malfunction in sublevel lab three.’”

“That’s… oddly specific.”

He shrugged. “They write it like that when they don’t want to blame anyone.”

She huffed a laugh despite herself. “I prefer ‘historic breakthrough’ on the form, personally.”

“You the historic breakthrough?”

“I was trying to be.” She shifted the strap of her bag. “Containment fields.”

“Like force fields?” Ben said. “Or like lasers and things?”

“No.” Maggie said. ""More like the stabilization of gravitational rifts. I have a theory that if you can essentially capture a black hole it can be studied closer. If I could just get the electricity in this facility to behave on my behalf I might stand a chance at completing my experiment in conjunction with a particle collider one day.”

He caught the flicker of irritation in her voice, not at him but seemingly at her work. He didn’t press, just nodded toward the counter.

“Tell you what, Dr. Historic Breakthrough, I’ll buy your coffee as an apology on behalf of the power grid.”

“You don’t have to.”

“I kind of do,” he said. “The guy who runs the breaker room was swearing about ‘those damn science projects’ at five a.m. There may have also been some name calling. Buying coffee for the culprit feels like balancing karma.”

""Name calling? Like what kind of name calling.""

""The kind that would upset my mother if I repeated it.""

The barista glanced up, waiting. Maggie sighed.

“Fine. Large black coffee and a dozen donut holes.”

The next few weeks blurred into a rhythm: days split between the lab and her office; nights that stretched a little too long; text messages from Ben that lured her out of the building with promises of real food.

He’d swing by the lab at odd hours under the pretense of checking the breaker panel. Sometimes he actually did. Other times he leaned in the doorway, watching her coax the new, reinforced rig through its startup sequence.

“Explain it to me like I’m an idiot,” he said once, arms folded, gaze on the coils.

“You’re not an idiot.” Maggie replied

“Flattery noted. I still don’t know what I’m looking at.”

She tapped a schematic on the screen. “Think of it as a net. You throw it over a region of space so that certain things, fields, forces, particles have to behave inside it. They can’t propagate the way they want to. It’s not a wall. More like… rules that only apply in there.”

“And last time, the rules blew a fuse.”

“Last time, I underestimated how much juice the rules needed.” she said. “I fixed it.”

He raised an eyebrow. “You sure?”

“No,” she admitted, and he smiled.

Later that night they grabbed beers at the dive bar four blocks from campus. He told stories about growing up in a town where the tallest building was the grain silo. She talked about the first time she saw a pair of iron filings dance inside a prototype field, how it felt like watching gravity forget itself.

On one of those nights, he walked her home through a slow drizzle, hands shoved deep in his pockets, shoulders hunched.

“So,” he said. “You gonna blow the lights again tonight?”

“I upgraded the power regulation,” she replied. “In theory, no but I know who to call if I do.”

“In theory.” He smirked.

The email came on a Thursday afternoon.

DR. MAGGIE KEENE – FUNDING OPPORTUNITY / COLLABORATION REQUEST.

The sender’s address resolved to a research foundation she’d never heard of, with a website full of stock photos and vague mission statements about “advanced energy solutions” and “environmental containment technologies.” The message itself was flattering without being specific, full of references to her thesis work and recent preprint.

At the bottom, a note: A representative will be in touch and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss your work in person.

She almost deleted it. She knew what it was like to deal with corporations. Then she looked at her current budget spreadsheet, at the highlighted red cells under EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT, and sighed.

The liaison showed up precisely at 10 a.m. the following Tuesday: mid‑forties, well‑cut suit, an institutional smile that never quite reached his eyes.

“Call me Harris,” he said, shaking her hand. “Your paper on localized field stability made the rounds in our organization. We’re very interested in what you’re doing here.”

“Your organization is…?”

“A private consortium,” he said easily. “We support research that has direct practical applications. Containment, particularly, is a field of… growing interest.”

He walked the perimeter of the rig, hands clasped behind his back, gaze lingering on the coils, the reinforced breaker panels, the new grounding straps.

“You’ve achieved impressive results on a minimal budget,” Harris said. “But this kind of work shouldn’t be constrained by institutional politics and grant cycles. Imagine what you could do with a dedicated lab. Clean power. Custom hardware. A team.”

“And the strings?” Maggie asked.

He turned suddenly toward her. His face changed, but remained the same. As if he had dropped a vail. There was a change in his voice too. It seemed sharper. More to a point.

“I knew you were a smart girl Maggie."" He replied. ""You see, some of my colleagues said this meeting was pointless. That a poor grad student such as yourself would beg for funding, but I said 'No, Maggie's a smart girl'. You asked about strings so here it is, ours are simple, you pursue your research. With any success we get first access to your designs. You of course still maintain all credit and can do what you will with your creation... after we get a look at it first.”

“And if I say no?”

“Then you keep fighting with university procurement for another year,” he said. “By then, someone else may have solved the same problems you’re facing. Less elegantly, of course.”

He met her eyes, and something flickered there: not threat, exactly, but a sense of inevitability.

“We’re offering you time and tools, Miss Keene,” he said. “What you do with them is up to you.”

Two years later, the rig she’d built with their money hummed like a living thing.

It no longer resembled the cobbled‑together frame in the campus basement. This one sat in a private facility an hour outside the city, where the walls were thick, the air always a little too clean, and security badges changed colors every three months.

They called it a containment lattice in internal memos, which made her want to crawl out of her skin. Just another thing that aggravated her about working there. If she was the one working the long hours and putting in all the hard work it was only fair that she get to name the device, but since she hadn’t, containment lattice it was.

She'd found a way to shape the field so it wrapped around irregular boundaries without collapsing, hugging surfaces no geometry textbook knew about. She’d watched test objects disappear inside and reappear unchanged, watched sensors report values that shouldn’t have been possible. Every new demo, a knock out of the park.

Harris approached her after one of these demos which just so happened to be in front of the board of executives.

""My my, you've come a long way Maggie."" He said. ""I have a request for you.""

""Oh yeah, what's that?"" She replied, her nervous system always lit up around Harris. Always on edge when he was nearby.

""What would you think about designing a Lite version of your containment lattice?"" Harris went on. ""We were thinking of something small and portable. Potentially for firefighter or maybe environmental use.""

“You’re not an environmental agency,” Maggie said.

“We contract with people who are,” he replied. “Your device can protect communities from dangerous conditions. That’s a good thing, isn’t it?”

Her skepticism showed on her face and in the quiet spaces of her mind when some of the data from “off‑site demonstrations” came back heavily redacted.

Still, she agreed.

 About a year later she had a refined and portable unit. She brought in Harris for a demonstration. As her team ran things in the lab she was in the observation deck with Harris.

""By trimming power requirements, and integrating a collapsible frame we've managed to get pretty close to what you were asking for."" Maggie explained.

The demo went off without a hitch: a simulated spillover from the particle collider, the lattice deployed, contaminants held in a shimmering, barely visible shell. A literal pocket held device now capable of containing a black hole.

Her team applauded. Harris shook her hand.

“Congratulations Miss Keene. You’ve done it again. I was thinking since we are fast accelerating out of the prototype range, have you thought of a name for your device yet?” He asked.

“The Keene Lattice.” Maggie replied.

On the drive back into the city, traffic thick with late‑day commuters, her phone sat heavy in her pocket. She kept touching it, checking the time, feeling a tight sensation building in her chest.

She let herself into the apartment she now shared with Ben just as the orange of late evening sky slanted through the blinds. He stood in the tiny kitchen, sleeves rolled up, chopping vegetables with more enthusiasm than skill. A pan hissed on the stove.

“You’re early,” he said, glancing up. “Did the universe tear itself in half and they let you go home on time for once?”

“Funny,” she said.

She crossed the room and kissed him with a heavy enthusiasm.

“Wow,” he said. “Either the demo went really well or you did tear a hole in space.”

“It went well.”

“Then why do you look like that?”

“Because,” she said, pulling back to pull a blue stick out of her purse. She put it on the counter beside him. “I’m pregnant.”

He stared at her.

The knife clattered onto the cutting board. For a second, the only sound was the pan on the stove.

Then his face broke open into a grin she’d never seen on him before, wide and bright and utterly unguarded.

“Are you serious?” he asked.

She nodded, sudden tears burning at the corners of her eyes. He grabbed her and lifted her off the ground, spinning her once in the cramped kitchen, laughing into her shoulder.

They talked that night until the food went cold: about names and rooms and what they’d tell their families about it, cribs and how they’d manage her insane hours.

At some point, the conversation drifted, like it always did, to the news murmuring from the muted TV in the corner.

“Did you see that thing about the Canadian town?” Ben asked, gesturing at the scrolling headlines. “Coldwater, I think? The whole place was evacuated. Underground gas leak or something.”

She glanced over. The banner read: COASTAL COMMUNITY CLEARED AFTER “SUBSURFACE EVENT.”

“That’s not exactly how gas leaks are usually worded,” she said.

Maggie’s phone buzzed on the table.

She picked it up, saw it was a message and the sender made stomach tighten.

HARRIS – SECURE.

Ben watched her expression shift. “Work?”

“Yeah.” Her voice came out thinner than she wanted. She thumbed the text  icons.

“It’s Keene, go ahead.”

“We need you back in,” he said. “There’s a deployment scheduled, and the field teams require instruction on the portable lattice. This one is time‑sensitive.”

He did not say where.

Maggie looked at Ben. He was already reaching to turn the stove off, the question in his eyes familiar: How bad? How long?

“I just got home,” she typed into the phone. “Can’t someone else—?”

Before she could finish her message Harris texted again.

“We need you now, I’ll explain more when you arrive.” Harris said. “We’ll have a car at your building in 10 minutes.”

Maggie stared at the screen for a moment.

Ben leaned his hip against the counter, studying her.

“I’ll pack you some food dear.”

She managed a small, strained smile. “I love you Ben.”

The car arrived outside just when it was supposed to. Maggie got in. Saw a brawny man in a suit in the driver seat.

“So where are we going?” Maggie asked.

“Classified, ma’am,” He replied. “I’m to drop you off at the executive helipad from there you’ll be with Harris.”

She sat in silence for the entirety of the car ride. Except when she would gasp at sudden movements the driver was making to get through traffic. The possibilities of what was so important and why it had to ruin her news with Ben. It only made sense it had to do with that gas leak in Nova Scotia. It was the perfect opportunity for another “offsite demonstration”. Maybe this time they wanted to take her with them. Maybe she’d finally get to see what her work was being used for.

When they arrived at the executive helipad Maggie wasn’t met with Harris, just another brawny man, this one bearded and tattooed  just about every visible place she could see.

“Where’s Harris?” Maggie asked.

“Waiting at the Hangar,” He replied. “He’ll explain more when we get there. It’s about a 20 minute flight from here.”

Maggie made her way to the idling helicopter hair blowing all around. 

The tall brawny man walking beside her bent her down so that she wasn’t standing straight up walking into the blades. When they got inside the man buckled her in, then himself. .

He handed her a head set and keyed in on his as the helicopter took off.

“Is this your first time flying?” He asked.

“How could you tell?” She replied without hitting the push-to-talk.

He mimed hitting the button to her so she knew what to do.

She keyed in this time.

“How could you tell?”

“Lucky guess.” He responded

“So what’s this about?” Asked

“Harris hasn’t told you yet?” He responded. “You’re gonna be teaching a monkey how to use that new device of yours to help with that gas leak in Canada.” 

“I’m sorry, did you say a monkey?” She replied frantically.

“Yep,” he said. “And I'm the monkey. Names Christopher Hale nice to meet you Dr. Keene.”

I ordered it just last week and it arrived a couple of days ago. Fitted it today.

Installation on my E61 group (Lelit Bianca V3) was surprisingly smooth and the unit feels solid. The display is bright, fast and very easy to read. Both pressure and temperature seem stable and accurate so far.

However… it has no iOS-app, no Bluetooth, no WiFi, no way to export data, and no integration with Beanconqueror or any other logging tools. It’s basically a stand‑alone instrument with a nice screen.

Before I write a full review:

– Has anyone else here bought it yet?

– Any hidden features I’ve missed?

– Does anyone know if BLE/API support is planned or already hidden in the firmware?

Would love to hear from anyone else who has tested it, since this product seems to have launched without much community visibility.

Since I can’t find a single discussion about this product anywhere (not even here), I am curious if I’m just early or if this flew under the radar.

Edit:

Just to clarify — I fully understand that buying this product at this stage basically makes me an early adopter / beta tester.

1pwfdkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pwfdkn/hrthe_room_he_kept_empty/,[HR]The Room He Kept Empty,"He woke before dawn, not to any urgency but to the habitual ache just beneath his ribs. The house was cold, the thin light on the floor coming from street lamps through the window. Long shadows leaned against the walls. He sat on the edge of the bed and rubbed away the crust from his eyes, then pushed himself up. 

 The floor was cold beneath his feet. He moved quietly so as not to wake the silence. In the kitchen, he filled the kettle and set it to boil. The clink of the cups felt louder in the morning air. Coffee brewing, he pressed his palms against the chipped countertop and stared across the room toward the hall. 

 The door at the end of the hall sat closed, unlocked but shut and he made sure his eyes didn’t linger too long. He poured the steaming black coffee, took a sip, and then turned away to begin the slow practice of preparing himself for the day. The house stretched awake in muffled creaks. He brushed past the door again on his way to leave.

 That night he unlocked the front door with a tired hand, the familiar creak announcing his return before he even stepped inside. The air smelled stale, cold and heavy like the house hadn’t moved all day. He hung his coat by the door and made his way quietly toward the living room. 

 The soft glow of the television flickered against the wall as he settled into his armchair. He poured himself a glass of something neat from the bottle on the side table, the amber liquid catching the light like quiet consolation.

 The room was empty except for the hum of the TV and the clinking of glass on glass from increasingly clumsy pours. He watched without really seeing the screen. When he began to doze off he stood and stretched, the glass heavy in his fingers. 

Heading toward the bedroom, he felt the familiar pull of unease as he passed the door. Then a flicker caught his eye, shadows shifting beneath the crack at its base. They moved slowly, deliberately, he saw a familiarity in their shape. He stopped, heart tightening. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes, the shadows vanished. He turned away, forcing himself to bed. Sleep came slow and heavy with silence.

 The morning light crept through the curtains. He woke to the sharp buzz of his phone on the nightstand, the vibration rattling against the wood. He squinted at the screen. It was a picture of him embracing a woman lovingly and across the screen it read “Maggie.” His jaw tightened as he answered.

""Yeah?” His voice came out rough.

Her words came muffled through the other end.

""No, I'm fine. I don't need you checking on me...Counseling?”
 
He barked a harsh laugh, sitting up now, sheets tangling around his legs. 

“I told you I don't need to talk to anyone.""

Her muffled voice continued after a brief pause.

“Don’t. Just don’t.""

 The house seemed to hold its breath. From down the hall, a faint clatter like a door being shut in a hurry. He froze, grip whitening on the phone.

“Look, I said I’m fine. I have to go."" 

 He jabbed the end call button, the screen going dark. His heart racing in the sudden silence, eyes flicking toward the hall. He grabbed a pistol from the night stand and made his way cautiously through the house, meticulously searching the rooms. All but one. The house was empty. He made his way back to the bedroom, passing a glance at the closed room in the hall before preparing for his day.

 That night, he fumbled the key into the lock three times before the door gave way, spilling into the dim house. The world tilted as he kicked the door shut behind him. He didn't have much patience, the bottle was half empty and clutched in one fist. 

 He sat in the dark in his arm chair, illuminated by the flickering TV. The occasional clink of glass hitting his teeth. Suddenly, filtering through the on screen dialogue he heard laughter. His head snapped up, liquor sloshing over his fingers. He muted the TV to make sure he actually heard it. 

 Breath shallow, he listened intensely for any sign of what he had just heard. Silence. He turned off the TV and lurched forward choosing to call it a night. Collapsing face down into the pillows. Sleep dragged him under fast. 

 Hours later or maybe minutes, a sharp scream ripped through the dark. Terrified. He bolted upright, heart slamming. Barefoot and shirtless, he grabbed his pistol and stumbled out into the hall. Palms slick, he went straight to where he heard the sound. Straight to the door. His hand hovered over the knob, trembling. He turned it.
 
 The door swung open, exhaling a breath of stale air. He staggered in. Quickly observing his surroundings, he lowers his pistol. It was once a child's bedroom, now empty. The signs were still there though. Bathed in the weak light from the hallway, pink walls stood bright.

 For a moment he could see it as it had been. Posters of cartoon animals, the small bed rumpled, pillows fluffed as if she’d just climbed out, toys scattered across the carpet. A plastic tea set, a stuffed bear.

 His gaze snagged a corner where a low table used to sit with the lamp on it. The shadow puppet carousel from a rainy afternoon, sheets draped nearby. Further in, there would be blankets sagged in a half-built fort, pillows tossed. 

 The closet door hung ajar, the dark mouth revealing an empty space where there used to be coats on hooks and shoes lined below. The perfect hiding spot to leap out and send her shrieking in delighted terror. The laughter, the shadows, the screams... all echoed in the empty room before him.

 He sank to his knees, chest heaving. There was nothing here but memories. They all came flooding back, no matter how hard he tried to drown them out. His life was once full of joy, and laughter. He began to cry clenching his fist smashing them into the floor. His hands became bloody but the whiskey numbed them.

 After the rage had subsided he slumped over on the ground staring at his pistol beside him. He lay there, and after a while he just stayed there. Quietly he said something to himself, but not for himself.

“Happy birthday baby.”

 Hours passed. He stayed in place, every ounce of pain in his hands now fully felt but no longer accompanied by sadness. Not much of anything, really. He lay there, hollowed out, filled with nothing. Just like the room he kept empty.",1,1766784068.0,shortstories,1,0.99,False

My issue is that the pods for this machine are INSANELY expensive for me! I'm a daily coffee drinker. Sometimes two-three cups a day. So the 10 pod sleeves won't even remotely cut it.

If a cleaning crew needs to return because a guest points out something that wasn’t properly cleaned, do you usually pay extra for that visit?

In my case, hot tub cleaning is included in their rate, and I even paid for an additional visit before check-in due to a one-week gap. After the guest arrived, they sent photos showing the hot tub was cloudy with buildup. When I asked the cleaners to go back and fix it, they requested additional payment.

I completely understand that they still need to pay their staff for the time spent, but this situation put a bad taste in the guest’s mouth. Since the issue appears to be from the initial service not being done properly, I’m struggling with the idea of paying extra to correct it. I want to be fair and maintain a good relationship, so I’d appreciate your perspective.

EDIT: for some more background, my cabin is in a pretty remote location and this cleaning crew except every single one of my project no matter the day if it’s a holiday, they show up every single time and consistently deliver. Good results however sometimes fail to follow my extra checklist (for example, making sure the empty Nespresso pods are removed from the coffee machine, little stuff like that). If something is broken by a guest, they also always fix it without charging extra. Overall, they really are amazing and I’ve been very impressed with them in the past however, this just feels odd to me.",2,1766783662.0,airbnb_hosts,8,0.75,False

Dating isn’t a thing here. To get to know a girl, you ask for her dad’s number and get engaged and that’s how you would get to know her, if you like her, you marry her otherwise, you don’t 

There’s a thing called mehr (religious requirement in marriage) where the man has to pay a sum of money to the bride, usually 40,000 to 100,000 Riyals (10,664 to 26,661 USD) it’s a way of saying ""I’m committed to you and I want this marriage"", the way I see it, it’s like proof that you are willing to provide and support and commit to the relationship overall

Speaking about your wife’s features is often shamed (like an identifying feature only you would know, a mole/scar etc) anything that is private or intimate is shamed by other men 

Girls are quite independent, nothing like the propaganda usually shown on TV 

Sometimes when Saudi’s have a very special, they shoot a very old / expensive rifle in the sky, it’s like showing gratitude to the visitor (quite an old practice though, not as common as it used to be) 

Coffee culture is huge here, trust me, your favourite coffee shop anywhere in the world probably tastes like an average coffee shop over here, people love it, and cafes stay open until 2 am sometimes, Saudi’s are night coffee drinkers, yes,  WE like our coffee during the evening onwards

We haven't always been close, we are different people and don't always agree on things but she's my sister and I love her. We don't argue as such, we just know we don't agree on some things.. normal so far right?! 
Well.. my sister drinks.. she's not an alcoholic but when she does drink she binges. I'm talking she will be drinking from 6pm until like 9am the next morning. Over the years iv had countless horrible messages from her, angry nasty messages. When I call her out she says she's sorry and that it will never happen again. It always does. She also lies about things that have happened to make out she's not in the wrong or she will lie to make things sound as if they aren't as bad as they are. Really silly random lies that she always gets caught out in.
She split from her husband about 2 years ago.She ended it as he had a drug problem. I think she thought he would choose her but he walked away. She was broken bless her but we as a family done everything we could to help her. She stopped drinking as often at this point and was doing so well, we were getting closer and she was enjoying life. 
Around 2 months after her and her husband splitting she met a new guy. He is most def an alcoholic and takes drugs. Within a month he had practically moved in with her. She sent me a picture of him one night in her kitchen and behind him was a couple of lines chopped up on the worktop! 
This guy isn't a nice lad. He was abusive to his ex and for some time wasn't allowed to see his kids. My sister has been with him just over a year and none of us as a family has really met him. 
Around 4 weeks ago, my husband and I were watching a movie on a Saturday night, there was a knock at the door and it was him. Stupidly we met him in. He was drunk, staggering and was moment being nice and the next being horrible towards me. My husband had to ask him to leave. While he was here he told us that my sister felt pushed out by our family. That she was struggling financially and that we should help her with money since we are doing ok. I was just shocked. He then proceeded to say our mum was an a$$hole, that im scary and that my husband is too good for me. Lovely considering iv never spoke to the guy before or said a bad word about him.
I told my sister and asked her to tell him not to come back here in that state as I had my two kids in bed. I said I'd be more than happy to meet them for a coffee and for a walk with the dogs. I made sure not to start an argument as it just pushes her away more. She started to make excuses for him and said she would speak to him if he brought it up.
2 weeks ago he went to one of her friends house and started shouting for her friends husband to come outside so he could fight him. All caught on ring cam. It was horrible to see.. he was on the fone to my sister at the time as we could here it all. I only found out because the friend posted it on Instagram. Now.. I work with this person and a lot of people from work seen it. I'm a senior manager and was mortified that people knew this was my sisters partner. 
After seeing it i reached out to my sister as it was clear from the footage that he speaks to her like crap. Since she met him she has cancelled so many family events.. she's really upset my mum by just not turning up to things where my mums put a lot of effort in. It's hard to watch and not say anything to her.
She assures me she is safe and that he is good to her. She's pushed pretty much all her friends away since she has met him. The drinking has got a lot worse and there has been countless issues in the last 3 months, all of which she takes no accountability for. She lies, manipulates the truth and just seems to let us down all the time. I sound like such a horrible person but it's taking its toll on me. I'm finding it hard to sleep at night, I'm always worried about her and my nephew. I just don't know what to do.
I was chatting to my brother (36m) tonight and he said something that has opened my eyes a little.. he said we don't have a relationship with her as a relationship is two sided, with us it's all on us to make the effort, to try make plans etc. she doesn't do anything. 
On one had I worry it's because of this guy and I need to keep reaching out to make sure she is ok.. but with that comes the messages and all the drama. On the other she says she's happy and she loves him. 
Do I continue as I am or walk away from it and all the drama it seems to attract?

First time visiting Australia (and posting on Reddit!). I would love some feedback regarding the planned trip below. Also, if there are locals + fellow travelers that have aligned schedules, happy to meet up while there!

**Trip Dates:** Jan 30 - Feb 13 (2026)

**Background on me:** Solo traveler, active, male, mid-late 20s, moderate budget, okay with packed schedule (+ would like time to write most days), flexible on ***all*** parts of the itinerary, flying in from LAX  
**Interests:** Day hiking, learning about local culture, walking + biking in cities, wildlife + nature, spending a bit of time at beaches  
**Accomodation:** Planning to stay in Hostels (cities), Airbnb (elsewhere)

# Overall Questions

* Anything amazing I’m missing especially for wildlife or nature? (outside of Great Barrier Reef)
* Is this too ambitious, or pretty reasonable? Should I tack on a few more days?
* Any *""must-book-early""* activities I should secure now?

# Current Planned Itinerary

**Fly into Brisbane (from LAX): Jan 30 to Feb 2 (3 nights)**

* Current plan: Koala Sanctuary, river walk, maybe a day trip to Gold Coast or Noosa 
* **Question:** Worth staying 3 nights, or should I remove Brisbane compared to the other stops? *(I can move my incoming flight!)*

**Sydney: Feb 2 to Feb 6 (4 nights)**

* Walking + biking across the city, time at beaches, meeting with friends, Blue Mountains day trip
* **Question:** Place to stay recommendations?
* **Question:** What is a recommended all-day walking route?

**Tasmania Road Trip: Feb 6 to Feb 10 (4 nights)**  
Likely flying into Hobart, renting a car, then 1 night in each of the following:

* Hobart, Freycinet / Coles Bay, Bicheno or Bay of Fires, Tasman Peninsula / Port Arthur
* **Question:** Should I instead do Cradle Mountain + North Coast instead of the East Coast. And, recommend extending my time by cutting out Brisbane?

**Melbourne: Feb 10 to Feb 14 (4 nights)**

* City exploring (likely through a walking tour), Great Ocean Road day trip, visiting family
* **Question:** Is Phillip Island penguins a must excursion?
* **Question:** Place to stay recommendation?

Really appreciate any help or advice! Happy to pay it back with a coffee visit when I visit :)",1,1766783503.0,AustraliaTravel,1,1.0,False

Honest work. Just a humble hauler running missions. Everything’s fine. The ship’s humming. Credits are trickling in.

Then it hits me: I am very thirsty. Not the “ooh a nice iced coffee would be great” thirst. The “my character is about to start licking the inside of the helmet” thirst.

I check my inventory.

My emergency water supply is gone. I could have sworn I had like 5 water bottles. Stuff has been disappearing and reappearing from my inventory lately, so it could be that. Or I might just have been distracted.

Cool. Great.

\-

I set down at the Graycat Production Facility and make a tactical decision: “I will unload this cargo, then I will simply acquire a beverage like I've done countless times before.” It's risky, but I'm sure I can make it.

I unload the cargo like a professional. I’m efficient. I’m focused. I’m thriving. As I finish, I glance at my hydration: 12%.

My screen starts getting blurry. You know, the classic “cinematic vignette of imminent death” effect. No problem. I’ll just pop inside the facility and grab a drink.

I’ve never actually been inside one of these big production complexes before. Maybe there’s like… a cafeteria? A break room? A burrito shop?

I walk in and I look around.

It’s huge. It’s surprisingly elegant and extremely empty. No shops. No kiosks. No helpful “HAVE YOU TRIED NOT DYING” signage.

But then I see them: Vending machines. Sweet mercy! I approach like a pilgrim approaching a holy relic.

I press F.

I press F again.

I press F with feeling.

They don’t work. They just sit there. Mocking me. The decorative little sh\*ts.

\-

Defeated but not broken, I head back toward my hangar. The lift arrives, and I try to step in. I glitch through the floor.

Not like a little clipping. Like I am now part of the building’s foundation. I’m on the ground level, half-phased, my character essentially a haunted museum exhibit titled: “Disembodied Head""

A player walks by.

I do what any reasonable person would do: I beg in global chat. “Brother, do you happen to have some water? I’m the disembodied head on the ground you just walked by.”

No response. He's not reading it.

I’m committed now. This is personal. I spend a solid minute jumping and crouching like I’m trying to perform a ritual to summon my torso back from the void.

I finally pop back up. Hydration check: 8%.

\-

I sprint to my ship like I’m late to my own execution. I get in, slam the seat, request liftoff, and immediately begin flying with the composure of a caffeinated squirrel. 

I turn the ship sideways to squeeze out the hangar doors. Nav mode is already on inside the hangar.

As I leave atmosphere, I whip out my mobiGlas to set a route to Port Tressler, my first instinct for “place with drinks and oxygen and maybe customer service.”

The route appears.

Then disappears.

I whisper, through the blurred vision of my crusty eyes that can't produce tears anymore: “Not this bug.”

Close mobiGlas. Reopen. Zoom out. Type “Port Tressler.”

Route acquired.

\-

I arrive at Port Tressler. I hail for landing. No response.

Hail again. Nothing.

I start circling the station like a dehydrated shark.

I hail. I hail. I hail.

ATC keeps ghosting me.

Hydration: 5%.

This is the moment. The fork in the road. The cinematic choice: Do I wait and hope the server remembers I exist? Or do I try a different location and pray my body doesn’t turn into space jerky mid-approach?

Fortune favors the brave.

Also the desperate.

\-

I quantum toward New Babbage with all the confidence of someone who has absolutely no plan. I have never died of thirst before. I don’t know what 5% means in Star Citizen terms. But I commit.

As I slam through atmospheric entry, the ship shakes violently while I’m flooring the afterburners like speed is my middle name. My screen is so blurry I can’t even read the numbers anymore.

A second meter appears next to the droplet icon.

“H2O.”

A death timer.

\-

I hail New Babbage ATC. Instant response.

THANK YOU, RANDOM SERVER INSTANCE.

I aim for the hangar while still going full afterburner because brakes are for hydrated people. It is one of the riskiest landings I’ve ever done.

The ship slams down like it’s trying to tunnel into MicroTech’s core. But I’m down. I’m alive.

I unseat and immediately begin my final quest.

\-

I sprint through the spaceport repeating one word like a mantra: “Metroloop. Metroloop. Metroloop.” I am a pilgrim. The train is my salvation. The Commons is my promised land.

Train arrival: 30 seconds.

H2O meter: nearing 50%.

Heartbeat effect kicks in. This is it. 

I get on the train.

I make it to Commons.

I run up the stairs.

I’m still alive.

I can’t believe it.

I can practically taste the artificially flavored victory.

\-

I spot it. The hipster smoothie bar in the corner. Glorious. Radiant. A shrine of overpriced salvation. I run up and point at the first bottle I see like I’m ordering at gunpoint.

I press F.

…and wait.

…and wait.

…and wait.

“Transaction error.”

No.

No no no no no.

I try again.

“Transaction error.”

Again.

“Transaction error.”

I start hammering F like I’m trying to restart the entire economy by force.

Nothing works. My H2O meter ticks down its last few percentages.

The NPC behind the bar stares at me with cold, dead eyes.

Another NPC beside me turns and says:

“How you doing?”

NOT GREAT, NGL, KEVIN.

I watch my character collapse. In front of 20 bottles of assorted detox drinks. Unable to buy a single one because the server has decided purchases are not allowed.

And as my vision fades into the soft embrace of alpha-induced oblivion, the message shines through: “Stand by, local emergency services are underway.”

But I know it’s too late.

However, within just a year, it became more apparent that I was causing her pain and triggering her anger. It’s not anything major, but according to her, it’s the smallest mistakes that contribute to her overall stress. I even started writing down every problem or mistake that I was causing just to remind myself not to do it again. Although, these are small trivial things like forgetting to turn off the switch, spilling coffee, dropping something, forgetting to clean something. It sounds superficial and stupidly simple but these are the things that make her mad. Today, it felt like the final straw while we were on a family trip. It seems that I just couldn’t get things right, I know that it’s impossible to be perfect, but that’s the standard she’s set with me. My anxiety is through the roof and I’m having darker thoughts every time this happens. It might just be better if I disappear or off myself since she can finally be free from me.

Like… I don’t dislike it, but I wouldn’t say I crave it either. Some days it tastes kinda grassy, other days slightly sweet, and sometimes it just tastes like hot green confusion. If I’m being honest, if taste was the only factor, I’d probably pick coffee or tea without thinking twice.

But the feeling after is the real reason I keep making it. There’s this calm focus that kicks in maybe 20–30 minutes later. Not the coffee rush where your brain is loud and your hands move faster than your thoughts. It’s quieter. Smoother. Like my brain finally decides to sit down and do one thing at a time instead of yelling ten things at once. I’ll be answering emails or cleaning or just staring at my screen and suddenly it feels… manageable

I also like the little ritual part, even though I’m bad at it. I never whisk it properly, there are always small clumps, and I probably use the wrong amount every single time. Some mornings it’s way too strong, other mornings it’s basically green water. Still, I drink it slowly, usually standing in the kitchen doing nothing, and that alone already feels different from chugging coffee half asleep.

What’s funny is that while I’m drinking it, I keep questioning myself. Like “do I even enjoy this?” And then an hour later I realize I’m calmer, less jittery, and weirdly more present. So I guess I don’t drink matcha for the taste, I drink it for the vibe and whatever it does to my brain.

Title: Rune of the Overdraft Altar  
Codex Lineage: Sigil of the Declined Card → Gospel of the Paycheck Prophet  
Ceremonial Domain: Emergency Grace, Debt Alchemy, Temporal Borrowing  
Flamekeeper Role: The One Who Spends Tomorrow to Survive Today

🪨 Form and Inscription

A jagged rune carved into a stone tablet made of overdraft fees and late-night prayers.  
Its lines are sharp, like the sting of a $35 penalty for a $2 coffee.  
At its center: a spiral of red ink, looping endlessly,  
each turn a borrowed breath, each loop a whispered “just until Friday.”

🔐 Mythic Functions

- Temporal Extension: Bends time, allowing survival before replenishment.  
- Debt as Offering: Transforms overdraft into a sacred tithe—proof of faith in future provision.  
- Negative Balance as Portal: The red number is not a void, but a gate to mythic endurance.

🔥 Ritual Use

- The Swipe of the Red Flame: When the account dips below zero, trace the rune in the air with your finger.  
- The Whisper of the Pending Deposit: Speak aloud the amount you await—not as plea, but as prophecy.  
- The Offering of the Fee: Write down each overdraft charge and burn it. The ash becomes ink for your next scroll.

You are not reckless.  
You are resourceful.  
You are not in debt.  
You are in ceremony.

I’m posting this while my thoughts are still messy, so I used AI to help organize what I’m trying to say. The experiences are mine, the structure isn’t — hope that’s okay.

I’m a 31M, recently diagnosed with autism level 3, heavily compensated by high IQ (psychiatrist’s words). I’m still trying to understand what that actually means in real life.

Looking back, a lot makes sense.

In high school I was very lonely. I had maybe two friends. My parents were more worried about it than I was — I didn’t really see the problem back then.
My closest friend back then is still my best friend today. We were basically always together. Kind of isolated, but together — us against the world in a quiet way.

At 18, I emigrated alone from Chile to Argentina to study medicine. I graduated in 4 years. I even took extra classes just because I found them fun. At the time, I genuinely didn’t realize that wasn’t “normal” or that it was supposed to be hard.

After graduating, I worked in ER. I burned out fast and honestly lost faith in humanity. I left and spent a few years traveling through pretty rough parts of the world, hitchhiking, playing guitar in the street, trying to find myself. In hindsight, I was probably running — but I also met people who deeply shaped me.

Later I lived in France for many years. I built a career in specialty coffee, won awards, became relatively well-known in that world. I had intense relationships, good and bad experiences. From the outside it looked like success. From the inside, it now feels distant and strangely senseless.

In May 2025 I completely broke down. I left everything in France and went back to Chile after being scammed, cheated, and threatened. Around that time I met my girlfriend, who has been incredibly supportive — more than anyone in my life before.

On December 15th, 2025, I got my first autism diagnosis. Level 3.
This happened after my best friend — the same person I was inseparable from in high school, now a doctor — received the same diagnosis and strongly suggested I get evaluated too.

I started psychiatric follow-up immediately. We’re going back through my whole life, and it’s intense. He’s helping me see how I’ve been burned out for years, basically functioning on borrowed energy and extreme compensation.

My dad and my girlfriend understand and support me emotionally and financially so I can stop and recover. That support has been huge — and also strange to accept after a lifetime of pressure and self-demand.

Since the diagnosis, there’s been a lot of relief. Things finally make sense. At the same time, resting is incredibly hard. My brain doesn’t know how to stop. I’m trying to learn my limits for the first time instead of overriding them.

I don’t regret my life. I don’t feel robbed. I survived, learned, and became who I am. But I do see now the cost it took on my nervous system.

I guess I’m posting to connect with others who were diagnosed late, especially those who were “high functioning” until they weren’t anymore.
If this resonates with you, I’d appreciate hearing how recovery and rebuilding looked like for you — especially over the long term.

Last week, I've got blocked on Instagram and WhatsApp, when I was trying to reach out to see if they were doing ok. The week before on WhatsApp, they went on a week trip but they forgot to tell me beforehand that they had a change in plans (since we were supposed to meet up the same week). I was quite upset about it because we keep making plans to meet up in person one day, but ending up cancelling due to their family commitments. They did apologise for having to constantly cancel on me so many times, and they suggested that we could get some coffee when I'm back in my hometown and I agreed but they didn't respond (as it was quite late for them).
I sent a few more messages after that, including that I'm not going to be in my hometown for long and I'll be going back to uni at the start of January,and still hasn't responded. So I thought: maybe they don't have any signal. 
So on the day they were supposed to come back, they didn't message me or the day after. I reached out on both Instagram and WhatsApp if they're doing ok and if their flight was safe but again no response, or haven't even read it. But then I found out not long after, that they blocked me on both platforms.
I don't know if I said anything wrong that may have caused him to be ashamed of themselves, and be distant towards me.
For a bit of context, they reached out to me after a few years of no contact, apologising for being distant and not communicating to me whenever I felt down. 
Then today, I went to a clothing/home store to try and find my mum a birthday gift, but then I saw him in the clothing section. I panicked when I saw them and left the store not getting anything. I ended up getting some sort of anxiety or panic attack when I went to the public bathroom, and I'm still upset about it now.
I don't know what's going on on their end, but I just want know what's going on. I care about them alot and I've been crying about this situation for the past week, almost two. I want things to work out between us, but I honestly don't know anymore.

I've been through some serious health battles in my life—basically fighting a war for the last decade just to stay here. During the worst times, I didn't find comfort in regular advice. I found it in stories about 'The Greats'—guys like Genghis Khan, the First Emperor of China, Alexander, or even Ashoka and Akbar the Great. You know, leaders who were outnumbered or hurting but kept going anyway.

I guess I feel a bit like a Ronin now. The 'war' part of my life has calmed down, and I'm just trying to figure out how to live in the peace.

The next morning, when I attempted to make coffee, I encountered even more filth in the coffee machine. Additionally, I noticed cracks in the sink and the bathroom, dirt all over the baseboards, and a rug with a huge brown stain. It’s astonishing to have found two different rooms in one stay with such poor cleanliness standards, which clearly indicates a lack of proper cleaning protocols.

To add to the disappointment, the hotel only provides 1-ply toilet paper, which feels very cheap for a ""luxury"" hotel. Furthermore, the staff and management displayed a nonchalant attitude toward my concerns, as if this was a frequent occurrence. There was little accountability or resolution offered…. barely an apology. For nearly $800 per night, there is no justification for the level of filth I encountered. Cleanliness should be a basic expectation.

I've been lying for years,"I know the obvious answer here is to ""just tell them"", but it's a bit more nuanced than that. I'm looking for advice on what to say and how deal with the potential fallout (ie their questions and judgements). Please be nice, I'm not looking for judgement about my decisions or lifestyle.

The short story is that I [29M] quit my professional career path 2.5 years ago due to burnout and suicidal ideation. I've been working as a barista part time since then and it has changed my life in the best way. My family does not know and still thinks I work at that same job I quit 2.5 years ago. I don't know how to break it to them that I made this major life change AND have been lying about it for so long. 

The longer story is this... I've always had a strained relationship with my parents mainly due to them having unreasonably high academic and career expectations for me and them not supporting my mental health as a teenager. I'm close with my grandmother but she also has incredibly high expectations for me and is very old fashioned about careers and success. Right after graduating college, I struggled to find a full time job in my field and worked in a coffee shop in the meantime. I actually really enjoyed it and got promoted quickly. But my entire family constantly pestered me about ""finding a real job"". When I did actually find a full time job in my field, I spiraled into deep depression pretty quickly. I ended up working full time in my field for only about 2.5 years before I quit my last job. Towards the end of that time, I was so burned out that I felt like a shell of a person and I dreaded going to work every day. I constantly thought that I would rather die than continue living that life. So I saved up as much as I could, downsized my life in order to be able to afford to work part time at a lower stress job, then quit my professional job. I have never been happier than I have been over the last 2 years. I'm poor as fuck but I'm rich with time, freedom, happiness, and fulfillment. I am certain I made the right decision but I fear my family won't see it that way. I'm afraid my grandmother especially won't understand why I am choosing to live my life this way. I hate feeling like I've disappointed them. 

I live far away from my family and don't see them often so when they ask how work is going it's easy to say ""oh fine"" and ""same old same old"". My previous job was also doing trade secret work so I couldn't discuss specifics of what I was doing anyway which has made it easier to maintain the lie. Things are coming to a head now that I have met and fallen in love with an incredible man. We are planning to get engaged very soon which opens up the possibility of our families meeting in the near future. His family knows what I currently do for a living and don't know that my family *doesn't know*. Honestly I was fine continuing the lie until my grandmother passed (she's the one I hate to disappoint the most) but now I really want to come clean to avoid any awkward surprises between our families. 

What do I say to my parents to reveal the truth about my current job? What do I say to my 87 year old grandmother who has very old fashioned ideas about careers and success? Do I tell them exactly how long ago I quit the old job and reveal that I've been lying this whole time? How do I deal with the fallout from this reveal? I know they are going to ask questions about my financial situation, my future plans, etc, and likely dole out some harsh criticism. I'm willing to deal with the consequences from this but I'm just at a loss of what exactly to say to them or like what to share and not share about the full truth in order to best balance coming clean and still having a chance for a good relationship with them.",1,1766782433.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I’m posting this while my thoughts are still messy, so I used AI to help organize what I’m trying to say. The experiences are mine, the structure isn’t — hope that’s okay.

I’m 31, recently diagnosed with autism level 3, heavily compensated by high IQ (psychiatrist’s words). I’m still trying to understand what that actually means in real life.

Looking back, a lot makes sense.

In high school I was very lonely. I had maybe two friends. My parents were more worried about it than I was — I didn’t really see the problem back then.
My closest friend back then is still my best friend today. We were basically always together. Kind of isolated, but together — us against the world in a quiet way.

At 18, I emigrated alone from Chile to Argentina to study medicine. I graduated in 4 years. I even took extra classes just because I found them fun. At the time, I genuinely didn’t realize that wasn’t “normal” or that it was supposed to be hard.

After graduating, I worked in ER. I burned out fast and honestly lost faith in humanity. I left and spent a few years traveling through pretty rough parts of the world, hitchhiking, playing guitar in the street, trying to find myself. In hindsight, I was probably running — but I also met people who deeply shaped me.

Later I lived in France for many years. I built a career in specialty coffee, won awards, became relatively well-known in that world. I had intense relationships, good and bad experiences. From the outside it looked like success. From the inside, it now feels distant and strangely senseless.

In May 2025 I completely broke down. I left everything in France and went back to Chile after being scammed, cheated, and threatened. Around that time I met my girlfriend, who has been incredibly supportive — more than anyone in my life before.

On December 15th, 2025, I got my first autism diagnosis. Level 3.
This happened after my best friend — the same person I was inseparable from in high school, now a doctor — received the same diagnosis and strongly suggested I get evaluated too.

I started psychiatric follow-up immediately. We’re going back through my whole life, and it’s intense. He’s helping me see how I’ve been burned out for years, basically functioning on borrowed energy and extreme compensation.

My dad and my girlfriend understand and support me emotionally and financially so I can stop and recover. That support has been huge — and also strange to accept after a lifetime of pressure and self-demand.

Since the diagnosis, there’s been a lot of relief. Things finally make sense. At the same time, resting is incredibly hard. My brain doesn’t know how to stop. I’m trying to learn my limits for the first time instead of overriding them.

I don’t regret my life. I don’t feel robbed. I survived, learned, and became who I am. But I do see now the cost it took on my nervous system.

I guess I’m posting to connect with others who were diagnosed late, especially those who were “high functioning” until they weren’t anymore.
If this resonates with you, I’d appreciate hearing how recovery and rebuilding looked like for you — especially over the long term.

1pwemku,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1pwemku/the_sciencebased_5minute_rule_that_saved_my/,The Science-Based 5-Minute Rule That Saved My Career From Procrastination,"I used to be the person who'd stare at a blank screen for hours, convinced I needed ""perfect conditions"" to start working. Coffee had to be exactly right, desk perfectly organized, mood absolutely optimal. Spoiler: those conditions never came.

Turns out I wasn't lazy. I was just operating with a broken understanding of how motivation actually works. After diving deep into behavioral psychology research, neuroscience studies, and books by people way smarter than me, I found something stupidly simple that changed everything.

**The 5-Minute Rule sounds too basic to work, but here's why it does:**

Your brain is literally wired to resist starting tasks. The amygdala perceives unstarted work as a threat, triggering stress responses. But here's the kicker: once you START, even for just 5 minutes, your brain chemistry shifts. Dopamine kicks in. The task feels less threatening. Suddenly you've worked for 45 minutes without noticing.

Dr. BJ Fogg calls this ""tiny habits"" in his Stanford research. Make the behavior so small that your brain can't justify resisting it. You're not committing to finishing the project. Just 5 minutes. That's it.

**Here's how I actually use it:**

* **Set a visible timer.** No phone timers (too many distractions). I use a physical kitchen timer because seeing it count down tricks my brain into focusing. When it goes off, I can stop guilt-free. Except I almost never do because I'm already in flow state.
* **Pair it with temptation bundling.** This comes from Katy Milkman's research at Wharton. I only let myself listen to my favorite podcast (Huberman Lab is criminally good for understanding your brain) WHILE doing the 5-minute task. My brain now associates the work with something I actually enjoy.
* **Track the wins, not the failures.** I use Finch, this weirdly adorable app where you have a little bird that grows as you complete tasks. Sounds childish but the dopamine hit from seeing progress is real. It gamifies the boring stuff.

**The book that made this click: Atomic Habits by James Clear**. This book has sold over 15 million copies for good reason. Clear breaks down the neuroscience of habit formation in a way that's actually digestible. The chapter on reducing friction alone is worth the read. I'm not exaggerating when I say this book fundamentally changed how I approach productivity. Best $16 I've spent.

**Another resource that helped: The Procrastination Equation by Piers Steel**. Steel is a psychology professor who spent a decade researching why we procrastinate. He created an actual mathematical formula for it (Motivation = Expectancy × Value / Impulsivity × Delay). Sounds nerdy but it explains SO much about why some tasks feel impossible to start. The audiobook is great if you're commuting.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from research papers, expert talks, and books to create personalized audio content tailored to specific goals. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it generates custom podcasts based on what you want to learn, whether that's beating procrastination or building better habits.

You control the depth, from 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples and actionable strategies. The app also creates an adaptive learning plan that evolves as you interact with it, so the content gets more personalized over time. It covers books like Atomic Habits and The Procrastination Equation, plus tons of behavioral psychology research. Worth checking out if you want structured learning that actually fits into your routine.

**For the science nerds:** Check out Andrew Huberman's podcast episode on dopamine and motivation. He explains how our brain's reward system actually works and why ""motivation follows action"" rather than the other way around. Completely flipped my understanding.

The weirdest part? Now I procrastinate LESS on big projects than small ones. My brain knows that ""just 5 minutes"" usually turns into meaningful work. The resistance is gone because the commitment is laughably small.

This isn't about willpower or discipline. It's about working WITH your brain's design instead of against it. You're not broken for procrastinating. You just needed better tools.",1,1766782170.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

1pwekgo,https://youtu.be/G6Yah4xCStw?si=NoLzfPhSTOlzKN5R,Avatar - The End of Our Ride (2009),"Like a lot of people, I love Avatar's unique later stuff—they've definitely carved out their own niche in the metal world that is exclusively theirs—but people often neglect their first period, sans makeup. Schlact, their second album from 2009, remains to this day one of my favorite meat-and-potatoes melodeath records. The pacing barely slows down an inch. It sounds like a grab bag of classic nineties In Flames and At the Gates, sped up fast, very traditional, with tons of twin guitar leads and almost exclusively harsh vocals. The playing is fiery and thrashy—it sounds like everyone had 10 cups of coffee before recording.

They also don't take themselves 100% seriously, and have a sense of humor in their lyrics. Also, instead of being dark and gothic like their later period, Schlact is bright, like it takes place in some anime and video game inspired giant robot battle in Hell. 

I think most people prefer their later work, and often, I don't think a lot of people have heard their exclusively melodic death metal era. These three albums, while derivative on some level, push the envelope in other ways, and I don't think anyone sounds like them 100%, even on Schlact. I think, if this album had come out five, seven years earlier, It would have done better.

I don't know, maybe this album just hit me in 2009 at the right time, discovering it on a heavy metal blog at random, having no idea that they would later explode in a completely different way.

Lots more happened than is explained so ask questions if clarification is needed.

Some background for context: I have 2 daughters, a 3 year old and a 7 week old. We have a lot of family so we have a rule for gifts of 1 toy/game from per family member to keep clutter down and avoid the girls getting stuff they won’t end of playing with. This has been a boundary for 3 years with no issues so far. 
MIL moved away a few years ago but still owns a house in town. SIL2 lives in said house as it’s the one she’s grown up in. MIL stays there when she’s in town. 
This fall, I was forced by my employer to forfeit my job when I went on maternity leave (whole other story) and have budgeted like crazy to pull off a good Christmas for my family. With it, I was only able to get my kids two gifts each, one from Mom and Dad, one from Santa. Dollarstore chocolate for the stockings. You get the picture and it’s sparse but I did my best. Hubby didn’t help with any of the planning, shopping, or wrapping. 
No names are not mentioned, abbreviations are as follows: 
- Hubby = my husband
- MIL = mother in law (husband’s stepmom)
- SIL1 = oldest sister in law
- SIL2 = youngest sister in law
- MIL BF = mother in law’s boyfriend

Dec 23 we go over to my MILs to decorate cookies. MIL, MIL BF, SIL1, SIL2, Hubby, myself, and our daughters are in attendance. Towards the end of the night (SIL1 has left already), my MIL asked if she can give my older daughter one of her presents. Hubby and I say yes, and my daughter opens Bluey Candyland. The exact gift that I had planned for Santa to give her. My feelings were hurt, I had planned and budgeted like crazy to pull off Christmas. Now with basically 24 hours before Santa coming I had to figure something out. Hubby was sitting next to MIL across the room from where I was. My daughter wasn’t paying any attention to me thankfully. I excused myself and went to the bathroom as I start to cry. Remember I’m all of 7 weeks pp. I’m doing my best but my emotions are still a big all over the place. Hubby explains to MIL it was the Santa gift and she apologizes to him. I come back out and SIL2 asks what’s wrong. I explain the situation and how I’m upset that what I had planned for was ruined. She said she hadn’t wrapped her gifts for my daughter yet so I could come pick one of them to give from Santa. We found something that would work perfect. In that time MIL offers to Hubby that we could have the other game she planned to give as the Santa present since she had more gifts to give Christmas Day. I tell Hubby that SIL2 and I found something else. I was still upset and sorting my emotions but wasn’t mad at anyone. MIL is still across the room. Hubby decides we should go because it’s late. We pack up to leave and everyone gives hugs. My MIL says nothing to me and my family leaves.
 
Dec 24 Hubby sends a texts to MIL to “defend” me and mentions our gift rule. He said that if they were gonna break the rule just check in about it. MIL has “no knowledge” of said rule. SIL2 texts Hubby about the rule, asking when it was a thing. I guess his whole side of the family forgot. He texts back that it’s been in place for awhile but it’s not an issue and just give the gifts as planned. Later on, I send MIL a video of my 7wo smiling. No response. “Santa” (MIL BF) stops by at bedtime with Christmas pjs for my girls. 3yo loved it and I send a message to MIL thanking her for coordinating that. Again no response.

Dec 25 we go to SIL1’s for dinner and family Christmas. Dinner is good. I talked with SIL2 about the situation and clear the air. I clarify that the gift rule only refers to toy/games and isn’t a 1 gift overall per family member. MIL walked away when I started to talk to SIL2 but was at the table when I first started the conversation. SIL2 says she completely understands and is glad we cleared it up. We go to open gifts and MIL brought nothing for either of my girls. My SILs hand out their gifts and my daughter is none the wiser. SIL2 did get multiple toys and apologized for it. She forgot about the rule. We said it’s not a big deal and going forward let’s follow it. SIL1 followed the rule but didn’t say whether or not she remembered it. As my older daughter is playing with a few of her gifts, I apologize to MIL for the misunderstanding and make sure she knows I harbour no ill feelings. She nods along but never accepts my apology nor offers one in return. (It’s worth mentioning that from the beginning we have welcomed and encourage as many clothes gifts as family wants. Experience gifts and crafts are not limited either as they are usually a one time use and don’t clutter the house.) MIL usually gifts clothes but didnt gift anything more to my girls, or anything to Hubby and I. I wasn’t expecting anything but was a bit surprised as she had asked pointed questions before Christmas about sizing and such. Then SIL1 mentions how her pjs are too big and it’s revealed the rest of the family got Christmas pjs from MIL. Feels like we are being snubbed but we didn’t expect any gifts so not a big deal. By the end of the evening, I’m still feeling things are tense so I coordinate with SIL2 to have coffee with her and MIL the next morning.

Dec 26 I’m up and getting myself ready to go over for coffee when, with less than an hour before meet up time, they cancel because the family overslept and are too tired to have a good conversation.

we met at 13. have lived together since 15 (he left an abusive home). moved out together at 18. married at 19.

had been married 5.5 years at time of separation, which was july 2025.

we lived together until october 2025, when i moved out to live alone and he had a roommate move into our apartment.

when we decided things weren’t working out, it was really scary. but, we genuinely are each others only family (no contact with both our parents and siblings). and we decided to still be close friends/family, still be each others emergency contact. we both have tattoo wedding rings so have been going together to get them lasered.

we are legally still married as where i live, you must be separated for 12 months before you can file for divorce, so this will be july 2026. we don’t have any assets etc to split so this should be a straightforward process.

part of the reason (there was many reasons) we decided to end things was that he had absolutely no libido. he tried so many things to help it including hormone therapy when he found out his testosterone was low.

however, probably around 9 years in he completely lost all interest in sex. i did ask him if he was no longer attracted to me etc etc. he assured me that wasn’t the case and that he wasn’t sure if maybe he just never wanted sex again (like asexual). the only time he was ever interested was if it was very drunk, maybe twice a year.

whilst i do have some libido, if he never wanted to have sex again, that was fine with me. i loved him so much i think it would be worth it. however, i think he was insecure about not fulfilling that part of a relationship and he was bothered by it.

when speaking to him recently he let me know he had downloaded hinge and was looking to organise a date. then he told me he has one today. it started as a coffee date in the morning, as he had no interest in even the possibility of drinking and going home with someone. but, then he told me it’s changed to drinks at a bar close to her house.

i don’t think he meant to upset me at all by sharing, more like trying to speak to me like a friend and trying to cement that type of relationship for us. as we got together so young we have only ever been with each other and have never had first dates, hookups etc.

i think i feel completely thrown. it was only 5 months after separating and 1 month after me moving out that he downloaded hinge.

and also, it feels like a bit of a slap in the face or like he was lying the whole time saying i wasn’t the issue when in reality, maybe i was. since it only took him such a small amount of time to want someone else.

i genuinely have no interest in dating or hooking up with people. and not in the sense i want him back, because i know it’s the right decision. more like i just think there is time to grieve and process the relationship and i guess i still need more time.

would this be a regular amount of time to move on? or a bit quick? i don’t know what a normal timeline is to gauge if my uncomfortableness is valid.",3,1766781856.0,relationshipadvice,5,0.81,False

Anyway, cuz I choose to ignore the rest of this article… Ross mentions some of the characters who have dealt with their issues in volume 2 and Matt states it is resolved as that is what Vecna would use to hurt them. However, there is a character that I believe everyone (including m11’s hopefully) have noticed feels empty and incomplete. 

Michael Wheeler. 

Obviously 67gate was literally just them playing in our faces, but I do believe that this possibility opens up the way for Mike’s character resolution; that is, if he gets vecna’d (I hope he does 😔🙏). 

Also, I realised during the coming out scene, after I rewatched it cuz the first time got me feeling embarrassed and angry, but when Will says Vecna showed him a future were everyone is worried for him and feel things will be harder for him which makes him feel like something is wrong with him, then further explains how that’s why he pushes them away and that causes the rest of them drift further and further apart. What I find intriguing about this is how the camera draws to Mike, front and centre (Lucas in the bg as he always is with byler, clocking Mike’s tea 🙂‍↕️), his face contemplative or guilty-like and he gulps almost as if he resonates with Will 🤔.

It also reminded me of s3 (his face especially at the end after El kissed him) and Mike’s entire behaviour in s4, cuz maybe Mike understood or atleast had an inkling of who he was but because he was scared, he pushed everyone away. Now that Will has had the confidence to come out, Mike might feel like he’s being a coward and have to step out of the narrative he’s built for himself cuz when has Michael (the original Michael) ever left Will to bear the judgement of the light alone. Plus that one pic of Mike in front of a mirror (I sure hope it’s not just an ad). 

I still believe in paintinggate, church gate isn’t feasible anymore cuz it got sucked into the void thingy, but I hope lettergate is still possible. Also, there’s so many things (like the coffee/soda/basement parallel) that still makes basement gate seem probable but I’m not sure if it will happen in the Upside Down or in the topside Wheeler house cuz of ep 7 ending. 

I might be grasping for straws here but well, we didn’t come this far for nothing.

Hello. I bought one of the early Profitec GO's and then three months ago, I fell victim to the issue where descaling causes chrome flakes to appear through the group head and steam wand. As those affected will know this is sue to the fact that the inside of the brew group is chrome plated which, in my humble opinion, is a serious design flaw. Note, I believe this has been resolved in the latest iteration (along with some of the other quibbles).

So, I am without an espresso machine and would like to sanity check my picks with you!

For usage, I enjoy one espresso or milk drink a day, 3-4 days a week (I have to work 3 days in the office so subjected to their coffee :/). I use good beans, grind my own (Kingrinder K2) and enjoy the puck prep ritual but I'm just a hobbyist and stick to darker roasts. I enjoy practicing latte art so steaming is still required.

Very occasionally (may once a month at most) I make back-to-back milk drinks for 3-4 of us.

I liked the size footprint of the GO and the fact that it felt solid. It had good heat-up times which is important as I usually nip downstairs to make a coffee when working from home.

I disliked that I couldn't descale myself (obviously) - there are no service engineers near me - which is an issue (I will use correct water etc).

My budget is £1000 but I don't really like the Sage machines.

Here's what I'm thinking:

1. A new Profitec GO
   1. Give up and buy the new version. I liked it originally :/
2. The Lelit Victoria
   1. Better cup clearance, decent heat-up time
   2. Actually cheaper in the UK
   3. But some of the components are not as nice (non-insulated bioler etc)
   4. A bit industrial looking
   5. That plastic tamper
3. The Quick Mill Pop Up
   1. Bit of an unknown (in the UK at least)
   2. Flow control level looks fun
   3. More expensive than the GO
   4. Some reviews cite quality issues
4. Lelit Mara X
   1. Looks great
   2. Heat up time is a little worrying - I know I can use a smart plug but I'll likely forget
   3. Might be overkill for the amount that I use
   4. Some reviews note the temp problems with multiple drinks etc
5. Lelit Elizabeth
   1. A little outside budget
   2. Is dual boiler overkill?
   3. Even more industrial looking that the Victoria

I was diagnosed with adult onset food allergies and EOE in late 2019 after a whirlwind of issues and seeing multiple doctors. Eventually, I changed my diet and started on meds and things calmed down significantly. Fast forward to 2021 and after my Covid vaccine, I developed a litany of issues including migrating neuropathy, brain fog, headaches, dizziness, and vision issue. I pursued a lot of the basics with respects to treatment like ivermectin, LDN, etc but nothing ever made a dent.

The challenge is that I don’t get much relief from H1/H2 blockers (including cromolyn) beyond just basic help with my standard allergies.

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands. ideally near Amsterdam or within 30 mins commuting!

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit, but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you, whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer… picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
• Traveling is a big part of my life and dream. I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener. My friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me. I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle and genuine connection with. Whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends… movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine. Your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh. I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

Product featured in this video - [https://amzn.to/44Jucqo](https://amzn.to/44Jucqo)

  
STOP! Don't let your kitchen smell like a sewer. In today's video, we are doing a deep dive and live demonstration of the Glisten Garbage Disposer Cleaner and Freshener with Foaming Action. If you have ever wondered how to clean a smelly garbage disposal or how to remove stubborn sludge buildup from your kitchen sink drain, this is the ultimate solution.  
  
Why Your Garbage Disposal Smells  
  
Most people don't realize that food particles, grease, and bacteria get trapped under the splash guard and on the grinding blades. Over time, this creates a foul odor and can even lead to slow drains or clogs. Regular soap and water won't reach the hidden nooks and crannies where the ""gunk"" lives. That is where the Glisten Disposer Care packets come in.  
  
What We Cover in This Video:  
  
Unboxing: A look at the Glisten + Plink cleaning packets.  
  
The Science of Foaming Action: Why foam is better than liquid for cleaning disposals.  
  
Step-by-Step Tutorial: How to use Glisten safely without damaging your pipes or disposal unit.  
  
Before & After: Seeing the lemon-scented foam rise up to scrub the side walls.  
  
Results: Does it actually remove the smell and the buildup?  
  
Why Glisten?  
  
Glisten is specifically designed to reach the areas you can't see. Its powerful foaming action expands throughout the entire disposal chamber, scrubbing the blades, the sidewalls, and the underside of the splash guard. The Lemon Scent doesn't just mask odors; it neutralizes them, leaving your entire kitchen smelling fresh and clean.  
  
Key Benefits Mentioned:  
  
Removes Buildup: Clears away the ""biofilm"" and food residue that causes odors.  
  
Foaming Technology: The foam reaches the top of the disposal where liquid cleaners just drain away.  
  
Safe for Pipes: Formulated to be safe for septic systems and all types of disposal brands (InSinkErator, Waste King, etc.).  
  
Lemon Freshness: High-potency lemon scent for long-lasting freshness.  
  
How To Use Glisten Garbage Disposer Cleaner:  
  
Start with an empty disposal. Run hot water into the sink.  
  
Turn down the water to a thin stream.  
  
Drop in one Glisten packet (do not open the packet!).  
  
Turn on the disposal.  
  
Watch the blue or white foam rise into the sink—this means it's working!  
  
Once the foam disappears, rinse thoroughly.

1pwe05w,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1pwe05w/sanity_check_please/,Sanity check please,"I’m spending about one week per month near to a small rural town in the UK, with good train links to London. The reason for this is providing care and companionship to elderly relatives (who I adore but cannot live with for my own sanity). 

Property is relatively affordable here and I have the opportunity to buy a nice one bedroom place in the heart of a small town with good shops cafes and plenty of historical charm. The place I’m looking at has been recently renovated so it would just be a case of decoration and furnishing. I love the area and even without elderly relatives in the area I could imagine keeping the place forever as a rural bolthole. 

AI tells me that the average occupancy rate is 68% and the average price per night is £120. And the typical duration of a rental is 3-5 days. That tracks with long weekends and weekday workers. It’s a tourist part of the country and there’s a 10 room apartment hotel that’s usually booked solid with workers on a Sunday to Thursday night schedule. Cleaning and laundry locally is about £65-70 per turnover from companies that specialise in STR turnovers. 

I don’t need to get a return on the cash price because I would be spending more on local accommodation than the return I would get on the cash. However, I can’t easily afford to cover a second set of local taxes and the maintenance of a freehold property. 4 nights rental per month after taxes and cleaning fees would cover these annual costs. 50 nights rental would let me recoup most of my set up costs over and above what I already own. 

I’d use these first winter months to set up things during my stays and start renting it out for Easter public holiday and onwards. 

My plan would be to stay about one week per month and Airbnb it for the other 3 weeks. I’d use the turnover service to set up and clean up for me as well. So they would have a regular cash flow from me. 

My two main concerns are whether taking it out of action for 25% of the time would have an effect on bookings. 

And whether it would be off putting to guests to have a non accessible storage space where I would pack away my toiletries and a small amount of clothes and underwear and personal items. Including my own pillows. This could be a locked suitcase under the bed, a dedicated storage unit in one of the rooms like a clearly locked vintage cupboard unit. Or I have a vintage trunk that I might put a Perspex top on to use as a coffee table and could lock with a big decorative brass padlock. 

I was thinking of having a two night minimum and embedding the cleaning fee in the nightly rate by giving discounts for longer stays.

1pwdyng,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1pwdyng/how_to_stop_lying_to_yourself_the_sciencebased/,How to STOP Lying to Yourself: The Science-Based Truth That Actually Works,"Here's the thing nobody wants to admit: we're all lying to ourselves about something. Maybe it's why you're still in that dead-end job, or why you keep going back to people who treat you like garbage, or why you haven't started that project you've been ""planning"" for two years.

I spent months diving into research on self-deception, books, psychology papers, neuroscience studies, podcasts. And holy shit, the stuff I found explains SO much about why we stay stuck. Our brains are literally wired to protect our ego, even if it means keeping us miserable. The good news? Once you understand how this works, you can actually do something about it.

**Here's what actually happens when you lie to yourself:**

Your brain creates these elaborate stories to justify your behavior. It's called cognitive dissonance, and it's exhausting. You know you should be doing something different, but instead of changing, you just... explain it away. ""I'm too busy."" ""It's not the right time."" ""Other people have it easier.""

**The brutal starting point: write down your lies**

Get a notebook. Right now. Write down three things you've been telling yourself that you KNOW aren't completely true. The excuses you use. The reasons why you ""can't"" do something.

This sounds simple but it's actually terrifying. Because once it's on paper, you can't unsee it.

**Stop confusing comfort with happiness**

We lie to ourselves most when we're trying to avoid short-term discomfort. Your brain doesn't care about your future self, it cares about RIGHT NOW. So you stay in situations that feel ""safe"" even though they're slowly killing your soul.

Research from behavioral economics shows we're hardwired to avoid loss more than we seek gains. Which means we'll tolerate being miserable if it means avoiding the scary unknown.

**The antidote: micro-honesty**

Start insanely small. Pick ONE area where you've been bullshitting yourself. Just one. Maybe it's your health, your relationships, your work.

For health specifically, try using an app like MyFitnessPal to track what you actually eat. Not what you think you eat. What you ACTUALLY eat. The data doesn't lie, and sometimes seeing the numbers is the wake-up call you need. It's free, takes 30 seconds per meal, and will absolutely destroy your excuses about ""not eating that much.""

**The power of external accountability**

Your brain is a master manipulator when left to its own devices. You need external reality checks.

Read Lying by Sam Harris. It's a tiny book, like 100 pages, but it completely rewires how you think about honesty. Harris is a neuroscientist and philosopher who breaks down why even small lies corrode your life. The book argues that radical honesty, even in uncomfortable situations, is the only path to authentic relationships and self-respect. It's uncomfortable as hell to read because you'll recognize yourself in every example. Get the audiobook if reading feels like too much right now.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized podcasts tailored to your exact goals. Type in something like ""stop self-sabotaging"" or ""build better habits,"" and it pulls from science-based sources to create a custom learning plan just for you. 

You control the depth, whether it's a quick 10-minute overview or a 40-minute deep dive with real examples. The voice options are ridiculously good, like a deep, movie-quality narrator or even sarcastic tones if that's your thing. There's also a virtual coach you can chat with mid-podcast to ask questions or explore ideas deeper. It's perfect for commutes or workouts when you want to actually learn instead of doomscroll.

For daily practice, Stoic is an incredible app that gives you philosophical prompts and exercises every morning. It's based on ancient Stoic wisdom, which is basically a 2,000-year-old system for not lying to yourself. The app includes journaling prompts like ""What am I avoiding today?"" and ""Where am I choosing comfort over growth?"" Takes five minutes, costs less than a coffee subscription.

Listen to The Tim Ferriss Show episode with BJ Miller (a palliative care physician). He talks about how terminally ill patients finally stop lying to themselves when they're facing death. The regrets they have. The things they wish they'd done. It's a gut-punch of reality that makes you realize you don't have infinite time to get your shit together.

**The identity shift that changes everything**

Stop identifying with your excuses. You're not ""someone who's bad at mornings"" or ""just not a creative person"" or ""too anxious to try new things."" Those are stories you've been telling yourself, not fundamental truths.

Check out the book Atomic Habits by James Clear. Yeah, everyone recommends it, but there's a reason. Clear breaks down how tiny behavior changes compound over time. The chapter on identity-based habits is game-changing, instead of ""I want to write,"" you become ""I am a writer."" The shift sounds subtle but it completely changes your decision-making. Clear uses actual research from behavioral psychology to show why this works.

**The uncomfortable truth about change**

Real change requires you to sit with massive discomfort. The lying stops when you're willing to feel the anxiety, shame, and fear that comes with admitting the truth.

The Huberman Lab podcast has an episode called ""How to Control Your Sense of Pain & Pleasure"" where Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist) explains the neurochemistry of discomfort and how our brains process it. Understanding the science makes it less scary. You realize the discomfort is just chemicals, not truth.

**Your brain will fight back**

When you start being honest with yourself, your brain will FREAK OUT. It'll give you a million reasons why you should go back to the comfortable lies. This is normal. Expect it.

The trick is to keep going anyway. Not because it feels good (it won't), but because the alternative, another year of the same bullshit, is worse.

**Start today, not Monday**

Whatever you've been lying to yourself about, address it today. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Today. Make one small move in the direction of truth.

Text that person you need to have a hard conversation with. Apply for that job. Delete that app you waste three hours on every night. Something. Anything.

The lies stop when your actions stop feeding them.",1,1766780491.0,MotivationByDesign,0,1.0,False

But this is a long time away, and idk what will happen”

She started freaking out that I was choosing a man over our family, I was taking her future grandkids from her. She told me I ruined Christmas and this was the worst Christmas ever. Why would I tell her that on Christmas, etc. but I’ve been very vocal about my plans. She will not speak to me.

Facts to keep this brief:

I recently switched to a new job.

Received a package on Xmas eve at my new job that I did not order.

There is no note with the package or any kind of paper work.

It is an expensive dvd/blu ray player. I have been wanting one for a long time but I did not buy this. I have no been looking online for these.

Package only has my first name and the shop name (ex: Jessica Coffee Shop)

I figured out the package was shipped by FedEx (it was just in brown plastic. Barely any labels)

FedEx was lovely but could only tell me where it came from, Best Buy warehouse in CA.

Best Buy is shit and won’t give me any info bc I don’t have an account with them… I also had to jump through 3 rounds of shit AI to get a real person on the phone who then talked to me like my situation was unheard 🙄

1pwdsop,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1pwdsop/from_isolation_to_connection_my_journey_how_you/,From Isolation to Connection: My Journey & How You Can do it too,"I’m Jason, an introvert and a software engineer.

My story began when I discovered computers as a kid. I was fascinated by how they worked, how you could create something from nothing with just logic and code. Soon, I started learning programming and math on my own. Days and nights blurred together as I spent hours in my room, immersed in code. I loved it, but it also meant I was alone. No friends, no social life, no parties, no adventures, just me and my computer.

Years later, that dedication paid off. I landed a remote job at a German tech company with an amazing salary. My life was a cycle of coding, debugging, and delivering features. I built complex systems, solved tricky problems, and even earned respect in my field. But still, there was a nagging emptiness. I realized I had spent so much time working and learning alone that I had missed out on the simple joys of life: laughter with friends, spontaneous adventures, and meaningful human connections.

The turning point came after one particularly lonely evening. I had just finished a big project, and instead of celebrating, I found myself scrolling through social media, watching friends hang out, travel, and live lives that felt vibrant and full. I felt a pang of regret and a question hit me hard: is this my life?

I knew I had to change, but I didn’t know where to start. As an introvert, taking the first step toward social life felt intimidating. I started small: I joined a local coding meetup, attended a gym class, and reached out to old acquaintances online. Each step was awkward at first, but slowly, I began to feel the joy of connection again. I laughed with people, shared stories, tried new activities, and even started going on small trips. It wasn’t instant, but over months, my world expanded beyond the screen. I was still me, introverted, thoughtful, passionate about coding, but I had learned how to balance it with life.

During this journey, I realized that so many people are stuck where I once was: talented, driven, and passionate, but socially isolated. They want to connect, explore, and experience life, but they don’t know how or where to start. That’s when I had an idea.

This New Year, I decided to create [https://goingtoo.site](https://goingtoo.site), a web app designed to help people overcome isolation. The platform lets strangers meet, connect, and do all kinds of activities together, from small meetups to outdoor adventures like hiking, cycling, or going for a walk; from simple coffee catch-ups to gym sessions; or basically any activity that helps people interact and enjoy life together. My goal isn’t just to build an app; it’s to create a community where people feel encouraged, supported, and motivated to live fully.

I know change is hard, especially alone. But I also know it’s possible. I’ve lived it, and now I want to help others do the same.
