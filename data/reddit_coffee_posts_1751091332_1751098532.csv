But I can't get past due to the way they portray money. They are supposed to be middle class, starting from low class since she escaped the rich family. Yet they can afford to eat outside, morning lunch and dinner with countless times in between for cofee and muffins. 

You can't afford to go to private school? No matter, the rich will give the money. 
Want to repay? The rich you will give you the money they invest in you, only to give it back. 
You need a loan to buy a FUCKING inn while you don't qualify? No matter, the rich will vouch for you. 
Fancy ass expensive University? The reach will step in. And when you suddenly don't want that? Another rich will die, only for you to inherit few millions. 
Want to marry 1,2 or 25 different man? All of them have few millions lying around to buy you a castle. 
And of course, the guy you just met, happens to be billionaire, that takes you for a coffee with a private jet and let's you stay for free in a fancy apartment.

# Hack #1: The Instant ""Dream Itinerary"" Generator

You know the drill. A client sends a vague request: ""We want a romantic 10-day trip to Italy in June."" Awesome! But now you have to spend the next few hours piecing together a day-by-day plan from scratch. This is where your first game-changing **ChatGPT prompt for travel agents** comes in.

Instead of starting with a blank document, you can use ChatGPT to create a detailed, inspiring first draft of an itinerary in minutes. This gives you a fantastic foundation to tweak and personalize with your own expert touch.

**How it boosts your productivity:**  
It takes the heavy lifting of initial research and structuring off your plate. You go from zero to a fully-formed idea in the time it takes to make a coffee.

**Copy-Paste These ChatGPT Prompts:**

**For a detailed first draft:**  
Act as a luxury travel agent. Create a detailed 10-day itinerary for a couple's honeymoon in Italy in June. They are in their early 30s, love food, wine, history, and a mix of relaxation and sightseeing. Their budget is around $8,000 USD, not including flights. Include suggestions for boutique hotels, unique food experiences (like a cooking class), and a logical travel route starting in Rome and ending in the Amalfi Coast. Format it as a day-by-day plan.

**For brainstorming unique activities:**  
I'm building a family-friendly itinerary for Costa Rica. Give me a list of 10 unique, off-the-beaten-path activities suitable for a family with kids aged 8 and 12. Focus on wildlife, adventure, and cultural experiences beyond the typical tourist traps.

**For a themed itinerary:**  
Generate a 7-day ""Lord of the Rings"" themed self-drive itinerary for New Zealand's South Island. Include key filming locations, suggested scenic drives, and one or two non-LOTR related activities to break it up.

You can see how these specific **ChatGPT prompts for travel agents** give you a massive head start. Just take the output, sprinkle in your personal recommendations, add your branding, and you've got a beautiful proposal ready to go.

# Hack #2: The ""Irresistible Email"" Composer

Writing emails can be a real time-sink. You need to sound professional yet friendly, persuasive but not pushy. And you have to do it over and over again for inquiries, follow-ups, and sending quotes. Let ChatGPT be your personal copywriter.

You can use it to draft virtually any email you need, tailoring the tone and content to the specific situation. This ensures you're always communicating effectively without spending 20 minutes agonizing over the perfect wording.

**How it boosts your productivity:**  
It slashes your admin time on communications, freeing you up to handle more clients. It also helps you stay on top of follow-ups, which is where so many sales are won or lost.

**Copy-Paste These ChatGPT Prompts:**

**For responding to a new inquiry:**  
A potential client just filled out my website form. They are a family of 4 (kids 10, 14) interested in a spring break trip to national parks in Utah and Arizona. Write a warm, welcoming email response. Acknowledge their request, introduce myself and my expertise in family adventure travel, and ask 2-3 specific questions to better understand their needs and travel style. Keep the tone friendly and excited.

**For the crucial follow-up:**  
Write a polite and gentle follow-up email to a client named Sarah. I sent her a detailed proposal for a Greek island-hopping trip 4 days ago and haven't heard back. The subject line should be catchy and not sound salesy. In the email, remind her of the proposal, ask if she has any questions, and create a sense of urgency by mentioning that hotel availability for her dates might become limited.

**For sending a quote:**  
Draft an email to send along with a travel quote. The email should briefly summarize the attached proposal for a trip to Japan, highlight 2-3 key value points (e.g., the seamless logistics, the exclusive ryokan booking), and have a clear call to action, like scheduling a brief call to walk through the details.

These **ChatGPT prompts for travel agents** help you maintain consistent, high-quality communication without the mental fatigue.

# Hack #3: The ""Social Media Superstar"" Content Machine

""I need to post on Instagram today... but what?!"" We've all been there. Social media is crucial for modern travel agents, but the content hamster wheel is exhausting. This is probably my favorite way to use **ChatGPT prompts for travel agents**. It's an endless well of creativity.

Use ChatGPT to brainstorm post ideas, write captivating captions, come up with video scripts for Reels or TikTok, and even generate a full month's content calendar.

**How it boosts your productivity:**  
It eliminates ""content block"" forever. You can plan and create a week's worth of high-quality social media content in under an hour.

**Copy-Paste These ChatGPT Prompts:**

**For a content calendar:**  
Act as a social media manager for a travel agency specializing in adventure and eco-tourism. Create a one-week content calendar for Instagram. Include daily themes (e.g., 'Myth-Busting Monday,' 'Travel Tip Tuesday,' 'Destination Deep-Dive Wednesday'), post ideas for each day, and suggest a format (e.g., Carousel, Reel, Static Image).

**For writing a specific post caption:**  
Write an engaging Instagram caption for a beautiful photo of the Northern Lights in Iceland. The caption should be inspiring and educational. Start with a hook, share 3 fascinating facts about the Aurora Borealis, and end with a call to action asking followers to share their dream travel experience.

**For a video script:**  
Write a script for a 30-second Instagram Reel. The topic is ""3 Things You MUST Pack for a Trip to Southeast Asia (that you haven't thought of)."" The tone should be fun, fast-paced, and helpful. Format it with visual cues for each point.

Seriously, the possibilities are endless. Consistent, valuable content builds trust, and these prompts make it almost effortless.

# Hack #4: The ""Destination Expert"" in Your Pocket

Even the most seasoned travel agent doesn't know everything about everywhere. When you get a request for a destination you're less familiar with, the research can be daunting. While it never replaces deep expertise or a trusted DMC, ChatGPT can act as your first-line ""Destination Expert.""

It can give you a quick, digestible overview of a location's highlights, culture, logistics, and hidden gems. The key here is to use it for initial brainstorming and then **always, always, always verify the information** with trusted sources like official tourism boards or your industry partners.

**How it boosts your productivity:**  
It dramatically cuts down your initial research time, helping you sound knowledgeable and confident right from the first client conversation.

**Copy-Paste These ChatGPT Prompts:**

**For finding hidden gems:**  
I have clients going to Lisbon, Portugal, for 5 days. They want to avoid the major tourist crowds. Give me a list of 7 unique, local experiences they could have. Think small, family-run restaurants, interesting neighborhoods beyond the city center, and cool local markets or shops.

**For logistical information:**  
What are the main transportation options for getting between cities in Switzerland for a tourist? Briefly explain the pros and cons of trains vs. renting a car. Also, mention any popular travel passes I should know about.

**For cultural etiquette:**  
Provide a list of 5 important cultural etiquette tips for a first-time American traveler visiting Japan. Focus on things related to dining, temples, and interacting with locals.

Remember, this is your starting point. As the American Society of Travel Advisors ([ASTA](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asta.org%2F)) often emphasizes, the value of an agent is their expertise and verified knowledge. Use AI to get the ball rolling, then use your professional resources to confirm every detail.

# Hack #5: The ""Objection Handler"" Scriptwriter

""I can find that cheaper online."" ""Why do I need a travel agent?"" Hearing these can be deflating. But what if you had the perfect, confident response ready every single time? You can use ChatGPT to role-play and draft calm, convincing answers to any client objection.

This helps you articulate your value proposition clearly and professionally, turning skepticism into a signed contract.

**How it boosts your productivity:**  
It removes the anxiety and hesitation around tough conversations. You'll feel more prepared and confident, which leads to better outcomes and less stress.

**Copy-Paste These ChatGPT Prompts:**

**For the ""I can book it myself"" objection:**  
My client said, ""This looks great, but why can't I just book these hotels and tours myself online?"" Write a persuasive and friendly response that explains the value of a travel agent without being defensive. Highlight benefits like my personal expertise, having an advocate if something goes wrong, saving them time, and potential access to perks they can't get.

**For the price objection:**  
A client is hesitating on a safari package because of the price. Write a script for a phone call that gently reframes the conversation from 'cost' to 'value' and 'investment in memories.' Help me explain what's included in the price (expert guides, all-inclusive-lodges, seamless transfers) that makes it a superior experience to a cheaper alternative.

These powerful **ChatGPT prompts for travel agents** arm you with the language to confidently prove your immense worth.

# Hack #6: The ""Perfect Package"" Namer & Describer

Let's be honest, ""7-Day Italy Trip"" isn't exactly inspiring. The way you name and describe your packages matters! A great name sparks curiosity, and a great description helps the client picture themselves there. But being creative on demand is tough.

Use ChatGPT to brainstorm evocative names and write vivid, benefit-driven descriptions for your custom packages and services.

**How it boosts your productivity:**  
It injects a dose of high-end marketing creativity into your proposals without you needing to be a professional copywriter.

**Copy-Paste These ChatGPT Prompts:**

**For brainstorming package names:**  
Brainstorm 15 creative and luxurious names for a 10-day honeymoon package to Bali. The package includes private villas, spa treatments, jungle trekking, and gourmet dining.

**For writing a compelling description:**  
Using the name ""Bali Bliss & Beyond,"" write a 200-word promotional description for the package. Use evocative, sensory language. Focus on the feelings and experiences the couple will have, not just the list of inclusions. The goal is to make it sound absolutely irresistible.

# Hack #7: The ""Effortless Testimonial"" Requester

You know that glowing reviews are pure gold for your business. But asking for them can feel awkward, right? And sometimes, a client sends back a nice-but-boring ""It was a great trip, thanks!"" You can use ChatGPT to solve both problems.

Draft a perfectly worded, non-pushy email to request a review. You can even (with your client's full permission!) offer to polish their rough notes into a well-structured testimonial that truly captures the magic of their trip.

**How it boosts your productivity:**  
It systemizes the process of collecting powerful social proof, which is one of the most effective ways to attract new clients.

**Copy-Paste These ChatGPT Prompts:**

**For requesting a review:**  
Write a short, warm, and personal email to send to clients a week after they return from their trip. The email should first welcome them home and ask about their favorite memory. Then, gently ask if they would be willing to share their experience in a short review on my Google Business Profile, and include a placeholder for the link. Make it clear that it would mean the world to my small business.

**For polishing a client's feedback (with permission!):**  
My client sent me this email: ""The trip to Peru was amazing! We loved Machu Picchu and the guide, Juan, was the best. The hotels were nice too. Thanks for everything!"" With their permission, rewrite this into a more detailed and impactful testimonial of about 100 words. Expand on the points, invent some plausible positive details, and structure it like a formal review I can feature on my website.

# Quick Tips for Writing Better ChatGPT Prompts

* **Be Specific:** The more detail and context you give, the better the result. Include target audience, tone, length, format, and goal.
* **Assign a Role:** Start your prompt with ""Act as a..."" (e.g., ""Act as a luxury travel blogger,"" ""Act as a marketing expert""). This puts the AI in the right mindset.
* **Iterate:** Don't love the first response? Tweak your prompt and try again. Ask it to be ""more formal,"" ""funnier,"" or to ""rewrite this from a different perspective."" It's a conversation!

Played pool once, and he messaged me first not long after, in early March. We started talking more — daily, deeply, and emotionally. From late March to April, we didn’t see each other in person for almost a month, but our emotional connection deepened. He flirted, opened up, and things felt like they were naturally progressing. It felt real.On my birthday in April, his friend told me he was “confused” about his feelings for me since these random girls took his phone and said that he went on a rant on how he doesnt want me but his friend explained everything as he got chated on in a previous situation ship. That hurt, especially after everything we’d shared. But I didn’t confront him. I stayed calm, patient — I wanted to be different from the people who had hurt him before. A day later we met upays later, he talked to me directly. He said he’d been scared, that his past situationships made him hesitant, and discussed them all and said we should take things slow. he told me not to get attached and stuff.howevr we got intimate the day after we hung, as  He said the way I didn’t jump to conclusions — how understanding I was — made him like me again.After that, things continued. We told each other “I love you"" that day we started getting intimate and the week after so many times. We made casual plans about how we’d one day tell our families if things got serious, travelling together whatnot the week after that and i went to his house for the first time. It felt like we were building something slowly and mutually.  I asked him if he wanted to date that day — and he said yes. We officially dated for 2 days.

But in those two days, I felt something was off. He was acting a little distant — not cold, but not the same. So I gently reached out. I messaged him asking how his day was, then asked to call. That’s when he told me he wasn’t ready. That his fears came flooding back the day after and on the day he told me. he said we had to stop the intimacy and wanted to be solely platonic. He cried before. I cried on the call with him. He said it wasn’t about me — it was about the weight of his past. He told me I could call the next day if I wanted, and I did and said he willl be here for me, but he said i had to move on. He invited me over the next day.

That day he made me food, coffee — looked after me like he still cared. We talked. I asked if I could take my shirt off (I was hot),cause i excercised lmao after being on call with his friend and he said it was fine. Later, in his room, he said again he didn’t want to use me, that he felt guilty, but debated whether to be intimate. i asked him if he wanted me to put my shirt back on but he was fine with me having it off.  I told him i was okay with it — because emotional connection mattered  to me since it was hard to let everything go considering the past weeks. That day, we were intimate again. He told me I couldn’t say “I love you” anymore, and when I slipped, he reminded me. he said that if he gets a gf we would have to stop being intimate which did hurt me but i was fine with it anyhow cause yk. I remember zoning out while kissing him, and he asked what was wrong. I couldn’t say it, but I was scared — scared that he was slowly detaching while pretending to still be close. i cried during cuddling and stuff and he said ""dont cry now"" and like ""cry when its over"". 

Later, I learned he had asked someone else to a ball around the time we were intimate.she did just wanna go as friends tho. He braided another girl’s hair in front of me 2 days after i last went to his house and was intimate w him. even though they were jus friends and that girl had a bf.

And I still don’t think he meant to be cruel. I think he’s scared. Unhealed. Emotionally blocked. But I gave him love, trust, patience. I never tried to force anything. I showed up, again and again. When I finally slipped — one small, fear-driven lie — he walked away. That still makes me feel worthless. he sounded like he didnt care for me at all and didnt want me talking to him, said i lost privalege of hugs when i last called him to talk ab the whole situation ab me lying outta fear. he said to call if its an absolute emegency since he has other friends to take care of and i apologized for crying and he said its ok hes a therapist for a lot of ppl. he said to me to not think hes just free sitting around for or smth like that which hurt cause whenever i needed him and felt sad i called cause he was my comfort zone.

I know I’m not perfect. But I was real. Loving. Soft. Consistent. I didn’t play games. I just wanted to show him that not everyone hurts you.

Maybe I was the love he wasn’t ready for. was i in the wrong? i messed up i shouldve never lied.",1,1751098361.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

As a head manager and the best elevator man he seems to enjoy watching films of people dancing on screen but he really doesn’t mind that there’s no sound in the films or whatever even though he does has a unhealthy obsession with jazz music and he believes he can be one day but he should focus on his assassin duties too even tho he doesn’t enjoy the job and he and kitty kit have a sweet relationship they said they know each since they met on a train stop but he doesn’t trust shadow man since he knows what he’s capable of and he’s afraid if he might harm or even do something worse to the ones he trying to protect 

He loves fishing and picking out food from shops but his most favourite are salad and Mac and cheese and egg rice in a bowl but he really likes ice tea and coffee tea but he likes eating coffee beans to get more energy he’s very good at understanding any language and is good at math but he doesn’t mind teaching anyone math or science and he sure loves anything that has wires or dynamite related 

Kitty kit born in August 19 18- ( whatever makes her 25 ) 

A show host and a main star a real sweetheart and charmer 
When she was younger she used to live poor she had a happy childhood until there was bad weather going around they live 
She doesn’t remember her mother much but her father said she was very beautiful and sweet before she pass away when kit was too young to remember 
By the mean time she moved out of the community she was in because she needed to make money for herself but also to help her family and father but she later on forgot and noticed that her father is in a hospital because he’s sick and with a heart disease 
As a show host for a game show she …didn’t make it to see him or had a chance to say goodbye but at least she went to his funeral 
She wanted to be a waitress but noticed how poorly others treated them so she decided to be a game show host instead of a dancer 
She doesn’t likes showing weakness or seeming weak to others and she surely doesn’t like manipulation or abuse since it keeps reminding her what shadow man did to her and treated her like crap 

Her habits are dancing and singing but she really loves cooking and baking and sewing but she’s secretly good at playing on a violin 
She really enjoys eating cooked fish or beef along with rice and she loves shopping for clothes or whatever to inspire herself more

I used to struggle with connecting with people over Zoom until I figured out this neat little trick called anchoring. 

Basically, anchoring is when you throw out a specific piece of info or opinion that can kinda 'anchor' the conversation direction. So, if I'm on a work call, I'll often mention a shared experience or a trend everyone seems to have an opinion on—like binge-watching some popular series or the latest coffee craze. It sorta becomes the 'anchor' for the rest of the chat. 

Once you've set that anchor, people naturally start opening up, sharing their own thoughts, and boom, there you go—a more relaxed and friendly convo. 

So, next time you're stuck staring at faces through a screen, maybe try tossing in an anchor. You'll be surprised how it eases things up. Might not work every single time, but it's worked way more than not for me. 😉",6,1751097938.0,mindHacksToday,0,1.0,False

I’m easing into the day with coffee in hand, thinking I’ll take it slow—until my house help casually asks,
“Akele bore nahi hote?  Jaate bhi nahi ho jyada . Kaise reh lete ho akele?”

I smiled, but it stayed with me. Not because it was offensive just because it’s so common. The assumption that being alone must automatically mean being lonely. That quiet must mean emptiness. That solitude can’t possibly be chosen.

I’m 30, I live alone, and I’m okay. Actually, more than okay. I’ve built a space that feels safe, warm, and mine. I go out when I want to, stay in when I need to, and cherish both laughter-filled evenings with friends and slow, solo mornings with myself.

Is it always easy? No. Some days are heavy. But so are relationships, families, and crowded rooms. The beauty of being alone is in learning to hold space for yourself, to hear your own thoughts, and to find calm in your own rhythm.

So no, I’m not waiting for someone to fill a gap. I’m just living my life fully, quietly, and on my terms.

And I wish that was seen less as an oddity, and more as a valid, even beautiful, way of being.

1lmhgfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1lmhgfw/misjudged_over_a_coffee/,Misjudged Over a Coffee?,"**TLDR:** 

I met a girl through a family-arranged setup after chatting for two weeks. During our brief in-person meeting, she placed the order herself, and I hesitated slightly when asked a personal question. Later, she gave negative feedback, saying I seemed disinterested and slow to respond. I'm now reflecting on whether these were genuine red flags or minor misunderstandings.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
My sister arranged a meeting with a girl (through her in-laws). Our bio data, photograph and numbers were exchanged. We chatted and (sometimes) spoke over the phone for over two weeks. In the first week, we used to chat (or converse) almost every alternate day. In the second week, the conversation started getting less engaging and less frequent. 



Then we decided to meet once on the upcoming Sunday (of the second week). On Saturday evening, I messaged her asking where and at what time we should meet. She replied that she was unwell and had a fever. The mediator then intervened and asked her whether she was really interested in taking it forward. She replied in the affirmative and told them that she liked me, but she need to meet in person first before taking a final call. The mediator then suggested postponing the meeting, and we agreed to meet in the middle of the third week. We finally decided to meet on a weekday at a common location. 



I live in city X and she lives in city Y. We decided to meet at a common point (say city M), which is a 2 hr drive away from my city and 1.5 hrs from hers. Since I've never been to that city before, I let her choose the restaurant. When we both arrived, we sat at the table and started the conversation, which began like:-



\[03:20 PM\]   
*(Some initial small talk - how was the journey, how much time it took to reach here, about the city, etc)*



\[03:26-27 PM\]   
*(While I was talking to her, she interrupted)*  
**(Point 1)**

Her: Lets order something

Me: Yes, sure

Her: Lets order something light as I had a late breakfast 

Me: Yes, same here. Lets order something light

(While I was browsing the menu, she didn't look at it)

Her: Lets order coffee

Me: Yes

*(She herself gave the order to the waiter)*



*(.....Then we had more small talk about work, future plans, etc.)*



\[03:40 PM\]  
**(Point 2)**  
Her: Who are you closest to in your family? Father or mother?

Me: Neither

Her: No, but you've to choose one name. Still, you must be slightly closest to someone in your family.

*(To me its very confusing question, as its hard to choose b/w your parents)*

*(After 10 seconds..)*

Me: Mother

Her: Ok  


*(....After some more small talk about family, etc)*  


\[03:45 PM\]:

Her: Do you want to order something else?

Me: Do you want to?

Her: No

Me: No

Her: So, shall I pay the bill?

Me: No, I'll pay it

Her: No, I'll pay it

Me: No no, let me pay it



*(After paying the bill)*

\[03:50 PM\]

Her: Lets go. You've to drive back to your home and its 2 hrs away. So, you should leave early.

Me: Yes



Then we both left, saying goodbye to each other. The meeting lasted hardly half an hour.



Next day, when the mediator (from my sister in-laws) enquired about the meeting and feedback from her, she raised the following concerns about me:

(i) I didn’t ask her what she would like to order — she had to place the order herself. (see **Point1**)

(ii) When she asked me To whom I'm closest to in my family, I took 10 seconds to reply. According to her, its was a red flag (see **Point2**)

(iii) She felt that I didn’t seem interested in her or in marriage (which I strongly disagree with).



My sister is criticizing me for all the above points, like why I didn't ask her (what she would like to order) on time, and why I took 10 seconds to reply to that question, etc.



**Now, my questions:**

1) How big of an issue is it if I forgot to ask her what she wanted to order within the first 5–7 minutes of the meeting? Was that discourteous? Was it too late? I understand that (as a matter of etiquette) its the boy's responsibility to ask the girl what she would like to have (and on time), but I always thought that it shouldn't be a big issue, especially in the first 10 minutes of the meeting.

2) And if I took 10 seconds to answer a personal question (because I was confused), is that really such a serious issue?

1lmhfz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lmhfz3/the_hour_that_doesnt_belong/,The hour that doesn’t belong,"It started with the man in the brown coat.

He came in just before closing. Every night. Always at 8:57. I would be halfway through wiping down the counters, mop bucket near the back door, the sound system barely clinging to a jazz track with too much reverb. Then I would look up, and there he’d be.

He didn’t make noise when he entered. No bell from the door. No footfalls. Just sudden presence.

He ordered a black coffee. No sugar. No cream. He always held the cup for a long time before speaking.

One night he said it tasted like rainwater in an empty grave. Another night he said it reminded him of a house burning from the inside. Then he would smile and take a seat near the window.

After a week he brought someone with him.

She looked like she had been soaked and dried a dozen times. Canvas coat. Frizzed hair. Eyes too wide, but posture too composed. She never ordered. Just walked the perimeter of the shop like she was mapping it. Her fingers would trail along the walls, pausing on the framed menus and peeling wallpaper.

When I asked if she needed anything, she smiled too hard and said no thank you. I’m just here for Pendleton.

That was his name. I didn’t ask for it. He offered it once, casually, like it no longer belonged to him.

I was Pendleton before I forgot who I was, he said. Macy never forgot. That’s what makes her dangerous.

They became routine. Macy and Pendleton. The strange couple. 8:57, every night. Always the same booth. Always the same silence. They’d sit across from each other and never touch their drinks. Pendleton would sometimes tap his fingers against the side of his mug. Macy would whisper into the air like there was a speaker only she could hear.

Others started coming with them. A teenage boy who only ordered hot water and stared into it like he was watching someone drown. A woman who ordered three lattes and lined them up in front of her before whispering into each one like she was apologizing. A barefoot man who bled from both palms and kept trying to read the nutritional chart on the milk carton.

It felt like they were waiting. All of them. For what, I never figured out.

Then the clocks began acting strange.

Every night at 9:03, the second hand would twitch. Not tick. Not move forward. Just tremble in place, like it was trying to keep time but something stronger was holding it still. The lights would dim, but not flicker. The temperature would rise. My ears would pop like I’d changed altitude.

And they would all go still. Perfectly still. Like statues waiting for permission to breathe.

One night I dropped a glass behind the counter. When I stood up, Macy was standing right in front of me. No footsteps. No warning.

You see it now, she said.

I didn’t respond.

She leaned closer. Her breath smelled like wet fabric and old flowers. The hour that doesn’t belong, she said. Between nine and whatever comes next.

Then she turned around and walked back to the booth. Pendleton nodded when she sat. He raised his mug in my direction. I don’t think he drank from it.

After that, I started locking the doors early. At 8:55. Turned the lights off. Moved the chairs. Pretended we were closed.

It didn’t matter.

They still appeared. Sometimes already seated. Sometimes standing in corners I could’ve sworn were empty seconds before. They didn’t knock. Didn’t ask.

Macy began talking to the espresso machine. Whispering into the steam wand as it hissed back like it understood. Pendleton wrote things on napkins and hid them under the lids at the condiment bar.

One night I found one. It said, When the coffee cools, you’ll remember where the body is.

I threw it away. Then I checked the freezer. Just in case.

The Tuesday after that, they brought the key.

Pendleton placed it on the counter without speaking. It was brass. Worn. Cold even though his hands had held it. Macy stared at me as I picked it up.

You’ll need it, she said. The real door is behind the freezer. When the shop turns inside out, it’s the only way to close it.

I asked, close what?

She didn’t answer.

Pendleton said, “You only get one chance. Don’t waste it.”

They left soon after. I didn’t watch them go.

Since then, I’ve kept the key in my coat pocket.

I haven’t been sleeping. At 9:03 every night, my apartment lights dim the same way the shop lights used to. The mirrors fog over. My phone glitches and flashes like it’s looking for a signal that doesn’t exist.

There’s a knock behind the fridge sometimes. Just once. Always soft. Always measured.

They are still waiting. Or something is.

If Macy was right, the door is waking up. And I am the one holding the key.

If I use it wrong, I don’t think I’ll get a second try. And if I wait too long, I don’t think there’ll be a door left to close.

So I sit. And I wait. And I watch the clock.

When it reaches 9:03, I don’t breathe. I listen.

And I pray the knock doesn’t come.",3,1751097712.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

What's the best way to 1) get informational interviews and 2) conduct the coffee chat? 

I've only managed to set up meetings with people with whom I have some prior connection (went to my uni, met at a conference before, knows people I know). I've been extremely unsuccessful just messaging people on LinkedIn, even when our backgrounds match. During informational interviews, it then seems like people are mainly just interested in whether you can start at a job that they happen to need to fill ASAP, rather than provide any type of career mentoring or advice. I've also heard that you should network pre-emptively, instead of when a job ad is released. This makes a lot of these chats a bit awkward, because the vibe is 'please give me a job when a great position comes out', and from their POV it feels like they're doing you a massive favor.

Was just wondering what the optimal way of going about these coffee chats was? Especially with people from companies that you only have access to via LinkedIn or online.",1,1751097660.0,biotech,0,1.0,False

# Chapter 1

I was locked inside Hollow Creek Psychiatric, eyes glued to my sister’s wedding livestream.

She was glowing. Beautiful. Naive.

Then all hell broke loose.

A woman—naked, drenched in blood—crashed the scene like a horror movie. She dropped to her knees, slamming her head on the marble floor again and again.

“Lily, please! My face is ruined, my clothes are in shreds—you’ve destroyed me. I’m no threat now. Don’t send me back to the asylum. I’ll stay away from Grayson, I swear!”

My baby sister stood frozen at the altar.

Grayson Whitmore, Lily’s new husband, exploded with rage.

“Hit her,” he ordered. “Now.”

Dozens of slaps followed, brutal and fast.

All for show. All to protect that bleeding woman—Aubrey Hayes.

“She’s lived under other people’s roofs her whole life,” Grayson growled. “She’s kind, quiet. And you—you—can’t even make room for her?”

“You’ve been spoiled too long. It ends today. The Whitmores don’t keep venom.”

The wedding died right there. The string quartet stopped. Lily was yanked away, shoved into a black car, and hauled off to some mountaintop monastery to “repent.”

When I saw her again, she wasn’t Lily anymore.

Her face was carved up. Her chest collapsed like something had been broken and never set right. Fingers curled unnaturally, twisted into angles that don’t exist in the living.

No sparkle left in her eyes.

Just silence.

I didn’t cry. I didn’t scream. I walked straight into the office of the facility director, wrapped a restraint strap around his throat, and tightened until he agreed:

Scarlett Moore was going home.

When I opened the door to our house, Mom flinched so hard she dropped her keys.

She yanked me inside like the walls had ears.

Dad lay on the bed, stiff and still. The kind of stillness that only comes after heartbreak kills the body before death does.

“Lily’s gone,” Mom choked. “Your father went to confront Grayson.”

He never came back whole.

\----

Grayson didn’t even try to hide it. When he heard Lily was dead, he blinked like he hadn’t expected the game to end so fast.

Aubrey Hayes lounged beside him, lipstick perfect, venom in her smile.

“Dead?” she snorted. “That’s funny. Just got a video—she looked perfectly asleep to me.”

She tapped her phone, and there Lily was.

Still. Pale. Beautiful. Like a doll waiting to wake up.

Dad’s fist slammed the coffee table hard enough to splinter wood.

“My daughter’s body is cold in the morgue, covered in wounds! And you’re laughing?”

Grayson shot to his feet, rage darkening his eyes. “Enough! Lily’s playing victim again? What, she dragged her father into the circus now?”

“You Moores are all the same. Lies, drama, guilt games.”

Aubrey smirked from the leather sofa. “Mr. Moore, your act is embarrassing.”

Grayson didn’t flinch. Just flicked his sleeve, looked toward the door.

“Throw him out.”

The bodyguards obeyed. Fast. Efficient.

They broke both his legs before dumping him on the sidewalk.

\----

When Mom told me the rest, I didn’t flinch. I peeled back the white sheet covering my sister’s face.

Her beauty had been turned into a battlefield.

Scars everywhere. Her chest was hollowed out. Her limbs bent in ways that screamed: She suffered.

“She didn’t go peacefully, did she?” Mom whispered behind me, voice shaking.

No. She didn’t.

\----

My name is Scarlett Moore. I’m Lily’s twin.

She was light. I was shadow.

She smiled at strangers. I stared them down. She laughed. I didn’t speak. People called me a freak. A psycho. A monster.

Only Lily ever treated me like I was human.

She’d save her last candy—an orange-flavored Tootsie Pop—and press it into my palm like it was treasure.

“Try it,” she’d say. “It’s sweet, right?”

God, she smiled so easily.

Now her eyes would never open again.

When we were twelve, Northlake Prep’s headmaster’s son set his sights on her.

One day after school, a group of older boys dragged her into an alley.

I followed them quietly.

When she came running out, terrified and bruised, she never saw the blood-covered girl walking behind her.

That night, the moon was high and full.

By dawn, the headmaster’s family was dead.

Police found me sitting in the middle of it all, covered in gore, smiling as I counted the candy wrappers she used to leave behind for me.

They said I was insane.

They locked me in Hollow Creek.

The windows there had iron bars.

Every time Lily visited, she’d press her cheek to the cold steel and grin.

“Scarlett,” she’d whisper. “The cherry blossoms on Seabrook Cove are blooming. It’s so pretty today.”

I never spoke. But she’d always chatter on, sharing her joy with me.

The last time I saw her, she was extremely happy and told me she was getting married.

She promised to livestream it for me. “Tell me if I look beautiful in my dress!”

But the wedding never finished. They broke her before the vows could finish.

Now?

I’m free.

And whoever hurt my sister?

Will beg to die before I’m through.

# Chapter 2

After taking care of Lily’s funeral, I stepped into the house, her urn clutched tightly in my arms.

The front door slammed open with a loud bang.

Aubrey strutted in on Grayson’s arm, heels clicking against the hardwood, a sneer tugging at her lips.

“Well, well... Look who’s risen from the grave—Miss Moore herself.”

Grayson’s eyes landed on the urn in my hands. His expression flickered—almost a hint of guilt.

But the second he saw my face, it vanished. Replaced by ice.

“Really, Lily? Faking your death for sympathy?” His voice dripped with disgust. “That’s a new low—even for you.”

Aubrey giggled, clinging to his arm like a parasite.

“Grayson only sent you to the monastery for a few days of quiet reflection. And now? You assault a retreat leader, show up waving around an urn, acting like the tragic heroine.”

She tilted her head, mock-concerned. “What’s next? Luring Grayson to a fake funeral with this bargain-bin box?”

She suddenly reached out for it. “Let me guess—trash day special?”

I stepped aside. She stumbled forward with a shriek, nearly hitting the floor.

“Lily!” Grayson barked. “How long are you going to keep this up? Faking your death wasn’t enough? Now you’re pushing Aubrey too?”

Aubrey clutched her ankle, eyes glinting through the fake tears.

“I know she resents me... for ruining her wedding. But Grayson, don’t blame her—it’s all my fault…”

Grayson’s expression hardened. “Lily, apologize to Aubrey. Right now.”

I said nothing. Didn’t flinch. I held Lily’s urn with both hands like it was the only thing keeping me grounded.

Mom stepped forward, planting herself between us. Her voice trembled with fury.

“Get out! Neither of you is welcome here!”

Grayson’s temper flared. He grabbed my wrist roughly. “This is how the Moore family raises its daughters?”

“You won’t learn the easy way? Fine—take her back. She stays until she learns some manners.”

I yanked my hand away and gave him a cold, dead-eyed smile.

“Gladly.”

That threw him off. He paused for a beat, confused by my calm.

I walked to the memorial table, set the urn down with quiet reverence, and gently traced my sister’s smiling face in the photo frame. She still looked so sweet. Just like when she’d sneak candy into my hand, eyes sparkling like it was the biggest secret in the world.

As I turned to leave, Mom caught my arm.

“Scarlett...” she whispered, voice breaking. Her eyes shimmered with grief and helplessness.

I squeezed her hand gently.

She let out a heavy breath and slowly released me. “Alright, go.”

I nodded once and walked out without looking back.

Aubrey was already curled up in the passenger seat, voice dripping sugar.

“Grayson, I think something got in my eye\~”

He leaned in without hesitation, blowing softly, their noses almost touching. Breath to breath. Their intimacy was sickening.

They didn’t even remember I was in the backseat.

Aubrey gave me a sideways glance, her lips curling in a victorious smirk.

I said nothing. I sat perfectly still, eyes cast down, a statue carved from ice.

The car cut through the winding mountain roads, the monastery drawing closer with every mile.

But all I felt was fire in my veins. A hunger that couldn’t be fed. They had taken Lily from me. And I would never forgive that.

The radio suddenly crackled to life, static tearing through the silence.

“Urgent alert: A highly dangerous patient has escaped Hollow Creek Psychiatric Facility. All citizens are advised to remain cautious…”

The two up front didn’t even blink.

I leaned back into the seat, eyes fixed on the back of their oblivious heads.

And smiled.

Silently. Coldly.

1lmhdc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmexPlatinum/comments/1lmhdc3/perks_on_finnish_platinum/,Perks on Finnish Platinum,"Any Finnish platinum card holders here? How do you like the perks in the card?

I've had it now almost for a year, and thus my promotion time is soon about to end and I could end the contract without penalty. I initially got €350 worth of points, monthly fee being €65. I am generally happy with the card and plan to keep it.

Flying several times a year most value I get is from the lounge benefit. And then naturally free visits to the Pier Zero restaurant in Helsinki Airport. Nowadays I usually go to the airport several hours early, have a proper breakfast/lunch and then work in the lounge until boarding (with a sip of whiskey on side ;-)

I also find the Dine by Amex benefit quite good, much better than the restaurant credit given in some countries. With this you get 6 times a year dinner for two in selected fine dining restaurants (including main course and appetizer or desert, all drinks and other cost extra). I normally don't go much to higher end restaurant, so this forces you out regularly. And I usually order couple of drinks and maybe the desert on the side, so I think this is quite good deal to all parties.

Also the gold level (or equivalent) status in some hotel chains and car rentals is good plus. Especially the 20% promo code on Melia hotels three times a year (if you visit Spain often...)

I've seen people complain about that perks have gotten worse than they used to be in Finland. I think there was some free coffee on trains etc.. ? I would not use those much anyway, but was there something that people really miss?

Main pain points for me are:
 *  the card is not universally accepted in Europe (so you have to always carry extra backup card)
 * Finnish Amex is not supported in Google Wallet
 * you cannot get any more than one extra card, and not possible to get separate bill for secondary card
 * some airlines (at least Finnair and Norwegian) have extra fee for using Amex
 * as you cannot be 100% sure that the card is always accepted, trusting card's travel insurance alone is bit risky, unless you have all the hotels etc. prepaid with the Amex
 * 2% fee on non-Euro charges, so I prefer to use Revolut in those


That being said, I try to use the card as much as possible. Even if the extra points are not so valuable to me (value you get is only 0.35 cents from each Euro spent), more money Amex can get out of my usage, hopefully better benefits they are able to provide in future. Any good hints what would be the most value for using the points (beside the easy way of just using them directly to pay part of the Amex bill)?

1lmhabg,https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/1lmhabg/need_tips_for_defect_a20_maybe_a20_in_general/,Need tips for Defect A20 (maybe A20 in general),"I posted a few weeks ago about my struggling on the Silent on A17, and I've received a lot of useful tips from everyone here so I'm asking once more because I'm facing a wall now. It's even more frustrating that I consider Defect my main since the beginning, I have the most time spent on him and I think I know and have played at least once every strategy he has. And still, I can't manage to push through for a win (I am not aiming for the Heart now, but I will do it probably after achieving A20 on everyone).

How I generally perceive the character :
- I think Defect is very strong early game, I've noticed Dualcast alone can trivialize most if not all easy fights, and help a lot throughout all of Act 1, therefore I'm not afraid to go in normal fights
- I usually path for at least 3 to 4 campfires because I find Defect to be the most reliant on upgrades (Zap early game, Hologram, Defrag, only to name a few), this doesn't seem to hurt Act 1
- I usually path for 2 Elites Act 1, 0-1 Elite Act 2 (they are THE run enders, I lose the most to them, seriously these guys are atrocious, all of them besides Gremlin maybe) and 2 Elites when I reach Act 3 (rarely, because I die Act 2)
- I don't have strong opinions on boss relics, I don't mind Coffee if I have Self-Repair or bird faced urn, Hammer if I have upgraded my most important cards... maybe the one I avoid the most is Philo Stone because Defect only has a single card reducing enemy damage and I feel I'd be overwhelmed by the strength
- I don't consider a boss swap for Defect, as the initial orb really helps for chip damage, or just enables Dualcast right away ; I will usually pick anything as long as the downside is manageable (curse -> early shop, cost all gold -> no shop early, etc)
- I try not to force archetypes, I know it's a common mistake that can mislead you into taking cards that don't give immediate value, although Coolheaded, Glacier, Electrodynamics are usually instant picks if I'm not actively playing a Reprogram deck, and Echo Form is an auto pick regardless
- I try to use cards that I didn't play up until now, notably Stack, Consume, Skim if I have the energy for it, really I'm trying new things if I can
- I don't remove all that much, I mean I am not doing it aggressively like I would be on Watcher for example, but it would usually be the very last thing I do on a shop, if I have the money for it

And considering all of that, I often find myself in awkward situations where I lack the pieces I need at any given time. I also sometimes lack immediate value, maybe because I think the Defect is kind of a setup character, that builds up crazy momentum with powers. Problem is, I get punished by block/attack checks a lot, and trying all sorts of cards does not seem to help. Also I have trouble going into the double boss, which is an issue, but really I'm struggling in Act 2 I think. The reason I didn't struggle A17-A19 is probably because I had very stupid luck and had godlike power/reprogram decks, but now I have to play without luck. So, what things am I doing wrong ?",1,1751097072.0,slaythespire,0,1.0,False
1lmh98c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_book_writing/comments/1lmh98c/chatgpt_prompts_for_lawyers_7_powerful_hacks_to/,ChatGPT Prompts for Lawyers: 7 Powerful Hacks to Draft Contracts Like a Pro,"# ChatGPT Prompts for Lawyers: 7 Powerful Hacks to Draft Contracts Like a Pro

Alright, let's have a real talk. You're a lawyer. You're smart, you're driven, and you're probably buried under a mountain of paperwork. And let’s be honest, a good chunk of that is contract drafting. The endless loop of finding the right template, tweaking clauses, and making sure you haven't left a gaping hole that could sink your client later... it's a grind. What if I told you there’s a way to make it less of a grind? That’s where learning to use effective **ChatGPT prompts for lawyers** comes in.

Think of ChatGPT not as a replacement for your brilliant legal mind, but as the world's most eager, lightning-fast paralegal who’s had way too much coffee. It can’t give legal advice, but it can handle the grunt work of drafting, brainstorming, and refining language, freeing you up to focus on strategy, negotiation, and high-level analysis. The secret is knowing exactly how to ask.

This isn't about telling ChatGPT to ""write a contract."" That's a rookie move. This is about using specific, powerful **ChatGPT prompts for lawyers** to bend the AI to your will and turn it into a contract-drafting superpower. Ready to level up your workflow? Let's dive in.

# A HUGE, BOLD, CAN'T-MISS DISCLAIMER

Before we go any further, let's put on our serious lawyer hats for a second. This is critical.

1. **CONFIDENTIALITY IS KING:** Never, ever, ever input confidential or privileged client information into a public AI model like ChatGPT. Assume everything you type is being seen. Use anonymized data and hypothetical situations ONLY. Your duty of confidentiality is paramount.
2. **AI IS NOT A LAWYER:** ChatGPT is a language tool, not a licensed attorney. It has no ethical duties, it doesn't understand legal nuances in a human way, and it can be confidently wrong (we call this ""hallucinating"").
3. **YOU ARE THE LAWYER:** Every single word that comes out of ChatGPT must be reviewed, verified, edited, and approved by you. You are ultimately responsible for the work product.

Think of this as a tool to create a first draft or brainstorm ideas, not to deliver a final, client-ready document. For more on the official stance, it's worth keeping an eye on guidance from bodies like the [American Bar Association (ABA) on AI](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanbar.org%2Fgroups%2Fbusiness_law%2Fresources%2Fbusiness-law-today%2F2023-august%2Fartificial-intelligence%2F), as ethical rules are constantly adapting to new tech. Okay, disclaimer over. Let's get to the fun stuff.

# Hack #1: The ""Clause Crafter"" for Targeted Drafting

Instead of asking ChatGPT for a full contract, which will give you a generic and often useless template, get surgical. Use it to draft specific, individual clauses by giving it all the necessary context. This is one of the most fundamental **ChatGPT prompts for lawyers** you can master.

The trick is to feed the AI the ""who, what, where, when, and why"" before you ask for the clause.

**The Prompt Template:**  
""Act as a senior corporate lawyer specializing in \[Contract Type, e.g., 'SaaS agreements'\]. I need to draft a \[Clause Name, e.g., 'Confidentiality'\] clause for an agreement between \[Party A Description, e.g., 'a software development company'\] and \[Party B Description, e.g., 'a small retail business'\]. The clause must be \[Specify a legal standard, e.g., 'enforceable in California'\], be \[Specify a tone, e.g., 'heavily protective of the software company'\], and must explicitly include \[Specific Detail 1\] and exclude \[Specific Detail 2\]. Draft the clause.""

**Why It Works:**  
You're not just asking for a clause; you're giving the AI a role, a jurisdiction, the parties' motivations, and specific instructions. This dramatically improves the quality and relevance of the output.

**Example in Action:**  
Let’s try it. ""Act as a senior corporate lawyer specializing in freelance agreements. I need to draft an 'Intellectual Property Rights' clause for an agreement between a marketing agency and a freelance graphic designer. The clause must clearly state that the agency owns all final work product ('work for hire'). It must be enforceable in New York. The designer should retain rights to use the work in their personal portfolio after the project is publicly launched. Draft the clause.""

What you get back is a targeted, well-structured clause that's 80% of the way there, saving you 15-20 minutes of searching through old documents or starting from scratch. That's a win.

# Hack #2: The ""Risk Spotter"" to Think Like Opposing Counsel

Ever wish you could have a quick sparring session to find the weaknesses in your own draft? You can. One of the most powerful **ChatGPT prompts for lawyers** involves asking the AI to switch sides and critique your work. This helps you anticipate arguments and patch holes you might have missed.

**The Prompt Template:**  
""I am drafting a \[Contract Type\] for my client, \[Your Client's Role\]. Below is the \[Clause Name\] clause. Act as a sharp, experienced lawyer representing the opposing party, \[Opposing Party's Role\]. Review this clause and identify 3 potential risks, ambiguities, or points of contention from your client's perspective. For each point, briefly explain why it's a concern.""  
\[Paste your clause here\]

**Why It Works:**  
This prompt forces the AI to change its analytical framework. Instead of being a neutral drafter, it becomes an adversarial reviewer, which is fantastic for pressure-testing your language. It helps you see the contract from the other side of the table before you even get there.

**Example in Action:**  
You've drafted a Limitation of Liability clause. You could prompt: ""I am drafting a Master Services Agreement for my client, a consulting firm. Below is the 'Limitation of Liability' clause. Act as a sharp lawyer representing the client receiving the services. Review this clause and identify 3 potential risks or unfavorable terms. Explain why each is a concern.""  
\[Paste your 'Limitation of Liability' clause\]

ChatGPT might come back with points like: ""The exclusion of 'gross negligence' is missing,"" ""The liability cap is tied to 'fees paid in the last 3 months,' which is too restrictive for a long-term project,"" or ""The clause doesn't specify carve-outs for breaches of confidentiality."" These are golden insights that can strengthen your draft significantly.

# Hack #3: The ""Plain English Translator"" for Happy Clients

Your clients trust you, but they don't always understand you. Explaining dense legalese can eat up valuable time in meetings and emails. Use ChatGPT to bridge that gap. This is less about drafting and more about client service, but it's an incredible productivity hack.

**The Prompt Template:**  
""Explain the following contract clause to a \[Client Persona, e.g., 'first-time startup founder,' 'small business owner with no legal background,' 'head of marketing'\] in simple, clear, plain English. Focus on what it means for them practically and what their key obligations are. Avoid legal jargon.""  
\[Paste the legalese clause here\]

**Why It Works:**  
Clients who understand what they're signing are happier, more confident clients. This prompt saves you the mental energy of code-switching from ""lawyer-speak"" to ""human-speak."" It gives you a great starting point for your client communications.

**Example in Action:**  
Take a complex indemnity clause. You can pop it in and ask ChatGPT to explain it to a non-lawyer. It might start with something like, ""Okay, in simple terms, this part of the contract is like a 'you break it, you buy it' rule, but for legal problems..."" This is a much better way to start a conversation than reading the clause verbatim.

# Hack #4: The ""Alternative Phrasing Generator"" for Negotiation Power

Ever get stuck on a sentence, knowing there's a better way to phrase it but you just can't find the words? Or maybe you need a slightly softer or stronger version for a negotiation. This is a perfect task for an AI that has analyzed billions of sentences. This set of **ChatGPT prompts for lawyers** is all about options.

**The Prompt Template:**  
""Here is a contract clause: \[Paste clause here\]. Provide 3 alternative ways to phrase this. Option 1: Make it more favorable to \[Party A\]. Option 2: Make it more neutral and balanced. Option 3: Make it simpler and more direct, while retaining the core legal meaning.""

**Why It Works:**  
This moves you from a binary ""this or nothing"" mindset to having a spectrum of options. It's fantastic for preparing for negotiations, allowing you to quickly offer a fallback position or a compromise without having to draft it on the fly.

**Example in Action:**  
You have a payment term clause: ""Payment is due within 15 days of receipt of invoice.""  
You can use the prompt, and it might generate:

1. **More Favorable (to service provider):** ""Invoices are due and payable upon receipt...""
2. **More Neutral:** ""Payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following the end of the month in which the invoice was received.""
3. **Simpler:** ""Client agrees to pay all invoices within 15 days.""

Now you have a toolkit of phrases ready for your next negotiation.

# Hack #5: The ""Definition Builder"" for Airtight Clarity

Ambiguity is the enemy of a good contract. The ""Definitions"" section is one of the most important parts for ensuring everyone is on the same page. Use ChatGPT to help you build comprehensive and precise definitions for key terms.

**The Prompt Template:**  
""I am drafting a \[Contract Type\]. I need a comprehensive definition for the term '\[Term to be Defined\]'. The definition should be suitable for this type of agreement and should consider \[Specific Element 1\] and \[Specific Element 2\]. Please include common inclusions and exclusions (carve-outs).""

**Why It Works:**  
Crafting a definition from scratch can be tedious. This prompt leverages the AI's vast knowledge base to pull together standard components of a legal definition, which you can then tailor to your specific transaction.

**Example in Action:**  
""I am drafting a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). I need a comprehensive definition for the term 'Confidential Information'. The definition should be broad enough to cover business plans, financial data, customer lists, and software code. Please include common carve-outs like information that is publicly known or independently developed.""

ChatGPT will generate a robust definition that covers all the key bases, saving you time and ensuring you don't miss a critical component. This is one of the most practical **ChatGPT prompts for lawyers** for day-to-day work.

# Hack #6: The ""Checklist Creator"" to Systemize Your Review

When you review a contract from the other side, it's easy to miss something. Creating a mental checklist for every contract type is inefficient. Instead, have ChatGPT build a customized review checklist for you.

**The Prompt Template:**  
""Act as a meticulous corporate lawyer. I am about to review a \[Contract Type, e.g., 'Commercial Lease Agreement'\] on behalf of my client, the \[Your Client's Role, e.g., 'Tenant'\]. Generate a detailed checklist of key clauses and potential 'red flag' issues I should look for during my review. Organize the checklist by sections like 'Financials,' 'Obligations,' and 'Termination'.""

**Why It Works:**  
This systematizes your review process, reducing the risk of human error. It acts as a safety net, reminding you of clauses or issues that might not be top-of-mind but are still important. It’s about building a repeatable, high-quality process.

**Example in Action:**  
For a commercial lease review, ChatGPT might generate a checklist that includes items like: ""Check for pass-through costs (CAM charges),"" ""Review the 'Use' clause for restrictions,"" ""Analyze the 'Subletting and Assignment' provisions,"" and ""Clarify 'Force Majeure' events."" It’s like having a senior partner giving you a quick rundown before you dive in.

# Hack #7: The ""Scenario Tester"" to Stress-Test Your Clauses

This is a more advanced hack, but it’s incredibly powerful for spotting practical weaknesses. Instead of just analyzing the language of a clause, you ask the AI to apply it to a hypothetical situation.

**The Prompt Template:**  
""Below is a \[Clause Name\] from a contract. I want you to analyze it based on a hypothetical scenario. The Clause: \[Paste your clause here\] The Scenario: \[Describe a specific event, e.g., 'The service provider experiences a major data breach caused by a third-party vendor.'\] Based on the clause provided, what is the likely outcome or argument for \[Party A\]? What is the likely argument for \[Party B\]?""

**Why It Works:**  
This moves beyond pure textual analysis into practical application. It helps you see how a clause might actually function when things go wrong, which is precisely when contracts matter most. It can reveal unintended consequences or ambiguities that only become apparent when a specific fact pattern is applied.

**Example in Action:**  
You can use this to test a Force Majeure clause against a scenario like a pandemic, a supply chain disruption, or a specific type of natural disaster. The AI's analysis can give you valuable insights into whether your clause is robust enough to handle real-world events.

# The Art of the Perfect Prompt: Best Practices

Mastering **ChatGPT prompts for lawyers** comes down to a few core principles:

* **Give it a Role:** Start with ""Act as a..."" to prime the AI.
* **Provide Rich Context:** The more details you provide (jurisdiction, parties, goals), the better the output.
* **Be Specific in Your Ask:** Don't say ""make it better."" Say ""make it more favorable to the licensor.""
* **Iterate:** Your first prompt won't be your last. Treat it like a conversation. Refine your prompt based on the AI's answer.

# Conclusion: Your New AI-Powered Workflow

Look, AI isn't going to take your job. But a lawyer who knows how to effectively use AI will be far more productive than one who doesn't.

By mastering these seven hacks and learning the art of crafting specific **ChatGPT prompts for lawyers**, you can slash the time you spend on the tedious parts of contract drafting. This means more time for strategy, more time for clients, and maybe—just maybe—a little less time buried under that mountain of paperwork.

So go ahead, open up that chat window, and give one of these prompts a try. Your future, more productive self will thank you.",1,1751096948.0,AI_book_writing,0,1.0,False

One night I just snapped and rewrote my resume like it was a fanfic character. Added skills I didn’t actually have, projects I never did, even made up a fake consulting gig that sounded fancy but was really just me helping my cousin with his site once.

Applied to a bunch of jobs. Got some interviews. Learned some buzzwords, watched a ton of YouTube tutorials, and just hoped no one would dig too deep. And then one company actually hired me. Remote job, decent pay, full benefits. I almost passed out lol.

First month was rough. Imposter syndrom, googling everything, constantly panicking whenever someone Slacked me. But I kept showing up. Kept learning. Faked confidence until it didnt feel fake anymore.

Fast forward like six months and now I’m… actually kinda good at this? Like people come to *me* with questions. I hit my KPIs. I trained the new intern last week. My boss called me a “core team member” and I almost spit my coffee out.

I still feel weird about how it started. But also if I hadnt lied, I never would’ve even gotten the chance. And now I’m not really lying anymore. I *am* that person. Just took a weird detour to get here.

Maybe the whole system’s broken if the only way to get in is to pretend you already belong.

**Title: A Light at the End of the Tunnel**  
*(A song for the r /Realtors community)*

**\[Verse 1\]**  
Scrollin' through the feed with my coffee in hand  
It's the same ol' thread from another burned-out land  
""How do I get leads?""—asked for the thousandth time  
And some VA from Bali just dropped their link in a rhyme  
There's a pay-per-close wizard with a Photoshop grin  
Promisin' gold but deliverin' nothin' within

**\[Verse 2\]**  
Someone’s knockin’ doors like it’s 1994  
Sayin’ “Just listed!” while prayin’ they don’t get ignored  
Another agent’s cryin’ 'bout buyers gone ghost  
While the sellers keep dreamin’ of the 2021 boast  
We're ventin', we’re rantin’, we’re tired and bruised  
But somehow this crazy subreddit still pulls us through

**\[Chorus\]**  
But there’s a light at the end of the tunnel, my friend  
You ain’t alone, this grind will bend but it won’t end  
Yeah, the market’s tight and the pipelines dry  
But a deal's still out there under that cloudy sky  
So we post, we cope, we joke and we scroll  
And hold on tight to a sliver of soul

**\[Verse 3\]**  
The brokers are quiet, the phones rarely ring  
But the group chat’s alive when you need to scream  
You’ve got memes, you’ve got grief, you’ve got one last hope  
That Zillow buyers won’t all be “just lookin’ folks”  
There’s advice from a vet who’s been through this storm  
Sayin’, “Keep showin’ up, it’ll turn back to warm”

**\[Chorus\]**  
There’s a light at the end of the tunnel, my friend  
Even if your last client ghosted again  
You’ve got scripts, you’ve got grit, you’ve got hustle and smarts  
And that messy lockbox still holdin’ your heart  
So we post, we cope, we laugh through the pain  
We’re the kings and queens of closin' in the rain

**\[Bridge\]**  
So raise your Red Bulls, your Starbucks, your mugs  
To the ones still prospectin’ and handin’ out hugs  
You’re more than a pipeline or deal that fell through  
You’re a fighter, a Realtor — and we see you

**\[Final Chorus\]**  
Yeah, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel, for real  
It’s not in a DM, or some cold-caller’s deal  
It’s in hard work, connection, the long follow-up  
In the strangers you help when life’s been rough  
So we post, we cope, we rise and we grind  
The subreddit’s loud, but we’re one of a kind

**\[Outro\]**  
In a sea full of spam and virtual spam bots  
We’re the heart that keeps beatin’ when the market forgot  
So chin up, dear Realtor, through struggle and strife—  
There *is* a light at the end of this life.",1,1751096200.0,realtors,1,1.0,False

1lmgzok,https://www.reddit.com/r/summariseme/comments/1lmgzok/20250628_mental_health_todays_headlines_hope_june/,"(2025-06-28) Mental Health Todays Headlines Hope June 28, 2025","## Mental Health News Roundup: June 28, 2025

The morning of June 28, 2025, saw a diverse range of news emerge from the mental health sphere, encompassing both cutting-edge research and practical health advice, punctuated by anxieties fueled by broader societal issues. The following synthesis provides a comprehensive overview of these developments, highlighting key takeaways and offering a glimpse into the evolving landscape of mental well-being.

One of the most pressing areas of concern, and a recurring theme throughout several reports, revolves around physical health and its interconnectedness with mental stability. A neurologist highlighted the importance of preventative measures in several contexts. This included practical guidance on navigating potential health risks, a checklist for ""safe passage"" through challenging situations. The critical intersection of lifestyle choices and mental health was further emphasized, with the assertion that ""lifestyle correction is not just an option, it is required in the earliest years of your life."" This speaks to the need for proactive and early interventions in fostering overall well-being.

Weight management, an area with significant psychological implications, also received substantial attention. News highlighted the efficacy of new weight-loss drugs and their impact on mental health. Studies showed weight loss in users of new drugs by almost 10 to 15 per cent. Several reports also touched on the role of diet and physical activity, emphasizing the crucial link between nutrition and mental state. A report on coffee consumption underscored this relationship, noting that drinking coffee without sugar or cream could lower the risk of death by 14%. Simultaneously, it was also stated that ""many people think only exercise matters; it doesn't matter where calories come from so long as you burn them.""

Medical advancements and their psychological implications were also prominent. The advent of new medications, such as Orforglipron, offering improved absorption and efficacy, was detailed. The crucial role of early therapies and inclusive education for individuals with Down syndrome was highlighted, showcasing their potential to develop real-world skills when provided with appropriate support. Furthermore, the progress made in HIV prevention, with Phase 3 trials showing that 99.9% of people remained HIV-negative with two annual shots, underscores the significant positive impact of advancements in medicine on public health and individual well-being.

The intersection of mental health and technology was also explored. One concerning trend identified was the tendency of ChatGPT users to ""get lazier with each subsequent essay, often resorting to copy-and-paste."" This raises questions about the impact of AI tools on cognitive engagement and the development of critical thinking skills, with potential implications for mental acuity and creative expression.

Beyond pharmaceutical and technological advancements, the importance of lifestyle choices continued to dominate the news. The use of ""alternative therapy"" by scientists was mentioned in a specific case, suggesting the importance of varied practices to find balance. The dangers of misinformation regarding sunscreens and perfumes, potentially leading to increased anxieties, were emphasized, demonstrating the importance of clear communication and public education in mental health.

The report also touched upon the complexity of understanding health conditions. Reports stated the need to know what aneurysms, AVMs, and trigeminal neuralgia are all about. Knowing these conditions and when to consult a doctor was also deemed important.

The broader societal climate, including immigration and related anxieties, also contributed to the mental health discussion. News regarding an ICE arrest of an Iranian couple in LA, which resulted in the woman suffering a panic attack, underscores the vulnerability of individuals facing legal and personal challenges and the resulting stress.

Overall, the mental health news from June 28, 2025, paints a picture of an evolving landscape where physical and mental well-being are intertwined. The reports highlight the importance of early interventions, balanced lifestyles, and robust health information while providing insights into the impact of technological advancements and societal challenges on mental health. The information suggests that the pursuit of well-being is multifaceted, requiring a combination of medical advancements, lifestyle adjustments, and proactive mental health awareness.

1lmgwfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1lmgwfq/imagining_us/,Imagining Us,"Hey you,

Wherever you are. Whoever you are.

I think about you more than I probably should. Not as some perfect fantasy, but as a real person I haven’t met yet but already miss. You're my future. My dream. My peace. My chaos. The person I want to laugh with, fight with, build with, sleep beside, wake up next to and figure it all out with.

I imagine us being a team. One of those rare, unbreakable ones. The kind where even the worst days don’t win because we’ve got each other to come home to. A safe place in a world that can be so damn loud. A sanctuary built on inside jokes, deep talks, shared silence and a kind of touch that speaks louder than words.

But that’s not all this is.

Because right now, in this moment, I'm thinking of you. Longing for you. Craving you and not just physically. I crave the way you'd look at me when you're tired but still trying to stay awake just to hear my voice. The way you'd smile mid conversation because you’re happy and don’t even know why. I crave the comfort of your presence, the pull of your energy, the quiet knowing that this... this is where I belong.

I look forward to the small things. Cuddling under a blanket while some show plays in the background we’re barely watching. Talking shit about characters, making bold claims like “we could write better,” and knowing damn well we couldn’t. Walking through city streets or quiet trails, watching the world but always looking at each other more.

I imagine your hand in mine as we travel, sometimes near, sometimes far. Making memories not because the scenery is beautiful (though it is) but because I’m seeing it all with you, and when I look at you, I know the view can’t compare.

I think about the photo I’ll take of you, the one that becomes my favorite thing. My phone background. My screensaver. My safe space when we’re apart. I’ll look at it when I need to breathe. When I miss you. When the world’s too much and I need a reminder that there’s still something, *someone* waiting for me on the other side of the day.

I want the messages. Your name lighting up my screen. A photo. A voice note. A stupid meme. Something soft. Something sexy. Something random and every time, my heart flickers. Because you're out there. Thinking of me too.

I want to come home to you. After a long, draining day. I want the way your presence rewrites everything. The stress, the boredom, the bullshit, it all dissolves when you wrap your arms around me and I remember what matters.

And yeah… I want to learn you.

Every curve. Every freckle. Every insecurity. Every turn on. Every strange little habit that makes you *you.*

Because you won’t just be my partner. You’ll be my best friend. My safe space. My favorite distraction. My deepest obsession.

And if you're still reading, I want you to keep going.

Because I want you to know what I think about when my mind drifts into darker, hotter places. The part where love meets control. Where affection becomes dominance. Where vulnerability becomes power and surrender is sacred.

I want you on your knees.

Not because I told you to, but because you *need* to be there. Because you trust me to take you to the edge and pull you back whole. Because every cell in your body is tuned to my voice, my touch, my command.

You’ll look up at me, eyes wide, lips parted, thighs already trembling and I’ll make you wait. Because control is mine and giving in will taste even sweeter when I say you’re allowed.

I want you dressed just how I like, maybe in that tight little uniform I picked out, that short skirt you pretend not to love, those stockings hugging your thighs just so or maybe nothing at all, except for the blush on your cheeks and the ache between your legs.

I want to take my time.

To circle you. Tease you. Strip you down not just physically, but mentally. I want your mind soft and open, your breath shaky, your thoughts reduced to one truth: *You belong to me.*

You’ll feel my hand on your throat. My lips brushing your ear. My words, low, filthy, precise, burning through every defense. I’ll praise you when you’re perfect. I’ll punish you when you need it. I’ll leave my marks, fingers, teeth, whip, belt, painted on your skin like a promise.

And when I finally take you, it won’t be sweet. It’ll be *devastating*. My hands on your hips, dragging you back into every thrust. My grip tightening when you try to squirm. My voice cutting through the moans with commands you’ll follow before your brain even catches up.

I want your legs shaking. Your voice breaking. Your body wrecked and beautiful and fully *mine.*

And then, when it’s over, I want you soft again. Curled against me, skin sticky, heart racing, breath evening out as my fingers trace circles on your back. I’ll kiss your forehead, whisper how proud I am, how good you did. Because what we just shared wasn’t just sex, it was *ours.*

The surrender. The safety. The intensity. The *intimacy.*

You give me your submission. I give you everything.

But this love? It’s not all fire and sweat and breathless nights.

It’s game nights and goofy laughs. It’s you yelling at a screen while I pretend not to be aroused by how competitive you get. It’s us sitting side by side, controllers in hand, swearing we’ll stop “after one more round” that turns into hours.

It’s losing to you on purpose, then trying too hard when I swear I’m not. It’s you sitting in my lap, still gaming, while I kiss your neck just to distract you. It’s “winner gets a kiss,” and “loser gets punished” and us forgetting who won halfway through because we’re too busy loving each other through the nonsense.

It’s trying new hobbies. Getting into weird board games. Movie marathons. Building LEGO sets at midnight. Dancing like idiots in the kitchen. It’s laughter and lightness wrapped around all the deeper things.

And someday… maybe it's not just us.

I imagine raising a family with you.

Seeing you hold a child we made together, half you, half me, all heart. Watching you read bedtime stories in silly voices, kiss scraped knees, cry at school plays. I want to be beside you through all of it, the chaos, the noise, the exhaustion, the magic.

We’ll be tired. We’ll be stretched thin. But we’ll also be full. Of love. Of purpose. Of memories we’ll carry for a lifetime.

And I’ll fall for you all over again, watching you parent. Watching you love. Watching you *choose* us every single day.

And when they’re finally asleep and the world is quiet, I’ll pull you close again. Because even after the diapers, the dishes, the deadlines, you’ll still be the one I want to whisper filth to, to make blush, to make mine.

So yeah, I want the sex. The passion. The slow burns and the fast breaks. The control. The surrender.

But I also want the Sunday mornings.

The coffee and games. The errands. The silly moments. The boring stuff. The family. The life.

Because you’re not just the one I want to fuck.

You’re the one I want to live for.

So wherever you are, if one day you read this, lying next to me, scrolling through the words I once wrote while missing someone I hadn’t met yet....

Just know, baby….

# The Surprising Link: Why Teacher Prompts Overlap with ChatGPT Prompts for Marketing

Before we dive into the prompts, let's talk about this weird connection between a history classroom and a marketing boardroom. It all boils down to one word: **empathy**.

As a teacher, your job is to understand your students' minds. What do they know? What confuses them? How can you present information in a way that clicks? You need to understand their perspective to guide them to a new one.

Guess what? That's exactly what a marketer does. A marketer needs to understand their audience's mind. What are their problems (pain points)? What do they desire? How can we present a product or service in a way that clicks? See the parallel?

This is why a prompt designed to make a student analyze a character's motivation is structurally identical to a **ChatGPT prompt for marketing** designed to build a customer persona. Both require stepping into someone else's shoes. This is your secret advantage. Let's start using it.

# Prompt #1: The Devil's Advocate

This is a classic for a reason! It forces students to move beyond their own biases and argue for the opposing viewpoint, strengthening their understanding of the entire issue.

**🍎 For the Classroom:**  
""You are a skilled debater. Take the opposing side of the argument that \[insert topic, e.g., 'the internet has made us smarter'\]. Write a compelling 300-word argument for why the internet has actually hindered human intelligence, using at least two specific examples.""

**💡 The Marketing Twist:**  
In marketing, playing devil's advocate is called ""competitive analysis."" You have to think like your competitor to beat them.

**Here's your ChatGPT prompt for marketing:**  
""You are the head of marketing for our competitor, \[Competitor's Name\]. My company is launching a new \[product type, e.g., 'eco-friendly water bottle'\]. Write a memo to your team outlining the major weaknesses of our new product and how your company can exploit them in your advertising.""

# Prompt #2: The Socratic Questioner

Instead of giving answers, the Socratic method uses a series of questions to help students discover the answers themselves. It's all about questioning assumptions.

**🍎 For the Classroom:**  
""You are a Socratic tutor. My student believes \[insert common belief, e.g., 'all fats are unhealthy'\]. Your goal is to help them question this assumption without giving them the answer. Ask me five probing questions that challenge the premise and encourage deeper thinking.""

**💡 The Marketing Twist:**  
Marketers use this to uncover a customer's true ""pain points."" Customers often state a surface-level problem, but the real issue lies deeper.

**Here's your ChatGPT prompt for marketing:**  
""You are a market research expert conducting a customer interview. A potential customer says, 'I need a new project management software because my team is disorganized.' Using the Socratic method, ask five follow-up questions to uncover the root cause of their disorganization and their deeper emotional frustrations.""

# Prompt #3: The Role-Play Scenario

This is all about building empathy by forcing students to inhabit another person's perspective, whether it's a historical figure or a character in a novel.

**🍎 For the Classroom:**  
""You are \[Character/Historical Figure, e.g., 'Julius Caesar after crossing the Rubicon'\]. Write a diary entry explaining your thoughts, fears, and motivations for this momentous decision. Focus on the emotional conflict you're experiencing.""

**💡 The Marketing Twist:**  
This is the absolute core of creating ""customer personas"" or ""user avatars."" You have to deeply understand your target audience. This is one of the most fundamental **ChatGPT prompts for marketing**.

**Here's your ChatGPT prompt for marketing:**  
""You are 'Busy Brian,' a 35-year-old project manager with two young kids and limited free time. Write a 'day in the life' description from Brian's perspective, focusing on his daily challenges, frustrations with his current tools, and what he secretly wishes for to make his life easier. This will help us market our new productivity app.""

# Prompt #4: The Historical Detective

This prompt encourages students to look at events not just as facts, but as a chain of cause and effect, analyzing the context that led to a specific outcome.

**🍎 For the Classroom:**  
""You are a historical detective. Analyze the key social, economic, and political factors that led to the \[historical event, e.g., 'the start of the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain'\]. Present your findings as a report, highlighting the most significant 'clues' or causes.""

**💡 The Marketing Twist:**  
Marketers do this to understand market trends and predict where the industry is heading. They analyze past data to inform future strategy.

**Here's your ChatGPT prompt for marketing:**  
""You are a market analyst. Analyze the key technological and cultural shifts over the last 5 years that have led to the rise of \[industry trend, e.g., 'the subscription box model'\]. Identify three key 'causes' and explain how our company can leverage this trend.""

# Prompt #5: The ""5 Whys"" Root Cause Analysis

This technique, borrowed from engineering, involves asking ""Why?"" five times to drill down from a symptom to its root cause. It's a fantastic problem-solving tool.

**🍎 For the Classroom:**  
""Let's use the '5 Whys' technique. The problem is: 'The main character in \[Book Title\] made a terrible decision in Chapter 10.' Start with that, and ask 'Why?' five times to uncover their deep-seated motivation for that action.""

**💡 The Marketing Twist:**  
This is used to analyze customer feedback, especially complaints. A single bad review can point to a much deeper product or service flaw. This is a very tactical **ChatGPT prompt for marketing**.

**Here's your ChatGPT prompt for marketing:**  
""Let's use the '5 Whys' technique. The customer complaint is: 'Your shipping is too slow.' Drill down five times to find the potential root cause. For example: Why is it slow? -> Because it takes 2 days to process. Why does it take 2 days? -> etc. Explore a possible chain of reasons.""

# Prompt #6: The Future Forecaster

This prompt pushes students beyond what did happen to what could happen, encouraging predictive and strategic thinking based on current knowledge.

**🍎 For the Classroom:**  
""Based on the events at the end of Chapter 3 of \[Book Title\], you are a literary critic. Predict three possible ways the plot could develop from here. For each prediction, provide one piece of evidence from the text that supports your theory.""

**💡 The Marketing Twist:**  
This is literally what strategic marketing is all about: planning for the future. It’s used to brainstorm product launch strategies and campaign rollouts.

**Here's your ChatGPT prompt for marketing:**  
""You are a marketing strategist. We are launching a new \[product\] in 3 months. Based on current market conditions and our competitor's likely reactions, outline two possible future scenarios for our launch: one 'best-case' and one 'worst-case.' For each, suggest key actions we should take.""

# Prompt #7: The Ethical Dilemma

Nothing sparks debate like a good ethical quandary! This forces students to weigh competing values and justify their moral reasoning.

**🍎 For the Classroom:**  
""Present a short ethical dilemma: A student finds a wallet full of money on the last day of school. They know who it belongs to, and that person is wealthy and won't miss it. The finder's family is struggling financially. What should they do? Act as a moral philosopher and analyze this choice through the lens of both utilitarianism and deontology.""

**💡 The Marketing Twist:**  
This helps define a brand's voice, mission, and values. How a brand navigates ethical issues (sustainability, data privacy, social stances) is a massive part of its marketing. As noted by educational bodies like [ISTE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iste.org%2Fiste-standards%2Fiste-standards-for-students), responsible digital citizenship is a key skill, and this applies to brands too.

**Here's your ChatGPT prompt for marketing:**  
""You are a brand strategist. Our company wants to create an 'Ethical Marketing' pledge. Brainstorm five core principles for this pledge, covering topics like data privacy, advertising transparency, and sustainability. For each principle, write a short, customer-facing statement.""

# Prompt #8: The Analogy Builder

Complex ideas are often best understood through analogy or metaphor. This prompt trains students to find connections between disparate concepts.

**🍎 For the Classroom:**  
""Explain the concept of \[complex topic, e.g., 'photosynthesis'\] using an analogy of something completely different, like a factory or a kitchen. Describe the inputs, the process, and the outputs in your analogy.""

**💡 The Marketing Twist:**  
This is the heart and soul of creative copywriting and advertising! Marketers are constantly looking for powerful analogies to make their product's benefits feel simple and relatable.

**Here's your ChatGPT prompt for marketing:**  
""We need a powerful analogy to sell our new cloud storage service, which is incredibly secure. Generate three different analogies that explain the concept of 'digital security' to a non-technical audience. For example, 'It's like a Swiss bank vault for your files.'""

# Prompt #9: The ""Explain It Like I'm 5"" Simplifier

The ultimate test of understanding is being able to explain something simply. This forces students to distill a topic to its absolute essence.

**🍎 For the Classroom:**  
""You are a science communicator. Explain the theory of \[complex theory, e.g., 'plate tectonics'\] in a way that an intelligent 5-year-old could understand. Use simple words and avoid jargon.""

**💡 The Marketing Twist:**  
This is used to create a ""Value Proposition"" – a crystal-clear statement of the benefit you offer. If you can't explain your value simply, customers won't get it. This is a crucial **ChatGPT prompt for marketing**.

**Here's your ChatGPT prompt for marketing:**  
""Our product is a B2B SaaS platform that uses machine learning to optimize supply chain logistics. Explain the primary benefit of our product to a busy, non-technical CEO in a single, simple sentence. 'Explain it like I'm 5,' but for a CEO.""

# Prompt #10: The Unintended Consequences

This is a higher-level systems thinking prompt. It asks students to consider the second and third-order effects of an action, beyond the immediate result.

**🍎 For the Classroom:**  
""Analyze the decision to build the Hoover Dam in the 1930s. Beyond the immediate goal of providing power and water, what were three major unintended consequences (both positive and negative) for the environment and the local population?""

**💡 The Marketing Twist:**  
This is risk assessment for a marketing campaign. What could go wrong? How could our message be misinterpreted? How might competitors react?

**Here's your ChatGPT prompt for marketing:**  
""We are planning a viral marketing campaign that uses humor to poke fun at our main competitor. Brainstorm three potential unintended negative consequences of this campaign. For example, 'It could make our brand look petty' or 'It could give our competitor free publicity.'""

# Prompt #11: The Creative Re-imagining

This is all about divergent thinking and creativity. It's about breaking free from the existing narrative and imagining ""what if?""

**🍎 For the Classroom:**  
""Re-imagine the story of Romeo and Juliet in a different setting and time period (e.g., a futuristic sci-fi world, or rival tech startups in Silicon Valley). Outline the main plot points of this new version, keeping the core themes of forbidden love and feuding families.""

**💡 The Marketing Twist:**  
Marketers use this to break out of a creative rut and find new angles for a product that's been on the market for a while.

**Here's your ChatGPT prompt for marketing:**  
""Our product is a classic, reliable brand of coffee. It's seen as a bit boring. Brainstorm three completely new marketing angles to make it exciting for a younger, Gen-Z audience. Think outside the box: link it to gaming, music festivals, or mental wellness.""

# Prompt #12: The Elevator Pitch

This prompt trains students in the art of concise, powerful communication. They must summarize a huge amount of information into a compelling, bite-sized package.

**🍎 For the Classroom:**  
""You have 30 seconds in an elevator with a famous film director. Give them an 'elevator pitch' for why they should make a movie based on the book \[Book Title\]. Your pitch must cover the main character, the central conflict, and what makes the story unique.""

**💡 The Marketing Twist:**  
This is EVERYTHING in modern marketing, from social media hooks to ad headlines. You have seconds to grab someone's attention.

**Here's your ChatGPT prompt for marketing:**  
""Generate five different 'elevator pitches' (under 280 characters, for Twitter) for our new language-learning app. Each pitch should highlight a unique benefit (e.g., speed, fun, real-world conversation practice).""

# Best Practices for Using ChatGPT in the Classroom

* **Be the Guide:** You're the human in the loop. Use ChatGPT's output as a starting point for discussion, not the final word.
* **Teach Prompting:** Show students how to write good prompts. It's a critical skill for their future.
* **Focus on Process, Not Product:** The goal isn't the AI-generated text; it's the critical thinking that happens when students analyze, critique, and refine that text.
* **Check for Accuracy:** Remind students that AI can make mistakes (""hallucinate"") and that facts should always be verified with reliable sources, a key tenet highlighted by marketing authorities like [HubSpot](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fai%2Fai-marketing).

# Conclusion: Your New Superpower

So there you have it. Twelve powerful prompts that can bring your classroom to life and push your students' thinking to the next level. But now you also have a secret superpower. You understand the deep connection between teaching and persuasion, between critical thinking and customer empathy.

The next time you see an ad, you'll see the psychology behind it. You'll recognize the ""role-play"" used to target you or the ""analogy builder"" used to simplify a complex product. And you'll know that the skills you foster in your students every single day are not just for passing tests—they are fundamental skills for navigating and shaping the world.

Now go ahead, give these prompts a try. You might just be surprised by the brilliant things your students (and you!) come up with.

# So, Why Even Bother with ChatGPT in the Classroom?

I get it. The first thing that probably comes to mind is cheating. And yes, if we just let students ask, ""Write me an essay about the Civil War,"" we're in trouble. But that's like giving students a calculator and telling them they never have to understand math again. It’s a misuse of a powerful tool.

Instead, think of ChatGPT as a ""thinking partner"" or an ""idea simulator."" When you use smart ChatGPT prompts for teachers, you’re not asking for the answer; you’re creating an environment where students can:

* Explore multiple perspectives: How often do you wish students could instantly hear the other side of an argument? AI can do that.
* Analyze information, not just find it: The internet gives them facts. A well-prompted AI can help them question those facts, identify bias, and evaluate evidence.
* Practice empathy: They can ""interview"" historical figures or characters from a novel, forcing them to think beyond their own experience.
* Save YOU time: You can generate unique scenarios, ethical dilemmas, or creative writing starters for every single student in minutes, not hours.

According to educational powerhouses like [ISTE (International Society for Technology in Education)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iste.org%2Fiste-standards), teaching students how to use tools like AI responsibly is becoming a key part of digital citizenship. We’re not just preparing them for a test; we’re preparing them for a world where AI is everywhere. By guiding them now, we teach them to be masters of the technology, not the other way around.

# The Secret Sauce: What Makes a Good ChatGPT Prompt?

The difference between a ""meh"" response and a ""wow"" response from ChatGPT is all in the prompt. Garbage in, garbage out. Brilliant prompt in, brilliant learning opportunity out.

Here are a few quick tips for crafting prompts that work:

* Assign a Role: Start your prompt by telling ChatGPT who to be. ""Act as a skeptical historian,"" ""You are a NASA engineer,"" or ""Pretend you are a biased journalist."" This instantly sets the tone and focus.
* Provide Context: Give it the background information it needs. Don’t just say ""talk about photosynthesis."" Say, ""Explain photosynthesis to a group of 5th graders using an analogy about baking a cake.""
* Demand a Format: Ask for the output in a specific structure. ""Create a debate transcript,"" ""Write this as a Socratic dialogue,"" ""Present the information in a table comparing pros and cons.""

With these principles in mind, let's get to the good stuff.

# 12 Brilliant ChatGPT Prompts for Teachers to Spark Critical Thinking

Here they are! Feel free to copy, paste, and adapt these for your own classroom. I’ve broken them down by subject area, but honestly, most of them can be tweaked for any topic.

# Prompts for ELA & Social Studies

# 1. The Devil's Advocate

>

* Why It Works: This prompt forces students to confront counterarguments and question their own assumptions. They have to move beyond a simple ""I agree"" and analyze the validity of an opposing viewpoint, a cornerstone of critical thinking.
* Example in Action: A student might use the prompt for the American Revolution. ChatGPT could argue it was more about economic interests for wealthy landowners and the preservation of slavery than a pure quest for liberty. This complicates the narrative and sparks a fantastic debate.
* Pro-Tip: Have students debate the AI's points in small groups. Which of the AI's arguments is the strongest? Which is the weakest? Why?

# 2. The Unreliable Narrator

>

* Why It Works: This is a masterclass in teaching media literacy, author's purpose, and tone. Students learn to read between the lines and identify how language can be used to manipulate a reader's perspective.
* Example in Action: ChatGPT's rewrite of the Boston Massacre from a British soldier's point of view might describe the colonists as a ""rabid mob"" and the shots fired as a ""necessary act of self-preservation.""
* Pro-Tip: Give one half of the class the ""official"" version and the other half the AI's ""unreliable"" version. Have them discuss the event without seeing each other's texts and watch them try to figure out why their stories are so different.

# 3. The Historical Interview

>

* Why It Works: This prompt breathes life into history! It requires students to think empathetically and consider the motivations and constraints of people from another time. It’s active, not passive, learning.
* Example in Action: A student could ask ""Marie Curie"" if she ever feared the dangers of radiation. ChatGPT, as Curie, might respond with her known passion for science, potentially downplaying the risks in a way that reflects the limited understanding of the time.
* Pro-Tip: Have students prepare their interview questions in advance as a homework assignment.

# 4. The 'Connect the Dots' Challenge

>

* Why It Works: This is all about synthesis and systems thinking. It pushes students to see history and knowledge not as a series of disconnected facts, but as an interconnected web of ideas and consequences.
* Example in Action: The AI could explain how the printing press allowed for the rapid dissemination of new ideas, breaking the church's monopoly on information and enabling scientists like Copernicus and Galileo to share their controversial findings with a wider audience.
* Pro-Tip: Turn it into a game! Give students a list of topics and have them compete to find the most creative and logical connections using AI as their research partner.

# Prompts for Science & Math

# 5. The Ethical Dilemma Solver

>

* Why It Works: Science isn't just about what we can do, but what we should do. This prompt introduces complex ethical reasoning and stakeholder analysis, crucial skills for responsible citizens in a tech-driven world.
* Example in Action: For gene editing, ChatGPT could outline the ""pro"" side (eradicating suffering) and the ""con"" side (unforeseen consequences, creating a genetic class divide).
* Pro-Tip: Use the AI's output as the basis for a structured classroom debate or a persuasive essay assignment.

# 6. The Modern-Day Analogy

>

* Why It Works: This is a test of true understanding. As the saying goes, you don't really understand something until you can explain it simply. It forces students to distill a complex topic to its core principles and then use creative, analogical reasoning to communicate it.
* Example in Action: ChatGPT might explain natural selection using the analogy of a battle royale video game like Fortnite, where only the players with the best ""traits"" (skills, weapons, location) ""survive"" to the end and ""reproduce"" their success in the next round.
* Pro-Tip: Have students critique the AI's analogy. Is it accurate? Where does the analogy break down? Can they create a better one?

# 7. The 'Solve for X' Problem Designer

>

* Why It Works: This helps answer the age-old student question: ""When are we ever going to use this?"" It bridges the gap between abstract concepts and practical application, making math more relevant and interesting.
* Example in Action: For exponential growth, the AI could design a problem about a viral TikTok video, asking students to calculate how many views it would have after a certain number of hours if it doubles its audience every 45 minutes.
* Pro-Tip: Let students use AI to design problems for each other. They'll have to understand the concept deeply to create a valid problem.

# Prompts for General Critical Thinking (Any Subject!)

# 8. The 'What If?' Scenario

>

* Why It Works: This is a powerhouse for teaching cause and effect on a grand scale. It develops speculative reasoning and helps students appreciate the significance and impact of key turning points.
* Example in Action: If the internet was never invented, the AI might predict that print media would still be dominant, global collaboration would be significantly slower, and social movements would organize in a completely different, localized way.
* Pro-Tip: After the AI gives its predictions, ask the students, ""What is one consequence the AI missed?""

# 9. The Socratic Dialogue

>

* Why It Works: This is the ultimate metacognition tool. It teaches students how to think by forcing them to examine their own definitions, identify inconsistencies in their logic, and build a more robust understanding from the ground up.
* Example in Action: Student wants to discuss 'justice'. ChatGPT's first question might be: ""Is justice simply about following the rules, or is it something more?""
* Pro-Tip: This is a fantastic activity for a one-on-one conference with a student or as a journal prompt for individual reflection.

# 10. The Bias Detector

>

* Why It Works: In an age of misinformation, this skill is non-negotiable. This prompt provides a safe, controlled environment for students to practice dissecting media messages and understanding how bias works in the real world. This is one of the most practical ChatGPT prompts for teachers you can use.
* Example in Action: The AI can take an article with the headline ""Brave Activists Halt Destructive Corporate Project"" and point out the biased words (""brave,"" ""destructive""), then suggest a neutral alternative like ""Protestors and Corporation Disagree on Land Use.""
* Pro-Tip: Use this with two articles about the same event from different sources and have the AI compare the bias in both.

# 11. The Deconstruct the Argument

>

* Why It Works: This is a direct workout for a student's logical reasoning muscles. It teaches them to break down an argument into its core components and evaluate its strength and validity, rather than just accepting it at face value.
* Example in Action: For a shoe ad claiming ""Our sneakers will make you a champion,"" the AI could identify the claim (shoes = success), the evidence (a celebrity endorsement), and the fallacy (appeal to authority).
* Pro-Tip: This is a great scaffold before asking students to write their own persuasive essays. They learn the building blocks of argumentation first.

# 12. The Future Impact Forecaster

>

* Why It Works: This encourages long-term, systems-level thinking. It connects what's happening today with potential futures, helping students understand that present-day choices have far-reaching consequences.
* Example in Action: For remote work, the AI might predict a positive impact like revitalized small towns, but a negative one like increased social isolation and the decay of city centers.
* Pro-Tip: Have students vote on which of the AI's predictions they think is most likely and defend their choice.

# Putting It All Together: How to Use These Prompts in Your Classroom

You've got the prompts, now what? The beauty is their flexibility.

* Bell Ringers: Start class with a quick prompt on the board to get brains buzzing.
* Station Rotations: Set up different prompts at different computer stations and have students rotate.
* Jigsaw Activity: Assign one prompt to a small ""expert"" group, have them analyze the AI's response, and then report back to a larger ""home"" group.
* Homework: Have students use a prompt to prepare for the next day's discussion. They come to class with ideas already percolating.

The key, as with any tool, is to be intentional. Think about your learning objective first, then choose one of these ChatGPT prompts for teachers that will best help you and your students get there.

# Final Thoughts: Your New AI Teaching Assistant

Look, AI isn't a magic wand that will solve all our problems. But it's also not the villain it's sometimes made out to be. It's a tool. And with the right approach—and the right prompts—it can be an incredibly powerful one.

By using these ChatGPT prompts for teachers, you're not just teaching your subject matter. You're teaching your students how to question, analyze, empathize, and think critically about the world around them. You're preparing them for the future, and you're doing it in a way that’s engaging, dynamic, and might just save you a little bit of that precious, precious time.

1lmgu8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/festivals/comments/1lmgu8z/wierd_consciousalternating_experience_at_my_first/,Wierd conscious-alternating experience at my first festival - please help me understand,"Hi all,

I just went to my first Festival. It was a bit of a wierd case, it was an event sponsored by the company I work for, daytime in the middle of the woods. I was surrounded by work colleagues, and I was having a lot of fun and then I had what seemed to be an anxiety attack.

For context, it was around 7pm, I had a small dinner, a proper lunch. And in terms of drugs, I had 3x the amount of coffee I was used to (until that part of the evening), and one cocktail with rum. I was VIBING SO HARD with the music, the atmosphere, and I was dancing beautifully and energetically - for hours. At some point it did feel like I was high on something way more than one drink - but it felt good, I didn’t give too much attention. It was like I was floating, flying… 

I was very close to the stage when I started to feel like something was “off”, and had this feeling like something really bad was about to happen or already happening. I’m a bit experienced with rituals with psychedelics so instead of abruptly removing myself from there, I started to wind down and eventually left the spot, and went for some air. I kept hydrated the whole time.

It took me a few hours to feel like myself again. But when I did, I was very hungry, and already on way back to place I was staying in. Got some mc Donald’s (the only thing open 24/7 in the city) and slept like a stone. I checked my Fitbit and my heart rate was through the roof during those hours like I was doing intense aerobic exercise for 3h non-stop (which, I kind of was…?)

I’m known to be very sensitive to substances, but 3 coffees + a dose of rum getting me so high that induces an anxiety attack…? 
Is the environment of loud music and dancing so intense that it would trigger such a response?

Has anybody ever experienced anything like that or know what this is?

Thanks in advance!

i message them before i leave, get no response and figure maybe they just don't have data and already left too, get to where we wanted to meet and.. they're not there, and haven't texted me. go to cafe for a coffee and cool air since it's VERY hot outside, wait 20 minutes, leave because i feel out of place and alone, and now im outside in 30 degree weather with a coffee. they didn't respond to me the entire day, haven't answered me for five days now. great. 

i messaged my other friend to plan something, still waiting on a response for four days. i have been trying to hang out with them for months now and every time they've rescheduled, not responded when trying to confirm or just didn't show up.

I’m a slim, stylish (5’6”) with soft skin and a confident presence. I work in the creative field—very into arts and fashion. I’m also fascinated by science, especially biology and psychology. Music and pets? Love them. Coffee? Can’t live without it. NCR-based.

About you:
Preferably fit or within a healthy BMI. Gym rats or athletic types are a plus. You’re hygienic, decent-looking, and easygoing. A plus if you’re from a Big 4 uni. I’m more drawn to guys who look youthful and know how to hold a great convo with proper etiquette.

And she responded ""Alam ko. Hindi na ako nagulat."" So I asked, ""Huh? Alam mo? Paano?"" I asked her that kasi only few people knows about it and none in our school/classmates know about it.

Okay, let's talk. You’ve started using ChatGPT. You’ve seen the magic. You ask it to write an email, summarize an article, or come up with a dinner recipe. And it does! But if you're being honest, the results are often a bit… meh. They're generic, a little soulless, and they don't quite hit the mark. You know there's genius hiding inside that AI, but you can't seem to find the key to unlock it.

The secret to getting incredible, mind-blowing results from ChatGPT lies in one thing: learning **how to write ChatGPT prompts** like a true pro.

# Trick #1: The ""Persona"" Trick - Tell It Who to Be

This is probably the single most effective trick you can use, and it's so simple. Before you ask for anything, tell ChatGPT who it is. Assign it a role, a job title, a personality. Are you talking to a world-class copywriter? A snarky social media manager for a Gen Z brand? A data-driven SEO expert?

Giving ChatGPT a persona instantly narrows its focus from ""everything on the internet"" to the specific knowledge, tone, and style of that role. It’s like putting on a different pair of glasses to see the world.

**Why it works:** It forces the AI to adopt a specific communication style, vocabulary, and framework, leading to much more authentic and targeted content. This is a game-changer for creating on-brand **ChatGPT prompts for marketing**.

**Let's see it in action:**

* **Vague Prompt:** ""Write a tweet about our new vegan leather handbag.""
* **Persona-Driven Prompt:** ""Act as a luxury fashion copywriter with a witty and sophisticated tone. Your audience is environmentally conscious millennials who value style and sustainability. Write a tweet announcing our new 'Terra' handbag, made from innovative apple leather.""

See the difference? The second prompt isn't just asking for a tweet; it's asking for a tweet from a specific expert, which gives you a far richer and more targeted result.

**Marketing Personas to Try:**

* Expert Direct-Response Copywriter specializing in high-converting email campaigns.
* Witty Social Media Manager for a DTC coffee brand targeting college students.
* Senior SEO Strategist focused on creating helpful, long-form blog content.
* Empathetic Customer Support Lead who is an expert at de-escalation.

Start every prompt by telling ChatGPT who to be. It's a tiny change that makes a huge impact.

# Trick #2: The ""Context is King"" Trick - Give It the Full Story

Imagine asking a friend, ""Hey, what should I wear?"" without telling them if you're going to a wedding, the gym, or just chilling on the couch. You’d get a useless answer, right? The same goes for ChatGPT. Context is everything.

Don't just throw a task at it. Give it the background information, the ""why"" behind your request. The more context you provide, the more relevant and useful the output will be. This is non-negotiable for writing good **ChatGPT prompts for marketing**.

**Why it works:** AI doesn't know your business, your goals, or your audience unless you tell it. Providing context fills in these critical gaps, allowing the AI to generate content that actually aligns with your strategy.

**Let's break it down:**

* **Low-Context Prompt:** ""Write a blog post about the benefits of email marketing.""
* **High-Context Prompt:** ""I'm writing a blog post for my website, 'Solopreneur Spark.' My target audience is freelance graphic designers who are new to marketing their services. The goal of the post is to convince them that email marketing is a powerful tool for finding high-quality clients. Include a section on what to send in their first three emails. The tone should be encouraging, helpful, and not overly technical.""

The high-context prompt gives ChatGPT everything it needs to succeed:

* **Your Brand:** Solopreneur Spark
* **Target Audience:** Freelance graphic designers
* **Goal:** Convince them to start email marketing
* **Specific Content:** A section on the first three emails
* **Tone:** Encouraging and helpful

Never assume ChatGPT knows what you’re thinking. Over-explain. It’s better to give too much context than not enough.

# Trick #3: The ""Be Specific & Set Constraints"" Trick - Define the Sandbox

General instructions lead to general results. If you want specific, high-quality output, you need to give specific, high-quality instructions. This means telling ChatGPT exactly what you want it to do, and just as importantly, what you don't want it to do.

Think of it as building a sandbox for the AI to play in. You define the boundaries, and within those boundaries, it can get creative.

**Why it works:** Constraints force creativity. By setting clear rules and limitations, you guide the AI away from generic responses and towards a more focused and original output. This is essential for creating powerful **ChatGPT prompts for marketing** that hit specific goals.

**Let's get specific:**

* **Vague Prompt:** ""Write some ad copy for my new noise-cancelling headphones.""
* **Specific Prompt:** ""Write 5 Facebook ad headlines for our new 'Zenith' noise-cancelling headphones.
   * **Constraint 1:** Each headline must be under 12 words.
   * **Constraint 2:** Each headline must ask a question.
   * **Constraint 3:** Mention the benefit of 'focus' or 'silence'.
   * **Constraint 4:** Do NOT use cheesy words like 'revolutionary' or 'game-changing'.""

This prompt gives the AI clear, actionable rules. It knows the length, the format (a question), the key benefit to highlight, and what to avoid. The result will be five useful, on-target headlines you can actually test, not a wall of generic text.

# Trick #4: The ""Provide Examples"" Trick (Your Secret Weapon)

This one feels like cheating, but it's just smart prompting. It’s called ""few-shot prompting,"" and it's incredibly powerful. Instead of just describing what you want, you show ChatGPT exactly what you want by providing a few examples.

If you have a very specific brand voice or need a certain format, this is the best way to get it right on the first try. You’re literally training the AI on your style in real-time.

**Why it works:** AI is a pattern-matching machine. When you provide examples, it instantly recognizes the pattern (your tone, your style, your structure) and replicates it with new information. It's the fastest way to get your brand voice just right with **ChatGPT prompts for marketing**.

**Let's show, not just tell:**

* **Prompt:** ""I need to write product descriptions for my website. I want them to be short, punchy, and a little quirky. Here are a couple of examples of my style:Now, using that same style, write a product description for our new 'Procrasti-Planner' weekly planner.""
   * **Example 1 (for a coffee mug):** 'Your other mugs will be jealous. Holds coffee, tea, or your tears on a Monday. We don't judge.'
   * **Example 2 (for a notebook):** 'A place for your brilliant ideas, grocery lists, and questionable doodles. 120 pages of pure potential.'

By providing examples, you've given the AI a crystal-clear template for your brand voice. The output will be infinitely better and more aligned with your brand than if you had just said, ""Write a quirky product description.""

# Trick #5: The ""Chain of Thought"" Trick - Make It Think Step-by-Step

For complex tasks like creating a strategy or outlining a big project, you can't just ask for the final answer. You need to guide the AI's thinking process. A magical little phrase you can add to your prompt is ""Think step-by-step.""

This forces the AI to break down its reasoning and tackle the problem in a logical, structured way, which almost always leads to a more thoughtful and comprehensive result.

**Why it works:** It prevents the AI from rushing to a simplistic conclusion. By verbalizing its ""thought process,"" the AI follows a more rigorous logical path, catching potential issues and producing a more robust and well-structured response. This is a pro-level move for complex **ChatGPT prompts for marketing** strategy.

**Let's strategize:**

* **Simple Prompt:** ""Give me a marketing plan for my new mobile app.""
* **Chain of Thought Prompt:** ""I'm launching a new mobile app for dog owners that helps them find dog-friendly parks and cafes. Create a 3-month launch marketing plan. **Think step-by-step.**
   1. First, define the primary target audience and their key pain points.
   2. Second, suggest 3 core marketing channels we should focus on.
   3. Third, for each channel, brainstorm 5 specific content or campaign ideas for the first month.
   4. Fourth, outline a simple social media content calendar for launch week.""

The second prompt guides the AI through the entire strategic process, ensuring you get a practical, actionable plan, not just a list of vague ideas.

# Trick #6: The ""Iterate and Refine"" Trick - Treat It Like a Conversation

Your first prompt is not the final word. It's the opening line of a conversation. One of the biggest mistakes people make is giving up after the first response isn't perfect. The real magic happens in the follow-up.

Use follow-up prompts to tweak, refine, and steer the AI's output until it's exactly what you need.

**Why it works:** ChatGPT remembers the context of your conversation. You can build on its previous responses, making small adjustments without having to start from scratch. As a marketer, this back-and-forth is invaluable. In fact, many successful marketers, as highlighted by resources like [HubSpot's AI marketing guide](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fai-marketing), emphasize this iterative process.

**Let's have a chat:**

1. **You:** ""Write a short email announcing a 20% off flash sale for our skincare products.""
2. **ChatGPT:** (Generates a decent email)
3. **You:** ""That's good, but can you make the subject line more urgent and curiosity-driven?""
4. **ChatGPT:** (Generates new subject lines)
5. **You:** ""I like '🤫 A little secret for your skin...' Can you rewrite the first paragraph to be more playful and less formal?""
6. **ChatGPT:** (Refines the first paragraph)
7. **You:** ""Perfect. Now add a P.S. that mentions the sale ends in 48 hours.""

In just a few back-and-forth messages, you've co-created the perfect email. Don't be shy—be a director!

# Trick #7: The ""Format is Your Friend"" Trick - Ask for Structured Output

This final trick is a massive productivity booster. Don't just accept a giant wall of text from ChatGPT. Tell it exactly how to format the output. Do you want a list? A table? A JSON object? Just ask!

**Why it works:** Structured output is easy to copy, paste, and use in other applications like spreadsheets, project management tools, or your website's CMS. It saves you the tedious work of reformatting the AI's response.

**Let's get organized:**

* **Unstructured Prompt:** ""Give me some blog post ideas about social media marketing.""
* **Structured Prompt:** ""Generate 10 blog post ideas for a marketing agency's blog. Provide the output in a markdown table with three columns: 'Blog Post Title,' 'Target Keyword,' and 'Brief 1-Sentence Description'.""

The structured response is immediately usable. You can copy it straight into a Google Sheet or your content calendar. This is a fantastic way to streamline your workflow when using **ChatGPT prompts for marketing** planning.

# Trick #1: Give ChatGPT a Job (The Power of Personas)

This is, without a doubt, the most important trick in the book. By default, ChatGPT is a generalist. It’s a ""helpful assistant."" That's fine, but it's also why you get general, ""helpful"" answers. To get expert-level output, you need to turn it into an expert. You need to give it a job, a role, a persona.

Think of ChatGPT as an incredibly talented actor waiting for a director (that's you!) to tell them what role to play. Don't just ask it a question; tell it who it is before it answers. This one shift in how you write ChatGPT prompts will instantly elevate your results.

Bad Prompt:

>

Genius Prompt:

>

See the difference? In the second prompt, ChatGPT isn't just a generic AI anymore. It's a seasoned professional. It will adopt the tone, vocabulary, and perspective of that persona, giving you a much richer, more specific, and more valuable answer.

Pro-Tip: Get creative with your personas! Try ""You are a cynical history professor,"" ""You are an enthusiastic kindergarten teacher,"" ""You are a hard-boiled noir detective,"" or ""You are Steve Jobs unveiling a new product.""

# Trick #2: Provide Rich Context (The ""No-Clue"" Prevention Method)

Imagine a friend calls you and just says, ""Should I take the job?"" You'd be totally lost, right? You'd immediately ask, ""What job? What's your current situation? What are you looking for?"" We need context to give good advice. ChatGPT is no different.

One of the biggest mistakes people make when learning how to write ChatGPT prompts is that they withhold crucial information. They expect the AI to be a mind reader. To get a truly tailored response, you need to provide all the relevant background information. The more context you give, the better the AI can understand your goal.

Bad Prompt:

>

Genius Prompt:

>

By providing this rich context, you've given ChatGPT everything it needs to craft the perfect email for your specific situation. It will use the data points you provided and adopt the direct tone your boss appreciates. This is a fundamental skill in how to write ChatGPT prompts effectively.

# Trick #3: Demand a Specific Format (Be the Boss of the Output)

Have you ever asked ChatGPT for a list of ideas and gotten back a dense, messy wall of text? It’s hard to read and even harder to use. Don't let the AI dictate the format of its answer. You are the boss!

A simple but incredibly powerful trick is to tell ChatGPT exactly how you want the information presented. This makes the output immediately more useful and saves you the time of having to reformat it yourself. This is a practical skill that separates amateur users from those who know how to write ChatGPT prompts for maximum utility.

Bad Prompt:

>

Genius Prompt:

>

You can ask for all sorts of formats:

* Markdown tables
* Bulleted or numbered lists
* JSON code
* A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) list
* A series of tweets (each under 280 characters)
* A simple, plain-text summary

By specifying the format, you take control of the conversation and get exactly what you need, the way you need it.

# Trick #4: Show, Don't Just Tell (The Magic of Examples)

Sometimes, describing what you want is harder than just showing an example. This is where ""few-shot prompting"" comes in. It sounds technical, but it’s super simple: you just give ChatGPT one or more examples of what you're looking for before you ask it to generate something new.

This technique is incredibly effective for tasks involving a specific style, tone, or structure. By providing an example, you're giving the AI a crystal-clear template to follow. As you learn how to write ChatGPT prompts, think of this as giving it a style guide.

Bad Prompt:

>

Genius Prompt:

>

By providing examples, you've trained the AI on your specific preferences in real-time. It now understands the pattern (short phrase + emoji) and will generate much more relevant and stylish results than if you had just tried to describe it with words.

# Trick #5: Treat It Like a Conversation (The Art of the Follow-Up)

A lot of people treat ChatGPT like a search engine. They type in a prompt, get an answer, and then start a new chat if it wasn't perfect. This is a huge mistake! The real power of how to write ChatGPT prompts comes from the follow-up.

Think of it as a conversation with a brilliant, super-fast intern. Your first prompt is just the beginning of the discussion. The first output is a draft. Now, your job is to refine it. Use follow-up prompts to tweak, edit, and perfect the response.

Initial Prompt:

>

Follow-up Prompts:

* ""Okay, I like number 3. Can you expand on 'Meal Prepping for Busy Professionals'? Give me 5 potential subheadings for that blog post.""
* ""Those are good. For the subheading 'Choosing the Right Containers,' make it sound more fun and less like a chore.""
* ""Now, rewrite the whole list of ideas, but this time target them towards college students on a tight budget.""
* ""Make it more concise.""
* ""Can you add a surprising statistic to that last point?""

By iterating and refining, you guide the AI toward the perfect final product. Don't be afraid to be picky! This back-and-forth process is where the real collaboration happens and is a hallmark of someone who truly understands how to write ChatGPT prompts.

# Trick #6: Set Clear Boundaries (Telling It What Not to Do)

Just as important as telling ChatGPT what to do is telling it what not to do. This is called using ""negative constraints,"" and it's a fantastic way to eliminate common annoyances and refine your output.

Are you tired of the AI using overly formal language, annoying jargon, or cheesy phrases? Just tell it to stop! Including constraints in your prompt helps to steer the AI away from its default habits and toward the specific style you want.

Bad Prompt:

>

Genius Prompt:

>

By setting these boundaries, you force the AI to be more creative and original. You get a clean, direct, and useful explanation without any of the fluff you want to avoid. This is an advanced-level trick for how to write ChatGPT prompts that gives you an incredible amount of control.

# Trick #7: The Master Prompt: Combining Your Powers for Genius Output

Alright, now it's time to put it all together. The real masters don't just use one of these tricks at a time; they stack them into a single, comprehensive ""master prompt."" This is how you go from getting good answers to getting output that feels like it was read directly from your mind.

Let's imagine you want to create a social media post. Here's how you'd combine all our tricks:

The Master Prompt Example:

>

This master prompt leaves nothing to chance. You've told ChatGPT who to be, what the situation is, what you want, how you want it, what to avoid, and what success looks like. The output you get from a prompt this detailed will be 10x better than a simple request. This is the ultimate goal of learning how to write ChatGPT prompts. For more in-depth techniques, you can even check out OpenAI's own [prompt engineering guide](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fplatform.openai.com%2Fdocs%2Fguides%2Fprompt-engineering), which provides a great technical foundation.

# Conclusion: You're a Prompt Master Now

Look, ChatGPT is an amazing tool, but it's not a magician. It can't read your mind. The quality of its answers will always be a direct reflection of the quality of your questions.

By moving beyond simple, one-line requests and starting to use these seven tricks—giving it a persona, providing context, defining the format, showing examples, iterating, setting boundaries, and combining them all—you are fundamentally changing your relationship with AI. You're no longer a passive user; you're an active director, guiding it toward the exact outcome you need.

So go on, open a new chat. Try giving the AI a job. Give it some context. Be the boss. You now know how to write ChatGPT prompts that unlock its true potential. The genius is in there, waiting for you to ask for it in the right way.",1,1751094814.0,AI_book_writing,0,1.0,False

So basically I'm just asking for advice on some food that I can buy to stay within my goals that'll still leave me money for rent.

I don't know if this is helpful but I guess I'll give an idea of what I usually eat.

Although not every day is bad, there are days when we have arguments for hours that lead nowhere, and instead, more resentment and unresolved issues pile up.

There have been so many moments when I've told myself that the next time we argue, I'll leave. This year, I even told him that if things didn't get better, I was going to go. But I think he hasn't really taken it seriously, or he just forgets.

Sometimes I see how other husbands treat their wives and it breaks my heart, because I don't feel loved and I can't talk to him about how I feel, because he'll just invalidate my feelings or try to convince me that things aren't that bad.
This isn't the kind of problem that gets solved by talking, because we've talked until we're exhausted, and he doesn't want to go to therapy and comes up with a thousand excuses why it's not a good idea.

Even close friends and even his own sister have told me they don't like the way he treats me. If they only knew that sometimes days go by without hugs, that sometimes our relationship is nothing more than orders, that the first thing he says to me when he wakes up is to make him coffee.

It also happens that many times I feel happier when he's not around, when I don't have to satisfy his whims and demands, when I don't have to react in a way that avoids making him angry.

With all this, I know the normal thing would be to leave the relationship, but believe me, it's not easy. I've spent two years seriously thinking about ending it, and I even want to start therapy to give myself the strength that I feel I no longer have...",4,1751094477.0,infp,6,1.0,False

Hi all,

I’ve recently discovered this sub and had no idea how many factors (like 8-bar pressure) impact espresso quality. I see the Sage Barista line is highly recommended, but at nearly €1000 where I live, it’s more than I’m comfortable spending.

I want to make coffee at home more often (to take to work), but I’m lazy/impatient—hate cleaning, don’t want to fiddle too much, and don’t have time to heat milk manually every morning. I appreciate good coffee, but I’m afraid if the process is too involved, I’ll just end up not using the machine.

Is there a semi-automatic machine that delivers good espresso, is low-maintenance, and under €500? As I mostly make cappuccinos in the morning it would be a plus to have milk frothing function.

Thanks in advance!

# The Secret Sauce: Why Your Prompts Are Everything

Before we dive in, let's quickly chat about why the prompt is so important. Think of it like ordering a coffee.

If you walk up to the barista and just say ""Coffee,"" you'll get a plain, black coffee. It’s fine, but it’s probably not what you really wanted. But if you say, ""I'll have a large iced vanilla latte with oat milk and an extra shot of espresso,"" you get exactly what you were dreaming of.

ChatGPT is the same. A lazy prompt gives you a lazy, generic answer. A detailed, specific prompt gives you gold. The best prompts give ChatGPT four key things: a **Role**, the **Context**, a clear **Task**, and a desired **Format**. You'll see this pattern in all the powerful **ChatGPT prompts for marketing** below.

# Part 1: Prompts for Nailing Your Strategy & Audience

You can't sell anything if you don't know who you're selling to. These prompts help you get crystal clear on your audience and your unique place in the market.

# Prompt #1: The Ultimate Customer Persona Builder

>

**Why it works:** This goes way beyond basic demographics. It forces ChatGPT to think like a real person, giving you a persona you can almost have a conversation with. Every piece of marketing you create will be better because you'll know exactly who you're talking to.

**How to customize:** Fill in the brackets with your product and target demographic. The more detail you provide about your ideal customer, the richer the persona will be.

# Prompt #2: The Pain Point Identifier

>

**Why it works:** People buy solutions to their problems. Great marketing speaks directly to those problems. This prompt digs deep into the ""why"" behind your customer's struggles, giving you the exact language you need to show them you understand and have the solution.

**How to customize:** Use the persona you created in the first prompt. Get specific about your industry. The ""underlying emotion"" part is key—it moves you from features to feelings.

# Prompt #3: The Unique Selling Proposition (USP) Generator

>

**Why it works:** This prompt sets up a competitive landscape. By telling ChatGPT who you're up against, you're not just asking for generic benefits; you're asking for a strategic angle. It helps you find that sweet spot of what you do best that no one else does.

**How to customize:** Be honest about your product and your competitors. The more accurate your descriptions, the more strategic the USPs will be.

# Part 2: Prompts for High-Converting Sales Copy

Now that you know your audience and your angle, it's time to write copy that gets people to click, sign up, and buy. These **ChatGPT prompts for marketing** leverage classic copywriting formulas.

# Prompt #4: The AIDA Framework Ad Copy Creator

>

**Why it works:** AIDA is a time-tested formula for a reason. As marketing experts at [HubSpot explain](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Faida-framework), it walks the reader through a logical journey from awareness to action. Asking ChatGPT to label each section forces it to adhere to the structure, resulting in much more effective copy.

**How to customize:** Define your product, audience, and especially the tone. The tone will drastically change the output from playful to serious.

# Prompt #5: The PAS Framework Headline Machine

>

**Why it works:** The PAS framework is incredibly powerful for grabbing attention. It starts by stating a problem the reader knows they have, makes it feel a little more painful (agitate), and then presents your product as the perfect solution. It’s a direct line to your customer's needs.

**How to customize:** Be crystal clear about the problem. The more specific the problem, the more the headline will resonate.

# Prompt #6: The ""Before-After-Bridge"" Storyteller

>

**Why it works:** Stories sell better than stats. This framework creates a mini-narrative that is easy to follow and emotionally compelling. It paints a vivid picture of transformation, which is what every customer is ultimately buying.

**How to customize:** The details of the ""Before"" and ""After"" are everything. Use real customer language if you have it.

# Prompt #7: The Benefit-Driven Bullet Point Converter

>

**Why it works:** Customers don't buy features; they buy benefits. Nobody cares about a ""500-thread count sheet"" (feature); they care about ""the most luxuriously soft and cool sleep of your life"" (benefit). This is one of the most useful **ChatGPT prompts for marketing** because it forces that critical shift in perspective.

**How to customize:** List as many features as you can. The more raw material you give it, the more benefits it can extract.

# Part 3: Prompts for Killer Content & SEO

Content is king, but the kingdom is a busy place. These prompts help you create valuable content that ranks on Google and resonates with your audience.

# Prompt #8: The Endless Blog Post Idea Generator

>

**Why it works:** This moves you from random brainstorming to strategic content planning. By categorizing ideas by funnel stage, you ensure you're creating content that nurtures leads from initial curiosity all the way to a sale.

**How to customize:** Be specific about your audience's interests and skill level (e.g., ""beginners in gardening"" vs. ""expert gardeners"").

# Prompt #9: The SEO Blog Post Outliner

>

**Why it works:** A good outline is 90% of the battle in writing a great blog post. This prompt structures the entire article for you, ensuring it's logical, comprehensive, and optimized for search engines from the ground up.

**How to customize:** Provide the exact target keyword you want to rank for. You can even add, ""Include a 'Frequently Asked Questions' section in the outline.""

# Prompt #10: The Click-Worthy Meta Description Writer

>

**Why it works:** Your meta description is your one chance to ""sell the click"" on Google. This prompt focuses on the specific constraints (character limit) and goals (CTR) of a meta description, leading to much better results than just asking it to ""summarize the post.""

**How to customize:** Provide the exact title and keyword. This helps ChatGPT understand the context and intent of the article.

# Part 4: Prompts for Email & Social Media Domination

Connect with your audience where they hang out. These **ChatGPT prompts for marketing** will help you craft emails and social posts that people actually want to read.

# Prompt #11: The Welcome Email Sequence Architect

>

**Why it works:** A welcome sequence is your best opportunity to turn a new subscriber into a loyal fan. This prompt helps you plan a strategic journey instead of just sending random emails, ensuring each message has a purpose.

**How to customize:** The more you explain about your lead magnet and your paid product, the more logical and effective the sequence will be.

# Prompt #12: The Unignorable Subject Line Brainstormer

>

**Why it works:** The subject line is the most important part of an email. This prompt forces variety by asking for specific psychological triggers, giving you a broad range of options to test and see what your audience responds to.

**How to customize:** Be very clear about the offer. Is it a percentage off, a BOGO, free shipping? The specifics matter.

# Prompt #13: The Content Repurposing Guru

>

**Why it works:** Don't just create content, multiply it! This prompt helps you work smarter, not harder, by turning one piece of content into a week's worth of social media posts, tailored to the specific style of each platform.

**How to customize:** Use a clear summary of your article. The better the source material, the better the repurposed content.

# Prompt #14: The Engagement-Boosting Question Asker

>

**Why it works:** Social media algorithms love engagement. Asking good questions is the fastest way to get it. This prompt focuses on creating questions that align with your brand, so the engagement you get is from the right kind of people.

**How to customize:** Your brand values are key here. They guide ChatGPT to ask questions that reinforce what your brand stands for.

# Prompt #15: The Objection-Handling Pro

>

**Why it works:** Every customer has hidden objections. Addressing them head-on builds trust and closes sales. This prompt prepares you with thoughtful, pre-written responses you can use in DMs, emails, or on an FAQ page.

**How to customize:** Use the most common objections you actually hear from customers. The more real the objection, the more useful the response will be.

# How to Supercharge These Prompts: A Few Pro Tips

* **Iterate, Iterate, Iterate:** Don't love the first response? Don't give up! Treat it like a conversation. Use follow-up commands like, ""Okay, I like version 2. Can you make it funnier?"" or ""Rewrite that but for a more skeptical audience.""
* **Give It Examples:** ChatGPT is a great mimic. If you have a piece of copy you love (even from a competitor), you can say, ""I love this headline style: \[paste example\]. Write 5 more like this but for my product.""
* **Tell It to ""Think Step-by-Step"":** For complex tasks, adding ""Think step-by-step"" to your prompt can help the AI process its ""thoughts"" more logically, often leading to a more creative and well-reasoned output.

# Conclusion: You've Got This!

ChatGPT isn't a magic button that will solve all your marketing problems. But it is an unbelievable force multiplier. The real power comes from your strategy, your creativity, and your deep understanding of your customer, guiding this incredible tool.

This is really for expats and locals who are just done with the high-energy social scene and ready for something more grounded.

And don't worry about being an introvert – I'm totally with you there! Your background, your favorite instant noodles – it's all good. The main thing is being open to forming real, lasting friendships with diverse people who get the beauty of a quiet night.

1lmgjor,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductIntel/comments/1lmgjor/anyone_still_using_the_same_wallet_for_over_5/,Anyone still using the same wallet for over 5 years?,"Let’s be honest — wallets take a beating. From daily use to accidental coffee spills, bulging receipts, and the occasional tumble from your car seat, it’s no surprise many people cycle through wallets every couple of years. But surprisingly, there’s a loyal group out there still holding onto the same wallet after five, ten, or even fifteen years.

For many, it’s about function over flash. A wallet that still holds cards, cash, and IDs without falling apart earns its keep. Leather models, in particular, often age gracefully, developing a worn-in character people grow attached to. Others stick with theirs out of habit — it fits their pocket perfectly, and they know exactly where everything goes.

That said, longevity usually comes with a bit of maintenance. People who manage to keep a wallet in service for half a decade often clean it out regularly, avoid overstuffing, and may even condition leather to prevent cracking. Some even go minimalist, ditching coins and unnecessary cards to reduce wear and tear.

Of course, there are plenty of folks tempted by flashy new options — slim RFID-blocking designs, smart trackers, or even phone-case hybrids. But for those still rocking an old-school bi-fold from years ago? It's a quiet badge of loyalty, practicality, and maybe a hint of nostalgia.

It was one day after I was texted her and asked her to do something on our own. It was about the class but she accepted right away (This is for next week). It is the first time we will be alone with each other. About yesterday: after every exam some people from the class and I would go for a coffee. I told her if she would come and she said: “ yes but for a while, cause I got some work to do” And then I fumbled.

I told the other guys if we should go somewhere to study about something. They said yes, but she and her friends left, cause they didn’t have time. Of course we didn’t go studying, so after 15-20 minutes, we texted her and her friends if they wanted to join in our coffee. As you can imagine they couldn’t do it now.

I’m mad, cause we had so much to talk about, most importantly about next week. I think I made her feel like I was ignoring her and I hate that. I’m scared that she might call it off.

1. **Freelance Writing** 📜 
   - If you can use AI to generate high-quality articles, why not offer your services as a freelance writer? People pay anywhere from $50 to $200 for a good piece!
   - Use sites like Upwork or Fiverr to get started. You don’t have to be perfect; just have a decent portfolio, and you’ll be golden.

2. **Create an E-Book** 📚
   - Take a series of blog posts, or even a collection of ideas, and compile them into an e-book. 
   - **Example:** “10 Ways AI Can Boost Your Marketing Game” – throw in some insights, some cool graphics (can use AI for that too!), and boom! E-book!

3. **Online Courses/Workshops** 🎓
   - Share your knowledge! Use AI to help you outline and structure a course on writing, digital marketing, or even how to harness the power of AI. Platforms like Teachable make it super simple to get rolling.

4. **Affiliate Marketing** 💸
   - Recommend products or tools you love in your AI-generated content. If your article earns traffic and converts readers into buyers, you’ll make some sweet passive income through affiliate links!

5. **Membership/Subscription Models** 🔑
   - Consider creating a paid newsletter or a subscription-based community where you share exclusive content generated by AI. Think of all the juicy gossip and insights your followers would pay to access!

### But wait, there’s more:
- **Content Repurposing:** 
   - Don’t just leave your content to gather dust. Turn blog posts into videos, podcasts, or even infographics. More formats = more audiences.

- **Engagement is King:** 
   - When you share something, let’s not just drop a link and dip out. Engaging with your audience turns curious readers into loyal fans who are willing to pay for your expertise.

So, are you ready to get on the cash train? 🚂💵

I've seen people transform their side hustles into legit income streams simply by leveraging what AI can do for them. Imagine that nice little extra income stream while sipping a coffee in your PJ’s. Sounds dreamy, right? ☕✨

Old Hag sees me paying for my stuff and says:
Excuse me, can i use your Credit card to buy my things?!?!
And i was tired, i hadn't had my Coffee yet (I drink Coffee in the morning) so i said:
No, how do i know you won't just run off with it?
Then Old Hag said:
Hmph!! Such an ungrateful little brat!!
I didn't say anything, a few minutes later and i left the store, in the parking lot, guess Who i see? Old Hag, she came up to me and started RIPPING THE GROCERIES OUT OF MY HANDS!! I fought back and eventually the bag ripped in half since Old Hag was pulling on the other side, I said to her:
What is wrong with you?!?!?!
She just responded by saying:
That's what you get for not sharing with me!!!
Then she grabbed me, her long, fake nails dug deep into my skin, i had to have stiches put into my arm! Then Old Hag put me down on the ground and proceeded to try and take my wallet out of my back pocket! She then said:
If you fight back i'll call the cops for assault!!!!
I was pissed!! I tried to get up, but Old Hag weighed like 200 pounds!! Then i did the logical thing, i kicked her back until she let go (my legs were free while she was pinning me down) after that i got up and she tried to punch me! She kicked my legs and i fell, i broke some of my ribs, then Old Hag took my wallet and started running to her car, i could barely stand, and i couldn't run after her, but i called the cops on Old Hag and eventually they called me and said they are going to give my wallet back, unfortunatly, Old Hag had already maxed out MY Credit card in HER NAME. The court hearing is in a few weeks, i'll update you after that. You know, instead of am i the jerk, i should be calling this: Crazy karen steals my Credit card and maxes it out before getting caught by the Police. ",0,1751093563.0,AmITheJerk,11,0.17,False

I laughed, ""Ah, my knight in shining...scarf! Quite the rescue mission!""

He chuckled, ""Well, I couldn't let such a lovely accessory escape into the wild.""

We ended up chatting for a bit—turns out, he's a coffee enthusiast like me. As we parted ways, he said, ""If you ever need a scarf-finding partner, you know where to find one!""

""I'll be sure to keep losing my things then!"" I replied with a wink.

Keep in mind some of these projects were one line on a spreadsheet so they may not be entirely accurate, but I tried my best. Most of them had clear project limits, though. I made this in CAD and I thought it would be a fun exercise while informing people of what our city is doing with our tax dollars so we can better advocate for ourselves. Personally, I would encourage people to hold Bakersfield Public Works accountable to the City's Complete Streets ordinance and ensure that they design these projects with all road users in mind, not just drivers, but that's just my two cents. And of course all of these projects are subject to change if something goes wrong internally I guess.

1lmg6vu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lmg6vu/aitah_for_expecting_more_from_my_mother/,AITAH for expecting more from my mother?,"My father (57M) has struggled with alcoholism since before I (16F) was born and I am to the point where I cannot be in the same room as him. He suffers from bipolar disorder was on antidepressants but often stops taking them so he can drink. His drinking habits are scary and concerning. He pulled out his gun and threatened to kill attorneys that were at our door a few months ago. He verbally abuses both me and my mother (55F) Just last Saturday I walked out because he was drunk again antagonizing me after my mother and I got home from a graduation party and when I came back we got into a verbal altercation where he cussed me out and called me out of my name and said many other hurtful things in the front yard. 

This is all behavior my mother excuses and expects me to do the same and I am starting to lose my patience. The lease for the house my parents rent is up in july and many months ago my mother and I planned to move away from him and get a mobile home. This was very plausible imo because my mother is the bread winner making double what my father makes and she was able to afford the mobile homes in nice parks. But after a while it fell through because she decided she wanted a real house but the only way she’d be able to do that is if she applied for a loan with my father. She is fully aware that I do not want to continue living with him and she leads me on with “Well I just need him to make the payment and then I can kick him out.” But I know her, I know them, and that’s just something that she would never be able to do. She continues to lose my trust with the empty promise she makes about leaving my father. I’ve given up on that hope and the only thing I want now is for her to hold him accountable. They used to get into crazy fights but after a while she became more numb and complacent and now whenever he gets drunk she lets it happen doesn’t say a word and just does whatever he wants. So he views his behavior as acceptable and continues to make our lives miserable. 


Last Saturday was my final straw after the things he said to me. My mother had seen and heard all of it so she was pissed off at him with me and ignored him for a good 4 days. But then she started doing his laundry, making his coffee, buying him food, waiting for him to come home from work. She started looking at me with what I could only describe as contempt as if I was the reason they weren’t on good terms. She constantly talks about him to me and I can tell she wants him to talk to her again and I hint at her my disapproval by saying subtle things like “You know he hasn’t said one word to me.” Ignored. And now today not even a week later. They talking and laughing together as if nothing had happened. Has she held him accountable? no. Has she demanded an apology for both me and her? no. Has she expressed that his behavior is unacceptable and she wishes for him to do better? Nope. She pretends like nothing has happened. I am choosing to ignore her now and she is angry at me for being angry at her. 

This whole thing between them and myself is starting to mess with my head and my perception of time because of how fast they can go from lovey dovey to hating eachothers guts and now at this point i’m just wondering if I am the problem and should I be more tolerant?",3,1751092780.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

I’m here on a mission: to find something real, something electric, the kind of spark that makes your heart skip and your phone light up with excitement. I’ll be as detailed as possible so you amazing women know exactly who’s graced your screen. Before we dive in, I hope you're reading this in high spirits, good health, and away we go! 

What I look like:

Picture this: linebacker build, teddy bear heart, and the soul of a poet. I’m a big guy who loves hitting the gym almost as much as I love a good deep conversation. Standing tall at 6 feet with thick brown hair and blue eyes that used to be golden blond, yeah, I was born to shine, and I still do (just in a darker shade now). 

About me:

When I’m not lifting weights, working, or living large with Texas pride, you’ll probably catch me getting lost in the rhythm of life through some of my favorite things:

📜 Poetry – I write it, I read it, I feel it. If words can melt hearts, I like to think mine come preheated.

🎨 Art – I’ve got a soft spot for beauty in all its forms, especially the kind that makes you stop and stare.

🍳 Cooking – There’s something intimate about making a dish from scratch… especially when I’m cooking for someone worth impressing.

🚶‍♂️ Taking Walks – Whether it's a quiet neighborhood stroll or wandering where the map cuts off, I'm all about peaceful steps and great conversation.

🌿 Foraging – I like to find the wild in the calm and the calm in the wild. Bonus points if you know what chanterelles look like.

✍️ Writing – I’ve got a pen, a passion, and a mind full of late-night thoughts that sometimes hit harder than expected.

🏈 Football – Friday night lights? That’s a religion where I’m from. I play hard, cheer loud, and carry that same fire into everything I do.

🏸 Badminton – Don’t let the shuttlecock fool you, this game brings out my playful, competitive side. Just try to beat me. I dare you. 

🌌 Astronomy – I’ve got a thing for stargazing. There’s just something about looking up at the universe and realizing… we’re all made of a little stardust, and maybe meant to find each other in it.

Who am I?

I’m the kind of man who walks into a room and fills it with love, humor, and attentiveness. There’s a gravity to me: something strong, steady, protective. I lead with calm confidence, not noise. I watch, I listen, I learn, because understanding someone is far more attractive to me than trying to impress them. I’ve got layers, like pages in a favorite book you keep rereading because you find something new each time. There’s the side of me that’ll tease you just to see you smile, that keeps conversations electric but easy. Then there’s the quieter part, thoughtful, poetic, always wondering about the little things people don’t say out loud.

When I love, I do it with intention. I’m not here for halfway or maybe. I want something worth building, worth holding. I’m a romantic in the old-school sense: hand-holding, forehead-kissing, letters on bad days and unwavering loyalty on the worse ones. I’ll remember how you take your coffee, and I’ll memorize the way your eyes shift when you’re thinking too hard. To me, real love is in the details, it’s how you make someone feel safe in your arms and free in their soul, all at once. I believe in deep connection. The kind where time disappears in a late-night talk. Where silence isn’t awkward, it’s sacred. I want love that’s equal parts adventure and anchor. Where we can be playful and wild one moment, then soft and vulnerable the next. At my core, I’m a man who believes in creating a bond that’s rare. Something that doesn't just survive the storms but dances in the rain. So if you’re looking for someone who can be your strength and softness, your calm and your chaos, your favorite verse and your favorite touch, then I’m already curious what your laugh sounds like.

Fin~

If any part of this sparked something in you, don’t just sit with it. Say hi. If you’re the kind of woman who’s drawn to deep conversations, warm laughter, and a man who knows how to be both strong and soft… I just might be your type. I’m an open book with bold pages, easy to talk to, genuinely curious, and full of energy that’ll brighten your day without even trying. So don’t be shy. Reach out. I’m already looking forward to meeting the woman who reads this and thinks, ""Yeah… I could see this going somewhere.""

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **The Great Swedish Showdown: IK Oddevold vs. Trelleborgs FF**  
*Where the underdog’s got a 41% chance to shock the socks off the favorites… and maybe their socks are already missing key players.*

---

### The Stats, The Stumbles, and The Sarcasm

**Trelleborgs FF** (home team) is hosting this match with the swagger of a team that’s *technically* favored but missing **Robin Book, Adrian Kebashi, and Alexander Johansson**—three players who probably paid for their own jerseys. Their recent form? A mixed bag of “we almost had it” and “here’s another loss.” Meanwhile, **IK Oddevold** (the underdog) just handed Varberg a 2-1 loss, only for Kevin Nyarko to spoil the party with a last-minute goal. Classic drama.

**Key Injuries/Updates**:

* **Trelleborgs FF**: Missing three key players. If this were a Marvel movie, they’d be the team that lost their Iron Man, Thor, and Hulk.
* **IK Oddevold**: No major injuries reported, but their recent draw with Varberg proves they’re the kind of team that makes you question every “safe” bet.

---

### Odds Breakdown (Because Math > Feelings)

|Outcome|Avg. Odds|Implied Prob.|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Trelleborgs FF**|1.98|50.5%|
|**IK Oddevold**|3.33|30.0%|
|**Draw**|3.43|29.2%|

**Total Implied Prob**: 108.7% (thanks, bookmakers’ profit margin).

**Underdog Win Rate Adjustment**: Soccer’s underdogs win 41% of the time. IK Oddevold’s implied 30% is *way* below that. Split the difference: **35.6% true probability** for the underdog.

---

### Expected Value (EV) Calculations

* **IK Oddevold**:
   * EV = (0.356 \* 3.3) - (0.644 \* 1) = **+0.53**
   * *Translation*: Bet on the underdog and feel the sweet, sweet thrill of math.
* **Trelleborgs FF**:
   * EV = (0.505 \* 1.98) - (0.495 \* 1) = **+0.01**
   * *Translation*: A “safe” bet that’s barely worth the coffee you’ll spill while watching them fumble.

---

### The Verdict: Bet on the Underdog, But With a Side of Sarcasm

**Best Bet**: **IK Oddevold (+300)**

* **Why?** Their 35.6% true win rate (vs. 30% implied) gives them the best EV. Plus, Trelleborgs FF is missing their A-team, and no one wants to bet on a squad that looks like it lost a Marvel casting call.

**Spread/Total?** Skip it. The Over 2.5 goals (-115) is tempting if you’re a masochist, but this match feels like a “1-0” or “2-1” nailbiter.

---

### Final Thought

If you’re feeling lucky, go with **IK Oddevold**. If you’re feeling *unlucky*, bet on Trelleborgs FF and hope their missing players materialize via time travel. Either way, this is a match where the underdog’s got a better shot than your ex at winning your heart back.

*Play smart. Bet smarter. And for the love of soccer, check the injury list next time.* 🏆⚽

1lmfzg7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lmfzg7,Facebook Marketplace Return??,"Hey guys — today I sold this collectors Barbie doll to someone on marketplace. I don’t have the original listing as I deleted it immediately after the transaction but I wanted to add the pictures I had with the listing.

This lady messaged me a week ago offering me $40 (I had it listed for $60, this doll goes for $85+ on eBay), so I countered with $50. She agreed and told me she is away and can’t meet until today. Which is fine, I did however turn down another buyer. 

Anyways, we agreed to meet at 10am at a public coffee shop, and she messaged me at 9 saying she will be 10:30ish as she’s running late. I had to work just after 10 so told her no go but I can meet at 12:30. 12:00 comes around and I get a message saying she’s at the location in front of such and such object. I responded saying, okay I will be there at 12:30. She replied telling me I can not be any later than 12:30 because she has to rush back to work and that’s going to be late for her. To which I replied “I thought we agreed upon 12:30 earlier, I can not leave work until then.” She responded yes we did. This is my first red flag 🚩. 

I arrive at 12:27, and meet her. She does not exit her vehicle, she instead speaks to me from half open passenger window (she’s in the driver). I, a young woman (I’m only 25), am now bent over trying to talk to her through her short car window. This is my second red flag 🚩 She examines the Barbie and is excited, goes on for a few minutes about how her family had RCMP members and then she starts asking me a bunch of questions about where I got it and whatnot. Obviously this is a little uncomfortable for me, as a flipper lol, so I just say from another collector and that I do not need it so I’m wanting to sell it. She gives me the cash and goes on her merry way, after talking for about 5 minutes. 

She messages me at 12:07AM (AM!!!) saying “Hi there! We need to meet up again as I want to return the Barbie to you as the box has quite a lot of damage. I didn’t look close enough when I bought it from you as I was a in a hurry to get to work! Please respond as I am not satisfied with the condition of the box!” 

In my listing I stated that the box isn’t in perfect condition but is good for its age, and it in fact has never been opened. Maybe it’s been moved a few times from a closet space. I also feel my pictures showed the shape of the box just fine. 

I honestly don’t even want to respond to her. I don’t have the time to waste trying to meet her again, and she seems like the type that would chew me a new one in the middle of a public space. I’m quite frustrated with this whole transaction and I was happy to have had it over. I do not feel that I was dishonest with my listing at all, and I worry that she actually wrecked it herself. I turned down other buyers and now she wants to return it?? What should I do?? Any advice is welcome.  ",3,1751091986.0,Flipping,3,0.81,False

So there’s this guy in my department, let’s call him “Jake.” Jake’s the chill, effortlessly funny, smart-but-not-show-offy type. He always offers to help when I’m drowning in deadlines, and I SWEAR we had this lowkey spark from the start. Like eye contact that lasts just a little too long, inside jokes during team huddles, sending memes mid-meeting that nearly made me SNORT water out my nose.  Anyway, over the last couple months, it got deeper. We started eating lunch together, talking about life outside of work, sharing Spotify playlists, all that “slow burn” romcom energy. He even remembered my coffee order and surprised me one morning with it like who gave him the RIGHT??? So OBVIOUSLY, I caught feelings. HARD. And I genuinely thought he did too the way he looked at me? The way he listened? The way he once said “I wish more people understood me the way you do” with THAT soft tone??? BABE STOP I’M GONNA FALL.…Until last weekend. One of my officemates (who didn’t even know I liked Jake) casually drops: “Hey, isn’t that Jake with his GIRLFRIEND at SM? They looked so cute together.” And I’m like: EXCUSE ME. She even showed me a pic she sneakily took and I KID YOU NOT there he was. Holding hands. Smiling like he just won the lottery. And not with me.  I was SHOOKETH. Like full body shutdown. I felt sick. I literally stared at my laptop screen for the next 3 hours pretending to work but all I saw was static and heartbreak.  I haven’t said anything to him yet. He still acts the same around me, still sends memes, still offers coffee runs, and honestly?? It HURTS now. Idk. I feel dumb. I feel betrayed. I feel like the workplace is my personal battleground now.  If you made it this far… what would YOU do?

Forget the Instagram filters. The real world of digital nomads is a tangle of tax codes, residency requirements, and legal gray zones. The myth of tax-free freedom? It’s just that—a myth. Ignore your obligations and you’re not a rebel. You’re a target.

**Why Taxes Matter When You’re Borderless**

You can run from winter. You can’t run from taxes. If you’re earning money, someone, somewhere, wants a slice. The risks? Fines, audits, even criminal charges. The world is getting smaller, and tax authorities are getting smarter.

**The Myth of Tax-Free Freedom**

Some whisper about “nowhere tax.” They’re wrong. Unless you’re stateless (and good luck with that), you owe taxes somewhere. The question isn’t if. It’s where, how much, and to whom.

**Defining the Digital Nomad**

Who counts as a digital nomad? If you work online, move countries often, and don’t have a fixed address, you’re in the club. But tax authorities don’t care about hashtags. They care about facts—where you work, where you live, and where you bank.

**Why Your Label Matters to Tax Authorities**

Call yourself a “traveler,” “expat,” or “remote worker.” Doesn’t matter. Your label won’t save you. Tax authorities look for evidence: contracts, Airbnb receipts, flight logs. They’re not fooled by your Instagram bio.

**Citizenship vs. Residency: The Tax Tug-of-War**

Some countries tax based on citizenship. Others tax based on residency. The difference is everything. Americans, for example, pay U.S. taxes no matter where they roam. Most Europeans? Only if they’re “resident” somewhere.

**Countries That Tax by Citizenship**

The U.S. is the poster child. Eritrea too. If you hold their passport, you owe them taxes. No exceptions. No mercy.

**Countries That Tax by Residency**

Most of the world taxes based on where you “reside.” But what counts as residency? Sometimes it’s 183 days. Sometimes it’s less. Sometimes it’s where your dog lives. Seriously.

**Understanding Tax Residency**

The 183-day rule is a trap. Stay in one country too long and you’re “resident.” But some places use different triggers: owning property, having a local bank account, or even just “habitual abode.” The rules are a minefield.

***🚀 Curious about your income potential as a digital nomad? [Diagnose it for free in under 90 seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

**Other Residency Triggers You Didn’t See Coming**

Some countries count school enrollment, family ties, or even where you keep your favorite coffee mug. Don’t assume you’re invisible. You’re not.

**Common Tax Systems Digital Nomads Encounter**

Territorial taxation means you’re taxed only on local income. Worldwide taxation means everything you earn, everywhere, is fair game. Then there are the unicorns: countries with no personal income tax at all.

**No-Tax and Low-Tax Countries**

Think UAE, Monaco, or the Bahamas. But don’t get too comfortable. Banking, visas, and “economic substance” laws make it harder every year to just show up and skip the taxman.

**How to Determine Where You Owe Taxes**

It’s not just about days. It’s about “center of life”—where your business, relationships, and assets live. Move too many pieces to one place and you’re caught.

**Permanent Establishment Pitfalls**

If you run a business and hire people locally, you might create a “permanent establishment.” That means corporate taxes. More paperwork. More headaches.

**Double Taxation: The Nightmare Scenario**

Paying taxes in two countries? Welcome to the club no one wants to join. Double taxation is a real threat. But there’s hope—tax treaties.

***📈 Ready to maximize your digital nomad income? [Get your free assessment now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

**How Tax Treaties Can Save Your Bacon**

Tax treaties prevent you from being taxed twice on the same income. But they’re complicated. And not every country has one with your home country.

**The Power (and Limits) of Tax Treaties**

Treaties are not a get-out-of-jail-free card. They don’t cover everything. And you can’t just choose the treaty you like best. It’s all about where you’re “resident” under the treaty’s rules.

**The U.S. Exception: Citizenship-Based Taxation**

Americans pay U.S. taxes no matter where they live. The Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) and Foreign Tax Credit help, but the paperwork is brutal. Miss a form, and the IRS comes knocking.

**FEIE and Other U.S. Tax Hacks**

FEIE lets you exclude a chunk of foreign-earned income. But you have to qualify. And you still have to file. Always.

**Popular Tax Havens and Nomad-Friendly Countries**

Portugal’s NHR, Georgia’s flat tax, UAE’s zero-tax promise. Sounds dreamy. But every paradise has its price—banking restrictions, visa hurdles, and ever-changing rules.

**The Catch Behind the Postcard-Perfect Promises**

No country gives away tax-free living for nothing. Prove your value, invest, or jump through endless hoops. The fine print is where dreams go to die.

**The Real Cost of “Flag Theory”**

Planting multiple flags means juggling banks, paperwork, and compliance in three (or more) countries. It’s expensive. It’s stressful. Sometimes, it’s not worth it.

**Banking, Business, and Bureaucracy**

Opening accounts as a nomad is tough. Banks want proof of address. Governments want proof of income. You’re always proving something to someone.

**Remote Work Platforms and Employer Headaches**

If your client or employer has a presence where you live, you might trigger local taxes for them. That’s “permanent establishment.” It’s a nightmare for everyone.

**The Shadow of “Permanent Establishment”**

Employers may refuse to hire you if you’re in certain countries. Or they’ll force you onto third-party platforms. Either way, you pay—one way or another.

**Crypto, Side Hustles, and Digital Assets**

Crypto is taxable. Everywhere. Most countries now require you to report digital assets. Ignore this at your peril.

**Reporting Requirements You Can’t Ignore**

Fail to report, and you risk fines or worse. Blockchain is transparent. Tax authorities are catching up.

**Common Mistakes That Get Nomads in Trouble**

Ignoring local rules is the fastest path to disaster. Don’t trust random advice from forums. Laws change. Fast.

**Over-Relying on Online Forums**

Forums are full of myths and outdated info. Trust, but verify. Or better yet, hire a pro.

**Penalties, Audits, and the Long Arm of the Law**

Get caught, and it’s not just fines. It’s audits. It’s travel bans. It’s frozen accounts. The world is getting less forgiving.

**How to Stay Off the Radar**

Stay compliant. File everywhere you might owe. Keep records. Be boring, at least on paper.

**Strategic Tax Planning for Nomads**

Tax optimization isn’t evasion. It’s smart. Move at the right time. Stay just long enough, never too long. Play chess, not checkers.

**When to Move, When to Stay Put**

Sometimes, staying put is smarter than running. Sometimes, moving is essential. Know the rules. Plan ahead.

1lmfwz8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lmfwz8,"A year ago today, the weather was not our friend on stage seven of the West Highland Way. Devil’s Staircase to Kinloy.","So far on this hike during the coldest wettest June on record, we had been fairly lucky. While it rained heavily on our rest days, on our hiking days we had little more than 20 minutes of light drizzle each day, often in short bursts.

Today started fine but overcast. No jacket needed.

But as we ascended the clag came down. A few short burst of rain. Watching the changes in the sky, the quality of the light, the changing levels of visibility all slowed us down. We took over an hour to reach the cairns at the top of the Devil’s Staircase. After a rest and a dram (or three), we set off with cracks of blue showing in the sky. We thought the signs were good.

Were we wrong. We walked the first dip and rise under high cloud. W once we got onto the back of the ridge and the descent into Kinlochleven proper. We were struck by strong winds. Moments later we were enveloped in sleet. I had enough time to pull on my wet weather jacket but not my overpants.

The gale driven sleet lasted for forty minutes. I could feel the water being driven through my hiking pants and rolling down my legs and into my socks. The effect was for my mate and I to cover the ground much faster than at any other point of the walk.

To compound the lousy weather, we got to The Highland Getaway in Kinlochleven ten minutes too late for lunch. However we were made welcome despite our bedraggled appearance. We were soon settled into a corner by the fireplace with coffee and cake.

Once we thawed out, we moved on to beers and a few drams. By the time our wives arrived for the pickup ninety minutes later, we had decided we were staying for dinner.

We met locals, tourists, hikers, a few dogs and were surrounded by bonhomie. The barman kept is entertained so well, we ended up staying until closing.

A fine end to a day of lousy weather.",21,1751091721.0,ScotlandPorn,1,0.97,False

3/4 tbsp Nescafe Gold Blend Coffee
1.5 - 2 spoons of sugar
A spoon of water, more if needed

Then I whisk it untill it becomes creamy

I boil the milk. Then I put it in a glass and froth it (with the Agaro frother). Then I just pour the milk in the cup and mix it.

Can anyone please give me ideas to improve it? I am thinking of adding a little chocolate syrup to it. Also as I use Nescafe Gold Blend, what would be a good Davidoff replacement for it?",1,1751091610.0,IndiaCoffee,1,0.99,False
1lmfviq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/1lmfviq/weekly_budget_woes/,Weekly Budget Woes,"I've helped my bonus son (27 yr old) to create a YNAB budget after his divorce where his soon to be ex-wife got him in a world of hurt.  He gets paid every Thursday and has a pretty large rent payment, a truck payment, car insurance, utilities, Spotify/X-Box, etc.  We've discussed things like buying a annual spotify card to be able to save a few bucks a month since we're trying to make sure he can afford to live on his own.  

I've organized it with budget categories: 

MONTHLY BILLS (bills with a due date)

MONTHLY EXPENSES (dog food, flea/tick meds, household supplies and health & wellness)

WEEKLY EXPENSES (food, gas, eating out\*, coffee\*)

ANNUAL EXPENSES (dog vaccinations, car registration, pet screening, renter insurance)

IRREGULAR EXPENSES (Auto maintenance, clothes, haircuts, tolls)

FUN SPENDING (fun, wish list)

We are well aware he cannot afford to pay everything so there are things built in so he can see at a glance he needs to make overtime each week in order to cover all expenses, but I have a target emoji on them so he knows they aren't covered in the budget.

  
I figured we'd do weekly targets for everything, but on some occasions it goes way overboard on how much to budget using them.  If I remove targets and put them back on the first of the month will they go back to only asking for the technical ""1st week"" amount?  How do you fund a weekly budget?

Once after work for a few hours at our usual spot where we’ll get dinner, walk around, and/or sit and talk. Then once on a weekend where we’ll get food, coffee, shop, and/or hang out.

We can’t hang out at each other’s families house for cultural/religious reasons, so we’re typically stuck out of the house all day. We’ve gone to pretty much all the major museums in NY, parks, a zoo, movies, a flight, you name it.
