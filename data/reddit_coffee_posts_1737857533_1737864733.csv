1ia5ho8,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1ia5ho8/am_i_wrong_for_not_allowing_my_mothers_husband_in/,Am I wrong for not allowing my mothers husband in my home,"About 2 months ago, I (F50) told my mother (F75) that her husband (M67) was no longer welcome in my home. My mom and her husband have been married for about 23 years, I've disliked him from day 1. He's said some really terrible things to my husband, son, and mother over the years. Examples include saying on separate occasions that he's only with my mom for her money, calling my husband who has a chronic medical condition a chronic morphine abuser, and getting my son to pay for accomodations when he took him on a b-day trip (he also asked him how much $ he had in his bank account). There's a laundry list of other things he's said and done as well.



The few times I've spoken to my mother about this, she says she'll deal with it but won't discuss the issue with me and turns very cold. Every time her husband says/does something she's not around to see or hear it. I don't know if she doesn't believe me, or refuses to acknowledge what's happened.



After I told her that her husband wasn't welcome in my home, she said her husband wanted to speak with me, I agreed to talk to him for her sake. When I asked him why he said he was with my mom for her $, he said he had been drinking (regular occurrence) and that it was a joke. He said he didn't call my husband a chronic morphine abuser, but instead a chronic morphine used (semantics), and that it was retaliatory because my husband told him he'd had too much to drink. The husband came up a completely different version of what happened on the birthday trip with my son.



I told the husband that I don't like him and don't trust him. I haven't spoken to my mother about the conversation I had with her husband, I'm waiting for her to bring it up. My question is was I wrong to not allow him in my home, and how do I maintain a good relationship with my mother? We live about 6 hours away from each other so it's not as easy as taking her out for dinner/coffee once a week.

I don‚Äôt feel as though his treatment towards me is fair.,"I am 19 F and have been working at my position as a front desk agent in a hotel for 9 months now. I love my job, I love the company and love everyone I work with. Except my boss‚Ä¶

I moved out to the coast for a job here fresh out of high school and it was a dream come true. For the first 9 months I worked as a house keeper and transfers to front desk last may. 
As I was still training in this position, I didn‚Äôt know everything, my boss John, had little to none patience for this and still now as I‚Äôve grown into my position and believe I am a good competent worker, this attitude he was towards me is still present.. Now John has a reputation for being rude or impatience with others. But this is particularly directed towards me. For more context, the company I work for, values kindness and respect and even sets these principles for there employees. Ex. Be kind to everyone, respect and help other etc. Anything other than that is not tolerated.. this is why my predicament is so frustrating. 

The main example of this, is unnecessary feedback. Ex. Almost everyday he brings something up with me that is either something he knows I already know, or just completely unnecessary. Of course there are times, especially in the beginning, where this feedback was helpful, and I take it as that, I am respectful, thank him, and move on. But now that I feel I am making little to no mistakes, and I am still receiving feedback daily I am beginning to see how condescending he is being towards me. I feel as though he‚Äôs only doing it to pick at my confidence. There will be days when I come in with a cute outfit, a good mood and am feeling confident. I‚Äôve noticed that these days are often the worst‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll cry in the bathroom and have my confidence taken away from me for the rest of that shift. It‚Äôs either things, I‚Äôm already doing, that he‚Äôs knows I know and just haven‚Äôt gotten too or just small things I‚Äôve missed. If he approached me in a kind manner, these things would still be so trivial, but not as nearly as bothersome and I would receive it in such a better way. Some examples of this‚Ä¶
I often work the evening shifts and am left alone for the night, the night is when the most frustrating circumstances come about. In the beginning of my training, of course I missed some things or had to call for help. I don‚Äôt believe I am like that anymore, I am good in my position and great at problem solving. This one event was after a few months at the front desk. My co-worker and I were each checking in guests, they leave for the night and I am left alone for the night. The guest that my co-worker had checked in 2 minutes before comes to the desk exclaiming that their card doesn‚Äôt work for the door. When we check guests in we write our name on the envelopes on the folders that hold the cards. This is how I know it was my co-worker that had checked them in‚Ä¶.
They come back 5 minutes later, letting me know that they had walked into a guests room while they were doing the deed. Of course this was not ok, and very unprofessional. I apologies profusely and gave them our  large sweet as compensation. Both couples were very kind and understanding and were able to laugh it off. It turns out my co-worker had written the wrong room number on the envelope. This was not a big deal, mistakes happen.
I handled it like a champ and knew I had nothing to worry about the next day as it was not my fault and I dealt with it in the best way possible. 
The next day John pulls me a side and asked me what happened, I told him the situation and that we had figured it out. Of course even when everything was perfectly explained, he still found space to critique me. Even when it wasn‚Äôt my fault. I was blamed for this incident, on my ‚Äúreport card‚Äù‚Ä¶.
A month or so later on the assistant GM pulled me a side for a check up. These are routinely with everyone and are a way for the higher ups to get a feel of how the employees are doing. He had a piece of paper in his hand and mentioned a few of my small mistakes. I was either to explain my mistakes and thinking behind such or gladly exclaim I had learned from that mistake, a while ago‚Ä¶ 
Later on as I‚Äôm working the night shift alone, I find this paper he had earlier that day. It was upsetting to say the least. It was clearly written by John and was worded as if he wanted me gone. The incident that was mentioned earlier was on it, where he had written that it was my fault‚Ä¶ other things that were a small mistake or something I learned and dealt with were on there. Of course there were one or two things I own up to, but the lack of space to fail is suffocating. I was upset to find this paper, things like ‚Äúshe failed too‚Äù were capitalized and the whole thing was dramatized. This to me did not seem like productive feedback in anyway. The GM who brought it to my attention, was k one and worded it nicely, we had a conversation later where I let him know that this pressure form John was counterproductive and not very respectful towards me. He agreed, and it settled for a bit..  
Another incident I think of is when we I was checking in a guest. John was over my shoulder, as usual‚Ä¶ as I mentioned earlier, John doesn‚Äôt have the best attitude and has received a couple negative reviews from guests about his attitude‚Ä¶ I am the opposite. I am friendly, respectful and enjoying engaging with the guest and am quite good at it! 
This particular day I wasn‚Äôt feeling as high energy as usual, but still, I was still extremely friendly and accommodating. After the check in when the guest walked away, John had the nerve to begin to tell me that I need to be more friendly and smile more. I was quite shocked and have since realized that a lot of these comments are not for actual growth but only to diminish my confidence. And that it does‚Ä¶ 
Everyday this is an on going issue, and I know others notice, but because it is  disguised as ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù there hasn‚Äôt anything been done. 
Another thing that may or may not play a factor in my treatment is that my boyfriend works at the same hotel in maintenance‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs been a rumour that John has a crush on him. Ex. My boyfriend, Asher, told me a story he heard from a friend who used to work at front desk. One day as Asher was walking away from the front desk, he says ‚Äúoh the things I would do to that boy.‚Äù Other times John plays with Asher‚Äôs sweater strings and asks non work related favours of him. Or just obviously flirtatious actions through body language.  Like I said I‚Äôm not sure if this plays a part in my treatment or not‚Ä¶ but if it would explain some things.

Another thing I‚Äôve noticed is his pretentious attitude. My old boss from housekeeping. I LOVED. He was so kind and when feedback was needed he approached it in such an effective, kind and compassionate manner. He did not have any underlying energy involved and never looked down at us of thought of himself as more. He would even clean rooms when the team needed it and was more than happy to help, and is what a team leader should be. John on the other hand.. 
there are many small tasks to be done at the desk that doesn‚Äôt involve the guest, ex restocking our coffee program, cleaning the lobby, etc. I haven‚Äôt once seen him do these things‚Ä¶
I do not believe is living by our company‚Äôs ‚Äúvalues‚Äù. I don‚Äôt want him to get fired or anything, that would just be mean. But I‚Äôm tired of being picked on and have realized this treatment is simply bullying. When tensions between us are high I can almost feel him looking for things to critique me on. Even as I‚Äôve grown into my position and make little mistakes. One day, out of frustration, I phoned my mom and exclaimed my situation, she told me to write all of these events down as evidence. Of course I didn‚Äôt do that and am left 
 With the things I can think of off the top of my head. She said if I get enough I can go to the GM. The last couple days have been bad‚Ä¶ the past few weeks I tried to change my perspective into fighting fire with fire. Of course I‚Äôm always still respectful, I just simply tolerate less.. I believe you teach people how to treat you. I don‚Äôt feel like this has worked in my favour, but only made the feedback more trivial. I can feel myself getting shorter with him  everyday. I am serious considering going to the GM but have no idea if this is something I could even mention as the nature of it is so passive aggressive. I often have the thought that maybe I am just that incompetent and deserving of this ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù. Of course I know this isn‚Äôt true, still I feel very conflicted. If I did have a conversation I don‚Äôt even know what I would want to come out of it. You can‚Äôt just demand better treatment out of someone like that. This passive aggression and counterproductive ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù is daily and only eating at my confidence. I don‚Äôt want it deal with it anymore and just want to be a respect part of the time. Me and John don‚Äôt have a good relationship, not compared to the other workers, and I often feel like the underdog. When I began training I accepted that, but now as I‚Äôve gained confidence in my ability to do my position and new people have started working, I realized it nots about being the newest worker. It‚Äôs about me. I know being a boss can be hard so I try hard to empathize with him, but not at my own expense. 
I guess my questions are how do I deal with this? Are my feelings valid? Should I talked to a higher up??

1ia56ko,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ia56ko,CRW dinner at Bazaar Meat.,"I went for the $60 5-course dinner at Bazaar Meat and had a fun, theatrical experience. The food was delicious, service was wonderful, and my party walked away feeling like it was a great deal. I'd come back again outside of Chicago Restaurant Week.

We were welcomed with complimentary glasses of champagne, which was a nice start to the evening and indicative of the warm hospitality to come. We all opted for the CRW menu, but after watching the jam√≥n cart go by a few times, we decided we couldn't miss out on that either. I also opted for the nitro-caipirinha cocktail, which came with a highly entertaining tableside presentation involving liquid nitrogen. I forgot to take a photo of my drink but it was basically a boozy slushy. 

1 - Foie gras cream puff. This was a nice little savory bite to start the meal, with a delightfully crunchy exterior and decadent filling.

2 - ""Bites:"" not your everyday caprese salad (top), bagel and lox cones (middle), & chicken croquetas (bottom). This was a fun trio and we were pleasantly surprised that the CRW menu came with all three options. All were delicious and we were evenly split between which were our favorite bites. Mine was the caprese on a spoon because it was so refreshing and well-balanced.

3 - Coffee rub hanger steak (bottom), with buttered potato pur√©e and piquillo peppers (top). Okay, this plate wasn't the most attractive, but my steak was perfectly seared and had a deep, rich flavor from its spice rub. We all loved the ultra smooth, buttery-as-hell mashed potatoes and I also liked the accompanying acidity of the peppers. 

4 - Key lime tart plus surprise bon bons. I liked both desserts but preferred the tart. The tart had a strong citrus flavor, a properly thin pastry crust, and wasn't cloyingly sweet. The bon bons had a filling reminiscent of crema catalana and were very sugary. We also got an extra bag of popcorn (Chicago mix style) on our way out the door, so I even have snacks for another day.

5 - Chicago Restaurant Week 2025 menu.

6 & 7 - Jam√≥n experience. They carved this tableside for us. We all agreed it was lovely, high quality meat comparable to what we'd had abroad.

8 & 9 - Restaurant interior. It was a bit crowded and space was tight, probably due to CRW. The pacing of courses was also slow, but not intolerable with good company.",13,1737863346.0,chicagofood,2,1.0,False

My mom and her husband have been married for about 23 years, I've disliked him from day 1. He's said some really terrible things to my husband, son, and mother over the years. Examples include saying on separate occasions that he's only with my mom for her money, calling my husband who has a chronic medical condition a chronic morphine abuser, and getting my son to pay for accomodations when he took him on a b-day trip (he also asked him how much $ he had in his bank account). There's a laundry list of other things he's said and done as well.  

The few times I've spoken to my mother about this, she says she'll deal with it but won't discuss the issue with me and turns very cold. Every time her husband says/does something she's not around to see or hear it. I don't know if she doesn't believe me, or refuses to acknowledge what's happened. 

After I told her that her husband wasn't welcome in my home, she said her husband wanted to speak with me, I agreed to talk to him for her sake. When I asked him why he said he was with my mom for her $, he said he had been drinking (regular occurrence) and that it was a joke. He said he didn't call my husband a chronic morphine abuser, but instead a chronic morphine used (semantics), and that it was retaliatory because my husband told him he'd had too much to drink. The husband came up a completely different version of what happened on the birthday trip with my son. 

I told the husband that I don't like him and don't trust him. I haven't spoken to my mother about the conversation I had with her husband, I'm waiting for her to bring it up. My question is was I wrong to not allow him in my home, and how do I maintain a good relationship with my mother?  We live about 6 hours away from each other so it's not as easy as taking her out for dinner/coffee once a week.

With Arnold away, Josh decides to explore the benefits of an open relationship by inviting a man named Ben, leading to a night of revelations.
 
Notes:
- I‚Äôm with Tom, don‚Äôt question why a pinata exists. ‚ÄúWould you ask a divorced man why he joins a pottery class?‚Äù. Nobody appreciates Tom‚Äôs creative endeavours

- I like the pinata of secrets, but raise an eyebrow to Tom shading the other two for keeping a secret.

- Return of Arrrrnie! Joooshie! Cute that once again, Tom shares his secrets with Arnold.

- ‚ÄúI thought it was a phase, like Gangnam style.‚Äù

- Losing the passport in Thailand and having Diarrhea sounds like a ‚Äúripped from real life‚Äù situation  

- Who invites a hookup over when friends/roommates are around? Feeling nervous about room smell is legit tho

- Wonder if they cast for a serial killer, cuz dude ended up looking like a serial killer.

- All of Josh‚Äôs concerns are real. That sense of regret and wishing you could just eat glazed ham instead of hooking up- oof. For real. And also, a tinge of the ‚Äòtism 

- Was the plane crash referencing a real event?

- Ben is like Geoffrey as a serial killer.

- Josh prolonging what should be a ten minute hook up also feels like an autism thing.

- Ben talking about Ted Hughes, Sylvia Plath and suicide before going in for the kiss‚Ä¶ ugh.

- Usually I mention this beforehand, but this is another episode I kinda hate. I never liked the non-monogamous thing, I didn‚Äôt like how Arnold prompted it but Josh was the one to do it AND get punished for it. Then Ben shows up and there‚Äôs so much cringe for me‚Ä¶and I don‚Äôt like Ben‚Äôs dead eyes. Toss in Claire just kinda being terrible. 

- On that note, we got the whole abortion storyline, but I feel like we only barely get a taste of Claire‚Äôs malaise, then she‚Äôs off. But there is so much angst in Claire I‚Äôve wanted that explored. Alas. Anyone confirm if Caitlin Stasey was disliked?

- Ha. Is it Autism alert if Ben literally talks about being tested for Asperger‚Äôs?

- Penis. Not penis. Forever stuck in my brain. 

- I‚Äôm going to pretend that Tom and Claire decided that Josh had sex at least once, so they could freely annoy them after that

- Funny thing with Josh and Ben is that for me, I‚Äôd likely do all the non sex stuff instead of the actual sex. But also. How rude is it to sequester your roomies for a hook up you not only prolong but move throughout the house? 

- Ben is also just a huge downer. And cringe. And Josh doesn‚Äôt wanna do this. 

- Josh calling his dad ‚Äúlovely‚Äù. My heart.

- Ben having an aneurysm reveal is like Geoffrey crying over his dead dad. 

- I kinda prefer cer-eb-ral as opposed to cer-eeeb-ral tbh.

Both are mobile and do ok physically- but cognitively, there has been a significant shift. My MIL has been dealing with this for about 2 or so years, with my FIL caring for her.  We thought everything was going well...until it wasn't. We suddenly realized that my FIL's typical ""bad memory"" wasn't just forgetting things here and there, but dementia had taken hold. I think he was able to ""mask"" for a while until it got to be bigger than he is. In the last month and a half, we have been working on care for them, POAs, the whole nine yards.  It's been incredibly stressful. They want to stay at home and so we want to try to accommodate that for as long as possible. 

We have discovered that my FIL is still using the stove/oven. He has been told that he can't be using it, and because he (and his wife) can't use it, we bring them homemade, prepackaged microwave meals for them to reheat in the microwave.

Despite filling their fridge with meals to microwave, my FIL is ordering groceries and orders food he would need the stove/oven to prepare (Chicken breast, french fries, fish sticks, etc.) We have told him numerous times that he is not to use the stove or oven. (He is also making grocery orders, ordering the things he already has, or things he ordered in the previous order... for example... toilet paper... the same 12 pack package 4 days apart, coffee he already has, wet cat food (we are at 23 cans now), etc.) 

Anyway, we are thinking we need to make the stovetop and oven unusable. We can't just unplug it because he is mobile/able enough that he would probably pull the stove away from the wall and just plug it back in. 

I know that removing the knobs could be a solution for the cooktop, but what about the oven door? We can't just unplug it because he is the type of person who would just plug it back in. Is there a lock we can get for the oven door so that it cannot be opened? 

Anything I have seen online is ""baby proof"", and just requires holding a clip or something to open it, so he would be able to take off. I need something that cannot be opened. I'm thinking something with a key (so I can have the key on my keychain and could use the oven if we need to when we are there), or a magnet release that requires a magnet to open. 

Any suggestions? I've included a pic of their stove for reference. 

  
Thanks so much.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve come for your world, John Riley,‚Äù she rumbles, her voice shaking reality itself. I‚Äôm supposed to be terrified, right? Like, I should be pissing my pants.

But, instead? I take another drag off my cigarette, lean on the balcony like I‚Äôm about to give her a TED talk, and say, ‚ÄúYeah, I heard you. But, uh, you ever think you‚Äôre going about this all wrong? I mean, look at me, Brit. I‚Äôm fucking awesome. Why destroy me when you could have me on your side? I‚Äôm the best thing left in the universe, and you wanna just eat me? Nah, babe. We can work something out.‚Äù

I‚Äôm just throwing out ideas. Maybe she‚Äôll bite. Who knows? It‚Äôs the universe‚Äôs greatest cosmic devourer, and here I am offering myself like a Thanksgiving turkey. She blinks, her mind trying to process this, and I can tell no one‚Äôs ever dared reject annihilation like this.

She‚Äôs curious. The whole void-shaking, galaxy-crushing entity is scratching its head, trying to figure out what the hell is wrong with me.

‚ÄúAre you serious?‚Äù she asks, dripping with confusion. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre offering yourself to me, human? Do you not understand that I consume worlds? I devour the very fabric of reality itself?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, yeah, I get it,‚Äù I interrupt, because who‚Äôs got time for long-winded speeches when the universe is collapsing? ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a big deal. The ultimate badass. But why you gotta be so rough about it? Have you ever considered the art of... I don‚Äôt know... conversation?‚Äù

She stares at me, her thousand eyes blinking like she‚Äôs trying to figure out how to deal with a human who doesn‚Äôt give a flying fuck about being devoured. This is rich.

‚ÄúListen, Brit,‚Äù I say, now leaning back in my lounge chair like I‚Äôm about to order a damn pizza. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre tearing apart planets, but you‚Äôre really just running from your problems. You don‚Äôt need to eat everything to feel better. How about this: let‚Äôs chill. I‚Äôll tell you all about Earth, humanity, all that wild shit. You wanna know what love is, Brit? It‚Äôs not consuming everything in sight. It‚Äôs... well... being here. With someone. Just vibing through the chaos.‚Äù

And for a second, just one second, I think I might‚Äôve gotten through to her. There‚Äôs a weird silence, like the universe is holding its breath. I stand there, waiting for the cosmic explosion of destruction to come, but instead? Brit, this eldritch god of consumption, just... stares at me.

‚ÄúYou think... you think you can teach me this... love?‚Äù she asks, her voice quieter now. There‚Äôs a hesitation, a crack in the void.

‚ÄúSure, why not? I‚Äôm pretty good at it,‚Äù I say, crossing my arms like I‚Äôm the fucking expert in existential love. ‚ÄúJust... maybe hold off on the whole ‚Äòdevouring everything‚Äô thing for a while. What‚Äôs the worst that could happen? You could eat me, or... you could just hang out for once.‚Äù

For a moment, nothing happens. The planets are still dying, the universe is still crumbling, and I‚Äôm still standing here, having the most bizarre conversation of my life with an entity that could erase me with a thought. But then? Slowly, she leans in. Just a little. Like she‚Äôs actually... curious.

‚ÄúI do not understand you, little human,‚Äù she whispers, her voice now a strange, soft thing. ‚ÄúBut... I find myself intrigued.‚Äù

And just like that? I, John Riley, a guy who‚Äôs had nothing to lose since I got out of bed this morning, have successfully seduced a literal cosmic destroyer. I don‚Äôt even know what the hell is going on anymore.

‚ÄúAlright, Brit,‚Äù I say with a grin, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see where this goes.‚Äù

And the universe? Well, it keeps collapsing, sure. But now? Now, instead of mindlessly devouring everything, Brit‚Äôs got something new to think about. Love. The universe‚Äôs biggest horror is stuck in an existential crisis about her feelings, and me? I‚Äôm just along for the ride, cracking jokes like I‚Äôm talking to an old friend.

Maybe this isn't what they mean when they talk about relationship goals, but maybe I can help her see what love's all about.",11,1737862160.0,HFY,4,1.0,False

This was a year ago but I think about it often. It was 4 or 5 before my period was due. I started experiencing pregnancy symptoms.

I was extremely constipated, even two cups of coffee couldn't help me. I was extremely thirsty and hungry. 

I had to eat every hour to two hours, it was like my stomach was a bottomless pit. I had to pee more frequently, like every 30 min to an hour.

My sense of smell was insane. It was like smells were hitting me in the face and I was hyper sensitive to it.

My boobs were sore. They felt tingly almost and I couldn't sleep without wearing a sports bra because it was uncomfortable to lay on them.

I also had a weird sweet taste in my mouth I couldn't get rid of no matter how much I drank.


Now I was on vacation with my family and now fianc√© so there was no us going to the store by ourselves for a pregnancy test.

I was completely convinced I was pregnant. I never experienced symptoms like that ever before in my life and haven't since.

I just remember getting my period on time as per usual and being so sad.

Like the whole vacation I was freaking out thinking I was pregnant and then I wasn't. And instead of being relieved I was so sad.

I haven't really felt any closure with this as I never took a test or had any indication that I actually was pregnant besides my intense symptoms.",1,1737862101.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

That I you for making your presence known to us we welcome you into our family (not like a pet but like an ‚Äúfuncle‚Äù seeing how you are cognizant of yourself and us‚Ä¶ I think). Here is the rundown of this family :
Alex(Dad): works outside of home; sleeps in weird patterns (mostly not sleeping at night but will nap so quickly ‚Ä¶ no dad lie of ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt sleeping I was resting my eyes ‚Äú either); likes to use pie dish has a plate(I know I don‚Äôt get it but it works).
Jen(Mom): stay at home mom with AdHD (so if you move my stuff I will not notice but I suggest you don‚Äôt at 1st just to see me struggle with my own brain); will pebble anyone (‚Äúthis made me think of you‚Äù hands over item)(let me know what you like if you can);forgets to eat or just over drinks coffee. 
Stan(Baby) just turned one;will not eat sleep or poop on any form of schedule (we are working on this); likes mom but is her bully; more to fallow 
Zeus (bigger of the 2 dogs) lazy bull terrier; eats everything 
Hades(smaller of the 2 dogs) hyper beagle; eats everything 
Leo(cat) asshat (that is the best description for him) maybe can see you ‚Ä¶. He won‚Äôt tell me 


 Now on to the difficult part some requests for you: could you please tone it down at night not to be rude but we have a baby that we are working on a sleep schedule. Just until he is sleeping through the night and then we can work up to a level that you can still do your ghost work (is it work or a hobby? Genuinely curious) and the baby can sleep. And not that this is in any way a requirement but could you help with like the utilities or something (I mean even if your help is turning off lights my adhd self left on) that would be appreciated.

In return  I could do something for you: I read you all like when people say your name (I will do more research on that) we can talk about food offerings if your interested in that(I cook well but nothing fancy) or make some form of an alter to give you your own personal space seeing how we have take all the bedrooms and communal spaces. 

Let me know how you feel about this and know that i am absolutely happy to have you with us 

For yes move chairs into from dinner table 
For no move chairs away 
For negotiations with us do 2 and 2

I made the mistake of denying instead of just sucking it up and doing it, and he completely lost it on me. From what I'm gathering, he stopped initiating and made the ""mistake"" of initiating the other night only to be denied.
For context:
We have been married for almost 20 years. No kids but very busy professional lives and personal lives. I have 2 jobs (one a business) and so I am often running around. I am also a bit of an insomniac and my husband borders on narcoleptic (he really just loves to sleep). We have had a rocky relationship for years. We love each other and wanted the same things but didn't know how to talk to each other. We have gone through multiple therapists but as of almost a year ago, we decided to separate spaces, but continue seeing each other. This helped the DB issue initially as we felt like we were dating but it quickly fizzled as the real issues came out.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago and my husband and I decided to call it quits. We had a long conversation and we decided that we were ultimately done in the relationship. I wanted to stay friends. After speaking a little bit longer, we decided to give it a last ditch effort as both of us just didn't want to see the relationship ending. Both of us stepped up in a real way. I felt like he was listening to me more, he was doing nice things without being asked like make my morning coffee for me. He was mansplaining less to me‚Ä¶ Which is something I asked for because he was constantly educating me. I in turn have been less cold and shit off, I have been more appreciative, I have been listening more. I have apologized more when it's something that is difficult for me to do and have overall felt a lot closer to him. But I also noticed in this time in the last few weeks, my husband has stopped initiating, which has been really helpful for me because it's a big burden on our relationship.

Despite all of this, we continue to have a DB. I do want to clarify that I do fantasize about my husband,  the few times I have a desire, but when time comes to initiate or to take action, I freeze or get the ick and can't follow through. We have been told by multiple therapist to try and have non-sexual intimacy be part of our relationship. We've been told to hug more and kiss more and cuddle more without it leading to sex. But every time we try, if ever, my husband always leads right to sex, which is very frustrating for me and ultimately why I continue to feel shut off when the time comes. My husband explains to me that he can't help it, and even if he could, it would probably not change anything in our dynamic‚Ä¶ Which is very frustrating for me to hear. Sometimes I wish he would just disregard my denial and would just take me and half me, but I know that I would immediately start yelling at him to stop.

I love him very much and I know that he loves me but I know that these feelings can only get a relationship so far and I'm afraid that he has reached his end and I don't know how to change things. We have a lot of work to do, but I think having a good sex life would help us in many aspects of the relationship.

Ok thanks for coming to my Ted talk and sorry for the rant, but wanted to share some perspective from an LL and would love to hear from other LL's experiencing the same feelings.",2,1737861384.0,DeadBedrooms,5,1.0,False

Chapter 1
The cafe‚Äôs bell jingled as Beau pushed open the door, a wave of warm air brushing over him. He spotted Sierra immediately‚Äîpolished and poised as ever, sitting in her usual seat by the window. Her sleek black hair gleamed under the soft light, and her phone rested beside a half-empty latte. She looked like she always did: flawless, as if she belonged on the cover of a magazine.

For a moment, Beau paused, his hand lingering on the door frame. The sight of Sierra, perfectly composed and scrolling through her phone, sent a flicker of unease through him. It wasn‚Äôt anything specific, just a quiet, nagging tension that had become all too familiar. He shifted the strap of his bag on his shoulder, forcing himself forward.

She glanced up and smiled, her teeth bright against her lipstick. ‚ÄúMorning, handsome!‚Äù

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù he replied, sliding into the seat across from her.

‚ÄúI went ahead and ordered for you. Same as always.‚Äù She gestured toward the counter, where a barista was placing a cup on a tray.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù he said. He appreciated the gesture‚Äîor at least, he wanted to. Instead, it felt like one more reminder of how Sierra always seemed to know what he needed better than he did.

She tucked her phone into her bag and leaned forward slightly, resting her elbows on the table. Her eyes sparkled with purpose, and Beau braced himself.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she started, her voice bright but laced with intent, ‚ÄúI talked to my father last night.‚Äù

His stomach tightened. That tone meant trouble. ‚ÄúOh?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe knows someone at Bluewater Insurance. They‚Äôre hiring, and he thinks you‚Äôd be a great fit. He said if you send over your resume, he‚Äôll make sure it gets into the right hands.‚Äù

Beau frowned, his jaw tightening. ‚ÄúInsurance?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs stable,‚Äù she said, as though that settled the matter. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not exactly glamorous, but it‚Äôs steady, and the pay‚Äôs decent. You could finally move out of that tiny apartment and get something closer to me.‚Äù

Of course, that was the real point. Beau forced a polite smile, but his stomach churned. He couldn‚Äôt think of anything worse than sitting at a desk in some beige office building, selling policies he didn‚Äôt care about. But it wasn‚Äôt just the job‚Äîit was the thought of living closer to Sierra, of letting their lives intertwine in the way she so clearly wanted. The weight on his chest grew heavier.

‚ÄúI like my apartment,‚Äù he said finally, though even to his own ears, it sounded like an excuse.

‚ÄúBeau,‚Äù Sierra said, her voice softening in the way it always did when she was about to press harder, ‚Äúyou know it‚Äôs not enough. You‚Äôre wasting so much potential. And honestly, you‚Äôve got that old house you inherited just sitting there, doing nothing. If you sold it, you‚Äôd have enough to get a decent place near me.‚Äù

Of course. The house. She always found a way to bring it up, like a splinter she couldn‚Äôt stop picking at. Beau exhaled sharply through his nose, the irritation resurfacing in his chest.

His gaze dropped to the swirling coffee in his mug. The house in Stonehaven was a knot he couldn‚Äôt untangle, a mix of guilt, grief, and memories he wasn‚Äôt ready to face. Every time someone brought it up, it felt like a trap.

‚ÄúSierra‚Ä¶‚Äù His voice was low, a warning.

But she pressed on. ‚ÄúBe honest,‚Äù she said, leaning forward slightly. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of holding onto it? It‚Äôs been sitting there for two years. No one‚Äôs touched it. It‚Äôs just costing you money in taxes and upkeep. You could sell it and finally move on with your life.‚Äù

Move on. The words stung in a way he couldn‚Äôt explain. He hadn‚Äôt been back to Stonehaven since before his grandfather‚Äôs passing, and he knew that  he never wanted. The house wasn‚Äôt just some old property to him‚Äîit was tied to those last two summers spent before college, to Isla, to the life he‚Äôd lost in one horrible moment. But explaining that to Sierra felt impossible. She wouldn‚Äôt understand.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that simple,‚Äù Beau said, his tone sharper than he intended.

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù Sierra pressed, her eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs some family home you grew up in. You‚Äôve barely even been there, right? What‚Äôs holding you back?‚Äù

What wasn‚Äôt holding him back? Beau swallowed hard, trying to push down the wave of frustration rising in his chest. He could feel her words closing in around him, like a net tightening with every question she asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll deal with it when I‚Äôm ready,‚Äù he said finally, though even he wasn‚Äôt sure what that meant.

Sierra sighed, leaning back and crossing her arms. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been saying that since I met you, Beau. And let‚Äôs be real‚Äîyou‚Äôre never going to be ready. At some point, you have to stop running and actually deal with your life.‚Äù

Her words cut deep, sharper than he expected. Running. She wasn‚Äôt wrong, but hearing it out loud made him feel like the floor beneath him had given way.

Beau stared at his mug, the swirl of coffee chaotic and relentless, like his own thoughts. She didn‚Äôt get it. She never had. Every conversation with her felt like a slow push toward a future he didn‚Äôt want‚Äîa life filled with shared calendars, compromises, and expectations he couldn‚Äôt meet. The truth settled heavily in his chest: he didn‚Äôt want the life she was trying to build with him.

Hell, he didn‚Äôt want to share a life with anyone. He could barely manage his own without someone trying to wedge their way into every corner of it. The thought snapped into place with startling clarity, sharp and unforgiving.

‚ÄúI think we both know this isn‚Äôt working,‚Äù he said, his voice quiet but resolute.

Sierra blinked, caught off guard. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this anymore,‚Äù Beau said, finally meeting her gaze. ‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ us‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs too much. I feel like I‚Äôm suffocating.‚Äù

Her expression hardened, her hands gripping the edges of the table. ‚ÄúUnbelievable,‚Äù she said, her voice icy. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre blaming me for this? For trying to help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not blaming anyone,‚Äù Beau said, standing. ‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt keep pretending like this is what I want.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she said sharply, her voice rising. ‚ÄúGo ahead. Run away. That‚Äôs what you do, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

Beau pulled a few bills from his wallet and set them on the table. He paused, looking at her one last time, but the words he wanted to say wouldn‚Äôt come. Instead, he turned and walked toward the door.

As he stepped outside, the cold air hit him like a slap, sharp and biting against his skin. He drew in a deep breath, his lungs burning, but for the first time in months, the weight in his chest began to ease.
The door clicked shut behind him, and Beau let out a slow breath, shrugging off his coat and tossing it onto the back of a chair. The quiet of his apartment wasn‚Äôt comforting, exactly, but it felt steady‚Äîunchanging. He kicked off his shoes, leaving them where they landed, and sank into the chair at his desk.

The breakup with Sierra barely registered anymore. It had been coming for weeks, months even, and now that it was over, the only thing he felt was relief. His chest felt lighter without the constant push and pull of her expectations.

Beau opened his laptop, the glow of the screen highlighting the mess on his desk‚Äîa stack of unopened mail, an empty coffee mug, and a tangle of charging cables. His email inbox blinked to life, the usual flood of junk cluttering the screen. He was halfway through deleting messages when a subject line stopped him:

For a moment, he just stared at the screen. The salary was there, big and promising, dangling a future in front of him like a carrot. This was it‚Äîthe opportunity he‚Äôd been waiting for. The kind of job that could actually get him somewhere.

But the excitement fizzled out as reality set in.

The cost of moving to L.A. alone made his chest tighten. Deposits, rent, transportation‚Äîit all added up fast, and he didn‚Äôt have the savings to cover it. Even with the promise of a bigger paycheck, the gap between now and ‚Äúsettled‚Äù felt impossibly wide.

His gaze drifted to the corner of the room, to the stack of boxes from Stonehaven. His grandfather‚Äôs house. It was just sitting there, empty, racking up taxes and quietly bleeding him dry.

And just like that, the thought crept in, unwelcome and sharp: Sierra was right.
Beau sat back in his chair, exhaling through clenched teeth. The idea of selling the house had always felt abstract, something to deal with ‚Äúsomeday.‚Äù But now? Now it felt more like a threat. He‚Äôd have to go back‚Äîto Stonehaven, to the house, to everything he‚Äôd been avoiding since the day he left.

His mind skated dangerously close to the memories he tried to keep buried: the accident, the life he‚Äôd been running from ever since. Stonehaven wasn‚Äôt just a place; it was a weight he wasn‚Äôt sure he could carry.

He pushed the laptop away, his hands balling into fists. Selling the house would mean facing all of it‚ÄîIsla, the life they should have shared, the way everything fell apart. And to make it worse, Sierra‚Äôs voice echoed in his head, smug and unrelenting: You could sell it and finally move on with your life.

‚ÄúDamn it,‚Äù he muttered, dragging a hand over his face.

The thought sat there, persistent and irritating, like a splinter he couldn‚Äôt ignore. He hated that she was right. He hated the house. He hated the memories. But most of all, he hated the idea that Stonehaven might be the only way forward.
Beau let out a long, frustrated breath and leaned back in his chair. The email glowed faintly on the laptop screen, the promise of a new future spelled out in neat, sterile lines. It should have felt like an escape, but between here and there stood Stonehaven‚Äîand that was a road he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to take.

He glanced at the clock. Barely noon. Too early to feel this drained, yet his body felt heavy, weighed down by problems he didn‚Äôt know how to solve.

With a frustrated sigh, he shut the laptop and pushed away from the desk. The quiet of the apartment pressed in on him, suffocating and still. Giving in to the exhaustion pulling at him, he made his way to the bed, flicking off the lights and collapsing onto the mattress.

The ceiling loomed above him, sunlight streaming in through the window and cutting across the room in harsh, unwelcome beams. He groaned, turning onto his side and pulling a pillow over his head, desperate to block out the light‚Äîand the decisions he didnt want to make. Sleep, he thought. Just sleep.

Chapter 2
The road stretched ahead, endless and slick, a pale ribbon of ice glowing faintly under the cold, indifferent light of the moon. Beau‚Äôs hands clamped the steering wheel, his knuckles bone-white, the tension crawling up his arms and into his chest. The heater sputtered, blowing weak, lukewarm air, but the inside of the car felt suffocatingly cold.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always like this, Beau!‚Äù Isla‚Äôs voice cut through the thick silence, sharp and brittle, vibrating in the small space. ‚ÄúWaiting until the last second, like things will just fix themselves!‚Äù

‚ÄúJust stop!‚Äù he snapped, his voice rising, the words spilling out before he could stop them.

The air shifted instantly, heavy and brittle. His stomach twisted as he glanced at her‚Äîjust a flick of his eyes, brief but enough to see her face. Isla sat stiffly, her profile half-illuminated by the dim dashboard light. Her jaw was tight, her lips pressed into a thin line. Her hand rested on her lap, fingers curled slightly, her engagement ring catching the glow in a soft, fleeting shimmer.

Then it happened.

The tires hit ice.

The car jolted violently, a gut-wrenching lurch that sent Beau‚Äôs heart into his throat. The steering wheel jerked in his hands, twisting against him as the car began to slide.

Time fractured.

The world tilted, spinning wildly as the tires lost all grip. The grinding roar of rubber skidding on ice tore through the silence, louder than it should have been, drowning everything else out.

‚ÄúBeau!‚Äù Isla‚Äôs scream shattered through the chaos, raw and panicked, echoing in his ears as the headlights of the oncoming car grew impossibly large.

Everything blurred together‚Äîthe blinding glare of the headlights, the sickening weightlessness of the spin, the deafening screech of metal meeting metal. The impact slammed into them like a freight train, a bone-jarring crunch that reverberated through every nerve in his body.

Beau woke with a start, his breath tearing from his chest in shallow, frantic gasps. His heart slammed against his ribs, the rhythm wild and uneven, as if trying to break free. His skin was damp with sweat, the sheets twisted around him.

The room was still too bright. The sunlight poured through the window, casting sharp, unkind streaks across the walls. Beau closed his eyes, dragging in slow, measured breaths, but the memory clung to him, vivid and unrelenting.

The headlights. The ice. Isla‚Äôs voice, sharp with frustration. The sickening crunch of metal on metal.

She used to laugh so easily, he thought. He couldn‚Äôt remember the sound anymore‚Äînot the way it used to be, bright and carefree, bubbling out of her like sunlight on water. But in his dreams‚Äîhis nightmares‚Äîit was her anger, her frustration, that always rang loud and clear.

The guilt weighed heavy in his chest, an ache that never quite left. It wasn‚Äôt just that he had been driving. It was that they had been fighting, stupidly, over nothing that mattered now. It was that he hadn‚Äôt seen the ice in time. It was that he had walked away from the wreck when she hadn‚Äôt.

How many times had he replayed the moment in his mind? Wondering if it could‚Äôve gone differently, if there had been a single choice, a single second that might have changed everything? The thought haunted him, circling endlessly.

He pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes, willing the images to fade. It didn‚Äôt work. It never worked.

Beau swung his legs over the side of the bed, his feet hitting the floor with a dull thud. His hands trembled slightly as he pushed himself up and made his way to the kitchen. The hum of the fridge was the only sound in the too-quiet apartment. He grabbed a bottle of water, the cool condensation slick against his palm, and leaned heavily against the counter.

The same dream. The same memories. It always came back to that night.

The bottle felt cold in his hands, grounding him, but it wasn‚Äôt enough to shake the weight pressing down on him. His eyes drifted to the window, the city outside alive with movement‚Äîcars honking in the distance, muffled voices rising from the street below. It felt so far away, like it belonged to a world he didn‚Äôt quite live in anymore.

Turning away, Beau walked back to the small desk in the corner of the living room. His laptop was still open, the screen glowing faintly. He tapped the trackpad to wake it, the email staring back at him.

We‚Äôre excited to offer you the position‚Ä¶

The words blurred as he read them again. It was a chance‚Äîa fresh start, far away from the memories that clung to him no matter how hard he tried to shake them. But getting to L.A. was another story. The money in his bank account wouldn‚Äôt cover half of what he needed to relocate.

Sierra‚Äôs voice pushed its way back into his thoughts, insistent and nagging. ‚ÄúYou should sell it, Beau. That house is just sitting there. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre ever going to use it.‚Äù

She wasn‚Äôt wrong, and that was what stung the most. Selling the house made sense. It was the quickest way to get the money he needed, to make the move, to take the job. But it wasn‚Äôt the house he dreaded‚Äîit was the memories waiting for him in Stonehaven. The place they had first met as teenagers. The place they had been together for the last time.

He thought of those two summers in Stonehaven, stuck at his grandfather‚Äôs house because his mom had been worried about him. She thought small-town life might straighten him out, keep him out of trouble long enough to make it to graduation. He had been so angry back then‚Äîangry at her, angry at the world, angry at being sent to that nowhere town where he didn‚Äôt know anyone and didn‚Äôt care to.

Except for Isla.

She had been the one bright spot in those long, tedious summers. The daughter of the nurse who came by a couple of times a week to check on his grandfather, Isla had shown up one day with her quick smile and curious eyes, asking him questions he hadn‚Äôt wanted to answer. But somehow, she‚Äôd gotten under his skin. Slowly, they‚Äôd gone from awkward small talk to spending entire days together. By the end of that first summer, they were inseparable.

They‚Äôd fallen hard, the kind of love that felt bigger than the both of them, like it could defy the world. When it came time to choose colleges, they had picked the same one in Chicago without hesitation. It hadn‚Äôt been easy‚Äînew city, new pressures‚Äîbut they‚Äôd had each other.

And then winter break came. They‚Äôd gone back to Stonehaven to visit her family. He could still see her smile when they‚Äôd pulled into town, the way her eyes lit up excited to show her family her engagement ring.

But the memory always stopped there, hitting a wall he couldn‚Äôt get past without everything unraveling. The accident had erased all the good that came before it, leaving only fragments of what they had been. 

That town held pieces of his life that felt frozen in time, untouched by everything that had happened since. 

Still, he didn‚Äôt have a choice. The house wasn‚Äôt doing him any good sitting there, empty and rotting. It was just another piece of the past he couldn‚Äôt afford to hold onto.

His eyes dropped back to the email, the job offer staring back at him like a lifeline. If he sold the house, he could move forward. He could finally take the next step, leave everything that happened behind him, and focus on something‚Äîanything‚Äîthat wasn‚Äôt tied to that night.

He pulled up a browser and typed: bus ticket to Stonehaven, Vermont.

The results loaded quickly, but he didn‚Äôt move for a moment, his hand hovering over the mouse. Selling the house was logical. Practical. It was just a house. But as he clicked to finalize the ticket, a knot of dread settled in his stomach.

It wasn‚Äôt the house he feared. It wasn‚Äôt even Stonehaven. It was himself‚Äîthe memories he couldn‚Äôt escape and the guilt that followed him, relentless and unyielding.

He exhaled slowly, closing the laptop. This was the only way forward. He‚Äôd sell the house, take the job, and leave it all behind. One last trip to Stonehaven, and he‚Äôd finally be free.",1,1737861378.0,DestructiveReaders,1,1.0,False

‚ùóÔ∏èLong and grafic post alert‚ùóÔ∏è so grab a drink and hold onto something as I will take you on a journey. 
I work in a restaurant as an assistant manager, however in a Winter I pretty much am a well paid waitress due to the business levels. Few days ago, we (another waitress and I) had 5 or 6 tables in at that time during lunch. Restaurant is quite big and has a long corridor down to the bathrooms and the office which is next to it (this info will be needed for later).  
As I was making my way to the office in the middle of the lunch I notice something on the floor and think to myself : ""oh, that leaf looks exactly like üí©"" as I kick it, I REALISE ITS NOT THE LEAF AT ALL!!!! At this same moment the man passes me with his head down, but I was sooo ü§Øü§Ø into that moment trying to understand where the üí© came from that I do not pay any attention to him. I started to walk towards the office to find the bin bag and I saw that this was indeed a brown, chunky trail leading to the men's toilet. 
I am literally scared to open the door so ask the chef who just came in for his shift to open the door and investigate. The poor man opened the door and puked instantly. 
Straight away we thought that we need to sort this situation as fast as we can so nobody else see what's happening. We placed the notice to use the other bathrooms straight away and started to clean all of the mess firstly from the corridor so nobody else walks into it. 
The man in question went back to his table, ordered a coffee and a dessert while we were sweating, gagging and almost dying from the whole experience. The man wore shoes with white soles, which at this point were brown. I won't write about the state of the toilet. Until now, I cannot understand where and when he üí© himself, was it on the way to the toilet or out of it ... Truly insane... He didn't told us anything, just left 15% tip, which is considered a very generous in UK. 
Yesterday, we received a review form completed with 4* and he also gave marks on individual questions, so his rating was : 4* food, 3* service and 2* ambience. The name seemed familiar, I messaged my gm as I wasn't at work at the time to ask what table this person sat on, as the name clicked for some reason. And hold and behold, that indeed was the same man!! THE AUDACITY!!! Well, I can understand that ambience was shitty after covering the third of the building in your feces ... üòµü§Æ
I am so done with hospitality, please send some love and light my way! üò≠",1,1737861334.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,0.99,False

The cafe‚Äôs bell jingled as Beau pushed open the door, a wave of warm air brushing over him. He spotted Sierra immediately‚Äîpolished and poised as ever, sitting in her usual seat by the window. Her sleek black hair gleamed under the soft light, and her phone rested beside a half-empty latte. She looked like she always did: flawless, as if she belonged on the cover of a magazine.

For a moment, Beau paused, his hand lingering on the door frame. The sight of Sierra, perfectly composed and scrolling through her phone, sent a flicker of unease through him. It wasn‚Äôt anything specific, just a quiet, nagging tension that had become all too familiar. He shifted the strap of his bag on his shoulder, forcing himself forward.

She glanced up and smiled, her teeth bright against her lipstick. ‚ÄúMorning, handsome!‚Äù

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù he replied, sliding into the seat across from her.

‚ÄúI went ahead and ordered for you. Same as always.‚Äù She gestured toward the counter, where a barista was placing a cup on a tray.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù he said. He appreciated the gesture‚Äîor at least, he wanted to. Instead, it felt like one more reminder of how Sierra always seemed to know what he needed better than he did.

She tucked her phone into her bag and leaned forward slightly, resting her elbows on the table. Her eyes sparkled with purpose, and Beau braced himself.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she started, her voice bright but laced with intent, ‚ÄúI talked to my father last night.‚Äù

His stomach tightened. That tone meant trouble. ‚ÄúOh?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe knows someone at Bluewater Insurance. They‚Äôre hiring, and he thinks you‚Äôd be a great fit. He said if you send over your resume, he‚Äôll make sure it gets into the right hands.‚Äù

Beau frowned, his jaw tightening. ‚ÄúInsurance?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs stable,‚Äù she said, as though that settled the matter. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not exactly glamorous, but it‚Äôs steady, and the pay‚Äôs decent. You could finally move out of that tiny apartment and get something closer to me.‚Äù

Of course, that was the real point. Beau forced a polite smile, but his stomach churned. He couldn‚Äôt think of anything worse than sitting at a desk in some beige office building, selling policies he didn‚Äôt care about. But it wasn‚Äôt just the job‚Äîit was the thought of living closer to Sierra, of letting their lives intertwine in the way she so clearly wanted. The weight on his chest grew heavier.

‚ÄúI like my apartment,‚Äù he said finally, though even to his own ears, it sounded like an excuse.

‚ÄúBeau,‚Äù Sierra said, her voice softening in the way it always did when she was about to press harder, ‚Äúyou know it‚Äôs not enough. You‚Äôre wasting so much potential. And honestly, you‚Äôve got that old house you inherited just sitting there, doing nothing. If you sold it, you‚Äôd have enough to get a decent place near me.‚Äù

Of course. The house. She always found a way to bring it up, like a splinter she couldn‚Äôt stop picking at. Beau exhaled sharply through his nose, the irritation resurfacing in his chest.

His gaze dropped to the swirling coffee in his mug. The house in Stonehaven was a knot he couldn‚Äôt untangle, a mix of guilt, grief, and memories he wasn‚Äôt ready to face. Every time someone brought it up, it felt like a trap.

‚ÄúSierra‚Ä¶‚Äù His voice was low, a warning.

But she pressed on. ‚ÄúBe honest,‚Äù she said, leaning forward slightly. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of holding onto it? It‚Äôs been sitting there for two years. No one‚Äôs touched it. It‚Äôs just costing you money in taxes and upkeep. You could sell it and finally move on with your life.‚Äù

Move on. The words stung in a way he couldn‚Äôt explain. He hadn‚Äôt been back to Stonehaven since before his grandfather‚Äôs passing, and he knew that  he never wanted. The house wasn‚Äôt just some old property to him‚Äîit was tied to those last two summers spent before college, to Isla, to the life he‚Äôd lost in one horrible moment. But explaining that to Sierra felt impossible. She wouldn‚Äôt understand.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that simple,‚Äù Beau said, his tone sharper than he intended.

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù Sierra pressed, her eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs some family home you grew up in. You‚Äôve barely even been there, right? What‚Äôs holding you back?‚Äù

What wasn‚Äôt holding him back? Beau swallowed hard, trying to push down the wave of frustration rising in his chest. He could feel her words closing in around him, like a net tightening with every question she asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll deal with it when I‚Äôm ready,‚Äù he said finally, though even he wasn‚Äôt sure what that meant.

Sierra sighed, leaning back and crossing her arms. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been saying that since I met you, Beau. And let‚Äôs be real‚Äîyou‚Äôre never going to be ready. At some point, you have to stop running and actually deal with your life.‚Äù

Her words cut deep, sharper than he expected. Running. She wasn‚Äôt wrong, but hearing it out loud made him feel like the floor beneath him had given way.

Beau stared at his mug, the swirl of coffee chaotic and relentless, like his own thoughts. She didn‚Äôt get it. She never had. Every conversation with her felt like a slow push toward a future he didn‚Äôt want‚Äîa life filled with shared calendars, compromises, and expectations he couldn‚Äôt meet. The truth settled heavily in his chest: he didn‚Äôt want the life she was trying to build with him.

Hell, he didn‚Äôt want to share a life with anyone. He could barely manage his own without someone trying to wedge their way into every corner of it. The thought snapped into place with startling clarity, sharp and unforgiving.

‚ÄúI think we both know this isn‚Äôt working,‚Äù he said, his voice quiet but resolute.

Sierra blinked, caught off guard. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this anymore,‚Äù Beau said, finally meeting her gaze. ‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ us‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs too much. I feel like I‚Äôm suffocating.‚Äù

Her expression hardened, her hands gripping the edges of the table. ‚ÄúUnbelievable,‚Äù she said, her voice icy. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre blaming me for this? For trying to help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not blaming anyone,‚Äù Beau said, standing. ‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt keep pretending like this is what I want.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she said sharply, her voice rising. ‚ÄúGo ahead. Run away. That‚Äôs what you do, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

Beau pulled a few bills from his wallet and set them on the table. He paused, looking at her one last time, but the words he wanted to say wouldn‚Äôt come. Instead, he turned and walked toward the door.

As he stepped outside, the cold air hit him like a slap, sharp and biting against his skin. He drew in a deep breath, his lungs burning, but for the first time in months, the weight in his chest began to ease.
The door clicked shut behind him, and Beau let out a slow breath, shrugging off his coat and tossing it onto the back of a chair. The quiet of his apartment wasn‚Äôt comforting, exactly, but it felt steady‚Äîunchanging. He kicked off his shoes, leaving them where they landed, and sank into the chair at his desk.

The breakup with Sierra barely registered anymore. It had been coming for weeks, months even, and now that it was over, the only thing he felt was relief. His chest felt lighter without the constant push and pull of her expectations.

Beau opened his laptop, the glow of the screen highlighting the mess on his desk‚Äîa stack of unopened mail, an empty coffee mug, and a tangle of charging cables. His email inbox blinked to life, the usual flood of junk cluttering the screen. He was halfway through deleting messages when a subject line stopped him:

Sierra‚Äôs voice pushed its way back into his thoughts, insistent and nagging. ‚ÄúYou should sell it, Beau. That house is just sitting there. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre ever going to use it.‚Äù

She wasn‚Äôt wrong, and that was what stung the most. Selling the house made sense. It was the quickest way to get the money he needed, to make the move, to take the job. But it wasn‚Äôt the house he dreaded‚Äîit was the memories waiting for him in Stonehaven. The place they had first met as teenagers. The place they had been together for the last time.

He thought of those two summers in Stonehaven, stuck at his grandfather‚Äôs house because his mom had been worried about him. She thought small-town life might straighten him out, keep him out of trouble long enough to make it to graduation. He had been so angry back then‚Äîangry at her, angry at the world, angry at being sent to that nowhere town where he didn‚Äôt know anyone and didn‚Äôt care to.

Except for Isla.

She had been the one bright spot in those long, tedious summers. The daughter of the nurse who came by a couple of times a week to check on his grandfather, Isla had shown up one day with her quick smile and curious eyes, asking him questions he hadn‚Äôt wanted to answer. But somehow, she‚Äôd gotten under his skin. Slowly, they‚Äôd gone from awkward small talk to spending entire days together. By the end of that first summer, they were inseparable.

They‚Äôd fallen hard, the kind of love that felt bigger than the both of them, like it could defy the world. When it came time to choose colleges, they had picked the same one in Chicago without hesitation. It hadn‚Äôt been easy‚Äînew city, new pressures‚Äîbut they‚Äôd had each other.

And then winter break came. They‚Äôd gone back to Stonehaven to visit her family. He could still see her smile when they‚Äôd pulled into town, the way her eyes lit up excited to show her family her engagement ring.

But the memory always stopped there, hitting a wall he couldn‚Äôt get past without everything unraveling. The accident had erased all the good that came before it, leaving only fragments of what they had been. 

That town held pieces of his life that felt frozen in time, untouched by everything that had happened since. 

Still, he didn‚Äôt have a choice. The house wasn‚Äôt doing him any good sitting there, empty and rotting. It was just another piece of the past he couldn‚Äôt afford to hold onto.

His eyes dropped back to the email, the job offer staring back at him like a lifeline. If he sold the house, he could move forward. He could finally take the next step, leave everything that happened behind him, and focus on something‚Äîanything‚Äîthat wasn‚Äôt tied to that night.

He pulled up a browser and typed: bus ticket to Stonehaven, Vermont.

The results loaded quickly, but he didn‚Äôt move for a moment, his hand hovering over the mouse. Selling the house was logical. Practical. It was just a house. But as he clicked to finalize the ticket, a knot of dread settled in his stomach.

It wasn‚Äôt the house he feared. It wasn‚Äôt even Stonehaven. It was himself‚Äîthe memories he couldn‚Äôt escape and the guilt that followed him, relentless and unyielding.

He exhaled slowly, closing the laptop. This was the only way forward. He‚Äôd sell the house, take the job, and leave it all behind. One last trip to Stonehaven, and he‚Äôd finally be free.",1,1737861273.0,writers,4,1.0,False

1ia4kdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ia4kdp/is_this_typical/,Is this typical?,"Venting/Thoughts?
 
It has been basically impossible to talk/communicate with my wife of 14 years. There are a few challenges that have become so pronounced it‚Äôs an active impediment to making decisions/resolving things. I am not, nor do not think I am perfect by any means, but I am at my wits end. If not for our kids I would have left awhile ago. I can‚Äôt tell if she has some mental / personality disorder, is just apathetic towards the relationship etc.

The following is the type of crap that happens in almost every discussion.
 
She says something about whatever subject/topic, etc.  I respond and ask a question. She may answer. I may have to repeat the question as she appears to either not be paying attention or doesn‚Äôt want to talk about whatever I asked. Even if related to what she said.
 
She will then respond in some way. Her responses often make no contextual sense and are very frequently not actual answers to what I am asking, they might be sort of related to the topic but not always.  She often answers without thinking about it.  Often her answers will directly contradict what she has already said or just make no sense. I will often ask her clarifying questions. This goes nowhere. Its like she is just throwing a bunch of stuff out there and hoping something sticks, while at the same time not taking ownership of anything she says. So even if I could demonstrate to her that what she just said doesn‚Äôt make sense, she doesn‚Äôt care to acknowledge it she just moves to a new reason. If I point this out she just digs in and defends whatever she said. She also does one or more of the following. Says other stuff that doesn‚Äôt make sense, changes the sequence of events and the flow of the conversation (gaslighting), trys to put things back on me/deflect, etc. She also continually puts forth this circular reasoning and so on.
 
Sometimes she falls back on an emotional argument such as well I don‚Äôt know if  what you said meant this or that, but I felt this way in response to that so that‚Äôs what it means. She thinks I should agree with her and that it should be obvious to me. I am not talking about emotionally charged issues or anything. I am talking about responses and definitions of specific words. For example, well I know you said coffee but I was feeling like a glass of water so when I said yes to your offer of coffee and you used that word, my unvocalized feeling about water should have been obvious and you shouldn‚Äôt be confused that saying yes I wanted coffee actually meant something else.
 
She also seems incapable of answering a direct question, no matter how specific it is or even if caveat away that I just need to know this, etc. She will just apparently assume that I meant something other than I was asking. Provide some info or indirectly talk around it, but won‚Äôt answer. I will point out this is happening and she will keep doing it but often claim she has answered my question. So if I said do you want to do this today, she will be like well we could do that and then add some information like but are we going to do this later. Fine maybe she is feeling me out or assessing, etc. except it doesn‚Äôt stop. It will turn into some passive aggressive journey to not be able to answer do you want to do that. I will even try to help her decide or reason out the question, nope doesn‚Äôt matter.
 
The absolute worst thing however is her use of I don‚Äôt know. She is addicted to this response. I don‚Äôt know.  I take it to mean, I don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt care if what I said made no sense and your trying to clarify what I said to try and understand me. I don‚Äôt want to talk about this thing or it would take effort ‚Äì ‚Äú I don‚Äôt know‚Äù. If I ask I would really like to try and figure something out ‚Äì nope. Well if you don‚Äôt know then can you think about it and get back to me? She will say so and then crickets, never happens. If I bring it up again just restarts the cycle.  This is for almost anything
 
When I bring attention to these challenges and many more, she just deflects and avoids.
 
We tried couples counseling years ago and I think it might have helped her in the sense that she felt like we needed to do it so because we did it we somehow accomplished something- despite the big issues we went to couples counseling for are still huge issues. She literally forgot the main issue we discussed in counseling and the purported solution we worked on together to resolve it. She didn‚Äôt even seem bothered when I asked her about forgetting it.
 
I started seeing a therapist about a year ago due to  a few things that were causing extreme anxiety (her being one of them). After a few months the majority of the sessions were being dominated by challenges with navigating my wife‚Äôs behavior. Describing this behavior to my therapist she has repeatedly asked if my wife could be on the spectrum due to her extreme rigidity/circular reasoning on even the most benign topics.
 
My wife is a self described people pleaser and passive aggressive person. She is incredibly likeable to most people. Over the years I have also come to the conclusion she has almost no individual beliefs. Almost all her beliefs seem to be predicated on social norms/friend groups. Like her sense of ethics is well let‚Äôs see how others react to what‚Äôs happening before I take a position. 
 
Despite what I am describing she doesn‚Äôt exhibit traits of an overt narcissist.  She was raised in a household where direct communication about any potential problems was not a thing. She seems to have a some sort of anxious attachment style. I think she might have some form of ADHD. I am very familiar with ADHD and see plenty of indicators. She was scheduled to meet with a specialist for a comprehensive evaluation, but saw her GP for an unrelated issue before the scheduled appointment and mentioned the ADHD concerns. The GP provided the most basic few minute survey and because that indicated ADHD was not likely my wife decided she didn‚Äôt have it and never saw a specialist.
 
She is also a very smart person who is a corporate exec and is exposed to complex social/professional situations on a regular basis. Except she apparently is confused when I ask her things. She doesn‚Äôt seem to exhibit the same behaviors I experience with others and I can‚Äôt tell for sure if the issues I experience are just specific due to the uniqueness of our relationship and the fact she is not going to be in position with others where this behavior is going to come out or something else is going on.
 
Does she just have massive resentment of me, guilt, medical issues, BPD, covert narcissit, I am totally off base, etc. I care for her and want to figure this out, but I am getting to the point I don‚Äôt want to engage her anymore and have contempt for her. I have tried so many things.

it was amazing. he treated me really sweet and didn‚Äôt grab me without asking or anything. we got eventually got takeout cause we needed to eat after taking turns playing games for a while,  and he let me set the table by myself while he talked.

afterwards we hung out in my room, and watched netflix stoned. he‚Äòs maybe an inch shorter than me but he felt *huge* with his arm around me. i mean i shouldn‚Äôt undersell him he is huge. he said he‚Äôs been lifting for like 5 years, so it felt like i couldn‚Äôt put too much weight on him even if I wanted too.

so, to address what many of you are likely wondering. yes he is gorgeous, and he did, mindblowingly, plow my guts and get me pregnant. it was great and fulfilled my endorphin needs for like the month, but that isn‚Äôt even the highlight of the sex. it took a second to pick up because his dick was really hurting me, so i asked him to be gentle with me. and guess what guys. he WAS he was he was he was. 

afterwards we went to go pee and he could tell i was like flinching and scared so i apologized and he was like ‚Äûwhy??? you felt good.‚Äú so i asked him straight up ‚Äûaren‚Äôt you really disgusted and angry at me right now?‚Äú and he was so sweet about it.

he was like ‚Äûlisten, you‚Äôre probably used to dudes freaking out and having some kind of transphobic fit after they do this for the first time, but i‚Äòm chilling. dont freak out you‚Äòre fine.‚Äú

it honestly made me cry, which was awkward and i think kind of put him off cause i literally actively had his cum dripping down my legs. but i kind of looked away and tried to be cool about it and he didn‚Äôt say anything, so, i think i‚Äòm in the clear. he even told me he was staying for a few more hours and said that he ‚Äûdidn‚Äôt just pretend to wanna play video games so he could fuck‚Äú me which made me feel so, idk, like a person.

we played the souls trilogy and binding of isaac, i was better ü§≠

i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äòll ever see him again. i don‚Äôt think either of us can do something serious but it would be really nice to see him every once and a while. he‚Äòs a musician and was so so interesting to talk to, he even loves kids.

idk, anyway date update complete. he‚Äòs good at video games and i like him and his blue eyes. aaaaand he says he‚Äôs only been with cis women :) ",6,1737861173.0,4tran4,12,0.8,False

1ia4clx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonomicon/comments/1ia4clx/23_is_for_23_illusion/,23 is for 23 Illusion,"# 23 Illusion

AKA the 23 Enigma, the 23 Illusion is the belief that the number 23 holds a unique, mystical significance, appearing with uncanny frequency in coincidences or meaningful patterns. From ancient lore to modern conspiracy theories, the number‚Äôs allure transcends cultures and eras. Julius Caesar‚Äôs 23 stab wounds, the 23 enigma in *The Illuminatus! Trilogy*, and the 23 chromosomes in human DNA all fuel the idea that this number is more than mere arithmetic. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether the number appears as a date, a calculation, or sheer happenstance‚Äîonce you start seeing it, you can‚Äôt stop.

This phenomenon thrives on apophenia, our brain‚Äôs tendency to find patterns in randomness, and confirmation bias, which ensures we only notice evidence that supports our belief. If you‚Äôre looking for 23s, they will find you. Whether through numerology, occult fascination, or even mathematical oddities (2 divided by 3 equals .666, the ‚Äúnumber of the beast‚Äù), the illusion feeds on our craving for order in chaos. Every coincidence becomes a revelation, and every revelation builds the myth.

Culturally, the 23 Illusion has become a cornerstone of conspiracy theories. From the Freemasons to the New World Order, theorists insist the number is a secret code pointing to hidden truths. Robert Anton Wilson popularized the 23 enigma, drawing connections between the number and events ranging from the Bible to world politics. Jim Carrey's *The Number 23* only deepen the mystique, wrapping the illusion in narratives of obsession and fate.

But the 23 Illusion is more than a conspiracy‚Äîit‚Äôs a mirror for human cognition. We see it because we want to, because chaos terrifies us, and because meaning is more comforting than randomness. It‚Äôs an artifact of the same cognitive toolkit that gave us astrology, prophecy, and the faces we see in clouds.

Ultimately, the 23 Illusion is less about the number itself and more about how we see the world and how it functions as a symbol. It‚Äôs proof that, when given the choice between the coincidental and the meaningful, we will always pick meaning‚Äîeven if we have to invent it.

# Confirmation Bias

The little voice in your head that says, ‚ÄúIgnore that‚Äîit disagrees with me.‚Äù It keeps you believing you‚Äôre right, no matter what. It‚Äôs your brain‚Äôs yes-man, sorting the world into truths that fit your story and lies that don‚Äôt. Evidence you like gets a spotlight. Everything else gets thrown out. In the digital age, confirmation bias thrives. Algorithms feed you what you want, echoing your beliefs back to you. Every ‚Äúlike‚Äù and ‚Äúshare‚Äù builds a tighter bubble, shutting out anything that challenges your view. It‚Äôs the reason for polarized debates, why compromise feels impossible, and why everyone else seems so wrong.

But it‚Äôs not just politics or big ideas. It‚Äôs in the little things too. Your team never cheats, but the other one always does. Your heroes can do no wrong, while theirs are villains. It‚Äôs why your coffee, your movies, your music‚Äîall of it‚Äîis better than theirs. At its heart, confirmation bias protects you. It shields you from the discomfort of being wrong. But that comfort costs you the truth. It keeps you safe and ignorant, trading understanding for peace of mind. The next time you‚Äôre nodding along too quickly, stop. Ask yourself: ‚ÄúDo I believe this because it‚Äôs true? Or because I want it to be?‚Äù

# Sense-making

Sense-making is the art of turning chaos into order. It‚Äôs not done alone but with others. People piece together fragments of reality to build stories that seem solid enough to act on. It‚Äôs not about finding truth but about crafting something that works when everything feels uncertain. At its best, sense-making connects people and helps them adapt to change. At its worst, it warps reality, spreading biases and falsehoods. Groups reinforce each other‚Äôs errors, seeing patterns where none exist. Stories that seem plausible harden into rigid beliefs. This can lead to unity or to dangerous delusions, depending on whether the story is grounded in thought or in folly. Sense-making isn‚Äôt about fixing chaos. It‚Äôs about surviving it together. It thrives on flexibility but shatters under dogma. Whether it brings clarity or confusion depends on how willing we are to question the stories we tell and rewrite them when needed.

See also: *Narrative Fallacy, Groupthink, Apophenia, Confirmation Bias, Hallowed Doubt, Adaptive Ignorance*

# Narrative Fallacy

The narrative fallacy is our need to turn life into stories. We take random or chaotic events and give them coherence. Heroes, villains, and morals emerge. But these stories are often wrong. In making them neat, we ignore the mess, skip the doubts, and miss the truth. Our brains crave stories. They help us remember and find meaning. But to make the story fit, we cherry-pick facts, overlook contradictions, and force connections. It feels good, but it lies. We want clear beginnings, middles, and ends, even when reality is a tangle of loose threads.

This fallacy is most dangerous when stakes are high. In business, it confuses luck with skill. In politics, it spreads propaganda and shrinks complex issues into slogans. In life, it makes us see fate where there‚Äôs only chance. The narrative fallacy leads us to see events as stories, with logical chains of cause and effect.¬† Escaping these chains means facing the unknown. Some stories are better left untold.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
- Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
- The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
- Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.\
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.\
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.\
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.\
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.\
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.\
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.\
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.\
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
- Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
- It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
- Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes \
- Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
- Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
- Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
- Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.\
- Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.\
Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.\
- Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.\
Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\

A bit of back story: I've recently moved back home and had to leave behind my espresso machine and all my espresso accoutrements üòî I have my dad's Bialetti Express, though, which is faithfully keeping my coffee-spirits up. I'm an espresso kind of guy, and although I've many a time enjoyed a moka pot, you can understand if I'm trying to dial in the moka to get as close to an espresso-ish coffee as I can. My main issue is that locally I'm not able to get freshly roasted (and correctly roasted) coffee, so I'm thinking I might start roasting it myself. To that end, I just bought the KinGrinder P2 after reading many reviews, and considering it to be the best option I had available in my budget. 

I've been researching a lot, almost as much as I did for many years to get my perfect espresso... And my setup is currently the 1-cup BE moka pot (my dad also has a 2-cup Brikka, but I've always felt the Brikka burns the coffee and all you get for it is a a bit of quickly-disappearing foam, ie not crema). I'm adding a coffee filter on top of the basket. I'm using 5-7gr fo coffee (I need to do a lot of trial-and-error here, as I think the roast level that's printed on some of the bags I'm getting is just arbitrarily decided on...). I've been WDT-ing and either slightly pressing down on the grounds with the back of the spoon, very lightly, or just leaving it as one traditionally does with a moka. I've been adding pre-boiled water to the pot. And on the lowest flame I can get it goes, and when the coffee reaches its half-way point I take it off and try and stop the brew (by putting the base of the pot in room-temp water) just before it starts to gurgle out. I'm getting nice coffee extractions; some nicer than others, but mostly with a decent body. And I think I've got it to where I can avoid a sour-tasting moka. What I'm missing, however, is a bit of complexity in the taste. I know one can't ever get crema from a moka, but sometimes I've seen at least a head of nice tan foam. I think I'm not getting this due to the coffee (it's freshness, overall quality, the kind of roast...), but I'd like to know how much the grind setting might be affecting.",2,1737859766.0,mokapot,1,1.0,False

1ia405t,https://www.reddit.com/r/krusie_gang/comments/1ia405t/im_humanchapter_3/,I'm Human-Chapter 3,"From The Diary Of December Holiday-Date Unknown

""Deer Diary-pun intended-

Day 3 of Kris staying over with us.  The kid's been eating very little and communication has been very little to none.  I hate seeing them like this.  They refuse to take calls from their family, even Azzy.  All they do is spend all their time in my room looking up at the ceiling or sleeping when they don't burst out into tears every few hours.  I guess finding out your life's been one giant lie will do that to you.  One day, you're an adolescent goat monster waiting for your horns to grow in and the next you're a human adopted by monster parents because your human family was too freaked out by your existence.  Now the Dreemurrs are coming over to talk with Kris in one big group family intervention.  The kid's only 12...it's not like they're doing drugs.  Kris needs our love and support right now, not a talking down to.  The hard part has been getting them to listen.  The only thing I got on my side is they apparently still like me despite being part of the big bad group that lied to them.  Guess we just gotta get this over with...I really REALLY hate today.

Deliberately Yours,

Dess""

Dess slammed her pencil down and shut her diary, tucking it into her pillow. Turning her head, seeing a rather downtrodden Kris sitting on the ground, playing with the carpet.  Dess got up, walking over to the kid and offering her hand out to them.

""Hey, it's time.  Anytime you wanna go back upstairs, I'll step in all right?"" Dess whispered.

Kris nodded, looking up at the young doe taking her hand as she pulled them up off the carpet.

""There we go."" Dess smiled, dusting off the kid's shirt. ""You sure you don't wanna change? We got plenty of clothes in your size.""

The kid shook their head, their eyes beginning to leak again.

""H-Hey...""Dess dropped to her knees. ""We don't have to do this.  I'll tell Mom and the others you're just not ready.""

""N-No...I'll...do it."" Kris spoke, their voice cracked while trying to not cry.""\*sniff\*""

""Oh Krismas."" Dess ran a finger over the bottom of Kris' left bottom eyelid wiping a tear away. ""This just isn't you.  I hope we get that firebrand back.  At least when you were tormenting Noelle, you were happy.  Now...now, I just...""

Dess felt the human embrace her, the doe wrapping her arms around them and placing her head atop their own.  Kris didn't want to leave the embrace but reality was going to settle one way or another.

Downstairs, Rudy heard a knock at the door in the kitchen as he was drinking his morning coffee.  Rudy sighed...it was time.  The father of two and maybe now three(we'll see he thought) hurried over to the door, opening it to greet Asgore, Toriel and Asriel.

""Howdy!"" Asgore greeted Rudy who met his old college pal with a warm embrace while Azzy waved hi in the background.  Toriel nodded to Carol as she too came to the door.

""Nice to have you over though I wish it were under...better circumstances."" Carol admitted, rubbing the back of her head. ""Your child has been rather...uneventful since their arrival into our home three days ago.""

""Not one prank?"" Toriel grew concerned.

""None.  The child has kept to themselves in December's room."" Carol explained.

""oh.""Toriel sat down on the living room sofa, Rudy taking her coat and purse to the closet.

""I put out some hot cocoa and cookies on the table."" Rudy mentioned to Asriel, who gladly took Rudy up on the offer if only to distract himself from the subject at hand.

The gathering quickly sat down on two sofas situated on opposite sides...Toriel, Asgore and Azzy on side while Rudy, December and Kris would be on the other, Carol sitting in a single chair as she was mayor after all and would run the so-called ""intervention"".

""Do we really need to do this? This entire thing just reeks."" Asriel took a bite of cookie.

""Asriel, shush."" Toriel slapped his knee. ""The last thing we need is more of your commentary.""

""Oh, I'm sorry to bring up yet another BAD idea thought up by the combined forces of the Dreemurr and Holiday clans that yet AGAIN makes my little sibling FEEL worse than they already do!"" Asriel stood up. ""Forgive ME for...""

""Azzy?"" Kris stood at the bottom of the stairs, their hand in December's.

Asriel stopped, sitting down and feeling embarassed in the moment realizing how foolish he looked in front of Kris.

""It's nothing, Kris."" Azzy sweat, smiling at them. ""Don't worry, you've done nothing wrong.""

""Come on."" Dess encouraged them, walking along with her rather tepidly.

""Where's your little one, Noelle?"" Asgore inquired, trying to lighten the mood.

""At a neighbor's house.  She didn't need to be exposed to this."" Carol looking to Kris in concern.

Kris, Dess and Rudy sat down at their respective sofa, Rudy offering Kris a cookie which they gladly took as they were hungry and couldn't hold out anymore.  December smiled seeing them scarf it down.  It was the first time they got so much as a hint of enjoyment out of the human in days.  However, as brief as that moment was, Kris refused to look at their family.

""Little one, won't you come over and...""Tori began to offer.

Kris shook their head, clinging to Dess.  Dess frowned, wrapping her arm around Kris then looking over at Toriel shaking her head that Kris wasn't ready.

""Kris...I brought your family over today because they just want to help you understand."" Carol began to explain.

""H-Help?"" Kris wiped tears away with a spare arm, upon hearing the words. ""HELP?""

Kris sat up, looking squarely at their family with a fire and rage in their eyes they hadn't seen for quite awhile.  Their eyes glew a ruby red, only doing so when Kris was getting rather emotional.  It was the very reason that their human family got rid of them and it was putting all the Dreemurrs in a tense mood, to say the least.

""ALL YOU'VE DONE IS HELP ME CRY!!"" Kris stamped their feet, grappling their fists together. ""WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO ME...WHY...damn you, why?!""

Kris fell to the floor, crying in an uncontrollable heap.  Dess picked them up, trying to get them come down to earth but it was worse than ever.  Seeing their family again just reignited the hate and dread they felt 72 hours ago.

""It's true."" Asgore stood up. ""Everyone in this room, including the town, has lied to you.  We wanted you to feel welcome and all we've done is jeopardize that.  We never wanted to hurt you, Kris.  The reason we brought you into our family is because Toriel wanted to make you one of us when no one else would have you.""

Kris looked back from the safety of the doe's arms holding them, narrowing their eyes.

""So---I'm just some charity case, then? No one wants the creepy kid so you take me out of pity?"" Kris spat.

""NO."" Toriel stood up, tears running down her face. ""My child, it was anything but pity! It was RAGE at the disgusting family that wouldn't give you the life you deserved!  If I had the courage to do so, I would've driven the family mini-van down to the city and lectured them on the basics of raising a child because they apparently never learned!  My child, if I lied to you if was only to give what you needed...a childhood, friends, a loving family, a roof over your head...have we not given that to you?""

""I know I haven't been the best big brother I could be, Kris...""Azzy joined in.""...but I always looked out for you.  I always gave you the better controller even though that off brand one SUCKED to play Super Smashing Fighters.""

""Dude, you know you always sucked at that game."" Dess reminded him, sticking a tongue out.

""Hardy har."" Azzy stuck his tongue out back at her.

""(It's true though.)"" Kris whispered.

""Ha, facts!"" Dess laughed as Kris agreed with her.

""Oh come on Kris..."" Azzy sat down, feeling more embarrassed then he already was.

""My point is Kris...we still love you and want you to come home.  Let us make it up to you, please?"" Azzy asked point blank, trying to hook that hint of positivity that came out of Kris.

""Tori's made your favorite pie many times over in the last few days."" Asgore explained. ""We just want to see your smile again!""

""Yeah, you can't be the creepy kid next door getting into my Christmas lights if you aren't next door!"" Rudy raised his mug, taking a sip of the cocoa he prepared.

""So, my child....please, won't you give us a second chance?"" Toriel stood up again, holding her arms out to the child, December gently placing Kris down on two legs so that they could face her.

Kris looked at their ""family"".  ""It's just you. YOU, Kris the human.""  Kris, if they had their red horned headband, would've thrown it on the floor again just to drive the point home.  Seeing their pleas, one part of Kris wanted to run up and hug them, forgetting any of this happened.  But unfortunately for Kris, the Holiday Manor had plenty of inconvenient reflective surfaces called mirrors reminding Kris what they were and could never be.  Dess looked down at the human, holding their head in their hands, looking like they were going to explode.  The doe was about to reach for Kris when the kid looked at their family in their faces, tears running down their war torn face.

Kris began to speak.

""I--I want to go home with you.  I really do.  I want this all to be a bad dream.  But it's not.  I have to live with this but I--I just don't know how to yet. I'm sorry."" Kris sniffed, turning around and running up the stairs.

Toriel sat down, looking defeated, Asgore wrapping a comforting arm around her back.  Azzy looked to Dess, who mentioned to go into the next room with him.

""Sooo...that went about as well as I thought it would.""Azzy blew out air out of his mouth in a gradual fashion, closing the door to the dining room.

""Yeah, our parents suck at solving psychology problems."" Dess rolled her eyes. ""If it comes down to it, I'm taking Kris and Noelle and getting out of dodge.  You can come with if you want.""

""It won't come to that."" Asriel sighed. ""Though to be honest...I wouldn't mind. I am getting tired of my Mom and Dad when it comes to Kris.  They just keep wanting to protect them from the world and it's just making things worse.""

""I'm serious about this, Azzy.  My Mom TRIED to be compassionate the other day though I'm doubting her sincerity now.  Guess that's just me."" The doe crossed her arms, leaning against the wall. ""I'll take my shitbox of a car, pack them in and drive off.""

""I thought that was OUR shitbox of a car...I helped fix it up for you."" Azzy pointed out.

""That's why the offer to come with!"" Dess laughed, elbowing the goatboy. ""Y'know, maybe there is someone we can call.""

""Who?"" Azzy raised an eyebrow. ""You know someone who's familiar with a situation like this?""

""Yep!"" Dess winked. ""My Mom thinks she's rather out there but who cares what she thinks right now.""

""Well, whomever they are, I hope they can convince Kris to come over and play.  I cleaned up Kris' side of the room...it sucks seeing it so barren like that.  Does Kris really think they're nothing?"" Azzy shoved his hands in his pockets, beginning to doubt his own resolve in the situation.

Upstairs in December's room, Kris cried into December's pillow.  A knock at the door came, Kris raising their head.

""My child, it is only me.  May I come in?"" Toriel asked in the most gentle tone she could muster.

Kris raised their head upon hearing the familiar sound of their Mom's voice.  With hesitation, Kris gave their answer.

""...No, I don't want to see you."" Kris replied, throwing their head on it's side.

""Please Kris, I..."" Toriel began to turn the knob.

""I said NO!"" Kris yelled in a crying fit. ""GO AWAY!!""

Toriel was taken aback at the response from the child she had raised for a solid decade plus.  The betrayal in their voice was as fresh as the day she originally felt it.  She let the doorknob go, taking a step back from the door.  There was no getting through to them in this state.

""...As you wish...but Kris, know that we still love you.  That will never change.  Good night, my child."" Toriel walked away from the door, down the stairs.

""Deer Diary--pun still intended--

The kid is out like a light bulb after a very hard day.  Seeing their family again wasn't the best idea after all.  So much for the family intervention, huh?  I was serious when I told Azzy I'd just kidnap the kids and take them off for a better life.  I'd take them and we'd make it on our own as our own little gang...our own little family and our shitbox car.  Better get Azzy to fix the A/C though(damn thing went out again).   Obviously, I don't want to have to do that to them.  Uprooting their lives isn't the answer....no, what we need is an outside perspective.  One with the last name...Ketsukane.

1ia3zye,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConstipationAdvice/comments/1ia3zye/general_advice_also_trying_to_figure_out_how_this/,General advice? Also trying to figure out HOW this happened,"Since around the end of September I have been dealing with constipation. At first I thought maybe it had something to do with my period because I noticed it around the time that I got it so I didn‚Äôt think much of it and took some stool softener. However, it just did not go away. I kept waiting and waiting to feel the need to go and it just wouldn‚Äôt happen?? So I just kept waiting and eventually I just felt so full and bloated all of the time and I decided to go to the doctor. I‚Äôm currently in college so I had to go to the university health center and the doctor there told me to take a stool softener and then miralax twice a day for two weeks. Then after two weeks I could just take the Miralax once a day and slowly take less and less. I was definitely able to go everyday with that and be regular. Unfortunately when I started taking less Miralax I noticed that I wasn‚Äôt able to have a regular bowel movement and when I stopped taking it I just couldn‚Äôt go. So I just decided to keep using the Miralax and would try to take less in attempts to stop using it because I don‚Äôt want to be depended on something else to poop. Then it would just become a cycle where I‚Äôd be regularly taking Miralax and decreasing then stopping and eventually having to take it again. This basically went on for the whole rest of the fall semester. I did prune juice and dried prunes and the first few times I tried either of those it worked but then it stopped working. At some point I tried to take fiber capsules to help me as well but they didn‚Äôt do anything or seemed like they made my constipation worse. Even the types of drinks that would usually and me reaaally go poop like strong coffee or an occasional energy drink didn‚Äôt do anything. Eventually I came home for winter break and I was finally able to see a general practitioner. I explained to her my situation and I also explained to her what I think could have potentially caused all of this. For around 6ish years I‚Äôve been pescatarian and i recently started to incorporate meat into my diet. In April i  occasionally ate meat and then during the summer I ate things like chicken or turkey. every other week or around once a week. The thing is I wasn‚Äôt having any stomach issues when I initially started eating meat again and my bowel movements were normal. The only thing I noticed was an increase of acne. Then when I started school again in the fall, I ate meat more consistently and included some red meats and sometimes other processed meats because that‚Äôs what was available at the dining halls. Other than that a majority of what I ate was the vegetarian options or a salad because the dining halls don‚Äôt usually serve much fish. The doctor told me to take Miralax for a week  and not eat any meat and if nothing changed after that I‚Äôd  a referral for a GI. I already knew that nothing was going to change but took the Miralax anyways. I also did an enema because I just wanted some kind of relief. I finally ended up getting a referral two weeks before I had to go back to school. I explained everything to the GI and they said my change in diet has nothing to do with my constipation and it can only mainly be caused by lack of fiber? Even though I‚Äôm pretty sure adding more fiber made my constipation worse. They prescribed me to take lactulose for two weeks and to eat a fiber cereal everyday and drink lots of water and exercise. They also gave me the nasty giant jug of Golytely that people take for colonoscopy prep to clear me out. I started the Lactose ASAP and it sort of helped but my bowel movements always felt incomplete and I didn‚Äôt feel like it got everything out. As soon as I started eating the fiber cereal I couldn‚Äôt pass a bowel movement even when taking the lactose and drinking a crazy amount of water. When I took the Golytely it was the first time in a long time that I felt fully cleared out and empty. I pooped out five pounds. I was really really really hoping that after taking that, whatever had been stuck in me would finally be cleared out, and I could be more regular after that. It took me four days after the Golytely to have any kind of bowel movement and after that I just ended up constipated again.  I just went back to the GI again today for a checkup. I had bloodwork done to check my thyroid and calcium and there was nothing wrong with it. The GI said they can prescribe me Linzess and I can take that or I can get a Colonoscopy or drink stuff that will show up on an xray to see what could be wrong because I shouldn‚Äôt still be having issues. They said if I do either of those and the results don‚Äôt show anything to explain what‚Äôs happening with me then it‚Äôs likely I have slow transit constipation. They said that no one really knows why people get that and there‚Äôs not really anything you can to about it. Now I‚Äôm really worried that I have slow transit constipation and I‚Äôll be stuck with it the rest of my life or something. I really don‚Äôt know why this happened and I feels like it just came out of nowhere? I don‚Äôt want to depend on taking medicine for who knows how long to deal with this :( I don‚Äôt know if I should take any kinds of supplements, probiotics, digestive enzymes or what. Has there been anyone that has been able to get out of this or do you just have to take medicine for forever? 

I keep trying to think about what could have caused this and I really thought it was the changes to my diet and that my stomach just couldn‚Äôt digest the meat and it slowed everything down. But now I‚Äôm not so sure because surely my body would have gotten used to the meat by now?. Unless it was that and then maybe my body accidentally got dependent on Miralax because I was taking it for a while? My diet is really the only biggest change that I can think of that could be contributing to this. The only other thing I can think of would be that last fall and through the spring I was really active with going to the gym and running. In the middle of the summer I fell off just a bit and stopped going but at the end of the summer I got back into running and I did a 10k race. I got back into being consistent with running and the gym and then in the fall when school started my schedule was crazy and I wasn‚Äôt able to go. My other theory was maybe it was stress from school? I was consistently staying up late in order to complete projects which mainly only happens to me at the end of the semester with finals, but because of my schedule and how much work I had it was like this through majority of the whole semester. IDK anymore I‚Äôm just feel more stressed out that I can‚Äôt solve this because I hate feeling so full and bloated all the time and I don‚Äôt want to be going into my spring semester still dealing with all this crap (literally and figuratively). Any advice would be greatly appreciated because I feel so lost right now. 

Also these are the answers to the questions:

1. I think when this all started my urge just kind of stopped and I would just wait for it. I still don‚Äôt have much urge unless I am taking Miralax or lactose or some kind of laxative. The times that I have had an urge to go without anything to assist me, it has felt very faint and when I go to the bathroom nothing happens 
2. I just have constipation. Diarrhea only a few times if I have taken laxative 
3. No nausea, vomiting, acid reflux or trouble swallowing. I would say I have early satiety. If things have been as cleared out as I can get then it‚Äôs normal but then after a few days I get full easily. Or I already feel full because of how bloated I am 
4. One time when I was in preschool I had a constipation issue once where I had to go to the doctor. But I never had a constipation issue since then. Two years ago I had an ovarian cyst that ruptured, not sure if those can cause constipation issues or not. 
5. I‚Äôve been on accurate twice but it‚Äôs been five years since I‚Äôve taken it. I‚Äôve also been on lexapro for 9 years I think but I have been off of it for over a year now. I never had any gut issues when taking either of these. 
6. I did not suffer from sexual abuse as a child.

Why is it that making girl friends causes me SO much trouble?? Not in the sense that they're annoying obviously i just.. can't seem to do it. 
Literally ever since I started school at 4 years old, I have ALWAYS either been bullied/excluded by other girls. It was really tough. Now, I'm in my second year of college, and the girls are much, much nicer of course but I still haven't made a SINGLE woman friend. I've made a good amount of male friends but I just cannot seem to become friends with any girls. It has really been taking a toll on me because it just feels more and more like I'm helpless and unlikeable. 
My hobbies are less ""traditionally feminine"" I guess but even when I meet a girl with similar interests, they always seem so disinterested. I do have autism so I am somewhat awkward sometimes, but I'm equally as awkward with girls as I am with guys. 
Even if I do manage to get past the awkward stage and become friends with a girl, they always have a close friend or friend group that they'd rather hang out with than me so we just end up fizzling out.
Everytime I see two or three girls getting a coffee, posting together, laughing etc.  I just want to cry because I've never been able to have something like that before and I just don't know what I'm doing wrong.",24,1737859226.0,notliketheothergirls,22,0.72,False

Fire rose over the camp, and this marked the first day of retribution.

###ISRAEL HITS TARGETS IN SYRIA AND LEBANON

Across Syria and Lebanon the IDF has hit as many as 10 PLO bases following the appalling attack in Munich on their olympic team.

Casualties are unable to be estimated and the IDF has declined to comment on the reports although the government of Syria has been quoted as saying up to 200 civilians have been killed in the attacks although this is disputed by experts in Washington, who insist that the camps hit are terrorist training facilities much like the ones that trained the Munich attackers.

Wael never saw the man who killed him.

As he walked back into his apartment block and went to check his post the shots thudded into his back at rapid speed and killed him before he even hit the ground.

A woman who had just rounded the top of the stairs screamed and ran, but the shooter was already leaving again out the front door, long gone by the time the police arrived.

###PALESTINIAN REPRESENTATIVE SHOT DEAD IN ROME


Wael Zwaiter, PLO representative in Rome was found shot dead in his apartment block following a call to the police after gunshots where heard that night.

The death of Zwaiter has come one month after the attacks on PLO bases in Lebanon and Syria and has shocked the people of Rome in its brutality, with some saying that ""Israel has no right to shoot people in our streets"" while others have questioned why Italy itself had not done something earlier.

The Italian Communist Party has vocally criticised the killing, stating that ""Israel had no right to execute someone in the streets of our country"" and has joined the PLO itself in categorically rejecting the premise that Wael had anything to do with the Munich attacks *or* Black September.

His daughter raced towards him to hug her father but she would never get there in time, not before a hail of bullets from a passing car cut Mahmoud down in the street, leaving his wife and child crying over his body....

Mahmoud Hamshari, PLO representative to France, was killed in a drive-by shooting on the night of 8th December. 

Shocking nearby Parisians as well as his own wife and child who witnessed the attack, the killing has been criticsed as Parisians who have protested at the Israeli embassy on the assumption it was them who carried out the attack, with banners reading ""Our Streets Are Not Your Battlefield"".

Much like the killed of Wael Zwaiter two months ago the PLO has denied that Mahmoud had anything to do with the Munich attack and declared the killing as ""shocking and reprehensible assault on a diplomat"".

1ia3wj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/attachment_theory/comments/1ia3wj6/struggling_with_uncertainty_after/,Struggling with Uncertainty After Breakup/Separation from FA Partner,"I‚Äôm seeking advice from the community on how to navigate this situation and what steps I should (and shouldn‚Äôt) take. Here‚Äôs the context:

I‚Äôm a 39M, and my partner is 38F. She‚Äôs had difficult experiences in past relationships and wasn‚Äôt treated well. Before we met two years ago, I was the first person to ever take her on a proper first date. She‚Äôs an incredible person who gives so much to others, but I struggle with anxious attachment. I know this causes me to crave more from her than she or anyone can realistically provide. She feels like she‚Äôs falling short, even though I know it‚Äôs not her fault. One note, she was an orphan from Asia that came to a first world country.

Ten days ago, I brought up a discussion from last year about blending our families (we each have two kids from previous relationships). She suggested some scenarios, but I felt abandoned in those possibilities and expressed concerns about how living further apart could make things difficult. I was looking for reassurance, but instead, I unintentionally triggered her. The next day, I apologised for my behaviour over coffee.

Last Friday, she told me she was having doubts about our relationship. She said she didn‚Äôt think she could give me everything I deserve or want and mentioned fears about being a stepmum or a housewife‚Äîroles I never asked her to take on. She‚Äôs incredibly talented and has a unique career that I love supporting. I think she might have misinterpreted my needs, but she felt overwhelmed and asked for space.

We spoke again last Sunday, and she brought up the idea that I might be better off with someone else who could meet all my needs. I tried to express that I don‚Äôt expect perfection from her, but she said she couldn‚Äôt process any more and needed to be alone. When we met on Wednesday, she dropped off my things but when I asked if she still loved me and could look at the great relationship over 18 months, she did state she still loved me and that this was the best relationship she‚Äôs ever had. However, she‚Äôs now questioning whether marriage or relationships are right for her at all. This hit me hard because I truly believe she‚Äôs an amazing person worth fighting for. She sees my needs as something someone else could fulfill, but I know I need to work on myself as this pattern has repeated in my life.

She finally agreed to try counseling, but it was clear she‚Äôs not optimistic. I positioned it as just an hour to start with and at the very least she will maybe learn something to take forward for her life. I‚Äôve booked an appointment for this coming Friday and emailed her to let her know (without putting pressure on her to attend). My psychologist has told me to focus on giving her the space she‚Äôs asked for and to stop trying to be the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù partner. I know to the non AA but this was Friday evening so less than 48 hours ago, for me this is a lifetime.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs confusing me: I‚Äôve heard from mutual contacts that she seems fine. She will focus on channeling her energy into cleaning, sleeping, working out, and staying busy rather than socializing or other more outward things. Her friend mentioned that we might have different visions of the future, which feels like it goes back to the original issue about blending families‚Äîsomething I thought we could work through with time and compromise. Her dad, who lives with her, is also a big influence. He‚Äôs been leaning on her heavily since his wife passed away, which adds extra strain. Her dad and family aren't sentimental and I did notice she wasn't mourning her mum when we met, a month after she died. This wasn't a rebound as she had tried other forms of speed dating etc before.

She‚Äôs taken steps to create distance, like removing herself from our shared Apple account and disconnecting her car from my account. I don‚Äôt know if this is her dad‚Äôs influence or her decision.

I feel completely lost. I haven‚Äôt heard from her since Wednesday, and I‚Äôm unsure whether to assume silence means the counselling session isn‚Äôt happening or if she needs more time. Her kids are returning to their dad today, so she‚Äôll have more time to reflect this week.

What should I do (or not do) in this situation? How do I respect her space while working on myself and showing her I‚Äôm serious about growing? Is this worth fighting for, and how do I keep hope alive without overwhelming her? Should I wait until Wednesday to confirm the counselling session or assume her silence is the answer?

This will be a long one, so bear with me.

A little background story, I'm a Dutch guy living in Vietnam. My wife is Vietnamese. 
I moved here about 7 years ago and we've been busy. During the Covid pandemic I traveled for work a lot between Vietnam and Korea. I got lucky to have missed the first peaks everywhere, but did get locked out of Vietnam and had to go back to Holland for a while. 
I never got Covid during this time. And when I finally was able to get back to Vietnam in November 2020 we started building our dream house we'd been preparing for. We built it all ourselves, the biggest project of my life at the time.
We finished it just in time for the lockdowns and got to spend that time developing our garden, as we wanted to sustain ourselves with it. 
We quickly realized 500m¬≤ is by far not enough for that. So we made the hard decision to sell it and start over on a bigger piece of land further into the middle of nowhere. 
Before we could do that I had to visit Holland again for family and paperwork. This was also the last time I got to visit my grandpa who whose health condition (not Covid related) was getting worse. 
When I visited he started to have a light cough and was tested for Covid, but I didn't think much of it because he was heavily vaccinated and I had my shots too (Chinese vaccine) and I was in very good health and strong, so I didn't care and visited my grandpa anyway. 
Turns out he had Covid and infected me too. He healed quickly and I had light symptoms, mainly coughing and a day of fever. 
I recovered and traveled back to Vietnam and started the next part of our life to build up a new house and develop a hectare of land into food forest. This was March 2022.
Over the next few years I developed many weird symptoms, had many stress related illnesses like hives and burnout symptoms. 
I was always tired. Initially we thought it had to do with all the work I'd been doing. But no amount of rest seemed enough. 
I'd feel strong and do some light jobs around the house and the next day I was completely out of it. No energy, depressed. 
Because of this I started to do a lot of work inside, on the computer. It wouldn't exhaust me as much, but might have made things worse because of the lack of sunlight (it'll make sense later on).
After my first infection with Covid I had two more suspected infections. It was either that or the flu, but I didn't get it tested. The last one was three weeks ago and every symptom I had before just went into overdrive. Added to that I started getting dizzy to the point of almost fainting. 
I had some checks done in the hospital a few times over the years, but that never amounted to anything. The doctors were just guessing stress was the cause of it all, but it didn't sit right with me. I felt lost, didn't recognize myself at all and got very frustrated. Nothing seemed to help. 

After the last infection three weeks ago (either Covid or flu, I had fever and a lot of coughing, I'm still coughing up some stuff from my lungs on occasion) I stumbled across long Covid and a few things clicked. I started researching a lot online and everything seemed to match. 

Since I'd lost just about any trust in the local doctors I decided to try and research this myself and see what the ""cutting edge"" science said about this. 
YouTube is an amazing resource in this. 
This video from medcram is a must watch for every long hauler: 
https://youtu.be/JGO2qb7wZns?si=2OQJHerinvqhWFVj
They have a few more videos about it which are good to get more background. 
It's quite heavy on the medical terms, but still understandable for any layman (as I am as well)

With this information and some other bits and pieces I got together using the help of AI (another helpful tool) I put together a treatment plan for myself. This went in steps, but for about a week now I'm doing the same one and the change is unbelievable. My stool even turned healthy after being loose for at least a year, maybe more. 
I'm no doctor, but all these things are grounded in science and together seem to be extremely powerful. My energy levels are off the chart, my brain fog is gone. My wife told me she almost forgot this old me existed. And this is after about a week only.

My daily treatment: 
- Before I get out of bed I do the Wim Hof breathing exercise and finish it with 20 minutes meditation. This has been proven to be anti inflammatory and helps push oxygen into cells and trains the lungs without exertion. (You'll notice intense energy right after this already)
- two cups of turmeric tea (powder mixed in warm water) also anti inflammatory, Ginger might work too.
- I try to spend as much time outside in green areas (for me that's my garden, but a park is good of course), according to the medcram video the NIR light helps the body recover, watch the video for the details. I wear thin clothes so I'm protected from uv but the infrared gets through to my whole body. 
- Quit coffee, alcohol and smoking (daily weed smoker, which in hindsight made everything worse as well, edibles are fine for me)

That's it. No medicine. All free (granted not everyone can grow turmeric in their garden)

It was written on brittle parchment, the ink dark and glossy, as though it had never dried. There were no pleasantries, no signature‚Äîonly a single line, written in precise, angular script:¬†¬†

‚ÄúCome to the Atramentum Library. You have been chosen.‚Äù

The letter contained no address, but I knew where to go. I couldn‚Äôt explain how. The knowledge was simply there in my mind, like a memory I hadn‚Äôt known I‚Äôd forgotten.¬†¬†

I left that same night, abandoning the warmth of my study for the cold, fog-drenched streets.¬†¬†

The library stood at the edge of a forest, its silhouette towering against the moonless sky. It wasn‚Äôt like any building I‚Äôd ever seen‚Äîits architecture was jagged, unnatural, as though it had been carved from a single block of black stone by a hand that did not care for symmetry or reason.¬†¬†

Its doors were enormous, carved with symbols I couldn‚Äôt read but felt deep in my gut‚Äîlike sharp claws raking across my mind.¬†¬†

As I stepped inside, the air grew cold and heavy, pressing against my skin like a damp shroud.¬†¬†

The library was vast. Endless.¬†¬†

The shelves stretched up into the darkness, higher than any cathedral‚Äôs ceiling. Books crammed every inch of space‚Äîsome ancient, their pages crumbling with age; others sleek and pristine, their spines glowing faintly as though they were alive. The smell of paper and ink mingled with something fouler: the metallic tang of blood, the acrid scent of burnt hair.¬†¬†

But it wasn‚Äôt silent.¬†¬†

Whispers drifted through the air, faint but constant, like a thousand voices murmuring in languages I couldn‚Äôt understand. I stopped in my tracks, my breath catching.¬†¬†

The whispers weren‚Äôt coming from the shadows. They were coming from the books.¬†¬†

The first book I touched burned me.¬†¬†

It was small, bound in what looked like cracked leather, its title unreadable. The moment my fingers brushed the cover, heat shot through me, searing my skin and sending a wave of nausea rolling through my stomach. I jerked my hand back, stumbling.¬†¬†

The book opened itself, its pages fluttering as though caught in an invisible wind. Words began to write themselves across the parchment, black ink spreading like blood through water:¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou are not ready.‚Äù

The book slammed shut, the force of it knocking me backward.¬†¬†

I gasped, cradling my hand. The skin was unmarked, but it still throbbed as though burned.¬†¬†

That was when I noticed the shadows.¬†¬†

They moved between the shelves, not like people but like things crawling on too many limbs. They were slow, deliberate, and watching me.¬†¬†

I pressed forward, deeper into the library, drawn by something I couldn‚Äôt name.¬†¬†

The deeper I went, the stranger the books became.¬†¬†

One was bound in something that looked alarmingly like human skin, its surface tattooed with symbols that seemed to shift when I wasn‚Äôt looking. when I touch it again same thing happened I burn my fingure.

Some books didn‚Äôt even have covers. They writhed on the shelves like living things, their pages curling and uncurling, whispering secrets to one another in voices too quiet to hear.¬†¬†

But one book called to me.¬†¬†

It sat alone on a pedestal in the center of a circular room, its cover blacker than the shadows around it. As I approached, the whispers grew louder, forming words I could almost understand.¬†¬†

The title burned itself into my mind before I even opened it: The secret book of Atramentum.

I reached out, my hand trembling. The moment I touched the cover, the library changed.¬†¬†

The shelves groaned, their wood twisting and splintering. The whispers turned to screams, shrill and panicked, echoing through the endless halls. The shadows surged forward, slamming into me, and I realized too late that they weren‚Äôt shadows at all.¬†¬†

They were demons.¬†¬†

I don‚Äôt know how I survived.¬†¬†

One moment, the shadows were clawing at me, their hands tearing at my flesh, and the next, I was standing in a new room‚Äîvast, circular, and empty except for a single figure.¬†¬†

It sat on a throne of bone and books, its body cloaked in tattered robes that seemed to shift and ripple like smoke. Its face was hidden, but I could feel its eyes on me, burning holes into my soul.¬†¬†

It spoke without moving, its voice deep and echoing:¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou seek knowledge, mortal. But knowledge has a price.‚Äù

I tried to speak, but my throat was dry, my voice stolen by fear.¬†¬†

The figure rose, towering over me, its form impossibly large. It gestured to the secret book in my hands.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou have chosen the book. Now the book chooses you.‚Äù¬†





The pages of the secret book began to turn, faster and faster, the air around me filling with the sound of tearing flesh and breaking bones. Words I couldn‚Äôt understand burned themselves into my skin, their heat searing me to the core.¬†¬†

I screamed, but the sound was swallowed by the library.¬†¬†


When I woke, the library was silent.¬†¬†

The book lay open beside me, its pages blank and still. My body ached, my hands trembling as I tried to push myself up. Every nerve in me screamed, as if I‚Äôd been hollowed out and left raw.¬†¬†

But something was wrong.¬†¬†

The whispers hadn‚Äôt stopped. They were louder now, clearer, and they weren‚Äôt coming from the books anymore.¬†¬†

They were coming from inside me.¬†¬†

I froze, my chest tightening as I realized the truth. The Keeper‚Äôs voice echoed in my mind, calm and cold:¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou are the book now. A vessel for knowledge. A doorway to the abyss.‚Äù

I stumbled to my feet, the whispers pressing against my soul, desperate and endless. I could feel the weight of the library itself shifting around me, its walls groaning as the shadows closed in.¬†¬†

But I wasn‚Äôt afraid anymore.¬†¬†

Because something else had taken root inside me‚Äîsomething dark, something hungry.¬†¬†

I didn‚Äôt walk toward the door. I was pulled.¬†¬†

The entrance to the library was different now. Where before there had been massive, carved doors, there was now only an archway of jagged stone, framing an endless void.¬†¬†

And through that void, I could see the world outside.¬†¬†

I stepped forward, the air crackling around me, and the whispers inside my head rose to a deafening roar. My hands burned, and when I looked down, I saw words scrawling themselves across my skin‚Äîendless, twisting lines of ink that moved and shifted like living things.¬†¬†

The Keeper‚Äôs voice spoke again, soft and patient:¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou will return to the world, but you will not leave this library. You carry it now. You are its herald, its seed. Wherever you go, the library will follow.‚Äù

I tried to resist, tried to fight it, but it was too late. The void pulled me in, and when I opened my eyes again, I was standing in my study room.

At first, I thought I had escaped.¬†¬†

The familiar comfort of my bookshelves and desk greeted me, the moonlight streaming through the window. Everything looked the same as I had left it.¬†¬†

But then I saw the shadows.¬†¬†

They writhed along the edges of the room, moving in and out of the bookshelves, stretching toward me like hungry fingers. The air smelled of old blood and burnt hair. And when I turned to the mirror on the wall, I didn‚Äôt see my own reflection.¬†¬†

I saw shelves.¬†¬†

Endless shelves, stretching into darkness, their books alive and breathing. I saw myself walking those aisles, bound in shadows, and I realized the truth.¬†¬†

The library wasn‚Äôt just following me.¬†¬†

It was inside me.¬†

I didn‚Äôt leave the house for weeks. The whispers never stopped, and every night, I found myself writing‚Äîpages and pages of words I didn‚Äôt understand, scrawled in ink that bled from my fingertips.¬†¬†

And then the letter came.¬†¬†

It was on the same brittle parchment, the ink dark and glossy, and it was written in that same angular script:¬†¬†

‚ÄúCome to the Atramentum Library. You have been chosen.‚Äù¬†¬†

But this time, the letter wasn‚Äôt addressed to me.¬†¬†

It was addressed to my neighbor.¬†¬†

I stood at my window, watching as she read it‚Äîa young woman in her twenties, her face lighting up with curiosity. She tucked the letter into her coat and glanced toward my house, her eyes meeting mine.¬†¬†

I didn‚Äôt wave. I couldn‚Äôt.¬†¬†

Because I knew what would happen next.¬†¬†

She would go. She would enter the library. And I would feel it growing stronger.¬†¬†

And when she came back, she would carry the same curse. The library wasn‚Äôt just a place‚Äîit was a hunger, spreading like a disease. And I was part of it now.¬†¬†

I am the first step. The invitation. The bait.¬†¬†

The library would always need new readers.¬†¬†

And I would always be there to welcome them.¬†¬†¬†

Days turned into weeks, and the library‚Äôs grip on me only grew stronger.¬†¬†

At first, the changes were small. Shadows lingered in the corners of my vision, even in broad daylight. I could hear the books whispering to me, their voices weaving through my thoughts like threads in a loom. Sleep became a distant memory. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw its aisles‚Äîendless, twisting, alive.¬†¬†

Then, the physical changes began.¬†¬†

The ink didn‚Äôt stay on my skin. It spread. Dark lines snaked up my arms and over my chest, forming symbols I couldn‚Äôt read but somehow understood. They burned when I touched them, a reminder of the knowledge now trapped inside me.¬†¬†

I couldn‚Äôt leave the house anymore. Not really. Every time I stepped outside, the world felt... thinner. Like the ground beneath me wasn‚Äôt real. Like I was walking on the surface of a dream, and the library was the reality waiting to swallow me whole.¬†¬†

I wasn‚Äôt a man anymore. I was a doorway.

The young woman returned three days later.¬†¬†

I heard her footsteps first, slow and hesitant, echoing through the empty street. She looked different now‚Äîher face pale, her eyes wide and glassy.¬†¬†

And the whispers. I could hear them coming from her too.¬†¬†

She knocked on my door, her hand trembling. I didn‚Äôt want to answer. I didn‚Äôt want to face what I had done. But my body wasn‚Äôt mine anymore.¬†¬†

I opened the door.¬†¬†

Her gaze snapped to mine, and for a moment, she didn‚Äôt speak. Then she stepped inside, her voice barely a whisper:¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou knew, didn‚Äôt you? You knew what it would do to me.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúI...‚Äù My voice faltered. There were no words I could say to make her understand.¬†¬†

She raised her hands, and I saw the ink spreading across her skin, just like mine. ‚ÄúWhat happens to us now?‚Äù¬†¬†

I wanted to tell her the truth. That the library wasn‚Äôt finished with us. That we were its heralds, its servants. But before I could speak, she crumpled to the floor, her body writhing as the ink consumed her.¬†¬†

The library was claiming her.¬†

The next letter came a week later. Then another.¬†¬†

I watched from my window as they were delivered to homes across the city. I recognized the hunger in their eyes as they opened them, that same curiosity that had led me to my own ruin.¬†¬†

One by one, they disappeared. And one by one, they came back, changed.¬†¬†

The city itself began to feel different. Shadows stretched longer than they should, twisting across the ground like living things. The air grew heavier, colder, as though the library‚Äôs presence was leaking into the world.¬†¬†

And then there were the books.¬†¬†

They started appearing in places they didn‚Äôt belong‚Äîon park benches, in coffee shops, on subway seats. Each one carried the same whispers, the same promises of forbidden knowledge. And every time someone touched one, I felt the library‚Äôs power surge inside me, growing stronger.¬†¬†¬†

It wasn‚Äôt just the books or the people. The city itself was changing.¬†¬†

One night, I wandered the streets, trying to understand what was happening. I turned a corner and found myself standing in a place that shouldn‚Äôt exist‚Äîa street lined with shelves, stretching into the darkness. The books on those shelves glowed faintly, their titles written in a language I couldn‚Äôt read.¬†¬†

I stepped closer, my heart pounding, and a voice whispered from behind me:¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre spreading it.‚Äù¬†¬†

I turned to see the young woman, her face now hollow and her eyes sunken. She smiled, though it was a joyless thing, her teeth sharp and stained with ink.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThis is how it begins,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe library isn‚Äôt just a place anymore. It‚Äôs becoming... everything.‚Äù¬†¬†

The realization hit me like a blow.¬†¬†

The library wasn‚Äôt satisfied with taking people one by one. It was growing, consuming, expanding its reach. Soon, the whole city would become part of it and rule by the whispers of the books and the will of the Keeper.¬†¬†

And I was its key.¬†¬†

Every person I touched, every book I wrote, every letter I sent‚Äîall of it was spreading the library‚Äôs influence.¬†¬†

I wanted to stop. I wanted to scream, to fight, to burn every book I could find. But the library wouldn‚Äôt let me.¬†¬†

Because deep down, a part of me didn‚Äôt want to stop.¬†¬†

The last time I saw my reflection, I didn‚Äôt recognize myself.¬†¬†

My face was gone, replaced by swirling ink and shifting words. My body wasn‚Äôt flesh anymore; it was paper and shadow, hollow and endless.¬†¬†

And yet, I felt... complete.¬†¬†

The library had taken everything from me, but it had given me something too: purpose.¬†¬†

Last night, I wrote a new letter. My hand moved on its own, scrawling the words with ink that seemed to bleed from my fingers. When it was done, I sealed it and left it on the doorstep of a man down the street.¬†¬†

I don‚Äôt know his name. I don‚Äôt need to.¬†¬†

He‚Äôll find his way. They always do.¬†¬†

And soon, he‚Äôll join us.¬†¬†

The library is coming.¬†¬†

And nothing can stop it.¬†¬†",2,1737858846.0,creepypasta,5,1.0,False

Being a guy that has NO idea about anything structural or zoning restrictions, I'm wondering if anyone else have had thoughts.

I actually played around with gpt giving me a post for reddit based on some ideas I had but didn't want to be overly pushy with it as I'm genuinely wondering what could it become if it wasn't bought up and used as low-income-soon-to-be-unafforable living space. Here's that post:

3501 Hiawatha, an industrial property for sale in Minneapolis, but here‚Äôs the twist: there‚Äôs already a tenant‚ÄîADM Milling Company‚Äîwhich takes up about 45,000 square feet of the site‚Äôs ~82,000.

That leaves around 37,000 square feet of space to work with, plus outdoor areas, and it got me thinking: what could this place become?

Could it somehow blend the industrial vibe of ADM with something fresh and community-focused? Maybe a mix of spaces‚Äîa local market, a coffee shop, or something more out there? How could the silos or remaining buildings be repurposed in creative ways - climbing walls, mini solar farm, etc.?

And what about sustainability? Could solar panels on the roofs or even small wind turbines make this place more energy-efficient, benefiting both ADM and future tenants?

Could the community come together and buy this place, redevelop and dedicate the profits to schools or small community action partners?

I‚Äôm curious‚Äîhow would you balance a working industrial tenant with creative redevelopment? What would you do with this site? ",4,1737858777.0,Minneapolis,4,0.75,False

Above him, a blinding ray of light pierced through the darkness, casting an eerie glow on his unbothered face. Behind him, a brick wall adorned with graffiti stood ominously. His captor, a figure cloaked in shadows, aimed a familiar weapon at Joshua, his eyes filled with malice. The Captor proceeded to interrogate Joshua, the tension thick in the air, firing a menacing bullet every time an answer was given, regardless of its accuracy. Each bullet flying past Josh's, again and again. Just before the sixth question, a look of grim hope crossed Joshua's face, his futile attempt to prepare for the final shot. As the Captor stepped into the radiant beam of light, Joshua's initial fear morphed into profound despair as he recognized the telltale colors of purple and white. The gun discharged with a deafening bang, the impact causing Joshua to tumble backward, hitting the ground with a resounding thud. The once graffiti-covered wall now dripped with a sickeningly vibrant pink liquid, the room now marred by the ominous substance. Amongst the chaos, a black pin landed in the pink liquid next to the ultimate composer's feet, with a faint trail of smoke erupting from it.!<

Attempting to rise from his cozy spot, he is suddenly buried by objects falling from above, enclosing him within a cocoon of objects. Slowly but surely, the hammock begins to sink. With determined effort, Kariya manages to free one arm and starts removing the debris. In the process, he grabs one of the objects and was about to throw it until he realizes it's a mirror reflecting him and the hammock he's pressed into as a strange red mark starts to poke out from it.

This is my first post here because I am not sure where else to turn for some advice, and recommendations from individuals who struggle with the same disease. I am a 24 y/o F, and for the past four years I have been battling to keep my disease in remission with little or no success. I have been hospitalized 6 or 7 times in the last four years, with the worst case being a bowel obstruction. A part of my colon was almost removed twice, and I had antibiotics to recover from appendicitis twice as well. I have had an anal fistula surgery when I was younger, and I have some strictures in my GI tract from damage in the past. My ESR number has fluctuated from 7 all the way to 89 and even higher, and my calprotectin has seen the 1500+ markers.

Trying to keep this as short as possible - but at the end of 2023 I thought my fight was over when I was finally swapped to Rinvoq 15mg x3 (45mg dose) tablets per day. Rinvoq worked incredible for this past year of 2024. I was going on runs again outside, lifting heavier weights than I ever had before at the gym, enjoying green tea and the occasional coffee again (never alcohol or smoking). I was even able to re-introduce simple or blended fruits and vegetables back into my diet. I didn't feel scared anymore of eating one wrong food item and ending up back in urgent care or worse for a stay.

For some reason even though there has been no dietary changes, no alcohol, no smoking, no high fiber foods (everything you are NOT supposed to do with our disease), I am experiencing a flare up again that has been ongoing since mid december 2024, until now as I type this. My ESR number is shooting back up into the 40's again, calprotectin above 1200, and I had to go to the ER where I was prescribed prednisone and now budesonide steroids at a 40mg dosage per day. Worst of all, I had another CT scan done that shows ""a 7cm length stricture of the distal ileum and terminal ileum with acute hyperenhancement,"" and ""another 2cm length shorter segment stricture of the distal ileal loops noted slightly to the left of the midline."" I can feel these when I try going to the gym or working out and it has halted my progress for now trying to do anything high intensity.

For full context, I have failed; **Remicade, Humira, Stelara, Entyvio** (entyvio I only gave 3 months - my diet was reduced to plain rice and chicken and I felt nothing on entyvio) and **now \*potentially\* rinvoq**. At this point, I'm at a bit of a loss on what to even do. I continue to work with my doctor, and there is a potential she will want to switch me to Skyrizi soon, but we haven't discussed the CT scan results. Even then, for four years now I have been living with these strictures around my colon and they have genuinely degraded the quality of my life by so much. I like to think that this disease has made me a stronger person because of what I have had to endure, but at what point is it worth it to remove sections of my colon to improve my quality of life? Does anyone have any experience with something similar to this, failing medications, or any general advice?

I would love to get into more details of my full diet and supplement routine I was taking while Rinvoq was working amazingly, but I don't want to make this post too long. I appreciate anyone who has taken the time to read this far. I have been in a big mental slump recently just wondering when the pain will end and what I might be doing wrong. If anyone has any home remedies, or recommendations for the healing of the strictures as well please let me know! Thank you!! <3",6,1737857849.0,CrohnsDisease,11,1.0,False

I just wrote a short story about going out for coffee, it's very simple actually, so I just wanted some feedback on it to see if I can flesh out a full story with this type of writing.

If you have any critique/advice DM me, it's cool

Give it a read, it's really short haha.

Changed names to hide identities. would love some input,"To my dearest, (Name). I miss you and hope that Life has been treating you amazingly. I've decided to wait for you and believe the promise you made to me. That one day in the distant future you'll come back to me. My feelings for you have not wavered for a minute since you left. I have woken up a single morning and not missed holding the most precious thing I've ever had or will have for my entire life. I still think of that amazing cute smile you gave me when you fed the seals and the love in your eyes I saw that changed my whole perspective on life. The first time I wanted your phone to get us to food when we first met and I raised my hand and you grabbed mine ike no ones ever held me before. With a warmth and love that Ill never know again. I Know your my person, and that we are meant to be. Im sorry I met you at the wrong time and things didn't work out right away. But I saw how much you loved me and how much we meat to each other. I know your only eighteen and have a lot of life left to live and I hope you live it to the fullest and enjoy every second of it. I cant wait till you realize again that you miss and love me and decide to reach back out to me.¬†

There hasn't been a single moment when I haven't received a notification or call that I don't pray its from you. My heart will always ache that I hurt and lost you. But I believe in what you told me. That you love me and cant wait to love me in the future and to be in my life again. That I am your person and we met at the wrong time in your life. I told you not to tell me these things if you didn't mean them. If you weren't going to come back. I made you swear to me. And you stuck to the promise in that moment you didn't waiver you didn't lie I saw in your eyes you want to come back. Maybe not this year maybe not next but one day and that filled my heart with the sweatess relief. Knowing that you (Name), my person would come back to me. I made you promise to keep in touch and to check in with me and you have blocked me on everything. I dont know if you broke this promise to me because your scared of what we could have or if your simply needing space and time to yourself to see other people. But Im completely ok with that and I understand that you need to do this. Also that you need to live your young adult life. I told you I will always give you a home if you need it and I meant every single word of it. If you need a place and aren't ready to come back to me thats ok too. I would be thrilled to just be able to keep you safe and warm.

¬†I really miss you, the way you'd always wear the cutest messy bun. Or the way you would always be the best cat mom to sugar. How your cute little snort giggle would blow my world away and make me feel like the luckiest man alive to have heard it.I miss seeing the cute way your face would light up whenever your mom texted you or when I came home and you saw me. Of course I miss Lana and Sabrina, my two favorite girls who have always been perfectly perky for me and just love everything about them. Morgan who I've always loved meeting face to face and teasing. And even Stephany, which surprises me because we both know Stephany is an asshole. I miss you as a person hearing your amazing views on life and your amazing story that im so proud of you for sharing with me and letting me be apart of it. Im sure right now only two weeks after you have left you haven't thought of me very much, but there hasn't been a second of any day that I haven't prayed you'd walk that cute little sassy walk you do back into my life.¬†

I miss getting your nails done and sending you flowers. I miss providing for you and buying you the things that made you happy. I miss spending every single night together and feeling your warm that I do fear I may never feel again. This isnt me trying to buy you, this is how I show you just how much I care. The day after you left I got the ring that made your cute little face shine so bright with joy when you saw it at fred myers. The three blue stones and the small diamonds. You said it was way too much and told me to not get it. But you're worth it (Name), there will never be enough that I wouldn't be willing to give to you. You're my whole world and you meant everything to me and it broke my heart that I made you feel like you needed to leave. Every single day I have wanted to reach out, try to win you back and tell you that I love you. But I am trying with all my reason to respect that you blocked me and need space. I'm trying my best right now to write your cathedral out of paragraphs. And write my way back into your heart, hopefully without you burning this letter.¬†

    I've been up for days debating whether I should give this letter to you. Give you this ring and after every scenario and every event I could think of. The best thing I could do for you is let you come back to me in your own way on your own time. Maybe somehow I will give you this in a few years, I'm not sure. But for now all I want you to know is you've been the brightest gleaming gem in my life. You are the Lacuna of my soul. I will never love again the way the fires of hell made my heart burn for you. I love you (Name) And I will never love or be with anyone else like you. My heart Belongs to you whether you want¬† it or not. I would never force this love or my emotions onto you unless you wanted me. And wanted to return my love and finally be together.
    
    
    
    It's weird how I feel lonely when I am surrounded by friends. How my laughs feel empty and my smiles feel worn. How my heart feels like it hasn't beat since that day you left. I didn't know finding your person would feel like this. I didn't know that every trilla second there gone would feel like an eternity of sorrow of the greatest torment. I will never regret meeting you because I've truly never been happier in my life than the five months you were in it. I keep thinking September 13th was the day I discovered true happiness and I could finally breathe for the first time in my life. The amazing day you decided to be mine. But to feel great pleasure I didn't realize it came with this great pain.¬†
    
    
    
    I wanted to talk about everything. The bad, the good, and all the in-between in this letter. Because for me I wouldn't trade a second of it with father time if my life depended on it. I truly felt joy in every disagreement, every scandal, and every laugh because I spent it with you. I would give up the rest of my life just to spend another five minutes with you and pass away peacefully. I mean every word of this letter to you and it is how I truly feel.¬†
    
    
    
    I miss your amazing smile at the Korn concert. The great joy I saw it bring you was worth every second of overtime it took to buy those tickets. I have missed your cute little butt struggling to get in those jeans every time you changed. The way you brush your teeth in the shower. The way you acted Like I was your worst enemy when I got you up every morning.¬†
    
    
    
    I miss kissing you and telling you how you were my everything every morning whether you remembered it in that adorable sleepy head of yours or not. I wish I could do it if not just one more time in my life. I never knew how finding your person could feel and Even with this gaping hole in my chest I would do it all over again for you.

If you ever read this I wanted to thank you for coming into my life. I know you may think that you derailed it by us moving in and leaving but I think it just showed me how much you matter to me.

I will wait my entire life alone and die alone. Then risk missing out on even the smallest chance of you coming back and me not having waited. I know no one will ever make me fell this way again. No one will ever be mine the way you were. I miss the bite marks you'd leave on me for weeks just knowing they were there because you loved me. So thank you (Name). For giving my life a spark of joy and hope that you'll be mine again.

I understand you left because you're young and not sure if you even want a family. That you're still chasing the honeymoon phase of relationships and don't truly understand what love is yet. I wanted to let you know when I told you I loved you back that night in my bed watching JJK. I didn't say it meaninglessly. I wasn't just responding. I was at that moment deciding I wanted you for the rest of my life and my heart only belonged to you. That I would be there for you through thick and thin and be your person even if you decided one day you weren't mine. I said I love you and meant no matter what we face and what challenges we are going through we will do it together and take care of each other.

¬†You'll learn this in the future, I'm sure of it. You did say it'd take years for you to be ready and I'm ok waiting centuries for you. Harlequin you are worth it. Every second of being alone and even risking spending my life alone. And if you don't come back I will still love you. Because That's a promise I made to you and I will never break it. Just know there's always me who will love you and be there if you need anything.

I miss how annoyed you get when I said Sabrina Carpenter was your favorite singer. Or your cute angry face you'd get when I made a mistake and you'd be so adorable trying to act like you didnt love me. And the way you smile will and to this day always makes my day. I loved that you got your first deer and fish with my dad. And that my dad loves you and my whole family loves you and they have been devastated that you left. These are all things that I have fallen for time and time again. Just like when I took you to watch coraline. How happy that made you. I will never forget it till the day I die. How much I could see that you wanted to kiss me then and there.¬†

I was there for you when we found out you were pregnant and it wasn't Mine. That was really hard for me and I respected your decision on not keeping it and was there for you through it. That was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do in my life. You were a mess and I did my best and I hope you only have fond memories like me bringing you your favorite snacks and drinks and the flowers I got you. Me always being there for you and never letting you know how sad I was because you needed me and I was just so happy to be that person for you. To have you in my life. Honestly if it meant having to treat me like shit again and millions of abortions I would do all of them for you. I feel there isn't a mountain I wouldn't conquer for you. I truly and will always Love you Harlequin Knight.

(MY BFF NAME) is my best friend and my brother of eight years. He‚Äôs the only family I have and he told me¬† that he‚Äôs going to pursue you. That broke my heart all over again to hear from him. All I wish is if you do choose him as your life partner is he always treats you right and always makes you smile. The way I always wanted too.

    I pray every night that you will come back into my life and we can start over. I can make you fall in love with me all over again. I understand you want to live out your youth. I'm pretty young myself and also have a lot of maturing to do. But I hope when you're ready to commit to someone you think of what we have and the promise you made to me. Then come and brighten my life up Like you did all those months ago. I know what we had wasn't the longest relationship in the world but to me it will always be the most meaningful connection I will ever feel to someone.
    
    
    
    I plan to work on myself While your away. Tackle my depression and awful traits you told me about. Like my heaving stomping and the babytalk. Go to the gym everyday and get myself a house and a home. And hopefully give you a home and one day if you decide you want one a beautiful family. Because I know your going to have the most beautiful children god has ever created. I pray I'm the man helping you bring such joy into this hurtful world we live in.
    
    
    
    Ill have you your own little garden where you can grow your little weed plants, BUDs I remember you calling them. A big porch where you can relax and enjoy your mornings with a fresh cup of coffee you love to have every morning. All the room for any of the animals you want and all the room in the house for your thousands of different hobbies you wanna do. I hope that when I build this house and stay on my course. God brings you back to me and we can be happy again. Because the only thing I want you to get out of this letter (Name) is that I love you and I want to take care of you.¬†
    
    
    
    Even get you little adrenaline drunkie ass on motorbike. So you can feel free and come and go as you please. Always there to hand you your lucky cig. And buy you an amazing dab setup so you can smoke that stoner little heart till you die happy. I miss you (NAME) everyday, and I really want you back. I know a man shouldn't plead and beg for a woman's attention. That it normally pushes them away. Im just trying to tell you how much you meant to me, and how much Ill always care for you whether you come back to me or not.¬†
    
    
    
    I miss movie nights and late night drives. Seeing you try not to smile when I get your nails done. Taking you shopping for new clothes which you love. Buying you nice things because you deserve to have nice things. It breaks my heart knowing you are living in a trailer park sleeping on two wood chairs with two people, 4 cats and 2 dogs. That you told me you feel gross showering there. I wish you'd let me come take you home and give you a bed and clean shower. But I understand you chose this and its what you want right now. I hope that in the future you think of me and remember all the good times we had together that I've talked about. Even the ghost face mask that I still can't believe I did for you. I'd do it again however because you're such an amazing person (NAME).

I know I'm not perfect. I'm a mouth breather. I'm selfish at times. I get lost in depression and overthink everything. I know you hate these things about me. That I get excited about things and annoy you and that you think a lot of what I do reminds you of your dad. But I would never lay a finger on you. I love you. I would and always will keep you safe above all else. That's why I made you promise me if you didn't have a roof over your head you'd come back Even if just as a roommate. I saw how much you struggled in the last week of our relationship deciding if you should leave or not. I think there was a big chance you didn't. I'm so sorry I blew it by having a breakdown and crying my eyes out in front of you.

¬†I also wanted to apologize for how I viewed sex and how I dealt with it. Like you said about the flowers that you wanted me to get you flowers and not need to ask to get you flowers. That's exactly how I felt about sex. I want to have it but not have to ask for it. And I'm sorry I made such a big deal about it when near the end we kinda stopped. But I viewed it as a big connection to you and I should have made it so important to me (Name). Because if you wanted to be with me and never have sex again I would Die happy. I mean that and I'm so sorry it took you leaving for me to realize it. I hope it's not too late to have you in my life again. In having you gone it's made me realize how much growing up I also still have to do and I plan to. I will mature into a person worthy of your love, not just your attraction.¬†

I do feel in a relationship you didn't value the things I did for us and you asked a lot of me. I provided us with a two bedroom new apartment and I gave us food and wifi and computers and cars. I set us up to live a good life together. I thought at the time that I was doing enough for you and I think in time you'll see I did do a lot. But I see that you also tried your best. You made me food whenever you felt Like you could handle that and always did the dishes and laundry which I appreciate everything you did and I thank you to this day. I put a lot of hours into my work so we could move in together and It was too soon. We should have waited to have sex and live together. But I didn't want you living with your ex anymore with how he abused you. (NAME) I wanted to keep you safe so I did what I could to get us where I got us. I'm sorry if I also did not value the things you did because you did do a lot.¬†

I will never let you go (NAME) but if you decide you never want to hear from me again let me know and I will make sure you never hear from me again. I love you, thank you again for the amazing five months you spent with me. I also have your tickets if you'd like them. They were a gift and as far as I'm concerned belong to you. Ill take you if you would like. But if you go with (MY BFF NAME) or someone else I understand.¬†

I love you and I hope one day I can see you again and you can make me smile like you always do. I am gonna wait for you and it's my choice. If you don't want to come back to me I understand. You are the love of my life and I will always be here for you. You once told me If we were dirt poor and homeless on the side of the street that you would be ok if I was there with you and that's the exact moment I knew I loved you (NAME) and I always will. I wish you the best in your life and hope you get the perfect ending you desire. I pray you keep the promise you made to me and I can have a second chance. I love you (NAME), you are my person. And I'm always here for you.
