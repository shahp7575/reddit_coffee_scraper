1l1chdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_btc100k/comments/1l1chdr/this_3d_video_tool_made_my_content_unskippable/,This 3D Video Tool Made My Content Unskippable ‚Äî Here‚Äôs How,"Look‚Ä¶

I used to spend hours editing short videos.  
Add captions. Trim dead air. Animate some text. Tweak the transitions.  
It was draining. Clients would love the final product, but I‚Äôd barely break even.

Then a friend showed me something that flipped everything:  
A tool called **ClipsMate AI**.

üëâ [**https://imsuccessconnection.com/ClipsMateAI**](https://imsuccessconnection.com/ClipsMateAI)

I‚Äôm not big on ‚Äúshiny object‚Äù tools.  
But this one?  
It earned a permanent place in my business.

# Here‚Äôs what happened‚Ä¶

I took an old tweet from a client ‚Äî literally just a 2-line quote.

Pasted it into ClipsMate.  
Selected one of their 3D animated templates.  
Chose a voiceover style.  
Clicked generate.

**Thirty seconds later**:  
I had a short 3D video. Bold text. Realistic voiceover. Background FX. Music. Branding.

No timeline scrubbing. No After Effects. No scriptwriting.  
Just pure attention-grabbing content.

I sent it to the client.  
They were like, ‚ÄúThis is üî•. How much?‚Äù

I said $300.  
They didn‚Äôt blink.  
That‚Äôs when I knew ‚Äî **ClipsMate AI wasn‚Äôt just a shortcut‚Ä¶ it was an asset.**

# Why this tool works better than manual editing

Let‚Äôs face it:  
Most people scroll so fast they forget what they‚Äôve seen 2 seconds ago.  
So if you want content to work, it has to INTERRUPT that scroll.

ClipsMate AI is built around one thing:  
**Pattern Interrupt.**

That means every video template is designed to make people pause.  
And once they stop scrolling, your message lands.

It‚Äôs not about looking flashy ‚Äî it‚Äôs about creating a moment where the viewer *can‚Äôt help but watch.*

Here‚Äôs what makes it different from everything else I‚Äôve tried:

* **AI turns text, tweets, chats, or images into 3D animated videos.**
* **Built-in voiceovers, FX, subtitles, and layouts ‚Äî already done.**
* **Templates optimized for TikTok, IG Reels, Shorts, Facebook, etc.**
* **Full commercial license included. Sell these for $300+ easily.**

No monthly fees. No bloated learning curves.  
Just fast, client-ready content.

# Who this is perfect for:

1. **Freelancers / Side Hustlers** You can create short videos for clients in minutes. Charge $200‚Äì$500 each. Most small businesses *can‚Äôt* do this themselves.
2. **Content Creators / Influencers** Tired of videos dying in the feed? Use ClipsMate to make 3D versions that *stop the scroll*.
3. **Agencies** Plug this into your content offer stack. Cut production time by 90%. Upsell animated short-form content.
4. **Coaches / Course Creators / SaaS Founders** Turn testimonials, tips, or even tweets into high-converting micro-content that drives clicks and leads.

# The 3-Step Process That Takes 3 Minutes

**Step 1: Choose a Template**  
There are over 1,500+ templates (and growing).  
Just type your niche or video goal, and it finds a matching layout.

**Step 2: Customize**  
Add your text, voiceover style, colors, logos, music ‚Äî whatever you want.  
Drag-and-drop. No timeline. No headache.

**Step 3: Export & Post (or Sell It)**  
Export in HD. Sized for the platform you want.  
Then post it ‚Äî or hand it off to a client and collect your check.

# Real use cases I‚Äôve done so far:

* Turned a **motivational quote** into a 15-sec clip ‚Üí $250
* Converted a **real estate tip** into a Shorts-style video ‚Üí $300
* Took a **testimonial from a DM** and animated it into a branded reel ‚Üí $350
* Made a **listicle-style video** for an affiliate offer ‚Üí 2.7x more clicks than the static version

**Each video took under 10 minutes.**  
(Compare that to 2‚Äì4 hours editing manually.)

# But here‚Äôs the kicker...

This tool doesn‚Äôt just save time.  
It sells **attention.**

And attention is *everything* on social media right now.  
If your content isn‚Äôt standing out in the first 3 seconds, it‚Äôs invisible.

With ClipsMate AI, every clip I post looks like I hired a full team of animators and editors.

But it‚Äôs literally just me, a coffee, and a few clicks.

# And yes ‚Äî the Commercial License is INCLUDED

This is huge.

Most tools upsell you on the right to sell the content you create.  
ClipsMate gives it to you **up front**.

So you can:

* Start a video creation side hustle
* Add it as an agency service
* Offer it as an upsell for existing clients
* Flip TikTok-style content for ecom, coaches, local biz ‚Äî *everyone needs this stuff right now*

Even if you don‚Äôt want to sell services, you can use it to boost your own content and leads.

# What I love most:

* ‚úÖ Pattern Interrupt Engine = attention fast
* ‚úÖ AI does all the heavy lifting
* ‚úÖ Create once, sell unlimited
* ‚úÖ Works for ANY niche
* ‚úÖ No tech skills needed
* ‚úÖ No editing software required
* ‚úÖ Everything is cloud-based
* ‚úÖ No recurring fees (huge win)
* ‚úÖ Templates designed to convert
* ‚úÖ Full branding/customization options
* ‚úÖ Works on mobile or desktop

It‚Äôs like having a full video team in your pocket ‚Äî minus the cost.

# Final thoughts‚Ä¶

If you‚Äôre still grinding through timelines, splicing clips, and manually captioning videos ‚Äî  
you‚Äôre wasting time and money.

**ClipsMate AI** does in minutes what used to take hours ‚Äî  
and it *actually* gets results.

This is one of those rare tools that pays for itself fast‚Ä¶  
like after one client. Or one post that finally pops.

If you‚Äôre in content, marketing, freelancing, coaching ‚Äî  
this is a *massive* edge right now.

Someone I can tell all my good and bad to. Highs and lows.,"Basically what the title says, but I know I have to add a body so here goes the fun part. Talking about myself, I‚Äôm so good at that. 

I love games, chances are I do that on my days off. Been playing a bit of everything but got back on a Monster Hunter World binge after my Borderlands 3. But Stardew has also been calling my name hard so who knows what I‚Äôll stick with. 

Horror movies are jam, I could watch those over and over again. My favorite is this one called Grave Encounters cause I‚Äôm a sucker for found footage films. But all time favorite is Bullet Train, if I could watch that for the first time again I‚Äôd do that constantly. 

I listen to all forms of music, but country is a little iffy. I get dangerously close with certain folk and indie songs. Metal and punk rock are at the top of my list though. 

When I‚Äôm not at home though I like to take runs around the park or buying a coffee to read a book in the park. Even more so I‚Äôve been trying to find time to go to the aquarium or the zoo cause I love animals. Especially sea life. Space and the ocean fascinate me to a disgustingly lame degree. Anyway. 

If you wanna exchange pictures that‚Äôs fine with me. I‚Äôm fine never having to. Whatever your preference is. 

If you wanna talk I‚Äôll be here, and if not. I hope you have yourself a good night or morning. ",1,1748851776.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1l1cdvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1l1cdvm/dating_with_20_years_age_gap_shitstorms_from/,"Dating with 20 years age gap, shitstorms from friends","Hi guys, I try to be concise here. 

I'm a free lance self-employed (early 40's). A few days ago I went yo a friend's house, a guy I'm working with who is also free-lance. I know him and his wife really well. 

A woman was there. Younger than me (early 20's just below 25). I'm not chasing younger women. The woman is also free-lance and she seen my work and I have seen her work so we exchanged our Instagram planning to work together. 

Then, we started to talk about work. Little by little we started to talk about more personal stuffs. Not that any of us pushed it. It came naturally. 

Then a couple of days ago we decided to go for a coffee the next day (yesterday). 

I had a public work showcase and the free-lance guy I'm working with was doing one as well at the same event as me. She decided to come and see me for that work showcase before our coffee as we planned the coffee after that. 

Obviously the guy saw us leaving together. 

He then messaged her and delete his message on WhatsApp. She didn't had time to see the message. 

He followed by: ""I don't know if you have seen my previous message but anyway this is not my business. But I have to cancel next Wednesday meeting working with you for now."" 

She texted back asking if there was any issues, He replied by: ""No not all"".

A few minutes after his wife texted me saying: ""You cant date a person 20 years younger than you!""

Then, and other person we are all working with and wasn't even there or had anything yo do woth this situation, texted me a few minutes later : ""I'm not sure this  is a good idea for you and I'm concerned about you""

The girl I was dating is very professional and very driven and focus on her career. 

She was shocked by the text message of my friends and the guy she was supposed to work with. 

She told me that she doesn't want to work with him even if he apologized as she find that extremely controlling and out of place and she prefers that to happen now than in a few months when she will be more involved in work with him (She just started to work with him).

I feel a bit frustrated with my friends and peers! 

1. She is right, this behaviorist extremely controlling and misplaced. I know one of our peers who literally cheated on his wife, left her and treated her like shit, but really badly and went with the girl he cheated. Behaving badly to his ex wife who is a lovely woman. But for whatever reason that's acceptable. I don't judge and I dont care but if those people have to judge me, they should judge him as well I guess?!?

2. This is insulting for the woman I have been dating and me, saying: ""You guys don't know what you are doing, let me teach you!"" 
That woman is young but she runs a succesful business, she is independant, have a very strong will, she is very bright. And most of all I find her reaction to all that shitstorm a lot more mature than my friends. 

So the main argument with age gap dating is unbalanced power. Well that woman is far more mature than any people around me. She is driven and knows what she wants. 

She follows her red flags and is very determined. 

I never tried to control her. She never tried to control me. It jas been very respectful all the way. That shitstorm actually forced us to talk about what is happening and our age gap. It was a calm and balanced discussion. 

The couple who texted us, are married and have 11 years age gap. I know it is not 20 years. 

Now talking about controlling, if it was the other way around, and I was dating a woman 20 years older than me, would they react the same way? 

His text message to the woman I was dating:

Saying something and delete it, then follow that by a passive agressive comment, then canceling his work with her, clearly because of that and when she texted him nicely to ask if there is any issue, he replied by ""No everything is fine"" is for me far more controlling than the coffee that woman and I had yesterday. 

I decided to not respond to anyone yesterday and wait for my feelings to settle. 

But I will need to explain and clarify things.

At the same time, I didn't know if I should carry on seeing that girl. 

But I realise that life can end anytime for anyone. In a 100 years, it will be like we never existed as nobody will remember us at that time unless we are famous. 

So on one way, f**k them! 

Other way is I'm a bit scared with work and the impact that will have as I'm working with the guy a lot. 

I dont know what to do... What do you guys think?

So, let's talk about something that's been buzzing around everyone's mind lately: **Leveling up your AI skills before the robots take over your job!** üò± Sounds a bit dramatic, right? But really, as we plunge deeper into this tech-driven world, it‚Äôs more important than ever to adapt and grow. 

Just picture this: you‚Äôre chilling at home, and your favorite AI assistant is prepping dinner for you while you binge-watch the latest series. Sounds nice, but... what happens when AI gets better at your job than you? Suddenly, your morning coffee becomes a little less relaxing knowing that the robots might be eyeing your desk. ‚òïü§ñ

Here‚Äôs the good news: it‚Äôs not too late! You can totally *work smarter, not harder*. Here‚Äôs how to give those robots a run for their money: 

1. **Get Cozy with AI Tools:**
   - Explore platforms like ChatGPT, Copilot, or even Canva‚Äôs Magic Write. These gems can help churn out ideas or create content with a click‚Äîseriously, it‚Äôs like having a sidekick. 
   
2. **Learn to Leverage Data:** 
   - Grab those Google Analytics or social media insights! The ability to interpret data can give you an edge. Use it to create more relevant and targeted content. 

3. **Experiment with Automation:**
   - Automate repetitive tasks using tools like Zapier or IFTTT. Imagine freeing up hours just to dive into more creative work! üöÄ Anyone else in love with automating social posts?

4. **Stay Curious:**
   - Take online courses. There‚Äôs a treasure trove of resources out there, and I recently stumbled upon this amazing program to sharpen your AI skills. Check it out for yourself: [Imagine Education AI](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals). It‚Äôs a game-changer! üéì

5. **Connect with Peers:**
   - Join online communities or forums! You might find inspiration or even potential collaboration with like-minded folks who get it. Who doesn‚Äôt love chatting about AI over a virtual coffee break? ‚òïüí¨

6. **Practice, Practice, Practice:** 
   - Try out different tools and find out what suits you best. The more you play, the more you‚Äôll learn! And trust me, those skills will pay off. 

Remember the time you first learned to drive? It felt weird, but practice made you confident. The same goes for AI skills. 

Yeah, it feels a little intimidating, but guess what? The only thing standing between you and a future-proof career is a little curiosity and willingness to adapt. Just think of all the memes we can create with AI!

So, what are your thoughts? Are you all in for embracing AI? Or are there other tools you‚Äôve found invaluable? Let‚Äôs chat about how we‚Äôre leveling up our skills!

After proxying every class left I grab my friends, and decided to go play football. Yeah irresponsible but come on! You only live once.

After the intense games, whats better than going to the GHEXT Cafe. Good thing about campus (or patna in general), you‚Äôll get seemingly overpriced stuff at normal cheap rates. GHEXT cafe is conveniently placed between the CLH and Hostel, distracting us every time we walk back. Well, at least it gave us an excuse to skip mess ka lunch.

Then we headed over to SAC. There awaits my favourite room - The Music Room. What ensues next is hours and hours of playing, swapping instruments, laying in front of the ac and unwinding from the scorching summer heat.

I finish playing and start packing up my guitar when I see a group of people near the SAC area. One of my friends waves me over, and I just go without thinking. Turns out they‚Äôre about to fire up a student-built rocket propulsion system right there on the lawn. I‚Äôm like, ‚Äúdamn, lol,‚Äù watching smoke shoot out and feeling the ground vibrate.

These are the same kids who build weird stuff all the time, like those two human-sized basketball-playing robots for Robocon. They‚Äôve been to nationals every year, and this time IITP is one of only two IITs in the finals again. So here I am, fresh off a jam session, suddenly neck-deep in rocket tests and Robocon hype.

I grab a miserable, gross-tasting dinner and wolf it down because I‚Äôm starving. When I finally walk back to my room, I find my nerd roommates doing some circuit shit on gaming setups. Now insert 10 minutes of me convincing them to start gaming instead, and 60 minutes of us playing valorant.

Suddenly, it‚Äôs nearly midnight and a friend bursts in, shouting that it‚Äôs time for GPL‚Äîaka fucking that kid whose birthday it is. Before I can blink, we‚Äôre sneaking down the hall with foam bats and slippers and crashing his ass at ‚Äúthree‚Äîtwo‚Äîone‚Äù.

""You're pregnant.""","Chapter 1 His First Love Came Back  
""You're pregnant.""  
  
That single sentence kept repeating in Caitlin Hewitt's mind like a quiet hum she couldn't shut off. She sat frozen, staring blankly ahead as the soft sound of water running in the bathroom filled the room.  
  
Behind the frosted glass, Isaac Mason's tall frame moved in and out of view.  
  
She and Isaac had been married for two years, always careful, always using protection--except once.  
  
There was only one slip--after a business dinner, when Isaac came home drunk. It had happened just that one time, and now here she was, carrying a baby.  
  
The bathroom door creaked open, letting thick steam roll out into the bedroom. Isaac stepped out, water still clinging to his skin, a towel slung low around his waist. His toned body loomed over Caitlin, each step bringing him closer until his sculpted abs were just inches from her face.  
  
He leaned down, the scent of soap and heat wrapping around her, and slid a hand beneath the hem of her nightgown.  
  
Caitlin tensed. She caught his hand and held it firmly. Her eyes lowered, her voice soft and trembling. ""I... I don't want to.""  
  
There was still a flicker of heat in Isaac's gaze, but he pulled away without a word. He gave her a quick kiss, and then disappeared into the walk-in closet.  
  
Her thoughts tangled even more, spiraling in chaos.  
  
Everything between them had started with one reckless, wine-fueled night--her first time. Isaac had promised to make it up to her in some way, but back then, she hadn't taken his words seriously.  
  
Then, his grandfather had fallen seriously ill, and in a rush to fulfill the old man's wish, Isaac came to her with a proposal--not of love, but of convenience.  
  
Around that time, the Hewitt family's garment business had collapsed, dragging them into a pit of debt. Her mother struggled just to keep things going and ended up falling ill. They needed help badly.  
  
And Isaac... he was the man she'd secretly loved for years. So despite everything, she agreed to the unthinkable.  
  
They signed the prenup, filed the paperwork, and officially became husband and wife.  
  
There was no ceremony, no vows exchanged. And from the beginning, both had agreed--no kids.  
  
Just like that, two quiet, distant years went by.  
  
Never in a million years did Caitlin think she'd one day be carrying Isaac's baby.  
  
After mulling it over, she knew she couldn't keep it to herself. No matter what their marriage looked like, this child was theirs.  
  
Isaac was still in the closet when his phone, left carelessly on the bedside table, began to buzz.  
  
The name glowing on the screen made Caitlin's chest tighten--Emmalyn Rowe.  
  
The one woman Isaac had always loved... but never truly claimed.  
  
The closet door eased open, and Caitlin instinctively turned her face away, trying to hide the hurt in her eyes.  
  
Isaac stepped out in a fresh set of pajamas, his hair damp and slightly tousled. The soft lighting made his handsome features look even more unreal--almost dreamlike.  
  
He caught sight of her weary face and the quiet glisten of tears gathering in the corners of her eyes. Walking over, he gently cupped her cheek, his voice unusually soft. ""You don't look well. Want me to call the doctor?""  
  
Caitlin shook her head. She was about to speak, to finally say what had been weighing on her chest all day, but before a single word could escape, Isaac's phone buzzed again.  
  
He gave the screen a quick glance, and then, without a word, turned and walked out onto the balcony. The glass door slid shut behind him with a soft click, leaving Caitlin on the other side.  
  
A while later, he returned. This time, he didn't linger. He went straight back into the closet and came out wearing a crisp white shirt and tailored slacks.  
  
He was leaving. No doubt in her mind--he was going to see Emmalyn.  
  
Caitlin's heart sank. She couldn't stay quiet anymore. Watching him grab his car keys, she called out, ""Isaac... it's late. Do you really have to go now?""  
  
He turned around, a familiar smirk tugging at his lips. His deep-set eyes shimmered with quiet amusement. ""What? Don't you want me to leave?""  
  
That smile. It was the same one that used to make her heart flutter back in their younger days, when everything between them still felt new. That same crooked grin that made her fall harder, even now when she knew better.  
  
Her heart jumped, and she quickly chased after him. ""I... I have something important to tell you.""  
  
She wanted so badly to tell him that he was going to be a father. Maybe, just maybe, it would change something between them.  
  
But Isaac didn't stop long enough to listen. ""Let's talk tomorrow,"" he said casually, already turning away.  
  
Moments later, the sound of his car engine hummed up from downstairs, slowly fading into the night.  
  
Caitlin stood frozen for a long time before her lips parted and a whisper escaped. ""Okay.""  
  
No one answered her. Her voice disappeared into the silence, just like all the unspoken feelings she'd been holding inside for so long.  
  
That night, sleep refused to come. Caitlin lay in bed, eyes wide open, staring into the darkness. Then, sometime past midnight, her phone rang beside her pillow.  
  
It was her aunt, Phyllis Hewitt. ""Caitlin."" Her voice trembled on the other end. ""Your mom's condition has taken a turn. It's bad. The doctor says... she needs emergency surgery.""  
  
  
Chapter 2 Just A Habit  
Caitlin's exhaustion vanished in an instant. She bolted upright from the bed. ""I'll be there right away!""  
  
""Don't come just yet,"" Phyllis said gently. ""We still don't have a way to pay for the surgery.""  
  
Caitlin froze halfway through grabbing her coat. ""How much is it?""  
  
""Five hundred thousand, just for the operation. But with post-surgery care and medication... it'll be at least a million.""  
  
Her voice softened, laced with quiet desperation. ""Caitlin, we've already drained everything to pay off old debts. Why don't you ask Isaac? He's family, isn't he? He wouldn't ignore us.""  
  
""Alright. I'll figure it out.""  
  
As soon as the call ended, Caitlin immediately dialed Isaac.  
  
The call rang just once before it was declined.  
  
She redialed.  
  
While waiting, a news notification popped up on her screen.  
  
""Mason Group CEO Drops 10 Million on Luxurious Yacht for Actress Emmalyn Rowe's Birthday Bash.""  
  
The picture attached showed a gleaming, opulent yacht with Emmalyn's name elegantly carved into its side.  
  
As she scrolled further, her eyes landed on a photo--a tall, familiar figure with his arm loosely wrapped around a woman in a glittering gown. Even though their faces weren't fully shown, the closeness between them said it all.  
  
Caitlin stared blankly at the screen. So it was true. He really was with Emmalyn.  
  
Ten million--a sum that could have saved her mother's life--had been casually spent on a birthday gift.  
  
It wasn't until she had called him a thousand times that Isaac finally answered. His voice was clipped and impatient. ""What now?""  
  
Caitlin's mind spun with flashing images--his back turned coldly on her, his arm around Emmalyn, his distant eyes.  
  
Her lips parted, but she couldn't bring herself to mention her mother's condition. Instead, the words that came out were off-topic. ""Where are you?""  
  
There was a pause, and then his voice came back, more irritated than before. ""Where do you think? I'm in a meeting.""  
  
Liar. He wasn't in any meeting; he was celebrating with Emmalyn.  
  
At the thought of her mother fighting for her life, Caitlin swallowed her pride and forced herself to speak, tears stinging her eyes. Her voice was shaky, her throat tight. ""Isaac, my mom, she...""  
  
Before she could finish, he cut in. ""Caitlin, I'm busy. I don't have time for your drama.""  
  
And then--click. He hung up.  
  
The empty tone droned in her ear as she stared down at her phone, numb. Every part of it disgusted her.  
  
Isaac's lies. His relationship with Emmalyn. His indifference. But most of all, she hated herself--for still caring. For still reaching out. For still hoping.  
  
How could she be so blind for so long? How many times had he proven he didn't care, and how many more would it take? The bitter realization sank in as her stomach twisted.  
  
She stumbled into the bathroom and gripped the sink before vomiting violently. Tears spilled without permission, hot and fast, as the weight of everything crashed down.  
  
Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined sinking this low. Reduced to begging for kindness from someone who saw her as nothing more than an inconvenience. She felt like a stray--bruised, unwanted, scraping for crumbs while others feasted.  
  
Leaning against the sink for support, Caitlin stared at her reflection in the mirror.  
  
At twenty-six, she was still young. While she didn't possess the dazzling beauty of a movie star, there was a quiet, understated charm about her--something uniquely her own.  
  
Yet, the past two years had taken their toll. Her body had withered away, collarbones protruding sharply, her complexion ghostly, and the spark that once shone in her eyes was now gone.  
  
She wiped the fog from the mirror and whispered to herself, ""This wasn't how it was supposed to be...""  
  
Once upon a time, she had been a rising star in the design industry--brilliant, full of potential, and brimming with creative energy in everything she did.  
  
But she had sacrificed her dreams of becoming a successful designer, married Isaac, and settled into the role of a mere assistant beside him.  
  
For two years, she had clung to Isaac, living in a shadow of herself, with no dignity left to hold on to.  
  
Caitlin dropped her gaze and dialed Phyllis.  
  
""Aunt Phyllis, I have over a hundred thousand in my account. Use that for now. I'll find a way to cover the rest.""  
  
Caitlin stayed awake the entire night, going through her old possessions--college awards, magazines featuring her work, and certificates she had earned.  
  
At dawn, she arrived at Mason Group, exactly on time.  
  
Her role as an administrative assistant had been Isaac's idea, but all she ever did was deliver coffee and run errands. She was never included in anything important, never invited to meetings that mattered.  
  
Over time, people stopped noticing her altogether; she became just another invisible face in the office.  
  
When she first joined without going through the normal recruitment process, her sudden arrival had raised quite a few eyebrows. Rumors spread like wildfire. Some whispered that she'd used her looks to land the job, others claimed she was secretly related to the Mason family, and a few even speculated that she was some higher-up's mistress.  
  
But as time went on, and they saw her handling only menial tasks without a hint of anger, their disdain for her became more and more apparent.  
  
Robert Kirby, Isaac's personal assistant, was one of the offenders.  
  
After a meeting with Isaac, Robert tossed a file onto her desk with a smug look. ""Here's next month's project proposal. Take it to Mr. Mason for his signature.""  
  
Caitlin had grown used to it. Without a word, she took the file, her resignation weighing heavily on her, and made her way to Isaac's office.  
  
The door to Isaac's office was slightly ajar. Through the crack, Caitlin could make out two figures on the sofa, their voices carrying through the gap.  
  
Caitlin raised her hand to knock but froze when she heard her own name.  
  
""Isaac, tell me you're not falling for Caitlin?""  
  
It was Vernon Jenkins, Isaac's childhood friend.  
  
Isaac's voice followed, his tone dripping with derision. ""As if.""  
  
Vernon laughed. ""Then why haven't you just divorced her?""  
  
Isaac replied without a care, ""I'm used to the present way of life.""  
  
Caitlin's eyes flickered as she gripped the file in her hand, those words hitting her harder than she expected.  
  
He had never loved her. Two years of marriage, and to him, it was just a habit.  
  
Vernon pushed further. ""So when do you plan on divorcing Caitlin?""  
  
Isaac didn't hesitate. ""When the time's right, I'll do it.""  
  
Vernon's tone shifted, the amusement gone. ""Just letting you know--Emmalyn's not someone like Caitlin.""  
  
Isaac was clearly getting annoyed by how often Vernon brought her up. His voice turned sharp. ""Obviously they're different. What, you like Caitlin or something? I could help set it up.""  
  
Vernon let out a dry laugh. ""Nah, man. I'm not interested in someone you've already been with.""  
  
Tears pricked at Caitlin's eyes, her chest tightening painfully as if her heart was being squeezed.  
  
She couldn't stand there any longer. Quietly, she turned and started to walk away.  
  
But before she could take a step, the door opened wide suddenly. She hurried to wipe away the tears in her eyes.  
  
Standing there was Vernon, clearly shocked to see her. ""Caitlin?""  
  
  
Chapter 3 The Breaking Point  
Within a heartbeat, Caitlin composed herself, her face settling into its usual calm.  
  
She forced a polite, practiced smile and gave Vernon a slight nod. ""Mr. Jenkins, I'm just here to drop off a document for Mr. Mason.""  
  
Vernon blinked, momentarily caught off guard, and moved aside without a word.  
  
As she stepped into the room, her eyes briefly met Isaac's. The thick carpet muffled her footsteps as she approached.  
  
She avoided his gaze and held out the file with both hands. ""Mr. Mason, here's the proposal Robert wanted me to deliver. He asked you to sign it.""  
  
Her voice was clipped and distant, her posture straight and professional, as though she were speaking to a stranger, not her own husband.  
  
A strange irritation stirred in Isaac's chest, though he couldn't figure out the reason.  
  
Their marriage was nothing more than a secret, hollow agreement--no celebration, no vows, no real commitment.  
  
But whenever Caitlin slipped into her role too perfectly, acting like none of it mattered, it unsettled him. As if she didn't care.  
  
He took the document, gave it a quick glance, and signed it without hesitation. ""Thanks,"" he said simply.  
  
Caitlin accepted it and turned to leave, showing not the slightest hint of hesitation or regret.  
  
Once outside, she quietly placed the signed file on Robert's desk.  
  
Entering the break room, she reached for her phone and texted Phyllis, asking how her mother was doing.  
  
Phyllis replied, saying her mother's condition was stable that morning, but warned her to arrange payment soon--the hospital was pushing for it.  
  
Caitlin wiped away the sting in her eyes, took a shaky breath, and slipped her phone back into her pocket.  
  
A moment later, a few employees entered the break room chatting casually.  
  
They didn't see Caitlin tucked quietly in the corner and started talking without restraint.  
  
""Did you hear? Emmalyn's back! The superstar herself.""  
  
""That's old news! Mr. Mason gifted her a yacht, and he even named it after her.""  
  
""He totally spoils her.""  
  
""Obviously! She's from the influential Rowe family, and she and Mr. Mason practically grew up side by side. If she hadn't gone abroad for her career, they would've been married a long time ago.""  
  
""But what's going on with Mr. Mason and Caitlin then? Someone saw her stepping out of his car once. Rumor is she's trying to seduce him...""  
  
""Please. Have you ever seen Mr. Mason act like he actually likes her? Even if they did hook up, he's just messing around. Now that his real girlfriend's back, Caitlin's out of the picture.""  
  
""She needs a reality check. Who does she think she is, acting like she suddenly matters?""  
  
...  
  
The coffee in Caitlin's hand had gone cold, and her palm felt chilled.  
  
Just then, the woman who had been the most sarcastic finally noticed Caitlin sitting quietly in the corner.  
  
""Well, well, look who's been eavesdropping. Ms. Hewitt herself!""  
  
Caitlin knew the voice. It was Leanne Barnett from HR, a known Emmalyn fanatic.  
  
Honestly, most of what Caitlin had ever heard about Isaac and Emmalyn's history had come straight from Leanne's endless gossiping.  
  
But she had no interest in hearing more. She stood quietly, picked up her cup, and turned to leave.  
  
Leanne, however, wasn't finished. She stepped in Caitlin's way, smirking. ""What's wrong? Can't handle the truth? When Emmalyn marries Mr. Mason, are you going to wish the ground would just open up and swallow you?""  
  
Caitlin stayed silent, but Leanne's taunts only escalated. ""Oh, I see what's going on. You're just here to be some rich man's toy. If it's not Mr. Mason, maybe one of the other older executives at Mason Group? Is that your type?""  
  
Caitlin turned slowly, her eyes like ice. ""Leanne. You'd better watch what you say.""  
  
Caitlin hardly ever raised her voice, but in that moment, something about her presence was enough to make the air feel heavier.  
  
Leanne laughed and looked around at the others. ""See that? She's getting all defensive now. I must've hit a nerve. Bet she's already looking for her next sugar daddy...""  
  
Before she could finish, Caitlin's hand flew up and landed a hard slap across her face.  
  
The crack echoed through the room as Leanne's head jerked to the side, a bright red handprint blooming on her cheek. She turned back slowly, eyes wide in shock. ""Did you just hit me?""  
  
  
Chapter 4 I Want A Divorce  
Caitlin's face was cold and unreadable. ""Yeah, I slapped you! If your parents skipped the manners talk, I'll give you one myself!""  
  
The entire room fell into stunned silence. No one moved. No one even breathed.  
  
The Caitlin standing before them didn't match the woman they thought they knew. Where was the quiet, timid assistant? This Caitlin had fire in her eyes and steel in her voice.  
  
Leanne scanned the room, hoping someone would come to her defense. But all she saw were blank stares and curious eyes. No one looked concerned. No one spoke up. The realization hit her hard--she was on her own, humiliated and ignored, her pride crumbling in front of everyone.  
  
Refusing to back down, she lifted her hand, aiming to return the slap.  
  
But Caitlin, tall and balanced without the need for stilettos, casually sidestepped. Leanne's heel caught awkwardly on the floor, and in a split second, she crashed to the floor, face-first.  
  
The sharp pain shot up her leg, and humiliation burned hotter than the sting on her knees. Fighting back tears, she snapped, ""Caitlin Hewitt, you slut! Don't act all high and mighty. I saw your r√©sum√© when you joined the company--you seduced someone to get in! Everyone knows! You were assigned an easy role because someone felt sorry for you. You're nothing but a gold-digger!""  
  
Caitlin marched over, grabbed Leanne's collar, and raised her hand--ready to silence her once and for all.  
  
But just as her hand was about to land, someone caught her wrist in midair.  
  
The grip was firm, the fingers long and toned, and a sleek designer watch glinted beneath the light.  
  
Her eyes followed the arm and locked onto Isaac's stormy glare.  
  
""Are you not done creating a scene?"" he asked sharply.  
  
As soon as Isaac stepped in, the air went still.  
  
Pain shot through Caitlin's wrist from how tightly he was holding her, and a mix of sadness and frustration rose in her chest, making her eyes sting. She bit the inside of her cheek to stop the tears.  
  
Leanne, meanwhile, had already jumped to her feet. Sensing a chance to turn things in her favor, she pointed at Caitlin with trembling anger. ""Mr. Mason, Caitlin's been throwing her weight around just because she's your assistant! We were only praising Miss Rowe a little, and she lashed out at me for no reason!""  
  
Not only did she act like the victim, but she even dragged Emmalyn's name into the drama.  
  
Isaac's eyes swept across the room, his face calm but ice-cold. The pressure in the air was suffocating.  
  
Leanne gave a pleading look to the people nearby--and it worked. ""Caitlin started it,"" someone mumbled.  
  
Then came Isaac's verdict. ""Caitlin, apologize.""  
  
Caitlin's heart dropped. He didn't even ask what happened. He'd already chosen sides.  
  
Leanne, catching the way Caitlin had gone silent, raised her voice deliberately. ""Mr. Mason, she's not even apologizing. Is she questioning your authority?""  
  
Isaac's voice dropped a degree colder. ""Caitlin. Apologize. Now.""  
  
The sound of her heart breaking was almost audible to Caitlin. Her pride twisted painfully inside her chest. All she could focus on was Isaac's expressionless face and the sharpness in his voice.  
  
She clenched her fist so tight her nails bit into her skin--anything to keep the tears from spilling.  
  
The inside of her cheek bled from how hard she bit it, but she still held her head up and muttered, ""I'm sorry.""  
  
Deep down, she blamed herself; loving Isaac was a mistake.  
  
She didn't look back. She just turned and walked straight out of the break room.  
  
""Robert, let her know she's not to report in tomorrow,"" Isaac said flatly.  
  
Then he left, heading back to his office, haunted by the look in Caitlin's eyes--one that burned far deeper than anger.  
  
Leanne stood frozen, stunned by what just happened. She turned toward Robert, confused. ""Wait... Mr. Mason was referring to Caitlin, wasn't he?""  
  
Robert shot her a flat look. ""Ms. Barnett, you'll need to handle the severance procedure.""  
  
Caitlin might not have been loved, but she still had a title--Isaac's wife.  
  
By embarrassing Caitlin in front of others, Leanne had unknowingly insulted Isaac as well.  
  
Knowing Isaac's temper, there was no way he would let something like that slide.  
  
When Caitlin got back to her desk, she saw that several of the emails she had sent earlier had already received responses.  
  
The design firms she had reached out to were open to hiring new designers. In short, they were impressed with her r√©sum√© and wanted to set up interviews.  
  
As she scrolled through the replies, a bit of the heaviness in her chest began to ease. The positive responses gave her a small sense of hope.  
  
On the other hand, Isaac walked into his office and pressed his fingers against his forehead, clearly worn out.  
  
Robert came in behind him, placing a pile of reports neatly on the desk. After a short pause, he finally said, ""Mr. Mason, I heard that Caitlin's mother is in critical condition and the surgery costs around a million.""  
  
Isaac was about to sign a document, but his hand stopped mid-air. ""When did this happen?"" he asked.  
  
""Last night,"" Robert answered.  
  
Isaac flung the pen onto the desk, a flicker of frustration passing over his face.  
  
Why didn't Caitlin just come to him about it? Did she really expect him to read her mind about something this serious?  
  
He had enough on his plate--he didn't need to deal with emotional mind games on top of it all.  
  
Robert watched him closely, and then cautiously asked, ""Mr. Mason?""  
  
Isaac grabbed another pen and started signing again, his face giving nothing away. ""Send the money from my personal account to hers.""  
  
When work wrapped up, Isaac took the private elevator down to the second basement and slid into his sleek black Maybach.  
  
He waited for ten minutes, but Caitlin was nowhere to be seen.  
  
He set aside his newspaper, glanced at the time, and called Robert. ""Let Caitlin know I'm waiting.""  
  
""Mr. Mason, she left a while ago,"" Robert answered, unaware she had skipped the usual ride.  
  
Isaac ended the call and instructed the driver to leave.  
  
By the time he reached their villa, the lights upstairs were already lit.  
  
He headed directly upstairs and pushed open the door to the master bedroom.  
  
There, in the center of the room, stood two suitcases--one zipped up tightly, the other still being filled. Caitlin was calmly folding her clothes into it.  
  
Isaac tugged at his tie and sank into the nearby sofa. ""What are you doing?"" he asked, brows furrowed.  
  
Caitlin kept moving around the room--not cleaning, not organizing, but packing steadily like someone ready to leave and not come back.  
  
He assumed she was acting out and couldn't help the annoyance that began to rise.  
  
He hadn't even mentioned how she walked out of work unannounced, and yet here she was acting like the wronged one.  
  
""I heard about your mother. The money's already been wired to your account,"" he said casually.  
  
His tone was indifferent, like he was tossing some spare change to someone on the street.  
  
Caitlin, however, didn't respond. She didn't even look his way.  
  
Isaac's patience wore thinner. ""If a million isn't enough, just say it. I'll give you more. But stop using this as an excuse to storm back to your mother's home!""  
  
Caitlin zipped up the second suitcase and finally lifted her gaze to meet his.  
  
Her voice was steady and quiet. ""Isaac, I want a divorce.""  
  
Isaac sat there, completely caught off guard.  
  
Caitlin had never spoken to him like this before--not even close.  
  
It had been two full years since they agreed to that prenup, and now they had already got used to each other's presence. Not once had she whined or brought up divorce.  
  
To him, this was just Caitlin lashing out, saying things she didn't mean.  
  
He leaned back comfortably, one leg resting on the other, and said coolly, ""Caitlin, we both know the prenup leaves you with zero if we split. Your mom still needs help, and the Hewitt family's depending on you. How exactly do you plan to manage without being Mrs. Mason? Or is this your way of pressuring me--for more cash?""  
  
He smirked, his voice soaked in mockery.  
  
Caitlin was shaking with fury, her eyes watery as she snapped through clenched teeth, ""I'm already job hunting. I'm done taking your filthy money!""  
  
Isaac's expression shifted. ""Do you even understand what it means to leave with absolutely nothing?""  
  
""I do!"" she burst out, unable to hold it in any longer. She gestured toward the house around them. ""None of this matters. It's not like you've ever treated me like your wife. Yeah, you hand me money every month... but only after you've slept with me. Do you even realize what that feels like? It makes me feel cheap... like I'm just some call girl you pay afterward, not your wife. Like I'm nothing.""  
  
Finally, the tears spilled over.  
  
Isaac's expression hardened, his whole face turning cold and dangerous.  
  
""A call girl, huh?"" he repeated, his voice low and chilling.  
  
  
Chapter 5 Caitlin, We Are Married  
Isaac got to his feet and moved toward Caitlin, towering over her. ""Caitlin, you really think too much of yourself. A call girl knows exactly how to satisfy a man, something you clearly don't.""  
  
Her tear-streaked face was irritating to him, and her pale complexion only made him more furious. He reached out, his hand snaking toward her.  
  
Caitlin stubbornly turned her head, taking a small step back.  
  
A dark look crossed Isaac's face as his arm wrapped around her waist and pulled her close. His fingers roughly wiped away her tears, his voice low and threatening, like a whispered curse. ""You just blush and hide in my arms after we share intimacy; you don't even know how to respond, how to enjoy it. After we're divorced, do you honestly think any man would want someone as clueless as you? Behave yourself, and you'll still be my wife, understand?""  
  
Caitlin pushed his hand off and struggled to free herself. ""I... I don't want to be your wife anymore. Let's just get divorced.""  
  
She had loved Isaac for a decade, but now, it was done.  
  
If Emmalyn hadn't come between them, if he hadn't been so indifferent and cruel, if there hadn't been so much distance and miscommunication, maybe she could've fooled herself into staying in this marriage.  
  
But not anymore. She saw everything clearly now. No matter how hard she tried, it was just lying to herself.  
  
Even though life after divorce might be difficult, she had made up her mind. She would no longer be a prisoner in this relationship.  
  
Isaac's anger flared as he gripped her tighter, not letting go. ""So now being my wife isn't enough? Isn't this what you worked so hard for?""  
  
Caitlin was shocked. ""What are you talking about?""  
  
Isaac grabbed her chin, making her look up at him. He shoved his leg between hers, trapping her against the table behind her.  
  
His breath came hot and heavy against her skin, his lips grazing the sensitive curve of her neck as he spoke slowly. ""How exactly did you end up in my room that night you were drunk?""  
  
Each word he spoke was like a kiss on her neck, but Caitlin could feel her heart breaking at the implications of his words.  
  
""The Hewitt family was drowning in debt, and you were desperate for money. When I offered to make it up to you after that night, you didn't turn it down. Later, when I suggested a prenup and helped clear the Hewitt debts, you agreed without a second thought.""  
  
Caitlin's body shook, and she nearly broke down in tears.  
  
After all this time, he still didn't trust her.  
  
It was her first time having sex with a man. Why would she sacrifice her own purity to manipulate someone?  
  
As she remained silent, Isaac's hand slipped under her blouse, his touch firm, invasive and unyielding as he demanded, ""Why are you so quiet? Is this your way of admitting it?"" he demanded.  
  
Her skin beneath his palm was warm and soft, carrying a natural scent--not the overpowering sweetness of perfume, but the subtle, irresistible allure of a woman who knew herself.  
  
Soon, her skin turned a soft pink from his touch, and her eyes, filled with tears, glimmered like stars, refusing to fall.  
  
As her clothes became messy, her body was partly exposed before him, stirring an urge in him that was hard to control.  
  
Isaac had always known Caitlin was beautiful--so beautiful that it drove him wild.  
  
He lowered his face, gently cupping her cheeks before kissing her, their breaths intertwining in the intensity of the moment. As he drew closer, his intentions were clear.  
  
Caitlin stood there, helpless, a soft, high whimper slipping from her lips, almost like the frightened sound of a kitten.  
  
Isaac seemed to relish the soft sound, moving his lips from hers to kiss down her delicate neck and smooth chest.  
  
Caitlin's heart raced as she realized how exposed she was. Her hands instinctively pushed against his chest, attempting to create space.  
  
""You... let me go... we can't..."" she murmured, but her hands were caught, pinned above her head as Isaac pressed their bodies even closer.  
  
His lips stayed on hers, unwavering. ""Can't what? Can't do this?"" he whispered. He lightly nipped at her swollen lips, his voice playful. ""Caitlin, we're married. Why can't we?""  
  
Tears began to form in the corners of her eyes, but Isaac showed no sign of stopping.  
  
He was completely lost in her--her flowing hair, her smooth, delicate skin, and, most of all, the way she looked when she was caught between wanting to resist and yet being unable to. Every inch of him longed to have her in that moment.  
  
At last, Caitlin heard the sound of a zipper being pulled down, sending a shiver down her spine.  
  
Her hands pressed against his chest, her breath becoming shallow and rapid. ""We can't. We're out of condoms...""  
  
Her words made Isaac pause, the reality of the situation settling in.  
  
Without protection, there was the risk of pregnancy. Despite his overwhelming desire, he wasn't blinded enough to disregard that.  
  
After all, he wasn't ready for a child--not at this moment, anyway.

I'm a free lance self-employed (early 40's). A few days ago I went yo a friend's house, a guy I'm working with who is also free-lance. I know him and his wife really well. 

A woman was there. Younger than me (early 20's just below 25). I'm not chasing younger women. The woman is also free-lance and she seen my work and I have seen her work so we exchanged our Instagram planning to work together. 

Then, we started to talk about work. Little by little we started to talk about more personal stuffs. Not that any of us pushed it. It came naturally. 

Then a couple of days ago we decided to go for a coffee the next day (yesterday). 

I had a public work showcase and the free-lance guy I'm working with was doing one as well at the same event as me. She decided to come and see me for that work showcase before our coffee as we planned the coffee after that. 

Obviously the guy saw us leaving together. 

He then messaged her and delete his message on WhatsApp. She didn't had time to see the message. 

He followed by: ""I don't know if you have seen my previous message but anyway this is not my business. But I have to cancel next Wednesday meeting working with you for now."" 

She texted back asking if there was any issues, He replied by: ""No not all"".

A few minutes after his wife texted me saying: ""You cant date a person 20 years younger than you!""

Then, and other person we are all working with and wasn't even there or had anything yo do woth this situation, texted me a few minutes later : ""I'm not sure this  is a good idea for you and I'm concerned about you""

The girl I was dating is very professional and very driven and focus on her career. 

She was shocked by the text message of my friends and the guy she was supposed to work with. 

She told me that she doesn't want to work with him even if he apologized as she find that extremely controlling and out of place and she prefers that to happen now than in a few months when she will be more involved in work with him (She just started to work with him).

I feel a bit frustrated with my friends and peers! 

1. She is right, this behaviorist extremely controlling and misplaced. I know one of our peers who literally cheated on his wife, left her and treated her like shit, but really badly and went with the girl he cheated. Behaving badly to his ex wife who is a lovely woman. But for whatever reason that's acceptable. I don't judge and I dont care but if those people have to judge me, they should judge him as well I guess?!?

2. This is insulting for the woman I have been dating and me, saying: ""You guys don't know what you are doing, let me teach you!"" 
That woman is young but she runs a succesful business, she is independant, have a very strong will, she is very bright. And most of all I find her reaction to all that shitstorm a lot more mature than my friends. 

So the main argument with age gap dating is unbalanced power. Well that woman is far more mature than any people around me. She is driven and knows what she wants. 

She follows her red flags and is very determined. 

I never tried to control her. She never tried to control me. It jas been very respectful all the way. That shitstorm actually forced us to talk about what is happening and our age gap. It was a calm and balanced discussion. 

The couple who texted us, are married and have 11 years age gap. I know it is not 20 years. 

Now talking about controlling, if it was the other way around, and I was dating a woman 20 years older than me, would they react the same way? 

His text message to the woman I was dating:

Saying something and delete it, then follow that by a passive agressive comment, then canceling his work with her, clearly because of that and when she texted him nicely to ask if there is any issue, he replied by ""No everything is fine"" is for me far more controlling than the coffee that woman and I had yesterday. 

I decided to not respond to anyone yesterday and wait for my feelings to settle. 

But I will need to explain and clarify things.

At the same time, I didn't know if I should carry on seeing that girl. 

But I realise that life can end anytime for anyone. In a 100 years, it will be like we never existed as nobody will remember us at that time unless we are famous. 

So on one way, f**k them! 

Other way is I'm a bit scared with work and the impact that will have as I'm working with the guy a lot. 

I dont know what to do... What do you guys think?

You know that friend who's always taking courses, reading business books, watching ""how to get rich"" videos on TikTok? Yeah, that was me for like 3 years straight.

I had notebooks full of ""strategies"" and my browser had 73 tabs open with different side hustle ideas. I could tell you everything about dropshipping, affiliate marketing, day trading, you name it. But my bank account? Still looking sad.

Then I met this 19-year-old kid at a coffee shop who was making more in a month than I made in six months. I'm thinking he's got some secret sauce, right? 

Nope. Dude literally said: ""I watched one YouTube video about flipping sneakers, bought my first pair the same day, and just figured it out as I went.""

That hit different.

I realized I'd been treating learning like a video game - collecting knowledge points instead of actually playing the real game. Every time I was about to start something, I'd think ""but wait, let me just research this one more thing first.""

Sound familiar?

Here's the brutal truth: You already know enough to start. That business idea you've been ""researching"" for months? Someone with half your knowledge is already doing it and making money.

The difference between people who make it and people who don't isn't intelligence. It's willingness to look stupid while they figure it out.

Stop collecting courses like Pok√©mon cards. Pick one thing. Start today. Be bad at it. Get better by doing, not by learning about doing.

Your wallet will thank you.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress - it strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.** ¬†I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do.

* Iron clothes when they are slightly damp for easier results  
* Use **steam settings** for thick fabrics or tough wrinkles  
* Never leave the iron in one spot‚Äîthis can scorch the fabric  
* Use a **clean ironing board cover** to avoid staining clothes

1l1bdr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/1l1bdr9/your_views_on_nudistnudity/,Your views on nudist/nudity,"I never considered myself a nudist but over the yrs I have gone from sleeping naked to making my morning coffee nude and skinny dipping when out tramping/camping. I now almost never have clothes on at home when it is warm enough. This last summer I found myself and nude beach days and nudist clubs. I guess this makes me a nudist? 

My questions are, do you spend time at home nude? Do you think nudist are strange? When you seen nude people at the beach do you find it offensive? If you where with a group of friends camping or at the beach would you be comfortable with one or more being nude? Can you separate nudity and sex in your mind?
Any other comments of interest? 

Happy to answer questions if you are interested in what nudist events or clubs like. 

For context most of the time I am at the beach club or event with my wife. We are in our 30s. ",39,1748847494.0,newzealand,67,0.72,False

Just wish she would‚Äôve got to live to see a few more.

Characters Anna, Sarah‚Äôs mom, Noah, Kenzie‚Äôs boyfriend, Kenzie, Sarah‚Äôs best friend, Maddie, Kenzie, and Sarah‚Äôs best friend Dexter, the police officer


Chapter 1: Saturday Morning Shock
Here's how that Saturday morning really went down: Kenzie and I walked into the gas station. My heart sank when I saw Noah and Maddie kissing. Kenzie exploded, yelling and throwing a coffee at Noah. We stormed out of there, leaving them in the dust.



Chapter 2: The Unexplained Encounter
Later, Noah found a way to talk to me. He explained everything, how Maddie had manipulated him, how he was caught completely off guard by the kiss, and that it wasn't what it seemed. He laid out details that made it clear Noah was innocent. He was just a pawn in Maddie's games.




Chapter 3: A Deeper Secret Revealed
In telling me the truth, Noah inadvertently revealed a deeper secret. Because of what Noah told me, I realized something far more sinister was at play. I understood the full extent of Maddie's deception and, more chillingly, Dexter's involvement in something that went way beyond a simple affair. I knew too much. And because I knew the truth, Dexter killed me. As a police officer, he had the perfect cover-up. No one would suspect him.


Chapter 4: Hope's Tragic Connection
And no one did suspect him until Hope knew everything but she didn‚Äôt wanna believe it. Hope loved the back stories so sad. She grew up poor without a mother father very disturbed live in an orphanage all of our life foster home to foster home till she turned 13 was adopted by Lily and James. They were the only thing she had. They were the closest thing she had to mother and father. She was a baby when her mother and father died, so she always found comfort in Dexter in high school. They were both very smart, graduated at a young age. They are planning to just be the perfect couple to make up for all the years that were perfect, but Dexter knew Hope knew and he had no choice. My death was a sad story. Hope's life was just down down and then up.



Chapter 5: Unraveling the Truth
Then Noah and Kenzie put all their pieces together. They found my diary. The last time I wrote it was Saturday morning before I was dead. I knew I was going to die. I wrote letters and I said that I love them and I told them who it was, how it happened, because Dexter wanted to plan out this way. He made me write and write so that there‚Äôd still be a piece of me with Kenzie and Noah so they‚Äôd always feel like that they could‚Äôve saved me. I love you, Kenzie, and I just wish it didn‚Äôt have to end like this, but Noah and Kenzie were back together. Maddie and Dexter were both in jail. I was dead, but let it be known Saturday will never be the same again.

""Ladies and gentlemen, Flight 2331 has landed safely..."" The announcement from the speaker caused a collective sigh of relief throughout the cabin.  
  
The oxygen masks that had fallen and the faint smell of blood in the air were clear signs of the earlier danger.  
  
Standing at the door, seeing off the last passenger, Rosalie Flynn straightened her back, feeling a dull ache in her muscles. Her pale face showed signs of exhaustion.  
  
The wound on her left arm had stopped bleeding, but the lingering smell of antiseptic spray was hardly pleasant.  
  
The other crew members were busy on their phones, calling their families to let them know they were safe, their voices trembling with a mix of joy and tears after surviving such a close call.  
  
But Rosalie, hearing the repeated ""The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable"" from her phone, felt a chill creeping into her heart.  
  
In the rush of the emergency, the tower had urgently contacted the crew's families, and everyone else had been informed, except her...  
  
""Rosalie, why hasn't your husband come to pick you up? Didn't they notify the family members?""  
  
At that moment, her colleague Katy Pittman squeezed over, holding her boyfriend's hand. The tall man was drenched in cold sweat, still clearly shaken by the ordeal.  
  
""He must be busy,"" Rosalie replied with a self-deprecating smile, forcing her lips into a thin line.  
  
After all, he never allowed her to reveal their relationship at work.  
  
And no one knew that Nathaniel Drake, the high-ranking and untouchable figure, had been her husband for three years.  
  
She had turned down many suitors, presenting herself as a married woman.  
  
And yet, to everyone else, Nathaniel was still the eligible bachelor.  
  
Katy said, ""Busy? But there are more important things than this? We almost lost our lives just now!""  
  
Katy rolled her eyes and was about to say something more, but her boyfriend pulled her arm, stopping her.  
  
She sighed, closed her mouth, and muttered a few pleasantries before insisting she'd take Rosalie to get her wound treated.  
  
Rosalie followed her lead without resistance, her heart numb with an icy chill.  
  
""Look! Mr. Drake!"" Suddenly, a startled voice broke her thoughts.  
  
Instinctively, Rosalie raised her eyes.  
  
Not far away, the senior executives of Grigow Airlines were walking toward them, chatting amongst themselves. Among them, one man stood out with his straight posture, exuding an imposing presence that made him impossible to ignore.  
  
His handsome and deep-set features exuded a cold, aloof aura in the shifting light, an air that made others hesitant to approach.  
  
The crowd around her started to murmur.  
  
""He's so handsome.""  
  
""Who's the beauty beside Mr. Drake? She's so cool.""  
  
""That's the new senior engineer, Leonor Wells. I heard she and Mr. Drake go way back. He spent the whole morning with her, didn't even take a call while she was around.""  
  
""Engineer and captain‚Äîwhat a perfect match. Look how gently Mr. Drake smiles at her! I'm so jealous.""  
  
Amid the murmurs, Rosalie's gaze shifted toward Nathaniel.  
  
When she saw the face she knew all too well, her fingers clenched tightly, her knuckles turning white.  
  
''So, he was busy accompanying his first love.  
  
Recently, Leonor Wells had mentioned returning to her home country and joining Grigow Airlines. It was clearly a challenge, an open provocation.  
  
Just like the last time they met, when she had said those words. ""You took something from me, but sooner or later, I'll take it back. Do you believe me?""  
  
Since childhood, Rosalie had never beaten Leonor, so those words felt like a curse, tormenting her day and night.  
  
When she heard that Leonor was joining Grigow Airlines, Rosalie had told Nathaniel that he would only side with either her or Leonor.  
  
But clearly, Nathaniel hadn't taken her words seriously. Or perhaps, this was his answer.  
  
Once again, Leonor had won.  
  
Memories from the past tore at her mind, and the pain buried in time was slowly uncovered.  
  
Rosalie watched Nathaniel speak, his head slightly lowered, and the soft curve of his lips forming a gentle smile.  
  
She had once wondered what it would look like if Nathaniel were to love someone... But seeing it with her own eyes now, her heart, numb from the pain, could only feel a sense of resignation.  
  
Perhaps she should have died in this plane crash.  
  
But if Rosalie died, no one would ever know the hatred inside her.  
  
The one who had wronged the Flynn family, the one who had harmed her and her mother, would continue to live their lives unscathed.  
  
And perhaps, she would even sleep with Rosalie's husband, enjoying what was once hers.  
  
The emotions were too much to bear. Rosalie dropped her suitcase and was about to charge forward, but Katy grabbed her arm tightly.  
  
""Rosalie, what are you doing? Even though Mr. Drake's sudden shift in work today had something to do with this incident, he's not someone you should provoke. Don't go looking for trouble,"" Katy said.



**Chapter 2 The Widow**



Another colleague nearby overheard the conversation and chimed in.  
  
""Yeah, small fry like us have no right to stir up trouble. The company's giving us the day off today, so let's not cause any issues. Your husband's probably waiting for you, just go home and reunite with him.""  
  
Rosalie snapped out of her daze at that moment.  
  
She knew that even if she rushed over now, with Nathaniel's methods, she would only end up humiliated in the end.  
  
*But... husband?* She found it extremely laughable.  
  
Her husband was now off, flirting with her rival, Leonor.  
  
*One stupid and heartless, the other despicable and shameless‚Äîthey really are a perfect match.*  
  
""I was impulsive earlier, but the truth is... my husband has been dead for three years. I've been a widow for that long, and I should've told everyone earlier, but I didn't. So, please, just don't mention it again.""  
  
Her calm voice stunned the group, silencing them. It even caught the attention of the Grigow Airlines executives preparing to board.  
  
A few pairs of eyes swept toward her, and Nathaniel's icy gaze bore into her with clear warning.  
  
Rosalie ignored it, forced a bitter smile, and without tending to her wound, grabbed her suitcase and left.  
  
\*\*\*\*\*  
  
In Lotuswood Estate, Rosalie calmly took a shower and treated her wound before sitting at her vanity, staring at the wedding ring on her finger.  
  
The warmth of his touch when he slid the ring onto her finger still lingers, but that moment has turned into a thorn in her heart‚Äîaching and unyielding, a constant reminder of her misplaced devotion.  
  
With a sigh, she almost used all her strength to remove the ring, rubbing her finger raw before casually tossing it into the jewelry box.  
  
\*\*\*\*\*  
  
At half past ten at night, Nathaniel returned to Lotuswood Estate.  
  
In the bag he was holding was the latest designer purse, one Rosalie had glanced at on her computer the other day.  
  
He had only found out today, after finishing up some engineering work, that Rosalie had been on that flight‚Äîthe one that had almost ended in disaster.   
  
Thankfully, it had landed safely in the end.  
  
He suddenly remembered the look she had given him earlier. He had assumed it was for Leonor, but now, he wondered if it was because of this very situation.  
  
Luckily, Rosalie was usually easy to soothe.  
  
As Nathaniel entered the house, he noticed the glaring lights that illuminated the otherwise quiet room. Rosalie wasn't anywhere to be seen.  
  
Frowning, Nathaniel glanced toward the dining area, but it was empty.  
  
Normally, when Nathaniel came home late, Rosalie would have hot food waiting for him. Even if he had already eaten, she'd insist on making him another bowl of soup for his stomach.  
  
*Is she giving me the cold shoulder?*  
  
For reasons he couldn't explain, Nathaniel didn't want to indulge her.  
  
Suppressing his growing irritation, Nathaniel tossed the bag onto the table and headed straight for his study.  
  
By the time he finished checking his emails, it was nearly midnight.  
  
But there was still no knock on his door. No coffee. No milk. Not even a glass of water.  
  
Though Nathaniel usually found these gestures irritating, now that they were gone, he couldn't quite shake the feeling of unease.  
  
He pressed his lips together and stood up, walking out into the hallway. After a shower, he opened the bedroom door.  
  
The room was dark, bathed only in the soft moonlight that illuminated the bed, where a small bulge suggested someone was lying down.  
  
Rosalie wasn't asleep. She felt the familiar presence beside her, and without a word, she shifted closer to him. Her small hand slid effortlessly under his blue silk pajamas.  
  
Nathaniel shouted, ""Rosalie, what are you doing?""  
  
Before he could react, Nathaniel's hand gripped her wrist tightly, and the pain from the wound on his arm made him flinch.  
  
Rosalie let out a muffled groan, but her smile grew more seductive.  
  
Her smooth legs slipped up and wrapped around his waist, feeling his breath quicken. She wore a look of triumph as she savored the growing tension in the air.  
  
Then, in an instant, Nathaniel yanked her legs apart with a firm grip.  
  
His voice was dark and tense, his patience clearly wearing thin. ""What do you think you're doing?""  
  
Rosalie giggled softly.  
  
""Isn't it obvious? I'm seducing you. We've gone this far. Don't tell me you're not going to do anything. Eldon's been pushing me to have a child every day. Do you think I can reproduce without sex?""  
  
Nathaniel said, ""Have you no shame?""  
  
Nathaniel's voice was cold as ice, his gaze sharp as a blade, as though he wanted to punish her for every word she'd spoken.  
  
The irony was, it sounded as if he had never done this before.  
  
While he had never been particularly eager, Nathaniel had always held her waist, as if he wanted to kill her with desire. But today, he was determined to remain faithful to his ""first love.""



**Chapter 3 Utterly Exhausting**



Rosalie let out a cold laugh, sitting up with all traces of allure wiped from her face. Her tone was sharp, ice-cold.  
  
""If you can't satisfy me in bed, let's try another way. I want to be Grigow Airlines' Executive Director. Make it happen. Otherwise, this charade is over. And by the way, I'll stop covering for your *infertility.* Your call.""  
  
Nathaniel stared at her as if she were out of her mind. ""Are you delusional?""  
  
Even though she'd prepared herself for such a response, the words still hit her like a sledgehammer.  
  
After a pause, Rosalie let out a soft, almost imperceptible chuckle.  
  
""When Leonor came back, you handed her the position of Senior Engineer without a second thought. Yet I ask for a measly Executive Director title, and you can't make that happen? Tell me, Nathaniel, who's really your woman here?""  
  
Before she could finish, Nathaniel's hand gripped her chin with startling force.  
  
""Is this what this is about?"" His voice was cold, dripping with disdain. ""Do you have any self-awareness? Leonor earned her position with her skills. And you? What do you bring to the table, wriggling around in bed?""  
  
Her heart felt torn apart by countless invisible thorns.  
  
Nathaniel, visibly annoyed, couldn't bear to stay in the room any longer. He climbed out of bed, throwing a sharp retort over his shoulder.  
  
""I'll sleep in the guest room tonight. Stop making a fuss over nonsense. It's exhausting.""  
  
The door slammed shut behind him, the sound like a slap to Rosalie's face.  
  
She had known how this would end, yet she'd still walked straight into it, humiliating herself in the process.  
  
A bitter smile tugged at her lips, but her tears were beyond her control. She curled into herself, trembling from the cold that seeped into her very bones.  
  
Three years ago, Rosalie was unable to care for her terminally ill mother while dealing with the financial ruin her father had left behind. Nathaniel's Grandpa, Eldon, had stepped in, offering six billion dollars and an old, yellowed marriage certificate to bring her into the Drake family as Nathaniel's wife.  
  
To outsiders, Rosalie was the luckiest woman alive‚Äîa penniless girl turned Mrs. Drake. Her father's debts were wiped clean. But no one knew about the diary she kept hidden, its pages filled with Nathaniel's name, from her teenage dreams to the scars of her present reality.  
  
She had thought that if she worked hard enough, she could earn a sliver of his affection.  
  
But she learned the truth eventually. Nathaniel had always loved someone else. He had only agreed to marry Rosalie to shield that other woman from the Drake family's wrath.  
  
None of that mattered to Rosalie.  
  
What mattered was the identity of the woman in Nathaniel's heart‚ÄîLeonor.  
  
Leonor was one of the very people who had ruined Rosalie and her mother's lives.  
  
*But how could I explain that? Nathaniel would never believe me.*  
  
So, she fought in silence, playing petty games with him, hoping only for one thing: that he would stay away from that woman.  
  
It was all futile.  
  
The events of the previous day replayed in her mind.  
  
This ridiculous, one-sided love she had nurtured in the dirt was finally over.  
  
Rosalie tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep until dawn, her mind sorting through what needed to be done.  
  
\*\*\*\*\*  
  
By noon, the housekeeper's voice sounded from outside her door.  
  
""Mrs. Drake, the food preparations are ready.""  
  
Rosalie sat up abruptly, suddenly remembering that today marked their third wedding anniversary. She had started planning for it weeks ago.  
  
Now, all her anticipation felt laughable, pointless.  
  
She forced herself to move, tidying up and heading out of the room.   
  
She had planned to call off the preparations, but as she glanced at the dining table, her eyes caught on a familiar designer bag, and her face turned ashen.  
  
It was the same bag Leonor had flaunted on Twitter not long ago. *So he has bought it for her this quickly and even brazenly brought it home.*  
  
A wave of indescribable emotion surged through Rosalie, threatening to drive her mad.  
  
Her gaze shifted to the meticulously prepared dishes. *Fine. The man was trash, but at least the food shouldn‚Äôt go to waste.*  
  
Instead of cooking herself, Rosalie instructed the staff to prepare every ingredient in the house and turn it into as many dishes as possible. She then had them packed into disposable containers, which she handed to several delivery riders.  
  
""Take these to IronSpell Machines,"" she told them calmly. ""Tell them it's a gift from Nathaniel Drake's wife to celebrate our divorce and my escape from an impotent man.""  
  
The riders froze, staring at her in disbelief, almost dropping the food boxes.  
  
Without batting an eye, Rosalie handed them a wad of cash.  
  
""Make sure to use a loudspeaker,"" Rosalie added.  
  
IronSpell Machines was Nathaniel's company, separate from the Drake family empire.  
  
She didn't know its exact valuation.  
  
But she knew one thing. IronSpell Machines was founded by Nathaniel, Leonor, and a few of their close friends.



**Chapter 4 No Thanks**



IronSpell Machines, too, was just another part of the never-ending entanglement between Nathaniel and Leonor.  
  
In the past, just mentioning this company would have sent a pang of pain through her chest. But now, all Rosalie felt was the urge to tear someone apart.  
  
After finishing everything, Rosalie began packing her things.  
  
With the Flynn family's fall, she had brought very little with her, just a suitcase of clothes and another of miscellaneous items. That was all her worldly possessions.  
  
In less than half an hour, she was out the door, suitcase in hand.  
  
She made her way to Golden Glory Residence, a place she knew well, and when she reached the door, it swung open without a sound.  
  
As soon as Rosalie stepped inside, she was shoved against the wall.  
  
Candice Pruitt, in a loose nightgown, stood there with one hand on the wall, squinting at her and smirking. ""Homeless now? I'll take care of you.""   
  
Rosalie pushed her away with a sigh.  
  
If it weren't for being utterly cornered, she would never have come here.  
  
A few minutes later, Candice handed her a steaming cup of coffee, the warmth helping to dissolve some of the chill in Rosalie's heart.  
  
""Thanks.""  
  
""No thanks,"" Candice said, her voice sharp. ""Married to pay off debts and cleared everything up. I told you that you should've found an excuse to back out earlier. But no, you had to throw yourself at him like a fool...""  
  
""Candice, you knew, didn't you?"" Rosalie lifted the cup, looking directly at Candice. When their eyes met, Candice's gaze quickly averted. Rosalie smiled, a bitter glint in her eyes. ""You knew he'd choose Leonor all along, didn't you?""  
  
Candice muttered a curse under her breath.  
  
""She's back?""  
  
""Yeah, now she's a Senior Engineer at Grigow Airlines."" Rosalie lowered her head, her long lashes casting a shadow over her eyes, her face tight with fatigue.  
  
The air in the room was thick with tension. After a long silence, Candice spoke again. ""Divorce and quit your job. I'll take care of you.""  
  
Rosalie let out a small, bitter laugh, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. ""You really think I'll lose?""  
  
""But Nathaniel already kicked you out, didn't he?""  
  
This was exactly why Rosalie hadn't wanted to contact her. Candice's words hit right where it hurt, brutally direct, with no regard for her feelings.  
  
Rosalie said, ""I asked for the divorce because I don't want that man anymore.""  
  
She spoke through gritted teeth, and Candice only gave a hollow laugh in response.  
  
""Well, well, look at you. So, what are you going to do now? Kill Leonor or Nathaniel? Nod, and I'll hire someone.""  
  
Rosalie asked, ""Do you really think anyone would dare kill Nathaniel?""  
  
Candice said, ""I get it. You're still not over him, so it's Leonor you want to go after.""  
  
""Candice, is murder and arson the only thing you have up your sleeve?""  
  
""Not at all. I've got another plan. But it depends on whether you're willing to come back.""  
  
At those words, Rosalie's heart skipped a beat.  
  
Rosalie remembered the summer before her senior year of high school, when she completed her first private network programming task and earned fifty thousand dollars. She used that money to build her own team‚Äîopen to anyone, regardless of age, as long as they had the ability to contribute.  
  
Throughout her four years in college, the team went through multiple rounds of selection before it finally matured. They branched out into various fields and received high-quality orders every month, with impressive revenues. Had it continued, she could've built her own version of the Flynn Group.  
  
But then her mother fell ill, and the debt nearly destroyed everything she had worked so hard to build. Rosalie had no choice but to let it go.  
  
After Rosalie got married, Candice did reach out to her, but by then, Rosalie was fixated on joining Grigow Airlines, completely immersed in Nathaniel's world, abandoning her original ambitions in the process.  
  
In the three years since, the dream she'd desperately tried to hold onto had slipped away.  
  
Candice went into the bedroom and returned with a laptop. Her fingers flew over the keyboard, and in a moment, the screen was facing Rosalie.  
  
""You're most familiar with this firewall, right? This task has been rejected twice, and if it fails again, it'll hurt the team's reputation. Aren't you going to do something about it?""  
  
Rosalie glanced at the screen, furrowing her brow. ""Topcrest Inc.? That's part of the Drake family's empire.""  
  
Candice smirked, clearly enjoying the moment.  
  
""What's the matter? Is earning money from the Drake family too dirty for you? Or do you think Nathaniel will give you a few hundred billion when you divorce him?""  
  
Rosalie had long grown used to Candice's sarcasm.  
  
But this remark triggered a thought.  
  
Nathaniel was the Deputy Chief Pilot, Leonor was a Senior Engineer, and with IronSpell Machines' investment in Grigow Airlines, there was no way she, a mere flight attendant, could settle the score with the Drake family at Grigow Airlines.  
  
Rosalie said, ""Let me think about it. I'm tired. I'll take a nap and get back to you later.""



**Chapter 5 The Divorce Agreement**



After a sleepless night full of turmoil, Rosalie's headache was unbearable.  
  
She went straight to her bedroom and collapsed onto the bed.  
  
Though Candice wasn't the best listener, her sharp words had managed to calm Rosalie's turbulent emotions somewhat.  
  
Combined with the exhaustion, falling asleep wasn't difficult.  
  
But once again, she dreamed of the chaos surrounding her father's death and of her mother's frenzied actions, repeatedly cutting her wrists with a knife.  
  
\*\*\*\*\*  
  
On the other side, the overwhelming order of eighty take-out meals, along with a phone call that went straight to voicemail, pulled Nathaniel back to Lotuswood Estate.  
  
With an air of chilling coldness, he stormed into the living room, his face dark with fury.  
  
Nathaniel asked, ""Where is she?""  
  
The maid trembled, her legs shaking as she replied, ""Mr. Drake, Mrs. Drake took her suitcase and left... she... left this.""  
  
She handed him the item, the words ""Divorce Agreement"" glaringly illuminated by the harsh light.  
  
The room fell into a deathly silence.  
  
After a long pause, Nathaniel opened the file, his fingers cold and stiff as he read the divorce terms:  
  
""Due to the husband's impotence, stinginess with no compensation, lack of affection, and inability to provide, the marriage has irreparably broken down. Hence, divorce is requested.""  
  
Nathaniel nearly choked on his rage.  
  
*This damn woman.*  
  
His face darkened as he pulled out his phone and made a call. Ten minutes later, he received an address: Room 1601, Building 16, Golden Glory Residence,  
  
\*\*\*\*\*  
  
In the afternoon, Rosalie was jolted awake by the deafening sound of someone pounding on the door.  
  
Thinking it was just Candice forgetting her keys again, she yawned, wearing a black camisole and sleep shorts, and opened the door‚Äîonly to freeze.  
  
Rosalie narrowed her eyes, sizing up the man whose face was so dark it seemed ready to drip with anger. In an instant, any trace of sleepiness vanished.  
  
""Can I help you?"" she straightened her posture and asked coldly.  
  
Nathaniel's words were like nails on a chalkboard, his icy glare burning with fury as he stepped into the room, slamming the door shut behind him.  
  
The breeze from the door brushed against Rosalie's pale cheeks, and the familiar pine scent of Nathaniel filled the air, now mingled with a fragrance that clearly wasn't hers.  
  
She forced down the bitter pang in her chest. Before she could turn away, Nathaniel's voice, sharp with anger, cut through the silence. ""Who gave you the audacity to touch IronSpell Machines?""  
  
*So he came here just for this?*  
  
A wave of self-mockery washed over her. The divorce agreement she had deliberately prepared now seemed like a pathetic joke, a self-made performance for no one but herself.  
  
She should've known he wouldn't care.  
  
Taking a deep breath, Rosalie looked at him coolly.  
  
""Nathaniel, I'm still your legal wife, and IronSpell Machines is also mine. Why can't I be involved? If you don't want me to touch it, just sign the divorce papers.""  
  
Before she could finish, a large hand grabbed her slim waist with force.  
  
""You want to split the assets? Is that your goal with this divorce? Rosalie, as long as I don't agree, the only thing you'll get is that divorce agreement, understand?""  
  
Of course, she understood.  
  
Nathaniel's ruthlessness had always been behind the scenes.  
  
He despised the infighting within the Drake family and, after establishing his own business, had systematically taken down everyone who had once oppressed him.  
  
Now, though no longer with the Drake family, everyone knew there would be no second person in charge.  
  
*Fighting him for the family assets? I wasn‚Äôt foolish enough to try.*  
  
But she had endured enough, and she had made up her mind.  
  
If Rosalie couldn't have peace, then neither would Nathaniel.  
  
Without hesitation, she turned to face him, pressing his hand down as she spoke, ""So what? Besides the divorce papers, if I wanted, I could even ask for a child. That way, I'd still have a foothold in your family...""  
  
Her hand slid down toward his, but before it could reach its mark, Nathaniel seized it, pulling it away. His face darkened.  
  
""If you want a child, you'd better make sure you're worthy,"" Nathaniel said.  
  
""How am I not worthy?""  
  
Rosalie didn't struggle. Her eyes, moist with unshed tears, revealed an unfathomable sadness.  
  
""Don't push your luck."" Nathaniel's voice was thick with frustration.  
  
Rosalie smiled faintly, her long lashes damp with unshed emotion.  
  
""Right, I'm not worthy. Only Leonor is, huh? Fine. I've lost all interest in men who can't even have children. I've already signed the divorce agreement, so go ahead.""",1,1748847260.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Just wish she would‚Äôve got to live to see a few more.

Characters Anna, Sarah‚Äôs mom, Noah, Kenzie‚Äôs boyfriend, Kenzie, Sarah‚Äôs best friend, Maddie, Kenzie, and Sarah‚Äôs best friend Dexter, the police officer


Chapter 1: Saturday Morning Shock
Here's how that Saturday morning really went down: Kenzie and I walked into the gas station. My heart sank when I saw Noah and Maddie kissing. Kenzie exploded, yelling and throwing a coffee at Noah. We stormed out of there, leaving them in the dust.



Chapter 2: The Unexplained Encounter
Later, Noah found a way to talk to me. He explained everything, how Maddie had manipulated him, how he was caught completely off guard by the kiss, and that it wasn't what it seemed. He laid out details that made it clear Noah was innocent. He was just a pawn in Maddie's games.




Chapter 3: A Deeper Secret Revealed
In telling me the truth, Noah inadvertently revealed a deeper secret. Because of what Noah told me, I realized something far more sinister was at play. I understood the full extent of Maddie's deception and, more chillingly, Dexter's involvement in something that went way beyond a simple affair. I knew too much. And because I knew the truth, Dexter killed me. As a police officer, he had the perfect cover-up. No one would suspect him.


Chapter 4: Hope's Tragic Connection
And no one did suspect him until Hope knew everything but she didn‚Äôt wanna believe it. Hope loved the back stories so sad. She grew up poor without a mother father very disturbed live in an orphanage all of our life foster home to foster home till she turned 13 was adopted by Lily and James. They were the only thing she had. They were the closest thing she had to mother and father. She was a baby when her mother and father died, so she always found comfort in Dexter in high school. They were both very smart, graduated at a young age. They are planning to just be the perfect couple to make up for all the years that were perfect, but Dexter knew Hope knew and he had no choice. My death was a sad story. Hope's life was just down down and then up.



Chapter 5: Unraveling the Truth
Then Noah and Kenzie put all their pieces together. They found my diary. The last time I wrote it was Saturday morning before I was dead. I knew I was going to die. I wrote letters and I said that I love them and I told them who it was, how it happened, because Dexter wanted to plan out this way. He made me write and write so that there‚Äôd still be a piece of me with Kenzie and Noah so they‚Äôd always feel like that they could‚Äôve saved me. I love you, Kenzie, and I just wish it didn‚Äôt have to end like this, but Noah and Kenzie were back together. Maddie and Dexter were both in jail. I was dead, but let it be known Saturday will never be the same again.

1l1b6ri,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l1b6ri/dating_20_years_age_gap_and_shitstorms_from/,Dating 20 years age gap and shitstorms from friends.,"Hi guys, I try to be concise here. 

I'm a free lance self-employed (early 40's). A few days ago I went yo a friend's house, a guy I'm working with who is also free-lance. I know him and his wife really well. 

A woman was there. Younger than me (early 20's just below 25). I'm not chasing younger women. The woman is also free-lance and she seen my work and I have seen her work so we exchanged our Instagram planning to work together. 

Then, we started to talk about work. Little by little we started to talk about more personal stuffs. Not that any of us pushed it. It came naturally. 

Then a couple of days ago we decided to go for a coffee the next day (yesterday). 

I had a public work showcase and the free-lance guy I'm working with was doing one as well at the same event as me. She decided to come and see me for that work showcase before our coffee as we planned the coffee after that. 

Obviously the guy saw us leaving together. 

He then messaged her and delete his message on WhatsApp. She didn't had time to see the message. 

He followed by: ""I don't know if you have seen my previous message but anyway this is not my business. But I have to cancel next Wednesday meeting working with you for now."" 

She texted back asking if there was any issues, He replied by: ""No not all"".

A few minutes after his wife texted me saying: ""You cant date a person 20 years younger than you!""

Then, and other person we are all working with and wasn't even there or had anything yo do woth this situation, texted me a few minutes later : ""I'm not sure this  is a good idea for you and I'm concerned about you""

The girl I was dating is very professional and very driven and focus on her career. 

She was shocked by the text message of my friends and the guy she was supposed to work with. 

She told me that she doesn't want to work with him even if he apologized as she find that extremely controlling and out of place and she prefers that to happen now than in a few months when she will be more involved in work with him (She just started to work with him).

I feel a bit frustrated with my friends and peers! 

1. She is right, this behaviorist extremely controlling and misplaced. I know one of our peers who literally cheated on his wife, left her and treated her like shit, but really badly and went with the girl he cheated. Behaving badly to his ex wife who is a lovely woman. But for whatever reason that's acceptable. I don't judge and I dont care but if those people have to judge me, they should judge him as well I guess?!?

2. This is insulting for the woman I have been dating and me, saying: ""You guys don't know what you are doing, let me teach you!"" 
That woman is young but she runs a succesful business, she is independant, have a very strong will, she is very bright. And most of all I find her reaction to all that shitstorm a lot more mature than my friends. 

So the main argument with age gap dating is unbalanced power. Well that woman is far more mature than any people around me. She is driven and knows what she wants. 

She follows her red flags and is very determined. 

I never tried to control her. She never tried to control me. It jas been very respectful all the way. That shitstorm actually forced us to talk about what is happening and our age gap. It was a calm and balanced discussion. 

The couple who texted us, are married and have 11 years age gap. I know it is not 20 years. 

Now talking about controlling, if it was the other way around, and I was dating a woman 20 years older than me, would they react the same way? 

His text message to the woman I was dating:

Saying something and delete it, then follow that by a passive agressive comment, then canceling his work with her, clearly because of that and when she texted him nicely to ask if there is any issue, he replied by ""No everything is fine"" is for me far more controlling than the coffee that woman and I had yesterday. 

I decided to not respond to anyone yesterday and wait for my feelings to settle. 

But I will need to explain and clarify things.

At the same time, I didn't know if I should carry on seeing that girl. 

But I realise that life can end anytime for anyone. In a 100 years, it will be like we never existed as nobody will remember us at that time unless we are famous. 

So on one way, f**k them! 

Other way is I'm a bit scared with work and the impact that will have as I'm working with the guy a lot. 

I dont know what to do... What do you guys think?

Just added this to my reading list. If anyone knows the app or site where it's updated daily, please drop it!","My VP office had suddenly been handed over to the new female intern by my husband Ryker Hampton.  
  
Later, she even posted photos of the office on Ins with the caption:  
  
\[Grateful for my dear CEO Mr. Hampton's reward!\]  
  
In the attached photos, the entire office layout carefully designed by me had been changed, and even more all my award plaques had mysteriously vanished.  
  
I forwarded it directly to Ryker:  
  
\[What exactly are you playing at? Why is an intern occupying MY personal office?\]  
  
He sent back a voice message, with a drunken tone: ""Babe, it's just an office. You're not using it anyway.""  
  
\[You have ten minutes to restore my office to its original condition.\]  
  
On the other end, Ryker didn't respond.  
  
Two minutes later, Hampton Industries' most critical contract was forcibly terminated.  
  
Since someone wanted to challenge my authority, I didn't mind letting Hampton Industries go BANKRUPT directly.

The calls from Ryker kept pouring in, one after another. I didn't answer until the fifth one.  
  
His furious voice erupted through the speaker.  
  
""Mila! Have you lost your damn mind? That was a two hundred million dollar project!""  
  
""You know perfectly well the product launch is next week. Pulling the plug now is practically corporate suicide!""  
  
""All this over only an office? Are you serious?""  
  
Five years of marriage, and this was the first time he'd ever raised his voice at me over another woman.

""Dead serious,"" I replied coolly.  
  
""Ryker, restore my office to exactly how it was before. Every single award, every item in its precise location. Otherwise, your company will suffer far greater losses.""  
  
On the other end, Ryker fell silent for several seconds.  
  
""You have five minutes. Starting now.""  
  
I delivered these words with cold precision before directly hanging up.  
  
Two minutes later, he sent photos of my restored office. Everything had been returned to its original place.  
  
Upon receiving the pictures, I immediately contacted the project manager and rescinded the termination order.  
  
But I sent Ryker a photo in return.  
  
In the image, his study had been completely emptied.  
  
Including his most prized possession‚Äîan expensive antique he'd just acquired at auction.  
  
I attached a second photo: the antique shattered into pieces across the floor.  
  
""Ryker, this is your punishment. You know my temperament. Don't let this happen again.""  
  
There was no response from his end.  
  
I knew he was furious. But I was even more so.  
  
Our marriage began as a strategic alliance between two corporations.  
  
Five years ago, he needed Sullivan Enterprises' overseas distribution channels, and I needed Hampton Industries' domestic manufacturing facilities. A business marriage was the logical conclusion.  
  
No passionate love story‚Äîjust a rational choice for mutual benefit.  
  
""Mila, we'll not only support each other in business, but after marriage, I promise to trust and respect you,"" Ryker had said, holding my hands, his gaze steady and sincere before our wedding.  
  
""I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Hampton. I hope our partnership proves fruitful,"" I'd responded with a measured smile.  
  
Over five years, we evolved from strangers to confidants, from respect to dependence, then to genuine warmth and affection.  
  
We'd shared countless nights huddled together after exhausting business functions.  
  
This year, we finally welcomed our baby.  
  
It was the perfect testament to our love, making me believe our love bond was unbreakable.  
  
But now, Brianna's appearance had shattered all the trust and understanding we'd built.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Ryker didn't come home that night.  
  
I knew he was expressing his anger and dissatisfaction through his absence.  
  
The next day, I left our son with the nanny and went straight to the office.  
  
The employees looked surprised when they saw me, quickly lowering their heads and greeting me respectfully.  
  
""Ms. Sullivan! Your postpartum recovery period isn't over yet. Should you be at home and have rest?"" the young receptionist asked with concern.  
  
""Just checking on things,"" I replied with a slight nod before heading straight to the executive floor.  
  
As the elevator doors opened, I heard laughter coming from Ryker's office.  
  
Through the half-open door, I saw Brianna sitting beside him.  
  
Ryker's eyes sparkled with amusement‚Äîa stark contrast to the cool demeanor he typically maintained with other assistants.  
  
Usually, except for me, he never allowed anyone to linger in his office, much less with such a tender expression on his face.  
  
But now, he was sitting incredibly close to Brianna, the two of them deep in animated conversation.  
  
Brianna was wearing a high-end designer outfit.  
  
The exact one I had been eyeing‚Äîthe one Ryker had promised to get for me.  
  
Not just expensive, it was a limited edition‚Äîonly five sets existed worldwide.  
  
And now it was on an female intern.  
  
I pushed the door open. Their laughter died instantly.  
  
The smile froze on Ryker's face.  
  
""What are you doing here?"" he asked.  
  
Brianna quickly stood up, plastering a respectful expression on her face while greeting me in a honeyed voice.  
  
""Ms. Sullivan! I heard you just had your baby. They say pregnancy changes a woman's figure, but wow, you've bounced back amazingly!""  
  
I scoffed, firing back: ""Since when is my figure any of your business? Which blind idiot hired someone with such poor manners?""  
  
Brianna's smile stiffened, her fingers fidgeting nervously.  
  
""Take off that outfit. Now.""  
  
The atmosphere in the office plummeted to sub-zero.  
  
Brianna's eyes widened, her lips trembling in disbelief.  
  
She turned to Ryker with a doe-eyed, tearful look of appeal.  
  
I also turned to Ryker, my gaze cold as ice.  
  
""Explain why MY clothes are on HER body.""

Papers everywhere, empty coffee cups, sticky notes covering your monitor. Without occasionally cleaning up, you'd eventually run out of space to work. Your computer's memory faces the same problem.

Every time your program creates an object, allocates an array, or stores data, it uses memory. In languages like C, you have to manually free this memory when you're done - like washing your own dishes. But in languages like Java, Python, or JavaScript, the runtime automatically cleans up unused memory for you.

This automatic cleanup is called¬†**garbage collection**, and Mark and Sweep is one of the most fundamental algorithms that makes it possible.

# Roll the dice!

I'm looking at the cookies in our office kitchen. *""I want some.. but they're high in calories. Then again, it would go great with the coffee‚Ä¶ but I'm not sure I can stop after one.*"" Back and forth I go, immobilised by the two sides in me. In moments like this, I let fate decide. **I agree with myself on a number between 1 and 20 (usually an 18), I then roll a 20-sided die. If I roll higher than the number, I have the treat. If lower, I don't.** It's been really helpful in some moments to remove myself from the decision-making process because my arguments for or against eating the cookie ain't gonna influence the number on the dice.

How does it work **in practice**? I have a dice roller app bookmarked on the home view on my phone. This makes it easy to do when you need to decide quickly, for instance when choosing what to order in a restaurant while the waiter is breathing down your neck. At home, I roll a physical die because it's more fun.

My partner is in on it and sometimes we roll for ordering takeaway together, which means we either get delicious & effortless dinner or we spend some quality time cooking together - it's a win-win situation.

Do I always follow the results of the roll? No. Do I always roll when there's tasty treats around? Also, no. But this technique prevents me from going over my calorie target every now and again and that is already a win.

# Find the tiniest reason not to.

As we saw in the last section, when I'm faced with some unhealthy food, there's at least some part of me that does not want to eat it. The trick is to **find that reason, no matter how small, and hold on to it.** Here's how this technique might work:

>""yes, that is a cinnamon roll... but it's from yesterday, so it won't be very fresh anymore, and if it's not the best cinnamon roll, then I'm not going to waste calories on it. I'd rather satisfy the craving with the tastiest version of this treat some other day.""

or:

>""yes, I'd like another piece of chocolate‚Ä¶ but I've already had four while Mark and Mary have had one, so it would be nice of me to not have any of the last ones.""

I've noticed that the best tiny reasons have nothing to do with my calorie targets or my goal weight. I suspect it's because human brains have a hard time rationalising such abstract concepts like ""goals"" or ""the future"" when faced with the primal urge to shove delicious food in your face.

# Bedroom activities

Ever since me and my partner had a proper discussion of our likes and dislikes in the bedroom a few months ago, our sex life has improved tremendously, which also means we're spending more time on it. Sex is honestly one of the best ways to shut down food noise - there really isn't much space in the brain to think of much else. I'm sure everyone can come up with creative ideas on how to do this or how to have sessions lasting longer, leaving less time for, say, scouring the fridge.



What are some less common tips that have worked for you?

1l1azs3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roses/comments/1l1azs3/rose_care_help_advice/,Rose Care Help & Advice,"Hello fellow rose gardeners,

As my title says, I am asking for some expert help and advice on rose care. Over the past 3 years I have purchased 6 rose bushes altogether. Tiffany, Queen Elizabeth, Anastasia, Black Baccara, Sugar Moon, and Neptune. For some context, I live in an apartment complex in NJ (zone 6B). I do not have a yard to do gardening in at my complex, but I have a plot at a community garden that I go to regularly (about 2-3 days a week depending on the weather). Since I live in NJ, we get a decent amount of rain in the Springtime, particularly on the weekends, so I don't have to water every single day. In the summertime, I water them early in the morning, around 6 am before the heat of the day begins around 10 AM. When I first bought Queen Elizabeth, Anastasia and Tiffany, they all were doing pretty well. I use BioAdvance 3 in 1 twice a year with the proper amount as instructed, and I prune them properly as recommended by professionals. However, last summer, Queen Elizabeth was attacked by some kind of disease. I'm still researching what it may have been. One week it was thriving, and the next most of the leaves were gone, and the branches were all brown, save for one. By the end of summer, the entire plant was dead. I was pretty devastated.  This year, Anastasia and Neptune are completely brown with no new leaves or buds. I'm getting nervous for them. I am at a loss of what to do. I bought Black Baccara and Sugar Moon early this Spring. I gave each of my roses the BioAdvance 3 in 1 just last weekend. 

 What can I do for my rose bushes that are beginning to bud this year so that they are all happy and healthy? Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do for Queen Elizabeth, Anastasia, and Neptune except replace them. I desperately need advice from rose gardeners who have had roses for a considerable number of years who know what they're doing. I'm not asking for coffee grounds, banana peels or anything like that, but real, practical tips on what to do to protect my gorgeous gals. I also understand that things do happen, and there's no guarantee that roses will thrive and survive. I have yet to test my soil, but I will be getting a soil testing kit this week to see what needs to be adjusted for them. I have other plants that are doing perfectly fine, such as two butterfly bushes, hibiscus bushes, columbines, and calla lilies that are having no issues with the soil. But my roses, \*sigh\*, I just don't know.

All but one of my roses I bought were from trusted rose growers, such as Edmond's, Spring Hill, and Bluestone Perennials. Anastasia was purchased at Lowes. I take a lot of pride and joy from my roses, and I want them to have the best care for their beautiful blooms and fragrance. I am heartbroken and bewildered. I think I covered all the information that y'all would need. Please help.

When Constantine Simonides was explaining how the manuscript (now called Codex Sinaiticus) got from Mt. Athos to St. Catherine's in Sinai, he narrated:     
  
""... The volume, whilst in my possession, was seen by many persons, and it was perused with attention by the Hadji John Prodromos, son of Pappa Prodromos, who was a minister of the Greek Church in Trebizond. John Prodromos kept a coffee-house in Galatas, Constantinople, and probably does so still. ,,,  All the persons thus named are, I believe, still alive, and could bear witness to the truth of my statement.""

The Journal of Sacred Literature - (April, 1863)

Afawk, nobody made any efforts to contact John Prodromos or the coffee-shop to verify the account. 

Do any of our Byzantium experts have any **leads on the Galatas coffee house (Golden Horn) of John Prodromos or his dad with the church in Trebizond**? Generally the Simonides narrative holds up very well to scrutiny. Apparently the coffee house would have been a favorite spot of the Greek Orthodox.

Julia forced herself to continue with halting words. ‚ÄúMom, when we tell Dad‚Ä¶ what it is going to do to him? They are Human, Mom‚Ä¶ Humans whose ancestors were deliberately genetically altered a Hundred years ago, by the old leaders.

‚ÄúIt gets worse, though. Mom, they are from Hallistifar. The Phoenix ship, Mom. The one whose destruction by the Xaltans kicked off The War: They didn‚Äôt destroy it. Dad‚Äôs suspicion was right: some sort of failsafe kicked in and it managed to FTL away amidst the explosions‚Ä¶ but the damage to these people, or their predecessors who were on that ship‚Ä¶ it had already been done.‚Äù

Tears fell from her mother‚Äôs face, though their eyes remained locked. Mom‚Äôs voice came out halting and timid. ‚ÄúI was there, you know, when that ship got away. I wasn‚Äôt on the bridge, of course, but I was on the ship, in the VIP quarters we‚Äôd been given. I watched it all happen, watched the Admiral in charge refuse to order a Human warship on a suicide mission, and watched that ship, with thousands of souls aboard, dive to its death in the attempt to keep that Phoenix from getting anyway‚Ä¶ and to no avail.

‚ÄúYour Father‚Ä¶ I had a feed which showed me the Flag Bridge. Many have complimented him on how he kept his composure in that moment. I already knew him far too well by then. I *saw* part of him die inside, darling. It may have only been through a screen, but I saw it‚Ä¶ I *felt* it‚Ä¶ and I was there in the room when he finally let that iron control go and‚Ä¶‚Äù

Mom shook her head, tears flying. ‚ÄúI was also there when he saw the ship destroyed by Xaltan order, despite that they knew what it really was. That, the moment he saw it, was the only time I ever actually feared him, even if it was only for a moment. I never thought any sapient being could be capable of such rage.‚Äù Mom looked away, bit her lip, took a shuddering breath, looked up at the ceiling, almost as if looking for a benediction from On High.

‚ÄúWe studiously avoid the subject, as much as we can. He told me once that it was the one thing he refused to talk with his therapists about, because he just couldn‚Äôt. They finally did some hypnosis and other tricks to keep it from gnawing away his soul, but he‚Ä¶ I think it is the only thing in his past he runs from, so to speak.‚Äù

Mom‚Äôs hand balled up in a fist, and she pounded it on the chair. ‚ÄúThe only times we have spoken of it have been in the dead of night, when he used to wake screaming or ‚Äì worse ‚Äì shuddering and choking. Once, only once, he managed to speak more than a few coherent words to me. He said to me‚Ä¶‚Äù she choked back a sob. ‚ÄúHe said to me that he had only one comfort in the whole incident: That the people who died on that ship would not be slaves to those brutal masters. He said it was a‚Ä¶ a cold, hard comfort, but something‚Ä¶‚Äù

Mom buried her face in her hands and wept. Julia moved over to her, wrapped an arm around her, and rocked her back and forth.

They stayed on the couch like that for hours, and that was how Dad found them.

She and Mom had cried themselves out, though they knew more would come once they broke the news to Dad. Julia wanted to hold off time, wait, anything to delay what came next. Julia wanted to push a fast-forward on time, get the interminable wait over with.

Then the door to her quarters burst open and Dad strode through in a rush. She heard his heavy footfalls as he slammed the door behind him and spoke with a voice meant to carry. ‚ÄúWhat is going on? What has happened? Not one person in the Embassy would look me in the eye, and when I tried to ask about it they all told me to hurry and get he‚Ä¶‚Äù

He got to the entry of the sitting room and stopped for a moment, then seemed to teleport to the coffee table in front of them, and had both their heads in his hands, holding them too him.

Now his voice came out quiet, fearful. ‚ÄúWhat has happened? Darling, is it one of the kids? Enibal? One of‚Ä¶‚Äù

Mom pushed herself away and stared him in the eye. ‚ÄúThe‚Ä¶ the kids are fine. All of those we hold dear are fine, at least as far as I know. But, something has been discovered‚Ä¶‚Äù Tears began to fall from Mom‚Äôs face again. ‚ÄúOh, my dear Henry‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶‚Äù

Julia sat up as she felt her Father brace for the worst, despite the confusion on his face. He began to stammer out questions, but Mom just shook her head, and placed a hand on his knee.

Her mouth worked, soundlessly for a few moments, but nothing came out. Julia took a deep breath as Mom turned helpless eyes to her.

‚ÄúDad‚Ä¶ we‚Ä¶ you need to move to the couch.‚Äù

He shook his head. ‚ÄúNo, I want to know what this is‚Ä¶‚Äù

It cost her a great deal of will power, but she stood and tugged hard on his arm. ‚ÄúNo, Dad. Move. Sit beside Mom, there on the couch. This is going to be hard enough as it is.‚Äù

They swapped places, and she took his hands in hers. Mom‚Äôs hands came down on top of theirs. She looked her Father in the eyes, but the mix of confusion, agitation, and fear defeated her. She looked away.

‚ÄúWe got the genetics reports back on those pirates; The ones preying on the edges of League space. They‚Ä¶ Dad they are Human.‚Äù

A glance at him showed narrowed eyes, and deeper confusion. ‚ÄúWait, they are too short for Humans, unless they all have dwarfism, but even then the proportions are‚Ä¶‚Äù

Words trailed off as she shook her head. ‚ÄúThe proportions are wrong for that, Dad, and you know it.‚Äù

Horror began to haunt his eyes. *Some part of him realizes this is going to be bad, just from our behavior, but he is grasping at straws to try and keep it at bay.*

He stammered. ‚ÄúPygmies, then? I mean, there aren‚Äôt many‚Ä¶‚Äù

She bit her lip and looked away. *Gods, heavens and hells, I don‚Äôt want to do this to him.* ‚ÄúNo, Dad.‚Äù Her tears started again. *How do I have any left?* ‚ÄúPlease, just listen. It is‚Ä¶ That is‚Ä¶ They‚Ä¶ You remember, Dad‚Ä¶ The Phoenix‚Ä¶ The one that lit the fuse on The War‚Ä¶ Hallistafar‚Ä¶‚Äù

Dad‚Äôs hands dropped, and his head shook. His eyes closed and tears came out. She‚Äôd seen him cry few times before, but she knew the look in his eyes when she said that last word would haunt her all of her days.

He slowly sank back into the couch, his head shaking quietly and repeating the word ‚ÄòNo‚Äô over and over. Then he screamed, a guttural cry of agony which hurt her very soul, and then he crumpled into her mother. She wrapped herself around them as best she could. They stayed there for hours crying, talking, soothing one another, crying some more. When dawn came, it found them all still piled together, asleep.

Julia stood, showered, let her parents stay on the couch. She‚Äôd gotten some real sleep, but not enough, and she felt a little stiff from the odd position. She sat down at her computer and logged in. Or, she tried to log in. She got an empty screen with some text informing her that she was on ‚Äòemergency family leave,‚Äô and that she wasn‚Äôt to leave her apartment until both she and her parents were ready to speak with the world.

She went back into the living room, got her parents up, coaxed them into the bathroom, told them to shower and get to bed, then did the same herself.

When she woke a few hours later the apartment was quiet, but sunlight showed in the phaux windows she kept tuned to the local outdoors. She got up and made breakfast; the pancakes which seemed to hold some special place in her parent‚Äôs hearts, though they‚Äôd refused to ever explain why.

They came out as she finished the last of the bacon (bacon always seemed to rouse them when they slept in too late, even better than coffee) had finished. Both looked a bit worse for wear, and she could tell they‚Äôd cried some more since they woke.

She hugged them, sat everyone down, passed out the plates, gave them both a level look, then fixed her eyes on her Father. ‚ÄúOk, Dad, what is it you *want* to do? I don‚Äôt promise to agree that it is a good idea, or even to help if I think it is too bad of one, but I promise to listen.‚Äù

He *harrumphed*. ‚ÄúWhat makes you so sure I know what I want already. The Universe just took the two worst days of my life and piled a brand-spanking-new pile of guilt and pain on top of them both, with a side order of ‚Äòscrew you,‚Äô and you expect me to have a plan?‚Äù

A single raised eyebrow came with the end of his remarks, but the haunted look in his eyes killed any humor from the deflection.

She took a bite and glanced at her Mother, who gave a helpless shrug. She turned back to her Father. ‚ÄúDad, really? I‚Äôve known you for more than five minutes‚Ä¶ so yes, I know you have some course of action already in mind, and that you want‚Ä¶ no, you *need* to be part of whatever happens.

‚ÄúSo, out with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶ what if I want to stew on it a while, and don‚Äôt feel ready to share it yet?‚Äù

She just cocked her head a bit to one side and returned him the raised eyebrow he‚Äôd given her, with interest.

He puffed up for a moment, or tried to, but had nothing left to put behind it. His head lowered, and he spoke to his pancakes. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure, luv. You are right, in that I *need* to be part of this. I will never be able to deal with‚Ä¶ with‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt be able to forgive myself if I sit on the sidelines and do nothing.‚Äù

A knock sounded at the apartment door. Then thumped it hard. They looked at one another in confusion.

Mom spoke first. ‚ÄúKatja sent me a message, promised she had made it very clear that you were on Family Emergency leave, and that no one would be allowed to disturb you.‚Äù

The pounding started again, this time with more insistence. *Who could possibly over-ride Katja and come pound on that door? Who would dare?*

She shut her eyes and shook her head as realization came to her. ‚ÄúThere is only one person on this planet the staff would allow within five feet of that door.‚Äù

Her parents nodded, looked at one another, looked back at her, and nodded again.

She pitched her voice to make sure the apartment computers understood she was addressing the door. ‚ÄúCome in Uncle Kaz.‚Äù

## Key Features Analysis

The Native Path Collagen boasts several noteworthy features that contribute to its purported benefits.

**Sourcing and Purity:** Native Path Collagen utilizes collagen peptides sourced from grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine.

The combination of these two types offers a thorough approach to collagen supplementation.

**Flavor and Mixability:** The product is available in both flavored and unflavored options. The unflavored version is virtually tasteless and dissolves easily in both hot and cold liquids,making it convenient to incorporate into various beverages and foods.The flavored options often include natural sweeteners and flavors, offering a palatable alternative for those who prefer a more enjoyable taste experience.

## FAQs Section
