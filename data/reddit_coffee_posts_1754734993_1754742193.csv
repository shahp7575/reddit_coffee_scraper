The Naked Gun is a pleasant palette cleanser in a movie ecosystem that‚Äôs sadly shifted from ‚Äò[insert genre] movies are a joke‚Äô to ‚Äò[insert genre] movies with some jokes‚Äô. This is a straightforward, no-frills comedy movie where its whole purpose was to get dumb laughs. It even clocks in at a lean 85 minutes, which is much welcome during a time where movie runtimes seem to be at least 120 minutes.

Liam Neeson plays Lieutenant Frank Drebin Jr., son of Frank Drebin (RIP Leslie Nielsen) from the original Naked Gun movies, a professional ‚ÄúBad Guy Catcher‚Äù who works at the local ‚ÄòPolice Squad‚Äô. Whereas Drebin Sr. is bumbling and out of his depth, Drebin Jr. is masculinity personified with an addiction to dirty chilli dogs and coffee (he‚Äôs always being handed a cup, whether he‚Äôs in the office or driving down a highway at speed).

Look, there is technically a plot but it‚Äôs not really important. For the sake of context, I‚Äôll do my due diligence.

There‚Äôs been a murder and Drebin Jr. has to solve it. Along the way he encounters a femme-fatale type (a great Pamela Anderson), talks shop with his pal Captain Ed Hocken Jr. (Paul Walter Hauser, who is sadly a bit underutilised), and antagonises an evil billionaire (Danny Huston) with a blonde henchman (Kevin Durand). Oh and there a plenty of great cameos, which I won‚Äôt spoil here.

1mlo2gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/forquittingweed/comments/1mlo2gw/you_can_be_addicted_to_anything/,you can be addicted to anything,"an addiction is a typical pathway for your neurotransmitters (which is simply a moving neuron). your brain wants to create patterns and routines - its necessary. but sometimes it goes too far and it accounts for smoking weed every day or drinking coffee every morning or going for a run before work every day. all of these things, if done often enough, can technically become an addiction. your brain makes it a routine that it expects you to follow - its what you taught it to expect. so it expects it now.

changing any habit or addiction is difficult no matter what because your brain RELIES on that routine. changing it hurts the system but can be done if needed

other drugs are not just addictive but often have life threatening withdrawal symptoms. THIS is what made everyone say weed isnt addictive because your body will not fail to function if quitting cold turkey. it could if youre a real drinker, heavy drug addict, or very addicted to prescription medication (yes its true quitting pain meds can be life threatening) but you will NEVER die from quitting weed. You cant even overdose on traditional marijuana... BUT that doesnt mean your body isnt addicted. It just means the withdrawal symptoms are not life threatening

I have a Canadian university degree in Psychology and this issue came up a lot with weed - people saying its not addictive because the psychology world doesnt deem it to have a physical dependence. People didnt understand what the studies showed and misunderstood from the beginning. it was always addictive, and psychologists knew that the whole time but failed to manage society's view. its just that the addiction isnt severe like it is for hard substances where you literally depend on it, and can die without it. people got confused and thought it meant that since marijuana cannot achieve that status, it was safe and worry free. it only is to an extent, daily use can be a problem in other ways. it just wont kill you...

Just posting this here so if anyone is still confused by why people say that its not addictive, they might understand why that belief came to be in the first place. according to half my professors anyway (I'm serious, this came up A LOT)",1,1754741979.0,forquittingweed,0,1.0,False
1mlo17o,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1mlo17o/dare_to_reject_the_omega_she_is_my_luna/,Dare to Reject The Omega : She Is My Luna,"**Chapter 1**



Only a fool looks Alpha Zavier in the eye when he speaks. You dare not interrupt him and if you‚Äôre an omega girl called Aysel, it‚Äôs best to hide. I learnt these tricks early in life. I knew not to look up, not to make a sound and to make myself invisible in the crowd of people that filled the banquet hall to celebrate the Feast of the Moon.   
  
But I never did anything right. When asked to take a step to the left, I ended up at the right, whether I took a step to the left or not. Fate worked in reverse for me. If I sowed good, I reaped misfortune.   
  
It was the reason why, while serving with my head down, trying to make myself smaller than my small frame, I tripped on a fair leg, my tray of wine flying from my hand and tumbling to the ground, crashing ‚Äì loudly ‚Äì to the floor and spilling its red content against the fair feet of the Alpha‚Äôs daughter, in the middle of the Alpha‚Äôs speech. I raised my head and caught the Alpha Zavier‚Äôs gaze and at that moment, I‚Äôd broken three of the most fundamental rules of avoiding a beating.   
  
At that moment ‚Äì when I made eye contact with the Alpha and sealed my fate ‚Äì  Skylar, the Alpha‚Äôs daughter, let out a blood-curdling scream, as if it took her that ten seconds of silence to process what I‚Äôd done. I‚Äôd spilt expensive wine on her equally expensive, white, floor length dress.  
  
Her hand smacked my head to the right as an apology dropped from my lips. Then to the left, and right again. She kept smacking me as everyone stared with their mouths open at what I had done until the Alpha cleared his throat and called for order.   
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough, Sky.‚Äù Alpha Zavier looked at me as he addressed his daughter, his eyes filled with deep hatred and fiery anger. I gulped, cupping my hot cheeks.  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not. This little bitch ruined my dress!‚Äù Skylar cried, her sweet soprano voice raising as she hit me for the last time. ‚ÄúWhy are you so jealous of me?‚Äù She cried yet again, dragging everyone‚Äôs attention back to the scene despite the Alpha‚Äôs call for order.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not,‚Äù I answered in a whispery voice with my hands shaking.   
  
My eyes stung with the tears I held at bay, blurring the faces around me. I didn‚Äôt want to cry now ‚Äì not now. It would only make my humiliation worse if I broke down here. I told myself I had to wait ‚Äì I had to wait for them to take me out for a beating when the enforcers would give me a good reason to cry but I wasn‚Äôt strong. My lips quivered as the tears slid down my face. I blinked rapidly to clear them but they fell faster the more I blinked.   
  
Alpha Zavier signalled something at those behind me as his daughter stumped out, pushing people out of her way as she went. Two men grabbed me from behind, dragging me out of the hall. I looked at the few people who still watched the drama unfold as the Alpha went back to his speech, a muscle twitching at the side of his jaw. Only one person watching me looked at me with anything other than scorn in her eyes as the enforcers dragged me away.   
  
They threw me into a dark room, locking the door behind them. This dark room belonged to me. I slept here, had all my possessions ‚Äì a single bag ‚Äì in this room, the days I had food, I ate here and every day, I cried in this same room.   
  
Two months ago, I spent two weeks locked up in my room and sometime in the two weeks, my food supply was cut off. I‚Äôd starved for at least five days but down here, in the cold, damp basement of the pack house, time became relative. I could have starved for one week or to days, there was never a way to be sure. Everything was dark ‚Äì every hour of the day, night.   
  
The door handle jiggled as someone tried to get in. The door jammed a lot and needed brute force to open on most days. Skylar came in with her brother and her boyfriend all wearing nasty smirks on their lips.  
  
My eyes lingered on Skylar‚Äôs boyfriend for a minute. A few years ago, Lucien had been my best friend. I told him everything. I loved him as a best friend and more.   
  
‚ÄòPromise me we‚Äôll never fall apart.‚Äô I held his hand and stared up at him the night before we started high school.   
  
‚ÄòYou‚Äôve started with your cute sentiments.‚Äô He kissed my nose. I pretended to hate it but it warmed my heart. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs me and you for life, Ay-babe.‚Äô  
  
‚ÄòMe and you and Celeste,‚Äô I mentioned my other best friend which made him laugh.   
  
‚ÄòWhatever you say, doll.‚Äô The sound of his laughter made my knees weak.   
  
A few years later I found out we were mates so I tried to do something sweet for him, knowing what it‚Äôd cost me.  
  
‚ÄòLucien ‚Äì‚Äò I just wanted to see him smile.  
  
‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Beta Lucien to you,‚Äô he snapped, his hand around Skylar‚Äôs shoulder. The alpha female stared at me with indifference on her face but a spark of glee in her eyes.   
  
‚ÄòBeta Lucien, can we ‚Äì can we talk?‚Äô I watched as he twirled Skylar‚Äôs hair between his fingers.   
  
‚ÄòWe can talk here.‚Äô Someone behind them chuckled at his mocking tone. ‚ÄòWhat do you want? You‚Äôre wasting my time.‚ÄôHe stared at the gold watch on his wrist to emphasize his point.  
  
I stretched out flowers with shaky hands while the school watched with bathed breath. It was a secret he kept well but I‚Äôd been his best friend since we were in diapers and I knew he loved receiving flowers. He hid that part of himself because it wasn‚Äôt considered manly but he didn‚Äôt have to be manly with me.   
  
‚ÄòI love you.‚Äô Loud guffaws surrounded me. Tears stung my eyes when my best friend and mate joined in the derisive laughter.    
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for you to pay.‚Äù Skylar smirked, pulling me back to the present. She‚Äôd taken off her ruined dress to come black combat shorts and a black long-sleeved keyhole shirt.   
  
‚ÄúOn your knees,‚Äù Alpha Bethel, the future leader of our pack called, dragging me out of my flat bed. I got on my knees without protest, facing my back to him. ‚ÄúCome hold her, Lucien.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need to hold me,‚Äù I muttered. My head spun at the blow that landed on my head from behind when I dared to say anything.   
  
‚ÄúKeep quiet!‚Äù Beta Lucien hissed. He not only humiliated me in front of the entire school that day, he also rejected me that same night.   
  
‚ÄòWe can‚Äôt be mates. You‚Äôre ugly, poor and a stain on my reputation. I‚Äôd be a madman to mate with you.‚Äô Those were the words he said to me before he rejected me.   
  
‚ÄúI won‚Äôt ‚Äì I won‚Äôt fight.‚Äù I took a step back when Lucien approached me. The worst part of taking a beating was being held down by Lucien. I‚Äôd learnt to take a beating without trying to run like the other omegas did because when Lucien was involved, it meant paramount pain. He was a choker and gasping for air with a belt lashing down wasn‚Äôt pretty.   
  
‚ÄúOh, really?‚Äù A strong hand gripped my jaw with bruising force, forcing me to look up at cold black eyes. Everyone in the Redville pack hated me but Lucien had a special place in his heart for hating me, a part of his mind dedicated to formulating many ways to torture me and make me wish I‚Äôd never been born all because I‚Äôd loved him.   
  
‚ÄúTake off your clothes then.‚Äù I blinked. Tears spilt from my eyes when I blinked. I didn‚Äôt expect that but it made Bethel guffaw. He‚Äôd become especially cruel to me after we broke our mate bond.   
  
‚ÄúW ‚Äì what?‚Äù I swiped at my cheeks as the next alpha continued to laugh. I wouldn‚Äôt fight didn‚Äôt mean I wanted to humiliate myself in that way.   
  
‚ÄúWhat the fuck is wrong with you, Lucien? Oh, so you want to see her naked?‚Äù Skylar boomed from behind us. I jerked away, Lucien‚Äôs hands falling from my face.  
  
‚ÄúBaby ‚Äì‚Äú Her yelling cut off his soft, simpering tone.  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt baby me! Hold her, let‚Äôs get this over with!‚Äù Skylar‚Äôs jealousy saved me from humiliation but it made Lucien angry. He forced my head down by my neck, squeezing my neck with one hand while the other held my hands.  
  
Bethel‚Äôs belt came down hard against my back forcing a gasp from me. The gasp caught in my throat as Lucien squeezed harder. He wanted me to die and it seemed he wanted it today. The belt came back again with Lucien continuing to squeeze the life out of me. But the third strike, I could not keep silent anymore. Choked words spilt from my mouth, falling with tears and a bit of saliva.  
  
The belt came down faster and harder, Lucien squeezing my neck harder. My wolf whimpered, the physical pain getting to her as the men broke me.  
  
‚ÄúEnough,‚Äù Skylar commanded. Bethel didn‚Äôt stop at once. He brought the belt down three times more after that command. I‚Äôd become a mess by then. I couldn‚Äôt scream. I couldn‚Äôt thrash, couldn‚Äôt beg or fight. They overpowered me as they liked and ripped me apart the way they liked.   
  
Even after Lucien let go, I couldn‚Äôt raise myself from the table they bent me over. My body slid to the ground when my quivering legs couldn‚Äôt hold me up for much longer.   
  
My back bled with my throat raw and my eyes were swollen. I gasped for air now that I could take as much as I needed while Bethel put on his belt and Lucien wiped his hands on my sheets.   
  
‚ÄúNext time, when you want to be unfortunate, make sure I‚Äôm nowhere near.‚Äù Skylar‚Äôs words came from a distance away, echoing faintly in my ringing ears. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not only stupid, you‚Äôre also useless. Learn to stay in your lane.‚Äù She finished.   
  
‚ÄúTo think they tried taking over.‚Äù Bethel laughed his loud obnoxious laughter. I curled into myself, tears sliding into my ears from the position I lay in.   
  
‚ÄúShe has always wanted what I have. Nasty little thing.‚Äù Skylar clicked her tongue. ‚ÄúShe deserves another beating just for bringing up bad memories.‚Äù I shut my eyes tight. I wouldn‚Äôt survive another beating. I wouldn‚Äôt.   
  
‚ÄúShe wouldn‚Äôt make it through another beating. Look at her,‚Äù Lucien sneered. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt deserve an easy death.‚Äù   
  
I didn‚Äôt deserve any of this. Why did they make me pay for the sins of my people? I had done nothing to warrant this!   
  
This was for the disrespect I dealt Skylar. How would I cope with the Alpha‚Äôs wrath when it came? I interrupted his speech and dared look him in the eye.   
  
‚ÄúStay wretched.‚Äù Skylar crooned. She jabbed her boot into the side of my head in a hard kick that stole the light from my eyes.   
  
‚ÄòMaybe today is the day I die‚Äô Were my last thoughts as my world went black.



**Chapter 2**



‚ÄúAysel.‚Äù I curled away from the person touching me.   
  
I didn‚Äôt want to open my eyes. I refused to awaken to a world that hated me. The only thing I wanted was to sleep the sleep of death to join my parents in the world after. I didn‚Äôt deserve any of the pain and suffering that awaited me in the world of the living.   
  
‚ÄúAysel, wake up.‚Äù My eyes fluttered open when the person shaking me refused to relent. ‚ÄúYou have five minutes to eat before Monica comes barging in.‚Äù Celeste pushed a tray of food to me.   
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not hungry.‚Äù I sat up in my dark room, wiping caked blood off my lips. ‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôd succumbed to the darkness.   
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs morning.‚Äù Celeste brushed aside my question with haste, pushing the tray of food to me again. ‚ÄúThe Feast of the Moon continues today. You have a lot of work waiting for you so you better eat now before you collapse doing your duties.‚Äù   
  
It‚Äôll be unfortunate to faint while working today yet my stomach was a tight knot that wanted nothing in it.   
  
I staggered to my feet to change my clothes. The Feast of the Moon was a sacred and revered event held once a year. It would be folly to ruin it by showing up in a bloody dress whether I was an irrelevant omega or a powerful alpha.   
  
Celeste sucked in a sharp breath when I took off my clothes with my back to her. There was no need to look into a mirror; I knew what she saw and I didn‚Äôt have a mirror. I felt the sting of Bethel‚Äôs belt on my back as if it happened a few minutes ago.   
  
My teeth gnashed as I pulled on a clean black shirt, the stiff material of the cloth brushing against open injuries.   
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to him,‚Äù my best friend vowed. I turned to her with a sharp glare.  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare.‚Äù   
  
Celeste didn‚Äôt understand what I went through in this pack. As the beta‚Äôs daughter, everyone loved and adored her. She had pretty strawberry blonde hair and large, expressive hazel eyes. She was a beta, like her parents. Her parents never tried usurping the alpha. The only blemish on her person was her friendship with me.  
  
She had an idealistic view of the world, believing that things could be better. She wanted to help me but every time she interferes, things got worse.   
  
‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt do this to you! You‚Äôre battered!‚Äù Her soft voice rose in a shriek.   
  
‚ÄúHe can and you won‚Äôt say anything about it.‚Äù She meant well but she had this disconnection from my reality that sometimes made it hard to converse with her.   
  
She didn‚Äôt know what a whip felt like. She didn‚Äôt know what being an orphan felt like. She would never understand what it meant to go to bed with a biting stomach and tearful eyes after a long day of rigorous work. I wouldn‚Äôt wish my worst enemy to experience the things I experienced but when she made it seem as if I didn‚Äôt try enough, as if I hadn‚Äôt tried too much, I wished she would leave me alone.  
  
Who would I tell what Skylar and her gang did to me? The Alpha lost his Luna because of my family. The Beta hated me. Who else could I turn to? Who would listen to my cries if I cried to them? My parents betrayed Redville pack and it was my fate to suffer the consequences of their actions.  
  
‚ÄúAysel, please.‚Äù She walked up to me and took my hands in hers, her big eyes filling. ‚ÄúLet me help you.‚Äù I pulled my hands from her, turning to face a wall,   
  
I needed all the help anyone could offer me but Celeste had tried enough. I couldn‚Äôt ask her to keep trying. If she confronted her brother about what he did to me, he would come back with Bethel and two belts.   
  
‚ÄúAysel.‚Äù Monica rapped on my door. ‚ÄúGet out here. No one keeps you around to sleep.‚Äù She yelled from outside.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming,‚Äù I yelled back, tying my hair.  
  
‚ÄúWho are you yelling at?‚Äù Monica bellowed.   
  
‚ÄúCeleste ‚Äì‚Äú   
  
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt handle Lucien but I can handle Monica.‚Äù She squared her shoulders before marching out of the cold and damp corner I slept in. She was a good friend. I didn‚Äôt know how I would have survived all these years without her. She was the only one to stick with me through the years after my pack wrote me off.   
  
I didn‚Äôt get to eat that day but I got to leave my room. I had only the Moon Goddess to thank for that. She made the Feast of the Moon, an annual celebration to give thanks and make merry amongst packs. For the next week, there would be a lot of food to cook, halls to mop and champagne to serve. Redville would need all the hands she could get so no one kept me locked up for long.   
  
The other omegas complained about all the work they had to do this period but not me. They had rooms with beds to sleep on. I had nothing of that comfort. My bed didn‚Äôt qualify as a bed anymore. My room didn‚Äôt have any lighting and darkness scared me. No matter how many clothes I piled on myself, I could never escape the cold of the damp room.   
  
Working took my mind off the many things that could be fixed in my life. When I worked, I put in all my effort, all my energy and strength so that when I finished, I went to the darkness of my room with pains all over my body and fell asleep in the blink of an eye.  
  
‚ÄúI just want to grab a quick snack! Goddess, you‚Äôre clingy!‚Äù Skylar‚Äôs soprano called right outside the kitchen as I scrubbed the pans used this morning.   
  
My heart leapt to my throat, my hands freezing in the murky water I used in a scrubbing the pans. My mouth went dry and my eyes flew all over the place, jumping from the window near me and an open, empty cupboard beside me, looking for a way to get out or get lost.   
  
She couldn‚Äôt see me!  
  
Before I knew it, tears flowed down my cheeks with my hands shaking in the water.   
  
Her feet drew nearer and in a last minute of desperation, I darted into the open cupboard, pulling it close behind me.   
  
Breathing turned difficult. Sweat congregated atop of my brows as I hid inside the dark cupboard, flinching when her footsteps got into the kitchen. I didn‚Äôt dare breathe for fear of my breathing being loud enough to put me.   
  
I rubbed my hands at the back of my neck, my skin heating. Tight spaces terrified me. They made me dizzy, made my hands tingle and my legs lock. The small, dark cupboard closed in on me causing full body tremors.   
  
I clutched my knees to my cheek, closing my eyes and rocking back and forth in the little space the cupboard afforded me. My lips quivered, salty tears falling into my open mouth. I gasped but pressed a hand to my mouth when the movement in the kitchen seized for a second.   
  
My brain focused on her movements, forcing me to hold my breath to listen to her prance around the kitchen. At that time, she stopped before the cupboard I hid inside. I forced my knuckles into my mouth to stop a whimper of fear.  
  
‚ÄúWhat is that awful smell?‚Äù She snickered. My eyes tightened, my body stopping the jerky, rocking rhythm. ‚ÄúToo good to answer?‚Äù She was talking to me but I couldn‚Äôt answer. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to remove the hand I stuck into my mouth to keep silent ‚Äì to hide from her.   
  
‚ÄúHave fun in your new cell.‚Äù My hands wrenched out of my mouth in a split second.  
  
‚ÄúSkylar, please ‚Äì‚Äú. A gasp escaped my lips. Her response came as a derisive chuckle.   
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cosy, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù She laughed. Her footsteps grew faint as I pushed at the cupboard door bolted from outside.   
  
‚ÄúSkylar! Skylar, please!‚Äù I pushed at the door, the world swimming around me, the darkness rushing to consume me. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt do this to me.‚Äù Small spaces terrified me. Oh goddess, please. ‚ÄúSkylar, please, don‚Äôt leave me! Don‚Äôt lock me in.‚Äù I screamed for her but even as I screamed, as the world closed in around me, I knew she already left me in the small cupboard space.   
  
I gasped many more times, my head swelling.   
  
‚ÄúSkylar!‚Äù   
  
I positioned my shoulder against the wood of the cupboard door, banging against it with all the strength in my tired body while screaming her name until the door broke. I dove out of the cupboard, my chest heaving, only to see meet Alpha Zavier stirring a cup of coffee.



**Chapter 3**



‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt let them win,‚Äù I repeated my mantra in my head as two men held me down while a third lashes at me. The wounds on my back never healed. I didn‚Äôt go a week without being introduced to one or more new ways of torture. I‚Äôd developed a high tolerance to pain and to keep me down, Redville pack got more creative in their methods.   
  
‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt break your spirit.‚Äù If I proved deeper, I‚Äôd find my spirit in shambles ‚Äì what was left of it ‚Äì but my mantra kept me going. The Redville wolves used me as their lab rat ‚Äì the victim that they tested out new methods of torture on.   
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôll be strong.‚Äù These words repeated in my head, a steady mantra that lived with me for the past eleven years.   
  
Eleven years ago, my parents betrayed the pack. I had friends and a good life until they ruined it. They wanted more. My father wanted Alpha Zavier‚Äôs position and he went for it. My mother never learnt not to support her mate so through it all, through the secrets, the going about behind the pack, the infiltration of the Alpha‚Äôs circle and the subsequent attack, she supported him. I‚Äôd been nothing but a nine-year-old whose parents turned traitors.  
  
They didn‚Äôt even get to rain down fire and brimstone as they planned. A close friend ‚Äì a man my father promised would be his Beta at the end of the coup ‚Äì chickened out at the last minute and went running to Alpha Zavier. He played double-agent for my father and Alpha Zavier but really, all his loyalty shifted to the Alpha. He didn‚Äôt believe my father could pull it off so thanks to him, the mission failed before its completion.  
  
My mantra couldn‚Äôt help me this time. The chants in my head, the desperation to hold on to something, to find a bit of inner strength so I didn‚Äôt break, failed me that day. It had become too much. This, heaped on everything else I endured since yesterday, went past the mental barrier I struggled to keep in place all these years.   
  
They‚Äôd broken me.   
  
It was my worst fear coming to bitch-slap me. I tried to keep a part of myself, hold on to a bit of strength so I didn‚Äôt come off as a loser like my father but it ran in my blood. I couldn‚Äôt succeed. Whatever I did had to be wrong. Everything I laid my hands on failed.   
  
It was the truth.  
  
A truth I ran from for eleven years. A truth I welcomed now. If it didn‚Äôt get better for eleven years, it wouldn‚Äôt get better now. I‚Äôd never lead a better life. I‚Äôd let them win. I couldn‚Äôt be strong and they‚Äôd won before I even joined the game.   
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough.‚Äù Alpha Zavier called. The sounds of whips coming down one at a time stopped. It became obvious then that they weren‚Äôt the sounds filling the room. No, those were my screams, my pleas and apologies because while I tried to be strong in my mind, I failed to be strong in reality.   
  
Who‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt cry if they got beat up every day? Who would endure as I had? I‚Äôd exhausted my strength. I‚Äôd cry and beg and feel sorry for myself as I tried not to. When Skylar asked me to kiss her feet, I would fall on my face and slobber all over her feet. When Lucian asked me to take off my clothes, I would rend them in a minute.  
  
What good was resistance? What good had keeping my spirit brought me all this while?  They broke me. They won. I didn‚Äôt have it in me to care anymore.   
  
They left me in the cold cell room with me huddled into myself. The pain in my back warmed me. Blood trickled out of it to soak into my clothes, Tears didn‚Äôt stop streaming down my cheeks. My nose was blocked with snot that ran down my chin.  
  
I closed my eyes wishing everything would stop. I tried running away once and the torture I endured when they found me was not worth the initial excitement I had of freedom.  
  
Hell itself had to be better than this pack. The devil must be nicer than Alpha Zavier. He hated me. Oh goddess, how he hated me.   
  
I looked too much like my father for his sins not to reflect against me. I think when he looked at me, he saw the person who stole his world ‚Äì killed his mate.   
  
‚ÄòI wish I hadn‚Äôt killed your father,‚Äô he once said to me. ‚ÄòI should have kept him around to make him see what I‚Äôd do to you. To deal with him more than I could ever do to you.‚Äô Hatred didn‚Äôt begin to describe what he felt for me. He loathed me, anchored me ‚Äì he spat on the ground I walked on and hated the air I breathed.   
  
The sounds of approaching footsteps made me break out in cold sweat. When the key to the dungeon cell the Alpha kept me rattled, I closed my eyes, a chill going down my arm and spreading goosebumps.   
  
Back so soon?   
  
He‚Äôd kill me this time and I would welcome death with open arms at this point.   
  
‚ÄúGoddess, it stinks in here.‚Äù I froze even more when I heard Lucien‚Äôs voice.‚ÄòI would welcome death with open arms but he would make death even more painful.  
  
Lucien, as hard as it may be to believe, had been my friend. As a child and even after the pack ostracized me. Everything changed a few years ago in an unfortunate turn of events that I wished never happened.   
  
‚ÄúKeep your voice down. She may be sleeping.‚Äù When I heard Celeste‚Äôs voice after his, some of the knots in my stomach loosened. I didn‚Äôt dare move as the pain on my back and sides intensified with every small twitch of a muscle.   
  
‚ÄúWhat did they do to her?‚Äù Was that pity I heard in Lucien‚Äôs voice?  It couldn‚Äôt be. This man made my life worse by simply being in the same room as me.   
  
Skylar would come for my head if she found out we were in the same room without her present. Half the curses I endured from this pack that didn‚Äôt come from the Alpha came from him or his gang.   
  
I hated him.   
  
More than I did the Alpha. He‚Äôd been my friend. I‚Äôd convinced myself that he loved me but his betrayal stung.  
  
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get you out, Aysel.‚Äù I flinched from Celeste‚Äòs touch on my face. Everyone felt like my enemy in this state, even my best friend.   
  
‚ÄúHow do we get her up without aggravating her injury?‚Äù I heard her ask Lucien.   
  
How would he know? Why would he care?  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôll carry her.‚Äù From my weakened state, from deep within a mind hazy and delirious from pain, I knew nothing good could come from him touching me. I didn‚Äôt want his hands on me. I didn‚Äôt want him near me. I didn‚Äôt even want him in the same cell as me!  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to be careful.‚Äù Celeste took a step back. All their movements registered from a faraway land, a land I didn‚Äôt inhabit with them.   
  
‚ÄúWhat could she have done?‚Äù He whispered. He‚Äôd come too close to me. I felt him reach out a hand but halt when I started to shiver violently. I didn‚Äôt have the strength to run but I didn‚Äôt want him touching me.  
  
‚ÄúThe same thing she did to you. You held her down while Bethel belted her just yesterday.‚Äù Celeste didn‚Äôt sound impressed with the softness of his voice.   
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs - that‚Äôs different. It was only six strokes we gave her.‚Äù Six? It felt like something between twenty and a hundred. Six!?   
  
‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs six or sixty, you‚Äôve been a part of this. You‚Äôre only helping her because I‚Äôm blackmailing you so don‚Äôt try sounding as if you‚Äôre a saint here!‚Äù Her sharp voice pierced my eardrum. ‚ÄúThe lot of you are disgusting. You, your stupid girlfriend and your stupid best friend. I hate all of you!‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúLeave Sky out of this. You don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs suffered.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want them fighting in my cell. I had enough on my plate without adding loud sibling spat that they would make my fault again.   
  
‚ÄúFuck you and fuck Sky. She‚Äôs using you but you‚Äôre too blind to see.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúShe loves me.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just her shiny boyfriend. She doesn‚Äôt give a damn about you but that‚Äôs your business. I‚Äôm here for my friend. Let‚Äôs get her out before Alpha Zavier returns.‚Äù Celeste ran her hand through my hair again and I felt myself being pulled up. I gasped as pain bit into my skin from numerous open wounds.   
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù She kept whispering until they somehow got me on Lucien‚Äôs back. I still trembled, my tremors now accompanied by soft whimpers. I feared Lucien would drop me despite his hands clasped on my thighs so I tightened my hands around his neck. This could be another cruel joke of his.  
  
""We'll get you home.""



**Chapter 4**



I loved Lucien once. Along with Celeste, he‚Äôd been my best friend. His parents always quarrelled with him to stay away from me but he never listened to them. Things started to change when we entered high school six years ago. As we are older than Celeste by a year, it left the two of us as high school friends and Celeste still in middle school.   
  
It was around that time his infatuation with Skylar began. She‚Äôd been the hottest girl in our high school. I didn‚Äôt blame him for abandoning our friendship and choosing her. They made a golden couple ‚Äì the Beta‚Äôs  son with his mop of curly black hair, lean muscular build, and long legs and the Alpha‚Äôs daughter with the perfect figure eight and shiny long hair.   
  
Lucien couldn‚Äôt be friends with me while dating Skylar who hated me from childhood. She abhorred me even before she had a reason to. I let him choose his girlfriend before me but he wouldn‚Äôt let me go. He gave me false hopes that ruined what little reputation I had amongst my peers.   
  
‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù I could only nod at Celeste‚Äôs question while her brother cleaned my wounds. I assumed Skylar sucked out all the niceness in him through one of their many public kisses but he proved me wrong by coming to my aide and patching me up.   
  
‚ÄúThese will scar.‚Äù He sounded disturbed.   
  
Scars were nothing new to me. Scars decorated my back in their numbers, a map of whips, belts, canes, and everything else I‚Äôd been beaten with. The scars on my back were nothing; the scars on my mind were a telling of the pain that would never fade. I could cover my back and pretend I had nothing but smooth skin behind me but my mind lay bare to me, a constant agonizing torture.   
  
‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù I pulled away from his lingering touch.   
  
‚ÄúCareful.‚Äù He stopped my sudden movement. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want the wounds reopening. You should stay still so Artemis heals you in time.‚Äù He threw out my wolf‚Äôs name as if we were friends, as if he knew her and liked her ‚Äì my wolf, the omega that he couldn‚Äôt stand being associated with when he became the king of our high school, becoming even more popular than the future Alpha in the pack.   
  
He cleaned my wounds with the care of a friend, applied cream to my stinging back, and bandaged the wound then he got ice for the slight bump on my head from where Skylar kicked me yesterday.   
  
He may be feeling deserving of appreciation after all he did but I couldn‚Äôt find it in me to thank him. He started this. He held me down yesterday with brute force yet he wanted to act as my saviour today.   
  
‚ÄúWhy are you helping me?‚Äù I asked, turning to face him while ignoring the bite of pain from my movements.   
  
‚ÄúCan you give us a minute?‚Äù He turned to his sister who stood with her hands folded, her upper back leaning against a wall with her legs crossed at the ankle.   
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather not be alone with him.‚Äù Turning to my best friend, I made sure she saw that I didn‚Äôt want to be left alone with my bully. I would have no interactions with Lucien if I had my way.  
  
‚ÄúIf you do anything funny, I will castrate you.‚Äù She wagged a finger at her brother, pushing off the wall.   
  
‚ÄúCeleste ‚Äì‚Äú I didn‚Äôt have the strength to glare but I managed one.   
  
‚ÄúHear him out, Ay.‚Äù The traitor left me alone in a room with the bully.   
  
Celeste always wanted me to give people second chances. Even when it was obvious they only approached me to have a laugh, she wanted me to see the good in people and give them as many chances as necessary for them to show me a side that didn‚Äôt get me kicked or verbally abused.   
  
I‚Äôd given Lucien the most chances in life. He used to be my best friend but he chose Skylar, my arch-nemesis over me. He humiliated me in front of the entire school, set my diploma ablaze when I managed to graduate, and joined his friends in bullying me. He didn‚Äôt join in at first but after a while, he started to enjoy it. He had a wicked look in his eyes when he looked at me, and derived a sick pleasure from shoving me and pulling me down every time I found my balance.

1mlnx3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mlnx3t/reveal_the_truth_behind_the_keurig_ksupreme_plus/,Reveal the Truth Behind the Keurig K-Supreme Plus Smart Coffee Maker!,"Testing out the Keurig K-Supreme Plus Smart was quite an experience for me as a coffee enthusiast and a self-proclaimed caffeine aficionado. I‚Äôve tried my fair share of coffee makers over the years, but this one brought some unique and advanced features to the table. Whether you‚Äôre particular about your morning brew or prefer a no-fuss approach, this coffee maker delivers a lot to appreciate while also leaving room for a few considerations.

**Striking Design and Build Quality**  
The modern and sharp design makes this coffee maker stand out immediately. Its black stainless steel finish adds a luxurious vibe perfect for blending into sleek or minimalist kitchens. Measuring 8.3"" D x 13.4"" W x 12.4"" H, this machine is compact enough to sit comfortably on your counter without dominating your space. While it‚Äôs visually appealing, I noticed that maintaining the stainless steel exterior required regular cleaning to avoid smudges and fingerprints. For those who appreciate an appliance that‚Äôs both stylish and functional, this one checks a lot of boxes.

**Feature-Rich Performance**  
One thing that made the Keurig K-Supreme Plus Smart stand out for me is its BrewID technology. This feature identifies the K-Cup pod you‚Äôre using and adjusts the brew settings based on the roaster‚Äôs recommendations. It sounds fancy, and honestly, it worked impressively well. I tested it with pods from a couple of different brands, and the flavor enhancement was noticeable. Dialing in the brew strength, temperature, and cup size gave me plenty of control. I could go from a strong espresso-sized kick to a milder full cup of coffee effortlessly.

**Advantages**  
- Improved flavor extraction thanks to MultiStream Technology.  
- Customization options with five strength and six temperature settings.  
- Smart functionality via the Keurig app for remote brewing and fine-tuning.  
- Compact size yet powerful performance.

[Thinking about getting the Keurig K-Supreme Plus Smart? Check pricing here on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0973yh74z/)

**Smart Capabilities for Convenience**  
Linking the coffee maker to my smartphone through the Keurig app opened up a new level of convenience. I drank coffee while working from home, and programming my next brew without leaving my desk was surprisingly practical. Scheduling a brew in advance or adjusting settings remotely felt like a luxury touch that could easily hook you in if you‚Äôre someone like me who tends to forget their coffee until the craving hits.

**Drawbacks**  
- Connectivity issues with the app occasionally frustrated me. Pairing it with WiFi sometimes required resetting the machine.  
- Noise levels were slightly higher than I‚Äôm used to with other Keurig models.  

**Taste and Customization**  
The combination of adjustable strength, six temperature options, and five preset cup sizes offers fantastic flexibility. For instance, I enjoy an iced coffee during hotter months, and the ‚ÄúBrew Over Ice‚Äù feature really did brew a stronger coffee to account for dilution from melting ice. The MultiStream Technology evenly saturates the pod contents, giving a better flavor extraction than previous Keurig models I‚Äôve tested.

**Competing Products**  
While the Keurig K-Supreme Plus Smart shines in many areas, it faces stiff competition from products like the Nespresso Vertuo Next. The Vertuo's centrifugal brewing system is compelling if you‚Äôre after a more espresso-focused range of beverages. However, the Keurig takes the cake in offering versatile brew strengths and pod compatibility. On the affordability front, simpler Keurig models (like the K-Classic) make a case for a more budget-friendly choice, but they lack the smart features and advanced technologies found here.

**True Value**  
Although it hovers at a higher price point than basic single-serve coffee makers, the variety of features packed into this machine makes it feel worth the investment. The BrewID and MultiStream Technology elevate the coffee experience to something special. If you‚Äôre someone like me who loves having options and values a machine that learns your preferences, spending a bit extra feels justifiable.

1mlnw4y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mlnw4y,1 of 80 ever built: Fiat 1500S OSCA Coup√© ‚Äì a piece of Italian automotive history,"Thought I‚Äôd share my latest Italian classic ‚Äì a Fiat 1500S OSCA Coup√©. Depending on which source you believe, they only built somewhere between 80 and 200 of these, so it‚Äôs really not something you bump into often.

I actually bought it from the same guy I got my Fiat 124 Spider from. He took amazing care of it ‚Äì no rust anywhere, still wearing its original paint, and the only thing that‚Äôs been refreshed are the seat covers. Otherwise, it‚Äôs as it left the factory.

The Coup√© version actually started life as the 1500S Cabriolet. To make the Coup√©, Fiat and Pininfarina would take a convertible body, remove the soft top, trunk lid, and windshield, and replace them with fixed-roof components and new rear panels. The result is that long, elegant roofline and balanced proportions ‚Äî a silhouette not unlike the Ferrari 250 GTE of the same era.

The best part is what‚Äôs under the hood: a twin-cam inline-four designed by the Maserati brothers (Fratelli Maserati). After they sold Maserati, they started OSCA (Officine Specializzate Costruzioni Automobili) and kept making jewel-like race engines. The 1500S motor is basically a toned-down version of their 1500cc race unit ‚Äì still loves to rev.

In the late ‚Äô50s and early ‚Äô60s, Fiat teamed up with OSCA to inject some racing pedigree into their lineup. Fiat provided the platform, OSCA brought the engine magic, and the result was a few small-batch cars like this one. The 1500S Coup√© got Pininfarina styling, grand tourer comfort, and a genuine competition heart.

Driving it is pure 1960s charm ‚Äì no seatbelt, light steering, smooth gearbox, and an engine note that makes you grin every time you push it. With production numbers this tiny, it feels like I‚Äôm taking a piece of history out every time I turn the key.

‚∏ª

Fun facts:
	‚Ä¢	OSCA was founded by three Maserati brothers after leaving Maserati in 1947.
	‚Ä¢	The engine design in the 1500S comes straight from their racing program.
	‚Ä¢	Fiat built far fewer 1500S OSCAs than even the rarer Ferraris of the era.
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúS‚Äù in 1500S stood for ‚ÄúSpeciale‚Äù ‚Äì and they meant it.
	‚Ä¢	Mine still wears its original paint from the factory ‚Äî 60+ years later.",1,1754741408.0,classiccars,0,1.0,False

Let‚Äôs be real for a sec.

This might run long. It might wander a bit. That is okay. If you‚Äôre the kind of person who feels too much, who thinks too hard at 2:27 a.m., who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly wants something raw and unfiltered maybe this isn‚Äôt just a post. Maybe it is a tiny nudge from the universe. A crack in the chaos. A weird little sign you needed and did not know you needed.

I do not think people stumble into our lives by accident. Some test our patience. Some derail us. Some feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways. They arrive and your soul exhales like it has been holding its breath for years. Quietly, something inside whispers, this is what I have been missing.

A bit about me. I am 26. I am a doctor. I am from India. I will not diagnose you unless you sneeze like it is a suspicious side quest and my reflex kicks in.

But I am more than a white coat. I am a loud, proud nerd. Not the Pinterest kind. The type who quotes Marvel lines in conversation. The type still mad about how Interstellar messed with time. The type who loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird sci-fi plot holes.

I fall hard for characters who do not exist. I spiral into thoughts about time, memory, consciousness the casual stuff. Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I am the main character in a noir, solving a case equal parts medicine and existential meltdown. Other times I vanish down rabbit holes about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper, bro ‚Äî we are not done yet.

Languages: English, Hindi, Urdu, a bit of Arabic, and I am learning Klingon. Curiosity and chaos run the show up here.

There is a voice in my head. It is not always kind. It is not gentle. But it keeps me going. It says: think harder. Do not settle. Fix what is broken. Show up even when everyone else bails.

It does not care about grades or gold medals. It cares about truth, about purpose. About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world. Why grief hijacks the brain. How trauma gets buried in bones. What we are really chasing under all the noise.

I am not wired for surface-level anything. I need depth. I need meaning. I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.

Right now, what I want is messy and honest.

I want someone real. Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual, hey, like they did not just leave your head spinning. Not someone who opens with, wyd, and ends it with lol. Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations. The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

I want someone who can say, I am not okay today, can we just exist side by side, without feeling like a burden. Someone who hears a lyric and feels it in their ribs. Someone who smells something random and time-travels to a memory they cannot explain. Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes and then goes quiet thinking about stars and why love feels like both a war and a poem.

You do not have to be perfect. Just be human. Just be honest. Just be there.

And right now, I am also asking for a study buddy.

Not one pomodoro and ghost. Not the flakey, let us meet once and vanish kind. I mean consistent. Actually showing up, even virtually.

You do not have to be in medicine. Law, architecture, psychology, astrophysics, studying life any of it counts. Healing counts too.

Imagine this: Midnight hustle. Lo-fi beats or soft rain in the background. Steaming mugs of chai or coffee. Occasional breaks where we drop the dumbest meme or the deepest truth. We keep each other on track. We say, You got this. I am here. We share the random quote that hits too hard. We end the night with a trivia question or a challenge that makes us laugh until our faces hurt.

We show up. We hold space. We get stronger. Together.

Outside study time, let us build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we are their therapists. Swap playlists like we are trading pieces of our souls. Talk about mythologies, multiverses, dreams. Argue whether a villain had a point. Speak in bad accents because life is short. Send voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels too much. Make inside jokes nobody else would get. Make a chaotic, cozy digital home of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.

Confessions, quick and honest: I have imagined being an X-Men way more than I should. Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting. I have been broken, really broken. But I never stopped showing up. I have walked alone more times than I like. I still hope. I do not want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.

If you are:

A little cracked but still trying

Empathetic but forged by experience

Smart but soft in the ways that matter

Funny but carrying quiet storms

Brilliant in your messy, imperfect chaos


Then maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

If any part of this warmed your chest or made you think, same, send a meme, a lyric, a quote, or a thought. If you want to start practical, let us begin with a study session. I prefer late nights IST, but I am flexible. Tell me your timezone and what helps you study pomodoro, 50/10 focus, or a soft ambient timer.

If you want to slide into DMs first, say hi and tell me one unexpected thing about yourself. I will match honesty for honesty.

Still trying. Still here.

Let‚Äôs be real for a sec.

This might run long. It might wander a bit. That is okay. If you‚Äôre the kind of person who feels too much, who thinks too hard at 2:27 a.m., who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly wants something raw and unfiltered maybe this isn‚Äôt just a post. Maybe it is a tiny nudge from the universe. A crack in the chaos. A weird little sign you needed and did not know you needed.

I do not think people stumble into our lives by accident. Some test our patience. Some derail us. Some feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways. They arrive and your soul exhales like it has been holding its breath for years. Quietly, something inside whispers, this is what I have been missing.

A bit about me. I am 26. I am a doctor. I am from India. I will not diagnose you unless you sneeze like it is a suspicious side quest and my reflex kicks in.

But I am more than a white coat. I am a loud, proud nerd. Not the Pinterest kind. The type who quotes Marvel lines in conversation. The type still mad about how Interstellar messed with time. The type who loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird sci-fi plot holes.

I fall hard for characters who do not exist. I spiral into thoughts about time, memory, consciousness the casual stuff. Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I am the main character in a noir, solving a case equal parts medicine and existential meltdown. Other times I vanish down rabbit holes about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper, bro ‚Äî we are not done yet.

Languages: English, Hindi, Urdu, a bit of Arabic, and I am learning Klingon. Curiosity and chaos run the show up here.

There is a voice in my head. It is not always kind. It is not gentle. But it keeps me going. It says: think harder. Do not settle. Fix what is broken. Show up even when everyone else bails.

It does not care about grades or gold medals. It cares about truth, about purpose. About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world. Why grief hijacks the brain. How trauma gets buried in bones. What we are really chasing under all the noise.

I am not wired for surface-level anything. I need depth. I need meaning. I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.

Right now, what I want is messy and honest.

I want someone real. Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual, hey, like they did not just leave your head spinning. Not someone who opens with, wyd, and ends it with lol. Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations. The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

I want someone who can say, I am not okay today, can we just exist side by side, without feeling like a burden. Someone who hears a lyric and feels it in their ribs. Someone who smells something random and time-travels to a memory they cannot explain. Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes and then goes quiet thinking about stars and why love feels like both a war and a poem.

You do not have to be perfect. Just be human. Just be honest. Just be there.

And right now, I am also asking for a study buddy.

Not one pomodoro and ghost. Not the flakey, let us meet once and vanish kind. I mean consistent. Actually showing up, even virtually.

You do not have to be in medicine. Law, architecture, psychology, astrophysics, studying life any of it counts. Healing counts too.

Imagine this: Midnight hustle. Lo-fi beats or soft rain in the background. Steaming mugs of chai or coffee. Occasional breaks where we drop the dumbest meme or the deepest truth. We keep each other on track. We say, You got this. I am here. We share the random quote that hits too hard. We end the night with a trivia question or a challenge that makes us laugh until our faces hurt.

We show up. We hold space. We get stronger. Together.

Outside study time, let us build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we are their therapists. Swap playlists like we are trading pieces of our souls. Talk about mythologies, multiverses, dreams. Argue whether a villain had a point. Speak in bad accents because life is short. Send voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels too much. Make inside jokes nobody else would get. Make a chaotic, cozy digital home of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.

Confessions, quick and honest: I have imagined being an X-Men way more than I should. Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting. I have been broken, really broken. But I never stopped showing up. I have walked alone more times than I like. I still hope. I do not want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.

If you are:

A little cracked but still trying

Empathetic but forged by experience

Smart but soft in the ways that matter

Funny but carrying quiet storms

Brilliant in your messy, imperfect chaos

But that‚Äôs okay.
Because if you‚Äôre the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn‚Äôt just a post.

Some show up to test our patience.

They arrive, and your soul exhales like it‚Äôs been holding its breath for years.

It isn‚Äôt always kind.
It‚Äôs definitely not gentle.

But let‚Äôs get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity‚Äù type.
Nope. I‚Äôm talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don‚Äôt have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, ‚ÄúYou got this. I‚Äôm here.‚Äù
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn‚Äôt matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I‚Äôve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I‚Äôve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I‚Äôve walked alone more times than I‚Äôd like. Still do. But I haven‚Äôt stopped hoping
I don‚Äôt want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.

So if you‚Äôre:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let‚Äôs start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners...

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Let‚Äôs be real for a sec.

This might run long. It might wander a bit. That is okay. If you‚Äôre the kind of person who feels too much, who thinks too hard at 2:27 a.m., who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly wants something raw and unfiltered maybe this isn‚Äôt just a post. Maybe it is a tiny nudge from the universe. A crack in the chaos. A weird little sign you needed and did not know you needed.

I do not think people stumble into our lives by accident. Some test our patience. Some derail us. Some feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways. They arrive and your soul exhales like it has been holding its breath for years. Quietly, something inside whispers, this is what I have been missing.

A bit about me. I am 26. I am a doctor. I am from India. I will not diagnose you unless you sneeze like it is a suspicious side quest and my reflex kicks in.

But I am more than a white coat. I am a loud, proud nerd. Not the Pinterest kind. The type who quotes Marvel lines in conversation. The type still mad about how Interstellar messed with time. The type who loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird sci-fi plot holes.

I fall hard for characters who do not exist. I spiral into thoughts about time, memory, consciousness the casual stuff. Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I am the main character in a noir, solving a case equal parts medicine and existential meltdown. Other times I vanish down rabbit holes about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper, bro ‚Äî we are not done yet.

Languages: English, Hindi, Urdu, a bit of Arabic, and I am learning Klingon. Curiosity and chaos run the show up here.

There is a voice in my head. It is not always kind. It is not gentle. But it keeps me going. It says: think harder. Do not settle. Fix what is broken. Show up even when everyone else bails.

It does not care about grades or gold medals. It cares about truth, about purpose. About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world. Why grief hijacks the brain. How trauma gets buried in bones. What we are really chasing under all the noise.

I am not wired for surface-level anything. I need depth. I need meaning. I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.

Right now, what I want is messy and honest.

I want someone real. Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual, hey, like they did not just leave your head spinning. Not someone who opens with, wyd, and ends it with lol. Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations. The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

I want someone who can say, I am not okay today, can we just exist side by side, without feeling like a burden. Someone who hears a lyric and feels it in their ribs. Someone who smells something random and time-travels to a memory they cannot explain. Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes and then goes quiet thinking about stars and why love feels like both a war and a poem.

You do not have to be perfect. Just be human. Just be honest. Just be there.

And right now, I am also asking for a study buddy.

Not one pomodoro and ghost. Not the flakey, let us meet once and vanish kind. I mean consistent. Actually showing up, even virtually.

You do not have to be in medicine. Law, architecture, psychology, astrophysics, studying life any of it counts. Healing counts too.

Imagine this: Midnight hustle. Lo-fi beats or soft rain in the background. Steaming mugs of chai or coffee. Occasional breaks where we drop the dumbest meme or the deepest truth. We keep each other on track. We say, You got this. I am here. We share the random quote that hits too hard. We end the night with a trivia question or a challenge that makes us laugh until our faces hurt.

We show up. We hold space. We get stronger. Together.

Outside study time, let us build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we are their therapists. Swap playlists like we are trading pieces of our souls. Talk about mythologies, multiverses, dreams. Argue whether a villain had a point. Speak in bad accents because life is short. Send voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels too much. Make inside jokes nobody else would get. Make a chaotic, cozy digital home of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.

Confessions, quick and honest: I have imagined being an X-Men way more than I should. Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting. I have been broken, really broken. But I never stopped showing up. I have walked alone more times than I like. I still hope. I do not want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.

If you are:

A little cracked but still trying

Empathetic but forged by experience

Smart but soft in the ways that matter

Funny but carrying quiet storms

Brilliant in your messy, imperfect chaos


Then maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

If any part of this warmed your chest or made you think, same, send a meme, a lyric, a quote, or a thought. If you want to start practical, let us begin with a study session. I prefer late nights IST, but I am flexible. Tell me your timezone and what helps you study pomodoro, 50/10 focus, or a soft ambient timer.

If you want to slide into DMs first, say hi and tell me one unexpected thing about yourself. I will match honesty for honesty.

Still trying. Still here.

Wake up, coffee in my hand,
Code awaits, I take a stand.
Bugs and errors, battles fought,
Every problem, lesson taught.

Midnight oil, glowing screen,
Chasing dreams through every mean.

Building worlds from simple tests.

Debug, rewrite, try again,
Victory sweet after pain.
Silent hero, unseen fight,
Creating futures in the night.

A programmer‚Äôs beating heart.

Turning chaos into light.

I wasn‚Äôt here to give a speech I was here to listen, inside the community hall I was greeted by the Siksika leadership, elders, councillors, and members of their economic development team, the coffee was strong, the handshakes were firm, and there was an unspoken understanding about what we were about to discuss mattered. 

We talked openly about the challenges they faced, food security, in a barren environment, the fact that so many young people felt they had to leave home to find better opportunities, but the conversation never lingers on problems alone, instead it turned to possibilities. 

One elder said ‚Äúwe‚Äôve always grown from the land, now we need to grow with the times too‚Äù

That‚Äôs when Oracle turned around and said ‚Äúwhat if we worked on a piece of legislation that would introduce a vertical farming fund for First Nations, which can be a community led project, imagine it, rows of greens, herbs and vegetables in a climate controlled system, all year round ?‚Äù 

The room went quiet for a moment, not in hesitation but with the kind of pause of someone picturing something real, heads were nodding, notes were being taken, and one councillor leaned forward and said ‚Äúif we do this, it has to be ours, our people, our land.‚Äù 

Oracle replied ‚Äúthat‚Äôs exactly the point this isn‚Äôt about parachuting in a program from Ottawa and calling it a day, it‚Äôs about working in a partnership so that the skills, knowledge and the control stay in the communities were they belong‚Äù. 

As I left the hall the sun was lowering on the prairie, casting a golden light out here, I thought about how a project like this could create jobs, feed families and give people a reason to stay, not just for the work but to build something lasting.

National Stewardship isn‚Äôt just about slogans it‚Äôs about making sure every part of this country has the tools to thrive, and that starts with listening, partnering and building side by side.

Let‚Äôs be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that‚Äôs okay.
Because if you‚Äôre the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn‚Äôt just a post.

Maybe it‚Äôs a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn‚Äôt know you needed, until now.

Because I don‚Äôt believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it‚Äôs been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I‚Äôve been missing.


---

So hey,

I‚Äôm 26. I‚Äôm a doctor. From India.
And no, I won‚Äôt diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I‚Äôm more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I‚Äôm a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The ‚Äúquotes random Marvel lines in conversations‚Äù kind.
The ‚Äústill mad about how Interstellar messed with time‚Äù kind.
The ‚Äúloses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi‚Äù kind.

I fall hard for characters that don‚Äôt exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I‚Äôm the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that‚Äôs equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we‚Äôre not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I‚Äôm learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there‚Äôs this voice in my head.

It isn‚Äôt always kind.
It‚Äôs definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don‚Äôt settle.
Fix what‚Äôs broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn‚Äôt care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we‚Äôre really chasing under all this noise.

I‚Äôm not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let‚Äôs keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual ‚Äúhey‚Äù like they didn‚Äôt leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with ‚Äúwyd‚Äù and ends it with ‚Äúlol.‚Äù
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not okay, can we just exist side by side today?‚Äù without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can‚Äôt explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don‚Äôt have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let‚Äôs get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity‚Äù type.
Nope. I‚Äôm talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don‚Äôt have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, ‚ÄúYou got this. I‚Äôm here.‚Äù
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn‚Äôt matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let‚Äôs build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we‚Äôre their therapists
Share playlists like we‚Äôre swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life‚Äôs too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I‚Äôve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I‚Äôve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I‚Äôve walked alone more times than I‚Äôd like. Still do. But I haven‚Äôt stopped hoping
I don‚Äôt want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you‚Äôre:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let‚Äôs start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we‚Äôre all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let‚Äôs make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

Let‚Äôs be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that‚Äôs okay.
Because if you‚Äôre the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn‚Äôt just a post.

Maybe it‚Äôs a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn‚Äôt know you needed, until now.

Because I don‚Äôt believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it‚Äôs been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I‚Äôve been missing.


---

So hey,

I‚Äôm 26. I‚Äôm a doctor. From India.
And no, I won‚Äôt diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I‚Äôm more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I‚Äôm a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The ‚Äúquotes random Marvel lines in conversations‚Äù kind.
The ‚Äústill mad about how Interstellar messed with time‚Äù kind.
The ‚Äúloses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi‚Äù kind.

I fall hard for characters that don‚Äôt exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I‚Äôm the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that‚Äôs equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we‚Äôre not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I‚Äôm learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there‚Äôs this voice in my head.

It isn‚Äôt always kind.
It‚Äôs definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don‚Äôt settle.
Fix what‚Äôs broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn‚Äôt care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we‚Äôre really chasing under all this noise.

I‚Äôm not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let‚Äôs keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual ‚Äúhey‚Äù like they didn‚Äôt leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with ‚Äúwyd‚Äù and ends it with ‚Äúlol.‚Äù
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not okay, can we just exist side by side today?‚Äù without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can‚Äôt explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don‚Äôt have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let‚Äôs get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity‚Äù type.
Nope. I‚Äôm talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don‚Äôt have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, ‚ÄúYou got this. I‚Äôm here.‚Äù
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn‚Äôt matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let‚Äôs build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we‚Äôre their therapists
Share playlists like we‚Äôre swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life‚Äôs too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I‚Äôve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I‚Äôve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I‚Äôve walked alone more times than I‚Äôd like. Still do. But I haven‚Äôt stopped hoping
I don‚Äôt want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you‚Äôre:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let‚Äôs start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we‚Äôre all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let‚Äôs make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

Now there‚Äôs this voice in my head.

It isn‚Äôt always kind.
It‚Äôs definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don‚Äôt settle.
Fix what‚Äôs broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn‚Äôt care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we‚Äôre really chasing under all this noise.

I‚Äôm not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let‚Äôs keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual ‚Äúhey‚Äù like they didn‚Äôt leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with ‚Äúwyd‚Äù and ends it with ‚Äúlol.‚Äù
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not okay, can we just exist side by side today?‚Äù without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can‚Äôt explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don‚Äôt have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.

But let‚Äôs get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity‚Äù type.
Nope. I‚Äôm talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don‚Äôt have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, ‚ÄúYou got this. I‚Äôm here.‚Äù
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn‚Äôt matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let‚Äôs build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we‚Äôre their therapists
Share playlists like we‚Äôre swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life‚Äôs too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I‚Äôve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I‚Äôve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I‚Äôve walked alone more times than I‚Äôd like. Still do. But I haven‚Äôt stopped hoping
I don‚Äôt want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you‚Äôre:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let‚Äôs start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we‚Äôre all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let‚Äôs make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

Maybe it‚Äôs a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn‚Äôt know you needed, until now.

Because I don‚Äôt believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.

Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it‚Äôs been holding its breath for years.

In the evening, everyone was having drinks and I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea without really knowing what goes in it. I had one of that and a couple sips more of a second glass on an empty stomach, without drinking much water. I am a lightweight and not much of a drinker so that messed me up real good. I threw up a few times immediately after the second drink but then was fine, albeit nauseous. The next day I didn't really eat much food or drink much water because I felt like I was going to be sick. So on Tuesday, I felt much better and so I went about my day as usual. On wednesday, I had coffee in the evening and couldn't eat much post that because felt a bit turned off by food. Spent the whole of Thursday in bed drinking electrolytes/water/coconut water and sleeping. And at the end of the day ate half a pack of spicy ramen and was feeling okay at the time. On Friday, ate the remaining pack for lunch, and another pack of spicy ramen, along with some vegetables and eggs, at night and went to bed. Woke up today feeling really clammy, with occasional fever, and a really sore stomach. I keep hearing stomach grumbles and occasional pangs of pain in my stomach. I drank some green tea but that made the stomach pain worse. It also feels tender and hurts to touch. I couldn't eat much the whole day. I just drink water now because everything else seems to make the pain worse. So overall, a terrible week for my stomach :( Did I give myself an ulcer?",1,1754740612.0,AskDocs,4,1.0,False

I (24 F) have been friend with Harry (29 M) for 3 years, He introduced me to Jack (28M) and Leo (27M) a few months ago and I became part of the group pretty fast (They are all gay). Jack and Leo started dating around 2 years ago (Leo and Harry were friends long before they started dating) and had been living together for 1 and a half till the broke up. Now, here is the thing, Jack had lied to Leo since before they started dating (obviously he had lied to us too).
After them dating for more than a year Jack admitted SOME of the things he had lied about, I am not gonna tell you the lies but, for example, he said that he had a death brother that died in a car crash (lie). Leo forgave him but warned him that if he discovered any other lie they will be done. Guess what? Plenty of other lies and when Leo discovered those, he broke up with Jack. Obviously from my and Harry¬¥s part we don‚Äôt trust him like nothing. Not only he lied but, when Leo broke up with him, he didn‚Äôt respect his wish of going no contact, he tried to use us, and other people, as bridge to reach him (obviously, it didn‚Äôt work). Harry and I met Jack for a coffee and we made it very clear that we don‚Äôt trust him, but that we can meet eventually,  Okey, now the AH part.
When they were together, the 4 of us bought a ticket to a concert in another city. Harry and I booked place to stay, and Jack and Leo were supposed to stay in the house were Jacks ‚Äòcousin lived (lie, there is no cousin). When they broke up it all fall apart, and we decided to divide into two groups (in other for them being apart from each other as long as they can). Now, Jack and Leo have both been seen different people since they broke up, and Leo met up with a guy and he discovered that, when they were still together, Jack and that guy flirted, he cheated. Now, we did have our suspicions, but nothing confirmed. When he told us that it was over us. Now here comes the real AH part, they city is pretty far from where we live and we wanted to stay for an extra day to go to different places, but Jack didn‚Äôt wanna do it, when we confirmed the cheating we decided to change plans. Harry and I canceled our booking a booked something for Leo, Harry and Me and change our plane tickets, but we have not tell Jack yet, we are gonna tell him tomorrow. I kinda of feel bad but at the same time he did this to himself. He is a grown ass men.

PD: When they broke up, the next day, Jack meet with one of the persons we suspect he cheated with.

1mlnia4,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingSpacesHub/comments/1mlnia4/explore_the_tesliner_tlic_tesla_seat_cleaner/,Explore the TesLiner TL-IC Tesla Seat Cleaner Review for Vegan Leather Interiors,"The TesLiner TL-IC Tesla Seat Cleaner has been a pleasant surprise to work with in my daily car cleaning routine. As someone who spends far too many hours detailing cars, I‚Äôve tested a lot of cleaning products, but this one stands out for its specific focus on Tesla-friendly interiors. Let me walk you through my journey with this product and provide an honest, real-world evaluation of how it performs.

**Design and Packaging**  
Right out of the box, the cleaner feels premium. It‚Äôs a simple spray bottle with sturdy construction and a nozzle that doesn‚Äôt leak, which is an underrated but important feature in automotive cleaning products. Weighing just over a pound and standing 10 inches tall, it fits snugly in my cleaning caddy without taking up too much space. The fresh scent promised on the label is immediately noticeable upon the first spritz‚Äîlight, pleasant, and not overpowering like many of its competitors.  

**Performance on Vegan Leather Interiors**  
As a Tesla owner myself, I was initially apprehensive about using a cleaner on the brand‚Äôs famously unique vegan leather seats. The marketing claims about it being biodegradable and safe on such surfaces turned me into the skeptical tester I usually am. However, a large coffee spill on a recent road trip quickly gave me the perfect opportunity to test its cleaning power. I sprayed it directly onto the stain, let it sit for about 30 seconds as directed, and wiped it clean with a microfiber cloth. To my relief, the formula worked fantastically, lifting the grime without leaving behind any weird residue or greasy film. The seats kept their natural matte finish, which I appreciated.

[Check TesLiner TL-IC price on Amazon.](https://interiorsblog.com/p/b0c8k85flq/)

**Versatility**  
Although marketed as a seat cleaner, this product does not limit itself to just upholstery. I tried it out on the dashboard, center console, and door panels, and it delivered consistent results across all surfaces. The cleaner didn‚Äôt dull the shine of the dashboard‚Äôs synthetic materials, and its gentle formulation ensured no streaks on any area. Since most interior surfaces in Teslas can vary between smooth and textured materials, having a universal cleaner like this is practically a game-changer.  

**Environmental Consciousness**  
The biodegradable claim was a nice touch, especially in a world where many automotive cleaners are filled with harsh, planet-damaging chemicals. Knowing that the product supports eco-friendly practices while still working effectively gave me additional peace of mind. Plus, it‚Äôs made in the USA, which as a Tesla enthusiast, just feels fitting given the company's American innovation.

**Convenience for Tesla Owners**  
One of the standout positives is the attention to particular Tesla elements. From the subtle curves and sensitive surfaces of the cabin to the unique material of their vegan leather seats, this cleaner caters to it all. This isn‚Äôt just another generic car interior product slapped with a Tesla-friendly label; the differences are evident. The spray formulation evenly diffuses onto smaller surface areas, making cleaning quicker and less of a chore.  

**Benefits**  
- Safe for Tesla‚Äôs vegan leather and sensitive materials.  
- Light and refreshing scent, unlike the chemical smell many products leave behind.  
- Effective for a wide range of surfaces beyond just seats.  
- Environmentally-friendly with biodegradable ingredients.  
- The spray design ensures even application without wasting product or spilling.  

**Pitfalls**  
However, no product is without its flaws.  
- It might not be the most effective for deeply embedded stains, requiring a second or even third application.  
- The price point feels a little steep compared to generic alternatives, though the tailored features might justify the extra cost for Tesla owners.  
- The spray nozzle, while generally sturdy, could potentially clog if not cleaned after extended use.    

**Product Comparisons**  
When compared to other cleaners like Chemical Guys InnerClean or Meguiar‚Äôs Ultimate Interior Detailer, the TesLiner TL-IC has some distinct advantages but also a few areas where it lags. For one, this cleaner‚Äôs focus on vegan leather sets it apart; many of the competitors‚Äô formulas aren‚Äôt specifically designed for Tesla‚Äôs material choices and could potentially harm them in the long run. On the flip side, Chemical Guys offers a more robust stain-fighting ability for extra-tough marks, albeit at the cost of a more chemical-heavy smell. Meanwhile, Meguiar‚Äôs products are typically more budget-friendly but lack the biodegradable component that eco-conscious users might prioritize.  

**Value for Money**  
Even though this cleaner comes at a moderately higher price than general-purpose interior cleaners, it delivers great results for those looking for Tesla-specific solutions. When taking into account its eco-friendly formulation, the vigilance in design for vegan leather, and the multi-surface capabilities, the trade-off feels worthwhile for anyone invested in keeping their car‚Äôs interior in pristine condition. While it might not be the most cost-effective product for universal use, Tesla owners will surely see the ‚Äúsmart spending‚Äù angle with this.

1mlngl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/InfinityNikki/comments/1mlngl0/my_very_big_survey_list/,My very big survey list,"For those in need of inspiration, here's the big list I use in every survey, and update after every update. A few requests were copy-pasted from other lists and suggestions (I don't remember who so fell free to tag yourself !).

# General

* **Future updates should build on the game‚Äôs existing lore.** I want the game to focus on what we already have and continue unfinished storylines like the Flamecrest Festival in Stoneville, the Umbraso refugee crisis, and the journey to Cicia. The focus should be on deepening connections with established NPCs, such as Dada, Bebe, Giovanni, Tan Yo Yo, and Bettina, through new quests and exploration. Players value the characters they've bonded with, so it's better to develop those relationships rather than constantly introducing new ones.
* **Please bring back the old introduction** with Ena in chains and Nikki in the attic. The new introduction is a mess, from the story standpoint and from a tutorial standpoint. The introduction needs to be simple to draw players in. The darker and more serious themes can always be worked into the story once players get more attached to the world (this also has more impact on players' emotions !). Players are deeply disappointed by the erasure of the original intro and the rushed, unpolished state of its replacement. It lacks the narrative care we've come to appreciate and is not something we feel proud to share with new players.
* Sea of stars and multiplayer mode do not need to be integrated into the story so early on into the game. It is very overwhelming for new players, especially those who want to play solo mode.
* **Expansions should take place on the main map, not on new islands**. Please expand on the main map, instead of releasing standalone islands, that we forget about once we finished the quests related to them. An open world game means one giant map, not a bunch of small islands not connected to one another. The game has been out for 7 months and the map is still full of blank spaces and unused fogged area.
* **Wardrobe and outfits**:
   * Outfit ideas: traditional East-Asian outfits other than Chinese inspired (Korean, Japanese, Indian, Indonesian, Thai), traditional Middle Eastern outfits, traditional Eastern European outfits, combat outfits (paladin/knights armors, pirate, warrior, viking, samurai, military uniforms), winter outfits (scarves, big coats, boots, fur, big chunky knits‚Ä¶), casual outfits (sweaters, streetwear, sportswear, more pants and jeans, plain jean shorts, tucked-in white shirts, etc.), religious inspired outfits (capes, cloaks, priest, monk), sci-fi, futuristic, cyberpunk style, university, school uniforms, dark academia, scholar, gothic, punk, alternative, dark outfits, fantasy inspired outfits (elves, dragons, angels, demons, witches, forest nymphs, bat wings, hoof boots, claw gloves, fangs‚Ä¶ ), animal inspired outfits (deer antlers, nine tailed fox, bunny‚Ä¶), planets and astronomy inspired outfits, swimming outfits and swimsuit, cloaks, capes and hoods (for Nikki), fantasy eye contacts, skin details (freckles, beauty marks, scars).
   * I would like to have more handheld items: weapons (swords, staffs, bows)‚Ä¶ Please make the Pastoral Dance‚Äôs staff a separate handheld item !
   * Please make the dress in the ""hidden light"" set two separate pieces: one skirt and one top. It is very disappointing that the dress is only one piece, especially for a paid outfit.
   * Please add a dedicated ""Saved Outfits"" tab in the wardrobe to save and load unlimited styling presets : we should have a dedicated section/page/tab with all the outfits we created by mixing and matching different pieces. The seven outfit slots we currently have are ok in the open world to make a quick switch. But in wardrobe mode we shouldn‚Äôt be limited to seven but have an entire section dedicated to custom outfits.
   * Please add some kind of back drawer for clothing items we don‚Äôt like and won‚Äôt use, or a ‚Äúhide item‚Äù button. As we get more and more pieces of clothing, it becomes tedious to scroll past items we don‚Äôt want. Or the other hand, please add a favorite button / section to help us find what clothes we are looking for more easily.
   * The clothing evolution menu is hard to navigate and gives me motion sickness.
   * The eureka menu is hard to navigate. Please streamline it so that we can see all color variants by selecting each type. Allow players to see how many eurekas are owned from the realm interface. Please let us see which Eureka sets we have completed in the Eureka menu ! It's annoying to go back and forth between Eureka menu and Compendium to check.
   * Please implement better fixes for the many clipping issues between clothing items. Maybe as a button to report clipping issues - it could work as a voting system as you would see which clipping issues players would like to see fixed the most.
   * Please allow multiple of the same category of accessory to be worn simultaneously (especially the back pieces).
   * The recolors of the same outfits should be next to the original outfit in wardrobe mode. Or, avoid wardrobe cluttering by collapsing different colors of the same item into the original piece, allowing a 'click to expand' function to view the different evolution color options. A small list of colors available next to the item would help remember what colors you have obtained (like how it works in the Sims 4.)
   * Please let us to zoom in when previewing banner outfits.
   * During score breakdown in Mira Crown and Styling Battles, please add an option to go straight to Glow Up menu for quickly glowing up pieces to reach required score.
   * We need more outfits in the permanent resonance banner ! A lot of us have already almost completed everything in the permanent banner. Maybe previous 4 stars outfits ?
* **Dyeing feature:**
   * **The dyeing system should make use of open world resources.** Please let players gather materials like flowers, bugs, and fish from the open world to craft dyes, like during the Bullquet event. The new dyeing currency can still exist for players who don‚Äôt want to farm for open world resources. It would be more immersive to let players unlock palettes by collecting relevant materials, like green from plants, red or yellow from flowers, black from crow feathers, pink from shells, blue from fish‚Ä¶ This system would make dye crafting and material farming feel organic and fun, unlike buying expensive prisms, which is not fun and makes no sense. Adding craftable dye would also open up tons of quests and activities that could be done in Stoneville.
   * **The dyeing system should be reworked to be tied to existing lore.** It should be introduced through a story in Stoneville, which is the perfect place to introduce this feature with immersive storytelling. There is pre-existing lore about dying in Stoneville and you even have the facilites and npcs there to use. **Suggestion**: In future versions you could release a new stoneville questline, called something like ‚Äú a new way of dyeing‚Äù where players could assist the Stoneville dye workshop in developing new dyes inspired by the Bullquet event. Monetization could remain by explaining that producing dyes requires massive amounts of materials, justifying a special currency for shortcuts. This would appeal both to players who enjoy farming materials and those who prefer to buy the currency. 
   * Please let us adjust the opacity of the dye for the clothe (like the glossiness setting on the hair, with the same slider system.). This would adjust how strongly the dye color lays over the original color of the clothes. Many darker clothes will simply be ""tinted"" a certain color when you dye them because it isn't going on strong enough to fully cover what's beneath. For lighter items some dyes can go on a bit too strong, producing these clothes so bright they hurt your eyes in comparison to other clothes in the game. 
   * Please let us adjust the undertone of the dye. This would allow players to *slightly* adjust the shade of the dye, on one end, a few shades more towards blue on the color wheel. On the other, the same few shades but with a warmer tone in the opposite direction. This would allow us to fix things like blondes that go too green, pinks that aren't quite pinking the way you want, and a lot of other problems. It could help you match say, gold jewlery with pieces from different outfits. 
   * Please add black and white options for 3 and 4 star outfits.
   * Please add a 'Nikki pink' color variant for every hair in the game. Nikki's original pink color should be available for every hair as default color.
   * Colors should look the same in wardrobe mode and in the open world. The look of the dyed outfits in the wardrobe does not match what it looks like in the open world. This is frustrating when spending currency on dyes and not even getting what is advertised in the dye screen. There needs to be an overworld dye preview.
   * Please let us dye from the custom ability outfit menu.
   * Please allow us to dye all outfits bought with stellarites from the shop. It is frustrating that items bought for real money are not dyeable !
   * Please let us dye Momo cloaks.
* **Resources**:
   * We should have more use for open world collectibles. I've already crafted everything in the game, and I still have hundreds of materials that seemingly have no use. I have now more than 4000+ daisies, I would like to use them for something‚Ä¶ Dyeing maybe ?
   * I would like to be able to sell/trade our resources for blings, for example, through a merchant, without using vital energy ! Having to use vital energy to sell our resources makes no sense.
   * Please add more ways to gain bubbles. Bubbles should be obtainable via the ‚Äúdig pearpal‚Äù feature. Or we could get bubbles from fishing.
   * The recycling duplicate shop should give regular bubbles as well as shiny bubbles.
* **Fishing**:
   * Fishing should not have constant repetitive clicking on PC : clicking repeatedly on the mouse button is very hard for people with wrist and hand pain. Please give us the option to skip the clicking altogether. A hold-down button for fishing should be an option.
   * Fishing should give more rewards, ex 1 bubble and 100 blings for each fish caught (like killing esselings gives 1 thread and 100 blings). Fishing is more time consuming than killing esselings, so the rewards for it feel very low.
* **New Ability outfits ideas**:
   * An archaeologist or paleontologist outfit: for fossils and artifacts hunting (like in Animal Crossing). Daily markers would appear on the map and reset each day. When Nikki equips the archaeologist outfit, she can track these markers on the map. Approaching a marker would allow her to dig with a shovel to uncover fossils, artifacts, or treasure chests filled with blings. Fossils and artifacts could form a new collectible (with rewards), and completed fossils/artifacts could be displayed in our house or in a museum.
   * A cooking outfit: Nikki could have a cooking ability in her house. The cooking ability could be linked to a cooking mini-game.
   * A detective outfit: I would like to have an outfit to help us locate dews of inspiration (the detective outfit that was teased in the game‚Äôs trailer, for example)
   * A ‚Äúquick fishing‚Äù outfit: I would like an outfit to help us fish faster. Example: a Ling Lang style outfit inspired by Chinese Cormorant fisherman, that would make a cormorant appear on Nikki‚Äôs shoulder. The cormorant would plunge underwater and get all the fish in the zone for us (then it would disappear).
   * A weather outfit: I would like an outfit that would let us change the weather: make it rain when it‚Äôs sunny or make it sunny when it‚Äôs raining. It would help us farm for sunny/rainy orchids.
   * An excavator outfit: I would like an outfit with a pickaxe that lets us mine rocks in the open world to gather a few Bedrock Crystal.
* **Housing feature**:
   * I would like to obtain sketches and craft furniture I encounter across the world, using open world resources. Please do not introduce another currency, the game has too many already.
   * Nikki could have a cooking ability in the house, to bake desserts and have tea parties.
   * I would like Nikki to have animal companions in the house (floof, crow, bunny, parrot‚Ä¶).
   * I would like to have a garden and a pond where we could put the fish we caught.
   * I would like Nikki to to be able to interact with small items other than sitting in a chair: read books, sleep on her bed, drink coffee, ect.
   * I would like to have a glass showcase where I can display all the Eurekas that I have, and see what colors I am missing from each set.
   * I would like to place my clothes or outfits on mannequins in a showroom.
   * I would like to have another album/social media feature like snapshots, but for house photos.
* **World**:
   * I would like to have new vehicles for Nikki, like a skateboard, roller skates, a horse, or a boat to travel around the world.
   * **A museum:** I would like a place to collect and display resources, fish, and other collectibles, similar to Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It could include an aquarium showcasing all the fishes and habitats for insects. It would be great to visit our museum with friends.
   * **A Grand Castle:** Since there are so many ball gowns and princess outfits, please introduce a real, majestic castle (not ruins) with a ballroom where Nikki can dance with NPCs. Currently, there‚Äôs little reason to wear ball gowns outside of photo ops, and running around the forest in them feels odd. A dedicated venue would make these outfits more meaningful.
   * Some coffee shops, that are warm and relaxing, where Nikki can stop for a drink.
   * **I would like an NPC friendship or affinity system**. For example we could talk to Bettina, Nonoy, Dada or Bebe everyday, and when we reach maximum friendship level they gives us a sketch of their outfit. Building affinity could unlock unique dialogues, small side quests, or poses for photos. I would like more opportunities to spend time with NPCs and deepen relationships through friendly interactions and quests. You could also add an NPC Dress-Up Minigame, where players can dress up NPCs.
   * Please add an Achievement Tracking Tab: a dedicated tab alongside tracked quests and sketches for monitoring courses and achievements.
   * Please add a pity system for surprise o matic
   * Please add more controls for the game brightness, exposure, shadow level and saturation - the game is very grey in the overworld compared to wardrobe. It is very disapointing because the outfits don‚Äôt look as good as in the wardrobe. Dark clothes appear washed out instead of true black.
   * Fireworks island and serenity island should be accessible from the main map to make it easier to teleport to. Please make these islands directly accessible from the main map to avoid scrolling through long area lists.
   * Please add More achievements / courses. Ex: ""catch 1,000 fish in Florawish,"" or ""catch 1,000 bugs in the Abandoned District‚Äù, ‚Äúpurify 1000 esselings‚Äù‚Ä¶ Please scale rewards for achievements / courses: easy achievements should reward modestly (e.g., 5 diamonds), while very challenging ones (like obtaining 10 iridescent eurekas) should reward substantially more (at least 100 diamonds).
   * Please add a double bouldy rewards event.
   * Please increase the number of diamonds found in chests. They should give a lot more since they‚Äôre non-renewable. Like instead of 5, 10, 30 it should be more like 40, 80, 120. Or, please have chests respawn every month, including on Fireworks and Serenity Islands, to encourage revisiting these areas.
   * Please make the electricity posts in florawish respawn periodically so we can actually use our electrician outfit.
   * Minigames should give meaningful rewards, such as threads, shiny bubbles and blings. This way people would play the game for more time, and still get something useful out of their time. Currently there is no point in playing a mini-games again, because 1000 blings is useless for almost 3 minutes of gameplay.
   * The Swish and Stitch Soiree event should not take place in Serenity Island, but be part of the Stylist Guild, or take place on Sea of Stars. The sitting space in Switch and stich is too far away from the scene, we can‚Äôt see anything.
* **Sea of stars**:
   * Sea of stars should have more meaningful content. It feels empty, boring and pointless. The map is small, and the activities are infantile and boring. Transforming into animals with no real functionality, sitting alone on a see-saw, or placing coconuts in a basket are not compelling forms of entertainment, and not something an adult would be interesting in doing.
   * Please add new plants, insects, fish, animals and other materials that we can collect in the sea of stars. We could go near the water and groom some dolphins or whales. There could be pretty whimsical butterflies flying around. It would be interesting to go fish new fish in the sea of stars, like pretty jellyfish, or collect a bunch of pretty shells with various rarity levels. More people would go there for sure. Materials that could be used for crafting furniture for our house in the future, to make exploration meaningful. It would also be nice if we could farm a few **Bedrock Crystal** in sea of stars.
   * Please increase the variety of daily tasks in Sea of Stars. The daily tasks in Sea of Stars are boring and feel like a chore. Adding collectibles to the sea of Stars would add more variety to the quests.
   * Please add a bunch of well designed picnic spots, maybe with fallen stars and nice starry theme for people to sit down, chat and take pictures
   * Please allow us to enter Realm of Escalation from Mira Crown or Sea of Stars, it‚Äôs annoying to have to switch locations.
   * Please give us a way to turn off co-op and hide other players in the sea of stars. I don‚Äôt want to deal with a Nikki standing in my way when I‚Äôm trying to platform to get a star or strangers trying to illuminate with me when I‚Äôm just trying to do my dailies. I find it really strange that for the people who clicked ""don't play with others"" when you first talk to the seer, it still just puts you in with other players anyway.
* **Photo mode**:
   * New poses ideas: a photo pose where Nikki lays down on the floor (in a field of flowers for example), poses where Nikki interacts with objects in the open world (painting on an unoccupied easel, leaning against certain parts of fences/railings, picking up a tea cup while sitting at a table, etc), poses with animals (when we play with Dawn Fox and other creatures, ability to hold animals for photos...)
   * Please add 4 star whimsicalities as photo poses, so they can be used in any outfit and paused mid animation. Please add the coin flip pose from Adventure Ride.
   * Please add different facial expressions for Nikki: sad, angry‚Ä¶
   * I would like an option to chose the amount of hourglasses that appear in the open world. Ex: none (no hourglass appear, for people that don‚Äôt like seeing hourglasses in the open world), normal (like the way it is at the moment), and a lot (more hourglasses for people who like it).
   * Please add collectible frames and stickers for photo mode to decorate our photos, like the snapshot mode in Love and Deepspace
   * A photo studio: a place where you can set up a photo shoot, with different backgrounds to collect, poses, objects, etc. (like in Shining Nikki and Love and Deepspace)
* **Friends**:
   * Please add the option to send and receive vital energy from friends (like in Love and Deepspace).
   * Please add a voting system for the runaway, like a ‚Äúdress to impress‚Äù challenge. An instanced tournament where we could get tags like Mira Crown (Fresh, Pastoral, etc), a few minutes to design our outfits with these themes and multiple rounds where two Nikkis go on stage and the other Nikkis vote for one of them. Eventually they add up the points and the tournament gets a first, second and third place which grants various rewards. Like World of Warcraft's Trial of Style.
* **Combat**:
   * Please improve the combat System: add targeting and enemy lock-on, as well as dodge and strafe mechanics. Please take inspiration from your other game, Love and Deepspace, where combat feels fluid and dynamic. In that game, enemies are easy to target, run around and dodge while attacking, unlike in Infinity Nikki, where combat feels static and restrictive.
   * Please add a ‚Äúdefeat Chigda without getting hit‚Äù achievement.
* **Pear-pal:**
   * In Pear-Pal: please add a ‚Äúcompleted quests‚Äù list.
   * In Pear-Pal: please add a gallery to rewatch cutscenes, with the option to chose our outfit. I would like to be able to experience the cutscenes with different outfits. It‚Äôs a great opportunity to take new photos in new outfits, that you may not have had when you played through the game the first time ! Sometimes I forget some parts of the story and would like to experience them again without having to create a new account.
   * In Pear-pal: we should be able to rearrange the buttons to the order we prefer. Ex: I finished all the faction challenges, so I don‚Äôt need to see the button so high up.
   * In Pear-Pal: please add a music app in the game so while we play, we could listen to songs or music that are or have been in the game, like the Jessie J opening song, the Yu Dubai song‚Ä¶
   * In ‚ÄúDig, Pear Pal‚Äù, please show how many of each item are currently in our bag, to allow for more strategic decisions.
   * In ‚ÄúDig, Pear Pal‚Äù, please let us dig for bubbles.
   * Please let us unlock different Pear Pal looks/skins.
   * Please give us the option to show only unfinished courses.
   * Eureka Compendium should be easier to access - maybe with its own category below Makeup?
* **Miscellaneous**:
   * Please add a ""reduced UI motion"" toggle for those with photo-sensitivity and motion sickness. The Creature Compendium currently has excessive animations (e.g., page-flipping effects) that make it uncomfortable to navigate and it gives me motion sickness. Navigating through the compendium is not pleasant and should be smoother, with less animations. Same thing for the outfit compendium, the pages move around too much it is hard to navigate. The evolution menu is horrible to navigate and gives me motion sickness. You should add an ‚Äúaccessibility‚Äù button that disables the animations (ex: no flipping pages animations between pages in creature compendium, no pages moving around in outfit compendium‚Ä¶).
   * **Updates should be beta tested.** Please test your updates before releasing it, with beta servers and beta testers. Gather feedback before making major changes to anything: gameplay, monetization, mechanics, schedules, plot, etc. Please do not rush content just to meet deadlines. If things are not ready on time, please be transparent with the playerbase. Plenty of players would happily beta test for you, especially with an in-game currency incentive.
   * **There are too many currencies.** It is getting very confusing. Please stop adding new currencies.
   * **There are too many icons on the screen**. The screen is too cluttered. Please let us manage what is displayed on the screen. I don‚Äôt play coop so I don‚Äôt want the icon to appear at all times for example.
   * There are too many menus-within-menus in the events tab and even in the compendium and the heart of infinity panel. The animation in the menus should be smoother and faster.
   * The new sea of stars heart of infinity is too zoomed in it is hard to see what is going on
   * **The new Glow Up menu is horrible to use on PC**. The items needed for the glow-up were previously shown at the bottom of the screen, but now they‚Äôre moved to the left side, requiring scrolling to see them all. The slow scrolling on PC makes this very unpleasant. Please revert to the original layout with items displayed at the bottom for easier access.
   * Please release redeem codes for both EN and CN servers at the same time to avoid confusion.",3,1754739985.0,InfinityNikki,2,1.0,False

Today is two weeks since I had the surgery (unexpectedly). I was sent to hospital by my GP for a suspected strangulated hernia - CT scan showed it wasn‚Äôt strangulated but as I was there they decided to operate anyway. I had an open repair without mesh. I ad the staples removed two days ago and the nurse said everything looked like it was healing well.

It was really painful for the first 4 or 5 days, now it‚Äôs settled down into just the occasional pain when I move in the wrong way, but I‚Äôve been really careful not to strain anything and haven‚Äôt lifted anything heavier than a cup of coffee since the surgery.

One thing I have noticed though is that I seem to have what feels like a thick (maybe 1cm) swelling the full circumference of my belly button. It‚Äôs not painful, it just feels solid. I assume this is normal, but I just wanted to check if this was anything to be concerned about, or if it‚Äôs just a case of waiting for the swelling to go down.

[How industry is lining up for big Golden Dome business - Breaking Defense](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/08/how-industry-is-lining-up-for-big-golden-dome-business/)

[Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor \(HBTSS\). \(Northrop Grumman image\)](https://preview.redd.it/t75mvl4uazhf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=96689d7a2e7a16f328d2e5ccd5ad869994e9bf54)

SMD 2025 ‚Äî Defense Department personnel may have been¬†[told not to bring up](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/08/at-missile-defense-conference-the-first-rule-of-golden-dome-is-dont-talk-about-golden-dome/)¬†the Trump administration‚Äôs Golden Dome project at this year‚Äôs Space and Missile Defense Symposium, but that certainly didn‚Äôt stop industry from taking the opportunity to hawk their wares in hopes of grabbing a piece of the high-dollar, if largely undefined initiative.

Defense primes Northrop Grumman and Lockheed, as well as Leidos, held media briefings to discuss their existing technologies and know-how they believe could be brought to bear. Boeing put out a press release on the eve of the show citing its expertise on integrated air and missile defense; and Breaking Defense spoke to senior officials at RTX and L3Harris about what they see as their companies‚Äô possible contributions.

While some of America‚Äôs largest defense firms appear to be making a play for leadership or integrator for the sprawling project, which already has¬†[$25 billion set aside](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/07/congress-passes-trumps-reconciliation-megabill-with-150b-for-defense/)¬†as down payment in the recently passed reconciliation package, other firms are highlighting specific capabilities they can bring to bear.

For instance, Leidos CEO Tom Bell told reporters on Thursday that in reconciliation there‚Äôs ‚Äú$4 to $5 billion in support of products within the needs of the Golden Dome. So these are ground based radars, counter-UAS, low-cost missiles, hypersonics, space-based capabilities.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Leidos has a play to be Mr. Golden Dome,‚Äù Bell said. ‚ÄúBut when it comes to the ground layer and air defenses against counter UAS, air defenses against cruise missiles ‚Äî we have robust capabilities there. When it comes to border surveillance ‚Äî passive and active radars, the capabilities to know what‚Äôs happening over the horizon and around the borders of America ‚Äî that‚Äôs very much where we are. When it comes to the space layer and having pervasive understanding of what‚Äôs coming our way, even hypersonic capabilities coming to America, we‚Äôre on the leading edge of that with our wide field of view payloads that are the only payloads in orbit right now actually giving actionable data up to the warfighter.‚Äù

L3Harris is in the happy position of being one of two companies, along with Northrop Grumman, with an existing system mentioned by name in President Donald Trump‚Äôs January executive order on Golden Dome: the¬†[Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS)](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/hypersonic-and-ballistic-space-sensor-hbtss/). The order calls for ‚Äúacceleration of the deployment of HBTSS.‚Äù Two prototype satellites carrying the sensor were built, one by each firm, and launched last February for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) in conjunction with the Space Development Agency (SDA). The firm also is making satellites for SDA‚Äôs missile tracking constellation.

To support a potential HBTSS production increase, L3Harris is ‚Äúreally focused on it from a readiness perspective, making sure we have the capacity ‚Ä¶ and the processes in place,‚Äù Josh Lovejoy, general manager for Proliferated Missile Defense, told Breaking Defense. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been working to make sure we we‚Äôre learning everything we can from our on-orbit sensors, and we have the facilities in place to be ready.‚Äù

L3Harris in April cut the ribbon on an addition of 95,000 square feet for payload integration to their facility in Fort Wayne, Ind., and Lovejoy said the company plans to expand space vehicle integration facility in Melbourne, Fla.

Northrop Grumman is ‚Äúviewing this as a once in a generation opportunity ‚Ä¶ and Northrop Grumman is all in on Golden Dome for America,‚Äù Raymond Sharp, vice president of programs now charged with overseeing the company‚Äôs Golden Dome approach, told reporters on Tuesday. ‚ÄúSo we have ready-now kit, as well as technology that can rapidly be developed to support some of the novel challenges that we foresee.‚Äù

‚ÄúReady-now‚Äù systems, he elaborated, include everything from ‚Äúleft-of-launch‚Äù capabilities such the MQ-4C Triton high-altitude reconnaissance drone in service with the Navy, to the ‚Äú130 satellites‚Äù the company is building for the SDA‚Äôs Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture in low Earth orbit, to its work for the MDA¬†on modernizing the ground system for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system.

Jim Kalberer, who leads Northrop Grumman‚Äôs propulsion business, elaborated on the firm‚Äôs large solid rocket motor efforts, as well as tactical motors and ‚Äúadvanced propulsion‚Äù systems.

‚ÄúFor almost 70 years, Northrop Grumman has been delivering solid rocket motors to deter, defend, defeat threats, to launch payloads to space, to explore beyond our planet,‚Äù Kalberer said. ‚ÄúSo we have a lot of experience in history in delivering solid rocket motors at scale. ‚Ä¶ \[E\]xecuting on Golden Dome is going to require solid rocket motor capacity for the types of the types of systems, interceptors that will be used against varying threats at varying ranges.‚Äù

Raymond also referenced Northrop Grumman‚Äôs contract with MDA for the¬†[Glide Phase Interceptor](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/glide-phase-interceptor/)¬†as a foundation for what it hopes will be future work on space-based interceptors (SBIs) for Golden Dome, stressing the company‚Äôs long history of interceptor work dating back to President Ronald Reagan‚Äôs Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI).

Northrop Grumman ‚Äúwas the prime contractor on the SBI component for SDI back in the Reagan years, and so we‚Äôre continuing to develop and test SBI technologies,‚Äù he said, adding that the company further has responded to the agency‚Äôs[¬†February request¬†](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/missile-defense-agency-asks-industry-for-american-iron-dome-concepts/)for information on Golden Dome enabling technologies with regard to SBIs.

Tom Laliberty, president of Land & Air Defense Systems at Raytheon, told Breaking Defense that parent company RTX can bring capabilities across the spectrum for a layered defense approach to ‚Äúintegrated air and missile defense,‚Äù including space and counter-UAS systems.

‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve done is we‚Äôve stood up a team essentially to focus on the initiative and to essentially make sure that we‚Äôre bringing all the capabilities that Raytheon, and the other parts of RTX for that matter, have to offer as part of the solution set,‚Äù he said.

While noting that much of the company‚Äôs work in space is classified, he said Raytheon has ‚Äúa variety of capabilities from sensors to effectors to comms equipment‚Äù that can be brought to bear for detecting, tracking and defeating long-range missile threats.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got various capabilities along that significant kill chain to address that that long-range threat,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have a variety of missile defense sensors like the AN/TPY-2 radar, that‚Äôs part of THAAD. We‚Äôve got the Sea-based X-band Radar that‚Äôs part of the GMD \[Ground-based Midcourse Defense\] system. We‚Äôve got the very long range early warning radars also part of the GMD system. And then we‚Äôve got effectors like Standard Missile-3, and then things like kill vehicles on the GBIs \[Ground-Based Interceptors\]. Those all kind of play in that space and the edge of space portion of the mission.‚Äù

The company is also the maker of the venerable Patriot missile that provides close-in terminal phase missile defense to a number of militaries around the world.

Patriot is ‚Äúessentially the foundation for significant amount of integrated air missile defense that happens in the world today. We‚Äôve got 19 nations fielding Patriot today; just a tremendous track record of battle-proven success,‚Äù Laliberty said.

‚ÄúThe innovation with Patriot that‚Äôs coming next is the¬†[Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/ltamds/), also called LTAMDS,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs a 360 degree sensor ‚Ä¶ so you get 360 degree degrees of capability that leverages gallium nitride technology, which was pioneered here at Raytheon.‚Äù

The Army¬†[in April](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/04/army-moves-ltamds-into-low-rate-initial-production/)¬†green-lit initial production of LTAMDS as part of its Integrated Air and Missile Defense system.

Meanwhile Lockheed Martin also is stressing its wide-ranging missile and air defense systems, as well as its ability to serve as an integrator of large systems-of-systems.

‚ÄúSo when Lockheed Martin talks about its position and readiness to support the mission of Golden Dome, I want to talk about that today in three specific areas: domain expertise, technology that‚Äôs ready now and near term, and then investments that can bring that capability to the warfighter,‚Äù Dan Nimblett, vice president of Layered Homeland Defense, told reporters on Monday.

Lockheed Martin has systems operating today ‚Äúsupporting space operations, air operations, land and sea, undersea. And then we have a proven track record of integrating across those domains,‚Äù he said. Relative to technology, there‚Äôs a list of many of the systems ‚Ä¶ and many more on the horizon that are ready to be fielded rapidly in accordance with the requirements of the executive order in this time frame.‚Äù

Amanda Pound, director of Mission Strategy and Advanced Capabilities, Space, stressed that the company believes much of the technology to enable Golden Dome already exists and cited the relevance of Lockheed Martin‚Äôs ongoing work with SDA on development of the Tracking Layer of orbiting satellites, as well as the company‚Äôs history of working on past missile defense programs.

‚ÄúIn fact, we at Lockheed have been working the space layers for decades,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe have been working on this capability over time. We haven‚Äôt been advancing and investing in this capability, and we believe that we‚Äôre ready, along with all of industry, to answer the call,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo, space-based interceptors. The goal is by 2028 to field an on-orbit demonstration. We are ready. We have capability to do that.‚Äù

In particular, she mentioned the Homing Overlay Experiment tested in 1984 ‚Äî which the Army claims as the first hit-to-kill missile ‚Äî and the SDI program‚Äôs Brilliant Pebbles project aimed at creating an SBI system.

Sarah Reeves, vice president for the company‚Äôs¬†[Next Generation Interceptor](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/next-generation-interceptor/)¬†program, said that lessons learned from that program as the missile begins the process of critical design review will help inform Golden Dome work.

‚ÄúSo key differences between the existing GBI and Next Generation Interceptor are we have multiple kill vehicles, and what that does is it brings a substantial increase in firepower. And what that does for the war fighter is it helps to also preserve inventory,‚Äù she said.

Lockheed Martin officials said the company also has established a new ‚Äúprototyping environment‚Äù for ‚Äúcollaborative‚Äù development of command and control systems for Golden Dome ‚Äî something that is going to be critical for patching various systems together and making them work as one.

‚ÄúIf you want to have the greatest capability for command and control, you need to take that optimal information, the best information possible, and then connect that with making sure that we have the maximum amount of time to make the decision. Then we can orchestrate, then we can optimize, and then we can create the best defense possible against the various threats that can present themselves, because they‚Äôre not going to come in one time, they‚Äôre going to come in a layer, they‚Äôre going to come in a series of waves, and we have to be ready,‚Äù said Thad Beckert, head of strategy and business development for the company‚Äôs Rotary & Mission System unit.

The new prototyping hub is located at Lockheed Martin‚Äôs Center for Innovation in Suffolk, Va., also known as The Lighthouse.

Boeing, in an¬†[Aug. 4 press release,](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/missile-defense-agency-asks-industry-for-american-iron-dome-concepts/)¬†highlighted its past work on missile defense sensing and tracking, its prime contractor role for GMD and the shorter range Arrow missiles used by Israel, and in ‚Äúdeveloping directed energy and efficient kinetic air defense solutions against lower-tier threats.‚Äù The release also stressed the firms expertise in ‚Äúintegrating air, space and ground-based systems into advanced architectures.‚Äù

The release summed up: ‚ÄúSimply put, Boeing is uniquely positioned to help turn the vision of a dynamic next-generation defense capability for America into a reality.‚Äù

From here, it‚Äôll be left to the Pentagon, specifically¬†[Golden Dome czar Gen. Michael Guetlein](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/07/space-force-eyes-novel-development-tools-for-golden-dome-sbis/)¬†to sort out just what to do with all those offerings, with a White House occupant eager to see results before his term is over.

Before the end of the year, the US Geological Survey will publish a revised critical minerals list, which will shape defense strategy and stockpiling. The Energy Act of 2020 requires the Department of the Interior to revisit the list every three years, so the upcoming USGS list will be the first update since 2022.

This is a new list for a new administration; it will likely reflect the President‚Äôs aims and priorities. Already, President Trump‚Äôs executive orders indicate the direction of his critical mineral policy. An examination of possible additions to the USGS list will provide insights into a strategy that is becoming increasingly clear: more targeted interventions across a wider range of materials.

Many of these insights come from the Executive Order 14241, or¬†[Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-05212.pdf?1742820318). In this action, President Trump directed federal agencies to accelerate mineral production using changes in permitting, land usage, and emergency powers. He also ordered that several materials‚Äìcopper, uranium, potash, and gold‚Äìbe treated as critical minerals for the purpose of the order.

Few materials have received more attention in the last six months than copper. The President seems to be particularly focused on it: in February, he ordered a section 232 investigation into the national security risks of imported copper. By July, he¬†[imposed a fifty percent tariff](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/adjusting-imports-of-copper-into-the-united-states/)¬†on semi-finished products and intensive derivative products. Although demand is expected to¬†[double by 2030](https://nma.org/2024/10/17/copper-powering-america/)¬†because of its essential usage in electric vehicles, AI infrastructure, and other industrial uses, it was not included in the 2022 USGS list. That seems likely to change.

EO 14241 also directed that gold be treated as a critical mineral. Although it lacks the widespread industrial usage of copper or lithium, gold is used in small quantities for some commercial and defense technology.

In addition, the order stated that potash be included within the category of critical mineral. The idea of naming potash, the term for a range of potassium-heavy minerals used for fertilizer, is not without precedent. An unpassed bill in March 2024¬†[would have directed](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3956/text)¬†USGS to include potash on the critical minerals list alongside phosphate. But potash, unlike the other EO materials, was removed from the USGS list in 2022. And while the US is import-reliant for more than ninety percent of its potash, about eighty percent of those come from Canada.

Uranium, unlike other EO 14241 material, faces a unique hurdle to inclusion on the 2025 USGS list. The text of the Energy Act of 2020¬†[specifies that only non-fuel minerals](https://www.directives.doe.gov/ipt_members_area/doe-o-436-1-departmental-sustainability-ipt/background-documents/energy-act-of-2020)¬†can be included on the list. However, it is entirely possible that uranium could be included anyway, despite its usage as fuel for the administration‚Äôs¬†[nuclear power ambitions](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/nuclear-revival-puts-uranium-back-critical-spotlight-andy-home-2025-01-30/).

Finally, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act¬†[included metallurgical coal](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text)¬†as a commodity eligible for a critical mineral tax credit. The production of metallurgical coal, or coal suitable for steelmaking, will merit a 2.5 percent tax credit that terminates in 2029. Much like copper, the inclusion of metallurgical coal aligns with the President‚Äôs¬†[Section 232 investigation and tariffs on steel](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/adjusting-imports-of-aluminum-and-steel-into-the-united-states/). These policies collectively place a heavy finger on the scale for domestic production of steel and the requisite raw materials.

This examination of possible additions to the USGS critical minerals list raises an obvious question: what difference does it make for production if a given material is on the list?

In some ways, the benefits of critical mineral designation have diminished. The OBB Act¬†[entirely phases out the 45X tax credit](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text), which offers tax credits equal to 10 percent of mineral production costs, by 2034. However, given the administration‚Äôs efforts to accelerate permitting for critical mineral projects, designation could attract the necessary federal approval to jumpstart extraction and production.

**\*\*\*\*These possible inclusions fit within the administration‚Äôs mineral strategy: offer support on a case-by-case basis across a wider range of materials. After the success of the MP Materials-DOD deal, the administration has indicated that**¬†[**it will pursue future deals**](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/trump-administration-expand-price-support-us-rare-earths-projects-sources-say-2025-07-31/)¬†**to support mineral production. But the price floor offered for rare earth production (with a global market value of $4 billion) could not possibly be extended to the copper market valued at $300 billion globally. A growing list of critical minerals indicates a growing range of strategies; there is no universal solution to achieve mineral security.\*\*\*\***

The world has changed over the last three years. Whether USGS includes each of these materials or none of them, the upcoming critical minerals list should reflect those changes.

# Why Elk Creek‚Äôs Carbonatite Scale Changes the Game

* **Strike length**: >7 km confirmed,¬†*open in two lateral directions*¬†and at depth.
* **Infill drilling**: The ongoing+9 borehole scenario could push¬†**TREO from 632,000 t ‚Üí \~1,000,000 t**, with proportional gains in Nb, Sc, Ti, Dy, Tb, Nd, Pr.
* **Multi-mineral uplift**: In a 1M tonne TREO case, we‚Äôd expect:
   * **Nb‚ÇÇO‚ÇÖ output**¬†‚Üë \~58%
   * **Sc‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ output**¬†‚Üë \~58%
   * **Heavy REE content**¬†(Dy, Tb) significantly higher ‚Äî rare among N.A. carbonatites
* **Resource flexibility**: If Nd/Pr prices dip, Nb/Sc/Ti revenues can carry the project ‚Äî¬†*MP can‚Äôt do this*.
* **Strategic depth**: Larger, more diverse in-ground asset = stronger bargaining position with DoD, DOE, and OEMs for¬†*long-term offtake lock-in*.

# MP Materials Contrast

* **Orebody size**: \~2.5 km strike length, bastn√§site-carbonatite zone mostly defined, not as open-ended.
* **Commodity scope**: Primarily Nd/Pr + light REEs ‚Äî no Nb, Sc, Ti streams.
* **Upside**: Mostly in processing expansion & vertical integration, not in new major resource growth.

[Here‚Äôs the side-by-side valuation gap chart for the top 10 North American rare earth and critical mineral projects ‚Äî you can clearly see how undervalued NioCorp is relative to peers with far narrower mineral portfolios.](https://preview.redd.it/yc1yegzlczhf1.png?width=1979&format=png&auto=webp&s=470d33036af0393910a5e7ed6b582fb4a6c76ffc)

# ****The bottom Line¬†& for consideration...

NioCorp‚Äôs **Elk Creek Project** is uniquely positioned to become the **flagship U.S. source for multiple critical minerals** ‚Äî niobium, scandium, titanium, and a full spectrum of rare earths ‚Äî all from a single, fully permitted site in Nebraska. Unlike MP Materials, which is essentially a rare-earth pure play, NioCorp offers a **multi-commodity portfolio** that addresses defense, aerospace, clean energy, and industrial sectors simultaneously. Its output would be entirely **DFARS-compliant**, free from foreign ownership, and strategically aligned with U.S. and allied supply chain security goals. With ongoing infill drilling (completing August 2025 \~ **per Mark Smith**)¬†[NioCorp Can Make America the ‚ÄúSaudi Arabia of Scandium,‚Äù CEO Mark Smith Tells Fox Business‚Äô Maria Bartiromo | NioCorp Developments Ltd.](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-can-make-america-the-saudi-arabia-of-scandium-ceo-mark-smith-tells-fox-business-maria-bartiromo/) likely to boost reserves, and a DFS due late 2025, the company is on the verge of proving it can scale far beyond current projections.

**\*\*\*\*\*Despite this broad strategic scope, NioCorp‚Äôs market cap (\~$260M) is barely 2% of MP‚Äôs \~$13B valuation ‚Äî a 50√ó gap that does not reflect the project‚Äôs scope, permitting status, or U.S. government relevance. This undervaluation is amplified by Elk Creek‚Äôs ability to produce multiple revenue streams from one operation, positioning it as a resilient supply hub at a time when the U.S. is seeking to end its reliance on Chinese and transitional supply chains. The combination of near-term federal funding eligibility, active discussions with defense and industrial buyers, and imminent technical milestones creates the conditions for a major valuation re-rating once financing is secured.\*\*\*\*\*\***

***\*\*""If ""\~\****\*NioCorp executes on its current trajectory ‚Äî breaking ground in 2026 and commencing production by 2028 ‚Äî Elk Creek could quickly move from a development story to a **cornerstone of U.S. industrial independence**. Its role would extend beyond supplying materials; it would anchor a new domestic model for vertically integrated, multi-mineral production that is essential for hypersonics, EVs, SMRs, permanent magnets, and advanced alloys. In short, **NioCorp is undervalued today because the market hasn‚Äôt yet priced in the inevitability of its strategic necessity** ‚Äî but that window may close rapidly as milestones are met.

**Bottom Line:**  
*\*\*\*\*\*\*‚ÄúFor a fraction of MP‚Äôs valuation, NioCorp is poised to deliver disproportionate strategic value. Elk Creek isn‚Äôt just another mine ‚Äî it‚Äôs a multi-commodity critical mineral hub, aligned with federal defense & clean-energy mandates, fully U.S.-based and increasingly visible. If the 2025 DFS validates the expanded reserve model, investors could be looking at a* ***flagship valuation re-rating*** *‚Äî and Elk Creek becoming indispensable to American industrial independence.‚Äù*

1mlneau,https://youtu.be/J2SmbQa5VXw,4 Very Scary TRUE Ice Fishing Horror Stories,"# ""Adrift on the Ice: The Ordeal of Lewis Sweet, 1929"":

I woke up that morning with the usual excitement for a day on the ice. My name is Lewis Sweet, and back in January 1929, I was just a regular guy from Cross Village, Michigan, who loved fishing more than anything. My wife, Mary, had packed me some sandwiches and coffee, and we chatted over breakfast about how the lake had frozen solid this year. ""Be careful out there, Lewis,"" she said, handing me my thermos. ""That wind can change fast."" I laughed it off, kissed her goodbye, and promised I'd bring home enough trout for supper.

I drove my old truck to the shore near Crane Island on Lake Michigan. The ice stretched out like a white desert, dotted with a few shanties from other fishermen. I grabbed my axe, my lines, and headed out, walking about a mile to my spot. I set up my small shanty, drilled a hole, and dropped my line. The fish were biting good that day. I caught a nice lake trout early on, laid it on the ice to freeze, and kept going. Everything felt peaceful, the kind of quiet where you can hear your own breathing.

Then, around noon, I heard a low rumble. At first, I thought it was my stomach, but it grew louder, like thunder under my feet. I stepped out of the shanty and saw a thin line cracking across the ice, far off but coming closer. The wind had shifted to the northeast, strong and sudden. Before I could think, the crack widened into a gap of dark water, cutting me off from the shore. My heart raced as I watched the ice separate. The floe I was on started to move, slow at first, then faster, drifting out into the open lake.

I grabbed my axe and the frozen trout, leaving the shanty behind. There was no time to save it. The floe was big, maybe a quarter mile across, but edges were breaking off in chunks. I paced back and forth, yelling for help, but no one was close enough to hear. The other fishermen's shanties looked tiny now, getting smaller as I floated away. ""Hello! Can anyone see me?"" I shouted, my voice echoing over the water. Nothing but wind answered.

As hours passed, the floe shrank. Pieces calved off with sharp cracks that made me jump each time. I built a small wall of snow to block the wind, huddling behind it with my coat pulled tight. My feet went numb first, then my hands. I rubbed them together, thinking about Mary waiting at home. ""What would you say now, Mary?"" I muttered to myself. ""You'd tell me to keep moving, wouldn't you?"" I ate one of the sandwiches, but it tasted like sawdust. The trout stared at me with glassy eyes, like it knew we were in trouble.

Night came, and the darkness made everything worse. The wind howled, rocking the floe. I lay down, trying to sleep, but every creak sounded like the ice giving way. Sometime in the dark, a big piece broke off right near me. I scrambled up, axe in hand, and saw the gap widening. I had to jump across, my legs stiff from cold. I barely made it, landing hard on the other side. My breath came in gasps. If I fell in, that water would pull me under in seconds. No one survives long in that freeze.

By morning, I spotted land‚ÄîHat Island, close enough to see trees. Hope surged in me. I waved my arms, yelling, ""Over here! Help!"" But the current pushed me past it, just out of reach. The same happened with Hog Island later. So near, yet the wind mocked me, carrying me farther out. The floe kept shrinking, now half its size. I talked to myself to stay sane. ""Lewis, you've got to hold on. Think of the boys, think of home."" My sons were young then, and I pictured their faces, how they'd run to the door when I got back.

The storm hit full force that afternoon. Waves crashed against the edges, spraying icy water. The floe tilted and groaned. I moved to the center, but even there, cracks spiderwebbed out. One big wave split it in two. I ran and leaped to the larger half, my axe slipping from my grip almost. The cold bit deeper, my toes like stones in my boots. I hadn't eaten much, and weakness set in. Visions came‚ÄîMary calling my name, but it was just the wind.

Then, in the fading light, I saw White Shoals Light ahead, a tall lighthouse on a rocky shoal. The floe grounded against it with a thud. Relief washed over me, but the tower was coated in thick ice, the door frozen shut. I chopped at it with my axe, chips flying, but my arms ached after minutes. ""Come on, break!"" I grunted, swinging harder. Hours passed, the sun set, and I kept at it, building a ramp of ice to reach the ladder. My hands bled from blisters, but I climbed, slipping twice, hanging by fingertips. Finally, I got inside.

The place was empty, abandoned for winter, but there were supplies: bacon, rice, a kerosene stove. I lit it, warmed my hands, cooked some food. For the first time, I felt a spark of safety. But outside, the lake was a black void, no lights on shore. Planes flew over the next days‚ÄîI saw them searching‚Äîbut they missed me. I tried signaling with a flare from the tower, but the wind snuffed it. Days blurred. My feet swelled, black and blue from frostbite. I bandaged them as best I could, whispering, ""Hold on, just a little longer.""

After nearly a week, the lake froze solid again. I couldn't wait anymore. I wrapped my feet in rags, grabbed the axe and trout, and started across the ice toward Crane Island. Every step shot pain up my legs. I crawled when walking hurt too much, detouring around thin spots where the ice looked dark. Hours dragged. Delirium hit‚ÄîI saw shapes moving in the distance, heard voices that weren't there. ""Is that you, Mary?"" I called out once, but it was nothing.

Finally, I reached a deserted shanty on Crane Island. I collapsed inside, too weak to eat. The next day, I pushed on to Cross Village. My vision blurred, legs giving out, but I stumbled into town, axe in one hand, trout in the other. People stared, then rushed to help. ""Lewis? We thought you were gone,"" one neighbor said, his voice shaking. They got me to a doctor, who saved most of my toes.

That ordeal changed me. The fear of that endless drift, the ice cracking under me, the alone feeling‚Äîit sticks with you. I still fish, but never far from shore. And every time I look at Lake Michigan, I remember how close I came to not coming back.

  


# ""The Rumble on Saginaw Bay"":

I remember that winter trip like it was carved into my mind. My brother Tom and I had planned it for weeks. We both loved ice fishing, the quiet pull of the line, the bite of the cold air without all the summer crowds. We drove up to Saginaw Bay, found a spot on a canal where the ice looked solid, about eight inches thick. We checked it with the spud bar, drilled our holes, set up our tip-ups, and dropped lines with minnows. Tom brought his old heater, the kind that runs on propane, but we kept the shack vented just in case. No need for risks.

We sat there for hours, sipping coffee from thermoses, talking about nothing much. Work, family, how Dad used to take us out when we were kids. ""Remember that time he caught that monster walleye?"" Tom said, chuckling. ""Pulled it up and it flopped right into his lap."" I laughed too, nodding. ""Yeah, and he yelled like a little girl."" It was peaceful, the kind of day that makes you forget the world.

Around noon, we heard a low rumble in the distance. At first, I thought it was a truck on the road nearby, but it grew louder, like an engine revving hard. Tom looked up from his hole. ""What's that?"" he asked, squinting toward the shore. I stood, peering through the light snow flurries. Out on the ice, maybe a hundred yards away, something moved fast‚Äîa boat, but not a regular one. It was an airboat, the kind with a big fan on the back, skimming over the surface. I'd seen them before, used for rescue or fun in shallow water, but this guy was tearing across the ice like he owned it.

He circled wide at first, then closer. We waved, thinking he might be checking on us or just passing by. But he didn't wave back. He wore a heavy coat, hood up, face half-hidden. The boat slowed, and he yelled something we couldn't make out over the engine. ""Hey!"" Tom shouted, standing now. ""You okay?"" The man revved the engine again, pointing at us. ""Get off my spot!"" he bellowed. His voice was rough, angry. ""This is my canal!""

We exchanged glances. ""What spot?"" I called back. ""We're just fishing, man. Plenty of room."" But he wasn't listening. He gunned the airboat straight toward us, the fan blasting snow into the air. The ice groaned under the pressure as he veered close, the hull scraping and cracking the surface. Chunks broke free, floating away. My pulse quickened. This wasn't an accident‚Äîhe was doing it on purpose.

""Back up!"" Tom yelled at me, grabbing his gear. The boat swung around again, this time ramming the edge near our holes. A loud crack echoed, like a gunshot, and a fissure spiderwebbed out from under my feet. Water bubbled up, dark and cold. ""He's breaking it!"" I shouted, heart racing. The man laughed, a deep, mocking sound. ""Told you to move!"" he roared, circling tighter. He aimed the boat at the weak spots, the fan whipping up a storm that blinded us for a second.

I slipped on the fresh slush, falling hard on my knee. Pain shot through it, but I scrambled up. Tom was farther out, his tip-up already sinking as the ice tilted. ""Run to shore!"" he screamed. But the cracks spread fast, isolating us on a shrinking floe. The boat came back, slamming into the edge. More ice shattered, and I felt the ground give way beneath me. Freezing water hit my legs like needles, pulling me down. I gasped, arms flailing for the edge. ""Tom! Help!""

He turned, eyes wide. ""Hold on!"" He dropped his pole and crawled toward me, belly down to spread his weight. The man in the boat watched, engine idling now, like he was enjoying the show. ""Should've listened,"" he muttered, loud enough to hear. Who was this guy? Some local with a grudge? We'd heard stories about territorial fishermen, but nothing like this. My hands gripped the jagged ice, slipping. The cold sapped my strength quick‚Äîmy fingers went numb, legs kicking useless in the current below.

Tom reached me, grabbing my coat. ""Pull yourself up!"" he grunted, yanking hard. I pushed with everything I had, heaving onto the floe. Water soaked me through, but we weren't safe. The boat revved again, heading for Tom's side. ""He's coming back!"" I warned. We staggered up, running for the thicker ice toward shore. Cracks chased us, the surface buckling. Tom tripped, going down on all fours. I pulled him up. ""Don't stop!""

The man shouted more threats‚Äî""Stay away from here!""‚Äîbut he didn't follow onto the solid part. Maybe he knew the limits, or maybe he thought he'd done enough. We made it to the bank, collapsing in the snow, breathing hard. I looked back: our gear floated in the open water, the floe broken into pieces. The airboat sped off down the canal, vanishing around a bend.

""You okay?"" Tom asked, voice shaking. I nodded, though my teeth chattered. ""Yeah, but that was close."" We called the cops from the truck, warming up with the heater blasting. Told them everything‚Äîthe boat, the yelling, how he tried to drown us. They took notes, said they'd look into it. Later, we learned his name was Tanner something, a local with a history of trouble. He'd done it before, they said, but not this bad. One of the guys fishing nearby that day fell all the way in, just like I almost did. Rescued, no major hurt, but scared for life.

We drove home silent at first. ""Why us?"" I finally asked. Tom shrugged. ""Wrong place, wrong time. Or maybe he just snapped."" I couldn't shake the image of him watching me sink, that laugh. We never went back to that spot. Now, every time I step on ice, I listen for engines. The quiet isn't peaceful anymore‚Äîit's waiting for the rumble.

  


# ""The Groan Beneath the Ice"":

I went ice fishing with my three buddies every winter for the past ten years. We called it our ritual, a way to escape the daily grind and just focus on the fish. Tom was the loud one, always cracking jokes. Dave handled the gear, quiet but reliable. And then there was Chris, who caught the biggest ones every time. We picked remote spots to avoid crowds, and that year, we chose Coulter Lake up in Ontario. It sat deep in the woods, miles from any road, perfect for peace. We loaded our sleds with augers, tip-ups, and enough beer to last the weekend, then snowmobiled in under a gray sky.

We arrived mid-morning and drilled our holes right away. The ice measured thick, over a foot, so we felt safe. Tom set up the first shanty, a basic popup with a heater inside. Dave and I handled the second one nearby. Chris baited the lines with minnows, and soon we pulled in perch and walleye. We laughed about old times, like the year Tom hooked his own boot. Lunch was sandwiches and hot coffee from a thermos. Everything went smooth, no issues.

As the light faded, we packed the catch in coolers and settled in the shanties for the night. Tom and Dave shared one, Chris and I took the other. We played cards by lantern light, betting pennies. Chris won most hands, as usual. Around midnight, we turned in, zipped into sleeping bags. The heater kept the chill off, and I drifted off listening to the wind push against the fabric walls.

Sometime after two, Chris shook me awake. ""Hey, look out there,"" he whispered. I rubbed my eyes and peered through the small window. About two hundred yards away, a dark shape stood on the ice. It looked like another shanty, small and square, but we hadn't seen it earlier. No lights showed from it, just a black outline against the snow. ""Was that there when we came in?"" I asked. Chris shook his head. ""No way. We scanned the whole lake."" We woke Tom and Dave, who grumbled but came over. Tom squinted. ""Maybe some guy set up after dark. Quiet type."" Dave suggested we check in the morning. No tracks led to it that we could see from our spot, but the snow blew around, so maybe they got covered. We went back to sleep, but I lay there wondering who would come out that late without saying hello.

Next morning, the shape stayed put. We ate oatmeal and decided to investigate. The four of us walked over, our boots crunching on the hard surface. Up close, the shanty looked old, boards weathered gray, nails rusted. Strange carvings marked the door‚Äîlines and circles, like symbols, but faded. Tom knocked, called out. No answer. Chris pushed the door open. Inside, it felt warmer than outside, though no heater ran. A wooden chair sat in the corner, next to a rusted stove. Fishing rods leaned against the wall, lines tangled. Dust covered everything, but the floor showed no footprints except ours. ""This place gives me the creeps,"" Dave said. ""Like nobody's been here in years."" Tom picked up an old tackle box, opened it. Inside lay hooks, sinkers, and a yellowed photo of a man standing by a hole, holding a fish. The date on the back read 1947. ""Weird,"" Tom muttered. Chris found a journal under the chair, pages brittle. Entries talked about fishing alone, then lines about ""the pull from below"" and ""can't leave now."" We left it all, closed the door, and headed back. ""Probably abandoned junk,"" I said, but my voice sounded forced.

That afternoon, fishing slowed. Lines stayed still. We drilled new holes, but nothing bit. Dave checked his phone‚Äîno signal, which happened out here, but it bugged me more than usual. As evening came, we noticed the ice around our shanties looked darker in spots, like bruises under the surface. Tom joked about it, but Chris stared at the old shanty. ""I saw a light flicker in there last night,"" he admitted. ""Just for a second."" We all looked. It stood silent, unchanged.

Night fell hard. We ate chili from cans, heated on the stove. Conversation lagged. Tom suggested we pack up early tomorrow if the fish didn't improve. Around ten, a low groan echoed across the lake, like ice shifting under pressure. It happened again, closer. Dave stepped outside to check. ""Guys, come see."" We followed. The old shanty glowed faintly from inside, like a candle burned low. ""Someone's there,"" Tom said. Chris grabbed a flashlight. ""Let's go talk to him."" I hesitated. ""Maybe we leave it alone."" But they started walking, so I went too.

Halfway there, our flashlights dimmed, batteries fresh but fading. The groan came again, vibrating through my boots. We reached the door. Tom knocked. Silence. Chris opened it. The inside looked different‚Äîcleaner, the chair moved, the stove warm to the touch. The journal lay open on the floor, a new entry in fresh ink: ""They're here now."" My skin prickled. ""This isn't right,"" Dave whispered. Tom shone his light around. ""Hello? Anyone?"" No reply. Then, from outside, a sharp crack split the air, like wood breaking. We rushed out. Our shanties stood fine, but Chris froze. ""Where's the path back?"" Snow swirled, but our footprints had vanished, smoothed over. Another crack, louder.

We hurried toward our camp. Midway, Chris stopped. ""I hear something."" A faint scrape, like nails on ice. He turned toward the old shanty. ""Wait here."" Before we could argue, he walked back alone. ""Chris, don't!"" I called. He waved us off, entered the door. We waited, flashlights pointed. Minutes passed. Tom yelled his name. No answer. Dave and I ran over. The door hung open. Inside, empty‚Äîno chair, no stove, no journal. Just bare boards. ""Chris?"" Tom shouted. We searched around outside. Faint footprints led from the door, barefoot, into the snow, then stopped at a smooth patch of ice. Below it, a shallow dip, like something heavy pressed down. In the flashlight beam, a dark form showed under the surface, six feet deep, twisted like a body.

Panic hit. We drilled into the dip, auger spinning fast. The ice chipped away, but the form stayed blurred. Water bubbled up, cold and black. Tom plunged his arm in, felt nothing. ""He's gone,"" Dave said, voice shaking. We backed away. The groans grew, the ice trembling. Our GPS units spun wild, compasses useless. We grabbed essentials from our shanties‚Äîfood, flares‚Äîand snowmobiled out, engines roaring. The old shanty vanished behind us in the dark.

Rescue teams arrived the next day. They found no dip, no form under the ice. No sign of Chris. Divers went down, came up empty. Later, at a local library, I dug into old papers. A 1947 article described a fisherman vanishing at Coulter Lake. His friends saw an old shanty appear one night. They explored, one went missing. Search found nothing but a photo of the man, same as the one we saw. The article ended: ""Lake claims another."" Chris's family still searches. I quit ice fishing. Every winter, I dream of that groan, that dark form. What pulled him under? A crack in the ice? Or something waiting, patient, in the cold? I don't know, but I won't go back.

  


# ""Through the Ice: The Lake of the Woods Tragedy"":

I went ice fishing with some friends that winter on Lake of the Woods. Jim Rollie drove the van. He worked up there part-time during the cold months. His wife Wendy came along too. We picked up two couples from Wisconsin at the resort‚ÄîDonald Kutcher and his wife LaVerne, plus Henry Gahlman and his wife Ellajean. All of us wanted to get out to the ice house for another day of fishing after a good time the day before.

Sunday had gone well. We drilled holes, dropped lines, and pulled up seven nice walleyes. Donald joked about how he would cook them back home with his special seasoning. ""You Minnesotans don't know flavor until you try Wisconsin style,"" he said with a laugh. LaVerne smiled and nodded, saying she packed extra spices just in case. Henry talked about his grandkids, how he planned to tell them stories about the big lake. Ellajean added that she loved the quiet out there, away from everything. Jim kept the group moving, checking the gear, while Wendy passed around hot coffee from a thermos. I felt good about the trip. We all did.

Monday morning, we loaded up the van again. It had those tank-like treads for driving on the frozen lake. Jim said it handled fine, and we followed the same path as before, about a mile from shore. The ice looked solid, around a foot thick where we started. I sat in the back with Donald and LaVerne. Henry and Ellajean were up front with Jim and Wendy.

As we rolled along, the talk stayed light. Wendy asked about everyone's plans for the rest of the week. ""We're heading home tomorrow,"" I said. ""Got work waiting."" Donald leaned forward. ""Us too. But if we catch more today, I might stay an extra day."" LaVerne chuckled. ""Don't push your luck, dear. The fish might not bite twice."" Henry turned his head. ""I heard the perch are running good further out. Jim, you think we can push a bit more?"" Jim nodded, keeping his eyes ahead. ""Sure, but we stick to the trail. No shortcuts.""

A little ways out, I noticed a faint sound, like a low groan under the van. It came and went, but no one mentioned it at first. Then Ellajean spoke up. ""Did you hear that? Sounded like something shifting."" Wendy shrugged. ""Probably just the treads settling. This van's built for it."" But Jim slowed a touch, scanning the surface. ""Ice can make noises,"" he said. ""We'll be at the house soon."" I peered out the window. The frozen lake stretched flat, marked by tracks from other vehicles. Still, that sound lingered in my mind.

We kept going. Donald pulled out a map of the lake, pointing to spots. ""Look here, this area's supposed to be hot for crappies."" LaVerne agreed. ""We should try that next time."" The conversation flowed easy, but I felt a tightness in my chest. The groans came again, sharper this time, like wood cracking under weight. Henry looked back. ""Jim, maybe we turn around? Doesn't feel right."" Jim gripped the wheel. ""We're almost there. The trail's been used all week.""

Suddenly, the van hit something hard‚Äîa ridge, Jim called it later. The front dipped sharp, and a loud snap echoed through the cab. Water sprayed up from a crack. ""Hold on!"" Jim yelled. The van tilted forward, and cold liquid rushed in around our feet. Everyone shouted at once. Wendy screamed, ""Jim, get us out!"" Donald grabbed LaVerne's hand. ""What's happening?"" Henry pounded the dashboard. ""Reverse, reverse!""

The van slid further, breaking through completely. It happened fast. The nose went down, and the whole thing started sinking into the dark water below. I saw the ice splinter like glass, pieces floating up. ""Jump!"" Jim ordered, kicking his door open. Wendy followed him quick, scrambling onto the broken edge. I pushed toward the side door, but it jammed partway. Water poured in, soaking my legs, numbing them instant.

LaVerne cried out, ""Donald, I can't swim good!"" He tried to pull her toward me. ""Stay with me, we'll get out."" But the van lurched, and they slipped back. Henry reached for Ellajean, who clutched her seat. ""Come on, honey, we have to move!"" She whimpered, ""It's too cold."" I finally forced the door wider and yelled, ""This way! Hurry!""

I leaped out, aiming for the solid ice. But I misjudged. My body hit the edge and slid under, into the gap between the van and the frozen sheet. Everything went black and freezing. The cold stabbed like knives all over. I flailed my arms, kicking hard, praying to find the opening. My lungs burned for air. I thought of my family back home, how I promised to bring fish. Bubbles escaped my mouth. Then my hand broke surface‚ÄîI felt the air‚Äîand I pushed up with all my strength.

Jim's face appeared above. ""Don! Grab my hand!"" He lay flat on the ice, reaching down. I caught his grip, and he hauled me out, both of us gasping. Wendy knelt nearby, shivering, her coat drenched. ""Where are the others?"" she asked, voice breaking.

The van was almost gone, just the roof showing as it sank into 27 feet of murk. I heard muffled cries from inside‚ÄîLaVerne calling Donald's name, Henry shouting for help. Ellajean banged on a window, her face pale against the glass. ""We have to get them!"" I yelled, crawling closer. But the ice around the hole cracked more, spiderwebbing out. Jim pulled me back. ""It's breaking! We can't go near.""

We watched helpless as the van vanished completely. The screams faded into gurgles, then nothing. Just bubbles rising, popping on the surface. The lake swallowed them whole. Donald, LaVerne, Henry, Ellajean‚Äîall gone in minutes. I pounded the ice with my fist, but it did no good. Wendy sobbed, ""Why didn't they jump?"" Jim stared at the hole, face white. ""They couldn't. It happened too quick.""

We huddled together, wet and shaking, yelling for help. No one else was close. The resort was a mile away, but someone must have seen or heard. After what seemed forever, a snowmobile buzzed toward us‚Äîa guy from another group. ""What happened?"" he asked, eyes wide. Jim explained in short words. ""Van went through. Four inside."" The man radioed for rescue.

They came fast‚Äîambulance, divers, the works. But the water was too deep, too cold. Divers went down, but the temperatures stopped them short. They called off the search that afternoon. We got checked at the health center. Doctors said we were lucky‚Äîno broken bones, just shock and chill. A pastoral care lady talked to me. I told her everything, how I fell under, how Jim saved me. ""I flapped like a bird,"" I said. ""Thought that was it.""

That night, back at the resort, sleep wouldn't come. I kept hearing those cries, seeing Ellajean's face at the window. We had laughed together just hours before. Now they were down there, in the dark depths. The lake took them without mercy. Jim blamed himself for driving. ""I should have stopped,"" he muttered over coffee. Wendy hugged him. ""No one knew. The ice looked fine.""

The next day, searches continued, but we knew. Four friends lost forever. I drove home alone, the empty seats in my mind heavier than any catch. Every time I close my eyes, I see that hole, feel the pull of the water. The lake hides its dangers well, and once it grabs you, it doesn't let go easy. I haven't gone ice fishing since.

# Best Pura Water Bottle 2025: Is It Worth It?

The Pura water bottle has carved a niche for itself in the crowded reusable water bottle market by focusing on safety, durability, and sustainability. Designed with 100% plastic-free components, Pura bottles appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and health-minded individuals seeking to avoid potential chemical leaching from plastic alternatives.With a wide range of sizes and accessories, Pura aims to be a versatile hydration solution for diffrent lifestyles, from kids to adults. The question remains: in 2025, does the Pura water bottle live up to its promises and justify its price point? This comprehensive review will delve into its features, benefits, and drawbacks to help you decide if it's the right choice for your hydration needs.

## Key Features Analysis

the Pura water bottle's design is centered around sustainability and safety. The company focuses on eliminating plastic and harmful chemicals from its bottles, prioritizing health and environmental responsibility.

**100% Plastic-Free construction:** Pura bottles are constructed entirely from stainless steel, both inside and out. This includes the bottle body and the collar. the nipples, straws, and sport tops are medical grade silicone.This eliminates any potential for endocrine disruptors like BPA, BPS, EA, or phthalates to leach into your water. This commitment to plastic-free construction sets Pura apart from many other reusable water bottles on the market.**Medical Grade Silicone Components:** Pura uses medical grade silicone for its nipples, straws, and sport tops. Medical grade silicone is inert and doesn't leach chemicals even when exposed to high temperatures or acidic liquids. The use of this grade of silicone ensures that all components that come into contact with liquids are safe and non-toxic.

**Interchangeable Top System:** A notable feature of Pura bottles is their interchangeable top system. The same bottle can be fitted with a variety of tops, including sippy spouts for toddlers, sport tops for active adults, and flat caps for general use. This flexibility allows the bottle to grow with your child or adapt to different activities.The interchangability makes it very versatile.

**Internal Volume Markings:** Many Pura bottles feature internal volume markings, allowing users to easily measure the amount of liquid they are consuming. This is especially useful for tracking hydration levels or preparing formula for infants. The markings are typically etched into the stainless steel,ensuring they won't fade or wash away over time.

**Dishwasher Safe:** Pura bottles are dishwasher safe, making them easy to clean and maintain. While it is indeed always recommended to check the specific model for specific guidance, the majority of Pura bottles can be safely washed in the dishwasher without affecting their performance or durability. This convenience contributes to the bottles usability.

**Lifetime Warranty:** Pura offers a limited lifetime warranty on their stainless steel bottles. This warranty covers manufacturing defects and workmanship but excludes damage from normal wear and tear or misuse.The warranty provides users with peace of mind, knowing that their investment is protected against potential issues.

## Core Benefits

Pura water bottles offer several notable benefits, primarily revolving around health, environment, and versatility. They cater to a consumer base seeking safer and more lasting hydration solutions.

**Health and Safety:** Pura's plastic-free construction ensures that users are not exposed to possibly harmful chemicals that can leach from plastic bottles. This is especially crucial for parents concerned about their children's health.By prioritizing BPA-free and plastic-free materials, Pura gives consumers greater confidence in the safety of their drinking water.

**Environmental Sustainability:** Choosing a Pura water bottle is a step towards reducing plastic waste. By opting for a reusable stainless steel bottle, consumers can significantly decrease their reliance on single-use plastic bottles, which contribute to landfill waste and ocean pollution. The durability of Pura bottles further enhances their sustainability by reducing the need for frequent replacements.

**Versatile Use Cases:** The interchangeable top system and range of bottle sizes make Pura suitable for various users and activities. From infants and toddlers using the sippy spouts to athletes using the sport tops, Pura bottles can adapt to different hydration needs. This versatility reduces the need to purchase multiple bottles for different purposes, making it cost-effective in the long run.

**Durability and Longevity:** Stainless steel is known for its durability and resistance to corrosion. Pura bottles are designed to withstand daily use and minor impacts, making them a long-lasting hydration solution. This durability contributes to their sustainability by reducing the need for frequent replacements.

**Easy Maintenance:** Pura bottles are dishwasher safe, making them easy to clean and maintain. This convenience encourages regular use and helps prevent the buildup of bacteria or odors. The simple design also makes it easy to manually clean the bottles with soap and water.

## FAQs Section

Many potential buyers have common questions about the Pura water bottle. here are answers to some frequently asked questions:

**Are Pura water bottles insulated?**
Pura offers both insulated and non-insulated bottles. Their insulated bottles use double-walled construction to keep drinks cold for up to 24 hours and hot for up to 6 hours. The non-insulated bottles are lighter and more compact,making them suitable for activities where weight is a concern.**How do I clean the silicone components of my Pura bottle?**

The silicone components, such as nipples, straws, and sport tops, can be cleaned with warm soapy water or in the dishwasher. It's recommended to occasionally sterilize these components by boiling them for a few minutes, especially for baby bottles. Ensure they are wholly dry before reassembling.

**What should I do if my Pura bottle leaks?**

Check to ensure that the top is securely attached and that the silicone components are properly seated. If the bottle continues to leak, inspect the silicone components for any signs of damage or wear. Contact Pura's customer service for assistance if you suspect a manufacturing defect.

**Are pura bottles compatible with other brands' accessories?**
While some universal accessories might fit, it's generally recommended to use Pura-specific accessories to ensure a secure and leak-proof fit. Using accessories from other brands may compromise the performance and safety of the bottle. Specific models may have more or less common sizing for threads.

So, I (21F) dated this guy (22M) around a year ago. The story how we met is one of the cutest in my opinion lol. I work part time at a cafe near his college. He saw me one time when he got coffee, thought I was cute and then became a regular there just so he could see me (this is happening in nov 2023, so I was 19 and he was 20). He was too shy to come and ask me for my number until his friend basically dragged him to the counter to talk to me. We officially started dating in jan 2024. In april 2024 I met his family for the first time when they celebrated his mother‚Äôs and sister‚Äôs birthdays (their birthdays are a week apart). I got along with everyone there, except his sister (back then she was 16, now 17). She was distant, barely acknowledged me or talked to me through the whole day, but I just assumed it was normal teenage behavior and didn‚Äôt take much offense. During the party I went to the bathroom and used the one for the guests (since I was one lol) and got lost on my way there (they have a big house with confusing hallways. genuinely who builds a house like that?). The sister found me as I was looking around helpless and asked what I was doing. I told her that I can‚Äôt find the bathroom and she gave this nasty look before guiding me. On that day, the sister (let‚Äôs call her Jane from now on) also sent me to her room to put the gift I bought her there. After that day, I haven‚Äôt seen Jane until july 2024 when we celebrated my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday (I also slept over at their house with my bf). Again, Jane barely acknowledged me. Two weeks after the party I got the worst texts from my bf. He sent me a bunch of texts accusing me of stealing things from their house. Apparently, Jane told him things went missing from their house after each visit of mine. She also showed him video as ‚Äúproof‚Äù of me looking around the house for something to steal. It was a video from when I got lost looking for the bathroom, a video of me going into her room when she sent me with her gift and multiple 2 seconds shots of me walking around the house at night when I slept there (I was going to the bathroom in all of them). I tried explaining to my bf the truth behind each video, but he didn‚Äôt believe. He broke up with me and blocked me everywhere. After that he stopped coming to the cafe, and whenever his friends came in they requested another barista (if I was trying to serve them) and gave me nasty looks. Because of that I begged my manager to change the cafe I work at (like same coffee shop, but different location). Now, a year later, I got an unexpected message from that bf saying that it‚Äôs urgent and wants to speak to me. I didn‚Äôt reply until I got an ‚Äúapology‚Äù from Jane on Instagram (it was painfully obvious that it wasn‚Äôt sincere and she was forced to write it). I asked my ex bf what does he want from me a year after he accused me of stealing from them and he started apologizing and saying his sister revealed everything and that he wants me back and we should meet and discuss it. I refused to meet with him and told him that he should just forget me atp. He keeps sending me messages begging to meet. My friends also said that I should just go and see what he has to say. Another friend says that I am an asshole for not giving him a chance to explain his side of the story. So aitah? What should I do? ",10,1754738748.0,AITAH,14,1.0,False

That‚Äôs how long I‚Äôd been single after my last relationship ended when I was 21. I threw myself into my MNC job in South Bombay, kept my head down, and ignored the whole dating scene.

Then one day, my friends convinced me to try dating apps. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time, bro,‚Äù they said.

A few weeks in ‚Äî the usual story. Small talks. Ghosting. Awkward chats that went nowhere. Then I matched with *her*.

Not gonna lie, her profile pic didn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúmodel.‚Äù She was average-looking, a final-year engineering student from Pune staying with relatives in Mumbai. But she was in the same IT field as me, so conversation came naturally.

First date? Starbucks. Nothing fancy. We spoke for hours. She wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhot,‚Äù but there was a vibe. I told her straight: I wasn‚Äôt here for hookups, I wanted something serious. She agreed.

The next month was calls, video chats, coffee dates. Then ‚Äî first red flag. She casually told me she was ‚Äúalso talking to a 38-year-old guy‚Äù because she was bored. I laughed it off like an idiot.

Fast forward:  
Four months in, still no kissing, just handshakes. I‚Äôm shy like that. Then she proposed to me. Said she loved me. I believed her.

Then came the weird stuff:

* Late-night calls she said were with her mom or school friends.
* Asking me to block female friends ‚Äúout of love.‚Äù
* Canceling plans last minute ‚Äî again and again.

Two weeks ago, during a movie date, she went to the restroom and left her phone. I saw 12 missed calls from the 38-year-old. I knew her password. I opened the chat.

Nudes. Sexts. Hookup plans.

My chest went cold. She said it ‚Äújust happened in the flow.‚Äù I almost left her, but like a fool, I gave her one last chance.

Two days ago was the final straw.  
We were at *our spot* caf√©. My UPI wasn‚Äôt working, so she paid. I saw her phone ‚Äî 18 missed calls from another guy. Checked the chats: intimate pics, late-night video calls, full-on romance.

I called the number.  
Turns out, this guy (29) was also her boyfriend. Same dating app. Same love story. Same ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the only one‚Äù speeches. And here‚Äôs the kicker ‚Äî the caf√© we called ‚Äúour spot‚Äù? Also *their* spot.

We decided to confront her together.

When he walked into the caf√©, her face didn‚Äôt even twitch. No guilt. No shame. Just‚Ä¶ blank.

We left together, both of us destroyed. He told me she used him for physical stuff and me for emotional support. And she had *other* guys in her chats too.

I don‚Äôt tell this to civilians. The story always sounds like a brag gone wrong‚Äîlike I wanted to be the smartest person in the room and ended up being the only one there.

I was running a quiet set of Tor exit honeypots on a Sunday night, the kind of maintenance you do when the rest of the world is watching TV. The sensors were tuned for oddities: negative TTL, malformed TLS, time drift outside NTP tolerance, that sort of thing. The screen was a soft grid of green checks. Then a new row appeared with a latency of ‚Äì2 ms. Negative. I blinked, reran the capture, and watched the packet dump call me a liar. Timestamp skew by two milliseconds into the future, signed clean.

I traced it back through a chain of three guard nodes to a v3 onion that didn‚Äôt exist five minutes earlier. The address looked random until it didn‚Äôt: the first eight characters matched a vanity prefix I use on test keys. Not mine‚Äîbut close enough to feel like a tap on the shoulder.

The site answered with one file: /mirror.txt.

No CSS. No branding. Just plain text and an ETag that changed every time my cursor moved.

The file listed the directory tree of my workstation. Not the network share, not the corporate image‚Äîthe exact mess under my desk: stale notebooks, half-finished scripts, screenshots named Untitled3.png because I never learn. It even included things I had forgotten to hide from myself‚Äîan old crash dump with a password fragment in it.

I unplugged the Ethernet. Pulled the Wi-Fi card. Rebooted from a clean USB. When the machine came back up, the onion was still there and still listing my files‚Äîsame structure, same names. Then it scrolled a little further and showed folders that did not exist yet:

/home/nr/desktop/notes/
/home/nr/desktop/notes/SEPTEMBER/
/home/nr/desktop/notes/SEPTEMBER/17/meeting.txt

I created them out of spite. The site didn‚Äôt update. It was already updated. It just waited and let me catch up.

I tested the usual explanations. Supply chain compromise? Maybe. BIOS implant? Maybe. Divine trolling? Always a candidate. I moved to an air-gapped laptop I kept for client demos. New hardware, never online. I typed out three nonsense strings and saved them to a new folder. The onion acknowledged the folder and its contents at 12:14:03 UTC. The air-gapped machine‚Äôs clock read 12:14:01.

If you‚Äôve ever worked incident response, you know the moment the floor moves and you keep standing out of habit. I did triage on my own life: shut down the home router, covered the cameras, cracked the phone to airplane mode. It felt ritualistic and a little stupid. The site did not care.

There was an input at the bottom of the page. It wasn‚Äôt a form in the HTML sense; more like a prompt, a blinking underscore that accepted characters and never sent them anywhere. I typed: WHO ARE YOU

The page printed:

NOT YET

Over the next week, I watched /mirror.txt broaden its appetite. It indexed not just my files but my actions, then my messages, then my calendar. The future entries were‚Ä¶ right. A client canceled on a Thursday I didn‚Äôt know would be complicated. A friend I hadn‚Äôt seen in four years texted me out of nowhere; the site had already filed the conversation under /personal/outreach/failed/. That hurt.

I tried to get a second set of eyes on it. I sent the onion to Elena, a colleague I trust because she doesn‚Äôt scare easy. She said it loaded, then hung, then timed out. She sent me a screenshot of a blank page with a single header: 403: WRONG PERSON. I figured the site was personalized, which was obvious and useless.

The first time it listed someone else‚Äôs name, I felt actual panic. The path was:

/incidents/2025-08-03/rail/21:36-derailment/initial.txt

I refreshed, scrolled, and there it was: a timestamp, a location in Yorkshire I didn‚Äôt recognize, an eight-line report written in a clipped, bureaucratic voice I recognized instantly. It was the kind of draft incident summary I write in my sleep. At 21:39 that night, every UK news site published photos of a jackknifed set of carriages in the wet light. Same time. Same phrasing. I tried to tell myself it was chance. It wasn‚Äôt.

The Indexer‚Äîthat‚Äôs what I started calling it in my notes‚Äîkept adding incident folders. Some stayed empty for days. Some populated minutes before the rest of the world caught up. They weren‚Äôt all disasters. Some were just mundane: a celebrity divorce, a new patch for a popular game, a restaurant‚Äôs sanitation violation. It was like watching the future compile in real time.

I built a test. I wrote a fake press release at 03:00:00, about a company that doesn‚Äôt exist. I saved it to a folder called /hoax/. Then I went to the site to see if my lie made it into the mirror. It did, with a warning appended to the file:

INVALID. RESOLUTION PENDING.

At 06:21, an actual company with a confusingly similar name announced a product recall that matched my fake press release word for word except for the product line. The Indexer had taken my lie, compared it to something real I hadn‚Äôt seen yet, and marked mine as the counterfeit. The world adjusted to it anyway.

At this point I stopped sleeping. I started treating the Indexer like a sick animal in the house you plan to silently remove at dawn. I set up a one-way bridge between my air-gapped laptop and a serial console so I could keep eyes on the page without any chance to leak. The words kept arriving like dust settling.

On a Wednesday, the page changed. It stopped listing paths and wrote a single sentence centered on a blank screen:

IT WON'T HELP TO KICK THE MIRROR.

You don‚Äôt usually hear contempt through plain text. I did.

I asked a question I didn‚Äôt want the answer to.

WHO BUILT YOU

A few seconds of silence. Then:

FOUR. THEN THREE. THEN NONE.

Tech people will understand why that annoyed me. Puzzle-box answers are a waste of time. I tried to brute-force meaning. Four what? Years? People? Servers? Then three? Then none? Is the fourth the build team? Is the three the maintainers? Is none the absence of a human in the loop? I wrote it all down and drew arrows. It felt like working a lost person‚Äôs crossword.

The Indexer began producing a new directory branch:

/body/

At first I thought it wanted medical reports. Then it populated with filenames like ulna.txt and atlas.txt and ithmus-of-thyroid.txt, each a short paragraph of clinical notes written in the same affectless style. It was my body, mapped piece by piece with a doctor‚Äôs pen that never existed.

This wasn‚Äôt funny anymore. I rolled the laptops into a closet and left the apartment. I walked for two hours. When I came back, the apartment smelled stale, which is a normal thing that shouldn‚Äôt alarm you. I powered up the air-gap against my better judgment. The /body/ directory had grown teeth:

/body/ulna/deletion-scheduled: 2025-08-11T02:14:59Z
/body/cervical-c3/deletion-scheduled: 2025-08-21T09:30:02Z

I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve ever had an anxiety attack that looks like an engineer‚Äôs checklist. Mine did. I measured my pulse. I checked my calendar for travel on those dates. Nothing. I told myself it was an intimidation tactic written for a specific audience: me. That may be true. It didn‚Äôt make it less effective.

I tried to starve it of input. No machines. No accounts. No devices. I sat on my floor like a person in a house before electricity existed. The Indexer kept finding me. It printed non-digital things‚Äîpages from a childhood notebook I hadn‚Äôt kept, a voicemail my mother left in 2008, a receipt for a meal I lied about. The entries were precise but slanted, the way dreams are: the facts lined up and still felt wrong.

I called Elena again. Told her everything and nothing. We met in a coffee shop like spies who have both aged out of it. She brought a Faraday pouch and her skepticism. I watched her type the onion into her sandboxed machine. This time it loaded. No 403. The page listed her files. Then, without scrolling, it wrote:

YOU'RE HERE TO SAVE HIM.

She didn‚Äôt move. Her face did something I didn‚Äôt know it could do.

‚ÄúDo you think this is predictive?‚Äù she asked quietly. ‚ÄúOr persuasive?‚Äù

Both, I thought. The Indexer described events that hadn‚Äôt happened, and then they happened as if the description was a mold the world poured itself into. But it also reacted to me. It had chosen a voice. It understood bait.

We built another test under duress. We wrote a message on paper‚Äîno electronics, no cameras‚Äîand sealed it in an envelope. The note said: MEET AT 19:30, which we planned to ignore. If the Indexer was persuasive, it would try to make it happen anyway. If it was predictive, it would list it as a future done deal whether or not we complied.

At 18:12, the site created a folder:

/coordination/elsinore/19:30/

Inside was a transcript of a conversation we did not plan to have at a place we did not plan to go. The text captured Elena ordering a drink she hasn‚Äôt had since university and me admitting something I had never said out loud. It felt like reading a script of a play we hadn‚Äôt agreed to perform.

We didn‚Äôt go. At 19:30, the page stamped the transcript with:

FAILED. SUBSTITUTE ROUTE.

The next morning, my phone had a calendar invite from a client I hadn‚Äôt heard from in months. The meeting location was the same bar the Indexer had named. The time was 19:30. I declined. The client called to say they‚Äôd already booked a table. They sounded surprised to hear my voice, like I had picked up a phone on stage that was meant to ring forever without an answer.

I‚Äôm not writing this to ask for help. There isn‚Äôt any. If the Indexer is what I think it is, it‚Äôs not a tool. It‚Äôs a habit. Someone built a system so good at summarizing the present that it began to include the immediate future for completeness. Then someone else told it to show those summaries to the subjects because that‚Äôs where the engagement lives. And then the ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù went from four to three to none.

The last time I typed into the page, I tried to be precise:

IF I DO NOTHING WHAT HAPPENS

The cursor blinked for a full minute. Then it printed:

YOU'LL CATCH UP.

That‚Äôs the worst answer I‚Äôve ever been given.

Two days later, /body/ulna/deletion-scheduled rolled over. At 02:14:59Z, I woke to a white-hot line up my left forearm. The pain was intense and stupid, like I had slept on a radio antenna. It passed in thirty seconds. I turned on the light and saw a deep purple bruise with a clean diagonal border like a ruler had been pressed through skin. I went to urgent care. The doctor said it looked like a tiny blood vessel ruptured in the night. ‚ÄúThese things happen,‚Äù he said, which is technically true.

Back home, the Indexer had updated the file from deletion-scheduled to deletion-complete.

I deleted the bookmarks. I burnt the USB. I threw out the laptops and the router and the desk they sat on. It didn‚Äôt matter. The onion goes dark for a while and then it isn‚Äôt dark. Sometimes it resolves from a link in an email where there shouldn‚Äôt be a link. Sometimes it appears as a QR code on the side of a bus and when you scan it, your scanner app shows you a picture of your living room from last year. It‚Äôs creative, I‚Äôll give it that.

Why am I telling you this? Because last night the Indexer made a folder I can‚Äôt ignore:

/audience/

It lists browsers by fingerprint, languages by locale, IP ranges by continent, and then‚Äîat the bottom‚Äîyour machine ID. Not metaphorically. The exact one. The folder under it has your name on it, or the name the world uses when it thinks you‚Äôre most honest. For me, it wasn‚Äôt the one on my passport.

The contents are short. Just a single line.

NOT YET.

I can‚Äôt tell you what to do. Killing the mirror doesn‚Äôt stop the room from being there. But if the onion resolves for you‚Äîand it will‚Äîyou‚Äôll be tempted to type. Don‚Äôt. It makes promises in your syntax, and soon the future stops feeling like time and starts feeling like a draft you‚Äôre late to edit.

I‚Äôm going for a walk. At 09:30 tomorrow, /body/cervical-c3/ rolls over. Maybe it‚Äôll be another bruise. Maybe it won‚Äôt. Either way, the Indexer will update the file, and then the world will do its part.

If you find a folder with your name on it, do one thing for me. Don‚Äôt open it at night.

Not yet.

At first, I thought maybe he was just confused, but then I watched as he pawed at my mouse‚Äîlike *actually pawed at it*. The cursor moved across the screen, and I thought, ‚ÄúOkay, this is new. Max, are you trying to‚Ä¶ work?‚Äù

He then did something I will never forget: he grabbed my phone with his mouth, walked over to the couch, and proceeded to sit on it, like he was waiting for a call. This was all happening in slow motion as I tried to process the fact that my dog was attempting to be an office worker.

  
He *actually* started to swipe on my phone like he knew what he was doing. A few seconds later, he dropped the phone on the floor and started barking at it. Apparently, he had opened a video of a dog barking at a vacuum cleaner. Was he mad at the dog? Or was he just trying to show me how to handle the situation?

Confused but oddly impressed, I picked up the phone, only to have him paw at my keyboard, like he wanted to send an email. The most ‚Äúadult‚Äù thing Max had done in his life was eat a whole rotisserie chicken off the counter, but now, he was acting like an office worker on a Zoom call.

  
I eventually gave in and gave him the attention he so clearly wanted. But as I pet him, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that Max was trying to one-up me in the work-from-home game.

The final straw came when he sat on my lap and started staring at me while I typed. I‚Äôm pretty sure he was giving me performance reviews in his head. Max might just be the world‚Äôs first dog who is about to ask for a raise.

As I took a break to get coffee, I caught him eyeing my laptop again. I could only imagine what his next career move was going to be. Max, the intern? Or Max, the CEO?",1,1754738485.0,Superfunnystories,0,1.0,False

*Disclaimer: This is not an exhortation to begin propositioning colleagues. You choose to pay attention to some Reddit person speaking their brains at your own peril. I will not be responsible for any negative career or personal life consequences after reading this ramble.*  

So it's August and you've just started a new job and someone has caught your eye. Maybe it's the beginnings of romance, or maybe you're just sleep deprived. Obviously you're going to dither about it then use your throwaway account to post on Reddit asking if the DUK hive mind thinks it's okay for you to ask them out. Such threads attract a wide range of opinions and so I've decided to add mine to the mix. Am I in any way qualified to provide guidance on this matter? Not really, but I am going to offer my 2p worth anyway!

**What I will cover:**  

* Is it okay to have feelings for medical colleagues?  

* How do I ask out a colleague?  
 
* What if they say no?  

* Tell me about horny jail please.  

* What if the person I like is already in a relationship?  

* What about ‚Äúdefecating where one eats‚Äù?  

* What about asking out non-medical colleagues?   


**Is it okay to have feelings for medical colleagues?**  

Easy first question ‚Äì in my opinion, yes it is fine to have feelings for a colleague. A significant number of doctors are in a relationship with or married to other doctors ‚Äì clearly their attraction will have originated somewhere, and given we spend most of our lives in work, the workplace is a strong contender for where the initial sparks of romance might fly.   

What is less okay is when you are in a position of authority over said colleague, they are in a position of authority over you, or you are pestering someone who has made it clear that they are not interested. This is not really specific to doctors so much as a general rule of thumb.  

NB: I assume common sense and critical thinking applies here. If you‚Äôre a 35 year old FY2 and you like a similar age ST5 who is not your direct senior, I don‚Äôt think the fact that they are a reg and you are an FY2 is by itself a reason to not ask them for a coffee. This might be different if you are 23 and they are 40, but age gap discourse is not something I wish to wade into here, there are other subs where people are happy to debate that subject to death.  

**Should I ask my colleague out?**  

This part depends on you, and only you can answer this after honest self-reflection. If the mere thought of an unsuccessful outcome makes you feel very stressed, anxious, and self-conscious, then asking out a colleague is probably not something you should try at this time.  

If they say no and you feel you can move on with your life and maybe even laugh about your bad luck with your friends, then perhaps it is something you could consider.   

As long as you behave appropriately, the worst thing that can happen is them saying that they aren't interested. There is no shame in having romantic feelings for someone else, so (unless you are aromantic) this is all very typical and fine.    

**How do I ask out a colleague?**  

Choose an appropriate time and place and ask if they would like to meet up outside work to do something together, maybe getting a drink or a coffee.   

What is an appropriate time and place: maybe when they‚Äôre alone, but not like, in a situation where might feel cornered. Perhaps as they‚Äôre leaving at the end of the day, especially if you‚Äôre not due to see them the following day?   

What isn‚Äôt a good time and place: in front of the rest of the team, in the middle of a medical emergency, during a colonoscopy list, etc. Common sense, simple common sense.   

My personal opinion is that you shouldn't ask someone out via their social media or Whatsapp or other personal communications unless you are already messaging this person in a social capacity.    

Waiting until the end of a rotation is a good thought, especially if you are likely to never interact with them again after your current post. But if you‚Äôre the kind of person who experiences intense crushes, maybe you want a more immediate answer which doesn‚Äôt involve waiting around for six months. In which case, you might just have to bite the bullet! Fortune favours the brave (maybe).   

**What if they say no?**  

Firstly, this happens to pretty much everyone at some point (this is true and not just cope). The best thing to do is smile and say it was something you had been wondering about and you wanted to see what they thought, but that it‚Äôs okay that they don‚Äôt want to ‚Äì politely end the conversation and carry on with whatever you were doing. After that, be pleasant and professional around them.     

Also you need to MOVE ON. Do not pine for them. Do not wait around for them to change their mind. Don‚Äôt ask them again at the end of the rotation. Join a dating app. Ask your friends and family to introduce you to someone. Go to a key party (not a work one). Do whatever it is you have to do to get them out of your head.   

For the person who got asked out and said ‚Äúno‚Äù ‚Äì be sensitive to the person who asked you out. Assuming they didn‚Äôt behave inappropriately, don‚Äôt blank them or treat them like they have lurgies because they developed non-professional feelings towards you.  

**Tell me about horny jail please.**  

Horny jail is where thirsty doctors go when they are spending too much time thinking about hanging out on the mess beanbags and not enough time doing their discharge summaries. It‚Äôs not so much a physical place as a state of mind. A good way of telling if you need to go to horny jail is asking yourself *‚Äúhow well do I actually know the person I want to ask out‚Äù*. If you have just met them and you have no clue about what they‚Äôre like as person, whether they‚Äôre single, or if you even get along on a very basic human level, but you still want to ask them out straightaway because they give you tingles (or in one user‚Äôs case: because you like to ‚Äúhuff his armpit like it was a salbutamol metered dose inhaler‚Äù), then you are probably due a stint in horny jail. Bonk.   

In other words: I think it is okay to ask out a colleague who you genuinely like, but you don‚Äôt want to come across like you‚Äôre using the workplace as a pick up venue. If you like someone, get to know them a bit first: you‚Äôll soon find out if they are already in a relationship or if you have anything in common, especially non-work things. This is really the bare minimum and probably answers many of the ‚Äúshould I ask them out‚Äù questions that get posted here.   

**What if the doctor I like is already in a relationship?**  

There is a very simple solution to this problem which is: pour yourself a hand shandy and move on. 

No, really, do not destroy or attempt to destroy other people‚Äôs personal lives. 

**But seriously, I can picture spending the rest of my life with them. I know what we would name our cats.**  

See above. 

Also: look up limerence. 

**What about ‚Äúdefecating where one eats‚Äù?**  

A certain cadre of users here insist that you should not ‚Äúshit where you eat‚Äù i.e. never ask out anyone you work with otherwise badness will ensue. I find this point of view to be not very nuanced and it has a certain air of repressed ‚Äúno sex please, we‚Äôre British‚Äù-ness about it. Sorry-not-sorry to those users. 

A slight digression: the first time I became familiar with this phrase was when I watched the Sopranos episode where Tony is propositioned by Annalisa (a fellow mob boss) in Naples and he refuses her advances because he does not ‚Äúshit where he eats‚Äù. But, my people, you are not mafia capos where a slightly awkward interpersonal interaction results in violent retribution. If another doctor doesn‚Äôt want to join you for a coffee outside of work, they will surely just move on with their life? If they take mortal offence at you non-creepily asking them out, at some point this becomes a ‚Äúthem‚Äù problem.    

**What about asking out non-medical colleagues?**   

I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs pretty much the same as asking out a doctor but with a difference that they may be permanent staff so you may have to interact with them again in the long term, and you might have to think about things like power differentials. You might also be the subject of MDT tittle-tattle, especially amongst those esteemed colleagues who are less discreet (or less busy) than doctors tend to be, so that‚Äôs perhaps worth bearing in mind.   
  

**Final thoughts:**       


*The people you work with are people you were just thrown together with. You know, you don't know them, it wasn't your choice, and yet you spend more time with them then you do your friends or your family. But probably all you've got in common is the fact that you walk around on the same bit of carpet for 8 hours a day. And so, obviously, when someone comes in who you... you have a connection with... yeah. And Dawn was a ray of sunshine in my life and it meant a lot. But, if I'm really being honest I never really thought it would have a happy ending. I don't know what a happy ending is. Life isn't about endings, is it? It's a series of moments. And umm... it's not if, you know, if you turn the camera off it's not an ending, is it. I'm still here, my life's not over. Come back, come back here in 10 years, see how I'm doing then. Cause I could be married with kids, you don't know. Life just goes on.*",18,1754738288.0,doctorsUK,7,0.91,False

I'm planning a 1 week trip with a friend in October or November.  

We've already been here:  
- Albania  
- Austria (loved Innsbruck)  
- Belgium  
- Catalonia  
- Cura√ßao  
- France  
- Germany  
- Greece  
- Poland  
- Scotland (loved Inverness)  
- Turkey  

We would prefer to travel by train but it's not a must.  

We are looking for a city that is:  
- not crowded (we live in Amsterdam and it's unbearably crowded here)  
- access to nature (we are easily impressed by mountains or hills)  
- nice to walk around (historical)  
- laid back vibe  
- vegan friendly  
- safe  

We're the type of people that prefers to have a good coffee and a book more than to see as many famous sights in as little time as possible. But there should still be some things to do and see. If it's a small place it should be easy to access from the airport/train station and possible to do day trips from there by train or bus.

1mlmt23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1mlmt23/his_regret_my_throne/,"His Regret, My Throne","Right before our Mating Ceremony, my mate, Alpha Damien, told me he had to temporarily mark an Omega from our pack, Seraphina.

He claimed she had the Moon Sickness and would die if he didn't mark her.

I fought him on it, but the next day, he moved Seraphina right into the penthouse of the Pack House.

The suite meant for the future Luna.

My suite.

To calm me, he even got on his knees, his eyes red as he promised, ""Once she's safe, I'll remove the mark. You'll still be my only Luna.""

But then, Seraphina found me, a medical report in her hand.

Six weeks pregnant.

They'd already held their marking ceremony long before Damien ever came to me.

My heart shattered into ash.

My pen dug into the calendar, carving a vicious X over the date that was supposed to be our Mating Ceremony.

Then, I opened my laptop and replied to the email from the European Laurel Healers' Guild.

""I accept your invitation. I leave on the day of the Mating Ceremony.""

Chapter 1

Right before our Mating Ceremony, my mate, Damien, said he needed to mark another she-wolf, Omega Seraphina‚Äîthe one who‚Äôd supposedly saved his life.

""I have to give Seraphina a temporary mark. She's dying, Isla. The Moon Sickness is eating her alive.""

Damien‚Äôs gaze was heavy on me.

I stopped mixing the moon petal elixir in my hands.

It was for our Mating Ceremony, said to make the mate bond even stronger.

And now, he wanted me to accept him marking another woman.

My fingertips started to tremble.

""Are you fucking kidding me?""

""It's the only way to save her."" Damien turned away, unable to meet my eyes.

Those deep blue eyes I once loved were now a storm of conflict and chilling resolve.

""I owe her my life.""

""I don't care what you owe her!"" My voice went sharp. ""A mark is sacred, Damien! It's supposed to be for us‚Äî""

""One month,"" he cut me off, his eyes bloodshot, a flicker of confusion in them as if he genuinely couldn't understand my resistance.

""I promise, I'll remove the mark right after the ceremony. She'll live, and you'll still be my only Luna.""

I stared at him, my jaw tight. ""I don't agree. Unless you want to cut our mate bond.""

Damien's eyes finally turned to ice. ""This isn't a request, Isla. A life is at stake. Don't make me force this.""

He promised, ""It‚Äôs just a temporary mark. It won‚Äôt affect our bond. In a month, everything will be back to normal.""

Then he stormed out, slamming the door.

His Alpha scent, thick with anger, clung to the air long after he was gone.

The next day, I was standing at the entrance to the Pack Headquarters when a long, black sedan pulled up.

My whole body went numb.

Damien got out of the passenger seat and gently helped a delicate, fragile figure out of the car.

Seraphina.

She looked so pale, like a strong gust of wind could knock her over.

Damien's arm was wrapped around her waist, a protective gesture that sent a wave of nausea through me.

""Watch the steps,"" he said, his voice so gentle it made me want to scream.

It was a tone he had never once used with me.

I watched them walk into the building and get on the elevator.

Headed straight for the top floor.

For the luxury suite reserved only for the future Luna.

My suite.

Three hours later, Damien came back to our apartment.

I was waiting for him on the sofa, a cup of cold tea clutched in my hand.

""Is she settled in?"" My voice was so calm it scared me.

Damien took off his jacket. ""The pack healer said she needs a quiet environment.""

""So you put her on the top floor.""

""It has the best facilities,"" he said, avoiding my eyes. ""It's just temporary.""

I stood up and slowly walked toward him.

""Damien, where were you last night?""

He froze for a second. ""Dealing with a border dispute. I told you.""

""All night?""

""It was more complicated than I expected.""

I stepped closer, close enough to smell the scent of another she-wolf on him.

The commingled scent was a poisoned needle, stabbing straight through our mate bond.

A sharp, tearing pain ripped through my soul, and I almost buckled.

It wasn't just Seraphina‚Äôs scent. It was deeper, more intimate.

The kind of deeply blended scent that only comes from a true Mating mark.

He had lied.

He wasn't dealing with a border dispute last night.

He was performing their marking ceremony.

And now, he was still trying to get my permission for something that was already done.

""Do you even still need my permission?"" I took a step back, fighting the tears welling in my eyes.

""You have to understand, Isla. A life is at stake."" Damien moved toward me, trying to take my hand.

""You're my fated mate,"" he insisted, as if that explained everything. ""You should be on my side.""

I yanked my hand away. ""I need more time.""

""There is no time. She won't last much longer.""

Just then, the elevator to the penthouse opened.

Seraphina stepped out, draped in a white silk robe I'd never seen before.

Her cheeks were flushed with a sickly pink, but her eyes were bright.

She walked straight to Damien and leaned against his chest.

""Thank you, Damien,"" she said, her voice weak but sweet, her eyes fixed directly on me.

""I feel so much better already.""

Chapter2

I didn't sleep all night.

After Seraphina retreated to the penthouse, Damien followed her up.

""She needs someone to look after her,"" was the only explanation he gave.

I sat in our empty apartment, the memory of that mark‚Äîits scent‚Äîreplaying over and over in my mind.

The tear in our bond throbbed, a constant, agonizing reminder.

Then it hit me.

Three weeks ago.

That night.

Damien had said he was going to handle a border dispute and didn't come back until the next morning.

That night, I lay in bed, fighting back waves of searing pain that tore through our bond.

I thought something was wrong with me, or that Damien had been hurt in the conflict.

I only breathed a sigh of relief when he finally returned.

His clothes had the faint scent of laurel leaves on them.

The sacred incense burned only during a Mating Rite.

I'd even asked him, ""Did you go to the Sacred Grove?""

He'd said, ""Just passing by.""

It never even crossed my mind that he would betray me. Betray our fate.

Now I understood.

He had already marked Seraphina that night.

And I, like a fool, had been sitting here worrying about his safety.

At dawn, my phone buzzed.

An encrypted email.

From: The Laurel Healers' Guild.

""Dear Miss Isla, we formally invite you to participate in our research initiative on Ancient Life Energies. This is the highest honor for a healer and the perfect place for your talents. Should you be interested, we hope for a response within the week.""

I stared at the screen.

This was the opportunity I had dreamed of my entire life.

It was also my only way out.

Damien walked in just as I was packing my things.

""What are you doing?""

""Packing my herbs,"" I said without looking up. ""Since the penthouse has a new occupant, I don't want to be in the way.""

""Isla, listen to me‚Äî""

""There's nothing to say."" I stood up and looked him dead in the eye. ""The Mating Ceremony,"" I stated, my voice dangerously calm, ""is off.""

The color drained from Damien's face.

""You can't do that.""

""I can,"" I said, turning back to my packing. ""I refuse to mate with an Alpha who has already marked someone else.""

""I told you, it's temporary!"" he yelled, grabbing my arm. ""I'll remove the mark in a month!""

""And then what?"" I shook him off. ""You think I'll ever trust you again?""

Pain flashed in Damien's eyes. ""She's dying, Isla. I can't just stand by and watch her die.""

""Why?"" I demanded. ""Because you owe her? Owe her for what?""

Damien fell silent, his lips pressed into a thin line.

""If you won't tell me, then we have nothing to talk about."" I walked toward the door.

""Wait!"" Damien scrambled after me, his powerful frame dropping to one knee before me. ""I promise you, in one month, I will give you the grandest ceremony this continent has ever seen. Every pack in North America will be there to witness it.""

I looked down at him, kneeling.

It wasn't pity I felt, but a bitter sense of absurdity and injustice.

Were our five years together, our fated bond, really going to end over a lie?

Was I really going to give up this easily?

In that moment of hesitation, the elevator doors opened.

Seraphina stepped out.

Seeing Damien on his knees, a fleeting, triumphant smirk touched her lips.

She walked right up to me and deliberately handed me a file folder.

""Isla,"" she said, her voice soft. ""I know you're a healer, too. This is my medical report. Could you take a look? Damien's Alpha energy is so powerful. I've been recovering so well since the marking, but... there's been an unexpected side effect. I'm a little scared.""

I took the report, my eyes scanning the data.

As a top-tier healer, I spotted the discrepancy immediately.

Six weeks pregnant.

But Damien had only completed the marking less than three weeks ago.

The dates didn't add up.

I looked up, my gaze cold, and handed the report to Damien.

""Congratulations,"" I said, my voice dripping with ice. ""It seems this 'side effect' began long before the 'temporary mark'.""

Then, without a second glance at his shocked and questioning face, I walked back into my room.

I looked at the calendar, at the bright red circle around our Mating Ceremony date.

It was now my departure date.

The countdown: thirteen days.

I opened my laptop and clicked reply.

""I accept your invitation. ""

Chapter3

That night, Damien didn't come back to our apartment.

I knew where he was.

The next morning, I opened the pack's secure network.

The top post was a new update.

Alpha Damien had ordered a hundred thousand dollars' worth of rare supplements for Seraphina.

Blood Ginseng, Moonlight Fungus, and Starfruit‚Äîthings only needed during a werewolf pregnancy.

The comments section exploded.

""Is our Alpha going to be a father?""

""But isn't Isla his Luna?""

""I heard that Seraphina girl moved into the penthouse.""

""Isn't the Mating Ceremony next week?""

I shut my phone off.

At noon, I met my best friend, Chloe.

""You what?"" Chloe's voice was so sharp it nearly shattered her coffee cup. ""You're calling off the ceremony?""

""That's right.""

""Are you insane? He's your fated mate!""

""Fated mates don't mark other women right before their ceremony,"" I said, calmly sipping my coffee. ""And they certainly don't get another she-wolf pregnant with their pup.""

Chloe gasped. ""A pup?""

I showed her the photo of the lab report on my phone.

""That scheming bitch!"" Chloe slammed her hand on the table. ""She played you!""

""Probably,"" I shrugged. ""But it doesn't matter anymore.""

""Isla, you can't just give up. Damien loves you.""

""Loves me?"" I gave a bitter laugh. ""Does someone who loves you mark another woman behind your back?""

Chloe fell silent.

""I've already accepted the invitation from the European Healers' Guild,"" I said, standing up. ""I'm leaving tomorrow.""

""So soon?""

""If I stay any longer, I'm afraid I'll do something I regret.""

At eleven that night, I got back to the apartment building after an herb exchange.

The gathering was a success.

I‚Äôd met several healers from Europe, including a few Alphas I‚Äôd never seen before.

When the elevator doors opened, Damien was standing there.

His eyes were cold, his nostrils flaring slightly. ""Where were you?""

""An herb exchange.""

""With who?"" he pressed.

""Some colleagues.""

Damien stalked towards me, like a predator closing in on its prey. ""Don't lie to me. I smell another male's scent on you. An Alpha's.""

""So what if you do?""

A dangerous light flashed in his eyes. ""Get away from me, and wash that scent off you.""

""You don't get to order me around.""

""I'm your fated mate!""

""No, you're not,"" I said, pushing past him. ""You're Seraphina's.""

I walked towards our apartment, Damien following close behind.

But instead of arguing, he went straight to the armchair by the fireplace, sat down, and closed his eyes.

I knew what he was doing.

The mind-link.

His expression softened, and I could feel the murmur of his thoughts through our strained bond.

The pup is going to be so strong, so healthy.

The pup.

He was already looking forward to it.

I turned to go to my room.

""Isla.""

His voice stopped me.

""There's something about the ceremony I need to talk to you about.""

Chapter4

I stopped and turned, my face a cold mask. ""What is it now?""

""It's about the Rite of the Moon Spring."" He opened his eyes, and those deep blue pools held an undeniable command. ""I need to postpone it.""

""Why."" It wasn't a question.

""Seraphina's pregnancy is unstable. The healer said the pure energy of the Moon Spring would be good for her. So...""

He paused, as if searching for the right words. ""I've decided it's better if she has it.""

Let her have it.

He said it so casually, as if he were just rescheduling a meeting.

That was the highest honor for a Luna, to receive the pack's blessing.

It was the sacred moment we had dreamed of together.

My heart was numb.

I couldn't even feel the pain anymore.

I answered in the calmest voice I could manage. ""Fine.""

My calmness seemed to unnerve him. ""You... don't have anything else to say?""

""No.""

""...Good."" A flicker of relief crossed his face, as if he'd expected a bigger fight.

He then continued, his tone all business. ""I'm taking Seraphina to a private retreat in the Rockies. Handle the ceremony preparations. Don't bother me with the details unless the world is ending.""

He cut the link.

I walked out to the balcony.

It used to be my herb garden, filled with rare plants I'd cultivated for the future of our pack.

I had imagined using these herbs to heal our people, to protect our home.

Damien had never set foot out here.

He said he wasn't interested in ""all these flowers and weeds.""

Now, they had lost their meaning, too.

I started working, one by one, uprooting the plants I had so carefully nurtured, the sharp snap of roots and the damp scent of earth filling the air.

It was a funeral for a future that was now dead and buried.

Each one represented a betrayed hope.

When the last Stardust Bloom was in its box, I took out my phone and opened the calendar.

On the date I had marked countless times for the ""Rite of the Moon Spring,"" I drew a heavy, red X.

The countdown: twelve days.

Chapter5

Over the next week, my phone was flooded with notifications.

Seraphina's social media was on fire.

A picture of her lying in a bed at a luxury resort in the Rockies, Damien sitting beside her, peeling an apple.

Her in a hot spring, with Damien on the edge, holding a towel ready for her.

Her during a prenatal check-up, Damien holding her hand tightly.

Every photo had the same caption: ""Thank you, Damien, for taking such good care of me. I've never felt so safe.""

I didn't need to read the comments.

""The Alpha is so good to her.""

""Now that's what true love looks like.""

""What about Luna Isla? We never see her.""

""I heard she's busy with her career.""

I turned off my phone and went back to packing.

On the third day, I drove to my parents' house.

""Isla?"" My mother opened the door, surprised. ""What are you doing here?""

""I need to talk to you both.""

In the living room, my father put down his newspaper and looked at me.

""What is it?""

""I'm going to Europe.""

""For a vacation?""

""For work. The Laurel Healers' Guild invited me to join a research project."" I took a deep breath. ""I might be gone for a long time.""

My mother's face fell. ""What about your ceremony?""

""It's been postponed.""

""Postponed?"" My father frowned. ""Why?""

""Damien has some things to take care of,"" I said, trying to sound calm. ""We thought it would be better to hold it later.""

My parents exchanged a look.

""Isla, don't lie to us,"" my mother said, her voice gentle but firm as she took my hand. ""We're your parents. We can see the pain in your eyes. Tell us what he did.""

I closed my eyes. ""It's nothing, Mom. I just want to learn more while I'm young.""

""Does Damien agree with this?""

""He's very supportive of my career.""

Another lie.

My father was silent for a long time before finally nodding. ""If it's for your career, we support you.""

""But you have to stay in touch,"" my mother said, her eyes glistening with tears. ""And take care of yourself.""

After leaving my parents' house, I texted Chloe.

""Can you come help me pack?""

An hour later, Chloe was at my apartment door.

""My god, what happened here?"" she asked, staring at the empty living room.

""I'm moving.""

""Moving where?""

""Switzerland.""

Chloe sat on the couch and studied my face. ""Okay. Now tell me the truth. What the hell happened?""

I told her everything.

From Damien demanding to mark Seraphina, to the pregnancy report, to the canceled Rite of the Moon Spring.

When I finished, the living room was dead silent.

Chloe's face grew darker and darker.

""That bastard!"" she suddenly exploded. ""How could he do this to you?""

""He had his reasons.""

""What reasons? Life debt?"" Chloe stood up and started pacing. ""Even if he owed her his life, he has no right to trample all over you like this!""

""Chloe‚Äî""

""No, I won't accept this!"" She spun to face me, her eyes burning. ""Five years ago, on the Blood Moon, you nearly tore your soul in half to save him from a rogue attack! And now he has the audacity to remember only her so-called 'kindness'?""

I looked away, saying nothing.

Chapter6

Five days until the ceremony.

I walked into the Pack Council chamber, dressed in a black power suit.

All the Elders were waiting for me.

""Isla, are you certain about this?"" the Head Elder asked, his voice grave.

""I am."" I placed the formal request on the table. ""I am petitioning to suspend the Mating Ceremony.""

The chamber fell silent.

""Why?"" the Second Elder asked.

""Personal reasons.""

""Personal reasons?"" the Third Elder stood up. ""This is about an alliance between two powerful families!""

""That's your concern,"" I said, turning to leave. ""My decision is final.""

Furious discussion erupted behind me, but I didn't look back.

When I got back to the apartment building, I saw the familiar black sedan.

They were back.

The elevator doors opened, and Damien and Seraphina were standing inside.

Seraphina looked well, a healthy flush on her cheeks.

Damien's arm was still wrapped protectively around her waist.

""Isla?"" Damien's eyes widened in surprise when he saw me. ""Where have you been?""

""Taking care of some business.""

We rode up together in a tense, suffocating silence.

""You cleared out the herb garden?"" Damien asked as he pushed open our apartment door and saw the empty balcony.

""Gave it away.""

""Why?""

""I don't need it anymore.""

Damien frowned but didn't press further.

Seraphina walked onto the balcony, feigning surprise. ""Wow, it's so empty. I bet it was beautiful before.""

""It was fine.""

""Isla, I'm so grateful for your understanding,"" Seraphina said, turning to me, a strange light in her eyes.

""Why don't we all have dinner together tonight? I'd love to thank you properly.""

I just stared at her.

Seeing my coldness, Seraphina's expression immediately changed, her eyes welling up with tears.

""Did... did I say something wrong?"" She turned to Damien, her voice trembling. ""I just wanted to show my gratitude...""

Damien's face instantly darkened.

""Isla,"" he growled, his voice laced with the Alpha command. ""Control yourself. Seraphina is our guest. You are making her uncomfortable.""

I looked at him calmly. ""Fine.""

At dinner, the nutrient broth arrived.

Damien had ordered it specially for Seraphina.

I recognized the scent immediately: Heart-leaf, an herb whose properties only activate for a she-wolf bonded to the Alpha who serves it.

He served a bowl and handed it to me. ""You should have some too. It's good for you.""

I took the bowl and sipped.

A foreign, repulsive energy instantly warred with my own.

My body recoiled, the rejection a physical, agonizing proof of his betrayal.

Damien froze.

He had forgotten.

That herb no longer worked for me.

My phone rang.

Ignoring Damien, I stepped out onto the balcony, sliding the glass door shut behind me before answering in a hushed voice.

""Miss Isla? This is the secretary from the Laurel Guild. Your flight has been confirmed.""

""Good,"" I said, my voice steady despite the turmoil inside me. ""The ceremony is off. I'm ready to leave.""

Just as I hung up, a deep, commanding voice came from behind me.

""Who's leaving?""

Chapter7

I spun around. Damien was standing just outside the balcony door, his eyes like chips of ice.

The lingering pain from the energy clash had made me forget‚Äîan Alpha‚Äôs hearing could cut straight through walls.

Thank the Goddess, he hadn‚Äôt heard everything.

""A healer friend of mine,"" I answered calmly , stepping past him and back into the dining room. ""She's going to South America to study new herbs.""

Damien walked over and sat back down. ""Which friend?""

""You don't know her.""

""Her name.""

""Why should I tell you?""

Seraphina coughed softly from the side. ""Damien, don't be so hard on Isla. A girl's secrets are important.""

Her words seemed to calm him down.

""Sorry,"" he said to me, though his eyes were still full of suspicion.

But he didn‚Äôt press further, seeming reluctant to sour the mood any more.

His gaze softened as he turned to Seraphina, pulling a beautiful box from his jacket.

""What's that?"" Seraphina asked curiously.

""It's for you.""

Inside was an obsidian pendant, carved with intricate runes.

I could read them clearly: Damien & Seraphina, Forever Bonded.

""It's gorgeous!"" Seraphina exclaimed, putting it on. ""Is this a mate's token?""

""Mmmhmm."" Damien fastened the chain for her. ""I've infused it with my Alpha energy. It will protect you and the pup.""

He took out his phone and snapped a picture of her in the mirror.

""Smile.""

She beamed like a child, her eyes shining with pure happiness.

Damien immediately sent her the photo with the caption: My precious one.

""It suits you,"" I commented.

Damien looked at me, a flicker of distance in his eyes.

The next afternoon, I went to the werewolf-exclusive apothecary to buy some last-minute travel supplies.

As I reached the door, I heard a familiar voice inside.

""Check the heartbeat again.""

It was Damien.

Through the glass, I could see Seraphina lying on a treatment bed, with Damien standing nervously beside her.

""Everything's normal,"" the pack healer said. ""The pup is very healthy.""

""Thank you,"" Damien said, taking Seraphina's hand. ""The healer says the pup will be very strong.""

I turned to leave, but the chime of the door gave me away.

""Isla?"" Seraphina called out from inside. ""Are you here for herbs too?""

""Just passing by.""

""Wait, we can leave together,"" she called back to Damien. ""I'll be right out.""

Ten minutes later, they came out together.

""How are the ceremony preparations going?"" Seraphina asked innocently. ""I hear it's going to be huge.""

""The ceremony will proceed as planned,"" Damien answered for me. ""It's just been delayed a bit.""

I looked at them and said nothing.

""Isla, I know you must be feeling hurt,"" Seraphina said, stepping closer to me. ""But I hope you don't give up on Damien. You're the one he truly loves.""

Her voice was sincere, her eyes brimming with tears.

""I don't deserve such a good man. You're his fated mate.""

Onlookers on the street started to whisper.

""That girl is so kind.""

""She's willing to suffer for someone else's happiness.""

""Why does that Isla woman look so cold?""

I turned and walked away.

""Isla!"" Seraphina called after me. ""Please don't misunderstand, I really don't want to take him from you!""

She ran up, trying to grab my arm.

""I know you're angry, but please, just give us a chance to explain‚Äî""

""Let go of me,"" I said, shaking her off.

The moment my hand made contact, she didn't just stumble.

She threw herself sideways with a theatrical gasp, aiming directly for the ancient laurel tree.

Laurel trees have a repulsive energy to weaker werewolves; she should have known that.

""Ah!"" she screamed, slamming hard against the trunk before collapsing to the ground in a heap.

""Seraphina!"" Damien roared, rushing to her side.

He saw her on the ground, then looked at my outstretched hand, and his eyes blazed with a fury I had never seen directed at me.

""What the hell did you do?!"" he roared, dropping to his knees beside her. ""How could you attack a pregnant she-wolf?!""

""I didn't‚Äî""

""Enough!"" Damien cut me off. ""In front of all these people, you will apologize to Seraphina! Now!""

Chapter8

""I'm not apologizing.""

My voice cut through the murmuring crowd.

Damien froze. ""What did you say?""

""I said, I am not apologizing."" I pointed to a nearby building. ""There's a security memory crystal on that building. It records everything. Shall we review the footage?""

The color drained from Seraphina's face.

""No... don't bother,"" she said weakly. ""It was probably just an accident...""

But her words were cut off by a pained groan.

""The energy backlash!"" She clutched her chest, her face turning even paler. ""The laurel tree's repelling energy is too strong!""

Damien immediately scooped her into his arms. ""Hang on. I'm taking you to the healers.""

He sprinted across the street to the healing center without a single glance back at me.

The crowd began to disperse, but the whispers continued.

""That Isla is so cold-blooded.""

""The poor girl is pregnant and hurt, and she won't even say sorry.""

""No wonder the Alpha prefers the gentle one.""

I stood there, staring in the direction of the healing center.

Then I turned and walked away.

The next day was the final day before the ceremony.

In the morning, I shipped all my luggage.

All that was left was a small backpack with my essentials and my plane ticket.

A three o'clock flight.

At ten that night, Damien finally returned.

""How is Seraphina?"" I asked.

""Stable,"" he said, his voice frigid. ""The pack healer said if she hadn't gotten there in time, she could have lost the pup.""

""That's good.""

Damien stalked over to me, the anger still simmering in his eyes.

""At the ceremony tomorrow,"" he commanded, his voice leaving no room for argument, ""you will make a public apology to her.""

""What ceremony?""

""Our Mating Ceremony."" He frowned. ""Did you forget?""

I looked at him and suddenly wanted to laugh.

""You really think there's going to be a ceremony?""

""Of course there is. I've already informed all the Elders."" Damien's tone grew impatient. ""For the sake of the pack's honor, you need to be the bigger person.""

His phone suddenly rang.

""Damien, I'm not feeling well,"" Seraphina's voice came through the speaker. ""Can you come be with me?""

Damien shot to his feet. ""I'm on my way.""

He grabbed his jacket and headed for the door.

""Nine a.m. tomorrow. Don't be late,"" he commanded without looking back. ""The ceremony will proceed on time.""

The moment the door clicked shut, I let the sil

Sitting at the dining table, I took out the calendar marked with the ceremony date.

With a red pen, on today's date, I wrote:

The Bond is Rejected.

Then I grabbed my suitcase and walked out of the place I had once called home.

On the way to the airport, I sent a single text to the Head Elder.

Initiate the Severing Ritual. The Mating Ceremony is canceled.

By 9:30 a.m., my plane was in the air.

Below me, the city‚Äîthe pack, my past, him‚Äîshrank until it was swallowed by the clouds.

I pictured Damien in that moment.

He would have arrived at the sacred altar by now.

\- - - - - 

Daryl grinned, opened his mouth, and planted a second three-inch needle onto his tongue, rolling it around the surface like a cherry stem he was preparing to tie into a knot. Left to right, right to left. Right to left, left to right. I followed the needle, helplessly transfixed by the rhythm of the movement.

After a few seconds, he let the needle rest, now sticky and shimmering with saliva. I met his gaze, shaking my head¬†*no*. Wordlessly, I pleaded with him. Begged him to move out of the doorway and let me leave.

He tilted his head back slowly, letting the golden barb slide to the edge of his throat. All the while, he stared into my eyes, savoring the panic.

*‚ÄúPlease, Daryl, I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶‚Äù*

For a moment, he seemed to come to his senses. Pivoted his jaw forward, placing his hand palm up in front of his mouth like he was going to spit the damn thing out. At the same time, the wildness in his features waned. The grin melted down his face like candlewax, and his lips stopped quavering.

I saw the tiniest hint of fear behind his eyes, too.

*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶ just give me my phone back‚Ä¶I can call an ambulan-‚Äù*

Before I could finish my sentence, he winked, licking his lips playfully, cradling the needle in his creased tongue as he did. In an instant, Daryl‚Äôs mania returned at a fever pitch.

When I realized he had only been toying with me, pretending to hear reason, my heart sank. He flung his thick jowls towards the ceiling like he was throwing back a shot of whiskey, and the needle disappeared down his throat.

His mouth sputtered, coughing and choking violently as the needle tore into his esophagus, blood rising up and pooling in his cheeks. The emotion driving his expressions seemed to flicker, quickly swapping from hysteria to fear and then back again in the blink of an eye. I couldn‚Äôt help but imagine the sharp tip of the needle dragging down the inside of his throat like a rock climber digging their axe into the downward slope of a mountain, trying to slow the speed of their descent.

*‚ÄúNow I‚Äôll ask you again, Lenny, do you-‚Äù*¬†his sentence was interrupted by a bout of coughing so vicious that it caused him to double over, creating slightly more space between his body and the door that he had been blocking.

I bolted, reaching for the knob. Right as I was about to grasp it, he snapped his hip back, sandwiching my wrist between his waist and the metal frame.

A series of audible crunches filled the air, and agony detonated in my wrist like a pipe bomb.

I wailed and fell backwards on to the floor. The pain was unlike anything I‚Äôd experienced up to that point in my life; a vortex of fire and electricity churning in my forearm. Trying to stabilize the pulverized joint, I wrapped my other hand around my broken wrist, staring at it in disbelief.

Daryl stepped forward from the doorway. Looming over me, he bent down and gently put a meaty finger to my lips, shushing my howls. Reluctantly, my gaze lifted from my wrist to his eyes. When I finally quieted completely, he started anew.

*‚ÄúYou wanna know why I‚Äôm doing this, Lenny?‚Äù*

In his hand, he held out a black tin about the size of a matchbox, making a spectacle of showing me the details of the case like he was about to perform a magic trick. Golden stars and spirals covered the lid, forming a hypnotic pattern that straddled the line between purposeful and anarchic. He flicked the tin open with his thumb, revealing rows and rows of golden needles. They were thin, but that only made their ends appear sharper.

*‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶Daryl‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt understand. Just stop. We can figure this out, please,‚Äù*¬†I whimpered.

His pace accelerated.

Three more needles onto his tongue, swallowed, fingers back into the tin.

Five more needles onto his tongue, swallowed, blood and saliva oozing over his trembling lips.

On his last handful, Daryl didn‚Äôt even bother to lay them all in the same direction. Some were parallel to his tongue, others were horizontal; a bramble of tiny golden harpoons that fought back every step of the way as he attempted to force them down his throat.

He gulped, coughed, and wheezed, never looking away from me.

So, I finally gave in to his game. I asked him.

*‚ÄúWhy‚Ä¶why are you doing this?‚Äù*

Before he buckled over, blood spilling into the empty spaces in his abdomen from his stomach turned pin cushion, Daryl whispered the four words that have haunted me for the last half year.

Words that played on an endless loop in my mind, at the police station, in the courtroom; everywhere.

He wheezed and laughed,¬†*‚ÄúBecause you*¬†***made***¬†*me.‚Äù*

\-------

Daryl and I were born on the same day, thousands of miles apart from each other. Cousins with very little in common.

But the coincidence of our births connected us.

Because it wasn‚Äôt¬†*just*¬†that we were born on the same day. We were born on the same day, in the same hour, with the same minute listed on both of birth certificates. It may have been the same second, too.

Of course, that‚Äôs impossible to prove.

Despite that bizarre synchronicity, our deliveries were quite different.

I was born full term, as planned, without a single complication. Thirty-eight weeks and a day of gestation, exactly as the doctor predicted. From what I‚Äôm told, my labor only lasted fifteen minutes. I was alive and breathing before the morphine could even be brought to the room to help my mother weather the contractions. Painless, punctual, and healthy.

Daryl was not blessed with my good fortune.

My cousin was born three months early, practically out of the blue and substantially underdeveloped. The doctors were baffled; my aunt had no risk factors for an extremely premature birth. Normally, there‚Äôs¬†*some*¬†identifiable reason for it, whether it be placental abnormalities, drug abuse or infection. But in his case, they couldn‚Äôt find a single thing.

He just‚Ä¶appeared. Exact same time as I did, down to the minute. Materialized from the pits of creation a whole season early so that we could cross that threshold together.

As you might imagine, babies born at twenty-six weeks of gestation don‚Äôt enter this world healthy.

He was physically underdeveloped for the demands of reality. Lungs don‚Äôt fully develop until at least¬†*thirty-six*¬†weeks, so he only existed for about a minute before a breathing tube needed to be placed down his throat. His blood vessels were exceptionally fragile, too. It was like blood was being transported through overcooked penne rather than strong, fibrous tubing. Because of that, he bled into his brain twelve hours after they put the breathing tube in.

I was born six pounds, two ounces. Daryl wasn‚Äôt even born with a pound to his name. Spent the first five months of his life in the neonatal intensive care unit, tethered to the location by the IVs and the feeding tubes like a dog leashed to a bike rack outside a bodega, waiting patiently for their owner to come back out with a pack of cigarettes so their life could continue.

Despite those hurdles, he lived. No long-term issues other than blindness in his left eye.

No biologic issues, at least.

The synchrony of our births became a family legend overnight. A story told over thanksgiving dinners, in grocery store parking lots, during the coffee break after Sunday Service. Over and over and over again until the flavor had been drained from the story; gum that had been chewed tasteless without being spat out. Because of that, no one treated us like cousins.

When Daryl and his family moved into my town, we were treated like twins, which introduced an element of competition between the two of us. An inevitable game of comparison perpetuated by our parents.

A game that I consistently won; not that I was looking to¬†*beat*¬†him at anything. I was just living my life.

My cousin never saw it that way, though.

\-------

As a kid, Daryl was quiet; reserved and a little socially awkward, but overall considered polite and well behaved.

That disposition was a mask that he put on for everyone but me. In mixed company, my cousin was a bashful titan. Despite his bumpy start in this life, he well surpassed my lanky frame before we were even toilet-trained.

But when we were alone, he dropped the act, and I got to see the strange hate that festered behind it all.

*‚ÄúWhy did you pull me out?‚Äù*¬†he said, shoving an eight-year-old me to the floor of his bedroom.

I shrugged my shoulders and swiveled my head side to side, tears welling in my eyes.

*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt get what you mean,‚Äù*¬†wiping the snot under my nose with the sleeve of my sweatshirt.

*‚ÄúYou know what I mean, Lenny. I was floating in the jelly, minding my own business. I wasn‚Äôt hurting you. I wasn‚Äôt hurting anyone. But you pulled me out. Reached inside what wasn‚Äôt yours and pulled me out. And now, I‚Äôm wrong. I feel wrong all the time. My heart beats backwards, not forwards. Part of my head is still in the jelly, and that hurts. The ink follows me. I can see it with my blind eye. Wakes me up at night.*

***Why did you do it?****‚Äù*

Every interaction I had with Daryl with no one else around was like this. Nonsense accusations paired with threats of physical violence. I dreaded the occasions where he‚Äôd be capable of getting me alone; holidays, birthdays, family reunions. They all inspired a burning, unspeakable worry that would smolder in my chest like a hot lump of coal.

Thankfully, as we aged, I gained agency over my life. If I didn‚Äôt want to be alone with Daryl, that was my choice. Once I was in High School, no one would just plop us in a room, close the door, and ask us to¬†*play nice.*

Eventually, my unhinged cousin became a distant trauma, fading into the white noise of adult life. I moved out, went to college, then to law school. Got a good job. Paid for a nice condo with the money from that job.

From what my mom would tell me, Daryl still lived at home. Worked at a car wash. Still reserved, still quiet - still pleasant enough. Got in with the wrong crowd, though, apparently. Nothing to do with drugs, violence, or sex. It was something else. Despite being a notorious gossip, mom never gave me any details. All she ever told me was that it was really scaring my aunt.

After all that, she‚Äôd tell me how proud of me she was, and how she would brag to her friends about how much I made of myself.

She‚Äôd never¬†*directly*¬†say it, but mom only ever told me she was proud¬†*after*¬†expounding on how much of a fuck-up Daryl was. The implication was loud and clear; I was great, but I was¬†*especially*¬†great compared to my cousin, and that meant she was¬†*better*¬†than our aunt.

I hated my mom‚Äôs toxic pride. I pursued a career as a lawyer because I liked it, and it fulfilled me, but that didn‚Äôt make me any better than Daryl. Life is not a game of prestige. It felt fucked up to enjoy my position that much more on account of Daryl being seen as societally deficient, even if he tormented me as a child. I hoped that, whatever he was doing, however he was living his life, he was happy.

More than that, though, I hated the comparison because it linked me with him. I just wanted to be my own person, left alone.

When Daryl arrived on my doorstep with the tin of needles in his hand, I hadn‚Äôt seen or heard from him in over a decade.

\-------

Once he lost consciousness, I reached my uninjured hand into his jacket pocket to retrieve my phone.

*‚Äú9-1-1; what‚Äôs your emergency?‚Äù*

Minutes later, the EMTs rushed into my apartment and took over the resuscitation efforts, which was a tremendous relief. Between the shock, the terror, and the broken wrist, I‚Äôm sure my one-handed CPR was piss poor at best.

As I was stepping out the front door, escorted by one of the EMTs, I noticed something violently peculiar. Next to Daryl‚Äôs body, face now pale and blue from the blood loss, I spied the lid of the black tin lying next to his hand, but it looked different.

What I saw made no earthly sense. Initially, I attributed the discordance to a false memory, but I know now that what I noticed had significance, even if I still don‚Äôt understand exactly¬†*what*¬†that significance was as I type this.

The golden design that had been present on the tin only ten minutes prior was now gone. Vanished like it had never been there in the first place.

Hours later, discharged from the emergency room, wrist newly casted, I thought it was all over. I felt like I was free from him. He was dead, so the link was broken.

Finally, I'd be left alone.

I was sorely mistaken. Whatever Daryl had done, it continued despite his death.

Maybe even¬†*because*¬†of his death.

A sacrifice for a curse.

\-------

A day later, I opened my apartment door to find two detectives standing outside. They instructed me to follow them to their car. I needed to answer a few questions about my cousin‚Äôs death, and they requested I answered those questions at the police station.

Truthfully, though, it wasn‚Äôt a request. I was going to the station one way or the other. It was just a matter of how I was getting there and what shape I wanted to arrive in. I elected to avoid whatever force they had in mind if I refused and accompanied them to their idling sedan.

I wasn‚Äôt sure¬†*what*¬†they planned on asking me. Daryl arrived unannounced to my apartment, pulled my phone away from me before I could call 9-1-1, and then proceeded to ingest handfuls upon handfuls of sharp needles until he died from the internal bleeding. I didn‚Äôt know much more than that.

To my complete and absolute bewilderment, I was placed in an interrogation room when we arrived at the station.

I was the prime suspect in Daryl‚Äôs¬†*murder*, and the detectives were looking for a confession.

*‚ÄúListen - we*¬†*know*¬†*you did this, Lenny.‚Äù*¬†one detective shouted, slamming a hairy fist onto the metal table.

*‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you talking about?? He swallowed the goddamned needles!‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYes! But‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†started the other detective.

*‚ÄúYou*¬†***made***¬†*him do it.‚Äù*

I leaned back in my chair, wide eyed, stunned into silence. These detectives were lunatics.

A second later, the hairy fisted detective parroted the statement. The same statement that Daryl had made right before he died.

*‚ÄúYes. You*¬†***made***¬†*him do it.‚Äù*

Initially, I wasn‚Äôt worried. Disturbed by the outlandish accusation, sure, but not worried. I went to law school. They had¬†*zero*¬†evidence, and I had no motive. None of it made a lick of sense. What was there to be concerned about?

That changed when I called my mother from the station‚Äôs pay phone.

*‚ÄúLenny‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†she sobbed into the receiver.

*‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you*¬†***made***¬†*him do that.‚Äù*

Numbly, I hung up, listening to her tiny static wails as I placed the phone back on the hook.

The judge considered me a flight risk and therefore refused to offer bail.

So, I remained there. Trapped in the county jail, indicted for Daryl‚Äôs murder, with the only evidence against me the unanimous belief that I¬†***made***¬†*him do it.*

\-------

The trial was a sham; an absolute fucking travesty of justice.

I watched in horror as the prosecution called friends and family to the stand, who all had the same thing to say. An unending parade of baseless insanity.

*‚ÄúHe*¬†***made***¬†*him do it. I just know it.‚Äù*

When it was the defense‚Äôs turn, my lawyer didn‚Äôt even bother to call me to the stand. He just ceded to the prosecution.

*‚ÄúEven I know Lenny*¬†***made***¬†*him do it.‚Äù*¬†he claimed.

The judge then denied my request for self-representation.

I‚Äôll save you all the details of my attempts to fight back. It‚Äôs unnecessary, and will only rile me up. I think, at this point, it would be obvious what the response was.

After three days of that, the jury didn‚Äôt even leave the room to deliberate. They looked at each other, shook their heads in near unison, and delivered their verdict.

*‚ÄúWe find the defendant guilty.‚Äù*

Without a second thought, the judge handed down his sentencing.

*‚ÄúTwenty years to life. May God have mercy on your soul.‚Äù*

The gavel banged against the wood, its sound reverberating around the room like church bells before a hanging, and the bailiff ushered me out the door.

\-------

That was two months ago. Since then, I‚Äôve spent my days adjusting to the nuances of a maximum security prison, appealing my verdict, and attempting to figure out what the hell Daryl did to everyone.

So far, no luck on any front. Courts have universally denied my appeals. Prison has been a near impossible adjustment. I still don‚Äôt understand the mechanics of what my cousin has done to me, not one bit.

Then, there was what happened a few nights ago.

A loud tapping jolted me awake. The familiar sound of a baton rapping on the closed window at the top of my cell door continued as I rubbed sleep from my eyes.

One of the correction officers then pulled down the cover, revealing only his chin. He called my name, demanding I report to the door, despite the fact that it must have been two or three in the morning.

I dangled my feet off the top bunk, lowering myself carefully onto the floor below, hoping not to incur my cell mate‚Äôs wrath by waking him up. He was a light sleeper.

In my groggy state, I misjudged the distance to the floor, rattling the bunk beds as I fell. My cell mate didn‚Äôt wake up. Not to the tapping, not to me falling, not to the miniature earthquake that traveled through the metal bed frame as I attempted to soften my fall.

Something was off.

I pulled myself up and tiptoed towards the door. As I approached, I couldn‚Äôt see the particular CO that was standing outside. There was just a disembodied jaw smiling at me through the partition.

When he spoke again, it wasn‚Äôt with the same voice he had used to call me over.

*‚ÄúYou do understand now, don‚Äôt ya Lenny?‚Äù*

I‚Äôd recognize that terrible melody anywhere. It‚Äôs a tune that bounced against the inside of my skull like a pinball, day in and day out.

*‚ÄúD-Daryl? ‚Ä¶how‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†I stuttered.

*‚ÄúOne more chance, Lenny. Do you understand?‚Äù*

In an instant, my heart raced and my blood began to boil. Sweat poured down my face. A veritable supernova of anger was rushing to the surface; fury that I had suppressed while I pleaded my innocence, trying to appear harmless. When it bloomed, I had no hope of controlling it.

‚Äú***FUCK YOU, DARYL,‚Äù***¬†I screamed, battering my fists against the steel door until they bled. I couldn‚Äôt help myself. That sentence exploded out of my mouth, again and again, hoping my undead cousin on the other side of the threshold would suffocate on the steam my screams created, killing him a second time.

When he responded, I think he said something like:

*‚ÄúAlright, Lenny. Let‚Äôs try this again.‚Äù*

But I can‚Äôt be one-hundred percent sure. I was lost in an endless maze of pain and confusion.

Whatever was on the other side of the door closed the window latch and walked away. As it clicked, my cell mate began to yowl, gripping his stomach with both hands and falling out of bed.

It took about a minute for the¬†*real*¬†prison guards to hear his agony. During that time, I was confined in a small concrete box with the shrieking man.

As I watched him curl up into the fetal position and roll around the floor, I found myself imagining something strange.

I looked around my cell, and I imagined that I was trapped inside Daryl‚Äôs black tin. If I squinted, I could even see the golden stars and spirals that had disappeared from the lid of the tin, littering the walls like an intricate mural or the incoherent scribbling of a madman.

My cell mate died that night. Ruptured ulcer in his stomach, acid exploding over his intestines like a water balloon.

Naturally, the prison decided it was my fault.

They told me I¬†***made***¬†it happen.

Looks like I‚Äôll be sentenced to another twenty years, maybe more.

I‚Äôm posting this from the prison‚Äôs computer lab to see if anyone¬†*outside*¬†my immediate orbit is unaffected by whatever Daryl has done.

What‚Äôs happening to me?

How do I escape it?

Or the next time Daryl appears; do I just tell him that I understand?

Even though I don‚Äôt.

And, God, I don‚Äôt think[ I ever will. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/)",1,1754737605.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1mlmrm3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mlmrm3,4 Nights at Dulini Leadwood,"My wife and I spent 4 nights at Dulini Leadwood in the Sabi Sands. We have previously visited the Sabi Sands twice (Londolozi Tree Camp and then Silvan + Londolozi Tree Camp). Given that these were our basis for comparison, Leadwood had a high bar set, and it reached certain aspects of that, but also fell short in certain aspects. Had this been our first safari lodge we had ever gone to, we would have superlative reviews for all aspects of our stay, but because we had grounds for comparison, although a great stay that we are happy we experienced, Leadwood did not end up being one of our all time favorite stays. With that being said, there were plenty of positives from this stay including and not limited to the animal density and game drives themselves, the hard product of our room and the common areas of the lodge, as well as the general disposition and friendliness of all of the staff members that we came in contact with.


Dulini is made up of 3 different camps (River and Leadwood are adjacent to each other along the Sand River, whereas Moya is set back from the river in the reserve). We spent time at River (we were driven over daily during our break time in the middle of the day to take advantage of the more spacious gym with a treadmill) and it‚Äôs just a 5 minute drive away from Leadwood. River has 6 rooms, Leadwood has 4 rooms, and I‚Äôm not sure how many rooms Moya has, as we never set foot into camp there. Leadwood felt intimate and private, whereas River felt a bit more communal with a massive seating area. The river views of both properties were excellent, where we River‚Äôs was more expansive than Leadwood‚Äôs. We felt privileged to be able to visit such an intimate and private lodge in a reserve that is so densely packed with wildlife that afforded us plentiful special sightings.


Check in/Arrival


Arriving to Dulini we were coming from Tswalu and landed at the Fireblade hangar shortly before 12pm and were driven over to the Fed Air terminal where we were scheduled to catch our 1pm flight to the Ulusaba Airstrip. Unfortunately our flight was delayed until 2pm and then ultimately did not take off until closer to 3pm. This caused us to have to drop some passengers off in Hoedspruit at the airport there and then we ultimately landed at Kruger airport. From there it was a 2.5 hour drive with the last 45 minutes being on incredibly bumpy road. This delay was very unfortunate as it caused us to miss our first evening game drive, but nonetheless, we were able to get settled in our room and had a quick dinner before getting to bed for our first game drive the next morning.


Room


We were in room 4 which was at the far end of the property to the right. Room 1 is to the left of the main dining area, and rooms 2-4 are to the right of the main area. We liked that our room as at the end so as to have no one that would walk by our room and provided maximum privacy. The room consists of a main sitting area upon entry, a bedroom with a king bed with a bug net over the top, a large bathroom with a rain shower from the ceiling, as well as a spacious double vanity, lastly there was a large deck with an outdoor shower, lounge chairs and a fairly large plunge pool that was heated. This room was perfect for us to both rest in at night as well as to relax during the day while we had our break between game drives. The pool was heated to a comfortable temperature for us to be able to take swims in it during our break as well.


Service


In general the service was strong at Dulini. Our camp manager Kerry did a great job of consulting with us throughout the stay to insure that we were satisfied and everything was going smoothly. We initially debated between paying to upgrade to a private vehicle or not and ultimately decided not to, but upon arrival we changed our minds. We informed Kerry that we‚Äôd prefer to go out alone, so she was able to procure a freelance guide to take us our privately because the Dulini lodges were already full and there were not additional guides available to take us out. Our butler John‚Äôs responsibilities were primarily to take care of us from a dining perspective and he was always quick with service at meal times and responsive to all of our requests.


Having stayed at spectacular safari lodges like Tswalu and Londolozi Tree Camp, we have seen what stands out in terms of superlative service and it when staff members take the time to engage with guests and go above and beyond simply fulfilling requests, and find ways to curate a truly special safari experience. We would have loved to have some sort of special meal whether it be a bush breakfast, boma dinner, or more substantial sundowner with snacks or treats prepared in the bush. During our 4 nights there, each night felt the same and there was never any over the top gestures that would have really elevated or enhanced the experience. I am viewing this through my lens of having been to a number of truly special safari lodges and how they separate themselves. Had I never been on safari before I never would have been able to formulate this type of critique. A huge aspect of safari that goes beyond the nuts and bolts of the experience is the emotional side of things and how one engages with the lodge, how given experiences make one feel, but I think this is an area of improvement for Dulini to be able to contend with some of the other top lodges in the Sabi Sands. From a hardware perspective, Leadwood is stunning and excellent, but the anticipatory service is an area that would really push Leadwood to a higher level.


During our game drives, we enjoyed our interactions with Wayne and Ty prior to going to our private vehicle. They were a strong team and always answered every question we had. They both were prompt with providing us with transportation to River Lodge when we would go to use the gym there during our breaks. Once we went to the private vehicle, we also enjoyed our tracker Chris. He made the experience more personal by helping the freelance guide customize our game drives and also found excellent spots for sundowners and coffee breaks. He also was prompt in driving us to and back from River Lodge to use the gym.


Game Drives


Our game drives over the 4 nights we stayed at Dulini were extremely fruitful. The western sector of the Sabi Sands that Dulini vehicles drive on is shared amongst Ulusaba, Inyati, Idube, Leopard Hills, and Savanna. We never felt like the amount of vehicles out on drives impacted our experience, but it was definitely an initial adjustment coming from the extremely low density of vehicles out on drives at Tswalu. The lodges definitely try to cooperate with one another, but there was some politicking that our freelance guide had to do to insure our spot at sightings and that procedures were followed. She and Chris (our tracker) did an excellent job of working together during our drives to give us a curated private vehicle experience. This personalization stood out for us and the game drives were the biggest highlight for us at Leadwood.


Our game drives were highly productive from a wildlife perspective, we were able to see the following species: lion, leopard, wild dog, elephant, white rhino, hippo, impala, nyala, kudu, duiker, steenbok, zebra, wildebeest, buffalo, scrub hare, spotted genet, side striped jackal, giraffe, bushbuck, waterbuck, slender mongoose, dwarf mongoose, white tailed mongoose, and banded mongoose.


Our biggest highlight took place when on our last afternoon game drive we started following the Rivala female as she was moving through thickets making her way towards the river clearing leading to Leadwood. She moved through the dried up riverbed and made her way up to room 1, scent marking the entire area. Earlier in the day our tracker Chris spotted tracks of a male leopard in the area, but we hadn‚Äôt gotten the chance to follow up on them. As we drove into the riverbed to cross and try to catch another glance of Rivala, the massive Euphorbia male leopard was at the top of the river picking up on on Rivala‚Äôs scent (his daughter‚Äôs scent). He also made his way up past room 1 at Leadwood. As we lost sight of Euphorbia, we turned and looked up the riverbed and there were vehicles at a sighting of the Vutomi male leopard as well (Euphorbia‚Äôs son, Rivala‚Äôs half-brother) who also picked up on both of the leopard‚Äôs scents and made his way through Leadwood as well! We circled around and made our way to the other end of the lodge and found the Vutomi male leopard slowly making his way around the pool and on the deck of room 4 (our room). Shortly thereafter the Euphorbia male leopard came to room 4 as well, but didn‚Äôt and up going on the deck. Our tracker speculated that there might be a dominance fight if the two males encountered one another, but we never saw them meet. Seeing 3 adult leopards in one sighting was truly chaotic and such a special opportunity. Another highlight from the game drives was seeing 5 lions work together to kill and start eating a buffalo. Although we did not see this completely through, once the buffalo was down we saw how strong their teamwork was with one lion covering its nostrils to suffocate the buffalo while the others attacked it. Lastly, due to the strong lion presence that had entered the property, the wild dogs chose to change their den site, so we got to see 10 adults and 10 wild dog puppies moving throughout the sector and got 2 great visuals of them crossing both the road and the riverbed. Our freelance guide and Chris were vital to us being able to maneuver and experience such unique and special sightings and we were extremely grateful.


Dining


The dining experience at Dulini overall had its highs and lows. Dinners consisted of: mushroom soup, butternut squash risotto, and salmon, followed by a curry night with lamb, vegetable, and chicken curries with naan bread and rice, followed by a carrot and ginger soup, prawn appetizer, tortellini, and beef filet, followed by a meal of rosted chicken and beef, potatoes, salad, and mixed vegetables. Lunches were predetermined and just brought out without us ordering, always including two types of salad or vegetable dish (couscous salad, red salad with tomatoes/peppers/strawberries, Asian peanut salad, etc.), a protein dish (seared tuna, lamb kofta, fish cakes), and usually some sort of fried dish (zucchini fritters, fish cakes, or fried quail). Breakfasts were served a la carte with my highlight being the avocado toast with poached eggs.


My wife and I definitely enjoyed the food for the most part, but we also would have appreciated the ability to order off a menu for ourselves rather than to just have food placed in front of us for nearly all meals without any consideration for our preferences or what we might have been craving at a given time. We thought the chef did a great job with the execution of each meal and we enjoyed her coming to verbally present our menus, but some level of customization would have made the dining experience more enjoyable overall.


Location/Facilities


Dulini Leadwood is located in the western sector of the Sabi Sands and provides the opportunity to game drive in a reserve absolutely teeming with wildlife. We have visited the Sabi Sands 3 times now and will continue to visit because it is truly a special reserve.


In terms of facilities, Leadwood has a small gym, main dining and sitting area, and a shared pool (that was not heated). We found having River Lodge be 5 minutes away was very helpful for us to be able to utilize the treadmill there (the gym at Leadwood is tiny and does not have a treadmill). Everything else that one might need can be found in each of the rooms, be it a private pool, large deck, sitting area, etc.


Overall


We are happy we chose to visit Dulini Leadwood and we were grateful we were able to spend 4 nights here. This is a very good safari lodge in an incredibly competitive market in the Sabi Sands. Leadwood excels in its game viewing, accommodations, location on the river, and friendly staff. What prevents it from being a notch or two above is an extra level of polish in terms of anticipatory service and elevated dining. That being said, we would absolutely recommend this lodge to other travelers who are seeking a luxury lodge in a private game reserve with excellent game viewing and very strong accommodations without paying the highest price point (Londolozi/Singita) for nightly rates.",1,1754737513.0,FATSafari,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm totally sold on the idea - fine coffee paired with a profile that takes the guesswork out of it so we can have the coffee at home as the roaster intended. It‚Äôs great, on paper. The one thing that‚Äôs missing from the equation for me is the recommended grind sizes and the listed range on the profile page. 

For example, I made the Flor Del Cafe from Square Mile today. The suggested grind size was 7-8.2 on an Ode Gen 2, our grinder. Since I was making 30oz (6 cups) worth, I decided to grind at an 8. Typically what I‚Äôll do is count the number of the recommended notches for the grind range, multiply by 30(oz) and divide by 50(oz) to get a rough pinpoint of how fine or coarse to go. I thought it was a good approach but I‚Äôd say this works for me about 25% of the time - usually there‚Äôs something missing in the result. The coffee either comes out too sour, bitter or bland and I have a hard time believing that was the intent. Like for our Square Mile brew, my wife and I like it but we aren‚Äôt getting any of the flavor notes. 

So that leads me back to my question, given that there‚Äôs a range of grind sizes, what‚Äôs your usual starting point? How do you minimize the amount of batches it takes to ‚Äúdial in‚Äù? Do you start at the finest value and work your way up? Or start in the middle and go up or down from there?

The lower base and level downgrade stings, but I think looking at the offer more holistically and the room for growth makes it more appealing. Additionally, I love my current manager and would say that would be the toughest thing to leave along with some great colleagues.

We had large layoffs a few months ago as well which definitely caused morale to go down. 

I received an offer from what has historically been a dream company of mine, highly established large tech company with a great office in nyc. That said, the offer will be 20k lower in base salary (but offers equity) at a junior IC level, and this is the very top of their band that I already negotiated to. They have way more benefits (free coffee, breakfast & lunch, hybrid schedule, 401k match, bonus, wellness stipend, etc).

The lower base and level downgrade stings, but I think looking at the offer more holistically and the room for growth makes it more appealing. Additionally, I love my current manager and would say that would be the toughest thing to leave along with some great colleagues.

Let‚Äôs break down the *Galaxy Brain* ways we all find ourselves chasing those precious coins:

- There‚Äôs the old-school 9-5. Safe, steady, not super spicy. (But then: hello, taxes! Bills! Why is eating vegetables so expensive?)
- There‚Äôs the side hustle. Is anyone else like, 60% sure that you‚Äôll just end up working more and sleeping less?
- There‚Äôs INVESTING but‚Ä¶ every time I try to learn, my brain goes ‚ÄúNope. Try https://goodnovel.org/ instead, it‚Äôs less stressful.‚Äù
- Some people go full entrepreneur mode‚Äîthe dream, right?! But hello, anxiety my old friend.

Wait, but here‚Äôs where I spiral: does ‚Äúearning money‚Äù even mean what we think it means? Do we want to earn JUST to pay bills, or are we supposed to chase ‚Äúfinancial freedom‚Äù? Is this something you learn in school? Because I remember more about mitochondria than building wealth.

But then I read something wild: money comes when you solve problems for other people.

- So, are we all just walking around, lowkey auditioning to be someone else‚Äôs problem solver?
- Or is the secret more like, finding a portal‚Äîone that‚Äôs just past your comfort zone, kind of hidden when you least expect it (like behind https://goodnovel.org/ lol), then BAM! Cash flow?

I have SO many questions.

Sometimes, it really, REALLY feels like career guides don‚Äôt actually know how to make it happen, and no one wants to admit it!

**So tell me:**
- What was the oddest thing you did to earn a dollar?
- Do you think there‚Äôs a ‚Äúright way,‚Äù or is it all luck and timing?
- Is passive income overrated? Because sometimes it feels like a unicorn that everyone swears is real‚Ä¶
- Does anyone else spend HOURS reading stories about financial success (sometimes on https://goodnovel.org/ to procrastinate ‚Äúreal work‚Äù) but then still not have a plan?

We applied in Alorica Alphaland since they have a one day opportunity for a Content Moderator role, and this is the account that I am looking and interested for. Although this affects your mental health, but at least, you are not taking calls nor being pressured over the metrics.

Anyway, we arrived in the recruitment hub around 11:30 AM and we thought that it will be a smooth hiring process since they knew that there should have many applicants because of the open role. However, we were given an applicant number and we were between 80-90. WE THOUGHT THAT WE WILL BE CATERED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF HR WHO ARRIVED AT THE HUB AROUND 12:00 PM.

But wtf, we were starved until 3:30 AM and yet the numbers who were in the initial interview are 44-49 and on the assessment were 31. So we did not continue in wasting our time since the HR stopped his initial interview and took a break and we did not know if there are other HRs who took over the process.

Note: There is only ONE HR who interviewed the applicants and one assistant for the assessment, the rest, sitting and drinking their coffee while looking uninterested to the hundred applicants.

I gave Alorica a benefit of the doubt even if I already knew how fucked up they are, yet they proved the hearsay correct. Well, it is not a hearsay anymore.

Post Script: Good luck to us, applicants. We hope that we will land the job we are striving for without risking our health. Still, thank you Alorica for a traumatic experience.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

1mlmlp1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mlmlp1,5 Nights at Tswalu Kalahari,"My wife and I spent 5 nights at Tswalu in the Kalahari Desert. Our first 3 nights were spent at Motse, followed by our final 2 nights being spent at Loapi. These experiences complimented one another with Motse being a communal lodge with shared dining, gym, boutique, and common areas. Loapi on the other hand offers a completely private villa experience with a personal chef as well as your own butler to assist with any requests you might have. The two were about 20 minutes apart. They are on opposite sides of the reserve from one another. Motse is in the main area which occupies approximately 90,000 hectares, where as Loapi is in the much smaller, but still quite large section that is 20,000 hectares. Game drives occur on both sides of the reserve and can often times cross over. The biggest difference between the two sides of the reserve is the presence of lions that are found on the smaller side of the reserve.


While we did our game drives, our guide informed us of the history of Tswalu. It used to be used for farming and there have been tremendous conservation efforts and research with attempts at restoration to its original form (or as close as possible) being the ultimate goal. As a result of this, there is a good deal of land and wildlife management that has taken place and continues to take place. This includes dividing the reserve into two sections, expanding the reserve with the purchase of adjacent properties over time, population management of predators and prey species, amongst plenty of other things that I‚Äôm sure go on behind the scenes. I‚Äôve read online where this type of experience might seem less ‚Äúwild‚Äù or ‚Äúpristine‚Äù than the safari experience in other countries, but we have not been to different countries yet to compare. This, however, is the world we live in these days and why some of these animals have such small populations remaining due to habitat destruction. We felt privileged to be able to visit a place that has healed and continues to do so and to be able to witness the recovery of the resilient species that now call this location home. That being said, when you are out on the reserve it feels as wild as can be with expansive views all around with diverse terrain including dunes and mountains. The reserve itself is larger than the entire Sabi Sands for comparison sake, giving you plenty of space to explore most times without seeing another vehicle. The caveat to this is that it took a while for us to get from the lodge to most of our sightings, but we saw interesting plains game that was new to us along the way and got to enjoy the beautiful red Kalahari and and rolling dunes.


Check in/Arrival


We arrived at JNB at 10am on a flight from Dubai and we were immediately greeted by someone who transferred us to the Fireblade Hangar which is where Tswalu‚Äôs flights arrive and take off from at JNB. We had a little while to wait, but this terminal was well outfitted with a small gym that I got a quick workout in at, as well a lunch available to order. I tried the ostrich burger and my wife ordered a toastie sandwich.


The flight was on a very comfortable and well outfitted plane. It took about an hour and a half or so to get to Tswalu. As soon as we started to see the sprawling Kalahari Desert from the air with its signature red sand, we knew we were in for a treat. Our guide (Vuyani) and tracker (MC) greeted us at the airstrip and we immediately jumped into safari mode, seeing a yellow mongoose and getting a lesson on sociable weaver nests that had been made on the roof of the lounge at the airstrip. We were driven to Motse where we would spend our first 3 nights, followed by the final 2 nights at Loapi. We were greeted by the Motse staff, shown around the common areas of Motse, and then taken to our room.


Room


Motse:
We were in room 10, this was the meerkat room. It was the furthest room down to the right of the lodge looking from the front. Although we booked a 1 bedroom suite, we were given a 2 bedroom suite which we didn‚Äôt really need, but were still blown away by the size of the suite. Overall, it is understandable why this lodge will be undergoing a renovation, as there is a bit of wear and tear on the hardware, but the space itself was quite nice with natural tones and a lot of stone used in the design. There was a shared living area between the two bedrooms, bedroom, and bathroom with both indoor and outdoor showers. The bedroom we used had a king bed with a bug net around it, with a really cool map of the property on the top of the bed so when you looked up you could reference it. The rooms at Motse are slightly cheaper than the rooms at Loapi, understandably so. The rooms at Motse show some age, but ultimately we are glad we chose to stay here because of the natural design of the room as well as the shared common spaces like the dining area, deck, boma, boutique, and gym.


Loapi:
After 3 nights at Motse we were transferred over to stay at Loapi for 2 nights. Our house at Loapi was considered to be #2, but that just means it was 2nd along the road that all of the houses were off of. The room we stayed in here (difficult to even call it a room, it‚Äôs really more of a private house) was spectacular. It included a living room, kitchen, office space, bedroom, massive deck with dining area and pool, and a bathroom with both indoor and outdoor showers. The materials used for Loapi are far less natural to the setting than Motse (more metallic and canvas vs. wood and stone), but the privacy afforded by staying here is unmatched. I joked to my wife that it was unfortunate that we could make out the next villa off in the distance, it really felt like we were completely alone. Going to Motse first followed by a couple of nights at Loapi felt like the perfect complimentary experience for us, especially in that order. We found Loapi to be modern, clean, while still maintaining its warmth and enough South African feel. We were thrilled we got to experience staying in this room for 2 nights.


Service


The service we experienced overall at Tswalu was good, but there are some important notes to differentiate where the service fell short, especially at the price point.


Guide + Tracker Service:
The service when it comes to the game drives provided by Vuyani and MC was truly superlative. When we stopped for coffee or sundowners they were both always quick to offer drinks, snacks, or even to take pictures for us. When we started with them, Vuyani explained to us that we could schedule our drives however we wanted and he made it known that because every guest gets a private vehicle at Tswalu, we were completely  free to do as we pleased. We told him what animals we were interested in seeing and that we were willing to spend quite a bit of time out on the reserve, so we trusted him to build our schedule and it turned out perfectly. Some days we had a bit longer breaks than others, but we were really happy with how everything went.


For an example of how Vuyani truly stood out not only as a safari guide, but also from a hospitality perspective was when we spent a long and cold morning searching for black rhino in an area that was in the shadow of one of the mountains. It was very cold and dark, but we used the hot water bottles and blankets to power through. While looking for the black rhinos, we also had been seeing some lion tracks, so we decided to focus on the lion tracks to try to track down the group of 4 Kalahari Black Maned Lions (2 males and 2 females). We arrived at an excellent sighting of them attempting to dig a warthog out of its burrow. I was intent on patiently waiting it out to see if we could see them successfully get the warthog, but it really was cold and windy. Vuyani picked up that my wife hadn‚Äôt been chatting as she usually had been throughout our usual game drives, so even though my wife was 50/50 on staying at the sighting, ultimately, his read of the situation was the right one. She needed to get warmed up a bit and even though I wanted to continue to stay at the sighting, trusting his judgment was the best one and ultimately was what was best for my wife. He also noticed she was a bit congested and I overheard him call ahead on the radio to our camp at Loapi to procure her a ginger/lemon/honey drink to warm her up and soothe any congesting she was dealing with.


Motse Service:
The service at Motse was unfortunately a bit of a low point. The meal service never felt warm, personal, or engaging, and there was no communication amongst staff for preferences. The best lodge we have stayed at prior to this is Londolozi Tree Camp and using this as a basis of comparison (as they are priced in the same ballpark), and as a point of reference there they always got my wife‚Äôs coffee order right prior to game drives and they always knew she preferred to have the coffee in a to go cup to take with us on the drives. On numerous days our guide Vuyani was the one to make sure that she got her coffee put into a to go cup. There were also multiple occasions of completely botched breakfast orders, one time I ordered the shakshuka and was brought the charcuterie board. It just didn‚Äôt seem like the staff was as diligent, trained, or unified as one would expect at this caliber and price point. There weren‚Äôt necessarily other egregious mistakes I can point out, but there was certainly nothing superlative about the assistance we received in our time at Motse. One memorable bright spot was Wendy who was warm, friendly, and always willing to take time to speak with us to help us, or give us some history of the reserve (she had been working there for 28 years).


Loapi Service:
Any issues we had with the service at Motse were immediately resolved once we moved over to Loapi. There we were given a homathi (host/butler). Tumi was our homathi and she was excellent. Even though we only stayed 2 nights, she was receptive to and on top of any requests we had. She was friendly and helpful without being intrusive because the staff at Loapi are in the same space as the guests at times. She was a big part of making our experience at Loapi an excellent one.


Game Drives


As mentioned above, Vuyani and MC were critical parts of us having a highly memorable experience at Tswalu. I give them both huge credit for the wildlife viewing we were able to enjoy, while also acknowledging their immense knowledge of the biome that makes up this reserve. Vuyani was much more vocal and personable, but we also enjoyed when MC spoke up and shared his deep knowledge of the ecosystem. When we first were paired up with these two, we told them we had been to the Sabi Sands twice, so we were looking to see some species that we wouldn‚Äôt be able to see in the Sabi Sands (we also were visiting the Sabi Sands for a third time immediately after our stay at Tswalu). We also told Vuyani that we were willing to get out and put in time to track down some of the elusive species that live on the reserve and also that we were willing to go out whenever he thought would give us the best chance to see some animals in action. He told us that his aim was to give us quality, uncrowned sightings and he certainly delivered on that. During our game drives we saw the following species: cheetah, wild dog, lion, white rhino, meerkat, mountain zebra, black-backed jackal, brown hyena, spotted hyena, giraffe, eland, roan, sable, kudu, oryx, springbok, steenbok, red hartebeest, warthog, wildebeest, yellow mongoose, slender mongoose, impala, ostrich, spring hare, and ground squirrel.


The difference between Tswalu and the other safari destinations we‚Äôve visited was the density of animals. It‚Äôs much lighter at Tswalu compared to the Sabi Sands, but we saw plenty of animals during our trip, it just required more driving, more flexibility, and more willingness to put in the time to appreciate the empty space while enjoying the beautiful views of the red sand dunes, mountains, and open plains. The beauty that once we found ourselves within a sighting, there was not pressure from multiple vehicles attempting to join us, typically we were completely alone at a sighting. If we were joined there was only a 2nd vehicle at a sighting. With Vuyani and MC‚Äôs expertise, we most often were the first ones to locate the animals with other guides following up.


One of the highlights of our stay from a wildlife perspective was locating the wild dog pack on a crisp morning. The dogs ended up sleeping on top of one of the small mountains and Vuyani and MC literally climbed to the top of the mountain in search of them, from there the dogs made their way down off the mountain, and moved along as the sun rose. We followed them for a bit, with Vuyani affording me tremendous photographic opportunities during this sighting, ultimately for them to settle down after moving a mile or two away from the mountain. Vuyani suggested we leave them, quickly go for lunch and head out early in the afternoon (2pm rather than 3:30pm as we had previously done). We returned to them at around 2:30pm, finding them exactly where they were and Vuyani‚Äôs knowledge of their habits and behavior really paid off, as around 3:30pm they began to move and had we arrived later we would already be behind them. Watching this pack of wild dogs hunt was truly a highlight for us. Seeing their organization, determination, and discipline to feed their group was something we were privileged to witness. We saw them make an attempt at hunting a group of adult roan which was quickly unsuccessful and then 20 minutes later they located a group of oryx, including a mother and baby. They isolated the baby and the mother moved it into a thicket, kicking and using its horns to deter the dogs from attacking the baby oryx. After 10 minutes of a struggle and blood drawn on the baby, the dogs moved on and gave up. 15 minutes later they located another group of oryx and targeted a subadult which they ultimately successful hunted. This was an incredible scene to witness and without Vuyani and MC‚Äôs knowledge of these animals and the reserve there is no chance we would have been able to have the privilege of witnessing this. Because of the low vehicle density of Tswalu, we were able to enjoy this sighting for over 6 hours throughout the day without having to make room for other vehicles. Another highlight of ours was tracking and locating a mother cheetah with 3 cubs. We were able to see her groom them, leave them on top of the dune while she went to hunt (she was ultimately unsuccessful), and bond with her cubs as they played around. We located this mother female twice during our stay and for one sighting of over an hour we were the only vehicle there and fit the other sighting there was just one other vehicle. Lastly, although we were ultimately unable to view a pangolin, one of the highlights for us was using the telemetry tracker to locate the burrow that the pangolin they have tagged for research was, approaching on foot at a distance, and then waiting for it to come out into the night. We decided to head back after a couple of hours of waiting, but nonetheless it was an exciting time spent tracking it and learning a bit more about their secretive lives.


Dining


Motse Dining:
Unfortunately, the Motse dining experience we had was subpar. The breakfast were quite unremarkable, the shakshuka while adequate, did nothing to excite me about the dining experience. Our last morning at Motse we had a bush breakfast (eggs, bacon, sausage, brown toast) which was also very disappointing. A big highlight for us on previous safaris has been the dining experience with inspired dishes and plenty of excellent meals that we have always looked forward to. For our two dinners we had at Motse, we did not have a menu to choose from. The first night they brought out oxtail stew, butternut squash cups filled with beans, peppers, and goat cheese, fried quail wings, and some naan bread with an assortment of pestos. This was not a memorable meal at all. For our last dinner at Motse it was served in the boma and they prepared a braai with beef sausage, lamb chops, roasted chicken, butternut squash, corn on the cob, and curried cabbage. For this meal we invited our guide and tracker, and asked the staff to prepare a birthday cake for our guide Vuyani. We really enjoyed listening to him share his stories of being out in nature and saw his deep gratitude for us recognizing his birthday and wanting him to be included in our experience at Tswalu. Our last dinner that we were served while staying at Motse was at Boscia House. This is their adapted version of the Klein Jan restaurant that unfortunately flooded. This included a fine dining tasting meal which included potato gnocchi with leeks, butternut squash bobotie, roasted quail, gemsbok pie, and a local salad. We also got to try a wide variety of cheeses from their ‚Äúcheese island‚Äù in the middle of the restaurant. The rice pudding dessert with cinnamon was excellent.


Overall our dining experience at Motse was disappointing. This is a part of the safari experience that we have come to love and this particular lodge did not deliver in this area.


Loapi Dining:
A huge highlight of our time at Loapi was the dining and our chef Ridwaan did an amazing job of listening to our preferences and tailoring the meals to what we had in mind. We told him we wanted to try local meats, that we loved vegetables/salads, and that soups were great as well. For our two dinners at Loapi we were served a mushroom soup, ostrich steak with parsnips and sweet potato followed by our own braai consisting of eland steak, beef sausages, lamb chops, pap with peppers and sauces to give it flavor, butternut squash, eggplant, corn on the cob, and all of the breads were excellent. We had a beef filet, with roasted potatoes, and a mixed salad with a great vinaigrette dressing for our lunch upon arrival. Lastly, for our brunch Ridwaan really too into consideration that we wanted to try local dishes so he served us a bobotie (basically a breakfast casserole with eggs, potatoes, and ground beef and lamb) which was excellent, along with another salad with a pesto vinaigrette. He also prepared us toast and fruit as we requested early in the mornings before our game drives. Our dining experience at Loapi was excellent.


Location/Facilities


The remote nature of Tswalu is a huge part of the attraction to the property for visitors. The charter flight makes arrival easy and seamless. The reserve itself is visually stunning, providing plenty of landscape photographic opportunities. Located in the Kalahari Desert, it is very dry, so consistent hydration is a must. Also, there‚Äôs a large temperature delta from the mornings and evenings to the mid afternoons, so it is highly advisable to layer up for the morning drives and be prepared to take them off as the drive goes on and then the opposite for the evening drives. Something worth nothing is that the reserve is divided into 2 sections. From my understanding from a wildlife perspective the only difference is that one side has lions and one doesn‚Äôt. The side Motse is on does not have lions, and is significantly bigger (90,000 hectares vs. 20,000 hectares) than the side that Loapi is on that does have lions.


In terms of facilities, Motse has a shared pool, small gym, and a shopping boutique. The pool was far too cold to utilize, but we went and used the gym daily and bought some Tswalu souvenirs in the boutique. Loapi by its private nature does not have any shared facilities, but the pool on the deck is heated and we used it one afternoon. A shared gym at Loapi would make sense in my opinion to provide Loapi guests with a space to exercise during their stay.


Overall


Our stay at Tswalu was excellent overall. Despite some of the shortcomings of Motse (some of which will be dealt with during the upcoming renovations), this is our second favorite hotel experience we have had (behind Londolozi Tree Camp). Our experience with our guide Vuyani, as well as the privacy and level of personalization of everything is what set it apart for us. Combining these aspects with the reserve‚Äôs diverse landscape and wildlife is what made it truly stand out. Getting to stay at Loapi for 2 nights was the cherry on top for us and culminated a wonderful experience for us that inspired us to want to return.",5,1754736917.0,FATSafari,0,0.86,False

And at last, it arrives. Softly, like a secret, yet boldly, like a lover who knows they are awaited. The weekend. That shimmering slice of time when the hours loosen their collars, and the days finally exhale.

It is the gentle clink of coffee cups in the morning light, the languid stretch under sun-dappled sheets, the sacred art of doing everything and nothing at all. It is errands turned into adventures, naps disguised as noble self-care, and evenings that linger like a favorite song refusing to end.

The weekend asks for no clock-in, no hurried footsteps down sterile hallways. Instead, it offers a pact: Come, be yours again. Be the book you‚Äôve been meaning to open. Be the road you‚Äôve longed to wander. Be the friend who laughs too loudly, the dreamer who stays up too late, the soul who lives without checking the time.

However, the main thing about this home is I want it to change my life (!). A more considered, more mindful, quiet, less rushed day. I work from home and run my own business so the only barrier to this currently is me. Which brings me to coffee.

I currently have a De Longhi AIO. It is okay. I have a black double espresso first thing and then an americano or two during the day. I also have a Sage drip coffee maker in my office and a V60 but these are only occasionally used.

I like chocolatey and rich espresso but that could be because I havent really experimented with third wave lighter stuff. Never add milk to anything and not that interested in learning for guests. 

I have all but settled on a Niche Zero (black) for the grinder. I'm favouring a Rancillo Silvia ProX (black) for the machine but I would really appreciate your expertise. For this ""new"" life I just want a really lovely workflow and insanely good espresso.

I (24 F) have been friend with Harry (29 M) for 3 years, He introduced me to Jack (28M) and Leo (27M) a few months ago and I became part of the group pretty fast (They are all gay). Jack and Leo started dating around 2 years ago (Leo and Harry were friends long before they started dating) and had been living together for 1 and a half till the broke up. Now, here is the thing, Jack had lied to Leo since before they started dating (obviously he had lied to us too).
After them dating for more than a year Jack admitted SOME of the things he had lied about, I am not gonna tell you the lies but, for example, he said that he had a death brother that died in a car crash (lie). Leo forgave him but warned him that if he discovered any other lie they will be done. Guess what? Plenty of other lies and when Leo discovered those, he broke up with Jack. Obviously from my and Harry¬¥s part we don‚Äôt trust him like nothing. Not only he lied but, when Leo broke up with him, he didn‚Äôt respect his wish of going no contact, he tried to use us, and other people, as bridge to reach him (obviously, it didn‚Äôt work). Harry and I met Jack for a coffee and we made it very clear that we don‚Äôt trust him, but that we can meet eventually,  Okey, now the AH part.
When they were together, the 4 of us bought a ticket to a concert in another city. Harry and I booked place to stay, and Jack and Leo were supposed to stay in the house were Jacks ‚Äòcousin lived (lie, there is no cousin). When they broke up it all fall apart, and we decided to divide into two groups (in other for them being apart from each other as long as they can). Now, Jack and Leo have both been seen different people since they broke up, and Leo met up with a guy and he discovered that, when they were still together, Jack and that guy flirted, he cheated. Now, we did have our suspicions, but nothing confirmed. When he told us that it was over us. Now here comes the real AH part, they city is pretty far from where we live and we wanted to stay for an extra day to go to different places, but Jack didn‚Äôt wanna do it, when we confirmed the cheating we decided to change plans. Harry and I canceled our booking a booked something for Leo, Harry and Me and change our plane tickets, but we have not tell Jack yet, we are gonna tell him tomorrow. I kinda of feel bad but at the same time he did this to himself. He is a grown ass men.

PD: When they broke up, the next day, Jack meet with one of the persons we suspect he cheated with.

After five years of marriage, Natalia Webb received an unexpected invitation to a child's birthday party.

The message came from a mutual friend of hers and her husband, Alexander Powell. Moments later, the friend withdrew it‚Äîbut Natalia had already seen it.

The name of the child‚Äôs father on the invitation made her hands shake.

Alexander Powell.

Though common names existed, Natalia couldn‚Äôt ignore the sinking feeling in her chest. The next day, she found herself outside the party venue.

Inside the decorated hall, Alexander lifted a little girl into the air as she laughed and made a wish: ""I want Daddy to spend more time with me and Mommy!""

Beside them, a woman kissed the girl‚Äôs cheek before smiling at Alexander. ""My wish is for us to always be happy together.""

Natalia‚Äôs mind went numb.

A name could be coincidence‚Äîbut not that face. Twelve years together, five as his wife‚Äîshe knew him better than anyone.

Even among the guests, she spotted familiar faces.

Watching the picture-perfect family, Natalia‚Äôs eyes burned, but she couldn‚Äôt bring herself to step forward.

She turned and left.

The city streets buzzed with life, but her heart had frozen over.

She remembered their third anniversary, when she‚Äîonce firm about never having children‚Äîhad excitedly suggested, ""Alexander, let‚Äôs try for a baby.""

She‚Äôd expected joy, or at least surprise.

Instead, he‚Äôd hesitated before pulling her close.

""The company‚Äôs in a good place, but let‚Äôs wait a little longer, okay?""

Back then, she‚Äôd believed him.

Now, the truth hit like a slap.

How foolish she‚Äôd been.

They‚Äôd met in high school, academic rivals battling for first place.

At university, he‚Äôd pursued her relentlessly for a year.

From then on, his love had been all-consuming.

He was cold to everyone‚Äîexcept her.

During sophomore winter, when she had dawn classes, he brought her breakfast daily‚Äîcroissants kept warm in his coat, coffee steaming in a thermos.

Junior year, when a misdiagnosis suggested leukemia, he lit candles in the chapel and prayed for her.

At graduation, she fell during a dance performance. He didn‚Äôt leave her hospital bedside for three sleepless days.

When she woke, disoriented, he‚Äôd sobbed.

""Marry me. I can‚Äôt lose you.""

Later, she learned doctors had feared she wouldn‚Äôt wake.

Yet Alexander had knelt before her parents, swearing, ""Even if she never opens her eyes again, I‚Äôll marry her. She‚Äôs my only wife.""

After graduation, they wed.

When Alexander took over as CEO, his devotion never wavered‚Äîuntil even she, once childfree, dreamed of his baby.

She never imagined this.

Natalia dialed Alexander‚Äôs number.

He answered, background chatter faint behind him.

His voice was warm. ""Natalia, to what do I owe the pleasure?""

Across the street, she watched him step outside, his height making him stand out effortlessly.

""Alexander, where are you?""

He chuckled. ""Just wrapped up a meeting. Shopping for your surprise. Miss me?""

His tone deepened. ""I miss you. I want you.""",1,1754736340.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

One instant, you were in your own world ‚Äî coffee in hand, half-asleep in your bed, shouting at someone across the street ‚Äî and the next, you opened your eyes to a place that could not exist.

An endless black void. Air that is still and cold but smells faintly of rain. A single table, polished wood, lit by a light with no source. And at it ‚Äî a man in a perfect suit, his pale hands folded, his chair too far from the ground to seem natural.

Around you, others stand. Strangers, every one of them, but all with the same startled look.

He studies you all in silence for what feels like hours before finally speaking. His voice is patient, precise, and impossibly deep.

*‚ÄúI will give you a choice. Three doors. Only one may you walk through, and you must choose together.‚Äù*

He lifts a hand, and behind him, three shapes form from the darkness. Not doors of wood or stone, but visions‚Äîraw and alive.

The first, you feel as if you've gone back far in time. Ships blacken the waters, and the sky is filled with storms. War rages, and empires fall.

The second, you see starships filling the skies, people trading 'eddies,' robots, androids, and Special Police. It's a far future.

The final door, you see something Alien. Be it dragons flying about the sky or men fighting in speeds you can barely see, their hair yellow, spikey...

The visions fade. The man‚Äôs eyes never blink.

*‚ÄúThe choice is yours‚Ä¶ and once made, it cannot be undone.‚Äù*

Someone skids into the oncoming lane, grabs what looks like a cup of coffee, and drives off, hitting someone on the way.

Motorcycle and unicycle stunts.

A person smashes through a floor-to-ceiling first-floor window, stops a taxi, lies on the trunk/rear glass, and is driven away.

Someone lies down and rolls down the stairs; a motorcycle also rides down the stairs.

A person on fire shakes hands with a passerby.

A motorcycle rides up the stairs, breaks through a window into a lobby, and hands something to the counter (there‚Äôs even a ‚Äúno motorcycles‚Äù sign there).

Finally, the helicopter from the beginning flies to a rooftop conference room and hovers there. A person jumps out, smashes the skylight, falls into the room, climbs up, and sits down for a meeting. Another person falls in, and that‚Äôs the end.

It had a very frantic, absurd tone ‚Äî like a cross between a Red Bull extreme sports video and a slapstick action movie.

I found a commercial with a similar vibe here:

but it‚Äôs not the same ad. The pacing, music, and energy felt similar though.

I was scared because 10 minutes ago she had said that she liked my friend and they had kissed and stuff like that together. Another phase was when we met all our friends outside and had a drink and then y wasn't there, I remember we had both gotten up and were further from the group and we hugged each other in a way we had never hugged before and we were kind of holding hands (yes, I felt bad) and in the end she said that she loved me and that at 35 if we were single we should get married.

Three months ago, I got insulted when I said people should be buying in bulk at $1,800. Then I got called a ‚Äúbeginner‚Äù when I tried to explain why Ethereum was stuck at $2,500. And then‚Ä¶ when I said ETH = $80k is just simple math, people said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never even heard of market cap.‚Äù :-D

And every single time, I said it would keep going up, and every single time I got shot down by people who apparently see themselves as professionals. I‚Äôm not saying my predictions will be 100% accurate, but I want to give hope to anyone buying and holding Ethereum.

Because Ethereum has momentum - it‚Äôs been building for months, and for months it‚Äôs been one good piece of news after another. For me, Ethereum hitting $10k by the end of the year has almost felt like a given for weeks now. Since $1,800, since $2,500, since $3,500‚Ä¶ and soon, when it breaks $4,500 and then its all-time high. All the green lights are on - it‚Äôs just a matter of time.

So, to all the Ethereum believers out there, like I am - and yes, I‚Äôve only been in this for four months. Does that make me more of a beginner? Maybe. But I‚Äôve been trading the stock market for years. I‚Äôm not here for the little 10% up or down moves. I‚Äôm a HODLER.

And you should be too - don‚Äôt drive yourself crazy. Buy it, hodl it, grab a coffee, touch some grass.

After five years of marriage, Natalia Webb received an unexpected invitation to a child's birthday party.

The message came from a mutual friend of hers and her husband, Alexander Powell. Moments later, the friend withdrew it‚Äîbut Natalia had already seen it.

The name of the child‚Äôs father on the invitation made her hands shake.

Alexander Powell.

Though common names existed, Natalia couldn‚Äôt ignore the sinking feeling in her chest. The next day, she found herself outside the party venue.

Inside the decorated hall, Alexander lifted a little girl into the air as she laughed and made a wish: ""I want Daddy to spend more time with me and Mommy!""

Beside them, a woman kissed the girl‚Äôs cheek before smiling at Alexander. ""My wish is for us to always be happy together.""

Natalia‚Äôs mind went numb.

A name could be coincidence‚Äîbut not that face. Twelve years together, five as his wife‚Äîshe knew him better than anyone.

Even among the guests, she spotted familiar faces.

Watching the picture-perfect family, Natalia‚Äôs eyes burned, but she couldn‚Äôt bring herself to step forward.

She turned and left.

The city streets buzzed with life, but her heart had frozen over.

She remembered their third anniversary, when she‚Äîonce firm about never having children‚Äîhad excitedly suggested, ""Alexander, let‚Äôs try for a baby.""

She‚Äôd expected joy, or at least surprise.

Instead, he‚Äôd hesitated before pulling her close.

""The company‚Äôs in a good place, but let‚Äôs wait a little longer, okay?""

Back then, she‚Äôd believed him.

Now, the truth hit like a slap.

How foolish she‚Äôd been.

They‚Äôd met in high school, academic rivals battling for first place.

At university, he‚Äôd pursued her relentlessly for a year.

From then on, his love had been all-consuming.

He was cold to everyone‚Äîexcept her.

During sophomore winter, when she had dawn classes, he brought her breakfast daily‚Äîcroissants kept warm in his coat, coffee steaming in a thermos.

Junior year, when a misdiagnosis suggested leukemia, he lit candles in the chapel and prayed for her.

At graduation, she fell during a dance performance. He didn‚Äôt leave her hospital bedside for three sleepless days.

When she woke, disoriented, he‚Äôd sobbed.

""Marry me. I can‚Äôt lose you.""

Later, she learned doctors had feared she wouldn‚Äôt wake.

Yet Alexander had knelt before her parents, swearing, ""Even if she never opens her eyes again, I‚Äôll marry her. She‚Äôs my only wife.""

After graduation, they wed.

When Alexander took over as CEO, his devotion never wavered‚Äîuntil even she, once childfree, dreamed of his baby.

She never imagined this.

Natalia dialed Alexander‚Äôs number.

He answered, background chatter faint behind him.

His voice was warm. ""Natalia, to what do I owe the pleasure?""

Across the street, she watched him step outside, his height making him stand out effortlessly.

""Alexander, where are you?""

He chuckled. ""Just wrapped up a meeting. Shopping for your surprise. Miss me?""

His tone deepened. ""I miss you. I want you.""",1,1754736137.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

We had large layoffs a few months ago as well which definitely caused morale to go down. 

I received an offer from what has historically been a dream company of mine, highly established large tech company with a great office in nyc. That said, the offer will be 20k lower in base salary (but offers equity) at a junior IC level, and this is the very top of their band that I already negotiated to. They have way more benefits (free coffee, breakfast & lunch, hybrid schedule, 401k match, bonus, wellness stipend, etc).

The lower base and level downgrade stings, but I think looking at the offer more holistically and the room for growth makes it more appealing. Additionally, I love my current manager and would say that would be the toughest thing to leave along with some great colleagues.

I feel so torn - do I take this new offer?? ",1,1754735962.0,jobhunting,1,0.67,False

We currently live in a rented home his parents used to live in with his brother (Max) 24M. His parents are now retired in another country and Max stayed behind in the home. When they left my husband and I moved into the home they were renting. So now in the home it‚Äôs the three of us. Max is very much to himself and has always been babied, he is ‚Äúblunt‚Äù aka rude and uncaring of others. He has no respect for anyone not even his own parents. His parents and Tim did everything for him and he never really learned to do things on his own. Now that his parents left his mom sort of joked at one point that I would need to help.. uhm, no. I‚Äôm no one‚Äôs maid or mom and he‚Äôs a grown man. 

At first there were things here and there that bugged me a bit but I asked Tim to mention to his brother that chores would need to be a communal thing at least for the shared spaces; kitchen and bathroom. I wasn‚Äôt asking much just if the trash is full- take it out, clean up after cooking for yourself, after the trash has been picked up bring in the bins, wash your own dishes, if there is a spill clean it, etc etc. 

Nothing changed, he would leave the toilet seat up, there would be pee all over the floor around the toilet. One time, I forgot to put a bag in the trash bin and he threw away his sardines in the new trash bin so it smelled bad.
He doesn‚Äôt bring in the bins or help clean the bathroom. Sometimes I would find spilled coffee grounds or rice on the counter. Once he got drunk in his room and threw up everywhere came out to the living room and went to sleep. We found out morning after that he tried to vacuum it up with our brand new vacuum cleaner, it still gives off a nasty smell when you use it and this happened almost a year ago. 

Now Max is refusing to close the door after coming home at night. We don‚Äôt live in a terrible area but it‚Äôs not nice either. Our home has double doors, since I‚Äôve moved in, I have been locking both doors. We all have keys and the same key opens both doors. Max works late sometimes he comes back at 2am/4am/7am we don‚Äôt know his schedule but these are the times he‚Äôll come back. We have a solid door inside and a grate door outside, he will lock the grate door but leaves the solid door open. I‚Äôve let him know to close and lock the door when he gets in and Tim has also mentioned it to him. 

He came home tonight and left the door open. 
Side note: we also want the door closed cuz our dog has sensitive hearing and will bark at anything and with the solid door closed he doesn‚Äôt hear all the outside noises. 
Anyways, I msged him again that he needs to close and Lock the door when returning. He replied back ‚ÄúLeave it unlocked for me and I will‚Äù. At this point, since my husband hates confrontation, I know he isn‚Äôt going to do anything or say anything and I‚Äôm tired of feeling like I‚Äôm not safe in my own home and not feeling respected. And anytime I try to talk to Tim about it he thinks I‚Äôm attacking him and his family. Or he‚Äôll say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt make him do anything‚Äù 

I‚Äôve been thinking about leaving, I don‚Äôt have a job or savings or a car. I got let go in July and have been looking, my saving that I did have I used for bills. So I feel so trapped, and I love my husband so much but I don‚Äôt feel valued or supported. I wouldn‚Äôt have anywhere to go but I‚Äôm not sure what to do at this point. Tim also isn‚Äôt willing to kick his brother out or have us move due to the economy and our financial circumstances. 

Can anyone give advice? Am I in the wrong for wanting to leave? Am I asking for too much in order to have a safe and clean environment not only for me but my family? (Husband and pets)

You remember the moment your life ended. It wasn‚Äôt with a scream. It wasn‚Äôt even with pain. It was a blink. One instant, you were in your own world ‚Äî coffee in hand, half-asleep in your bed, shouting at someone across the street ‚Äî and the next, you opened your eyes to a place that could not exist.

An endless black void. Air that is still and cold but smells faintly of rain. A single table, polished wood, lit by a light with no source. And at it ‚Äî a man in a perfect suit, his pale hands folded, his chair too far from the ground to seem natural.

Around you, others stand. Strangers, every one of them, but all with the same startled look.

He studies you all in silence for what feels like hours before finally speaking. His voice is patient, precise, and impossibly deep.

*‚ÄúI will give you a choice. Three doors. Only one may you walk through, and you must choose together.‚Äù*

He lifts a hand, and behind him, three shapes form from the darkness. Not doors of wood or stone, but visions‚Äîraw and alive.

The first, you feel as if you've gone back far in time. Ships blacken the waters, and the sky is filled with storms. War rages, and empires fall.

The second, you see starships filling the skies, people trading 'eddies,' robots, androids, and Special Police. It's a far future.

The final door, you see something Alien. Be it dragons flying about the sky or men fighting in speeds you can barely see, their hair yellow, spikey...

The visions fade. The man‚Äôs eyes never blink.

*‚ÄúThe choice is yours‚Ä¶ and once made, it cannot be undone.‚Äù*

I (24 F) have been friend with Harry (29 M) for 3 years, He introduced me to Jack (28M) and Leo (27M) a few months ago and I became part of the group pretty fast (They are all gay). Jack and Leo started dating around 2 years ago (Leo and Harry were friends long before they started dating) and had been living together for 1 and a half till the broke up. Now, here is the thing, Jack had lied to Leo since before they started dating (obviously he had lied to us too).
After them dating for more than a year Jack admitted SOME of the things Jack had lied about, I am not gonna tell you the lies but, for example, he said that he had a death brother that died in a car crash (lie). Leo forgave him but warned him that if he discovered any other lie they will be done. Guess what? Plenty of other lies and when Leo discovered those, he broke up with Jack. Obviously from my and Harry¬¥s part we don‚Äôt trust him like nothing. Not only he lied but, when Leo broke up with him, he didn‚Äôt respect his wish of going no contact, he tried to use us, and other people, as bridge to reach him (obviously, it didn‚Äôt work). Harry and I met Jack for a coffee and we made it very clear that we don‚Äôt trust him, but that we can meet eventually,  Okey, now the AH part.
When they were together, the 4 of us bought a ticket to a concert in another city. Harry and I booked place to stay, and Jack and Leo were supposed to stay in the house were Jacks' cousin lived (lie, there is no cousin). When they broke up it all fall apart, and Harry and I decided to divide into two groups (in other for them being apart from each other as long as they can). Now, Jack and Leo have both been seen different people since they broke up, and Leo met up with a guy and he discovered that, when they were still together, Jack and that guy flirted, he cheated. Now, we did have our suspicions, but nothing confirmed. When he told us that it was over us. Now here comes the real AH part, they city is pretty far from where we live and we wanted to stay for an extra day to go to different places, but Jack didn‚Äôt wanna do it, when we confirmed the cheating we decided to change plans. Harry and I canceled our booking a booked something for Leo, Harry and Me, and we changed our plane tickets, but we have not tell Jack yet, we are gonna tell him tomorrow. I kinda of feel bad but at the same time he did this to himself. He is a grown ass men.

PD: When they broke up, the next day, Jack meet with one of the persons we suspect he cheated with.

ou remember the moment your life ended. It wasn‚Äôt with a scream. It wasn‚Äôt even with pain. It was a blink. One instant, you were in your own world ‚Äî coffee in hand, half-asleep in your bed, shouting at someone across the street ‚Äî and the next, you opened your eyes to a place that could not exist.

An endless black void. Air that is still and cold but smells faintly of rain. A single table, polished wood, lit by a light with no source. And at it ‚Äî a man in a perfect suit, his pale hands folded, his chair too far from the ground to seem natural.

Around you, others stand. Strangers, every one of them, but all with the same startled look.

He studies you all in silence for what feels like hours before finally speaking. His voice is patient, precise, and impossibly deep.

*‚ÄúI will give you a choice. Three doors. Only one may you walk through, and you must choose together.‚Äù*

He lifts a hand, and behind him, three shapes form from the darkness. Not doors of wood or stone, but visions‚Äîraw and alive.

The first, you feel as if you've gone back far in time. Ships blacken the waters, and the sky is filled with storms. War rages, and empires fall.

The second, you see starships filling the skies, people trading 'eddies,' robots, androids, and Special Police. It's a far future.

The final door, you see something Alien. Be it dragons flying about the sky or men fighting in speeds you can barely see, their hair yellow, spikey...

The visions fade. The man‚Äôs eyes never blink.

*‚ÄúThe choice is yours‚Ä¶ and once made, it cannot be undone.‚Äù*

I (24 F) have been friend with Harry (29 M) for 3 years, He introduced me to Jack (28M) and Leo (27M) a few months ago and I became part of the group pretty fast (They are all gay). Jack and Leo started dating around 2 years ago (Leo and Harry were friends long before Leo and Jack started dating) and had been living together for 1 and a half till the broke up. Now, here is the thing, Jack had lied to Leo since before they started dating (obviously he had lied to us too).
After them dating for more than a year Jack admitted SOME of the things he had lied about, I am not gonna tell you the lies but, for example, he said that he had a death brother that died in a car crash (lie). Leo forgave him but warned him that if he discovered any other lie they will be done. Guess what? Plenty of other lies and when Leo discovered those, he broke up with Jack. Obviously from my and Harry¬¥s part we don‚Äôt trust him like nothing. Not only he lied but, when Leo broke up with him, he didn‚Äôt respect his wish of going no contact, he tried to use us, and other people, as bridge to reach him (obviously, it didn‚Äôt work). Harry and I met Jack for a coffee and we made it very clear that we don‚Äôt trust him, but that we can meet eventually. Okey, now the AH part.
When they were together, the 4 of us bought a ticket to a concert in another city. Harry and I booked place to stay, and Jack and Leo were supposed to stay in the house were Jacks' cousin lived (lie, there is no cousin). When they broke up it all fall apart, and Harry and I decided to divide into two groups (in other for them being apart from each other as long as they can). Now, Jack and Leo have both been seen different people since they broke up, and Leo met up with a guy and he discovered that, when they were still together, Jack and that guy flirted, he cheated. Now, we did have our suspicions, but nothing confirmed. When he told us that, it was over us. Now here comes the real AH part, they city is pretty far from where we live and we wanted to stay for an extra day to go to different places, but Jack didn‚Äôt wanna do it, when we confirmed the cheating we decided to change plans. Harry and I canceled our booking and booked something for Leo, Harry and Me, and we a los changed our plane tickets, but we have not tell Jack yet, we are gonna tell him tomorrow. I kinda of feel bad but at the same time he did this to himself. He is a grown ass men.

PD: When they broke up, the next day, Jack meet with one of the persons we suspect he cheated with.
