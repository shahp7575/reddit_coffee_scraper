How is this even possible? Isn't this more like the opposite of diabetes?

Before it slowly climbs back 1 hour later.  If I don't eat for 10 hours, it's back at 150+  I'm usually at 120 during the day but it will drop to <60 within 10 mins of eating basically anything.    My eyesight is getting blurry and I can't see well first thing in the AM or in the PM. Eye doctor said it's due to fluctuating glucose levels.

ƒ∞ngiltere'de e≈üimle yeni bir hayata ba≈ülama s√ºrecinde ya≈üadƒ±ƒüƒ±m deneyimler, aile birle≈üimi vizesi ba≈üvurusu yapanlar i√ßin faydalƒ± bir rehber olabilir. Bu yazƒ±da, ba≈üvuru s√ºrecinin kritik noktalarƒ±nƒ± ve dikkat edilmesi gereken detaylarƒ± adƒ±m adƒ±m a√ßƒ±klƒ±yorum.

# Finansal ≈ûartlarƒ± Anlamak: Gelir ve Tasarruf Y√∂netimi

[ƒ∞ngiltere aile birle≈üimi vizesi](https://ingiltereailebirlesimisinavi.com/) ba≈üvurularƒ±nda finansal yeterlilik, en √∂nemli gerekliliklerden biridir. Sponsorluk yapacak ki≈üinin yƒ±llƒ±k minimum **¬£18,600** gelir ≈üartƒ±nƒ± saƒülamasƒ± gerekir. Bu gelir ≈üartƒ±nƒ± kar≈üƒ±lamak i√ßin:

1i0xmn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamondsreview/comments/1i0xmn3/gia_triple_excellent_diamonds_expert_tips_for/,GIA Triple Excellent Diamonds: Expert Tips for Smart Buying,"**Bottom Line:**

GIA Triple Excellent diamonds represent the highest cut grade awarded by the Gemological Institute of America. Here are the key takeaways:

* These diamonds are graded Excellent in cut, polish, and symmetry, indicating top-tier craftsmanship.
* While highly sought after, they may not always offer the best light performance compared to more stringent grading systems like AGS.
* Expect to pay a premium for the Triple Excellent designation.
* Consider other factors like color, clarity, and carat weight alongside the cut grade.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing [from trusted retailers such as those](https://labdiamondsreview.com/diamonds/) that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

* Diamond buyers seeking assurance of high-quality craftsmanship
* Those who value GIA certification and are willing to pay for top grades
* Shoppers looking for a balance of prestige and performance in their diamond

# Who is this not for?

* Budget-conscious buyers who might find better value in lower grades
* Those prioritizing ultimate optical precision (may prefer AGS or Hearts and Arrows)
* Shoppers who aren't concerned with official grading designations

# Recommendations for Smart Buying

1. Look beyond the Triple Excellent grade:

* Examine the actual proportions and angles on the GIA report
* Request additional imagery like ASET and Idealscope if available

1. Compare prices:

* A Very Good cut with Excellent polish and symmetry might offer similar visual appeal at a lower cost

1. Consider other factors:

* Color, clarity, and carat weight significantly impact a diamond's appearance and value

1. Use trusted retailers:

* James Allen, Blue Nile, and Whiteflash offer extensive selections with detailed imagery

1. Don't overlook lower grades:

* Some Very Good cut diamonds can perform similarly to Excellent cuts at a better price point

1. Leverage expert help:

* Many retailers offer gemologist consultations to help you navigate your options

# FAQ

Q: Are all GIA Triple Excellent diamonds the same quality?A: No, there can be variations within the Excellent grade. Additional factors like proportions and optical symmetry can differentiate diamonds with the same grade.

Q: Do I need a Triple Excellent diamond for the best sparkle?A: Not necessarily. While it ensures high quality, other factors like proportions and optical symmetry also play crucial roles in a diamond's performance.

Q: How much more expensive are Triple Excellent diamonds?

A: They typically command a 10-20% premium over similar diamonds with lower cut grades, but this can vary based on other characteristics.

Q: Can I see the difference between a Triple Excellent and Very Good cut?A: Often, the difference is subtle to the naked eye. Proper lighting and side-by-side comparisons might be needed to discern variations.



Remember, while GIA Triple Excellent is a mark of quality, it's just one factor to consider in your diamond purchase. Take time to understand all aspects of the diamond to ensure you're getting the best value for your budget.

I completed college but I want to go back for a different path. My relationship with my family is not very good. And recently it‚Äôs coming to a head. My father and I got into a huge argument where he called me lazy and useless, among other things. 

When I attended undergrad I was to live at home and do the exact major my parents picked and that was the trade for them to pay. They also preferred I didn‚Äôt work during the year so my grades would not slip. My mom chose graphic design for the major I‚Äôd do. I have a degree in this path. I was never able to get a paid internship in the arts path. So I decided to apply to whatever would take me. My first ‚Äûjob,, was at a coffee shop. They worked with me, when in school I‚Äôd work 15 hours a week. My university course work was not exactly too overwhelming but my studio classes were several hours long and the commute was a lot. I say all this to tell everyone that I did not get the paid job until I was in my third year. I did unpaid internships for the first 2. 

My family started to act annoyed of me. I asked to use the vision insurance for glasses, the fight was bad. I ended up saving and buying the glasses but my family let my siblings get glasses (we have insurance for it). When my grandparents caught on they called my parents out and then my parents and I had bad fights. My parents said they never denied me care but I was stubborn and pretended.


I‚Äôll save the story but since then I live with my grandparents or my aunt and uncles. Because my grandma lets my parents stay at their place. My dad called my lazy and annoying, a bunch of words. He said I‚Äôm a waste of space because my current job is not at all related to my art degree. I work in the medical field. When I worked at the coffee shop he complained, and when I got this job he also said it‚Äôs not real work. I got mad and lashed out after he yelled at me. I can‚Äôt really keep going this way. He said I was lazy to not work during undergrad, when he set the rules this way. Now while I‚Äôm not in his house, he still always pops up. Or I‚Äôm told to keep the peace. How do I make a plan to leave? Everything is so expensive and I try so hard to save after bills but I fear I‚Äôll never be away from family. I fear I‚Äôll never get to do my dream career.

I recently underwent surgery and in preparation my surgeon had me undergo cancer gene screening through Invitae.  

I was positive for an APC gene mutation that increases your colon cancer risk. The genetic counselor advised my family members to get tested, and for me to start getting colonoscopies at age 40 and more frequently thereafter. I just turned 40 and have maxed out my OOP max on my insurance, so if I'm going to do it it needs to happen before my policy resets at the end of June.

But I'm terrified-and I don't know why, I've had numerous other surgeries, 2 so far this year, but the last time I was this scared I went 10 years without a Pap smear because I was terrified, and I lost an ovary as a result because it was too damaged to save from a huge tumor. My grandmother died of colon cancer and it was fast-I guess that plays a part in it, and I always have digestive problems, sometimes coffee ground looking stuff in my stool, along with mucus off and on.

Lemme tell you something straight‚Äî*that* ain‚Äôt jazz, that‚Äôs a goddamn Sunday stroll through a park where everybody‚Äôs too scared to break a sweat. You think Miles was out there shakin‚Äô up the world with this one? Nah, he was makin‚Äô money, playin' to a crowd of squares who think jazz is just some background noise for their overpriced dinners. They didn‚Äôt want no heat, no *real* jazz, they wanted something they could nod their heads to while they sipped on their overpriced cocktails. That‚Äôs *Kind of Blue*‚Äîjazz for the folks too scared to step off the curb and feel the streets under their feet.

Now listen, when I‚Äôm talkin‚Äô real jazz, I‚Äôm talkin‚Äô about sweat, tears, and blood on the floor. Back in my day, cats like Bird and Trane were playin‚Äô to make you feel like you‚Äôd just gotten sucker-punched in the gut. *That* was the sound of *life*, the sound of hustlin‚Äô and grindin‚Äô in the clubs of Harlem and 52nd Street. Miles? He wasn‚Äôt makin‚Äô real jazz on *Kind of Blue*, he was makin‚Äô jazz for the softies who don‚Äôt know what it means to be out there, fightin‚Äô for your damn sound. All this ‚Äúmodal‚Äù talk? That‚Äôs code for ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want no damn structure, I‚Äôm just gonna coast through this and make it sound deep.‚Äù Real cats don‚Äôt coast‚Äîthey *burn*.

Take *So What*. What‚Äôs that? A bassline that‚Äôs as lazy as a bum on 42nd Street beggin‚Äô for change? That‚Äôs the track you throw on when you wanna look cool but ain‚Äôt actually tryin‚Äô to get your hands dirty. You ever been to a jam session where the cats are sweatin' through their shirts, blowin' their brains out, not even thinkin' about what they‚Äôre playin', just lettin‚Äô it pour outta their soul? That‚Äôs jazz. *So What*? Man, that‚Äôs like a goddamn nap. If you wanna hear real tension, real heat, go listen to Coltrane screamin' on *Giant Steps*, where every note‚Äôs a goddamn battle, where you can feel his whole life on the line with every breath. *So What*? *So nothing*. That track ain't makin' you do nothin' but lean back in your chair and half-nod your head like you're too scared to stand up and dance.

And then there‚Äôs *Freddie Freeloader*. *Freddie* my ass. That track‚Äôs about as ‚Äúbluesy‚Äù as a wet fart in a Cadillac. It‚Äôs the blues for cats who don‚Äôt know what the hell the blues even is. You think the blues is about sittin' around with your fingers all soft, just tappin' away, lookin‚Äô like you‚Äôre in a jazz caf√© in Paris? Nah, man. The blues is about a motherf*cker who‚Äôs been chewin' on his life all day, feelin' the weight of the world on his shoulders, blowin‚Äô his horn like he‚Äôs gonna die tomorrow. *Freddie Freeloader*? It‚Äôs a goddamn snooze fest. No grit, no pain. It‚Äôs the blues for rich folks who just got off their yacht and don‚Äôt wanna get their hands dirty. It‚Äôs like a goddamn lullaby for people who never had to work for a damn thing in their lives.

And don‚Äôt even talk to me about *Blue in Green*. That track‚Äôs so soft it might as well be a goddamn pillow. You hear that and tell me it‚Äôs jazz, I‚Äôll tell you you‚Äôre full of shit. You ever been out in the street, hearin' the sounds of the city, the traffic, the hustle? That‚Äôs the real atmosphere. This crap? It‚Äôs like a *wannabe* atmosphere, like Miles was tryin‚Äô to be all *mysterious*, but really, it‚Äôs just a bunch of cats sittin' around thinkin‚Äô they‚Äôre *deep*. Real jazz don‚Äôt make you think‚Äîit makes you *feel* it in your gut. This is like a tepid cup of coffee. You sip it, and it just sits there, doin‚Äô nothin‚Äô. No spark, no fire, no blood, just some pale, fake-ass deepness. Miles wasn‚Äôt tryna make you feel nothin‚Äô, he was just tryna look cool for the squares in the back of the room.

Now, *Kind of Blue* might‚Äôve been some ‚Äúturning point‚Äù for jazz, whatever, but lemme tell you, it‚Äôs not *revolutionary*, it‚Äôs just a polished-up, watered-down version of the real thing. Back in the day, we didn‚Äôt care about any of that shit. We were out there in the clubs, where the air was thick with smoke, and the band was sweatin‚Äô their asses off to make sure every note *mattered*. We didn‚Äôt need to ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù with modes, we were too busy throwin‚Äô down and seein' who could burn the hottest. You think Miles was doin‚Äô something bold here? Nah. He was playin‚Äô to an audience that wanted to feel good, not to an audience that wanted to be moved, to be shocked, to have their soul *shaken*.

You wanna hear real jazz, kid? You go listen to Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers lay down *Moanin‚Äô*, where the sound of the drums will punch you in the gut. You listen to Coltrane on *A Love Supreme*, where you can feel the *struggle* in every goddamn note. Don‚Äôt come tell me *Kind of Blue* is some kinda masterpiece‚Äîit‚Äôs a record for the cats who want jazz without the grit. It‚Äôs a damn show, not a *movement*. If you‚Äôre lookin‚Äô for *real* jazz, get your head outta that padded chair and into the street. That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find the *heat*.",2,1736827131.0,jazzcirclejerk,6,0.75,False
1i0xgra,https://i.redd.it/rjcaro7luvce1.jpeg,Taiwan coffee bean pickups üáπüáº + brief thoughts on Taiwan pourover culture ,"From left to right:
- Join Coffee Roasters (Zhubei) ‚Äî two Ethiopians from Alo Coffee / Tamiru Tadesse. Not pictured is a very nice bag of Tamiru x Jake Hu washed I‚Äôm going through right now that‚Äôs fairly bright and sweet, but without too much florality. These bags were shockingly cheap compared to what I‚Äôve seen Tamiru beans going for elsewhere ‚Äî two were $10 / 150g, and one was labeled ‚ÄúSidama COE‚Äù and was $19 / 150g (not a lot of other information). Overall, Join was one of my favorite roasters I discovered this trip. Their roast profile is light and consistent (anything Nordic or lighter is quite uncommon in Taiwan). They also brewed with a Paragon, which was neat. 
- VWI by Chad Wang (Taipei) ‚Äî washed geisha grown in Chiayi by ÈÑíÁØâÂúí Zou Zhou Yuan farm, whose natural geisha won third in Taiwan‚Äôs 2024 COE. ~$50 / 225g. The barista very kindly brewed a cup for me as well. The aroma and sweetness were a bit muted, which I attributed to the beans being 3 days off roast. There was also an interesting earthy fruitiness coupled with a somewhat thick mouthfeel that I haven‚Äôt experienced from other origins. 
- Simple Kaffa (Taipei) ‚Äî washed SL34 grown in Yunlin by Êù±Ê≥ìÂíñÂï°ËéäÂúí Donghong Coffee Farm whose natural SL34 won 7th in COE 2024. ~$30 / 100g. I somewhat regret getting these beans and don‚Äôt have super high hopes for them. I also got a cup of this as pourover and it was roasty and fairly underwhelming. Simple Kaffa was very polished aesthetically, but felt like the worst value proposition out of all the cafes and roasters I visited.
- Piccolo Angolo (Taipei) ‚Äî washed geisha grown in Chiayi by Royal Bean Geisha Estate, whose natural geisha won fourth in COE 2024. These beans were not from that lot, but actually cupped higher than the winning lot. $100 / 100g, which is easily the most I‚Äôve ever paid for beans (and likely the most I‚Äôll ever pay for the foreseeable future). Piccolo Angolo was easily my favorite cafe in Taiwan by far. The owners are extreme coffee nerds, and have incredibly strong connections with seemingly every Taiwanese coffee grower. I also got a cup as pourover. Extremely clean, with a very high honey-like sweetness, which contrasts with the white sugar sweetness I find more common in other geisha. Very floral and lemon tea-like when hot (very similar to Janson), with more stone fruit and honey when cool. The profile of the sweetness was the most unique aspect to me: the cup seemed to get sweeter and sweeter as it cooled, and was almost syrupy by the time it was cold. I also really appreciated the owner taking the time to chat with me ‚Äî I learned a lot about Taiwan‚Äôs coffee farms, industry, and culture.

I plan to do a longer post about Taiwan coffee at some point, but some other initial thoughts:
- It seems like the majority of cafes also roast their own beans. Giesen seems to be the most popular roaster by far. Also, it seems like every freaking cafe, including holes in the wall, have EK43s.
- Taiwanese baristas prefer coarser grinds and fewer pours. They also most commonly do a center pour involving up-down movement. I asked several baristas about this and they generally just said that that‚Äôs how they learned. 
- V60 was the most common brewer by a large margin, followed by the CT62 interestingly enough. Several shops used what appeared to be custom-made brewers. A lot of more Western style shops had Oreas on display, but several baristas admitted that they never used them. I very rarely saw Kalita, Origami, Chemex. 
- There are generally four styles of cafe: 1) modern Western (lots of concrete / white surfaces, Fellow equipment, lighter roasts, more heavily processed beans); 2) Japanese kissaten influenced (lots of wood, darker roasts, stovetop kettles, vintage hi-fi equipment etc.); 3) what looks like someone‚Äôs converted living room, often sharing space with some other merchant selling random things like jewelry or ceramics or somethjng (yet they all still have Mahlkonigs, sometimes multiple lol); 4) more traditional third-wave shops like Cama, usually with uninteresting bean selections and (IMO) somewhat offensive interior design sensibilities.
- Price-wise, most standard pourovers were in the $5-6 range. More unique beans (eg a Sidra or Wush Wush) might be $8-12. Geisha from renowned farms like Janson, la Esmeralda, etc. were surprisingly cheap, generally being $10-15 a cup. COE beans were generally around $20-25 a cup. Simple Kaffa was about 25% more expensive than any other shop for comparable beans and (IMO) less skill / care. ",2,1736827072.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Patch notes:  
  
**NEW SURVIVORS:** Jocelyn Duchess, Harper Eckland, Penny Wells, Quinn Power, Saki Shirogane, Emi Shirogane, Allegra Sauvagass, Peter Donovan  
  
**NEW VICTIMS** ***(NOT SAVABLE)***: Amanda Moore, Lucy MacKinnon, Trina Justice   
  
**NEW MARKED SCOOPS:** Safe Travels, Lost in Translation, Decisions Decisions   
  
**NEW UNMARKED SCOOPS:** A Balanced Breakfast, In For A Penny, Bathroom Break   
  
**CHANGED SCOOP**: One Man's Trash   
  
**NEW ITEM REWARDS:** Marvin's Metal Velvet Stand, Bruno's Quick Wrench   
  
**WYATT DID US A FAVOR**: The coffee maker in the Safe House now dispenses infinite coffee. I changed some health items around in the Safe House to allow you to make more than Quick Steps and Randomizers.   
  
**NEW DRIP FOR FRANK:** Sheriff Outfit (Courtesy of Mel), Casual Phenotrans Outfit (Courtesy of Solidcal)   
  
**IN THE CLOSET?:** The outfits are spread around the entire bathroom to make it easier to select your outfit. Also organized the special outfits in Storage Room 1.   
  
**EXTRA, EXTRA:** All magazine spawns have been moved. Leadership isn't as free anymore...   
  
**LEAVE THE STRIPPING FOR THE SILVER STRIP:** Ante Up has been removed. There was no real time to do it, the code space was used for another survivor Peter Donovan, most don't like the poker minigame, and the helmet is available in Storage Room 1. I didn't see much reason to have it over another survivor, which I assume most of you would rather in a mod like this.   
  
**FANTASTIC:** Some photo ops are now worth significantly more PP than they were before. (I upped as many as I could find the code for).   
  
**I SLEPT IN:** The scoop ""What Dreams Are Made Of"" has been moved to 12:00 PM Day 3 and now only lasts for 3 hours to hopefully give more time for Run For The Money and to help with the survivor limit a bit.   
  
**AW, MAN:** All survivors now give significantly **less** PP when located and saved. You should hit still be between level \~43-50 by the end of the game if you save everyone. *I expect the photo op increase to help with this.* Almost every survivor gives 2500 on recruit and 5000 on save. Some exceptions I can think of are Snowflake and the 6teen crew.   
  
**GOOD GUY SULLY:** Sorry guys. No ***Sullivan*** boss fight coming. He's a good guy!   
  
**LAST DAY MAYHEM:** Day 4 had a lot of mission times reduced to help with Survivor limits. The gas zombie section should be a little more doable without worrying about pre-gas zombie survivors being in queue.   
  
**RETURN OF THE GURU:** Stacey's boss fight theme was changed, Evan's boss fight theme was changed, and so was something else... **232?:** Who could Notebook entry #232 be...? Surely it's not *something I added way back in patch 1.8.0.0 and nobody has found it yet.* No hints this time.   
  
**BUG FIXES, SMALL CHANGES, ETC:** Some small changes have been made here and there, and some general bug fixes. For example, in the sniper cutscene, they now properly shoot one of ""those guys in the colored suits"" Stacey mentions. I noticed a lot of dialogue name errors and am doing my best to get it fixed, but if you notice any, please let me know!   
  
**NO MORE GETTING OTR'D:** I changed the way the missions are displayed in the HUD code wise and they should show regardless of whether you get Stacey's call or not. Not fully playtested so I'm not sure if this will do anything or not, but it was worth a try. If it does nothing it'll probably be an unnoticeable change from the player's perspective.",4,1736826890.0,deadrising,2,1.0,False

Introduction
------------

Kindness is a divine attribute that we all have the power to harness and share with the world. It is a small act that fosters connections, heals hearts, and spreads joy wherever it goes. You may underestimate the impact of a single kind gesture, but it can ripple out far beyond what you can envision. In today‚Äôs world, where chaos often sidelines compassion, choosing kindness is a bold act of love and grace.

As you embark on this spiritual journey to explore the power of kindness, remember that each act of kindness, no matter how small, is a seed planted in the garden of humanity. These seeds can grow into mighty trees of love and acceptance. Let us delve deeper into what scripture says about kindness, and how we can apply it practically in our daily lives.

Bible Verse
-----------

Ephesians 4:32 (NIV) ‚Äì ‚ÄúBe kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.‚Äù

Meaning
-------

In Ephesians 4:32, Paul invites us to embody kindness and compassion, recognizing these qualities as reflections of God‚Äôs forgiveness and love toward us. This verse is a poignant reminder of how transformative kindness can be, not only in our lives but also in the lives of others. It challenges us to see kindness as an integral part of our spiritual journey, mirroring the forgiveness we have graciously received from God through Christ.

Kindness is not just about grand gestures; it‚Äôs often expressed in simple acts‚Äîa smile, a helping hand, a listening ear. It is an outward reflection of our inner grace, derived from understanding the depth of God‚Äôs love for us. When we choose to show kindness, we make an intentional decision to step into a realm of love that changes atmospheres, softens hearts, and makes space for authentic connections.

Additionally, kindness is intertwined with forgiveness. Just as God has forgiven us, we are called to forgive others, allowing kindness to flow through that act of releasing bitterness and grudges. This forgiveness becomes a catalyst for healing and restoration, both for yourself and for those around you.

Actions to Take
---------------

‚Äì Smile at a stranger today and offer a simple compliment.

‚Äì Call or text a friend you haven‚Äôt spoken to in a while and let them know you‚Äôre thinking of them.

‚Äì Perform a random act of kindness, such as paying for someone‚Äôs coffee or leaving a positive note for someone to find.

‚Äì Reflect on someone you need to forgive and pray for the strength to extend love and release any resentment.

‚Äì Set an intention each morning to perform at least one act of kindness, no matter how small.

Journal Prompts
---------------

‚Äì Reflect on a time someone showed you unexpected kindness. How did it make you feel?

‚Äì What are some ways you can show kindness to yourself this week?

‚Äì Write about a person whom you find challenging to be kind to. How might practicing kindness change your relationship with them?

‚Äì How do you feel God‚Äôs kindness and compassion in your life daily?

‚Äì List three small acts of kindness you can incorporate into your daily routine.

Prayer
------

Dear Lord, thank You for the precious gift of kindness that flows from Your heart into mine. Help me to reflect Your loving nature by responding with kindness and compassion in all situations. Teach me to forgive and love others as You have forgiven and loved me. May my actions today be a mirror of Your grace, spreading seeds of kindness wherever I go. In Jesus‚Äô name, Amen.

Social Posts
------------

‚Äì ‚ÄúA little kindness goes a long way. Tag someone who‚Äôs made your day brighter. #KindnessMatters‚Äù

Conclusion
----------

Kindness is a timeless and transformative power you can wield every day. It not only brings joy and healing to others but also enriches your own soul. By embedding kindness into your daily walk with God, you can make this world a better place, one act at a time.

As you continue your journey in faith, remember that small acts of kindness can reflect the boundless love of God. We invite you to explore more studies and let God inspire you in ways you never imagined at BGodInspired.com.

Q&amp;A about Kindness
----------------------

Sure! Here‚Äôs a Q&amp;A session focused on the theme of kindness:

**Q1: What is kindness?**

**A1:** Kindness is the quality of being friendly, generous, and considerate towards others. It involves showing compassion and empathy, often through actions that support or uplift another person without expecting anything in return.

**Q2: Why is kindness important in our daily lives?**

**A2:** Kindness can create a positive atmosphere and strengthen relationships. It promotes emotional well-being, reduces stress, and encourages a sense of community. Small acts of kindness can have a ripple effect, inspiring others to spread kindness further.

**Q3: Can you give examples of simple acts of kindness?**

**A3:** Certainly! Simple acts of kindness include holding the door open for someone, giving a genuine compliment, offering to help a colleague with a task, smiling at someone, or listening attentively when someone speaks.

**Q4: How does kindness benefit the person who acts kindly?**

**A4:** People who practice kindness often experience a sense of fulfillment and happiness. Engaging in kind acts can boost one‚Äôs mood, improve mental health, and even lead to longer-lasting relationships. This is sometimes referred to as the ‚Äúhelper‚Äôs high.‚Äù

**Q5: How can we encourage kindness in children?**

**A5:** Encouraging kindness in children can be done by modeling kind behavior ourselves, praising them when they act kindly, discussing stories and examples of kindness, engaging them in activities that require cooperation, and teaching them to empathize with others.

**Q6: What are some barriers to kindness, and how can we overcome them?**

**A6:** Barriers to kindness can include stress, fear of judgment, cultural differences, or being in a hurry. To overcome these, we can practice mindfulness, remind ourselves of the benefits of kindness, seek to understand others‚Äô perspectives, and make a conscious effort to prioritize kindness.

**Q7: Is there a connection between kindness and mental health?**

**A7:** Yes, numerous studies have shown a positive connection between kindness and mental health. Acts of kindness can increase feelings of happiness, reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, and foster a sense of belonging and purpose. Being kind to oneself, known as self-compassion, is also linked to better mental health.

**Q8: How can workplaces foster a culture of kindness?**

**A8:** Workplaces can foster a culture of kindness by promoting open communication, encouraging teamwork, recognizing and rewarding kind behavior, offering team-building activities, and providing training on empathy and stress management.

**A9:** Kindness plays a crucial role in conflict resolution by promoting understanding and cooperation. Approaching conflicts with empathy and a willingness to see from the other person‚Äôs perspective can de-escalate tensions and lead to more harmonious and productive outcomes.

**Q10: Can kindness make a difference on a global scale?**

**A10:** Absolutely. Collective acts of kindness can influence societal change by addressing issues such as poverty, inequality, and environmental concerns. When people come together with a focus on kindness and collaboration, they can drive initiatives that promote peace, sustainability, and improved quality of life for communities around the world.

To my surprise, after about a week of drinking around 2 cups a day consistently, I started burping with little effort! I burped like 6 times today. Nothing crazy but I used to feel trapped air in my chest, which would make croaking noises, but now I can burp easily as long as I drink the tea.

I asked Meta AI why chamomile had this effect, and here‚Äôs what it said:

* **Relaxing Muscles**: Chamomile helps relax smooth muscles in the digestive system, easing tension and allowing gas to be released.
* **Digestive Aid**: Chamomile has carminative properties that help reduce bloating and promote the release of trapped air.
* **Reducing Inflammation**: Its anti-inflammatory effects can ease irritation in the digestive system, helping normal functions like burping to resume.

1i0x806,https://www.reddit.com/r/bandmembers/comments/1i0x806/struggling_with_feeling_overwhelmed_and_anxious/,Struggling with feeling overwhelmed and anxious playing in a band while balancing life,"Hello, so I have been putting off writing this post for quite some time and I am really in need of some advice. I currently play in a band that is doing quite well, I love our music, we all put in good work, and are starting to get noticed in the local scene, where we are getting asked regularly to play at paying clubs, bars, and venues. This is wonderful. But at the same time, this is what has been giving me tremendous anxiety. When I started the band, I was admittedly very vague. I consider music to be a part of who I am, more than just a hobby, but at the same time I am trying to balance other priorities in my life, like getting my PhD. I was communicated when I started the band that this was going to be for fun, to write music, play local shows, and ‚Äúsee where it goes‚Äù. I recognize that last part was left vague, but that and that has been the problem. Where I think about everything holding our band back, I would say I am the biggest obstacle.

This has been severely impacting my mental health. I have tried to keep balance with this, trying to play a show a month and practice once a week. With my current work schedule this is all I can handle, but the pace of the band keeps going faster. This is all on top of me having tremendous social anxiety and anxiety in general. I get overwhelmed super easily and just panic when things get ‚Äúserios‚Äù. When I feel I finally get a chance to breathe from the band, I check my phone to see 20+ band texts and start going into anxiety mode. Before I have barely had a chance to process my morning coffee, we already have new songs to work on and several shows lined up that month, and I am already on the hook to find bands to fill the shows. I am finding it increasingly hard to live my life around these random schedules, and the scheduling conflicts are giving me serious anxiety. So many life plans have been interrupted because we are playing a show. I feel I am needing to plan things out well in advance because a show could be planned which totally ruins summer travel plans (you get a 10 day work vacation in July, but a show is scheduled in the middle, making travel undoable). It is difficult to communicate because I feel like I am always the bad guy, who is saying I don‚Äôt want to play the show, but I always end up agreeing because I don‚Äôt want to ruin it for everyone.

Admittedly, if I am being totally honest, this band is not my everything in life, like it appears to be for one of our members. When I am trying to focus on work, or spend time with friends and family, he is busy reaching out to venues, making connections with other bands, writing news songs, sending our demo out to radio stations, and so on. And good on him, and I commend him for that and appreciate him for the effort and dedication. But it has been increasingly been making me very uncomfortable. An uncomfortable reality of this project is how far we want to take this. I am not willing to drop my job and graduate school to give everything to the band. He has communicated he wants to take this as far as we can, playing major venues at all. The thought of that honestly terrifies me. One time when I was in class he sends us all a message saying he was about to book us on a world tour with another band and if we could drop our plans to make this work. I nearly had a panic attack.

There is a lot of guilt I feel in the band, because I am not actively contributing to our band as much as this other member. This is starting to negatively impact my mental health, to the point where I dread thinking about the band, and feel my anxiety rush every time I check my phone, hoping it is not another string of messages asking if I can play another gig this weekend. I really can only handle a gig a month, that is all I want to do, and I just cannot keep up with this pace anymore. But then part of me is like, isn‚Äôt this what you wanted? I wanted to start this band because I wanted to play in a band, write original songs, and play local shows. I always wanted to be a musician, and now that I finally am getting to have this experience, I feel like a total hypocritical jerk. I am by no means trying to make this sound like I am the victim here, I would say my attitude here could be seen as just as problematic, because I am not putting in enough effort. I am the downer, I am the one who waters down plans to play shows, and I am the one gets quiet when we talk about future plans. I guess I just don‚Äôt know what I want with this band at this point. I love our music, I love playing with these guys, but I just cannot keep up with the pace this one member wants us to go at. I feel like I am responsible for him fulfilling his dream when I really shouldn‚Äôt be. I am just wondering if anyone can relate to this here. I wonder what is wrong with me. I like playing local shows, but at the same time I hate being put on the spot, and the idea of playing a major gig terrifies me, and I can‚Äôt figure out why. Like who do I tell? Do I tell my friends? My co-workers? Do I keep it a secret from my peers? The idea of people coming out to just watch me weirds me out, and I am trying to figure out how to get past this. Like playing a major venue, and just continuing on with my daily routine, not telling anybody? It just feels so alienating to me.

I am really just not sure how to continue with this anymore, and while I might be describing a toxic band environment, I am totally aware I might sound just as toxic, and even entitled at the same time. I feel terrible for how little invested I am in the band compared to this other guy, it is like his whole life. I enjoy playing, but man do I want my space. I do not want to be texting with my band everyday. I recognize how unreasonable I must sound right now, and realize many might be thinking this guy needs to grow up, and I get that.

Can anyone else here relate to this or might have any advice for me? I would very much appreciate it as this is my first time playing in an actual gigging band! Thank you very much and I am sorry about the long need to vent here! I am just hoping for some fresh perspective on all of this   : )

EDIT: I thought I finally had an evening of peace and quiet, no more band texts, and just now got like almost 20 texts about us applying to play a major venue next month with a touring band. My anxiety is skyrocketing and I feel sick. I don‚Äôt know what is wrong with me, but I can‚Äôt shake this feeling of being overwhelmed...",1,1736826295.0,bandmembers,2,1.0,False

But I just had a massive trauma flashback that was caused by a text from my brother. I am so angry with him, it's ruined my whole day. I don't want this to trigger anyone. But I wanted to get it off my chest to people who understand and could provide some kind helpful words. In a few words ""remember when mom used to.."" he just brought it all back to the forefront:

So my mother used to be a raging alcoholic, for the entire time I lived in her home and then some. At least twice a week (sometimes 4 times) she would binge drink an entire jug of wine (not a bottle - a jug).

I'd know she'd started drinking for the night when I'd be walking up the driveway from school. I'd hear Beatles/Doors/Frank Sinatara absolutely BLASTING from the inside of the house. I'd hang my head with disappointment and sadness and try to prepare myself. Opening the door my nose would sting with cigarette smoke, she only smoked when she drank, cigarettes were always the indicator. I'd enter and there she'd be sitting cross legged at the kitchen table, holding the cigarette, with a loopy smile and ""possessed exorcist"" eyes. Occasionally she'd get up and stumble around like a toddler who just learned how to walk. She'd try to give us 'too-intense' hugs, she'd dance, and slur/shout her classic ""get me a cigawette pleaaase"". She'd plop back down heavy and immovable on the chair, cross legged, glazed eyes staring into space, just smoking and taking swigs of wine. My Dad would get us McDonald's and let us rent a video game to

A couple hours of this and she'd be fully inebriated, or fully 'possessed'. She'd pass out for a bit, then come back roaring for more. She'd stomp around in the living room 'dancing', try to do a high-kick and fall HARD on the floor like someone dropped a bowling ball. She'd trip and fall, one time flying head first into the metal water dispenser, smashing her face up, my father turning her body over to reveal an open bloodied mouth.

A couple hours even later, the house stinking of ash and red wine, after another pass out she'd be back for more. A this point she usually would show up with no clothes on. Sometimes underwear on, often times nothing. And she'd flop onto the family sofa in the living room like a grotesque rag doll. Sometimes we accidentally brought friends home at this hour - they didn't want to come back over. She'd ultimately piss all over the couch. We never sat on the couch, we sat on the floor and watched tv to try to ignore it.

Only one time she actually puked. Me and my brother watched her stumble to the toilet, and the next thing we see is her body plopped down on the gross floor, face to chest covered in red-brown liquid. I thought it was cat shit, as the litter box was right next to her, and I thought she fell in it. I realized later it was wine vomit.

Then around 10pm it was bed time for everyone and lights out. A couple hours into sleeping I'd hear loud stumbling around and stomping right in my room. She would be hollering and singing songs and trying to put the stereo back on. She'd get right up in my face, in the dark, and slur/whisper ""HIIII"" in the most demonic fucked up possessed way. My dad would try to get her back to bed but it was futile. Eventually she'd crash, and we'd all finally sleep.

In the morning we'd wake and she'd already be gone, off for a coffee drive. I'd go downstairs and make cereal, and try to ignore the empty jug of wine on the counter, the wine glasses, the cigarette ash EVERYWHERE, the piss soaked couch, and just the stench of all the above.

Then I'd go out to the stop at the end of the driveway and wait for the bus to bring me to school.

There would usually be a day in-between sessions, but sometimes I'd come home after school and hear the music again, and smell the smoke.

I'm nearly 40 and I'm still fucked up for life because of her. I was a just little girl.  These disgusting images are in my mind forever.  I wish I could physically rip them out with my fingers",1,1736826228.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

*tl;dr*¬†\- I feel like I come second to my boyfriend's vaping habit in our relationship, and subtlety isn't working. How do I effectively communicate this grievance of mine?

I've been dating my boyfriend for just over 2 years. We live independently and usually visit each other on weekends. The time is approaching to discuss big relationship milestones such as living together and finances. But one thing that is concerning me is that he vapes....a lot.

I don't usually care what people do behind closed doors, as long as they're not hurting others. But this habit has been something that bothers me lately. For background, the majority of my family used to be smokers, but everyone stopped when we had a death in the family that was directly linked to smoking. So whenever we go over to visit my family for lunch or events, he'll have to 'duck away' to get a hit or will chew nicotine gum if he's stuck.I often get remarks from my immediate family about it and just have to pacify them about it.

What bothers me more than my family comments though, and what more likely explains the title, is how I feel I compare as a priority. Vaping will be the first thing he does when he wakes up, before anything else. He'll have it with his morning coffee and as he's chilling during the day. We'll pause movies or TV shows (if at my place) so he can do it, or he'll just blow big puffs of smoke inside when at his place. We've been on some mini holidays together, and we have to find a smoking area at an airport (not easy nowadays) or leave where we currently are so that he can puff(like a cafe or restaurant).

I've brought it up subtly before, but I'm usually met with resistance. This is usually in the form of retorts like ""Well I'll just give up alcohol and coffee as well."" I find this argument frustrating because it's not like he's grabbing a beer off his bedside table first thing in the morning, or having to leave the table at a family gathering to go take shots.

I'm just starting to think long term and can't imagine having to cater a holiday overseas around finding places to vape, or always feeling like I come second to it. Plus there are the unknown health implications, and it hurts me to think I would lose him earlier than expected due to silly habits.

So, how can I bring this up to him in a productive way without sounding selfish or controlling? I don't know if this is actually important or if I am being an autistic moron, making mountains out of ant hills.",3,1736826148.0,relationship_advice,11,0.8,False

I was working with three minors today, when I notice a 30-40 year old man is talking with one of the kiddos for a little too long. Getting all up in the window, making her clearly uncomfortable. She leaves and walks to the back, then comes to me out of his view and tells me what he had said to her.

He said ""You are so pretty"" blah blah blah, and she says ""Thanks, but I'm a minor"". He continues his advances and gets closer and says ""Well when do you turn 18?"". She was super uncomfortable with this and wanted to get the point across that she was underage and said ""not for a very long time"". He continues prodding at her, asking ""well what month?"", ""why won't you just tell me when?"", and then asks for her shoe size?? He said ""well tell me your shoe size so I can bring you a gift"" and is being super creepy and uncomfortable about it. She charges him out and walks away uncomfortably.

Going into protective mode over these kids, I walk over and tell him respectfully but sternly, ""I'm gonna have to ask you to stop talking to minors in a way that's making them uncomfortable. It's inappropriate because she's a KID"".  With a smirk and a cold look in his eyes, he says, ""Let me ask you this: What part of what I said was unlawful? Huh? Can you tell me what part of what I said is against the law?"". 

I started getting more stern and told him that I never said what he said was against the law, but that she clearly stated that she was a minor yet you kept poking and prodding at her, asking her for personal information and yet you continue your advances on a CHILD. He goes ""You know what country we're in? America. And I can say whatever I want because I'm not breaking the law"".

Buddy. I never said you were breaking the law. I told you to stop making unwanted advances on a fucking child or else you can leave.

I told him that he's on private property and I can call the cops and get him trespassed immediately if he wants to continue. Then he started arguing that ""No, this isn't private property. Where I'm standing is PUBLIC and I can do whatever I want"".  I told him he obviously doesn't know the law if he thinks this is public property, because I have the right to remove you from this business for any reason.

He goes back and forth with me about ""knowing the law better than me"" and that he can say whatever he wants to her and it doesn't matter that she's a minor.  I defend the fuck out of these kids and the asshole still won't back down.

The hill he wants to die on is that he believes can make inappropriate advances on a minor and that there is nothing I can do about it because I can't call the cops to get him to leave ""public property"" (again, he is on private property according to our state's laws).

He asks for my name and give him a fake ass name, and asks for the manager.

Boy, you're talking to the manager-on-duty right now.


I feel so bad for the young girl that has had to deal with this on more than one occasion.

My Dad would get us McDonald's and let us rent a video game to

A couple hours of this and she'd be fully inebriated, or fully 'possessed'.  She'd pass out for a bit, then come back roaring for more.  She'd stomp around in the living room 'dancing', try to do a high-kick and fall HARD on the floor like someone dropped a bowling ball.  She'd trip and fall, one time flying head first into the metal water dispenser, smashing her face up, my father turning her body over to reveal an open bloodied mouth.

A couple hours even later, the house stinking of ash and red wine, after another pass out she'd be back for more.  A this point she usually would show up with no clothes on.  Sometimes underwear on, often times nothing.  And she'd flop onto the family sofa in the living room like a grotesque rag doll.  Sometimes we accidentally brought friends home at this hour - they didn't want to come back over.  She'd ultimately piss all over the couch.  We never sat on the couch, we sat on the floor and watched tv to try to ignore it.

Only one time she actually puked.  Me and my brother watched her stumble to the toilet, and the next thing we see is her body plopped down on the gross floor, face to chest covered in red-brown liquid.  I thought it was cat shit, as the litter box was right next to her, and I thought she fell in it.  I realized later it was wine vomit.

Then around 10pm it was bed time for everyone and lights out.  A couple hours into sleeping I'd hear loud stumbling around and stomping right in my room.  She would be hollering and singing songs and trying to put the stereo back on.  She'd get right up in my face, in the dark, and slur/whisper ""HIIII"" in the most demonic fucked up possessed way.  My dad would try to get her back to bed but it was futile.  Eventually she'd crash, and we'd all finally sleep.

In the morning we'd wake and she'd already be gone, off for a coffee drive.  I'd go downstairs and make cereal, and try to ignore the empty jug of wine on the counter, the wine glasses, the cigarette ash EVERYWHERE, the piss soaked couch, and just the stench of all the above.

Then I'd go out to the stop at the end of the driveway and wait for the bus to bring me to school.

There would usually be a day in-between sessions, but sometimes I'd come home after school and hear the music again, and smell the smoke.

I'm nearly 40 and I'm still fucked up for life because of her.  I was a just little girl.",8,1736825620.0,AdultChildren,3,1.0,False

Today was my birthday. I think a lot of you are unfortunately all too familiar with what that entails. I tried to pretend it was a normal day. We both took today off so I had some expectations. I was up very early with a sick child who stayed home. I tried to take charge of caring for myself, I went and got coffee but I freaking dropped it. It was hard enough to do that for myself, I couldn't be bothered to replace it. He slept in, vaped, scrolled Instagram, eventually did laundry, maybe to continue to avoid me. All because we fought last night when I made a nasty face at him while pointing out how much he'd been on his phone.

I didn't get any gifts, no loving words, no cake, no special dinner, my children didn't have anyone to help them make or buy anything. They felt bad.
We went out of town yesterday after I made arrangements for our dogs. I made the plans. We ended up fighting because I dared to say he was on his phone too much.

i have a huge soft spot for animals, especially the furry ones (although the scaled one are cuties too!). my family only really adopts senior dogs so older babies are my favorite! they are just here to hang out and sleep; the dream!

an unfortunate fact about me is that i grew up drinking my ma‚Äôs cold coffee so i have a HUGE love for it, although i am by no means a connoisseur. i just like a good cup of sweet and creamy brew.

We just moved here several months ago and I really the place a lot. Where I previously lived was hot and humid. Well, it's still hot here sometimes. I'm in a tropical country after all. But its high elevation and close proximity to the mountain makes it cooler and there's a lot of misty rain and I love misty rain.

This picture above is in our backyard. In the morning I'd sit there with a cup of coffee and a book and I would see farmers working on the rice field. I work remotely at home so this is where I sometimes work as well, but I can't be there long because we haven't installed an electrical plug.

However, this is a village and it takes around 30-45 minutes to drive to the city. So while I enjoy all this privileges that nature can offer, sometimes it takes a lot of time to do run errands and finish some business works. But it's peaceful here. So it's a good trade-off.

There are several mountains that are just two or three hour drive away. I want to hike them again. The last time I hiked was seven years ago, I think. That's the thing about growing up. Life took over and you don't realize years have passed but then you're too busy to do the thing you have always wanted to do.

But even if I want to, I would have to wait until the dry season comes. Well you can hike them now but the track would be wet and the soil soften with mud, and then there's a risk of thunderstorm and you could be hit by a lightning. The sunrise are often amazing after a long rainy night and you'll see a sea of cloud from above and it's so beautiful. I did it once, but with all the challenges I swore to myself to never do it again and will always hike during the summer.

Apart from all, in this streak I will try to write without the help of Grammarly to correct my mistakes. I'll try to correct them on my own and see how far I can do and what mistakes that I make and what I can improve.

\**to the correctors, thank you in advance for your help and time spent trying to correct our mistakes. If you don't mind, could you please also point out where the phrases sounded weird according to the native? Thank you very much!*",1,1736824807.0,WriteStreakEN,1,1.0,False

Long-time listener, first-time caller. I uhh, I have a complicated and painful relationship with my mom. Who doesn't, right? My father died when I was 11 and she totally broke down. She spiraled into alcoholism and drug abuse, left me for weeks at a time, gave up on the whole parenting thing and tried to redefine our relationship as something new. She just wanted to be my friend. When I was 17 she started smoking weed with me, and things may have escalated from there if I didn't stick with California sobriety after a few bad experiences with opioids.

All that to say, shit's fucked yo. I raised myself. I moved out at 18. I moved *back in* at 25 when my mother became severely ill with stage 4 kidney failure and a host of chronic pain syndromes that truly do disable her. Her disability check covers about 40% of our bills. I'm 28 now and I'm the head of household and her caretaker in many ways. My love for her blinded me into accepting obligations I'm too young for, that are generationally unfair, and that have bred deep resentment in me.

I had a bad day today. Why doesn't really matter. What matters is my mom would not leave me alone. I didn't want to talk to her about it because I knew if left to my own devices I could process things and move on easily. She picked at it though. Followed me around. Knocked on my door. Came outside to where I was peacefully having a coffee and listening to the rain to babble every incoherent thought that popped into her head.

I was agitated and I counted the time I was able to hear myself think between quips. 2 seconds. 5 seconds. 4 seconds. 3, 5, 3, 7, 2, 5... I snapped and I did something that feels like emotional abuse, but that I've wanted to say ever since I was a teen. Lady, we are not friends.

I just welcomed our AP about a week ago and she is already homesick. I am finding her English is much worse than anticipated and does not tell me when she does not understand, it also seems like her interests are not the same as the ones she listed from the profile. 

She also spent the entire 1st weekend in her room and only came out like 2 times for some food for about 15min each. We got her a phone plan, I made sure her room was packed with snacks and toiletries, I‚Äôve taken her shopping and bought her a warm winter jacket, we cook every meal, I am trying so hard to make everything comfortable for her. But she is not asking me any questions, she said she can load a dishwasher, come to find out she never has had one, when i ask her any questions she just replies ‚Äúyes, thank you‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs good‚Äù. I am struggling so hard. She will also not cook in our kitchen, we‚Äôve asked if there is something we can cook together for her to get comfortable and she has been putting it off, saying maybe next week and I want to see you do it so I know what the kids like. Also I feel like she is doing the minimum of what i ask, for example I asked her to clean up the kitchen after lunch and my older child was doing a messy activity and she loaded the dishwasher, did not wipe down any of the counters, left overs were still out 2hours after lunch, dishes from breakfast were still around the counters, milk container still out on the counter from putting our younger son to his nap, the floor was a mess, and my youngest had a poop in his diaper when I checked him. She looked at me and was like ‚Äúwant me to change him?‚Äù Ummmm yes how would you feel sitting in your own poop? After she changed him his diaper was on backwards (this happened once before and I explained that there is the word ‚Äúback‚Äù on the diaper for him which way it should face) so I explained again how the diaper is supposed to go on. It is stressing me out because I don‚Äôt totally feel comfortable leaving my children alone with her. Especially with her English not being communicative, i wonder if she can understand my kids and if something were to happen to the kids could she tell me what happened? I don‚Äôt know how much she is understanding and she‚Äôs not asking me anything. 

I am trying to be super patient, my husband has taken her shopping as well and to get coffee and talk and we‚Äôve both talked to her extensively on what we need and how important communication is and she says she understands but then idk, I can tell she wants to try but my effort to train her is really wearing on me. 

For additional context, I work from home so I am around for questions or help if needed. She is 26 so I thought there would be a better maturity level with someone older. And our kids are 2 and 5. I am expecting my 3rd in April, this is what I am most nervous about. If I can‚Äôt communicate with her now and asking my kids instead what happened, how‚Äôs it gonna go with a baby? 

We also had our coordinator come visit today and she had no questions for her and after the coordinator left, she told me we spoke too fast and didn‚Äôt understand what we were saying. 

Is this all normal hardships in the beginning? When does it start getting easier?

1i0wdt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PaidOnlineJobs/comments/1i0wdt1/home_rugs_kitchen/,Home Rugs Kitchen,"Choosing the Right Home Rugs for Your Kitchen: Style, Material, and Functionality
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Choosing the right home rugs for your kitchen can enhance both the aesthetics and functionality of the space. With so many options available, it might feel overwhelming. But by focusing on style, material, and functionality, you can narrow down your choices effectively.

### Consider Your Style

The kitchen is often considered the heart of the home. It's a space for gathering and cooking, so the rugs you choose should reflect your personal style and the overall theme of your kitchen.

- **Traditional:** Look for ornate designs and rich colors. Area rugs with floral patterns or classic motifs can achieve a timeless feel.
- **Modern:** Opt for minimalist designs with geometric shapes or bold colors. Solid-color rugs can also add a chic touch without overwhelming your space.
- **Rustic/Farmhouse:** Natural fibers like jute or sisal work well here. Look for earthy tones and textured surfaces to keep things cozy.
- **Eclectic:** Mix and match patterns and colors for a fun and vibrant look. A patterned rug can be a statement piece in a neutral kitchen.

### Choose the Right Material

The choice of material is crucial when selecting a kitchen rug. You need something that withstands spills, stains, and heavy foot traffic. Here are popular options to consider:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-rugs-kitchen  
  
- **Polypropylene:** This synthetic fiber is durable, stain-resistant, and often easy to clean. It's an excellent choice for busy kitchens.
- **Cotton:** Soft and comfortable, cotton rugs are easy to wash. However, they may not be as durable as synthetic options, so consider using them in low-traffic areas.
- **Jute:** Ideal for a natural look, jute rugs are eco-friendly and sturdy. They are suitable for dry areas but can be challenging to clean if they get stained.
- **Rubber-backed Rugs:** These rugs provide good traction and prevent slipping. They are perfect for kitchens where spills are common.

### Functionality Matters

Besides style and material, functionality should also guide your rug selection. Think about where you‚Äôll place the rug and how you'll use it:

- **Make Use of Anti-fatigue Mats:** If you spend long hours cooking, consider anti-fatigue mats. These are designed to reduce discomfort while standing for extended periods.
- **Choose the Right Size:** The size of your rug should complement your kitchen layout. Ideally, it should be large enough to fit under your kitchen table or in front of your sink.
- **Cleaning Ease:** Since kitchens can get messy, choose rugs that are easy to clean. Machine-washable rugs or ones you can simply wipe down often simplify maintenance.
- **Safety First:** Ensure your rug has a non-slip backing. You can also use rug pads to keep them secure on the floor.

### Color and Pattern Considerations

When selecting rugs for your kitchen, don't overlook the impact of color and pattern. Light colors can brighten the space but might show stains easily. Darker shades can hide spills better but may make the room feel smaller. If you want more than one rug in the kitchen, consider how they will complement each other in terms of colors and patterns.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-rugs-kitchen  
  
### Seasonal Changes and Trends

Think about your kitchen rugs as part of your seasonal decor. You might want to switch out rugs to reflect the changing seasons. For example, lighter, brighter patterns may suit the bright months of summer, while richer, warmer colors can create a cozy feel in the winter.

Finding the perfect home rugs for your kitchen involves balancing style, material, and functionality. By thinking about how these elements work together, you can create a space that is both beautiful and practical, making your kitchen a welcoming and enjoyable place to be.

Maintaining and Cleaning Kitchen Rugs: Tips for Longevity and Freshness
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Kitchen rugs serve more than just an aesthetic purpose; they also provide safety and comfort when cooking or standing for long periods. However, to keep them looking fresh and to extend their lifespan, maintaining and cleaning kitchen rugs is essential. Here are some practical tips to ensure that your kitchen rugs remain vibrant and hygienic.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-rugs-kitchen  
  
### Regular Vacuuming

One of the simplest yet most effective ways to keep kitchen rugs clean is to vacuum them regularly. Dust, crumbs, and dirt can accumulate quickly. Aim to vacuum your rugs at least once a week. If you notice more debris or spills, you may want to vacuum more frequently. This habit will help prevent larger stains and maintain the rug's appearance.

### Spot Cleaning Stains

Accidents happen, especially in the kitchen. Whether it‚Äôs a drip of coffee or a dot of grease, addressing stains immediately can prevent them from setting. Here‚Äôs how to spot clean:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-rugs-kitchen  
  
- Blot the stain gently with a clean cloth or paper towel to absorb excess liquid without rubbing.
- Mix a solution of mild detergent and warm water or use a carpet cleaner suitable for your rug type.
- Apply the solution to a soft cloth and dab the stained area lightly.
- Rinse with a little water and blot again to remove any soap residue.

### Periodic Deep Cleaning

While regular vacuuming and spot cleaning are essential, deep cleaning your kitchen rugs about every six months is advisable. This process will help remove ground-in dirt and allergens, refreshing your rugs significantly.

You can deep clean your rugs in several ways:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-rugs-kitchen  
  
- **Washing Machine:** If your rug is machine washable, simply follow the care label instructions. Use cold water and a mild detergent. Avoid bleach unless specified.
- **Hand Washing:** For non-machine washable rugs, fill a tub with lukewarm water and mild detergent. Use a soft brush to clean without damaging the fibers.
- **Professional Cleaning:** If your rugs are particularly valuable or delicate, consider hiring a professional cleaner. They have the tools and experience to clean effectively.

### Proper Drying Techniques

After cleaning, it's crucial to dry your kitchen rugs properly to prevent mold and odors. Here are tips for effective drying:

- Gently shake or hang the rug to remove excess water.
- Lay the rug flat to dry, avoiding direct sunlight which can fade colors.
- If possible, hang it outdoors to allow fresh air to circulate, which helps eliminate any damp smell.

### Protecting Against Wear

Aside from cleaning, protecting your kitchen rugs from wear and tear will extend their life. Here are a few strategies:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-rugs-kitchen  
  
- **Use Rugs with Non-Slip Backing:** This helps prevent movement and reduces the chance of tripping hazards.
- **Rotate Your Rugs:** Regularly change the orientation of your rugs to ensure even wear.
- **Limit Exposure to Direct Heat:** Keep rugs away from heated appliances or direct heat sources that can cause fading.

### Choosing the Right Material

Your kitchen rug's material plays a significant role in maintenance. Some materials are easier to clean than others. Consider the following when choosing a rug:

- **Polyester:** Stain-resistant and easy to clean, making it a great choice for kitchens.
- **Nylon:** Durable and often machine washable, ideal for high-traffic areas.
- **Bamboo or Jute:** Eco-friendly options that add texture but may require more maintenance.

When you take care of your kitchen rugs, they not only look great but also enhance the comfort of your cooking space. Regular cleaning, proper drying techniques, and choosing the right material can keep them in pristine condition for years to come. Remember, a little maintenance goes a long way toward ensuring that your kitchen remains a welcoming and stylish environment.

### Conclusion

Selecting the right home rugs for your kitchen is an important decision that can significantly enhance both the style and functionality of the space. By considering factors such as materials, design, and the specific needs of your kitchen, you can find a rug that not only complements your decor but also withstands the daily wear and tear of a bustling culinary environment. A well-chosen rug can unify your kitchen's aesthetics, adding warmth and comfort underfoot while providing necessary slip resistance where you need it most.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-rugs-kitchen  
  
Maintaining and cleaning your kitchen rugs is equally essential to ensure they last and continue to look their best. Regular maintenance, such as vacuuming and spot cleaning spills promptly, can prevent dirt buildup and prolong the life of your rugs. Depending on the material, periodic deep cleaning might be necessary to keep them fresh and vibrant. Following the manufacturer's care instructions can also help safeguard your investment.

Investing in kitchen rugs that combine style, durability, and easy maintenance will transform your cooking area into a cozy, inviting space. By carefully selecting and properly caring for your rugs, you can create a beautiful kitchen environment that is not only functional but also enjoyable for years to come. Remember, the right rug can bring your kitchen to life, making it a true heart of the home where family and friends gather. Choose wisely, and enjoy the benefits that come with a thoughtful approach to your kitchen's design.

My nana has been diagnosed with dementia, but will not discuss that kind of stuff with us and allows no one on her hipaa etc. At her last drs appt a week ago I expressed some concerns with her dr and they told me that she had dementia and we needed to start looking into care, but that was basically all she could say but felt it necessary for her safety. My question is in regards to her ‚Äúscapegoat‚Äù. At her last apartment, there was a guy living next door who was the handyman and had keys and she accused him of stealing her coffee. In her current house when she misplaces things or whatever happens she blames him and says he‚Äôs breaking in and stealing things/arranging things how he wants/doing her embroidery etc etc. All of this is mostly ok and generally we just say ‚Äúoh wow that‚Äôs not very nice of him‚Äù etc. However, she‚Äôs been really angry with all of us and getting mad that we aren‚Äôt stopping him. We‚Äôve tried:  checking and locking her windows etc and making sure she comes with us to see us do it, talking to the neighbors, showing her the footage from her ring doorbell, asking if she wanted me to stay there with her overnight (I just live a few houses down). I‚Äôve also told her I can‚Äôt stop someone I can‚Äôt see or who doesn‚Äôt come around when I‚Äôm there, that I can‚Äôt control the actions of another person and my mom once tried telling her he‚Äôd left town. If we tell her he isn‚Äôt coming in she won‚Äôt speak to us for days, and it‚Äôs getting to where she‚Äôs starting to not want us around because we haven‚Äôt ‚Äúgotten him out of there‚Äù.

1i0wb12,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennyStockLuck/comments/1i0wb12/dd_on_thch_post_rs/,DD on $THCH (post RS),"TH International Limited (THCH) operates as the exclusive franchisee for Tim Hortons in China, managing and expanding the brand‚Äôs footprint. The company is focused on offering a unique coffee and fast-food experience, blending Canadian traditions with localized tastes. It also emphasizes digital integration to cater to tech-savvy consumers in the Chinese market.

Stock Overview Post Reverse Split
	‚Ä¢	Ticker: THCH
	‚Ä¢	Exchange: NASDAQ
	‚Ä¢	Current Price: $3.15 (as shown in the chart)
	‚Ä¢	Recent Split: 1-for-5 reverse stock split on January 13, 2025
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: To meet Nasdaq‚Äôs minimum bid price requirement for continued listing.
	‚Ä¢	Day Range: Around $3.00 - $3.20 based on chart data.

Technical Analysis
	1.	Moving Averages (MA):
	‚Ä¢	MA(5), MA(10), and MA(20) show signs of potential recovery after a steep decline, but the trend is still weak.
	2.	RSI (14):
	‚Ä¢	RSI is trending near oversold levels, suggesting bearish momentum but potential for a rebound if buying pressure increases.
	3.	MACD (12, 26, 9):
	‚Ä¢	The MACD line is below the signal line, indicating continued bearish momentum. No immediate reversal signal is present yet.
	4.	Volume:
	‚Ä¢	Today‚Äôs volume is low at 26,835 shares, which reflects subdued trading activity post-reverse split.

Recent Developments
	1.	Reverse Split Impact:
	‚Ä¢	The 1-for-5 reverse split effectively increased the stock price by consolidating shares, but the trading activity suggests investors remain cautious.
	2.	Market Sentiment:
	‚Ä¢	Low volume post-split indicates a lack of strong investor confidence or significant news to drive momentum.

Strengths
	‚Ä¢	Exclusive Tim Hortons Franchisee: Strong growth potential in the Chinese market, leveraging the Tim Hortons brand.
	‚Ä¢	Digital Integration: Focus on app-based orders and delivery aligns with consumer preferences in China.
	‚Ä¢	Market Position: Operates in a high-growth coffee market with increasing urbanization and demand for premium offerings.

Risks
	1.	Regulatory Challenges: Doing business in China involves navigating complex regulations and potential political tensions.
	2.	Competition: Intense competition from established players like Starbucks and Luckin Coffee could impact market share.
	3.	Post-Split Sentiment: Reverse splits often indicate financial instability or struggles to maintain exchange compliance, which could deter investors.

Conclusion

THCH‚Äôs reverse stock split was a necessary step to maintain its Nasdaq listing, but low trading volume and bearish technical indicators suggest cautious sentiment. The company‚Äôs strong market position in the Chinese coffee space offers potential, but it faces significant competition and operational challenges.

Key Watch Points:
	‚Ä¢	Revenue growth and profitability trends.
	‚Ä¢	Updates on market expansion in China.
	‚Ä¢	Any post-split price stabilization or new announcements to boost investor confidence.

She was sporting a short haircut with a bright pink streak down one side, ‚ÄúDeny, Defend, Depose‚Äù earrings, and a nose ring, so her ignorance was no surprise.

I corrected her in a masculine manner, using facts, statistics, and a strong deep voice. I told her to educate herself, tune out the Luigioid propaganda, and join a megachurch.

It was always Saturday when the clues came crawling out the woodworks. A fella could spend eight days a week putting down wretches shunned by the gods and not understand a damn thing going on in this stinking town. But the ninth day would be Saturday and that's when the beasts got careless. The clues started dropping. And you realized it was better to be clueless.

He melted into smoke when I popped him. Black, gooey smoke, the way I like my coffee. Didn't say a word. Just came at me, all growls and swords. This city's full of beasts. All over the shop, my gramps used to say. But I've been hunting for thirty years. It's gonna take a lot more than a three-hit combo with some tricky hitboxes to turn me Hollow. Gramps taught me something else, this old trick he called the pizza cutter. Doesn't work every time. This time it did and the guy got smoked.

As much as ol' smokey didn't care to talk when he was alive, he sure was mouthy when he was dead. Or at least his wedding ring was, 'cause it told me all I needed to know about the guy. Had to be a wedding ring. High-carat gold, studded with diamonds. The last bit of him left - the last thing that almost kept him sane. It had the most beautiful bird engraved on it. But the guy I just iced was some kind of cat monster. And there was no way any man in the old kingdom would've worn such a dainty animal. Nah, this must've been his wife's family crest or something like that.

I realized I knew the broad. I'd just taken her down last Saturday. Or was it the Saturday before that? Time doesn't mean much to me anymore. Sure looked like a bird to me, just one that forgot to put her skin on that morning. She melted into smoke too. She left behind a ring a lot like this. Just with a big scary lion on it.

Guess I'm the third guy to kill Mufasa.

""Hey boss,"" the new ring whispered right into my head. ""My wearer went mad with grief over the death of his wife and slaughtered all the swamp gnomes he blamed for her death.""

Always wondered what happened to those chumps.

I took those long steps up to the altar, blew some smoke up the bonfire's ass, and stared into the flames for a little bit like a moth wondering whether today was a good day to die.

Thinking about if I was gonna be fighting some giant baby griffon next Saturday with a diaper full of nasty worms. What was he gonna give me? His teething ring, so I can see if he's the kid those seers said was gonna have the chompers of the devil? Is that why they put 'em on ice? The baby for being the prince of darkness, the momma for having him?

I wondered if gramps's pizza cutter was gonna cut it.

Then I flew the coop. Vanished like a ghost. The ghosts of this place had nothing more to say.

This seems like such a stupid question but I can't seem to figure this out. I have created a new modifier and I need to add it to the relevant modifier group. The problem is when I click on one of the empty grid items nothing happens. I believe it's meant to allow me to add a new item to that field however nothing happens when I click. If I right click the only options that shows up are 'delete', 'cut', 'copy, 'paste'. I can't seem to find any way to add a new item. What am I missing? 

What I'm really trying to do is edit the price that has been set at the modifier level for the oat milk but can't seem to do that either. If I figure out how to add a new one then that could be a work around. Btw clicking or double clicking on an existing. button doesn't do anything either. I still can't edit a button price that way either.

  
Any ideas? Please help.

My main purpose for the ebike would be a ""cruise around town, coffee shop runner"" If I could get about 30-40miles per full charge out of it I would be happy, I am also not looking for it to be a PURELY throttle only bike, I am not opposed to pedaling (also having some pedal assist). as for top speed, if I was really feeling it that day, a top out at 30mph feels like enough for me right now.

any insights on this would be super helpful, feel free to ask me any more questions for context on what i;'m looking to get out of my first ebike build to further help me fine tune my build.

Thank you guys in advanced for any advice you give.

\*Also would love to reference a post from the community that I have book marked as my build inspo:

1i0vv1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1i0vv1i/first_church_experience_as_a_newly_exjw/,First Church experience as a newly ex-JW ,"I went to church for the first time. Just because I can, and I actually really liked it.

I am a born-in 4th/5th generation witness, baptized at 14, woke up at 20, got kicked out on my 21st birthday. And I got announced in my hall as ‚Äúno longer one of Jehovahs Witnesses,‚Äù on the last day of 2024 without my consent, and without the elders ever meeting with me. And majority of my family doesn‚Äôt speak to me, except for my inactive jw father who took me in, and I still live with him.

So, it‚Äôs all been a lot. When I was waking up, I originally wanted to be just a Christian because I still liked Jesus and such. I did more research and decided I didn‚Äôt want anything to do with religion, or at least not be practicing any religion. And consider myself an agnostic/atheist, but knew I still wanted to go to some churches and learn about other religions anyways.

It‚Äôs been a very lonely start to the year due to my father being on a trip, and I just needed to go do something. I have been doing the things I never thought I‚Äôd get to do, like buying Christmas stuff, or celebrating new years. I do things now, partly just to prove to myself that these things aren‚Äôt as significant as I was taught my whole life. They are just things. I don‚Äôt really give a shit about pagan origins, it‚Äôs just random stuff humans do to make life a little more fun.

I remember we were taught that basically any other church was like full of demons or something. But now I see them as just any other building.

It was this last Sunday, that I had nothing to do, and I had looked up free churches in my area, so I figured why not. This one had good reviews online, and was nondenominational, whatever that means. They said dress comfortable, so I did. Man, the feeling of wearing jeans and a sweatshirt for church was very nice, I did make sure I looked nice to show respect though.

It was a very small church, not fancy at all. Colorful lights on the ceiling, comfy office chairs. They had little paper slips that you could fill in notes or your name and email. And they played Christian pop music while everyone sat down.

I was absolutely blown away by the music. It was a mother with the sides of her hair shaved, father with a baseball cap long beard and tattoos, and teenage son in pajama pants. They all stood on the very small stage and sang some songs I didn‚Äôt know. The father and mother sang, the father played guitar, and the son was like playing a drum thing. Bro, it was like a mini concert, they were very talented, the songs were fire. Everyone just stood and sang along if they knew it, but if they didn‚Äôt they just swayed. 

I don‚Äôt know why I started crying, maybe it was because I had accidentally pulled an all-nighter the night before. But I think I just get emotional about seeing humans just be genuinely nice and passionate about something. 

Or maybe it was because it‚Äôs such a major contrast to being inside a beige too-bright Kingdom Hall, with the same old music tracks playing, sometimes technical difficulties with awkward silences, and the congregation singing along like out of tune zombies. 

Maybe it was just, I‚Äôm a big fan of live music, and I will cry if it‚Äôs good. Also the lyrics were on a projection screen behind them, and they made my heart like ache, because it was very beautiful. I‚Äôve just been quite weepy these days anyways.

The sermon was okay. It was kind of like TED-talk style, with lots of Bible mixed in. It was about tithing and I didn‚Äôt really enjoy it much, but now I know what tithing is. I liked that the kids went away during it so that they could have a more age appropriate lesson.

They didn‚Äôt pass around a collection plate or anything, but there is a way to donate online, I‚Äôm chill with that.

They did communion, which is something I was really looking forward to. Because, ya know, the way witnesses do memorial, is very very unbiblical, which I was actually really mad about when I found out while waking up. Anyways, they gave a tiny cup of juice and a tiny bit of bread. And it was lovely.

A different speaker talked about it while everyone go got some. And the father from earlier played the guitar a little. Good vibes. What really touched me was how they talked about how Jesus did this to cover our sins, so we don‚Äôt have to go beg for forgiveness every-time we sin. That like floored me. Being taught my whole life, that if I ‚Äúsin‚Äù then I need to go beg Jehovah for forgiveness every-time, and if the ‚Äúsin‚Äù is bad enough you have to go tell the elders.

Maybe I don‚Äôt fully understand communion, but if it‚Äôs accepting an opportunity for sins to be covered over, or it‚Äôs an appreciation of what Jesus did, I thought it was very nice. Even if I don‚Äôt really believe in ‚Äúsin‚Äù anymore. 

I think they ended with another song, and then I got to speak to some of the members. Oh also the card I filled out with my name and email, they said if you drop it off they will give you a Starbucks gift card. And yes they did. 

I got salvation from Jesus, and a flipping gift card from going to church one time. Not once in my entire life devoted as a witness have I received the offer of salvation without obligation, AND a gift card. Come on.

The people I spoke to at the church were lovely. I tried not to cry while I explained my current situation and background. One of the ladies hugged me and it was nice. One of the worker guys said he could answer any questions I have via email.

Idk if I‚Äôll go back to church anytime soon. But definitely a great first experience. It‚Äôs fun doing the shit I‚Äôd get disfellowshipped for, without fear.

I‚Äôm gonna keep doing new stuff, while navigating my new life. Definitely not a Christian now, but it was beautiful to see what a religion could look like when it‚Äôs not a cult.

I liked how informal it all was, like they all loved Jesus/God, but they weren‚Äôt trying to act all uptight and high and mighty like we had to do as witnesses. And despite being informal, it still felt respectful. Idk man, Jesus would definitely hang out there rather than a Kingdom Hall for sure.

Oh also they had rice crispy treats and coffee after. Very nice.",4,1736822087.0,exjw,4,0.7,False
1i0vuqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibroids/comments/1i0vuqx/one_year_post_open_myo/,One year post open myo,"What a journey it has been!

Just had my one year US (vaginal + abdominal) no sign of fibroids (yay)
And my scar tissues are very minimal, majority around my belly button which I'm aware of (still doing scar tissue massage for it). It's a slow progress there, but getting there. My doc and the US techs were super impressed.

Pelvic floor A ok. 

Couple of things I'll share

1. Take your time to heal - believe me I know we've got zillions of things to get to (my sister with her kids are a living example) but we have to heal first - physically and mentally. Be our best self and move forward. Don't rush/force the healing stage.

2. Rehab - this has been a life saver for me. Not an ad at all, but I used Nancy Andersons Ab-rehab. That's where I learnt/maintained the scar tissue massage and slowly building back my abs/pelvic floor and overall strength. Initially we tried s*x and it was painful and awkward but as rehab got easier, it got less uncomfortable and no longer painful. We waited 10weeks or so before trying post surgery.

3.I did not change a thing with my diet/workouts/ routine. I still do my morning coffee, mix afternoon tea, meat (except red - I'm allergic) all the usual stuff.  Eat healthy by all means - we all should, but the aim shouldn't be to shrink/get rid of fibroids. There's no evidence backed research supporting this with a large cohort sample size. 

Do not wait! Advocate, and get the treatment you're comfortable with after doing your own research, cover all your bases. ",9,1736822061.0,Fibroids,0,0.92,False
1i0vubr,https://i.redd.it/53rcr3clfvce1.jpeg,My grade for each member of the gang in the Abbott Elementary crossover episode ,"Dennis: 
Unfortunately, barely in it. However when he was, I found it to be pretty damn funny. He behaved exactly how you‚Äôd expect Dennis would.
Grade: B 

Sweet Dee:
Dee was all over this one, and wow, there were some real highlights (the back and forth with Quinta, the costume / ‚Äúacting‚Äù bit). Kaitlin is so talented. Absolutely outstanding. One aspect that was felt off was the total lack of cursing, inappropriate dialog, and drinking, etc‚Ä¶ but Abbott is not that show. ‚ÄúTurns out Gregory‚Äôs gay!‚Äù
Grade: A

Mac: 
Mac has been the most inconsistent character in recent years so it was not surprising to see a mixed performance. There were moments but none of it really clicked for me, felt empty like a lot of other crossovers go. 
Grade: D

Frank: 
Danny is 80 years old. And he is still willing to do crazy shit like being sewn into a couch for this show, and it wasn‚Äôt even a Sunny episode. I spit out my coffee when I saw him in that cage eating dirt. Surprised he didn‚Äôt make a pass at any of the ladies, but again, Abbott isn‚Äôt that show
Grade: A+

Charlie: 
It‚Äôs always difficult to tell what is and isn‚Äôt scripted with Charlie; every single time he looked into the camera I lost it. Seeing the group of educators find pity in Charlie and seeing him enjoy his time in school really worked for me. 
Grade: A+


Side note: Somehow Frank and Charlie truly seem to maintain the essence of IASIP, their appearance in particular is notably closer than the rest of the cast (clothes and appearance still disheveled like season one)

It's not been long and I feel good about my decision. Technically I'd say it's no contact since I only blocked her on whatsapp (most used messaging app in my country), but she can still call me and I have not blocked her on any social media. This is important because if she wanted to reach me, she can. 

Last week I met with my dad, I had really maintained distance from my entire family, since no one is taking my healthcare issues / chronic illness seriously and they just expect me to do more than the rest in any setting. My dad and I had coffee in a caf√© close to my house, and since he was the one to ask to meet up I let him speak first, I wanted to know what he wanted to say. He said he was worried about my mental health, and that he believed I was seeking a diagnosis but that I didn't have health issues, that it was all in my mind. This worried him, because ""I am young and healthy at 31, not like him, who's 71"". His words, not mine. 

I asked how could he be so sure that I am healthy, if in the two years since I told him about my health decline he had never asked about how I was doing, if i needed someone to come with me to a medical appointment, or if I had any medical updates. He said he got that info from my mom. 

I explained that I am not healthy and that being this young and having such chronic pain and symptoms is horrible for me, that doctors have found things that are wrong with me both in blood work and other exams, but that they just don't seem to care enough to fix them. I also told him I was diagnosed by a rheumatologist a few months back. And I told him that my mom knew all of this. He was speechless, she was twisting the information just because she doesn't believe me, so the facts about my diagnosis were irrelevant to her. 

After the meeting he told me he now had a new panorama of my health and that he was very worried, and that he was glad we talked. I told him I was glad he changed his mind, and that I wanted to maintain distance from my mom for the time being, since her actions hurt me a lot. He told me how she was super worried about me and how she wanted to talk to me, and that she didn't hurt me. I explained (because boomer parents never seem to understand this), that while her intentions may have been good, her actions had hurt me. And that this was something that she couldn't deny, because it wasn't up to her, it was up to me to define if I was hurt by her actions. He understood. 

So here's the real kicker: my mom is a psychologist, and she linked me to my current therapist five years ago since they had colleagues in common and someone recommended him to her. Today, my therapist called me to let me know she reached out to him to ask if they could talk about me, because she was really distressed about this situation and worried about me. He wanted me to hear it from him, and said he rejected that ask, since it was not ok. I felt (and still feel) RAGE. HOW DARE HER? THE ONLY REASON SHE HAS HIS CONTACT INFO IS BECAUSE SHE HAS THE SAME PROFESSION, NOT BECAUSE I GAVE IT TO HER. 

ALSO: The only acceptable reason for her to contact my therapist would be if she was worried me committing su1c1d3 or something like that, but other than that... therapy is a private space. 

**IF SHE HAS ANY TYPE OF DISTRESS SHE NEEDS TO GO TO THERAPY HERSELF, NOT COME TO INVADE MY SPACE IN THE NAME OF WORRY.** 

I'm sorry for the rant but **I fucking hate her** and can't believe it took me this long to cut her off when she has made my life miserable since I was 10 years old. ",3,1736821669.0,Nocontactfamily,3,1.0,False

I have an incredible boyfriend who I know would do anything for me. He is a great man, no social media (aside FB), doesn't entertain other women, doesn't hide his phone, faithful; a provider, a hard worker, and wants a family with me. I feel lucky to have a man like this. We've been dating for about 7 months.

However, I find myself having to ask him to do things that shouldn't have to be asked. For example, over the past few months, I've had to ask him to shower properly (I discovered he wasn't washing his ass or his armpits well enough, lol) & I would have to ask him to put on deodorant, brush his teeth, get his clothes off the floor, things I feel like I shouldn't have to ask a grown man to do. Today, these things aren't much of an issue anymore bc he has mostly corrected them. I still have to ask him if he put deodorant on or brushed his teeth, often which the answer is no, but then he goes & does it.

There are other things that I have to ask: he snores & it keeps me up. He got nose strips to try to help that, but he won't put it on unless I ask him to. He has never gone a night where he would take it upon himself to just put it on so he can ensure I get some sleep. I have to ask him to wash dishes (he will put his own dirty dishes in the sink & just leave it there), take out the trash, put the toilet seat down, & put stuff away/put them back. This is all when he stays at my apartment. It really puts me into mommy mode which turns me off.

We don't live together but we talk about wanting to get married & have children. I find myself worrying that I will be married to someone who needs me to ask them to do things in order for them to be done. I worry that if he sees that the dishes aren't done, he won't do them unless I ask. If we have a baby & I am up with the newborn, he won't get up & help me unless I ask. If I come home from being out to the store or seeing a friend, will the house be a mess & dishes in the sink because I didn't ask him to do it? He doesn't think having to ask is a big deal, but as a nurse who works with dementia patients, I know that repeating myself gets really old really fast. I want my partner to be considerate enough to just do what needs to be done without me having to ask.

I need to add that we have a traditional viewpoint on relationships. He wants to provide & take care of me financially & he tells me that I don't need to work if I don't want to. I will be a stay at home wife & care for the house and children, however I do think I might want to work a 8 or 12 hour shift maybe once a week so I can be social & make a little money for fun.

I don't want him to worry about laundry or other cleaning, as I want to take care of all of that for him. I'll also be doing the cooking & taking care of our home. We are in an argument because of this. AITA? Or should I cut him so slack & accept that I will just have to ask him to do things?

  
EDIT* I never said that this man smells. He doesn‚Äôt. And he does brush his teeth once a day, but sometimes after a night of drinking and let‚Äôs say Taco Bell, I have to ask him to brush them. But he has never smelled bad. He‚Äôs incredible in the manner that he is faithful and doesn‚Äôt play games. I can go through his phone and there‚Äôs nothing to hide. He buys me whatever I want. He works hard and has work ambition, is an electrician with a business. He buys me flowers and chocolate twice a month. Gets up and buys my coffee for me every morning. He tries his best to do whatever I ask of him and I know he is trying his best to make me happy. He no longer leaves clothes on the floor and takes his shoes off before coming in to the apartment‚Äîthings I‚Äôve asked of him. He showers me in love and words of affirmation every day. But I still find myself mommying him‚Ä¶that is the issue here. 

EDIT** He does wash properly now. I began to notice a tiny bit of BO at one point and then when we started showering together I started to notice he wasn‚Äôt washing properly. I know he washes properly now, as he has listened to my advice and taken it‚Ä¶as I said in my post, it has mostly been corrected except for the occasional, ‚Äúdid you put deodorant on??‚Äù He is not a lazy smelly scumbag.

Things like the best method to strip it, best clear coat to use for a coffee table, and how to rebond and straighten the boards that are separating. Read below if you want more details. 

[Here is the table](https://imgur.com/a/prwDIlN)

I recently got this coffee table that I'd like to refinish. It belonged to an uncle who loved woodworking and practiced it his whole life, but recently passed away. He really loved this particular table. It's been passed around in my family for years, but in my uncle's final days, he didn't take very good care of it. He taught me some woodworking growing up, but nothing beyond amateur level skills. 

I'd love to refinish this (although as an amateur I know it won't be perfect), but I need advice on how to go about it. I've refinished some wood projects, but nothing with multiple types of wood or anything as complex as this.

It appears to be hardwood, not vaneer. I'm unsure of what type of clear coat is on it, so I don't know if sanding or a stripper is the best method. Some of the pieces of wood are also separating, so I imagine I will need to reglue them. Some are warped unfortunately, so I'm not sure how to straighten or repair them. Then I wanted advice on what the best clear coat is for a coffee table. I've mostly used polycrylic and lacquer for other projects, but I'm not sure if either of those are suited for this.

Any tips would be highly appreciated. I'd love to use the skills my uncle taught me to restore it as best as I can!",0,1736821590.0,woodworking,0,0.5,False

1i0vk0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i0vk0v/aita_for_worrying_about_my_bully/,AITA for worrying about my bully?,"For some context, I used to go to a different school before switching, where I was bullied mercilessly for being an immigrant and my poor social skills by members of a big group. One of the members of said-group who didn't partake in the bullying, or so it seemed, had feelings for me.  Just a tiny crush, probably. I thought he was kind of cute. Nothing more. We were in the 'talking stage', which is the best way to put it. One of the girls in the group had it out for him, for too, and took it out on me. She spread false rumors, especially on the internet, like on Discord and DMS in Instagram, and Discord with group chats, and some of the very few people in my social circle turned on me. I became withdrawn with hatred.

She took that opportunity a few months or so to begin dating him, but I didn't care about it. I instead was in tears looking through the messages people said about me on Discord and contemplated ending my life.

There was one thing that I wanted to talk about because I just can't hold it in anymore; when I was talking to him, he mentioned in messages how he had a preference for skinny people. He told me he didn't really like my body shape, which is obviously horrible to tell to a young girl (he was a bit older). I wasn't fat but definitely not skinny either. Like I had back rolls and stuff, but I didn't have a muffin top or body stretches. I also didn't have collarbones.

So I started my exercise campaign, fueled with insecurity. I began drinking herbal drinks, exercising with my own yoga mat my parents bought, and soon lost a lot of weight. I had collarbones and only one back roll around my waist. I looked like a different human being.

During this period the girl did what she did (I don't know by what means) and I almost developed an eating disorder because of how disoriented the image of my body became, not because of him. I'm doing way better now, and I've gained weight, too, but I'm happier with thunder thighs and almost no collarbone. As long as I don't have a double chin, I'll be happy eating.

After transferring schools, the girl did the same. According to my friends from the previous school, she was bullied and kicked out of the friend group. They presume she's still dating him. But every time I see her passing by when changing classes or something I just noticed how sickly and skinny she's become. She didn't look bad back then. She is really pretty!

I staged an intervention today after school where I talked to her with some of my friends staying back in case I needed support. I won't say much but she was pissed off at me. I asked her if the guy was treating her right and even given our history, I'd love to go get a coffee or something. She told me to f off and that I'm an a-hole for worrying about her when I've caused her so much pain. I snapped and asked her how that's possible when she spread things about me but she told me that because I became so withdrawn from all the bullying that I wasn't the one stuck in an abusive relationship. I went silent. She told me how much the guy fantasized about being with me because of my weight loss in the early stages of their relationship before I left, and how he's now 'forgotten about me' after I gained the weight. I told her that's not my problem. We finished the discussion with an argument but I shouted something along the lines of, 'I know you hate me, but I can't bear to see you like this!' and she shot back that this is exactly how I want to see her after what she did to me.

I don't know to what to think or do. AITA? And if I am or am not, what can I do?",4,1736821158.0,AITAH,11,1.0,False

1i0vhf3,https://i.redd.it/pahge9mccvce1.jpeg,Starved ,"Spartan was rescued in 2018. He came from a kill shelter in Texas and was very malnourished and starved. I worked really hard the first year to get him to feel better about food. I know once starved always starved but he gained weight and was healthy again and isn‚Äôt food aggressive at anything of those sorts. He never misses a meal though. 

We recently moved to TX and had to board him for a week. It looks like they didn‚Äôt feed him at all when he was there. Visibly looks skinnier. A lot skinnier. 

He is now eating everything he can get his eyes on‚Ä¶ ramen, a cup of Andes mints with their wrappers, two bags of dog treats, paper coffee cup, puppy chow, Pedialyte powder, etc. that he has just nabbed when we weren‚Äôt looking. He is always very ashamed of himself and puts himself in time out until he feels like he was in time out long enough.
