We met up to get a coffee together and then decided to smoke a joint together. He had me pay because he made a vow to never spend money on that again which is fine and I agreed but I found it unattractive. Throughout the entire date, I felt like I was carrying the conversation and it seemed like he would judge me over every little things like my decision to do online school and other random things about me and my hobbies/ lifestyle. After the date I had already decided I didn't like his personality and we didn't even have chemistry. We ended the date since it was getting late and he gave me an awkward handshake like it was some business deal we had just finished. I gave it a week more of talking to him to see if my feelings would change but they didn't and I was tempted to ghost him but I decided to be mature and kind in the way I let him know. Unfortunately he had the reaction I was afraid of if I did not ghost him.  ",1,1769725157.0,tinderstories,0,1.0,False

Here’s what I saw, maybe, IDK (chaotic long post warning)","Okay so first off I don’t even know how I got this. Basically a Rockstar dev on Discord trusted me somehow (don’t ask) and I got a key mid-2025. I played like a couple hours here and there. Maybe 5–12 hours? Most of this is from dev menu notes, screenshots, and the Discord chat, not me actually playing the full game. Things can totally change, be removed, whatever. Don’t try this at home.

⸻

ONLINE START / HOSPITAL / JEFF

	•	You start in a hospital bed, apparently that’s how online starts?? Customize face, hair, clothes, personality. Why hospital? No idea. Notes just say so.

	•	Meet Jeff, ex-gang guy, stays in character. Shows you businesses, gives a gun, explains heat/attention, tiny contact jobs.

	•	Early stuff: find cash bags, do mini-jobs, maybe buy safehouse. Heat bar goes up → cops/gangs get mad. Heat bar low → chill.

	•	You can mess with people, but cops/gangs react, business can shut down temporarily.

⸻

CAMPAIGN HALF-DONE / MINI-HEISTS / RANDOM STUFF

	•	Chapters 1–4 half done. Chapter 5? Some missions listed in dev menu but unplayable. Placeholder/testing.

	•	Mini-heists: pawn shop → hideout → melt jewelry → sell like cargo crate business. I didn’t actually play this, just notes/screenshots.

	•	Random encounters: homeless people, cash bags, fake movie props.

	•	Weapons: 3 max carried, dual wield not back from Red Dead. Extra in vehicle trunk. Animations unfinished.

	•	Campaign basically a testing ground for online stuff too — mini-heists, businesses, expansion content.

⸻

SWITCHING CHARACTERS / BAR / HOT COFFEE

	•	You can switch between Jason & Lucia in missions or free roam like GTA V, seamless-ish.

	•	BAR / relationship system: do stuff they like → bar up → boosts/morale.

	•	Hot coffee mentioned in dev notes. Solo possible, toys required, controller vibrates. Cutscenes if other character walks in. Not playable, probably testing.

	•	Hair/beard: long/short for both characters. Hair salon for cuts.

⸻

ONLINE / VICE CITY-ISH / BUSINESSES

	•	Very early, screenshots show 10 players max, likely testing before bigger sessions (20–30+).

	•	Uses Vice City assets, small businesses, mini-heists, content tested in campaign first.

	•	Online businesses: car wash, underground fight/gun club. Legal/illegal path changes cops/gang reactions.

	•	Mini-contracts: tie into heat/attention. Get shot at → repair. Temporary shutdown if cops/gangs respond.

	•	Respect/reputation matters: high respect → NPCs react differently, gangs avoid you, women respond differently.

	•	Level system pink font. Low → ammo, cash, starter weapons. High → luxury stuff, rare weapons, unlockables.

	•	Trunk/inventory system stores extra items.

⸻

WEAPONS / GOLD UZI / PACKS / EXPANSION

	•	Gold Uzi exists, probably for testing weapon transfer after content packs (Liberty City expansion).

	•	Expansion packs mostly single-player, notes hint some items could move to online later.

	•	Unlocks online depend on level/respect, low-level → minor stuff, high-level → luxury items.

	•	Weapons limited: 3 max, trunk for extra. Animations unfinished.

⸻

LEFTOVERS / ANIMATIONS / FUN STUFF

	•	GTA V characters for animation skeleton testing. Red Dead guns, horse (unused).

	•	Activities: golf, fight club, mini-games — placeholders.

	•	Campaign & online share skeletons. Main characters get more motion, NPCs limited.

⸻

RELATIONSHIPS / RANDOM ENCOUNTERS / FUN

	•	Jason & Lucia switchable, BAR system exists.

	•	Hot coffee notes, not playable, affects morale.

	•	Random encounters: cash bags, homeless, fake movie props.

	•	Businesses: fun layouts, goofy ways to move products, smuggle, wrap, etc.

⸻

CAMPAIGN → ONLINE CONNECTION

	•	Campaign testing feeds online: mini-heists, businesses, content packs, random events.

	•	Heat/attention, trunk/inventory, weapons testing, reputation/respect — all overlaps.

⸻

PSA / REALITY CHECKS

	•	EARLY DEVELOPMENT. Bugs, crashes, lag spikes, unfinished animations, half-done chapters.

	•	Campaign half-done, online very early.

	•	Gold Uzi, hot coffee, mini-contracts, expansions — could all be removed.

	•	I did not take screenshots or copy files, info comes from dev notes, menu files, Discord chats.

	•	Don’t try to hunt builds. Rockstar notices.

⸻

SUMMARY / CONDENSED

	•	Online intro: hospital → meet Jeff → mini-jobs → heat/attention → businesses → safehouse → respect/level → unlocks

	•	Campaign: half-done chapters → mini-heists → businesses → random encounters → weapons/trunk

	•	Switching characters: Jason & Lucia seamless, BAR system, hot coffee mentions (vague)

	•	Leftovers: GTA V characters, Red Dead guns, mini-games, horse, animations

	•	Weapons / packs: Gold Uzi, expansion packs, weapon transfer testing

	•	Everything speculative, could all change.",0,1769724830.0,GTAV,0,0.5,False

Am I overthinking?,"So I work in a big store and there’s a girl I like who works on a completely different floor (I’m on the 4th floor, she’s on -1).

A few days ago I went down there using the excuse that I was “looking for a gift for my sister” (I don’t actually have a sister, I just wanted to start a conversation). We talked a bit, learned each other’s names, and since then I’ve passed by a few times just to say hi and make small talk.

She always seemed friendly, smiled, joked a little (I teased her about her Adidas tracksuit once and she laughed), asked where I work, what I do, etc. Nothing awkward.

Eventually I followed her on Instagram, she followed back, and we exchanged a few short messages. She even sent me a gym video with her friend. Sometimes she replies fast, sometimes slow.

Yesterday I went to her section again, helped her with a couple of sales, and we talked more about work, studies, and random stuff. At one point she was standing pretty close to me and the vibe felt comfortable.

Before leaving, I told her I had to go back upstairs and directly asked:

“Would you like to go for a coffee sometime?”

She said yes, smiled, and I handed her my phone so she could type her contact, but she joked that her supervisor might see and “send her to the unemployment office” (lol), so we didn’t do it right there.

Later that day I messaged her on Instagram saying I just finished my exams and asked if she’d like to go for coffee on Sunday.

It’s been about 5 hours with no reply yet, and I’m starting to overthink — even though she said yes in person.

Am I reading too much into the response time?

1qqmqt8,https://i.redd.it/1vwi1lpq3dgg1.jpeg,Open Beta: I built my first iOS app with no prior Swift experience; looking for feedback,"I've been working on a music discovery app for the last 3 weeks after speaking with my friend who's been DJing for a few years now and has definitely influenced some of my music taste. Happy to share my progress and ask for feedback on my first mobile app: Sona.

Sona is a music discovery app powered by people and places, not algorithms.

Website: [https://sonafm.com/](https://sonafm.com/)

We were talking about how discovering music feels so algorithmic lately. Our feeds are always trying to push us specific sounds and content that may not be what we want to see or hear. Or even worse, I thought about where I've found ""newer"" music and the answer was pretty simple: through people and places. I love discovering new music out in the real world, whether that's at a local cafe in the city or while I'm out at a DJ set. Yes, Shazam is a thing and a cool tool but I feel like discovering new music is a lot more than just ""audio detection."" Sometimes I want to remember where I heard it or with who.

With the right usage, I thought it would be pretty cool to have this global guide where you can see what's being played where and by who or keep up with people whose taste you trust. Or even see what specific bars and cafes are playing. Music discovery through people, not algorithms. And if you don't want another ""social media"" app, then you can always opt-in to keep your profile and your discoveries private from viewing. What you'll have is still a pretty cool app (I think) for music logging and map of your own discoveries.

Tech Stack:

\- SwiftUI for the UI

\- Supabase for the backend

\- ShazamKit for audio recognition

\- MapKit for venue detection

\- Lots of back and forth with Claude Code",1,1769724567.0,buildinpublic,0,1.0,False

1qqmo4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/VestibularMigraines/comments/1qqmo4v/not_sure_if_i_am_experiencing_a_vm/,Not sure if I am experiencing a VM?,"Hi all. I hope this is allowed but I didn’t really get good feedback from the dizziness subreddit.

Background info on me: I am 27F. I have anxiety and OCD that has been probably the worst it has ever been starting around this time last year. I do not take any meds. I also have an extreme fear of throwing up and/or passing out. I was sick in November and then again the week before Christmas with a respiratory virus (never tested myself for anything).

On Jan 7th (so three weeks ago), I was getting ready to shower when I started feeling lightheaded and floaty. I was scared I was going to pass out (it wasn’t presyncope level but I was unsure what this feeling was and I was nervous it was going to escalate to that. So I finish showering all while continuing to feel this weird floaty, bouncy, lightheadedness feeling. I felt dizzy but I do not think it was true vertigo because it wasn’t like the room was spinning, it was moreso me???

So I was obviously freaked out the rest of the night and felt nauseous. It was also a week before my period was due, so I chocked it up to a weird PMS symptom (I have been suspecting I have PMDD). Except the feeling continues on the next day, and the next day, and even when I had my period.

It is such a weird feeling to describe but essentially at random points in the day, I will experience these lightheaded/swaying/floaty episodes that last maybe 5-30 mins. Sometimes I have a headache and pressure in my head when it happens and sometimes it is just the weird feeling. Sometimes there is nausea. I have been staying home from work since this has started because I am terrified to drive and I work with kids as a speech therapist and I fear being dizzy or panicking when working.

I went to an ENT who said I have labyrinthitis but he diagnosed me with this before my hearing test that revealed normal hearing during the appointment. He also wrote in my chart that I had “some nystagmus in both directions” but he never said that to me in person and no one has ever told me I had nystagmus before. He prescribed me 2mg valium which I have not taken.

So all my research is showing me that normal hearing is not part of labyrinthitis, so I am not sure I agree with this diagnosis. In the mean time, I won’t be able to see my PCP again until March and I have been so depressed feeling like I will never get better. I understand that chronic conditions can appear at any time in life, but not having a definitive diagnosis is weighing on me.

In the mean time, I am not getting paid as I am a 1099 worker. I do not have health insurance. I am privileged to be living at home with my parents but am feeling guilty that I am letting my clients down (i work with autistic kids). I cry a lot because I do not feel like myself. I find myself researching a lot on reddit and feel very discouraged.

I do not have a history of migraine as I never had an aura or anything like that. But on occasion throughout the years, I have had bad headaches that I always thought was just PMS related that were managed with tylenol. I also have felt a floaty panicking feeling after drinking cold brew from starbucks once but I have had other drinks from starbucks and my own coffee that causes no symptoms, so I am unsure if caffeine is a trigger. I have not had caffeine since this started and I continue to have symptoms.

Apologies for the long post and I do not expect a diagnosis from anyone here but was curious if anyone can relate to this or if this sounds like a VM? It has been 3 weeks and while it was worse before my period, I had another bad day when I was ovulating and now the symptoms are just kinda the same.

Due to my height at 6'3 it was harder for me to find clothes at my place so i had to tell people to buy me those from outside, which i didn't choose obviously. it was like it should just fit me.

 1. Dark blue jeans 3

 6. a shirt that feels a little less length (white with vertical red and blue stripes

**Shoes**

 2. Going to buy White sneakers 
 3. Blackish sports shoes

I still remember the moment a friend’s 5‑year‑old zoned out of her tablet, picked up a crayon, and got lost in coloring.  
Suddenly, the noise stopped — no YouTube jingles, no notifications… just tiny hands, focused joy, and color spilling onto paper.  

That small moment hit me harder than I expected.  
Kids aren’t just “entertained” when they color — they’re learning calm, self‑focus, and emotional expression in the most natural way possible.  

That’s exactly why I helped create a **kids coloring ebook** designed to bring back that calm, creative energy.  
It’s simple on purpose — bold shapes, friendly characters, and joyful pages that let kids *feel proud* of what they make.  

Before I share it, here’s something science (and parents everywhere) already know:  
- Coloring encourages emotional regulation and mindfulness.  
- It helps kids develop fine motor skills and creativity.  
- It gives parents a peaceful window to just… breathe.  

If you’ve watched your child struggle to focus or unwind, coloring might just be the most low‑tech, high‑value solution around.  

✨ **Here’s something special for this community:**  
We’re doing a *massive giveaway* and sharing the entire coloring ebook completely free.  
Grab your copy here → [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)  

It’s perfect for preschoolers and creative little ones who love to color for fun — not perfection.  
And if you know a parent who could use a calm afternoon, feel free to share the link with them too:  
👉 [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)  

This isn’t about selling anything — it’s about giving families a reminder that creativity *still matters*.  
Even five minutes of coloring can reset a child’s mood and remind them joy doesn’t have to come from a screen.  

❤️ Let’s spread more calm and color to more homes.  
You can download or gift the free coloring ebook again here:

If even one kid finds a little peace (and one parent gets five quiet minutes with coffee), that’s already worth it.

Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text. In the interest of both your time and my own, **I kindly ask that you read the post carefully in case you see anything that could a dealbreaker for either of us.** With that out of the way...

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* **Childfree** (this means you neither have NOR want children. This is non-negotiable.)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and/or made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?
4. Would you rather live in 24 hours of daylight or darkness?",1,1769723544.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1qqm9lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSurgery/comments/1qqm9lx/common_preop_guidelines/,Common Pre-Op guidelines,"Most common questions for Pre-Op 

 

It may be different with your surgeons offices. However, these were the guidelines that were given to be during my pre anesthesia call. It would have been nice if I was sent these info via email or letter. So i figure my notes could be helpful to someone who wants to know what are the pre-ops of top surgery. 

\-surgery time: 

check in 1.5 hours of prep + 2.5 hours of surgery + 2-3 hour recovery time = total 6.5 hours 

 

Medications: 

The Anesthesiologists will go over all your current medication list for me: 

\-continue testosterone, but she did ask when i do my injections and i do it weekly fridays and my surgery date is mid-week so it maybe different for others. I heard some surgeons require us to stop T a few weeks prior and after but it is an outdated requirement. But im sure there are a few surgeons who are still old school and will strictly require you to do so.  

\-multivitamin stop 1 week prior to surgery  

\- if you any reason you need pain relieve before surgery or day of surgery it is ok to take Acetaminophen (Tylenol). NO Ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin), Naproxen (Aleve), Aspirin 

\-NO nicotine 3 weeks before and 3 weeks after top surgery (No smoking, no patches, no vaping) 

\-No alcohol one week prior to surgery 

\-1-2 days prior to surgery date will get reminder call with check in and surgery time 

\-no shaving 2 days before surgery 

\- Wash with over the counter antibacterial soap night before and the morning of surgery ( you can order from amazon any brand as long as it labeled as antibacterial soap) 

After antibacterial wash: 

\-No skin products ( example body lotion, face lotion,  deodorant) 

\-NO eating before 8 hours check in time. Before 8 hours of check in time eat only light meal 

\------------------------------------------------ 

Day of Surgery: 

\- Allowed clear liquid up to 2 hrs before ( examples of clear liquid, black coffee only (no milk no creamer etc, apple juice, tea, water)  

\-Don’t bring any jewelry 

\-Wear loose clothes. I found some mastectomy shirts with drain pockets. I prefer the zip up instead of buttons there are plenty of choice on amazon. You should pick 1 or 2 sizes up for the spacing of the draining seems to fit well.  

\-Bring insurance card and photo id 

\-If you bring anything else like phone etc will be placed in a plastic bag along with your clothes and it will be not secured however, I haven’t had any issue with previous surgery usually there is a nurse in the room with you and I never had anything to worry about. 

 

Post surgery: 

\-If taking any narcotics NO driving, driving is ok whenever you are comfort in doing so 

\-No heaving lifting for 6 weeks or strenuous excising. Walking is recommended. 

\-Sleeping upright on a wedge pillow is recommended but not required. For me i have to sleep either at 90 degree angle or flat. I tried the other angles and it causes me discomfort with my back i do use under the knee pillow too. The 90 degree angle is the most comfort second to flat on back. So im not sure if i will end up using a wedge pillow or not.  

\- Post op for drain removal is 1 week after surgery date, these are attached with safety pins  

and will get a fitted binder during the visit 

Skip this last part unless you happen to have surgery at this location: (I tend to get lost so even though i been there before)

A flicker of recognition dawned on Clarisse's face. She recognized Mr. Brunner as being Chiron in disguise. Just the same as Mr. Brunner recognized Clarisse for who she is too, with Percy being none the wiser about the connection, for now.

Mr. Brunner's eyes twinkled with silent acknowledgment as they met Clarisse's. She straightened in her chair, a subtle nod passing between them—a secret language Percy couldn't decipher.

""On a battlefield,"" Mr. Brunner repeated thoughtfully. ""How fitting, considering history's tendency to repeat itself.""

Percy frowned, glancing between them. ""Am I missing something here?""

""Always,"" Clarisse muttered under her breath.

Mr. Brunner steepled his fingers. ""Percy, I've arranged for Clarisse to join several of your classes, including Latin. Given your... similar learning profiles, I thought you might benefit from studying together.""

""Similar learning profiles?"" Percy echoed incredulously. ""No offence, but we're nothing alike.""

Clarisse snorted. ""More than you know, Jackson.""

Mr. Brunner cleared his throat. ""Miss La Rue has overcome significant challenges with dyslexia and ADHD, much like yourself. Her methods might prove helpful to you.""

Percy stared at Clarisse with new eyes. She met his gaze defiantly, as if daring him to comment.

""Additionally,"" Mr. Brunner continued, ""I understand your mother works long hours, Percy. Perhaps Clarisse could assist you with after-school studies when Mrs. Jackson is unavailable.""

""I don't need a babysitter,"" Percy protested.

""No,"" Clarisse agreed, a dangerous gleam in her eye. ""What you need is someone to teach you how to defend yourself.""

Mr. Brunner raised an eyebrow. ""An interesting suggestion, Miss La Rue.""

""New York isn't safe,"" Clarisse said, turning to look out the window as if scanning for threats. ""Especially for someone like him.""

""Someone like me?"" Percy repeated, frustration building. ""What does that even mean?""

Mr. Brunner wheeled himself around the desk, coming to rest directly before them. ""It means, Percy, that Clarisse recognizes something in you that you haven't yet recognized in yourself.""

The cryptic answer only irritated Percy more. ""Great. More riddles. Just what I need.""

Mr. Brunner's expression softened. ""In time, Percy. For now, I believe Miss La Rue's suggestion has merit. Basic self-defence is a valuable skill for any young person in the city.""

Clarisse leaned forward. ""I could teach him. Nothing fancy, just enough to keep him alive—"" she caught herself, ""—I mean, safe.""

Mr. Brunner nodded thoughtfully. ""That would require Mrs. Jackson's permission, of course.""

""Mom will never go for it,"" Percy said confidently. His mother was protective, always steering him away from anything remotely dangerous.

""We'll see,"" Clarisse replied with surprising confidence.

When they exited the classroom, Sally was waiting patiently, thumbing through a dog-eared paperback. She looked up with a warm smile that made even Clarisse's stern expression soften slightly.

""Everything okay?"" Sally asked.

""Mrs. Jackson,"" Clarisse began before Percy could speak, ""I was wondering if I could offer Percy some self-defence lessons. Nothing extreme—just basic techniques.""

Percy waited for his mother's immediate refusal, but to his shock, she looked thoughtful.

""Self-defence?"" Sally repeated, studying Clarisse with newfound interest. ""You know how to fight?""

""My father insisted,"" Clarisse said, and something in her tone made Sally's eyes widen slightly. ""I've been training since I was seven.""

Sally glanced at Percy, then back to Clarisse. ""You're very young to be teaching.""

""Age doesn't matter,"" Clarisse replied. ""Skill does. And survival.""

That last word hung in the air between them. Percy watched his mother's expression shift from concern to something more complex—as if she was hearing a hidden message in Clarisse's words.

""Percy does need to learn to protect himself,"" Sally said finally, her voice barely above a whisper.

""Mom?"" Percy couldn't believe what he was hearing.

Sally squared her shoulders, decision made. ""You can teach him, but I want to be present for the first few lessons. To observe.""

Clarisse nodded, respect evident in her posture. ""That's fair.""

Percy looked between them, feeling like he'd stepped into an alternate reality where his mother and this intimidating girl had formed some sort of alliance.

""Don't I get a say in this?"" he asked.

""No,"" they answered in unison, then exchanged surprised glances.

Sally checked her watch. ""I need to get back to work soon. Clarisse, our apartment isn't far from here. Would tonight work for dinner and maybe a first lesson?""

""Perfect,"" Clarisse agreed.

As they walked out of the school building, Percy lagged behind, watching his mother and Clarisse engage in conversation. Something had changed in Clarisse's demeanour—her usual aggressive stance softened almost imperceptibly as she listened to Sally talk about her writing aspirations and her job at the candy shop.

""You work two jobs,"" Percy heard Clarisse say quietly.

""Three, sometimes,"" Sally admitted with a tired smile. ""But we manage.""

Percy saw Clarisse's eyes harden momentarily. ""Fathers should provide,"" she muttered.

Sally's step faltered. ""Percy's father... he was lost at sea. Before Percy was born.""

The lie was familiar to Percy—or at least, he'd always assumed it was a nicer story than ""he abandoned us."" But something in the way Clarisse studied his mother made him wonder if there was more to it.

""Lost at sea,"" Clarisse repeated, shooting Percy a significant look over her shoulder. ""Interesting.""

That evening, Percy's small apartment smelled of garlic and tomato sauce. His mother had prepared spaghetti—with blue noodles, of course—and the promised chocolate chip cookies were cooling on a rack by the window.

Clarisse arrived exactly on time, wearing a faded red t-shirt and black athletic pants. She'd brought a small duffel bag, which she set carefully by the door.

""This is..."" she began, looking around the cozy but cramped apartment, ""...nice.""

Percy could tell she was being polite. Their apartment was small, with water stains on the ceiling and the lingering smell of Gabe's cigars despite Sally's best efforts with air freshener. Percy's stepfather was mercifully absent—out playing poker with his buddies, which meant they had until midnight before his inevitable drunken return.

""It's not much,"" Sally said, wiping her hands on a dish towel, ""but it's home.""

Clarisse's eyes lingered on an empty beer can Gabe had left on the coffee table, her expression darkening. She picked it up without comment and tossed it in the trash.

Dinner was surprisingly pleasant. Percy watched in amazement as Clarisse devoured three helpings of spaghetti, complimenting his mother's cooking with genuine enthusiasm. Sally, in turn, kept offering Clarisse more food, more cookies, more everything—as if trying to make up for some absence she sensed in the girl's life.

""So, Clarisse,"" Sally said as they finished the cookies, ""tell me about your family.""

Percy tensed, expecting Clarisse to shut down or snap. Instead, she carefully placed her cookie on her plate.

""It's just my dad and me,"" she said. ""We move around a lot because of his... job.""

""And your mother?"" Sally asked gently.

Clarisse's expression hardened. ""Not in the picture.""

Sally reached across the table and briefly squeezed Clarisse's hand—a gesture so unexpected that Clarisse froze. ""I'm sorry to hear that. You're welcome here anytime.""

Percy watched something flicker across Clarisse's face—vulnerability quickly masked by her usual toughness. For a moment, he almost felt sorry for her.

""Should we start the lesson?"" Clarisse asked abruptly, standing from the table.

They cleared space in the living room, pushing the coffee table against the wall. Sally sat on the couch, watching with careful eyes as Clarisse unzipped her duffel bag.

""What are those?"" Percy asked as Clarisse pulled out what looked like padded training mitts and hand wraps.

""Basic equipment,"" she replied, tossing him the hand wraps. ""Put these on. They'll protect your wrists and knuckles.""

Percy fumbled with the long strips of fabric. ""I don't know how—""

""Here,"" Sally said, rising from the couch. She took the wraps and began winding them expertly around Percy's hands.

Both Percy and Clarisse stared at her in surprise.

""What?"" Sally smiled mysteriously. ""I wasn't always a candy shop worker.""

Once Percy's hands were properly wrapped, Clarisse stood before him, feet shoulder-width apart.

""First rule,"" she said, her voice shifting into something authoritative, ""always be aware of your surroundings. Most attacks happen because people aren't paying attention.""

She circled him slowly. ""Second rule: stance matters. The way you stand determines whether you'll stay on your feet or end up on the ground.""

Clarisse nudged his feet apart with her foot, then pushed his shoulder. Percy stumbled backward.

""See? Weak foundation.""

For the next hour, Clarisse drilled Percy on basic stances, how to fall safely, and simple blocks. Sally watched intently from the couch, occasionally nodding in approval. Percy was surprised to find Clarisse was actually a decent teacher—demanding but clear in her instructions.

""You're thinking too much,"" Clarisse said after Percy hesitated during a blocking drill. ""In a real fight, you won't have time to think. Your body needs to react.""

""Maybe that's enough for today,"" Sally suggested, noticing Percy's frustration.

""One more thing,"" Clarisse insisted. She positioned herself in front of Percy. ""Hit me.""

""What?"" Percy blinked.

""Hit me,"" she repeated. ""Right here."" She tapped her shoulder.

Percy glanced at his mother, who looked concerned but didn't object.

""I don't want to—""

""Jackson,"" Clarisse cut him off, ""in a real fight, your opponent won't wait for you to be ready. They won't care about your feelings. Now hit me.""

Percy hesitated, then threw a half-hearted punch toward her shoulder. Clarisse didn't even bother blocking it.

""Pathetic,"" she said flatly. ""Again. Like you mean it.""

Percy frowned, irritation building. He tried again, putting slightly more force behind it. Clarisse easily deflected it with her forearm.

""You're holding back,"" she accused. ""Why?""

""Because I don't want to hit you!"" Percy exclaimed. ""This is stupid.""

Clarisse's eyes narrowed. ""What if I was trying to hurt your mom? Would you hit me then?""

Percy's expression darkened. ""Don't talk about my mom.""

""What would you do if someone threatened her? Stand there looking confused?"" Clarisse pressed, stepping closer. ""The world is dangerous, Jackson. Especially for people like us. And sometimes the monsters don't look like monsters until it's too late.""

From the couch, Sally made a small sound—almost a gasp. Percy glanced at her, noticing how pale she'd suddenly become.

""That's enough for today,"" Sally said firmly, standing up. ""Percy needs to start his homework.""

Clarisse looked like she wanted to argue but instead nodded respectfully to Sally. ""Same time tomorrow?""

""That would be fine,"" Sally agreed, her voice steadier than her expression.

As Clarisse gathered her equipment, Sally disappeared into the kitchen. Percy heard the water running—his mother's go-to activity when she was upset.

""What did you mean?"" Percy asked quietly. ""People like us?""

1qqm7ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1qqm7ks/aio_my_boyfriend_brings_his_dog_everywhere/,AIO My boyfriend brings his dog everywhere,"My (29F) boyfriend (30M) moved to the US a little over a year ago and initially, he did not have his dog with him. The dog lived with his family in a rural area. A few months into our relationship, he brought the dog to live with him in our big city. The dog is a yapper, which I initially chalked up to him being unadjusted to city life. However, after a year here, the dog still barks at everything. It’s constant. My boyfriend says it doesn’t bother him, but he’s aware it bothers other people so he will tell the dog to stop. But the dog continues barking and lunging at other dogs or random people until the “threat” leaves. 

We live in a city with lots of dogs and lots of parks and outdoor areas to take them. Now, I’m a dog person. I have a dog who I love very much. And at first, it was fun to do all these activities with our dogs all the time. That being said, I understand that not everyone wants to be around dogs all the time. Restaurants are one of those places. 

My boyfriend brings his dog EVERYWHERE. Every single date, he shows up with his dog. Even if it’s a nice restaurant with no outdoor seating. I tell him it’s not really considerate to bring dogs into a nice restaurant, and he says it’s okay because he’s a “service animal”. It’s not a service animal, and I tell him that. I say it makes me uncomfortable to abuse this loophole because I don’t want to ruin it for the people who actually need their dogs there. 

But then of course, there will be a few overly nice people who ask to pet the dog or say it’s cute and then he basically thinks he’s doing something nice for the public. I see the glares. I know a majority of the restaurant does not want the dog there. And don’t get me started on when it starts barking inside. It makes me cringe. He says he can’t leave the dog at home because the dog barks constantly when he’s there alone and his neighbors have complained multiple times. 

His dog also likes to sit in the passenger seat of the car. Accordingly, I have turned into a car seat for the dog. Every time we go on an adventure with the dogs (usually several times a week), my dog sits in the back and then I hold his 20 pound dog in my lap. This is partially my fault, because at first I didn’t really mind and so now this has become part of our routine. However, since we live in the Bay Area, lots of our adventures involve water. When we get in the car to leave, he will invite his wet dog to get on my lap. The first time he did this, I was appalled. He quickly apologized. Then he got a towel to put under the dog so that it could keep sitting on my lap. I think I was in shock at the absurdity of the situation and didn’t know what to say. Obviously, the towel can only do so much so my clothes still ended up getting wet and covered in fur, which I showed him afterwards and he just laughed it off. I’m not one to get all worked up over some wet clothes so I let it go. But the second time this happened, I was prepared. I said can’t the dog just sit in the back like mine? He says it’s too chaotic if the dog is in the back with my dog, and he’s scared it will get hurt. 

He also refuses to leave the dogs in the car together with the windows cracked if we need to make any sort of quick stop to get coffee, sandwiches, etc. so his dog will come inside with us while my dog stays in the car. Keep in mind, it never gets above 70 degrees here. The dogs are totally fine to be left for 10 minutes. I’ve noticed this confuses my dog since she’s very pack oriented and she will act clingy with me afterwards, like she feels left out. It makes me sad and feel like a bad owner, but I refuse to bring her inside and say she’s a service animal when she’s not. 

When we sleep at his apartment, the dog immediately jumps into bed with us and sleeps right at our thighs. It makes me uncomfortable to have a dog literally touching me while having sex. If I say something, he will move it a few inches over and then the dog comes right back. A few months ago, we were having sex and when he went down on me I started freaking out thinking it was the dog. It wasn’t, but it made me realize just how CONSTANTLY this dog is in my physical space. It’s such a turn off. 

I love my boyfriend. He treats me really well, better than anyone has before. I am a huge animal lover, and would so much rather have a man who loves his dog a little too much than not enough. But I feel like I’m going crazy. Am I overreacting? It’s making me not want to be around dogs at all, even my own dog (who I absolutely adore). Has anyone else been in a similar situation? If so, how did you handle it? ",4,1769723367.0,AmIOverreacting,11,1.0,False

Got some fun events planned for Seattle people who love pourovers!

https://luma.com/user/airworkscoffee

All the listings for these events are on the link above!

We're keeping up with the brew bar idea that we debuted last month. It went super well, so we are excited to continue it! It works pretty similarly to Substance in Paris if you've ever been there. You pay $5 (which gets taken out of your total bill) to reserve a slot to come by for brews. We make a new menu each day of coffees you can choose from, or we can do a flight of coffees. You don't need to stay the full 2 hours, and you can also bring laptops to work if needed! Sort of a hybrid between a standard cafe experience and one of our tastings.

We're going to be out of the pnw for a bit (with events in SF & Colorado), but will have more local things planned for march (and hopefully something in Portland, which I have promised before haha)


Feel free to ping me with any questions :) usually lurking on here lol. More active on IG/discord if you're on there. I also have a website where a bulk of my business is on.

Now, I’m not as worse off as others because I had tuition exchange thanks to my dad. I also have a single credit card, as I was told that was thing to do to build credit, I have a line of credit with PayPal that’s closed so I can just pay it off, I have a mortgage (I purchased a family members house to bail them out), and I have a used vehicle payment. 

I’m very aware I’m very lucky in my circumstances. I’m extremely lucky to have a reliable vehicle, afford food, and stable housing. 

This is the insane part…… according to my W2 for 2025 I made just over 95,000 last year. But I’m living paycheck to paycheck. 

Growing up I was always told a job in my income range was ideal and you would be able to live comfortably. What a lie. I shop at Aldi for groceries because they’re the cheapest in my area. I use/buy the local gas stations gas because it’s cheaper than the chains (only by a few cents but still). I don’t eat out. I don’t buy coffees. I literally pay my bills (strategically at that) and buy what I need to live on.

I feel so lied too. I’m not delusional, I knew life wasn’t going to be easy but it shouldn’t be this hard and I have a leg-up. With my salary range I should be able to breathe and have a god damn savings account. I hate this so much. I can’t enjoy or do anything because it all costs money. I love to draw and paint… art materials now are INSANE. I love to read, the free apps have dog shit books and all the others cost money. Even paperbacks now are like $15?! Let alone a hardcover?! Photography…. SD cards aren’t as cheap as they used to be and any editing software is RIDICULOUS. We’re supposed to work to live not live to work but none of us seem to have the money to live a life.

1qqm34n,https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowTreatmentIdeas/comments/1qqm34n/bonus_design_post/,BONUS DESIGN POST,"Layered Home Styling Blueprint: Bedroom & Living Room:

Step 1: Start with the Large Anchors (Foundation Pieces)
These are your biggest, most permanent items. They define the scale, layout, and main colors.

Bedroom:
Bed frame / headboard
Mattress
Dresser / wardrobe
Living Room:
Sofa / sectional
Armchairs / loveseat
Coffee table
Large storage pieces (media console, bookshelf)

Tip: Stick to neutral or flexible colors here if you plan to layer vibrant textiles later.

Step 2: Rugs & Floor Layers
Place large area rugs to define spaces.

Bedroom: under the bed, extending on all sides.
Living Room: under the seating area, anchoring the sofa and chairs.
Consider layering smaller rugs with texture or pattern for added depth.

Step 3: Window Treatments
Layered approach:
Sheer panels for light and airiness
Heavier curtains for privacy and insulation
Optional shades/blinds underneath for structure
Tip: Keep lengths and heights consistent to make the room feel intentional and cohesive.

Step 4: Lighting Layers

Ambient: Ceiling lights, chandeliers, or recessed lighting

Task: Bedside lamps, floor lamps, reading sconces

Accent: Table lamps, LED strips, or spotlighting art

Tip: Mix finishes and heights for visual interest and functional flexibility.

Step 5: Pillows, Throws, & Textiles

Mix textures, patterns, and sizes to add depth and comfort.
Bedroom: bed pillows, throws, maybe a bench cushion
Living Room: sofa pillows, chair cushions, throws over armrests

Step 6: Accessories & Art

Layer in smaller decor items once furniture and textiles are in place:
Artwork / mirrors
Plants
Decorative trays, vases, and books
Candles or personal collectibles

Tip: Use odd numbers (3, 5, 7) for groupings to feel visually balanced.

Step 7: Final Layer – Paint & Wall Color

Choose paint color last so it complements all furniture, rugs, and accents.
Test several swatches on the wall in different lighting before committing.
For a cohesive flow, coordinate bedroom and living room palettes without being too matchy.


Pro Tip: Think in heights, textures, and colors at each layer. Tall items first, low items later; mix rough + soft + shiny textures; start neutral and layer in your pops of color.",1,1769723080.0,WindowTreatmentIdeas,0,1.0,False

I Didn’t Publish What I Found.,"I interviewed him at a diner off the highway because it was close to his office and quiet in the afternoons. He ordered coffee and didn’t finish it. I recorded the conversation on my phone and took notes anyway.

He had studied the cave for years. He was careful to say studied, not explored. His work focused on mapping passages, logging dives, and reviewing incident reports. He no longer went into the cave himself.

I asked why.

“Risk profile changed,” he said. “Or maybe I just stopped ignoring it.”

The cave has a working name in the literature, but he asked me not to use it. I’ll call it Falcon's Roost. It’s a submerged system in west Texas, fed by a spring and capped by a narrow sinkhole. Entry requires technical cave diving. There is no direct ascent once inside.

He described the layout in practical terms. Long penetrations. No large chambers. Silt that stays suspended once disturbed. Navigation that depends entirely on guideline discipline.

I asked about depth.

“Depth matters less than distance,” he said. “You’re committed early.”

At one point he mentioned that the water temperature was higher than expected. Usually high seventies. Warmer than most caves in the region. 

“Does that change anything?” I asked.

“A little,” he said. “People work harder without realizing it. But it’s not the main issue.”

He said the main issue was planning assumptions. Models that looked fine on paper. Margins that disappeared when multiplied by time and task load. He talked about gas management failures, navigation errors, and missed decision points. None of it sounded dramatic.

I asked how many people had died there.

He said he didn’t keep a count. He tracked incidents, not outcomes.

“What stays consistent,” he said, “is that everyone thinks they understand the cave after the first successful dive.”

He showed me notes from previous surveys. Numbers. Short comments. Equipment serials. One page listed instruments that stopped reporting mid-dive. No conclusions were written next to them.

When I asked why he agreed to the interview, he said he was tired of seeing the cave described as mysterious or extreme.

“It isn’t,” he said. “It’s just a system with no margin.”

That night, when I started writing, I tried to summarize what he had told me. I wrote a sentence, then deleted it. I wrote another and removed that too.

Eventually I settled on something accurate enough to keep.

\*\*\*

I spoke to her over a video call because she lived too far away to meet in person. She said the distance was one of the reasons she never tried to see the cave herself. She worked a regular job, did weekend dives when she could, and followed exploration projects online. She described herself as an enthusiast. She corrected herself and said hobbyist instead.

She had heard about the cave years ago through forums and shared maps. She knew the basic outline. Submerged. Long penetrations. Limited exits. She said it was the kind of place people argued about without ever going there.

“I looked into it,” she said. “Training, travel, logistics. It was never realistic.”

She listed the reasons without prompting. The cost. The certifications. The time off work. The fact that the cave was in a part of the country she had never been to and didn’t have a reason to visit otherwise.

She paused, then added that she followed the dives closely anyway. Read reports. Watched footage when it was shared. She said she liked understanding systems, even ones she wouldn’t enter.

I asked how she knew about the fatality.

She nodded once, like she had expected the question.

“A friend of mine went in,” she said. “Not recently. But that cave.”

She didn’t give her friend’s name. She said they had trained together years earlier. Recreational at first, then more technical. She stayed at the level she was comfortable with. Her friend didn’t.

“She was better than me,” she said. “More committed.”

I asked what she meant by committed.

“She rearranged her life around diving,” she said. “I didn’t.”

There was a delay in the audio. She waited for it to catch up.

“Is this why you’re calling?” she asked. “Because of what happened?”

I asked her what she had heard.

She said she never blamed the cave. She never blamed her friend either. She said there were always explanations, even if they weren’t satisfying.

“I stopped following it closely after that,” she said. “Still read things. Just not the comments.”

I thanked her for talking with me. She said it was fine. Then she added that she hoped I wasn’t trying to turn it into something it wasn’t.

“It’s just a place,” she said. “Most of us only ever know it from a distance.”

She added one other thing, almost as an aside.

Her friend had never been especially strong. Not weak, exactly, but careful about her limits. She had been born early and had grown up paying attention to how her body responded to stress. It was something she mentioned occasionally, usually in practical terms.

“She planned around it,” she said. “Rest days. Conservative margins.”

I asked if that had changed before the dive.

She thought about it.

“Not openly.” she said. 

She said it wasn’t framed as pushing past anything. More like it had stopped being part of the calculation.

“At the time,” she said, “that felt like confidence.”

\*\*\*

I met with my editor in her office late in the afternoon. She had the door open and her screen tilted so I could see it from the chair across her desk. She didn’t ask how the interviews went. She scrolled as I talked.

When I finished, she nodded once.

“This isn’t landing,” she said.

I asked what she meant.

“It’s accurate,” she said. “But it doesn’t match what people think this story is.”

She said the coverage so far had set expectations. Images. Language. A certain tone. What I had was procedural. She said that wasn’t a problem on its own, but it didn’t explain why anyone should keep reading.

“There’s no hook,” she said. “No escalation.”

I said I wanted to talk to more people. Not experts. People who had followed the cave over time. People who had opinions without access.

She shook her head.

“That’s not where this goes,” she said. “You’ll get the same answers phrased differently.”

She leaned back.

“If you want the next step,” she said, “you talk to the families.”

I didn’t respond right away.

“The relatives,” she continued. “The ones closest to what just happened.”

I said I wasn’t sure they would talk to me.

“They will.” she said. 

I told her I thought it was too soon.

She looked at me for a moment, then back at the screen.

“Soon is the window,” she said. “After that, it’s background.”

She said the piece needed something current. Something no one else had yet. She said otherwise it would read like context without a center.

I said I wanted to keep working the way I had been.

She said I could, but it wouldn’t change the outcome.

“Go talk to them,” she said. “If it doesn’t go anywhere, we reassess.”

I nodded, though I didn’t agree.

I met him in a coffee shop near the freeway because he suggested it and said parking was easy. He arrived early and had already ordered. He asked, before sitting down, how this worked.

“Are you paying for this?” he said.

I told him I could reimburse him for his time.

He nodded. “Good. I’ve got things to do.”

He said he was the brother. He didn’t specify older or younger. He didn’t say his brother’s name unless I asked, and when he did, he said it quickly, like it wasn’t important to repeat.

“I never got that stuff,” he said. “The cave thing. It was always strange to me.”

He described his brother as mostly quiet. Kept to himself. Had a regular job for a while, then another. The kind of person people didn’t worry about because nothing ever seemed obviously wrong.

“He wasn’t dramatic,” he said. “Didn’t cause trouble.”

I asked how long his brother had been involved.

“A few years,” he said. “Long enough that it just became normal.”

He tapped his phone on the table and checked it when it buzzed. He didn’t look upset. He looked distracted.

“You’re not asking about what happened,” he said.

I told him I was trying to understand who his brother was.

“That’s fine,” he said. “But that’s not what people care about.”

I asked what he meant.

He leaned forward slightly.

“You know,” he said. “How they found him.”

I didn’t respond.

“They leave that part out,” he said. “But it’s why people are watching.”

I asked what he wanted me to understand about his brother.

He shrugged. “That he chose it.”

I asked why he thought that.

“Because nobody made him go,” he said. “And now everyone else has to deal with it.”

When I told him I needed to wrap up, he looked irritated.

“So that’s it?” he said.

I took out my phone and sent him the money we had agreed on. He watched the screen until the confirmation came through.

“If you need more,” he said, “I can get you details.”

I told him I planned to speak with other members of the family.

“That’s fine,” he said. “They’ll tell you different versions.”

I stood and gathered my notes. As I was about to leave, he added something, like it had just occurred to him.

“He was born early,” he said. “C-section.”

I turned back.

“Our mom didn’t survive it,” he said. “Complications.”

He said it plainly.

“After that,” he continued, “people didn’t really know what to do with him.”

He looked down at his phone again.

“He was always tied to it,” he said. “Even if nobody said it out loud.”

I left before he could add anything else.

\*\*\*

I was in a hotel room off the interstate with the curtains half closed and the lights on even though it was still early. The desk was too small, so I spread everything out on the bed. Notes. Transcripts. Time stamps. Names.

I opened my laptop and checked the coverage. Most of it was already published. Short pieces. Updates folded into larger feeds. The language was consistent across outlets, even where the facts weren’t. There wasn’t much left that felt unclaimed. Tis the age of AI journalism. 

I wrote a brief email to my editor. I kept it factual.

I said the reporting wasn’t producing anything unexpected. I said the angles we were considering were already circulating. I said we were behind on timing and the story had settled faster than anticipated.

I didn’t mention the interviews in detail. I didn’t say how long they had taken.

I sent it and closed the laptop.

I went back to the notes and tried grouping them differently. By role. By proximity. By tone. The result was the same. Context without momentum.

I checked my phone. No response yet.

I didn’t write it down as a conclusion. I didn’t write it down at all.



It showed up only when I stopped sorting by role and started sorting by background details. Things people mentioned in passing. Things that didn’t seem relevant when they were said.

Birth stories came up more often than I expected. Not framed as medical history. Just facts that had been repeated long enough to feel ordinary.

Premature, emergency delivery, c-section.

It wasn’t in every interview, but it was in enough of them to register. Always secondary. Always offered as context for something else. A reason someone was cautious. Or small. Or monitored more closely growing up.

None of them had been born vaginally. None of them had gone through labor. All of them had arrived early, removed rather than delivered.

I checked the names again to make sure I wasn’t forcing the pattern. I wasn’t. The information was already there. I had just ignored it.

There was no way to frame it responsibly. No mechanism I could point to. No expert I could quote without sounding like I was fishing for meaning where there wasn’t any.

Even if it was true, it would read like speculation. 

I closed the folder and left that set of notes untouched.

I went back to the first interview. 

He had drawn while we talked. Not to explain anything in particular. Just filling space in the margins of my notebook. I hadn’t paid much attention at the time.

It was a rough sketch of the cave system. Notes written sideways where he’d run out of room. The main passages narrowed toward one end.

At the far edge of the drawing, the lines curved inward. The walls thickened. The opening reduced to a single constriction, wider on one side than the other, then tapering again.

He hadn’t labeled it. There was no arrow or comment explaining what it represented.

I stared at it.



The shape was familiar in a way that had nothing to do with caves.

I closed the notebook and put it back in my bag.

It all started 3 years ago, it was a high school trip in switzerland. I didn't really know her but at first sight I crushed on her, but at that time I wasn't even thinking about even trying to talk to her.

A year later, December 2024, I finally decided talking to her, even though we never did before, and we weren't in the same class a single time. 
But it turned out pretty well. We started talking often in DMs, not alot IRL because of the difference of schedules. I finally asked her if she'd like to grab a coffee with me. She said yes, but it never happened. She said she planned something with her friends the day I asked her for the coffee. But she told me IRL and she came to me to tell me about it, and it can happen to anyone. So I wasn't really worried about it and she told me that if i'm still up for it I could send her a message to plan for the next time. Which I did.

It was during the holidays, I asked her again, she told me it was all good. And when the time to go came, she told me she forgot it was her brother's birthday, I don't even know if she has a brother to be honestly. But I was kinda outraged by her message.

But love is love, and love makes you blind, I still had a little bit of hope, so during another high school trip I sent her messages, she ghosted me.

The worst part is that I found out she got back with her ex after all that, which would explain the ghosting i guess.

I tried to forget about her because this story just made me feel bad about myself, my looks etc in addition with other crushes that didn't end up in the best ways to say the least.

But the thing is, a few days ago, one of her friends learned about my crush on her by another friend of her. They both told me that she's kinda dumb when it comes to this kind of stuff, and that I should definitely try again.

I initially applied for a SSV role and in my entrance interview with the SM and DM our SM recommended I start as a barista and have a conversation with her 3 months in if I were still interested. 

I joined Starbucks because of the benefits, culture in the specific coffee shop, and the proximity to my house. (I can literally walk to work) 

In my time I’ve really analyzed what it is SSV actually do, and if I’m honest, it’s not hard. If I’m brutally honest, I’m positive i could do the SM’s role fairly easily too. (I say this as someone with 7 years experience running restaurants in senior roles. Even our DM said I was overqualified for a barista role, and told me she was excited for my growth in the company.)

I’m now being told it will take over 6 months before I’m even considered. Not by Starbucks, but by her own evaluation. Mind you, all the current SSV that I work with are at my back and think I’d be a great fit. 

This is frustrating because in my interview it was clear what my intentions were, and that long term the entry level pay wouldn’t work for me or my family.

I (40M) have been on 1.5 dates with a woman (39F) that I am really digging. I say “.5” because the second was a long event where I ended up meeting a bunch of her friends. When she introduced me she told them we met on a dating app. Because the friends were there I kept it friendly and also spent time getting to know them as well. Nothing worse than the new guy who’s dating your friend that is just fawning over them the whole time.

On the first date she told me she has never been in a relationship before. Because of this I want to do my absolute best to make sure she's comfortable and take things slow but also send the signal that I’m into her. I’ve been in relationships before but I really suck at flirting in the early stages.

We went to school together and she was one of the only friends I have ever made, to this day. I struggle a lot with autism/low self esteem so making friends has always been extremely difficult for me.   
she had cancer and I remember the panic of potentially losing her, the heart break, the despair. She survived, thankfully, but it really brought us closer together.   
it’s important to note that she had a best friend that wasnt me. And me and her other best friend weren’t friends.   
When I got married, she was essential to the wedding. She planned, coordinated, she was my maid of honor and she signed my marriage license. When I had my son, we asked her to be his godmother. She was an integral part of my family.   
In 2022, I moved from Oregon to Texas. My husband, son and I were isolated from any family, friends, or support. We lived 2+ hours from my husbands new job so he would spend multiple nights in his car at work and not come home, while I was alone with my collicky 8 month old. I was drowning. And I made a huge mistake that started the downfall of my best friend and I.   
My mother had a cancer scare and I had to take care of her for a while. This happened to coincide with my best friends wedding. I couldnt fly in to be there because my mom needed round the clock care (they had moved to Texas by then to be with us, albeit 2 hours away) and so I didn’t make it.   
She was (justifiably) very upset. But we seemed to move past it. Fast forward to January 2023.   
her and her husband were coming to Texas only 45 minutes away from us. I asked her to meet me somewhere for coffee. She said she would but later cancelled. I was upset by this and so I said something like “have a nice life” (I know-toxic. I regret it every day) and she ghosted me. I have had 1 point of contact with her since then. In an email last year,  I told her how much I miss her and that there’s so many things every day that remind me of her.

But no i acted like frozen dipshit

I’m frustrated with myself and I need to get this off my chest.I know myself i can be empathic but i just froze ppl terling me i look nice awsome,everyone should be like me.confidant but i ruined everything my anxiety ruined

I’m not really a “guy of affection,” and there was a girl I liked a lot. She seemed to think I was just “nice” and I acted nonchalant, partly because I didn’t know how to show her intimacy and care without coming across as needy. I think it was also a confidence issue.

Now, I realize I basically friendzoned her. I feel terrible because I could have taken action, but I didn’t. I thought I could show her my empathetic side in other ways, but I never really expressed it directly.When I tried to act playfull Yi emded up mean.

I just keep thinking: I could have done this differently. I could have been confident while showing I cared. Instead, I stayed in my head and lost the chance.

Has anyone else struggled with showing care without feeling needy? How do you balance empathy and confidence when pursuing someone you like?

1qqln09,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/1qqln09/i_beat_my_addiction_to_gaming_and_you_can_to/,"I beat my addiction to gaming, and you can to","Hey everyone, I am 24 (M) and I would like to share my experience here along with some important thoughts that I've had over the years. Maybe my experience will help someone, or at least make someone re-evaluate their choices, in regard to this specific addiction.  
This will be a long reading, but worth it.  
Also, at some point I will use the term “Loser,” but not to put anyone down. I do not write this to hurt anyone's feelings, nor do I want to.

I've been a silent observer in r/StopGaming for a long time now, and I have seen many posts about people trying to quit or thinking of quitting. I found this place through my own personal experience, when suspicions arose that my “favourite” hobby is not what it seems to be.  
It was a tough pill to swallow, but gaming is no more than a “shy” drug, like alcohol, social media, porn, etc. Unfortunately, it is also seen as a hobby, and people tend to take pride in this habit, making it a part of their personality.

I started with Crash Bandicoot Warped back when I was 5 years old, at my friend's house. We were messing around like little kids, and then I remember vividly him asking me, “Hey, wanna play Crash?” I remember agreeing without having any idea what he meant. Apparently, his parents had a PS1. He gave me the controller, and so it began. That was in 2006. An addiction of 15 years began.

One of the best things about the posts in this subreddit is when people write about how they began their journey into gaming, and it's always a foggy distinction between what is normal and healthy and how it is borderline a scam. If you think about it, it's very common sense that a little kid would instantly fall in love with gaming, their little brain getting good stimuli from the digital feats and achievements performed by a small controller with a few buttons, or a usual keyboard, or a console the size of your hands with its own screen.  
That “love” is the push to the domino effect, leading to hidden damage though, right? Of course I got my own consoles throughout the years. Of course I got into the classic Nintendo titles, and Minecraft, and CoD, and surprise surprise, got borderline addicted to League of Legends :)

A child is doing normal child stuff throughout their childhood: school, studying, playing with other children in sports, parks, visiting each other's houses, school trips, socializing, etc. However, once you remove proper social flourishing, you get a kid that likes to play video games in their free time, but slowly but surely, their brain starts to crave that stimulation outside of gaming time.  
Then studying for school becomes insanely boring. Your parents think you have a problem, like dyslexia or ADHD or something. Sports and books aren't stimulating the brain anymore, so what do you do? You continue to spend even more time and money on your favourite “hobby.” You see what I'm getting at? It's a domino effect that starts in stealth mode, so not even the adults can pinpoint it.

Your social skills fall back, so you hang out only with people who are like you: socially underexperienced gamers. Now social anxiety will start to creep in because of the lack of proper social exposure and thinking. Yes, even thinking.  
Another problem that tends to get overlooked when discussing the downsides of gaming is the fact that the stimuli your brain craves stops you from properly thinking in your everyday life, and you mostly think about what will stimulate you: gaming, or anime, or even music sometimes. So you slowly also become less mature for your age.

The frontal cortex will keep developing regardless of what you do, but what do you do with it when, for most of your years, you skipped thinking about substantial things that would, you know, make you mature and grow as a person?  
A friend of mine currently studying psychology told me in a conversation about this topic that a person stops maturing at the age they start playing, because then that is what they only think about. It sounds extreme, but when you stop and think about it, it does make some sense.

So, how did I beat this type of addiction?

1. **Acknowledge the problem.** You will never progress through this unless you admit it to yourself, most of all. Don't be one of those people taking pride in this so-called “hobby.” I realised that gaming is not healthy whatsoever, perhaps not even in smaller usage. I was 19 in quarantine, and thanks to that forced solitude, I was forced to think—because how much stimuli can someone take in one day? I had important revelations during that time. First of all, I was skinny, with thick glasses and messy hair, ugly facial hair, acne, and holy molly, I had become a stereotype. Literally, you can tell when someone is a gamer straight up by specific characteristics in their looks. Without wanting to offend anyone, it's the truth. I had to mention how this addiction affects one's looks too—that's reality, no matter how stereotypical it may seem.
2. **Research a bit.** Once you acknowledge the problem, you should search about it: YouTube videos, Reddit like StopGaming, other forums, articles on Google, etc., because it's going to shape the picture clearly. It will no longer be something you know but refuse to tackle. Besides the gamers who take pride in this, there are many other people who hate-play. Most of the time these are competitive game players, but it can happen while playing any game. Believe me, once you wake up and you hop on to play literally a max of one hour of even your comfort game, you'll be like, “What the heck am I doing right now...”
3. **No more competitive games.** These are the most addicting ones and will make you hate yourself even more. Yes, we want to stop gaming in general, but it is impossible to cut something out all at once. You may last for one or two weeks, but then you will crave everything even more. Delete all your accounts in competitive games and switch to single-player games for now. It'll take some time, perhaps a month, perhaps a little more, to tone down the urge to play online. Single-player games will make this easier. If your gamer friends question you, do not tell them what you are doing, because no matter how good people they may be, they will try to pull you back. So you will be saying farewell to group sessions as well.
4. **Play normal-sized story games.** I am talking about the ones that take between 6–12 hours to complete. After step 3—meaning after like 40 or so days—you will have to cut out single-player games that take many hours to complete. They can be as addicting as online ones as well. My friend once spent 70 hours in Assassin's Creed Odyssey. This is not a troll step; please look at the ceiling and think about it. Now you will be indulging only in story games that have a normal length to beat. Another month or so.
5. **Switching loser types.** As I said, it's impossible to cut something out all at once, especially after you've been doing it for more than a decade. With step 4, you will be having time gaps in your days—more free time that will make you bored—because your brain will crave dopamine shots due to what you've done to it through the years. You won't be in the mood to keep playing story games all day long, and that is good. You can do other loser habits. Lie down on your bed and watch reels on Instagram. I am dead serious. Open YouTube, watch whatever your usual creators uploaded. Another thing I want you to think about is the fact that it's in your best interest to be a different type of loser than a nerd/geek loser. I know dudes who watch anime all day long, or who play PUBG all day long. If you are going to be a loser, at least stimulate your brain with reels. IG reels will not give you fake feelings of accomplishment. Alcohol can be used to socialise outside and generate some nice cringe memories with people to have. At least being lazy and looking at the ceiling listening to music will not nearly stimulate the brain as gaming. Although I believe gaming addicts should also try to decrease listening to music as well.
6. **It is time to get rid of everything related to games.** Sell or give away your consoles along with the games and controllers. Delete all games, Steam, and whatever other gaming-related thing exists on your PC or laptop. So it'll probably be something like three months after you started from step 1. We now have fixing to do. Get rid of your headphones; just buy a small Bluetooth speaker to listen to music. Incorporate meditation daily—basically you sit down, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. This will tackle your dopamine-shot craving and the shy-ADHD you have developed from excess gaming stimuli throughout the years. This will make things like studying easier and even help you feel present again. You should see r/DopamineDetoxing as well; it's a must for people like us.
7. **Do other cool stuff.** Without gaming in your life, a void will appear—but it doesn't have to. Get in your car, go for night drives every night, get that night city feeling along with a canned coffee and low-volume white-girl music playing on your car's radio :P Read novels. Reading fantasy books is also a great way to get used to reading books and then advance to topic books as well! Reading is also, like, the best and healthiest time-wasting you can do. Go for a walk. Sit down and think—about your family, your loved ones, your psyche, your career. Think about stuff. You've wasted lots and lots of hours thinking about useless bullshit; start thinking about substantial things. As I said, things like studying and work performance will begin to improve by now. Tidying your room, going for a run, studying for college or school, focusing on more mundane actual hobbies like painting or learning an instrument will get much easier and enjoyable. You'll realise how much money you've been spending on games as well :)
8. **Accept the past.** This is important, because after-gaming clarity will hit you like a truck. You'll notice the social gaps you have due to missing normal social flourishing in your formative years. You'll notice you struggle at various other things, and every time you are down, you'll remember that the only point of reference in your past is, well, gaming. It's okay to feel angry. Never beat yourself up. Regardless of your age, what matters is now and how you will choose to spend your time from now on. You may notice other issues you have suppressed throughout all this time. It's okay. You'll work through this.

So I intentionally left out half of my journey at the beginning of this post. I wanted to write this after I wrote the steps. From 20 to 24, these were four interesting years. I made new friends, lost old ones. I got into multiple debates with my gamer group of friends about gaming and whether it is healthy or not. I made great progress in the gym, fixed my clothing style, worked on my confidence, and had some nice experiences with a few beautiful girls (finally!).

I got into the hospitality industry and got a diploma from a junior college. It was the easy choice since I was trash academically in school—why would I do something challenging and low-gratification like studying when I could boot up a game and play for hours, right? :'(  
But I fell in love with this industry. I got another diploma in hospitality, a few other important certifications, and I am currently hard-studying for entrance exams at a great university to get my Bachelor's, learning a new language, and will also go to another junior college in the near future to get a diploma in economics as well. Besides education, I have four years working in 4–5 star hotels. I've climbed to a position just before entering management, saved some money, got my own car, and I see myself reaching management in one or two years. Yay!  
Finally, I feel like a proper young adult with prospects :P

I know it sounds cliché—“quitting games and having your life change”—but it is 100% possible. I relapsed a few times throughout my journey. Thank God it was always hate-playing, so it was easier to stop each time. People who take pride in gaming will definitely have a tougher time stopping for good, but this does not mean it is not possible. Think about it: I started in 2006 and went on until 2020, and after that I still played for hours because I could not leave League of Legends with friends -\_- But I did it.

Now I like to go out for a drink on Fridays and Saturdays, and dinners in restaurants as well. Yes, like a normal human being—going out and socialising. I promise you, life is amazing, and you are missing out on it for what? For controlling pixels, sitting still in front of a screen for multiple hours at a time? Come onnnn.

Thank you for reading this, if anyone reached the end of this post. Good luck on improving your life <3",1,1769722059.0,StopGaming,0,0.67,False

CONS

* Upon arrival you go down a dead end street with super limited parking for drop off.
* At the time of me checking in there was self service kiosks but required manual intervention.  To ask the general questions and ID check so not sure the reason.
* My initial interaction with Host was to ask location of parking and was told no onsite parking.  Yea I don't care but let me know location?  I am for first time in Australia driving on the other side of the road and they can be bothered to give me simple directions.  I know the website said Wilson street but a Drive here and here and you have to go
* Next issue was no bottles of water.  Instead you get a glass carafe in your room to fill.  My issue with this is I am accustomed to taking 2 bottles of water with me while working and staying hydrated during the day.
* The Restaurant/bar is closed Sunday/Monday - not notated online again would have probably booked Regency.
* A/C didnt work.  I thought maybe they used a different type of AC system, It is winter in Chicago and keep the house between 61-68 so 75 in a room right now is a sauna.  When I checked out they told me it didn't work.  It is summer fortunately it was only 75-80 degrees when I was onsite.
* I had free breakfast I am not Globalist so maybe I paid that rate.  Either way it was like Fort Knox to get the free Breakfast.  Like doubted me the first day.  2nd day the guy rememebered me so no issue.
* No ice machine but this appears just to be an Australia thing.
* Lobby is to small for the space it is like 12 x20 and all this is jammed in.
   * 2 self service kiosks
   * 2 elevators
   * Coffee/snack bar
   * Random lockers
   * 2 hosts with computers
   * Weird entrance to stairs
   * Handicap lift thing

PRO's

* Breakfast was Great.
* Room was a room

So if/when I go back to Australia in a year probably 0% I stay there again.  If it was a city I frequented in the US I would still skip over other hotels.",1,1769721833.0,hyatt,5,0.67,False

1qqlhpf,https://v.redd.it/686ga3v9vcgg1,JFK Jr.’s Friendship with Mike Tyson.,"On March 11, 1999, John paid a visit to Mike Tyson in a Maryland prison. Initially, many assumed the visit was related to George magazine, where Kennedy was editor. But he quickly cleared up the mystery, simply stating: “I’m his friend.” Tyson was in jail following an altercation on the road.

“Mike is a much different man than his public image would suggest,” Kennedy said. “He’s a victim of terrible misjudgment and misunderstanding. I hope people might start to believe it, because he’s had a difficult life.” A friend close to Kennedy explained: “John has got to know Mike in a different light. He went to the prison to show support for him. John has a great amount of empathy for the underdog. John is very sensitive to the idea that the public impression of a celebrity can be really at odds with the real man.”

The two met a little over a year ago, when Kennedy assigned author John Edgar Wideman to write a story about Tyson's boxing comeback struggle, and Tyson visited Kennedy at George's Manhattan offices. The article was never published, but a friendship between the boxer and editor blossomed, with Kennedy getting to know Tyson's physician-wife, Monica, and their children.

In his memoir Undisputed Truth, Mike Tyson recalls:

“John and I were friends from New York. I met him on the street one day and he invited me up to see him at his George magazine office. He was such a beautitul, down-to-earth cat, riding his bike around Manhattan, taking public transportation sometimes. The first thing he told me when he came to see me was, ""My whole family told me not to come to see you. So when you see them and they're all saying 'Hi' to you, you get the picture.""

We talked about my case a little bit. “Look, I know that the only reason you're in here is because you're black,"" he told me. He was letting me know that he knew what time it was. At one point, I just flat out said to him, ""You know you've got to run for political office.""

""What?"" He seemed a little taken aback. ""Do you think so?""

""You'd be letting my mother down, my mother's people down. They saw you under that desk. You can't let a lost generation that believed so much in your family down. Not me, f\*\*k me, I'm going to do what I do, but you can't let those people down. Your father and your uncle were their hope and you're the bloodline to that hope,"" I said.

He didn't say anything. Maybe he thought I was crazy. “No, you've got to do this sh\*t. Are you crazy? What's the purpose of you even living? That's what you were born to do. People's dreams are riding on you, man. That's a heavy burden but you shouldn't have had that mother and father you did.""

He looked tired that night. He told me he had to get some coffee because he was going to fly back to New York that night. He had flown down with his flight instructor. “No, man. Go over to the house. Stay with Monica and the kids,"" I told him. ""You're crazy to fly that plane anyway.""

""You don't know how I feel up there, man. I feel so free,"" he told me. He went to see Monica that night and she told me that he said, ""Well, Mike said I was stupid for flying my plane. He's the one who got in the motorcycle accident.""

We also talked about hanging out when I got out of jail. He was talking about other women and I got a sense that he was going through a lot with his wife. “When you get out, give me a little time to handle some stuff with my wife. Then you and I have got to hang. You need to come with me to Aspen.""

1qqledz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qqledz,"Heavy haul – varsity jackets, patchwork pants, and side-button tracks. Which one you picking?","1. Beats x Kim Kardashian Studio Pro (Dune/Earth)
A solid tech accessory if you're into that tonal, minimalist look. The color is ""Dune,"" and it actually looks better in person than in the renders—very low-key and high-end. Sound-wise, they’re standard Studio Pros (heavy bass, decent ANC), but you’re really buying these for the Kim K aesthetic.Great for the ""clean girl/boy"" desk setup.

Score: 8/10

2. Chrome Hearts Patchwork Varsity Jacket (Black/Black)
This is a heavy hitter. The all-black leather sleeves and the cross patches give it a very dark, avant-garde vibe. However, objectively speaking, it’s a lot of branding. If you aren't careful, the sheer number of patches can look a bit ""busy"" or over-the-top for a casual fit. Quality feels substantial, though.Hard to pull off without looking like you’re trying too hard, but high quality.

Score: 7.5/10

3. Chrome Hearts x Matty Boy (?) Red/White Varsity
This is easily my favorite piece of the entire haul. The red is incredibly vibrant, and the contrast with the cream/white sleeves is just classic. It has that vintage collegiate energy but with the luxury edge. It pops way more than the all-black version and feels like a genuine statement piece rather than just another ""hype"" item.Absolute grail. The colorway is 10/10.

Score: 9.5/10

4. Nike x Brazil CBF GORE-TEX Jacket (Mint)
This is a very specific vibe. The mint green color is refreshing, and the sponsor logos (Vivo, Itau) give it that authentic training-kit feel. It’s practical because of the GORE-TEX, but the color might be a bit difficult to style with anything other than black or neutral tech-wear.Great for rainy days or pitch-side, but a bit niche for daily wear.

Score: 7/10

5. Polo Ralph Lauren Harrington Jacket (Tan)
The ""Old Money"" essential. Compared to the Chrome Hearts stuff, this is incredibly plain, but that’s the point. The fit is boxy and classic. My only gripe is that it can look a bit ""dad-ish"" if the rest of your outfit isn't tailored well. It's a safe, reliable mid-layer.Timeless, but lacks the ""wow"" factor of the other pieces.

Score: 8/10 (for utility)

6 & 7. Chrome Hearts Hoodies (White/Black)
Standard fare here. The white one is a clean pullover with the horseshoe logo, while the black zip-up has the thermal-style floral/cross sleeve print. Honestly? They’re hoodies. They look cool, but they’re definitely ""uniform"" pieces for the brand. The white one is going to be a nightmare to keep clean.Essential for the rotation, but nothing revolutionary.

Score: 7.5/10

8. Chrome Hearts Cross Patch Chinos (Khaki)
I wanted to like these more, but the patch placement feels a little random. The khaki color is a nice break from the usual black denim, but the patches make them hard to wear to anything even slightly formal. They are definitely more of a ""streetwear"" take on a classic trouser.Cool detail, but limited versatility.

Score: 6.5/10

9. Chrome Hearts Side-Button Track Pants (White)
These are definitely a ""statement"" bottom. The silver button detailing down the side is a nice touch, and the triple cross embroidery on the thigh is classic CH. However, all-white track pants are a massive risk—one coffee spill and it’s over. They lean very heavily into that luxury-leisure aesthetic, which can look a bit ""pajama-like"" if not styled with the right shoes.High-risk, high-reward. Great for a summer flex, but be careful where you sit.

Score: 7/10

10 & 11. Ralph Lauren ""Polo Bear"" Sweaters (White & Navy)
You can’t go wrong with these. The Polo Bear is a streetwear icon in its own right. The white one with the flag sweater bear is super clean, while the navy one has that classic varsity/collegiate bear. Objectively, these are the most ""wearable"" items in the whole haul. They fit perfectly into a ""Quiet Luxury"" or ""Ivy"" look.Absolute staples. They’ll never go out of style.

Score: 8.5/10

12. Fox Racing Motocross Jersey (Teal/Black)
This one feels a bit left-field compared to the Chrome Hearts and Polo pieces. The ""Motocore"" trend is still a thing, and the teal/black color blocking is bold. It’s a very lightweight, mesh-style material—great for breathability. Honestly, it feels a bit like a costume unless you’re actually riding or going for a very specific Y2K tech-wear look.A bit niche. Cool for a specific fit, but lacks the versatility of the other pieces.

1qql8sl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qql8sl/drunk_men_dirty_socks_weed_pee_whats_next/,"Drunk Men, Dirty Socks, Weed, Pee, What's Next?","I, 19 F, live on campus in a college all gendered suite-style dorm. This means there are three rooms, each with two people, who share a single living room, and bathroom. In one room there is Kaitlyn and I, in the middle room by the bathroom is Nova and Taylor, and in the farthest room snuggled next to Nova and Taylor is Alex and Ayaana. I had one conversation with Kaitlyn before joining the room, while Nova and Taylor already knew each other as they shared a room the previous year. Alex and Ayaana did not know each other at all. Katie, Lex, and I became great friends the previous semester, and got along quite well with Ayaana. Ayaana is very neat and tidy, but is usually out of the dorm majority of the time. I only see her in the morning before class, and coming back before going to bed.

Issue 1, Weed: The four of us started having problems with Nova and Taylor even on move in day. They had moved in a week before us, and when we arrived the place smelled horribly of weed. It was causing me some breathing problems as I have asthma, but the first few weeks of student life had me out enjoying the last of the summer anyway. I had three failed attempts at trying to organize a roommate meeting, as Nova and Taylor never responded to any of them. At the time I was unsure of where the smell was coming from, so I just wanted to tackle it as a whole. On September 5th the suite/room started to smell heavily of weed again, but they were not in their room. It was bad enough that Katie and I couldn't be in our own room, so we went to one of our friends suites for the meantime. I contacted one of the RA's about the issue in part to have this documented, and I was unsure what to do. They checked out the room, but since they were absent, there was nothing to be done. On September 12th I came back from class and did not even get to the top stair down the hall before it became an issue. I, being the forced extrovert of the group, was contacted by the suite across the hall, adjacent to us, and below us to contact someone in charge to address the issue. The RA told me to call a number, but like last time, they were no present in the suite. It had been established at this point the smell was coming from their room. On October 1st it had the added benefit of attempting to cover the smell up with febreeze and incense. This time they were present in the room, but I was not there to witness as I was contacted by three of my adopted introverts to make the call. This is all still while I was attempting to have a suitemate meeting and text issues in our shared group chat. In addition to talking with them about this one on one. November 16th another call was reported, and another complaint from a separate room. This one finally came with a response from Taylor. ""Hey --- are you free tomorrow night to talk about the smell reports?"" I respond yes. At the agreed meet up time I am sitting in the living room with Alex, Katie, and another friend we will call William. Taylor asks if we can speak privately in the hall, and I agree. We go sit down, and I will give you the summed up version of the conversation. She stated that she had been receiving a lot of reports about her both this year, and last year, and wished to address the issue. She stated her father had cancer and uses marijuana to deal with it, as well as her old room back at home being taken over by a heavy marijuana user, so when she comes home from weekend trips, her clothes smell like that. In addition she stated Nova often brought friends over that may partake in it as well, but they were not doing it in the dorm, and she had never done it at all. I had restated my breathing issues, and that I had gone to the Hospital for respiratory issues on the 13th of that month. As well as having visited the doctor, and being sick for weeks, already six times that semester. In addition I bought an air purifier (which was not cheap), to help deal with the air in general, and the weed. I also stated that I attended highschool in an extremely rural town where even the teachers openly smoked, and had friends who grew weed in their basement. That I, did not in fact believe that it is residual on her clothes, or simply individuals walking into the suite. While I don't have a problem with anyone who partakes in marijuana, it was greatly affecting my health, and there are other options than smoking it. It is legal in my state, so many suggested they simply walk five minutes until they are off campus, but they are underage, so they could be arrested. I hoped her father was doing well, but the conversation didn't amount to much of anything, other than us complaining about our ex's. After that, there were not many new issues until January 28th where the bathroom and hallway smelled like weed and Alex stated that she was in one of the stalls while two people were in the shower and she heard something about a lighter. This even has not been reported as of yet. Nova and Taylor have been sent to a few different meetings, but I am unsure of what those are covering, Taylor only stated she could receive academic punishment. 

Issue 2, Men (Normally Drunk): Nova brings a lot of friends into the suite. They are all normally drunk or high, very loud, and always at three in the morning any day of the week. Alex, Katie, Ayaana, and I have all complained about this and often lose sleep to their cackling, screaming, and music. There have also been complaints from the room below us. It is the worst for Ayaana as her bed is next to the vent which is connected to their room, and there is no other spot to move it to. We have knocked on their door time and time again to please be quiet, and they go on until about 4 am. They also sleep in the living room, which is fine because it means they're safe and not doing other things, but they'll often use and ask to borrow sheets and blankets, and won't wash them afterwards, and they smell heavily of beer and smoke. The four, technically five if we add William, don't drink or smoke and don't particularly enjoy the smell or a lot that goes with it, for our own reasons. William, 19M is Katie's boyfriend, they got together last October, and he lives elsewhere in the building. He hangs out in the living room most days, cuddles with Katie, and we all work on homework together or play one of the 30 boardgames I have. Nova's boyfriend is over 24/7, and he sleeps in her bed. They often take showers together, and enjoy very loud *bonding* activities together when Taylor is in class. I don't know if he lives on campus, and it was fine the first few nights, but it is starting to get creepy. We have an all girls room, and we have found pee on the floor around the toilets, when Nova's friends are the only males that use our bathroom. Since you also need a key to get into the living room, Nova will leave the door open at a bunch of random times when no one else is awake so he can get in. Alex, Katie, and I have been the only ones to add anything to the living room. Alex brought an extra chair and some figures, Katie brought a Lego set, cards, dominos, and some nic nacks. I brought a TV and all the hookups, TV stand, over 30 boardgames, coffee table, rug, two chairs, a throw blanket, some pillows, futon, posters, lights, and TV dinner tables. I got the TV from my dad, but pretty much everything else I tried to thrift. It's still over $1,000 worth of stuff I've collected to make it feel welcoming. There have been issues with stealing this year, and we have had problems with an individual from floor three coming in and snooping around with or without our absence. Leaving the door open has been addressed multiple times, and I honestly just wish for him to be removed. I don't feel comfortable with him around, and Nova and Taylor do not care about our privacy or our items. 

Issue 3, The Bathroom: As stated above, there is pee found on the floor of the bathroom, in addition some of Nova and Taylor's friends don't flush the toilets, which makes the entire place smell bad. There has been underwear, socks, and bras in the bathroom. If they are hanging up to dry that is fine, but they'll just sit their for days. Alex uses our trashcan, and there is one in the bathroom for pads and bathroom things. Ayaana has her own trashcan that she takes out. We have recycling for cardboard, plastic, and cans which I take care of when it's filling up. Taylor and Nova like using the bathroom trashcan as their personal trashcan, and don't take it out. They have never cleaned the bathroom, as that task usually falls to Ayaana and I. In addition when Nova brushes her teeth she doesn't lean down, instead she spews her toothpaste all over the counter and mirror. I brought a mini shelf to store cleaning supplies. Most of my supplies are gone, stolen, not used, and the shelf is covered in laundry and their shampoo bottles. I also brought shelf's for inside the shower so people wouldn't have to carry any of that. Katie and I's toothpaste has been stolen, along with my conditioner, cotton swabs, and toothpicks. We all have little drawers under the sink to store are stuff in. 


I am not sure what to do going forward, and I just wish for these instances to stop. A lot of it is nitpicking, but the constant guests and the door being left over is really bothering everyone.",1,1769721169.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1qql8qz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1qql8qz/dear_future_husbandday_19/,Dear Future Husband(Day 19),"Dear Future Husband,

Happy Friday! I hope you started your weekend well. I dreamt about you last night! You messaged me saying you’d be in Manila, but sadly, I was on a family trip to Shanghai in that dream. It was still a nice dream, though. The idea of having you is comforting.

I know it’s usually not good to talk about the past with someone you’re currently with (not sure about a future husband yet, lol), but I still want to share this with you—maybe so you can understand me better someday.

I once met a guy… Let’s call him John, because I’m a Swiftie and I love the song “Dear John.” When I met him, I thought he was you. He was upfront about wanting to pursue me. At first, I hesitated, but I still entertained him—maybe for the plot?

He checked on me daily and was vocal about wanting me, even calling me his “dream girl.” He made me feel happy. Even though he had limited time, I didn’t mind. I understood his calling and wanted to support him. Again, I thought he was you. I remember preparing a care box for his PLE, complete with handwritten notes. I had fun putting it together—thinking carefully about what to include, researching how sour flavors could help reset someone’s mood because he said he was anxious, checking which drip coffee tasted best even though I can’t drink coffee myself because of palpitations. I even wrote, “On days when you can’t get Starbucks.”

Then I got ghosted. Haha. Maybe that’s what I get for dating someone in the medical field… Or maybe someone from my past was right when they said I was never worth the effort. Sometimes, I wonder if I was meant to be alone. Or if I don’t deserve to be happy.

For context, there was someone before him too. Let’s call him Bob—like Bob the Builder, because sometimes I feel like I built him for his future fiancée. I met Bob in my mid-twenties. He was sweet at first, and I thought he was you too. He showered me with flowery words and promises. Long story short, I supported his game-streaming dreams and his gaming hobbies, and I spent all my savings trying to follow him to the land down under. I never fully recovered from that.

Eventually, he became distant. We broke up, and it turned out that his ex before me had unblocked him. They got back together and later got engaged. I felt like I had built him for someone else, like I was just a waiting shed. I remember him telling me during the breakup that I was “never worth the effort” and that I “never made an effort.”

Don’t get me wrong, my love—I have already moved on from these people. I even sought professional help. But the words “I was never worth the effort” still sting. My psychiatrist told me that this can happen: even when we move on, some wounds still linger.

So, my love, I hope you’ll be patient with me. There may be days when I need a little extra reassurance, and I want you to know that it won’t be your fault.

I feel a bit too vulnerable after writing this, so I’ll end it here. Please always take care, my dearest husband. I can’t wait to be with you… So please exist.

Love,

Your Future Wife

His mother liked my profile and reached out. One of the sweetest prospecting MIL to be fair. She was so sweet that I would have married her son to be her daughter in law. 😂

But then I met the son, a lifeless consultant, so busy in his life that he didn’t have a moment to breathe. I am not a consultant so I don’t understand the difficulties of that life. But he was so emotionally detached from life, all he wanted to do was work and perhaps occasionally meet women when his mother would insist. 

I felt bad for him! But I guess he actively chose that life! I wonder why?

I tried to build a connection but he wouldn’t respond for weeks! So we didn’t continue!

**Title:** The Brain Song for Memory – The Weird Trick That Actually Worked for Me 🧠🎶  

So, I’ve been down a rabbit hole lately—trying literally *everything* to boost my focus and memory. Coffee. Supplements. Sleep tracking. You name it. Most things gave short bursts of clarity, but the results always faded fast.  

Then, almost by accident, I came across something called **The Brain Song**. It’s not your typical “listen-for-10-minutes-and-become-a-genius” gimmick. It’s more like a rhythmic re-training tool designed to sync your brain’s focus patterns through sound and repetition—and honestly, I was skeptical as hell at first.  

Here’s the link for anyone curious: [https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song)  

After 10 days, something subtle but noticeable happened: my recall improved. Like, remembering small details from conversations, numbers, and even where I left my wallet (a miracle on its own). It felt like my brain was rebooted into clearer mode. I’m not saying it’s magic—science might explain it better—but the process made me rethink how sound interacts with memory storage.  

If you’re into mental optimization, productivity hacks, or just curious about how music patterns can retrain your cognitive flow, **you should seriously explore** [https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song).  

What’s wild is how *simple* the idea is. We’ve known music enhances learning since forever. This just takes that principle, structures it, and gives your brain a rhythm to tune into. I find myself playing it before deep work or online projects—and my consistency’s improved dramatically.  

Give it a look, and if you end up trying it, let me know how it hits you mentally:  
👉 [https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song)  

Sometimes it’s not about another app or supplement—it’s about retraining the patterns in your head with something as simple (and human) as sound. 🎧

Instead of traditional walkthrough videos, the idea is more lifestyle-focused short-form content that shows what it feels like to live in a space (morning routine, light, neighborhood, coffee nearby, commute vibes, etc.). Think POV / story-driven content rather than “here’s the kitchen, here’s the bedroom.”

I’m in very early discovery mode and mostly trying to learn: 

* Would creators be interested in this type of content? 
* What would make it fun vs awkward to film? 
* What would you want from an agent or homeowner to make it smooth
* Does this feel like something that fits your content style?

I’m especially curious to hear from creators in NJ or NYC who already make lifestyle, apartment, or day-in-the-life content.

1qql7jy,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1qql7jy/everyday_i_miss_you/,Everyday I miss you,"Hey, Hi, Good Afternoon, 

Against all logic and reasoning, I miss you. I still think of you daily, no matter how much I tell myself I shouldn't. No matter how much I tell myself you don't care. Because if you did care, you would reach out. 

Problem is, I care. Even when I shouldn't anymore. I don't even see you on a regular basis. But I still care. I care what you are up to. I care if you are having a good or bad day. I care if you are tired or full of energy. I care if you are missing me or not. I care on why you haven't reached out to me after all this time. I want to stop caring, but I can't. 

Logically, I know why I haven't sent this or why I won't message you. Since we have known each other, it has been me reaching out first 80% of the time. Since we stopped working together, that increased to 100% of the time. I don't want to do a one-sided friendship or situationship. I can't. I am better than that. 

Or am I? All the reasons I am telling myself not to reach out are fading more and more with each day. What if I just asked to get coffee? Or Chipotle? Would you say yes? Would it be like old times when we would sit outside and eat our lunch on a Thursday afternoon, laughing and talking about everything under the sun? Would I have the courage to finally lay it all out there and ask the hard questions? Why haven't you reached out? Do you miss me? Can we be friends and talk on a regular basis? Or was it just convenient for you before? 

I just miss you. I miss us. If I wanted to, I would right?

So here I stay, stuck in this perpetual loop in my head. These thoughts on repeat no matter how many times I try to ignore them or distract myself. No matter how many times I write them down. Until I find a way off this mental merry go round, I will just be here. Silently hoping you will reach out but also knowing there almost zero chance of that happening.

He noticed her confusion and offered to help. ""What does your father like to read?""

She smiled gently. ""I'm not sure. He's sixty-three.""

There was an extraordinary calmness about her that captivated him immediately.

Adam was always rushed, impatient. But with Kate, his temper settled. She was so relaxed, understanding. She'd agree with him softly or smile in a way that made him feel peaceful.

Soon, he wanted to marry her.

Kate's father was against it. ""She deserves better. You're irrational and hot-tempered.""

Everything was great at first. Kate always smiled, never complained about Adam's temper.

Then Adam started noticing things.

Kate wasn't just peaceful—she was slow.

Forty minutes later, she'd still be sitting on the bed, staring at her closet.

""Kate, where are we going again?"" he'd ask.

He'd make her coffee, set it in front of her. She'd stare at it, then smile. ""Is this for me?""

""Yes, Kate. You asked for coffee five minutes ago.""

""Oh. Thank you.""

She read constantly. Adam thought maybe she was too absorbed in books to pay attention.

But she was affectionate. She'd hug him warmly. ""I love you, Adam.""

She'd ask if he was hungry and try to cook, moving slowly through the kitchen.

""How do I make pasta again?"" she'd ask about simple meals.

""These pills are making you slow,"" he said. ""Why are you taking them?""

Kate stared at him with glassy eyes. ""Please give them to me.""

""No. These are the problem.""

He threw them in the sink and flushed water over them.

Kate screamed. ""NO!"" She ran to the sink, staring in terror at the drain.

Adam thought he'd get his Kate back—the gentle, passionate woman from the bookstore.

He's been brought up in a culture where men don't help in household chores or kids. Initially he tried to break cultural oppression by helping with the kids (this took years), but slowly started accepting the normal cultural upbringing as his parents instilled in him. His mom till this day baby's him, and has made it very difficult for him to do anything helpful. We both used to work, but this year it's only been him, while I'm home. 

Fast forward, his siblings all got married, and they all are hands on within their families. His mother's oppression couldn't crack them. It bugs me so much, that my husband just sits and watches me burn out. 

If we have dinners that we host, he won't bother watching the kids, helping with cleaning or in the kitchen, and definitely won't help after guests leave. I try to make everything at home because he will give me a hard time ordering out. 

He doesn't even help in day to day tasks. Well go for groceries and even though I'm with him, helping, as well as chasing my kids, well both bring groceries home and I'll be putting them away myself. Any task I ask of him to do, he'll ensure he procrastinates as much as possible till he forgets or I end up doing it myself. Hell throw his garments around, if he's the last one to wake up, he won't make the bed, he leaves his plate on the table (not even bringing it to the sink), etc. I'm like a MAID! 

Unfortunately, he's very keen on helping others. If we go to his parents house, hell help his siblings around, my mother in-law, or my sister inlaws. If the lawn needs to be mow, noone will ask him to do it, but he'll be the first to ease his family's burden. Gardening???? You'll find MY HUSBAND buying all the items and making the lawn better. My mother in-law will be vaccuming or doing dishes and guess who will pull it out of her hands and then puts it in mine if I'm around?? My husband! 

He's very hands on over there. But at home, he emphasizes that he's exhausted and needs a break playing his video games or just sitting at coffee shops. I'll continue asking for help and he'll keep refusing or telling me not to host people/or do the task itself if it's a hassle (I host once a month only because others constantly host us). He'll say he will do it, but that task will not be done for days end. 

It's gotten to a point I feel like just throwing all his stuff out for him to do himself. He'll see my working all day, cleaning and cooking and he'll just sit on the sofa or leave the house and do his own thing. 

When I was working, I would be running all the errands, coming home from work to cook/clean, feed the family, help my kids with their homework, and still make time for the family. If I ask him to do it, he makes it sound like he's the only one whose working. 

How are women getting their husbands to help around??? I'm so sick of babying my husband I feel like I'll snap any moment because of it. Like I have kids to raise too!! I can't be parenting, raising and doing these things for him too. I get absolutely NO HELP.

Right now I have some soil beds drawing a couple liters an hour at most. But that keeps 1 pump and purifier powered constantly. So that coffee tree is costing me a commitment of 18kw at all times.

Ideally I'd like some kind of buffer tank where pumps turn on when it's capacity falls below 10% and shuts off when it gets back to 100%

It seems like junction boxes have some kind of port priority system that could possibly achieve this. But so far I can't really figure out the rules of, or if there even is, a port priority system in place.

1qqkss0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1qqkss0/bipolar_ex_gf_medicated_on_lithium/,Bipolar ex gf medicated on lithium,"my bipolar ex gf used to verbally and emotionally abuse me (scream and yell at me, degrade me, attack personal insecurities and things related to me, attack our relationship and tell me im terrible and “why would she be with someone like me”) and then when i gave her an ultimatum to either stop the abuse or id leave her, she told me someone out there would love her regardless of what she says to them and love her regardless of the disorder(which I did despite her claims of me not), and then told me literally like an hour later that shed change for me because she loved me more than anything, and then directly after that literlly the same day that night, proceeded to hang out with and tell me she was into a different guy because he could lead her better in a godly relationship, and that I deserved someone better, she literally cheated and said “I don’t really care tbh” like it totally broke me (she would also become super religious randomly) , i dated her for a year and a half and its like she doesnt even care and she blocked me on everything. Is it okay that I gave her the ultimatum to stop the abuse? Will she come back? Her mom used to also say that I was the problem and that I was controlling and manipulative and then any time my ex would say something really mean to me or yell and be abusive, she and her mom would both blame me and claim that “well you instigated her” by the way both her and her mom and dad and brother all have bipolar. I would get screamed at for literally everything, opening up to her, asking her a question, I would even get screamed at for doing things that SHE asked me to do. She had tried to break up with me many many times. She dresses incredibly provocatively and seeks a LOT of attention from other guys, lots and lots of guy friends and doesn’t really get along with other girls. After every breakup she would move on really quickly and start dating other guys fast. I couldn’t express ANY discomfort with anything or else I’d get screamed at and verbally attacked and emotionally attacked for being “insecure” or “controlling” and that I didn’t understand her. She would do all this and I couldn’t say anything meanwhile if I even had a conversation with a female at any point throughout the day, literally something as small as ordering coffee from a barista who’s a girl, she would get super mad and start making crazy claims about how I wanted other girls and that I was disloyal and she couldn’t trust me. And then bring up some invalid example from literally over a year prior that’s not even true or accurate and proceed to get mad about that. Before me she had never had a relationship with a guy longer than 2 months, I was the longest, a year a half. On top of all this she would tell me that she’s so in love with me and only wants me and do all these crazy amazing things for me. Like it’s just so hard. I don’t get it. I was always there for her, like I had learned how to be with her and help her through episodes, how to calm her down when she would get super emotional and lash out, even did everything on her terms even when some of it was unrealistic and disrespectful to me as her boyfriend, I never yelled, never blew up or got mad, never called her crazy or cussed at all, I always stayed cool headed when she’d blow up and say things to me, never shamed her(even tho she claimed I was shaming her if I so much as mentioned the abuse or something she said that was abusive) this is just really hard because all of my family and friends know how bad this was for me, and it’s probably a good thing she’s done, but there’s a pretty good chance she comes back, should I take her back if she does? Is it okay I gave her the ultimatum of no more abuse or I’m gone? Why doesn’t she care, it’s like I meant nothing and all I had done to support her when she was emotional and not emotional meant nothing, when she was in a car accident and I stayed by her side for 8 hours in the hospital even when she wanted me to leave and said she was fine, and calmed her down and helped her through her shock. She’s on lithium but I honestly don’t think it’s helping much. Everyone says it gets worse with age too, I don’t know it’s just hard.

What’s going awry and how can we make this better?,"My fiancé and I have been in what’s become a fairly consistent loop of conversational misunderstandings turning into arguments. The pattern goes like this: 

1. She will say something that I take as offensive or excessively confrontational. 

2. I initially show that I am taking what she’s saying this way through body language or by going quiet. 

3. She then goes quiet, then after a minute or two if I think it’s bad enough, I react to what she said consistent with how I took it

4. She reveals an entirely different meaning, or says she was joking, or disengages completely, gets hurt, and will I’d the say something to the effect of “you know I don’t have bad intentions so why do you keep interpreting me that way”.

5. I’m now the asshole for making an argument about it and it creates distance in the relationship that means thinks like less dates less banter less sex until enough time passes 

Examples over just the past week:

A: While shaving, she said in a raised voice that I’m ruining a clean sink and need to clean **every** hair up afterwards. I feel attacked by this, give her a bit of a glaring look, she giggles and says somewhat defensively that she was joking, I don’t believe her and after I’m done clap back by saying in a similarly raised voice that even though we’d already talked about that not really being a practical thing and that I don’t want to hear about it. She later criticises me for yelling at her, saying she was just joking / asking me to do a cleaning chore and that I shouldn’t have interpreted what she said that way. 

B: While on a run I get an apologetic text from a friend saying that they’re having a destination wedding and I’m not invited. Not the nicest thing to hear, I tell my partner about it and come home a bit sad and ask to talk it out. She agrees but after a minute she interjects saying “why don’t you have a shower”. I get a bit shocked cause this sounds very dismissive and definitely not something I’d say to someone who got some bad news. I let it show on my face, she sees, does the same giggle + “or not! haha”. I take the shower anyway and when I come out she’s sitting where she was with a neutral look but says nothing. I get changed and tell her calmly that it was a rude thing to say and then go make coffee. She leaves the house angry without saying anything, comes back later having settled down and seems happy to just not talk about it. 

C: I’m making dinner and we’re exchanging banter. I give her a tease and say that “I’m on thick ice I can throw a couple spanners in the works haha”, she seems to take it well but claps back saying “no boy you’re on thin ice”. Keeping the vibe going I ask why I’m on thin ice and she refers to the last two instances that I “picked fights” with her. Now this bothers me cause saying it like that makes it sound like I was entirely at fault both times. I go quiet for a bit and then after a minute or two ask again more seriously why I’m on thin ice. She ends up clarifying that I’m on thin ice because she’s stressed about work - that she meant that she felt stretched, not that I’d fucked up per-se. I challenge this because she was fairly clear before that the last instance was involved and she meant that she wanted me to have a shower “so that we could be closer and talk more easily”. She once again criticises me for taking things poorly, but I explain that to me this is wild because 1. “On thin ice” has a clear and specific meaning and it’s not that. 2. In both instances there was absolutely no way I could have arrived at her intended meaning with what was said and she didn’t clarify until I reacted, making me the asshole. 

She’s explicitly told me a few times that she sees herself as a good and well meaning person and that I should interpret the things she says by giving her the benefit of the doubt. It hurts her to think that I demonise her in these interactions. 

In principle she’s not wrong but in these moments she sounds to me extremely (passive) aggressive / dismissive. I give people chances to correct themselves, but never just outright overlook things that the person says because of general intent. 

The more I think about her take on things, the weirder it seems. It’s almost gaslighting but not quite. Intent is important for providing context but there’s a limit to that, it doesn’t give a person carte blanche to say whatever they want and given infinite grace right?

It’s definitely not a perspective I carry myself. In many instances I will say something with the best intent to someone close to me (including her) that doesn’t seem to land right. When this happens I don’t fault the person for “demonising” me, I try to proactively clarify what I said / meant and usually that resolves any misunderstandings straight away. After our most recent argument I asked her to start doing this and she seemed to reluctantly agree but I’ve basically had the cold shoulder since then. 

I’m really worried this could kill the relationship. Neither of us feel especially safe talking to each other and both of us feel like assholes. It’s driving a huge wedge. I don’t really care about who’s right or wrong but I don’t know what to do about it though. Any advice welcome! ",0,1769720087.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

1qqkplc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCAD/comments/1qqkplc/notebookstyle_parametric_modeling_for_documented/,Notebook-style parametric modeling for documented designs,"Coming from the OpenSCAD world, I’ve been experimenting with an idea that might interest FreeCAD users; what if parametric models lived inside documentation, instead of docs being an afterthought?

Using **org-press + JSCAD**, you can:
- Write prose explaining design intent and constraints
- Embed executable parametric geometry directly in the document
- Reuse documented geometry blocks across projects
- Publish everything as a website with live 3D previews

Think notebook-style parametric modeling, similar to Jupyter, but for geometry.

This is not a FreeCAD replacement. It focuses on capturing design rationale, sharing parametric primitives, and publishing models and explanations in one place; potentially complementary to FreeCAD’s Python and parametric workflows.

GitHub: https://github.com/org-press/org-press  
Docs: https://www.orgp.dev  
JSCAD demo page: https://www.orgp.dev/plugins/jscad.html#simple-cube
JSCAD demo with modules: https://www.orgp.dev/plugins/jscad.html#mechanical-assembly-with-imports

**Call to action**  
From a FreeCAD perspective, is there an equivalent or adjacent workflow already in use? Could something similar be built on top of FreeCAD and Python? Would a document-first approach to parametric modeling be useful, or does it add complexity without enough benefit?

Also, I’ll be in Belgium for FOSDEM; if you’re around and want to chat about this over a coffee or a beer, feel free to ping me.

Thank you in advance for your time,
looking forward to your feedback!",2,1769719992.0,FreeCAD,1,1.0,False

1qqkooh,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1qqkooh/what_do_you_do_to_help_you_out_of_adhd_stupor_and/,What do you do to help you out of ADHD stupor and get started on your day?,"Hey Folks.

So i have a question Im looking to gain some clarity on. I'm sure many of you also share in the experience of staring at the ceiling, knowing you have something important you should be doing but you just can't start. So instead, you doom scroll, roll over and sleep, or do just about anything else but the actual task at hand. I especially feel that way on days when I feel emotionally low.

I've tried some apps as a solution. That pomodoro app where you grow a little tree that locks your phone, and theres that Finch app where you take care of a little bird. Although honestly the only thing that helps me manage my tasks for the day is old school analog writing. It might have something  to do with the novelty in my brain from my journals. They're all my favorite color, i love the paper, and i have a pen i really enjoy writing with. But generally I just brain dump all of my tasks down on paper and time block my day based on priority. If its a lot of tasks and it includes me being aware of time (yikes), then I map it out digitally. That and of course my prescribed medication. But even before any of that I have to actually get up and start.

What I find actually helps me kick start myself into work mode is creating a ritual for myself. I start with a shower, then some movement like light stretching or walking my dog around the block. Once i get back, I relax with some coffee/food, and an episode of whatever it is Im binding at the time. Right now it's classic King of the Hill lol. THEN I finally walk over to my desk and get started.

Its kind of nuts. Im frozen in space until that whole sequence is complete. Then I can flip on my ""hyperfocus mode"" and lock in for like 5-6 hours.

My questions for yall:

1. Do you struggle more with actually starting your tasks or staying focused on them? Or both?

2. Have you tried any ADHD focused apps? Do they help? I've heard about a few but haven't tried them myself. Curious to know others' thoughts on them.

3. Do you have a ritual or a sequence of activities that helps you turn ""on""?

I ask because I genuinely want to know if this is a gap worth exploring. I appreciate any response or insights!",1,1769719931.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False
1qqko9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qqko9w/sp_spirits_chapter_2/,[SP] Spirits Chapter 2,"Spirits are cruel creatures. They demand balance, and don’t favor good over bad. I drove Henry’s truck a few towns over and pulled into a rest stop for some food and water. The sun was just coming up making everything purple and hazy. The spirit led me a few more miles down the road to a town overlooking rolling green hills. When we got into town, I parked the car in a parking lot and walked across the street. A funeral home was just down the road next to a small cafe. I got some coffee and waited until the people inside the funeral home came out.

The door opened and a small bell clinged. A short fat boy was being led out by his mother. A few old women. A single man with a bad spray tan. The sun was big and bright by then, and every time the door opened it sent a beam of light streaking across the street and back. One by one everyone filed out. Many of them were talking, some were crying, hugging, comforting. They seemed like a group who really loved each other. The spirit didn’t care.

Last to exit were two young girls and their father, a tall, skinny man with wire-rimmed glasses and wispy brown hair that was sticking straight up. He looked lost, hardly able to speak. The girls were holding both of his hands, but an old lady in front of them called them and they went running to her, leaving the man alone. He seemed not to know what to do after his daughters left him, as though they were his only tether to the earth. He stood frozen in the sun for a moment, then stuck his fingers under his glasses and rubbed his eyes. He turned and saw me. I felt the spirit stir in me. It’s possible the man felt it too. He stared for a long time. Then his girls came back to him and dragged him away.

I walked back to the truck and followed the procession of cars out. Their lights were all flashing and they drove at a mournful pace. We drove out of town and down a country highway, past old churches and crumbling tombstones and wooden farmhouses with their roofs caved in. The grass was longer and greener, and clouds rolled by as big as mountains.

The procession pulled into a gravel drive that twisted through trees to a dirt road that led to a small white church. I put my flashers on and followed the line of cars down the lane to a cluster of chairs where a preacher stood waiting under a tent next to a hole in the ground. I looked around and noticed headstones filling up a sloping green hill that stretched out behind the church.

I sat in my car as everyone walked to the gravesite and stood around the hole as the preacher gave her sermon. I wondered if the words meant anything to the husband, or if they were as empty as the hole waiting for his dead wife’s coffin. His blank stare suggested he wasn’t even listening.

When the preacher was finished, I walked over to a nearby tree and waited for him to see me. The party talked for a long time after the body was buried. Hands on shoulders, hugs, remembrances. A whole group of people trying to find the right reason to excuse another death that happened for no reason at all. The husband was the only one who seemed to understand. His face remained unchanged regardless of who came up to him or what they said.

Eventually everyone began to walk slowly back to their cars. The two little girls were walking ahead of their father with their grandmother. I stepped out from the shadow of the tree and looked at him. He seemed to sense my gaze and turned to meet it. Again I felt the spirit rise, and again I wondered if the man could sense it too. He stared for a moment, then walked over to me. We stood staring at each other. He asked if he knew me. I said no, but he didn’t seem convinced. Maybe it was the spirit, or maybe it was just his imagination. Grief can make people see signs in places that really mean nothing at all.

“If I don’t know you, why are you here? Did you know Maria?”

I shook my head and told him I was there for him. His eyes widened with some misguided false understanding.

“You’re here to take me to her aren’t you? To see my Maria again. Yes, it was you...in my dream...I dreamed that I was with her again. She was there beside me, smiling and holding my arm. A hooded figure took me to her. It was you!”

I made no response. He looked like he wanted to hug me. It was alarming how quickly he had convinced himself of everything. I couldn’t say whether he would see his wife again. That wasn’t part of the bargain. If the spirit was making him promises in his dreams, that was between them. He stood transfixed, tears in his eyes. I noticed his two girls crying into their grandmother’s legs while she held them. Their cries were audible even from afar, but he seemed hardly to notice at all. There was only one thing on his mind.

“I’ll go. When do we leave?” It was too easy. It shouldn’t have been so easy. I found myself wanting him to stay.

“What about your girls?”

He seemed to return from somewhere else. He looked behind him as though he didn’t know where he was. “Oh...yes. Yes, that will be hard. But they’ll have their grandmother. And their aunts and cousins. Maria was always so much better with them anyway. I...I...I don’t know how...”

At this he was overcome with sadness and buried his head in his hands to sob. He had to come of his own will. He could have no convincing. I had thought it would be impossible to tear a man away from his family. It was easier than killing Henry the wife killer. The man was still crying. The girls were watching him now. They seemed to want to run to him, but then they looked at me and hid behind their grandmother’s legs. He looked up at me.

“I want to see her again. Please. I need to. Will you take me? I can’t live like this...I don’t know how…I don’t know…how…”

“The grief will pass.” I didn’t know why I said it. I kept looking at the girls, cowering behind their grandmother, scared, motionless. The grandmother looked frail, like she was on her last leg. They would be orphans within a couple years, homeless and parentless. It seemed an unfathomable price no one in his right mind would pay. But he shook his head and grabbed my arm.

“I don’t want the grief to pass. It’s all I have left of her. The only thing I can imagine worse than losing her is forgetting her. No. The grief is good. It will help me see her again. Let me say goodbye to the girls and I’ll meet you back here.”

I watched him walk over to his girls. The grandmother called him Daniel and asked if he was ok. I wondered what he would tell them. How could he possibly explain? Abandoning his daughters on the day they buried their mother. Would he lie? He was supposed to be the balance, the light. Yet, in that moment, he seemed like a monster. Or maybe I was the monster. Every moment I stood waiting to take him away from his children, every moment I didn’t turn and run, to force him to stay with his family, I felt myself transforming into something unspeakable. The spirit calmed my nerves. I kept waiting.

Daniel embraced his girls tightly, then waved and spoke a few quiet words to the grandmother before turning and making his way back to me. Her eyes widened in horror, but she seemed unable to speak. She watched him walk away, her hands on the girls’ shoulders. When Daniel returned, his eyes had a raging fire in them. The grief was gone, replaced with a crazed look of manic excitement. The spirit felt it too.

We drove west, Henry bumping around in the trunk, the same terrible excitement across Daniel’s face. None of us spoke. The spirit guided me, but I knew where to go. Green fields turned to red clay. The sun set and rose and set again. On the third night we turned off the highway and followed a thin dirt road out into the desert. About an hour down the road the truck ran out of gas, so we walked, dragging Henry behind us. In another hour I saw it ahead of us. A faint blue light rising up into the heavens.

I ran two cups worth of distilled vinegar (1 cup per round because it’s a single cup Keurig machine) and have ran maybe 6 rounds of plain water through it to get rid of the vinegar. I’m now learning I should’ve used a mixture of water to vinegar instead. I know that some amounts of distilled vinegar can be harmful if consumed — am I okay to use my machine for coffee now? Or should I run more water through it? I have health OCD and suspect I might be catastrophizing but wanted to check with some regular folks before making a cup.

My (29F) husband (37M) and I have been married for 8 years. I married him young and he's considerably older than me. We met when I was 20. I know in most cases this is bad, but he actually didn't go after me, I went after him and he was reluctant to date me for months because of my young age. 

We have two kids, age 5 and 7. They're in school so I have 5 days a week of time without kids. I am studying to be a personal trainer and am also a singer in a band, so I practice a lot. I go to the gym 3-5x a week, I take the kids to and from school, do their homework with them, make their lunches, make meals, grocery shop, meal plan, do most of the laundry, do the dishes, vacuum, take them to and from softball, and he still complains if I slack in ANY area. For example, today I took my 4 year old nephew with me on my coffee and errands run. He doesn't get much attention from his mom, so I wanted to have some time with him. 

When I came home my husband decided to beef with me because I went to a coffee shop 15 min away instead of one closer. I asked why he cared, and he said because it's a waste of time when I could have been doing housework here. I do housework all the time, but he never takes notice of what I do unless I'm doing something outside of what he thinks I should be doing with my time (he's pretty much only satisfied if I'm at home cleaning or making some sort of money). 

We have these petty little arguments all the time and I explain to him my reasoning and he just doesn't care. He will apologize later and say he will lay off and be more appreciative of me, but it never changes and two weeks later we will have the same argument again for a different reason, like if I let the laundry pile up because we had lots of softball stuff and I was busy with singing or studying. 

He can't even let me pick what grocery store I want to go to. He will literally call me and ask what I'm up to, I'll say I'm going to this store, he will say oh that's too far and doesn't have as good of deals, go to this store. I'll tell him no that's ok, I already know that this store has what I need to shop for for our meals for the week that I've planned. He will then argue with me about it, and then funny part is he's usually wrong because I also know where the deals are and I'm very money conscious. 

If I go and buy mascara or lip gloss, he will harp on me for that. He worries obsessively about money (even though we are doing ok), and I shop for my makeup at dollar tree or target because it's cheaper. Nevertheless, I will always hear a ""oh are you sure you need that?"" ""Didn't you just buy one?"" (I didn't) ""are you sure this place is the cheapest, what about this one?""  Then he will argue with me about it. 

Another issue I have with him is that if he points out things to me that he is bothered by, I try to change it but he won't do the same for me. If he comments that I didn't get to the dishes as much a certain day, l'll get defensive but then deliberately make sure I am extra careful not to ever leave them. He does not try to change anything that I'm bothered by. I have told him time and time again please don't put your dirty clothes in a heap on the floor. He justifies why he does it and continues to do it no matter how much I ask him not to. Same with other non housework related things. For example, I get hit on a lot at the gym or by people who watch me sing. I kind of want him to come to my rescue and have expressed this to him a lot, but he doesn't really get bothered if guys bother me.  He thinks I am overreacting. 

He's very out of shape and I worry for his future health, so as someone with health and fitness knowledge who is also in good shape, I encourage him to work out and eat healthy with me but he's not interested and gets mad if I push it, even knowing I'm bothered by his habits. 

I don't know what to do because the more we have these arguments the more resentful I feel and I don't like the double standards. I love him, but I don't see why it's ok for him to expect perfection of me when he doesn't have those same expectations for himself. He helps with the kids a lot, he is supportive of my singing goals, and he will pick up around the house and do some laundry, but i don't see how this makes him the authority on everything. 

Maybe some men can weigh in on this too. ",1,1769719428.0,Marriage,11,0.6,False
1qqkgha,https://i.redd.it/sgw0mcl0ocgg1.png,Fish Tank Filter Help,"Hello everyone!

I’m looking for advice from anyone who has experience with fish tanks that have the filter system built into the back compartment (AIO-style tanks).

Right now, I’m running carbon, sponge, and biological filter media back there, but my setup is pretty improvised — I currently have everything stuffed into small coffee filter bags and sitting in the bottom of the chamber.

It works, but I feel like there has to be a cleaner and more efficient solution.

I have a 3D printer and I’m interested in making (or finding) a better media holder system. What I’m imagining is something like a set of **horizontal trays or slots** that take up the full vertical space of the back chamber, so the water flows through each layer in order as it moves through the filter area.

Kind of like:

* Full-height media rack
* Slots for sponge/carbon/bio media
* Better flow path instead of loose bags

Has anyone seen a design like this before or printed something similar?

* Any DIY recommendations?
* Any existing products that do this well?
* And if anyone happens to have STL files… you will instantly become my BFF 😄

I know obsession with property is an inherently Australian thing given how our society has framed it as a lucrative investment with numerous incentives. However, as a second gen Chinese-Australian, I find this obsession particularly pronounced among my family and their ethnic circles, especially to the extent that is denigrates other forms of investing. 

That is to say, whilst my white Australian friends parents may too share the obsession with chatting about an investment property over coffee, they see other forms of investment (equities, bonds, etc.) as equally legitimate.

I know this isn’t isolated towards Chinese or Asians in general - in fact one could probably extend it to many groups of Australia’s immigrant diaspora.

There are the classic reasons (“only invest in something you can touch and feel”and “you can’t live in an ETF!”), but does anyone have some more astute justifications for this attitude I’ve described? ",23,1769719315.0,AusFinance,38,0.74,False

1qqk975,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilipinoNclex/comments/1qqk975/how_to_pass_the_nclex_i_failed_in_150_then_passed/,"HOW TO PASS THE NCLEX (I failed in 150, then passed in 85)","

I just found out I passed my second attempt in 85 questions after failing in 150! **All of my praise goes to God!!!** TRULY!!! 

I wanted to share my two cents on **HOW TO PASS THE NCLEX:**

***✨MY FIRST ATTEMPT*** *(failed in 150)*

* **What I studied:**
   * Listened to Mark K lectures 1-12
   * Arch3r (I took one CAT exam and passed, and I took 7 readiness exams and got VH, VH, BL, VH VH, H, H in that order. No practice questions)
   * Listened to Dr Sharon must know meds 1-10 videos
* **How the exam went:**
   * Walked in feeling confident
   * Finished in 150 questions, it felt way harder than any nursing exam I’ve ever taken
   * I think I had 7 case studies, one bow tie, one picture to identify, etc
   * I left knowing I failed... it was awful

***✨MY SECOND ATTEMPT*** (passed in 85)

* **What I studied:**
   * NCLEX Crusade on YouTube (red and blue background videos)
   * NCLEX Bootcamp 30 days
   * Dr Sharon on YouTube
   * Listened to Mark K lecture 12 on the way to my exam
* **How the exam went:**
   * Walked in feeling confident (paranoid but confident)
   * Finished in 85 questions, it was WAY easier than my first attempt
   * I had 5 case studies (they all felt quite easy expect for the 5th one was kinda hard), lots of multiple choice
   * I left feeling certain that I passed!!! I literally cried tears of joy when I got in my car

***✨WHAT I RECOMMEND STUDYING:***

* **NCLEX Crusade 7 day training on YouTube**
   * Red background videos
   * Blue background (NGN) videos
   * I thought the info in these vids were pretty obvious but it was a nice way of re-introducing studying when I was still grumpy about retaking lol. It introduces test strategy well
* **NCLEX Bootcamp!!!**
   * I followed the 30 day study plan. I truly love bootcamp, and it made the studying process somewhat enjoyable (or at least, way more bearable)
   * I wanted to make SURE I gave it my all to pass my second attempt, and I think Bootcamp definitely strengthened my knowledge & prepared me to accomplish that
   * ***My Bootcamp stats:***
      * I finished all case studies + watched the review videos (so helpful!)
      * I did 1830 questions of the Q bank (read all rationales and took notes on only some)
      * Did all of the fundamentals questions & repeated the ones I got wrong until I got them right (NCLEX loves fundamentals!!)
      * Overall performance was 72%
      * I got very high on every readiness exam (73%, 79%, 71%, 74%)
      * *(The most important thing is to do a ton of practice questions and READ THE RATIONALES and understand WHY you got it wrong)*
* **Dr Sharon on YouTube**
   * “Prioritization strategies” playlist (watch all of the videos)
   * “Fundamentals” playlist (for any topics you struggle with)
   * She’s great for understanding test strategy! I would pause her videos to do the practice question by myself and then unpause to see how she explained her thought process
* **NCSBN has an NCLEX exam preview**
   * I didn’t do this, but if you wanted extra study practice, there’s an NCLEX preview exam on the NCSBN website
   * There’s a quizlet with the correct answers to check your work

***✨My MISTAKES the first time:***

* **I only took practice tests.** I remediated those exams but didn’t look at the categories I was doing good/bad in. It wasn’t a comprehensive approach
* **I didn’t take breaks during my study sessions.** I literally only took practice exams with no breaks. It burnt me out. For my second attempt, some days I'd do 20 questions at a time then a break and then more questions, and some days I'd lock in for a practice exam. It wasn't nonstop grind every day
* **I didn’t do any practice Qs**. It’s so helpful to get immediate feedback on questions right after you answered it so that you can immediately correct yourself & evaluate your thought process. Then test yourself with practice exams to simulate the exam
* **I didn’t reaaally think I needed to study!** I had a 3.96 GPA, did very well on the exit exam, my college has a 96% pass rate, Arch3r said I had >98% chance of passing. But I didn’t do a comprehensive study approach and didn’t realize I was lacking in a few knowledge areas— then the NCLEX noticed I was getting those topics wrong and kept testing me on them 
   * (for example, I didn’t realize I struggled with infection control. But I still scored well on the practice tests before my first attempt because I performed well enough on the rest of the test and didn’t review the categories of where I needed to study more. Then on my first attempt of the NCLEX, it kept giving me infection control Qs because I was getting them wrong and then it led me to being on the cusp of passing. All I needed was a little refresher on infection control rules, but I didn’t realize that until after I failed and looked into it)
* **I didn’t know that the NCLEX was more of a critical thinking exam** and not simply a content exam. Idk maybe I was living under a rock but no one told me this?? I was freaked out on my first attempt when I got diseases, meds, etc that I had NEVER heard of, and then I just thought “well I never learned about this, so I guess I have to guess??” I didn't know the strategy. I wish I knew that critical thinking is the WHOLE POINT of the NCLEX! If you don’t know something, use critical thinking skills + use the strategies from Bootcamp rationales & Dr Sharon videos
* Also, just a side note, **consider not telling anyone when you’re taking the test.** It takes the pressure off. And it killed me having to tell all of my friends, family, etc that I failed (especially because they all expected me to pass without a doubt, so I felt like even more like a let down lol. Very humbling!)

***✨CRITICAL THINKING ADVICE:***

* **Look for key words**— what is the question REALLY asking? The answer should address it
* If a question asks what is the FIRST thing you would do or what would you PRIORITIZE… I will think “okay, that means all of the answer choices could be true.” Instead of trying to figure out what’s right or wrong, assume they all are correct. Then say, “if I could only do ONE thing, what would I do first / which is the MOST important?” (Also, there is usually a difference between the FIRST and BEST action)
* **Look for absolute words** (always, never, only, etc)… that could mean that answer choice is incorrect
* **When in distress, do not assess!** If the patient is in severe life or death distress, you probably aren’t going to evaluate something— you are likely first going to take an action to help them
* **If you don’t know, use process of elimination!** If the question has a random disease or disorder you don’t recognize, look at the answer choices and try to see if you know any of those and then eliminate them if it’s something else!
* When evaluating answer choices… **if you could only do ONE thing, which one would you do?** NCLEX tends to like the most SAFE and LEAST INVASIVE possibility that will fix the problem
* **Don't choose the answer choice you don't know over the one that you do know!** Dr Sharon says this all the time. If you're going through the answer choices and you see one that you think is right, and then you see an answer choice that you've never heard of and don't know if it's right or wrong... DON'T CHOOSE THE ONE YOU'RE UNSURE OF!
* **Compare two answer choices at a time!!!** This was one of the most helpful strategies for me!! Especially for questions that ask for the “best” nursing action. Think to yourself ***“If I do A but not B… would that be better than if I did B but not A?”***
* **Prioritization strategies to remember:**
   * Unexpected vs Expected
   * Early vs Late
   * Acute vs Chronic
   * Objective vs Subjective
   * Physiological vs Psychosocial

***✨Studying advice:***

* While studying, **take it seriously like you would on test day!** If you get a question you don’t know, you might want to just guess because it’s just a practice Q… but would you just guess on the exam? Probably not! You would likely take it more seriously because it’s the exam! Pretend like your studying is the exam. If you don’t know a question, rack your brain or try to use critical thinking to narrow it down. It might work or it might not. But you practice your critical thinking! And if you get it wrong, you can evaluate your thinking / learn the content and then apply it next time you come across an unknown question
* **Limit distractions.** Put your phone AWAY! Practice answering questions with focus. I would put my phone in a drawer, and it actually helped so much with focusing.
* **Act like your practice test is the exam.** Simulate it! Take it at the time your exam is scheduled for. Don’t go on your phone between questions. Don’t sip on coffee or water during your practice test (you can’t bring food or drink into the actual test room). Only get up for a bathroom break or a water/snack break if you need it. 
* If there’s a day you’re feeling particularly anxious (especially as your exam date approaches), try to **study while trying to manage your anxiety** (think of it as practice for test day!)
* **Study areas that you know you’re weak in!** Bootcamp gives you percentages in each category which can help identify your weak spots. And you should watch Dr Sharon vids in those categories too!
* **STUDY FUNDAMENTALS!!!!!!!!!!**
* **STUDY PRIORITIZATION & DELEGATION!!!!!!!!!!**

***✨When going to take the exam…***

* **Mentally prepare**
   * Tell yourself, “I know I’m going to feel anxious. I know I might see things I’ve never heard of” etc …don’t freak out about! Just make sure to breatheee and go slow and **think clearly**
* **Reread the question!!** So many times if I got a practice Q wrong, I’d read the question over and realize I misread the question!
* If you don’t know the answer right away, SIT AND THINK! **Don’t just guess and move on immediately.** At the very least, try to narrow it down or rack your brain
* **Expect 150 questions.** I don’t care how smart you are. I went into my first attempt feeling so confident and assumed I would get 85 questions since so many of my peers did and I had good scores blah blah blah. HUMBLED!!! When I got to 86, I didn’t panic— but it certainly didn’t boost my confidence. Just get over your pride and expect 150 Qs and be pleasantly surprised if you pass in anything less
* **Don’t select SATA questions based on vibes** lol. I would always make that mistake and over-click answers because “I feel like it sounds right.” I’d rather under-click correct choices and get partial credit than over-click and accidentally click something wrong. There were a couple times I only selected one answer choice on SATA of my passing exam
* **Use the whiteboard!** I didn’t use it on my first attempt but it really helped me straighten out my thoughts on my second attempt!!
* **Pray!!!!! Pray, pray, pray!**

***✨The last thing I will say:***

* **My first attempt felt SO MUCH HARDER than my second attempt.** 
* Maybe if I knew the test strategies I would’ve felt differently, but the content itself truly threw me for a loop too. I genuinely didn’t know how to target my studying for my second attempt at first because the exam felt like NOTHING I had studied for previously. And then my first Bootcamp exam when prepping for my retake said that I had no categories to improve in, so I was like what am I supposed to improve in to pass??
* I think learning the test strategies was really helpful (expected vs unexpected, etc), but also I do think the content on my second attempt was SIGNIFICANTLY easier. I GENUINELY think it was just an easier exam. Knowing the test strategies made it even easier. But I feel like if I had my second attempt exam for my first attempt, I would’ve passed. But who knows! And who cares!
* Regardless, I’m glad I studied hard for the second attempt because you just never know what kind of test you will get! And it allowed me to walk in confidently despite the nerves from the possibility of failing again. So, **LEARN THE TEST STRATEGIES!!** And **use NCLEX Bootcamp**!!! If I could go back, I would have rather overstudied the first go around than have to tell everyone I know that I failed, pay another $550 to retake, and spend hours and hours studying for a month and a half leading up to my second attempt (it sucked... but I'm so grateful to be done).

I pray this was helpful!! And if you’re retaking, **you CAN and WILL pass!!!** I know it feels never-ending, but **PERSEVERE!!** The Lord is your strength!

Happy to answer questions!! **God bless :)**

You know those days where you feel like a coding god? Everything's flowing, bugs are minor, and you're just cruising. That was me, a few years back. There was this tiny, almost invisible UI glitch on a production system – a button slightly off-center on a very specific report. 'Easy fix,' I thought, my fingers practically dancing on the keyboard.

I made the change, literally one line of CSS adjustment, and pushed it to QA. Everything looked good, so it got green-lighted for production. The deployment was smooth, and I went home feeling pretty chuffed with myself. Fast forward a few hours, around 2 AM, my phone starts blowing up. It wasn't just ringing; it was vibrating with an intensity that screamed 'ALL HANDS ON DECK!' The production system, the *entire* reporting module, had gone belly-up. Completely unresponsive, spitting out generic server errors to bewildered users.

My blood ran cold. I rushed back to the office, heart hammering against my ribs. The lead developer was already there, face pale, staring at logs scrolling by at a terrifying pace. We dove in, adrenaline pumping, the air thick with the smell of stale coffee and impending doom. Hours blurred into a nightmarish fugue of tracing calls, checking logs, and replaying deployments. Every time we thought we had it, another dead end. The pressure was immense; a major client demo was slated for 9 AM, and this module was their bread and butter.

It was almost 5 AM when it hit me. That 'one-line fix.' How could a CSS change break the backend? Turns out, our ancient, sprawling codebase had a 'clever' (read: insane) feature where a specific UI element's exact positioning was tied to a backend validation check, somehow impacting a database query. Changing its visual offset, even by a pixel, triggered a cascade of invalid parameters, effectively DDoSing our own database. We rolled back *just that one line*, and watched, with bated breath, as the system slowly, agonizingly, sputtered back to life. The relief was so immense I almost cried.

I made it home just in time for a quick shower before heading back for the demo, looking like I'd wrestled a bear. The client loved the demo, none the wiser about the near-catastrophe. That experience scarred me. Now, every 'simple' change gets a raised eyebrow and a healthy dose of paranoia. It taught me that in coding, sometimes the smallest pebble can cause the biggest avalanche.

Up until now, I was enjoying the slow burn, but these two episodes are where the story really started to hit emotionally.

Episode 5 felt deceptively quiet, but it carried so much weight. Watching Bom swallow her pride and ask to return to Team White already had me rooting for her, but knowing she had no idea Jae-gyu had withdrawn his support made everything hurt just a little more. There was something so real about the way she tried to act strong while clearly feeling unwanted. No dramatic outbursts, no villains, just misunderstandings and hurt feelings quietly stacking up. That kind of emotional realism really got to me.

Then Episode 6 came in and absolutely took me out. It was funny, chaotic, frustrating, and tender all at the same time. The opening conversation between Bom and Jae-gyu immediately set the tone. When she said she couldn’t cross the line with him, it felt less like rejection and more like fear. The flashback to her past in Seoul made everything click for me. Her hesitation isn’t about mixed feelings, it’s about survival, reputation, and trauma, and I really appreciated how the drama handled that with care.

What truly surprised me was Jae-gyu’s response. Instead of pushing her or turning it into a dramatic standoff, he chose patience. His promise to wait two years until Han-gyu graduates felt unexpectedly mature, and Bom’s quiet acceptance somehow said more than a big emotional confession ever could.

Of course, the misunderstandings that followed had me internally screaming. The café scene with “that woman” was painful because as viewers, we know more than Bom does. Watching her jump to conclusions while trying to protect her own heart was hard to sit through. Her showing up to school looking stunning didn’t feel petty to me, it felt like she was reclaiming her confidence. And Jae-gyu running away from her because he couldn’t handle his feelings was equal parts hilarious and deeply frustrating.

The comedy really worked for me in this episode. From Jae-gyu’s panicked escapes to Yi-joon’s teasing and ridiculous punishment rules, it balanced out the emotional tension perfectly. Yi-joon especially stood out. His presence feels steady and safe, and their coffee scene gave Bom space to seek advice without fully exposing herself. It made her feel incredibly human.

And then came the chaos with the “thief.” I genuinely couldn’t believe how far that situation escalated. Jae-gyu chasing down a locksmith and ending up in jail overnight was absurd, but also somehow very fitting. What broke me, though, was finding out what Bom did afterward, kneeling to apologize, buying multiple locks, even pulling favors just to clear his name. That was love shown through actions, not words.

By the time Jae-gyu rushed back and Bom finally admitted she was hurt, it felt like emotional release. When he withdrew his promise to wait and kissed her, it didn’t feel rushed or dramatic. It felt earned.

Episodes 5 and 6 are where *Spring Fever* stopped being just a pleasant watch for me and became something I’m emotionally invested in. The writing, the pacing, and especially the quiet choices these characters make really pulled me in. If the drama continues handling emotions this carefully, I’m fully on board.

My supersmart, highly competent partner is planning on starting a business (similar to a specialty coffee shop) in a fantastic local space, and I am planning to support to get it off the ground. The space is currently leased to another business for the next 3 or so years, but they will be taking over at the end of that lease (it's owned by family- how lucky!). The location is AMAZING.

My partner hasn't saved any money at all to get started, and all of the plans at this point are just talk. They've never run a business before. They and I are tossing some ideas around, but nothing concrete. I'm getting kind of antsy wondering what preparations need to happen, because it seems like a great idea to start saving strategically/making lists/training as baristas/learning from local business owners/etc.

If you were my partner, what would you do? Where would you start if you were a new business owner (especially a cafe owner) with years to prepare for your opening? WHAT would you plan for? Is there a book or guide you recommend that we read? Thank you!",1,1769718348.0,smallbusiness,2,1.0,False
1qqjzht,https://chronoatlas.nl/,Time Travel through ancient history Chronoatlas,"I’ve spent an embarrassing amount of time obsessed with something most people probably find boring: old maps.

You know those old nostalgic moments when you fall into a Wikipedia rabbit hole at 2AM reading about Roman engineering or random historical events? That’s basically been my life for the past few years.

So I built the thing I always wished existed: ChronoAtlas, an interactive historical map explorer where you can dive into different eras and explore how the ancient world looked.

Right now you can explore things like the Roman Empire, Alexander the Great’s empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Dutch Golden Age. On top of that, there are historical layers you can toggle, including ancient battles, sieges, political events, religious milestones, trade routes, and thousands of ancient locations.

The part that honestly gets me emotional is when you zoom into a random place and realize people lived there, traded there, and fell in love there thousands of years ago. Most of the time History classes gave us dates to memorize, I wanted to build something that gives people stories and a sense of connection instead.

Tech-wise (if you care), it’s built with a Laravel backend, MapLibre GL for map rendering, georeferenced historical maps from museum archives, and way too much coffee.

It’s completely free. No ads. No login walls. No “subscribe to unlock more” nonsense. I’d genuinely love for people to explore it and tell me what feels broken, what they like, or what regions they’d want to see added next.

If even one person discovers something cool about history through this, all the time I poured into it feels worth it.

I've developed an efficient system to optimize loot value collected each day and to ensure I'm punishing those inhuman rats as often as possible. 

I wake up at 3am every day to ensure I can join all of the special map conditions. I usually grab my morning coffee, take part in some breathing exercises to calm my nerves, and then hop on. I make sure to take 30 minutes breaks every 4 hours to make sure I stay happy and healthy. 

Over the months I've had loads of fun and wholesome experiences, and I've even been given a special nickname by the raiders who I've helped out of the battlefied: Sir Justyce. I was so proud of the man I'd become. I'd always craft extra defibs instead of more guns, even when that slutty bobcat blueprint looked at me funny in the crafting menu, telling me, ""just once won't hurt."" Begone, foul creature, I always thought to myself, sacrificing my own experience to make sure I had enough meds for everyone I met.

Everything was going so well. That is, until, I met a user by the name ""KeepYourselfSafe."" 

Judging by his seemingly innocent username, I was expecting a friendly encounter. However, I couldn't have been further from the truth. 

He cried for help inside a building inside buried city, and I rushed there to his aid, like Batman rushing into the subway to keep the peace. But when I ran in, I was met with the harrowing sound of 5 trigger nade blowing me into smithereens. 

Let me tell you, my rage was immeasurable. This scum thinks he can knock me out with no consequences when I was just trying to help? I screamed at him to confess his sins and bow before Sir Justyce, but he gave me the death punch. Now I think maybe something more nefarious was at play... Perhaps demonic presence. 

I'm done with topside now. I'm calling every good man in speranza to stock up on blaze grenades, trailblazers, and deadlines. We're gonna burn topside to the ground. It's nothing but a breeding ground for evil at this point. 

I only ask you leave a statue in my honor, inscribed with my title: Sir Justyce ",9,1769718252.0,arcraiderscirclejerk,3,0.85,False
1qqjxrg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qqjxrg,"Heavy haul – varsity jackets, patchwork pants, and side-button tracks. Which one you picking?","1. Beats x Kim Kardashian Studio Pro (Dune/Earth)
A solid tech accessory if you're into that tonal, minimalist look. The color is ""Dune,"" and it actually looks better in person than in the renders—very low-key and high-end. Sound-wise, they’re standard Studio Pros (heavy bass, decent ANC), but you’re really buying these for the Kim K aesthetic.Great for the ""clean girl/boy"" desk setup.

Score: 8/10

2. Chrome Hearts Patchwork Varsity Jacket (Black/Black)
This is a heavy hitter. The all-black leather sleeves and the cross patches give it a very dark, avant-garde vibe. However, objectively speaking, it’s a lot of branding. If you aren't careful, the sheer number of patches can look a bit ""busy"" or over-the-top for a casual fit. Quality feels substantial, though.Hard to pull off without looking like you’re trying too hard, but high quality.

Score: 7.5/10

3. Chrome Hearts x Matty Boy (?) Red/White Varsity
This is easily my favorite piece of the entire haul. The red is incredibly vibrant, and the contrast with the cream/white sleeves is just classic. It has that vintage collegiate energy but with the luxury edge. It pops way more than the all-black version and feels like a genuine statement piece rather than just another ""hype"" item.Absolute grail. The colorway is 10/10.

Score: 9.5/10

4. Nike x Brazil CBF GORE-TEX Jacket (Mint)
This is a very specific vibe. The mint green color is refreshing, and the sponsor logos (Vivo, Itau) give it that authentic training-kit feel. It’s practical because of the GORE-TEX, but the color might be a bit difficult to style with anything other than black or neutral tech-wear.Great for rainy days or pitch-side, but a bit niche for daily wear.

Score: 7/10

5. Polo Ralph Lauren Harrington Jacket (Tan)
The ""Old Money"" essential. Compared to the Chrome Hearts stuff, this is incredibly plain, but that’s the point. The fit is boxy and classic. My only gripe is that it can look a bit ""dad-ish"" if the rest of your outfit isn't tailored well. It's a safe, reliable mid-layer.Timeless, but lacks the ""wow"" factor of the other pieces.

Score: 8/10 (for utility)

6 & 7. Chrome Hearts Hoodies (White/Black)
Standard fare here. The white one is a clean pullover with the horseshoe logo, while the black zip-up has the thermal-style floral/cross sleeve print. Honestly? They’re hoodies. They look cool, but they’re definitely ""uniform"" pieces for the brand. The white one is going to be a nightmare to keep clean.Essential for the rotation, but nothing revolutionary.

Score: 7.5/10

8. Chrome Hearts Cross Patch Chinos (Khaki)
I wanted to like these more, but the patch placement feels a little random. The khaki color is a nice break from the usual black denim, but the patches make them hard to wear to anything even slightly formal. They are definitely more of a ""streetwear"" take on a classic trouser.Cool detail, but limited versatility.

Score: 6.5/10

9. Chrome Hearts Side-Button Track Pants (White)
These are definitely a ""statement"" bottom. The silver button detailing down the side is a nice touch, and the triple cross embroidery on the thigh is classic CH. However, all-white track pants are a massive risk—one coffee spill and it’s over. They lean very heavily into that luxury-leisure aesthetic, which can look a bit ""pajama-like"" if not styled with the right shoes.High-risk, high-reward. Great for a summer flex, but be careful where you sit.

Score: 7/10

10 & 11. Ralph Lauren ""Polo Bear"" Sweaters (White & Navy)
You can’t go wrong with these. The Polo Bear is a streetwear icon in its own right. The white one with the flag sweater bear is super clean, while the navy one has that classic varsity/collegiate bear. Objectively, these are the most ""wearable"" items in the whole haul. They fit perfectly into a ""Quiet Luxury"" or ""Ivy"" look.Absolute staples. They’ll never go out of style.

Score: 8.5/10

12. Fox Racing Motocross Jersey (Teal/Black)
This one feels a bit left-field compared to the Chrome Hearts and Polo pieces. The ""Motocore"" trend is still a thing, and the teal/black color blocking is bold. It’s a very lightweight, mesh-style material—great for breathability. Honestly, it feels a bit like a costume unless you’re actually riding or going for a very specific Y2K tech-wear look.A bit niche. Cool for a specific fit, but lacks the versatility of the other pieces.

Almost every time I go for a coffee the person who takes my order refuses to even look at me (which is fine) and then they take my order and hand it back to someone else to make while I literally watch them not enter in what I ask for. I’m not talking crazy modifications I’m just talking about a latte with oat milk instead of regular milk. 

Then any time I ask to make sure that they got that they usually assure me that they did or roll their eyes at me like I’m burdening them after I just watched them screw up my order. They finally get even more annoyed when I wait for my coffee, take a sip, and then tell them it’s wrong and ask for a new one. All the while I’m very pleasant and pretty non confrontational about it. 

This begs the question “why the hell do you keep going if they always screw up your order”. Well the answer to that one is it’s honestly just kind of a running joke with myself to see how many times i can go and get the same experience. I’m currently 1/5 of just getting a correct oat milk latte at multiple different locations over the last few months. 

I’ve also never had weird service interactions like I have there at literally any other place in my life so I’m fairly confident it’s not just me being some oblivious moron but I’m wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences as me there. ",0,1769718147.0,Albany,26,0.39,False
1qqjvkh,https://i.redd.it/274ovquikcgg1.png,"45M, 5'8"", 75kg, T2D + spondyloarthropathy — struggling with belly fat & constant hunger. How to create a deficit?","Hey everyone — I’m posting to get guidance on reducing belly fat/body fat %.

Background

Age/Sex: 45M
Height/Weight: 5’8” / 75 kg
Medical: Type 2 diabetes for 15 years; currently being treated for spondyloarthropathy + knee pain (so no running/jogging).
Schedule: Evening shift; my eating window is roughly 11:00 AM → 3:00 AM.
 

Training

Gym 5 days/week (not heavy due to condition; mostly strength + safe movements)
Weekends: 90–120 mins walking, ~12k–15k steps
 

 

Diet

I attached an image of my full day intake with macros.
Orange rows = things I recently reduced to cut calories (example: walnuts, puff snack, and sometimes a ½ scoop whey “bedtime buffer” if hunger is severe).

 

Problem

Despite these cuts, I’m still constantly hungry, especially close to sleep. Warm water + ½ lemon + pinch of black salt helps slightly, but I still sometimes struggle to sleep due to hunger. Further reducing food feels difficult without sleep getting worse.

 

 

Online maintenance estimates show ~2200 kcal/day, but I’m not sure if:

my actual intake is higher than I think, or
my long wake window + diabetes meds are making hunger harder to manage, or
I’m missing something basic in meal timing / food choices.
What I’m asking

Does this look like I’m realistically in a deficit? If not, what’s the most likely place to trim calories without increasing hunger?
Any strategies to handle night hunger (especially in a late schedule) without adding many calories?
With moderate workouts and walking only (no running), what should I prioritize for belly fat reduction: calorie deficit, steps, lifting progression, meal timing, etc.?
Any tips specifically for fat loss while managing T2D hunger signals would be appreciated.
Thanks a lot
