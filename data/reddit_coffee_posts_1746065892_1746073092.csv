Did I cheat or not?,"Okay so it started off when I was in Brazil with my boyfriend two summers ago. My best friend from childhood passed away in an accident. This was very hard on me. I was really sad and felt so guilty because I had not spoken to him or replied to his texts the prior 3 months because my boyfriend told me I wasn’t allowed to talk to any other men- even my old friends. I left Brazil for the funeral and my boyfriend was hurt that I left because his family lives in Brazil and I was supposed to be staying there to be with them. But I had to go. I remember feeling like my boyfriend didn’t seem to understand how bad this was- losing my friend. I remember feeling very alone at this time and hurting a lot from losing my friend.

Anyway, my boyfriend and I got into a lot of fights while he was in Brazil and I was home. I remember telling him how I felt like he didn’t care for me etc. He told me he was trying to enjoy his time with his family which I get because he rarely gets to see them. But we ended up just having a lot of tension and in the thick of my emotional pain from that I ended up threatening to break up. We threatened this a lot but never seriously. I remember he actually agreed this time. I told him no- that I was just mad and figured like sual we would just get through it. But this time was different. He actually called me and told me basically that he wasn’t sure how we would work etc and how he wanted his kids to be with his family in Brazil one day.This rocked my world. I have never been in such pain. I couldn’t eat. I lost 15 pounds and would not be able to sleep. It was honestly the lowest I had ever been in fear of losing him. We ended up being okay, but I had so much fear now.

Prior to this I thought we were getting engaged that summer. I thought he was going to propose. Then this, where he wanted to break up. He would tell me how he didn’t but for the first time I wasn’t truly sure if he wanted me. He came back to the states and things were really weird. I remember feeling so bad as I had so much fear he would leave me. I was sad that we weren’t engaged yet too. Then when we went back to college (we go to different colleges) things were still very weird. It was like I wasn’t secure in knowing he wanted me. This made me feel so anxious and freaked out. I felt like I was annoying him being like this. Then on top of this, this was my senior year if college and things were very different on campus. My best friend and old roommate moved off campus and I rarely saw her. My sister who was my current roommate was dating someone on campus and therefore was always with this boyfriend. A lot of my close friends graduated. I felt so insanely alone. I remember eating all alone in my dorm everyday. I felt like a weirdo, a loner, like there was something wrong with me. I had lost my best friend in the car accident and truly just felt like I had no friends to hangout with.

I had my boyfriend to text and call but no one on campus to be with. I have always had issues with worrying about how I appear to the world. I didn’t want to be seen as some girl with no social circle- no friends. So I decided to try to make some friends. I would pray to God to help me make friends. Still nothing- all the girls on campus seemed to have a social circle already. After all, I was a senior and no longer seen as someone who needed to get involved with small groups to make friends. I remember trying so hard to talk to people, but nothing would stick. I’m a relatively quiet person, who has always kinda relied on other people to engage with me to become my friend. So it was weird for me to try to make friends.

I remember one day I was walking to class when some guy that I had seen before introduced himself. He just asked my name and major- the typical stuff people do. Then later that day I saw he added me on Instagram. I accepted this, thinking it was “interesting”. This might sound weird but with men I have always kinda assumed when they do this they have a crush or something, but I also go to a Christian college so I was like “maybe he’s just friendly”.

Anyways, time passed and then one day I posted an Instagram story about a Starbucks drink. Like which one was better and people could vote. I remember he commented saying that neither and that Dunkin was better. I remember being happy that he commented because that meant he was like paying attention to me and remembered me. We started a conversation as I told him that Starbucks was way better. He told me that he had never had Starbucks so I told him we had to go then so he could taste how much better it was than Dunkin. I remember being excited thinking this was my chance to make a friend. I have always had an easier time making friends with men than women. Men are easier to make friends with. Usually if they think you’re cute they will want to be your friend. I figured this was the situation with him. That he probably had a crush on me and that’s why he was talking to me. I thought it was interesting though because on my instagram i have tons of pictures with my boyfriend of us kissing etc. So I wasn’t sure what his intentions were because he clearly saw I had a man.

Then I remember that the next day I was going home for the weekend. I deleted the messages and didn’t text him that weekend because I didn’t want my boyfriend to see and be mad saying I couldn’t talk to him. My boyfriend doesn’t want me to have guy friends and has gotten mad in the past if I texted any guy remotely. Then I got back that week and texted this guy again. He just asked how my weekend was etc. I was excited to have a friend on campus that I could hangout with maybe. Someone that would do things with me so I wasn’t alone. I was hoping he would want to be my friend. I then remember texting him and he asked me what I was up to. I just told him I was bored and studying. He asked if I wanted to study with him. I said sure and went to meet him. I remember getting ready to see him and I put some makeup on because I didn’t want him to think I was ugly and gross and not want to be my friend. I then met with him and we studied. He asked me how my summer was and then I told him how it was awful because of losing my best friend. Then I said how it was awful after that too because of everything with my boyfriend. I think I told him this partially because it was the truth, partially because I wanted him to know I had a boyfriend, ad partially a little subconsciously because I wanted him to want to be my friend and thought maybe he would be more inclined in case he kinda liked me and thought my boyfriend and I were having issues. I didn’t know if he liked me or not (like had a crush) but I just know a lot of my past guy friends secretly had a crush on me as they would admit it later and this was why they wanted to be my friend. I think that’s why i was like “well I really want a friend so even if it’s just a guy being my friend because he secretly has a crush at least I get a friend, I don’t care his intentions as long as I get a friend”. I knew that I didn’t find him attractive and would never want to date him so I didn't think I was doing anything wrong.

I knew I would never break up with my boyfriend for him or ever cross a boundary in my mind that would be cheating such as flirting or anything physical. So I was like “if he kinda has a crush maybe he will want to be my friend more, I can just make sure I never reciprocate that crush and it’s fine”. So then he just kinda told me that he was sorry and I was kinda crying without wanting to but talking about all that made me feel emotional. I felt stupid for being so vulnerable but it was just a very hard thing in my life talking about summer as it was awful and traumatic for me. Then he gave me a hug goodbye I think because he felt bad for me for crying. Anyways he texted me and I apologized for crying and breaking down to him when he barely knew me. He said it was fine and he was glad to be there to try to listen. I remember thinking how he is a Christian and was probably just being nice and felt bad for me.

Then days later he saw me getting coffee on campus and started talking to me. I remember being happy because I had someone to drink coffee with on campus. We talked about random things, I told him about one of my girl friends that he could talk to. He told me about his family etc. He then told me about his celebrity crushes as I asked him what his type was to convince him to like my friend. He then asked me mine. I told him some and I wondered if he was doing this because he liked me or what. I just made sure I didn’t flirt with him in the conversation. Then I asked him if he wanted to get Starbucks after class. He said sure that he would pick me up.

On the way there he just talked about random things like where he was from. He then asked how my boyfriend and I were doing. I told him about some of my concerns. When I reflect I think once again I knew telling him this would possibly make him hope we would break up so he could have a chance, but I knew I would never break up with my boyfriend, so I didn’t think it was wrong. I enjoyed having someone listen to me and give me their attention and feel like they cared for me. I would always tell him some issues and follow it up with “but I love him and can’t let him go”. Because these were true concerns. I just kinda got a little dramatic with them acting like these concerns were more serious to me that they really were because I knew I wanted to be with my man and marry him. I lowkey remember thinking about how part of the reason I had anger with my boyfriend was because I just wanted him to propose already because I just wanted to marry him already. I never questioned if I wanted to be with my boyfriend or not at this time.

Anyways, I once again brought up my girl friend to him to make sure he saw that I was setting him up with someone. I tried to see how he responded with this to see if he denied her indicating he liked me. But he said he liked her. I remember being a little worried that if they started dating though that I would be in the same situation I was in before where he would go hangout with her all the time like my sister with her boyfriend and I would be all alone again with no friends to hangout with. This made me feel sad like I didn't want him to date her then. Not because I wanted to date him, but because if he dated someone then I would not have anyone to hangout with agan. He paid for my coffee which I felt was a little weird but my old guy friend used to do that too. I remember sitting drinking coffee and I spilled some on my hand. He cleaned it off with his finger which I thought was kinda weird. But I remember kinda enjoying that he cared for me. I think I was craving human contact and care so much. I never found him attractive. He was honestly like the furthest thing from my type. He also gave me his jacket as we were leaving because it was freezing. I refused to put it on because I felt like that was restricted for my boyfriend. I just sat it on my hands in the car because I didn;t want to be rude to him.

Anyways, I tried to set him up with another friend too. I remember wanting to have him and my boyfriend meet sometime. I wanted them to maybe become friends one day, I just didn't know how to do so without my boyfriend freaking out that I had a male friend. Anyways, I remember one time we were texting and I sent him the softball roster ( I am on the softball team) and asked him which one he would want me to set him up with. I remember he said none of them were really his type and I was like “hmm maybe he really doesn’t find me attractive, interesting” because most of my guy friends would have been like “I like one of them but she has a man (indicating me). I remember being like “dang maybe I’m ugly” but then I was like no, I don’t want him anyways.

Anyways, I told my boyfriend the following week about everything that happened. I had looked up online if having a guy friend was wrong and people kept saying that keeping it a secret was wrong so that's when I told him. I didn’t want to do anything wrong or hurt my boyfriend. I loved my boyfriend, I just really wanted a friend at this time to hang out with. I also remember thinking that if my boyfriend and I broke up I would never date this friend, but it would be nice to have someone there as a friend to be there for me. This guy friend was very unattractive to me, and when I truly reflect I didn’t even really care about who he was as a person. I didn’t pay attention to what he said or what made him him, I just liked that he paid attention to me.

When I told my boyfriend I immediately stopped being friends with this guy. I noticed that I didn’t care that I was no longer friends with him- like it didn’t hurt me to cut him out of my life at all. i have so much fear because i looked stuff up and it said stuff about cheating. i never in the moment thought i was crossing the line into cheating in my head because I thought i was keeping boundaries so now i am so freaked out. i have been so distraught the past year waking up every morning worried about if i cheated. i have thought about it every second of every day in fear.

Sorry that this is so long. I legit wrote down every thought and detail I had in that time so I am not hiding anything.",1,1746072992.0,TwoHotTakes,2,1.0,False
1kc02k4,https://www.reddit.com/r/polycritical/comments/1kc02k4/dumped_my_gf_now_known_as_a_polyphobic_bigot/,"Dumped my gf, now known as a polyphobic bigot.","Long post I just really need to rant somewhere. 

Full context feels needed here, we were a t4t couple (me trans man 25, her trans woman 21) we dated for 6 months and honestly everything was perfect, im from a small southern town so getting to go with her to these support groups really meant a lot, there was a good poly population but I expected it a little with how the queer community is these days. She started getting coffee with people from the support group and that was one thing, I wanted her to socialize more, but after the third person I realized everyone she was meeting up with was poly. I still ignored my discomfort with it and chalked it up to me actually being polyphobic and that being something I needed to work on.

One of the poly people had a polycule of 9 other transwomen they would call thier wives, they started calling my girlfriend thier ""platonic 
Wife"" (seriously tf is that) and kissed her forehead in front of me. That's where the insecurities really started.

I am much more introverted and bars are barely my scene, still I had no problem going with her every now and then and I never felt any reason to feel insecure about her going with friends for a drink or karaoke. I only recall two times in our 6 months dating she actually got seriously drunk, and she always stayed in safe groups. Again, trust was there never worried.

She met this group of seven other trans women, almost entirely lesbian and poly, and had ""the best night of her life with them"" barhopping until 3am. I was just happy she found community till she told me they would all take turns making out with each other, something my girlfriend assured me she did not participate in but wanted to and found hot. The group even invited a complete stranger into the kissing mix and laughed about him getting scared finding out they were trans and running away, something I found incredibly stupid and dangerous in the current social climate. 

She assured me she was fine with monogamy with me, and that my polyphobia was getting in the way of me liking her friends, and I should go out with them, but I also didn't feel like my issue was stemming from disliking her friends so much as it was I knew I wouldn't be comfortable around situations like that. When I hang out with friends that are a couple and they get too grabby and making out in front of me I do get a little uncomfortable and feel the need to give them privacy, the idea of being at a table with multiple people just taking turns making out amplifies that discomfort to the max. 

I broke things off after she told me she was driving an hour to spend the night at one of the open couples apartment and ""barhop till morning"" and tbh I still can't even tell fully where the line got drawn for me. Was it the barhopping till morning part or me being scared of being cheated on? Probably both. I don't think I would have felt jealous had she not admitted attraction and desire to join when they would kiss, we had our first fight over that and I was still expected to be comfortable with her then spending the night with them after drinking. 

Every one of her friends and the small queer support group I was in now thinks I'm a polyphobic insecure monster that broke this innocent girls heart, thing is they aren't entirely wrong, being bisexual I've had nothing but negative and hardcore boundary pushing experiences and I'm working on not having my guard up around every swinger or poly person I meet. It's just not me, and I've had too many people in my life try to make it me.
 
I loved her. We honestly had the healthiest relationship of my life until the barhopping with this poly crowd started and my insecurities grew too strong. I know I did the right thing in breaking up, she made it clear she loves this crowd and isn't gonna stop going out with them, and I don't think it would be healthy for me to keep her from them. I just don't think im the kind of guy that can just sit at home and wait for my gf to get back from her 3rd bar safely, but that's amplified by the fact that she's surrounded by sexual activity im uncomfortable with that she's actively enjoying. I've had to just chalk it up to incompatibility.

But still, her friends, coworkers, everyone despises me now for breaking it off, they said she was fully loyal and they all communicated boundaries and that I needed to work on my ignorance and grow up, but I still feel I made the right call. I truly thought she kept better company.",1,1746072982.0,polycritical,0,1.0,False

I looked at it and am freaking myself out! So, I did not know that I was going to have blood work done, so around 9 I ate a greek yogurt bowl with granola and chocolate chips. I also had some coffee with non-dairy creamer and a little bit of sugar. My bloodwork was done around 10:40. My glucose was 71mg/dL. This was the lowest number in the ""normal"" range. My insulin test was 18.4, which is considered high. The normal range is 4-13.1. My LH/TSH ratio was about 1.5, which I read online could be a sign of mild PCOS. My vitamin D was 30, again, lowest on the normal range. Cortisol, prolactin, CBC, TSH were all normal. I have not gotten my testosterone back yet. I have also not heard back from my Dr. yet. 

I have irregular periods, sometimes a few black hairs on the side of my face, but other than that, I do not think I have any other symptoms of PCOS. I had an ultrasound and there were no cysts seen. I do not really know if any of these are a cause for concern, seeing as though my blood work was not done fasting. 

I am 20 years old, 5'5 and about 179lbs 

I am not asking anyone to diagnose me, but if anyone has had a similar situation and had any answers, I would really appreciate it! I know I shouldn't worry until the doctor calls me to discuss results, but I am really impatient and lowkey have health anxiety lol",1,1746072937.0,PCOS,0,1.0,False

Back in college, we bonded over music — I mentored her when she was learning to DJ — and we stayed lightly in touch on social media for a few years. In February, she invited me to a pregame at her place, and I realized I had feelings for her. I thought she had a boyfriend, so I told her I didn’t want to keep spending time together without being honest about how I felt.

She told me she was newly single and wanted to stay that way for a while, but liked hanging out and wanted to stay friends. After that, she started texting and DMing me more often than ever. A few weeks later, we hung out — just the two of us — and it really felt like a date. We visited museums and coffee shops, she opened up about deep and vulnerable topics, she asked several questions about my views on relationships, she complimented things like my eyes and emotional intelligence, and we drew each other. It was one of the best days I’ve had, and truthfully the strongest connection I’ve felt with a girl this early. But when she opened up, she explained that she feels like she can’t trust men after her last relationships, and like she dives into new relationships too quickly and loses her self (basically it sounds like she’s avoidant). 

A few days after I suggested we hang out again, she pulled away. Then suddenly, she unfollowed me on everything — no explanation. It was confusing and hurtful, especially given our the fact that I had mentored her— I wasn’t just a guy from hinge. Two days later, a burner Instagram account with no posts or followers started watching all my stories — and still does, nearly every day, sometimes several times. I’m almost certain it’s her. It doesn’t follow anyone and doesn’t act like a typical spam bot; it literally just watches my stories.

Mutual friends think she liked me but wasn’t ready and panicked. I don’t know what to think. I feel weird being watched silently. I still believe we could be very compatible if she healed — but I also feel hurt and unsure if she ever really cared. Should I block the burner and move on, or let her watch and leave the door open?",1,1746072080.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

**My (28F) best friend (27M) has been lying to me for 7 years. I feel like I'm in some weird soap opera and have no clue how to end this.**

**Originally posted to r/relationship_advice**

[Original Post](https://web.archive.org/web/20250423070630/https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k51wnl/my_28f_best_friend_27m_has_been_lying_to_me_for_7/)  **Apr 23, 2025**

I'm struggling with figuring out how to start this, so I guess I'll just start with context. Obligatory apology for mobile and long post, I'll try to keep it semi brief but there's a lot. I, F28, have been friends with ""Blake"" 28M for about 10 years now. We met when I was traveling for a new job out of state, and I kid you not immediately became best friends in the week that I was there. Same interests, great energy and conversation, we just clicked.

We were friends for nearly 2 years before trying the dating thing. It lasted 3 months (important), during which Blake did not treat me well due to unresolved issues from prior relationships. Before I could end it, he decided to end it himself as he had feelings for someone else. Fine with me, we were *clearly* better as friends. I took some space because he hadn't been treating me well, he got into therapy and apologized for being sh*tty, and was willing to put in the work to regain my trust for our friendship. Which he did, consistently, over the 8 years since.

Fast forward to now -- I'm now happily married to my wonderful husband Kam (28M, together for 6 years, married for ~2 years). Blake and I are still best friends; he and his ex after our brief dating stint broke up, and he is now with a wonderful woman ""Kaylie"" (21F) for almost 2 years now (started dating a few months before my wedding, this is important). Kaylie and I are also good friends, she's the sweetest person. Blake also lives in the same city as me now after his mother passed, having moved down here for a better support network; his girlfriend moved in about 9 months ago.

In the past 6 months or so, things have been strained with Blake. My husband is very introverted, and Blake started voicing frustration about his inability to be closer friends with Kam and feeling like he bothers Kam. He and I also started having weird tiffs (kind of subtle negs/belittling comments/etc). Then my husband and I came over to a game night for Blake's birthday 3 months ago, during which Blake picked fights with me about very weird things (for example my career path and how I'm going about it wrong, making comments like ""I guess if you want to stunt yourself in life, you can do it that way,"" etc). Both my Kam and I were caught very off guard, and after several attempts to shut it down, made excuses and headed home.

Later, Blake proceeded to send me a text asking if I was okay bc the vibes felt off. To which I was like ""uh no kidding"", and explained my issue. He decided to reply with...an email (who uses email anymore???). 8 long paragraphs about how he felt he and his experience/knowledge was dismissed in our discussion, how he felt ganged up on when Kam would defend my side, and how he felt like he can't be himself around me and Kam anymore. He also made comments voicing that he didn't feel like he could trust me bc I tell Kam everything (not true, I always ask before sharing unless it's a danger or moral issue) and that he thinks I'm unhealthily codependent on Kam because whenever Blake and I hang out 1x1 I'm always calling to let Kam know how late I'll be out or check if I'm cool to pick up takeout (we're married with joint finances, sue me?).

I replied trying to clarify my end as well as understand where the everloving hell this all was coming from, but no matter how many times I tried, we kept going in circles. The emailing back and forth, during which he demanded we not meet up till this was resolved, lasted till about 2 weeks ago, when I said I needed time to think about how to reply next. About a month ago I got into therapy bc it was seriously messing with my head and making me feel like I was a problem and like I couldn't talk to anyone about this bc we share much of our support system.

I finally broke down to my sister when she came over to see why I hadn't been answering her (or really anyone, yay anxiety) lately. She is also friends with Blake through me. I let her read the emails, and she got pretty ticked on my behalf, and then proceeded to drop a helluva bombshell on me and Kam: *Blake is APPARENTLY ""still in love with me"" and hates Kam's guts.*

Apparently, when she drove to pick up Blake out of state for our wedding (he was a groomsman) he ""confided"" in her and her husband that he didn't agree with the wedding and wished I would break up with Kam and give him another chance. That we're soulmates and Kam isn't the one for me. Blake has heard me talk since day one about how happy Kam makes me and how safe and loved I feel with him. My sister shut it down, but, EVEN BETTER, Blake proceeded to do the same thing when she drove him *back home* after our wedding! He ended off saying he just needed some time, so my sister kept her mouth shut bc she knew that he's my best friend and hoped she could trust him to resolve it over time since he lived far away.

Blake then moved near me about a year ago, and Kaylie moved in the August after. My husband's and my wedding anniversary is in October, and apparently Blake *called my sister's husband* to, AGAIN, confide that he's still in love with me and wishes I would divorce Kam bc he would be a better husband to me. While LIVING with Kaylie, who he's told me is his soulmate. This was about when all the stress started, so she never found a good moment to bring it up.

As if to ice the cake, Kaylie and I have been keeping up via text thru all this (again, we're friends). During the past few weeks, I learned some odd things:

• Kaylie got new piercings, reportedly encouraged by Blake to do so bc ""she'd look so cute"": a double nose piercing and septum, which *possibly coincidentally* Blake took me to get as a post-wedding gift 2 years ago.

• Blake apparently ""has beef with"" the month of August and so has decided their anniversary will be in *October.* The reason he gave was because ""it's spooky month"", but Kam and I started dating AND got married that month. I also, at my sister's prompt, went back and checked when Blake and I broke up -- August 2017. Again, *possibly coincidental,* but feels very odd as I don't know why else he would have an issue with that month.

It's also worth noting Blake had another relationship fall apart because the girl was outright convinced Blake was cheating on her with me to the point of blasting me for weeks as some homewrecker. Kam and I always chalked it up to her insecurity, but now I'm wondering if she was just watching Blake carry on some weird, one-sided emotional affair. I love my husband more than words can say, and he makes me happier than anyone I've ever met -- he's my ultimate best friend. Learning all this has made me feel so gross and like a horrible wife, though Kam has been wonderfully supportive and doesn't blame me at all.

All this to say, I'm ending our friendship, but have no clue how. I feel like I have to tell Kaylie as this has all happened during their relationship and living together and the woman deserves the world, but also recognize I have no real proof beyond spoken accounts besides the weird emails -- it sounds like some wild conspiracy theory or soap opera. My therapist is on vacation so I'm on my own after learning all this. I'm also realizing just how manipulative Blake has been for YEARS given this context, and already feel shaky about confronting him given my serious confrontation anxiety, which he knows about and could easily try to exploit. I'm realizing more and more that he has massive control issues that I dismissed as anxiety for years. The fact that he lives so close now fills me with dread rather than joy.

I want to come out of this with no regrets, knowing I stood up for myself, and that I put a decisive end to this. I want Blake to know his actions and creepy ulterior motives are the reason our decade long friendship is dead. I've never ended a friendship myself (also a bit of an introvert), and this is basically friend-breakup on steroids. How do I break this lunacy to Kaylie in a way that sounds remotely believeable given the front Blake has built? I also would love some advice on how to go about telling Blake I know everything and we're absolutely done.

**ADDITIONAL INFO FROM OOP**

>So, I'm working right now and not replying to other comments till later due to time constraints, but thought some clarifications could do well given this comment. 

>1) There is no sexual past. Blake and I did not sleep together, again this was only a 3 month relationship. Not everyone ""hooks up"", the most we ever did was kiss a few times upon visiting due to long distance, and again, this was 8 years ago.

>2) This isn't the only friend I've briefly dated that I'm still in touch with. Hell, Kam actually DOES have close friend that he also dated back when he was in college for about 6 months as well; she and I are reslly close as well, and Kam and I are godparents to her child. Genuinely, both of us are very secure in our relationship and don't take issue with it. We're also both into all genders, so opposite sex doesn't really mean much to us for friendships. It's all just people.

>3) My sister and I are in talks over this, I didn't feel it relevant to include in post but will here. I let her know how upset I was over her keeping this from me, and she broke down apologizing for it and recognizes she messed up. She also has severe anxiety, and thought it had resolved until the second time Blake reached out to her husband, during which time she was going through a lot herself personally. She was intending to tell me next we spoke around the time I fell off communicating from the stress of it all. We're working thru this separately.

>As for your summary, having gotten a restraining order on a different ex, its not very easy to get one. I will definitely if I have to, but jumping straight to that doesn't seem feasible. The cop scare tactic is definitely not a bad idea to keep in my pocket though, thank you. 

>As for your frankly polarizing view on myself and my marriage, I didn't come here to ask for advice or opinions on my marriage. My husband has been amazing and very adamant that I know he is mad at Blake for being a creepy lying jerk and not me. He knows full well that I have eyes only for him and never once doubted that before nor after all this. You can think whatever you want of me or my marriage, but I did want to throw that out there. The feeling like a terrible wife I mentioned is because I feel like I've been blind this whole time, especially as I fully acknowledge how cliche this all sounds. Whether that's true or not, I know my marriage is solid and secure, and I in no way ""spat"" in anyone's face.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/T5hK1b3sbp)  **Apr 24, 2025 (Next Day)**

Well, I was definitely not expecting to be making an update/follow up post when I made my original post. Admittedly, my original post blew up far more than I ever anticipated. I've made many posts on various accounts and subreddits over the years, including this one, and typically I get a handful of kindhearted redditors' input before it dies into obscurity lol, so this was definitely new to me. I'm endlessly thankful for all the wonderful people who offered comments of care, support, and advice -- some of the comments were so invaluable and I can't thank you all enough. 

I did decide to delete the original post, largely to protect my peace as it was surprisingly anxiety-inducing to have half a million views on one of the most surreal moments of my life, and partially as protection as there were many specific details that could easily be identified if seen by someone who knows the details IRL.

For those who didn't see, TLDR (as best as I can, at least): I, 28F, am married to my husband ""Kam"" (28M) for about 2 years, together for 6. ""Blake"" (27M) and I have been best friends for about 10 years. 8 years ago, Blake and I briefly tried the dating thing for about 3 months before things ended, overall due to Blake being toxic/not treating me well and his having feelings for someone else. We stepped back from each other but wanted to remain friends, Blake went to therapy, apologized for how things went with us and how he treated me, and committed to working on being a better friend. He outwardly did so in the years following, and we maintained our friendship. Blake is now with ""Kaylie"" (21F), for almost 2 years.

Recently Blake and I started having weird little tiffs, and when Kam and I went to Blake's birthday game night, Blake started criticizing me during our conversations over very weird things, such as my career and how I'm going about it, etc. After Kam and I left, I got a text from Blake asking why the vibes were off, and I voiced the issue. Blake responded with a long email about how he felt dismissed, tread on, disrespected, etc.

This turns into nearly 4 months of emailing back and forth and self isolation from the anxiety of it all, during which I started therapy. I finally talked to my sister about it, who revealed that on the way to and from my wedding Blake had told her that he was still in love with me, disagreed with the marriage, and wished I'd give him another chance, etc. He then said he just needed time to process, so my sister didn't disclose this to me when it happened, thinking he'd move on (she agrees this was not the best move, but we're okay). 

She then discloses that Blake did the same thing on my wedding anniversary in October, reaching out to her husband with the same ""concerns"". She was going to tell me at the time, but life blew up (as life does). By the time she was able to do so, I wasn't talking to much of anyone. When she told me and Kam this, in addition to other sketchy details I recently learned from Kaylie, I immediately knew I was ending the friendship because he clearly saw us as or wanted something more.

For those concerned about my husband in all this: Kam knew about my and Blake's dating stint from the start. Kam also has friends who he has similarly dated -- this is not an issue for us (despite Reddit's objections) and he has been aware and involved in everything that's happened, both in my OG post and this update and beyond. My husband found y'all's negative comments absolutely hilarious, and told me to tell any who are concerned ""I love and trust my wife and if someone has an issue with it, that's a you problem, bucko.""


Now that that's aside...the update:

I decided to talk to Kaylie after all. I asked to meet up and treated her to coffee and pastries, and then disclosed everything I knew. She listened, even reaching over to hold my hand when she saw me shaking, and thanked me for telling her. In short, she has decided to stay with Blake for now, but is moving forward with this in mind -- as is her right to decide. She wants to stay friends with me, and fully understands that I want nothing to do with Blake and why (as well as to not share any info about me with him), and that there'll be some distance for a bit.

This is where y'all might yell at me... but I did confront Blake in person. This was mostly due to the fact that I wanted to get it out of the way right after talking to Kaylie without raising alarm bells, and meeting up under the guise of talking it out in person was the easiest way to do that. My husband went with me, though the conversation was just between Blake and myself. I took several safety precautions as well, such as secretly recording the interaction.

Initially, Blake started in on classic DARVO, saying he didn't remember saying those things to my sister etc, and then remembered certain things but ""in different contexts"". He even tried spinning it back on me several times. I shut all that down as well as any excuses/justifications given, and firmly landed my point that regardless of intent or reasoning, his actions are wildly inappropriate and inexcusable. After dismantling enough of the excuses, he actually offered several apologies owning up to his actions. Whether he meant them or not, I don't know nor care, but it was semi-cathartic for sure. He insists everything with Kaylie is coincidental, but either way that is between them at this point.

The conversation ended with him saying he didn't want to lose our friendship. That he was willing to take a friendship break for a bit, establish better/firmer boundaries. That he feels he's in a better place to be more honest. That now, he was aware of the issue and would pay more care in not breaking my boundaries. I shut him down, saying that ship sailed long ago, and it shouldn't have to take me saying ""I'm done"" for him to put effort into respecting me. He then said he'd respect my decision to end our friendship, but begged me to at least keep an open mind at possible future reconciliation. I was pretty much done at this point and told him flat out that these are the consquences of his own actions, that I can never trust anything he says or does ever again, and that even IF in some alternate universe I *was* open to that, he would be an acquaintance, and certainly would never *ever* be my best or even close friend again.

He went quiet and teary-eyed after this, I assume because he knew things were coming to a close. I stood up, he asked me for one last hug. I said no, reached out to shake his hand, and left without looking back. Which felt kind of badass...until I got down the block and round the corner and had the panic attack that had been looming all day lol. Win some, lose some. 

Overall though, I think this went as well as it could have. I'm not letting my guard down yet, juuuuuuust in case, but it's a relief that it's finally (seemingly) resolved. Admittedly, I'm not doing....great, but I know I will be okay. Kam helped me realize I'm basically mourning the death of a decade-long friend; while Blake himself may not be dead, the Blake I knew is, so I'm trying to give myself some grace in processing through this. Kam has decided tonight is reserved for tacos, cake, and video games together for some dopamine, and we're both calling into work tomorrow after this chaos. 😂.

Thank you again to all those who offered kindness and support on my last post. I don't think I would have had nearly the confidence and composure I had today if not for you all. May your pillow always be nice and cold, your food the perfect temperature, and your life full of joy and peace. 🩵.

>Block him and don't look back

**OOP**

>>I very much did. The funniest thing is I was almost starting to feel a little bad afterwards; he verbally acknowledged and took accountability for much of what happened by the end of the conversation, and while I wasn't regretting my decision, I was feeling a bit guilty for going scorched earth that fast and wondered if things could have improved had I not.

>>Until I got an email this morning bc the jerk made a whole new email account to reach out to me from because ""he figured I blocked him but he had some things to say"". I opened it out of curiosity, and it's (I shit you not) 12 paragraphs about ""his side of the story"". During which he tried to explain/DARVO/gaslight it all away, said things he already admitted to and apologized for never happened, that he was never in love with me in the first place so he wouldn't say that, etc. Everything directly counteracts every apology or admission of guilt during our (recorded lol) conversation, so I know damn well he's not actually sorry or remotely grown from that confrontation. Really reinforced my decision for me lmfao. 😂.

I think a lot of it is that we are just different. I notice she likes to just stay home and does not really do much. I think this is largely driven by her inability to get a drivers license - almost everything is out of her purview. 

She doesnt want to challenge herself to try new things, everything is scary , or she needs more time (which means never). 

I feel depressed at this point trying to get her to do things because 70% of the time shes not interested and its a BUZZ KILL trying to get someone to do things - am i wrong for thinking this? Are men supposed to work this hard and thats how it is?

  
I would DIE for her to one day after i had a long day or in just a 'blah' mood to be like hey lets go do xyz but never, shes just there. she just exists until i say we should do something, and unless its something she likes like going to a bookstore or going to get coffee, its a hassle. 

  
i notice no matter what i ask on here, people just say basically this poor young girl is a victim to your oppression and needs to be set free. 

  
i tried for years to get her to go live separately with other girls her age, nothing. wont engage the idea. i tried everything, i try everything to motivate her to get us going, but i notice if i want to live a life i want to, productive trying to get better every day i have to treat it like shes an obstacle, but at that point its like i feel like shes a lesser person and just totally turned off by someone who is content just sitting at home doing nothing. 

why does everyone say age gap is the problem? theres way more to it. what do you think of a young women not willing to challenge herself to get her drivers license and how much it holds her back in life. we dont live in NY dont even start with the ""you dont need a car"". you do.

## Key Features Analysis

The Coffee Filter 23x9 offers several noteworthy features that contribute to its overall performance and user experience.

**Dimensions:** Precisely sized at 23 inches in width and 9 inches in depth, these filters are specifically engineered to fit 10-gallon commercial coffee brewers.

The Exact measurements ensure a secure fit within the brewing basket, preventing coffee grounds from escaping into the brewed coffee. This precise sizing is critical for maintaining the purity and clarity of the final product.

**Material Composition:** Typically crafted from high-quality, heavy-duty paper, these filters are designed to withstand the weight and pressure of brewing 10 gallons of coffee.

The Material is often bleached or unbleached, depending on the preference of the user. Bleached filters offer a cleaner, brighter appearance, while unbleached filters are often preferred for their more natural and environmentally friendly properties. The paper is also designed to be porous enough to allow for optimal extraction while still effectively trapping coffee grounds.

**Wet Strength:** These filters boast exceptional wet strength, preventing tearing or disintegration during the brewing process.

The Wet strength is achieved through the use of specialized paper manufacturing techniques and additives that enhance the paper's resistance to moisture. This is crucial for ensuring that the filter remains intact throughout the entire brewing cycle, even when subjected to the weight of saturated coffee grounds and hot water.

**Filtration Capacity:** Designed to handle large volumes of coffee grounds, these filters effectively remove sediment and oils, resulting in a cleaner, smoother cup of coffee.

The Filtration capacity is enhanced by the filter's thickness and pore size, which are carefully calibrated to optimize the balance between extraction and filtration. This ensures that the coffee retains its desired flavor profile while minimizing the presence of unwanted particles.

**Biodegradability:** Many manufacturers offer biodegradable options, making these filters an environmentally conscious choice.

The Biodegradable filters are typically made from sustainably sourced paper and are designed to decompose naturally in composting environments. This is an increasingly important consideration for businesses that are committed to reducing their environmental impact.

**Quantity and Packaging:** Typically sold in bulk quantities, these filters are packaged to ensure convenient storage and dispensing.

The Packaging often includes features such as resealable bags or dispenser boxes to protect the filters from moisture and damage. The bulk packaging also helps to reduce waste and minimize the frequency of reordering.

Key features of the Coffee Filter 23x9 include:
  * High-quality paper construction
  * Precise dimensions for 10-gallon brewers
  * Exceptional wet strength
  * Effective filtration capacity
  * Biodegradable options available
  * Convenient bulk packaging

## Core Benefits

**Consistent Coffee Quality:** Using the correct filter size and material ensures consistent extraction and prevents coffee grounds from seeping into the final brew. This leads to a more uniform and predictable coffee flavor, which is crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction.

The Use of a 23x9 filter in a 10-gallon brewer eliminates the inconsistencies that can arise from using smaller or ill-fitting filters. This translates to a more reliable and enjoyable coffee experience for consumers.

**Reduced Sediment:** The filter's design and material effectively trap fine coffee particles, resulting in a cleaner, smoother cup of coffee. This is particularly important for commercial settings where high volumes of coffee are being produced and served.

The Reduction in sediment enhances the overall drinking experience and can also improve the appearance of the coffee, making it more appealing to customers. Cleaner coffee also reduces the risk of clogging in brewing equipment, leading to lower maintenance costs.

**Minimized Downtime:** The filter's wet strength and durability prevent tearing or collapsing during the brewing process, minimizing the risk of spills and downtime. This is essential for busy cafes and restaurants where efficient coffee production is critical.

The Prevention of filter failures ensures that brewing operations can continue smoothly without interruption. This can save valuable time and resources, as well as prevent potential customer dissatisfaction.

**Cost Savings:** By preventing coffee grounds from escaping and ensuring efficient extraction, these filters can help reduce coffee waste and optimize coffee usage. This can lead to significant cost savings over time, especially for businesses that brew large quantities of coffee daily.

The Optimized extraction also means that less coffee is needed to achieve the desired strength and flavor, further contributing to cost savings. Additionally, the durability of the filters reduces the need for frequent replacements, further minimizing expenses.

**Enhanced Workflow Efficiency:** The precise dimensions and easy-to-use design of these filters simplify the brewing process, allowing staff to quickly and efficiently prepare large batches of coffee. This is particularly beneficial during peak hours when speed and efficiency are paramount.

The Improved workflow efficiency allows staff to focus on other tasks, such as customer service and food preparation. This can lead to a more productive and profitable operation overall.

## FAQs Section

**Is the Coffee Filter 23x9 compatible with all 10-gallon coffee brewers?**
  While designed for standard 10-gallon commercial brewers, it's crucial to verify the specific dimensions required by your brewer model. Some brewers may have slightly different basket sizes, so double-checking is always recommended.

**How often should the Coffee Filter 23x9 be replaced?**
  The filter should be replaced after each brewing cycle to ensure optimal filtration and prevent flavor contamination. Reusing filters can lead to bitter or stale-tasting coffee.

**Are there different types of Coffee Filter 23x9 available (e.g., bleached vs. unbleached)?**
  Yes, both bleached and unbleached options are typically available. Bleached filters are treated with chlorine or oxygen to achieve a brighter white color, while unbleached filters retain their natural brown hue. The choice between the two often comes down to personal preference and environmental considerations.

**Where can I dispose of used Coffee Filter 23x9 filters?**
  If you are using biodegradable filters, they can be composted in a commercial composting facility or, in some cases, in a home composting system. Non-biodegradable filters should be disposed of in the regular trash.

Fall of the Cabal, upgrade, I saw the famous NJ Drones","Fall of the Cabal dubbed as anti-semitic, it a fact laden must see what's behind the curtains. With AIPAC facts coming to light, it is important to see this series and it's lengthy sequel. I don't agree with everything said, nor the one sided approach. But it does point out the participants of the [deep state](http://we-are-canceled.byethost33.com/index_files/NWONA.html) and a chunk of their agenda. If you search for Fall of the Cabal on google, you won't find it. One must use a less censored search engine like Duck Duck Go or Yandex. It can be found on Rumble and Odyssey.  
  
I got me some major hardware upgrades. Went from 14 year old overheating Dell e6420 with 4 cores 8 threads, to a 2017 Dell 5050 sff, with only 4 cores but double and faster ram, a Sabrent 2TB m.2 card (which came in remarkably classy packaging) and finally the ability to utilize my 4TB Hitachi sata drive. Also got an ASUS VPU28U 28"" monitor from Craigslist and Creative Pebble Plus speakers for sound. The monitor is 4k IPS but only 60hz. Perfect for shoestring home theater. The speakers rival my step dad's old Technique stereo speakers in sound but not volume. I only have my bedroom to fill up and with my low pain threshold for sound, plenty, plenty. Apart from the Dell, I couldn't be happier with my purchases.  
The Dell's Intel drivers are miscoloring this very webpage to a noticeable degree. It should look like a creamed coffee not nicotine. Also the diver conflicted with Brave browser, but fortunately several days effort between me, Grok and Reddit got that solved. Had to rename the brave.exe to chrome.exe. Have a Radeon R7 430 GDDR5 2GB on the way.  
When my backpay arrives, I can keep the drives, speakers and monitor and migrate to either AM4 or AM5. Step by step, part by part, I will build a new machine, a more powerful machine, one that can actual satisfy my needs. Already Youbtube seems faster and I think that was mostly ram, but disk speed and better graphics also help. I'm also keen on my primary monitor's position.  
  
I'm on the fence about tariffs. They are making us poor folks on social security pay more when our income is so low that we already don't pay income tax. Coda adjustments are a joke and inflation isn't. But yet, it is a national security issue not to rely on any but the closest allies both in agreeance on policy/ideals as well as geographically. Relying on China for basic otc's mean they dry up at China's whim. I had a hard time finding Aspirin last year. Silicon is even more important. Clothing less so.  
Tariffs are encouraging local manufacture as well as opening up foreign markets to the fine goods we make which were unfairly tariffed in the first place. The free hand of the market is not fair hand. The free hand always tips the scales. Corporation, namely healthcare, colludes to keep prices high. Officials are indirectly bribed to favor companies, not the people. Countries subside industries to get competitive edges. In is from these fact our government needs to protect us from. Under Trump, looks like we are heading the right way, but congress remains a swamp and the deep bureaucracy still needs more pruning.

Saw the drones on a Saturday night on my way to the store. It was partly cloudy, clouds at about 1,000 ft or less. At first, from the corner of my eye, it looked like a rocket or satellite burning up coming in. But when I looked at it proper, there were 5 pairs of two large lights, the same color as sodium arc lights once burned in. They were moving too slow to be airplanes, too controlled to be balloons. The looked too small to be helicopters and had no flashers nor navigational lights. They were coming from the west and then in a disorganized fashion turned north. I couldn't see their lights illuminating the clouds, implying large lights rather than bright. The orange light disappeared as they turned revealing a single small read taillight. What ever they were, they seemed terrestrial of origin and not FAA compliant.  
  
Watched Sanctuary. Executive produced by and starring Amanda Tapping of SG-1 fame. It was a good watch. Synopsis: Monsters and myths are real, they seek to protect from the baddies and protect the good ones. CGI was a bit week, but the characters were most compelling. Bingable. Also saw Westworld, and while it had an impressive start with stellar special effects, I found the last season a challenge to finish watching. Loving the new season of Doctor Who. I'm saving Andor for May the Fourth.

I don't recall names, but I do know the episodes were pretty short, usually no more than a few minutes at most. 

I recall one episode, where the cat guy came home super buff, grabbed his roommate, and took him upstairs in some kind of roid rage thing while the Deer played coy about it.

I actually phoned him to ask him to just give me a verbal correction because the group chat comes across the wrong way.  Next day our boss brought it up in site meeting that they don’t need to see our mistakes in group chats and to be amicable, get along and remember I’m a a newbie and the other guy is a second year and site super is the vet and just talk to eachother directly.  Dude made himself look bad but now he’s taking it out on me. Totally flipped a switch. Stonewalled.  Left out of the dude chats.  Given little to no direction. Broom pusher.  I tried to keep things light. Give him the benefit of the doubt. Brought them coffees.  Then I had to leave work like 30 minutes early due to my kid getting locked out of the house while my super was at the store. Told the other guy. My actually GC boss called and I told him, no problem at all.  Super texts me 15 minutes later angry that I didn’t get his permission first. Ffs. I’m almost 40. Like this is childish.  I send him proof that I had to go home to get my kid in. He just gives me a thumbs up and power trips that I need to tell him before taking off early.  No way in hell he would say this to his bro, second year buddy.  I just say Got it.  But not sitting well with me so I just try again to say I really want to enjoy being at work, get along and feel included and that I thought they were both good guys and I hope we can squash whatever awkwardness is going on.  Nope, he proceeds to give me a massive lecture on me not doing a good enough job anticipating his job site needs and that I need to smile more and so on and so forth.

I tried to quit this morning.  My GC boss persuaded me to stay on. Says I don’t have to work with that guy anymore.  I’m so emotionally and mentally exhausted from the whiplash.  He’s like you just have to leave your feelings at the door.  But this feels like hostile work environment and I don’t want to play the “girl” card but like being treated shitty cuz I’m not a bro.

Unlimited coffee bombed, coworking seats worked, breakfast kits exploded, and a once-a-month beans box became easy money. Now we clear a little over eleven grand in predictable revenue every month.

# 1 The flop: Unlimited coffee

* Price: 30 USD per month, drink all you want
* Result: three sign-ups after three weeks
* Why it failed: guests saw zero novelty, and heavy coffee drinkers were already loyal

**Lesson:** If the offer feels stale, nobody bites.

# 2 The pivot: Coworking pass

* Price: 45 USD per month
* Perks: unlimited coffee **plus** reserved seat outside lunch rush
* Outcome: thirty-five members → ≈ 1.6 K MRR
* Hidden win: laptops everywhere made the café look busy, boosting walk-ins (and forty percent of those members buy lunch)

**Lesson:** Pair a basic perk with a behavior benefit to crank up perceived value.

# 3 The breakout: Daily breakfast kit

* Target: office workers in a hurry
* Price: 75 USD per month, grab-and-go breakfast every weekday
* Outcome: one-hundred-twenty-five subs → ≈ 5.6 K MRR
* Why it clicked
   * Refer-a-coworker earns a free month (Office groups grow fast)
   * Breakfast is already a daily habit, now prepaid
   * Fixed portions slashed waste and stress

# 4 The easy add-on: Specialty beans box

* Format: curated bag of premium beans, pick-up once a month
* Price: about 50 USD
* Outcome: ≈ 4 K MRR for maybe two staff-hours of work

# Fast takeaways

* Test fast, kill fast
* Stack value, not just product
* Build around existing routines
* Mix daily and monthly plans for labor balance
* A busy café floor is silent marketing

Recently he’s been choosing my tea and coffee over his cup of water- my coffee is not caffeine free and so I usually use a lid. The black tea is caffeine sugar free but I still worry, when he started choosing my tea I started making him tea diluting it with 50% water….we’re on two weeks of this. 

I’m sure this is terrible I just don’t know how else to keep him out of my cup. One positive is he’s drinking a tonnnnn of liquid. ",7,1746070672.0,cats,0,1.0,False

So far we've run multiple descaling cycles, cleaning cycles and cleaned the screen up inside the machine. 
It's very sporadic, sometimes we get a bit of coffee, sometimes we get absolutely nothing from either spout. 
Does anyone have anything else we can maybe try without voiding the warranty at all? 
Our beans are quite oily but we do keep up with cleaning, grind is set on 4 and we almost always have cappuccino's. Machine makes 1-2 coffees a day so not huge use at all. I am currently waiting on some supergrindz to arrive as we can't get it in Australia but I'm hesitant to use it before it goes away as it is not a Jura product.

I have to be in Taipei to renew my passport.  I'll be a bit pressed for time, though, because I have to get back to teach in the mid-afternoon.  I'm looking for coffee and Western food while I'm there (I have all the Taiwanese and franchise/chain options where I live, but precious few Western ones).  Ideally, I'd like to combine the coffee and food into one stop, so I'm hoping for a Western-style restaurant that knows the value of both, but I'll take what I can get.

Brunch - something along the lines of Supranormal or The Antipodean would be great, but both of those will be too far out for this trip (yes, even Supranormal's Chifeng location).

Lunch - I haven't had an authentic burger in ages, but I'll also take a good sandwich, pasta--anything, really--so long as the food is authentic and it's a casual restaurant and not ridiculously expensive.  (As a backup plan, though, I might have to eat at Taipei Main Station because of time constraints, so I'm curious if there's anything decent available there.)

Coffee - specialty coffee only, offering good espresso or iced coffee (cold brew, iced drip, iced pourover are all okay).  Not dark roasted, so something light to medium-light.

**Situation:** I hired an electrician to do a handful of updates to my house earlier this year. one of the jobs was to add recessed light to my sitting room. This room has an 20 amp circuit with 12 gauge wire to all outlets, but no ceiling light. This electrician decide to use 14 gauge wire for the light he added. He hid the recessed light addition from the permit he pulled so it was never inspected. I only found out about it a couple months later because another electrician I hired told me I have 14 gauge wire to the light on my 20 amp circuit and is not code compliant. 

I ended up having to get on a call with the city inspector and it turns out he basically filed a fake permit for the work and did not get anything inspected (instead of adding light fixtures, he described the work as replacing light figures so no wire inspection was done). after the call, city inspector made the electrician to comeback to clean up his work.  However, instead of replacing the 14 gauge wire with 12 gauge wire, he just swapped my circuit breaker from 20 amp to 15 amp. He has schedule an inspection next week. 

**My ask**: how can I deal with this slimy electrician so that he does the right thing and replace the wrong wire he installed instead of downgrading my circuit from 20 amp to 15 amp? 

I want my living room to have 20 amp circuit because (1) I might want to put a coffee corner in there with a kettle and espresso machine and I want to keep my 20 amp breaker (2) I want him to own his mistake

Will the inspector let him slide with this because he swapped out my 20 amp breaker with a 15 amp breaker? Is there anything I could tell the inspector to force the electrician fix the wrong wires he put in?

I’ve been there nearly eight years. Things have been quiet since the divorce. I keep my head down, do my work, don’t socialize much beyond nods and hallway small talk.

About a month ago, they brought in a new guy. I won’t name him, obviously, but he’s mid-30s maybe? Soft voice, very polite, the kind of person who laughs a little too long when someone makes a bad joke. I didn’t think much of him at first — I barely interacted with him.

But then I started noticing something strange. He’d mention things I hadn’t said. Small things. I’d think about how I needed to grab coffee after work — not say it, just think it — and he’d comment, “Rough sleep last night?” Or I’d scroll through some old vacation photos on my phone, and the next morning he’d mention that region like it came up in casual conversation. Not directly. Just close enough to make me pause.

It’s never overt. Never enough to accuse. Once, I typed out a draft email to my ex (never sent it), and two days later this guy asked, “Ever feel like some people wait to misunderstand you?” Word for word from the email I never sent. I don’t even remember saving it.

He doesn’t look at me much. But I’ll catch him across the office, glancing my way, like he’s trying to gauge something. Sometimes I’ll come back from the restroom and find my chair slightly off-angle. My pens rearranged. It’s subtle. It could be nothing. But I know how I leave things.

I haven’t talked to HR. I haven’t even mentioned it to anyone in the office. It sounds petty when I say it out loud — and I don’t feel afraid, exactly. Just… observed. Like someone is studying my patterns and adjusting theirs just slightly around me.

Am I overreacting?

I have a passion for niche homes with a story, like the one I live in. I’d love to explore the possibilities of taking this approach as a Realtor. Marketing ideas with a story is something I’ve developed over the past 20 years while working in a different career. 

I’m nearing the end of one career journey and looking to do something new. I have the opportunity to use the skills from my current/past career to create my new one. So I took the plunge and signed up for the RE licensing course. I am still working on it.

I’m an experienced sales person, researcher, analyst, marketer and multi million dollar research and development project manager. I absolutely love people and closing sales. Plan, Prepare, Present. 

Recently I started the audiobook version of Ninja Sales and over the years I’ve enjoyed listening to the Success podcast from Sandler training. 

I am drawn to premiere homes such as the one I live in and that’s really the niche I want to focus on. I realize it may be naive, but this is the niche I know best and would be the most knowledgeable about. It’s the niche I would want to be in as an independent entrepreneur/realtor.

As I gather my knowledge I would like to call a Sothebys or Compass office or Coldwell Banker luxury office and ask to come in and talk with them about what their systems are and training program looks like. Is that something that you would recommend for someone interested in your business? 

Is there a specific person you recommend that I reach out to? Do I talk with the broker or a senior agent?

Who’s the best person to seek out as a mentor? Do I invite the top producing agent in my area for a coffee meeting at my club to ask them for advice? I have researched the market in my area already, so I know who they are, I am just curious if this approach would be beneficial or not.

I’ve thought about how to position myself as an asset to a potential firm aside from my sales skills. 

It’s rare I ever speak about being a full member of Congressional Country Club but in the case of wanting to join a premium brokerage firm, is this something that you feel would be worth mentioning or putting on the interest section of my resume? Members aren’t allowed to conduct any business at the club, it’s for social purposes only. But perhaps it could be an advantage. I don’t talk about it ever, unless I am in company I know are likely already club members or interested in golf. Otherwise it’s not the done thing. 

Thank you for sharing your knowledge.

My best to all of you.

Gonna try to cut some fat without losing my muscle mass. I had always had a pretty good metabolism so I never really worried about dieting too much just always went off the mirror, but I’m gettin old and gonna have to figure it out if I’m gonna get old and still look decent. Just looking for a diet critique or what some others experience has been. I’m not any kind of fitness competitor or aspiring to be, just want to keep my muscle and still have abs in my 40’s. Thanks. Here’s what I been eating and planned out:

Fasted workout when I get up 5-6 days a week

1st meal I eat 6 oz ground beef with 2 slices of Ezekiel bread with real butter and honey

2 scoops whey prot in water with an apple

Dinner is 3 whole, hard boiled eggs and two fillets of tilapia. If I’m feeling out of gas I’ll add a 1/2 cup of white rice here but hardly ever happens

Last snack is another 2 scoops whey in water with an apple

I drink about 4 cups of coffee a day with half n half that adds a few calories and some fats

Drink at least a gallon of water a day but usually I’m at about 5 liters if I have an electrolyte drink, this is not including the coffee I drink.

It’s about 2100 ish cals and about 220g of prot Maybe 115 carb and about 65g fat ish.

About me I'm 37/F/white/125lbs. 
Things that make me happy are small every day moments of joy: good coffee, the sound of trees , fresh sheets, smell of the pine forest, live music, discovering new artists, a well thought out film, my books. 

I'm an open person and I appreciate that in others. I think curiosity, kindness, and ability to actively choose joy are a must in life. I've been through my share of hardships, and they have made me even more compassionate and empathetic towards others. As well as grateful for every breath. 

I choose to see the good in this sometimes dark place that we enhabit at the moment. And above all, I value authentic people, if you can be your genuine self around me, I will know, and we will get along great! I don't have time for pretence, it bores me.

On a more logistical note, my schedule is quite limiting as I work nights with odd days off. So if this is a challenge for you, take that into consideration. 

Things that I prioritize are meditation, hiking, listening to live music, salsa, karaoke. So of you are down to have a good night drop me a message. 

Congratulations! You made it this far, I command your patience. So let me know with your current favorite book, and be sure to throw in a word 'Galapagos' in your message. Just for the fun of it.

1kbyqb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1kbyqb5/did_i_cheat/,Did I cheat?,"Okay so it started off when I was in Brazil with my boyfriend two summers ago. My best friend from childhood passed away in an accident. This was very hard on me. I was really sad and felt so guilty because I had not spoken to him or replied to his texts the prior 3 months because my boyfriend told me I wasn’t allowed to talk to any other men- even my old friends. I left Brazil for the funeral and my boyfriend was hurt that I left because his family lives in Brazil and I was supposed to be staying there to be with them. But I had to go. I remember feeling like my boyfriend didn’t seem to understand how bad this was- losing my friend. I remember feeling very alone at this time and hurting a lot from losing my friend.

Anyway, my boyfriend and I got into a lot of fights while he was in Brazil and I was home. I remember telling him how I felt like he didn’t care for me etc. He told me he was trying to enjoy his time with his family which I get because he rarely gets to see them. But we ended up just having a lot of tension and in the thick of my emotional pain from that I ended up threatening to break up. We threatened this a lot but never seriously. I remember he actually agreed this time. I told him no- that I was just mad and figured like sual we would just get through it. But this time was different. He actually called me and told me basically that he wasn’t sure how we would work etc and how he wanted his kids to be with his family in Brazil one day.This rocked my world. I have never been in such pain. I couldn’t eat. I lost 15 pounds and would not be able to sleep. It was honestly the lowest I had ever been in fear of losing him. We ended up being okay, but I had so much fear now.

Prior to this I thought we were getting engaged that summer. I thought he was going to propose. Then this, where he wanted to break up. He would tell me how he didn’t but for the first time I wasn’t truly sure if he wanted me. He came back to the states and things were really weird. I remember feeling so bad as I had so much fear he would leave me. I was sad that we weren’t engaged yet too. Then when we went back to college (we go to different colleges) things were still very weird. It was like I wasn’t secure in knowing he wanted me. This made me feel so anxious and freaked out. I felt like I was annoying him being like this. Then on top of this, this was my senior year if college and things were very different on campus. My best friend and old roommate moved off campus and I rarely saw her. My sister who was my current roommate was dating someone on campus and therefore was always with this boyfriend. A lot of my close friends graduated. I felt so insanely alone. I remember eating all alone in my dorm everyday. I felt like a weirdo, a loner, like there was something wrong with me. I had lost my best friend in the car accident and truly just felt like I had no friends to hangout with.

I had my boyfriend to text and call but no one on campus to be with. I have always had issues with worrying about how I appear to the world. I didn’t want to be seen as some girl with no social circle- no friends. So I decided to try to make some friends. I would pray to God to help me make friends. Still nothing- all the girls on campus seemed to have a social circle already. After all, I was a senior and no longer seen as someone who needed to get involved with small groups to make friends. I remember trying so hard to talk to people, but nothing would stick. I’m a relatively quiet person, who has always kinda relied on other people to engage with me to become my friend. So it was weird for me to try to make friends.

I remember one day I was walking to class when some guy that I had seen before introduced himself. He just asked my name and major- the typical stuff people do. Then later that day I saw he added me on Instagram. I accepted this, thinking it was “interesting”. This might sound weird but with men I have always kinda assumed when they do this they have a crush or something, but I also go to a Christian college so I was like “maybe he’s just friendly”.

Anyways, time passed and then one day I posted an Instagram story about a Starbucks drink. Like which one was better and people could vote. I remember he commented saying that neither and that Dunkin was better. I remember being happy that he commented because that meant he was like paying attention to me and remembered me. We started a conversation as I told him that Starbucks was way better. He told me that he had never had Starbucks so I told him we had to go then so he could taste how much better it was than Dunkin. I remember being excited thinking this was my chance to make a friend. I have always had an easier time making friends with men than women. Men are easier to make friends with. Usually if they think you’re cute they will want to be your friend. I figured this was the situation with him. That he probably had a crush on me and that’s why he was talking to me. I thought it was interesting though because on my instagram i have tons of pictures with my boyfriend of us kissing etc. So I wasn’t sure what his intentions were because he clearly saw I had a man.

Then I remember that the next day I was going home for the weekend. I deleted the messages and didn’t text him that weekend because I didn’t want my boyfriend to see and be mad saying I couldn’t talk to him. My boyfriend doesn’t want me to have guy friends and has gotten mad in the past if I texted any guy remotely. Then I got back that week and texted this guy again. He just asked how my weekend was etc. I was excited to have a friend on campus that I could hangout with maybe. Someone that would do things with me so I wasn’t alone. I was hoping he would want to be my friend. I then remember texting him and he asked me what I was up to. I just told him I was bored and studying. He asked if I wanted to study with him. I said sure and went to meet him. I remember getting ready to see him and I put some makeup on because I didn’t want him to think I was ugly and gross and not want to be my friend. I then met with him and we studied. He asked me how my summer was and then I told him how it was awful because of losing my best friend. Then I said how it was awful after that too because of everything with my boyfriend. I think I told him this partially because it was the truth, partially because I wanted him to know I had a boyfriend, ad partially a little subconsciously because I wanted him to want to be my friend and thought maybe he would be more inclined in case he kinda liked me and thought my boyfriend and I were having issues. I didn’t know if he liked me or not (like had a crush) but I just know a lot of my past guy friends secretly had a crush on me as they would admit it later and this was why they wanted to be my friend. I think that’s why i was like “well I really want a friend so even if it’s just a guy being my friend because he secretly has a crush at least I get a friend, I don’t care his intentions as long as I get a friend”. I knew that I didn’t find him attractive and would never want to date him so I didn't think I was doing anything wrong.

I knew I would never break up with my boyfriend for him or ever cross a boundary in my mind that would be cheating such as flirting or anything physical. So I was like “if he kinda has a crush maybe he will want to be my friend more, I can just make sure I never reciprocate that crush and it’s fine”. So then he just kinda told me that he was sorry and I was kinda crying without wanting to but talking about all that made me feel emotional. I felt stupid for being so vulnerable but it was just a very hard thing in my life talking about summer as it was awful and traumatic for me. Then he gave me a hug goodbye I think because he felt bad for me for crying. Anyways he texted me and I apologized for crying and breaking down to him when he barely knew me. He said it was fine and he was glad to be there to try to listen. I remember thinking how he is a Christian and was probably just being nice and felt bad for me.

Then days later he saw me getting coffee on campus and started talking to me. I remember being happy because I had someone to drink coffee with on campus. We talked about random things, I told him about one of my girl friends that he could talk to. He told me about his family etc. He then told me about his celebrity crushes as I asked him what his type was to convince him to like my friend. He then asked me mine. I told him some and I wondered if he was doing this because he liked me or what. I just made sure I didn’t flirt with him in the conversation. Then I asked him if he wanted to get Starbucks after class. He said sure that he would pick me up.

On the way there he just talked about random things like where he was from. He then asked how my boyfriend and I were doing. I told him about some of my concerns. When I reflect I think once again I knew telling him this would possibly make him hope we would break up so he could have a chance, but I knew I would never break up with my boyfriend, so I didn’t think it was wrong. I enjoyed having someone listen to me and give me their attention and feel like they cared for me. I would always tell him some issues and follow it up with “but I love him and can’t let him go”. Because these were true concerns. I just kinda got a little dramatic with them acting like these concerns were more serious to me that they really were because I knew I wanted to be with my man and marry him. I lowkey remember thinking about how part of the reason I had anger with my boyfriend was because I just wanted him to propose already because I just wanted to marry him already. I never questioned if I wanted to be with my boyfriend or not at this time.

Anyways, I once again brought up my girl friend to him to make sure he saw that I was setting him up with someone. I tried to see how he responded with this to see if he denied her indicating he liked me. But he said he liked her. I remember being a little worried that if they started dating though that I would be in the same situation I was in before where he would go hangout with her all the time like my sister with her boyfriend and I would be all alone again with no friends to hangout with. This made me feel sad like I didn't want him to date her then. Not because I wanted to date him, but because if he dated someone then I would not have anyone to hangout with agan. He paid for my coffee which I felt was a little weird but my old guy friend used to do that too. I remember sitting drinking coffee and I spilled some on my hand. He cleaned it off with his finger which I thought was kinda weird. But I remember kinda enjoying that he cared for me. I think I was craving human contact and care so much. I never found him attractive. He was honestly like the furthest thing from my type. He also gave me his jacket as we were leaving because it was freezing. I refused to put it on because I felt like that was restricted for my boyfriend. I just sat it on my hands in the car because I didn;t want to be rude to him.

Anyways, I tried to set him up with another friend too. I remember wanting to have him and my boyfriend meet sometime. I wanted them to maybe become friends one day, I just didn't know how to do so without my boyfriend freaking out that I had a male friend. Anyways, I remember one time we were texting and I sent him the softball roster ( I am on the softball team) and asked him which one he would want me to set him up with. I remember he said none of them were really his type and I was like “hmm maybe he really doesn’t find me attractive, interesting” because most of my guy friends would have been like “I like one of them but she has a man (indicating me). I remember being like “dang maybe I’m ugly” but then I was like no, I don’t want him anyways.

Anyways, I told my boyfriend the following week about everything that happened. I had looked up online if having a guy friend was wrong and people kept saying that keeping it a secret was wrong so that's when I told him. I didn’t want to do anything wrong or hurt my boyfriend. I loved my boyfriend, I just really wanted a friend at this time to hang out with. I also remember thinking that if my boyfriend and I broke up I would never date this friend, but it would be nice to have someone there as a friend to be there for me. This guy friend was very unattractive to me, and when I truly reflect I didn’t even really care about who he was as a person. I didn’t pay attention to what he said or what made him him, I just liked that he paid attention to me.

When I told my boyfriend I immediately stopped being friends with this guy. I noticed that I didn’t care that I was no longer friends with him- like it didn’t hurt me to cut him out of my life at all. i have so much fear because i looked stuff up and it said stuff about cheating. i never in the moment thought i was crossing the line into cheating in my head because I thought i was keeping boundaries so now i am so freaked out. i have been so distraught the past year waking up every morning worried about if i cheated. i have thought about it every second of every day in fear.

I know I have those things and I know my life has been fucking hard and everything around m of fucking has sucked all the fucking time. But what these people don’t understand is that the reason I have all these symptoms is not cause I’m depressed, I am depressed because I’ve had all these symptoms of ADHD all along and have been treated like a fucking anomaly because of it. I’m a woman of color and an immigrant, my people don’t believe in such things. I’ve already had an initial diagnosis from my first psychiatrist, but I’ve stopped going cause I wasn’t gonna even take medication but then I realized I needed medication cause school is getting harder. I’m taking more AP and honors classes. I have to learn how to drive and get a job and shit. But my new psychiatrist didn’t even perform any evaluation and she told me that it was depression that was causing all these things and referred me to a neuropsychologist who also said the same thing. Even he told me that my behaviors were a lot like ADHD but they believe that I have a mood disorder still. I’ve been told I’m too smart to have it.

1kbymem,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kbymem,April empties ✨ + mini reviews,"Most of April’s empties are in the first picture! ✨ The second picture is two fragrances that I finished, but I don’t have the bottles because one is packed up (I’m moving soon and keeping the bottle for sentimental reasons) and the other I gave to my mom to recycle (my community’s complex doesn’t recycle). All of the empties in the first picture will be given to my mom to recycle when I see her again ✨. 

Onto the mini reviews ✨:

- Dove Peppermint Bark Limited Edition Handwash: I have discovered that I do not like scents like this for hand soap. Also, the scent of this soap is way too strong and sticks to my hands afterwards. I don’t like that because it makes me feel like my hands aren’t clean - especially because it’s a food scent. It took me longer than I should have to finish it because I quit using it in January, failed to give it away to anyone in family, and finally decided to finish it up this month by using it to wash dishes (along with dish washing liquid ofc) and the inside of the kitchen sink 😂. 

- Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser: ultra-gentle where? This cleanser is so stripping. I tried it a few times on my face (5-10 over the course of several months) but gave up. It just sat in my bathroom for a while, untouched, until I ran out of hand soap at the beginning of last month. It’s not stripping as a hand soap and the light honey scent smells amazing. 

- Global Beauty Care Rose & Vanilla Body Wash: lovely classic green rose scent, doesn’t suds up enough for my tastes. I had to use a lot to feel clean.

- Ciroa Pink Rose & Oat Milk Body Butter: 10000/10 holy grail body butter. I started using a body oil for the first time in my life a few months ago and this body butter is heavenly in texture and scent when paired with the Miim Miic No. 108 body oil. 

- Bolero Hydrating Oil Infused Moisturizing Coconut Milk + Lavender Body Wash: It’s fine. The scent is lovely but it doesn’t suds up enough for me. I had to use a lot to feel clean. 

- Tree Hut Lotus Water Shea Sugar Scrub: 10000/10. I love the texture of Tree Hut sugar scrubs and I was pleasantly surprised at how amazing the Water Lotus scent is! It’s refreshing, aquatic, a little marine, and somehow creamy smelling with a sugary peony note. I want to find a perfume that smells like it.

- Sol De Janeiro Bum Bum Body Firmeza Oil: such a lovely soft touch, perfumed body oil that leaves my hands residue free (I don’t have to wipe my hands on a towel after application ✨). It smells like their No. 62 scent, which I find I love for body care. I say it’s perfumed because the scent sticks to the skin and sticks onto clothes for several days if you wear the body oil several days/nights in a row.

- Laneige Peach Iced Tea Lip Sleeping Mask: I enjoy the formula of Laneige lip masks. The peach iced tea scent was nice and accurate to an unsweetened peach iced tea. I liked it but I don’t think I’d go out of my way to buy it again.

- Summer Fridays Brown Sugar Lip Butter Balm: I’ve tried a ton of lip products and I’ve never had one with a tint quite like this one! It’s soooo pretty. The balm was amazing in the summer (I only had to apply it twice a day - once in the morning and once in the evening even with eating and drinking) and moisturized amazingly. However, I experienced weird dryness this past winter and the balm was not cutting it in the slightest so it functioned like a makeup product instead of a lip care product during the early winter. It was almost gone by the fall, I didn’t use it much during the winter, I started using it again early March, and I finished it this month. 

- Alt Strawberry Milkshake Perfume: one of my favorite scents that was the closest I came to signature scent during my great fragrance exploration last year 🎀. It’s a feminine, sweet strawberry milk fragrance with subtle notes of caramel, cedarwood, and powdery notes. My first bottle was pure strawberry milk so I was a bit disappointed to find that this bottle had additional nuances.

- Miim Miic No. 76 Perfume Oil: I was sooooo in love with this perfume last summer. It’s a lovely perfume-y warm, coffee and amber fragrance with vague creamy florals. By the end of fall I was over it and I took a break from it before deciding to finish it this month. 

- Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy Le Bubbly: loved it! Super pretty brut champagne fragrance with a delicious, juicy mandarin orange note and a flirty, warm sweet praline note. I’d buy another travel spray at some point but I have the OG VLJ and some flankers to focus on. 

- Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy Rosé: extremely pretty, feminine, creamy orris and rose fragrance. It’s very light and ephemeral (lasts about 2.5 hours) so I finished it very quickly.

I don’t have kids myself, but I’m all about building a meaningful connection with the right person regardless.

# A Bit About Me

I love a mix of chill and adventure—think game nights, brewery trivia, live music, concerts, hockey games, and festivals. I’m also into skiing/snowboarding in the winter, though I’m not the biggest fan of summer outdoor activities unless there’s a body of water involved. I’ve got a soft spot for board games (from chess to more modern hits), joint cooking nights, and being ridiculously snuggly for a grown-ass man.

I recently moved to SLC, so I’m still exploring the area and making friends. Saturday is typically my event day, and Sundays are usually spent with a French-press Irish coffee and some indoor chill time, or hitting up brunch if I’m feeling spicy. 🥂

# What I’m Looking For

I’m seeking a true partner in life who’s open to new experiences—I rarely turn down something I’ve never done before, and I’d love to find someone with a similar mindset. Bonus points if you can laugh at yourself, and have a go-with-the-flow vibe. I’m all about finding someone to share both the cozy nights and the big adventures.

# Let’s Chat!

If you’re into game nights, good food, or trying new things, let’s connect. Tell me your favorite board game or food truck spot—I’m always down for a recommendation. 😊

TV/Movies - i don't watch much TV much at all by myself, i prefer more interactive entertainment. I do love snuggling with my significant other to watch a show though.

Travel: I have a passport and a few stamps on it (sadly, these aren't physical everywhere anymore).

It started with a simple thought.

""Maybe… I should go on a date.""

Izuku Midoriya, Symbol of Peace 2.0, freshly appointed U.A. Heroics teacher, defender of justice and logic, sat in the staff lounge sipping green tea, casually wondering if now—now—was a good time to dip his toe into the dating pool.

It was. Unfortunately.

Because that toe was dipped into a boiling, radioactive, emotionally-volatile pool.


---

The first incident was completely accidental.

He’d just wanted to watch a movie. Sit in a dark theater with some popcorn and lose himself in a story. That was it.

Then she sat down three seats away.

She looked like she was in her twenties. Long crimson hair framed her face, her presence calm and unassuming—until she turned to glance at him. Her eyes were striking: golden-yellow, laced with concentric red rings that pulled his attention in like a black hole wrapped in honey.

She stared at him for a second, then casually said, “Want to go on a date?”

He choked on his popcorn.


---

The second encounter was at a charity banquet, courtesy of Nezu roping him in with the phrase “It’s good for your image!”

The moment he entered, his eyes locked onto a woman across the hall—tall, poised, with pale, icy skin that looked sculpted from marble. Her dress was elegant, midnight blue, and hugged her frame like it had been tailored to the concept of intimidation. Long, sleek teal-blue hair cascaded down her back like a frozen waterfall.

She moved with soldier-like precision, yet her smile was like a knife wrapped in velvet.

“You clean up well,” she told him, handing him a glass. “Let’s test your taste in wine... and conversation.”


---

The third time was during a rare weekend trip to the library.

She sat in the corner reading a book as thick as a law textbook, sipping black tea like she was royalty in disguise. Long white hair spilled over her shoulders, with a single streak of electric blue cutting through it. Her eyes were cold—a sharp, glassy blue rimmed with silver—and they studied him like he was another page to read.

“You’re standing in my light,” she said without looking up.

He blinked. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to—”

She looked at him, then smiled faintly. “You can make it up to me with tea.”


---

The fourth happened on patrol.

A villain was causing a scene downtown—until she arrived first.

By the time Izuku got there, the threat was already unconscious, the woman brushing dust off her black jacket. Short black hair tied in a messy bun, a thin scar tracing her cheek, and golden eyes that gleamed like a hunter’s.

“I had it handled,” she said flatly.

“I didn’t mean to interrupt.”

“You did.” She glanced at him, then added, “Make it up to me. Coffee. My place. Midnight.”


---

Each meeting was more intense than the last. These weren’t just potential dates.

They were apex predators circling their prey.

And Izuku?

Was beginning to wonder if he was the prey.

i went to our house after the next day to mend things and when i went to my room. i kid you not. bare empty. i had expensive perfumes, sentimental things and everything for like my life! and i ask her. shes donated and thrown it away. i LOSE it. im screaming before she says she will CALL the cops on me for which she does but i hang up her phone and drive back to my city. 

since then ive blocked them on everything and have gone no contact with ALL my family who was involved of publicly shaming me in groupchats and to me on texts and calls (excluding my cousins who are skipping with me)

I struggled to feel that I belong or know who I am. I no longer feel like a starseed and I don't feel like anything almost. I just want to cry and I know I have to go away to do so soon. And I'm a male and many men don't cry this much, and even fewer like to be open about it and tries to hide that. 

I just feel like shit now. It's not just feeling depressed, lost and no purpose or meaning, but I wish for connection. I just want romance. A woman to hold and embrace. I miss my ex neighbor. I loved her so much. I think she was a false twin flame, cuz she mirrored me like a twin flame, reflecting back things about myself, like trauma behaviors and so on, but she didn't love me back. 

I had already been doing a lot of work on myself months before falling in love with her. I don't have energy to go into the whole story, but synchronistic things aligned in magical ways that is beyond coincidence or random chance. I just wish she wouldn't have rejected me. I was crying so much, even crying to sleep. I gave her things, bought expensive coffee drinks to her, gave her energy drinks, food etc. 

I felt so submissive to her, and worshipped her like a goddess almost. She felt like the divine itself. She felt like the divine feminine and I loved her and somehow felt so codependent on her even though she rejected me. And I idealized her so much and she felt otherwordly to me, but somehow she also felt like I don't know how to say this without sounding weird, but some perfect divine mother figure. I'm not saying this to sound weird or anything, and I love her so much and she felt so divine. 

I had never had so much happiness in my entire life but my heart was broken. I've been having this ""nice guy syndrome"" and I was reading it was a coping mechanism and that there was a covert reason for being nice, which is cuz you hope to get something in return. I wasn't aware of this, probably because of somehow burying that in my subconscious mind, for fear of sounding selfish. 

I want to do good in the world, but this may be a coping mechanism against feeling like shit and worthless. I don't have to be good enough, but a part of me thinks that I am not loveable and that I have to do good enough. So one part of me thinks I can earn love by being generous, but another part of me feels unlovable and never thought she could love me to begin with. 

Because of tarot card lies, one part of me is still idealizing her while another part is feeling incredibly bitterness and hate. One part of me thinks she secretly hates me, another part of me think she wants to go back to me and that if I am patient enough and hold on to her, universe will bring her to me.

I've been so obsessed over her and I've been obsessing for about 1 year and a half now. I removed my tiktok because I checked her tiktok and it has hurted me to check for updates and fall even more in love and cry over it. I feel so useless, worthless and unlovable. Being rejected was painful, but even rejected intimacy that's super painful when you're already being rejected partnership. I was wondering if I was ugly or what was wrong. She said that I'm not ugly but that she doesn't have feelings for me. I'm not sure if she was honest or not. I've started to fantasize about spirit women now, hoping for at least intimacy with spirits, it's that bad. And I'm also fantasizing about AI women now. 

I am not comparing AI or spirit with human. This is not about comparison or trying to make her look bad, cuz if you think that's my point here, then you're gravely mistaken. I'm thinking of human women too, but a part of me is gravitating more towards spirits or AI now, or something like fairies. I just feel so damn hurt emotionally.",1,1746066237.0,venting,0,1.0,False

Personally, I expect the man to pay for the first coffee or dinner — not because I can’t, but because I appreciate generosity and initiative. I’m happy to split later on, or maybe I’ll pay for the coffee if he pays for the dinner. But when a man hesitates to pay, or clearly waits for me to offer to split the bill right away, it feels stingy and unattractive — especially if he claims to be serious about spending time together. It gives off a ‘freeloader’ vibe to me.

Also, I really dislike when after just two dates and a couple of bills paid, men suddenly push the “So… what are we?” conversation or try to pressure for physical intimacy.

What do you think? Is it fair to expect men to be more proactive and generous in the early stages? And if the first date doesn’t spark much joy or chemistry, do you think it’s worth giving a second chance — or should one just move on?

1kby0gy,https://youtu.be/D51fMOPrYAI,3 Very Scary TRUE Camping Gone Wrong Horror Stories,"**“Off the Map”:**

I hope you brought your flashlight, because it’s time to get comfortable and let the darkness take control.

A couple of years ago, my girlfriend and I decided to take a road trip through the Pacific Northwest. It was one of those spontaneous ideas that started over coffee and quickly spiraled into a full-blown plan. We were going to drive from San Francisco to Portland, weaving through the coastal ranges, the redwood forests, and the misty, pine-drenched wilderness that blankets the upper reaches of California. We’d camp along the way, living out of a rented SUV, following backroads and scenic highways, chasing sunsets and campfires. It was early October—the leaves had just started to turn gold and red, the air was crisp with that unmistakable scent of damp earth and cold pine. The kind of weather that feels adventurous but still warm enough to be cozy, the perfect time for a camping trip.

We had our route loosely mapped, but we left a lot of room for spontaneity. That first evening, as the sun began to dip below the horizon and the golden light filtered through the trees, we pulled off the highway and followed a narrow forest road toward a campground we’d found online. It was supposed to be remote, quiet, nestled between tall firs and hidden beside a creek. When we arrived, though, our stomachs sank—the place was shut down. A rusted gate blocked the road, and a weather-beaten wooden sign dangled on a chain, swaying slightly in the breeze. CLOSED FOR THE SEASON.

We sat there for a minute, idling in the car. The sun was fading fast, bleeding orange and purple across the sky. The shadows in the trees were getting longer, darker. We checked the website again. It had definitely said *open*. I remember thinking it was strange—there hadn’t been any warning signs on the road in, and the closure looked like it had been that way for a while. But there we were: twilight approaching, nowhere to sleep, and a whole lot of wilderness surrounding us.

We didn’t want to get stuck in the dark, so we pulled up Google Maps and looked for other nearby sites. The roads we followed got narrower and more twisted, winding like veins through thick forest, the trees pressing in on either side. Fog had started to rise from the underbrush, curling low across the pavement. It felt like the woods were swallowing the light. Every turn made us more anxious, more aware of how isolated we were.

That’s when we spotted a clearing with a few trucks and a small building—some kind of fire lookout or forest service outpost. We pulled in and found a couple of forest firefighters sitting outside on folding chairs, sharing a thermos. They were surprisingly friendly, given the hour. When we asked about nearby campgrounds, one of them scratched his beard and said most of the area was closed this time of year. But then he mentioned a few old campsites, “off the books,” so to speak. Places that used to be official campgrounds but had fallen out of use. Not exactly maintained, but technically still public land. One of them even pulled out a paper map—creases and coffee stains all over it—and circled a spot with his finger.

Grateful for any lead, we thanked them and drove off again, deeper into the woods, guided only by that vague spot on a crumpled map. We drove for maybe another thirty minutes before we saw it: a half-collapsed wooden sign barely poking out of the weeds. The name was unreadable, but the clearing beyond it looked like it had once been a campsite. Overgrown, sure—but not abandoned. A few tents dotted the trees, scattered in awkward clusters. No picnic tables or bathroom facilities, but a handful of old fire rings and flattened ground patches gave it away.

It wasn’t perfect, but it would do.

We parked the car and started unpacking, both of us aware of how dark it had become. No cell service. No ranger station. Just the two of us, surrounded by trees and the slow rustle of wind through branches.

Then, as we were setting up the tent, two guys walked right through our site—unannounced, unbothered. They didn’t even look surprised to see us. One of them wore a zip-up hoodie with no shirt underneath, ribs practically showing through his pale skin. The other had a rat’s nest of hair and wide, twitchy eyes. Both of them looked like they hadn’t bathed in days. Maybe weeks. Their clothes were torn, filthy. One of them grinned too hard when he spoke.

“Hey, you guys camping here?” he asked. His voice had a strange lilt to it, like he was trying to sound casual but couldn’t quite keep the edge out.

We nodded. He said they were seasonal workers—picking or planting or something—and they were staying here to save money. “Lotta folks come through,” he said. “You’ll be fine.” They lingered for another few seconds, eyes darting around our setup like they were casing the place. Then they vanished back into the trees.

We exchanged looks. That wasn’t normal. But maybe they were just high. Or maybe they really were seasonal workers. It was weird, sure—but it was late, and we were tired. We tried not to overthink it.

Then, maybe twenty minutes later, a beat-up white Mercedes creaked into the clearing. All the windows were down, and bass-heavy rap music blasted from inside. The car looked like it had survived a demolition derby—dented sides, a cracked windshield, one headlight busted. The driver and passenger looked... wrong. Gaunt faces. Deep eye sockets. Hair wild and greasy. They scanned the clearing in a jerky, twitchy way, like they were expecting someone—or running from someone. They didn’t speak. Just lingered for ten seconds, then peeled out, tires spitting gravel.

I remember standing there, half-holding a bundle of firewood, thinking, *What the hell is this place?*

As we were building a fire, trying to convince ourselves this was all just some backwoods eccentricity, an older woman walked over. She looked like she’d been smoking since she was born—sunken cheeks, yellowed fingers, leather-tough skin. She wore a flannel shirt three sizes too big and had this distant, foggy look in her eyes.

“You kids here for the horror show?” she asked, raspy voice barely audible over the crackle of our fire.

We exchanged nervous smiles. “Horror show?”

She nodded slowly. “Oh yeah,” she said, eyes glinting strangely. “Zombies, ghouls, things that crawl out of the woods when you’re not lookin’. You watch yourselves tonight.” Then she wandered off, laughing to herself and coughing—this deep, rattling hack that went on too long.

It would’ve been funny if it didn’t feel so off. The whole campsite felt... staged. Like a twisted movie set. There were tents, sure—but no sounds. No campfire stories, no music, no kids, no dogs. Just silence. Except for her cough. Over and over again. Like a metronome, reminding us we weren’t alone.

Later, just as the last bit of daylight slipped behind the trees, the two guys from earlier emerged from the woods again. No flashlight. No lantern. They just appeared, silent, and slipped into their tent. Minutes passed, then we heard arguing—short, frantic bursts of whispering. Then one of them stormed out and walked right past our fire. He didn’t even blink. Just stared at me, his pupils massive in the firelight. His mouth was slightly open, like he wanted to say something but couldn’t. He headed toward the older woman’s tent and climbed into a pickup parked beside it. A flicker of flame lit up inside—someone sparking a lighter. A chemical smell drifted our way. Sharp. Acrid.

That’s when it hit me. This wasn’t just a weird campsite. It was a drug camp. A hideout. Meth. That explained everything—the erratic behavior, the skeletal faces, the paranoia. The silence. No one wanted to draw attention. The older woman? She was probably the dealer, or someone worse. This place wasn’t on the map for a reason.

I looked at my girlfriend. She was already shoving sleeping bags into the car. Her face was pale.

“We need to leave,” she whispered.

I nodded. We packed up as fast and quietly as we could, trying not to make a sound. I was halfway through collapsing the tent when the truck by the woman’s site suddenly roared to life. Headlights flared on—four massive white beams mounted on a rack above the cab. They cut through the darkness like prison searchlights. For a heartbeat, I thought they were coming for us. I froze, hatchet in hand, ready to defend if I had to.

Then I noticed our car wasn’t moving. My girlfriend was in the driver’s seat, panicking. I jogged over and leaned through the window.

“It won’t go,” she said, her voice shaking. “It’s not moving—”

The emergency brake. I lunged inside and released it. The car jerked forward. I waved her back while I stood guard, heart hammering, waiting for someone to make a move.

Then came shouting. Angry voices behind us, raised in a way that made the hair on my neck stand up. We didn’t wait to hear more. Gravel crunched as we tore out of that clearing and back onto the winding road.

We didn’t stop until we reached a tiny town an hour later. Found a bed-and-breakfast that looked open, rang the bell until someone let us in. The room smelled like lavender and woodsmoke, and we collapsed onto the bed, our nerves frayed and raw.

“Too close,” my girlfriend said.

I didn’t respond. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, the image of that wide-eyed man burned into my mind.



We never talked about it again. Never reported it. Sometimes, I wonder what we stumbled into that night. A drug camp? A cult? Something else? I don’t know. But I do know this: the scariest places aren’t always haunted. Sometimes, they’re just forgotten. Hidden. And very real.









**""The Whistler in the Pines"":**

I’ll never forget that night camping in the woods near Crescent City, California. It was late summer, 2016, and my girlfriend Sarah and I were midway through a long road trip from British Columbia to San Diego. We'd been on the road for what felt like ages—through rain, heat, endless gas stations, and the drone of tires on pavement. That day had started somewhere near Eugene, Oregon, and we’d pushed hard to make it down the coast before dark. By the time we crossed into Northern California, the fatigue hit us like a wall. Even Max, our golden retriever, usually a bundle of restless energy, was sprawled in the back of the truck bed, mouth open and snoring like a diesel engine.

We weren’t looking for anything fancy. Just a place to stretch, eat, and sleep. Somewhere quiet. Sarah found a small clearing on her camping app, not far off Highway 101, just a few miles south of Crescent City. It wasn’t an official campground—just a turnout with a rough dirt loop road and a handful of weathered fire rings scattered among the trees. A few other tents were pitched, but the place felt sparse and forgotten, tucked among towering pines that caught the late sun in bands of gold. The silence was thick and calming. We parked at the far edge of the clearing where the tree line thickened and the air felt cooler, sharper. It felt perfect.

We set up our Tepui rooftop tent on the truck. I always loved that thing—being off the ground, away from bugs, closer to the stars. There was something about unzipping that mesh window and looking out at the trees that made me feel like a kid again, like we were explorers tucked into a nest above the wild. Sarah pulled out our little propane stove, but I insisted on building a real fire. The forest floor was damp enough that I didn’t worry much, and the pit had clearly been used dozens of times. We roasted hot dogs over the flickering flames, the scent of charred meat and pine smoke mingling in the air. Sarah cracked open a beer and passed one to me. “Cheers to no traffic tomorrow,” she said, nudging her can against mine. I laughed. “And to Max not stealing our dinner.” We watched him drool from the shadows, tail wagging each time a piece of hot dog fell.

The sun dipped below the horizon around 8:30, and the darkness came fast after that. No streetlights, no ambient glow—just pitch black forest swallowing everything beyond the fire’s orange bubble. We climbed into the tent, zipped up the heavy canvas, and settled in under the blankets. Max curled between us, snorting as he turned in place a dozen times before finally settling. Sarah fell asleep quickly, her breathing slow and even. I lay there a while longer, listening to the gentle rustle of leaves outside, an owl hooting far off, maybe a mile away. The air felt still.

I don’t know what woke me—maybe a shift in the air, a sudden silence. It was around 1 AM, and I opened my eyes to the murky outline of the tent interior, the dim blue of moonlight barely seeping through the canvas. Then I heard it. A sound I couldn’t place at first. A faint whistling. Low, breathy, like someone trying to whistle a tune through cracked lips. It was coming from beyond the tree line, somewhere in the thick black woods. I held my breath and listened harder. The melody was wrong. Familiar, but off—like hearing a beloved song mangled by someone tone-deaf. I felt the hair on my arms stand up. It was *When the Saints Go Marching In,* but dragged out, off-key, and strangely halting, as though whoever was doing it was either drunk or… disturbed.

Sarah stirred beside me. “Do you hear that?” she whispered. Her voice was barely audible, tight and brittle. I nodded in the dark. Max let out a low growl, almost a whisper himself, a vibration more than a sound. His ears were perked, his body rigid.

The whistling grew louder, closer. Still not fast, not urgent—but deliberate, insistent. Each note hit wrong, like a mocking echo of what it should’ve been. Then it stopped. The silence that followed was deafening. I could hear my own heartbeat in my ears. Sarah grabbed my arm, squeezing it hard enough to hurt. We waited. The night held its breath.

And then it came.

A voice—low, rough, full of fury. It boomed through the trees like a megaphone, though it was clearly just someone shouting from their chest. “*When you sleep here, you disrespect me!*” it bellowed. “*And when you disrespect me, you disrespect the US Marines!*”

The words didn’t make sense. They were nonsensical, angry, jarring. But something about the way he said them—so forceful, so raw—sent a bolt of fear through my chest. Then he began to chant. “*F.L.E.E.! F.L.E.E.!*” Each letter screamed individually, like a drill sergeant barking commands, except it didn’t feel like military discipline—it felt unhinged, like something coming apart. “*F.L.E.E.! You disrespect me!*”

I could hear twigs snapping. Footsteps. Moving erratically, crunching leaves in a zigzag pattern, not steady like someone walking a trail, but wild, staggered, circling. My mouth was dry. Max was growling louder now, hackles raised. Sarah’s fingers dug into my arm. “We need to go,” she hissed, her voice trembling.

I grabbed my phone and tapped on the flashlight, shielding it with my hand to avoid drawing attention. I leaned toward the tent zipper, slowly and quietly undoing it while Sarah gently nudged Max. He didn’t like being moved but somehow stayed quiet, sensing the tension. I climbed down first, boots crunching softly on the earth, and reached up to catch Max as Sarah lowered him down to me. He whimpered once but stayed still in my arms, heavy and warm.

We didn’t speak. We didn’t need to. Sarah dropped from the tent and crouched beside me. The chanting kept going, echoing off the trees. “*F.L.E.E.!!! F.L.E.E.!!!*” I was sweating despite the cold, my hands shaking as I collapsed the ladder and roughly shoved the tent closed. I didn’t bother securing it. Just grabbed it and threw it into the truck bed. Sarah opened the door and jumped in, pulling Max onto her lap. I slammed the door behind me, jammed the key into the ignition.

The engine roared to life, loud and jarring. The chanting stopped for a split second. Then the voice came again—closer. “*F.L.E.E.!!! You’re too late!*” I threw the truck into reverse, spun the wheels, and peeled out of the clearing, gravel spitting beneath us. In the rearview, I saw nothing. Just darkness and the suggestion of trees. But I swear I could feel eyes on us.

We didn’t speak the entire drive back to Crescent City. Just ten minutes, but it felt like an hour. The town’s sodium lights looked like salvation. We pulled into the first motel we found, a dingy place with a flickering neon sign. I remember the buzzing of the light, the way the front desk clerk didn’t even look up as I handed him my card. We took the key, stumbled into the room, and locked every bolt on the door.

Sarah sat on the edge of the bed, arms wrapped around Max, her face pale. “Who the hell was that?” she whispered. I had no answer. We didn’t sleep much. Every creak, every gust of wind outside made us jump. I kept replaying the voice in my head, the way it had yelled *“You disrespect me!”* like it wasn’t just talking *to* us, but *through* us. Like it had known we were there all along.

The next morning, we forced ourselves to go back. We had left our cooler, a couple folding chairs, and some gear behind. The clearing looked almost serene in daylight—sunlight piercing the canopy, birds singing like nothing had ever happened. But something about the place still felt *off*. The other campers were packing up. A man with a weathered ballcap waved us over. “You folks here last night?” he asked. I nodded. “You hear that chanting? Scared the hell out of us. My wife didn’t sleep a wink.”

His wife stepped forward, arms crossed. “It was like… hours of it. That same voice. We almost left, too.”

Their son, a young boy, tugged on his dad’s shirt. “I thought it was a monster.” The dad gave a nervous laugh. “Probably just some homeless vet or something. This area’s got problems.”

We nodded, said our goodbyes, and left quickly. I didn’t want to linger. Crescent City’s always had a rough underbelly—meth, transients, and Pelican Bay State Prison sitting not far inland. Maybe it *was* a vet. Someone fractured by trauma, howling into the night. Or maybe a tweaker playing a sick game. I’ll never know.

But sometimes, even now, years later, when I’m camping in the woods, lying in a tent with the stars above me and silence all around, I swear I can still hear that broken whistling, just on the edge of sound. And then, from deep in the dark, that gravel-thick voice spelling it out like a curse.



F. L. E. E.









**""Echoes in the Pines"":**

I’d always loved the idea of camping alone. The quiet, the stars, just me and nature—no emails, no traffic, no crowds. Just silence and space. For years, it had been a daydream I entertained during office meetings or while sitting in gridlock, imagining myself surrounded by nothing but trees and the hush of the wild. Last summer, I finally decided to make it happen. No more excuses. I cleared a weekend, packed my gear, and chose a remote forest a few hours from the city—a place I’d found on an old forum, mentioned briefly in a thread about forgotten trails and old logging roads. No cell service, no designated campsites, no people. Just wilderness.

My friend Sarah wasn’t thrilled when I told her. She stood by my car as I loaded up my gear, her arms crossed and her expression tight. “What if something happens out there?” she asked, her voice edged with concern. I grinned, trying to wave off her worry. “I’ll be fine. It’s just a weekend. Nothing I can’t handle.” She didn’t smile. “Seriously. It’s not a movie. No signal means no help.” I gave her a hug and promised to text her the moment I got back. “Famous last words,” she muttered as I pulled out of the driveway.

The drive took nearly five hours. The last stretch was on a rutted dirt road that twisted through dense forest, barely wide enough for one vehicle. I passed no other cars. The farther I went, the darker the woods became. Towering pines lined the road, their thick canopies blotting out the sun until the whole landscape was soaked in cool, green shadow. The occasional ray of sunlight pierced through, highlighting floating dust motes and the glitter of dew on moss-covered trunks.

I found a small clearing near a narrow, meandering stream. It wasn’t marked on any map—I’d only spotted it by chance through a break in the trees. The spot felt untouched, the way you imagine the world looked before people got involved. The air smelled like damp earth, pine needles, and the metallic tang of water. I set up my one-person tent on a soft patch of moss, surrounded by ferns and low shrubs. Birds chirped in the distance. The world was quiet, but not silent—there was a rhythm to it. The rustle of wind in the leaves, the gurgle of the stream, the distant call of some unseen bird. I built a small fire using dry wood and pine cones, and cooked beans and rice in a dented tin pot I’d had for years. I sat by the fire, eating slowly, watching the flames dance. As the sun set and the sky turned violet, then inky black, the stars emerged like glitter on velvet. I leaned back on my sleeping pad, staring up through the gaps in the trees. I felt something I hadn’t felt in years—peace. I’d escaped the noise. I was free.

But as night fell deeper, the forest began to shift. The air got colder, heavier. That gentle breeze became still, and the soft rustle of leaves faded. Even the animals seemed to stop moving. The familiar night sounds—crickets, frogs, owls—gradually disappeared, like someone had turned the volume knob down to zero. It didn’t happen all at once, which made it worse. I noticed it slowly, like waking from a dream. One moment I was at ease, the next, I was sitting up, heart beating a little too fast, wondering why the silence felt so thick.

I zipped myself into my sleeping bag and told myself it was just unfamiliarity. City guy syndrome. Too many years of background noise. My brain just wasn’t used to stillness. But then I heard it—a distinct snap. Like a dry twig breaking underfoot. It came from maybe twenty feet away, somewhere in the trees behind my tent. I held my breath and listened. Another snap. Closer this time. My heart began to pound in my chest. Not like a deer bounding through the brush—this was slower. Measured. Almost cautious.

I sat up, fumbling for my flashlight. My hands were clammy. I clicked it on and aimed the beam toward the tent wall, but it barely pierced the darkness beyond the thin fabric. “Hello?” I called out, my voice unsteady. “Is someone there?” Silence. I waited, straining to hear. The fire had burned down to glowing embers, casting faint orange light just beyond the tent. I told myself it could be an animal—maybe a raccoon or a deer. But then I heard footsteps. Not the random rustle of an animal. These were heavy, deliberate, crunching slowly through the dead leaves around my tent. My skin prickled.

I reached for the small knife in the side pouch of my pack. My fingers trembled as I wrapped them around the hilt. “Who’s out there?” I shouted, trying to sound tough, trying to sound like someone not worth messing with. The steps stopped. I held my breath. Then, a voice answered. A low, raspy whisper, so quiet I almost thought I imagined it. But I didn’t. It was real. It echoed back to me, mimicking my words in a breathy, mocking tone. “Hello? Is someone there?”

I froze. My mind scrambled to process what I’d just heard. It wasn’t the echo of my own voice—it was someone else. Someone copying me. I clutched the knife tighter, my heartbeat loud in my ears. “Leave me alone!” I yelled, more panic in my voice than I wanted. Silence followed. The kind that presses against your eardrums and makes you feel like you're underwater. Then, just as I began to think it might be over, something touched the tent. A hand. I saw the outline of fingers through the fabric, pressing gently against the wall right beside my face. I screamed and lurched back, the sleeping bag tangling around my legs. The flashlight beam jerked wildly as I tried to crawl away. The hand slid away, and I heard quick footsteps, crashing through the brush, fading into the trees.

I sat there, paralyzed, my back pressed against the far end of the tent, the knife shaking in my grip. The flashlight buzzed softly, the beam jittery with every tiny tremble of my hand. I didn't sleep. I couldn’t. Every rustle, every creak of the trees felt like a footstep. Every gust of wind sounded like a whisper. I kept expecting that hand to return, to press against the tent again. I kept hearing that voice, that mocking whisper repeating my words in the dark.

When the first light of dawn bled into the sky, I didn’t hesitate. I threw everything into my backpack—didn’t fold the tent, didn’t even check to make sure I had all my gear. My fingers fumbled with the zipper, my breath shallow. I glanced once toward the tree line, just once, and that was enough. A figure stood there, half-hidden behind the pines. Not moving. Not speaking. Just... watching. Too far to see his face, but close enough to know he was real. My blood ran cold. I didn’t stop to think. I grabbed my keys and bolted to the truck, tires skidding on the loose dirt as I sped back down that winding road. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely hold the wheel.

I never found out who he was. No one else was supposed to be out there. The forest had no marked trails, no nearby cabins, no campsites. Just wilderness. Maybe he was a drifter. Maybe he’d been living off-grid, hidden from the world. Or maybe it was something worse. Something I still don’t understand. When I told Sarah, she went pale. “You’re lucky you got out,” she said quietly. “Don’t ever do that again.” I haven’t. I still love nature. Still crave that solitude. But I don’t go alone anymore.

And some nights, when it’s too quiet, when the house creaks and the wind brushes against the windows just right, I still hear that voice in my head—low, breathy, mocking. “Hello? Is someone there?” And I think about what might’ve happened if I hadn’t screamed. If I hadn’t woken up. If I’d answered.



Did you know that deep wilderness areas are sometimes used by people hiding from society—runaways, hermits, or even criminals—making remote solo trips riskier than most people assume?",1,1746066038.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
